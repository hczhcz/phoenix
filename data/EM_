SHAPE UP: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TROUT HABITAT AND DIFFERENTLY SHAPED ROCKS.
Alex Graham Schnaderbeck
Sargent High School, Monte Vista CO, USA

I studied the relationship between trout habitat and differently shaped rocks. In streams, areas of reduced velocity are a critical component of trout habitat. In the western U.S., high spring flows have a significant negative impact on trout populations. I researched and tested different rock shapes to determine which rock shape produces the greatest area of reduced velocity and corresponding trout habitat. <br><br>I constructed a wooden measuring flume and laid out a grid to provide precise locations while measuring velocities. I used plywood and concrete to create a variety of natural rock shapes with consistent volumes. I placed each rock at a central location within the flume and recorded water velocities. I modified topographic mapping software to create Iso-fluvial graphs depicting different areas of velocity. Areas of reduced velocity were recorded for each rock shape and conclusions were drawn from the data. <br><br>My data indicated that the best rocks, the “c” shaped rocks, produced 62% more trout habitat than the least effective shaped rock, which was a round shaped rock. I also found the rock shapes with blunt or flat shaped noses (such as trapezoid and rectangle shaped rocks) were effective at creating trout habitat. Rocks that had hydrodynamic shapes, such as the rhombus (diamond) and circle shaped rocks were not as effective at creating trout habitat. <br><br>My research shows that rock shape plays a significant role in trout habitat. Resource managers can use this information to produce more trout habitat at less cost.<br><br>

THE TOXIGENIC EFFICACY OF HYDROPHOBIN-3 PROTEIN OF BEAUVERIA BASSIANA AGAINST INSECT MANDUCA SEXTA
Sonia Vikram Shah
Lecanto High School, Lecanto, Florida, USA

Due to the non-selective toxicity of chemical pesticides, natural pesticides have gained interest for commercial use in agriculture. Beauveria bassiana, an entomopathogenic fungus, is currently being developed as a bio-control agent for a variety of insect pests. The fungus produces hydrophobin-3, a novel protein secreted by the fungus that is responsible for aiding B. bassiana in infecting and penetrating through its host. Recent discoveries suggest that hydrophobin-3 may also act as a direct source of toxins in the fungus. The objective of this project was to purify hydrophobin-3 and test its toxigenic efficacy by injecting it into Manduca sexta. <br><br> The protein gene with His-tag was amplified using PCR and cloned into pET 151 vector. The recombinant vectors were transformed into E. coli and gel electrophoresis was used to verify the transformation. French press and protein assay were conducted. Nickel-column purification and Hydrophobic-interaction chromatography were used to purify hydrophobin-3. 20µL of purified protein was injected into 9 Manduca sextas during the 5th instar larva stage, and Ringer’s solution was injected into an additional 5 caterpillars as the control. 78% of the experimental Manduca sextas died within a 6-day period and the remaining 22% did not metamorphosize into moths after the 25-day period. The control Manduca sextas did not exhibit effects. <br><br> Based on the high mortality of the experimental insects, the data confirms that hydrophobin-3 is a novel insecticidal protein of Beauveria bassiana. The effects of hydrophobin-3 indicate a direct toxicity of this protein rather than an indirect damage due to the physio-chemical (hydrophobic-hydrophilic) properties of the molecule. Thus, hydrophobin-3 has great potential to be developed commercially as a protein-based, environmentally friendly pesticide as an alternative to chemical pesticides.<br><br>

REMEDIATION OF MERCURY CONTAMINATED WATERWAYS USING CRAWFISH SHELLS PHASE II
Cherise Marie Steib
St. James Parish Magnet School, St.James, LA U.S.A.

<br><br>Levels of mercury (Hg) uptake in pulverized (<0.063 mm2) crawfish shells (Procambarus clarkii), crab shells (Callinectes sapidus), and shells from live molting crawfish (Procambarus clarkii) placed in water containing Hg concentrations of 10.0 ng/mL were determined using a Bacharach Coleman Model 50B Mercury analyzer system employing Cold Vapor Atomic Absorption Spectrometry. Crawfish shells and crab shells were pulverized and passed through a U.S. Standard Sieve (0.063 mm2). One hundred milliliters of de-ionized (DI) water were placed in 125 mL HDPE bottles containing 10.0 ng/mL Hg. Amounts of approximately 0.1 g, 0.2 g, 0.3 g, 0.4 g, and 0.5 g of each type of pulverized shell were placed into separate 125 ml Hg-spiked HDPE bottles, sealed, and allowed to remain undisturbed under a fume hood for 2 days. Five molting crawfish were placed in each of three 10 gallon aquaria containing 1900 mL of DI water containing 10.0 ng/mL Hg and remained undisturbed for five days. The aquaria were sealed under a fume hood and attached to a Hg scrubber system containing a 1.0 M Na2CO3 solution. Water samples were digested and analyzed using USEPA Method 7470A before and after each experiment and shell samples were digested and analyzed using USEPA Method 7471A before and after each experiment. Results of the pulverized shell experiment indicate that crawfish shells absorb Hg at a higher rate than crab shells and an exact absorption rate is still being tabulated. Data from the molting crawfish experiment is still being analyzed.

FEASIBILITY AND RECYCLING OF CHICKEN FEATHERS INTO PAPER PRODUCTS
Kulsum Bilal
Govt. Kinnaird High School for Girls, Lahore, Pakistan

The sustainable social development of any society closely relates to the management of natural resources. Recycling is one of the useful techniques to conserve energy resources as long as possible.<br><br>An attempt has been made to manufacture paper from chicken feathers at a domestic level. Manuafctured card paper was then checked for its basic physical and absorption properties and then results were compared with papers available in the local market.<br><br>The basic physical properties, like thickness, apparent density and moisture content, were found to be better in factory manufactured paper, which has already undergone mechanical sizing processes.<br><br>However, these properties can be enhanced in chicken paper products by using current mechanical and chemical processes. Both chicken and factory papers showed almost same absorption properties which indicates the possibility of formation of good quality paper from downed feathers of chicken.<br><br>The feasibility report showed that 0.7 billion kg paper can be produced from chicken feathers, which can help in reducing the load of import and in saving trees. Another big advantage of using chicken feathers is that no large amount of bleaching chemicals are required to make paper white. Chicken feather paper formed stays off-white, hence more environmental friendly as they do not leave any hazardous bleaching chemicals in teh environment.

COMPARISON OF THE PHYTODEGRADATION OF TRICHLOROETHYLENE USING SALIX NIGRA AND SALIX CAROLINIANA
Meredith Celeste Boulos
Episcopal High School, Jacksonville Florida, United States of America

Due to improper disposal of manufacturing companies, trichloroethylene, a hazardous carcinogen, is often introduced to the groundwater in an area. As opposed to the standard contaminant removal processes, which are costly and laborious, there is an alternate method, phytoremediation. One of the subcategories of phytoremediation is phytodegradation. This process involves the uptake of a chemical through the roots of a plant, and the break down of that chemical by the plant’s enzymes. Two plants which are capable of carrying out phytodegradation are the Salix nigra and the Salix caroliniana. In order to compare the effectiveness of these two willows for the phytodegradation of trichloroethylene, an experiment was set up using large, glass, leak proof and air tight bottles that contained 5 cuttings each. The bottles contained a 5ppm concentration of trichloroethylene, 21mg/L sodium bicarbonate for carbon dioxide supply, water, and 5mls methanol. Periodically throughout the study, samples were taken from the bottles and analyzed using a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer. The concentration of trichloroethylene was calculated using the slope of the standard curve and the peak area of the sample. Due to the larger root system, more rapid growth rate, and the larger span of pH tolerance of the Salix Nigra, it was predicted that this willow would more effectively phytodegrade trichloroethylene. After experimentation was completed, there was a 28.6% decrease of TCE using the Salix nigra, and a 50.2% decrease using the Salix caroliniana. The hypothesis was not supported by the results. <br><br><br><br><br><br>

A COMPARISON OF THE FRESHWATER FISHES IN THE DIFFERENT PHYSIOGRAPHIC PROVINCES AND DRAINAGES OF NC, VA, AND WV.
Laura Lynn Lee
Mirkwood High School, Charlotte NC, Mecklenburg

This project compares distributions of freshwater fishes in West Virginia, Virginia, and North Carolina. The purpose of this comparison is to create baseline indices of the different species of fishes within certain drainages and physiographic provinces. This information can be helpful because fish are a food source, fish can help indicate pollution and affects global warming, etc. The hypotheses for this project are one, the total number of different species of fishes vary with drainage areas and physiographic provinces. Also 2, that the number of species of fishes varies within different families, i.e. trouts, minnows, suckers, sunfishes, and darters. And 3, species variety varies between areas. These indices compare the total number of species with the total number of individuals. To do this experiment, detailed fish distribution maps were used by tracing the fish sample points and then counting them to get a number for each drainage and physiographic province for every species. Then computer programs, such as Excel and PC-Ord, were used to create graphs to analyze the data. In the end, the hypotheses were correct. First, the total number of species varied between areas. For example, the Ohio Drainage had the most species and Coastal Plain had the lowest. Species variety also varied by drainage and physiographic provinces. Also as the ordination test showed, drainages and physiographic provinces varied in similarity. Additionally, families/groups of fishes varied by drainages and provinces. Continuing this project, the next step would be to add South Carolina to the comparison.

TURNING WASTE TO GOLD: SUBSTIUTION OF SYNTHETIC BINDERS WITH RECYCLED BIOPOLYMERS IN LARGE SCALE EROSION CONTROL
Dhanur Damodar
Dupont Manual High School, Louisville Kentucky, United States

Soil erosion is a serious global problem, with over 70 million hectares of topsoil lost annually. Currently, synthetic binders, such as Polyacrylamide or PAM, are used to control erosion. PAM is an effective soil binder, but with high prices and negative consequences to the environment. This study is focused on substituting PAM with a biopolymer extracted from waste. Chitosan, extracted from chitin (makes up the exoskeleton of crustaceans), was the binder used in this experiment. 5 lb shells are thrown away/1 lb meat packaged: a huge waste. Previous experiments indicated effectiveness of chitosan as a flocculant in lab scale tests. Extraction yields at 27% were not commercially viable. In this study, a significantly improved extraction method for chitosan has been developed for better yield and performance. Standard lab tests for binder performance such as settling tank tests and water dispersion tests showed that the new extract of Chitosan was superior to the previous samples. In new field studies, a tensile strength test, a dirt plug test, and a breakthrough rainfall simulation test were administered, clearly demonstrating that Chitosan was superior to PAM in adhering to fine soil. The results demonstrate the potential for large-scale field use of chitosan. The other major breakthrough was in the extraction yield of 75%, thus paving the way for commercial applications. Additionally, cost of chitosan was calculated as 44 c/lb versus $3-5/lb for PAM, a huge price difference.

SUBMERGED AQUATIC VEGETATION: WHICH SHOULD BE RESTORED?
Emily Elizabeth Gore
LaPlata High School, LaPlata MD, The United States of America

The purpose of this experiment was to determine which of the tested Submerged Aquatic Vegetation species in the Chesapeake Bay produces the most oxygen. The tested plants included Eelgrass, Widgeon Grass, and Redhead grass; Widgeon grass was hypothesized to generate the largest amount of oxygen due to its abundance in many still flourishing Bay areas. <br><br> Four, five gallon tanks were supplied with Mesohaline Bay water, soil, three ghost shrimp, two feeder snails, one blue crab, and six of the assigned plants (Tank A was the control.) The organisms were fed a carefully constructed, high protein diet and allowed to carry out typical lives for two weeks. After two weeks the level of dissolved oxygen was found through titration. This procedure was repeated for three more two week trials with an entirely new set of organisms and clean tanks. <br><br> The averaged results demonstrate that Eelgrass produced the most oxygen (4.78 ppm), followed by Widgeon grass (4.67 ppm), Redhead grass (3.84 ppm), and the control (3.84.) Eelgrass was not destroyed by the organisms and widgeon grass was only slightly uprooted; however the Redhead grass was completely destroyed in every trial. This data does not represent the quantity of oxygen produced, but rather that certain plants produced more oxygen to sustain the original level (8-10ppm.) These results could be practically applied to the actual reintroduction by scientists of plants into the Bay. These plants are crucial to the entire ecosystem, however declining at a rapid rate along with the oxygen they produce.<br><br> <br><br>

TRACKING AND PREVENTING THE OPHIOSTOMA FUNGUS OF THE MOUNTAIN PINE BARK BEETLE
Anika Rose Petach
Fairview High School, Boulder CO, USA

This study focused on the distribution and inhibition of the symbiotic blue-stain fungus Ophiostoma as a means to combat the recent mountain pine bark beetle epidemic in Colorado. The initial study was to track the growth of Ophiostoma in lodgepole pine trees at different elevations and determine where Ophiostoma growth becomes limited. The observation that beetle-infected trees in Grand County, Colorado, above 10,000 feet in elevation exhibited much slower Ophiostoma growth than trees at 9000 feet in elevation suggested that perhaps the Ophiostoma growth could be inhibited and thus the beetle infestation could be controlled.<br><br> Ophiostoma was cultured in malt agar to provide a controlled study environment. Growth curves of the fungus were measured for different growth temperatures and for different antifungals (garlic, copper sulfate, black walnut extract, tea tree oil, thyme oil) applied to the malt agar. Viability studies for the spores were carried out to determine whether spores were also killed. Growth was measured by area measurements on the agar plate. Spore viability was studied by attempting to subculture the spores onto new agar plates. Ophiostoma growth was inhibited by low temperatures and by application of the herbal antifungal, thyme oil. Spores were not viable following treatment with thyme oil.<br><br> Since Ophiostoma growth could be inhibited by using a natural herb applied to the growth medium, perhaps Ophiostoma growth, and thus pine bark beetle, could also be inhibited in lodgepole pine trees treated with thyme oil, rather than a toxic insecticide. <br><br>

RECYCLED GLASS FILTERS EFFECTIVENESS OF RECYCLED GLASS AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR SAND IN BIOFILTRATION SYSTEM
Jonathan Edward Effgen
Sayre School, Lexington KY, USA

Sand filters promoting biotic growth have been used for centuries to purify water, while being porous enough to allow water to pass through at a stable rate. The use of recycled glass as a substitute for sand would generate cost savings of 80% and provide a use for recycled glass not currently being recycled. The purpose of this project was to compare the quality of water output using sand and recycled glass filters.<br><br> Controlled experiments were conducted using six filtration columns, three each of sand and crushed recycled glass. Each column was constructed to meet the EPA’s minimum requirement for 24 inch depth for sand filters. Controlled, contaminated samples of water were prepared consisting of vitamin enriched, food waste contaminated, and pH altered water. The contaminated water was run through the filtration columns. The outputs were compared for flow rates and residual contamination levels. <br><br> This investigation yielded the following results: <br><br> Both systems equally reduced pH levels;<br><br> Both systems reduced Ca and Mg content from 450 ppm to 120 ppm;<br><br> Both systems reduced Fe content from 30mg/l to 4 mg/l;<br><br> Filtration rate for the glass filter out performed the sand filter.<br><br> The matched filtering performance of both systems demonstrates that the crushed glass filtration system can be used as an alternate choice to the sand system. Recycled crushed glass filters offers the potential for cost saving and life cycle performance due to improved flow characteristics. This could lead to more sustainable methods of filtering water in developed and developing nations.

WHAT A DUMP! SOME EFFECTS OF LEACHATE RECIRCULATION ON LANDFILL CELLS
Katie Lynn Thompson
St. Clair High School, St. Clair, Minnesota, United States

The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether or not waste water can be recirculated through landfill cells to increase the rate of the decomposition of the waste in order to conserve space and how such recirculation will impact the quality of the water being used. To test the hypothesis that the recirculation of leachate through a landfill cell will increase the rate at which the waste in it decomposes, and after an initial decline, the quality of the water being used will improve steadily, four model landfill cells were built to scale by mass. Water was recirculated through three of the models at varying times, leaving one tank dry as a control, and pH, total alkalinity, nitrate, nitrite, total chlorine, heavy metals, iron, copper, and turbidity were monitored. <br><br> Although this study did not provide very much conclusive evidence regarding the long-term effects that recirculation of leachate could potentially have on the quality of the water being used, it did prove that such recirculation can help conserve landfill space by increasing the rate of decomposition within a landfill cell.

USE OF THE EXTRACTION TECHNIQUE ON CINNAMOMUM CAMPHORA LEAVES TO OBTAIN A NATURAL INSECTICIDE CAPABLE OF CONTROLLING AND REDUCING THE GROWTH OF NASUTITERMES COSTALIS COLONIES
Lorianny Rivera - Mendoza
Colegio Maria Auxiliadora, Carolina, Puerto Rico

Mangroves are an essential part of the ecosystem; they provide a great amount of Oxygen and because of this, their conservation is important. Mangroves in Puerto Rico have been affected by the growth of Nasutitermes costalis colonies on their branches. This research intends to find a natural way of eliminating the termite colonies so that the quality of the Rhizophora mangle won’t be affected as well as the health of other organisms.<br><br> An extract of the leaves of Cinnamomun camphora was made. The red mangrove of Playa Azul Luquillo (PR) was visited and divided into ten sites. In each site, environmental parameters (temperature, pH, salinity, turbidity and conductivity) were measured; the amount of braches affected by termites was counted and also, the termite colonies were counted and its sizes were measured. The extract was sprinkled ten times around the colonies of termites located in stations 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9. The colonies in the other stations were left intact. A visit was made every two weeks for eight months to repeat the steps mentioned above. A gas-liquid chromatography was performed on the extract to identify its components.<br><br> Results showed that the extract of Cinnamomum camphora was effective; it was capable of reducing the size of the termite colonies and in some stations, the colonies disappeared completely. No other organisms were affected by the extract and the environmental parameters of the mangrove improved. The extract contained “camphor” which is known to eliminate moth by asphyxiating it without damaging anything else.<br><br>

A UNIT TO DECREASE THE POLLUTION CAUSED BY CHIMNEYS
Layan Mazen Kazem Kutob
Modern Montessori School, Amman, JORDAN

Abstract<br><br>Houses’ chimneys contribute in increasing pollution levels, acid rain and global warming. Literature shows that although some filter companies have tried to find solutions to neutralize the gases, but no one has ever came up with a solution for the houses’ chimneys.<br><br>The task is to find a solution by forming a unit that minimizes the pollution created by chimneys. To achieve this, the research investigates the acidity of the gases produced by chimneys; the amount of the base required to neutralize this acid; and the processes by which the percentage of the acidic gases and particulates could be minimized. The research hypothesizes that the moles of the acidic gases released for a certain period of time can be found by pumping them in distilled water and titrating them against a base (NaOH). Afterwards the amount of the base (CaO) that neutralizes all acidic gases is found. Building upon this, gas samples were collected from the chimney, to find its mass, volume and acidity. Titration was done to find the volume of (NaOH) needed in order to neutralize the acid. Then normal stoichiometric calculations were done to find the moles of the acid in the water, and then the amount of (CaO) needed to be put in the unit.<br><br>Based on the data collected, the unit was designed. It was made up of a metallic sixty centimeter diameter cylinder of eight consecutive layers to hold the needed chemicals. In addition, water pipes and water pump were added to control the humidity level and to prevent (CaO) from being lost. Other factors including gas movement and back drifting were considered.<br><br>After attaching the unit to the chimney and repeating the experiments, it was concluded that it successfully decreased the pollution by 94%.<br><br>

GREEN BUILDINGS
Emmanuel Jose Amundaray
Colegio Marista, Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, United States of America

This research proves that green buildings decrease the temperature inside the buildings, even more than those with black or white roofs.<br><br> Three rectangular architectural scale models were constructed in wood. The area of each building model was 420 cm2 (30 cm x 14 cm) and a height of 16 cm. The roofs of the three edifications were flat; two of them were painted: one black and one white. The third building had top soil and arachis pintoi planted on the roof representing green buildings.<br><br> In a period of 27 days, the inside and outside temperatures were recorded for the total of seven times (approximately every 4th day). The data revealed that the difference media in temperature between the interior and exterior of the black model building was 3 degree Celsius higher inside, the difference in the white roof building model was 0.29 degree Celsius higher inside, and the difference in the green roof model was 1.57 degree Celsius lower inside than outside. <br><br> This study revealed that the green building model maintained 4.43 degree Celsius lower inside temperature than the black roof model building and 1.72 degree Celsius than the white roof building. This decreasing temperature using the green roof means a significant contribution to the problem of global warming. Plants in our roof tops will reduce the consumption of energy inside a building, will increase production of oxygen (O2) outside the building, and will reduce the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, therefore, serve as air purifiers and contribute to our environment.<br><br>

"BOARDS AND BRANCHES - YEAR 6" A MULTIVARIATE STUDY OF IMPACTS OF SNOW FENCES ON WATER CONSERVATION FOR RECLAMATION
Erica Elizabeth David
Pinedale High School, Pinedale, Wyoming, USA

What are impacts of snow fences on water conservation for reclamation? Reclamation of disturbed areas is a vital component of natural resource development. However, water supply is critical for vegetation success. The long-term objective of “Boards and Branches” is to develop guidelines for the most effective snow fence system for water conservation in reclamation. <br><br> The previously studied Hollow Frame Fences and new Snow Snake Fences were installed on reclamation sites. Analysis of Winter/Spring Phases included snow drift characteristics, soil moisture patterns, and wildlife observations. <br><br> Hollow Frame Fences created shorter length, higher volume, higher density drifts than Single Snow Snakes, supporting Hypothesis 1A. Intensive Snow Snake Systems created higher volume snowpack, yet Dispersed Snow Snake Systems had higher density drifts, supporting part of 1B. Intensive Snow Snake System drifts receded more slowly, supporting part of 1C, however Dispersed Snow Snake System drifts receded more slowly than Hollow Frame Fence System drifts, not supporting the remainder of 1C. Windward fences resulted in shorter length, higher volume, higher density drifts than leeward fences, not supporting 2A. Soil moisture decreased during subzero temperatures, not supporting 3B. During thawing periods, shallower, lower density areas melted more quickly, and resultant soil moisture increased more quickly, supporting 4A. Substantial wildlife presence supported 7A. April data will relate to additional soil moisture hypotheses.<br><br> The current results indicate Intensive Snow Snake Systems as the most effective approach to retain windblown snow.<br><br> “Boards and Branches” will provide reclamation specialists with tools to manipulate snow for maximum water conservation for reclamation.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF INVASIVE MOSQUITOFISH (GAMBUSIA HOLBROOKI) AND NATIVE BANDED KILLIFISH (FUNDULUS DIAPHANUS) ON MACROINVERTEBRATES AND MOSQUITO LARVAE
Alana Rose Tornello
Staten Island Technical High School, New York City, NY, U.S.A

Gambusia holbrooki, commonly called “mosquitofish”, is an invasive fish species used to efficiently control populations of mosquito larvae. Although mosquitofish became the popular natural alternative after the West Nile Virus outbreaks, ecologists speculate that their rapid reproduction causes excessive consumption of native prey and harmful competition with native predators, thereby disrupting ecosystems. This study investigates the effects of mosquitofish on freshwater ecosystems on Staten Island, NY. The hypothesis proposes that mosquitofish prey heavily on native mosquito larvae and native macro-invertebrates, the largest, most varied group of aquatic macro-organisms. It also proposes that the Banded Killifish (Fundulus diaphanus), a native predator, is as effective in mosquito control as mosquitofish. Experiments were performed using locally collected species whose predation behaviors were observed daily, recorded, and then returned to their original habitats. In the first trial, five adult, female mosquitofish were observed with mosquito larvae in one aquarium while the same experiment (with constant variables) was performed on Killifish in a second aquarium. In the second trial, the mosquitofish were observed with native macroinvertebrates (Killifish were not observed because macroinvertebrates are their natural prey). The results showed that mosquitofish do prey heavily on macro-invertebrates (84.5% consumption). Mosquito larvae consumption by mosquitofish was found to be very similar to Banded Killifish, supporting the use of Killifish as the native alternative. Both findings support the hypothesis and encourage further studies of Gambusia holbrooki and their disruption of ecosystems. This study presents a problem to the scientific community and general public while also proposing a solution.

MIRACLE BIOPLASTICS FROM CELLULOSE WASTE
Chan Ka Kin 
Hong Kong Chinese Women's Club College, Hong Kong

The conventional plastics from petroleum cause lots of environmental problems. In addition, the natural resources, cellulose in plants and sawdust, are wasted every day because of the affluent lifestyles. Now, it is possible to transform those wastes into useful bioplastics by a green way.<br><br>Bioplastics are made from biopolymers like starch, gelatin and cellulose. Cellulose wastes such as sawdust and withered leaves are oxidized to derivatized polysaccharide and then are successfully made into bioplastics. <br><br>Tests and investigations were carried out to compare the properties of bioplastics (including tensile strength, water resistance and microwave heating resistance). One of them can even withstand a weight of more than 4000g (in 9cm2) and it is surprising that some of the bioplastics can withstand high power microwave heating for more than one minute. Mixing of different biopolymers gives mixed properties to the bioplastics. <br><br>Making bioplastics from cellulose wastes is indeed a great step in adopting a green lifestyle. We make no bones about that some of our synthesized bioplastics are applicable to our daily lives. It is a breakthrough that can be used in different kinds of packaging such as packaging in electrical appliances, plastic bags and protective films.<br><br>

EMMA: DETERMINING THE EFFECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTERS ON ECOSYSTEMS
Elisabeth Ann Baseman
Brewster High School, Brewster, NY, USA

Although the frequency and intensity of environmental disasters have been steadily increasing, specific data regarding effects of these disasters on ecosystems is rare. Organizations concerned with preservation of ecosystems in areas threatened by disasters need a way to qualitatively predict how their area will be affected and what management strategies are needed to conserve the ecosystem.<br><br> This study introduces EMMA (Ecological Model for Management Analysis), an original ecosystem model developed from Lotka-Volterra equations, including carrying capacity, Type II predator functional response and disaster simulation capabilities, as a discrete time simulation within Microsoft Excel. For qualitative stability analysis, the system is shifted to center on the origin and linearized. Eigenvalues are used as indicators of stability. Eigenvalue predictions are accurate in most cases, and carrying capacity is determined to be an important factor in ecosystem stability.<br><br> Analysis of EMMA implies a threshold value for carrying capacity, above which the ecosystem destabilizes. Continuing research includes determining this threshold.<br><br> General EMMA dynamics suggest that ecosystems threatened with a disaster that lowers carrying capacity (wildfires, drought, etc.) do not necessarily require management, as low carrying capacity can help to stabilize the ecosystem. However, management is needed if a disaster threatens to increase carrying capacity (floods for aquatic species, destruction of nearby city, etc.), because high carrying capacity can cause instability. Six hypothetical case studies demonstrating possible uses of EMMA are presented, including applications to nuclear waste disposal and city planning. Findings are confirmed by data obtained from researchers in the field.

THE NATURAL WAY: EFFECTS OF TYPHA LATIFOLIA ON CONTAMINATED FRESHWATER SYSTEMS
Megan Kristine Bartholomew
Central Lee High School, Donnellson IA, USA

Tests were conducted to see if there was a natural way to remove oil from contaminated freshwater systems. Typha latifolia were planted and established before introducing oil to the system. Plants were allowed to grow in the contaminated water for 35 days. At the end of the test period results were taken on many aspects of the plants and their environment. Water and soil were tested to see how much oil remained after 35 days. Plants were also examined to see if there were any changes in their appearance, growth, cell structure, and roots.<br><br> It was determined that Typha latifolia could remove oil from a freshwater system. On average one plant could remove about 93 parts per million of oil. It was also concluded that as the initial amount of oil increased, the amount of oil removed decreased. There were no visible changes in the outward appearance of the plants nor did the oil seem to inhibit growth. However, the area of the cells decreased as amounts of oil increased. The oil did not seem to have an effect on the plant's life span.

Burning petroleum oil has been posing a threat on the environment. Many of its emissions decay the ozone and damage the environment. Petrol, also, is a nonrenewable resource and it will get depleted at a time. <br><br>Biodiesel is a domestically produced, renewable fuel that can be manufactured from vegetable oils, animal fats, or recycled restaurant greases. Biodiesel is safe, biodegradable, and reduces serious air pollutants. Because little fossil energy is required to move biodiesel, it is a substitute for traditional petroleum diesel, and special pumps for fueling are not needed. And so, the renewable fuel can directly replace petroleum products. <br><br>-One liter of soybean oil is heated to at least 120 °C to remove all water, <br><br>and then it is cooled.<br><br>-While the oil is cooling, methanol and NaOH (lye) are mixed to form the methoxide. <br><br>-When the Oil's temperature drops to 60 °C, the liter of oil is poured into a bottle.<br><br>- The methoxide is poured on top of the oil using the same funnel. <br><br> the top is screwed down onto the bottle.<br><br> -10 minutes after shaking, the by-product (commonly referred to as glycerin) starts to settle out and form an increasing layer at the bottom of the bottle.<br><br>

THE URBAN HEAT ISLAND EFFECT YEAR 2
Trevis Jared Matheus
Yerington High School, Yerington Nevada, USA

Last year I determined that there was a statistically significant difference between the temperatures inside of a small city and outside of that same city, disproving my null hypothesis. My research was unique as the first examination of the Urban Heat Island Effect (UHI) in a city with a population of less than 20,000. My results led me to question of how I could locate and identify the sources of the temperature difference. I hypothesized that the temperature difference is due to materials in the city that absorb and radiate more heat than the materials outside the city. Using a lab setting, I analyzed several common building materials as well as sand and soil samples from outside my city. As I worked to perfect my test protocols, I also continued my literature search. As a result, I found that the question I was researching, about materials, had already been answered. That left me to work on a method for identifying the location of these heat sources within the city. I began with the idea of creating a mathematical formula that would generate a predicted value for the temperature difference, but chose instead to develop a computer model of the city and the changing temperatures over time; a visual display of the "hot spots". This model allows city managers to quickly locate areas that require mitigation to reduce the UHI of their city.

A DESCRIPTIVE STUDY OF LICHEN COLONIZATION OF STONE MONUMENTS IN A COOPER COUNTY MISSOURI CEMETERY
Samantha Grace Hennenfent
Fort Zumwalt West High School, O'Fallon, Missouri, United States of America

Biodeterioration of monuments by lichens is a known problem, but techniques are limited in the prevention of lichen growth on stone. The study conducted included determining the types of stone substrates, which substrate had the greatest percentage of lichen coverage, the relationship between stone monument age and lichen colonization and lichen substrate preference. Stones were sampled at random from each of eight 25 year time periods from 1800 - present. A photograph was taken, the date of death and substrate type was recorded and the percentage of lichen coverage was determined. Microscopic photographs to identify lichens were taken using Proscope. There were six different substrates in this study. Limestone was the preferred substrate at 75% colonization followed by concrete at 68% colonization and unpolished marble at 43% colonization. The polished substrates had little or no lichen colonization. The oldest stones in the cemetery had 100% lichen colonization. The relationship continued in a linear decline until 1875-1900, where a drastic drop in colonization occurred. It was in this period that a railroad was being built, a flood occurred and new trees were planted. In the period following the lichen colonization rate rose 25.1 % to 69.8% that is close to the rate prior to the decline. There was seven lichen species identified in the cemetery: X. fulva, P. hirsute, X. mendozae, P. chloantha, P. rudecta, P. subtilis, P.decolor. Limestone monuments and the unpolished marble had greater diversity. This is understandable since both have high calcium content, which is desired by lichens.

BIOREMEDIATION OF LEAD CONTAMINATED SOIL
Brittany Daniels
Ogden High School, Ogden, Utah U.S.A.

Lead contamination is a large problem in the state of Utah. In the late eighteen hundreds there were mines all over the state that processed lead and silver, now there are large contaminated sites all over Utah. The purpose of this project was to find a plant that can assist in the remediation of lead contaminated soil. The soil was scanned with an X-ray Fluorescent machine (XRF) to find the average level of contamination. Runner beans, spinach, and mustard were planted in contaminated and non contaminated soil. After the plants had grown each sample was scanned again with the XRF machine to see how much lead was left in each section. The hypothesis for this project was that the runner beans would bioremediate the soil more efficiently because they are a bigger plant and it was thought that they would need to uptake more of everything to sufficiently sustain the plant. The baseline of contamination for all samples was 4822 mg/kg. After plant growth soil levels were scanned. The results showed that the lead had reduced in all samples; the amount of contamination left in the runner bean soil was 2740 mg/kg, in the spinach soil 2640 mg/kg, and in the mustard soil 3430 mg/kg.

ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR PESTICIDES
Nikhita Singh
A.B. Lucas Secondary School, London, Ontario, Canada

Pesticide run-off and accumulation in soils have serious environmental and health implications. This project is an investigation into factors affecting run-off from leaves. It examines ways into maximizing efficiency of pesticide use. Fifty leaf surfaces were studied under a microscope using SEM images. Three different surface types influencing run-off were identified: leaves with hairs, leaves with ridges, and leaves with bumps. Quantitative measures of hairs, ridges, and bumps were made and extremes among each group were selected for further investigation. Manufactured products were selected after quantitative measurements to simulate leaf surfaces, such as industrial velcro to simulate leaves with hairs. These served as controls. Validity of the simulations was achieved by comparing run-off between actual leaves and the corresponding artificial model. Experiments to study factors affecting run-off were conducted on leaf surfaces and corresponding controls. Use of surfactants proved to be the most effective method to control run-off. Experiments were repeated with various types of surfactant in different concentrations. Results suggested that low concentrations of non-ionic surfactants and polymers were optimal in reducing run-off. The effect of particle size was examined using spray nozzles of different diameters. Large increases in run-off were observed with the use of large diameter nozzles. The use of multiple applications or a single application, using the same volume, did not affect run-off quantities. Run-off increased proportionately with the angle of the leaf. This project demonstrates that run-off can be controlled for all types of leaf surfaces. Reductions of 80% are achievable.<br><br>

DEVELOPMENT AND CHARACTERIZATION OF A PORTABLE SAWDUST COOKING STOVE
Siti Sarah Zainal Alimuddin
MARA Junior Science College, Langkawi, Kedah, Malaysia.

Fossil fuels will face depletion in the near future and it is incumbent upon us to find alternative forms of energy for the future generation. Among the various kinds of alternative fuel available, biomass is one of the most potential sources of energy. Sawdust is abundantly available as waste material that is generally burnt or discarded and cause environmental concern. The sawdust can be converted into a useful form of energy. In this study, the sawdust was used in a stove to provide heat for household cooking activities particularly in the rural areas. The sawdust biomass stove was easily fabricated from two used tin cans of different sizes. The stove utilizes a gasification principle which converts solid fuel into gaseous fuel that was immediately burnt to provide heat. Several parameters affecting the performance of the stove were identified. They were packing densities, aspect ratios (height/diameter) of air passage, different types of biomass used and particle sizes. The sawdust was obtained from a nearby furniture industry that uses rubber wood. The thermal output increases with the increasing particle sizes and packing densities but decreases with increasing aspect ratios. The amount of sawdust used was 150g producing heat for a period of 30 minutes. The remaining waste was char and ash amounting to about 70g. The efficiency of the stove was found to be 53% with a thermal power output of 0.58kW. The optimum values were: packing density 300kg/m3, the aspect ratio 2.3, the particle size 600micron. <br><br>

SUSTAINABLE SOLAR WATER GENERATOR
Kerrick Robert Dando
Franklin Regional High School 3200 School Road, Murrysville, PA 15668

The availability of safe supplies of drinking water is a global concern of escalating importance owing to the cumulative affects of pollution, water-borne disease and geographic limitations on our water supplies. An additional concern is the local availability of fresh water, particularly in remote areas where there is no access to fresh water or conventional electrical power. Solar powered sustainable, condensation-based water generators could be a viable technology for addressing these needs.<br><br> A sustainable solar powered water generator was constructed from a Peltier cooler, finned heating and cooling plates, a fan, a 12-volt battery and a 40 watt photovoltaic (PV) solar panel. Repeated outdoor tests of the system were performed to prove that the water generator was capable of collecting water from the atmosphere a rate of 7 ml/hour. The impacts of operating and environmental variables were defined to optimize system efficiency. Improved system performance (20% efficiency gain over 4 hours of water collection) was achieved by operating the system when dew point approaches ambient temperature. The power demand of the Peltier cooler and battery charging performance of a 40-watt PV solar panel were evaluated to show that the water generator could be operated for three hours and the battery would be completely re-charged in a single day of full solar exposure using a single 40-watt PV solar panel. A total of 80 watts of solar panel power would be required for assuring sustainable system performance over a wide range of solar exposure conditions.<br><br>

AN ASSAY OF THE AGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL EFFECTS ON THE HUDSON BAY WATERSHED
Krissandra Genevieve Jentz
Hankinson High School, Hankinson ND, USA

PURPOSE: To analyze the water quality of two rivers in southeastern North Dakota through testing for various parameters and bacterial content. Also, to determine the effectiveness at promoting the growth of useful bacteria. Analyze mud from the river bottoms for macronutrient content. Lastly, to determine two aquatic plants’ ability to purify two industries’ waste waters as well as the river locations. <br><br>PROCEDURES: Water Analysis: Collected weekly water samples from four different river locations for a ten week period, and determined the amounts of carbon dioxide, dissolved oxygen, alkalinity, total hardness, ammonia, iron, sulfate, lead, nitrate, phosphate, pH, and conductivity through various testing methods. <br><br>Bacterial Colonization: Impregnated EMB agar plates with the samples and observed the bacterial growth. Coliscan: Identified the presence and number of coliform bacteria in the water implementing the use of Coliscan Easygel kits. <br><br>Beneficial Bacteria Study: Determined the water’s capability of maintaining beneficial bacteria. <br><br>Soil Analysis: Determined the macronutrient content of the soil on the river bottom. <br><br>Contaminated Water Analysis: Analyzed the ability of aquatic plants to purify two factories’ waste waters and two river locations.<br><br>CONCLUSION: Some of the chemical and microbiological contaminates were elevated in agricultural areas; these areas did not promote the growth of beneficial bacteria as much as the industrial areas. Overall, I feel that agriculture does affect river water quality more than industries, and that aquatic plants can be used as a natural, more environmentally friendly way to purify water.<br><br>

A COMPARISON OF THE FLAMMABILITY OF SOUTHWESTERN OREGON WOODY PLANTS AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ZEOLITE AS A FIRE RETARDANT
Laurie Lea Fletcher
Curry Science Academy, Brookings, OR, USA

In southwestern Oregon, there has been little testing on determining the flammability of local woody plants. It would be very beneficial to rural homeowners and forest managers to know which trees would make good firebreaks. This could help firefighters in protecting houses and promote native species to be used for landscaping. The goal of my project is to compare the flammability of local trees and test the effectiveness of zeolite and Class A firefighting foam on each species. Variations in the flammability of plant species can be measured in various ways. For my project, I measured the time to ignition and percent combustion to compare flammability. Foliar moisture content was determined for each species tested. <br><br>Branch flammability tests were repeated with branches that had been sprayed with a commercial Class A firefighting foam or a zeolite slurry. There are numerous commercial fire retardants available to help plants absorb more water so as to reduce their risk of igniting when a fire is approaching. Zeolite, a naturally occurring volcanic mineral, has potential desirable fireproofing qualities. These include emitting water when heated, not breaking down, and being nontoxic. I hypothesize that zeolite will be an effective fire retardant in this application. I also believe that conifers will be more flammable than hardwoods because of their high surface area to volume ratio and chemical content.

THE USE OF NATURAL SECONDARY METABOLITES TO ABSORB THE GREENHOUSE GAS CARBON DIOXIDE 
Jongwoo Joseph Park
Sheldon High School, Eugene, Oregon, United States

Global warming is largely related to the concentrations of greenhouse gases in our air. The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a way to connect the natural CO2/O2 exchange of plant respiration to the absorption of CO2 gas, one of the major global warming gases. Currently, an artificial amine absorbent, composed of a synthetic “essential oil” and amine group, is used for CO2 removal. However, this method is not ideal because it is expensive and creates a byproduct that is not environmentally friendly. This study proposes that an amine absorbent can be made naturally from conifer pine needles, and would accomplish the same function as the existing artificial amine absorbent. Oregon conifers, including Douglas-Fir and Western Red-cedar, were collected, and their essential oils were extracted through distillation. The extracts were mixed with NH4OH to create an amine complex, which was tested for CO2 absorption efficiency in a gas lift column. The results of experiment show that both Douglas-Fir and Western Red-cedar extract successfully absorb CO2 gas.

DESMOSTACHYA BIPINNATA AS AN ECO-FRIENDLY TERMICIDE
Vaishnavi Viswanathan
Modern English School, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India

This project evaluates the anti-termitic properties of Desmostachya bipinnata, a plant native to India. In the traditional Indian medical system (Ayurveda) the roots have been used for treating various diseases. <br><br>It was observed that the mats made from Desmostachya bipinnata were not affected by termites. This observation prompted me to investigate the efficacy of Desmostachya bipinnata as a natural remedy for controlling termites.<br><br>Extracts of each root and leaf were made in different solvents both by the process of solvent extraction and by following an ayurvedic method. Various concentrations of these extracts as well as appropriate positive and negative controls were used on Coptotermes domesticus termite species and their responses were studied. The knockdown effect of the plant extracts was recorded at periodic intervals of two minutes up to 100% knockdown and knockdown times KT50 and KT95 calculated. The recovery/mortality 24 hours after exposure was also observed. The raw root and leaf of Desmostachya bipinnata were tested for its anti-termitic properties. It was found that the leaf of Desmostachya bipinnata achieved a mortality rate of 95% while the mortality rate in the root was found to be 90%. Experiments conducted on other pests (red ants, cockroaches and centipedes) showed a mean mortality rate of 85%. The lowest concentration that incurred mortality was found to be 3%. Data was statistically analyzed for significance. <br><br>The results showed that the Desmostachya bipinnata extracts have potent anti-termitic properties, this study can help develop a natural alternative to the current environmentally detrimental termiticides.<br><br>

REMOVAL OF HEAVY METAL WATER POLLUTANTS USING MAGNETITE NANOPARTICLES
Helen Tressa D'Couto
Clear Lake High School, Houston, Texas, United States

This project studies adsorption and separation of lead and cadmium from water on nanosized magnetite, based on the advantages of increased surface area and superparamagnetism of the nanoparticles. <br><br> The project compared the adsorption of lead and cadmium onto HFO and magnetite nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were made water soluble with a surfactant. The adsorptions were done by mixing set concentrations of lead or cadmium with a specific concentration of iron oxide. The HFO adsorption was done along a range of pHs. Nanoparticle trials along pH encountered problems of blocking the pH meter. The HFO solutions were filtered using vacuum filtration. The nanoparticle solutions were filtered using magnetic separations and centrifugation. The effluents were analyzed using Inductively Coupled Plasma for remaining concentrations of lead and cadmium. <br><br> Initial lack of adsorption indicated that the surfactant was blocking the surface sites, so trials were repeated after cleaning the surface of the nanoparticles. The Magnetite had an average efficiency of 20% removal of lead and 9% removal of cadmium. The HFO had efficiencies of 22% and 44% for lead and cadmium respectively. <br><br> The HFO showed a slightly higher efficiency in adsorption than nanoparticles. Magnetic properties of magnetite are evident due to the effectiveness of magnetic separations. Blockage of surface sites by surfactant, pH and surface charge, and properties of surface sites may be reasons that adsorption to magnetite was not as optimal as possible. <br><br> The project contributes to the targeted and efficient removal of heavy metals from water, which is especially useful in developing nations. <br><br>

REMEDIATION OF PHARMACEUTICAL CONTAMINATION OF GROUNDWATER: A MODEL USING ZEOLITES AND ASPIRIN
Marley Elizabeth Iredale
Sequim High School, Sequim, WA, US

Traces of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) are present in groundwater and have recently been considered a potential hazard. Although below known human toxicity and therapeutic thresholds, these medications persist in the environment and are biologically active. Riverbank infiltration is a naturally occurring filtration system occurring when surface water slowly seeps through soils. The goals of this project were to determine if natural riverbank filtration would remove PhACs, and if addition of zeolites would enhance their removal.<br><br> Soil samples were collected along the Dungeness River. Samples of each soil layer were tested to determine particle size, pH, percolation rate, and water-holding capacity. Two clinoptilolite zeolites used at a 5% volume adjustment to soil samples slowed percolation rate and increased water-holding capacity.<br><br> Aspirin was selected as a model contaminant PhAC because it is available without prescription and is easily assayed spectrophotometrically. Individual soil layers, zeolites, and soil/zeolite amendments were tested for their ability to retain aspirin. Various soil layers removed 3 – 5 % of the aspirin test-load; the two zeolites tested removed about 15% and the zeolite amended soils removed between 11 and 15%. Extrapolating from my data, 2000 lbs (40 ft3) of CHZ type zeolite can potentially remove 132 kgs of aspirin at a cost of $200-300. The zeolite can be reused after elution of the sequestered aspirin with dilute aqueous acid. Given the large variety of available zeolites that can be expected to exhibit different affinities for different pharmaceuticals, the present work strongly encourages further screening efforts.<br><br>

PROJECT GREEN ROOF: A PRACTICAL SOLUTION TO URBAN FLOODING
David Nicholas Thibodeaux
Thibodeaux Academy, Hainesport NJ, USA

In urban areas, storm water runoff can cause flooding as permeable land is replaced with impermeable surfaces. This study sought to evaluate the potential advantage of delayed drainage in a simulated green roof system as a means to alleviate flooding following heavy rain. It also considered the effects of saturation on the plants, as well as the evaporation/transpiration rate of the remaining moisture.<br><br> Samples were constructed from four containers (16x21x14cm) with drainage holes, which were covered with waterproof tape. Screen and gravel drainage layers were covered with green roof substrate. Each container was planted with four plugs of three varieties of Sedum and placed under artificial lighting. The dry weight of each plug was recorded before experimentation and again after two weeks.<br><br> <br><br> After an adjustment period, each container was saturated with 1.5 liters of spring water. Drainage holes were uncovered and runoff was measured after immediate release (control), after three hours, twelve hours, and twenty-four hours delay. Each container was weighed daily for two weeks to monitor moisture loss.<br><br> Retaining water for three hours reduced the amount of runoff by 26% (p<0.0001) compared to immediate drainage, while retaining for twenty-four hours permitted a 59% (p<0.0001) reduce in runoff. After two weeks, plant mass increased in all samples, indicating that saturation did not impair plant growth, and all containers returned to nearly their original weight.<br><br> The results support the premise that a simulated green roof with delayed drainage reduces runoff without a decrease in plant mass or prolonged restoration period.<br><br>

WASTE ASPHALT SHINGLE RECLAMATION THROUGH AGGREGATE SUBSTITUTION IN CONCRETE
Ethan Josiah Walker
Creekview Learning Center, Greer, SC USA

Every year, approximately 11 million tons of waste asphalt roofing shingles are sent to U.S. landfills. In the same year's time, over 500 million tons of concrete are produced nationally. About half of the volume of that concrete consists of small stones known as aggregate, which is used in concrete to provide strength. The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether waste shingles could be substituted for aggregate in concrete without a significant decrease in the strength of the concrete. <br><br> Waste shingles were cut to about 1 square cm.--a suitable size for aggregate. Control samples were prepared without shingle aggregate. Samples were then mixed in which shingle pieces were substituted for aggregate using varied mix-ratios. All the sample mixes contained 1 part cement, two parts sand, and three parts aggregate. All samples used the same cement and sand, and were cured in the same location. The only difference was the ratio of normal aggregate to shingles. The samples were submitted to independent labs for compressive strength testing. Results indicated a decrease in the mean compressive strength ranging from 32%--63% when compared to the control group. Analysis using a one-tailed T-test showed a statistically significant decrease. <br><br> However, even the lowest-strength sample had an estimated final PSI of 787, adequate for decorative and light-duty construction purposes. Further experimentation could include determining the optimal form and mix ratio of the shingles, further investigating the age-strength relationship, and designing equipment with which to more easily convert the shingles.<br><br>

THE IDENTIFICATION OF CRITICAL SALINITY THRESHOLDS FOR UPPER ESTUARINE PLANTS
Robbi Charles Bishop-Taylor
Great Lakes College - Forster Campus, Forster NSW, Australia

In Australia, and many other parts of the world, the effects of climate change are causing river flows to diminish. At the same time, water extraction from rivers is increasing, as populations around the world continue to expand. In upper estuaries, these reduced flows can cause saltwater to intrude further upstream than is naturally possible. This process can cause significant damage to sensitive life, notably freshwater plants that provide valuable habitat for a large range of ecologically important species. It is possible to slow the progress of salinity intrusion by reducing water extractions from the river through environmental-flow restrictions. <br><br><br>To devise environmental-flow restrictions, knowledge of the critical salinity thresholds for important flora found in upper estuaries is required. There has been virtually no research done on identifying these thresholds for plants that grow in the upper estuaries of Australia. To provide key information in this context, experimental work was undertaken to determine the critical salinity thresholds for five species of Australian upper-estuarine plants. <br><br><br>The experiment, which used replicated, one-month exposures to twelve salinity concentrations, identified the critical salinity thresholds for the five selected species as: <br><br><br>• Potamogeton octandrus = 1-2 ppt<br><br>• Vallisneria nana and Lomandra hystrix = 2-3 ppt<br><br>• Hydrilla verticillata and Myriophyllum verrucosum = 8-10 ppt<br><br><br>Given the lack of previous research, these thresholds are likely to be of high value in developing environmental flow restrictions for estuaries. This would minimize damage from water extraction, and thus help to preserve Australia’s valuable estuarine environments.

CHEMICAL BIOREMEDIATION OF DIFFERENT PETROLEUM DERIVATES IN CONTAMINATED MEDIA LIKE WATER, MARINE WATER, AND SOIL USING MIXED LIVE MICROORGANISMS. (2ND. YEAR OF RESEARCH)
Juan Andres Rivera
Elvira M. Colon Negron High School, Santa Isabel, Puerto Rico, USA

When petroleum contamination occurs some mixed live microorganisms can decompose the hydrocarbons. The affected areas can be improved by adding microorganisms and stimulating their growth. Bioremediation helps to increase the number of microorganisms in the affected area. The purpose of this research was to decompose petroleum derivates using the combination Penicillium chrysogenium, and Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and E.coli, Trichoderma sp., and Penicillium chrysogenium, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus niger, and Penicillium chrysogenium, E.coli, and Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and Trichoderma sp., Trichoderma sp., and Aspergillus niger. For this experimentation, contamination of water was simulated by mixing 15mL of water with 3 mL of the microorganisms and 12 mL of the petroleum derivates in a test tube. Soil contamination was simulated by mixing 80 grams of each different kind of soil with 3 mL of the microorganisms and 20 mL of the petroleum derivates in a test tube. Fertilizers of high and low nitrogen concentration (25-10-17 and 20-20-20) were used and the fungi grew causing an increase in the degradation of petroleum derivates. Fertilizer with a high potassium concentration (12-55-6, 15-50-5 or 10-30-20) was used and the fungi grew causing an increase in the degradation of petroleum derivates. After the process the presence of hydrocarbons in soil was tested by using gas chromatography, and no hydrocarbons were found. The combination of different live bacteria and live fungi improve the results obtained by bioremediation, in one or two days.<br><br>

ECO-FRIENDLY MAGNETIC GENERATOR: A NEW ALTERNATIVE WAY OF ENVIRONMENTAL FRIENDLY ENERGY PRODUCTION
Jonathan Gonzalez-Ocasio
Bonifacio Sanchez Jimenez High School, Aibonito, Puerto Rico

The conservation of nature and energy production is a worldwide problem. The Eco-Friendly magnetic generator is a possible solution for both.<br><br>The Eco-Friendly Magnetic generator is a system in which there is a movement created by magnets (neodymium magnets) that is transformed into electric energy.<br><br>Two magnets were placed at a certain angle for them to produce a movement. These magnets were attached to the end of an aluminum bar on a shaft in a cylinder. These magnets were repelled by the magnetic force of two other magnets on the cylinder wall. After experimentations with this design at a 45 degree angle the necessity for another material was found. When the magnet passed the first wall segment it would get an impulse but when entering the second magnetic field it would stop because of the strength of the second field. This led to the idea that a specialized magnetic shield in front of each segment was needed. This allowed a free rotation in which only the force applied at that angle worked. Once the clockwise movement was obtained a mechanical-electrical generator was then connected to the shaft and that energy was transformed into electricity.<br><br>Using the information on the angle, various designs were tried, including one in which a magnetic wall is not needed. The generator can be combined with other forms of environmental energy to increase efficiency or it can also be used alone. It is a new way to lower ecological decay and the burning of earth resources. <br><br>

A STUDY ON RHIZOFILTRATION WITH HELIANTHUS ANNUUS AND ITS EFFECT ON COAL BED METHANE PRODUCED WATER QUALITY
Eric Lee Keeling
La Veta High School, La Veta, Colorado, United States

Coal bed methane drilling has expanded rapidly in the Rocky Mountain West. In order to extract methane, the coal seam must first be de-watered. Often this water is surface discharged into ephemeral streams. Coal bed methane (CBM) water is typically moderately high in sodium bicarbonates and can be detrimental to soil and plants. This study was designed to determine if rhizofiltration with a halophytic plant (Helianthus annuus) could be used to improve the water quality.<br><br> Seeds were germinated and grown hydroponically. CBM water samples were obtained from a well site. Eight water samples were used for experimentation. Samples <br><br>1-6 contained two mature H. annuus plants each. Plant roots were submerged in the water sample. Samples 7-8 contained no plants. pH and sodium adsorption tests (SAR) were performed daily for 14 days to note changes in water chemistry. <br><br> An unexpected initial spike (average rise= 6.692) in SAR took place in all water samples. Several days after initial spike, Samples 1-6 showed a decrease in SAR. This trend continued till final test day. Samples 7-8 showed a continual increase in SAR through out testing. Average Initial/Final SAR was noted as follows: Samples 1-6: 17.331/17.895 and Samples 7-8: 17.331/48.540.At the end of testing pH results in samples with H. annuus were lower than samples without plants. <br><br> Test results and data analysis indicate rhizofiltration with H. annuus had the ability to lower the sodium hazard of the water. These findings could be applicable in the field to rhizofiltrate CBM water for irrigation. <br><br><br>

This project is the result of the synthesis of a biodegradable film made with starch. The idea arose when seeing in the class of Chemistry the contamination generated by plastics. With this in mind and a technique to synthesize films, we began to experiment. In addition to starch, the film is synthesized with glycerin, distilled water, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxid, and if you want, food colorant. The mixture is heated, and then spilled in a mold and is let dry. <br><br>Our first goal was to seal two films to form a bag, and to use it to keep the food that are sold in the highschool. We did it, but our film was very permeable to water and the food moisten. We made some tests in water ando soil, and foaund out that the film is biodegradable. Then we decided to also prove with potatoe and mandioca starches, analyze its properties, and in our next investigation, find a use with fresh food.<br><br>We synthesized new samples in which we varied the concentration of glycerin. To the different obtained samples we made tests of resistance to traction, permeability to the water, solubility in water and other solvents, percentage of humidity, among others. Then we analyzed the properties and observed that the amount of used glycerin, that acts like plastificant, makes the properties to vary: to minor concentration, better properties.<br><br>

The deep-borehole concept is a promising approach for nuclear waste disposal. It is essentially a very deep hole drilled vertically in granite bedrock for storage of nuclear waste. Studies of the deep-borehole storage facility have yielded positive results. However, selection of the most effective sealant for the deep-borehole is an issue that remains to be resolved.<br><br> <br><br> This research evaluated two possible materials for plugging the borehole: granite and concrete. Three scenarios were studied using different mathematical models. The first scenario assumed that the radionuclides diffused through dry granite and concrete. The second scenario assumed that the radionuclides diffused through stagnant water contained in the interconnected voids in the sealant. The third scenario assumed that the difffusion occurred through pressure-driven bulk water flow. Results for all three cases were positive. It appears that the amount of leaking radioactive waste can be expected to be very low in all three scenarios studied. Furthermore, it appears that granite and concrete are suitable materials for plugging the deep-borehole.

THE PURPLE PROJECT
Katelyn Marie Zatwarnicki
Whitesboro High School, Marcy NY, USA

Wetlands across America have been invaded by Lythrum salicaria, commonly known as purple loosestrife, a semi-aquatic perennial plant native to Europe. The plant colonizes rapidly due to the millions of seed it produces annually as well as through root propagation. As a result, water flow in rivers and canals is dramatically disrupted and there is a sharp decline in biological diversity. Life cycles of organisms from water fowl to amphibians and algae are negatively affected. In this project I explored the hypotheses that the Galerucella calmariensis beetle can be used as a biological control for purple loosestrife. After cultivating beetles on indoor potted purple loosestrife plants, the beetles were released in May at the Utica Marsh, a location invaded with purple loosestrife. Beetles were released at five marked plot sites. Follow up in mid-June included measurement of purple loosestrife stem height, assessment of leaf and stem damage, as well as population estimates of beetle eggs, larvae and adults. A general observation of the plot was recorded. Data collection continued for seven weeks. At week three and four flood waters prevented access and data collection. Prior to the flooding beetle populations were thriving at every plot. Also prior to flooding, plant damage from beetles was reported at most sites. Where as, after the flooding beetle lifecycle was disrupted. Populations were down and plant damage was reported less frequently. Preliminarily results seemed positive, but statistical analysis is incomplete at this time, as this is part of a five year longitudinal study. <br><br>

This research presents the evaluation of a plant insecticide based on the toxicity of the Calcium Oxalate found in the Zamioculcas zamiifolia plant, which was used to reduce the number of attacks of plague insects to the Raphanus sativus plant. This plant insecticide was prepared using equal proportions of leaves, roots and bulbs of Zamioculcas zamiifolia plants, and it was evaluated using a bio-statistical randomized block design. <br><br>The application of a randomized block design consisted of a sample of eight n=8 plots of 2 X 2 m of Raphanus sativus plants grouped in two blocks of four plots each. Each plot in each block received a different treatment. The treatments were prepared with 1070 g of each part of the plant (leaves, roots and bulbs), which were grounded and filtered to obtain 1853 ml of liquid extract. The extract was dissolved at 75, 65, 55 and 45% v/v in distilled water. <br><br>The randomized block design was implemented after completing an evaluation of plague attack events. After 6 and 13 days of planting the crop, the plots suffered an average attack of 14,18%. Within 16, 19 and 21 days of planting the Rahanus sativus, the plant insecticide was applied according to the established randomization. Insect attacks were evaluated two days after each application: 7,36% the first, 2,75% the second and 1,53% the third plot, for an average percentage of attacks of 4,37% and a reduction of 36,81%. <br><br>The data determined an attack to the plantation inversely proportional to the concentration of plant insecticide applied; in other words, “the higher the concentration, the lesser the attack of insects.” <br><br><br>

GHOST NETS: BIODEGRADABLE OR NOT?
Rachel M Lopez
Rio Rancho Mid-High School: 1600 40th Street, Rio Rancho, NM 87144

Every year innocent marine-life are injured or killed by lost fishing gear, also known as ghost nets. Is there a biodegradable material that is just as strong as nylon that can be lost or abandoned and will not harm marine-life? This project tested yucca and hemp to determine their sustainability as seawater fishing gear. It was hypothesized that if the same amount of yucca, hemp, and nylon is submerged in seawater, then the yucca will show more signs of deterioration because the fibers found in it come from a leaf. Also, if strands and nets were made from yucca, hemp, and nylon and submerged in seawater and tested for their percentage of strain, then the hemp will stretch less because it comes from the stem of the plant which has a wood-like texture. Yucca, hemp, and nylon were submerged in seawater for two weeks to determine if the materials showed signs of biodegradation and to measure their strain over time. The data collected did support the first hypothesis because yucca was the only material that showed any signs of biodegradation. The second hypothesis was not supported because the yucca strand stretched the least and the hemp strand stretched the most. In the experiment, the nylon net stretched the least and hemp net stretched the most, which did not support the final hypothesis. Further research on yucca as a viable material for fishing nets in the future might have important implications for both fishermen and marine-life.

CONSERVATION THROUGH PRECIPITATION: A NOVEL APPROACH TO SUSTAINABLY TREATING WATER VIA A PRECIPITATION APPARATUS
Joseph Kent Henry, Maureen Anne Williams
Bishop Moore High School, Orlando, FL, United States

The purpose behind this experimentation was to safely promote sustainable development by removing pollutants from water via a precipitation apparatus. By considering people, profits, and planet, we constructed a device that uses precipitant chemicals – ferric chloride, barium chloride, and calcium chloride – to remove pollutants including carbonates, sulfates, and phosphates which are contained in commonly-used compounds. Many of these chemicals have been banned due to the harmful effects they have on the environment, including eutrophication and acid rain, while those compounds which are still tolerated continue to cause pollution as well.<br><br>While last year’s experimentation dealt exclusively with phosphate removal, this year the device was not only improved but was also used to remove sulfate and carbonate pollutants as well. The precipitant chemical is stored in a chamber which releases the chemical into the water according to a set mole ratio. The reaction occurs and solid precipitates are trapped in a filter at the end of the process. Experiments using FeCl3 and Na3PO4, H2SO4 and BaCl2, and Na2CO3 and CaCl2 proved the apparatus design both effective and consistent. It was proven 84.18% effective in removing phosphates, 94.06% effective in removing sulfates, and 85.97% effective in removing carbonates. Statistical analysis including numerous single- and paired-sample T-Tests proved the significance of the data, while an ANOVA was run to prove that this year’s apparatus was more effective in removing phosphates than was last year’s. Thus, the experiment allowed for the conclusion that this device works cheaply and safely while reducing harmful environmental effects.<br><br>

NOVEL DISCOVERY AGAINST FIRE: SELF-EXTINGUISH AND FIRE RETARDANT PROPERTIES OF MEDICAGO SATIVA (ALFALFA) - PHASE III
Maria Del Mar Torres-Aviles, Victor Luis Torres-Aviles
Colegio De La Salle, Bayamon, PUERTO RICO

Collected data from previous researches using dry sprouts of the Medicago sativa (alfalfa) plant indicates that these sprouts appear to have self-extinguish and fire retardant properties. Seeds of M. sativa from organic crops were used to grow a homemade hydroponics culture. After soaking in water for 24 hours, the seeds were placed in rows over cotton balls and absorbent paper on top of a cardboard box. The seeds were kept moist daily in a cool place avoiding direct sunlight exposure. These hydroponics alfalfa plants were submitted to vertical combustion tests obtaining similar results to those obtained when commercial alfalfa for consumption was used. After the fire exposure test, the dry sprouts were scorched but lab grown samples didn't burn. To demonstrate if the M. sativa plant may work as a fire retardant or a natural barrier against fire when used in gardens, two wood houses models were built. For the control sample, Dichondra grass was evenly distributed around the perimeter of the model simulating a garden landscape. Alfalfa plants were placed in the same way for the test sample. A candle flame was utilized to ignite the test samples. It was observed in the control model that the grass allowed the fire to reach the model house. In the test sample it was observed that the alfalfa plant acted as abarrier and prevented the fire from burning the model house, The results tends to indicate that the alfalfa plant acted as a natural fire suppressant or retardant.

THE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF A SOLAR HYDROGEN ELECTRIC DRONE WATER SAMPLING VESSEL
Daniel Thomas Gray , Kelin Chen
Brooklyn Technical High School, Brooklyn, NY, The United States of America 

The purpose of this environmental engineering project was to design, build, and test a solar hydrogen electric water sampling system. This innovative system will offer several important advantages over other water sampling systems currently being used commercially and industrially. The new system will be capable of remotely collecting samples at several depths and locations in a body of water, while the operator is on the shore – the system is easy to use and does not pollute the water environment from which samples are being collected. Economically reasonable, our system will enable efficient water sampling and testing to be done in geographic areas where, at this time, water sampling and testing are not performed due to complex methodologies and cost barriers. <br><br> A 30 x 45 centimeter solar hydrogen electric water sampling vessel was constructed. The vessel is a boat-like water craft that consists of two separate decks. The vessel is propelled through the water by a 12 volt motor and a 7.5 cm propeller. The upper deck houses six solar panels, while the lower deck holds a solar hydrogen electric power unit as well as a battery for storing electrical energy. The lower deck also houses a winch which robotically pulls a rope connected to the sampling device which sits in the water. The water sampling device is a robot, capable of collecting up to four separate water samples at different depths. The entire system is controlled remotely from the shore by the operator.

VARIATION OF DNA DAMAGE AND PHOTOSYNTHETIC PROCESS OF NAVICULA DUE TO UV-B EXPOSURE.
Aaditya Abhishek Madala, Bhum-jun Kim
Chantilly High School, Chantilly, Virginia, USA

Since ozone depletion is a great threat for marine and terrestrial environments, it is crucial to examine the effects of Ultraviolet-B radiation on the productivity and DNA damage of phytoplankton. Navicula, the most common Phytoplankton, are the producers of the marine ecosystems and they control the carbon cycle which regulates the temperature of oxygen levels of the planet. DNA damage that results due to formation of UV induced Thymine dimers was quantified through a comet assay process. The Comet assay is a widely used single cell gel electrophoresis process in which DNA migration in an electric field generates comet-shaped DNA. The length of the tail is directly proportional to the intensity of DNA damage. <br><br>The purpose was to analyze the effects of UV-B radiation on navicula, and in specific, the variation in the photosynthetic productivity and DNA damage. Navicula were exposed to UV-B for 0, 4, and 8 hours each day. Carbon dioxide and dissolved oxygen levels were measured after every 24 hours which included certain times of UV-B exposure. After exposure to UV-B for seven consecutive days, a comet assay process was conducted which consisted of cell lysing and then immersion in alkaline unwinding solution to unwind the DNA from its unique helical structure. Results of carbon dioxide levels have demonstrated no significant changes in photosynthetic productivity. But dissolved oxygen levels have increased with the level of UV-B exposure length whereas the DNA damage gradually increased. The results indicated no definite relationship between photosynthetic productivity and DNA damage.<br><br>

SCREENING OF MARINE BACTERIA HIGHLY TOLERANT TO COPPER AS TOOLS FOR BIOREMEDIATON OF MINING EFFLUENTS
Franco Andres Colon, Diego Perez Egana
Liceo Domingo Herrera Rivera B-13, Antofagasta, Chile

The use of bacteria as bioremediators of heavy metals, is a potential alternative to the available methods commonly used for the detoxification and wastewater recycling of mining industry. In this research, the bacteria capacity to form biofilms has been analyzed, its tolerance to Cu2+ high concentrations and its capacity to accumulate this heavy metal, reducing it from watery dissolutions. The bacteria were isolated from marine sediments from San Jorge Bay, Antofagasta (latitude 23°38'39 S, longitude 70°24'39 W), which is contaminated by effluents from copper mining industry. <br><br>The cells were cultivated in petri dishes with 75ppm, 150ppm, 300ppm and 400ppm of Cu2+ and the most tolerant bacterial strain and the one greatest viability of growth was selected. This strain was cultured in four bioreactors, which contained a known copper concentration in watery dissolution.<br><br>The systems stayed for 5 days at 18 ºC and at continuous agitation. At the end of process, samples were taken from the bioreactors for its quantitative chemical analysis. It has been possible to evaluate and to determine the tolerance and viability of growth of bacterial strain to high copper concentrations (150ppm) and also to find evidence of reduction of Cu2+ by the microorganisms in the bioreactors.<br><br>

School of Science and Technology, San Antonio, Texas, United States

The purpose of this project was to find out if there are other ways to recycle aluminum cans. The hypothesis was that there is anoher way to recycle the aluminum by dissolving the aluminum in potassium hydroxide (KOH) to make alum. Alum is a compound used in many processes such as the purification of water, fire hydrant compounds, and even in the process of making leather and pickles. <br><br>The paint was removed from the cans with steel wool. 11.2g of potassium hydroxide was dissolved in distilled water. 1g of aluminum can was dissolved with the potassium hydroxide solution. The aluminum-hydroxide was heated to a boiling point until the volume was reduced halfway to 25 mL. The solution was filtered through filter paper by gravity and through a Buchner vacuum filtration apparatus. When it was cooled to room temperature, 20 mL of 9M sulfuric acid was added and a gelatinous substance was formed. The solution continued to boil until the solution became clear and the volume reduced to 45mL. The solution was cooled until the solution crystallizes. The alum was weighed.<br><br>In conclusion, the alum was made by dissolving the aluminum can into potassium hydroxide.<br><br>

Uniondale High School, Uniondale, NewYork, United States

This investigation determines if extracts of the leaves of noxious weeds can be beneficial to agriculture. We analyzed the potential usage of the leaves as a naturally safe insecticide, by collecting three types of weed plants such as Convolvulus arvensis (Bindweeds), Agropyron repens (Quack grass), Euphorbia esula (Leafy spurge). We used common solvents such as (Ethanol, Acetone, Methanol and Water) which were used to obtain the extracts. The solutions were applied on the Helodrilus caliginosus (Earthworms) in trays and also on Myzus persicae (Green peach aphids) in Petri dishes, to determine the impact of the extracts. The extracts were inoculated into the rhizosphere of Pisum sativum (Pea plants) and onto their leaves. The extracts were applied throughout the environment of Hippodamia convergens (Ladybird beetles). We measured the various rates of photosynthesis to determine the effect the extracts had on the growth of the Pisum sativum (Pea plants). <br><br>We determined the final cost analysis for the weed plants over an acre of land. The alternative hypothesis was selective in killing only the Myzus persicae (Green peach aphids) but not harming the Hippodamia convergens (Ladybird beetles), Helodrilus caliginosus (Earthworms). The extracts did not affect the rate of photosynthesis over a 48 hour period. In collecting the data, the primary investigators have come to the conclusion that the Agropyron repens (Quack grass) under the methanol extraction was superior in killing the Myzus persicae (Green peach aphids). Through this investigation it was determined that these weed extracts could be used as a safe insecticide<br><br>

USING MODIFIED ANCIENT TECHNOLOGY FOR OBTAINING FRESH WATER FROM THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE ARID STEPPE CRIMEA
Zarema Umerova, Ruslan Anvarovych Fatkullin
Mezhvodnoe High School. Mezhvodnoye, Crimea, Ukraine.

Water resources in the steppe region of Crimea are limited, which prevents development of the area. Extracting water through wells in the Tarkhankut area is uncontrolled, causing water salinization.<br><br>It is possible to obtain water from the atmosphere using natural processes of condensation on porous rocks. We modified this ancient technology used in some arid regions and constructed a limestone heap-condenser (truncated cone, base diameter 20 m, height 6 m; 2.7 tonnes per cubic metre, rock size 20-40 ñm). Water is condensed when air passes through the heap. It can give more than 300 litres of water a day.Two kinds of condensers can be used in Crimean steppes: (1) heap-condenser with cemented platform (to prevent water from leaking) with a slope to the centre and drain; (2) heap-condenser without the platform, located near water sources for restocking groundwater.<br><br>Our experiments confirmed the possibility of obtaining water with heap-condensers. The analysis of water has shown that it is suitable to use. We experimentally selected rocks with high density.<br><br>The practical value is potentially huge. Heap-condensers can be used as local sources of fresh water at waterless seacoasts, in farms and for restocking of water sources, because the best time for condensing is a hot period. The volume of the condensate depends on the size of the heap-condenser, but parameters of condensation are controlled by local climatic and microclimatic conditions. This technology is effective, environmentally safe, and cost-efficient. Practical recommendations are provided for introducing it in Crimea and other arid areas.<br><br>

EFFECT OF BIOFILTRATION ON THE PRESENCE OF VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS IN INDOOR ENVIRONMENTS
Eli Benjamin Arnow, Paul Weiss
Fox Lane High School, Bedord NY, 10506

The objective of this project was to design and construct a prototype hydroponic plant wall biofiltration system built from recycled, ‘green’ materials and monitor the air quality of two indoor spaces for overall Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) concentration decrease. Enzymes, in particular dioxigenases, which exist in the cells of microorganisms located at the roots of select plants, metabolize identified VOCs into simpler compounds. <br><br> The most common airborne pollutants found in the indoor environment include toluene, benzene and tetrachloroethane, all VOCs. These toxins are off-gassed from common indoor objects. The EPA cites indoor air quality as one of the top five public health concerns today. <br><br> North Americans spend over 90% of their time indoors. Trends in modern building design are reducing both passive air leakage and active ventilation. The resulting decrease in air exchange is purported to reduce the overall energy costs of heating and cooling. However, sealing buildings leads to the accumulation of airborne pollutants. <br><br> During the summer of 2006, monitoring took place at two locations. Upon analyzing the data, it was confirmed that the biofiltration system was successful in reducing TVOC concentrations. Problems included maintaining plant health and reducing resulting humidity levels. In order to promote the viability of the hydroponic system, further study needs to occur with respect to increasing the longevity of plant life and the vigor of their root mass and rhizosphere.<br><br>

OPTIMIZING RECYCLED POLYMER BLENDS USING SUPERCRITICAL CARBON DIOXIDE
Emily Levine, Danielle Lent
Stella K. Abraham High School for Girls, Hewlett, NY, USA

A pressing need exists for improved methods of creating cost-efficient and environmentally-friendly methods of recycling plastics. Current recycling methods impair polymer properties. This research improves properties of recycled polymer blends by enhancing their compatibilities through the use of supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2), which lowers the interfacial tension between different polymers, thus increasing their solubility.<br><br> Recycled computer casings (rHIPS) and poly-vinyl chloride (rPVC) were combined with pure Ethylene Vinyl Acetate (EVA) to obtain a common benchmark for supercritical exposure. Additionally, the three were mixed in various di-polymer blends, along with varying percentages of Cloisite 20A clay, and then exposed to scCO2. <br><br> Analysis of blends revealed significant improvement in the mechanical properties. DMA results indicate compatibilization of the polymers and an increase in the dynamic modulus of blends after supercritical exposure, indicating polymer foaming and a subsequent increase in blend strength. Tensile testing showed an increase in Young’s modulus, ductility and toughness for the post exposure samples. Addition of clay proved inferior to scCO2, both as a compatibilizer and an enhancer of mechanical properties in recycled polymers.<br><br>

MEAN, GREEN CARBON FILTRATION MACHINE CARBEN SEQUESTRATION BY PHOTOBIOREACTOR USING CHLORELLA VULGARIS AND LEMNA MINOR
Catharine Shea Thompson, Kerry Wang
Plano Senior High School, Plano, TX, USA

The goal was to design a filter able to capture and store greenhouse gas emissions by photosynthesis using a green algae, Chlorella vulgaris and floating angiosperm, Lemna minor. These two species were chosen for their high rate of photosynthesis and reproduction. Lemna minor also forms a thick sheet across the surface of the water, creating a physical barrier that will keep CO2 from escaping.<br><br>The final design of the filter was built with a 3-gallon tank, a ceramic CO2 diffuser, an output check valve, and vinyl tubing. Industrial-grade CO2 (99.5% pure) was provided from a 5 lb aluminum tank with volumetric flow regulator. Tests included taking 3 cc gas samples approximately every 6 hours and analyzing the CO2 concentration of the exiting gas from the tanks by injecting gas into a solution of pH indicator and using a spectrophotometer to precisely measure the color change.<br><br>Previous designs had flaws, including method of measuring CO2 concentration, dissolving CO2 into the water effectively, ridding the Lemna minor of unwanted microorganisms, and measuring and regulating rates of gas flow. The final design overcame these obstacles, removing 80.6 percent of all incoming CO2. <br><br>This research provides a relatively unexplored method of carbon sequestration that may be more versatile and affordable than traditional methods. This method can also easily be integrated with a water purification plant. This would be able to remove nitrogenous waste from the water supply, remove carbon dioxide emissions from industrial structures, and save energy and resources by combining the two processes. <br><br>

THE EFFECT OF MERCENARIA MERCENARIA, IGNEOUS ROCK, AMMOPHILA BREVILIGULATA, AND LUCERNE HAY RIPARIAN BUFFERS ON NITRATE SEQUESTRATION IN CORRELATION TO ECOLOGICAL HEALTH
Gabrielle Marie Strike, Anup Myneni
York High School, Yorktown Virginia, United States of America

This research project investigates the successful implementation of various natural components in a riparian buffer system designed to sequester excess nitrate from groundwater before it enters the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. A multitude of tests were conducted to determine the possible application of the clam species Mercenaria mercenaria, igneous rock, Lucerne hay, and the coastal grass species Ammophila breviligulata to remove nitrate. During testing, 180 milligrams of nitrate were induced into five separate aquatic environments in the form of groundwater every three days, and tests were conducted to determine the effects of sequestration on nitrate concentration, dissolved oxygen concentration, and the amount of light reduced as a result of epiphyte and cyanobacteria growth. Ultimately, the goal of this investigation was to develop a realistic and implementable solution to high aquatic nitrate levels, while simultaneously evaluating the popular proposal to restore filter feeders into the bay as a solution.<br><br> Although the coastal grass Ammophila breviligulata was initially hypothesized to sequester the most nitrates, the Lucerne hay riparian buffer ultimately maintained healthy conditions in its aquatic environment most successfully. The substantial sequestration capabilities discovered in Lucerne hay thus reveal large potential and can be easily integrated into existing coastal systems and governmental regulation. Conversely, the filter feeders Mercenaria mercenaria did not improve water quality, as suggested by many bay politicians but proved to be malevolent to the environment as a whole. As the filter feeders died and decayed, they released even more nitrate into the environment, potentially causing a nitrate feedback loop as increasing higher levels of nitrate killed more organisms, thus increasing nitrate levels exponentially, rather than linearly. <br><br><br>

DIBLOCK COPOLYMERS AND EPOXIDIZED CARTHAMUS TINCTORIUS OIL AS NOVEL POLY(VINYL CHLORIDE) PLASTICIZERS
Thomas Yang Sun, Robyn Thom
Sir Winston Churchill Secondary, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada

Poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) is among the top three most widely used plastics globally. Construction, medical devices, and automobile parts are only a few of the sectors that make extensive use of PVC. A phthalate ester, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), is often added as a plasticizer by as much as 40% by weight to impart flexibility. However, DEHP, a known toxin and carcinogen, leaches into the atmosphere, causing severe environmental contamination, impacting wildlife, aquatic species and human health. An environmental assessment was done on the degree of DEHP contamination in local soil and water samples. Our experimentation on the release behaviour of DEHP confirmed that it leaches out of the PVC polymer matrix rapidly. This study attempts to find safe, biodegradable and high-performance DEHP alternatives.<br><br>Two synthetic diblock copolymers were tested, along with epoxidized Carthamus tinctorius oil (ECTO), which was synthesized via a chemo-enzymatic reaction. PVC films with these alternatives were cast, and performance tests of dimension change, glass transition temperature, and extraction resistance were conducted. Although the diblocks were of slightly lower performance than DEHP, ECTO was of higher. At 10% concentration, films with ECTO were 200% more flexible than those cast with DEHP. <br><br>Our results show that a lesser amount of ECTO, a more environmentally friendly substance, not only achieves better plasticizing effects than DEHP, but is also an effective heat stabilizer. ECTO can be used in applications requiring a hydrophobic plasticizer; the two diblocks can be used in hydrophilic applications. <br><br>

LIGNIN FROM OIL PALM EMPTY FRUIT BUNCHES (EFB) AS AN ADSORBENT FOR HEAVY METAL ION (CU2+)
Ijaz Khalif Abdul Malek, Ahmad Amirul Aiman Samsudin, Mohd. Suhaimi Suib
MARA Junior Science College of Langkawi, Kuah, Langkawi, Kedah, Malaysia.

Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) is a native of West Africa. It was introduced to various parts of tropics for its oil-producing fruit. In Malaysia, it is estimated that 2.28 million ha of land is being cultivated with oil palm trees. Besides producing palm oil, the industry also generates massive amounts of lignocellulosic residues such as trunks, fronds, and empty fruit bunches (EFB). The EFB is useful in the pulp and paper manufacturing industry. During the bleaching process, a toxic solution in the form of Black Liquor (BL) is discarded into waste. <br><br> In this study, the BL obtained from pulping process is collected and is treated in order to extract lignin out of it. Lignin can be used in many industrial applications such as drilling mud thinner in oil and gas drilling field, emulsifier agent, resin for wood binder and etc. Another function of lignin which is a heavy metal adsorber is being highlighted. The lignin and modified lignin (if necessary) will be used to adsorb heavy metal ion Pb2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, Cr2+, and Fe2+ in waste water sample. The results will be compared against the requirement as per the Parameter Limits of Effluent Standard B.<br><br> The results revealed that the maximum adsorption percentage is 80.6% at pH value of 2.5, adsorbent dosage of 1.6 g lignin and adsorption time of 12 days.<br><br> In general, the adsorption quantity was directly proportional to the increase in adsorbent dosage and adsorption time but inversely proportional to the pH value of the solution.<br><br>

The Project Alternative Treatment of Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) for the production of paint offers several advantages. At present, most people consider that the basic raw material is a waste product, for which it can be bought at almost no cost. When resin is recycled, a product with higher added value is obtained than that of other manufactured products, the amount of waste diminishes and a potencial source of problems at the dumping grounds is eliminated. <br><br>In the proposed treatment, broken computers are taken apart, the external plastic resins are extracted and cleaned to prevent contaminating agents in the final product; afterwards, the resins are cut into smaller pieces that are easier to handle and are deposited in a crushing machine. The resulting material is dissolved in thinner together with the pigment of the selected color and is left to stand for several hours due to the amount of volatile gases that it contains. After this, to rise the level of dispersion of the components, the product must be placed in a paint shaker. <br><br>This project poses a new strategy with the purpose of achieving an environmental, social and economic improvement in a world where a great amount of computer waste is rapidly polluting our planet and the techniques currently used are not providing adequate results. <br><br>

LOW COST SINGLE CHAMBERED MICROBIAL FUEL CELL FOR HARVESTING ENERGY AND CLEANSING WASTEWATER
Ashutosh Patra
Sunset High School, Portland, OR

Lately energy production and wastewater treatment have become pressing issues. An attractive solution to these problems is Microbial Fuel Cells (MFC). However, current MFCs are too costly to be viable. Therefore, the goal of my project is to build low-cost, single-chambered MFCs that harvest electricity and produce purified water from wastewater. My experiments explore constructing MFCs from cheap alternatives to commonly used, expensive nafion membranes and platinum cathodes. I am using "low tech" materials (household containers, Gore-Tex and agar as membranes, and metal screens as cathodes, etc.) and simple constructions to show viability for poorer countries. Multiple MFC designs were created, tested and evaluated under similar conditions. I also created a novel electrode- membrane-cathode assembly. Experimental results show possibility to produce at least 4.33 times the amount of energy per dollar compared to average MFCs in research labs today. The small initial prototypes give about 0.78mA at 0.59V for 9-cm2 of anode area. Additionally, the experiments study ways to: reduce resistive losses in the system, make single-chambered constructions, and find possible replacements of the membrane while providing good oxygen isolation. The project is unique because most research has been driven at increasing MFC power production and reducing costs has been neglected. Lowering costs will make MFCs viable for wastewater treatment which would 1) produce "green" electricity, 2) isolate harmful anaerobic bacteria and recycle bio waste 3) clean existing and produce new sources of water, 4) provide an incentive for poor countries to recycle and dispose of waste safely and cost-effectively.

BIOREMEDIATION OF ARSENIC CONTAMINATED WATER BY MESOPHILIC AND THERMOPHILIC ALGAE
Chloe Julia Cundall
Greybull High School, Greybull, WY

Thermopolis, Wyoming is world renown for its natural mineral hot springs. These hot springs contain a wealth of microorganisms that are unique to the high temperature pools. These organisms include both prokaryotic and eukaryotic species. The most common eukaryotic organisms are algae, which can grow in a range of temperatures. Eukaryotes from hot springs are adapted to utilize compounds present in their harsh environment. There is a possibility that their unique physiology may allow them to break down other, more toxic compounds as well. An estimated fifty-seven million people are drinking groundwater with arsenic concentrations above the World Health Organization¡¯s standard of ten parts per billion. Natural bioremediation by algae may reduce the cost of improving water supplies and ensure lower levels of arsenic in drinking water worldwide.<br><br> Algae were incubated in test tubes containing 5mL of algae and 10mL of mineral springs water. Mesophilic algae species were incubated at temperatures of 35¢ªC. The thermophilic algae were incubated at temperatures of 50¢ªC. One mL of diluted sodium arsenite with a concentration of 10ppb was added to algae in each test tube. The algae then incubated at the given temperatures for 10 days. Arsenic concentrations were detected using an Arsenic Check kit provided by Hybrivet Systems Inc.<br><br> The thermophilic organism (Hydrogenobaculum) did not show any measurable reduction in the arsenic levels added to the culture. The mesophilic organisms gave better results and could point towards viable applications in the reduction of arsenic from local water supplies. Cyanidium yielded positive results, showing a reduction of arsenic from 10 ppb to a non-measurable quantity of approximately 1 ppb or less. It would seem that this alga possesses the ability to eliminate arsenic, though the exact mechanism by which it does so is not known.

BIOREMEDIATION OF HYDROCARBON CONTAMINATED SOILS
Rachel Christine Rickards
Bartlesville High School, Bartlesville, OK

This environmental project explores if hydrocarbon contaminated soils can be bioremediated by natural means to a useable state for growth of germination to take place. The bioremediation procedure uses algae water (spirogyra, H20) and cow manure as a natural bioremediation agent. Ten experimental cups, with two holes each to allow for runoff, were filled with potting soil. Experimental cups contained samples as follows; cups 1a, 1b only soil. Cups 2a, 2b soil and crude oil. 3a, 3b soil, crude oil, and cow manure. 4a, 4b soil, crude oil, and Algae water. 5a, 5b soil, crude oil, cow manure, and algae water. All cup's contents were thoroughly mixed and allowed to set for 7 days. Thirty rye grass seeds were then planted into each cup. All cups were randomly placed in a growth chamber consisting of an artificial light and thermometer. One plastic runoff collection cup was placed under each experimental cup to collect any runoff. Each cup was watered with five milliliters of water every day for fourteen days. The runoff was measured in milliliters everyday along with the height of the tallest blade measured in centimeters, and finally the number of blades of grass in each cup. The results indicated soil samples were bioremediated except for the oil control (2a,2b), and cow manure (3a,3b) cups. This confirms that hydrocarbon contaminated soils such as oil spills can be bioremediated with the use of certain natural products.

EXTRACTING OIL FROM ALGAE GROWN IN WASTEWATER FOR BIODIESEL PRODUCTION, YEAR TWO
Jennifer Joy VanderWeele
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland, OR

The purpose of my project was to design a process to grow algae in municipal wastewater obtained from my local wastewater treatment plant and extract a significant amount of oil from the algae for biodiesel production. Three strains of freshwater algae were grown in three different dilutions of wastewater. Algae from the four best-growing combinations were filtered and divided into two parts. Two different extraction methods were applied to each of the four samples. One extraction method involved grinding dried algae with a mortar and pestle. The second method involved mashing wet algae in a rock tumbler for 24 hours with small stainless steel balls. At the end of each process, the oil was extracted by adding hexane solvent, filtering out the algae solids, and evaporating off the hexane, so that only oil remained. Because the algae was not completely filtered out in the dry extraction method, results inaccurately include some algae mass in addition to the oil. For this reason, the dry extraction data is unreliable. By visual assessment, the dry extraction appeared to remove little, if any, oil from the algae. The rock tumbler extraction method, however, did successfully remove some oil from the algae. I met four of my five engineering goals by successfully growing two species of algae in wastewater and extracting oil from that algae using a mechanical extraction process. However, I did not meet my goal of obtaining 25% of the algae dry mass as oil; my highest oil yield was 17.5%.

THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT DISTURBANCE REGIMES ON BIODIVERSITY IN A POST OAK SAVANNAH ECOSYSTEM
Logan Allan Kostroun
C.H. Yoe High School, Cameron, TX

The purpose of this project is to determine and characterize the effects of disturbance regimes in three areas: undisturbed rangeland (UR), an annually cultivated hay field (CHF), and a tilled seeded plot (TSP), on overall biodiversity and soil composition in a post oak savannah ecosystem. The null hypothesis for this research stated that the different disturbance regimes will have no effect on biodiversity. Invertebrate counts, soil sampling, and year II plant counts occurred at the Cameron I.S.D. school farm. After collecting data, statistical analysis evaluated the significance of the disturbance regimes with the dependent variables for each site: Simpson’s index for biodiversity, pH level, humus content, and Panicum virgatum count. <br><br>The biodiversity data in the Simpson’s biodiversity index regression analysis indicated that there was a statistically significant difference between the regime practices. The UR had a substantially desirable effect on biodiversity with a positive coefficient. The CHF and the TSP on the other hand exhibited negative effects.<br><br>The Soil composition regression analysis indicated that for the pH value, the UR and the TSP both had a coefficient of ≈1.3, yet the CHF had a coefficient of -1.56667. In the analysis of the humus content, the UR and TSP both had positive coefficients, yet again the CHF had a negative trend. <br><br>Conclusions from this study show adverse effects on biodiversity in a Post Oak Savannah Ecosystem as a result of the disturbance regime practices of mowing and tilling, thus the null hypothesis is not supported. Through this research, an improved knowledge of the biodiversity in a Post Oak Savannah ecosystem will lead to a better management and protection of the vast rangelands of the world.

KINETICS OF BIOREMEDIATION AND ELECTRICITY PRODUCTION IN A NOVEL MICROBIAL FUEL CELL
Timothy Zuchi Chang
Stuyvesant High School, New York, NY

Our wastewater is a feast for billions of bacteria, and this abundant biological resource can be a source of clean energy. A microbial fuel cell (MFC) is an anaerobic bioreactor in which bacteria oxidize substrates to produce free electrons, or electricity. An added benefit of this process is bioremediation, removing pollutants from wastewater before discharging it into the environment. <br><br>Optimal designs and conditions for MFC operation are not yet fully defined. This research begins to analyze how enhancing biofilm growth and substrate consumption can improve the bioremediation and electricity-production from wastewater-fueled MFCs. To accomplish this, a novel, low-cost fuel cell with a large anode surface area was designed. Nutrient consumption tests and efficiency measurements obtained in this research will be used to improve future reactor designs. <br><br> Prior to inoculation with anaerobic digester sludge, several MFCs were prepared with various electron acceptors to encourage extracellular electron deposition. Biofilm from the MFC producing the most power was used to seed later generations of fuel cells, to select the most efficient bacterial community. Tests were performed to define carbon and nitrogen consumption rates (the bioremediation process). <br><br>The MFC enriched with iron (iii) chloride, FeCl3, produced the most power, approximately 1.2 W/m2. Added nitrogen and carbon were consumed within 72 hours with 62 percent voltaic efficiency. Thus, 62 percent of the energy in a glucose molecule was converted to electricity. This suggests selective pressures on electricity-producing microbial communities will improve MFC efficiency for power output and wastewater treatment.

USE OF SEASHELLS TO DETOXIFY LEAD-CONTAMINATED EFFLUENT AND GROUNDWATER
Theresa Ann Oei
East Catholic High School, Manchester, CT

Lead contamination is a growing problem that affects many regions of the world. It is mainly caused by manufacturing processes and e-waste. Seashells are porous nano-structures composed mostly of calcium- carbonate (CaCO3). <br><br>In this project, the size of the seashells, the settling time, the salinity and the acidity of the water were varied to optimize lead removal. The seashells were effective in eliminating the lead from the contaminated water through the following chemical reaction:<br><br> <br><br>Ca2+CO3 + 2H2O + Pb2+ -> Ca2+(OH)2 + Pb2+CO3 + H2. <br><br>The time required to extract lead from the water varied directly in accordance with the size of the crushed shells. Decreasing the size of the seashell particles has the effect of increasing the surface area and thereby the reaction sites. The pH of the contaminated water also affected the results of the experiment. The high alkaline (high pH) of the water along with carbonate forms calcium hydroxide, also known as scaly lime (Ca2+(OH)2). This allows the Pb2+CO3 to better adhere to the reaction sites accelerating the extraction of the lead. <br><br>Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) at 2000X magnification clearly revealed the lead ions as white crystalline polyps attached to the seashell. <br><br>Based on the results of this experiment a seashell filter was built. Samples analyzed by an independent laboratory showed 100% elimination of lead in the contaminated water. The effectiveness of the seashell filter and its low cost is a viable alternative to more expensive, commercially available units.

MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF CONFLAGRATION POTENTIAL AND ITS APPLICATION IN VERSATILE DETECTION DEVICES
Nima Ahmadi
Westview High School, Portland, OR

Because of the increasing prevalence of wildfires and their devastating effects on both the environment and human society, as well as the numerous benefits of prescribed burning, it is vital to provide the general public and professionals with a convenient method to determine the probability of a fire occurring. This research project defines Conflagration Potential (CP), the percent chance of a fire happening, by deriving a mathematical model that incorporates ambient and system factors at a specific geographical location. A versatile detection device is then prototyped to measure the aforementioned factors and implement the mathematical model for practical use. The measured ambient factors include temperature, humidity, wind speed, and oxygen level. To maximize accuracy and complete the inputs of the mathematical model, a fuel moisture probe is also included in the device to measure the water content of a plant. Other fire danger rating systems, such as the Angstrom Index and the Nesterov Index, fail to account for all the essential factors and have never been applied to an engineered device. Fire is a powerful force of nature that will continue to generate problems for human-environment interactions. The result of this project is another, advanced method by which human beings can prevent devastating fires from occurring.

GOOD BEAN SPROUT NEWS INVOLVING RECYCLED PLASTICS
Crystal Monet Boykin
Walsh Jesuit High School, Cuyahoga Falls, OH

This project investigated new uses for recycled plastics in order to reduce environmental plastic waste. High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) was the recycled plastic used for testing in this experiment. The recycled plastics were tested as a soil substitute with mung and alfalfa, major agricultural bean sprouts. This project hypothesized that recycled plastics could be used as a soil substitute because it created pores in the plant system that helped with irrigating the sprouts. The experiment was tested under three conditions: soil with additives, plastic alone, and plastic with the additives. The soil system was the control. The plastics were shredded and the systems with the additives were uniformly mixed with them. The additives included: vermiculite, prelight, Pete moss, and fertilizer. <br><br> This experiment took place in a controlled environment. They were placed under a sodium light, the temperature maintained between 60-70F, and the systems were watered at a constant interval. For each system the ph level, moisture, plant height, and plant yield were tested. All tests were run three times for repeatability. A germination test also took place to observe recycled plastics affect on bean sprout germination process. 10 seeds were placed in a Petri dish, and were watered at a constant interval. The plastic systems nearly doubled in growth and yielded 50% more sprout growth. The germination process with plastics yielded 3 - 4 times more seeds. It was found that recycled plastic, High Density Polyethylene, could improve sprout growth, sprout yield, and increase germination.

THE EFFECT OF ALLIARIA PETIOLATA ON THE ABUNDANCE OF ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI (AMF) AND ITS EFFECT ON THE GROWTH OF NATIVE PLANTS
Jun Hong Kim
Stone Bridge High School, Ashburn, VA

As exotic species invade American native plants’ ecosystems, many ecologists carried out studies on the invasion with the majority of the studies concentrating on the aboveground interactions. In this research, the effect of the invasion by the exotic plant, garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata), on the soil community and the growth of native plants (Viola sp.) was observed especially focusing on the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF).<br><br> In Phase I of the experiment, Viola sp. plants were divided into two groups: the first group was planted in soil where no garlic mustard invasion occurred, and the second group was planted in soil where garlic mustard was growing. The independent variables were the different soil types, and the dependent variable was the height of the Viola sp. in centimeters after 40 days. The hypothesis was supported as the origin of the soil did have a significant effect on the growth of Viola sp. The rootlets of the two groups of Viola sp. were observed, and the abundance of AMF was distinct between the two groups. The rootlets in the soil where garlic mustard was not present had abundant internal AMF compared to a lack of internal AMF in the rootlets from the soil with garlic mustard invasion. Thus, the abundance of AMF showed a positive correlation with the growth of Viola sp. <br><br> In Phase II of the experiment, the two types of soil used in Phase I were inoculated with AMF in order to observe whether the soil community could be restored after the invasion of Alliaria petiolata. The new sets of Viola sp. showed a positive outcome in both soil types as the mean height of the plants increased in both soil types at a similar rate. <br><br> Further research needs be done on the function of AMF and how the fungi support the intake of significant nutrients by their hosts.

REMOVAL OF WATER POLLUTANTS USING MAGNETITE NANOPARTICLES, PART II
Helen Tressa D'Couto
Clear Lake High School, Houston, TX

There is a global drinking water crisis and many current technologies do not meet the needs of developing nations. This project uses magnetite nanoparticles to develop a versatile water treatment system for the removal of heavy metals and microbes from water. Part I of the project studied the adsorption of Cd (II) and Pb (II) to water-soluble magnetite and found that adsorption occurred at low rates. The focus of Part II is to optimize adsorption of Pb (II) and As (V) onto water-soluble and surfactant-free magnetite nanoparticles and to engineer a sustainable water treatment system.<br><br> Adsorption of As(V) and Pb(II) was performed on a range of total surface areas of two different sizes of surfactant-free magnetite. A method to synthesize magnetite nanoparticles using commonly found household items, such as cooking oil, drain cleaner, and vinegar, was developed. The home synthesized particles were used to develop prototypes of a filter that removes heavy metals and microbes. A modified Stober method was used to coat the particles with a silica-silver coating for microbe removal.<br><br> Adsorption of As(V) and Pb(II) onto surfactant-free magnetite nanoparticles met EPA standards, optimizing removal in comparison to water-soluble particles. Pb(II) adsorption increases as magnetite particle sizes increase from 11 to 30nm. This project presented novel evidence for the effect of surface structure/curvature on heavy metal adsorption. The kitchen synthesis is a successful method in synthesizing magnetite nanoparticles, thus reducing costs, and improving sustainability. The silica-silver coating for microbe removal did not consistently produce single particle cores so a method to use a slow-sand filter for microbe removal was investigated. <br><br> This study shows that magnetite nanoparticles will be a successful solution to the current global drinking water crisis because of high adsorption, easy magnetization, and the home synthesis.

TRACING THE MIGRATION OF PESTICIDES THROUGH THE PRODUCTION OF SOUTHWESTERN CONNECTICUT HONEY
Eliza Helen McNitt
Greenwich High School, Greenwich

Continued use of pesticides and herbicides throughout both the agricultural and private sector has led to concern about the effects of these chemicals on common fruits and vegetables, and whether these often harmful chemicals are still present when the food is consumed. Most research has focused on the growth and retail of typical agricultural products, however little work has been done to identify the presence of residual pesticides in the honey of Apis mellifera (the typical honey bee). This investigation seeks to verify the migration of five known pesticides, applied within a 30 acre radius within the Bartlett Arboretum (in Stamford, CT), to the honey product of a controlled bee-hive located within the Arboretum grounds. The five pesticides applied within the Arboretum are Dipel, Neem Oil, Insecticidal Soap, Imidacloprid, and Pyrethrins. Initial experiments based on ultrasonic-solvent extraction of honey, and the analysis of the organic layer against known samples of the five pesticides, with Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (FTIR), proved to be non-specific and lacked sufficient sensitivity since all pesticides, and the neat honey samples exhibited an asymmetric C-O stretch at 1058 cm-1. High Pressure Liquid Chromatography based analysis, with UV detection at 255 nm, indicates that components of Pyrethrins and Imidacloprid are not detectable in the organic honey extract. This same analysis points out, however, that components of BioNeem Oil are present in the final product of the Arboretum 2007 Fall Honey. The Analysis of Commercial Honey of unknown origin also revealed the presence of the Bio Neem Oil component as well as other additional compounds.

THE HOLLOW FRAME FENCE, YEAR SEVEN: INVESTIGATIONS OF INNOVATIVE SNOW FENCE DESIGNS TO MAXIMIZE SNOW CAPTURE FOR WATER CONSERVATION AND RECLAMATION IN INDUSTRIAL SETTINGS
Erica Elizabeth David
Pinedale High School, Pinedale, WY

Snow fences are traditionally studied for protection from blowing and drifting snow. However, little research exists applying snow fences to reclamation of disturbed habitat. This work developed potential for utilizing snow as viable water supply for improved success of targeted native vegetation in reclaiming disturbances of industrial sites. Research was conducted in the Jonah Natural Gas Field, which is one of the nation’s largest natural gas fields, yet also home to the nation’s largest intact pronghorn migratory route and vital habitat for sage grouse.<br><br> In this much expanded field study, a new fence design and site layouts were established based on early summer plant germination successes. Vegetation results indicated that targeted plants appeared strictly within Intensive Fence arrangements. Therefore, in the fall, hand-seeded plots and snow fences were strategically arranged to maximize moisture conditions for sagebrush germination. Hollow Frame Fences deposited higher volume, denser snowpack, and stabilized the subsurface winter snow moisture, providing the largest potential increase in spring soil moisture, and conditions for successful germination of sagebrush. Furthermore, second year sites with significant vegetation growth resulted in minimal drifting; therefore fences should be rotated following a one year period. Upcoming spring data will analyze drift recession, soil moisture patterns, and early spring germination. <br><br> Engineering of the Hollow Frame Snow Fence and implementation of economically viable guidelines are significantly improving arid desert reclamation. The Hollow Frame Fence is revolutionizing habitat restoration, laying foundations for industrial snow fence use in natural gas exploration, and potentially saving billions of habitat reclamation dollars.

Last year the synthesis of a biodegradable film and some of its physicochemical properties was reported. The film was made of starch from cassava and glycerine (33.3 g glycerine/ 100 g starch). In the present work I focused the research on the following subjects: a) improving the film resistance by using different casting surfaces; and b) uses of the film. The resistance of the film was greatly improved by pouring the glycerine/starch solution and evenly spreading over a Teflon surface (28,60 cm x 21,30 cm). The Teflon surface allows a complete removal of the film without any point of adherence so it is not broken when removed. <br><br> As a use of the film it is proposed to make sealed bags containing soap powder measure just for a wash. The same is placed, along with clothing, inside the washing machine. At the beginning of the washing process, the plastic bag is dissolved in the water and the soap is released. The variables studied are: solubility of the bag, strength of the film (to avoid tears of the bag), storage time with the soap, amount of soap in a bag, different brands of soap powder, washing type (with or without centrifugation), water temperature washing, washing features (front-loading or higher), material from the laundry, washing duration (short, regular, long), cleaning clothes. It was found that the film is applicable as pack of soap powder for washing, dissolving completely (without leaving traces) and allowing a good washing of clothes.

INORGANIC HEAT ISOLATING PANEL: A GREEN ENGINEERING DESIGN
Roberto Carlo Soto
Academia del Perpetuo Socorro, San Juan, PUERTO RICO

The U.S. Census Bureau revealed dramatic urban expansion in the San Juan, Puerto Rico Area during the last 40 years. A statistical study was executed to evidence a significant increase in the temperatures in San Juan during this time period. To offer an alternative for reducing this impact, the investigator designed the Inorganic Heat Isolating Panel and proposed its model of implementation based on the rehabilitation of urban structures. This panel is composed of a homogeneous mixture of pollutant inorganic wastes fused at 450ºF through a manufacturing process. It was installed in the walls and ceiling of a concrete structure model in order to isolate external heat. The experimental structure model was compared to a control model and exposed for 24 hours, to test the panel’s thermal efficiency. Temperatures were recorded hourly. According to the results, concrete delays temperatures for four hours. In the experimental model, a statistically significant difference was observed between both the internal and the external temperatures with the model surface temperatures (P<0.0001) , indicating that the Inorganic H. I. Panels isolated heat from the structure. A statistical analysis using 2007 NOAA temperatures predicts that the panel is able to decrease internal temperatures significantly from the external temperatures. As a method for sustainable development, the implementation of the Inorganic H.I. Panel contributes to the collective wellbeing and safety of future generations, by offering an innovative solution of avoiding energy consumption, recycling of solid wastes, preventing pollution, and reducing the thermal impact of global warming.

STREAM CHANNEL DYNAMICS, PHASE III: MODELING PLANT SUCCESSION ASSOCIATED WITH CHANNEL DEPOSITION IN LARGO AND CARRIZO CANYONS, NORTHWEST NEW MEXICO
Shandiin Chanel Copeland
Kirtland Central High School, Kirtland, NM

Control of grazing on public lands since the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934 has benefited riparian ecosystems in much of the western United States. Phase III asks, can it be determined using GIS and vegetation data, what are the attributes of vegetation succession in Largo Canyon since 1934 and can this data be used to temporally characterize inactive channels in nearby and similar Carrizo Canyon? <br><br>The hypothesis is that there is an association between the length of time that surfaces of the Largo Canyon channel have been inactive, the position of those inactive channel surfaces relative to the current channel, and the vegetation cover that will be found there. <br><br>The hypothesis is not supported. The vegetation data used is probably not precise enough for analysis at the scale attempted in Phase III. Finer resolution data may yet support the hypothesis. <br><br>However, using the available data, the distribution of vegetation in Largo Canyon seems relatively stable across the time periods examined and the only apparent distinctiveness is the most recent time period. There does seem to be an association between grassland type land cover and channels recovering along cut bank locations. There does not appear to be associations with land cover types and locations along point bars and lateral positions to the modern channel. <br><br>The pattern in Carrizo was unexpected. Although the recent historical pattern of channel infilling is similar to Largo Canyon, the distribution of vegetation cover shows no discernable distinctiveness through time, and is statistically different than Largo Canyon.

UTILIZATION OF THE EXTRACTS OF SACCHARUM OFFICINARUM, ARTOCARPUS ALTILIS AND MUSA PARADISIACA TO CONSTRUCT BIODEGRADABLE HI-CONES FOR ALUMINUM CANS IN SUBSTITUTION OF THE TRADITIONAL PLASTIC ONES
Jose Pablo Salcedo
Colegio Maria Auxiliadora, Carolina, PUERTO RICO

This investigation attempts to fabricate biodegradable hi-cones for aluminum cans using the extracts of Saccharum officinarum, Artocarpus altilis and Musa paradisiaca. It was infer that when the extracts combine with the hydrogen peroxide, borax and starch, and it is exposed to ultra-violet light it will create a natural polymer that could be used to construct the hi-cones. To prove this, special molds were made using plaster #1 and the form of a traditional hi-cone. The extracts of the plants were prepared and chromatography for each one was done to identify the pigments and then, mix them with the chemicals mention before. Later, the mixtures were poured in the #1 plaster mold and exposed to ultra-violet light during 48 hours. Later, strength tests were performed to observe the durability of the hi-cones. In conclusion, the hypothesis was accepted because the mixture of the extracts of the three plants and the chemicals lasted seven days before it began to degrade. That is why in the future, a research will be done to determine what other chemicals can be used to help the extracts polymerized with a bigger strength, quality and durability.

Yazmin Concepcion Orozco
Colegio Maria Auxiliadora, Carolina, PUERTO RICO

The purpose of this investigation was to know if an extract prepared of the leaves of Callistemon citrinus (bottle brush) was an effective biocontrol agent of Echiornia crassipes (water hyacinths). An extract of the leaves of Callistemon citrinus was prepared with a 25% and 50% concentrations. Three groups of plants of Echiornia crassipes were used.Two of them were sprayed with the extracts : the group identify with letter B was experimental #1 and sprayed with 25% solution, the group clasified with letter C was experimental #2 and sprayed with the 50% solution. The control concentration group was spray with water and was identifying with letter A. After 20 days of continues observations it was found that the extract of Callistemon citrinus leaves is effective to stop the growth of Echiornia crassipes, so this will reduce its presence in the dams of the island, permiting the biota of those areas to flourished.

STUDY OF THE USE OF CINNAMOMUM CAMPHORA EXTRACTS AS A NATURAL INSECTICIDE TO REDUCE RETICULITERMES HAGENI PLAGUE COLONIES THAT IMPINGE ON THE MANGIFERA INDICA FRUIT
Lorianny Mendoza Rivera
Colegio Maria Auxiliadora, Carolina, PUERTO RICO

Mangifera indica (mango) crop is among the most important fruits since it is a source of dietary fiber, vitamin B-6 and its proteins’ quality. In the last five years, the amount of trees of this species has decreased in Puerto Rico and the quality of the fruit is not as good as it was a decade ago. Pollution of water bodies is one of the main factors causing these trees to develop the growth of Reticulitermes hageni plagues. This research intends to find a natural way of eliminating these species of termites while preserving the natural state of the fruit unlike pesticides do.<br><br> The Blasina Creek Watershed of Puerto Rico was selected and divided into three areas with: healthy mango trees (1st), six trees affected by termites (in each of the 2nd and 3rd areas). In each area termite colonies were counted and measured and environmental parameters were studied (water pH, turbidity, salinity, temperature and soil’s pH and salinity). Two extracts of Cinnamomum camphora were prepared at 50% and 100% concentration and sprayed weekly to three different mango trees each (located in the 2nd area). This was done for a period of two months. At the beginning and end of the research, 18 mango fruits (three per area) were submitted to a gas chromatography analysis of their chemical composition.<br><br> After completing this research, it was demonstrated that Cinnamomum camphora extracts are capable of eliminating Reticulitermes hageni plagues that affect Mangifera indica trees without causing adverse effects on the mango fruit.

ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF ENERGY-SAVING HOUSES IN THE RURAL AREAS OF SHANXI PROVINCE IN CHINA
Haoyuan Yu
The High School Affiliated to Shanxi University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, CHINA

In China, Shanxi Province is famous for its abundance of traditional folk houses. As a tourist, the author has found that traditional folk houses are warm in winter and cool in summer, but poor in lighting and ventilation. By contrast, new buildings can provide all necessary facilities but cost more energy at the same time. After traveled more than 7 thousand kilometers, the author collected 820 questionnaires, took photos of 20 typical traditional houses and sketched. The author settled down at 5 places for detailed investigation. The 4-day temperature of cave dwellings in summer are: 19-39℃ outdoors and 24-25℃ indoors. After analyzing all data, six energy-saving advantages of traditional folk houses were summarized.<br><br>Referring to the energy saving essence of traditional folk houses, the author designed a new project of energy-saving folk houses and made a corresponding model. In this project, the heat-insulating walls are made of raw soil-straw materials mixed with gangue and cinder, and the designed houses are characterized with the heating system composed of solar energy system, methane, fireplace, and the traditional soil-bed. If such a project is to be applied in the building of 128,000 new-increased houses in countryside of Shanxi Province, 512,000 tons of coal can be saved, 1,408,000 tons of CO2 and 10,200 tons of SO2 emission can be reduced each year. The paper also suggested a concept of adopting accesses for dual lighting reflection and ventilation to improve the living conditions of the underground cave dwelling.

MAKING YOUR ENEMY YOUR FRIEND: A NOVEL METHOD TO INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT(IPM) USING NOXIOUS WEED EXTRACTIONS
Jonathan Kelvin Suncar
Uniondale High School, Uniondale, NY

This investigation attempted to show if extractions from the leaves of noxious weeds can be beneficial to the agricultural industry. The potential usage of the leaves as a natural insecticide was analyzed by collecting three types of weed plants: Convolvulus arvensis (Bindweed), Agropyron repens (Quackgrass), Euphorbia esula (Leafy Spurge). The Principle investigator used common solvents such as ethanol, acetone, methanol and water, which were used to obtain the extractions using the Soxhlet Extractor. The extractor is a unique, one step process that produces a pure liquid extraction. <br><br> These liquid extracts were applied on the Myzus persicae (Green peach aphids) in sterile petri dishes to determine the impact of the extractions. The extractions were inoculated into the rhizosphere of Pisum sativum (pea plants) and applied via a fine spray onto their leaves. The rate of photosynthesis were measured to determine the effect the extracts had on the growth and development of the Pisum sativum (pea plants). <br><br> The data supported the hypothesis, showing that the extractions effectively killed the aphids. The extracts did not affect the rate of photosynthesis during the 3 week observation period. The principle investigator concluded that the Quackgrass, under the methanol extraction, and the Quackgrass, under water extraction, were superior in killing 100% of the aphids. Through this investigation it was shown that these weed extracts could be used as a natural and safe selective insecticide, and therefore, not impair the environment.

Instituto Estadual de Educacao Paulo Freire, Sao Sebastiao Do Cai, Rio Grande do Sul, BRASIL

This research is about a rubber recycling process by grinding and agglutination, aiming to reuse old tires from automobilist industry in blocks for civil construction.<br><br> These rubbers take approximately 500 years to decompose, having as consequences the damages to environment, once they generate the occupation of lots of hectares of land, or they are put into rivers and unused grounds.<br><br> The project proposes the production of rubber structures through the grinded rubber from tires and adhesives. The raw-material is added to a mechanic mixer and after the homogenization of the mixture, it is put in metal structures with caps and closed by a press in order to obtain a massive block. After two hours the rubber structure is withdrawn from the metal structure, owning its format. The rubber structures can receive several formats, like bricks, speed reducers, lane divisors, floors and etc.<br><br> The use of this material has as finality to simplify civil construction, reducing required time and construction budget, since raw-material is recycled and it has an accessible price. <br><br> The development of this research guided to conclude that the needed technology is very simple when compared with other rubber recycling technologies. Moreover, this study has proved that rubber disposal, which currently is a problem, can be transformed and become a solution for life quality.

EFFECT OF MEDIA AND SUBSTRATE ON CULTURABILITY OF OLIGOTROPHIC CAVE BACTERIA
Matthew Stephens Creamer
Tucson High Magnet School, Tucson, AZ

The development of speleothems in limestone caves is linked to the microbial community; therefore preservation of the unique ecology of caves requires knowledge of the microbes that reside there. Studying these microbes is challenging; general lab media share a common inability to culture an accurate representation of the ecological diversity in environmental bacteria samples, successfully culturing only about 1% of the total diversity. This investigation sought to determine the relationship between specific media and the culturability of oligotrophic bacteria, bacteria adapted to low nutrient environments such as caves. These bacteria are often out competed by fast growing bacteria on general lab media. Three specific media, R2A, Cave Agar, and VL55 with glucose were used to culture bacteria collected from Kartchner Caverns, Cochise County, Arizona. Isolates from each culture were phenotypically identified and the 16s rRNA genes of similar isolates were sequenced and compared. The R2A medium produced the greatest number of unique isolates, twelve, but tended to culture faster growing less oligotrophic bacteria than the other two media. Each medium supported isolates not found on the other two media suggesting that one medium is not sufficient to represent the total microbial diversity of an oligotrophic environment.

THE EFFECTS OF ARTEMIA FRANCISCANA AS AN ALTERNATIVE NITROGEN SOURCE FOR COMPOSTING BIODEGRADABLE MATERIALS
Alexa A Lunt
Orion Jr. High, Harrisville, UT

Composting is vital to solid waste management in Northern Utah. This project investigated an alternative nitrogen source necessary in the composting process. The question that the experiment addressed was: Can discarded brine shrimp be used as an alternative nitrogen source when composting biodegradable materials?<br><br>Compost piles of incremental ratios were established to test the effectiveness of brine shrimp as the nitrogen source. Five measures were used to indicate the effectiveness of brine shrimp. They were as follows: Temperature readings, odor, nitrogen residual content, plant viability, and ratios of carbon to nitrogen (Solvita). <br><br>Temperature and Solvita results indicated that active and ideal conditions were present for composting. The research showed that the ratio of brine shrimp to wood chips had an impact on the composting rate. The data also validated that brine shrimp produced a higher quality product than the control in the investigation. Further tests on the compost showed that it was a viable medium for plant growth. <br><br>Based on the data and observations collected, brine shrimp are a viable alternative to grass clipping as a nitrogen source for composting. The application for this project will assist local landfill facilities in providing a viable, inexpensive, readily available nitrogen source for composting year round. The use of brine shrimp in the composting process reduces the amount of material that local brine shrimp companies are placing in landfills. In the end, the landfill facilities, brine shrimp companies, and most importantly the environment wins.

AN INTEGRAL SYSTEM FOR ELIMINATING ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION RESULTING FROM VEHICLES
Sa'ed Younes Aldaraghmeh
King Abdullah II Schools for Excellence, Irbid, JORDAN

No one can deny the dominant role of vehicles in polluting the environment and participating in the destruction of the same, due to its poisonous gases released. This project is a trial to limit and eradicate the environmental pollution resulting from vehicles by designing a device uses the magnetic field properties, and benefiting from its effects on cars' exhaust gases. The effects of the magnetic field have been tested on different types of vehicles by the exhaust gas analyzing system (MOTORSCAN® - TOTALGAS 8070). A significant difference has been noticed on the exhaust gases especially on the unburnt hydrocarbons (HC), and carbon monoxide (CO) as well as on some nitrogen oxides. The positive effects of this process have been used to design a device to be fitted in the vehicle's exhaust tube, which acts on the exhaust gases by initiating a reaction between the components by using a special thermal heaters, after affecting it by the magnetic field to yield in a less dangerous pollutant.<br><br>The designed device has been tested on different vehicles, the results have proven the efficiency of this device, as the decreasing percentage of the dangerous CO, HC gases has been higher compared to percentages that companies try to reach while using highly expensive and complex technologies.<br><br>Using this system is very economic and environment-friendly, in addition to its constant high efficiency on the long run.

BREATHE EASY: CARBON DIOXIDE IS TURNING GREEN! A DISCOVERY OF MINERAL CATALYSIS ENHANCING PHOTO-ELECTROCHEMICAL REDUCTION OF CARBON DIOXIDE TO ORGANICS
Roopa Suppiah
Mackenzie High School, Deep River, Ontario, CANADA

Carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration is considered an essential pathway for the mitigation of global warming. In this project, a method for CO2 conversion into organic compounds through photo-electrochemical reduction was developed to provide an economical process for the control of CO2 emissions. The hypothesis is that CO2, a stable compound, can be converted to useful organics even under ambient conditions. Water saturated with CO2 was electrolyzed and simultaneously exposed to Pt-TiO2 catalyst under UV radiation. Under these mild conditions, the process converted CO2 into organic compounds, yielding concentrations up to 90 ppm, and producing organics such as ethanol and ethyl acetate. This combination of electrolysis with photoreduction, a technique not yet explored in modern CO2 sequestration research, increased organic carbon concentration by 44%, compared to conditions in the absence of electrolysis. Additionally, suspending Serpentine and Olivine minerals in the reactor under photo-electrochemical reduction conditions enhanced organic carbon concentrations further. Specifically, the use of Serpentine increased organic carbon concentration by ~ 45%, compared to tests conducted in the absence of Serpentine. Both minerals, only known to form carbonates when exposed to CO2 in nature, were discovered to act as catalysts for the conversion. Serpentine and Olivine as catalytic materials could have significant applications in the search for an economical method for CO2 sequestration, potentially providing a replacement for expensive catalytic materials like platinum. These break-through findings of using Serpentine and Olivine minerals as catalysts with photo-electrochemical reduction would enable continued use of fossil fuels but with reduced environmental impact.

SALTY SOLUTIONS: A STUDY OF SALINITY LEVELS AND MORTALITY RATE OF PARAMECIUM CUADATUM
Ellen J McDevitt-Stredney
Buckeye Valley High School, Delaware, OH

Brine is a salt solution that is sprayed on roads during winter every time a threat of a storm occurs. The brine has 91 pounds of salt per 40 gallons of water that is sprayed per lane-mile. When it rains, for example a ¼ inch of rain, surface runoff may occur. Then when the saltwater solution flows into a neighboring stream or river it could be potentially harmful to the survival of the aquatic ecosystem. <br><br> Paramecium caudatum are at the base of the food chain. If they are suffering then the entire aquatic ecosystem will be affected. The study hypothesis predicted current salinity levels in brine would yield mortality effects in Paramecium caudatum. The study included three experiments to find a salt solution that when Paramecium caudatum are exposed would yield the lowest mortality rate. A series of salt solution percentages were introduced to the Paramecium caudatum cultures, observed, and tracked for mortality rates. The results indicate current percentages of salt in road brine do not affect the mortality rate. However higher concentrations, that might form on the road if there were smaller measurements of rain or from buildup, did result in a higher mortality rate. The experiment results show that the current concentration of salt in brine used on our roadways is not harmful to Paramecium caudatum. Therefore, this limited study results and analysis conclude that the current brine solution used on our roads is not a danger to aquatic ecosystems and the environment.

My hypothesis states that by reducing the amount of phosphate in water, the growth of the various Protists will be reduced. This hypothesis will be tested in this experiment. By doing this experiment, I hope to generate interest in the field of environmental protection in my area and school. The experiment will test for the growth of Euglena, and Chlamydomonas when fertilizer is added, and the growth after aluminum sulfate is added to the growth medium.

THE ANTIMICROBIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF METALLIC NANOPARTICLES AND THEIR APPLICATION IN WATER FILTRATION
Anna Shimshak
University School of Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI

Though clean water is a vital resource, 1.1 billion people living without clean water has created a global crisis, resulting in 5 million deaths and 250 million illnesses annually. This project’s objective addresses this issue by developing a portable, reusable, environmentally safe and economical water filter, employing nanotechnology, to provide a sustainable, clean water supply. The study hypothesis predicts that metallic nanoparticles will be effective antimicrobial agents for water purification since these metals are currently used in medical applications.<br><br> Experiment #1 was conducted on the k12 strain of E. coli with silver and titanium oxide nanoparticles. Standardized solutions of saline with 0.05 mL E. coli were mixed with a titrated range (0.1 gm-0.0001 gm) of each nanoparticle, plated on nutrient agar and incubated. Experiment #1 results demonstrated that silver was more effective than titanium oxide as an antimicrobial metal inhibiting k12 E. coli growth in quantities of 0.0001 gm. These results were applied to the design of a water filter, using silver nanoparticles in experiment #2. Testing was performed with a 50 cc syringe with either solutions of saline with E. coli or pond water contaminated with animal feces and agitated with 0.075 gm silver nanoparticles for 2.5 minutes. A saline-E coli solution served as a control. Each solution was filtered with a Micropore syringe filter attachment (pore size 0.22-0.45 µm). These solutions were then put through a Millipore field filter, collecting any residual bacterial contaminants in the samples on a nutrient pad, and incubated. Experiment #2 results showed that filtered saline-E. coli solutions and contaminated pond water samples exposed to silver nanoparticles resulted in no visible bacterial growth, while those solutions not exposed to nanoparticles demonstrated significant bacterial growth.<br><br> In conclusion, silver nanoparticle water filtration is effective at inhibiting bacteria growth from contaminated water samples. A silver nanoparticle water filter prototype has been designed and tested. Results will be presented.

DRAFTING AWAY
Melanie Marie Engeldinger
Elk Point-Jefferson, Elk Point, SD

The purpose of this experiment was to find out the best type of snow fence. Since living snow fences are generally less "dense" than structural snow fences, they would have to be taller in order to catch the same amount of snow as the structural snow fences described above. The density of a snow fence relates to how much wind blows through it. A snow fence with 50% density will allow half of the wind to blow through. Drift dimensions vary with the density of the fence. A barrier that is 70% porous (on average) creates an average snow deposition area 37 times the height of the barrier--downwind of the snow fence. A 10-30% porous fence would deposit snow much closer to the barrier itself--approximately 15 times the height of the snow fence. . Living snow fence barrier density is determined by the species, number of rows, spacing between rows, and spacing of plants within the row. For example, closely spaced rows trap and store less snow than more widely spaced rows. It is critical to consider winter density of vegetation, since deciduous material is much less dense in the winter. I hypothesized that if I test the different types of snow fences and their effects at keeping snow away from a house, then I will find that living fences will best keep the snow away from the house. In order to show this I made three model houses and a wind tunnel. I placed a fence in front of each house. I placed 225 mL (about 7oz) of snow. I turned on the fan for 15 seconds and measured the amount of snow between the house and fence. I recorded my data, and retested. According to this data the 50% density is the best snow fence.

GREAT INVADERS: MERCURY AMPLIFICATION AND BIOREMEDIATION THROUGH METHYLATION AND DEMETHYLATION BY ESCHERICHIA COLI AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF A BIOTIC OSMOTIC CHAMBERED MERCURY FILTERING SYSTEM
Amanda Marie Bennett
Marysville High School, Marysville, MI

The focus of this project is to assess the effects of invasive species - round gobies, zebra mussels, and quagga mussels (Neogobius melanostomus and Dreissenida polymorpha and bugensis) - on the mercury cycle in the Great Lakes, and to develop a system by which such mercury contamination can be removed in waterways all over the world. All three species mentioned were introduced via contaminated ballast water of oceangoing freighter ships, and have since become some of the most populous organisms in the Great Lakes and generating billions of dollars in damage. As a result of their success, energy shifts in food chains and webs have caused similar shifts in the mercury cycle, leading to increased mercury-related consumption advisories and re-circulation of mercury into the waterways. While removing these species has proved impractical, removing the mercury is possible with the right kind of filtration. Escherichia coli was isolated as the bacteria responsible for mercury methylation and demethylation, and was tested as such, providing a model for mercury metabolism rates over a given interval of time. This bacteria serves as the primary bioremediation source within a chambered filter system consisting of a series of graduated filters with decreasing pore sizes, each enclosing a “box” responsible for one phase of the mercury removal. As water passes through the osmotic filter chambers, dissolved solids and large compounds are removed until the water reaches a final chamber. E. coli bacteria are contained in this final chamber, and refine dissolved mercury compounds (toxic methylmercury) into elemental mercury, allowing the molecules to coagulate under water pressure and sink to the bottom of the chamber, where the mercury is contained in a sediment-filled tray. This removable tray allows the mercury to be removed from the filter and properly disposed of. In the experiment, E. coli proved to be a practical organism capable of mercury metabolism. Similar filter systems could be used in waterways virtually anywhere, and could be adopted to fit other contaminants, as well.

REDUCING ACID MINE DRAINAGE WITH FLUORIDE TREATMENT
Sara Marie Joseph
Alton High School, Alton, IL

The purpose of my experiment was to see if a fluoride treatment would decrease iron generation during the oxidization of pyrite. In doing so, can the same fluoride treatment used to give you healthy teeth reduce Acid Mine Drainage (AMD)? Pyrite is common in sedimentary rocks across the United States and throughout the world. When these rock materials are disturbed (i.e. construction, mining, and development) the impacts must be known and mitigated to prevent pollution of the environment.<br><br> <br><br>The hypothesis was when pyrite is treated with fluoride it will reduce the amount of iron generated. It was expected at the end of the experiment that the iron amount would be less in the fluoride treatments which may increase the pH and decrease the electrical conductivity (EC). The experiment was conducted by adding varying amounts of pyrite (13 treatments: 0%-50%) to a sand matrix. This matrix was initially treated with fluoride and the control treated with distilled water. The pyrite oxidized for 2 week intervals. All treatments were leached with distilled water. The leach water was tested for Total Iron, pH, and EC.<br><br> <br><br>In conclusion the hypothesis was supported. The amount of iron significantly decreased in the treated cups. The pH increased and the EC decreased in the treated cups. Iron removal was as high as 99%. This treatment method shows significant promise in the treatment of pyritic materials to reduce and possibly prevent AMD. This would significantly decrease iron loads to natural waters and thus protect stream ecosystems.

EFFECTS OF DISTURBANCE ON FOREST AND MEADOW SOIL SEED BANKS
Michella Lynn Craft
Oregon Connections Acadamy, Scio, OR

The soil seed bank can be an important source of seeds for revegetation. It can contain hundreds of seeds that may or may not be found germinating in the land above, or it may have very little to no seeds at all. Disturbance in a forest or meadow plays a part in determining which seeds are killed, and which ones survive and germinate. <br><br>I studied the role of fire, shade, and fertilizer in seed bank germination from four sites: a meadow, a 50 year old plantation, a 20 year old plantation, and a 150 year old forest. <br><br>In addition to an untreated control, I applied heat (121ºC for 15 minutes), shade (Douglas-fir branches), and 10-10-10 fertilizer to each soil type. Each site/treatment combination was replicated five times in a randomized complete block design. Seedlings were only found germinating in the meadow and 50-year-old plantation, and there was no statistically significant difference in seedling density among these two sites. There was also no statistically significant difference in seedling density among the four treatments. Six seedling types were identified. Grass seedlings were found only in the meadow soil. The 50-year-old plantation had significantly greater seedling type diversity (p=0.0013) than the meadow. While not statistically significant, the heated meadow soil did not have any grass germination, and heating soil from the 50-year-old plantation appears to have stimulated germination. Meadow soil with the fertilizer treatment grew twice as much grass compared to the meadow soil with no treatment.

THE MICROBIAL BIOCONVERSION OF SOY ISOFLAVONE THROUGH VARYING STRAINS OF SAPROPHYTIC BACTERIA
Samantha Dodbele
Hayfield Secondary School, Alexandria, VA

The introduction of foreign chemicals into aquatic environments poses a great threat to fish populations. In recent years an increased number of fish have been found with delayed sexual maturation due to semi-synthetic estrogens. To take a proactive approach in eliminating estrogen, different strains of saprophytic bacteria were used to measure their ability to reduce a semi-synthetic estrogen. This is a small-scale indicator of a solution to estrogen contamination by identifying a specific strain of bacteria that consumes Soy Isoflavone most completely.<br><br> Flavobacterium, Micrococcus, Pseudomonas, Aztobacter, and Bacillus, were introduced to different concentrations Soy Isoflavone. A test of turbidity and total dissolved solids was performed before and after bacteria was added, to find the change after 15 hours of reduction time. The data for the concentrations was found to be lower than the control in both turbidity and TDS which demonstrated that the bacteria actually had reduced the Soy Isoflavone. A t test was performed for each strain of bacteria and was found to be significant at the 0.05 level and highly significant at the 0.01 level except in one case. It also confirmed Flavobacterium as the most significant reducer since it performed the best with the lowest p value. Therefore, the original hypothesis that the strain with the strongest degradative properties will be the one whose average increase is significantly lower than the control and exhibits consistent behavior for all concentrations in both turbidity and TDS was supported and the null hypothesis was rejected. <br><br> This experiment suggests that the introduction of saprophytic bacteria into an estrogen-contaminated environment could be the ideal solution to end estrogen pollution since it is natural, inexpensive, simple, and effective.

DETERMINING THE EFFICIENCY OF BIOREMEDIATION OF ACID MINE DRAINAGE USING SULFATE-REDUCING BACTERIA
Dalene Renee Cook
Seneca High School, Seneca, MO

Acid mine drainage (AMD) caused by the abandonment of mine sites negatively affects the environment miles downstream from the contamination site. This research is an attempt to improve the existing methods in remediation of AMD using novel improvements like stirring and using an efficient carbon source of hair, chitin, or sewage for the sulfate-reducing bacteria to utilize. Part 1 results showed a significant reduction of sulfate levels in the stirring chitin group when compared to all other groups, indicating that bioremediation was most successful for that carbon source. A Part 2 experiment was conducted with modifications to Part 1. Results of sulfate and sulfide levels indicated that stirring hair was bioremediating most efficiently. After statistics were run, the stirring bioreactors were bioremediating significantly greater (p-value less than 0.0001) than the non-stirring bioreactors. The results have been very promising and indicate that stirring does aid in the bioremediation of AMD.

THE EFFECTS OF LIMESTONE ON THE PRODUCTIVITY OF AQUATIC INVERTEBRATES
Alex Graham Schnaderbeck
Sargent High School, Monte Vista, CO

Limestone has been used extensively around the world to improve aquatic environments. This project studied the effects of limestone on the productivity of aquatic invertebrates found in the Rio Grande watershed. Invertebrates of this watershed have never been exposed to limestone. This study compared growth rates of aquatic invertebrates in granite and limestone environments.<br><br> Aquatic invertebrates were collected from Road Canyon Reservoir, located 20 miles west of Creede, Colorado near the headwaters of the Rio Grande watershed. The aquatic invertebrates were divided into 9 populations; 3 control, 3 granite and 3 limestone. The controls were frozen to serve as a base weight for later comparison. The remaining invertebrates were placed in three granite tanks and three limestone tanks for 49 days. The invertebrates were then separated from the gravel substrate of each tank using soil sieves. Invertebrates were then oven-dried and weighed to determine growth.<br><br> The aquatic invertebrates in the three granite tanks averaged 18.7% growth. Aquatic invertebrates in the three limestone tanks averaged 52.0% growth. Limestone raised invertebrates had 2.78 times more growth than the granite raised invertebrates. Aquatic invertebrates from the Rio Grande watershed not only survived but actually flourished in a limestone environment.<br><br> In Colorado, limestone boulders and gravel could be used for stream improvement projects. Limestone could also play a significant role by buffering acidic watersheds damaged by active and abandoned mines. Limestone sand could also replace granite sand on heavily sanded highways where runoff of granite sand into watersheds is currently a serious problem.

WAVE GOODBYE: RESEARCH INTO WAVE DAMPENING
Annette Renee Luther
Baton Rouge Magnet High School, Baton Rouge, LA

The project concept originated with observations of wave action in nearby rivers which worsened as population density increased and solid bulkheads were added to the river banks. The high waves cause shoreline erosion on both developed and undeveloped property and increase danger to swimmers and boaters. It was hypothesized that it would be possible to design a device that would both reduce wave amplitude and cut longevity by half.<br><br> Several wave dampening devices were designed and built, including a textured surface, two shelving-type designs, a curved wall, and an expansion on the curved wall idea called the wave-trapper. A wave box with a repeatable wave generator was required for reliable testing of the devices. Video was used to capture the data for later analysis, as well as to facilitate real-time observation. The control was the flat wall at the end of the wave box. Three trials were run for each design, and the wave height data was collected periodically using the stop action capability of the video and computer. The results showed that the design goal was met when two of the five designs halved the life span of the wave and reduced amplitude. Two other designs were less effective at diminishing the wave, and one design was counter-productive. The experiment was successful and the hypothesis was proven correct in both parts.

MORTALITY RATES OF CAPSICUM FRUTESCEN BASED PESTICIDES ON DIFFERENT GENDER AND AGED ACHETA DOMESTICUS
Lacey Anne Benefiel
Sanger High School, Sanger, CA

The purpose of my experiment was to determine whether the age and gender of crickets affects the mortality rate, while comparing chile pequin to chile de arbol peppers as environmentally friendly pesticides. This information would be useful to consumers who use pepper pesticides so they would know which pesticide to choose and what dosage it would take to eliminate the entire population of pests. I tested each pesticide at a 40.81 g/L concentration. This has proven to be the most effective pesticide concentration during the past three years of my research. <br><br>I first compared the death rate of young nymph crickets to the adult crickets with each pesticide to see if either group showed greater resistance. I then compared the death rates of adult males to adult females to see if either gender showed more resistance to either pesticide. For each variable, 100 crickets were used. After experimentation and careful analysis of the data, I found that the chile de arbol pesticide showed a significant difference in the mortality rates when comparing females to males and nymphs to adults. Both the nymphs and females were more tolerant of chile de arbol, whereas the adults and males were less tolerant. When analyzing the results for chile pequin, I found no variance in mortality rates. When comparing the two pesticides directly, I found that chile pequin killed all age and gender groups more efficiently than the chile de arbol, and therefore is the best overall pesticide.

RECYCLING CARBON DIOXIDE FOR BIOFUEL PRODUCTION WITH ALGAE
Miles Vincent Barnhart
Greenwood Laboratory School, Springfield, MO

The depletion of fossil fuels is impending. The burning of fossil fuels adds CO2 to our atmosphere leading to global warming and climate change. Biofuels show potential to replace petroleum as fuel for internal combustion engines. Ideally the production and combustion of biofuels causes no net CO2 release. The use of algae shows promise for biodiesel production due to its fast growth rate and low space requirements. Moreover, algae cultures could be used to scrub the CO2 from fossil fuel burning power plants. In this project, I cultured algae and tested the effects of giving them increased amounts of CO2. I measured the rate of algae growth, the removal of CO2 by the algae, and the production of oil by the algae with and without extra carbon dioxide. Cultures receiving 2.4% CO2 had 3 times the dry mass, 4 times the oil content and 11 times higher oil production than cultures receiving only air. Cultures removed up to 12.5% of CO2 from gas that passed through the culture. Also, more CO2 when light intensity was increased. The results indicate that Neochloris can produce at least 1 gallon of oil per 20,000 gallons of culture per day under these conditions. The use of algae for CO2 scrubbing will require engineering to achieve more complete removal of CO2 from exhaust gases.

SYNTHESIS OF SILVER NANOPARTICLE-ENABLED POLYMERIC MEMBRANES FOR BIOFOULING MITIGATION
Hari Senthil Arul
Detroit Country Day School, Beverly Hills, MI

In filtration systems, biofouling remains one of the serious threats to cost and productivity, as microbes accumulate on the membrane. By adding silver nanoparticles, known biocidal agents, onto the polymeric membranes, biofouling could be mitigated. <br><br>Two methods (further referred to as “in-situ” and “ex-situ”) were used to synthesize membranes filled with silver nanoparticles. In the ex-situ method, the nanoparticles were prepared as an organic sol prior to membrane casting in the same solvent used to dissolve the membrane polymer. In the in-situ method, silver nanoparticles were produced by reducing ionic silver dissolved in the polymer casting mixture during the membrane casting process. Ultrafiltration (UF) and microfiltration (MF) membranes were created, and Escherichia coli was used to biofoul the membranes. A protein assay characterized the bacterial growth on each membrane. <br><br>The protein assay showed that silver membranes did significantly reduce biofouling, and the in-situ membranes exhibited higher biocidal activity than ex-situ membranes due to the smaller size and higher number of silver nanoparticles in its nanocomposite structure. Also, with the increase in porosity from UF range to MF range, bacterial growth became more pronounced. Preliminary replenishment strategies showed potential in incorporating new silver into membranes via delayed nucleation.

PECAN ELIXIR: A NATURAL HERBICIDE
Minda Chelsea Backus
Beaufort Academy, Beaufort, SC

While walking around in my grandparent’s yard I have always been curious to why pecan trees never have any kind of growth underneath them. I found out during my research that pecan trees produce a chemical known as juglone, which is naturally present in pecan trees. This chemical, juglone, is found in nut hulls, leaves, roots, bark, and the stems of the tree. Is it possible that the same toxin that causes plants not to thrive under pecan trees can be used on other unwanted plants or weeds?<br><br> I collected the outer hulls of the pecans with some leaves and stems. I filled a big pot halfway full with water, added the hulls, leaves and stems. I boiled it for about forty-five minutes to an hour. A brownish colored elixir was formed to make a natural herbicide. I then used this pecan elixir to test other plants to see if this naturally made herbicide would kill plants as well as two commercial herbicides, Spectracide and Roundup.<br><br> My results concluded that over a period that the Spectracide and Roundup started taking effect much sooner than the pecan elixir. The plants were turning brown; stems were droopy and the leaves would curl at a faster pace, whereas the plants treated with the pecan elixir took longer to show decay. My hypothesis was supported because the natural herbicide did work, even though it took a little bit longer than the commercial herbicides.

EFFICACY OF STRATEGIES FOR REMOVAL OF EUONYMUS FORTUNEI TO AID IN THE RESTORATION OF THE BLUEGRASS WETLAND
Emily Randall Colclough
Sayre School, Lexington, KY

This experiment determined the best removal method of Euonymous fortuneii, aiding in the restoration of the Bluegrass Wetland at the University of Kentucky Arboretum. E. fortuneii is an invasive species in the wetland, which is rapidly destroying the natural habitat for many plants and animals. I hypothesize that hand pulling will be more effective than application of any of 3 types of herbicides in the removal of the invasive species while protecting existing native species.<br><br> In July of 2006, I divided an area invaded with E. fortuneii into five 3’ by 5’ plots and applied four methods of removal; Burn-Out II (organic weed killer), hand-pulling, Round-Up Pro, and Garlon weed killer. The untouched plot was the control plot. Since the initial treatments, there have been two periods of weekly observation and data collection: one from July 2006 to February 2007 and the other from September 2007 to April 2008. Data taken from the latter was after the 2007 growing season, which occurred from April to September, allowing E. fortuneii to regrow.<br><br> All E. fortuneii returned in 2007 with Burn-Out use, allowing no native plant growth. The hand-pull method had 5% of E. fortuneii regrow, but also had native plant growth. Round-Up allowed only 15% E. fortuneii regrowth and no native plant growth. Garlon allowed no E. fortuneii, resulting in more native plant growth.<br><br> Handpulling was more effective after the first growing season, but the long term results are different. Garlon proved to be the most effective method of removal after the second growing season because there was native plant growth with no E. fortuneii regrowth.

ECOLOGY OF LICHENS IN URBAN AND NATURAL LANDSCAPES OF GORNY ALTAY
Marat Rafisovich Khaydarov
Gymnasium #3, Gorno-Altaysk, Republic Altay, RUSSIA

Now full enough list of species of lichens of Republic Altai is known. On studying distribution of lichens depending on conditions of environment in territory of republic at present it is not enough researches. This research supplements messages on a site of some species of lichens in territory of republic. The basic part of research is directed on studying of inf1uence of a degree of pollution air environment on growth and distribution of lichens. Identification of specific structure of lichen-f1ora occurred by means of a guidebook (Abramov 1978). Thallome disturbance sign inspection on territory of dwelling parts of urban landscapes has been carried out by means of special table (Ashikhlina 2000). Also relative density of epiphyte lichens was estimated (Bondaruk, Kovylina 2006). Researcher puts flexible ruler with millimeter scale on a tree trunk and figures out all the spots where lichens' thallomes intersect ruler line. It is as a result found out, that area around central boiling station of the city there is “lichen desert” and concentration of sulphur dioxide in the air exceeds 0,3 mg/m3. Multistories area represents “depression zone” for lichens. The concentration of sulphur dioxide here ranges between 0,05 and 0,3 mg/m3. Parks and squares area is a transitional zone between “depression zone” and “zone of normal life”. The concentration of sulphur dioxide ranges between 0,05 and 0,3 mg/m3.

APPLICATION OF CLIMATIC FACTORS OF THE NORTH FOR INCREASING ECOLOGICAL EFFICIENCY OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT IN DIAMOND-MINING BRANCH OF THE WESTERN YAKUTIA
Anastasya Sergeevna Alyabyeva
Secondary School #12, Mirny, Republic Yakutia, RUSSIA

The given work represents the result of experiments carried out with samples of turnaround technological waters of concentrating factories of the diamond-mining branch for the purpose of revealing technologically useful influences of low ambient temperatures on products of processing mineral raw material, and in particular, diamond containing kimberlitic ores. Initial idea was to define an opportunity of using natural cold during the winter period for clearing industrial sewage. During researches within the limits of the set direction it was supposed to prove decrease in loading on an environment due to an intensification of work of industrial sewage sediment bowls (pulp storages) of concentrating factories. The results received during realization of the scientific project, have allowed to calculate on the basis of experimental data reduction of volumes of not used technological turnaround water due to increase of density of deposits after freezing. The given work has essential value for increase of efficiency and quality of wildlife management in the mining industry working in conditions of easily destabilized ecology of the Far North regions. On the one hand, in work the opportunity of decreasing in loading on an environment due to increasing efficiency of already existing objects of the mining industry is shown. On the other hand, work proves, that ecologically orientated activities increasing efficiency of use of existing technologies, is not necessarily interfaced to the additional essential charges raising the cost price of production as allows to apply territorial, or, more precisely, climatic advantages of manufacture location.

DEVELOPMENT OF A MANAGEMENT-FOCUSED, ENVIRONMENTAL SIMULATION ENGINE FOR ELEPHANT-VEGETATION DYNAMICS OF THE KRUGER NATIONAL PARK, SOUTH AFRICA
Rohit Thummalapalli
American Heritage School, Plantation, FL

A “wicked” environmental challenge facing the Kruger National Park, South Africa, is that higher levels of elephant (Loxodonta africana) densities have lead to reductions of levels of specific woody tree patch densities, signaling an increase in KNP vegetation homogeneity. Therefore, as part of the worldwide elephant modeling program within the KNP-EMG, the objective of this project is to create a simplified, management-focused, visual simulation of the Kruger National Park in order to chart potential elephant, fire, tree, and grass scenarios. QnD:EleSim has been designed to spatially simulate elephant-vegetation-fire dynamics in 195 linked spatial units at 10 km2 resolution at a monthly time-step. Four population classes of woody plants (seedlings, saplings, shrubs and trees) were used to simulate population and cover while one grass layer class was used to simulate biomass and cover, practical simplifications of previous savanna simulation schemes. Elephants are simulated as both free-moving agents and metapopulations moving through rule-based logic, random walks or time-series input maps; fire dynamics are simulated in a similar fashion via rule-based algorithms. As hypothesized, the model was constructed and its grass and woody tree components were successfully validated against historical KNP data, with R2 goodness of fit values of 0.923 and 0.899, and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients of ecological efficiency values of 0.772 and 0.554, respectively. Future management decisions such as a decrease of elephant densities to an average of 0.41 elephants/km2 and an increase in fire ignitions to an average of 2.98% cells burnt/month effectively modeled practical solutions (and potentially implemented management strategies) for the KNP’s ongoing biodiversity challenges.

Bemisia tabaci is a pest agricultural crops because it transmits viral diseases. For its control, producers used chemical insecticides, which cause pollution problems to the environment and insect resistance. An alternative is to use insecticides vegetables. The “Guajillo” chili Capsicum annuum has been used to control insect pests. This experimental work was evaluated insecticidal activity of capsaicine active ingredient in chili. The methodology was to get the ethanol extract of the veins-seeds from chili through its concentrate and later drag by steam distillation. This procedure was reproduced again, but now for a rustic process. The first application of this extract (500 ml/50 Lts water/1 Lt of pulp Opuntia robusta) when found evidence of the presence adult insect in crops. The second and third application of the extract to 15 and 36 days after the first. The reply variables were the growth of the plant and the time it takes insecticide to eliminate pest. Further observations were conducted on the health of people who applied the botanical insecticide. As results, better growth in the red tomato, followed by green tomato and zucchini. The total elimination of the adult insect is to record an average of 2.5 minutes in the three crops of the subsequent application of the extract. As for the health of producers not observe any discomfort during and after the three applications. In conclusion veins-seeds of chili “Guajillo” are toxic adults whitefly. Further was to add the cost of ethanol extract was 3 US dollars so rustic process.

I took up the study “Fusarium pallidoroseum: Can it Control Water Hyacinth?” to find out the most efficient method of biological control of water hyacinth using Fusarium pallidoroseum in the management of the weed from the water bodies of Kerala, India. Water hyacinth [Eichhornia crassipes (Martius) Soms – Laubach] is a pernicious aquatic weed seen all over the world. Management of this weed can be taken up by physical, chemical or biological means. The most widely followed practice is manual collection and destruction, which is not very successful as the weed multiplies very fast. Herbicidal destruction is not feasible in most cases because of the pollution problems and the expense involved. Thus, biological control is an attractive alternative. Initially, laboratory and glass house studies conducted by me during the study (in the Department of Plant Pathology, College of Agriculture, Vellayani, Kerala, India) indicated the possibility of using the fungal pathogen of the weed, F. pallidoroseum, as a biocontrol agent. The results of the study also proved that the fungus is non pathogenic to crop plants, insects of the locality and hence is safe to be used as a bio-control agent. However, a major problem encountered in the large scale use of the fungus under field conditions was its low rate of infectivity on grown up healthy plants. This problem was overcome by pretreatment of the weeds with Cashew Nut Shell Liquid (CNSL) a byproduct of the cashew processing industry. CNSL being a product of plant origin does not cause any pollution problem. Further it is cheap and locally available in Kerala. A wettable powder formulation of the fungus was prepared using Mycelium, Talc, Sucrose, Tween80, Glycerol and this formulation was used for field application. Large scale field trial was conducted at Ambalathara, Trivandrum, Kerala, India. The results of the trial clearly proved the efficacy of the biological of management of water hyacinth by spraying CNSL at 5% followed by the wettable powder formulation of the fungus Fusarium pallidoroseum at 5%.

GHOST NETS: BIODEGRADABLE OR NOT? TESTING OF AGAVACEAE FIBERS, PART II
Rachel Marie Lopez
Rio Rancho High School, Rio Rancho, NM

In the oceans of the world, marine-life is being killed due to the overwhelming problem of ghost nets, which are lost or abandoned fishing gear. In last year’s experiment, yucca was found to have the least percentage of strain, which is the change of length as a percentage of original length, compared to hemp and nylon. In the excitement of finding that yucca might be a biodegradable material to replace environmentally harmful fishing gear, a decision was made to determine which type of yucca would be the best candidate. It was hypothesized that if soapweed yucca, palm yucca, and Joshua tree yucca strands were submerged in seawater and tested for their strength and strain, then the soapweed yucca strands would be strongest and have the least percentage of strain. It was found that all of the materials showed signs of biodegradation. The percentage of strain rates for strands submerged in seawater and distilled water were 1.1%/day and 0.9%/day, respectively. All yucca strands were comparable in their percentage of strain which did not support the hypothesis. Palm yucca strands appear to be the best candidate to replace the fishing material. The palm yucca fibers are easier to extract, the percentage of strain was comparable, and the strands held the most weight on average in the fourth week. These results did not support the hypothesis. Hopefully, yucca can be shown to be a viable yet sustainable material to replace nonrenewable material used in fishing gear, therefore saving marine-life.

ECOLOGICAL BIOREMEDIATION OF ICTALURUS PUNCTATUS AQUACULTURES AND ITS EFFECT ON THE GLUCOSE CONCENTRATION OF RHIZOPHORA MANGLE
David Salomon Akinin
Dr. Michael M. Krop Senior High School, Miami, FL

Ictalurus punctatus, or catfish, pollute their ecosystems by producing too much organic waste that they can’t get rid of later. This floating excrement reduces the Biological Oxygen Demand and Chemical Oxygen Demand of the water in which those vertebrates subsist, in turn establishing a less habitable area. <br><br> To act as ecological bioremediators, twenty small Rhizophora mangle, or red mangroves, were introduced into this environment. By floating them on Styrofoam on the surface of an Ictalurus punctatus cultivating tank with their roots submerged under water, the change in the dissolved oxygen concentration was measured as it affected the BOD and COD of the ecosystem. The results were then compared to those of a tank without floating plants and it was found that the former provided a more efficient resolution to pollution. The COD decreased as apparent in the water’s lowering of turbidity levels and the BOD decreased as apparent in increasing mg/L of dissolved oxygen- actually, Tank A had a rate of change of dissolved oxygen concentration 17.47 times greater than that of Tank B. After replicating the experiment, even better results were obtained as the rate of chnage was over 27 times greater in Tank A than B. In addition, using a glucose refractometer, we found the mangle’ glucose concentration to increase by 1.5° Bx RDS, over 50% of the original concentration present in the plants' leafs, showing that there existed a mutuallistic relationship between the mangles and the tank environment. As the mangle remediated the water system, they became more productive.<br><br> The Everglades report low values of dissolved oxygen, levels at which a fish kill is possible. Florida could plant more extensively along fish cultivating environments to remediate their pollution, at the same time as creating a greener and more productive habitat and merging the fish cultivating and plant cultivating industries of the world. Furthermore, as a substitute to ethanol fuel, the cellulose byproduct of this experiemnt could be used under high pressurised systems that are being developed to make biofuel- a potential solution to our ethernal energy crisis...

CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE UNMARKETABLE AVOCADO HASS (PERSEA AMERICANA MILL.) SEED: PROPOSAL OF POTENTIAL POSSIBLE AGRO-INDUSTRIAL INTEGRAL USES
Pamela Barraza
Tecnologico de Monterrey Campus Guadalajara, Zapopan, Jalisco, MEXICO

Mexico is the first world-producer of avocado (Persea americana Mill.) Hass; however only the eatable part of the fruit has been consumed wasting the seed which represents 15% to 16% of the fruit (Pahua, et al., 2007). The purpose of this study was the determination of the chemical composition of the unmarketable avocado seed and adequate agro-industrial uses for it. If the most abundant components in avocado seed are the carbohydrates and phenols, then it was studied its raw material potential for ethanol and antioxidants. For this purpose, oils were hexane extracted, carbohydrate content was obtained by processes like steam explosion and acid extraction, phenol content was determined with the Stiasny reaction and reducing sugars were quantified with Fheling reaction. Finding 60% moisture, and in dry matter 0.9% of oils, 73% of starch in steam explosion analysis, 2.5% in phenol content and 2.4% of reducing sugars. The quality of the products was determined by tests such as Folin-Ciocalteu reagent assay for antioxidant activity and ethanol obtention by seed fermentation. Obtaining 15.67 mg/g ± 0.0567of phenol activity and 2o alcohol in 186 ml. Based on the findings of this study, the propose of agro-industrial uses for the avocado seed is to extract oil followed by an unexpected emulsion found, then antioxidants and finally ethanol in that order, all of them with further analysis potential. The contributions of this project are the chemical composition of the unmarketable avocado Hass seed cultivated in Mexico data and the agro-industrial uses propose of it.

A PILOT PLANT TO MINIMIZE POLLUTION BY HEAVY INDUSTRIES
Leen Jamal Abdul - Jalil, Maria Gharaibeh, 
Modern Montessori School, Amman, JORDAN

The growing concern about problems relating to pollution has made it necessary that we base our project on finding practical means by which toxic fumes released by heavy industries can be reduced.<br><br>Our research is divided into two main parts; the first concerns running a series of tests that would enable us to calculate the amounts of bases needed to neutrlize the acidic gases released by the combustion of the fuel in heavy industries. The second part involves using the data obtained in order to design a device which would effectively reduce the percentage acidity of the smoke as well as the soot particulates formed from the combustion of fuel.<br><br>the system which we designed is divided into three main units, in the first unit, powdered base is injected so as to neutralize sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxiddes; while in the second reactor, aqueous ammonium hydroxide is used to neutralize oxides of carbon, it also reacts with residual sulfur dioxide which had not reacted in the previous unit. In the final chamber, a specially designed percipitator is used in order to remove the soot particulates.<br><br>upon the completion of the device, we visited the factory and attached our system to one of its chimneys. This enables us to test the device and measure its efficiancy. Our calculations proved that the system is 83 percent efficiant. Tests may, however, still be needed to ensure that the device is suitable for commercial application, including finding alternative, more environmentally friendly methods of powering the system.

PROTECTING CHILDREN FROM AIR POLLUTION
Kristi Dode, Jona Basha, 
Private Turgut Ozal High School, Tirana, ALBANIA

This project deals with preventing the effects of air pollution on children’s health as a result of heavy traffic . The preliminary idea was to detect the rates of air pollution above the ground level. All these led in the intent of our research: Though air pollutants are distributed in the whole environment, the greatest amount is accumulated near the ground surface.<br><br> Pollution rates were determined by 2 different methods. Firstly with a simple experiment kit that have been designed ,we made observations. Then we used passive sampling method with simple diffusion tubes containing a coating of triethanolamine. On the sideways of 3 different streets 6 of these tubes were located. 4 weeks later the tubes were sent to laboratory analysis. <br><br> After the proof, we worked on a solution to the problem: A designed apparatus in which we used various liquids including sea water. By using the pressure each vehicle exerts on the pump of the system, polluted air from the street is directed to pass through the liquid. The remaining part is a chemical reaction of dissolving gases in water which was measured by chemical methods.<br><br> The conclusive idea is that being environmentally unprotected, children are affected from air pollution more than adults. One way to prevent this is to nestle the babies while walking through polluted regions, so by increasing their distance with the ground surface where pollutants are predominant, we can decrease their possibility to have respiratory problems. And some precautions must be taken to protect them.

RE-USE OF TYRES
Bradley Pieter Rautenbach, Sean Daly, 
St Johns College, Johannesburg, Gautang, SOUTH AFRICA

Rubber is widely used in today’s world. Its uses include: piping, mats, conveyor belts etc. Its largest use is for tyres. About 50% of all rubber produced is for tyres.<br><br>Rubber is a serious problem because: people burn tyres and hazardous gases are released into the atmosphere. Large piles of tyres become breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Recycling and disposal of tyres is a major problem. Cost-effective housing is also high priority in South Africa. We decided that old tyres could be re-used for cheap, effective roof tiles and mulch, thus helping to reduce the effects of both of the above-mentioned problems.<br><br>Research was done on how tyres are currently being re-used. We decided to develop designs for roof tiles. The process included: roof tile shape, positioning of the tiles and the angle of the roof. Fire preventive solutions were tested and then the affect of these retardants on the strength of the tyres and how they insulated the roof was analyzed. A viable way to commercialize the product was also found. <br><br>Fire retardants helped to prevent the burning of the tiles and did have an effect on the strength of the rubber. The fire retardant that prevented the burning process the best also increased the rubber’s strength. The rubber mulch proved to be even more effective in retaining water in the soil than other well-known mulches.<br><br>Tyres can be used to the benefit of the community. This will alleviate the problems of excess old tyres and low cost housing.

PHYTOREMEDIATION: THE EXTRACTION OF ARSENIC IN CONTAMINATED SOIL THROUGH THE USE OF FERNS
Savannah Shaw, Heather Nielsen
The Villages Charter High School, The Villages, FL

The purpose of this project is to extract arsenic from contaminatd soil through the use of the Nephrolepis Cordefolia and the Pteris Quadriaurita through phytoremediation. Through this process by using ferns as an extractor it will show how phytoremediation works through ferns.<br><br> Our procedure involved many steps. First we researched arsenic, phytoremediation, and ferns. Next, we located areas with contaminated soil. Then we contacted a laboratory to ask for specifications on collecting samples. We then collected soil samples from four locatins and a control area. Then we tested the collected samples and recorded the amount of arsenic already present. Next, we gathered two different ferns. While gathering the ferns, we asked for facts on where they were previously grown. Then we planted the ferns in contaminated soil. After five weeks, we tested the plants to see if they accumulated arsenic. At the same time, we re-tested the soil to see if the arsenic level was reduced.<br><br> The results for this experiment showed that the levels of arsenic significantly decreased as the process of phytoremediation took place through the ferns and soil. The ferns extracted the arsenic fromt he contaminated soil, thus decreasing the amount of arsenic left in the testing site. Out of the Nephrolepis Cordefolia and the Pteris Quadriaurita, the Nephrolepis Cordefolia worked best at extracting arsenic from the soil. It showed that more arsenic was drawn and collected in the fern than the Pteris Quadriaurita.

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BIOREMEDIATION AND BIOSTIMULATION ON OIL SPILL RECOVERY
Cassandra C. Okoye, Garrett W. Breaux, 
Ovey Comeaux High School, Lafayette, LA

Oil transformations in the marine environment start to develop in the initial seconds of the oil’s contact with water. The speed of these transformations depends on the properties and composition of the oil, the parameters of the actual oil spill, and the environmental conditions. Since oil spills of a coastal zone are difficult to clean up, implementing an efficient method is important. <br><br> The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of salinity, bioremediation, and biostimulation on the degradation of oil. Water samples were collected from 6 sites ~ 4 miles apart (increasing salinity levels) along Bayou Terrebonne near Montegut, LA. Parameters collected at each site were: pH, temperature, turbidity, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen. Three methods were implemented to show the amount of degradation by enzymes produced by microbes. Six water samples and two controls (purchased bacteria and distilled water) were investigated and repeated in triplicate. Method 1: Circular discs soaked in each sample were placed in the center of an agar plate covered with oil. The percent of disappearance of oil was observed and recorded for ten days. Method 2: Oil and water samples were mixed together. Observations and mass were recorded over a thirty-day period in each sample. Method 3: Oil and water samples were mixed together. Water samples and controls were subjected to different conditions: distilled water, 500. ppm, and 5000. ppm agricultural fertilizer solution (with and without aeration). Observations and volume of remaining oil were recorded over a thirty-day period.<br><br> Statistical calculations were performed using EXCEL and p < 0.05 were considered to be significant. The results confirmed the presence of microbes readily able to degrade the oil; however, at medium salinity levels showed a significant difference of degradation. Lastly, the use of biostimulation revealed a significant difference in the degradation using a 5000. ppm nutrient solution at any salinity level.

DOES BLACK AND GOLD POLLUTION MEDIA CONTROL AFFECT THE LEVELS OF POLLUTANTS OF WATER AFTER BEING FILTERED THROUGH A RAIN GARDEN?
Sean Donald Amirzadeh, Thomas Kiggen, 
Lake Brantley High School, Altamonte Springs, FL

A typical method of filtering storm run off water would be through the use of rain gardens. Using the roots of specifically chosen plants, water becomes sterile before it enters the aquifers. Through the rains circuit to the aquifer, it accumulates many potentially harmful substances that eventually descends into the aquifer. <br><br> In this research, we designed two similar rain gardens with similar volumes, the one difference was the addition of Black and Gold pollution media control to one. The Black and Gold substance was designed by UCF to remove phosphorus, more specifically ortho, dissolved, and total phosphorus, from water. In order to construct a rain garden, first a hole must be dug, then add the reservoir at the bottom, and then soil must be mixed with organic matter and placed back into the ground, loosing the soil and providing a fertile foundation for the plants. Plants then must be put into place; we chose plants native to Florida with varying amounts of water needed to sustain life. <br><br> Our experiment was to pollute the tops of the gardens with fertilizer, and then proceed to water the garden, thus testing the capabilities of the garden, and delivering a sample in our reservoirs for us to run tests on. With the results, we can effectively see if the addition of the Black and Gold material is helpful or not. If it is proven effective, then the Black and Gold substance can be sold at retail to anyone wishing to build a better rain garden.

THE EFFECTS OF CONTROLLED CLIMATES ON CHLOROPHYLL PRODUCTION AND LIFESPANS OF HELICONIAN LEPIDOPTERA
Stephanie Robyn Seman, Layne McBeath, 
Burkburnett High School, Burkburnett, TX

The purpose of this project was to determine the effects of a controlled climate on the plants and animals of an environment. We hypothesized that plants would produce a higher concentration of chlorophyll and that the life spans of butterflies would increase in a stable, temperature controlled conservatory. <br><br>Chlorophyll levels were determined by the amount of light absorbance in a liquid sample by use of a spectrophotometer. The plants were ground up and placed in an acetone solution to obtain to chlorophyll, then observed in the spectrophotometer. <br><br>The butterflies were tagged using acrylic paint, color coded to distinguish the date tagged. The specimens were then collected on a daily basis and the life spans were calculated in terms of days.<br><br>Both hypotheses proved correct. The weighted averages of chlorophyll production in all samples confirmed this: Vervain 0.234 to 0.205, Pink Evening Primrose 0.467 to 0.174, and Frogfruit 0.323 to 0.311. For the second experiment, life spans of all three species exceeded the projected 14 days. The Julia Heliconian (D. julia) lived an average 27.5 +/- 14.7 days, the Zebra Longwing (H. charithonia) was at 21.6 +/- 14.9 days, and the Polydamas Swallowtail (B. polydamas) had an average lifespan of 17.9 +/- 14.5 days. <br><br>Further experimentation would include the testing of different plants to confirm the hypothesis to be true for other native species as well as testing more butterflies with the chance of a greater return rate.

AN ANALYSIS OF PREDATOR-PREY MACROINVERTEBRATE INTERACTIONS ON SCANLON CREEK WITH THE USE OF A RAIN GARDEN TO DIMINISH THE IMPACT OF URBAN ROAD RUN-OFF, PHASE II
Sara Anne Gleason, Logan Pallin, 
Cloquet Senior High School, Cloquet, MN

Rain gardens, an impervious pavement runoff treatment, have been shown to help minimize the affects of road run-off. Road run-off can lead to high levels of embeddedness. Embeddedness rates the degree to which sediment covers the stream bottom. The questions are: what affect does a functioning rain garden have on the overall health of a trout stream, macroinvertebrate predator/prey interactions, and if hester-dende samplers can be modified and used to predict the effects of construction and subsequent road run-off. The first hypothesis is: if a functioning rain garden is used water quality will be positively affected, and modified Hester-dende samplers will be able to predict the impact of road run-off. Continued monitoring of Scanlon Creek, a fresh water trout stream, was done. Samples were taken from a ten meter reach before and after a rain garden construction site with road run-off entry. During the sampling period a large mammal burrowed into the garden’s clay berm, impairing the rain garden. Repairs were then made. To simulate an impaired rain garden, hester-dende samplers were modified. All stream water quality variables were measured between the functioning garden and impaired rain garden, as well as, with the modified hester-dende samplers. Sampling was done over a five month period. The original hypotheses were supported; the repaired rain garden had a positive affect on temperature, discharge, pH, conductivity, FBI, macroinvertebrate density, FBI/predation, and diversity of food processing groups. Also, modified hester-dende samplers appear to predict the future impact of construction generated road run-off, and subsequent embeddedness.

The purpose of this project was to determine if riparian strips will impede phosphate contamination of water bodies adjacent to pastures treated with poultry litter used as fertilizer.<br><br>Cowpea and foxtail millet plants were separately planted in 96 flats. The equivalent of 0, 2, 4, and 6 tons per hectare of litter was applied to the flats. The same amount was applied to 16 flats, which had no plants. Laboratory tests were performed on plant tissue, soil, and water to determine phosphate presence.<br><br>Overall test results for flats following 8 weeks of treatment were as follows: cowpea plant tissue 0.23 ppm and foxtail millet 0.23 ppm, cowpea soil 889 ppm and foxtail millet 911 ppm, cowpea water 263 ppm and foxtail millet 220 ppm. There was a significant difference between the cowpea and foxtail millet samples for the 4 ton equivalent in the water phosphate test using a t-Test: Paired Two Sample for Means.<br><br>In conclusion, the data suggest that foxtail millet, with chicken litter applied at the 4 ton rate, reduced phosphates from entering the waterways the best (p<0.01). Therefore, the best plant model for the riparian strip would be foxtail millet.

THE BIOCHEMICAL DETOXIFICATION OF HEAVY METALS AND ITS APPLICATION TO THE WATER-SOIL ENVIRONMENT IN THE AGRICULTURAL WETLANDS OF THE PEARL RIVER DELTA, CHINA
Yang Guo, Junhong Wu, Sisi Yu
Foshan NO.2 High School, Foshan, Guangdong, CHINA

The conventional remediation methods for the direct removal of heavy metals from the water-soil environments were discarded. The adsorption and desorption property and the bioavailability of heavy metals in the wetlands were concentrated, and then the novel, feasible way to the detoxification of heavy metal were aimed for environmental protection. Pb, Cd and Hg were selected as the model heavy metals in the experiments. The changes of the contents of heavy metals in vegetables were examined in order to trace and show the changes of heavy metals in the soils. The experiments were carried out with the synergic methods of microbes and acid-base buffering. The results showed that Azotobacter chroococcum(A.ch) was the dominant target microbe, and be adapted to the environment of the wetlands in the Pearl River Delta. There were the cooperation effects of A. ch and the white lime, which might lead to the low uptake of crops for heavy metals. Compared with the control experiments, the contents of Pb in the crops decreased 81.6%, 63.0% and 67.2% under the ridged, half flooded and long-term flooded farmlands respectively, and those of Cd in the crops decreased 45.4%, 40.0% and 48.9%. Hg was the effect of different environments. It can be seen that the synergic application could inhibit the frequent transport of heavy metals in the wetlands effectively. Thus, the work might provide a new sight for the planting of the pollution-free vegetables, which might be worthy of the larger application and spread with high economical values.

RECICLO: PAVEMENT CERAMIC PIGMENTATION WITH USED ZN/MNO2 BATTERIES
Camila da Silva Bruzadelli, Alan Juliano de Andrade, Deborah Asbahr
Centro Paula Souza - ETEC Trajano Camargoa, Limeira, Sao Paulo, BRASIL

In Brazil, used domestic batteries are discarded in large scale, which are sent to sanitary landfills and incinerator-works. Disposal of batteries in domestic garbage is inadequate and extremely preoccupant since it aggravates the environment pollution by constant action of acid rains over its metallic covering and consequently electrolyte melting containing metals. This project aims to propose a chemical treatment methodology for electrolyte of wasted batteries type Zn/MnO2 (LECLANCHÈ), common in urban garbage, and application of the resulting material as pigment for glazed ceramic finishing. In this study, Zn/MnO2 batteries, type “AA” were manually disassembled to separate into: 1-cardboard; 2-plastic; 3-metallic zinc; 4-electrolyte; 5-steel and 6-graphite. Cardboard, plastic, metallic zinc, steel and graphite can be reused and/or recycled with pre-existing methods. Electrolyte processing was achieved through chemical treatment with nitric acid, followed by simple filtration and posterior neutralization triggering a precipitation of the metals in hydroxides. The obtained hydroxides showed Mn(OH)2 darker color, then were heated at 1000oC during 4h to be converted in metallic oxides and after that were added in several proportion (from 4 to 16% in mass) to the applied transmitter over ceramic base and submitted to rotating heating until 1000oC during 20 minutes to get the final glazed ceramic. The obtained samples showed a light rose color similar to those in industrial inorganic pigments based on manganese oxides. The application over ceramic bases, with 4%(m/m) of oxides, from the batteries, showed a lighter color when compared to those with application of 8-16% (m/m). However, the samples with application of 16% (m/m) of the obtained material showed a more intense coloration compared to samples with applications of 4 and 8% (m/m), but also showed fewer adherences to the ceramic base. The samples obtained with application of 8% (m/m) showed an intermediary intense coloration, but a satisfactory adherence and appearance from a commercial and aesthetic standpoint. Based on these results, we suggest the proposed method as a treatment process of the electrolyte of wasted batteries and the utilization of proportions of oxide-transmitter of up to 8% (m/m) for application as pigment in glazed ceramic finishing.

A BIOGEOGRAPHICAL MODEL FOR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEMUR AND CANARIUM IN THE MADAGASCAR RAINFOREST
Alix Elaine Simnock, Talia Arnow, 
Fox Lane High School, Bedford, NY

There is a relationship between Canarium and Lemur in the Madagascar Rainforest. Canarium provide pili nuts for the Lemur’s consumption, while the Lemur disperses the Canarium stones. They also both play key roles in the intricate food web of this biome. Madagascar has an extremely diverse and endemic ecology, but it is threatened by deforestation leading to a loss of biodiversity. By mapping the distributions of both genus and comparing their relationship to the geographical conditions of Madagascar, the areas most in need of conservation can be located- the regions where the two genus coccur.<br><br>Using ArcView G.I.S. 3.2, Microsoft Excel and Google Earth the collections of Canarium were edited and their distributions were mapped. The area most in need of conservation is the eastern coast of Madagascar in the humid bioclimate, with basement rock and low altitude. This is significant because it means that this endemic biome can be conserved, and determines a model to preserve other threatened biomes by locating the organisms that dominate the food web, and conserving their shared habitat.

DOES GANODERMA LUCIDUM AFFECT AGROBACTERIUM C58 TUMOR DEVELOPMENT IN CARROTS?
Alba Gardenia Sebastian, Raymond Hernandez, 
Mesa High School, Mesa, AZ

The project is about Ganoderma lucidum, a mushroom, to find the affects of tumor growth in carrots from Agrobacterium C58 infections. The goal is to reduce or stop the Agrobacterium C58 from infecting the carrot by using a Ganoderma lucidum mushroom mix. Since people claimed that Ganoderma lucidum is anti-tumor. With that being said if a mushroom can prevent tumor from people then maybe it can prevent tumor on carrots as well.There were four different ways that the mushroom was used to find the affects from carrots having the Agrobacterium C58 infections. The mushroom was being tested to see how long it can stop or it slowed down the bacteria from spreading over the carrot disks. The mushroom seemed to take time and growth among the carrots. The tumors developed small bumps into bigger size with different colors. In the group, the mushroom and agar were mixed together showed results with Agrobacterium C58 infecting. In the group with the mushroom mix on the carrot disk before the bacteria showed that the Agrobacterium C58 had a slow rate producing infections. The mushroom mix worked on some basis depending how it was used. Not all carrot disks were same, there were all different. The results show various information, some carrots didn’t get infections while others had tumor growth all over the carrot disks. The mushroom worked against the bacteria in some level. Therefore Ganoderma lucidum significantly did show results how it supports the carrot depending how the mushroom will be used.

THE EFFECTIVE NUTRIENT LEVELS ON THE BIOREMEDIATION OF OIL
Thomas Edward Coburn, Patrick Michael Jarvis, 
Hopkinton High School, Hopkinton, MA

Due to the detrimental affects of oil spills, an efficient response is necessary to preserve the native ecosystem. Bioremediation, which utilizes natural organisms to degrade toxic pollutants, was applied in the Exxon Valdez oil spill, which devastated the Alaskan coastline. Fertilizers containing various quantities of nitrogen and phosphorus were used to facilitate the degradation of the oil. The purpose of this study was to discover the optimal levels of these nutrients, resulting in more efficient bioremediation.<br><br> Pseudomonas putida and motor oil were added to solutions with varying concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus. Three different analysis methods were used to determine the optimal levels. The first method involved the use of resazurin, an indicator that turns from a dark blue to a vibrant pink as a result of oil degradation. Samples were ranked 1-3 based on degree of pink after a period of time. In the second method, the bacteria and remaining oil were filtered from the resazurin solutions and the absorbance of the filtrate measured.. The third test measured bacterial growth over time in the presence of oil and various levels of nitrogen and phosphorus without resazurin. <br><br> All three tests indicate the same optimal level of 9 mg/L nitrogen and 10 mg/L phosphorus. For both nutrient levels as well, the lowest and highest concentrations portrayed degradation to a lower extent, inferring the maintenance of nutrient levels is essential in efficient bioremediation. This experiment sheds new light on a promising method that could be potentially applied on a large scale.

LONE STAR MUSSELS: SUBSTANTIATION OF THE RIVER CONTINUUM THEORY
Alisa Marie Cook, Heath Paul Legge, 
Americas High School, El Paso, TX

In this experiment,the validity of the River Continuum Theory was tested. The theory states that the population and diversity of organisms in the lower reaches of a river is greater than the upper reaches, will be supported with the conclusions of the data. Primarily, points on the Brazos River were identified as either up-river or down-river. Using a GPS Device, the selected coordinates were located. A thirty minute random sample of the river was conducted using hand excavation techniques. Mussels were identified taxonomically and measured with a caliper. Using cumulative data from research gathered previously by university biologists,the observations were statistically based with regression analysis as well as Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The linear regression analysis showed a negative trend going from lower latitudes to higher latitudes for both the Brazos and San Antonio River in both relative abundance and species diversity. The p-values that were obtained from the Brazos River allowed the rejection of the null hypothesis. However, the p-values that were generated for the San Antonio River, were less than the alpha of .05, and therefore the null hypothesis could not be rejected. The validity of the River Continuum Theory in regard to the San Antonio River could not be proven. The failure to prove the theory can be attributed to the interruptions that disrupt the flow of nutrients in the San Antonio River.<br><br>

ACCELERATED DECOMPOSITION OF SUGARCANE WASTE BY BIOAUGMENTATION
Sagar K Patel, Connie Suen, 
Sarasota High, Sarasota, FL

Sugar production is a major industry in many tropical areas worldwide. One of the most abundant byproducts of sugarcane farming is the leafy biomass, which is composed of three main polymers: cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. These recalcitrant components are the main reason for open-air burning rather than the natural decomposition process. The aim of this study was to utilize a mixture of bacteria and fungi to decompose sugar-cane crop residue, in the anticipation that it will produce less pollutants than the method of open-air burning. <br><br> The experimentation consisted of the comparison of heat-killed and viable microbial consortium in order to accurately measure the effect of the microbes on the rate of decomposition. The experimentation held 28 trials, equally containing control and experimental samples over a 51 day period. The samples of inoculated sugarcane samples were observed in an incubator at 35°C with a humid atmosphere. Then, samples were placed in a muffle furnace to determine the amount of organic material decomposed. After data analysis, there was an average of 0.375 g and 0.401 g of organic material respective to the experimental and control groups. There was less organic material remaining in the experimental group because more was decomposed during the 51-day period. The mass change in the experimental group was statistically significant, therefore it can be interpreted that the microbial consortium had a significant effect on the decomposition rate of sugarcane waste.

THE PRODUCTION OF CELLULOSIC ETHANOL FROM BIOMASS
Kody Austin Nelson, Mark Lessen, 
Delavan High School, Delavan, IL

Earth’s supply of petroleum is a limited resource. Ethanol is being produced from corn kernels in factories all over the country while ethanol production from biomass such corn stover, soybean stubble, wheat straw, and grass hay, is not. The purpose of this research was to determine whether ethanol production from these alternative biomass sources was feasible and if there was any appreciable difference in ethanol yield among biomass types.<br><br>Pre-treatment of eight 500g samples (2 samples from each of 4 varieties) of biomass was accomplished by addition of 200 ml 10M NaOH and 3300 ml 3% H2O2 to each sample. The samples were agitated and allowed to decompose for 24 hrs. The decomposed samples were allowed to air dry for 48 hours. After that, the samples were placed into fermentation chambers where the pH was adjusted to 5 by addition of 5000 ml citrate buffer. Cellulase and B-Glucosidase enzymes were added in 100 ml aliquots each. Samples were allowed to rest for 60 min. before 250g Saccharomyces cerevasiae was added. Samples were allowed to ferment for 48 hrs. at 25o C before straining the mixture separating the liquid from the biomass. One hundred milliliters of each filtrate was distilled for 10 minutes and the quanity of ethanol generated was measured.<br><br>Ethanol production from biomass was feasible as shown by the results of this research. Comparing all ethanol samples to the theoretical yield of 126.7mL/500g corn stover, the protocol used produced percent yields for the corn stover, soybean stubble, wheat straw, and grass hay of 88%, 58%, 34% and 35% respectively.

AQUAPONICS: UTILIZING PHYTOREMEDIATION TO REDUCE NITROGENOUS WASTES IN AN ECOSYSTEM
Daniel Wing Wo Hong, Tina Nguyen, 
President William McKinley High School, Honolulu, HI

One of the most successful and productive way of raising both good fish and crops at the same time is aquaponics, the combination of agriculture and aquaculture. The purpose of this project was to see whether algae discs are a better feed than brine shrimp in producing healthier tilapia fish and corn. Two sets of tilapia were used, each fed with one of the two types of feeds. There were three sets of corn, two which were each fed with one type of fish waste water while the third was the control, fed with water. Tilapias were measured in the beginning and end of the experiment to show comparison and corn was measured daily to show daily growth. Based on daily observations, corn plants grown with algae-based waste water demonstrated greater growth than corn plants grown with brine-shrimp-based waste water with a difference of 8 cm. Both sets of corn surpassed the control set. Tilapia fed with algae disc grew more than tilapia fed with brine shrimp with 55 grams compared to 37 grams. This experiment supports that algae discs help to produce healthier tilapia fish and corn. Chemical testing was done on the waste water. It was found that algae-based waste water had 2 ppm of phosphate content while brine-shrimp-based waste water had 1ppm. Nitrate content was also tested for but none was found. These readings could have affected the plant growth.

A COMPARATIVE STUDY ON MANGROVE SPECIES DIVERSITY AT DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IN PANGASIHAN FOREST, GINGOOG CITY, PHILIPPINES
Michelle Manuel Barbon, Rachel Bernados, Mary Cris Corpuz
Gingoog City Comprehensive National High School, Gingoog, PHILIPPINES

The Pangasihan forest of Gingoog City, Philippines is a Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) protected area located near a residential community. It includes 64 hectares of mangrove which covers more than 50% of the entire forest. Though the DENR has records of species diversity of the forest, there is limited information on the dominant species in the mangrove areas where there are human activities. This study was conducted to determine the mangrove species diversity at two experimental plots within the forest: more disturbed coded Plot 1 and less disturbed, Plot 2. <br><br>An inventory of 163 mangrove tree species collected from both plots of 600 sq. meters each revealed 6 species in 3 families. Statistical analysis showed significant difference between plots. Plot 2 had a greater number of mangrove species and higher mean density than plot 1. The Rhizophora apiculata with the highest frequency among the 6 mangrove trees is the dominant species. The higher density value with the greater level of frequency and dominance of mangrove species in Plot 2 indicates a well-balanced ecological niche. <br><br>Using Shannon’s equation (Shawe, 1997), species diversity value of 0.6392 for Plot 1 and 0.5227 for Plot 2 were obtained. Value equal or greater than 1 based on standard stability index would indicate that both plots have low species diversity. It is strongly recommended that intensive environmental protection be enforced in the forest because of its vital contribution against coastal erosion, ecological and economical use.

LARVICIDAL AND INSECTICIDAL PROPERTIES OF CARICA PAPAYA LEAF EXTRACT AGAINST MOSQUITOES
Divya Venkataraman, Neha Kulkarni, 
Modern English School, Mumbai, Maharashtra, INDIA

This project evaluates larvicidal and insecticidal properties of Carica papaya leaves against mosquitoes.<br><br> Taking cue from an observation that a tray of water kept under a Carica papaya tree, into which a leaf had fallen, was free from mosquito eggs, we hypothesized that the Carica papaya leaf might have insecticidal and larvicidal properties against mosquitoes, and proceeded to evaluate this systematically.<br><br> Extracts of leaves were made by solvent extraction method. Various concentrations of these extracts, appropriate positive and negative controls were used on Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes Aegypti species of mosquitoes and their responses were studied. The knockdown effect of the leaf extracts was recorded at periodic intervals. The mortality after 24hours exposure was recorded. The mortality rates of mosquito larvae in aqueous extract was 60%, in solvent extract was 80% and in positive control, Azadirachta indica extract was 60% when compared to the control. The mortality rates of adult mosquitoes in aqueous extract and in solvent extract were 85% and 88% respectively, when compared to the control. The mat vaporisers made using aqueous Carica papaya leaf extract achieved 56% mortality while the solvent extract mat vaporisers achieved 100% mortality and was considered extremely significant with ‘t’ test value of 84 with 3 degree of freedom compared to the controls. Carica papaya leaf extract candle showed 94% repellency. Experiments conducted on other pests (House flies) showed 84% mean mortality. The lowest concentration that incurred mortality was 3% (v/v). Data was statistically analyzed for significance. <br><br> These results show Carica papaya leaf extracts to have potent larvicidal and insecticidal properties against mosquitoes, and provides a novel environmentally benign alternative to synthetic chemical insecticides.

ALGAE BIO INCINERATOR: A SOLUTION TO GLOBAL WARMING IN YOUR OWN BACKYARD
Juan De Dios Ybarra, Gonzalo Guajardo, 
Weslaco East High School, Weslaco, TX

The purpose of this science project was to help reduce the amount of carbon dioxide released into the air. A large percent of the world’s carbon dioxide is released into the air caused by the burning of trash. With this project, burning trash can happen with the excess of the deadly toxins, such as carbon dioxide, being released into the atmosphere. The procedure of the project was to build an airtight container that the trash can be burned in. Next is to build an airtight container where the smoke can be held in. The two containers will be connected with a hose. A pump will be inserted inside of the smoke container which will pump the smoke into the algae then diluted. After a period of time the algae will under go photosynthesis and convert the carbon dioxide into carbon for its own consumption and oxygen which will be given out into the environment. At the end of the experiment the data was collected by probes using the TI-84 calculators. The data showed that the carbon dioxide was decreased by 81% and there was an increase in oxygen of 45%. However different variables are still being tested and will be shown on the board. The conclusion for the project is that the engineering goal was met and this algae bio incinerator can be used to burn trash and work very effectively and easily .Anybody can use this machine and it is inexpensive and highly effective.

Escuela Publica Exp. Desconcentrada No1 Maestra Rosenda Quiroga, La Punta, San Luis, ARGENTINA

The ecological features of the vegetation in the surrounding areas of La Punta City (San Luis, Argentina) were studied and the environmental services that said vegetation offers were analyzed. The number of individuals and the perimeter of woody species were registered using the lot sampling method. The number of individuals, cover and yield of the herbaceous species were registered using the sampling technique of square decimeter. The woody species with the greatest cover were Larrea divaricata (“jarilla”) and Acacia caven (“espinillo”). Aspidosperma quebracho blanco (“quebracho blanco”) and Prosopis sp. (“algarrobo”) were the species which presented perimeters over 100 cm. The herbaceous species with the greatest cover and density is Stipa eriostachya (“paja de las vizcacheras”). The organic soil layer presented a cover of 34% and the bare ground, 15%. The yield of the gramineous species was 4,130 kg/ha, and that of the latifoliated species was 800 kg/ha. The results indicate that the current vegetation structure of the area of study and the flora composition corresponds to a forest of “quebracho blanco” and “algarrobo” and a bush land of “jarilla” and grassland. The yield and the cover percentages of herbaceous species and organic soil layer indicate that there exists an important biomass yield. The analysis of the ecological features studied shows that the vegetation offers a wide variety of environmental services which can directly influence on the protection and improvement of the environment: soil and local biodiversity conservation, natural beauty and a potential source of greenhouse gas assimilation.

In 2006, 9,814,000 liters of milk were produced in Mexico. The State of Guanajuato was ranked the sixth place among the biggest national milk-producers, which are Jalisco, Coahuila, Durango, Chihuahua, Veracruz, and the State of Mexico (SAGARPA 2006).¹<br><br> Considering the ecological problem that is caused by whey in the agro-industrial effluents with the consecutive pollution in the environment, this project is proposed to help the regional cheese maker industry. To achieve the goals of the project, the variables that consider the precipitation of the whey proteins were optimized and lately used to produce biodegradable films. These films and covers, so they can be used on fruits, milk products, meats, and semi processed products. <br><br> The proteins were optimized with a factorial design where temperature, time, and acidity were considered as variables. A biodegradable film and cover were made with phenol and alcoholic extracts from Dracaena Fragans Massageana and Caesalpinia Cacalaco with an excellent shelf life. This project will give a value to the whey so enterprisers can avoid throwing it away. It will contribute to the development of a viable industrial process with a greater ecological awareness.

VARIATION IN CONTAINMENT METHODOLOGIES FOR THE REMEDIATION FOR CBM EFFLUENTS
Talysa Renae Stockert
Greybull High School, Greybull, WY

Coal bed methane (CBM) is a clean burning natural gas that is found in the seams of coal beds, which is held in place by water pressure. Developers depressurize the methane by pumping out the ground water in order for the natural gas to be extracted. The ground water is then too salty to use for irrigation of agriculture, and pumping it into streams and rivers poses a threat to animals due to the high levels of contaminates. Lined and unlined holding ponds are a commonly used way of storing contaminated water. This water has potential to be hazardous by seeping in to useable ground water, contaminating possible drinking water in some cases. <br><br> Finding an effective way to remove or contain contaminates from the CBM water was the goal of this experimentation. Peanut and pistachio shells were used in a shell based filtration system. Charcoaled, acid washed, crushed, and whole peanut and pistachio shells were used to filter and contain saline water. Peanut shells when converted to activated charcoal would produce promising filtration results on an industrial scale. Using these different techniques to reduce the threat of contaminated water would benefit plants and their environment. Which would also help with legalities between Wyoming and Montana were Wyoming is in a law suit of expelling contaminated water that ends up in Montana. With the lack of precipitation in the western U.S. the quality of this water is a very real concern. A means of addressing the issue and eliminating contaminates in CBM effluent serves both industry and the public. The applications developed in this research move towards an economical and sustainable solution to this significant threat to our water supply.

THE USE OF A RAIN GARDEN TO CONTROL ROAD RUN-OFF IN SCANLON CREEK AND AN ASSESSMENT OF RAIN GARDENS AS THE BEST STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PRACTICE, PHASE III
Logan Joseph Pallin
Cloquet Senior High School, Cloquet, MN

The objectives of this study were: to determine the effect a rain garden has had on the health of a trout stream, macroinvertebrate predator/prey interactions over three years, if Hester-dende samplers can be modified to predict the effects of construction generated road run-off on macroinvertebrate populations, and if rain gardens are the best storm water<br><br>treatment process. Water quality sampling was done from a ten-meter reach before and after a rain garden construction site with road run-off entry over a three year period.<br><br>Modified Hester-dende samplers were again used to simulate an embedded and<br><br>non-embedded stream situation (allowing/limiting predation). As an expansion of last year's study, beyond just monitoring the rain garden's effect on Scanlon Creek, an examination of the rain garden's performance, using an infiltrometer, and a comparison of the Scanlon Creek rain garden to similar rain gardens in the Duluth area was done. When<br><br>the road run-off treated section of the stream was compared to upstream of the road run-off, during phase one and two of this study, the rain garden had a positive effect on temperature, discharge, pH, conductivity, Family Biotic Index (FBI), macroinvertebrate density, and diversity of food processing groups. <br><br>After the third summer, even with continued maintenance, the rain garden's positive effect diminished for some variables: oxygen, temperature, discharge, conductivity, pH, and clarity. Also, even though Scanlon Creek rain garden infiltration rates were significantly lower than all rain gardens in the<br><br>area, the rain garden positively affected macro invertebrate family biotic index and diversity

USE OF CHLORELLA PYRENOIDOSA MICROALGAE SUPPLEMENTS AS A CHELANT FOR HEAVY METAL FILTRATION
Vivian Connie Tsang
Sunset High School, Portland, OR

The Willamette River has long been reputed for its noxious superfund sites around the Portland Harbor. Heavy metals, pesticides, and other hazardous dioxins contribute to the deleterious nature of the Willamette River. This study focuses on the effectiveness and efficiency of chlorella pyrenoidosa microalgae supplements as a chelatory medium for heavy metal filtration. Three filters were created, each with differing filtering mediums. Filter 1 used Willamette River sediment as the filtering agent, which acted as a control. Filter 2 used chlorella pyrenoidosa supplements as the filtering medium; and filter 3 used protease digested chlorella supplements. Each filter filtered 400 parts per million (ppm) of potassium dichromate solution. After 72 hours of filtration, the beginning and ending concentrations of the chromium within the filtered solution of every trial were analyzed using a method called Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) using gamma spectroscopy. According to the results obtained through NAA, trial one saw an increase in chromium concentration by 27.57 ppm, whereas, both trial 2 and 3 (using chlorella supplements as the filtering medium) saw a net decrease in chromium concentration within the filtered solutions, with a 64.83 ppm decrease in trial 2 and a 48.39 ppm decrease in trial 3. The obtained results scientifically corroborate the detoxifying and chelatory properties of chlorella that have not been recognized by the FDA, and also indicate the potential use of chlorella microalgae supplements as a medium for trace heavy metal filtration in small Willamette tributaries.

ANALYSIS OF THE PHYTOREMEDIATIVE CAPABILITIES OF THE SALIX NIGRA AND SALIX CAROLINIANA ON TRICHLOROETHYLENE WITH A FOCUS ON PHYTODEGRADATION AND PHYTOVOLATILIZATION, YEAR TWO
Meredith Celeste Boulos
Episcopal High School, Jacksonville, FL

Due to improper disposal in the industrial setting, trichloroethylene, a probable carcinogen, is often introduced to soil and groundwater. As opposed to the standard contaminant removal processes, which are costly, laborious, and damaging to the environment, there is an alternative: phytoremediation. Phytovolatilization, a subcategory of phytoremediation, is the process in which contaminants are absorbed by the root system of a plant and transpired into the atmosphere. When found in the atmosphere trichloroethylene has a half life of nine minutes. Therefore, phytovolatilization could potentially be a very effective and economical means of remediating contaminated soil or groundwater that would not require harvesting and special disposal of plants. During phytodegradation, TCE absorbed by the plant but not transpired is broken down by the enzymes in the root system and incorporated into the plant’s tissues. In order to compare the phytodegradation and phytovolatilization of TCE, two plants were chosen, the Salix nigra and the Salix caroliniana, which were placed in a novel apparatus that was constructed in order to separately test for these two subtypes of phytoremediation. The lower chamber was periodically sampled with an airtight syringe and the upper chamber was sampled using a pump and a charcoal filter. Samples were extracted into hexane and analyzed on the gas chromatograph mass spectrometer. Based on the larger and more rapidly developing root system, greater span of pH tolerance, and a greater maximum plant density per acre, it was hypothesized that the Salix nigra would outperform the Salix caroliniana in both phytodegradation and phytovolatilization. After data analysis was complete,it was evident that although the Salix caroliniana phytovolatilized 10 times more TCE than the Salix nigra,and that the Salix nigra only phytodegraded 3.24 times more TCE,the amount of TCE phytodegraded significantly outweighed the amount phytovolatilized due to the fact that milligram amounts of TCE were degraded while only microgram amounts were phytovolatilized. Therefore, the Salix nigra was determined to be the more effective plant at phytoremediating trichloroethylene.The hypothesis was partially supported by the results.

AUTOMATED BIOCHEMICAL WASTE TREATMENT FACILITY
Nikita Kutuzov
Lyceum # 40, Nizhny Novgorod, RUSSIA

Development of efficient, ecological waste treatment technologies permitting to purify wastewaters to the characteristics of process water to be recycled at industrial enterprises is a challenge of the day. In an attempt to solve this problem a laboratory automated treatment facility was developed that included an anaerobic fluidized bed reactor and a membrane bioreactor with submerged membrane modules. The installation was equipped with the automation controller Compact FieldPoint 2020 (National Instruments) and LabVIEW 7.1 software thus ensuring control of pressure, temperature, oxygen concentration, water and air flow, water level, time-dependent water feeding, periodical automatic parameters storing, graph plotting, message printing about the condition of the system. I also made level sensors and drop flow meter myself. The facility permits to conduct prolonged tests for obtaining basic relationships and choosing optimal parameters of water treatment process to be applied in the manufacturing of treatment plants.

CHICKEN SOUP FROM CHICKEN POOP

Gibbon-Farifax-Winthrop High School, Winthrop, MN

My project is called "Chicken Soup from Chicken Poop". I built a methane gas digester and tried to make methane from two different types of manure, cow manure and chicken manure. I chose to make an anaerobic, batch feeding digester. I chose my model by e-mailing Jim Paulson, Kevin Jannie, Dr. Jun Zhu, and by talking with my mentor, Paul Weikle. My goal was to create methane that would produce enough heat to cook a kettle of chicken soup.<br><br> I made a digester using five gallon pails, PVC pipe, garbage bag (for a collection bag), and an insulated box to keep a more consistent temperature. After about 4 weeks my methane was ready to burn. When the methane was being burned, digester A (chicken manure) burned a very clean, blue flame while digester B (cow manure) burned a very orange flame. This was because digester B was contaminated by an air leak. Evidence of an air leak was found when I opened the cover and found a colony of mold.<br><br> In the end I was able to produce a steady flame that continuously burned for a long period of time. If my digester would have been bigger I could have produced a larger flame capable of producing more heat.

THE EFFECTS OF THE COMPONENTS OF FERTILIZER ON THE PHYTOREMEDIATIVE ACTIVITY OF BLUE-GREEN ALGAE
Raghav Chandra
Century High School, Rochester, MN

The purpose of this experiment was to study whether fertilizer increased the phytoremediative activity of Blue-green algae (Anabaena sphaerica) and to determine which constituent of fertilizer, nitrogen or phosphorus was more effective in doing so. Four different experiments were conducted with two trials for each test. The first test was performed to observe the phytoremediative activity of non-enhanced Anabaena (control), one with nitrogen-enriched Anabaena, one with phosphorus-enriched Anabaena, and one with Anabaena enriched with complete fertilizer. The hypothesis was that nitrogen-enriched Anabaena would be more effective than phosphorus but complete fertilizer would most enhance phytoremediation. No supplementation to Anabaena would result in least oil degradation. 10 ml of water and 5 ml of 15000 filaments/ml Anabaena solution were added to each test tube. 1 g. of supplement (sodium nitrate, calcium phosphate, or complete fertilizer) was added to pre-marked individual test tubes. 2.5 ml of oil was added to each test tube. The immiscible volume of oil remaining at the top of each test tube was measured daily for 15 days. The results indicated that the non-enriched Anabaena had least phytoremediative activity as most oil remained at the end of 15 days. Nitrogen-enriched Anabaena enhanced the phytoremediative activity more than phosphorus-enriched Anabaena. Addition of complete fertilizer enhanced the phytoremediative activity of the Anabaena; the least amount of oil remained. It can be its concluded that addition of fertilizer and components enhanced the phytoremediative activity of Blue-green algae. The addition of nitrogen is more effective in enhancing phytoremediation than the addition of phosphorus. Having no supplements resulted in some phytoremediative activity, but less than that with nutrient-enriched Anabaena. These results can be applied to develop new methods of decreasing environmental damage after oil spills.

HOW MUCH WATER DO PLANTS 'DRINK': PROPOSING A REAL-TIME AND ACCURATE PATTERN FOR THE WATER-SAVING IRRIGATION MANAGEMENT IN URBAN PARKS OF THE SEMI-ARID AREAS
Siran Li
Beijing Huiwen Middle School, Beijing, CHINA

Botanic Water Requirement (BWR) in urban parks, a main component of Urban Eco-environmental Water Requirement (UEEWR), plays an important role in maintaining water balance, especially in semi-arid areas. However, the irrigation of urban parks is mostly extensive and empirical due to the inconsistent and inaccurate BWR measurement and the lack of precise weather data. Taking Beijing Longtan Park as an example, this project focuses on the BWR regularities of several types of urban park vegetation (trees, shrubs and aquatic plants), providing a base for the establishment of an accurate, easy-to-operate irrigation management pattern and a water-saving vegetation structure.<br><br> Based on the daily measurement of transpiration rates of seven common plants in Beijing (i.e. Sophora japonica Linn., Magnolia grandifloral Desr., Salix babylonica Linn., Ailanthus altissima Mill. Swingle, Cornus alba, Phragmites Communis and Nelumbo nucifera) from June to September, 2008, with Licor 6400 Portable Photosynthesis Measurement System, models to simulate the monthly or seasonal transpiration were formulated. <br><br> Two calibration methods, respectively based on agro-meteorological principles and general statistical analysis, for upscaling the transpiration from immediate to monthly level with unspecified weather data were proposed. When calculating the transpiration of Baiyangdian Wetland, Hebei Province from May to October, 2006, these methods gave closer results to Penman-Monteith Formulae (FAO56 Standard) than do Priestley-Taylor, Hargreaves and Jensen-Haise Equations. <br><br> At last, coupling with leaf area data, the BWR of species and community scales was calculated to provide a spatio-temporal irrigation plan for the experimental site. <br><br> This research may contribute to the high-efficient, water-saving irrigation and vegetation management of urban parks in semi-arid areas.

THERMAL OPTIMIZATION OF DEEP BOREHOLES FOR MINOR ACTINIDE WASTE DISPOSAL
Alec C. Lai
Hawken Upper School, Gates Mills, OH

Nuclear waste disposal and sequestration, especially of minor actinides (e.g., Np, Am, and Cm), have become major concerns in society. Currently, these nuclear wastes are stored for a million years before they can be safely handled. A proposed alternative method is to encapsulate the minor actinides in a 5-km deep borehole drilled within granitic rock formations of high geological integrity. The present study optimizes the design of such a borehole repository, focusing on the thermal effects, total temperature increases, actinide composition, and hole diameter and spacing. This study proposes a design with up to 2000 4-cm diameter canisters, or 13250 assemblies worth, of 100-yr cooled minor actinides and copper chaff stored in a 5-cm diameter borehole, with each surrounded by a 0.5-cm thick annulus of sand. The boreholes are arranged with spacing of 105 m between neighboring boreholes to constantly maintain the temperature increase of the canister below 200 °C for safe storage. This design allows for 3.32 years of US minor actinide wastes to be stored in an efficient and effective manner; its drilling cost is less than one half percent of the cost of current nuclear waste storage methods.

The purpose of this project was to discover an affordable, biodegradable material that will efficiently absorb crude motor oil in an oil spill situation. I tested human hair, witch hazel, pine shavings, and organic biodegradable cat litter. I contacted an oil waste company to dispose of my oil. <br><br> I took large, plastic containers and filled the bottom with sand from the beach. I added shells and seaweed to replicate an oceanic habitat. I placed ten quarts of salt water from the gulf. I covered the oceanic habitat with one cup of crude motor oil. I covered the oil with one of the selected biodegradable materials. I conducted three trials for all four of the subjects using two different distillation methods. I used both a skimming method and a funneling system to measure the amount of crude oil that the specified material had absorbed. <br><br> The human hair was the most absorbent material. The hair made the oily oceanic water clear for two of the three trials for each distillation method. I took my results and tried to come up with a plausible way to use my material. That gave me the idea of creating a net made of nylon and human hair to act as a sponge.<br><br> My original hypothesis of human hair absorbing the most oil was correct. The hairy net on a larger scale could be the perfect clean up method for a surface oil spill.

INFESTED FORESTS AND EVAPOTRANSPIRATION: IS THE LOSS OF ET SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO SOLVE THE WATER CRISIS IN THE WEST?
Johanna Lynne Phillips
Monte Vista High School, Monte Vista, CO

The purpose of this experiment was to identify if selective clear cutting brought on by spruce budworm infestation, is beneficial in increasing streamflow. In this project it was hypothesized that the loss of mixed conifer forests could influence the amount of ET (evapotranspiration), overall increasing the amount of water in the unsaturated zone. The project was believed to some how quantitatively show a measure of this increase through a water balance equation. <br><br> The following steps were taken; installing Watermark soil moisture sensors on both a treated or deforested and untreated or tree filled basin on the Trinchera Ranch. Readings were taken from these sensors in September, October, January, and, February.<br><br> By taking readings a soil moisture characteristic curve was found which allowed change in storage to be calculated. The following equation with runoff and precipitation was used to find ET; ET=P-R-deltaS. ET in the treated area was .03 inches and in the untreated was .13 inches.<br><br>ET was put into the water balance equation with precipitation, runoff, and an area of 1000ft2 to find the overall discharge; Q=(P-R-ET)A. In the treated basin there was about 277 gallons of discharge, in the untreated about 202 gallons of discharge.<br><br>With the calculated discharge more in the area of no trees, it was concluded that this did support the hypothesis. The project will be continued by placing additional sensors up the drainages, taking into account additional parameters, refining the process and creating an equation to model it.

WHAT CHARACTERISTICS INFLUENCE A GOSHAWK'S NESTING SITE?
Kieron Arn Callahan
Grant Union High School, John Day, OR

I investigated the nesting sites of northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) in the Strawberry Mountain region of Oregon. Little is known about the characteristics that influence this bird’s nesting sites in this region, and I hope that my findings will help logging companies and government officials to better decide what should be logged and what shouldn’t. I found goshawk nesting sites and proceeded to gather data on the characteristics of the nesting tree and the nesting stand, such as diameter, basal area, canopy density, nest height, and age. I also went to random sites in the same general area and measured the same characteristics. I conclude that goshawks are influenced largely by the characteristics of stands, not only the individual tree. Goshawks prefer an older ((146.6 + 9.41 {mean + SE} years vs. 98.886 + 15.99 years; nesting stand vs. random) (P = 0.032), larger diameter stand (43.64 + 17.35 cm [17.182 + 6.83 in]) with an intermediate foliage density (83.1 + 6.83) (P = 0.002). I recommend protecting a nesting stand, not just the nesting tree, which has these basic characteristics so as to ensure the wellbeing of these birds of prey.

THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT WAVE BARRIERS ON THE WALL STABILITY DURING WAVE TESTING
Bailey Holly Terry
Newcastle High School, Newcastle, WY

This project was conducted to see what structure of wave barriers is the most stable when tested with waves. It was hypothesized that wave barriers built in a staggered brick pattern would withhold more wave pressure than a one-on-one pattern. When looking at the structure of the walls, a third wall, made in a zigzag pattern, was also tested. <br><br> The sandbag walls were built on a line four inches from the back of the platform. They were then tested with wave forces from degrees of 20, 40, and 60. The walls were tested by how far off the line the barriers moved when hit by the waves. The three types of barriers that were tested were one-on-one, staggered, and zigzag. <br><br> During the control test at 0-degrees tilt, all the walls held on the line. The second test at 20-degrees indicated that the one-on-one wall cannot withstand waves with a very high force. The test at 40 degrees caused the staggered wall to begin to slide, but the zigzag wall still held. The test at 60 degrees proved to be a greater force than any of the walls could hold. <br><br> Although the hypothesis was unsupported, this experiment has important information. It instructs people that the zigzag structure should be used to get the best efficiently out of a sandbag wave barrier.

THE EFFECTS OF PRESCRIBED BURNING ON ENVIRONMENTAL MERCURY RELEASE DURING SUBSEQUENT FOREST FIRES
Julia Marie Denning
Gold Beach High School, Gold Beach, OR

Mercury (Hg), a harmful pollutant to animals and humans, is released into the atmosphere from organic soil during wildfires. Prescribed burning has proven to slow fires and reduce their severity, but it has not been determined whether these prescribed burns are helpful, harmful, or neutral in terms of Hg emissions. Using archived organic and A-level soil samples gathered before and after the 2002 Biscuit Fire, it is possible to analyze soil Hg using the neutron activation method (NA). There were two sets of three treatments - thinning, thinning and prescribed burning, and a control with neither. One set of these treatments had been burned in entirety while the other had not. Simultaneously, additional samples were analyzed to test for Hg contamination from soil-drying ovens. To determine this, fresh samples were taken from the unburned control plot, air-dried, and sent to the analyzer with previously gathered oven-dried samples. The results from NA do not show any Hg, because the machine had too high of a detection limit to detect the levels of Hg. The next step will be to test the soil samples at a facility able to analyze the soil at parts per billion rather than parts per million. Homann (in prep) has shown a 30-50% reduction in soil carbon loss in the thinning and burning treatment. Based on recent research, showing a positive correlation between soil carbon and soil Hg (Natali et al 2008), I anticipate seeing a similar 30-50% reduction in mercury emissions from the prescribed burning.

THE USE OF RYE GRASS TO REMOVE LEAD AND CADMIUM FROM WASTE WATER
Joshua Joseph Hicks
Roanoke Valley Governor's School/Staunton River High School, Moneta, VA

The purpose was to determine the ability of rye grass to bioremediate water contaminated with lead, cadmium, or a combination of both. The hypothesis was that rye grass would take up lead and/or cadmium at significant levels, yet not damage the grass itself. The constants included the amount of light, temperature, type of seed, and the Knop’s solution. The control was the standard Knop’s solution trial, with the independent variable the amount of lead and cadmium in solution and the dependent variable the amount of lead and cadmium taken in by the grass. <br><br> Four floating platforms were constructed from Styrofoam™ strips, with a mesh screen stapled over the bottom of each. Rye seeds were spread over the mesh. Knop’s solution, lead, and cadmium solutions (200ppm) were made. One trial was a control, one had lead, another had cadmium, and the last trial contained both lead and cadmium. A volume of 3L solution was used in each trial. After eight days, the grass was pulled up, dried in an oven, digested following EPA protocol. The samples were analyzed using ICP for total lead and cadmium content at a local testing laboratory.<br><br> The results showed that although rye grass has the ability to store large amounts of lead, when cadmium is also present at a similar level, rye grass has a much greater tendency to consume the cadmium versus the lead. The hypothesis was supported, based on both the levels of lead and cadmium found in each trial and the grass appearance.

SHEDDING LIGHT ON IMIDACLOPRID’S ROLE IN COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER
Eliza Helen McNitt
Greenwich High School, Greenwich, CT

In recent years, honeybees have been inexplicably disappearing at an alarming rate in a poorly understood phenomenon called Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). Continued use of new pesticides throughout the agricultural and private sectors has led to speculation that these compounds may play a role in the disappearance of the honeybee. Many entomologists suspect that Imidacloprid, a systemic pesticide introduced concurrent with the onset of CCD, plays a significant role in the hive collapse. This research seeks to provide analytical evidence that Imidacloprid plays a role in CCD, by tracing the migration of this pesticide in the pollination pathway of the honeybee. Samples of dead bees, pollen, bee bread, and honeycomb were obtained from the Bartlett Arboretum (Stamford, CT), where Imidacloprid was applied around the beehive. Organic components of each sample type were extracted using Acetonitrile & Water, and analyzed using High Pressure Liquid Chromatography. Analysis of dead Arboretum bees taken from the hive reveal the presence of 143 ppm of Imidacloprid within the “whole” ground insect. The extremities of the bees contained 141 ppm of the pesticide, with little/no internal traces of Imidacloprid within the bees. The presence of 55 ppm of Imidacloprid in the honeycomb further validates that at least a portion of the pesticide is being carried to the hive on the extremities of the honeybee. The absence of Imidacloprid within the pollen, bee bread, and bee bodies samples suggest that the Imidacloprid molecule is not being retained in its original chemical form within the bee physiology.

EFFECTS OF METARHIZIUM ANISOPLIAE ON AEDES AEGYPTI
Kyle Lowell Cope
Rock River High School, Rock River, WY

This research analyzed the effects of the fungal Agent Metarhizium anisopliae on the mosquito Aedes aegypti. The study was initiated to determine if the fungus would have a lethal effect on either the larval or adult mosquitoes. <br><br> <br><br>Mortality was determined by observation and a chi-square statistical test. The fungus kills the mosquitoes by infecting their lungs and eating away the chitin (exoskeleton, on their bodies. Observation under a microscope revealed that the mosquitoes were infected with the biological agent. <br><br> <br><br>The success rate of the fungus was phenomenal. Using the Chi Square Statistical Test, with 1 degree of freedom, results revealed that the mosquitoes died because of the fungus. Test results showed that there was only a five percent probability that the deaths were based on chance alone.<br><br> <br><br>Using Metarhizium anisopliae to kill mosquitoes will substitute the need to use toxic chemicals. Current spraying of chemicals reduces the number of mosquitoes in the environment. Mosquitoes are proven vectors of infectious agents. Products such as Malathion are highly regulated chemicals that can harm the environment or vertebrates. Metarhizium anisopliae is not harmful to any type of vertebrate. By infecting a small population of larval or adult mosquitoes with the fungi, there is the opportunity to control large numbers of mosquitoes without toxic “blanket” spraying of chemicals.

OPEN-SKY DRAINAGE TUBING WITH THE REUSE OF TIRES
Andresa Quartieri de Azambuja
Colegio Presidente Emilio Garrastazu Medice - Fundacao Bradesco, Bage, Rio Grande do Sul, BRASIL

The present study aims at solving problems which were raised in previous field researches. This project deals with the human rights through the development of an open-sky drainage tubing to be used at houses or at schools. I understand that the individual, social and environmental health should be promoted through the action of different agents who diagnose and propose solutions to real problems, building references that lead to the participation in the matters related to quality of life. Therefore, I thought about reusing old car tires as drainage tubing. The drainage tubing required a great human work force, so I gathered the help of volunteers on its construction. The first step was the cleaning and the enlargement of the ditch. Then, the pre-selected tires was put according to their condition and size - wheel 13, 14 or 15. The tire`s inside and outside were filled with some earth in order to provide the necessary resistance and leveling. This process was repeated until the finish of the measuring. Six tires were used for each canalization meter. To conclude, plastic and earth were used to cover the ditch. After finishing our drainage tubing, its resistance was checked in order to test if the automobiles traffic was possible. I observed the effects our tubing had on the community by listening to people’s impression on that. They seemed to be very satisfied with the fact that my project made the public drainage tubing economically possible and, consequently, it resulted in the improvement of the local public health.

FUTURISTIC ADHESIVE TAPE
Lorianny Rivera
Colegio Maria Auxiliadora, Carolina, PUERTO RICO

During the decomposition process of matter in a dump yard, leaches not only drag toxic products from the garbage, but also pollute ground waters which are often used for human consumption and irrigation. Commercial tape is one of the materials that pollute when buried. This is why this research studies the use of Artocarpus altilis and Musa paradisiaca as an alternative to obtain a natural adhesive tape.<br><br>Three trees of Artocarpus altilis and Musa paradisiaca were selected. Their fruits were cut in pieces and grated. Different tests were performed to obtain a mixture with glue-like consistence to be used for the adhesive tape. It was composed of: the curd, the starches, and the grates of Artocarpus altilis and Musa paradisiaca. Once the natural glue was obtained, it was left to settle down for awhile and later spread on paraffin paper to verify its effectiveness by performing some tests of: weight, durability, photo degradation, pH, salinity, and temperature. Paraffin paper was used since it is not considered toxic and is also fire retardant and heat resistant.<br><br>Once the tests were completed, the adhesive tape proved to be so effective that it was able to surpass the three tests of weight that were performed. This way, a natural adhesive tape able to help preserve the environment, was obtained.

A NEW WAY OF SEWAGE TREATMENT
Laura Genesis Roldan
Colegio Maria Auxiliadora, Carolina, PUERTO RICO

The principal environmental issues associated with runoff are the impacts to surface water through the transportation of water pollutants to these systems. The purpose of this investigation is to find an efficient transportation and treatment system to gather and to handle residual and pluvial water near urban runoffs, due to the adverse effects of pollution that this water can have on residents of the area. <br><br> Several sites around the area were inspected to become familiar with the ecosystem and find if any illegal deposits of solid wastes and/or possible connections of the sanitary system with the pluvial system existed. <br><br>A total of five stations were selected, taking into consideration the proximity with the pluvial drainages. The physical and chemical parameters of the water were taken to describe the quality of the water and to identify the presence of contaminants. The analyses showed a serious problem of pollutants in this system caused by human factors. In addition, maps of sanitary and pluvial systems of the area were studied.<br><br> In all the stations similar parameters were obtained. The analyses demonstrate high levels of fecal coliforms exceeding the established parameters. Metals were also found in all the stations. <br><br>After studying the connections of the sanitary and pluvial system in the area we recommended the integration of a Sustainable Drainage System. A plan of management with the objective of improving the quality of the water, the handling of solid wastes and the participation and education of the public is also suggested.

THE EFFECT OF METAL HYDROXIDES ON CARBON DIOXIDE ABSORPTION
Joshua Aaron Zeidman
Niles North High School, Skokie, IL

The purpose of the experiment was to test the effect of dissolving metal hydroxides in aqueous solution on the solution’s ability to absorb carbon dioxide from the air. It was hypothesized, if aqueous solutions with deionized water, with potassium hydroxide, and with calcium hydroxide, are exposed to carbon dioxide in a closed environment, then the solutions with dissolved calcium hydroxide will absorb the most carbon dioxide. To test the hypothesis, an apparatus containing a flask, stopper, syringe, reaction vessel, and pressure sensor was set up. 12 solutions- 4 with deionized water, 4 with calcium hydroxide, and 4 with potassium hydroxide- were tested in six-minute trials. Changes in pressure were noted over the time interval with a greater drop in pressure attributed to a greater quantity of carbon dioxide absorbed. On average, the solutions with only water caused a drop in pressure of .82 kPa over the trial while the solutions with calcium caused a drop of 1.23 kPa, and the solutions with potassium a drop of 1.43 kPa. Additional trials performed with greater concentrations of potassium hydroxide and with potassium chloride confirmed that the hydroxide was shifting the equilibrium of the solution and causing the pressure drops. While the data did not support the hypothesis, it suggested that adding metal hydroxides posed a viable method for increasing an aqueous solution's potential to react with atmospheric carbon dioxide, removing this carbon dioxide from the atmosphere where it may have been contributing as a greenhouse gas to global warming.

KINYON KAPTURE
Taylor Frances Kinyon
Plankinton Independent High School, Plankinton, SD

Vehicle exhaust contains harmful polluted gases due to incomplete combustion of the hydrocarbons in gasoline. Exhaust moisture is also produced during engine combustion when oxygen and hydrogen atoms combine, forming water. Each vehicle drips a small amount of the liquid from its exhaust pipe. If you multiply this by the number of vehicles being driven, a significant volume of exhaust moisture enters our ecosystems. My previous knowledge of pollutants in vehicle exhaust made me come to the assumption that the exhaust moisture also had contaminants and was harmful to living organisms. I began to wonder if I could reduce pollutants in the exhaust moisture by building a practical device that filters out substances that can harm the environment.<br><br> To reduce these liquid pollutants I invented the Kinyon Kapture. This device attaches directly to exhaust pipes. The condensation, which normally drips from exhaust pipes, is collected and runs through a filter without restricting the flow of exhaust. Home water quality tests and laboratory testing were executed on both the filtered and unfiltered exhaust moisture samples. The unfiltered samples proved to have contaminants while the filtered samples had reduced contaminants to a safer level. My simple and economically feasible device can be incorporated on any vehicle. The Kinyon Kapture addresses an important subject and for a small sum of money you can help make any vehicle a greater friend to the environment.

PARTIAL UTILIZATION OF MINING INDUSTRY WASTE (KMA) WHEN PRODUCING CERAMIC BRICK
Yana Sergeevna Beregovaya
School #40, Belgorod, Belgorod Region, RUSSIA

There are numerous waste accumulating while iron ore dressing in KMA enterprises. One of them is quart’s sandstone. Quart’s sandstone represent almost monomineral breed from grey to pinkish-grey colour, owing to presence of fuchsite - greenish -grey colour, fine-grained structure, massive, and more rare roughiyband and schistose structure. Breed forming mineral is quartz.<br><br>We suggest a new method of utilization of waste KMA, to be exact quart’s sandstone instead sandstone in brick manufacture. <br><br>The purpose of my work is to study use possibility quart’s sandstone as the additive for manufacturing of a ceramic brick, thereby partially having utilised it.<br><br>For performance of the given purpose there were tasks in view: <br><br>To study the scientific literature devoted to problems of recycling of a waste of the mining industry. To study the "know-how" of a ceramic brick, and also to master techniques of definition of the seeming density, absorption of water samples. To conduct tests of samples for definition of physicomechanical properties with the different maintenance quart’s sandstone. To define optimum structure of a mix for reception of a ceramic brick with use as the additive of waste KMA.<br><br>Studying the scientific literature, we had been found some ways of recycling of a waste. <br><br>Our researches show, that such additive as quart’s sandstone, with its maintenance no more than 5 % to a ceramic brick is possible, and also under certain conditions, makes a brick even more strongly. With using of such additive it is possible to get ceramic bricks of mark 125-150.<br><br>Application quart’s sandstone in brick manufacture can give reduction of parent materials and as it is clear from the spent researches, the greatest durability of a product.<br><br>As for as a theme urgency is concerned, so in this case it is necessary first of all to pay attention to the fact that even partial recycling of KMA waste will help not only to release the soils from "blockages", but also to improve well-being of environment.

RETENTION OF SORBED HYDROPHOBIC POLLUTANT BY ORGANOCLAY IN THE PRESENCE OF HYDROCARBON-DEGRADING BACTERIAL ISOLATES
Laurie Ann Rumker
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland, OR

Water bodies and sediment polluted through human activity are in critical need of remedial action. Organoclay, the active layer in sediment cap barriers used to contain pollutants in aqueous sediments, is clay infused with a surfactant to create a hydrophobic exterior with the capability to sorb hydrophobic pollutants. To investigate the stability of organoclay in the environment, this study evaluated the effects of three hydrocarbon-degrading strains of Rhodococcus erythropolis on the retention of sorbed pollutants by an organoclay. It was hypothesized that hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria would consume the aliphatic chains of the surfactants, rendering them less hydrophobic and potentially causing the release of sorbed pollutants back into the environment as a threat to organisms and the ecosystem. The fat-soluble dye Nile red, a surrogate for a hydrophobic pollutant, was sorbed into organoclay. This organoclay was placed in a KNO3, K2HPO4 and NH4Cl nutrient solution, inoculated with one of the three bacterial strains and incubated on an orbital shaker to allow aerobic growth, leaving the surfactants as the only carbon source available for the bacteria. Both bacterial growth and Nile red remaining in the organoclay were quantified with a spectrophotometer over a 3-day period. A series of single-factor ANOVA tests indicated that no significant Nile red release occurred with any bacterial strain. The organoclay was able to fully retain the surrogate pollutant over a 3-day period. Follow-up testing will examine the interactions between microorganisms and sorbed pollutants in organoclay under anaerobic conditions and over extended periods of time.

A NOVEL SYNTHESIS OF MFCS ON THE REDUCTION OF CHEMICAL OXYGEN DEMAND IN WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANTS
Vincent Andrew Zampelli
Conrad Weiser Area High School, Robesonia, PA

Wastewater plants use surface-aerated basins to eliminate 80 to 90% of organic material measured as chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). Surface-aerated basins have a limited range of operating temperatures. A microbial fuel cell (MFC) uses bacteria to convert chemical energy to electrical energy through substrate oxidation. This project studied the potential for application of MFCs in wastewater treatment plants. The fuel cells could generate electrical energy for operations and provide for the reduction of COD and BOD. For this study, MFCs were built and operated for over 40 days. The testing demonstrated the MFC is capable of reducing COD by up to 90%. The effects of spacing the anode and cathode in the microbial fuel cell were studied additionally. The results show that the two electrodes should be placed close together, indicating that increased proton transfer is more important in the design of the MFC than high internal resistance. There were no measured variations in the electrical output at different operating temperatures. The best design produced an operating voltage of 114 mV. The results of this study show that power can be produced from microbial fuel cells and the natural organic matter in wastewater. Microbial fuel cells could be used to reduce organic material in wastewater treatment plants. Additional studies of fuel cell geometry could improve overall efficiencies and operating voltage.

DEVELOPMENT OF A SIMPLE SCREENING METHOD AND BASIC KEY OF NEMATODES: THE ASSESMENT OF SOIL ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND GUIDE TO MANAGEMENT OF RECLAMATION AT OIL AND GAS WELLSITES
Laura B. Lane
Aztec High School, Aztec, NM

Energy Companies must reclaim abandoned wellsites and access roads. Reclamation involves recontouring, restoring topsoil, and reestablishing native vegetation. Reestablishing plant biodiversity quickly is desired and minimizes soil erosion, protects surface water and provides forage for animals. It typically takes two to five years to revegetate a site if the soil conditions are favorable. <br><br>Suitable topsoil is the key for the establishment of healthy plant communities. It can take hundreds of years to develop suitable topsoil and the preservation of topsoil is a critical conservation issue in maintaining a sustainable environment. <br><br>Last year potential indicators for the status of wellsite reclamation were studied. Soil chemistry was found to be an affective indicator for acceptable soil conditions; while the nematodes were inconclusive (screened for crop parasitic nematodes). The goal of this research project was to identify a simple screening method and develop a key for the detection of nematodes commonly found in topsoil in the Four Corners. <br><br>A modified Baermann-Funnel method has been show as an inexpensive, rapid, and effective method for nematodes screening. A simple nematodes key has been developed from soil samples collected at wellsites in the Four Corners. It is premature to assess the effectiveness of the key and nematode screening as a tool in the assessment of soil ecosystem health and to guide management of reclamation projects. However, continuation of this line of research may prove to be a promising method of assessing reclamation in the future.

THE EFFECTS OF PESTICIDES ON THE VIABILITY OF ARTEMIA FRANCISCANA, INCLUDING VERIFICATION AND IMPACT OF THEIR USE AS AN ALTERNATIVE NITROGEN SOURCE FOR COMPOSTING - PHASE II ALEXA LUNT WEBER HIGH, PLEASANT VIEW, UTAH
Alexa Anne Lunt
Weber High School, Pleasant View, UT

This investigation addressed the use of brine shrimp as an alternative nitrogen source for composting biodegradable materials on a commercial scale. Prior research indicated that discarded brine shrimp are an effective nitrogen source, but verification was needed for large, commercial scale composting. While conducting this investigation, the brine shrimp supply declined and an immediate question of what could be impacting the viability of the brine shrimp was addressed. With detectable levels of pesticides present in the Great Salt Lake, research was conducted on the effects of pesticides on the hatch and survival rates of brine shrimp.<br><br> Tests were conducted by incrementally decreasing the percentage of pesticides (1% to .12%) added to the brine solution. Three measures were used to indicate the effect of the pesticide: hatch, survival, and partial hatch rates. The data indicates that pesticides cause a 70% decrease in the hatch rate.<br><br> Four measures were used to indicate the quality of the compost: heavy metals, sodium and nitrogen levels, and the rate of composting. Results from the composting piles indicate that active and ideal conditions were met. The data validated that brine shrimp produced a higher quality commercial scale compost than the control group. <br><br> Discarded brine shrimp are a viable nitrogen source for composting. However, the production of brine shrimp is threatened by the use of pesticides that drain into the Great Salt Lake. The use of brine shrimp in composting reduces waste and creates a valuable resource.

Carmel Pak U Secondary School, Hong Kong, CHINA

China is categorized as one of the most water-stricken countries in the world. On the other hand, sea water is rich in supply. The water crisis is said to be greatly eased if sea water can be desalinated to a certain extent that allows us to drink. Growing plants in seawater to remove salt may be an alternative way instead. This method is environmentally friendly, will not generate any pollutants and helps to maintain the balance of carbon dioxide cycle. Besides, pure water can be collected by condensation and transpiration of the plants. <br><br>In this project, the following would be investigated.<br><br>(a) Identification of suitable plants such as tomatoes and silver queens that have potential to desalinate sea water using titrations.<br><br>(b) Identification of suitable working conditions to facilitate desalination of sea water by some plants using PET bottles and bell jars (analogue to greenhouses).<br><br>(c) Observing the growth of tomatoes on-the-spot in salty water at different concentrations.<br><br>(d) Constructing a multi-storey greenhouse.<br><br>Results: 1. For silver queen, its desalination capacity could last over a month with a significant reduction of concentration of chloride ion of 11.5%. <br><br>2. Transpired water released by tomoto (0.75g/day), lucky bamboo (0.82g/day) and silver queen (0.70g/day) was much higher than that of mere condensation (0.12g/day) in PET bottles and bell jars.<br><br>3. Tap water Condensed water Transpired water<br><br>*Mass of chloride ion per litre (g) 0.221 0.0486 0.148<br><br>* water with mass of chloride ion <0.25g/L (WHO)<br><br>Growing plants such as tomatoes and silver queen, in multi-storey greenhouse definitely would increase the production of water suitable for drinking. Besides, after irrigation using seawater, food stuff such as tomatoes which were tastier could be marketed.

ELECTRONIC DEVICE WITH MOISTURE SENSOR FOR THE OPERATION OF IRRIGATION SYSTEMS
Felipe Augusto Vitoriano
Escola de Educacao Basica e Profissional Dona Sinha Neves, Sao Joao Del Rei, MG, BRASIL

Water waste is one of the most serious environmental problems of the present times. Solutions need to be encountered. Conscious consumption must be constantly practiced so that it reflects on the productive chain present in daily life. This study aimed at building a prototype of an electronic device with a moisture sensor for the operation of irrigation systems. The prototype was built with the following elements: an electronic circuit and an adapted irrigation system. In the electronic circuit, transistors, diodes, resistors, trim-pot, relay, LDR and white high brightness LED were used. In the adapted irrigation system, a water pump for car’s windscreens, an aquarium hose and a water reservoir were used. The sensor is economically viable, easily applied and can rationalize the use of water, since the irrigation system is activated only when the moisture sensor “informs” that the soil needs water. After assembly and tests, other applications have been identified: positioning the sensor at the maximum level of a river, brook or stream a siren/warning could be activated so that the people living by the rivers would not be taken by surprise with the floods; in slopes where there is risk of landslide the sensor could be placed at a depth where theoretically there could not be water, and in case it happened, the sensor would warn about the eminent danger. Further studies are necessary to test the viability of these new hypothesis.

MURDERING WHILE GARDENING: THE EFFECT OF LIQUID FERTILIZER RUN-OFF ON HEART RATE AND VIABILIY OF DAPHNIA MAGNA
Young-Ah Lee
York High School, Yorktown, VA

The purpose of the experiment was to investigate how liquid fertilizers used in domestic agriculture can harm aquatic ecosystems and marine lives, such as Daphnia magna. The objective was to find out which brand of liquid fertilizer gathered from run-off will decrease the heart rate and viability of Daphnia magna the most. <br><br>The experiment as conducted by adding three solutions of 3.5mL of each fertilizer (Miracle-Gro, Master Collection, Jack's Classic), gathered from the run-off and 80mL of pure spring water into a colony of Daphnia magna. The heart rate was measured over the period till death with recording device and microscope, counting the heart beats per minute. Viability was observed over the period till death by counting the living daphnia, starting with ten viable Daphnia. The average heart rate and viability percentage were calculated from analyzing the data.<br><br>The data illustrated that Miracle-Gro decreased the viability by 1205.82% per hour, Jack's Classic decreased it by 1.45% per hour, and Master Collection decreased it by 1.02% per hour. It illustrated that Miracle-Gro decreased the heart rate by 21 beats per minute (bpm), Jack's Classic decreased it by 9.12bpm, and Master Collection decreased it by 2.71bpm.<br><br>The conclusion agreed with the hypothesis, stating that Miracle-Gro will decrease the heart rate and viability the most. The inability to control the amount of soil going into the fertilizers run-off could have skewed the results. A suggested improvement was to acquire more Daphnia and time to conduct more trials to produce more precise results.

SYNTHESIS OF NOVEL IRON-OXIDE-SILICA HYBRID ADSORPTIVE MEDIA FOR ARSENIC REMOVAL
Brittany Hsu
Jericho High School, Jericho, NY

Hybrid iron-silica media have been shown to be effective adsorbents for removing a wide range of heavy metals from drinking water. Fiberglass offers a potentially attractive starting material for the preparation of hybrid adsorbents due to its low cost and high specific surface area. This study investigated the ability of chemical pretreatment methods to improve iron-oxide retention on fiberglass fibers and arsenic adsorption. Two pretreatment methods using pH 2 coating and silane coating were considered. After pretreatment, the fibers were coated with iron oxide using an established coating procedure under a variety of pH and temperature conditions. Iron retention was assessed by acid digestion followed by atomic adsorption spectroscopy. Coating conditions of low pH and high temperature, used to coat pH 2-pretreated fibers, were found to result in greater iron retention on fibers. The silane pretreatment was found not to improve the mass of iron retained by the fibers. However, electron microscopy indicated that the surface morphology of the silanized fiberglass was much more uniform than that of the other fibers, where the iron-oxide deposits as nodules. Therefore, silane-pretreated fibers appear to be promising as the more uniform iron oxide coating would be expected to have more readily available adsorption sites, which reduces mass-transfer resistance. Arsenic adsorption studies using plasma mass spectroscopy further validated this conclusion since greater amounts of arsenic were removed with low temperature silane pretreatment. These findings are relevant to development of cost-effective adsorption-based treatment methods for the removal of contaminants such as arsenic, uranium, and lead.

BIOGAS PRODUCTION FROM HUMAN ORGANIC WASTE
Melanie Perez
Jose Rojas Cortes High School, Orocovis, PUERTO RICO

This investigation seeked to determine if the organic wastes from a septic tank can produce biogas through the process of anaerobic digestion. The hypothesis established that organic wastes from a septic tank can produce biogas.<br><br> This investigation was undertaken with an analysis of microbial growth in water carrying organic wastes. The anaerobic microbial count revealed that residual water (from a septic tank) contained an average growth of 6,250 bacteria per milliliter. To demonstrate that organic wastes from a septic tank can produce biogas through anaerobic digestion, a gas pipe system with a pressure gauge (psi) and release-valves added to a pressure pot was designed. Three pounds of fresh human organic wastes and one pound of water taken from a septic tank were put into the pressure pot, which played the role of an anaerobic biodigestor. The pot was placed inside an acrylic box containing a 120W bulb to keep a constant temperature of 25o C. After six weeks, considering that the anaerobic digestion had concluded, the pipe system was connected to a lab burner.<br><br>A flame that was produced by the biogas coming from the pressure pot confirmed the presence of methane, without which no combustion would have taken place. The result demonstrated that organic wastes from a septic tank, through anaerobic digestion, can be used to produce biogas.

BIOCONVERSION OF VEGETATIVE WASTES COMBINED WITH COW EXCREMENT TO PRODUCE A SOURCE OF ENERGY
Nathalie Albaladejo-Quiles
Lino Padron Rivera High School, Vega Baja, PUERTO RICO

There is a serious situation with the generation and disposition of solid wastes because there are almost no landfills left. Is it possible that the combination of vegetative wastes and cow excrement produce biogas that can be used as a source of energy and at the same time solve the problem with the management of these wastes. The hypothesis studied was: If the anaerobic digestion of vegetative wastes together with excrement is viable for the production of biogas at great scale then a waste management plan will be of a great environmental and economic value. A 55 gallon anaerobic biodigestor was built to evidence the production of biogas using this method. The same amount of cow excrement and triturated vegetative waste were fed into the biodigestor. The production of biogas was evidenced with the flame test. Since it is possible to produce biogas using this method a waste management plan was proposed to solve these two wastes disposal problem. It was calculated that recovering and using 50% of each of these wastes generated in the island will produce energy up to 450,206 kilowatts per day. It is concluded that the waste management plan here proposed is viable in terms of waste availability, economic benefits in terms of electricity production at a low cost and environmental benefits in terms of the reduction of gas emissions that produce the greenhouse effect and global warming and the reduction of solid wastes in the landfills.

THE EFFECTS OF COMPOST ON THE STEM GROWTH OF THE PLANT "CAPSICUM ANNUUM"
Andres Alexis Rosario- Abreu
University Gardens High School, San Juan, PUERTO RICO

Compost is the result of the controlled biological decomposition of organic residue. It is a type of fertilizer that can be made from organic residue disposed of at home. The objective of this investigation was to demonstrate the effectiveness of compost by observing the growth of “Capsicum annuum” (green pepper). The hypothesis was that the compost will be more effective than commercial soil in the stem growth process of the Capsicum annuum plant. The compost consisted of residues from the home such as: vegetable peels, eggshells, coffee grinds and wood chips. They were left to break down in a compost bin to which water was added as needed. The experiment consisted of two groups of ten plants each; one group was planted in compost and the other one in commercial soil. The growth of each plant from each soil was compared daily. Each kind of soil was tested for pH, for phosphorous, nitrogen and potassium content in order to find out the concentration of each nutrient in each kind of soil. The plants grown in compost had a higher net average growth than the plants grown in commercial soil. Compost has high levels of nitrogen, potassium and phosphorous which help the plant grow effectively. In conclusion, compost is more effective for the growth of “Capsicum annuum” plant since compost provides all the nutrients required for a plant’s growth.

RECYCLED COMPOSITE MATERIAL MADE FROM NON-RECYCLABLE MULTILAYER FILM PLASTIC PACKAGING WASTE
Hetal Kanjibhai Vaishnav
Late Shree S.G Dholakiya Memorial High School, Rajkot, Gujarat, INDIA

My project aims to convert typically non-recyclable multilayered film plastic packaging waste via appropriate heat treatment into a useful composite material.<br><br>Plastic packaging made up of multilayer films (e.g. chips packets) is usually not recycled. Such multilayers are made for example from metallized polymers or combinations of different polymers. While these materials can be recycled individually, but the multilayered packaging wastes are not normally recycled as separation of components is neither easy nor economical.<br><br>My recycling process is novel as it does not require separation of multilayer film of plastic making it economic and time saving. Further, the recycling process is simple, and does not require additional chemicals, binder or solvents.<br><br>This process starts from collection of such plastic waste, removing dust and cutting it into small pieces. After this, the waste pieces are washed with hot water, dried with hot air gun and pre-heated at a moderate temperature until they fuse with each other. These fused pieces are then passed through hand moulding machine to convert them into homogenous pellets. These pellets are then ground and screened. As a result, a powdered composite material is obtained. <br><br>This composite powder is suitable for further use via extrusion moulding, injection moulding, or compression moulding for making various articles for different applications. The sheets made from this material were tested and found to have negligible water absorption. By adding various pigments different colours were obtained. This composite material also possesses very good properties like nail holding, screw holding and can easily be fabricated into any desired shape. Standardized laboratory tests carried out by external testing laboratories show that density, auto ignition temperature, water absorption etc. of this material is similar or better than that of plywood/MDF, thus making this recycled composite a novel substitute for plywood/MDF in many applications.

IN-STREAM BIOREACTORS: N2O PRODUCERS?
Zachary Alexander Elgood
Cameron Heights Collegiate Institute, Kitchener, Ontario, CANADA

Nitrate (NO3) is a major contaminant of water bodies in agricultural areas, and can cause excessive growth of algae, leading to Oxygen (O2) depletion, harming aquatic life and contaminating drinking water sources. The use of bioreactors is becoming more common in removing NO3 from surface waters in heavily impacted agricultural areas. This study examines NO3 removal and Nitrous Oxide (N2O) production in an in-stream woodchip bioreactor in Southern Ontario. Dissolved NO3 and N2O samples were collected above the reactor and at the outflow from October 4th 2008 to March 1st 2009. Bubble samples were also collected periodically from the sediments above the reactor. NO3-N removal ranged from 18% in colder periods to 85% during warmer temperatures. Dissolved N2O values ranged from 2.37 to 6.78 micro grams per litre. The potential N2O-N flux ranged between 1.0-6.8 mg/m2/day, with the highest values produced in colder temperatures. These values represent a minimum estimate of flux as bubble samples contained concentrations much higher than atmospheric values. The data suggests that the advantages of NO3 removal may outweigh the disadvantages of N2O production. However, additional research is required to determine the full range of seasonal variation of N2O and other greenhouse gases (GHGs), specifically methane. Future designs of bioreactors must attempt to maximize NO3 removal and minimize GHG production.

MICROBIAL FUEL CELLS: ONE LOW-COST SOLUTION FOR TWO EXPENSIVE PROBLEMS
Katherine Elisa Ruiz-Diaz
Radians High School, Cayey, PUERTO RICO

An attractive solution to the growing issues of the costs of energy production and wastewater treatment is the use of microbial fuel cells (MFCs). Most MFCs are constructed in order to generate more power but have increasing cost. In this study, a two chamber mediator MFC was constructed using two plastic canisters and assembled with other inexpensive materials (PVC tubes, agar, and carbon electrodes) available at local department and hardware stores (cost: $15). Two MFCs were developed and compared. The first, using corn syrup as substrate, yeast as inoculums, and Methylene blue as redox mediator, generates maximal potential (188.8 to 230.3 mV) and power density (1.34 to 1.68 W/m2) in the first 72 hours. The other MFC was assembled using a mixture of Cow’s manure, compost, soil, and sediment water (as a wastewater substitute), generating a potential of 283.34 to 588.48 mV and a power density of 5.40 to 18.41 W/m2 in the first 72 hours. In other words, it generates a potential of 2 to 3 times greater than the yeast MFC and approximately ten times the power per meter square electrode area. The power density per cost ratio is approximately 0.0697 W/m2 per dollar for the yeast MFC, and 0.58 W/m2 per dollar for the cow manure MFC. The study demonstrates that it is possible to use a mixture of wastes from agricultural and livestock industries by using a relatively inexpensive MFC for electricity production, giving solution for two big problems: low cost energy production and bioremediation of wastewater.

BIOREMEDIATION: THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PSEUDOMONAS PUTIDA WHEN VARYING LEVELS OF CARBON
Allison Elizabeth Ramsey
Southeastern Junior/Senior High School, Augusta, IL

It was the focus of this project to determine the effectiveness of Pseudomonas putida as a bioremediation agent. Pseudomonas putida was tested in simulated aquatic environments with varied amounts of carbon. The oil degrading process was measured. It was hypothesized that as the carbon level increased, the rate of bioremediation by the Pseudomonas putida would decrease. <br><br> An oil measurement method was developed and the accuracy of the technique was determined. The effectiveness of Pseudomonas putida in the bioremediation of oil was conducted by creating various simulated aquatic environments in test tubes. The first environment contained Miracle-Gro, carbon, water, bacteria, and oil. The second environment contained carbon, water, bacteria, and oil. The final environment contained oil and bacteria only. The bacteria remained in the environments for four weeks and results were gathered weekly. The remaining oil was measured using the oil measurement method developed prior to experimentation with an electronic scale. Four trials for each environment were conducted and averages were calculated. <br><br> After reviewing the results, it was determined that as the amount of carbon level increased, the rate of bioremediation using Pseudomonas putida did not decrease. Therefore, the hypothesis for this experimentation was rejected. Statistics showed that the bacteria had no significant effect on the oil deterioration. Experimental error has been examined and more experimentation is planned.

PECAN ELIXIR: A NATURAL HERBICIDE PHASE TWO
Minda Chelsea Backus
Beaufort Academy, Beaufort, SC

While walking around in my grandparents’ yard I have always been curious as to why pecan trees never have any kind of growth under them. I found out during my 2008 research that pecan trees produce a chemical known as juglone, which is naturally present in pecan trees. I discovered that an elixir made from boiling the hulls, leaves, and stems produced a natural herbicide, which did indeed kill plants. I tested the homemade pecan elixir against two commercial herbicides. The pecan elixir did effectively kill the plants, except just not as rapidly as the Spectracide and Roundup. <br><br> In 2009, I expanded testing data using grasses that are native in the southeastern United States. I tested different strengths of the pecan elixir to see if a weaker solution would kill the ground covers. I also believed that a stronger solution of the herbicide would kill plants at a faster rate. In my research, I discovered that perhaps the chemical juglone would interfere with photosynthesis and respiration; I tested portions of the plant leaves before they were treated and observed photosynthesis taking place. I again tested the leaves after they had been treated many times and observed the decline and absence of photosynthesis and respiration.<br><br> My results concluded over a period of time that the weaker the strength of the pecan herbicidal elixir, the longer it took for plant death to occur. The stronger the elixir, the decay and death occurred more rapidly in all circumstances. My hypothesis was therefore supported.

THE EFFECTS OF RECYCLED RUBBER MULCH ON PHASEOLUS VULGARIS PLANTS IN A HYDROPONICS SYSTEM
Michael Tron Sherman
Mansfield High School, Mansfield, MO

Recycled rubber mulch can be used in hydroponics systems to replace expensive mulches such as vermiculite and perlite. Using rubber mulch can provide an alternate solution to discarding used tires and may remove them from landfills. In the United States alone there are more than two billion used tires. <br><br>In trial one, four varieties of Phaseolus vulgaris seeds were placed in petri dishes to sprout. After seven days the sprouts were sorted into groups of sixteen and planted into wick hydroponics systems. Two growing mediums used for the hydroponics systems and one soil medium was used. The hydroponics growing mediums were rubber mulch and a fifty-fifty mixture of vermiculite and perlite. After three days the plants were resorted for trial two. <br><br>In trial two the surviving plants of each variety were separated into three equal groups and sorted into a redesigned submersion hydroponics system using the same three mediums. <br><br> In conclusion, the recycled tire mulch worked as well as soil and traditional hydroponic media in some of the varieties. According to a student t-test, the recycled tire mulch showed significant differences in reduced height and leaf width in two varieties of the beans. Variety 1 and variety 2 showed less height (p=.02, p=.05) when compared to the vermiculite/perlite medium, and less leaf width (p=.0001, p=3.1x10-6) than the vermiculite/perlite group. Variety 3 showed only a significant difference in height when the recycled tire mulch was compared to the soil (p=.02). No significant differences were observed in variety 4 among the trial media.

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WATER QUALITY AND THE PRESENCE OF NEASCUS SPP. IN WARM WATER FISHES
Lina Chih- Lin Wang
Loyola High School, Mankato, MN

The purpose of this project was to see if there was a relationship between water quality and the presence of Neascus spp. in fishes. My hypothesis is that nitrates, orthophosphorus (OP) and total suspended solids (TSS) will not have an effect on the presence of Neascus spp. <br><br> The first step of the procedure was performed by taking water quality data from the Water Resources Center at Minnesota State University: Mankato. The fish samples were collected at various sites located on the Blue Earth, Watonwan, Le Sueur, and Maple Rivers in the surrounding areas of Mankato, MN, USA. The fish were then identified using a dichotomous key, measured by standard length, and examined for Neascus spp. The data was run through a simple linear regression analysis computer program where the p-value and R value were calculated. Then a multiple linear regression analysis computer program was run and the p-value and R² value were calculated. The p-value, R value, and R² value results were analyzed for a correlation between water quality and the presence of Neascus spp. per site. <br><br> In conclusion, TSS and OP were determined to be the most biologically significant factors in the presence of Neascus spp. Total phosphorus, clarity, and nitrates are not biologically significant. Therefore, 2/3 of my hypothesis was proved false.

AQUATIC MACROINVERTEBRATES OF THE ROSE GARDEN POND: A LONGITUDINAL STUDY
Grace Laureli Lisius
Home school, Redford, MI

My project's purpose was to create a two-year longitudinal study of the aquatic macroinvertebrate life in each of the four corners of the Henry Ford Rose Garden Pond for the function of comparing year one to year two. The application of my body of data and conclusions was to help the University of Michigan-Dearborn naturalists conduct pond habitat management programs in such a way as to minimize detriment to the ecosystem. My hypothesis is that with consecutive weeks of quantitative macroinvertebrate sampling, my data will reflect changes in the condition of the environment from year 1 to year 2.<br><br> I acquired my data every Wednesday at approximately 3 p.m. In each corner of the pond, I netted plant matter and placed it into a water-filled pan. I swished the vegetation and removed it. I captured the macroinvertebrates, identified, counted and recorded them, and then released them, with their vegetation, back into their corner. In addition, each week I recorded water and air temperature, ice thickness, cloud cover and any other observations that may or may not affect my study.

GROUND WATER TESTING AND TREATMENT DESIGN FOR ARSENIC AND HARDNESS REMOVAL
Carlene Jean Ternes
Strasburg Public School, Strasburg, ND

The purpose of my project is to remove arsenic and lower hardness at the same time while keeping pH in balance. My first hypothesis was that the select calcium removal would work better than a split treatment. My second hypothesis was that by adding aluminum sulfate and sodium carbonate at the same time during the mixing process would be the best select calcium removal treatment. My third hypothesis was that the 70/30 ratio would be the best split treatment. I collected three different water samples from three different areas and tested them for arsenic, total hardness, copper, iron, total alkalinity, pH, total and free chlorine, and Nitrate/ Nitrite. I then ran a jar test to determine the desired aluminum sulfate dosage to remove the arsenic. I filled six 400ml beakers with water and each with a different amount of aluminum sulfate. I chose the with .6g of aluminum sulfate because it should the best settling characteristics whiling still accomplishing the goal of particulate removal.I ran three different select calcium removal tests. The first I added .6g sodium carbonate(soda ash) to each three samples of water in 400ml beakers. I mixed it at maximum speed for one minute on a magnetic stirrer, reduced the speed to 50% for fifteen minutes, then I let it settle for one hour. I filtered the water and then added .6g of aluminum sulfate and repeated the magnetic stirrer procedure and let it settle one hour, filtered and tested the sample. The second test I added the .6g of aluminum sulfate and .6g of soda ash at the same time and repeated the magnetic stirrer procedure,let settle one hour, filtered and tested. My third test was the same as the first, except adding aluminum sulfate first, than soda ash. My next type of treatment was a split treatment. I used the ratios 70/30, 60/40, and 50/50. I took 70% of a 400ml sample of water and added a calculated amount of calcium hydroxide(lime).I did the magnetic stirrer procedure then let it settle one hour. I poured the treated water into the 30% untreated water trying not to add the precipitate. I than added a calculated amount of soda ash and performed the magnetic sitter procedure and than finally filtered the sample and tested it. My results showed that they all reduced hardness and removed arsenic but the split treatments used the least amount of chemicals. I then designed a treatment plan for arsenic and hardness removal that was effective yet relatively cheap.

HYDROLYSIS REACTION RATES AND SURFACTANT FUNCTIONS OF PLASTICS
Courtney Gail Reed
Parkview High School, Lilburn, GA

The purpose was to determine which plastic – polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), or polylactic acid (PLA) – had the highest reaction rate during ester hydrolysis, while the soap test after hydrolysis tested whether the resulting solutions could function as surfactants. The hypothesis stated the PLA should react the most quickly, PET the second most quickly, and PP not at all; however, PLA and PET should both function as surfactants. The independent variable during hydrolysis was the substance hydrolyzed by the NaOH, and during the soap test it was the solution into which the oil was poured. The dependent variables were the reaction rate during the first procedure and the ability of the solution to function as a surfactant during the second. The first procedure consisted of adding plastic to 3.00M NaOH and heating it under reflux for thirty minutes, and the second procedure consisted of pouring oil into the resulting solutions, stirring, and qualitatively recording the results. The results did support the hypothesis, showing that the NaOH was only able to break the C-O bonds in esters but not propenes, and the solutions containing salts of carboxylic acids were able to function as emulsion surfactants.

COLOR AND TEXTURE OF ROOFING MATERIALS AND THEIR EFFECTS ON GLOBAL WARMING AND REVERSING THE ALBEDO EFFECT
Daniel Burnett Eisler
Ocean Springs High School, Ocean Springs, MS

For my science project I investigated what roofing materials would be a sufficient way to help reverse global warming and the albedo effect. My Hypothesis was that lighter colored glossy roofing materials like white tile would be a good solution. To investigate this I planned to measure the amount of heat and light a variety of materials would absorb and reflect. I planned to do this by placing each material one at a time into a cooler, and apply heat from a lamp to each material. I situated a solar panel at an angle to the material from the light source and measured the amount of light reflected by means of a voltage meter. Then I measured the increase in air temperature within the chest showing the heat absorption of each. With these figures I calculated the affect each material would have on our atmosphere in comparison to current roofing materials in terms of specific heating. My interpretation of my results showed that currently used materials are the worst overall. The trend continued in the pattern of shingles being the worst, metals being average, and tiles being best, with lighter glossier colors did better than darker rougher materials. My controlled variables will be the duration of heating, the number of temperature readings, the size of each material, and the conditions of the room in which the experimenting takes place.

TURNING THE OCEAN UPSIDE DOWN: A STUDY IN TRENDS OF COASTAL UPWELLING ALONG THE PACIFIC COAST
Harish Srikar Vemuri, Maanas Tripathi, Peter Landgren
Westview High School, Portland, OR

Over the past 75 years, 90% of the world’s salmon have died, many from starvation while smoltifying. Upwelling is the phenomenon that brings nutrients to the ocean surface and provides an ecosystem for the juvenile salmon to feed on. Sustained upwelling occurs once each year, an event known as the spring transition. This project uses wavelet based methodologies to determine the date of sustained coastal upwelling along the Pacific Northwest coast. Previous methods were based on low-pass filtering of daily sea level height (SLH) and the Coastal Upwelling Index (CUI), which is calculated from sea level wind fields. Wavelet methods, applied to sea level only, avoid the problems of dependence on filter choice and the limited availability of CUI, and thus utilize the entire 110 year tidal record as opposed to the previous maximum of 42 years.<br><br> <br><br>The novel wavelet method has shown to be more consistent than the combined SLH/CUI and biological methods for 1967-present, and it differs in one major aspect: the aggregate of previous data had shown an unreasonable rate of change of 50 days/century for the spring transition. The wavelet method shows a nearly stationary spring transition and decreased length of the summer growing season.<br><br> <br><br>The wavelet-based method provides a solution to the problems posed by current low-pass filter and biological methods, with the eventual capability to show century-scale changes in climate-sensitive ecosystems. Comparative testing shows that this method has the potential to become the new standard for future upwelling detection methods.

NAVY SCUM: A STUDY OF THE PREVENTION OF BIOFILM
Brian Anthony Truong, Rohan Virang Shah, 
R.C. Clark High School, Plano, TX

The Department of Defense spends over $21 billion annually in repairing corrosion and scraping algae off ship hulls. The hypothesis states that lactoferrin would be the most effective in preventing biofilm growth. Two experiments were conducted. First, boats were created using model boats, waterproof paint, an additive (chitosan, lactoferrin, and habañero), and steel tape to simulate Navy Ships. A drag test consisting of a trough, pulley, and Photogate then tested the effectiveness of the additives. On average after two weeks, boats with just paint reduced speed by 10.44% in the freshwater algae (Chlorella) and 11.47% in the saltwater algae (Platymonas). Contrastingly, boats with habañero juice decreased merely 0.41% in Chlorella and 0.82% in Platymonas. The second test involved making wooden blocks similar to the boats as they were placed into algae tanks and swabbed two weeks later to obtain algae density pictures. The pictures show relating results to the drag test. The hypothesis was disproved; however, habañero-equipped boats reduced significant amounts of algae and the concurrent drag. Therefore, habañero pepper juice could be mixed with paint on ships in order to prevent biofilm and more importantly, superfluous costs spent in repairing the corrosion from algae. This organic solution to the biofouling problem would decrease drag and the necessity of fuel for ships as well as remove algae from swimming pools and water piping systems. Since the Navy has protected the United States, a small gesture to give in return would be to take their hands off the problems of biofilm.

A DESIGN FOR THE PRODUCTION OF ELECTRICITY FROM EXHAUST GASES AND SCRAP METALS
Moutaz Ma'an Al-Huneidi, Omar Khresat, 
Modern Montessori School, Amman, JORDAN

Over the past decades the world's primary energy source has been fossil fuels, being an efficient source of energy and easy to transport. But this source has many drawbacks, as it is limited in supply and upon its combustion harmful pollutants are released into the air. So we decided to design a system in which we make use of the said harmful pollutants by collecting and then preparing an acidic solution from them. The produced solution would then react with the unrecycled metals, such as cans, to produce hydrogen, which, in turn, would be burned to power a generator, thus producing electricity from everyday "wastes".<br><br>After research and experiments, the basic design was laid, which was developed with the experiment we conducted. Problems were faced and through further experimenting the solutions were found, which eventually led us to the final design of our system and all of its components.<br><br>The final system consists of four units; the first being the combustion chamber where diesel is burned in a manner that no fumes are lost. The second being the water tank where the acidic solution is prepared from the exhaust gases from the burner. The third unit, the reactor, where the scrap metals are added to the produced solution; and the reaction takes place, with hydrogen gas evolving as a product. The fourth part, being the gas collection tank, where the produced hydrogen is stored to be burnt, thusly providing us with a safer, greener and more sustainable energy source.

A NEW MATERIAL THAT COULD ABSORB BOTH MICROWAVE AND RADIOWAVE RADIATION.
Omar Haroun Gharaibeh, Maher Zghondi, 
Modern Montessori School, Amman, JORDAN

Each day we are exposed to high intensity of microwave radiations from the microwave transmitters around us. For instance microwave radiation is used in industries such as oil, PVC and for extracting non-conductive row materials. Microwave radiation causes serious health risks or problems, and even the researches concerning the harm and danger of the radiations is not yet fully developed. <br><br>Our goal in this project is to find a suitable way in order to decrease the exposure and thus the harm f microwave radiation. In order to reach our goal, we conducted several experiments; and by these experiments we where able to find the best microwave and radio wave absorbing material. Plus we also prove that the microwave radiation has an effect on living organisms, by conducting an experiment for the effect of microwave radiation on flowering plants. <br><br>Our final design of our absorbing material was tested and tested several times to insure its efficiency. The results where overwhelming, the efficiency reached 100%. We also tested our material in big range of microwave radiation reaching 3GHz.

HOST-RANGE STUDY TO DETERMINE THE POTENTIAL OF LYSIPHLEBUS ORIENTALIS AS A BIOLOGICAL CONTROL AGENT FOR EXOTIC INVASIVE SOYBEAN APHIDS (APHIS GLYCINES)
Sahar NMI Hakim-Hashemi, Sierra Elizabeth Danforth, 
Breck School, Golden Valley, MN

Invasive soybean aphids (Aphis glycines), which were inadvertently introduced to the United States from Asia, have destroyed millions of acres of soybean crops (Glycine max). We conducted a host-range study to determine if an Asian parasitoid wasp (Lysiphlebus orientalis) could be safely used to biologically control soybean aphids. We determined parasitism rates of L. orientalis wasps on soybean aphids and nine non-target aphid species that are phylogenetically close to soybean aphids or inhabit plants grown near soybean crops. In addition, we determined emergence rates of adult L. orientalis wasps. <br><br> Parasitism results showed that L. orientalis wasps parasitized soybean aphids at a higher rate (46.0%) than they parasitized other aphids (0.0%-32.6%). Emergence results suggested that the wasps can successfully maintain an ongoing population on soybean aphids. Results also showed that six non-target aphid species had parasitism rates of < 2.0%, which is defined as ecologically safe by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Another aphid species showed a parasitism rate of 22.6%, but the 0.0% emergence rate of L. orientalis wasps suggests that the wasps will not maintain a population on these aphids. Two other non-target pest aphid species were parasitized at rates of 24.0%-33.0% with emergence rates of 92.0% and 76.5%, which have been deemed acceptable by the USDA for these pest aphids. Further work will include a host-range study for nine other non-target aphid species before the USDA will approve the release of L. orientalis as a biological control agent for soybean aphids.

CONDENSATE CLEAN UP: INVESTIGATIONS OF BIOREMEDIATION FOR SOIL CONTAMINATION BY NATURAL GAS CONDENSATE
Maggie Rose Hudlow, Emily Johnston, 
Pinedale High School, Pinedale, WY

Sublette County in southwest Wyoming is experiencing environmental changes due to extensive natural gas development. Natural gas is an important resource, nationally and globally. However, the process of extracting gas produces condensate, one of several toxic byproducts. Condensate is a low-density mixture of hydrocarbons and is typically found in liquid form in gas pipelines. Despite precautions, accidental spills occur, resulting in contaminated soil. When spills do occur, they are either ignored, cleaned by adding more chemicals, or treated by land farming. Because soil reclamation is key to vegetation regrowth an investigation of bioremediation for soil contamination by natural gas condensate was conducted. <br><br>Questions and methods addressed the initial contamination and bioremediation strategies. Soil collected from a drilling site was contaminated in a lab setting with natural gas condensate, resulting in strongly altered soil chemistry profile and no vegetation regrowth. When horse manure and pseudomonas bacteria were added to the contaminated soil to test for bioremediation potential, soil chemistry was sufficiently improved for successful germination of plants. After a two week bioremediation treatment period, seeds were sown into the horse manure and pseudomonas soil tests. Sterile wheat thrived in the manure treatment, while pseudomonas produced prime conditions for rye grass. After two week’s growth both plants proved phytoremediation success as soil chemistry profiles returned to original levels.<br><br>This investigation has proven the potential for sterile wheat and rye grass, used in combination with horse manure and pseudomonas, to excel in phytoremediation of condensate contaminated soil.

RESCUING OUR NATURAL WATERS AND WETLANDS: FIGHTING OIL SPILLS THROUGH BIOREMEDIATION AND BIOSTIMULATION PHASE II
Cassandra Cheta Okoye, Garrett Breaux, 
Ovey Comeaux High School, Lafayette, LA

Since oil spills of a coastal zone are difficult to clean up, implementing an efficient method is important. It is also equally important to develop a method of cleaning up oil spills that does not harm the ecosystem along the coastline. <br><br> The purpose of this study was to determine whether Spartina alterniflora’s health would be affected by using biostimulation for oil spill recovery and investigate the rate of the degradation of oil on a coastal shoreline. Water samples were collected from 3 sites approximately 8 miles apart (increasing salinity levels) along Bayou Terrebonne near Montegut, LA. Parameters measured at each site were: pH, temperature, turbidity, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen. <br><br> Three water samples, three different types of crude oil, Pennzoil, and controls containing no oil were investigated and repeated in multiples of four. All of the plant samples within the biostimulation method were given a 5000. ppm nutrient solution. Of the 120 plants, 60 were subject to biostimulation. Observations and recordings about the plant samples were taken over a forty-eight day period which included the plant shoot heights, percent dead tissue, stem density, wet plant biomass, and volume of oil remaining. At the duration of 30 days, reference oils and samples consisting of the nutrient solution, different salinity levels, and oil types were collected and run through a GCMS.<br><br> Statistical calculations were performed using EXCEL and p < 0.05 were considered to be significant. The results confirmed that biostimulation as opposed to bioremediation caused a significant increase in the degradation using a 5000. ppm nutrient solution at any salinity level. The results also confirmed that all plant samples that contained the 5000. ppm nutrient solution stayed relatively healthy.

AUGMENTATION OF THE HIGHLANDS BIGHORN SHEEP HERD IN SOUTHWEST MONTANA
Christopher Michael Doyle, Danielle M. Bay, 
Butte High School, Butte, MT

Transplanting bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) is a potentially useful management tool to supplement declining herds. Hunting District (HD) 340 in the Highlands and East Pioneer Mountains south of Butte held a large population of sheep that provided premire hunting and viewing opportunities. In 1994-95, this herd suffered a die-off caused by pneumonia. Since then, Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks (FWP) has transplanted sheep into HD 340 in an effort to restore the herd. In February 2007, FWP transplanted 17 sheep from the Ruby Mountains; in January 2008, 65 sheep were transplanted from Sun River. From January 2008 through December 2008 we tracked radio-collared sheep from these herds to study the effectivness of transplanting as a means of augmenting the HD 340 sheep population. Specifically we looked at whether current movement patterns and population demographics were similar to pre die-off conditions and whether transplanted sheep retained fidelity to pre-capture groups post-release. Our study found that there is overlap in the areas used by transplanted sheep compared to pre die-off use, primarily at lower elevations on historic winter range. In addition, we found that current lamb:ewe ratios were lower than pre die-off conditions. This is due primarily to the apparent persistence of lamb pneumonia in this population. Mixing did occur amongst pre-capture sheep groups within six months of release. Recent transplants to HD 340 have increased the overall population size, however, lamb recruitment continues to be low. As herds continue to mix, genetic interchange may occur that could strenghten the overall health of this population.

DOES STREAMSIDE VEGETATION PROTECT WATER QUALITY?
Nathaniel Jay Temple, Jacob Greenfield, 
Martinsburg High School, Martinsburg, WV

Streamside forests can help remove excess nutrients and sediment from surface runoff. The Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program provides farmers money to protect stream water quality by fencing off cattle and planting trees to stop or slow down the high nitrate and Escherichia coli (E. coli) levels. <br><br> Our purpose was to see if vegetation buffers (greater than thirty-five feet) along streams and fenced from cattle protect or stabilize stream water quality. We thought that nitrate and E. coli bacteria levels would be reduced or stay the same in the stream areas with a protected vegetation buffer; because it would prevent the cattle from entering the stream, and help filter erosion. <br><br> We picked five sites that are protected by using tree buffers and are located in Jefferson County, West Virginia and Washington County, Maryland. They ranged in length from 1,250 feet to 2,956 feet and ranged in width from 41 feet to 214 feet. We took two samples at the upstream end and two samples at the downstream end of each site. <br><br> We found that buffers improved or stabilized three out of five streams for the nitrate data, and four out of five streams for the E. coli data. None of the streams violated the EPA standard for nitrates in drinking water at 10 mg/L. Also, going by EPA standards for E. coli, only two streams violated the single sample criteria at 235 CFUs/100mL. Farmers should plant more buffers by the streamside with a fence to prevent entry of cattle and livestock.

Yessica Andrea Elizondo_Hidalgo, Cynthia Fernandez Espinoza, Edwin Xiao Cai
Colegio Cientifico de Costa Rica, Sede de Puntarenas, Puntarenas, COSTA RICA

This project entails the formulation of a method for the extraction of hydroxyapatite (HAp) from fish scales, which was brought about after observing the spoilage of this product in the coastal zones of Puntarenas, Costa Rica. Large amounts of this product are dumped into the estuary or sea, affecting their ecosystems. For this reason, consideration has been given to the need of developing methods that can help to manage this type of solid waste and find ways to reduce environmental contamination. <br><br>The method consists of diluting the scales in an acid medium, precipitating it in a basic medium, washing and calcinating; the latter in order to free the HAp from other substances. <br><br>The Chi-square statistical analysis plus the analyses conducted in laboratories, such as X-ray diffraction, the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and atomic absorption to determine Ca/P molar ratio demonstrate that the substance obtained displays patterns, structure and behavior distinctive of HAp. For this reason, the conclusion arrived at is that it is possible to extract this mineral through the method set forth in this project, by using fish scales.

PHYTOREMEDIATION OF FORMALDEHYDE
Glen Daci, Ardit Curri, 
Turgut Ozal High School, Tirana, ALBANIA

The purpose of our experiment is to remove formaldehyde from contaminated water, that is carcinogenic, by using different kind of plants, like Rubber Plant, English Ivy, Boston Fern and also Orchid Cactus Epithellym, which is known as “Hot Lava”, and measure the efficiency of removal.<br><br>The method used was phytoremediation, simple use of green plants to remove toxic chemicals from the environment, because it is low-cost and producing less waste.<br><br>Five different samples of 40 mg formalin solution (in 100ml H2O) were prepared and in four of them, the plants were cut and immersed, leaving one as Control Group. After waiting for some time, the amounts of formaldehyde were measured. The measurement was done by using Formaldehyde Test Kit, which we ordered from Merck, GERMANY. This kit uses the reaction of Fo-1 reagent with formaldehyde, to form a purple red tetrazine. Then the concentrations are measured semi-quantitatively by the color scale, which ranges from (0-10-20-40-60-100) mg/L HCHO.<br><br>From the observation, the concentration of formaldehyde in each case, in the Control Group, hadn’t change, 40mg/L. That means that during our experiment, formaldehyde didn’t evaporate in the air. Then each of the plants showed their removal qualities by decreasing the formaldehyde’s level in the samples. <br><br>We found that Orchid Cactus Epiphyllum plant removed all the formaldehyde. We conclude that these plants were not only efficient in air, but also in the water. Also we proved that the efficiency of these plants increases by time.

BIOREMEDIATION: UTILIZATION OF THE FUNGUS ASPERGILLUS NIGER ON WASTEWATER TREATMENT
Lucas Hansen, William Lopes, 
Fundacao Escola Tecnica Liberato Salzano Vieira da Cunha, Novo Hamburgo, Rio Grande do Sul, BRASIL

The leather industry generates a large amount of waste. Amongst the pollutants found in the leather wastewater, dyes are present, which are widely used in the leather industry. When dyes are disposed directly onto the environment, they are very toxic to some forms of life and affect the photosynthetic activity of aquatic media. An alternative for the treatment of wastes like these is bioremediation, a technological process through which biological systems are used to treat pollution and to restore the environmental quality by detoxifying pollutants. In the project herein presented, the bioremediation of leather industry wastewater, containing dyes, using the mycelial fungus of the species Aspergillus niger was tested. The research tested the activity on eight different dyes: yellow, blue, orange, black, pink, purple, green and red. A process that enhances the action of the fungus on the dyes was also researched, as well as the action of the fungus on real wastewater samples from different stages of wastewater treatment. The results of the research have shown that the bioremediation with A. niger is of great efficiency on the removal of all the dyes. The bioremediation test where the action of the fungus was enhanced with a stimulant showed the following results – dye removal- : Yellow: 71.3% Blue: 81.4%, Orange: 71.8%, Black: 82.1%, Pink: 75%, Purple: 80.2%, Green: 79.9% and Red: 72.5%. The bioremediation test where a stimulating process was not used showed the following results – dye removal - : Yellow: 55,6% ,Blue: 59,8%Orange: 57,0%, Black: 63,1%, Pink: 45,6%, Purple: 64,5%, Green: 62% and Red: 59,7%. The tests on real wastewater from three different and consecutive stages of wastewater treatment showed removal of dyes in samples from the first stage of treatment (primary treatment), which suggests bioremediation can be applied in this stage. It was concluded that the results were very positive and the bioremediation process is potentially an alternative to the treatment processes that already exist.<br><br>Keywords: Aspergillus niger, bioremediation, dyes, wastewater

NATURAL PICTORIAL EXTRACTION TO PRODUCE INKS AS TOOLS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION
Debora Everlen Alves da Costa, Luan Mariano Duarte, 
Colegio Liceu Estadual de Maracanau, Maracanau, BRASIL

Discarded vegetables from a food distributor were used as the pigments extracts. Those vegetables were: beet, purple cabbage, mauve, annatto, black bean, coffee and also schinus. Three different methods were applied on the extraction: cooking, infusion and liquidification. For the vegetables annatto, black bean and coffee it was applied the cooking method, obtaining the following pigments: norbinix, anttocyanin and fenolics compounds, respectively. The infusion method was applied for the annatto and schinus, obtaining then the pigments bixin and tannins. The method of liquidification in alcoholic solution was used for mauve, beet and purple cabbage, obtaining respectively chlorophyll, betanin e anthocyanin. In order to fix the anthocyanin`s pigments color, lemon and alum were used as mordents. To glue the molecules pigments it was used natural binders, the Arabic gum and the sodium caseinate. We developed the binder sodium caseinate, through the milk protein precipitation – caseine. To produce the sodium caseinate, the rotted milk was put under heating and after that process, the lemon citric acid was added in order to reduce the pH of the solution and precipitate the caseine. The obtained protein was mixed to the sodium bicarbonate, producing a natural binder. The mixture between the pigment and the binder results in the ink. To increase the inks durability, rosemary was used as antifungal. The inks were tested in the following pictorial surfaces: recycled paper, unbleached fabric, fabric-non-fabric and board paper which had satisfactory results. The inks were used by 45 students of second year from a State High School. And also, it was applied with 20 children from an Elementary School in art and environmental education workshops. The possibility to produce natural inks for educational purposes can to be used by schools in general. It demonstrates an environmentally friendly economical attitudes which can help on the advancement of social conscience in view to a balanced harmonious and sustainable development.

THE IMPACT OF ABSCISIC ACID ON THE SEQUESTRATION OF METALS BY EUGLENA GRACILIS
Jacqueline B Bokor, Hannah Berkowitz, 
Long Beach High School, Lido Beach, NY

Euglena gracilis are known to remove unwanted and harmful metals from acid mine drainage systems and sequester them within their vacuoles. Abscisic acid, a stress hormone produced in plants, was introduced to help Euglena gracilis tolerate concentrations of metals in a high-stress environment. A test of five groups with 2.7803g, 2.1387g, 1.8536g, 1.6355g, and 1.4633g of soluble iron (FeSo4) was performed to validate the toleration by Euglena gracilis. Three different sets of tests were 1.8536g of FeSO4 in distilled water, Euglena gracilis, FeSO4 and no abscisic acid as a control, and Euglena gracilis, FeSO4, and four amounts of abscisic acid at 0.0264g/mL, 0.022g/mL, 0.0189g/mL, and 0.0165g/mL. The groups that received abscisic acid removed a significant amount of FeSO4 in comparison to the small amount added to the Petri dishes. The first test for absorbency levels using a spectrophotometer were averaged between 1.135nm and 1.279nm. Similar results were recorded for all groups. With a 95% confidence level the results supported the alternative hypothesis that the addition of abscisic acid could enhance the ability of Euglena gracilis to remove and sequester FeSO4 from the environment at an average rate of 0.8685nm. On a larger scale, abscisic acid added to soil surrounding actual mine drainage systems will permit the Euglena gracilis to remove and sequester greater amounts of metals and prevent the harmful chemicals from smothering plant and animal life.

EVALUATION OF HUMAN THERMAL COMFORT IN OUTDOOR SPACES USING THE WET BULB GLOBE TEMPERATURE INDEX METHOD
Richa Chetan Date, Juliana Park, 
Corona del Sol High School, Tempe, AZ

This project studies how urban materials can contribute to levels of heat stress that a human body may experience. Heat stress is caused by exposure to hot areas and can lead to heat stroke and other life-threatening conditions. Thermal stress is closely related to thermal comfort and attempts to predict the impact of solar radiation, air movement and humidity. To evaluate thermal stress, a Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) apparatus was constructed using simple building materials such as paint cans, ornaments, piping, cement, thermometers and black paint. To collect temperature data, data loggers were attached to nine apparatuses. The apparatuses, which represented human bodies, were placed in various urban settings in order to assess environmental influence, and the resulting effects of heat stress on the human body. The data was analyzed using a WBGT Index, which provides a composite measurement of humidity, temperature, air and radiation. The model exhibiting the greatest amount of heat stress was one that was placed in full sun, on concrete, next to a wall. It appeared that this was due to the high levels of heat release onto the model. The model placed in an external environmental temperature-friendly designed complex had the least amount of stress due to its limited exposure to heat. This demonstrates that urban materials are important factors for thermal comfort, and that the WBGT is a useful method to gauge thermal stress. Future research and applications to environmental engineering, architecture, public health, and urban development are discussed.

A BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL APPROACH TO EFFECTIVE DEGREDATION OF KOCHIA
Chelsea Nicole Larson, Josi Arnold-Krumwiede, 
Fleming High School, Fleming, CO

The purpose of this study is to determine an effective approach to the decomposition of kochia; using agents know to decompose cellulose and lignin tissue. Four different fungi that decompose dead plant material (Polyporus versicolor, Chaetomium sp, Sclerotina sclerotiorum and Fibularhizoctonia cartotae) were used and two commercially available stump removers. The stump removers’ active ingredients were either potassium nitrate or sodium disulfite. <br><br>To test the effect of the fungi on the decomposition of kochia, each fungi was inoculated onto two different types of agar containing 0.05 –g samples of dried, sterile kochia. The fungi were allowed to grow and observations were made concerning the growth of the fungi around the kochia. Initial results indicate that all the fungi species, especially Polyporus versicolor, are actively growing on the kochia. <br><br>To test the effect of the chemicals on the decomposition of kochia, 10% solutions of each stump tubs. removers were prepared and sprayed on 1 –g samples of dry, sterile kochia and placed into plastic tubs. Decomposition was measured by massing the kochia and the debris weekly. Results for this portion of the study are pending.<br><br>Preliminary results indicate that both treatments are effective at decomposing kochia.

RECYCOLOGICAL THINKING
Suzanne Victoria Long, Jasmine Benton, 
West Ashley High School, Charleston, SC

The purpose of this study is to change the habits of recycling through the students and teachers at West Ashley High School. If the students and teachers subconsciously train their minds to make the correct decision with recycling, then it will make a lasting impact. The recycling bins have always been used as trash cans in the past; however, this year, that is no longer the case. This project has created opportunities through recycling by creating options for the students and teachers. There are now paper bins, bottle bins, and trash cans in each teacher or faculties member's office and room. <br><br>The materials used in this project started off with a sample of ten teachers, ten bottle bins, 10 paper bins, laminated "bottle only" and "paper only" signs, camera, data collection chart,two large rolling paper bins, one community recycling bin. The point of this project is to prove that if the bins are together then students and teachers will see the options and make the right choice, thus reducing the amount of waste accumulated in the bins and increasing the amount of paper and commingled goods collected. <br><br>The procedures followed in the experiment were the five teachers were given the objective to have their paper bins, bottle bins, and trash cans next to one another in their respective classroom. The other five teachers had the paper bins, bottle bins, and trash cans separated throughout their classrooms. Every week, collection of the recycling bins takes place using the rolling recycling bins. All the trash is collected and counted from the paper and bottles bins. <br><br>The teachers must follow the instructions given to them whether it is having the bins together or having the bins separated. The teachers must also place their bins outside of their classrooms when asked to. Before the project, the teachers were asked a series of questions relating to the past issues to recycling and what they think would make a difference in recycling.<br><br>Our results show that although having the recycling bins next to each together does not significantly reduce the non-recyclable goods collected having specific lids for the bottle bin does.

THE GREEN MACHINE
Stefanie Elizabeth Thibert, Jennifer Van der Wee, 
Queen of Angels Academy, Dorval, Quebec, CANADA

The purpose of the project was to design a composter that will create humus in two weeks instead of two years. This design will reduce waste going to landfills, therefore reducing the pollution entering the atmosphere and surface waters. <br><br> To build this composter six steps were completed: the assembly of the upper mixing chamber; assembly of the outer box; assembly of the air filter; assembly of the inside of the box; assembly of the doors and the electric devices. The Green Machine consists of an outer box made of plywood. It acts as a shell to both chambers, an air filter and the electric devices. With the help of microorganisms, within the first nine days, decomposition occurs in the upper mixing chamber. The process of curing occurs in the lower chamber for the remaining five days.<br><br> The Green Machine was a success for it created humus in fourteen days. The air filter was effective and there was microbial activity. The pH, the moisture and the temperature were also in the appropriate range during the thermophilic and mesophilic decomposition.<br><br> This composter is a major improvement upon traditional composting techniques. It is simple to build, effortless to use, convenient and has financial and environmental benefits. This composter is economical since it produces organic soil for the garden; therefore, eliminating the need to buy soil. On a larger scale, if organic wastes are no longer being sent to landfills, less garbage will be put out weekly, thereby reducing the amount of workers needed.

GETTING FRESH WATERS FROM SUBMARINE SOURCES
Feride Ibraimova, Lutfi Raifov, 
Mezhvodnenska School, Mezhvodnoe, Crimea, UKRAINE

The resources of fresh water in the world, as well in the Crimea (Ukraine) are limited. At the population of half a million people the norm of water consumption is 230 liters per day/ per person. The drilling of water wells results in salinization of fresh water in the aquifer. <br><br>We investigated the alternative solution of getting fresh water from the submarine sources (SFWS) in the shelf not far from the seashore. E.g. at cape Aya (the Crimea) there’s such source with the volume of water flow of 3500 - 4500 м³ per day. This source can satisfy 68% -88% of the demand of Big Yalta city with the population of 80 000 natives and over one million visiting tourists during the summer period. We propose to set a big concrete construction (like a big overturned glass) above a SFWS with a pipe, for fresh water to rise under its own pressure and to be transmitted to the reservoir. <br><br>We made a research on SFWSs at the shores of the Crimea and made the chemical analysis of water out of some SFWSs, according to which the quality of water happen to be very high. We experimented with the model construction, which showed that the water pressure was sufficient enough to lift the water without any additional power resources. We calculated the construction cost, which will be ~$116 000. Taking into consideration that the cost of fresh water in the Crimea in winter is $0.75/m3 and in summer $1.5/m3, the calculations showed the economic efficiency &proved that the ROI will be got in 17 days in summer, or in 44 days in winter. <br><br>If an SFWS is located far from the sea-shore, this construction will also help to protect a source from contamination. The fresh water from these sources can be utilized as water supplies for the ships and submarine boats.<br><br>The research showed that the use of such constructions would help to solve the problem with fresh water supply in the waterfront districts of the Crimea. The proposed solution is economically efficient, environmentally friendly and requires minimum power expenses. It can be easily used/ replicated in other seashore areas of other countries.

SOLANUM NIGRUM AND PSIDIUM GUAJAVA AS A BIO-PESTICIDE FOR COCKROACHES.
Rithika Sangameshwaran, Divya Kothari, 
Modern English School, Mumbai, Maharashtra, INDIA

This study was conducted to evaluate pesticidal properties of Solanum nigrum and Psidium guajava extracts. These plants, native to India, have been used for treating various diseases in the traditional Indian medical system (Ayurveda). The extracts of leaf, root and fruit pulp were made using water and ethanol. Various concentrations and combination of these extracts as well as appropriate positive and negative controls were used on two cockroach species Periplaneta Americana (L.), and Blattella germanica (L.) under laboratory conditions and their responses were studied.<br><br>The ethanol and water extracts exhibited mortality against cockroaches. Furthermore, the interactions among types of extract, time and concentration showed a significant effect wherein the mortality varied or changed at different exposure periods. <br><br>The combination of leaf extract derived from Solanum Nigrum and Psidium Guajava showed the best mean mortality over naphthalene and a commonly used commercially available pesticide “mortien”. The crude leaf extract of Solanum Nigrum exhibited mortality rate of 80% against Periplaneta Americana and Blattella germanica, solvent extract exhibited mortality rate of 100 % against the same species. Experiments conducted on other pests (centipedes) showed a mean mortality of 85%. Solanum Nigrum leaf extract gave 94% result then the fruit and root. Ethanol extract was found to be more promising than water extract. The lowest concentration that incurred mortality was found to be 3%. All data was statistically analyzed.<br><br>The results showed that the Solanum nigrum and Psidium guajava extracts have pesticidal properties and can be promising botanical pesticides for cockroaches. Our study thus helps develop a natural alternative to the expensive and current environmentally-detrimental commercial pesticides.

" VALUE-ADDED PRODUCTS FROM WHEY"
Maria de Lourdes Segura Avila, Felix Francisco Nieto Damian, 
Centro de Bachillerato Tecnologico Industrial y de Servicion No. 172, Cortazar, Guanajuato, MEXICO

In 2007 10,183,000,000 liters of milk were produced in Mexico, Guanajuato was ranked the sixth place with a production of 730 millions of liters. Considering the ecological problem that is caused by whey in the agro-industrial effluents with the consecutive pollution in the environment, this project is proposed to help the regional cheese maker industry.<br><br> To consolidate our objective, we will elaborate products with an added value to the whey: lactulose by lactose isomerization with pulverized egg shell as a calcium catalyzer, biodegradable coating and film (Hernandez 2006) with antimicrobial and antioxidant properties from marjoram alcoholic extract, spreadable paste and a beverage both enriched with soy protein5.<br><br> The obtained results were lactulose with an output of 1.07gr/100ml, a biodegradable coating and film with antimicrobial and antioxidant properties from marjoram alcoholic extract at 8%. Both the coating and the film were applied to serrano pepper and zucchini with weight change, maturity, physical damage, and fungus infections. A spreadable paste with cinnamon-coffee and cinnamon-guava flavors and a beverage with chocolate and coffee flavors, enriched with soy protein. They had a good consumer acceptance by a sensorial evaluation with commercial products but with a low fabrication cost, greater protein content besides the added value that it is being used a residual that pollutes our environment. This will contribute to the development of a viable industrial process with a greater ecological awareness.

To solve a number of problems (such as high cost, short lifetime usage and fragility) currently associated with the use of real or artificial leathers in Thai industries, we have planned to inexpensively develop artificial leathers from cellulose produced by Acetobactor xylinum, using wastes from pineapple and rambutan as main culture materials. In this project, we proposed to conduct six related experiments; 1) Finding an optimal formula of culture media and optimal time for media sterilization; 2) Finding optimum time for biological production of cellulose from A. xylinum; 3) Finding the optimum method and time for drying the cellulose parchments and to study characteristics of dry cellulose parchments (thickness of the dry parchments and the resistant strength); 4) Evaluation of the quality (such as tensile strength and water absorption) of the cellulose parchments cross-linked with rambutan husk extracts compared with that of the uncross-linked parchments; 5) Comparison of tensile strengths and price of the cellulose-based artificial leathers with the commercialized leathers; and 6) Production of shadow puppets, hats, handbags, and other products from the dried, cross-linked cellulose. The results showed that the suitable liquid culture was the mixture of 500 ml. of pineapple husks extract and 500 ml. of coconut juices with 1.5 ml. of acetic acid, 5 g of ammonium sulfate and 25 g of table sugar. The culture medium needed to be boiled for at least 30 minutes for sterilization. The cellulose gels of usuable sizes were produced in 7 days of culture. The gel parchments needed to be heated at 80°C for 30 hours and were tanned naturally using rambutan husks extract to increase their mechanical strength. Their average tensile modulus was at 32.03 MPa, approximately 14% lesser while cost 70% less than that of the guanine leather. Results from these experiments will be useful to local shadow puppets manufacturers and other leather users. In addition to their environmentally friendly property, this cellulose-based leather can potentially be further developed into various kinds of leather-substitute products such as souvenir bags and hats.

BIOREMEDIATION: MAXIMIZING EFFICIENCY
Anisha Unmesh Gundewar, Rebecca Baur, 
Marlborough High School, Marlborough, MA

Bioremediation is a process in which microorganisms are used to digest harmful hydrocarbons after an oil spill. The purpose of this project was to determine which conditions of pH, temperature, and nutrient concentration within a freshwater environment are most conducive to this process. <br><br> It was hypothesized that refined motor oil would be degraded to a greater extent in a freshwater environment with a neutral pH of 7, temperature of 30⁰C, and moderately increased nutrient concentration.<br><br>Tests were conducted using a visible range spectrophotometer to measure change in percent transparency of solutions containing 1.5mL of carbon deficient media altered to reflect each variable being tested, 0.5mL of acinetobacter calcoaceticus RAG-1 nutrient-bacterial solution, and 30μL of refined motor oil. An increase in transparency of each solution indicated an increase in the amount of oil degraded by RAG-1 bacteria. <br><br> The percent transparency data was collected for three days. Analysis revealed that at an acidic pH of 6 the average transparency was 73.52%, which was higher than the average percent transparencies of neutral or basic pH level trials. When evaluating conditions of temperature, the 50⁰C trials had an average transparency of 92.89%, which was higher than that of the 5⁰C or 30⁰C experimental groups. The control group, with no added nutrients, obtained a higher average percent transparency than the moderately increased nutrient concentration trials. <br><br> Statistical analysis confirms the conclusion that a freshwater environment with a pH of 6 and temperature of 50⁰C, with no added nutrients is most conducive to the process of bioremediation.

MARSH MADNESS: A 3RD YEAR STUDY
Reid William D'Amico, Patrick Connor Andrews, 
Hilton Head Preparatory, Hilton Head Island, SC

This is a third year continuation of an experiment to determine the overall effect on a marsh created by human interaction. This experiment has been broken down into two segments including the design and testing of new dock poles to reduce erosion and a primary productivity test comparing the marsh regions of shade to non-shade.<br><br>To test the new dock pole structures, a scaled down ecosystem was created, including dock poles and accurate marsh mud arrangements. Several new dock pole designs were made as the goal of each was to create a more streamlined path for the water. Erosion was monitored throughout a virtual tide cycle. The self-designed elongated dock pole produced 1500% less erosion than the standard dock pole in the testing. This model could be easily mass-produced and distributed to dock manufacturers.<br><br>A primary productivity test, to measure the amount of carbon in the stalks, was done using a method in which the mass of different stalks were recorded and then plugged into an accumulation of carbon formula. This data was collected over a ten-week period at a moderately “healthy” marsh level as determined by previous research, including grass growth and water quality factors. This method compared the amount of net energy in the shaded region to the net energy in the non-shaded region. This yielded data leading to 1833 gC/m²/y of energy lost due to receiving 45% less sunlight in the shaded region compared to the non-shade region.

FISHING FOR ANSWERS: THE CORRELATION BETWEEN FISH POPULATIONS AND THE HEALTH AND QUALITY OF CORAL REEFS FOUND ON MAUI.
Terah Tsuyako Summers, Serena Dolores San Nicolas Perry, 
Henry Perrine Baldwin High School, Wailuku, HI

Our project investigates the impact of fish on coral reefs in Maui. We hypothesized that a greater presence of fish correlates to a healthier coral reef. To test our hypothesis, we performed multiple line transects to record the fish population at two coral reefs that are in an area with fishing restrictions. The same amount of line transecting was conducted at two other coral reefs that were in areas with unrestricted fishing. <br><br> Line transecting, is a methodical and consistent procedure to quantify the fish population within a designated area. To conduct our line transects, we snorkeled along a measured line over four selected coral reefs while tallying the number and types of fish sighted within a five meter belt transect. <br><br> According to our line transect data, the coral reefs at the Marine Life Conservation District and Natural Area Reserve had a greater fish population, and reefs that were more vibrant in color and structure. Therefore, we concluded that our data supports our hypothesis that a thriving population of fish is vital to the health of coral reefs found on Maui.

RESEARCHING A RELEVANT REMEDY TO REPAIR RIPARIAN RESIDENCES: EXPLORING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CERATOPHYLLUM DEMERSUM AND LEMNA VALDIVIANA IN ABSORBING NITRATES FROM FRESHWATER SOURCES
Nicole Elizabeth Smith
Saginaw Arts & Sciences Academy, Saginaw, MI

Purpose: To determine if Ceratophyllum demersum and Lemna valdiviana are capable of absorbing quantities of nitrate from freshwater sources<br><br>Hypothesis: Ceratophyllum demersum and Lemna valdiviana will absorb quantifiable amounts of nitrate; Ceratophyllum demersum will absorb a greater quantity of nitrate than Lemna valdiviana. The plants will absorb an increasing amount of nitrate consistent with the increased concentration of nitrate until the concentration absorbed resembles a logistic curve. <br><br>Procedure: Pour 2 L of Artificial Lake Water (ALW) into empty distilled water jugs. Enrich the ALW with nitrate so that seven jugs have a concentration 17.6 PPM; 8.8 PPM; 4.4 PPM; 2.2 PPM. Place 6 grams of Ceratophyllum demersum into three jugs of ALW with nitrate concentrations of 17.6 PPM; 8.8 PPM; 4.4 PPM; 2.2 PPM; 0.0 PPM. Place 6 grams of Lemna valdiviana into three jugs of ALW with nitrate concentrations of 17.6 PPM; 8.8 PPM; 4.4 PPM; 2.2 PPM; 0.0 PPM. Leave one jug of ALW with a nitrate concentration of 17.6 PPM; 8.8 PPM; 4.4 PPM; 2.2 PPM; 0.0 PPM. Test each jug of ALW for nitrate concentration every day for 14 days.<br><br> <br><br>Conclusion: Ceratophyllum demersum and Lemna valdiviana absorbed quantifiable amounts of nitrate. Ceratophyllum demersum absorbed nitrate more quickly than Lemna valdiviana, but Lemna valdiviana progressively absorbed nitrate while Ceratophyllum demersum absorbed nitrate only after immediate immersion in ALW.

CREATING A SOLAR POWERED UV WATER FILTRATION DEVICE
Bobby D. Lee
Sunnydale High School, Charlotte, NC

According to the World Health Organization “A lack of water to meet daily needs is a reality today for one in three people around the world”. In many places the problem is not the lack of water, but the lack of clean, drinkable water.<br><br>The purpose of this project was to decrease biological agents in turbid river water using a low cost instrument. I constructed a low cost filter in two sections. The vertical sand filter was made from a PVC tube filled with sand, gravel and activated carbon, and used as a pre-filter to remove some of the biological agents as well as clarify the water. This was attached to the second horizontal tube that housed a UV germicidal light powered by 4 AA batteries and charged by a solar panel.<br><br>Water was taken on five occasions from McMullen Creek and run through the filter. Samples were taken as raw water, water run through the sand filter only, and water run through both the sand and UV filter. These samples were inoculated onto nutrient agar in sterile Petri dishes and observed and incubated for 5 days. The bacteria colonies were then traced onto tracing paper, scanned into a computer and stored as black and white .jpg images. These images were then run through an IMAGE J program that compared the black areas of the traced paper by counting all the black pixels on each of the traced paper. This gave me a way to quantify my results.<br><br>The amount of bacteria was reduced in all 5 tests. Some colors and shapes of bacteria colonies were observed to be completely eliminated.<br><br>In undeveloped countries, this portable water filter could be used as a method of supplying clean, drinkable water.

GOT IRON? NZVI: AN IMPROVMENT IN OCEAN FERTILIZATION
Jingxian Zhang
Westview High School, Portland, OR

Ocean iron fertilization methods currently employ liquid iron, which only provides a short time of fertilization upon dispersal. This project is designed to test nano-sized zero valence iron as a more efficient agent for fertilization by measuring Fe2+ concentrations over time in comparison to that of liquid iron.<br><br> Fe2+ concentration was measured using a spectrophotometer and the chelating reagent, Ferrozine. Calibration curves plotted absorbance against known Fe2+ concentrations; these were later used to determine unknown sample concentrations. nZVI and liquid iron were injected into simulated seawater conditions. The concentrations of each solution were measured over 4 days using the Ferrozine method.<br><br> nZVI’s dissolution curve showed a trend of logarithmic growth that asymptotes at its maximum Fe2+ concentration at hour 4; this trend continues throughout the time tested, deviating little from nZVI’s peak concentration. Liquid iron’s dissolution curve shows a trend of sharp decay throughout 4 days. It reaches maximum Fe2+ concentration instantaneously upon dissolution, after which the amount of Fe2+ is quickly oxidized to Fe3+.<br><br> The hypothesis is proven correct; nZVI is more sustainable because it maintains its Fe2+ concentrations at a near constant level over a long time frame, releasing more bioavailable iron for phytoplankton use (once Fe2+ is oxidized to Fe3+, it is no longer useful). An additional contribution was that the calibration experiments defined Ferrozine’s detection range (0.5 uM-50uM) in which the method can be used with maximum accuracy.

THE DOWN-LOW ON DO: AN ANALYSIS OF THE MEASURE OF DISSOLVED OXYGEN IN MINING PIT QUARRIES' HYPOLIMNION AND THEIR ABILITY TO SUSTAIN AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS
Hannah Renee Perkins
South Sumter High School, Bushnell, FL

Unlike natural lakes, mining pit quarries vary greatly in terms of depth, some reaching 30.5m. This greatly affects the water system's overall health, particularly its dissolved oxygen (DO). In order to determine mining lakes' health and whether or not they can be utilized to their full extent, this project focused on the mining lakes' DO content, paying close attention to the lower hypolimnion layers of the water. I hypothesized that there would not be enough DO available (at least 5mg/L) at such extreme depths to comfortably sustain their aquatic ecosystem, due to the lack of access to photosynthesis and aeration commonly found near the surface. I visited the CEMEX mining facility in Center Hill, Florida, each week for eight weeks in order to test their South Pit Quarry (Lake Unity). After locating the deepest part of the lake in a field research boat, I would lower a dissolved oxygen meter's 30.5m probe into the lake, and then record the DO rating and temperature in °C at its maximum depth of 30.5m, gradually bringing the probe up 3m after each measurement until reaching the surface. After averaging the eight trials together, I concluded that quarry depths greater than 21.3m proved to be insufficient in DO, whereas depths less than 21.3m proved to provide a comfortable habitat for its local aquatic life. Further testing was conducted on the surrounding mining wells to confirm the low DO levels in the quarry's hypolimnion, resulting in similar low readings. Ultimately, my hypothesis was supported.

IMPROVING MINE RECLAMATION OUTCOMES WITH SOIL AMENDMENT VARIATIONS
Travis Cole Sylvester
Greybull High School, Greybull, WY

Mining of bentonitic clays from lands of the northwest Wyoming deserts began in the 1940s and thousands of acres of land have been disturbed prior to reclamation requirements implemented in the 1970s by the Department of Environmental Quality. Chemical and physical attributes of bentonitic spoils and soils coupled with the arid climate of the region make re-vegetating the disturbed land hard and sometimes almost impossible.<br><br>Sample preparation involved mixing 345 cm3 soil or spoil with 120 cm3 of soil additive. Mixtures were placed into pots, where 1.38 grams of zeba was added. After this, ten seeds were added. Four samples of each type of soil with each soil additive and with ten of the varied type of seeds were prepared. The pots were placed into a growing chamber that alternated between light and dark every twelve hours.<br><br>Results have shown that added water helps stimulate growth and seed germination and that many soil additives can accomplish similar outcomes. Although Alkali Sacaton with spring water did not readily grow, horse manure grew at the same rate as the control. The Alkali Sacaton with the supplemented watering protocol showed growth that was affected by Western Sugar top soil. The Basin Wild Rye was a lot more productive. In the watering rate equivalent to a typical spring month, sawdust was the most productive in stimulating growth. This was followed by horse manure. The supplemented watering rate Basin Wild Rye was most significantly impacted by the Western Sugar ooze pile. Slender Wheat grass was another very active grass. In the spring watering protocol Western Sugar topsoil produced the greatest amount of growth.<br><br>There are a number of conclusions that can be established. These include the use of soil additives to help control soil pH levels, that watering rates are an important aspect in grass growth and that when water requirements are met soil conditions come into a much larger role. It has also proven that in most situations plants grew much better in the soil or spoil with soil additives.

THE FEASIBILITY OF REINFORCING THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER EMBANKMENTS WITH BORROW HARVESTED VIA FLOCCULATION
Alaina Brooke Leggette
Saint Joseph's Academy, Baton Rouge, LA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the feasibility of harvesting borrow from the Mississippi River in order to produce a supplement for reinforcing and revegetating the soft-soiled levee systems in the Plaquemines Parish. The extracted sediment was analyzed for the parameters of Chlorides, conductivity, salts, Sodium, pH, and SAR and produced results which indicated that all of the parameters were within range to use the sediment as functional borrow. Water quality analyses for solids and nutrient loads were observed for the pre and post flocculated water, and generated results exhibiting that the presence of solids and nutrients decreased after the water had been flocculated, indicating cleaner water. An original mathematical model was created stating that when x=cubic yards of borrow and y=gallons of Mississippi River water the equation Y=758095.2381X/1.266 {X and Y elements of R^+) calculates the gallons of water required to produce the needed amount of borrow to reinforce the levee systems. This project presents a proposed method for obtaining the needed borrow to repair the Plaquemine’s Parish levee systems by flocculating the Mississippi River water, using the extracted sediment as borrow to reinforce and revegetate the levees, and providing possible uses for the post-flocculated water such using it for agricultural irrigation, drinking water, or recycling it back into the river reducing its contribution to the Dead Zone in the Gulf of Mexico. The Mississippi River essentially has all of the ingredients to provide a long term source of borrow needed to rebuild its own levee systems.

THE EFFECTS OF VARYING DEPTHS OF WATER ON THE GERMINATION RATE OF CAREX HYSTERICINA IN ITS NATURAL HABITAT
Tiffany Colleen Tischer
Lincoln High School, Thief River Falls, MN

The purpose of this experiment is to see the depth of water necessary for Carex hystericina to grow in its natural habitat. The hypothesis is if Carex hystericina are planted at the high, mid and normal water line, and in 2, 4, and 10 cms of water then the seeds planted at the normal water line, 2cm and 4 cm of water will have the best germination rate. Bags of seeds were planted at all 6 depths in seven wetlands. Seeds were left over winter to complete the scarification process. Site 1, 3, 6, and 7 germination rate all occurred at the normal water line, 2 and 4 cm of water. Site 5 germination rates are 89% at the mid water line, 72% at the normal water line, 63% at the 2cm, and 51% at 4cm. Site 4 had the best germination rate of 79% in 2 cm of water and 42% in 4cm. Site 2 the best germination rate was 78% at the mid water line. <br><br>Carex hystericina is beneficial because it helps keep food webs in balance, filter toxins, and pollutants out of water. By having a healthy wetland it also helps control flooding by holding water so it does not enter the river systems. These plants help to control erosion when they become mature. Roots help to keep the soil in place, which prevents wetland dredging. Dredging costs $4,500 to $5,500 per day. Keeping Carex hystericina in wetlands saves federal tax dollars.

THE ALGAE-MOBILE 2: CREATING AN ENERGY SUFFICIENT ANTI-POLLUTANT DEVICE IN THE EXHAUST OF A CAR
Param Jaggi
Plano East Senior High School, Plano, TX

The world today faces various problems of global warming and pollution that has brought disparity to societies across the world. In the Algae-Mobile 2, an energy sufficient anti-pollutant device based upon algae was made and tested to fit into the exhaust of a car. <br><br>These devices were able to reduce vehicle emissions through the photosynthetic rate of Chlorella Algae and engineering designs to optimize the reduction of carbon dioxide. <br><br>After testing the algae for viscosity and pH, the devices were designed and created. The original device with a gas permeable tube was tested and refined along with a design that would work as a baffle. Each device was tested for oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations in addition to a cost benefit analysis from original qualitative/quantitative data equations. Each device was tested with a metal aluminum alloy composition and a metal fiber insulator to maintain a medial temperature and environment for the algae within the device.<br><br>These devices on average showed an 88% decrease in carbon dioxide. The original design (design 1) decreased carbon dioxide amounts by 75% and increased oxygen by 38% of the original oxygen concentration. The Baffle design had the most optimal data by decreasing the carbon dioxide levels by 92%. These devices and the project as a whole could be used to decrease overall global pollution concerns.

HEAVY METAL BIOREMEDIATION: RELIEF FOR A RAVAGED LAND
Paige Hunter Parrack
Southmoore High School, Moore, OK

This project was designed with two intentions in mind: studying microorganisms and the effects of heavy metals. The main idea was to find what relationships between the soil’s heavy metal level and the microorganisms living in it would be the most effective in two types of bioremediation: phytoremediation and biostimulation. Bioremediation could be an environmental friendly way to decrease the metal quantities within contaminated earth. Soil samples were digested to study the metal concentrations of lead and zinc; this soil is from Tar Creek, a superfund site in Northern Oklahoma, and was evacuated due to the high contamination levels. The second part of the study was to determine which type of plant has the greatest uptake of heavy metals and how microorganisms affect that uptake. This project was successful because pumpkin was shown to have the greatest uptake of zinc and lead from the soil. The soil was digested at original levels, six weeks, and ten weeks; the rhizosphere and plant matter was separated and also tested.

CARBON BIO CAPTURE: SOLVING THE CO2 DILEMMA
Bryan Austin Johnson
Southmoore High School, Oklahoma City, OK

This project will show how photosynthetic organisms can utilize carbon dioxide emissions into beneficial oxygen. The organisms will be tested on their intake of carbon dioxide and output of oxygen. Soil water medium will be made and poured in the containers with the organisms, and will be grown for two weeks. Testing will consist of using a modified biochamber 2000 with the carbon dioxide reaction flowing into the apparatus for 96 hours taking a sample every ten minutes on a Vernier labquest. After the testing is done and the results interpreted, the most productive organisms will be further examined and put through phase 2, which will consist of designing and building an attachment that contains the organism and that could be placed on any carbon dioxide output source such as a vehicle or factory. The organisms that produced the best results with increased atmospheric oxygen and dissolved oxygen but had a lower level of carbon dioxide was Microastrious, and Volvox Globator. These two algal organisms will be further examined and put through phase 2. Phase 2 consist of designing and testing my chosen organisms in the Bio-Carbonator, an engineering device designed to attach to a car exhaust.

LEACHING LEAD, PHASE TWO
James Andrew Rose
Alpena High School, Alpena, AR

The purpose of the project was twofold. First, to determine if CRT monitors buried in landfills or in surface water environments could leach lead, copper, and iron into the ground and surface waters. and second, to analzye the effects tha the levels of lead, copper, and iron in the surface water would have on living organisms by creating daphnia habitats.<br><br> Two model landfills were constructed using 1140 liter plastic tubs filled with top soil and contained monitor wells for water extraction. The control landfill was filled with soil and contained monitor wells. The experimental landfill also contained twelve CRT monitors. The surface water environments utilized 380 liter plastic tubs filled with water. The experimental environment contained five CRT monitors with cracked screens. After several months, the ground and surface water was tested using a colorimeter. Ten control and ten experimental daphnia habitats were prepared to evaluate lifespan. The data was analyzed using t-Test paried two sample for means.<br><br> Surface water tests overall averages: Control Environment; 0.143ppm lead, 0.076ppm copper, 0.297 iron, Epxerimental environemtn; 1.21ppm lead, 4.97ppm copper, 82.3ppm iron. Ground water test overall averages: Control tub; 0.046ppm lead, 0.192ppm copper, 1.64ppm iron, Epxerimental tub; 0.421ppm lead, 1.00ppm copper, 52.9ppm iron. Daphnia life spna for surface water: control habitat 5.03days, experimetnal habitat 1.45days.<br><br> The t-Tests identified significantly larger amounts of lead, copper, and iron with a p<0.05 in the experimental tub and in the experiemtnal environment, and the daphnia in the control habitats had a significantly longer average lifespan.

LIVING ROOFS
Frances Wisdom Atkins
Carmel High School, Carmel, CA

One important factor that leads to the degradation of our environment can be traced to building construction and operation. We are responsible for engineering improved building designs, which can help compensate for compromised environmental stewardship. A “living roof” that uses healthy, live vegetation is a technological advance utilized in building designs. This project tested how a living roof affects the amplitude and rate of temperature change inside a classroom model by studying the effects of heat transfer interacting with the characteristics of a living roof. Based on research, I predicted that temperatures would increase at a higher rate in a classroom model with a conventional roof compared to a classroom model using a living roof design. By taking the average temperature of five trials for both the living roof and the conventional roof, the results affirmed my hypothesis to be partially correct. The rate of temperature change in the living roof model was significantly less, actually decreasing the temperature by 1.13 °F versus an increase of 6.66°F for the conventional model. This experiment suggests that the living roof absorbed energy from a heat lamp rather than re-radiating it into the building below. The decrease in temperature may be a result of evaporation from moisture within the living roof biomass. A smaller amplitude and lesser rate of temperature change means that a fraction of energy normally used by mechanical systems would be required to cool the building using a living roof design.

THE IMPLICATIONS OF CHRYSANTHEMUM BLOSSOM EXTRACT ON AN INVERTEBRATE FOOD CHAIN, PHASE THREE
Jack Alexander Fruth
Northwestern High School, Kokomo, IN

The purpose of this project is to determine whether chrysanthemum blossom extract will kill any carnivores in the food chain. The hypothesis is that if chrysanthemum blossom extract is applied as a pesticide, then it will kill the majority of the mealworms but none of the Daphnia, dragonfly larvae, or wolf spiders. One hundred grams of chrysanthemum blossoms were boiled in 1 liter of water for 30 minutes, keeping the amount of water steady. Then spring water was added to create 25%, 50%, and 75% stock solutions. The solution was tested on Daphnia magna at 1%, 5%, 10%, and 20%. When some of the Daphnia and all of the mealworms survived, they were fed to the dragonfly nymphs and the wolf spiders. Both carnivores were tested on survival rate. The mealworms were fed to the spiders at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. After seven days of feeding a mealworm to a spider daily, there was a 100% carnivore survival rate. When the Daphnia from 1% and 5% levels were fed for 7 days to the dragonflies, there also was a 100% survival rate. The 5% data were extremely important because while 50% of the Daphnia died, the dragonflies survived. This result indicated that the active insecticidal chemical (pyrethrin) does not move up the food chain. The hypothesis was partially supported because all the carnivores survived but the prey did not follow the hypothesis because some of the Daphnia died and the mealworms lived.

NITRATE REDUCTION IN SIMULATED NITRATE WASTEWATER BY BIOBARRIER FILTRATION
Monica Elizabeth McFadden
Notre Dame Academy, Park Hills, KY

The purpose of this study is to determine if biofilms can be grown on glass bead or sand substrates to create active biobarriers that will remove nitrate and improve water quality. If there is a greater total surface area on the smaller and rougher particles, then nitrate levels will be reduced the most with these particles. A biofilm was created from a BSL-1 microorganism, Pseudomonas fluorescens, grown in a column filled with glass beads or sand. Simulated nitrate-containing wastewater was poured through the column with the beads or sand acting as a filter. Measurements of drainage time and nitrate level in the filtrate were made. Student t-tests were conducted to compare averages.<br><br>Average drainage times were generally higher for the smallest particles after the incorporation of Pseudomonas fluorescens and the resulting biofilm. When wastewater remained in contact with the biofilm-covered beads for six days, the nitrate levels in the filtrate were significantly lower than in the control. For the 0.6-0.8 mm beads, nitrate was reduced to 17.3 mg/L; to 12.0 mg/L for the 1.4-1.6 mm; and to 20.0 mg/L for the 4 mm. In the experiment using sand grains, nitrate was reduced to 14.9 mg/L using the 100-400 micrometer grains; to 14.8 mg/L using the 600-900 micrometer grains; and to 14.6 mg/L using the 1100-1400 micrometer grains.

The purpose of this research project was to see if Dreissena polymorpha, known as Zebra Mussels, could potentially reduce the amount of microcystin in Lake St. Marys. Lake St. Marys is a manmade lake dug by hand as a reservoir for the Miami & Erie Canal. Microcystin is a toxin produced by Planktothrix Bacteria. The microcystin levels in the lake have been consistently over the CDC limit of 20 ppb. For that reason the lake has been literally closed for recreational activities. Zebra Mussels are filter feeders, so it was hypothesized that they could feed on the Planktothrix reducing the toxin.<br><br>To prepare for this project, permissions were obtained from the State Park Manager at Lake St. Marys, as well as the Ohio EPA and the ODNR Marina in Cleveland, Ohio.The Zebra Mussels were taken from the dock area in Cleveland on July 13.<br><br>Tanks were set up numbered 1-6. Tank 1 contained Lake Erie water and Mussels. Tank 2 was Lake St. Marys water from the dock area by the marina. Tanks 3-4-5-6 contained the St. Marys water and Zebra Mussels. Water testing was done to compare the qualities of both water samples. Tests were for D.O., phosphate, turbidity and pH.

THE IMPACT OF TEMPERATURE AND FOOD AVAILABILITY ON THE VIABILITY OF THE EARLY DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES OF THE MARINE COPEPOD, ACARTIA TONSA
Young-Ah Lee
New Horizons Governor's School for Science and Technology, Hampton, VA

The effect of food availability and temperature on the early development and viability of the copepod Acartia tonsa was observed. The viability data illustrated the change in number of surviving copepods over certain period of time. The developmental data showed how the Acartia went through the life stages relative to time. For the food availability experiment, naupliar stages of the copepod were observed under three treatments: abundant food, fluctuating food(alternating, two days of food and two days of starvation) and no food. For the temperature experiment, two sets of nauplii were observed under three different temperatures: 10C, 20C, and 30C. The first set of temperature experiment received no food, and the second set received abundant food. <br><br>For the food experiment, the nauplii with no food survived the shortest and reached the least advanced developmental stage, and the nauplii with abundant food survived the longest and reached the most advanced developmental stage. For the temperature experiment without food, the nauplii in the 10C survived the longest and the nauplii in the 30C survived the shortest. For the temperature experiment with food, the nauplii in the 30C survived the longest and the nauplii in the 10C survived the shortest. For both temperature experiments, the nauplii in the 30C reached the most advanced developmental stage and the nauplii in the 10C reached the least advanced developmental stage.<br><br>The results would help augment the knowledge of population ecology of copepods and of how changes in environment affect the diversity of life, distribution of species, and energy flow.

ELECTROCHEMICAL REMEDIATION OF ACID MINE DRAINAGE
Luke Steven Andraka
North County High School, Glen Burnie, MD

This project studied the possibility of mitigating the adverse environmental effects of acid mine drainage (AMD) by using electrochemical treatment to raise the pH , harvest dissolved metals and produce hydrogen as an energy source. AMD is runoff from abandoned mines. It is very acidic due to the high concentration of hydrogen ions. It was hypothesized that by using electrolysis the free hydrogen ions could be removed from the AMD and collected as hydrogen gas to be used as an energy source while reducing the acidity. Raising the pH would also precipitate metals out of solution, removing them from being an environmental pollutant. Using a two-chamber electrolysis cell with a removable ion exchange membrane, tests were performed to compare the change in pH and conductivity when the AMD was placed in the anode, the cathode, or both cell chambers. Hydrogen gas production was also measured.<br><br>Placement of the AMD in the anode or both chambers produced minimal change in pH. However, when the AMD was placed in the cathode the pH rose from 2.0 to above 11.0 in less than one hour. As the pH rose, metals precipitated out of solution and settled on the bottom of the cathode chamber while hydrogen gas was produced.<br><br>This project demonstrates that this technique can raise pH, precipitate dissolved metals and produce hydrogen while mitigating the effects of acid mine drainage which is a serious environmental problem around the world.

USING THERMAL INFRA-RED SATELLITE IMAGERY TO MEASURE WATER SURFACE TEMPERATURES IN LARGE RIVERS
Vicki Lam
Benson Polytechnic High School, Portland, OR

Thermal infra-red satellite imagery, a form of remote sensing, is used to discern the temperature of cooling water plumes from nuclear power plants to see whether it affects global warming. The same technique is used to find out the surface water temperature of ocean waters where there are large areas to survey. LANDSAT TM and ETM satellite images have pixel sizes that cover 60 meter squares of the surveyed surface. Because the pixel size is so big, remote sensing is only done on areas that have a large surface area. Large rivers such as the Columbia River in southeast Washington State can be used to test out the possibility of using such technique. It will eliminate the need for hiring someone to go out to the field to obtain data of surface water temperatures if remote sensing is possible. It can expedite data collection for monitoring river water temperatures and for observing the mixing of the cold and warm water. ENVI, software for processing and analyzing geospatial imagery, is used in conjunction with free USGS satellite images to test whether rivers have enough pixels to find out the surface water temperature and match it to free field data. The thermal IR satellite image pixels are adequate for measuring water surface temperatures in large rivers such as the Columbia River. Field temperature data collected in the forebay of McNary Dam on the Columbia River were compared with derived temperature from the thermal infra-red satellite imagery. Basic statistical analysis were performed to quantify the agreement between the field data and the satellite data.

ENGINEERING A RAIN GARDEN TO CONTROL ROAD RUN-OFF IN SCANLON CREEK AND AN ASSESSMENT OF RAIN GARDENS AS THE BEST STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PRACTICE, PHASE IV
Logan Joseph Pallin
Cloquet Senior High School, Cloquet, MN

The objectives were: to re-engineer a new rain garden that can treat a 25 year rain event, determine the effect a rain garden has had on the health of a trout stream, macroinvertebrate predator/prey interactions over four years, if modified Hester-dende samplers can predict the effects of construction generated road run-off on macroinvertebrate populations, and if rain gardens are the best storm water treatment process. Water quality sampling was done from a 10 meter reach before and after a rain garden construction site over a four year period. Modified Hester-dende samplers were again used to simulate an embedded and non-embedded stream situation (allowing/limiting predation). Infiltrometer readings were compared to other local rain gardens. As an expansion of last year’s study a new rain garden design was engineered and implemented. When the road run-off treated section of the stream was compared to upstream—during phase one and two of this study—the rain garden had a positive effect on temperature, discharge, pH, conductivity, Family Biotic Index (FBI), macroinvertebrate density, and diversity of food processing groups. During phase three the rain garden’s positive effect diminished for some variables: oxygen, temperature, discharge, conductivity, pH, and clarity. After rain garden maintenance during phase four, oxygen, and temperature levels improved. Scanlon Creek’s rain garden infiltration rates were significantly lower than all rain gardens in the area for the past two years, positively affecting FBI and diversity. The re-engineered rain garden size was increased by 107 square feet to accommodate a twenty five year rain event.

PHOTOBIOREACTOR FOR CARBON SEQUESTRATION
Victor Marelli Thut
Colegio Dante Alighieri, Sao Paulo, SP, BRASIL

The problem of global warming is directly related to the increasing of the greenhouse gases concentration in the atmosphere, among them carbon dioxide (CO2). As the photosynthetic microorganisms have higher growth and photosynthetic rates than the plants, they are an interesting object of study for the carbon sequestration. My project aims to test the hypothesis that photosynthetic microorganisms grown in a closed photobioreactor with domestic usage are able to neutralize the carbon emissions from a specific group of people. In vitro growth of different fresh water Cyanobacteria strains was evaluated under controlled conditions, in triplicates. Carbon sequestration was evaluated in the beginning of the stationary phase, when the samples were transferred to a lyophilizer, after which their dry biomass were measured. The samples were afterwards burned in a muffle (500 °C) and weighed again to obtain the mass of the ashes. The difference between the dry biomass and the mass of the ashes was considered as carbon sequestration estimation. The data were submitted to a statistic analysis of variance (ANOVA) to check the differences between the tested strains and help choosing which of them would be more appropriate for a domestic photobioreactor. Then the photobioreactor was designed. This machine is projected to neutralize carbon emission of the users by growing the microorganisms under a controlled and independent way, it means, the user interferes minimally on its working. The calculations of the users carbon emission will be performed on line by a software available on a web site, which the equipment will be indirectly linked. The website will not work only as a carbon calculator and a support tool for the users but also as an important way to make the whole work known.

ANALYSIS OF ABSORPTION/ADSORPTION OF HEAVY METALS IN AQUATIC ENVIRONMENTS WITH THE USE OF PISTIA STRATIOTES
Natalia Giuzio
Colegio Interativa, Londrina, PR, BRASIL

Floating aquatic macrophytes have been successfully used inurban wastewater and aquaculture treatment. My study aims to evaluate the absorption capacity and / or adsorption of heavy metals by Pistia stratiotes. Up to the present, the research consisted of collections during the months of March and August 2009 as required. The plants were kept in a tank with 6 gallons of water and heavy metals (Zinc, Copper, Lead and Cadmium). Samples of 25ml of water were collected weekly in every aquarium, with replicates. The samples were analyzed by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. It can be observed up to now the holding capacity of Zinc, Lead and Copper by the plant, decreasing concentration present initially from 1.8 mg/L to 0.008 mg/L, 0.3 mg/L to 0.11 mg/L and 0.2 mg/L to 0 mg/L respectively. Cadmium was considered for termination of analysis. After the tests, I can conclude that this plant has great ability to absorb / adsorb heavy metals by removing them completely from the water or keeping it within the amounts allowable by the local national regulation.

CONSTRUCTION OF A CONTINUOUS FLOW SODIS SYSTEM WITH PET BOTTLES INTEGRATED TO A WATER AND WASTE-WATER TREATMENT SYSTEM
Karoline Elis Lopes Martins
Centro Federal de Educacao Tecnológica de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, SP, BRASIL

Waterborne diseases are common in many Brazilian regions where basic sanitation, including potable water supply, are lacking. This is especially evident in rural communities, where alternative, often precarious; water and wastewater technologies are the only available solution for sanitation. My main goal was to design and build a Solar Disinfection (SODIS) system with PET bottles connected for continuous flow and water treatment. The SODIS is also connected to other sanitation technologies, including biosand filters, stabilization ponds and wetlands, to provide an integrated water and wastewater solution that could be applied to small rural communities. I tested the hypothesis that a continuous flow SODIS is capable of heating the water to temperatures above 50°C for 2 hours, which is enough to eliminate thermo-sensitive bacteria such as Coliforms and E. Coli. Methods include mathematical simulation of the continuous flow using a time discretized, finite difference approach to propagate the flow from one bottle to the next. The simulated flow was then used to determine the number of bottles necessary to provide the minimum water detention time to allow temperatures reach over 50°C for a period of 2 hours. The solar concentrator's shape was defined based on a composite parabolic curve. The connected bottles were tested for water tightness and performed well. Based on a 6hr/day sun exposure, 144 bottles and 72 solar concentrators were necessary to disinfect 140.69 liters of water. The SODIS tested demonstrated potential for application combined to other sanitation technologies, resulting in a low cost, yet robust solution for sanitation. Further research is required for larger scale field testing.

RHODAMINE DYE RETENTION IN SILICA ISOLATED FROM DIATOMS CYCLOTELLA MENEGHINIANA AND THALASSIOSIRA SP.
Kalia S. Bistolas
Wilsonville High School, Wilsonville, OR

Diatoms, unicellular Bacillariophyceae algae, contain silica cell walls with distinctive optical properties. The specular reflectance of diatomaceous silica and water is identical, rendering cell counting technologies such as spectrophotometry ineffective without modification via staining. Diatom population approximations may assist in assessing the efficiency of marine iron fertilization through the determination of silica content per cell. The objective of this project was to investigate the retention characteristics of rhodamine(Rh) dyes (specifically fluorescent RhWt, Rh123, RhB, Rh6G, and Rh110). It was hypothesized that dyes Rh123 and RhB would stain frustules (cell walls), as both are known to stain artificial silica with similar nanostructures. Diatom species Cyclotella meneghiniana and Thalassiosira sp. were employed to determine if specular reflectance is altered by either encapsulation of dyes within the areole or chemical bonding of dyes to the frustules. Specific objectives were as follows: [1] culture diatoms in preparation for silica isolation; [2] assess a range of dyes for ability to stain diatom silica in vitro; [3] determine whether the dyes could efficiently withstand the acidic silica isolation procedure. Results indicated that dye retention surpassed hypothetical prospects, as three out of five dyes (Rh123, RhB, Rh6G) consistently stained diatom silica. In addition, Rh123 and RhB survived the silica isolation process. The probability that presence of stains is independent of dye is ~3.67624X10-7, less than or equal to .05, strongly supporting dependence between presence and type of dye. Optical modifications to diatom frustules allows for the use of technologies that can determine total cell counts of diatomaceous solutions.

DESIGN, FABRICATION, AND EVALUATION OF A DEPLOYABLE IN SITU NITRATE SENSOR FOR REAL-TIME ANALYSIS OF SEDIMENTS
Avilash Kalpathy Cramer

Nitrate runoff is an important anthropogenic pollution vector, causing eutrophication in rivers and estuaries around the world. Nitrate is also part of the nitrogen cycle in sediment-water systems. Although sensors exist to measure nitrate in water, these sensors cannot measure nitrate in sediment. To that end, a novel sensor that utilized an ion-selective electrode (ISE) capable of measuring a depth profile of nitrate concentrations in sediment with a millimeter resolution was developed. Temporal data on nitrate accumulation in sediment are preserved because the sensor samples at discrete depths and leaves the sediment profile undisturbed.<br><br>The ISE was calibrated using solutions with known concentrations of potassium nitrate. Data from the ISE was non-normal, indicated by the Shapiro-Wilk test. Kruskal-Wallis analysis of potentials yielded p-values below 0.05, indicating the sensor was able to discriminate between concentrations from 10-2 to 10-6 M.<br><br>A waterproof capsule to deploy the ISE and record data from the bottom of a river or estuary was designed, constructed, and tested. The capsule contains the ISE, a pH meter, a temperature probe, a tri-axis accelerometer, an Arduino coputer chip, leak detectors, and a linear actuator that moves the ISE in millimeter-scale intervals. Data are transmitted via a tether to the operator. <br><br>This sensor was then field tested and successfully used to record real-time data on nitrate levels in situ in Columbia River sediments. Development of this technology will improve chemical analysis, tracking of nitrate vectors such as fertilizers and sewage, and understanding of bacteria populations in sediment systems.

MONITORING AMMONIA OXIDIZING BACTERIA USING QUANTITATIVE POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTIONS
Arezu Hajar Monawer
Madison West High School, Madison, WI

In the United States, safe potable water is maintained in distribution systems by the addition of a disinfectant as the water leaves the treatment plant. The most common disinfectant is chlorine, but when the water source has too much organic matter, reactions of chlorine with the natural organic matter produce undesirable cancer-causing byproducts. The United States Environmental Protection Agency regulates how much byproducts can be in the water. As a result, many utilities use chloramine as an alternative disinfectant. Utilities that use chloramine disinfection often suffer from nitrification a two step microbial process of the serial oxidation of ammonia to nitrite by ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB), and nitrite to nitrate by nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB). To control and limit nitrification, utilities must accurately detect precisely when nitrification occurs. Regan et al (2007) have proposed using qPCR to predict nitrification episodes caused by AOB, specifically Nitrosomonas oligotropha. SYBR Green was tested on six different clone isolates of Nm. oligotropha as reported by Park and Noguera (2004), and was evaluated on linearity, correlation coefficients, linear dynamic ranges, and PCR efficiencies. Melt curve analysis was conducted to distinguish the different isolates. SYBR Green was found to be a viable method because it gave a linear response to at least five orders of magnitude, and PCR efficiencies between 99 and 127%. Furthermore, because the melting curves of all clones were clearly defined, with no primer dimers identified, melt curve analysis provides a technique for increased specificity to distinguish the different clone isolates.

SUSTAINABLE USE OF WEST INDIAN NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS FOR RUBBER PRODUCTION
Lorianny Rivera
Colegio Maria Auxiliadora, Carolina, PUERTO RICO

Rubber is a product of great commercial value and extensive use. Since the bulk of its production derives by synthesis from petroleum, the price of synthetic rubber is determined by the ever-rising global price of crude oil. Natural rubber, however, can be obtained from the milky sap (latex) of some plants mostly belonging to four botanical families. The possibility of obtaining natural rubber from West Indian native trees with copious latex is hereby investigated. From the main four rubber-producing families five randomly selected species out of the 34 occurring naturally in Puerto Rico (along with a naturalized exotic crop-tree) were tested for rubber production. Latex was collected and its isoprene content polymerized following acidification and application of heat in a water bath. The presence of polyisoprene (rubber) in samples was demonstrated with the turpentine solubility test. Dry rubber production of the 5 selected species (29-70% of latex, by weight) fall slightly beyond the acceptable economical limits of 25-40%, proving them very suitable for commercial exploitation. Because of this results and the abundance of latex-producing trees in West Indian forests, a project is devised for the sustainable use of these woods for rubber production with minimum impact on natural ecosystems. This ecological approach contrasts with the Asian model of rubber production based on the cultivation of a single, non-native species, requiring destruction of natural habitat.

BUILDINGS CONSTRUCTIONS WITH CONCRETE AND RECYCLED MATERIALS
Desiree Janice Nieves
Colegio Marista, Guaynabo, PUERTO RICO

Heating and cooling buildings represent a large source of CO2 emissions and up to 60% of a building's operating budget. Achieving energy efficiency in new construction would decrease the amount of energy used to acclimate a structure, thus reducing costs and CO2 release. Concrete is a common material used in the construction of buildings. This material has high heat retention. The purpose of this project is to determine if recycled expanded polystyrene and cardboard, when mixed with concrete, will lower the interior temperature of a structure. <br><br>Three structures (21.5 cm W, 24.1 cm L, 19.0 cm H, 2.5 cm D) were constructed. The first structure contained 100% concrete mix (35% graded sand to 65% portland cement), the second structure contained 80% concrete mix and 20% expanded polystyrene, and the third structure contained 80% concrete mix and 20% cardboard. Temperature was measured inside and outside the structures with an infrared digital thermometer gun for a period of 30 days. At the end of this period, the structure made with 80:20 polystyrene had an average internal temperature 2.7 ° C lower than the 100% concrete structure and an average external temperature 7.23° C lower than the 100% concrete structure. The structure made with 80:20 cardboard had an average internal temperature of 1.6 °C less than the 100% concrete structure and an average external temperature of 6.1° C less than the 100% concrete structure. It can be concluded that a polystyrene/concrete mixture would be an effective alternative to reduce internal temperature of buildings.

TOXICITY OF SURROGATE ORGANOCLAY SURFACTANT TO STRAIGHT-CHAIN HYDROCARBON-DEGRADERS AND POTENTIAL FOR ORGANOCLAY BIODEGRADATION
Laurie Ann Rumker
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland, OR

Organoclay, the active layer in sediment caps used to contain pollutants in aqueous sediments, is clay infused with surfactants to create a hydrophobic exterior with the capability to sorb hydrophobic pollutants. Because surfactant biodegradation could release pollutants sorbed to the organoclay back into the water system, this study evaluated the biodegradation of surrogate organoclay surfactants in isolation and in the presence of organoclay by two hydrocarbon-degrading strains, Rhodococcus erythropolis Husky-A and S+14He. It was hypothesized that hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria would consume organoclay surfactants via beta-oxidation of the aliphatic chain or hydrolysis at the ammonium group. The microbes were incubated aerobically in acetate nutrient solutions of varying dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride surfactant concentrations for five days. Turbidity growth tests determined the surfactant toxic at concentrations down to 20micrograms/mL, but non-toxic at and below 20micrograms/mL. However, oxygen uptake tests in carbon-limited growth solutions containing surfactants and organoclay revealed significant biodegradation of surfactants only in the absence of organoclay. Successive studies will investigate biodegradation of other surfactants with other bacteria, as well as the pathway used by the microbes to degrade organoclay surfactants, which will determine the likelihood of organoclay biodegradation at waste containment sites.

FLOOD LEVEES: THE COMPOSITION OF SANDBAGS
Rachel Marie Woodhouse
Roseville College, Sydney, NSW, AUSTRALIA

Flood levees are increasingly important with the predicted increase in rising sea levels and extreme weather. Levees are traditionally composed of sand-filled bags, however it is unclear which type of sand or other material is most effective. This investigation aims to test the effectiveness of different materials in terms of their porosity and permeability to provide data to aid authorities in choosing the best local material. A Flood Simulation System was designed in which sandbags were placed on a flood plain and water was released to run down the plain. Three flow rates were tested. Water that seeped through the sandbags was collected and measured. Initially, it was found that sand and loam were effective materials, while gravel and woodchips were not. Further investigation using the System focused on various sands and soils. A Test Kit was developed to measure the relative porosity and permeability of the materials tested. Using the System/Kit, it was found that all materials with permeability less than 1.1 mL/s (sandy clay, loam, organic soil, all grades of sand) were effective in levees. Of these, sandy clay and organic soil with high porosity were most effective, outperforming sands whose relative porosity tended to decrease with increasing grain size. However, these findings do not align simply with trends of increasing grain size. Thus, although the results suggest that a Test Kit measuring porosity and permeability may assist in choosing materials, they do not conclusively inform as to the effectiveness of flood levee constituents in resisting floodwaters.

PORE SIZE REDUCTION OF ELECTROSPUN POLYACRYLONITRILE (PAN) SCAFFOLDS FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE MICROFILTRATION
Brandon Li
Jericho Senior High School, Jericho, NY

Phase immersion membranes suffer from low porosity and difficulty of production, reducing flux rates and operation efficiency. Electrospinning, a process that creates continuous and uniform nanofibers and microfibers, can overcome these limitations, though large pore sizes have limited its application in microfiltration. This study sought to reduce the pore size of electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) through controlling fiber diameter, tip-to-collector distance, and membrane thickness, all of which aimed to increase the number of fiber crossings. PAN was electrospun directly onto a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate that was mounted on a rotating drum collector. To alter the fiber diameter, various electrospinning conditions (applied voltage, PAN concentration, tip-to-collector distance, LiCl addition) were adjusted. Porometry of the membranes was evaluated by bubble point tests and analysis of scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. Electrospun PAN was compressed under deionized water for 0-4 minutes to further reduce the pore size. Filtration performance of electrospun PAN was determined by pure water flux and rejection percentage of .2 µm carboxylate microspheres and compared to that of commercial Millipore™ Millex-GS microfilters both before and after water compression. Though not optimized, the PAN membranes (after 4 minutes of compression) exhibited significantly higher flux (p = 5.65 x 10-7), rejection (p =1.12 x 10-7), and porosity (p = 2.49 x 10-15) than Millex-GS. A new class of high performance electrospun microfilters, that can be produced continuously and cheaply, was successfully developed. Future studies will involve optimizing membrane conditions, developing an ethanol pre-treatment, and testing filtration of .2 µm bacteria.

THE IMPACT OF SOIL THERMAL DIFFUSIVITY VARIANCE ON GEOTHERMAL HEATING
Peter Nicholas Gardner
Dearborn Center for Mathematics, Science, and Technology, Dearborn Heights, MI

The prices of fossil fuels are running rampant, the adverse effects and damage on and to the global environment are compounding, and a solution is needed. Geothermal heating could be a major step in the right direction, yet it is hobbled by a substantial installation fee and large quantity of requisite space. If the buried piping grid were to be bedded in a thermally diffusive soil, the “hobbles” on this infinite energy source could be removed. And to make this concept into a marketable, viable, variable plan of action, a model has been developed, incorporating the thermal diffusivity of a spectrum of soils with varying percentages of mineral composition, humidity, grain size, and crystal lattice structure and totality. A Dual-Probe-Heat-Pulse utilizing high-resistance wire and a thermocouple has been used to measure soil/mineral thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity, from which the thermal diffusivity can be calculated. This is important for the more thermally diffusive the soil bed, the smaller the system size required, and the greater it’s power and efficiency. These soil bed options will be easily compared to the local soil being replaced and its thermal properties, allowing for simple cost-benefit-analysis up front. The final result of this all is a supercharged, miniaturized, pollution and fossil-fuel free system that will be now available to countless homeowners with either too little room for the previously large systems or whose residences are in an environment not diffusive enough to be feasible, as well as to homeowners unsatisfied with the inefficient systems they are currently saddled with. This newly improved system has an enormous potential environmental impact, and is standing to reduce America’s fossil-fuel consumption by a staggering 50%.

THE EFFECTS OF PESTICIDES ON THE VIABILITY OF MACRO INVERTEBRATES, SPECIFICALLY ARTEMIA FRANCISCANA, PHASE III
Alexa Anne Lunt
Weber High School, Pleasant View, UT

Utah produces over 90% of the world’s supply of brine shrimp, which generates over 100 million dollars in revenue annually. This study investigated the effect of pesticides on the viability of brine shrimp life cycle stages in the Great Salt Lake (GSL). Prior research indicated pesticides inhibited or preclude the hatch rates of brine shrimp. Further investigation was conducted to determine the effect of pesticides on the different stages of the brine shrimp life cycle. <br><br> Tests were conducted on the nauplii, sub adult, and adult stages by exposing brine shrimp to increasing concentrations of two pesticides currently detectable in the GSL: Malathion and Carbaryl. Three measures were used to determine the effect of the pesticides: survival rate (recorded at 10 and 30 minutes, 1 hour, 24 and 48 hours), correlation of effects on incremental concentrations, and analysis of the life cycle. <br><br> The data indicated at all concentrations and time increments the pesticide had a detrimental impact on brine shrimp. The data indicated the nauplii stage is most susceptible when exposed to Carbaryl, and Malathion is most harmful to the sub adult and adult stage in the life cycle. The research suggests the effects are more pronounced during the early life cycle stages of brine shrimp. <br><br> The application for this project is twofold. First, exposure to pesticides induces a negative effect on the viability of brine shrimp. Secondly, efforts to decrease the amount of pesticides washed into the GSL will protect the production of brine shrimp and create a sustainable environment.

RAPID INTERVENTION: A PRACTICAL SOLUTION FOR THE PROTECTION AGAINST BUTANE EXPLOSIONS
Mohammed Khalid Shafi
Alshafi Private Schools, Taif, SAUDI ARABIA

With the proliferation of cooking gas everywhere, its dangers increased. If gas leak occurred and wasn't detected , this will cause explosions that produce large amounts of harmful gases in the atmosphere, along with human and material losses. If the leak was detected by the person, he is liable for gas for a relatively long time with slow discharge of gas to outside the unit. We propose to introduce a system that identifies the gas and disconnects the power from the house at the time of leak with the separation of gas supply source. It also operates a network of exhaust fans that expel gas to a secondary tank for re-use of gas once again. We hypothesize that <br><br> the system will work efficiently with record speed in the performance of his mission and It will reduce the time needed to get rid of the gas leaking out manually. <br><br> An electromotor, mechanical belt, lamps and suction fans were used.

H2O SPLITTING USING PHOTON IN CHEMISTRY
Noor Tawfeek Alawadh
Jabal Alnoor Highschool, Khobar, SAUDI ARABIA

In order to get a clean (bacteria-free) water, we can add a catalyst substance to a polluted waters such as swamp waters which usually endanger surrounding inhabitants. Such substances, after getting excited by photons from sunlight energy, will split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. This chemical reaction process (photo-oxidation) will remove/ kill bacteria & other water contaminants.<br><br>Tools used are catalyst substance, water tanks, transparent plastic tubes, water pump, and controlling valve. We added the catalyst substance to the full tank with polluted water. Water-tank is connected with a tube which recycles water with the help of a pump. When light is focused on the mixed water (catalyst, bacteria and other contaminants), reaction takes place between light-photon and water molecules which is mixed with catalyst. Then, chemical radicals will be produced which will break the polluted mixed-water compound and kill the bacteria! All that reaction takes place in a reasonable time-frame and requires minimum energy during daylight.<br><br>Despite the fact that there are other methods to clean water with, such as using filters. These methods are not practical due to its high-cost especially to the majority of the world countries. Nevertheless, the idea of using photo-energy to kill bacteria and clean polluted-waters by utilizing free-sunlight together with catalyst (without negatively impacting water) is potentially a very promising technology.

CARBON SEQUESTRATION: HYDROXIDE AIR CAPTURE (THE ARTIFICIAL TREE)
Tyler Austin Clark
St. John High School/ Kansas Academy of Mathematics and Science, St. John/ Hays, KS

Carbon Sequestration, using hydroxide air capture is one method capable of reducing carbon dioxide gas concentration in the atmosphere. Devices that carry out the reaction between hydroxide compounds and carbon dioxide can be utilized to reduce the carbon footprint of an individual. These devices have practical applications in the reduction of emissions at the global level. This process can be used along with reduction of overall carbon dioxide emissions to reduce the impacts of global climate change. Carbon dioxide is captured in solid carbonate compounds and can be pumped using clean energy into depleted fossil fuel reservoirs. It can also be used in agrarian processes. These devices will be made available to communities to reduce carbon emissions at every possible level.

EROSION CONTROL OF MOUNTAINSIDE THROUGH ASEXUAL PROPAGATION USING RHUS GLABRA CIS-MONTANA
Ellie Antonia Vawdrey
Hillcrest High School, Midvale, UT

Corner Canyon is a mountainside located in Draper, Utah. In August of 2008 a fire destroyed more than 800 acres of vegetation on the mountainside. The fire essentially eradicated all established woody and herbaceous plants and their root systems. The lack of root systems increased the possibility of erosion. A method of propagation needed to be found that could efficiently mass-produce viable plants to control erosion during spring runoff. My goal was to find the most effective process to break dormancy and enable efficient production through asexual propagation of Rhus glabra cis-montana. Asexual propagation is very cost efficient in that a cutting is essentially a duplicate of the parent plant and is faster than seed propagation. Propagation can be achieved indoors during the winter months, and cuttings can be ready for planting in early spring. Hypothesis:Rhus glabra cis-montana is a good species to prevent erosion it can be economically produced by asexual propagation during the crucial winter months. Procedure: I took cuttings from a parent plant and planted them in selected test groups. I then treated the base with a rooting hormone powder and planted the cuttings in a porous artificial soil solution and propagated them in a greenhouse. I chose to use rooting hormone and bottom heat as my variables. Each category consisted of two flats with thirty-six cuttings each. Conclusion: Through my testing I found that the combination of bottom heat and rooting hormone was the most effective treatment to break the dormancy of Rhus glabra cis-montana. <br><br>

DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF A PORTABLE LIGHT TRAP FOR SAMPLING BRACHYURAN CRAB LARVAE
Heather Marie Eberhart
Bellarmine Preparatory School, Tacoma, WA

Crabs are a vital part of the marine ecosystem, so much so that if crabs were taken away, the ecosystem would suffer as a direct result. In an effort to study crabs in the larval zoea stage – the only swimming stage in a crab’s development during which they are the most phototaxis oriented – a new system of traps was necessary. The larval zoea stage is the most susceptible to environmental changes, yet it is the stage scientists know the least about. My goal was to design a system of traps that was both successful at capturing crab larvae and portable enough to be used at many diverse locations. This would provide scientists a means by which to monitor crab populations, which is an excellent indicator of the health of the marine ecosystem as a whole. The secondary focus was the investigation of the effect of light on the capture of brachyuran crab larvae. Key features of the light trap design were established, including a self-contained light source for portability, offset funnels for optimum capture, and a removable top piece for ease of sample collection. A flotation device, specifically tailored to the traps, was designed and sampling followed in May and June of 2009. The data from both samplings supported the hypothesis that light traps are effective and that the traps are highly successful in shallow and intertidal locations, where zoea stage crab larvae are found.

FOUNDRY SAND: WASTE OR BENEFICIAL, YEAR THREE
Kayleigh Sue Warner
DeKalb High School, Waterloo, IN

The project was twofold. First the foundry wanted to find an acceptable use for the byproduct of their castings which is foundry sand. The second was to quiet the concern of the community that foundry sand and dust contained carcinogens. The past two years of testing scientifically proved the byproduct presented no danger to the community as did this year. This year’s project concentrated on finding a way to recycle the foundry waste into a productive useable product instead of going into landfills.<br><br> My field test mixing foundry sand to the ratio of 15% and 20% with mulch obtained from OM Compost showed an increase of 10% by weight as compared to the control using tomato plants. The lab test at Trine University using Atomic Absorption and mass spectrometry scientifically proved the product to be chemically safe. The lab results showed using the atomic absorption that the control sample had 0.35 ppm of lead with ± .029 margin of error, the 15% mixture had 0.2 ppm of lead with ± 0.79 margin of error and the 20% mixture had 0.23 ppm of lead with.± .095 margin of error. A sample of the sand had 51.8 ppm of lead with ± 7.4 margin of error. Using mass spectrometry the control and sample runs mirrored each other with no differences in peaks.<br><br> In conclusion the chemical data showed the sand / mulch mixtures to be equal to or below the control, thus giving the local foundry a possible outlet for their waste material in a productive way.

THE "GREEN" WAY OF LAYERED-DOUBLE NICKEL HYDROXIDE: FROM WASTE TO ELECTRIC ENERGY
Olexandr Tokarev
Chemical Ecological Lyceum, Dnipropetrovsk, UKRAINE

World economy and ecological situation puts pressures on the producers to reduce their impact on the environment,while optimizing their production and cutting costs whenever possible. Disposal of the nickel-containing waste waters from the plating factories leads to burdens’ due to loss of expensive material and pollution of the environment.We developed Ni electroextraction system that reduces impact on the environment and improves economy of the production process by recycling Ni. Obtained Ni(OH)2 has superior specific capacity parameters and can be readily used in production of Ni-alkaline cells. <br><br>Aim of our research was development of a system for industrial Ni recycling to obtain Ni(OH)2 and study its structural and electrochemical properties. <br><br>Ni(OH)2 from the Ni waste waters was obtained by electrochemical extraction in slit-diaphragm electrolysis unit and compared to the industrial grade Ni(OH)2 Structural properties where investigated by X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis;electrochemical properties–by voltammogram and galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling. <br><br>We show that all NiOH2 samples from waste water are 2 forms layered double hydroxides(LDH). Specific capacities are:121A*h/kg for Ni(OH)2 from untreated water, 207A*h/kg for Ni(OH)2 from water treated with surfactant and bubble-film extraction, compared to 185A*h/kg for industrial Ni(OH)2.<br><br>Suggested process allows purification of alkaline and Ni-containing waste waters with effectiveness of 99% and extraction of high grade Ni(OH)2 with superior capacity properties. Costs of nickel hydroxide extraction from waste waters are $2/kg while industrial nickel hydroxide is $23/kg Electrochemical nickel hydroxide extraction yields 241 liters of H2/kg Ni(OH)2 that may be used as heat energy-carrier

EROSION: GOING, GOING, GONE...
Natalie Adelle Dyjak
Home school, Benson, AZ

The purpose of this project was to determine if increased angle and increased water volume statistically increased soil erosion. I hypothesized that if angle increased, soil erosion would statistically increase. I hypothesized that if water volume increased, soil erosion would statistically increase. I hypothesized that if angle and water volume increased simultaneously, soil erosion would be maximized. <br><br>I used four concrete blocks and a wooden box (97"x 22.5"x 3.5") to create four angles. I tested two water volumes: high volume (.26 liters per second) and low volume (.07 liters per second). I conducted eighty experiments over two days: ten experiments at both the low and high water volume at each angle. I determined initial soil volume by multiplying the box's length, width, and depth. After water application,I remeasured the length of the remaining soil and subtracted this measurement from the initial soil length to determine length of soil eroded. I multiplied the length of soil eroded by the soil width and depth (constants) to determine the volume of soil eroded.<br><br>I proved hypotheses one and two using the Pearson r correlation coeffient formula. Since the probability of r was less than .0001 and the level of significance was set at .05, both angle and soil erosion and water volume and soil erosion had statistical significance. I used a t-test to prove hypothesis three. My null hypothesis stated no difference in soil erosion would exist between the means of the low and high water volumes at angle four. I rejected my null hypothesis at t= -10.

THE EFFECTS OF NUTRIENT SUPPLEMENTATION ON IN SITU BIOREMEDIATION
Adair Louise Borges
Billings Senior High School, Billings, MT

Oil spills are common environmental crises which require effective, efficient cleanup to limit their negative environmental impacts. In-situ bioremediation, the process of using native bacteria to consume pollutants, can be a cost effective, and non-invasive engineering solution to oil spills, but degradation occurs slowly. Stimulating bacteria by environmental supplementation of nutrients was hypothesized to increase the timeliness of bioremediation. This project investigated the effects of;(1)adding trace minerals and biologically vital nutrients, and (2)varying the rate of nutrient supplementation, on bacterial cabability to metabolize oil under the conditions present in quiescent surface water.Two concentrations of trace minerals were evaluated, along with the addition of vital nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorous) at two different delivery rates. Half of the trials received an initial full loading of nutrients; the other half recieved an equivalent nutrient amount spread over a 14 day period. The experimental setup consisted of half gallon jars containing untreated lake water covered with a layer of diesel fuel. The effectiveness of the bioremediation process was measured by tracking changes in the diesel levels for samples over 25 days. Analysis of diesel levels versus time with natural logarithmic regression curves clearly delineated the results. This study demonstrated that (1) addition of trace minerals greatly increased bacterial diesel consumption; and (2) the delivery of nutrients over a period of 14 days improved bioremediation. These results identify a specified engineering approach for utilizing native bacteria to bioremediate an oil spill on quiescent surface water.

FORMULATING TRENDS OF NEMATODE DISTRIBUTIONS BASED ON THE MODIFIED BAERMANN FUNNEL EXTRACTIONS AND USING THE FOUR CORNERS NEMATODE FROM SOIL SAMPLES COLLECTED IN SAN JUAN COUNTY, NEW MEXICO PROVIDING A GUIDE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT DURING SITE RESTORATION PROJECT
Laura B. Lane
Aztec High School, Aztec, NM

There are over 20,000 gas wells in the Four Corners Area of New Mexico. When a gas well comes to end-of-life, energy companies must reclaim the abandoned well sites and access roads. Reclamation involves re-contouring, restoring topsoil, and reestablishing native vegetation. Reestablishing plant biodiversity quickly is desired and minimizes soil erosion, protects surface water and provides forage for animals. It typically takes two to five years to re-vegetate a site if the soil conditions are favorable.<br><br>Nematodes have been shown to be an effective indicator of soil ecosystem health. The purpose of this third-year project is to identify the desired nematode distributions that would indicate a healthy soil ecosystem and successful reclamation. <br><br>Sixty samples were collected from three geographic areas in San Juan County, NM. Status of site disturbance, soil conditions, and plant community were analyzed. A modified Baermann-Funnel extraction method and the Four Corner Nematode Key (Lane, 2008) was used to screen each sample. The data indicates that nematode distributions associated with particular plant communities are dependent on geographic areas. The trends can be used as an effective indicator of soil ecosystem health. A Four Corners guide for reclamation management is in-development. More samples next year will help complete the guide.

SELF-REINFORCED POLYMER COMPOSITE FROM POSTCONSUMER WASTE
Chun Hei Lam
Shun Tak Fraternal Association Yung Yau College, the New Territories, HONG KONG

Nowadays, considerable supplies of poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and polypropylene (PP) in the form of postconsumer scraps due to affluent lifestyle have caused serious environmental pollution and shortened the lifespan of landfills. The existing recycling process requires manual separation of different plastics. This labor-intensive procedure greatly increases the cost and its processing time. I would like to introduce a new method of recycling to solve these problems. In fact, I found out that these waste-streams of PET and PP could be a low cost source of raw materials for forming polymer composites.<br><br>In this study, a two-stage blending process was utilized to produce a microfibrillar composite of PET fibres in a PP matrix. The advantages of this improved process are time saving, and more environmentally friendly. It is also a breakthrough to process the two most consumed plastics, PP and PET in one recycling procedure. It will also cut the cost substantially. Furthermore, the PET/PP composite exhibits the properties similar to PP but with significant improvements on strength (>70%) and modulus (>350%) due to the increment on the degree of molecular orientation by solid-state drawing. Thus, lesser materials are required to withstand the same load. <br><br>This composite has many applications, e.g. making chairs, plastic bags and pipes. Experimental results also show that the number of recycling of the composite does not have significant adverse effects on its properties. Hence, this new two-stage blending process is an effective low cost recycling process for producing strengthened PET/PP composite from postconsumer waste.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF MAGNESIUM ACETATE ON THE CAPABILITY OF SYNECHOCYSTIS SP. STRAIN PCC 6803 SUSPENDED IN CALCIUM-ALGINATE TO REMOVE LEAD (II) FROM CONTAMINATED AQUATIC ENVIRONMENTS
Christina Anne-Josiane de Fontnouvelle
Wellesley High School, Wellesley, MA

The purpose of this project was to determine if the presence of magnesium acetate in lead-contaminated water affects the ability of the cyanobacterium, Synechocystis 6803, suspended in 2mm beads of calcium-alginate to take up lead II from water. Previous research has shown such methods to be effective in nanopure environments, but the effect of other substances commonly found in lakes such as magnesium has not been thoroughly researched. It was hypothesized that beads would sorb lower amounts of lead from solutions also containing magnesium acetate.<br><br> Beads containing either Ca-alginate alone or cyanobacteria suspended in alginate were stirred in a solution of 100ppm lead with or without 100ppm magnesium acetate. A lead probe monitored solution lead concentration over two hours. Both beads containing cyanobacteria suspended in alginate and beads containing alginate alone took up significantly lower amounts of lead from solutions containing magnesium acetate. Cyanobacterial beads took up 57% less lead when magnesium acetate was present, and beads containing plain Ca-alginate removed 65% less lead. Cyanobacterial beads were not found to take up significantly more lead than plain alginate beads. <br><br> The contributions of this project are relevant to the future success of bioremediation. As the cyanobacterium, Synechocystis 6803, took up significantly lower amounts of lead when magnesium acetate was present, it would probably also take up lower amounts of lead when exposed to contaminated lake water containing additional ions and compounds. New methods of bioremediation need to be researched, potentially involving ways to chemically bind ions in the water with other stable elements so that these ions would not interfere with the lead sorption process.

DETERMINING THE PHYTOREMEDIATION POTENTIAL OF BRASSICA RAPA WITH ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAE AS A PLAUSIBLE AGENT FOR INCREASING HEAVY-METAL UPTAKE USING A WATER CULTURE HYDROPONIC SYSTEM
Vivien Macnguyen
Oak Grove High School, San Jose, CA

Phytoremediation is an environmental-friendly, cost-efficient, and entirely natural method of extracting unwanted hazardous heavy metals from soils and water as opposed to other common methods of soil remediation which include excavation and pump and treat. In my project, I attempt to optimize phytoremediation by combining a rapid-growing hyperaccumulative plant, Brassica rapa, with Arbuscular Mycorrhizal fungi (Glomus Mosseae) which lives in symbiosis with plants and elongates its roots for easier access to nutrients and trace elements. The Brassica genus of plants is known for the ability to accumulate unusually high concentrations of heavy-metals in soil without significantly affecting its development and health, which makes Brassica rapa a promising candidate for phytoremediation. In my experiment, I grew non-mycorrhizal and mycorrhizal plants in two separate water culture hydroponic systems with each containing 400 ppm cadmium chloride. Data collection consisted of taking samples of the water supply in which the roots of the plants were submerged each day, using dithizone as a heavy-metal indicator and measuring specific concentrations through a spectrophotometer. After two trials, running from 7-14 days, Mycorrhizal-inoculated plants proved to have a faster cadmium uptake than non-mycorrhizal plants. In general, the plants were able to tolerate the high concentration of cadmium fairly well, but mycorrhizal plants were more tolerant. As a result, I can conclude that Brassica rapa with a mycorrhizal symbiosis is a promising natural phytoremediative system.

INTERPRETING THE NUTRIENT LIMITATIONS, SEASONAL VARIATIONS, AND SALINITY OF FLORIDA BAY IN ORDER TO ANALYZE SHIFTS IN SPECIES AND BIOMASS PRODUCTIVITY
Jonathan Anthony Prendergast
Felix Varela Senior High School, Miami, FL

One step in predicting future productivity and growth of the ecosystem in the Florida Everglades is comprehending the dispersion of nutrient contents in the water according to their position and variation in amounts of salinity. In order to observe these conditions, scientists collect and analyze samples of macro-algae as well as water samples. These marine samples contained a plentiful amount of the macro-algae, Halimeda incrassata and Penicillus lamorouxi, and can be utilized to determine fluctuations in nutrient content, species production, plus biomass. <br><br> The utilization of macro-algae nutrients has not been a widely-used process, but can serve as a very significant predictor of the Florida Bay ecosystem’s productivity. The objective of this experiment is to collect and analyze macro-algae for nutrient content in order to determine future hydrological and ecological patterns. In more specific terms, this experiment tests the hypothesis that if samples from a marine bank are cleaned, incinerated, and analyzed for phosphorous and nitrogen, then a subsequent analysis of nutritional data will expose productivity and biomass patterns in Florida Bay. <br><br> In this experiment, samples of macro-algae were collected, cleaned, incinerated, plus tested and analyzed for nitrogen and phosphorous content. Preliminary results revealed results that follow a trend in nutrient content according to the regions the samples were collected from in comparison to their variations in salinity and purity.

THE EFFECTS OF NATURAL PEROXIDASE AS A LIGNIN DECOMPOSER IN MODERN LANDFILLS
Lexis Ann Sherman
Mansfield High School, Mansfield, MO

The average American home produces 28 pounds of newspaper each month and nationally about 35% of newspaper is put into landfills. Lignin is found in newspaper because it is a component of cell walls, making newspaper hard to decompose. This project was to determine the effects of natural peroxidase on the breakdown of lignin in newspaper. <br><br>Raw turnips, the source of natural peroxidase, were blended into a slurry. Twenty-three grams of newspaper and 50ml of water (control group) or 50ml of turnip extract (experimental group) composed each sample. Thirteen samples were each incubated in 22ºC, 40ºC and 60ºC, making a total of 39 samples. Each sample was then tested every 7 days for 3 weeks. One gram of sample was digested with 50 ml of water and 20 ml of 1.0 Molar hydrochloric acid over heat and then filtered. The filter paper containing the residual sample was placed to dry on a clean surface for 24 hours and then massed. The same procedure was done each week for three weeks. <br><br>The conclusion of this study was that samples of newspaper treated with a natural peroxidase decomposed more lignin than samples of newspaper treated with only water by the third week at 22 degrees (p=0.0499984), 40 degrees (p=0.000097981), and 60 degrees (p=0.0000000164).

STYROFOAM'S ACHILLES HEEL: THE EFFECT OF OLIOPHILIC BACTERIA ON STYRENE
Giovanni Righi
Collins Hill High School, Suwanee, GA

Polystyrene (Styrofoam™) will not biodegrade in the environment because it is too large a polymer for bacteria to absorb. However, if it can be proven that bacteria can absorb its monomer styrene, then there may be hope that there is a pathway for biodegradation. This study examines a vital step in this process, analyzing growth when styrene is given as the only carbon source to the hydrocarbon-metabolizing bacteria Alcaligenes viscolactis, Pseudomonas putida, Vibrio fischeri, and Pseudomonas fluorescens.<br><br> M9 minimal medium was prepared using 64g Na2HPO4-7H2O, 15g KH2PO4, 2.5g NaCl, 5.0g NH4Cl, and 1000ml of distilled water; it was sterilized by autoclaving. It was then mixed with each species of bacteria in a 4:1 ratio, and 50 microliters of this mixture were put into each well of a 96-well plate. Then, two parts of styrene were dissolved into three parts of cyclohexane to keep styrene in a separate phase, and 25 microliters of this solution was then placed into half of the wells while the other half served as the control. The well plate was scanned in a Multiskan EX plate reader every 20 minutes for 25 hours, for a total of 7200 readings of absorbance. Three of the four species’ average absorbance increased statistically (except Pseudomonas putida, p=0.523), indicating a higher concentration of cells with the styrene than without, which leads to the conclusion that Alcaligenes viscolactis, Vibrio fischeri, and Pseudomonas fluorescens were able to use styrene for energy. This could lead us towards the bioremediation of polystyrene.

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF VARIOUS TYPES OF DRAINAGE SYSTEMS AND THE PRODUCTION OF AN IDEAL SYSTEM
Brittney Whittingham Parker
Hilton Head Preparatory School, Hilton Head Island, SC

This project was a test to determine the most effective highway storm water filtration system. The systems tested were natural ground surface filtration, a grass drainage ditch, and a cement flume. These three systems were tested and analyzed in order to produce an ideal system. It was predicted that natural ground surface runoff would filter the storm water best because it has the most surface area on the particulate to trap pollutants. <br><br> The experiment began by locating testing sites near a road and a clear final drainage point. Then the storm water collection pipes were placed in the ground at these sites. After the first ten centimeters of water collected, the floater blocked off excess rainwater and prevented loss of the initial pollutant runoff. The water was tested for pollutants such as chlorine, copper, nitrates, nitrites, pesticides, alkalinity, hardness, lead, and iron.<br><br> The experiment was successful in that it confirmed the surface groundwater runoff was the most effective in eliminating 100% of the nitrates, nitrites, copper and iron. The hardness and alkalinity increased at each site which is attributable to the presence of calcium carbonate in coastal soil. High hardness and alkalinity levels help neutralize the pH of the water, positively impacting the environment. <br><br> The data was used to produce an ideal model. This project was successful in determining that groundwater runoff in combination with drainage ditches would produce an ideal drainage and filtration system, therefore eliminating the most pollutants and neutralizing the pH of the storm water runoff.

DEVELOPING AN ATTRACTANT FOR MASS TRAPPING THE INVASIVE COCONUT RHINOCEROS BEETLE
Anran Li
St. John's School, Tumon Bay, GUAM

This project attempts to develop a novel attractant that will aid attempts to eradicate the invasive coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB), Oryctes rhinoceros (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) from the island of Guam. CRB adults damage coconut palms when they bore holes into crowns to feed on sap and kill trees when they bore through the growing tip. Fifty percent of coconut palms were killed in Samoa and Palau when CRB invaded these Pacific island groups during the last century. Without coconut trees, tourism, a major business for Guam and other Pacific Islands, may dwindle. To prevent high tree mortality, 1400 vaned bucket traps using Orcytalure®, a synthetic aggregation pheromone, were installed at various locations throughout the island. Damage to trees within the mass trapping area indicates that the traps are not efficacious. A survey of 581 coconut palms growing at the Pacific Islands Club Resort in July 2008 showed that 73 (13%) had been damaged by CRB adults. A map of the survey showed a large cluster of damaged palms in the immediate vicinity of the resort's open-air spa. This spa uses several organic lotions for massage and aromatherapy and I hypothesized that trees around the spa are attacked when CRB are attracted into the area by the volatiles from these lotions. An assortment of lotions were purchased from the spa and tested for attractiveness in a four-arm olfactometer. Results indicate that one of these lotions, "Body Butter," is highly attractive to CRB adults. The "Body Butter" mixture was 47% as attractive as the pure Orcytalure® pheromone. When the active ingredient in "Body Butter" is extracted and purified, its discovery could lead to the development of a powerfull CRB attractant that will help to eradicate the CRB from Guam.

MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION OF SIGHTING AREAS OF THE WEST INDIAN MANATEE (TRICHECHUS MANATUS) IN THE SOUTH-CENTRAL COSTAL AREA OF PUERTO RICO AND PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF ITS NATURAL HABITAT, PHASE IV
Luis Enrique Valentin-Alvarado
Elvira M. Colon Negron, Santa Isabel, PUERTO RICO

The West Indian Manatee (Trichechus manatus) is an herbivorous marine mammal that usually lives in the marine habitats in different regions of Puerto Rico. The hypothesis was that the natural physical, chemical and biological aspects of the West Indian Manatee’s habitat influence its immunological system and consequently determines the health of the species. The manatee’s habitat has an average temperature of 28°C and the pH is 7. The soil concentration of potassium is high, the phosphorus is low and the nitrate is medium. There is an abundance of macro and micro-organisms and seagrasses.<br><br> <br><br>Phytochemical and antifungal analyses were done to Thalassia testudinum and Syringodium filiforme leaves, which are the principal food source of the species. The samples were collected where the species live. Extracts of the plant’s leaves were prepared. The first extract was prepared with 100 g fresh vegetal tissue in 100 mL of distilled water. The second extract was prepared with 100 g of leaves and 100 mL of ethanol 95%. The extracts were diluted to 1:10, 1:100, and 1:1,000. Phytochemical screening of the extracts evidenced the presence of flavonoids, saponins, xanthophylls, chlorophylls and carotene. The antifungal effect was analyzed versus five fungi species (Aspergillus niger, Cladosporium sp, Candida albicans, Fusarium sp, Penicillium sp). The impregnated paper disc method was used. <br><br>The results evidenced that the pure extract inhibits the fungi growth that causes illness to the T. manatus. It can be concluded that the natural habitat of the manatee protects it from diseases.

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF ACIDIFICATION EFFECTS ON STRUCTURAL DECALCIFICATION BETWEEN SAMPLES OF CORAL EXOSKELETONS MONTASTRAEA CAVERNOSA AND DIPLORIA CLIVOSA
Angelica I. Cruz-Lebron
High School Luis Munoz Marin, Yabucoa, PUERTO RICO

The increase in atmospheric CO2 levels are acidifying the oceans. This is significant for coral reefs because acidification strips carbonate ions from corals, making it difficult for corals to build rigid calcareous skeletons. This comparative analysis studied the acidification wear and the structural softening of two coral exoskeletons: Montastraea cavernosa and Diploria clivosa. The hypothesis was that if acidification periods affect the exoskeletons composition by decalcification of the structures of coral Montastraea cavernosa and Diploria clivosa then these two species have different resistance in their structural composition. <br><br>Four exoskeleton samples of each coral species were collected. Samples were washed and sun dried for two days. Mass, length, height and width of each sample was measured. Four samples of each species were placed in two separate water tanks. A total of .0379kg of aquarium salt were added into each tank. Water in each tank was tested weekly for turbidity, pH and dissolved oxygen. The pH measurements ranked from 8.0 to 3.0 during the experimentation period. After ten weeks the samples were measured. Organisms such as cyanobacteria were observed growing in the coral samples. Results evidenced a reduction in the size and mass of each sample of the two species. But the samples of Diploria clivosa were more affected than those of Montastraea cavernosa. Results evidenced that acidification periods affect the exoskeleton of two coral species but that they have different resistance in their structural composition. Maybe coral exoskeletons can be used to build artificial reefs because organisms can grow on them.

NOVEL SYNTHESIS: IMIDACLOPRID CYP450 PESTICIDE SYNERGIST FROM DILL LOWERS SURFACE RUNOFF TOXICITY
Emma Jean Graham
Lisgar Collegiate Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA

Resistance to imidacloprid in the Colorado Potato Beetle has become a worldwide environmental problem. One solution is to add a synergist to the pesticide; insects lose their resistance to the original pesticide with the addition of a different compound to the formulation. This innovation involves the synthesis and testing of a new dillapiol inspired imidacloprid synergist on the Colorado Potato Beetle. The result is a pesticide formulation that is more environmentally friendly than formulations used presently. In the first study, a full investigation of possible synthetic improvements to dillapiol was undertaken and a dillapiol analogue was synthesized. In the second study, in vivo bioassays were performed to determine the standard toxicity of Indian dill oil, dillapiol and the dillapiol dimer to the Colorado Potato Beetle. Measurements as a pesticide and as a synergist were taken and standardized against the LC50 dose of imidacloprid. In the third study, in vitro bioassays on Cytochrome P450 3A4 were performed to investigate the mode of action of the dillapiol dimer. Out of all the substances tested in these studies, the most potent as imidacloprid synergists is the dillapiol dimer. It possesses insecticide synergist properties and has less environmental impact, and can therefore potentially be used as a replacement for the popular pesticide synergist piperonyl butoxide (a carcinogen). This compound can be used in conjunction with Imidacloprid to create a pesticide formulation with less negative environmental impact.

GOT GAS?: FEASIBILITY OF A METHANE CAPTURE SYSTEM
Kimberly Nicole Gulevich
North Peace Secondary School, Fort St. John, British Columbia, CANADA

This project studies the feasibility of using a methane capture system on a household sewage lagoon. In Phase One, a hydrogen sulphide scrubber was designed and tested to reduce hydrogen sulphide levels in biogas below Canadian Oil and Gas Pipeline Standards. In Phase Two, a methane capture system was designed and implemented on a household sewage lagoon. Methane is produced by anaerobic bacteria during the secondary decomposition of organic matter. The methane capture system utilized weeping tile pipe and a geomembrane cover to collect the biogas. The biogas was then collected and analyzed over a five month period to determine the economic and environmental feasibility of a small scale methane capture system. This project demonstrated that single family household sewage lagoons produce an insignificant amount of methane. The costs of installing and maintaining such a system was much greater than the energy produced. Modifications to the lagoon would be needed in order to make a small scale methane capture system economically feasible. This project also demonstrated that the methane emissions from household sewage lagoons have a minimal environmental impact. Several factors could have affected the results, including the type of bacteria due to the shape of the lagoon, a low organic matter to grey water ratio, or aerobic bacteria utilizing the methane as a carbon source. Variables within this project included environmental temperature and organic matter quantity. This research supplies useful information for designing other methane capture systems that involve a larger scale or with different sources of organic matter.

GRASPING WATER: EXPLORING A NOVEL METHOD OF INDUCING PRECIPITATION
Yiyue Zhao
Sir Winston Churchill High School, Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA

Global warming is causing the Northern hemisphere to have increasingly less precipitation, resulting in a 9%-17% decrease over the next century. Currently, silver iodide (AgI) can be used as an ice nucleator in cloud seeding to induce precipitation. However, finding an alternative for AgI is crucial because regions seeded with AgI have excess silver in the soil, inhibiting microorganisms’ metabolism. Cloud seeding usage is severely limited due to the ecological ramifications of AgI. This project explores the possibility of replacing AgI with the Ice Nucleating Protein (INP) of the bacteria Pseudomonas syringae. Phase I examined AgI's and INP’s effects on the nitrogen-fixing bacteria at the root nodule of ryegrass, and consequently on the ryegrass's nitrogen intake. The question of primary importance is whether INP has less effect than AgI on the nitrogen intake of ryegrass. Phase II used the droplet-freezing assay to compare the two ice nucleators' capacities to catalyze ice nucleation. The results of Phase I showed that after a two-week exposure to 1.0% AgI concentration, the ryegrass’s growth rate (sample size=900) decreased by 30.0% (p<0.05). INP had no influence, at a 95% confidence interval, on the growth rate. Most importantly, the results of the droplet-freezing assay indicated that INP had the same ability (p<0.05) as AgI in catalyzing ice nucleation when particulate matter was present. The results of this project suggest that INP may be an environmentally-friendly and commercially-viable alternative for AgI. Cloud seeding using INP could have major implications, such as alleviating drought or clearing smog.

THE EFFECT OF BIOMASS TYPE ON HYDROTHERMALLY CARBONIZED BIOCHAR AS A SOIL SUPPLEMENT AND ENERGY SOURCE
Afia Zarrin Khan
Spring Valley High School, Columbia, SC

To combat the net increase of atmospheric carbon and associated climate change, the carbon-negative implementation of biochar is proposed. Hydrothermally carbonized biochar produced from banana peel, cornstalk, and Gardenia jasminoides leaves were characterized as agents for carbon sequestration, fertilization, and energy storage. Each biomass was shredded, placed with water into airtight reactors, and heated at 250° C for 21 hours. The mixture was cooled, and the solid product was filtered out and dried at 80° C for 24 hours. Calculated biochar yield rates indicated that the three yields were significantly different; F(2,26)=29.05, p<0.05. A Scheffe’ test determined that the cornstalk biochar yield was significantly greater than the other two biomasses’ yields respectively. Energy contents were measured with a calorimeter, and a linear model was created to predict energy based on coded biomass; r(8)=0.814, p=0.014. The biochar from Gardenia jasminoides leaves had the highest energy content. Measured water retention capabilities indicated all biochar/soil combinations retained significantly higher proportions of water than raw soil; t(2.6)=3.00, p=0.03, suggesting successful use as a soil supplement to improve crop yields. Gas Chromatography was performed to measure methane, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen concentrations. Banana peel char emissions had the least concentrations of both greenhouse gases, but the highest concentration of hydrogen. Results suggest hydrothermal carbonization is a viable means to utilize unwanted agricultural residue. Cornstalk is the most likely candidate for a large-scale system because of its yield rate and abundance, but banana peel biochar is preferable for its high energy content and environmental friendliness.

THE PREFERENCE IN PREDATION OF THE NATIVE AQUATIC BUG, ANISOPS NASUTUS, ON THE LARVAE OF FOUR MOSQUITO SPECIES FOUND IN AMERICAN SAMOA
Faaloloi Teo
Tafuna High School, Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA

Problems with conventional control methods such as the development of insecticide resistance in the target mosquitoes and the harmful effects of insecticides on non-target species and human health have prompted efforts to find alternative control methods for mosquito vectors. One such alternative is biological control. In this study experiments were undertaken to test the predatory potential and preference of the native notonectid bug, Anisops nasutus, preying on the larvae of four mosquito species found in American Samoa: Aedes aegypti, Aedes oceanicus, Aedes polynesiensis, and Culex quinquefasciatus. Two experiments were conducted under laboratory conditions. The first experiment measured predation rate on each larval stage (instar) of each mosquito species. The second assessed prey preference of A. nasutus. For all four prey species the highest average predation was recorded in first instar mosquito larvae and the lowest average predation was established in the fourth instar mosquito larvae. The average predation value depended on the size of the mosquito. In a choice test the species most preferred by A. nasutus was Ae. polynesiensis, an important vector of dengue and filariasis in American Samoa. The results of the study show that A. nasutus is a promising biocontrol agent in laboratory conditions. More studies are recommended for a biocontrol strategy development.

METHODS FOR THE REDUCTION OF METHANE RELEASED DURING THE CULTIVATION OF RICE
John Hill Price
Navasota High School, Navasota, TX

Methane released by humans is a major contributor to anthropogenic climate change, and the cultivation of rice accounts for approximately fifteen percent of this methane. The purpose of this experiment was to determine if the amount of methane released could be decreased by either adding gravel to or pumping air through the soil in which the rice is grown. It was hypothesized that pumping air through the soil would result in the greatest reduction in methane as compared to a control. To carry out this experiment, six air-tight chambers were built; with air tubing with holes poked in it was placed in the bottom of two. Six inches of soil were placed in four of these boxes, including the two with the tubing. In the last two boxes, three inches of gravel and three inches of soil, mixed were added. Two inches of water were added to each box, and finally forty milliliters were placed in the boxes. Air pumps were attached to the ends of the tubing, and the boxes were sealed. Approximately one month later, air samples were taken from the boxes and tested for methane concentration using a gas chromatograph. It was found that the control boxes, with no additions, had an average methane concentration of 2.95 parts per million (ppm). The boxes to which gravel had been added had average methane concentration 2.35 ppm. The groups where air had been pumped through the soil had an average methane concentration of 1 ppm. The results show that both methods had some effect in decreasing methane concentration, and that pumping air through the soil was more effective.

SUSTAINABILITY IN A HOME
Royce Jay Brady
Red Mesa High School, Teec Nos Pos, AZ

I believe modifying a roof turbine vent with a aluminum helical shape inserted into it, will stir the warmth and cooled air of a home while at the same time producing light and charging a twelve volt battery.<br><br>I mounted the turbine on the table with the three foot all thread going through the center of the hole (from top to bottom). A bike wheel (30.48 centimeters) was next to be mounted below of the turbine and table top. 12.7 centimeters below the bike wheel was the fan which then mounted to the all thread. Both of these objects were screwed above and below the wooden fan and bike wheel. After the fan was mounted, it be came cleared that I needed to position the bike generator where it would produce enough friction to transfer energy from the generator to the three volt light bolt. It worked best when put on top of the wheel, so that is its position. Lastly, the three volt light bolt was screwed on the top of the table where it was visual to see the light be produce.<br><br>More revolutions per minute will cause friction on the wheel to rub on the bike generator, as the wheel rubs on the generator, energy will eventually be transferring from the generator to three volt light bolt. While testing, my data from the tests prove that less rpm’s will only light up the three volt light bolt for a short period of time, but having to increase more rpm’s in result a longer lasting light will visually happen.

EARTH'S LEFTOVERS: INCREASING COMPOST KINETICS BY USING AN ORGANIC ACCELERANT
Tiffany Michelle Swinney, Alyson Sapirman, Shelby Koos
Crooms Academy of Information Technology, Sanford, FL

We wanted to find out what type of substances would work the best to encourage the decomposition of a compost heap. We predicted that if we made three compost sections that haad the same amounts of grass clippings and leaves and then left one alone for the control, added a chemical decomposer one, and added a home-made decomposer tho the other, then the "home-made" section of the compost bin's materials would decompose faster than the control and chemical sections. Also the "home-made" section of the compost would have a higher average temperature which showed it had decomposed the most. <br><br>Decomposition was determined by the average temperature of the sections; we gathered the same amount of materials for the three sections and applied our chemical mix (Mix 2) to one of the sections. The home-made mix (Mix 1) was applied to another section and the third was left as the control. Every three days, we stirred and added more substance to the sections. The sections were covered with black tarp and the temperature of each section was recorded every four days. <br><br>At the end of 48 days the control's average temperature was 24.25 degrees Celsius. The Home-made's average temperature was 26 degrees Celsius. The Chemical's average was 24.67 degrees Celsius. <br><br>These results combined with the obvious difference in the appearances of the sections lead to the conclusion that the Home-made mixture (Mix 1) had encouraged decomposition the most.

THE COMPARISON OF COMPRESSION STRENGTH ENDPOINTS ON CONCRETE COMPOSITION
Lorrisa Rose Craigmile, Leandra Craigmile, 
Lincoln High School, Thief River Falls, MN

The purpose of this project was to observe if adding materials to a concrete composition would change the compression strength endpoints on landscaping pavers. The experimental hypothesis states, if landscaping blocks are made of a traditional concrete composition, a concrete and recycled plastic composition, and a concrete and prairie grass composition, then the landscaping block composition of concrete and recycled plastic will have the same compression strength endpoint than the bocks made of concrete and prairie grass. Fifteen bricks were made of each composition, traditional, plastic chips, and prairie grass. Bricks were then broken and the compression strength endpoints were recorded. The hypothesis was accepted because the results showed that the traditional concrete composition had a mean average of 705; while the plastic had a compression endpoint average of 647; and the prairie grass had a endpoint of 635. However, when error bars were added it was found that there were no significant statistical differences in the results. <br><br>This experiment indicated that being economically friendly when gardening or landscaping your home is not that difficult. The more we can cut down on using our natural will help the world to live a long and healthy life.

ENHANCED SPRINKLING SYSTEM WITH ENERGY-EFFICIENT APPLICATIONS AT STEVENSON SCHOOL
Michael Lin, Jimmy Lin, 
Robert Louis Stevenson Upper School, Pebble Beach, CA

Stevenson’s students can now safely utilize a previously dark and dangerous shortcut since this project was implemented in campus and providing a new looking on this environmental issue using simple engineering means. This project empowers an enhanced sprinkling system not only serving its purpose, but also generates electricity for beneficial applications from originally wasted energy. This system self-supplies its power by attaching generators in sprinkling water path and stores the generated electricity in a battery as power supply for facilities, such as motion sensor, timer, LED. For durable operation, a solar panel is added as an auxiliary energy source for free. In this project, few experiments have been conducted for measuring water pressure, effective sprinkling range, and the resulted flow volume. We applied Physics concepts learned in class to verify the collected data with accepted values. In an ideal environment with 100% energy conversion, the system would create electricity equivalent to four cents and save $4.86 in water usage per month at this stage, which totals to 75.6% saving of the original sprinkling cost. The system has been installed and operating in Stevenson’s campus since January, 2010. This project has successfully demonstrated how we can employ the energy originally insignificant or ignored in the environment, but create an efficient application with benefits. For example, the throughput at the shortcut pathway at night has been three times than ever.

DECOMPOSITION OF ORGANIC WASTE FROM HOUSEHOLDS AND SCHOOLS UNDER THEIR FERMENTATION METHODS COMBINED WITH FARMING PERIONYX EXCAVATUS
Vu Kim Thanh Tran, Ha Thi Thu Dinh, 
Da Teh High School, Lam Dong, Lam Dong, VIETNAM

This study was conducted to build a waste treatment process in small scale in schools and families. We have already carried out some experiments in producing compost from the school and family’s wastes differently. As a result, we have got a complete and advantageous process in solving wastes in schools and families. <br><br> This project has two main advantages. First, it has changed the previous methods of solving garbage in schools and families. Second, it has helped everyone – especially students- be aware of environmental protection.<br><br>Process is as follows: <br><br>Step 1: Collect the trash and classify it into two categories: 1. Organic wastes - originating from plants and animals' bodies - easily decomposed 2. Inorganic garbage such as plastic, polymers, and rubber (recyclable)- hard decomposed. <br><br>Step 2: Have 3 plastic containers in advance (not less than 45 liters per container - depending on each family’s garbage - to use alternately), and auxiliary substances such as phosphate, microbial products, lime. <br><br>Step 3: Put the garbage mixed with auxiliary substances in the first container for about 15 to 20 days, and then add worms. Then add daily garbage until the first one is full. The same way is for the 2nd and the third container. When the third one is full, the garbage in the first one turns into compost and worms are big enough to sell. <br><br> Estimatedly,each family needs only three containers to treat their daily garbage in this way. Regarding schools'garbage, it depends on amount of garbage, each school builds containers of different size to treat it. Obviously, This waste treatment really profitable and feasible in rural areas. In addition, it helps to raise people's and especially students'awareness of protecting enviroment.

POSTCARDS FROM THE BAY: A COMPARISON OF THREE PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITIES IN MONTEREY BAY
Joanna Katherine Claire Coker, Kelly Chesus, 
San Lorenzo Valley High School, Felton, CA

Phytoplankton play a crucial role in the world’s ocean, providing oxygen, a food source, and a carbon sink. After quantifying the biodiversity of phytoplankton in Santa Cruz harbor last year, we have since expanded our focus to compare the abundance and diversity of phytoplankton at three additional sites: the North Santa Cruz Harbor and the Santa Cruz and Monterey Wharfs. This is the first time data from these sites has been compared, enabling us to determine if phytoplankton populations in the Monterey Bay Marine Sanctuary are influenced by location or other larger factors. We hypothesize that the two wharf locations will have a greater biodiversity and abundance of species than the harbor locations due to the harbor’s limited access to the open ocean. Additionally, we predict that the biodiversity and abundance patterns of the wharf sites will be more similar to each other than the harbor sites. If true, this result could indicate that phytoplankton in the Sanctuary are influenced by broad factors rather than more localized conditions. To gather our data, we collect a sample of phytoplankton twice a month using a 20 um mesh net from two sites in the North and South Harbor and record several environmental factors. We microscopically identify species and determine abundance. We then graph our data and compare it to data from Santa Cruz and Monterey Wharfs.

RECYCLING OF STYROFOAM: APPLICATION IN RETENTION OF WATER HEAVY METAL IONS
Carlos Henrique Leite da Silva, Paolo Damas Pulcine, Amanda de La Rocque
ETEC Getulio Vargas, Sao Paulo, SP, BRASIL

Styrofoam (expanded polystyrene) is widely used nowadays, however its recycling through conventional methods is very unexplored and unfeasible. The inappropriate disposal of Styrofoam takes a lot of space; it can also harm entire ecosystems if thrown into rivers and seas. Water contamination by ionic heavy metals can also be very dangerous to Human beings. We intend to solve these problems with “chemical recycling” of Styrofoam, by altering its molecular formula and making the product useful for retention of ionic metals of contaminated water. The process consists of adding a sulfonic group on a benzenic ring of the polystyrene, so it can acquire the property of doing ionic changes. We have analyzed the product of reaction in order to determine method and product efficiency. To determine the sulfonation level we made a reverse potentiometric titration using a standardized solution of chloridric acid and sodium hydroxide. Then, we compared the retention of ion Fe(III) using a Fe(III) 500ppm solution treated with different masses of the resin; we used KSCN to analyze the relative retention of Fe(III). The resin regeneration was tested with chloridric acid; the performance of the recovered resin was qualitatively compared to the results of the virgin resin. Through these results, we conclude that the study and continuous improvement of the method are feasible, as the re-utilization of the recycled Styrofoam is helpful on treatment of water.

ENHANCING BIOFILTERS: THE IMPACT OF ABSCISIC ACID ON THE SEQUESTRATION OF HEAVY METALS BY EUGLENA GRACILIS
Hannah Michele Berkowitz, Jackie Bokor, 
Long Beach High School, Lido Beach, NY

Euglena gracilis are able to sequester unwanted and toxic metals from mine, factory, and sewage drainage systems. Euglena remove these metals from their environment and sequester them within vacuoles, where digestive enzymes convert the metals into insoluble compounds through oxidation-reduction reactions. We introduced abscisic acid, a stress hormone produced in plants, to Euglena in order to increase their tolerance for levels of CdSO4, MnSO4, and CuSO4 in a high stress environment. First, a precursor test was done where each metal at 0.03M 0.01M, 0.008M, 0.006M, and 0.004M concentrations were tested to determine the greatest level of metal that the Euglena were able to tolerate. Abscisic acid was added to the Euglena with the greatest tolerated molar concentration of metal at 0.002M, 0.0015M, and 0.001M and tested against control groups. Absorbance levels were tested using a spectrophotometer at 400nm (CdSO4), 420nm (MnSO4), and 600nm (CuSO4) and ranged from 0.711A to 0.090A. We found that Euglena supplemented with abscisic acid were able to reduce the concentration of all the metals to a significantly greater extent than the Euglena alone. On a large scale, these findings are important because they greatly increase the potential of Euglena to act as efficient biofilters of toxic heavy metals. Abscisic acid added to a drainage system within a holding basin, also containing Euglena, is a proposed idea to remove and sequester greater amounts of metals. This research can ultimately prevent the buildup of these harmful compounds to levels that are toxic to the soil and biotic factors in a wide range of ecosystems.

MUSSELS, A NATURAL SOLUTION TO BUG SPRAY TOXICITY: EVALUATION OF GEUKENSIA DEMISSA AS DEET BIOFILTERS IN RUNOFF WATER
Jane E. Smyth, Arianne Papa, 
Long Beach High School, Lido Beach, NY

N, n-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), the active ingredient in most insect repellents, was recently found at trace levels in waterways around the world. This project aims to combine the filtration abilities of Geukensia demissa (ribbed mussels) with short-term exposure to DEET in waterways. If Geukensia demissa can tolerate and filter DEET at the levels found in the environment, they could be applied as biofilters, preventing bioaccumulation and damage to sensitive species. This experiment tracked the pathway of DEET from Lolium multiflorum (ryegrass) to a salt water marsh by first simulating an application of insect repellent in various concentrations on the Lolium multiflorum. The levels of DEET accumulation in the Lolium multiflorum, determined by spectrophotometry of cells at DEET’s peak wavelength (265 nm), were combined with qualitative indications of viability in order to determine the effects of the chemical. To simulate runoff, Geukensia demissa were exposed to DEET concentrations. Absorbance by tissues and filtration rate of DEET were both analyzed. It was found that DEET at concentrations in typical insect repellents was toxic to the Lolium multiflorum and absorption increased with higher applied <br><br>concentration. Geukensia demissa exposed to 1g DEET/30L were able to accumulate the DEET in their tissues and the concentration in the water significantly decreased (p<.0001 ANOVA). They were able to tolerate the level of DEET without displaying any signs of toxicity. Though this is the first time the idea has been proposed, the experiment provides promising evidence that ribbed mussels can be used in the future as industrial-scale biofilters.

Edward Clark High School, Las Vegas, NV

The purpose of this project was to determine which sand would be best to use when constructing man-made beaches. Sand from man-made beaches has been known to run-off, covering nearby coral reefs and ultimately killing them. “Best” in terms of the project is geological substances that produce the least displacement, thereby saving coral reefs. <br><br>A wave generator was designed for this project. Each sample of sand was mixed with water, and weighed for a starting point. Then 15 waves were manually generated with two second intervals. Visual and weight displacements were recorded. Between each trial the mechanism was rinsed and dried. Trials were repeated three times per sand type.<br><br>Visual and weight displacement data was then gathered and averaged for each sand type. The sand from Sunset Beach in California was the best, producing a 0.5 oz average mass displacement and a 4.33 cm average visual displacement, the least amount of each type. The sand from Siesta Key Beach in Florida was the worst, producing a 2.067 oz average mass displacement and a 16 cm average visual displacement, the most of both types of displacement. <br><br>To avoid killing off coral reefs when constructing beaches, it would be helpful to know which type of sand produces the least displacement therefore protecting the marine environment around the beach

GRAY MATTERS: USING GREY WATER FROM AIR CONDITIONING UNITS TO REDUCE BATHROOM WATER CONSUMPTION
Abrar Saleh AlTurkistani, Tahani Badeeb, Raneem Binismail
AlFerdous Private Schools, Jeddah, SAUDI ARABIA

Because we live in Jeddah which is located on the sea, the high temperature with relatively high humidity is dominant over the year which causes a big consumption of water for drinking and bathing. Moreover, the above average use of air conditioners produce a lot of gray water. Our method is to use the waste water, usually referred to as gray water, produced from the condensation of air conditioners found in the home. It will be very useful if we consider using this gray water for our needs in toilet water to save the purified water for other essential use.<br><br>To prove our hypothesis we have made two experiments:<br><br>• The first experiment: counting the amount of water consumed in toilet flushes by 30 persons in 4 days.<br><br>• The second experiment: Counting the amount of gray water released from 4 air conditions. <br><br>We have noticed after observing our first experiment that the total water consumption of five persons a day for a toilet flush is 149 liters.<br><br>From the second experiment we detected that using 4 air conditions for 18 hours in a 21degrees centigrade per A.C., the amount of water originating from all four air conditions is 118 liters. In other words, an air condition produces 29.5 liters when working in the exact period and circumstances.<br><br>We have concluded that the amount of gray water from air conditions cannot replace all the need of toilet flush but it can minimize it up to 78.9%.

RECYCLING USED COOKING OIL FOR THE PRODUCTION OF HYDROXY FATTY ACIDS BY MICROBIAL CONVERSION
Sunyoung Hwang, Eric Young-Oh Jang, One Park
Korean Minjok Leadership Academy, Gangwon, Gwangwon, SOUTH KOREA

Used cooking oil is one of the most hazardous pollutants. It is imperative that used oil is properly recycled. Currently however, there are only few limited and inefficient ways to recycle used oil,. In the sutdy, we suggest a new method: recycling used cooking oil as a substrate to produce hydroxy fatty acids. <br><br>Hydroxy fatty acids, derived from of fatty acids that carry hydroxyl group, are valuable resources that have wide range of industrial applicaion. They have gained attnentions due to their special properties such as higher viscosity and reactivity compared to other non-hydroxy fatty acids. The bacterial isolate Pseudomonas aeruginosa PR3 had been reported to produce 7, 10-dihydroxy-8(E)-octadecenoic acid (DOD), a kind of HFA that has two hydroxyl groups, with a high yield from oleic acid and triolein. <br><br>In this study, several waste cooking oils were collected and added to the 24 hr-old seed culture of P. Aeruginosa PR3 followed by an additional 72 hr-incubation for bioconversion. The product extracted from culture medium was analyzed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Results confirmed that used bread-baking oil can be utilized as an effective substrate for DOD production. In addition, the antibacterial activity of DOD suggested its possible use as an antimicrobial agent in various industrial fields. Although the process for bioconversion needs to be further optimized, this study is meaningful and significant in that it suggests a whole new concept of recycling used cooking oil to produce HFAs, valuable materials.

duPont Manual High School, Louisville, KY

Although countries across the world strive to become more energy efficient, there are still major areas of inefficiency that negatively affect energy consumption totals. In particular, the use of ineffective and inefficient thermostats, which alone account for 33% of the total energy consumption in the United States The hypothesis of the project was that implementation of a web-enabled thermostat that utilizes multiple web services will maximize energy efficiency because of its ability to forecast both temperature and scheduling changes within a location. The purpose of the project was to develop a web-enabled thermostat, with the goal that energy consumption will be reduced.<br><br> The National Digital Forecast Database XML Web Service and the Web Scheduler were both accessed using the SOAP Protocol, and integrated with the programmable thermostat. The NDFD XML Web Service allows the web enabled thermostat to forecast hourly temperature fluctuations, thus utilizing the natural heating and cooling of nature. Web Scheduler, a second Web Service, gives the web-enabled thermostat a second dimension; as the thermostat could be turned off during scheduled periods of absences. The results confirmed the hypothesis, as implementation of a web enabled thermostat in a given location decreased energy consumption by an average of 31%. This approach of a web-enabled thermostat that utilizes multiple web services, the SOAP Protocol, the Internet, and a programmable thermostat is potentially ground breaking, as rising worldwide energy consumption has become an increasingly relevant topic in today’s world.

BIOCHAR: A VIABLE METHOD FOR SOIL IMPROVEMENT, WATER CONSERVATION, AND CARBON SEQUESTRATION
Vivek G Vishwanath, Brian Lance Hie, 
Scripps Ranch High School, San Diego, CA

The objective of this experiment was to determine the effect of biochar additives on plant growth, soil water retention, soil bulk density, and soil pH when mixed in varying concentrations. For the purposes of this trial, two forms of biochar were tested: oak charcoal, made from oak wood, and bone charcoal, made from cattle bone. Twelve experimental groups and two control groups were tested over a period of six weeks. The control group contained only nutrient poor sandy loam. The experimental groups consisted of charcoal mixed thoroughly into the soil in amounts of 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% by mass. Nine sugar pea plants were planted and measured for height and leaves over six-week trial periods. The plants were assessed for health by a biomass test. The soils were then analyzed for bulk density, water retention capability, and pH. These tests served as quantitative measures of soil improvement. Overall, a definitive pattern of plant growth emerged that correlated to the amount of charcoal in the soil. Plants grown in soils with charcoal grew at times 90% better than the plants grown in the control soil. Soils with higher concentrations of bone charcoal did not allow plants to germinate, however. On average, plants in the 25%, 50%, and 75% oak charcoal soils grew faster and larger. In the bone charcoal group, plants in the 5% and 10% soils were the fastest growing. Charcoal also proved to increase water retention capacity by 95% in 75% charcoal mixtures, also improving pH levels and reducing bulk density. The results indicate that charcoal had a profound impact on soil improvement. It can be concluded that biochar additives, in large-scale implementation, can potentially improve plant growth while using less water and sequestering carbon.

Fume from cooking processes are a major source of organic compounds in atmosphere. The contribution of fume to organic compounds in atmospheric aerosols (or suspended particulates) has been estimated to be as high as vehicular emissions in residential area and business region. Atmospheric aerosols are considered to be the number one air pollution problem in Hong Kong. In addition, cooking fume and the associated odors are nuisances to cooks as well as to the general public. In kitchen exhaust, the fatty acid (the major component of cooking fumes) concentration is high and the collected samples have been found to be toxic in laboratory tests. Thus, cooking exhaust is an important air pollutant as well as a potential hazard to public’s health. <br><br>The effective removal of cooking fume and odors become a major concern all over the world. It can be separated in a three-step process. <br><br>i) An efficient capture method is needed to reduce indoor pollution. <br><br>ii) The fume collected must be removed as much as possible. <br><br>iii) A cleanup system is needed to remove the remnant fume, and more importantly, the odors before the cleaned exhaust can be safely discharged into the atmosphere. <br><br>Equally important is that the system must be in standby mode at all times since cooking processes are intermittent by nature. The amount of energy and attention required to operate the system must therefore be minimized for the system to be effective.<br><br>In this project, a powerful laminar-flow capture hood using an impaction condensation/filtration technology is used to meet the first two requirements. A combination of volatile organic compound-selective absorption/desorption and high temperature thermal destruction is used to remove the odors and the remaining fume.

THE BIOREMEDIATION OF ATRAZINE USING P. PUTIDA
Christopher Scott Jarvis, Daniel Lukason, 
Hopkinton High School, Hopkinton, MA

Atrazine is the most widely used herbicide in the US, with over 76 million pounds applied annually to crops. In nearly every state in the US, atrazine has been detected above the human health benchmark (3micrograms/L) in one or more streams, with the highest concentration of Atrazine use and subsequent pollution in the corn belt region. The presence of Atrazine in aquatic ecosystems can affect the health of humans and aquatic organisms. It has been found to be an endocrine disruptor, which can cause reproductive deformities in marine animals and has also been linked to some types of cancers and kidney failure in humans. <br><br> The purpose of this research was to determine if a bacterial species, Pseudomonas putida, could bioremediate Atrazine and test its efficiency in this process. Pseudomonas putida, through the process of bioremediation converts Atrazine into its harmless mineralized form, carbon dioxide and ammonia. In this experiment, P. putida was cultured to an absorbance of 0.845 at 600nm and was added to varying concentrations (32ppm, 24ppm, 16ppm, 8ppm) of Atrazine in broth. Atrazine degradation can be extrapolated from the production of ammonia. After degradation, P. putida uses the ammonia as a nitrogen source. The resulting ammonia levels with varying Atrazine concentrations, after approximately 22 days, returned to and maintained the same levels as the controls, indicating that the Atrazine was successfully degraded at all tested concentrations with a clear dose response. Results indicate that indicate that P. putida could potentially be used to bioremediate Atrazine in aquatic environments.

WASTE MANAGEMENT FOR CATTLE FEEDLOTS: ENGINEERING A SYSTEM FOR THE ECO-FRIENDLY TREATMENT OF FEEDLOT WASTE
Jacqueline Rae Stergar-Elliott, Ellen Hyams, 
Billings Central Catholic High School, Billings, MT

Montana raises 2,500,000 cattle yearly. Most of these cattle are fed antibiotics to promote growth. Widespread contamination of water and fields with unmetabolized antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant bacteria results when feedlot manure sits, and when it is spread over fields. The goal of our study was to design an eco-friendly waste management strategy for feedlots that will result in inactivation of antibiotic and kill potentially harmful bacteria, while allowing utilization of the resource. We experimented with two different methods to inactivate antibiotic (tetracycline) and bacteria (E.coli) by running tests on “manure” comprised of potting soil, utilizing microbial bioassays to test the efficacy of the process. The first approach utilized a UV-C germicidal lamp, and was effective at killing E. coli, but had no apparent effect on tetracycline. The second approach, biocharrring, consisted of burning the "manure" in a low oxygen environment, creating biochar. Complete inactivation of tetracycline, eradication of viable E. coli, and a biomass reduction of 36 % resulted when "manure" was biocharred. Our results indicate that biocharring could be an effective method for the management of cattle feedlot waste. Inactivation of antibiotic, killing of bacteria, and decrease in the biomass of waste are all properties key to eliminating environmental hazards. Additional benefits include generation of resources for biofuel production, and a soil additive that is easier and safer to spread on fields than manure.

IDENTIFYING THE EFFECTS OF LOCALLY GROWN PLANTS ON MEALWORM WEIGHT AND MORTALITY
Ilora Danne Nola Mendoza, Rizzaly A. Agustin, Michelle P. Tagapuen
Waipahu High School, Waipahu, HI

Identifying the effects of locally grown plants on mealworm mortality and weight change may result in a weight enhancement and/or organic pesticide. Mealworm consuming nutritional plants such as ginger, moringa, and papayas showed no statistical significance by conducting student t-test compared to the control, which is the regular diet of mealworms (grains and flakes.) Polymerase Chain Reaction procedure was conducted in order to identify whether the papayas are genetically modified organism or non-genetically modified organism. According to the collected data as each group of mealworms are weighed every consecutive day, the mealworm weight consuming these plants decreased and their mortality increased. Noni, however, showed statistical significance with its difference compared to the control. As shown on the graph, a drastic decrease in weight and an increase on death rate was determined. Therefore, we propose that noni plant may contain a chemical which may be used as an element to create an organic pesticide, a pesticide that will not contribute to pollution and harm the environment, hence, promoting environmental sustainability. Future field experiments may be conducted by testing the noni plant. The juice may be sprayed on the plant that is infested by pests, or create dried noni fruit to be placed on the food stock such as flour where mealworms are pest of.

WHAT IS THE OPTIMUM ENVIRONMENT FOR FUNGUS GROWTH IN VINASSE FROM SUGAR CANE MOLASSES FOR A POTENTIAL FISH AND ANIMAL FEED INGREDIENT?
Sarah Mieko Tamashiro, Lindsay Fujimoto, 
Saint Andrew's Priory School, Honolulu, HI

In this project, we wanted to find the optimum environment for fungus growth in vinasse from sugar cane molasses for a potential fish and animal feed ingredient. Vinasse is sugar companies cannot throw waste product from the production of molasses that sugar that away without losing profit. Vinasse also has a nutrient content and thus cannot be thrown away safely without potentially harming the environment. We took the beneficial qualities that vinasse has and used it as a growing medium for fungi which the sugar companies could possibly sell as a fish feed ingredient and also allow for safe dumping of the vinasse after use. The fungi that we used are edible and grow approximately for three days before harvesting. Our goal in this project was to find the best condition to grow the fungi to optimize the growth. We tested four different conditions in triplicates- vinasse concentration, autoclaving (sterilization of the vinasse), pH acidity levels, and nutrient supplements of nitrogen and phosphorous- and found that the optimal growth condition for our fungi to grow in the vinasse was at a concentration of 25% with a pH of 5 without autoclaving and with the nutritional supplements of nitrogen and phosphorous. After doing statistical analysis on our data we can conclude that these results will occur again in the future with a 95% and greater confidence level. With information we will be able to produce greater amounts of our fungal biomass and test be able to test it on fish and other animals and possibly humans. This project will create more profit for sugar cane companies, while also making vinasse dumping eco-friendly and possibly solving the world’s malnutrition problems.

According to the IPCC (International Panel on Climate Change) report of 2008 "There is high confidence that neither adaptation nor mitigation alone can avoid all climate change impacts; however, they can complement each other and together can reduce the risk of climate change"<br><br>The report mentioned key mitigation technologies and practices in the field of Energy Supply: "Improved supply and distribution efficiency; fuel switching from coal to gas; …"<br><br>The aim of this project is to increase the rate of environmental friendly biogas fuel production from anaerobic digestion of human and cow feces. This is in an effort to overcome the global decline in Non-renewable fuel; oil and natural gas and substitute the usage of fossil fuels (that emit large quantities of greenhouse gases). Experiments were conducted using simple equipments in order to satisfy the economical issues.<br><br>Three experiments were running: human feces, cow manure and a mixture of both. Each experiment was replicated into both small and large scale. Those primary experiments proved that the mixture specimen was the most efficient. Applying the optimum conditions (temperature and pH) on the best specimen is the next step.<br><br>So far, results proved the presence of ethane gas rather than methane. Although all references mentioned methane and that ethane produces more energy than methane this may be the key to produce highly efficient renewable bio-gas.

BIOLOGICAL TREATMENT OF CAPTURED CARBON DIOXDE
Sarah Mostafa Al Shaarawy, Yousr Mostafa Al Shaarawy, 
Alexandria House of English, Alexandria

This research idea presents an eco-friendly method of handling captured wastes of carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. This idea hypothesized that it is possible to make an ecological benefit from these emissions by transforming them into a functional industrial product, as an alternative to storing it. Carbonic Anhydrase enzyme was identified and used as a suitable biocatalyst. Different experiments were carried out to evaluate the hypothesis. These experiments are intended to test for the accelerating effect of the enzyme in the reaction. The optimum conditions which the enzyme works best regarding temperature, pH optimum and limiting value, as well the concentration on the reaction rate. The experiments were repeated several times. A control experiment was done in the absence of the enzyme. Main results showed that the optimum temperature of the enzyme activity is 40 ̊C, optimum pH is about 7 and limiting pH is about 4. The results also proved that the rate of reaction is directly proportional to the enzyme concentration. Hence, if the previous suggestion is to be studied and concidered to be applied on large scale as in power plants, where the emission of carbon dioxide is usually common (29.5% of total carbon dioxide), This method of handling captured CO2 could be an effective option in the portfolio of mitigation actions for stabilization of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.

THE EFFECT OF ECOLOGICAL ROOFS IN REDUCING WATER RUNOFF AND TEMPERATURE AS COMPARED TO REGULAR IN CONCRETE ROOFS
Amanda Kristel Hernandez-Lopez, Yamira Rentas Vázquez, 
University Gardens High School, San Juan, PUERTO RICO

In recent decades, architects, builders and urban planners worldwide have started to use green roofs not for their beauty, but for their practicality and ability to mitigate the environmental extremes that exist with conventional roofs. The benefits of these roofs are capturing rainwater, reducing runoff water that goes into public water systems, reducing temperatures in the city and inside the residence. The hypothesis was that the ecological roof reduces water runoff and temperature as compared to the regular concrete roof. To do this research, two roof models were built. The first roof model was an ordinary concrete roof and the second roof model was the ecological roof. The ecological roof was prepared using different layers of materials as part of the research, 4. 546 L of water were evenly poured on each of the roof models. The amount of runoff water from each roof model was measured. The temperature was also measured in each model during the morning and evening. The hypothesis of this research was corroborated since the ecological roof significantly reduced runoff water, and temperature decreased from five to fifteen degrees. A future investigation might be to study the cost effectiveness that green roofs have in reducing electricity consumption.

Francisco Oller, Catano, PUERTO RICO

Wind energy is kinetic energy from wind currents generated by the effect of air. It can be transformed into other useful forms for human activities. The purpose of this research is to investigate whether it is feasible to use wind energy to offset part of the fossil energy consumption for the Francisco Oller High School in Cataño. <br><br>Data was collected on wind intensity and temperature using a Pocket Weather Meter; every two hours during eight days. The measurements were done from the school roof, at 6.096 m and 12.19 m in height. Variations in the intensity of the wind were studied to predict the production of electricity, according to the specifications of the turbine (Air Breeze Land). The following averages were obtained: at a height of 6.096 m during the first week were 0.014 kW and 0.017 kW during the second week. In the second week the energy production at 12.19 m in height was 0.020 kW. Based on the data it is predicted that the wind strength should increase at a rate of 0.13 mph for every meter of height. Therefore at 50 m height the wind intensity should be 6.50 mph which should produce 15.03 MW/h/month. <br><br>This study evidenced that this wind turbine would produce 0.35% of the total school electricity consumption (6.08 MW/h/month). Therefore it would be possible to have a wind farm at school.

SOIL AMENDMENT VARIATIONS: THEIR ROLE IN IMPROVING SURFACE MINE RECLAMATION
Travis Cole Sylvester
Greybull High School, Greybull, WY

The process of surface mining is a three step process; permitting, mining, and reclaiming. Of these three, reclaiming might be the most difficult step. Every step of the process, before and after active mining, is scrutinized by state and federal agencies, including the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) and, in some cases also the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). This has been the case since 1977 when the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act was passed by congress. This law requires that all disturbed land be brought back to its original quality and to a condition similar to that of its surroundings. <br><br> Tests were performed for water retention, water penetration, soil chemistry, and cooperative field tests. With these tests, soil samples were collected, amended and then tested. All tests were performed using a standard set of protocols.<br><br> The results of these tests showed that soil amendments increase the ability for plants to germinate. The ability for water retention and penetration in disturbed soils was dramatically increased. The chemical tests made it apparent that the soil amendments did alter the chemistry of the soil. The field tests after one growing season showed that soil amendments can be implemented into real world reclamation techniques. It also showed the ability to stop soil erosion and to increase plant growth. This research has shown that soil amendments are a very cost effective solution to reclaiming vital range land.<br><br> In an effort to continue this research, a grant application has been filed with the Big Horn Basin Sage Grouse Conservation Fund. In addition, funds are being sought to reclaim abandoned mine land property on BLM land in NW Wyoming.

APPLICATION OF HYDROTHERMAL MESOPHILES AS A CONTROL FOR OIL CONTAMINATION
Jessica Fay Hunt
Greybull High School, Greybull, WY

In a typical year, 1.3 million gallons of petroleum are spilled into US waters. This experimentation investigates utilizing unique bacterial species as a catalyst to break down oil. The bacteria included mesophilic species collected from geothermal springs, Pseudomonas flourescens, Pseudomonas putida and Azotobacter vinelandii. Each type of bacteria was cultured and six saturated oil absorbancy materials were added to the cultures for analysis. Cultures were allowed to grow at optimal temperatures for a period of 16 days, with initial measurements taking place after 2 days. Completed cultures were analyzed using spectophotometry. After two days, the average mesophilic transmission was 30.8%, compared to Azotobacter vinelandii (59.1%), Pseudomonas putida (34.7%), and Pseudomonas flourescens (58.06%). Spectrophotometric readings after sixteen days produced mesophilic bacterial transmission of 28.88%. Azotobacter vinelandii produced a transmission of 52.01% compared to a value of 42.4% in Pseudomonas putida and 38.78% in Pseudomonas flourescens.<br><br>Based on analysis of experimentation, geothermal mesophiles seem to be highly effective in the bioremediation of oil. Quantitative results provided by the spectrophotometer show that after two days and sixteen days, mesophilic bacteria held the lowest percentage of transmission in the spectrophotometer. This means these cultures experienced more growth and breakdown, the by-products of which would block more light. Qualitative observations also determined that there was oil residues in all vials introduced to bacteria. After a period of two days, disturbances in natural oil characteristics were noted. Further experimentation will be done at the University of Wyoming using solid phase micro extraction techniques to determine compounds being created through the breakdown process of each bacteria type. The presence of methane gas could indicate the use of these bacteria for energy production as well as environmental remediation.

DEVELOPING ALTERNATIVE BORROW CAPPING TREATMENTS FOR REINFORCING MISSISSIPPI EMBANKMENTS VIA DREDGING, YEAR TWO
Alaina Brooke Leggette
St. Joseph's Academy, Baton Rouge, LA

The purpose of this two year study was to develop three borrow sources to serve as capping treatments for reinforcing levees in the Plaquemines Parish which are in need of 14 million cubic yards of suitable clay material. Year 2 focused on determining the feasibility of using dredged material from the Mississippi River and the Bayou Lafourche Canal as a borrow source to repair levee damages. The ability to grow vegetation is the most efficient way to test if a borrow source is feasible for levee soil. Levee construction was simulated by capping Plaquemines Parish levee soil with dredged material from the Bayou Lafourche Canal and Mississippi River. Bermuda grass was grown in trial pods for a 10 week period. Soil analysis results indicated that the Plaquemines Parish soil exceeds the optimal norm for Chlorides, Salts, SAR, Sodium, and Conductivity, thus explaining why grasses died and the levees subsided. The dredged Mississippi River soil parameters were within the optimal range indicating that it can support the growth of vegetation. The dredged Bayou Lafourche soil had a high salts reading, but all other parameters were within the optimal range for growing grasses. The Plaquemines Parish soil capped with the dredged Bayou Lafourche soil and Mississippi River soil covered 85% and 80% respectively of the trial pod area, indicating successful growth of grasses. Weekly height measurements show development and growth of grasses. It was concluded that both experimental soils can serve as a borrow source for reinforcing the levee systems.

TREE FLAMMABILITY RESEARCH AND APPLICATION
Samuel Lee Bishop-Taylor
Great Lakes College, Tuncurry Senior Campus, Tuncurry, NSW, AUSTRALIA

Climate scientists are predicting bushfires (wildfires) will increase in their frequency and intensity in Australia in coming decades. This increases the risk to houses located in coastal forests. Unfortunately there is no standard way of assessing bushfire risk (BFR) to houses as there is negligible data on the flammability of surrounding vegetation. With a major aim to develop a standardised BFR assessment method, I undertook the following activities:<br><br>• investigated leaf flammability for eight (wet sclerophyll) tree species about houses in my area,<br><br>• mapped the around-house distribution and size of the trees, and<br><br>• developed, calculated and compared a BFR index for each house. <br><br>The leaf flammability investigation used ten replicate leaf samples per species and recorded data on six flammability variables. The species were ranked per variable and the ranks were combined to give a flammability rating. The hypothesis that no difference in flammability existed between species was rejected. Fig trees had low flammability suggesting they could be used as natural bushfire barriers. Palms had high flammability and clearly are a risk when planted close to a house.<br><br>The BFR index combined data on flammability, tree abundance, position and canopy size, and ground slope. The BFR index for my house was high given that many palms are planted very close by. <br><br>The differences in the BFR index between houses mirrored well my previous view of the relative risks from bushfires. This finding supports the use of my BFR index to assess bushfire risk in a standardised manner.

VIABILITY OF BIOREMEDIATION OF LAKE ST. MARYS, OHIO VIA REINTRODUCTION OF NATIVE MUSSELS
Andrew Benedict Favorito
Paulding High School, Paulding, OH

The purpose of this project was to find out if native mussels could be returned to Lake St. Marys, Ohio to help reduce the bluegreen algae problem that has affected the lake for the past two years.<br><br> To complete this project, multiple steps were necessary. First of all, the water chemistry and silt depth of GLSM needed checked and compared to previous data from the ODNR. After testing everything at the Celina Water Treatment Lab in Celina, Ohio, other bodies of water in the geographical region were checked and tested, and compared to those samples from the lake. Each additional body of water was then surveyed for mussels, and the species identified. The water from GLSM was evaluated to identify the species of bluegreen algae causing the algae blooms.<br><br> Before permission would be granted from the ODNR to remove native mussels from area locations, other mussel species were tested. Nine ten gallon tanks and a three hundred gallon tank were set up at the Celina Lab, and Elliptio complanata and Corbicula fluminea were tested. All tested showed a reduction of algae and a significant lowering of Microcystin. The ODNR granted permission to remove Anodonta grandis from a small lake nearby. These mussels were tested and exhibited similar results.<br><br>Microcystin before: 25 ppb After: Non-detect<br><br>Turbidity before: 69 NTU After: 2.2 NTU<br><br> The mussel testing was done over a ten week period, and the entire project took sixteen weeks. The data provided for results is a small portion of the data collected.<br><br> The hypothesis was that the mussels would reduce the turbidity and most importantly the Microcystin. The hypothesis was accepted as the data clearly indicated that the mussels would clear the water, reduce Microcystin, and would remain healthy in the lake.

HEAVY METAL BIOREMEDIATION: A SECOND YEAR STUDY OF TAR CREEK
Paige Hunter Parrack
Southmoore High School, Moore, OK

This project studied the effects of plants, fungus, nutrients, and bacteria on heavy metal concentrations, to facilitate phytoremediation, bioaugmentation, and biostimulation. Bioremediation could be an environmental friendly way to decrease the abnormal metal quantities. Four plant types were tested: brown mustard, pumpkin, sunflower, and burgundy amaranths; these plants were grown in 20 separate soil types with four pots per soil type. Soil samples were collected at 8 weeks and digested to study the metal concentrations of lead, cadmium, and zinc; this soil is from Tar Creek, a superfund site in Northern Oklahoma, which was evacuated due to the high contamination levels. The plants were separated by roots and remaining biomass and then digested. The soil, root, and plant digestions were tested for parts per million with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The second part objective was to determine if bioaugmentation and biostimulation processes revealed effects on phytoremediation. The study showed that bioremediation was a productive resource to cleansing the contaminated soil, and the bacteria Azotobacter Chroococcum and the fungus Glomus Claedonium revealed the process of bioaugmentation as a means to increase withdrawal. The pumpkin showed the most substantial results in collecting zinc, with an original contaminated soil level starting at 513.1 ppm and the average final results less than 300 ppm. The amaranths show the greatest uptake of lead, with an original lead level starting at 60 ppm; the final levels were around 20 ppm. All the techniques present a reasonable solution to an increasing problem of contamination across the globe.

CLEAN ACRES: SIMULATED IN SITU BIOREMEDIATION OF DIESEL CONTAMINATED SOIL UTILIZING A LINOLEIC ACID AND R. RHODOCHROUS ON SOIL TYPE IN AND UNCONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT
Morgan Walker Sinko
John Jay Science and Engineering Academy, San Antonio, TX

PAH are a group of hundreds of semi-volatile organic compounds that are the result of the incomplete combustion of carbon-based substances, most notably diesel, gasoline, and coal. PAH are highly carcinogenic, and can lead to kidney failure, internal hemorrhaging, and death. The basis of the experiment was to determine whether soil types and an uncontrolled environment would affect the productivity of a Linoleic acid/R. rhodochrous bioremediation agent mixture engineered in 2009 by the student researcher.<br><br> Ten tanks, each two containing one of 5 different soil types, were spiked with diesel fuel. One of each soil type was introduced to the Linoleic Acid/R. rhodochrous mixture. Three samples were taken from each tank every 7 days. Each of the three samples was homogenized, prepared, and then analyzed through a gas-chromatograph-mass-spectrometer using standard EPA Method 8207C. <br><br> Although originally targeting PAH specifically, the bioremediation mixture in reality converts the entirety of diesel fuel into water as well as environmentally friendly methyl esters, the main ingredient of bio-fuel. The overall diesel concentration decreased by an average decrease of 29.45%. The most efficient soil was the sand, with an overall remediation of 53%. Future studies using pure controlled compounds, and re-inoculating the soil at set intervals, as well as simulated oil spill cleanup using the agents are also being investigated. These results show that the R. rhodochrous / linoleic acid mixture has the capability to help construct a sustainable planet in a fossil fuel dominated world.

ELECTROCHEMICAL REMEDIATION OF ACID MINE DRAINAGE: A DYNAMIC STUDY
Luke Steven Andraka
North County High School, Glen Burnie, MD

This science fair project studies the possibility of mitigating a continuous flow of acid mine drainage (AMD) by using electrochemical treatment to raise the pH and lower the conductivity of the AMD. This is the first dynamic study of the remediation of AMD using electrolysis. Electrolysis has previously been shown to raise the pH of AMD but it was in a static condition within an isolated electrolysis cell. AMD is runoff from abandoned mines, which is very acidic and contains toxic metals such as manganese and iron. These heavy metals cause the high conductivity in the AMD. The acidity is caused by the abundance of free hydrogen ions. Electrons can be added to the free hydrogen ions, creating hydrogen gas, removing them from solution and raising the pH. Raising the pH of the AMD will also precipitate metals out of the solution that can be harvested. thus removing them from being an environmental pollutant. If the pH can be neutralized and the conductivity lowered in a dynamic flow-through electrolysis cell then this would be evidence that flowing streams polluted with AMD could be treated using electrolysis within a settling basin. The experiment examined various flow rates through the cell along with variations in the cell size, voltage applied and cathode plate placement. The experiment showed that a relation can be drawn between the variables examined such that an optimum electrolysis cell could be designed based upon the anticipated flow rates.

Kern Khanna
University School of Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI

The objective of my study was to test the efficiency of several petrophilic microbes with the addition of inorganic nutrients in terms of the dissolved oxygen concentration and the oil degradation percentage. In this experiment, I tested the effectiveness of a microbe through two key elements: dissolved oxygen concentration and oil degradation. This bioremediation project was conducted using three important microorganisms: Aspergillus niger, Pseudomonas putida, Penicillium chrysogenum. <br><br>In my first test, I set up “ocean samples” in 100 mL. graduated cylinders with 50 mL of tap water (25 C), 10 mL. of crude oil, and 10 mL. of specified inorganic nutrients (namely urea, ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, potassium phosphate, sodium phosphate) with my three different microorganisms. Each sample featured a new inorganic nutrient and microorganism combination. The samples were monitored for 36 hours through a dissolved oxygen probe as the oxygen concentration was recorded. Then, I calculated the oil degradation using a gas chromatograph. I repeated this process at five different water temperatures for three trials. In my second test, I measured the hydrocarbon degradation rates for my three microorganisms. To do this, I found the degradation using a gas chromatograph after a certain amount of set hours at a 25 C water temperature.<br><br>Lastly, my results supported the hypothesis. The ammonium sulfate did degrade the crude oil effectively and prevented hypoxia from occurring. This inorganic nutrient performed efficiently with the Aspergillus niger strain, as there was a small DO concentration decrease relative to other microbes (highest k-value). From my findings, I determined that A. niger with ammonium sulfate is the most effective way to degrade oil and prevent oxygen loss; this strain also yielded the greatest degradation rate than the other microbes.

SUSTAINABLE USAGE OF BURITI (MAURITIA FLEXUOSA): AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF RURAL COMMUNITIES OF THE WESTERN MARANHAO
Emily Ferreira Soares
Edison Lobao Educacion Center, Imperatirz, Maranhao, BRASIL

This research aimed to contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of native forests by encouraging the development of the moriche (Mauritia flexuosa) productive chain. I assessed the economic potential of the extraction, in order to offer subsidy through activities that people could understand the sustainable management of moriche’ forests. To better use the fruit, I initiated the activities with workshops to teach hygiene, like washing the fruit with no loss of peel and pith, pulp extraction, production of the juice and oil extraction. In this regard, 100% of the residents in the community of Serra Quebrada joined the activities, thus contributing to the achievement of the project. I did some chemical analysis that revealed that moriche pulp has an average of 62.93% moisture, 8.25% of total carbohydrates, 7% iron, and 5.17% of this fraction of dietary fiber. The products removed from the pulp, flax and petiole have a high nutritional pand handicraft potential that can contribute to the good regional development due to social, economic, cultural, environmental and political aspects. The products derived from moriche pulp are rich in nutrients, which can be used to feed children, thus solving the problems of hunger and malnutrition, not only in Brazil, but also in countries where the moriche palm tree can be found (Peru, Venezuela, Ecuador, Suriname, Guyana). This project could be applied in areas that have palm trees with the same morphological, ecological and phonological characteristics.<br><br><br>Keywords: Usage – Sustainability - Development

CRUSHING MATTERS: UTILIZING LANDFILL WASTE MATERIALS TO STRENGTHEN CONCRETE
Daniel Seguro Samora
Alamogordo Senior High School, Alamogordo, NM

The purpose of this project is to find out if landfill waste materials added to concrete will improve its strength. Would it be possible to save the environment by using landfill waste materials to strengthen concrete? <br><br> <br><br>I think landfill waste materials added to concrete will improve its strength. Materials like diamond wire will hold concrete together better, making it stronger. Combinations of different materials will further improve the concrete’s strength.<br><br>I built a 4”x 6”x 1” wood form. Then, added pieces of tire rubber, plastics, pebbles, chicken wire, screen wire, diamond wire, dry grass, and grass from air-conditioning pads to the cement to make blocks containing the different materials. I built a mechanism for testing the strength of the blocks. I tested each block, by dropping the same amount of weight, from the same height, onto each block, to see which block held together better. <br><br>The block containing the diamond wire proved stronger. It took more drops of the weight to completely demolish it. I then combined the two most problematic landfill waste materials (rubber tires and plastics) with the diamond wire block. The diamond wire combined with plastic had no change, while diamond wire with rubber consistently withstood additional drops of the weight.<br><br>I learned that the diamond wire helped the concrete block hold together better, and that rubber aggregate added to concrete containing wire mesh further improved the strength. Not only did I find a way to strengthen concrete, but also a useful purpose for discarded rubber tires.<br><br>Further tests could include testing the effectiveness of vibration nullification.

THE IMPACT OF ANTHROPOGENICALLY MODIFIED WETLANDS ON ANURAN POPULATIONS: WHAT DO SPECIES RICHNESS, DIVERSITY, AND PRESENCE OF INVASIVE SPECIES TELL US ABOUT EVERGLADES WETLANDS RESTORATION?
Jamie Odzer
Dr. Michael M. Krop Senior High School, Miami, FL

The Everglades is the largest sawgrass prairie in the world. Few places have such diverse wildlife. As a result of its unique characteristics, the Everglades has been the focus of major restoration efforts, mostly to reverse bad effects caused by development and agriculture, and by the introduction of invasive species. Restoring once-native wetland areas and creating new urban wetland areas is part of the effort. <br><br> Anurans play a key role in these ecosystems. They are important in the food web as both predator and prey, and respond measurably to environmental changes, which make them excellent indicators of wetlands health. <br><br> The purpose of this study was to investigate whether anthropogenically modified wetlands affect anuran species abundance and diversity. Using visual/acoustic surveys, anuran species richness in a natural wetland was compared to recreated and fully-engineered wetlands. The presence of invasive species were documented. Data were compiled and analyzed. <br><br> The results supported the hypothesis that there would be greater anuran species richness, and a greater proportion of native anuran species, in natural wetlands when compared to wetlands which have been engineered or modified. This suggests that modified wetlands do not create the same ecological conditions as native wetlands. This needs to be considered when managing these areas, in an effort to eliminate highly detrimental invasive species and encourage the growth and abundance of native fauna. These results also show that continued monitoring of anuran populations in both natural and modified wetlands will be important in determining whether costly restoration efforts are ultimately successful.

THE EFFECT OF SELECTED PLANT EXTRACTS ON THE VITALITY OF TERMITES
Mahkia Lynn Clark
North Toole County High School, Sunburst, MT

The purpose of this experiment was to determine if selected plant extracts. (Spotted knapweed, Canadian thistle, Kochia, Yarrow, and Lupine) could act as natural pesticides towards termites. I hypothesized that selected plant extracts would have a detrimental effect on the vitality of the termites because these plants have been shown to exhibit allelopathic and antiseptic qualities. To test my hypothesis, I made culture dishes with 10.0 g of sawdust in them (5 dishes per group; the groups were control (water) and extracts of the different plants. I added 10 mL of liquid (depending on which group I was testing) to the sawdust, placed 5 termites in each dish, and allowed the termites to consume the sawdust for seven days. I recorded the weight of the dishes after the termites had consumed the sawdust for a week. I also tested mortality rate of the termites when they were directly exposed to water and each extract group. I recorded qualitative observations in addition to quantitative data. I then conducted t-tests from my quantitative data. The only tests that were statistically significant were the Canadian Thistle when compared with Yarrow and with Kochia, when Spotted Knapweed and Canadian Thistle were compared with Kochia and Yarrow, and when Lupine was compared with Yarrow, and every group versus Control except Kochia. Based on this information, I concluded Spotted Knapweed, Canadian Thistle, and Lupine significantly decreased the amount of wood that the termites consumed and could therefore be used as a natural pesticide.

DETERMINING THE STARCH CONTENT OF LEMNA MINOR IN RELATION TO NITRATE AND PHOSPHATE LEVELS, YEAR 2
Kristen Elaine Clayton
Viera High School, Viera, FL

The purpose of this project was to determine the total nitrogen and phosphate levels that the aquatic plant Lemna minor could produce its maximum starch content for ethanol.<br><br> It was hypothesized that Lemna minor would produce its maximum starch content at 20 ppm total nitrogen and 1.2 ppm phosphate. This hypothesis was tested by distinguishing testing groups of original canal water (comparison group) with 26.4 ppm total nitrogen and 1.25 ppm phosphate, low total nitrogen (5 ppm); low phosphate (0.05ppm), medium total nitrogen (10 ppm); medium phosphate (0.2 ppm), high total nitrogen (20 ppm); high phosphate (1.2 ppm), high total nitrogen; low phosphate, low total nitrogen; high phosphate, and control group with deionized water. <br><br> During the testing trials the nutrient uptake was cohesive, but due to nutrient availability they were interpreted differently. The low and medium nutrient groups increased and removed nutrients due to Lemna minor trying to prolong its nutrient supply and establish equilibrium. Their mass was minimal and starch coverage was as low as 27.86 and 15%. High nutrient group showed constant growth rates, nutrient uptake and Lemna minor’s maximum starch content during Trial 1 and 2. The varying nutrient groups’ data was inconsistent. The control group demonstrated that Lemna minor can maintain its starch content for an extended time but a lack of nutrients caused its starch coverage to recede. <br><br> In conclusion, the researcher’s hypothesis was supported. During the trials, Lemna minor achieved its maximum starch content at 20 ppm total nitrogen and 1.2 ppm phosphate.

A COMPARISON OF THE EFFICIENCIES OF ACTIVE RADON GAS MITIGATION SYSTEMS
Rachel A. Hodge
Jasper High School, Plano, TX

Radon gas, or radon-222, is a radioactive gas that reaches unusually high levels in buildings. The U.S. E.P.A. has named radon gas as the second leading cause of lung cancer, and states that it takes the lives of 21,000 people every year in the U.S. Last year's research proved that an active radon gas mitigation system is more effective than a passive one; therefore, this year's research tests active radon gas mitigation systems' efficiencies including closed ventilation (control group), sub-slab depressurization (negative pressure), and basement pressurization (positive pressure). A .25 m³ wooden house model was built, divided into two chambers and given an air conditioning system. A mixture of dipropylene glycol and distilled water was emitted from a fog generator within the box to represent radon gas levels at 4.0 pCi/L or above (the E.P.A.'s "action limit"). Each mitigation system was tested for 60 seconds and filmed. A set of criteria based on observations of air circulation patterns, as well as a Photoshop-based analysis, was applied to screenshots of each trial. Closed ventilation's vapor levels increased steadily throughout each trial, making it least effective method, as the hypothesis stated. However, the hypothesis's statement that sub-slab depressurization and basement pressurization would be equally efficient was incorrect. 100% of sub-slab depressurization trials had visible vapor after 60 seconds, but 100% of basement pressurization removed all vapor by 30 seconds. Therefore, based on this model, basement pressurization was proven to be the most effective active radon gas mitigation system.

NURSERY FOREST: A TEACHING STRATEGY TO INVESTIGATE ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS
Arturo Javier Gonzalez
Escuela Normal Superior Santa Ana de Baranoa, Baranoa, Atlantico, COLOMBIA

This project aims to generate processes of research on environmental issues, from building a tree nursery as a pedagogical strategy, taking into account that deforestation is one of the starting points for all environmental issues that affect the planet.<br><br>Phase One: Advice from SENA (Servicio Nacional de aprendizaje) and Colciencias ONDAS program, review the literature pertinent to the construction of the forest nursery, to the production of organic fertilizers, taxonomy of native BS-T and socio-political nature of the problem.<br><br>Field trips to observe directly the biological processes and interact with farmers, using interviews and surveys to establish the factors that affect the burning and logging. Collection of seeds of native endangered species.<br><br>Second phase: the adequacy of land, installation of the forest nursery, production of organic composting, germination, growth and planting of native species, application of mathematical, biological, educational, social and technological knowledge.<br><br>The construction of the forest nursery allowed the appropriation of research tools necessary to recognize that logging and burning (cultural practices) finish the watersheds and biodiversity; establish that these cultural practices of farmers in the area of Sibarco are due to social factors such as: non-satisfaction of basic needs, lack of education and a development model based on the accumulation of capital.<br><br>The construction of the forest nursery became an educational play area suitable for sensitizing a child from an early age with respect to environmental problems and possible solutions.

OPTIMIZATION OF MICROBIAL BIOREMEDIATION
Adam Brian Schuster
F.W. Springstead High School, Spring Hill, FL

This project investigates how the three main compounds in fertilizers, Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium, can act as a biostimulator to the bacteria Alcanivorax borkumensis to help it to most effectively consume oil from ocean water. The question proposed in this experiment is, “Which composition of the substances Ammonium Sulphate (N), Phosphate (P), and Potassium (K), would best aid the oil-consuming microbes in bioremediation?”. The hypothesis proposed in this experiment is “If different compositions of the elements Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium are tested to determine which is most effective as a biostimulant to the bacteria Alcanivorax borkumensis, then I believe that the mixture with low amounts of all three elements will produce the best outcome because they would all contribute to the proliferation of the bacteria and help it to best remediate oil from ocean water.” The independent variable is the different compositions of the substances Ammonium Sulphate (N), Phosphate (P), and Potassium (K).<br><br> In order to successfully complete the project, a series of procedures was executed. The three elements were measured and distributed into the corresponding sample cups. Ocean water (250 ml) was measured into each cup and then 1 gram of the bacteria Alcanivorax borkumensis was added (excluding control number one). Each sample was closed briefly to be shaken, then left to settle for two days. On the second day, all samples were aerated with the air pump. On the third day, the samples were frozen for 24 hours and then the amount of remaining oil was measured by separation from the frozen water. <br><br> After the completion of the procedures, the data was recorded. The data shows that in general, the samples with higher amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus compared to potassium promoted the greatest oil digestion (samples A2, G2, and E3) as did the samples with low amounts of all three elements (sample D2).<br><br> This experiment is important because it demonstrates on a smaller scale how to best optimize the proliferation of the oil-eating bacteria Alcanivorax borkumensis. This bacteria is naturally present in low quantities in the ocean, but quickly grows to become the dominant population of bacteria at the site of an oil spill. With the use of my research, the output of these oil-eating microbes can be significantly increased with the correct amount of the three growth-promoting elements, thus potentially reducing the impact of an oil spill in the ocean in an

EROSION: GOING, GOING, GONE...
Natalie Adelle Dyjak
Home School, Benson, AZ

The purpose of this project was to determine if increased slope and increased water volume statistically increase soil erosion for a second year, using a newly designed water application system. Furthermore, I sought to determine a statistically significant difference in soil erosion between year 1 and year 2, using a newly designed water application system.<br><br>I hypothesized a positive linear relationship between slope and soil erosion and water volume and soil erosion. I hypothesized highest soil erosion at slope 3, as water volume increased. I hypothesized a statistically significant difference in soil erosion (low and high water volume combined) between year 1 and year 2.<br><br>I used four concrete blocks and an inclined plane (97" x 22.5" x 3.5")to create four slopes. Two vertical uprights provided a 66" distance for the even spacing of three shower heads. I established a 36" distance from the soil to the shower heads. Low water volume= .05 L/ sec. High water volume= .19 L/ sec. I applied water for two minutes (n= 80). The volume of soil eroded equaled the initial soil length minus the remaining soil length times the constant width and depth.<br><br>I proved hypotheses 1 and 2 using the Pearson r correlation coefficient formula. Since the probability of r was <.0001 and the level of significance was set at .05, both slope and soil erosion and water volume and soil erosion had statistical significnce.<br><br>I used a t-test to prove hypothesis 3. I rejected my null hypothesis which stated there was no difference between the means of soil eroded. t= -4.583 with a critical value of 1.746.<br><br>I proved hypothesis 4 using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test. The year 1 test hypothesis mean= 1.596. The year 2 test hypothesis mean= .945. The probability of error was <.05 at 1.593x 10-4.

GOING GREEN
Alfonso Alejandro Gonzalez
Veterans Memorial High School, Brownsville, TX

The biodegradability of a plastic is crucial for saving our environment. I wanted to prove that there are alternative forms of plastic that are biodegradable versus the regular petroleum plastic being used today.<br><br>Homemade plastic and petroleum plastic (grocery plastic bags) were tested. These samples were exposed to equal amounts of heat, soil, ammonia, and Clorox to attempt to degrade both plastics. The amount of consumption and decomposition was accurately weighed before and after the experiment. When buried in soil after two weeks, the homemade plastic decomposed completely, whereas the petroleum plastic had not decomposed at all. When exposed to heat and other harsh chemicals, homemade plastic was affected by an average of 50%, whereas petroleum plastic was not affected at all. My hypothesis stated that homemade plastic would be more biodegradable than regular plastic and I was correct. Homemade plastic degrades the most when compared to petroleum plastic. If I had the opportunity to repeat this experiment, I would probably use different plastic utensils to see how they would react to the tests. Homemade plastic is not expensive to make. If merchants began using biodegradable plastic bags we would not only be saving our planet and the environment, but consumers would not have to worry about carrying their own recyclable bags every time they go to the grocery store.

THE BATTLE BETWEEN SAND AND WIND: WHICH FENCE MAKES A DIFFERENCE?
Sarah Louise Simoneaux
South Terrebonne High School, Bourg, LA

The purpose of my experiment was to identify which type of fence is more effective in preventing sand erosion during storms. My hypothesis was that a fence with wide sticks and small gaps would be more effective than narrower sticks or larger gaps because it would block the wind and stop it from blowing away the sand.<br><br>I made six types of fences using large and small sticks and two different sizes of screen. The sand was placed into a mold to ensure the same profile was used in each experiment. The fence was inserted near the top of the slope. Measurements were taken across and along the ‘beach’. The blower ran for one minute and measurements were retaken. Wind speed was measured and the eroded sand was weighed. Three trials were conducted for the control and each type of fence.<br><br>My data showed that the wide/1 cm gap let the least wind through and was best at preventing the erosion of sand. The small screen allowed about the same amount of sand to erode. The control and the narrow/2 cm gap allowed the most sand to erode. The next largest amount of erosion was the narrow/1 cm gap. The big screen and the wide/2 cm gap allowed about the same amount of sand to erode.<br><br>My hypothesis was correct: the wide sticks with the smaller gaps were more effective because it allowed the least amount of erosion.

THE EFFECT OF E. CRASSIPES ON THE NITRATE AND AMMONIA LEVELS FROM SEWAGE TREATMENT WASTE WATER
Kelly M. Martins
Langley High School, McLean, VA

My project this year was designed to find a cure to the pollution and meet the EPA standards for Blue Plains Waste Water Treatment Facility on the Potomac River through decreasing levels of Nitrogen and Ammonia. I tested Eichhornia Crassipes. I gathered water where the Waste Treatment Center’s ‘treated water’ dumps into the Potomac. I set up two aquariums, one with just Potomac water that I gathered, and the other with the Eichhornia Crassipes as well. I used Artemia Salinia to represent fish, to show the correlation with the ecosystem, through their life cycle and developmental stages. Each week I took samples of the aquarium with just the water (the control) and the aquarium with the E. Crassipes in it. I tested the hatch rate, hatch time, life expectancy, and final growth size of the Artemia throughout the 8 weeks. The average initial hatch rate was 2.7/10, hatch time was 28 hours, life expectancy was 6 days, and final size was .032cm. In two months of being exposed to the plant, the Potomac water Nitrate levels dropped 80% to 8ppm. The Ammonia levels decreased 87% to .1ppm. The Artemia hatch rate went up 67% to 8.2/10, the hatch time improved 20% to 22.3 hours, the life expectancy went up 63% to 16 days, and the final size increased by 76% to .135cm. In just eight weeks, the E. Crassipes had an incredible impact on the polluted water, both improving the ecosystem and the water quality levels.I proved that if these aquatic plants are implemented in waste treatment centers denitrification processes, the water quality will significantly improve and will ultimately improve the ecosystem of entire waterway.

EXTRACTING SILVER HALIDES FROM USED X-RAY FILMS USING NEW TECHNIQUES
Farah Mohammed Refai
Modern Montessori School, Amman, JORDAN

Silver is one of the precious metals that exists as silver halides and dark silver in X ray films therefore recycling it is essential. I decided to carry out my research in the field of extracting silver from used x-ray films using a new technique that does not deplete any metallic resources or energy resources meaning that the project must been environmentally friendly.<br><br>My research consists of two parts, part one which is carrying out experiments to obtain the silver form x-ray films using nitric acid and investigating the concentration of nitric acid and other chemicals needed to extract silver and silver compounds form x-ray films, and the correct procedure to be followed.<br><br>After getting successful results with nitric acid, the second challenging part was to construct experiments on extracting oxides of nitrogen from exhaust unwanted gases which are the result of combustion of fossil fuels in internal engines. My experiments revealed that using urea increases the percentage acidity of the solution prepared from exhaust gases. That solution was tested for its ability to precipitate silver halides and the result was light areas in x ray films produced 5.7% precipitate when using the acidic solution prepared from urea and exhaust gases.<br><br>The last part of my project was to design a model that combines the two parts of my project for the purpose of doing final tests on the extraction of silver. I was able to extract up to 5% of silver halides using my technique.<br><br>One way that helped light my path in overcoming certain problems and leading me to the right components to be used in carrying out my design was designing the several experiments that took place.

BIOBASED FERRITE NANOPARTICLES: A NOVEL APPROACH TO EXTRACT ORGANIC SOLVENTS AND HEAVY METALS FROM WATER
Atreya Shilbhadra Dey
Maharishi School of the Age of Enlightenment, Fairfield, IA

Removal of organic solvents and heavy metals from industrial waste water is challenging. Various types of nanomaterials have been used for water remediation; however, biobased superparamagnetic ferrite nanoparticles have not been tested for this purpose. In this pilot project, ferrite nanoparticles coated with pluronic and a protein cloned from magnetotactic bacteria, Mms6, were used for water remediation. Pluronic is a known extractant for organic solvents because of its bifunctional polymer layer composed of an outer hydrophilic poly (ethylene oxide) region and an inner hydrophobic poly(propylene oxide) region for solubilization of organic compounds and creates nanoparticles (10nm). The Mms6 protein binds to iron forming 40nm amphiphilic nanoparticles with a Fe3O4 core. These micelles display an affinity for a range of insoluble to slightly insoluble compounds. Two nanoparticles used in this experiment are, pluronic and pluronic + Mms6 protein (biobased), where pluronic provides a micelle environment for the growth of the ferrite nanocrystal with the appropriate precursors. The advantage of the biobased nanoparticles is that, 1) the nanoparticle is superparamagnetic which is easier to extract using a magnet, 2) the Mms6 protein and pluronic together create larger mixed micelles (60-70 nm). Three common contaminants of industrial waste water, toluene, 1,2 dichloroethylene and lead acetate were extracted from water using multiple concentrations of the two nanoparticles and measured using a UV Spectrophotometer. The nanoparticles removed 95% of the selected contaminants and the biobased nanoparticles significantly (p<.05) performed better and proved to be more cost effective than the pluronic in removal of the chemicals.

BIG PROBLEM... SMALL SOLUTIONS: A COMPARISON OF BIOAUGMENTATION AND BIOSTIMULATION
Miranda Elizabeth Haslam
The King's Academy, Mohrsville, PA

The purpose of this project was to compare the effectiveness of bioaugmentation versus biostimulation for bioremediation of diesel fuel. A BODTrak™ nutrient buffer pillow, which contained essential nutrients for bacterial growth, was used to stimulate the growth of the native bacteria. A centrifuged culture of purchased bacteria was used to augment the native bacteria. The test media was a mixture of water from Blue Marsh Reservoir and diesel fuel. The biological oxygen demand (BOD) of the samples was measured for ten days. The total diesel remaining in each sample was measured after the tenth day.<br><br> The bioaugmentation samples had higher average BOD and the highest average rate of change in BOD. The bioaugmentation groups also spent the most days at peak performance, on average. The biostimulation group with lower BOD had lower levels of diesel fuel remaining after ten days. The conclusion of the experiment is that the indigenous bacteria are more effective than the added bacteria for removing diesel fuel from water. Biostimulation is more effective than bioaugmentation for bioremediation of diesel fuel.

GREEN ELECTRICITY FROM WASTE, IS IT POSSIBLE?
Tushar Mittal
Dutchtown High School, Hampton, GA

The problem for this experiment is which of the following samples, using a microbial fuel cell, would produce more electricity: H2O accumulated from marsh streams or H2O accumulated from fish tanks? The independent variable in this experiment is the types of wastes used (Mud Water and Water from Fish Tanks). The dependent variable is the amount of voltage, and the control is the deionized water. The main processes that this project relies on are oxidation and reduction. In this experiment, the agar solution in the salt bridge is oxidized by the bacteria, Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, which is found in the waste samples. The hypothesis- if each microbial fuel cell receives the same amount of oxygen from the aquarium air pumps, then the microbial fuel cell with the fish tank water sample will produce the most electricity out of the three microbial fuel cells, is proven correct. Electricity is measured in millivolts and in the experiment, the voltage is measured by placing the leads of the multimeter on the resistors to get accurate data. The fish tank water sample produced the highest voltage level of 14.4mv; mud water also produced a surprising amount of electricity of 11.5mv, and the control is left behind with 9.3mv. This experiment will create a new revolution for the production of electricity, especially in third world countries that are struggling to survive because the variables, such as mud and fish polluted water, are inexpensive and at a high availability, simultaneously decreasing the turbidity in great amounts.

UTILIZATION OF A THERMOPHILIC SULFATE-REDUCING SPECIES FOR BIOREMEDIATION PURPOSES
Kirsten Perry
Elko High School, Elko, NV

A thermophilic sulfate-reducing species located on the microbial mat of a hot spring with a temperature ranging from 70-75 degrees Celsius was examined for its bioremediation abilities in acid mine drainage (AMD). Four potential carbon sources for the sulfate-reducers were examined: lactate, formate, ethanol, and pyruvate. Of the four, samples containing lactate experienced the greatest decrease in sulfate ion concentrations. An additional test was performed to determine the optimal amount of lactate required for maximum sulfate reduction. The maximum level of biological sulfate reduction occurred at a ratio of 0.96mL of lactate per every liter of hot springs water.<br><br>The effects of increasing acidity on biological sulfate reduction were monitored. The thermophilic microorganisms continued to reduce sulfate at a pH of around 4.1; however, little to no reduction occurred below a pH of 4.<br><br>AMD from the Rio Tinto and Big Springs Mines in Elko County, Nevada were added to samples containing the thermophilic sulfate-reducing species. During a 48 hour period, pH rose from 4 to 6 in samples, copper levels dropped by approximately 0.5ppm, and sulfate levels were decreased by >100ppm. <br><br>To identify the sulfate-reducing species, sequences for the likely genera Thermodesulfobacterium and Archaeoglobus were targeted during polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gel electrophoresis. The microbial mat tested negative for either genus; however, it tested positive for the presence of both the archaeal and bacterial domains.

INVESTIGATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INDIGENOUS PLANT SOLUTIONS IN INHIBITING LEAF GALL INSECT DEVELOPMENT
Jorie Ann Moore
Sanger High School, Sanger, CA

The goal of this project is to determine the effectiveness of indigenous plant solutions in inhibiting the development of petiole gall aphids without adverse effects to the environment. Two hundred Cottonwood tree petiole galls were collected. Three indigenous plants were tested: jimson weed, stinging nettle, and tobacco tree. There were two controls: water and one extracted from the Cottonwood tree leaves. The indigenous plants were placed in sealed containers with water and exposed to sunlight at 90+ degrees for seven days. A field test and a controlled lab test were conducted. In the lab test, aphid clusters in petiole galls were used for testing direct kills. The solutions and controls were sprayed on exposed petiole galls containing live aphid clusters. The aphids were observed for detrimental effects immediately afterward. In the field test, trees were sectioned off and the same indigenous solutions were sprayed on undisturbed galls. The results were observed over one day. Results of the controls in the lab and field test were 100% of the aphids alive. The field results in which leaf galls were sprayed shows: stinging nettle- 42% alive, jimson weed- 74% alive, tobacco- 56% alive. The lab results are: stinging nettle- 86% alive, jimson weed- 50% alive, tobacco- 90% alive. Indigenous plants can be used effectively as natural pesticides on aphids in their larvae and adult stage. In my project, I found that certain indigenous plant solutions are an effective method of controlling pests in the environment without compromising the health of the ecosystem.

Global climate change may accelerate biomass decomposition, which in turn could potentially increase CO2 flux to the atmosphere and lead to further global warming. However, the dependence of biomass decomposition on temperature is poorly quantified.<br><br> Leaf litter of sugar maple (SM; Acer saccharum), white oak (WO; Quercus alba), and American beech trees (AB; Fagus grandifolia) was collected, dried, weighed, and placed on soil at 0°, 6°, 12°, and 15°C. Mass loss was determined at six points over a 63-day period. A Li-6400 Carbon Flux Monitor measured CO2 flux. Samples were analyzed using acid hydrolysis to determine proportions of starch, cellulose, and lignin. The specific leaf area was determined for each species.<br><br> SM leaf litter decomposed the fastest, followed by WO and AB. Chemical analysis revealed that the lignin content of AB is 1.5 times that of SM, explaining AB's slower decomposition compared to SM. CO2 fluxes showed a similar pattern of species dependence, with SM releasing the greatest amount of CO2. All samples decomposed faster at higher temperatures, and SM was the most temperature-sensitive. CO2 flux also increased with temperature for all species. By extrapolating these data to all SM in the U.S.A., a 2°C increase in temperature would increase CO2 flux by 1.2 Tg per year. The temperature dependence of decomposition and CO2 flux suggests that an increase in biomass decomposition due to global warming will further increase atmospheric CO2 concentrations in a cycle of positive feedback.

THE BIOLOGICAL THESHOLD LIMIT VALUE OF MALATHION FOR ARTEMIA FRANCISCANA IN CORRELATION WITH ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY OF A KEYSTONE POPULATION IN AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS, PHASE IV
Alexa Anne Lunt
Weber High School, Pleasant View, UT

Utah produces 90% of the world’s supply of brine shrimp from the Great Salt Lake (GSL)<br><br>generating $100 million dollars in economic benefit. Wetland sustainability on a major migratory<br><br>bird flyway is of immeasurable natural value. Prior research indicated that pesticides inhibit the<br><br>viability of all three life stages of brine shrimp. This study identified the Malathion Biological<br><br>Threshold Limit Value (BTLV) of shrimp, applied the BTLV to other macro invertebrates, and<br><br>investigated the phenotypic effects in shrimp upon exposure to Malathion.<br><br>The BTLV for Malathion was established by incrementally decreasing the pesticide concentration in tests on all brine shrimp life stages. Four measures determined biologic effects: time increments,<br><br>survival rate, correlation of incremental concentrations, and phenotypic examination of the tissues<br><br>of brine shrimp.<br><br>Results indicate the BTLV of Malathion for adult brine shrimp is 2 ppm. Phenotypic evidence<br><br>showed Malathion is invasive and destructive to sub-adult shrimp tissue. Data also suggest that<br><br>exposure to lower concentrations of Malathion may have minimal impact on the adult brine shrimp<br><br>population while serving as an abatement agent for undesirable insects such as West Nile carriers<br><br>existing in and around the GSL.<br><br>Conclusions from this work are important because viability of the brine shrimp population in the<br><br>GSL has great economic benefit and preserves the success of a major flyway. This work also<br><br>provides insight on how to successfully balance ecosystem management with pesticide usage.<br><br>Lastly, this work is a model of sustainability insuring survival of a keystone population within an<br><br>aquatic ecosystem.

MAKING A GOOD USE OF A BAD WEED: FROM GARLIC MUSTARD INTO BIOFUEL
Becky Chu
Divine Savior Holy Angels High School, Milwaukee, WI

Because of increasing global awareness about the environment, I wanted to do a project on biofuel. I chose to use Alliaria Petiolata, or Garlic Mustard, because I wanted to turn something that was harming the environment into an environmental asset. <br><br> The purpose of this experiment is to produce hydrocarbons—the ingredients for biofuel—from Garlic Mustard. The amount of hydrocarbons produced over time was compared between two sets of Garlic Mustard decomposed in an anaerobic environment at different temperatures, one set at 21°C (room temperature) and the other at 43°C. Using gas chromatography, the type of hydrocarbon released by the Garlic Mustard plants was determined to be methane gas.<br><br> Unfortunately, because the environment changed from anaerobic into aerobic in the bottle of Garlic Mustard at 43°C, carbon dioxide was produced as a byproduct. Moreover, the results do not indicate that the amount of methane gas produced increases at a higher temperature. Because of a shortage of Garlic Mustard, Spinach, which resembles Garlic Mustard in composition, was substituted in as the organic material. Additionally, more grams of Spinach were packed into the bottle to ensure a more anaerobic environment. The results from the Spinach show that a higher temperature yields more gas, specifically methane gas, and therefore suggests that Garlic Mustard would follow a similar trend. In conclusion, the results show that Garlic Mustard can be used to make biofuel, and that a warmer environment causes Garlic Mustard to produce more gas more quickly. However, further research is recommended.

BIOGAS: AN INVESTIGATION IN ALTERNATIVE ENERGY
Katherine Rose Picchione
Academy of the Holy Names, Albany, NY

Energy in its various forms is an important commodity in today’s world. However, the environmental repercussions of this energy addiction mandate the use of “green” energy before contemporary resources are extinguished. One sustainable energy source is Biogas, the gas produced when organic molecules break down in the absence of oxygen. The main compound in biogas, methane (CH4), is also the principle component of natural gas. Biogas is used worldwide as both a commercial commodity in Europe and as a necessity in third world countries. Small-scale biogas systems are often dangerous, since biogas is flammable. This research aimed to safely generate and compress biogas for later use on a home scale. It culminated in the design and creation of a digester system to produce the biogas, a scrubber system to purify the gas, and a compressor to pump the gas into a storage tank. The digester was made of a 55-gallon drum, which provided an anaerobic environment for the decay of kitchen food waste. The scrubber consisted of a sodium hydroxide solution to remove carbon dioxide from the gas. The compressor was based on the physics of human respiration. The system underwent many modifications. Ultimately, a Bunsen burner was attached to the storage tank and a flame was produced from the biogas within. This proved that the system was functional and could produce viable biogas energy. Future research includes refining the system and using the biogas for a variety of tasks.

A NOVEL APPROACH TO OPTIMAL PARAMETER GROWTH ANALYSIS AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION SYSTEMS FOR GREEN MICROALGA, S. DIMORPHUS
Aakash Indurkhya
North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, Durham, NC

Microalgae, which absorb substantial quantities of CO2 in growth, are effective producers of biodiesel and have received attention as candidates to reduce the effects global warming and reduce international oil dependency. This project aimed to find optimal growth parameter values, specifically for irradiance, for S. dimorphus, a species of microalga with especially high lipid yield. It was expected that the exposure of S. dimorphus to X-ray radiation for controlled periods of time (20 minutes) would increase growth of algae. However, it was also expected that too much (30 minutes) radiation would decrease growth in S. dimorphus due to epigenetic damage to the cells. An optimal bioreactor regulation system was simultaneously designed using the LabVIEW programming language. Absorbance of the visible spectra (395.2 nm) was utilized to measure growth in the algae and could be considered a quick and inexpensive method of measurement. It was found that 20 minutes of radiation yielded more growth from the algae. Algae exposed to radiation were found to have shortened lag phases after inoculation; this phenomenon could be related to growth changes and should be further studied. The designed regulation systems were partially developed using a programmed Arduino microprocessor, temperature and pH sensors, and parameter correction probes. The stand-alone system regulates temperature and pH while displaying current and target parameter values. The combination of more confirmed optimal parameters and the development of this technology will greatly improve growth efficiency and promote use of environmentally friendly biodiesel.

PORTABLE SOLAR HEATED VACUUM DESALINATOR (PVD) FOR DRINKING WATER PRODUCTION
Benedict Manuel Redublo Priela
Holy Infant Academy, Calapan City, Oriental Mindoro, PHILIPPINES

Global water shortage already affects more than 2.8 billion people worldwide and the UN expects the figure to rise from 40% to 66% of the population in 20 years. (Rubino, 2009). Population growth and global warming will further shrink the remaining freshwater resources and greatly worsen the water shortage. <br><br> This study aims to mitigate the drinking water shortage with the use of a portable desalinator that runs on solar energy. At vacuum pressure of 0.1 bar, seawater may start to boil at 40°C and a temperature increase of only 10-15oC is needed in order to achieve desalination (Hill, 2007;Tay, et. al., 1996). <br><br> Several structural variations evolved with consideration of efficiency and hygiene: from a typical two jar-distiller with various condensers (PVD-1& 2) to the latest design of single-cylinder with an inverted cone condenser at the top (PVD-3). <br><br> Comparative analysis of the designs was done. Production efficiency of variants with different cooling systems was tested at 40 and 50oC under vacuum pressures of 10, 20 and 25 cm Hg. The water-cooled model performed most efficiently, especially at higher temperature and vacuum pressure. Despite its simplicity, PVD-3 was able to convert seawater into potable water using solar energy. Its production rate of 2,232 ml/day can supply the drinking water needs of 2-16 persons depending on the size of the pressure cooker used. <br><br> PVD is truly a cost-effective, energy-efficient, and environment-friendly device that can also be a vital source of potable water in disaster areas where water contamination and scarcity is a major problem.

ARMOR SHRIMP - THE FRIENDLY WASTE
An Hai Nguyen
Tran Dai Nghia High School for the Gifted, Ho Chi Minh, Ho Chi Minh, VIETNAM

This subject in its current form is the outcome of biological trial on the method of creating food preservatives, chitosan. The idea came initially to reduce seafood waste such as shrimp shells in those countries which have strengths in seafood export industry like Vietnam. Some success in finding alternatives replacing chemicals such as HCl, NaOH in Hackman and some more previous methods led to the development of recycling the waste in a new direction.<br><br> <br><br>The method I used is the combination of microbiological and chemical method. The microbio method is making water pickle brine improvement as an acid environment. The chemical method is to use the chemical environment mentioned above and alkaline environment which is water ash pH 8-10 to handle shrimp shells. Scrap like shrimp shells, the pickle brine pH 3-4 and water ash is essential materials.<br><br>I have already referred to the documental sources such as master trastates, international and Vietnamese scientific reports. In addition, I also searched for more information from the internet.<br><br>As being a high school student, due to the lack of time devoted to research as well as little evidence of chitosan samples in Vietnam, hence I have met some difficulties while implementing the project. However I have spontaneously solved the problem and gradually improve the desired objectives.<br><br> Results obtained from the above method can help to handle large amount of waste from shrimp shells waste into the environment. Moreover, I also offer a new way to create chitosan. The advantage of this solution is not harmful to humans and limit pollution.

PLANTS PURIFY PEE
Yiquan Lok

Water pollution by urea from urine and man-made fertilizer is causing algal and bacterial blooms, which produces toxins such as domoic acid. This neurotoxin causes hippocampal degeneration in the brain of mammals, including people, which consumed contaminated seafood. Current sewage treatment may use plants in lagoons and wetlands as a final stage. However, these plants are often underutilized in the process. This study examined whether plants can effectively absorb urea from urine. Four box sets were utilized: box A contained only sand, as control, and boxes B, C, and D contained both sand and grass. These sets were irrigated with urine diluted to 1:10, 1:10, 1:5, and 1:2.5, respectively. Within each series of boxes, the liquid was recycled. Each fluid was sampled at 3 to 4-day intervals for urea concentration measurements. The starting concentration of urea corrected for dilution was 426.6 ± 21.6 mmol/L. The final urea concentrations corrected for dilution were 120.9 mmol/L for A, 57.7 mmol/L for B, 48.5 mmol/L for C, and 53.5 mmol/L for D. All four solutions showed a decrease in urea concentration, but the urea levels were consistently lower in B to D, than A. This experiment showed that grass can effectively absorb urea from urine. This is the first step towards designing new systems, using plants to process human waste, in urban areas and underdeveloped nations, with the added benefit of clean water vapour released by the plants.

WILL EMF STUNT YOUR GROWTH?
Janelle van Leeuwen
Hillfield Strathallan College, Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA

The experiment tested the effect Ultra Low Frequency -Electro Magnetic Field (ULF-EMF) (60 Hz) radiation has on plant growth. A literature search showed that numerous studies have examined the effect of a high frequency EMF whereas this study examines the link between made between ULF-EMF radiation and detrimental plant growth.<br><br>A fast growing outdoor plant (Pampas Grass) was studied in a field setting. Low voltage and high voltage landscape lights and their electrical wires were run lengthwise along 2 sets of 5 plants to ensure constant contact and then compared to a control group. The height of all plants was measured every other day for 45 days during the experiment. The ULF-EMF radiation at the wire-plant interface was measured using a Gauss meter. After two months without experimental exposure there was a lasting measurable negative effect on plant growth. <br><br>The ULF-EMF from the 12Vac wire was 28 mG compared 120Vac wire that produced 0.1 mG. Plants exposed to low level ULF-EMF from 120Vac wire for 1080 hours were 11% shorter than the control, while plants exposed to the higher level ULF-EMF from 12Vac wire were 33% shorter than the control. <br><br>This experiment raises questions about the effect on humans exposed to ULF-EMF of a similar frequency, and about what qualifies as safe insulation for electrical wiring.

TO CLAY OR NOT TO CLAY? MANAGEMENT OF ALGAL GROWTH THROUGH CLAY AND CHITOSAN FLOCCULATION
Shefali Prashant Shah
Great Mills High School, Great Mills, MD

Clay flocculation can help mitigate algal blooms and chitosan can increase the adhesiveness between the phytoplankton and clay molecules. In this experiment, a common Bay phytoplankton, Prorocentrum minimum, was exposed to various concentrations of clay slurries and chitosan solution (low, medium, and high). Within these treatments, the ratio of chitosan to clay was increased (from A to D, A having no chitosan) to determine if chitosan helps to settle algal cells.<br><br> The variable tubes were measured at 3, 6, 24, 77, 101, and 125 hours and compared to the control, a tube containing only algal culture. A fluorometer was used to measure the IVF, a direct measure of algal cell fluorescence that positively correlates with cell density. <br><br> Results showed that the tubes with the highest ratio of chitosan to clay (1:10) took the shortest time to remove 95 % of the algae within their respective treatments. This confirms that chitosan increases the effectiveness of flocculation and the higher the ratio present, the shorter the time it takes to remove algae. Overall, high treatments removed algal cells faster than medium and low treatments (31, 44, and 51 hours, respectively, to remove 50 % of the algae and 96, 119, and 120 hours, respectively, to remove 95 % of the algae). This shows that increased amounts of clay/chitosan remove algae faster. Ultimately, clay and chitosan are effective in removing algal blooms, even in low amounts, but the more clay/chitosan added, the faster the algal cells are removed from the water column.

IMPROVING PURE WATER AVAILABILITY: OPTIMIZING FLUX IN REVERSE OSMOSIS MEMBRANES
Matthew Jaebol Kim
Commack High School, Commack, NY

The world water crisis is one of the most pressing issues of the modern world. This problem, which affects 1.2 billion people worldwide, is currently being alleviated with pressure-driven filtration techniques. These methods are characterized by three factors: rejection, which is how well the undesired particles are filtered out, flux, which is the flow rate through the membrane, and energy cost, which is the energy required to filter water at a given rate. The purpose of this investigation was to synthesize a high-flux, high-rejection, and low-cost reverse osmosis membrane, which is used to filter monovalent salts from water. The membrane consisted of three layers: a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottom layer, a polyacrylonitrile (PAN) middle layer, and a nanoporous polyamide top layer. The polyamide was synthesized by the dynamic interfacial polymerization of m-phenylenediamine (MPD) and trimesoyl chloride (TMC). An orthogonal array method was used for three variables: MPD concentration, TMC concentration, and the number of cycles of dynamic interfacial polymerization. The optimized membrane was fabricated from a 2% MPD solution, 0.15% TMC solution, and 8 cycles of dynamic interfacial polymerization, and exhibited 98.2 % rejection, 14.8 L/m^2hr and a low energy cost, making this membrane the forefront of reverse osmosis technology.

BIOCHAR CARBON SEQUESTRATION: THE EFFECTS OF FEEDSTOCK AND TEMPERATURE OF PYROLYSIS ON CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL STABILITY OF BIOCHAR
Meghana Vijay Rao
Jesuit High School, Portland, OR

This novel research studied effects of feedstock and temperature of pyrolysis on chemical and physical stability of biochar. Biochar, carbon-rich charcoal soil amendment, is a potential carbon-negative solution to reduce atmospheric carbon. Biochar stores 50% of the of the plant’s carbon dioxide in carbon sinks with a predicted half-life of millenniums. Long-term stability is currently undetermined. <br><br>Biochar was made in a Top-lit Updraft (TLUD) stove (360-420ºC) and Fluidyne Pacific Class Gasifier (above 420ºC) using Douglas fir chips, Hydrostraw (grass), and methane digester pellets. Proximate analysis determined moisture, volatile matter, and ash content. Chars were ultrasonicated, simulating physical stress over centuries. A Total Organic Carbon Analyzer measured lost carbon and nitrogen. Chemical stability was determined by mass lost through oxidation. <br><br>The stability of carbon in grass and pellet chars increased with temperature; the wood char decreased. After ultrasonication, the TLUD pellet char lost 1.68% initial total carbon (TC), the highest across all chars, and .44% total nitrogen (TN). Wood 550ºC lost the least TC (.01%) and .3% TN. Wood was the most carbon stable, then grass and pellets. The physical and chemical stability did not correlate. Wood 550C lost 80% mass after chemical oxidation. Grass lost the least mass (avg 17%), then pellets (avg 23%), lastly wood (avg 56%). <br><br>The results demonstrate feedstock and temperature of pyrolysis affect the stability of biochar. Stability also varied by feedstock, with wood most ideal for secure carbon capture, and grass most resistant to chemical weathering. A protocol to determine stability is a potential extension.

A COMPARISON OF THELYPTERIS KUNTHII, BAMBUSA MULTIPLEX, AND MICROSTEGIUM VIMINEUM ON THE VOLTAGE PRODUCED BY A PLANT MICROBIAL FUEL CELL
Reid William D'Amico
Hilton Head Preparatory, Hilton Head, SC

A plant microbial fuel cell (PMFC) is a piece of equipment that receives electrons from a reaction that turns chemical energy released from the roots of the plant (rhizodeposition) into electrical energy. The purpose of this experiment is to determine the genus of a naturally occurring species within a southeastern United States wetland that can yield the greatest electric voltage. It is predicted that the Thelypteris kunthii plant will produce the greatest electric voltage because its rhizoids have the greatest surface area whereas the rhizoid’s surface area for the Bambusa multiplex and Thelypteris kunthii are not as great.<br><br> In order to test, three PMFCs were created and the three respective plants were planted inside the anode compartment. A control MFC was also created. After the fuel cells were allowed to stabilize, voltage readings were recorded daily for a month by a multimeter. <br><br> The PMFC that produced the greatest voltage over the course of the experiment was the Thelypteris kunthii PMFC. Therefore, the genus Thelypteris (or another related fern species) should be used to create a PMFC with the greatest voltage. While the Thelypteris kunthii PMFC did produce the greatest voltage, it was found that both of the other PMFCs also produced significant voltage. When a two sample t-test was performed, it was concluded that all plants produced statistically significantly higher voltage when compared to the control MFC. It was also noted that when the Thelypteris kunthii was compared to the other plants in a two sample t-test, the Thelypteris kunthii’s PMFC’s voltage was statistically higher. Therefore humans should utilize plants like the Thelypteris kunthii in order to maximize the amount of energy that is naturally released by the reaction of plants and bacteria.

CONTROLLING ASIAN CARP: A SHOCKING CURRENT EVENT
Brandon Brady Benninger
Boone Grove High School, Valparaiso, IN

Our Great Lakes are under attack by the invasive Asian Carp. If they were to establish themselves in our lakes, it would prove detrimental to the ecosystem, the multi-billion dollar fishing industry, and recreational lake use, as they can become harmful air born projectiles when disturbed by watercraft.<br><br> My goal was to explore some of the problems associated with stopping their entry into the lakes. A fish deterrent system is already in place in the Chicago Sanitary & Ship Canal, the link between the Mississippi River and Lake Michigan. It was discovered that stray voltage was escaping the parameters of the barrier. A 2% scale model of this barrier was constructed to test several grounding systems to control the stray voltage. <br><br> Electrodes were placed in the same manner as the canal barrier, voltage was applied, and DC readings were taken in different areas of the barrier. A ground was created for each end of the simulated canal to absorb the stray voltage. By configuring new ground types, voltage was reduced to near zero beyond the barrier parameters. In conclusion, the results indicate that there are effective means of reducing and stopping dangerous stray voltage in an electrified water barrier system.

THERMOPROCESSING PROTOTYPE PLANT FOR THE SUGAR CANE BAGASSE AIMING THE PRODUCTION OF DIMETHYLETHER
Lucas Ribeiro Mata
Instituto Federal de Educacao, Ciencia e Tecnologia Fluminense - Campus Macae, Macae, RJ, BRASIL

Lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant in nature, but is not used in food and its use as feedstock for biofuel production is not technologically and economically feasible. Most municipalities in North of Rio de Janeiro State are agricultural. Their main crop is sugar cane. About 2/3 of the sugar cane energy is concentrated in the bagasse and straw, which is burned. Part part of the bagasse is used for heating boilers and for power generation. The dimethyl ether (DME), since the 60's, is used as a propellant in aerosols, but in the late 90s, it was discovered that the DME can replace diesel and cooking gas. Currently coal and natural gas are used for its production. My goal is to build a production plant of DME from sugar cane bagasse and straw, using common scrap material. I conducted a literature review to evaluate the routes of obtaining DME and I built, initially, a small gasifier to test the gasification of sugar cane straw and bagasse. The tests confirmed the technological feasibility of obtaining a synthesis gas, so I performed methanol dehydration to obtain the DME. I built a plant prototype for the production of Bio-DME, consisting of a gasifier, a dehumidifier and a reactor, and I obtained the DME from cane sugar straw. For the synthesis of DME, I chose direct synthesis due to higher performance and less energy expenditure required. I conclude that the achievement of DME from bagasse and cane sugar straw is technologically and economically feasible, providing a simple process, with little energy expenditure. This equipment is innovative and can be used for different types of lignocellulosic feedstock. As a continuation of the project, I will examine the economic viability and the balance of mass and energy.

ALTERNATIVE COAL: A SUSTAINABLE ENERGY PRODUCTION
Carlos Guilherme Lopes Grotto
Complexo Educational Dom Bosco, Imperatriz, MA, BRASIL

Charcoal uses are significant in the contemporary world because of its high calorific potential and favorable combustion. However the high emission of greenhouse gases and toxic metals gases makes their use questionable. In this context, the need to obtain alternative fuels with similar functions gets great importance. From this premise, this work aims to develop an alternative coal with advantages in physical-chemical parameters and low pollution levels. Therefore I produced a material using residues from: the burning of "babassu" coconut (Orbignyaphalerata) epicarp, silt from the Water Treatment Plant and cassava's starch in the proportion 10-5-1, respectively. The originated material was molded in cylindrical shape with a central orifice which was aimed to increase contact surface, thereby facilitating its initial combustion. Calorific value tests were conducted as well as, density, burning duration and total levels of Pb, Cd, Cu, Cr 3 + and CO2 (in the emissions), and residual analysis tests. I observed that the produced coal is more efficient in the physical-chemical parameter when it is compared to charcoal. The proposed coal showed satisfactory rates of emission of potentially toxic metals and CO2, following the limits set by the World Health Organization (WHO) differently of the charcoal's one. Moreover, the alternative coal residues showed characteristics which allow to be used as fertilizer. In this way, the production of the alternative coal is the creation of an environmental cycle which begins with the reuse of materials, basing its excellence in the use of residues.

THE OPTIMIZATION OF BIOREMEDIATION
Riya Patel
South Burlington High School, South Burlington, VT

This project determined whether adding a variety of essential elements to an oil-polluted area would increase bioremediation, resulting in a biostimulation formula that increased microbe population and optimized efficiency. Bacteria’s elemental nutritional requirements were added through various compounds. Each sample contained seawater, crude oil, and an additional compound mentioned above; and simulating a real-world oil spill, the control contained only seawater and oil. By freezing the experiments three weeks later, the remaining oil sitting on the frozen seawater was drawn by a pipette and measured for volume. Each test’s average percentage of oil remediated was calculated. As hypothesized, introducing additional elements to the oil-polluted site increased oil degradation, with the NPK test remediating 34.4% of the oil versus 15.2% in the control. In stage two, each compound’s concentration was increased to analyze the effects of various element quantities on bioremediation. The tests yielded a greater average percentage of oil remediated. Experiment three tested every combination of two compounds in each sample. The most effective combination of iron sulfate and NPK fertilizer caused the microbes to degrade 49.6% of the oil. By adding elements, 35.2% more oil was degraded than in the untreated polluted environment in the same period of time. These results suggest further experimentation to create a “recipe” for remediation that truly optimizes bioremediation by providing the most beneficial elements in the most advantageous quantities, thus maximizing microbe population and their degrading capabilities. Exploration could lead to rapid oil spill cleanup that minimizes oil’s detrimental effect on the environment.

THE EFFECT OF NITROGEN, SULFUR, AND PHOSPHORUS COMPOUNDS ON BIOREMEDIATION OF OIL SPILLS BY PSEUDOMONAS FLUORESCENS AND BACILLUS SUBTILIS
Meghan Marjorie Shea
Unionville High School, Kennett Square, PA

Bioremediation involves the application of microbes to break down harmful substances. This project was completed to enhance oil spill bioremediation techniques through the addition of sodium sulfate, sodium nitrate, and sodium phosphate to the media of Pseudomonas fluorescens and Bacillus subtilis. Since Pseudomonas sp. and Bacillus sp. often utilize nitrates during cellular respiration and nitrate ammonification, respectively, it was hypothesized that the addition of sodium nitrate would increase the number of smaller hydrocarbons present in samples containing either bacteria more than sodium sulfate or sodium phosphate. <br><br> To test the hypothesis, flasks were prepared containing different combinations of bacteria, .1 molar solutions of the above nutrients, salt water, and crude oil-substitute hexadecane (C16H34). After shaking at 27°C for six days to simulate an ocean environment, the organic and liquid layers were separated in each flask using hexanes as a solvent. A sample of each organic layer was run through a mass spectrum gas chromatograph to identify the compounds present.<br><br> A treatment of sodium sulfate and Pseudomonas sp. degraded hexadecane most efficiently, as six smaller compounds were created during the trial. Overall, hydrocarbon metabolism of Pseudomonas sp. proved more effective than Bacillus sp. over a six-day trial as treatments with Bacillus sp. resulted in only isomers of hexadecane. The appearance of similar compounds in all samples containing each bacterium, respectively, may lead to additional insights about the specific metabolism of the microbes. Results from this experiment have applications for enhancing bioremediation techniques, a need exemplified by the Deepwater Horizon catastrophe.

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE EROSION AND CONSERVATION OF DUNES AT BARCELONETA AND ISABELA, PUERTO RICO
Coralis Marie Rivera-Aponte
Centro Residencial de Oportunidades Educativas de Mayaguez, Mayaguez, PUERTO RICO

Dunes are the most important natural barrier against the brunt of the sea on the coasts. In Puerto Rico, there has been very little attention on the protection and restoration of the dunes. In the Municipality of Barceloneta, these have been exploited due to sand extraction, solid waste deposits, and road and building construction. This investigation is aimed to determine the need for implementing a Restoration and Conservation Plan (RCP) for the Barceloneta dunes. Isabela’s dunes were used as an investigation control group since they are under an RCP by the Marine Life Program. To confirm the hypothesis, a comparative study was done of the dune areas using past and present photographs of both beaches. The RCP for the Isabela dunes was analyzed to determine its effectiveness and how it compared to the lack of RCP in the Barceloneta dunes. The results revealed that in Isabela the reforestation, the educational signs and the wood pallets that accumulate sand have reduced the erosion. In Barceloneta, on-site observation revealed more contamination and erosion and less vegetation. The flora study of the Barceloneta dunes confirms the ecological sequence of the plants for coastal sand dunes in Puerto Rico. The RCP in Isabela has shown positive results demonstrating that dune deterioration can be stopped and reversed. In conclusion, the RCP in Isabela has proven to be effective, and Barceloneta needs to implement one like it. A recommendation for future sand dune management is in process to be release to governmental agencies.

Natechanok Yutthasaksunth
Triam Udom Suksa School, Bangkok, Bangkok, THAILAND

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is considered as a major greenhouse gas that plays important role on climate change. In this study, we propose the chemical process which can convert CO2-rich exhaust gas into valuable chemicals. This study was conducted based on thermodynamic assessment and process simulation. A Tri-Chemical Production Process was proposed to generate (a) Dimethyl carbonate (DMC), applied for improving petrol quality, being a precursor for producing polycarbonate resins, used as reagent instead of poisonous phosgene and dimethyl sulphate for organic synthesis, and being as environmental-friendly solvent for various chemical processes (b) Methanol (CH3OH), an environmentally-benign fuel owing to low carbon content and a valuable reagent for several applications, and (c) Synthesis gas, a valuable fuel and its numerous applications. Carbon dioxide and residual carbon released from coal-based plants were used as raw material feed for this process. With the appropriate operating conditions (i.e. temperature and pressure), the simulation results showed that this process can produce dimethyl carbonate, methanol, and synthesis gas represented with the yield of 0.039%, 2.99%, and 75.56%, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed process can reduce amount of carbon dioxide released to atmosphere up to 15.6% where the overall system consumed the net thermal energy of 5.69%. Finally, it was expected that this process could be further developed in a practical industry.

HEAT LOSS VS. ROOF TYPES
Emmanuelle Hulm
Strasburg Public School, Strasburg, ND

The purpose of my project was to determine the most efficient type of roof in regards to heat loss.<br><br> My hypothesis was that the best overall roof would be the Hip roof. I thought this would be because the heat would be evenly spaced out among the entire house. I thought that the overall worst roof would be the Flat because it was so bad for snow removal, water leakage, and other things.<br><br> I used a huge cardboard box, newspaper, timer, notebook, pencil, camera, pot holders, soup ladle, permanent marker, a beaker, and hot glue.<br><br> To perform my experiment, first I cut out all the insulation from the newspaper. Next, I made all the measurements for my houses and then cut them and out put them together with hot glue taking special care to the seams so heat could not escape. I heated water up to 84 degrees Celsius. I ladled 200 mL of hot water into the beaker and then took the temperature. I put my first house on top without the insulation and waited for 5 minutes. At the end of 5 minutes, I then took the temperature again. I then started with my next house. I did three trials. Next, for the insulation part, I made a cage to house it and slipped it into each house 3 times.<br><br> In conclusion to my project I found out that my hypothesis was not correct. The overall best roof was the Flat roof and the worst was the Gable roof.

MONITORING THE DISTURBANCE OF SOIL MICRO-ECOSYSTEMS IN DORMANT TOPSOIL USING NEMATODES AND STUDYING THE METHODS TO REHABILITATE SOIL FOR EFFECTIVE SITE RESTORATION
Laura Bernadette Lane
Aztec High School, Aztec, NM

In the Four Corners Area of New Mexico there are over 20,000 gas wells. Energy Companies must reclaim the abandoned well sites and access roads. Reclamation involves re-contouring, restoring topsoil, and reestablishing native vegetation. Reestablishing plant biodiversity quickly is desired to minimize soil erosion, protect surface water, and provide forage for animals. It typically takes five to seven years to re-vegetate a site with favorable soil conditions. Stable topsoil takes hundreds of years to develop and the preservation of topsoil is a critical conservation issue in maintaining a sustainable environment. <br><br>Research proves nematodes are effective indicators of soil ecosystem health (Lane, 2010). The goal of this year’s research is to investigate whether spread or stockpiled topsoil, will more thoroughly maintain a nematode distribution consistent to native undisturbed topsoil. <br><br>The Nematodes were classified into trophics, and hand elutriation was used to extract the nematodes from the soil. The results proved the storage of topsoil directly affects the micro-ecosystem following disturbance, and topsoil spread evenly maintains a more comparable micro-ecosystem to native soil than piled topsoil. The nematode distribution in the 2010 guide for the Flora Vista native grass ecosystem (lane, 2010) was modified using the trophic data.

EFFECTS OF CO2 ENRICHMENT AND N2 ON THE GROWTH OF BRASSICA JUNCEA
Anjana Kumar
Americus-Sumter High School South, Americus, GA

Purpose: the purpose of this experiment was to determine the effect of CO2 enrichment and nitrogen availability on the growth of Brassica juncea. Since I had captured carbon dioxide chemically before, I wanted to observe the effect of elevated carbon dioxide on plant growth.<br><br>Procedure:<br><br>First, the seeds were placed in oasis cubes for germination for 10 days. Next, 8 containers were covered with black polyethylene trash bags to block the sunlight and prevent algae growth. In each container four oasis cubes with plants were placed. Following that nutrient solutions with nitrogen levels of 0,50,100 and 200 Ppm were poured into both experimental and control group containers with aeration stones and air pumps running. <br><br>After two weeks of growth,among the eight containers,only four were placed in a large tub with the Carbon dioxide generator, which was built using yeast,sugar,5 liter can and two 16 oz bottles. Next, plant growth was recorded from both the control and experimental groups every week. Since the plants contain 98% water, the dry weight of plants were taken. <br><br>Results: The growth of plants with carbon dioxide treatment was longer in length when compared to the control group,which received no carbon dioxide treatment.<br><br> <br><br>Conclusions: The increase in plant growth was affected by the treatment of Carbon dioxide,which in turn supported my hypothesis. The differential treatment given to the plants showed a positive response to growth. A decrease in level of Carbon dioxide ppm can happen if more plants are grown, since normal plant absorbs 600 ppm. By conducting this experiment, the atmospheric carbon dioxide levels can be decreased.

CARBON FOOTPRINT: WHICH FUEL LEAVES A SMALLER CARBON FOOTPRINT?
Vidal Castaneda
Americas High School, El Paso, TX

As the global environment has become a world concern, there has been an increase interest in seeking an earth friendly alternative to fossil fuel, also known as gasoline. World scientists and analysts have stated that the organic fuel known as E-85 ethanol is currently the most earth friendly alternative to gasoline. The testing conducted in this project compared various emissions emitted by an engine running the organic E-85 to the three most common grades of gasoline. Using a gas analyzer and an E-85 compatible engine, each fuel was tested. The emissions of each were noted consisting of carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), aromatic hydrocarbons (HC or PAH), and nitrous oxides (NOX). The results of the testing were that each fuel produced a different amount of each gas. With the fossil fuels tested, each of the fuels had their differences. In the lower octane fuels, the amount of emission expelled were usually much higher than the ones with a higher octane. A different aspect was that the lower octane fuels had a much larger variance than that of the higher octane fuels. All these fossil fuels have a linear relationship with one another but when E-85 is introduced, the data became scattered. The fuel gave off vast variances in certain emissions and others that were extreme outliers when compared to the other fuels. The results proved that the organic based E-85 was very erratic in the amounts of emission that it expelled, therefore proving the test inconclusive. Organic based E-85 neither proved that its emissions were favorable or not favorable over those of fossil fuels.

TESTING THE MERCURY ABSORPTION OF ALGAE WITH VARIANT CARBON DIOXIDE TOLERANCE
Brian Christopher Rinehart
duPont Manual Magnet High School, Louisville, KY

In this project, cultures of the algae genera Chlorella and Scenedesmus were grown. After they were grown, they were put into solutions of three different mercury concentrations over two amounts of time to see how they absorbed mercury compared to each other. Three stock solutions of mercury were mixed at 478.8 ng Hg/L, 809.5 ng Hg/L, and 1624.7 ng Hg/L. The algae were concentrated at 1000 micrograms per liter. Sixty samples of mercury and algae were prepared and the mercury concentrations in the samples were checked after 60 seconds and 120 seconds. The results showed that the length of exposure and the initial stock concentration seemed to make little difference. They also showed that the Scenedesmus seemed to absorb mercury at a higher rate than the Chlorella.

REINFORCING THE CONCRETE BY CLEANING THE ENVIRONMENT FROM WASTE PRODUCT
Blerand Ismaili
Shkolla e mesme "LIRIA", Elbasan, ALBANIA

20 000 tons of iron Ground Blast Furnace Slag are thrown away in our city every year. This waste GBFS is not used of at all since it causes severe damage to environment due to harmful substances in its slag. These substances reaching rivers or arable fields harm the nature and compensation for this damage is hardly possible or impossible.<br><br> The environment and economy will gain great benefits if we can consume this GBFS in different ways.<br><br>Concrete industry is one the industries that uses natural resources in great amount. The harm to the environment caused by concrete industry can be reduced by using resources effectively and producing strong durable concrete. Therefore, use of by-products and waste as binding material and agrega gradually gains importance for the improvement in concrete industry owing to the advantages it brings into the environment and economy. <br><br>In this study, we have examined if GBFS harmful to the environment and economy can be used in concrete production progress. Pressure resistance qualities of GBFS added concrete have been studied. <br><br>Variant concrete samples have been produced by using GBFS in different proposions instead of thin agrega. GBFS has been proven to have positive effects on pressure resistance. The research results have shown that pressure resistance of concrete depends on the amount (of GBFS) added. The maximum increase in pressure resistance has been seen in 10% GBFS added concretes.<br><br>This research has shown that use of GBFS instead of thin agrega increases the pressure resistance of concrete.

WASTE NOT WANT NOT: USING BLUE-GREEN ALGAE TO REMOVE UREA AND CARBON DIOXIDE
Brian Scott Bates, Katelyn McCarley, 
Bartlesville High School, Bartlesville, OK

The world’s ecosystems are under intense pressure due to 6.9 billion humans. Build-up of human waste products such as feces, urine, and carbon dioxide are problematic worldwide, causing water and air pollution. This project examined a possible green alternative method to deal with both urea and carbon dioxide using a closed system in which blue green algae consumed the urea (the major component of urine) and CO2. It was hypothesized that algae grown in a urea-water solution would grow more rapidly and would then consume a higher rate of CO2 than blue-green algae grown in water without the urea. The experiment used twenty plastic containers, ten of which were used as the experimental set and were filled with 800mL of water, 50mL of Alga-grow™ freshwater media, and 16g of urea inoculated with 10 mL of the blue-green algae. The other ten bottles were used as the control with all chemicals present excluding the urea. All bottles were placed in a climate controlled growth chamber with separate aeration going into each bottle. The bottles were shaken once per week and a sample of each was then removed and tested for nitrate levels. After four weeks of growth each group was tested for CO2 consumption. The experiment showed that the urea fostered more algae growth, which in turn consumed more CO2. This application could be useful either in a wastewater treatment plant or on a space station/vehicle, where it would facilitate the safe removal of both urea and CO2.

OUR NATIVE FRUITS: OPPORTUNITY OR UTOPIA?
Maria Fernandez, Gonzalo Camejo, Yamila Cuendes
Jose Alonso y Trelles, Tala, Canelones, URUGUAY

First of all, we wander why native fruits don´t appear integrated to the economical activities of our zone or to the daily diet, having in mind we are in a fruit and horticultural area. We worked four native fruits, which are: Pitanga (Eugenia uniflora), Guayabo del país (Acca sellowiana), Guaviyú (Myrcianthes pungens) and Arazá (Psidium cattleianum). <br><br>Our hypothesis consists in confirm if throw out environmental education we can conclude into the aspects mentioned before. We planted and observed fruits, basing our work on INIA and AMRU, investigating native fruits properties, we make a survey to the population to determine which was the problem. We warm up the seeding of native fruits at educational centers; besides that, we promoved the sensitization of the environmental problem that ocupated us. <br><br>Acording to our job, fruits are rich in antioxidants, they easily adapt to the soil, they have high resistence, they present not much genetic variability and they have a relevant function in our ecosystem; and acording to the surveys, people lack of knowledge about them. We arrived to the conclusion that we don´t have high genetical or adaptative limits. Fruits have a relevant place on environmental education and on the productivity of our native possessions. So that, they can be adopted as a complementary economical activity, throw which we can revalue and take advantage of native fruits versus exotic.

Technology as a subject in the curricula of Technological Agrarian Basic Cycle, used as a methodology, solving problems through the development of technological projects related to reality, which are based on the interests of pupils, the school and the community, which favours the contextualization of apprenticeships, increases the functionality and leads to the implementation to other situations other than the studied.<br><br>Therefore for the elaboration of this technological project, we consider the reality of the educational community of our "La Concordia” Agrarian School shows that the influence of the school context is very wide and consists of a rural living large producers dedicated to agricultural crops based in systems of a very important application of technology, with producers of family scale with traditional production and in many cases artisanal, often continue. Due to our relationship with this last type of productions, we decided to investigate the artisanal cheese and identify in this category issues and possible solutions to them.<br><br>To investigate the process of production of artisanal cheese wraps one of the major problems facing the producer is the washing of the cheeses. The activity carried out in this way requires a great physical effort from the operator. As result you get a poor performance of the labour force (albeit familiar), that takes a long time. This results in a higher cost and thus lower margin of profit for the producer.<br><br>This machine features two pneumatic cylinders working with compressed air and which makes access to the machine automatically. The cheese was driven by the first cylinder, triggers the second one, which regulates the brush that makes the process of washing the cheese.

ESTABLISHING THE PHYTOREMEDIATION CAPACITY OF BRASSICA RAPA AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR HEAVY-METAL UPTAKE USING HYDROPONICS AND UV-VIS SPECTROSCOPY
Nicole Lynn Miller, Nadia Kemal, 
Charlotte High School, Punta Gorda, FL

Brassica Rapa is a potential phytoremediation solution to heavily polluted waters with harmful metals. Heavy metals at high concentrations have been known to cause extreme environmental effects and human illness including: lung disease, bone defects, malformation, spontaneous abortion, and chronic poisoning. Contamination of local waters, including the Peace River, Myakka River, and Caloosahatchee River, were verified by heavy metal test kits and dithizone with analysis by spectroscopy.<br><br>Ten gallons of water were collected from the sites and placed in two Ebb and Flow hydroponic systems, planted with Brassica Rapa. After the full growth of the plants (72 trials (plants) per water sample), achieved in 14 days, working solutions were created by pulverizing the plants using a mortar and pestle and adding 10 ml of distilled water. The working solutions were centrifuged and then analyzed by heavy metal kits and spectroscopy using dithizone as a mercury indicator. The Peace River plants contained 0.15-0.2 ppm mercury and 31.8% transmittance. The Myakka River plants contained 0.1 ppm mercury, traces of cadmium/ cobalt, and 73.2% transmittance. The Caloosahatchee River plants contained .025 ppm mercury, traces of cadmium/ cobalt, and 86.4% transmittance. <br><br>The process of rhizofiltration, involving Brassica Rapa, has been verified as a potential solution to water pollution, seen by the results of the heavy metal kits and analysis by spectroscopy. The construction of a raft system, containing Brassica Rapa pot sites, floating throughout these contaminated water sources may be a possible solution to the ongoing threat of heavy metal pollution.

THE EFFECTS OF MICRO-ALGAE CHARACTERISTICS ON THE BIOREMEDIATION RATE OF DEEPWATER HORIZON CRUDE OIL
Xiuqi Cao, Ying Xiong, 
Century High School, Rochester, MN

Algae bioremediation, though under-publicized and not prevalently actuated for cleanup, is potentially safer and more efficient than current crude oil spill treatments. Studies have already accredited algae with oil bioremediation (degradation of contaminants) capabilities.<br><br>We aimed to determine whether algal characteristics (motility, chlorophyll type, and cellular structure) would increase algal degradation rates of Deepwater Horizon crude oil. Eight algae were utilized: Aphanocapsa sp., Chlorella autotrophica, Coccochloris elabens, Dunaliella tertiolecta, Oscillatoria sp., Scenedesmus obliquus, Synechococcus elongatus, and Volvox aureus; each alga has a unique combination of the traits, allowing each trait to be tested. Algal growth in "heavy" (dense) crude conditions was analyzed via spectrophotometry (460nm & 680nm) and computer image processing techniques.<br><br>We hypothesized that motility, chlorophyll a & b, and multicellularity would influence algae bioremediation rates.<br><br>Algae and control (algae-free) tests, placed under fluorescent lighting, contained freshwater or seawater solution and 1ml of crude oil. Test masses and water levels were recorded for fifteen days. The data, conclusive with all p-values < 0.05, was analyzed for correlations between the characteristics and degradation rates.<br><br>Results revealed that the algae degraded up to a significant 35% of the crude (C. elabens). Correlations between the characteristics and bioremediation rates were not revealed, so the hypotheses were unsupported. However, two important conclusions were deduced: algae can degrade "heavy" crude oil and thrive in high crude conditions, abilities necessary for bioremediation.<br><br>From this study, we have shown that properly-controlled algae are viable agents for crude oil bioremediation.

DETECTING OIL SPILLS USING SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR
Mark Sands, Calvin Ling, 
Liberal Arts and Science Academy High School, Austin, TX

The BP oil spill has attracted much attention from the scientific community to find detection and mitigation measures. Following an oil spill, timely and accurate monitoring of the spill is necessary for cleanup efforts. This study investigates the feasibility of detecting the depth and extent of an oil layer on a water surface using downward-looking synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Laboratory measurements are taken using an instrumentation radar of a layer of motor oil, which is electrically similar to crude oil, on top of a pool of water. The resulting SAR image shows that the air-oil and oil-water interfaces form distinct features in the image. The positions of the features agree with a theoretical simulation of the return. Oil patches of different volumes are then examined, and the thickness of the patches is clearly visible in the measured SAR image. Next, mixtures of oil and water ranging from 0% oil to 100% oil in 10% increments are prepared. These better represent the conditions of an oil spill, as spilled oil becomes mixed with the surrounding water. Measurements of these mixtures show that depth is determinable when the mixture contains at least 60% oil.

CRUDE AWAKENING: THE STUDY OF OIL ABSORPTION EFFICIENCY OF VARIOUS MATERIALS
Walker Lloyd Wiggins, Wiles Wiggins, 
Southside High School/ Ramsey Junior High School, Fort Smith, AR

The project is designed to determine the most efficient oil-absorbent material when extracting oil from an oil-treated water solution. An oil-absorbent material must absorb more oil than water to be efficient. Eighteen oil-absorbent materials were tested, and the process was replicated five times. A nylon vessel containing a mixture of 400 ml of water and 200 ml of 10W30 weight oil (2 to 1 ratio) was used to submerge the eighteen oil-absorbent materials. Each test material was submerged for three minutes, removed and drained. The remaining oil-treated water was separated and measured. To calculate the amount of oil and water absorbed, the amount water and oil absorbed by the material was subtracted from the original mixture. The average absorption for each of the eighteen materials, replicated five times, was calculated by dividing the average of absorbed water and oil by the original water and oil mixture. The results suggest that polyester absorbs the most water (38%) and oil (22%). However, cotton absorbs only 10% water while absorbing 20% oil. Thus, the data suggests that cotton is the most efficient oil-absorbent material of the 18 materials tested.

The project Bioremoving of chrome in leather shavings seeks the relocation of chrome present in the leather shavings by bioleaching with Acidthiobacillus ferrooxidans. The choice of this waste is due by this being responsible for 90% of the residue of wet blue leather and considers it toxic, flammable, corrosive and pathogenic This process was made up of twenty-four flasks, eight experimental complete T & K medium and eight incomplete experimental T & K (without iron), each with four control copies. After that, they were placed in a shaker incubator at a temperature of 28 º C and 150 rpm rotation for four weeks. Each week withdrew six flasks from the shaker, two of these experimental and one of its controls. The analysis of chromium was done through spectrophotometric methods. It was found that the use of bioleaching with A. ferrooxidans, reduces the amount of chrome present in the leather shavings, showing reduced: 82.74% chrome leached into the culture using complete T & K and 42.97% for the incomplete T & K medium. The control T & K obtained 53.92% reduction of chrome content and the incomplete control T & K of 31.05%. It was noted on the finish of the research that the use of this technology is very positive and has great potential to become an alternative way to manage this residue.<br><br>Keywords: Bioleaching, Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, T & K medium,leather shavings , waste management

Educational Institution "Sollertia", Pucallpa, Ucayali, PERU

The oil extraction process in the Amazon forest increases the risk of pollution by oil spills, which could affect the health and economy of the local populations. This problem is aggravated by the lack of alternatives to control and recover affected oil spills areas. In this work we present the use of a biological organisms such as water plants (Pistia stratiotes, Eichornia cassipes) and land worms (Eisenia foetida) for oil spill bioremediation<br><br>To study the treatment of oil contaminated water, we build a wood container filled with water of the Ucayali River, 200 ml of crude oil, and water plants of the species Pistia stratiotes and Eichornia cassipes. The control module contained the same amount of water and plants, without oil. A week after treatment we performed histological cuts of the aerenchymas of leaves of the plants of both modules, and were observed to 100X. Results show plants exposed to the oil absorbed the components of the petroleum, storing the oil in their aerenchymas.<br><br>The treatments of land was realized in two modules. The first one contained manure to which were added 70 individuals of land worm Eisenia foetida, and 100 ml of favorable environment containing Pseudomonas sp; and 200ml of crude oil, in a volume of 286,000 cm3. The control module did not have oil. We measured the total fats by Soxhlet's method to corroborate the efficiency of the treatment. Results shows that percentage of total fats were diminishing in time; which indicates that the saturated hydrocarbons were degraded in a gradual way in the presence of organisms in the treatment.<br><br>We conclude that in three treatments results show decontamination by the processes of bioremediation. This might be healthy alternative to rescue the ecosystems with oil contamination. Nevertheless, we think that our results were not statistically significant due to the lack of experimental time, but with more time for experiments, the projections in the results are very promising.

AIRWALL - TSUNAMI STOP

Currently, there is no feasible method of reducing the tsunami wave effects considerably or completely. The purpose of our research was to develop such a system. We investigated energy loss of the tsunami when passing through a continuous bottom-to-surface column of water saturated with gas bubbles. We proved the validity of this method and outlined some ways of its implementation.<br><br>During experiments, we registered some increase of the tsunami splash distance by up to 30% at 18% of gas concentration in the gas-water mixture. When the gas concentration increased, the percentage of energy dissipation also increased, and we achieved almost complete tsunami wave extinction (up to 20% of primary energy). Neutralized energy goes into a reflected wave and secondary weaker oscillations. Theoretical modeling shows the effectiveness of the energy dissipation positively correlates with the gas concentration, and with the relative thickness of the barrier to the wavelength.<br><br>We considered two practical barrier forming methods: placing gas containers at the bottom along the protected coast, or using a gas delivery system to the bottom by compressor stations. The cost of such system estimated at 5 to 7 billion dollars per 1 km of coastline. When protecting the large coastal cities, this cost can be repaid during one tsunami attack (tsunami damage in South-East Asia in 2004 amounted to 15 billion dollars), also saving thousands of human lives.<br><br>The research purpose was achieved: we designed the system of anti-tsunami protection, which can completely eliminate their effects, and is feasible for practical implementation.

A QUANTITATIVE STUDY OF MARINE BACTERIA OF DISPERSED AND UNDISPERSED CRUDE OIL AND POTENTIAL FOR ENHANCEMENT OF BIODEGRADATION
Rithika Marumagan Thirumal, Samantha Biddick, 
Ovey Comeaux High School, Lafayette, LA

Last year, an oil spill occurred at the Deepwater Horizon, Gulf of Mexico owned by B.P. Surfactants were used to disperse the oil and oil eating bacteria to consume it. The purpose of this project was to determine the effects of surfactant and nutrient on aquatic bacteria. <br><br> It was hypothesized that when medium crude oil was added to ocean water, then the Acid-Producing Bacteria (APB), Nitrate-Reducing Bacteria (NRB), and Sulfate-Reducing Bacteria (SRB) would increase. Adding surfactant and nutrient to ocean water and crude oil would cause a higher increase in the bacteria level. Dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, salinity, total dissolved solids and total suspended solids would not have a significant change. Water samples collected from Grand Isle, LA were treated as follows: water, water/oil, water/oil/surfactant, water/oil/surfactant/nutrient, water/surfactant/ nutrient, water/surfactant, water/oil/nutrient, and water/nutrient. Samples were tested for APB, NRB, SRB, oil level and for water quality on Day 5, 10, 20, 30, and 50. Microbiology Field Test kits were used to measure the amount of bacteria. <br><br> TTEST were conducted and a p-value <0.05 was considered significantly different. All bacteria significantly increased with the addition of oil, surfactant, and nutrient. Samples from Day 30 and 50 and reference oil were run through a GCMS. Evidence from the chromatograms help conclude that the fastest method to degrade oil is the addition of nutrients only if the fluctuation of water parameters can be tolerated for a certain amount of time. If water parameters are needed to stay consistent then the use of surfactants is suggested but the biodegradation is slower compared to the addition of nutrient only.

TO INVESTIGATE THE ADSORPTION POTENTIAL OF ORANGE PEEL BIOSORBENTS FOR THE REMOVAL OF COPPER(II) IONS
Wei Liang Matthew Lee, Ng Qin Xiang, 
Anglo-Chinese School (Independent), Singapore, SINGAPORE

This study investigates the effectiveness of waste orange peels as eco-friendly biosorbents for the removal of copper(II) ions from industrial wastewater. In addition to comparing raw orange peel with activated carbon, a commercial adsorbent, we experimented with different chemical modifications to improve the adsorption ability of the peel. The adsorbents were adsorbed in batches in 500ppm Cu2+ solution over 4h, to determine their adsorption quotients, q (mass of Cu2+ adsorbed per mass of adsorbent). Raw orange peel gave a q=0.023, compared to activated carbon with q=0.031. Sodium hydroxide saponification was the most effective modification with q=0.045, while citric acid esterification gave q=0.027. Further treatments of already modified peels—esterification of saponified peels and saponification of esterified peels—lowered the adsorption quotient from 0.027 to 0.024 and from 0.045 to 0.040 respectively. Subsequent kinetics studies revealed that all adsorbents reached equilibrium with the solution within 90mins. After batch adsorption, the Cu2+ ions were leached from the adsorbents with 0.5M HCl. By gravimetric analysis, all adsorbents leached >70% of adsorbed copper. Thereafter, the adsorbents were regenerated using CaCl2 and subjected to further batch-adsorption. Each treatment exhibited a minimal decrease in q over 5 cycles of adsorption-desorption. Finally, microbial desorption was investigated as an environmentally-friendly alternative – results showed that it was less degenerative than chemical desorption, increasing the adsorbents’ reusability. In addition, preliminary trials demonstrate that multi-metal systems involving Cu2+ warrant further investigation due to competitive effects. Future work should address more hazardous ions and column filtration studies.

THE EFFECT OF LIMONENE BASED PAINT ON SOIL QUALITY
Laura Irene Hernandez, Javier Dominguez, 
Weslaco East High School, Weslaco, TX

Creating paint out of non-recycled plastic and orange oil called Limonene was accomplished in last year’s project. The purpose of last year’s project was to eliminate and recycle the thousands of pounds of plastic that are found in an area in the ocean called the Pacific Gyre. The plastic was harming the environment and now that we have created a durable paint, better than any store bought paints, there needed to be proof whether the plastic would harm the environment even more as paint. This was done by exposing the paint to the environment and discovering how it affected soils nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium contents; a soil needs these three nutrients to sustain life. The limonene based paint effects were compared to regular store bought paint effects. There were pots in a controlled environment, and uncontrolled environment. The controls were soils without any type of paints. The tests were done using a soil test kit and a pH probe. 12mL of soil from each pot was taken and added to 60mL of distilled water. The solution sat undisturbed for 24 hours and then the soil water was used to do the different tests. The soil water was added into test containers, and then an indicator capsule was added to determine the soils levels of nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium. The results proved that the limonene based paint and the store bought paint had the same effects on the soil; therefore, the paint that was created in last year’s project is one step closer to being on store shelves. Future research includes painting a metal part with the limonene based paint and exposing the part to harsh weather conditions, and continuing our test on soil to determine long term effects on soil which is exposed to limonene based paint.

Problems related to plastic wastes, which caused adverse impacts on humans and environments, are encountered in Thailand and many other countries It was observed that fish scales possessed properties such as transparency, flexibility , stickiness and durability Gelatin extracted from fish scale has been used in medicinal capsules indicating its safeness for consumers and environments. The purpose of this study was to explore the possibility of creating plastics derived from fish scale gelatins as new material for food packaging . The first part of this experiment aimed at investigating the optimum conditions and the suitable source of fish scales for gelatin extractions. It was found that soaking fish scales in 2% sodium hydroxide for 2.5 hours followed by 2% acetic acid resulted in high yield and tensile strength of the extracted gelatin. Snappers scales produced gelatin with highest quality and highest tensile strength among several kinds of fish scales tested. Experiments were performed to determine suitable compositions of addtitivrs on quality of the fish scale gelatin . It was found that the gelatin obtained from the mixture of 5:2.5:1 g:g:ml of snapper scale: corn flour: glycerin had the tensile strength greater than the gelatin without corn flour and glycerin. Moreover, the fish scale gelatins added with calcium carbonate and ethanol exhibited a number of properties, such as water solubility, tensile strength, tear strength, biodegradability , low-cost investment, and use of non- petrochemicals, compatible to presently used bioplastics for food packaging. Thus, fish scales can be used as material for production of eco-plastics which should be beneficial to consumers and most importantly, our environments.

MARA Junior Science College Of Pengkalan Chepa, Kota Bharu, MALAYSIA

The issue regarding oil spill nowadays is not only for cleaning the environment but also recovery of this precious commodity. The initial idea for this project is to compare the rate of oil absorption between coconut coir and hair. Our approach is to compare the amount of oil can be extracted from coconut coir and hair used to absorb oil spills so that it can be reused commercially.<br><br> <br><br>Rate of oil absorbed by coconut coir and hair was determined by soaking the sample in the same volume of crude oil. The oil is then extracted by compressing both samples with constant force.<br><br><br>Coconut coir can release up to 75% of the oil that have been absorbed initially when compressed with a constant force. Compared to hair, most of the absorbed oil from the coconut coir can be reused again.<br><br><br>Coconut coir is proven better than hair, as an oil absorbent and the amount of oil extracted to be reused. It can absorb up to 7 times its mass. For future experiments, we have planned to find the most suitable material to be used as the containers of the coconut coir and the factors that affect the rate of absorption of the coconut coir.

WE HAVE OBTAINED TRANSGENIC CYANOBACTERIA: A VERY EFFECTIVE IN BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF MOSQUITOES
Emilia Nicoleta Ion, Dragos Gherghescu, 
"Dimitrie Bolintineanu" High School, Bucharest, Muntenia, ROMANIA

EU legislation aims to restrict until elimination the use of chemical insecticides to combat insects of medial importance or other pests, and promotes and clean biological insecticides with specific action.<br><br>The aim is to obtain transgenic biocides with larvae-teratogenic effect for vector diseases and discomfort generating Culicidae, but without toxic and polluting effects on humans and environment. <br><br>The deposit of eggs of larvae and nymphs are conditioned by the presence of the aquatic environment. Currently there are numerous commercial formulations based on spores of Bacillus thuringiensis var.israelensis and Bacillus sphaericus that are applied in mosquitoes control. <br><br>We had to find a solution to all these impediments and to streamline the biological control of larvae culicide as hook upon which we can intervene to destroy Culicidae is larval stage. It is easier to control.<br><br>One of the solutions that we have thought, to avoid these problems in the use of Bti and Bsp, is finding suitable hosts for the transfer of responsible genes for the production of insecticide proteins to persist in habitats of mosquitoes larvae and that are at the same time a natural source of food for larvae. Also, because the transferred genes need to produce more toxin, we thought it would be necessary to clone and amplify them. Specifically we have thought of cloning and amplification Cry IVD gene from Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis and its transfer to cyanobacteria in aquatic habitats, the natural source food for the culicidae larvae.<br><br>Thus, we isolated the cryIVD gene, which encodes a larvicide protein specific to culicide by PCR followed by cloning and transferring them to cyanobacteria host. We obtained transgenic cyanobacteria, nontoxic and environmentally friendly to humans but which produce insecticidal proteins with high specificity for culicide larvae.<br><br>The proposed project responds to highly topical issues worldwide. We believe that in the future, the most promising way to eliminate these issues is the use of genetically modified organisms.

ENHANCING BIOFILTERS III: THE IMPACT OF ABSCISIC ACID ON THE SEQUESTRATION OF HEAVY METALS BY EUGLENA GRACILIS
Jacqueline Bari Bokor, Hannah Berkowitz, 
Long Beach High School, Lido Beach, NY

Euglena gracilis are able to remove unwanted and harmful metals from water supplies, sequestering them within vacuoles. Inside of the vacuoles, digestive enzymes convert the metals into their insoluble forms, allowing them to be filtered out. Abscisic acid, a stress regulatory hormone produced in plants and beneficial to Euglena due to their photosynthetic qualities, was added to solutions containing both metals and Euglena. The metals added were FeSO4, CdSO4, MnSO4, and CuSO4 in concentrations of 0.01M, 0.006M, 0.006M, and 0.01M, respectively. The metals were combined in groups with two, three, or all four metals and absorbance was tested and compared to control groups. Absorbance levels were tested using a spectrophotometer at 340nm (FeSO4), 400nm (CdSO4), 420nm (MnSO4), and 600nm (CuSO4). In the solutions in which the Euglena were supplied with abscisic acid, they were able to reduce the concentration of all the metals and had an overall maximum absorbance at 1.956A and a minimum absorbance at 0.063A. A filter was constructed in which a combing mechanism circulated the tank on a 20 minute cycle. After the cycle was complete, a sheet of polyester monofilament woven mesh was lifted from the bottom of the tank and filtered out both Euglena and metals. On a larger, commercial scale, this filter will be mechanized and circulate the tank or holding basin for a greater period of time to maximize metal removal, Euglena productivity, and time efficiency. With these findings, further construction, and experimentation, Euglena will have the ability to act as efficient biofilters for toxic heavy metals.

IMPLEMENTATION OF APPROPRIATE DESALINATION TECHNOLOGY
Katherine France Haentjens, Marianne Theriault, 
Villa Maria High School, Montreal, Quebec, CANADA

This design project was geared towards finding an appropriate desalination technology to be implemented in a Third World country. The main desalination techniques that were considered were: vapor compression, electrodialysis, reverse osmosis, ion exchange, solar desalination (solar still) and multi-stage flash distillation. An evaluation of the various desalination methods was completed and solar desalination was decided upon based on its efficiency, cost, durability and ability to function without electricity. This desalination technique was determined to be the most plausible for equatorial countries since it provides the population with potable water while simultaneously utilising the resources they posses (high incident solar energy and ambient temperature as well as vast quantities of salt water). Moreover, this technique not only desalinates, but also purifies water.<br><br>After having determined that solar desalination was the most appropriate technology to implement, a solar still was built. This solar desalinator was built using readily available materials for a cost of less than $75 dollars. <br><br>The desalinator was then tested to ensure that its efficiency was substantial enough to provide sufficient quantities of water for Third World countries. After having made a first prediction, based on the original data gathered, it was determined that the solar still has an efficiency of 48.5%, a value directly in line with that of commercial stills. The second prediction, using the incident solar energy present at the equator (1367W/m2), determined that the solar still produces on average 4L of water per day, the minimum human requirement.

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF AND IDEAL CONDITIONS FOR PHYTOREMEDIATION OF HEAVY METALS
Addie Ray Anne Fleron, Bridget Eileen Lewis, 
Westfield High School, Westfield, MA

Heavy metal contamination of soil, a significant problem in the United States, often renders large tracts of land unsuitable for agricultural use. Traditional remediation methods require a lot of time, money, and manpower, but preliminary studies have found that phytoremediation – the filtering of soil using plants – can be as effective as traditional methods. Our project had three goals: to determine the effectiveness of Bouteloua gracilis for phytoremediation; to determine whether pH levels play a role in the removal effectiveness; and to determine if phytoremediation is harmful to the plants.<br><br> For our project, Bouteloua gracilis was grown in three closed experimental setups that were contaminated with metals. In two of these setups, the alkalinity of the soil was increased. In the third, the pH was kept at neutral levels. Our project also had a control setup – plants were grown in uncontaminated soil kept at neutral pH levels. <br><br> By testing contaminant levels over time, it was determined that Bouteloua gracilis was effective for phytoremediation because the metal levels decreased. From this same data, it was also determined that phytoremediation is more effective in alkaline environments. By charting the growth of the experimental plants and comparing them to the control, it was concluded that phytoremediation did not have an immediate detrimental effect on the plants. This data can be used to further lower the cost of phytoremediation for commercial farmers and to increase use of phytoremediation.

A FISHY DETECTOR
Haleeda Hilmi, Nurul Amira Salehin, 
Tunku Kurshiah College, Seremban, Negeri Sembilan, MALAYSIA

A Fishy Detector is a portable kit that uses acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme from the brains of the climbing perch fish or better known as “ikan puyu” (Anabas testudineus) to detect insecticides, heavy metals and other unidentified toxic compounds in water quickly. AChE is an identified enzyme that quickens the response of an organism and can be used as a biomarker. It is widely distributed in the brain and the nervous system. AChE from a fish is used to make the kit as it is known that their brains have a more rapid detection of insecticides. The brains are obtained from fish that are sold in markets. After obtaining the brains from the fish, it was homogenized and extracted to get the particular enzyme. It was then partially purified and later optimized whereby the pH profile, temperature profile and substrate specificity were the parameters. As a conclusion, AChE is most suitable in a pH of 7 to 8, in an environment of not more than 30°C and is most active when acetylthiocholine (ATC) is used as the substrate. Inhibition studies were later held to determine the enzyme’s sensitivity toward which kinds of insecticides and heavy metals. From there, it was found that AChE from the brains of the climbing perch fish is sensitive toward carbaryl, carbofuran and malathion as well as mercury, copper and silver metals. This enhanced the usefulness of the kit as these pollutants are the most abundant in our country. A Fishy Detector can help environmentalist to quickly detect the presence of insecticides in water which is in approximately 50 minutes as compared to other insecticide detectors which may take up to more than 5 hours. This allows them to take earlier action to help the matter. This can ensure the safety of the aquatic organisms in the long run.

THE KINETICS OF CELLULOSIC ETHANOL
Heath Edward Garner, Hayden Garner, 
Taylorville High School, Taylorville, IL

The purpose of this experiment is to determine if creating ethanol from recycled goods is an effective source of fuel. The ability to transform recyclable goods into another source of fuel is beneficial because it will prevent overfilling landfills and extend the life of fossil fuel resources until a better fuel source is more readily available. To accomplish making ethanol, the process of fermentation must take place. This can be done when the enzyme cellulase turns cellulose materials into fermentable sugars. After the enzyme cellulase has had time to break the recycled materials down into glucose and other simple sugars,they will be ready for the next phase of the process. Next, yeast is added and then causes the creation of ethanol by the digestion of the fermentable sugars by the yeast. Finally, the mash must be distilled to determine how much ethanol is actually created during the process. The data collected during the experiment includes: collection of gasses produced and the amount of ethanol collected. These two things will confirm that there are reactions occurring in the process. The most important of these two measurements is the amount of ethanol collected. In conclusion this project will demonstrate that recyclables can be broken down and turned into a source of usable energy.

HIGH VALUE FUNGAL PROTEIN CULTIVATED IN FIVE CARBON BIOFUEL LIQUOR
Lindsay Sumiko Fujimoto, Sarah Tamashiro, 
Saint Andrew's Priory, Honolulu, HI

The goal of this project was to find a use for a co-product from the production of biofuel made from banagrass, acid hydrolysate, which contains a large amount of five carbon sugars. This would reduce the waste produced and will allow companies to make a higher profit. We decided to try to utilize acid hydrolysate as a growth medium for a protein based, food grade fungus that may be used as a fish feed ingredient or human nutritional supplement in the future. Additionally, we investigated the benefits of using banagrass juice as a nutritional supplement. If this was possible, it could further reduce the waste produced. The products that can be produced from the fungus grown on the acid hydrolysate could profoundly increase biofuel companies’ revenues and create a sustainable business. The first step in successfully being able to utilize the acid hydrolysate was to find the optimal growth conditions for the fungus, which is what this project focused on. The four conditions that were investigated were the optimal acid hydrolysate concentration, the ideal type of nutritional supplementation, the optimal concentration of nutritional supplementation, and the optimal pH level. We found that the optimal condition is 25% acid hydrolysate with 25% banagrass juice nutritional supplementation at pH 5. We performed a statistical analysis on our data, which supported these results. By knowing the optimal condition, we will be able to produce larger yields of fungi using less resources. This information can be used to continue to perform research on the use of this fungi as a fish feed ingredient and human nutritional supplement. This project provides the basis for creating a clean and efficient source of biofuel while also creating a possible solution for global malnutrition.

The objective of this study is to test if the interruption of dunes by the presence of intersections,modified the beach profile.<br><br>To corroborate this, after the selections of the samples, some photographs and measurements were take in the select beaches. It was put in use a method which belongs of the Surfrider Foundation of<br><br>California. For measurements of beach profile, they were used two separated graded rulers. These rulers were placed every five meters.<br><br>Then it's necessary to look over the first ruler to find the intersection with the horizon and the second ruler. The procedure was done from the mid-block (foot of dune) or corners (entrance to<br><br>the beach) until the shore.<br><br>The value in meters that every intersection has is which was used to compare the difference between the corners and mid-block.<br><br>This differences were analyzed through a scatter plot, where average heights were observed ranging between 1.68 and 1.87 meters. The results were higher in mid-blocks than in corners in<br><br>the 87.5% of the cases studied. The remaining 12.5% have not big differences, because in these intersections there are infrastructures replacing the dunes, or the dune cordon has not been<br><br>interrupted.<br><br>In conclusion, the absence of planning that respects the natural dynamics of the beach, make the coast cities to lose their main tourist attraction which is the economical resource of the entire area.

Tiago Tolone Craveiro de Oliveira, Adriana Ferreira Santana, 
ETEC Getulio Vargas, Sao Paulo, SP, BRASIL

The incorrect disposal of soybean oil in recent years has caused high rates of air and water pollution. This work presents a possibility of reuse of this used oil in order to reduce environmental pollution, which is the production of alkyd resins. Alkyd resins are used as main components of paint, varnish and all types of coatings and are produced from reactions of polyesterification which polyalcohol, polyacids and vegetable oils.<br><br> Based on reactions and calculations related to the coatings industry, we produced two different percentages of alkyd resins with oil and different reagents. We compared these resins with standard resins (alkyd resin sample of multinational Akzo Nobel - Iguatu division) and the results were very close to the results of production of alkyd resin with unused soybean oil.<br><br> From these resins, we produced samples of different paints and varnishes pigments and additives for the demonstration of the final product synthesized from used soybean oil.The results showed that 1 liter of used soybean oil can produce approximately 2.85 liters of alkyd resin and 7.2 liters of ink.<br><br> From the resins, we produced nine ink colors and one varnish that were analyzed for waterproofing, covering power, weather resistance and brightness. The results were satisfactory and equal to the expected.

ARVO AUTOMATIC RECYCLING OF VEGETABLE OIL: TURNING OIL INTO BIODEGRADABLE SOAP
Allan Soares de Sousa, Líbia Ezagui Torres de Brito, Marcel de Almeida Siqueira
Fundacao Nokia de Ensino, Manaus, AM, BRASIL

The ARVO (Automatic Recycling of Vegetable Oil) machine aims to turn, in an automated way, the vegetable oil used in food preparation in a biodegradable soap. Mostly vegetable oil after use, is thrown away improperly, polluting soils, rivers and streams and generate losses, because it may cause clogging of pipes, sewers boxes, etc. After several studies, we discovered that there is a manual process of transformation of oil into soap. However, this process requires time and use of chemical reagents and it can be done only with small amounts of oil, being a dangerous process, time consuming and impractical for the use of oil in a large scale. Hence, not only to give a correct destination for used oil, preventing pollution and all the losses mentioned, but also to use it profitably and turn it into a biodegradable solution, the existing manual process was automated. We developed the ARVO machine, enabling the production of soap on a large scale and avoiding thousands of gallons of oil to be thrown away into the environment. The machine has a relatively simple operation: the necessary ingredients need to be added to the containers and a button must be presses to start the process. After a few minutes, the ARVO machine produces a mass which after a few hours will dry up resulting in a biodegradable soap.

Global warming is the most concerned issue nowadays. It is believed to be interconnected with secondary hazards like flooding and droughts. At the same time, people do not place much importance in water conservation, increasing the severity of the water shortage problem. Apart from large-scale remedial measures, have we ever thought of measures addressing the problem of water wastage in toilet flushing? When the “3Rs” are taken into considerations, we discovered that reduce, which is seldom preached systematically, is the most environmentally-friendly way to tackle the problem. Addressing this void, a simple technique is introduced for reducing water consumption in flushing.<br><br>It is observed that, for a family of four, flushing toilet bowls contributes to approximately one-third of water consumption, half of which is unnecessary for an effective washout after urination. In dealing with two different types of cistern, two components are designed for users to control the amount of water flushed per time.<br><br>Application of this low-tech yet ingenious invention is simple. Rather than discarding existing toilet bowls wastefully, part of the components would be replaced. Little installation time plus simplicity to use are the two main characteristics of our invention. Neither prior training nor change in our established habits is required. Moreover, its low production cost within one dollar allows our design absolutely affordable by most households, including those in developing countries. The extra cost for replacement could surely be recovered in weeks through the tremendous saving in water bill, not to mention the benefits in environmental protection.

CHROME RECOVERING FROM TANNED SOLID WASTE BY CHEMICAL METHODS
Karla Stephanie Carreno, Alberto Porras Sanjuanico, 
Centro de Bachillerato Tecnico Industrial y de Servicios No. 172, Cortazar, MEXICO

Annually, in the Bajio region 19000 tons of scrape skin are produced. From each ton of hide, 100 to 140 kg of byproduct containing 4% of CrO3 is produced. The solid waste from this process contains hexavalent chrome (highly toxic for the environment and living beings that interact with it). The Bajio region is one of the zones with the greatest production of footwear. Around 30% of hide processed in tanneries is discarded as tanned solid waste. The tanning industry is highly polluting. The solid waste that is produced from this process is confined in landfills causing serious ecological problems because of the volume occupied (136 kg/m3). Scrape skin is highly soluble, so it pollutes groundwater. The objective of this project was recovering chrome from tanned solid waste (scrape skin) from tanneries by chemical methods. This was done by designing a process that helped us to meet environmental technical criteria to implement it in Mexican tanneries. It was accomplished by the implementation of an alkaline or acid hydrolysis and as a future project a chromatographic column filtration method. The obtained results up to now show that in a 5% NaOH concentration and 60°C of temperature, the greatest output of chrome recovered is obtained (79.7361%). It is missing to optimize the purification process of the hydrolyzed of chrome-protein, so chrome can be recycle in industries. This will reduce costs, making a better and feasible process for enterprises without forgetting ecological awareness.

THE EFFECT OF OCEAN ACIDIFICATION AND OIL SPILLS ON EMILIANIA HUXLEYI TRANSPARENT EXOPOLYMER PARTICLES
Mishka Gidwani, Kunal Sangani, 
Neuqua Valley High School, Naperville, IL

Emiliania huxleyi, a coccolithophore species of the North Atlantic, plays an important role in carbon sequestration by secreting a collection of acidic polysaccharides known as Transparent Exopolymer Particles (TEP). These adhesive particles bind coccolithophore cells together, forming aggregates that settle faster through the water column and facilitate the elimination of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This study aims to understand the effect of ocean acidification on the amount of TEP produced and its structural changes, which in turn affect aggregation. Cultures were grown at three different pHs: 7.7, a pH predicted for the next century; 8.0, the current oceanic pH; and 8.3, the pre-industrial pH. Rheological and spectrophotometer measurements were made on these cultures, for both the log and stationary phases of cell growth. These tests showed a positive feedback loop: that with increasing ocean acidification a smaller quanitity of TEP is secreted. This could compound atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. The effect of adding small amounts of crude oil on the aggregate formation process was also studied. This resulted in floating aggregates rather than dense, sinking aggregates. Total Organic Carbon (TOC) analysis suggested that after removing aggregates from solution, the concentration of oil found in solution decreases. This indicates that TEP is able to draw soluble and suspended droplets of oil out of solution and integrate them in floating aggregates. This has applications in oil spill remediation.

Ink is a vital educational writing/drawing material which is used to keep records since ancient civilization. A variety of inks available in the market are usually prepared by hazardous chemicals. Extensive research has been carried out to develop eco-friendly and non toxic ink from natural resources. Fruits of Terminalia chebula, a giant tree growing abundantly in Western Ghats of India have been explored for production of natural ink.<br><br> <br><br>The fruits of T. chebula have been powdered (1.5 kg) and treated with water (1.25 L) and ferric alum (100 gm) for 8 days. The mixture was then filtered, glycerol (5 ml) and acetone (5 ml) were added to the filtrate to obtain the complex dye as the black ink. It was found to be equal or better when compared to the standard writing inks. The ink is non-toxic, clear and hue, non-clogging and with good flow property. It is indelible in water, alcohol and acetone, does not fade under sunlight and maintained constant optical density. Additionally, we have added extracts of Bixa orellana fruits and Clitoria ternatea flowers to the preparation which resulted red and blue inks respectively.<br><br>The ink thus obtained from is an eco-friendly natural product. The ingredients are easy to procure and can be scaled up in an industrial setup. It adds to the low cost natural product and finds application in fountain pens, screen printing, gel refills, ink-jet printing, ball pens, wall painting, coloring, xerox toners and preparation of indelible ink.

Shree P.V Modi High School, Rajkot, Gujarat, INDIA

We have developed a novel and economic way of recycling rexine waste material by separating the fabric and polymeric components using cryogenic grinding technique in a modified kitchen mixer. <br><br>For this we had frozen the rexine waste in liquid nitrogen. Then it was grounded to separate the polymeric material and the cloth fibers. Later the polymeric material was used for making composite sheets and moulded articles. The cloth fibers can be used for several downstream applications.<br><br>We took 100 g rexine waste, washed in hot water, dried in sunlight and cut into small pieces. Then it was taken in a thermocol box and treated with liquid nitrogen for 2-3 min with all possible precautionary measures to make the rexine hard and brittle. The brittle rexine pieces were ground using the modified kitchen mixer for 5 min and sieved (20 meshes/inch) to separate the cloth fibers from the polymeric powder. The polymeric powder was introduced into moulds at 120-130°C for 35-40 minutes and subsequently cooled to fabricate the composite sheets. Cloth fibers were sent for carding or making fiber boards.<br><br>We have introduced different waste fibers like jute wastes, cloth fibers from rexine waste, along with fillers like wooden waste powder etc. to the polymeric powder for improvement of physical properties of the products. The finished products have been evaluated for mechanical and physical properties. Our product finds an immense application in furniture industry and also a substitute for MDF and plywood.

AN INVESTIGATION INTO SEA LETTUCE BRIQUETTES
Muireasa Anne Carroll, Mairead Kingston, Denise Hurley
Sacred Heart Secondary School, Co. Cork, Cork, IRELAND

Excess amounts of Sea Lettuce(marine algae) is growing in the sea near our town. Deposited sea lettuce on once clean sandy beaches causes them to be inaccessible to the public and creates a vile odour as it decomposes. The gas released from the decomposition is toxic to animals and humans and has caused deaths in other parts of the world which have the same problem.Many government bodies have attempted to tackle the problem but they failed to find a solution. It is also a huge problem in Europe, Asia and Australia. This inspired us to try and come up with an idea to solve this problem.We looked at how the sea lettuce could be of benefit instead of a hindrance and investigated if the sea lettuce could be used as a renewable fuel, for a domestic fire(a Sea Lettuce Briquette).Our briquettes were made by collecting sea lettuce from the beaches and washing it in water. We left it to dry in the sun. When it was dried we compressed the sea lettuce using a hydraulic pump and ram. It was then ready to be burned.We found out that the Higher Heating Value (Gross Calorific Value) of our briquettes is 12.34 MJ/kg. In comparison the HHV of wood is 14-17 MJ/kg. Our briquettes have a slightly lower HHV but are much more efficient since they are more environmentally friendly, burn for longer and produce just slightly less heat.We found the moisture content is 24.5% and the ash content is 25.72 %. The elements present in our briquettes are:N: 3.49%,C: 30.22%,H: 7.25%,S: 2.72%.The sulphur and nitrogen levels are low which in turn results in low levels of oxides of sulphur and nitrogen; other common problem gases from fuels.The sea lettuce is also carbon neutral like other biomass fuels. The results suggest that the Sea lettuce Briquettes could be a great solution to a global problem.

CLEAN-UP CREW
Kelly Feather Francis, Zane Madison Ralston, 
Liberal High School, Liberal, KS

In the aftermath of the oil spill off the Gulf of Mexico, two farmers in Florida proposed a method to cleanse the water of the oil efficiently and organically, using hay. However, other scientists claimed that straw, not hay, would be a better absorbent. Straw, hay, and Magic Sand were tested to find which of the three materials cleaned up oil most efficiently. Straw was predicted to have the greatest absorbent capacity because straw is dry and hollow. Using crude oil, salt water, prairie grass hay, a mixture of wheat and rye straw, and store-bought Magic Sand, five trials were conducted. An oil spill scenario was recreated by layering 250mL salt water, 75mL oil and 5.00g of the material being tested in a bowl. On average, hay absorbed 19.07% of the oil, straw absorbed 31.56%, and Magic Sand absorbed 13.33% of the oil. After calculating 95% confidence intervals for each material, straw was found to absorb a statistically significantly larger amount of oil than the other two materials, which supports the hypothesis. In addition to the fact that straw naturally absorbs more oil, straw is also an agricultural byproduct and is therefore cheaper than hay or Magic Sand.

BIODEGRADATION: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE DEGRADATION OF HYDROCARBONS USING ACCLIMATED STRAINS OF A. FAECALIS AND B. CEREUS
Haleigh Tianna Larson
Park Christian School, Moorhead, MN

Biodegradation is a method that proposes to biologically degrade, using the metabolic processes of aboriginal organisms, or render harmless various contaminants to an innocuous state. The bacteria Alcaligenes faecalis and Bacillus cereus exhibit characteristics that make them quintessential remedial species. By acclimating these species to the hydrocarbons, their resistance to and ability to break down the toxins will increase. It is then that the newly acclimated strains of A. faecalis and B. cereus will be tested for their abilites to degrade the toxic hydrocarbons found in oil. Their efficiency, hardiness, and thoroughness when completing their task while in different temperatures (representing intervals in their growing ranges) will be measured using a spectrophotometer. It was hypothesized that the oil-acclimated bacterial strains of A. faecalis and B. cereus would succeed in breaking down the hydrocarbons in the oil, and that the efficiency and thoroughness with which they complete this task will be affected by the different temperature ranges. The experiments set up in the high temperature range (37ºC) were expected to exhibit mediocre degradation of the hydrocarbons in the oil, while those in the middle temperature range (30ºC), the premium results of the degradation of the hydrocarbons in the oil, and those in the low temperature range (25ºC), were to succeed the least in their attempt to degrade the hydrocarbons. Overall, it was expected the results A. faecalis conjured would be exceptional to that of its counterpart, the B. cereus bacterium, because of A. faecalis's tolerance of temperature. Gram negative Alcaligenes faecalis did not respond as well as expected during the acclimation period. While its OD (optical density) readings decreased, the readings taken of gram positive Bacillus cereus increased. However, during the experimental phase, the A. faecalis bacterium began to adapt and flourish in all three temperatures, while the B. cereus bacterium appeared to decline in OD. The original hypothesis was supported. The degradation of the hydrocarbons was affected by the various temperatures and, A. faecalis did, on average, supersede B. cereus with its efficiency in degrading the toxic hydrocarbons found in oil.

INCREASING THE EFFICIENCY OF PETROPHILIC MICROBES
Kern Khanna
University School of Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI

The objective of my study was to analyze the process of algal bioremediation of crude oil holistically. The major goals of this study were to determine the effect of the environment on bioremediation, to examine the effect of bioaugmentation and temperature on algal bioremediation, and to analyze the role that microalgae characteristics have on bioremediation. <br><br>In the first of three tests, I measured the environmental effect on algal bioremediation by creating three apparatuses: an environment with sand, salt water (SW), and crude oil (CO), an environment with soil, SW, and CO, and an environment with just SW and CO. The concentrations of the solutes in the solvent were previously determined and I analyzed the bioremediation success rate by investigating oil degradation and dissolved oxygen loss. In my second test, the methodology was similar as I varied temperature (10 Tests; 0 C-45 C; increments of 5) and I controlled the inorganic nutrient amount that would be added. Lastly, in my third test, I observed the effect of three factors (high motility, chlorophyll type, cellular structure) on bioremediation. <br><br>After further analysis, in my first test, it was determined that the algae in salt water and oil performed more efficiently by a certain factor than those in the sand and soil environments. These results were consistent when the amount of inorganic nutrient or temperature was fluctuated. In my second test, it was concluded that a normal curve approximated the temperature graph for each environment and that ammonium sulfate performed the best in water, soil, and sand. Lastly, in my third test, I derived a non-independent relationship between motility and bioremediation success. Suggesting a dependence may be premature as I continue to conduct this study in the future.

IMPROVING MINE RECLAMATION THROUGH CONTINUING INNOVATION
Travis Cole Sylvester
Greybull High School, Greybull, WY

The process of surface mining is a three step process; permitting, mining, and reclaiming. Of these three, reclaiming might be the most difficult step. Every step of the process, before and after active mining, is scrutinized by state and federal agencies, including the DEQ, OSM, and in some cases also the BLM. This has been the case since 1977 when the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act were passed by Congress. This law requires that all disturbed land be brought back to its original quality and to a condition similar to that of its surroundings. <br><br> Tests were performed to determine the levels of herbicides and pesticides in the Big Horn National Lake, the most beneficial indentation for snow collection and erosion control, and cooperative field research was continued from previous years testing. All testing followed same testing protocol in respect to test. <br><br> The results produced presented that there is no detectable levels of chemical compounds in the lake sedimentation. This makes the silt eligible to be used on mine reclamation. It was also proven that the “U” pit is the most beneficial for the desired out comes. Finally the field test yielded the results that soil amendments can help plant growth in field sites. <br><br> In an effort to further enhance the results from all research completed there has been an amendment book and amendment flow chart constructed. These will allow for the benefits of soil amendments to be in an easily readable format.

PHOTOBIOREACTOR FOR CARBON ABSORPTION: AN EQUIPMENT FOR THE NEUTRALIZATION OF CO2 EMISSIONS IN DOMESTIC ENVIRONMENTS
Victor Marelli Thut
Colegio Dante Alighieri, Sao Paulo, BRASIL

Carbon dioxide is one of the main causes of global climate change. Each year approximately 10 billion tons of CO2 are launched into the atmosphere. As photosynthetic microorganisms grow and absorb CO2 rapidly, they can be useful for carbon sequestration. In addition, their advantageous characteristics can be optimized with the cultivation in photobioreactors. My project aims to absorb and store CO2 in domestic environments using a photobioreactor developed by me. My hypothesis is that my equipment could neutralize people’s carbon emissions, contributing to a reduction of atmospheric CO2. When applied to a home-situation, equipment’s users will calculate their CO2 emission on my website. In the optimization process, different prototypes were designed, built, and tested. When a Synechococcus nidulans (Cyanobacteria) strain was cultivated in my equipment, it was able to absorb approximately 0.7 gram of CO2 per gram of biomass, with the population doubling every 4.3 days. After the absorption of CO2 it must be stored to defer the climate changes. For this, I’ve incorporated the cyanobacteria in industrial floors made with epoxy resins, thus, ensuring an effective carbon sequestration without damaging the material. After that, I conducted a market research to verify the acceptance of the product. The research has shown that people would have a photobioreactor at home, and the acceptance would be even greater if the costs of the equipment were lower. So far, tests have shown that with further improvements the photobioreactor would be ready for implantation, possibly helping to attenuate the climate changes.

YEAR THREE: DETERMINING THE MOST EFFECTIVE RADON-RESISTANT HOME FEATURES
Rachel Ann Hodge
Plano Senior High School, Plano, TX

Radon gas is a naturally occurring radioactive gas which reaches high levels in buildings. The U.S. E.P.A. states radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer, causing the deaths of 21,000 people annually in the U.S. After a two-year study of radon gas mitigation system efficiency, this year’s project compares the abilities of radon-resistant home features to reduce radon. These included slab-on-grade (SoG), basement/crawlspace (B/C), and pier home foundations, as well as a gas-permeable layer (GPL) and sealing and caulking (S/C). These features were tested using a model house with a visible substitute for radon gas, dipropylene glycol vapor, which allowed more thorough data to be collected than in a real building. Each home foundation method was tested in isolation and combined with the GPL, S/C, or both simultaneously, with 3 trials per variable. A photograph was taken after 2 minutes of vapor circulation with the home feature, then enhanced using Photoshop’s “Replace Color” function which increased visual contrast between vapor densities. These photographs were analyzed using a set of criteria based on indicators of how far vapor circulation had progressed, including visible vapor and specific vapor cloud shapes. Based on this criteria, it was concluded that the most effective combination of variables was the pier foundation, GPL, and S/C, with vapor completely mitigated in all trials. The most effective single method was the pier foundation. This experiment provides valuable data regarding the risk levels of houses for radon gas, which has a significant impact on public health.

CHLORELLA VULGARIS AS AN AGENT OF BIOREMEDIATION
Tarini Chandok
Fort Myers High School, Fort Myers, FL

The purpose of this experiment was to determine if Chlorella vulgaris can be used to cleanse the water of phosphate. My hypothesis stated that Chlorella vulgaris will have a positive effect. Bioremediation is the use of natural occurring substances to cleanse by bio-degradation. <br><br> The procedure is as follows: Gather all materials, and then create a standard curve graph. Next autoclave all materials and sterilize lab area, now create a stock solution based on the concentrations of your choice. Once you choose your 6 concentrations, which in my experiment was 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, and 10 parts per million. Separate the stock into the mason jars that should have 20 ml of water already. This creates a dilution of the concentration mimicking the oceans different turn over rates. Then filter a set amount everyday so the algae and water are separated to test the phosphate level. This you will do by using the La Motte Test Kit which will then show you the change from the initial amount. Then Collect, Record and Conclude your data.<br><br> The data gathered from my experiment showed that the hypothesis was proven correct. Chlorella can be used as an agent of Bioremediation. The greater amount of Phosphate present, the greater amount of phosphate was drawn out. This project shows that Bioremediation can be beneficial to our oceans, rather than using chemicals to solve environmental problems such as Eutrophication.

FEASIBILITY STUDY OF UTILIZING GRASS, DANDELIONS, AND LEAVES IN PAPERMAKING
Lisa X. Fu
John Marshall High School, Rochester, MN

The Kraft process is the most popular method of pulp and paper production, producing nearly 85% of all pulp in the United States. However, the chief disadvantages compromise of low pulp yield and extremely excessive consumption of toxic chemicals and water, thus consequently making the process very complex and expensive. In the present study, a sustainable method of manufacturing paper was investigated by reducing the chemical input as well as introducing non-timber, cellulose-rich materials that promote conservation of forests. Grass, dandelions, and leaves were boiled in differing concentrations of sodium hydroxide solutions and the resulting paper was analyzed through a series of tests measuring grammage, bulk, formation, absorbency, and tear resistance. Data showed that the grammage and bulk of dandelion paper was statistically similar to copy paper (80-90 g/m2; 112 micrometer thickness), while grass paper was similar to newsprint (40-50 g/m2; 70-80 micrometer thickness). Leaf paper resembled cardboard (250-300 g/m2; 200 micrometer thickness). Leaf paper in general was the most absorbent and strongest (tear resistant) paper. This proposes that grass-, dandelion-, and leaf-pulping procedures could be further engineered for papers with a specific attribute like tensile strength or tear resistance, while also saving more CO2 “sinks” (trees) for the environment.

INFLUENCE OF GENETIC VARIATION OF BRAZILIAN PEPPERTREE (SCHINUS TEREBINTHIFOLIUS) ON THE SURVIVAL OF A BIOLOGICAL CONTROL AGENT, PSEUDOPHILOTHRIPS ICHINI
Neha Kambam Reddy
Lincoln Park Academy, Fort Pierce, FL

Brazilian peppertree is one of the most commonly found invasive species in Florida. Deemed a major threat to native species, current management techniques are only temporary and are not cost-effective. Originally from Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay, the two main genotypes (pure A and pure B) have hybridized quickly in Florida, producing two more genotypes (hybrid A and hybrid B). A promising biological control agent, a host-specific natural enemy, Pseudophilothrips ichini was found in Salvador, Brazil feeding on Brazilian peppertree pure B. The objective of this study wad to evaluate the performance of thrips adults and their progeny when exposed to different plant genotypes, specifically adult fecundity and larval development. Results from this study will provide baseline information about the biology of P. ichini and its potential to be used as a biological control agent of Brazilian peppertree in Florida. <br><br> To determine adult fecundity, thrips adults are exposed to either Brazilian peppertree pure A or Brazilian peppertree pure B (20 adults per plant; 4 replicates of each genotype) for a 20-day period. The total number of larvae produced per plant (F1 generation) was recorded. To determine larval development, first instars obtained from pure A or pure B plants (Experiment 1) were exposed to the following treatments (30 larvae per plant; 4 replicates per treatment): 1) Brazilian peppertree pure A, 2) Brazilian peppertree pure B, 3) Brazilian peppertree hybrid A, and 4) Brazilian peppertree hybrid B. Survival to adult and time development to adult were recorded. Leaf samples from each plant were obtained and placed in 95% EtOH for genetic analysis. <br><br> Pseudophilothrips ichini fecundity was affected by plant genotype. Adults produced more larvae on genotype pure B than on pure A. This may translate to higher densities of thrips on Brazilian peppertree pure B in field studies. Larval development was partially influenced by plant genotype. Percent survival showed no differences along plant genotypes. However, time of development to adult was lower on Brazilian peppertree pure B than on hybrid A plants. Therefore, development of immature stages of thrips will occur fastest when feeding on pure B plants.

DUCKWEED'S SALTY: A THIRD YEAR STUDY OF DUCKWEED AND A NOVEL APPROACH TO DESALINATION
Sharjeel Ahmed Syed
The National Society of Black Engineers, Converse, TX

Most water on earth is inaccessible to us; so to increase water supply, desalination plants are used to turn salt water into drinkable water. This study's purpose is to utilize a plant, Duckweed, to desalinate water in a novel approach. Simultaneously, this process is connected to the use of Duckweed to remediate waste water. <br><br> Four tanks filled with tap water were introduced to controlled amounts of iodized table salt and Miracle Grow, incorporating sodium and chemicals in different combinations to test each of the three hypotheses. One tank was the control, containing both the Miracle Grow and Iodized salt, while the other three were introduced to Duckweed and used for the experimental group. Duckweed’s capabilities of decreasing salt concentrations were tested in two of the tanks. One of these two tanks was introduced to Miracle Grow as well to observe this process along with chemical uptake, the proposed treatment model in this study. The fourth tank was used as a constant to observe Duckweed growth and biomass increase as a result of salt uptake.<br><br> Where chemicals were not added the average sodium decrease was 40% supporting Duckweed’s capabilities to treat salt. However, where chemicals were also introduced, Duckweed decreased sodium concentrations on average by 80% and all other chemical concentrations on average by at least 95%. Overall, it could be concluded that Duckweed can be an effective desalination agent and highly beneficial and revolutionary to modern treatment plants.

POP GOES THE DIESEL: A LINOLEIC ACID/R. RHODOCHROUS MIXTURE AS A BIOREMEDIATION AGENT OF DIESEL CONTAMINANTS IN CONTAMINANTS IN SALTWATER AND FRESHWATER ENVIRONMENTS
Morgan Walker Sinko
John Jay Science and Engineering Academy, San Antonio, TX

Linoleic acid and R. rhodochrous, a polyunsaturated fatty acid and a bacteria respectively, were developed into a bioremediation tool by the student researcher. During years 2 and 3 of the study, this mixture proved effective against oil contamination in a variety of soil types. The purpose of this experiment was to verify and compare the effectiveness of the mixture as a bioremediation agent of diesel contaminants in freshwater and saltwater environments.<br><br> Four 37.84 L tanks were filled with 28.5L of salt water and four tanks were filled with an equal amount of freshwater. Each of the containers was spiked with 50ml of diesel fuel. One tank of each water type remained untreated, acting as a control, while the others were treated with the mixture. Tanks were aerated to provide oxygen and simulate waves. Samples were taken from the surface of each container by hand on days 1, 2, 7, 14 and 21, and analyzed in a GC/MS. The levels of Heptadecane 2-6-dimethyl were then compared to Heptadecane, which were then compared to the control to find a ratio of change throughout the samples. <br><br> The saltwater showed a range of 42-50% remediation by the end of the experiment, while freshwater samples remediated at a final range of 64-79%. In conclusion, the data not only supported both hypothesis A (that mixture would be effective in water) and B (that it would be more effective in fresh water than salt water), but also showed signs of remediating pre-existing plastics contamination from the water.

COMPUTER-BASED SIMULATION OF DAILY FLUCTUATIONS IN OXYGEN CONTENT IN CARP PONDS
Fabian David Scherer
Gymnasium Hochstadt an der Aisch, Hochstadt an der Aisch, Bavaria, GERMANY

Successful commercial carp farming depends heavily on maintaining a consistent oxygen saturation level in the water. As such, this project tackles the question of whether it is possible to simulate the daily fluctuations in oxygen content in carp ponds.<br><br>In the first instance, the five main factors which influence oxygen content were established from existing literature on the subject: 1) Oxidation of nitrogen compounds 2) Oxygen consumption in bottom sediment 3) Breakdown of dissolved organic matter 4) Carp and plant respiration 5) Photosynthetic aeration 6) Atmospheric aeration. <br><br>Subsequently formulas were defined to quantitatively determine the influence of these factors. These formulas were then implemented in a program which simulates fluctuations in oxygen content by means of iterative differential processes.<br><br>In order to verify the simulated results, the next step was to record four parameters within two carp ponds over a period of 24 hours: 1) Wind speed 2) Solar radiation 3) Water temperature 4) Oxygen content. In addition, the chlorophyll content, fish population density and water volume of the pond were determined. <br><br>The tendential development of the simulated daily curves corresponds with those measured. The maximum and minimum values of both curves were consistent over time. The percentage deviation of the simulated and measured values was always significantly below 10%. As such the simulation gives a realistic representation of fluctuations.<br><br>The program ensures a drastic reduction of effort in terms of measurement, allowing fish farmers to monitor their ponds more comprehensively whilst incurring decreased outlay in terms of time and money.

ATMOSPHERIC CO2 SCRUBBING, PHASE TWO
Tyler Miguel Knapton
Grants High School, grants, NM

The purpose of this experiment is to develop a more efficient method of absorbing CO2 from an atmosphere. The hypothesis is that CO2 scrubbing efficiency can be increased with improvement in sequestration methods. Through testing perhaps it will be proven that Atmospheric CO2 Scrubbing is indeed economically feasible.<br><br>First, a filter testing platform was designed and developed to hold CO2 filters in place. In the experiments lithium hydroxide (LiOH), a chemical with the property of absorbing CO2, was applied to air filters to increase the surface area of the LiOH. A second step of activated carbon canisters were later added to test for increased adsorption.<br><br>It was concluded that the LiOH filters are about 247% more efficient than LiOH alone in a sealed chamber. It is believed the increased efficiency is caused by increased surface area. This is a huge increase in efficiency, thus proving the hypothesis. Unfortunately, the corrosive properties of the LiOH caused a breakdown in a seal supporting an activated carbon canister. This caused the experiment of a 2-step filter to be cut short and the data inconclusive.

Hard tungsten based superalloys are widely used in civil (cutters, drills etc) and military (cores of armor-piercing projectiles) engineering. Due to the significant production costs and value of such alloys, the main purpose of our investigation was development of strategy for complete superalloy recycling: obtaining Ni/Co and W/WC powders from wasted or damaged alligation that can be reused in superalloy production.<br><br>Aims: 1. Study of different superalloys anodic behavior to obtain parameters for selective anode electrolysis dissolution of the metal-bond and to define parameters for obtaining pure Ni powder suitable for further superalloy production; 2. to construct of pilot electrolyzer and test electrolysis conditions.<br><br>Superalloys anode behavior was studied by volammogram in theoretically defined media (HCl 9-30%). Ni/Co powders were obtained by cathode deposition from metal-ammonia solution with/without Trilon B addition and studied by HRSEM. Testing of the selective treatment for superalloys was carried out in pilot electrolyzer specially constructed for the project.<br><br> Potential intervals for metal-bond dissolution were identified from anodic curves with unoxidised tungsten/tungsten carbide for all studied superalloys. Most passive superalloy W-Ni-Fe was activated in rotating device. Obtained Ni/Co powder showed fractal morphology and particle size 35-50μm under optimal conditions (i=50-100 A/cm2, t=15-30°C). Innovative addition of Trilon B improves particle morphology and milling properties.<br><br>Important advantages of proposed technology: 1. Full recycling of all superalloy components with high economical efficiency; 2) direct separation of W/WC powders suitable for superalloy production; 3) Ni/Co powders may be obtained from any containing waste source by metal hydroxide intermediate product.

WATER IN, WATER OUT: USING A WATER BALANCE MODEL TO ESTIMATE NET CONSUMPTIVE AVAILABILITY
Johanna Lynne Phillips
Monte Vista Senior High School, Monte Vista, CO

The purpose of this experiment was to provide an inventory of water that is entering and exiting different hydrologic systems. With this inventory, water management specialists can better predict the consumptive availability of water from a drainage basin. To determine the net water consumptive availability within a drainage basin, water quantity inputs (precipitation, surface water, and groundwater) and water quantity outputs (evapotranspiration, surface water outflow, and groundwater outflow) for three watersheds had to be measured and included in a water balance model, Q= P - ET - dS/dt – L. Where P, precipitation for Watersheds #1 and #2 was collected from the Ute Creek NRCS SNOTEL site and precipitation for Watershed #3 was collected from the Zirkel SNOTEL site; ET, evapotranspiration was measured in all three watersheds with an ETgage; dS/dt or change in storage over time was measured using soil moisture sensors and soil characteristic curves; and L, deep percolation was measured using observation wells in Watersheds #1 and #2, and a known percentage of 3% of the precipitation in Watershed #3 was used. The net consumptive availability for each basin was: <br><br>Watershed #1 Ratio: 894 AF/1710 Acres = 0.52 AF / Acre<br><br>Watershed #2 Ratio: 247 AF / 380 Acres = 0.65 AF / Acre<br><br>Watershed #3 Ratio: 4,798 AF/1770 Acres = 2.72 AF / Acre<br><br>This research demonstrates that by accounting for water quantity inputs and outputs in a watershed system, then a net consumptive availability can be calculated; and the methodology could potentially be used for more accurate snow runoff forecasting.

DEGRADATION OF MIB AND GEOSMIN THROUGH PHOTOCATALYSIS FOR USE IN AQUACULTURE
Amanda C. Holly
Sarasota High School, Sarasota, FL

Overfishing is a major problem and extremely pertinent to today’s world. Aquaculture is combating this problem; however, aquaculture is far from infallible. In aquaculture systems, large quantities of fish produce a high density of fecal matter, forming bacteria that degrade most of it. 2-methylisoborneal (MIB) and Geosmin are two off-flavor compounds, produced by bacteria during the decomposition of other organics and absorbed into the fish. They are not medically harmful to humans, but give the fish a musty/earthy taste rendering fish unmarketable. This study utilized scientific techniques and chemical engineering to synthesize a photocatalyst designed to decrease the concentration of methyl orange (MO) in a solution. MO is used in place of the MIB and Geosmin because of testing ease (MO is an indicator) and due to the fact that MO, MIB, and Geosmin are comparable through their chemical structures and properties. The degradation was tested by using different ratios of TiO2 to InVO4 to Ni in the photocatalyst. The different rations included 1wt% with and without Ni, 5wt% with and without Ni, and 10wt% with and without Ni. It was hypothesized that the 5 weight % sample with nickel would produce the most decomposition of MO in the least amount of time because this ratio will have just enough InVO4 to be able to produce the reactions in the visible light range as well as just enough nickel to keep the electrons energized and from falling back down to the conduction band. This was supported through experimentation, the 5wt% with nickel produced the most decomposition in the least amount of time.

SHOWING THE EFFECTS OF ALUM AND EUTROPHICATION ON ALGAL GROWTH
William George Meisner
J.W. Mitchell High School, New Port Richey, FL

Eutrophication of phosphate in bodies of water leads to an excess amount of phosphorus, which causes algal blooms. These blooms are often dangerously sprayed with poisons to limit their growth. If growth is not controlled, however, the blooms will eventually deplete the level of oxygen in the water- destroying the ecosystem. Already, alum has been accredited to managing sediment layer phosphate release. Instead of demonstrating that, this study’s purpose was to see if alum could limit algal growth that occurs from excess phosphate levels due to cultural eutrophication, without poisons.<br><br>To simulate this, five milliliters of algae were added to nine cuvettes. Then, the nine cuvettes were put into three groups, with three cuvettes in each. Each group held either zero, two or four drops of alum per cuvette. Within each group, each cuvette also had zero, one, or two drops of phosphate added. Nine trials of this were set up under a fluorescent light. Over several days, the absorbencies of the cuvettes were measured with a spectrophotometer to find the rate (absorbency/hour) of the algal growth.<br><br>The experimental data showed that as alum was added to the water, the rate that the algae grew decreased. The standard deviations of the trial rates were low (Most were below .00100) compared to their means (most were below .0035 abs/hr). The data supports that alum can limit excess algal growth (from cultural eutrophication) by binding with the extra phosphate. If standardized, alum solutions could safely limit algal growth, without using poisons.

IS GRASS GREENER THAN YOU THINK?
Alisah Grace Sexton
Hope Christian School, Sulphur, LA

Objective<br><br>The purpose of this project is to determine the highest ratio of Bermuda grass to used copy paper that could create usable recycled paper. This is important because it would allow the paper industry to reduce the amount of trees cut down for their use.<br><br>Method<br><br>For this experiment I followed the process outlined in the procedure to create the samples. Then I tested each sample in three categories. First I wrote on the samples with an ink pen. Then I checked to see that the samples could be run through a printer. Finally I wrote on each sample with a marker. After these tests were conducted, I rated the results on a scale of 1-5. I then took these numbers and averaged the results to determine the suitability of each ratio.<br><br>Conclusion<br><br>I found that my hypothesis was correct. Fifty percent grass was the highest suitable ratio. This means that if the paper industry substituted 50% of the paper pulp for grass the number of trees used would drop from four billion to two billion. This would be beneficial because it would increase sustainability. This is necessary to help stop soil erosion and increase air quality.

TOMATO INDUCED DDT DISAPPEARANCE
William John O'Brochta
Roanoke Valley Governor's School, Roanoke, VA

This project was designed to determine whether brt (bushy root) mutated tomato plants phytoremediate more than wild-type plants and if phytoremediation has any detrimental health effects on both types of plants. The hypothesis was that plants that have been genetically mutated to increase root length and size will phytoremediate more effectively with greater negative health effects when 1.50 grams (g) of Kelthane is applied than wild-type tomato plants. Phytoremediation ability was measured using a mustard bioassay. Plant health was determined by measuring chlorophyll concentration, leaf area, plant height, Brix concentration, plant dry mass, and root wet mass analysis. Results indicated that the hypothesis was not supported as the bioassay showed that autoclaved soil alone removed 0.384 g of Kelthane, while the mutated plants removed 0.537 g, and the wild-type removed 1.140 g out of the 1.50 g added. The wild-type plants removed significantly more Kelthane than the mutated plants. Health of the mutated plants was better overall. Mutant plants had a significantly greater increase in leaf area, 123% for those with Kelthane, when compared to a -5.16% for wild-type plants undergoing phytoremediation. Plants that were not phytoremediating increased leaf area at a steadier 41% to 61% rate. Percent change in plant height showed that mutant plants grew taller without Kelthane (275%, 166%), while wild-type plants were significantly taller when phytoremediating (279%, 234%). The characteristics of the mutation show that high sucrose levels in the mutation lower phytoremediation. Thus, decreasing sucrose levels by increasing acid invertase levels should increase phytoremediation.

AN EVALUATION OF TANNINS AND THEIR METAL ADSORPTION PROPERTIES FOR THE REMEDIATION OF WASTEWATER
Kirsten Rae Perry
Elko High School, Elko, NV

The ability of tannins to remediate wastewater via metal adsorption was evaluated. Samples of acid mine drainage (AMD) with copper levels of 3.9ppm and a pH of 4 were collected from the Rio Tinto Mine for experimentation. Two methods were utilized for wastewater remediation. During the first protocol, an immobilized tannin gel was formed using formaldehyde as a cross linking agent. AMD was added to the tannin-formaldehyde gel, and copper measurements were monitored. Since the gel dissolved in solution, no decrease in the AMD’s copper concentrations was measured.<br><br>During the second protocol, a commercially available gelatin was fixed, modified by silicon dioxide and glutaraldehyde. Tannin powder was mixed into an AMD solution, and the solution was passed through the gelatin. Tannins precipitated out after contacting the gelatin’s collagen proteins and copper levels of the AMD decreased from 3.9ppm to approximately 1ppm. Four variations of the silicon dioxide-glutaraldehyde gelatin were tested for optimal copper reduction and pH increase in the waste water; these variations included fixing gelatins with distilled water or phosphate buffer, and adding 4g or 8g of gelatin powder. Greatest pH increases occurred in samples run through phosphate buffer-containing gelatins, and greatest copper reduction occurred in samples run through gelatins made with 8g of gelatin powder.<br><br>Based on data collected from control groups, it was determined that the tannins present in the solution were not responsible for reducing copper levels. Instead, proteins present in the gelatin were binding to copper ions in the solution, causing copper levels to decrease.

USING OXIDATION TO AN ADVANTAGE: PURIFYING WASTES AND PRODUCING ELECTRICITY
Tushar Mittal
Dutchtown High School, Hampton, GA

The purpose of this project is to observe which of the following samples - fish tank water or benthic mud, would produce the most efficient amount of electricity using a microbial fuel cell? In this project, the scientist constructed a home-made microbial fuel cell (MFC) to create a sustainable environment for the desired bacteria, Acidithiobacillus thiooxidan which is found in the samples, to be able to oxidize the agar solution via the processes of oxidation and reduction. It is hypothesized that if each MFC receives the same amount of oxygen from the air pumps, then the MFC with the benthic mud sample will produce the most electricity out of the three MFCs. The amount of electricity generated by the samples is measured in millivolts. The voltage is measured by placing leads of the multimeter on the resistors to obtain readings. Electricity levels in the benthic mud reached 742.7 mv, 355.7 mv in one month old fish tank water and 61.9 mv in tap water. The MFC design used produces electricity and also simultaneously decrease the turbidity in the samples in great amounts. This experiment will have a revolutionary impact on the production of electricity, especially in under-developed countries which are struggling to survive due to the lack of resources to produce hydroelectric power or any other power source. However, with the abundance of reserves such as mud and fish polluted water, which are both inexpensive, makes this idea one of the best alternative concerning waste management and electricity production.

BAILEY: IMPROVING BTEX DETECTION USING MEMBRANE-INTRODUCTION MASS SPECTROMETRY (MIMS)
Jianing Jenny He
Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science, Denton, TX

Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX) are volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that dissolve easily into the air, soil, and water. Exposure can result in detrimental acute and chronic effects on human health, including skin irritation, reproduction mutations, and leukemia. BTEX substances originate from petroleum products and are present in daily life. The Occupational Health & Safety Administration (OSHA) has set permissible exposure limits (PEL) for each BTEX compound, but current detection options are not very sensitive. Mass spectrometry is much more capable of identifying components (like BTEX) in unknown compounds. To allow for real-time detection, a piece of siloxane membrane tubing was stretched over inlet of an Inficon Transpector® CPM. This instrument was chosen for its transportability. Acetonitrile was used as a substitute for benzene in tests examining the reaction rate. It was determined that reaction rate is independent of concentration; an oddity was also seen in that the time for the complete exit of analyte was about three times the time for the analyte to be detected after its introduction to the inlet. The limit of detection (LOD) was also tested using various concentrations of toluene; the absolute LOD was determined by an iterative process. Using this iterative process, it was then determined that electron multipliers, with an LOD of 122 ppb, proved an order of magnitude more sensitive than the Faraday cup, with an LOD of about 3.6 ppm, but also shorter-lived. Important figures of merit were examined and the development of a potentially powerful instrument began.

CUTTING DOWN CRUDE: AN INGENIOUS CONCEPT
Justin Nicholas Krell
Plankinton High School, Plankinton, SD

Good fuel economy depends on many things, including clean motor oil. With that last point in mind, I built two devices that can notify a motorist when to change his or her oil. The first of these is an analog monitor that I call Brightstick. Later, I replaced Brightstick with a digital version called DIPstick. Both devices employ a photocell to detect the particulate matter in motor oil. When the oil darkens to a given point, the driver is told the ideal moment for an oil change. This should not be too early for then good motor oil is being wasted. But if you change your oil too late, your engine will suffer additional wear and friction causing a loss of fuel efficiency.<br><br>To determine the ideal moment for changing oil, I have used the Beer-Lambert Law which relates the absorption of light passing through a medium to the properties of that medium. In both of my devices, light from an LED passes through a small chamber filled with motor oil to reach a photocell. The more foreign particulate matter within the motor oil, the less light is received by the photocell. In DIPstick, a microcomputer receives an electrical current from the photocell and converts it into a dashboard display that can inform a motorist when an oil change is immanent. This allows the ordinary driver to take a proactive approach to engine wear.

PLASTIC RECYCLING: SINK OR SWIM?
Nicholas Carl Treuil
Clear Brook High School, Friendswood, TX

Current recycling efforts take too much manpower. As a result, purchasing virgin plastic costs manufacturers less money than buying recycled materials. This experiment was to see if recycling costs could be reduced using a separation column to sort plastics by density first. I compared the density of the seven most commonly used plastics to several common liquids. Then, I tested each plastic in a liquid with a similar density. If the plastic hovered in the liquid, I used it in the column. If the plastic either floated or sank, I tested a different liquid. The column was made by placing the most dense liquid on the bottom, the second most dense liquid next, continuing up to the top layer. I conducted six trials. Of the 42 samples tested, 11.9% were found in a liquid with a different density. This meant different plastic types were being mixed in the layers, something recycling companies would find unacceptable. Of the plastics found in a liquid with a similar density, 21.4% were at the top or the bottom of the liquid rather than hovering in it. This would raise concerns about the possibility of plastics from different layers getting mixed when siphoning the liquids. Since HDPE (density 0.95 to 0.97 g/ml) and PETE (density 1.38 to 1.39 g/ml) are by far the two most commonly recycled plastics further experimentation should focus on them. With a larger separation column, different liquids, and the possibility of developing a multi-stage process, this idea should be retested.

MYCOREMEDIATION OF PCB SOIL CONTAMINANTS WITH PLEUROTUS OSTREATUS
Mallory Claire Madfes
Greenwich High School, Greenwich, CT

Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) are remarkably stable compounds. Their resilience in the environment is of major concern due to their damaging effects on humans. Current cases of PCB contamination in soil require one of three costly methods of remediation; soil is unearthed to an off-site location with high temperature incineration, microbial degradation through reductive dechlorination of the biphenyl skeleton, and chemical degradation via electron transfer to form PCB anions. Mycoremediation may offer a cheap, thorough, and noninvasive alternative to these methods. Previous studies have investigated the effects of Pleurotus ostreatus (PO) in the remediation of PCB contaminated liquids, with some success for low and moderate contamination. This research instead focuses on use of PO fungus in the mycoremediation of PCB’s in a controlled soil-like medium. 1000 ppm Aroclor 1016 was added to 4 g of pre-cultivated PO in pine sawdust, which contained 2.4% fungus, 69.8% water, and the remaining sawdust. An extraction method was created to reliably recover PCB content from the sawdust mixture; 0.2 g of contaminated fungal sawdust was mixed with 0.5 ml of hexane for 10 min, followed by filtration. Gas chromatography (Flame Ionization Detection) was used to measure the PCB content of soil with PO fungus. Results indicate that the PCB concentration in untreated sawdust remained constant over time, while those chambers with a thriving PO colony showed as ~ 60% reduction in PCB content in 1 day. In five days of PO treatment, as much as 99.6% of the original load of 1000 ppm Aroclor 1016 was remediated, with only 4 ppm remaining. The rate of remediation per load of PO in the soil-like medium was determined to be 24.4 ppm PCB per day, per gram of PO, within 1 kg of soil.

INVESTIGATING THE POTENTIAL FOR CUPRIAVIDUS METALLIDURANS AND DELFTIA ACIDOVORANS AS TOOLS FOR HEAVY METAL BIOREMEDIATION
Zachary Christopher Ballinger
Loudoun County Academy of Science, Sterling, VA

A geological study has shown that a bacterial biofilm consisting of Cupriavidus metallidurans and Delftia acidovorans found on Australian gold nuggets can precipitate the gold out of the surrounding soil into pure gold nuggets. Gold is one of many heavy metals that are highly toxic and pose a threat to humans. Recent studies have shown that C. metallidurans can precipitate gold out of solution. Genetically modified C. metallidruans can precipitate mercury out of solution. D. acidovorans carries the same metal resistance genes as C. metallidurans. A bacterial culture containing both species of bacterium was created. Gold, copper or iron (heavy metals) were added to the culture. The concentration of metal was then analyzed over time spectrophotometrically using colorimetric reagents. Data was gathered in the form of percent decrease in absorbance over time. A t-Test comparing the percent change in absorbance data from the gold trials with the percent change in absorbance data from the copper trials and found that these two data sets are statistically similar. A one tailed t-Test shows that the percent change in absorbance seen in the iron trials is statistically greater than the percent change in absorbance data from the copper/gold trials combined. Based on the data and this statistical analysis, it can be concluded that a combined culture of C. metallidurans and D. acidovorans can remove gold, copper, and iron from solution, and has a greater effect on iron than on either copper or gold. Therefore, Cupriavidus metallidurans and Delftia acidovorans are excellent tools for the bioremediation of heavy metals.

TIO2 NANOTUBES AS CATALYST FOR PHOTOCATALYTIC DEGRADATION OF TEXTILE DYES
Gabriel Lucio de Oliveira
Instituto Federal de Educacao, Ciencia e Tecnologia de Goias - Campus Inhumas, Inhumas, GO, BRASIL

Environmental pollution is a major problem in the world. Among all types of pollution, water contamination causes more concern, because the demand is increasing and water quality is being degraded at an alarming rate. The textile industry has been recognized for their high pollution through dyes that are disposed in the water resources with an intense color. This color can interfere the photosynthetic processes of rivers, altering the balance of aquatic environments. Fortunately environmentally sound decontamination methods are currently being researched. In this scientific research, I used methods to photodegrade dyes using as photocatalysts, the TiO2 nanotubes or TiO2 anatase. I degraded the 1,0 × 10-5 mol/L dye solution within a photo-reactor with 1,0 g/L of a catalyst during a period of 90 minutes. I compared the photocatalytic activities of both catalysts. The TiO2 anatase, surpassed the photodegradation efficiency of TiO2 nanotubes. I recycled the semiconductors, and I found that the photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 nanotubes remained at 90% of dye degraded after 5 catalytic cycles, whereas the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 anatase reduced to 10% of dye degraded after 5 cycles catalytic. I perfomed toxicity studies, and I found that using the semiconductors not only discolors the water, but generates products with lower toxicity. I realized conductivity measurements , and I noticed that the conductivity of the solution increased due to the formation of salts during the degradation process. I conclude that the heterogeneous photocatalysis are effective in the treatment of textile effluents.

BIOMINERALIZATION OF CALCIUM-BASED PLANT CRYSTALS AS A MODEL FOR PHYTOREMEDIATION
Haley Roman Sproull
Niles North High School, Skokie, IL

Strontium-90 (Sr-90) is among the most harmful components of nuclear waste. The biochemical similarity between calcium (Ca) and Sr results in the indiscriminate transport of Sr2+ and Ca2+ in biological processes, causing the deposition of Sr-90 in the bones and bone marrow. This experiment aims to: 1) determine whether two Ca oxalate forming plants, Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) and Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato), are equally successful in sequestering proof-of-concept, nonradioactive Sr and 2) determine which Sr-nutrient solution enables the highest rate of Ca oxalate crystallization. <br><br>Tobacco and tomato plants were treated with Sr-nutrient solutions of varying concentrations relative to Ca (0X, 2X, 5X, 10X). Plant crystals, obtained via repeated centrifugation, and organic leaf tissue were analyzed using microscopy and spectroscopy. Plant crystal birefringence was detected using polarized microscopy. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) generated images of plant crystals while energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) generated elemental spectra of plant crystals and organic tissue. Attenuated total reflectance (ATR) Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) confirmed the presence Ca oxalate crystals. <br><br>Data supported the hypothesis for tomato plants only. Tomato treated with Sr-nutrient solution concentrations higher than 0X consistently contained larger amounts of Ca oxalate crystals. It was found that the amount of crystals formed in tomato is parabolically proportional to the Sr-nutrient solution concentration. A possible explanation for this occurrence may be that tomato has a Sr sequestration threshold. Tobacco did not form crystals nor sequester Sr. Although tomato plants appeared to have a threshold, they were still successful in sequestering strontium.

IMPROVING SEAWATER DESALINATION
Amy Jaya Vallis
School Without Walls, Washington, DC

Seawater desalination is a relatively new technology that holds tremendous promise as an alternative to freshwater. The purpose of this experiment is to design and build a personal system that is energy efficient and can effectively desalinate water that can be marketed to low-income coastal communities who do not have access to freshwater. The current systems of desalination (distillation and reverse osmosis, in particular) are not energy efficient and produce minimal volumes of freshwater. However, by combining distillation, an ionic reverse osmosis membrane, and natural sediment, and also by using solar energy, a higher volume of freshwater can be produced. For this experiment, these different types of desalination were altered and combined to create a small-scale desalination system. Each component was tested separately and then installed in a larger system. The sediments reduced salinity by 28%. The solar desalination reduced total salinity by 41%, while the RO membrane reduced salinity by 2%. The total combined salinity reduced by the new system averaged 70%. Ocean water—saltwater—has an average salinity of 33 parts per thousand (ppt), while naturally occurring potable drinking water, aka freshwater, contains a salinity of .5(ppt). The system developed brought the salinity of the ocean water down to 23ppt. Using solar heat as an energy source conserved on the need to use electricity and also limited the pollution output — making the product more efficient than other similar systems. Due to these results, we can tentatively accept the hypothesis that the proposed method is a viable alternative to conventional methods of desalination.

A NOVEL APPARATUS FOR CATALYTIC OXIDATION OF GLYCEROL PRODUCED DURING BIODIESEL SYNTHESIS 
Yohan Alexander Sumathipala
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Alexandria, VA

Biodiesel is a renewable source of energy being developed as an additive or replacement for diesel. Biodiesel is produced by transesterification of vegetable oils or animal fats. Glycerol is a by-product of this biodiesel manufacturing process. For every 10 kg of biodiesel produced, 1 kg of glycerol by-product is formed. If the production of biodiesel increases as predicted, the supply of glycerol will be in excess of demand and glycerol would become a waste stream. Glycerol contains about 16 MJ/kg of energy,and thus oxidizing glycerol to derive this energy is a viable solution. However, combusting glycerol has been a challenge due to its high viscosity, high auto-ignition temperature, and relatively low heating value. Other researchers have shown that glycerol can be successfully oxidized through Hybrid Enzymatic-Catalytic reaction and by careful control of air to fuel ratio in a burner using spray atomization of glycerol.<br><br>This work investigated a novel method to oxidize glycerol using ozone. The reaction used in this method occurs at ambient temperature and pressure. A test apparatus was constructed using a commercial ozonator and a system for gas heating and flow connected via metallic pipes into a circular loop. Glycerol vapor was introduced into this ozone enriched reactor volume.<br><br>Glycerol vapor was immediately converted into carbon dioxide, as recorded by a carbon dioxide detector. A glycerol to CO2 conversion rate of 35% was obtained for a 140 L reactor volume. Increasing reaction temperature and the addition of a Pt-Pd-Rh catalytic converter did not further increase CO2 yield. <br><br>This research verified the conversion of glycerol into CO2 using the oxidizing reactant ozone. It holds promise as a viable solution to the escalating problem of disposing of glycerol.<br><br>

FAIRFAX COUNTY LAND USE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM USING HIGH RESOLUTION AERIAL IMAGERY
Gina Liqi Li
Langley High School, McLean, VA

The purpose of this project is to use the National Agricultural Imagery Program’s (NAIP) high resolution photography to derive algorithms that accurately detect and calculate the area of different land surface types including trees, grass, water, and others. NAIP imagery is measured in four bands: bands 1 through 3 represent visible light measurements of blue, green, and red respectively. Band 4 represents Near Infrared measurements which are helpful in remote sensing. Comparing the ratio of band 4 measurements and the average of bands 1, 2, and 3 helps to determine the land type. By analyzing well chosen samples of area homogenous of a land type, it has been found that vegetation has a typical ratio range from 1.0 – 1.5 and water has a typical ratio range from 0.3 – 0.6. Further analysis has revealed that the standard deviation of trees (0.103) and grasses (0.031) distinguishes one from the other. Similarly, the ratio range for shadows has a range from approximately 0.3 – 0.6 as well, so the standard deviation of water (0.015) and shadows (0.1) distinguishes water from shadows. These algorithms are implemented into an interactive land use classification system of Fairfax County, which has the capability to toggle between land use and true color maps, zoom in and out, and calculate the acreage of each surface type within any selected area.

IMPROVING REVERSE OSMOSIS MEMBRANES FOR DESALINATION: THE MODIFICATION OF CELLULOSE NANOFIBERS
Rajkumar Shivraj Pammal
Commack High School, Commack, NY

Widespread water scarcity is a significant issue for society today, as 1.1 billion people, approximately 15% of the world population, lack access to clean water. To provide freshwater in areas lacking it, pressure-driven filtration methods such as reverse osmosis (RO) membranes have been utilized. The purpose of this investigation was to improve RO membranes for desalination, the removal of salt ions from water, by adding cellulose nanofibers to the barrier layers of such membranes. It was hypothesized that the nanofibers could be incorporated into the membrane if their surface properties were modified from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. Using a TEMPO-catalyzed oxidation reaction followed by an acylation modification reaction, the cellulose nanofibers were successfully modified. This crucial success was confirmed by an FT-IR spectrum analysis showing an altered chemical composition, and by water contact angle measurements. Due to the increase in hydrophobicity caused by this chemical modification, the cellulose nanofibers were evenly dispersed in an organic solvent to be used in the synthesis of the barrier layer. Following this success, a novel substrate for the barrier layer was synthesized, and its surface properties were fully characterized for applications in RO membranes. Therefore, the modified hydrophobic cellulose nanofibers developed through this investigation can be incorporated into a unique reverse osmosis membrane, with the promise of higher flux while maintaining rejection ratios. These novel membranes may also prove to be more economical than commercially available membranes, due to decreased pressure requirements.

CAN CORN-BY-PRODUCTS BE USED AS EFFECTIVE SUBSTITUTE INSULATORS?
Zachary Alan Parrish
A-C Central High School, Ashland, IL

The purpose of my experiment was to determine if corn-by-products could be used as effective substitute insulators. I predicted that all three corn-by-products would be able to be used as effective substitute insulators.<br><br> To test this experiment, I constructed a model house with voids to fill with different types of insulation. I used a thermometer to measure the temperature within a freezer. I used another thermometer to measure the starting and ending temperatures of the house after being placed in the freezer for one hour. I then filled the voids with a mixture of corn cobs and corn husks, corn cobs, corn husks, and fiberglass insulation. The house without insulation served as a control group. The fiberglass insulation was a means of comparison to prove if the corn-by-products could be effective substitutes. I calculated the average starting and ending temperatures of the house with no insulation, corn cob and corn husk, corn cobs, corn husks, and fiberglass insulation. I took the average temperature difference for each trial group and divided it by the average starting temperature, then multiplied that number by 100.This determined the percent drop of the starting temperature. Next, I took 100 and subtracted the percent drop of the starting temperature which gave me the average of starting temperature maintained. <br><br> I found the percent of average temperature maintained for fiberglass insulation to be 52.2%, corn cob insulation 60.9%, corn husk insulation 52.4%, and the mixed corn cob and corn husk insulation 55.3%. I found my hypothesis to be correct in that all three corn-by-products could be used as effective substitute insulators.

INVESTIGATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INDIGENOUS PLANTS IN INHIBITING MOSQUITO LARVAE DEVELOPMENT
Jorie Ann Moore
Sanger High School, Sanger, CA

The goal of my project is to determine the effectiveness of indigenous plants as pesticides in inhibiting mosquito larvae development. Three indigenous plants were tested: Jimson Weed, Stinging Nettle, and Milk Thistle. 600 lab raised mosquito larvae were collected. A lab test was conducted consisting of three different concentrations of each plant-10%, 5%, and 2%. The 10% pesticides were sprayed onto the larvae for a direct kill test. After one day the number of dead larvae were recorded. Next larvae were placed into containers filled with the 2% or 5% solutions for a developmental test. The larvae development was recorded after the control larvae fully developed. A field test was conducted using only the Jimson Weed in a pond simulation in natural conditions before larvae were introduced into the simulation. The results were observed after the control’s full developmental cycle. The direct spray results are: Milk Thistle- 78% alive, Jimson Weed- 54% alive, Stinging Nettle- 100% alive. The mosquito larvae development test at 2% results are: Milk Thistle- 84% developed, Stinging Nettle- 88% developed, Jimson Weed- 6% developed. The 5% results are: Milk Thistle- 82% developed, Stinging Nettle- 90% developed, Jimson Weed- 4% developed. The field test results were 0% developed in the Jimson Weed test. The indigenous plants are effective as pesticides in inhibiting mosquito larvae development. The low concentrations and indigenous nature of the pesticides ensure the least amount of adverse effects on the surrounding organisms and would dissipate more easily into the environment.

FLUSHED AWAY WITH GRAY: THE GRAY WATER RECYCLING TOILET
Julia Spicer Knowles
Massachusetts Academy of Math and Science at WPI, Worcester, MA

The average American domestic bathroom produces a considerable amount of gray water from activities such as washing hands and brushing teeth. Gray water is not potable, but can be employed for household processes that do not require completely clean water, like flushing the toilet. <br><br> The system was engineered to automatically collect gray water from a domestic bathroom sink and use it to flush a toilet. The goal of this project was to design a system that is easily adaptable, low cost, and efficient for use in the standard domestic bathroom. Several preliminary prototypes were constructed out of plastic containers and tubing to develop basic understanding of concepts and to predict possible obstacles that could arise during the construction of future prototypes. The most recent prototype, made out of plastic buckets, plastic pieces, a micro switch, clear tubing, and a sump pump, was fully installed in a domestic bathroom. <br><br> After installation, there was no manual labor needed to operate the appliance, and each process was automatic. Water was collected from the sink in a gray water reservoir. There was an attachment built onto the float which moved as the float moved, and would trigger a switch to pump gray water into the tank when the toilet was flushed. All modifications made to the bathroom were reversible; however, the prototype remains in use. In the majority of cases, a homeowner who installed the device would save more money per year than the cost of the actual prototype.

GOING...GOING...GONE? BIOREMEDIATION USING KUDZU AND COMMERCIAL PEAT MOSS
Mitchell Grant Hartley
John Curtis Christian School, River Ridge, LA

Last year I tested ground Kudzu, peanut shells, and Kenaf on simulated oil spills to determine the total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) remediated after treatment. This year, rather than focus on the immediate TPH readings, I wanted to determine the long term effects of environmentally friendly absorbents (ground Kudzu, an invasive nuisance species, and a commercial absorbent peat) on the bioremediation of crude oil over a four-month period. I added an additional geochemical test, whole oil gas chromatography (GC-FID) which separates chemical mixtures based on their boiling points. <br><br>Lake water was treated with crude oil and the Kudzu and commercial peat; the control was lake water without any oil. Multiple tests samples were run and averaged over a four-month period. The results of both the TPH testing and the GC chromatograms support my hypothesis that both Kudzu and commercial peat are effective in the bioremediation of oil from lake water. Both Kudzu (with addition of silica gel in extraction process) and commercial absorbent peat moss promote bioremediation by retaining oil in place for natural events (microorganisms or even weathering) to absorb oil. Because kudzu was not pretreated, it leached out natural oils (normal hydrocarbons) and gave a “false positive” or high reading of TPH. The commercial absorbent peat was pretreated and therefore, did not contain any natural oils to leak out. The silica gel removed the natural oils of kudzu and showed basically the same results as the commercial absorbent. In summation, both kudzu and the commercial peat are viable options for oil spill remediation.

EUGLENA: THE SOLUTION TO NANOSILVER POLLUTION
Adam Joel Noble
Lakefield District Secondary School, Lakefield, Ontario, CANADA

Nanosilver, a compound that inhibits the growth of bacteria and fungi, is being used in an ever-increasing number of commercial, industrial and agricultural processes and products. Consequently, humans may be exposed to high levels of nanosilver in their daily lives. This study demonstrated that Euglena cells actively absorb and concentrate nanosilver, causing structural and functional damage, eventually resulting in cell death. Also, the concentration of nanosilver causing fifty percent mortality in Lake Trout embryos was determined to be 23.5µg/L (LC50). Therefore, nanosilver is a potential challenge to the sustainability of ecosystems and perhaps human health. The purpose of this investigation was to develop a Euglena biofilter that functions as a remediation device for the removal of nanosilver in wastewater effluent. Numerous factors were tested to maximize growth of Euglena and absorption of nanosilver by Euglena. A prototype Nanosilver Filtration System was built whereby 6.8 million cells/hour could be harvested from a Euglena Concentrator for use in a Nanosilver Absorption Flow-Through System. 99-100% of the nanosilver was absorbed in one hour from wastewater samples from a local wastewater treatment plant that contained an average of 53.0µg/L nanosilver. 100% of the Euglena cells containing nanosilver were recovered and the nanosilver was subsequently refined. In conclusion, growth of Euglena cells in culture can be maximized and maintained to support a biofilter system that operates to filter wastewater containing nanosilver. The local wastewater treatment plant releases 3.2Kg of nanosilver annually, representing $4.2 million dollars. As such, this innovation is both environmentally and economically beneficial.

THE EFFECT OF PSEUDOMONAS FLUORESCENS AND BACILLUS MEGATERIUM, IN CONJUNCTION WITH MEDICAGO SATIVA, ON CRUDE OIL DEGRADATION AND TOXICITY REDUCTION
Alissa Anne Wolenetz
Carter County High School, Ekalaka, MT

Numerous studies have researched bioremediation using bacteria or plants. However, limited research has been done with combinations of plants and bacteria, and many of these results have indicated antagonistic relationships between organisms. The purpose of this experiment was to determine: 1) whether Pseudomonas fluorescens or Bacillus megaterium would develop mutualistic relationships with Medicago sativa (alfalfa), and 2) which bacteria was most successful in reducing oil toxicity. Phytoremediation is feasible for terrestrial bioremediation; alfalfa has potential in this field. Bacterial bioremediation is also an option. B. megaterium and P. fluorescens are saprophytic, oil-degrading bacteria that have been used with some success in crude oil degradation in prior studies. These bacteria were cultured separately in oil and soil. Alfalfa seeds were then germinated, and plant success with and without bacteria was compared. This was done through measurement and analysis of alfalfa germination rates and biomass weights. To assess crude oil toxicity after remediation, a bioassay using Lactuca sativa L. var. Buttercrunch was performed on the cultures, in which germination rate and root length were measured. In this experiment, P. fluorescens allowed for better growth of alfalfa in a mutualistic relationship, and reduced crude oil toxicity more than other treatments. However, both bacteria reduced crude oil toxicity more than alfalfa alone. Ultimately, oil bioremediation based on symbiotic relationships between saprophytic bacteria and plants may significantly reduce oil toxicity in a terrestrial environment. Application of this data could be helpful in the field of terrestrial crude oil bioremediation.

THE EFFECTIVENESS AND VIABILITY OF ARSENIC BIOACCUMULATION
Raihan Kabir
South Burlington High School, South Burlington, VT

The purpose of this project was to determine whether metal-tolerant organisms that intake atypical quantities of nutrients effectively extract arsenic from soil and groundwater. While the World Health Organization holds arsenic accountable for causing the greatest mass poisoning in human history, the United States Department of Agriculture highlights a recent use of plants in decontaminating metal-adulterated soils. This two-fold experiment investigated the phytoaccumulating capabilities of sunflower (Helianthus annuus) and the Chinese ladder brake fern (Pteris vittata) in arsenic-laced soil, as well as the bioaccumulating capabilities of cyanobacteria (Anabaena and Oscillatoria) and green algae (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) in arsenic-laced water. Each test sample in the experimental group contained an organism mentioned above, either soil or water, and sodium arsenate. Confounding variables were avoided by maintaining a scientific control group throughout experimentation in which an organism was never introduced. With exception to the accumulating subject itself, all conditions were kept uniform throughout all systems and experiments. Two simultaneous tests were conducted with different levels of arsenic to assess how varying quantities of the toxic metal affected the organism and its ability to intake arsenic. After three weeks, microwave-assisted nitric acid digestions of isolated plants and algae were taken and utilized in conjunction with an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) to measure the precise amount of arsenic accumulated by each organism. Statistical analysis indicates that metal-tolerant nutrient-demanding organisms do indeed bioaccumulate arsenic to a certain degree (p=0.07), thus assuredly rejecting the null hypothesis.

FROM GREY WATER TO POTABLE WATER: IS IT POSSIBLE?
Quinn Taylor Groff
Sheldon High School, Sheldon, IA

The purpose of my research project is to make a water filtering system that can be used to recycle grey water into potable water. The filter system will be made out of cheap materials that can hopefully be used in a third world country to help recycle water into potable water so that one of our natural resources, that are being depleted, can be reused.<br><br>I believe through my research that a cheap water filtering system can be made to purify water into reusable and hopefully potable water that can be used in third world countries where water is very scarce. <br><br>The results of my research varied greatly by the type of homemade filter I used. Filter one that was built from scrubber pads and sand did not filter out much of the solid material from the grey water. In each of the tests run for water quality the mg/L of material came down just slightly from the grey water which was used as the control. The scrubber pads were to porous to filter much out so it was pretty ineffective, so that led me to building a new filter out of PVC pipe.<br><br>The results of the 1-micron RO filter system were incredible compared to the first filter system I built. The water quality test results were very close to the tests run on the original tap water that went into the washing machine. The only test that was higher than the first filter system was for chlorine which through research tells me that that is because chlorine is very hard to eliminate through filtration, you need to add a chemical to reduce it. <br><br>I believe that recycling grey water is a viable method in third world countries to conserve one of our natural resources. If you were to run grey water through a 1-micron filter and boil the water from there for use in cooking and drinking it would save those under-privileged countries.

CONVERTING MUNICIPAL PAPER WASTE INTO ETHANOL THROUGH ACID AND ENZYMATIC HYDROLYSIS
Zachery Thomas Custer
Conestoga Valley High School, Lancaster, PA

A process that economically converts municipal paper waste into ethanol would address two of the most significant issues in society: the need for alternative energy sources and alternative waste disposal methods. This project explored using both acid and enzymatic hydrolysis to accomplish this conversion. In the acid hydrolysis procedures, shredded paper was mixed with hydrochloric acid and reflux heated at 100 degrees Celsius. Samples of the mixture were taken at various time increments and measured for glucose concentration using spectroscopy. The enzymatic hydrolysis procedures involved introducing paper feedstocks to the microorganism Clostridium phytofermentans. The results were then distilled and tested for ethanol purity using gas chromatography. <br><br> Thus far in experimentation, the most effective acid hydrolysis procedure was able to yield enough glucose to produce ethanol at the cost of $22.45 per gallon; over a 600% decrease from initial trials. Seven different variations of the acid hydrolysis procedure were tested in order to observe trends in yields caused by changing various factors such as acid concentration. The best result using enzymatic hydrolysis was a sample that had a concentration of 1.23% ethanol. The observations that have been made could be enhanced with additional extensions in order to find a process that can economically convert municipal paper waste into ethanol. From there, the process could be performed on a large scale using paper trash sources as the feedstock in order to dispose of the waste and create an alternative energy source.

THE IMPACT OF VARYING PRODUCTIVITY LEVELS ON ABUNDANCE AND FEEDING PATTERNS OF CALLINECTES SAPIDUS: WHAT DOES BLUE CRAB BEHAVIOR TELL US ABOUT WETLANDS RESTORATION?
Jamie Rachel Odzer
Dr. Michael M. Krop Senior High School, Miami, FL

The Everglades is a unique wetland ecosystem characterized by high species diversity, yet has been negatively impacted by anthropogenic activities. The Everglades has been the target of conservation efforts to restore it to its original state. A major aspect of the restoration is the reestablishment of hydrologic connectivity across the wetlands ecosystem. <br><br> The coastal Everglades contains a productivity gradient (variability of the amount of biomass in an area) which correlates with its waters’ origin (i.e. higher productivity closer to the Gulf). Adult male blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) are not very sensitive to factors like salinity, but are sensitive to varying productivity levels, which could make them excellent indicators of how restoration will affect the southern coastal Everglades as productivity dynamics change. <br><br> The purpose of this study was to investigate how an estuarine productivity gradient, which also varies seasonally, affects blue crab abundance and feeding patterns. Using crab-trapping surveys, blue crab abundance was measured across four sites, each with differing productivity levels, as well as across wet and dry seasons. Feeding patterns were also examined using stable isotope analysis of crab muscle tissue.<br><br> The results largely supported the hypothesis that crab abundance and feeding patterns would correlate with productivity and would shift seasonally with productivity changes. This suggests that studying blue crab distribution and abundance could be significant when monitoring restoration progress as it relates to altered productivity dynamics. Continued monitoring of blue crab populations could be extremely important in determining whether costly restoration efforts are ultimately successful.

THE EFFECT OF FEEDING PLEUROTUS OSTRATUS MEAL OR GRIFOLA FRONDOSA MEAL ON THE GROWTH OF LITOPENAEUS VANNAMEI
Olivia Kaye Joslin
Hilton Head Island High School, Hilton Head Island, SC

The purpose of this experiment was to develop an innovative, original,inexpensive, and environmentally friendly alternative food source for farm raised shrimp. The alternative food sources were made up of Cod liver oil (used as an attractant) and either Oyster (Pleurotus ostratus) mushrooms or Maitake (Grifola frondosa) mushrooms. <br><br>180 shrimp were weighed and divided equally among three tanks. The three tanks were further divided into three bins (labeled A,B, and C) containing 20 shrimp each. Shrimp in Bin A (the control) were fed fishmeal. Shrimp in Bins B and C were fed Maitake and Oyster meal respectively. After two weeks, the shrimp were re-weighed. <br><br> It was predicted that the shrimp fed the fishmeal would gain the most weight followed by the Oyster meal and Maitake meal diets. This was predicted because it is known that the fishmeal used is designed to have optimum levels of fat and protein for this specific shrimp species.<br><br>When testing the claim that the average weight gain with fishmeal would be greater than that with the mushrooms meals using a 2-sample Z-test, the results were statistically significant supporting the hypothesis. The fishmeal group had a 136.3% weight gain, while the Oyster meal group and the Maitake group had a 93% and 44.5 % weight gain respectively.<br><br>A qualitative indication of shrimp health was obtained by feeding the shrimp to fish; all groups were acceptable to their predators. <br><br>These experiments proved that the mushroom meals have the ability to sustain the shrimp. In addition, they provide the foundation for designing a mushroom-based meal that can provide a similar if not better weight gain then the fishmeal.

MODELING AND ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS OF HYDRAULIC FRACTURING IN UPSTATE NEW YORK
Kunal Ashok Sangani
Fayetteville-Manlius High School, Manlius, NY

This study provides a comprehensive examination of the various aspects of hydraulic fracturing in Upstate New York. A simple model was developed to determine the effect of process parameters on gas production, and the predictions of the model were shown to match publicly available data from Marcellus Shale wells. The model demonstrated that relatively low fracturing pressures may be used to produce natural gas while not compromising the structural integrity of surrounding rock. In addition to natural gas, an average well also produces 1.0 - 3.5 million gallons of highly contaminated brine called flowback water. An extensive analysis of this effluent was carried out. Chemical analysis showed that effluents have high concentrations of barium, strontium, and lead, and exhibit beta decay, most likely attributed to Pb210 isotopes. These measurements are perhaps the first documentation of metal ion concentrations and radioactivity in hydraulic fracturing effluent. Bioassays demonstrated that effluent is extremely toxic to model plant species and aquatic organisms. EC50 values and LC50 values for Hydra oligactis were as low as 3.7% and 11.1%, respectively, comparable to TDS levels present in Blacklick Creek during the Josephine Facility incident of 2010. X-Ray Fluorescence was used to measure uptake of toxins in an ‘established ecosystem’ experiment; results showed that heavy metals may accumulate in B. rapa leaf tissues, thus allowing for biomagnification.

Problem: Can paraffin and microcrystalline wax be used to absorb oil on san and water surfaces?<br><br>Hypothesis: I will prove through experiments and research that wax can effectively used as a source to absorb and clean up oil spills because of its unique properties.<br><br>Experiment: Inmy projectI took microcrystalline wax and sprinkled it over oil contaminated water. Then, I left it out in the sunto melt. After the wax melted, I gave it time to cool overnight. Finally, in the morning I took the wax off the water to see if the oil was absorbed in the wax. The next part of my project in volved oil soaked paraffin wax. I poured hot, melted paraffin wax on the oil soaked sand. After it had colled down, I took it off to see if the oil had been engulfed in the wax.<br><br>Results: My results showed that oil can be absrobed on beach sand with hot paraffin wax and on water with microcrystalline wax.<br><br>Conclusions: My results have successfully proven my hypothesis. Wax can be used as a source to absrob and remove oil from sand as well as water surfaces. Additionsl experiments indicated that paraffin wax can absorb oil from the sand. Application can be done with a heated spray system on a mobile unit. The wax attaches only to the oil on the sand due to its unique properties. Evidence also was shown that microcrystalline wax can be used to remove oil from the water surface. Methods of applications can be done with aerial dipsersing, blowing from a boat, or simply from hand.

TREATING POLLUTED WATER AND OIL SPILLAGE BY CELLULOSIC WASTE
Shui Yu Bertha Wong
St. Paul's Convent School, Hong Kong, HONG KONG

Water pollution due to disposal of dyes, heavy metal ions and oil from factories has been an increasing concern worldwide. However, commercial resin used in industries for adsorption of these pollutants is often costly and difficult to regenerate. Cellulosic agricultural wastes can be an alternative, inexpensive and favourable solution.<br><br>In this project, I used four pretreated agricultural wastes, namely peanut shells, corncobs, bagasse and coconut coir, as adsorbents to remove water pollutants. Cellulosic wastes were washed with either water or sodium hydroxide solution and then acid-modified by using citric acid or phosphoric acid. The 18 variants of adsorbents produced were then used to adsorb 7 dyes, 7 heavy metal ions (iron(III), copper(II), nickel(II), cobalt(II), chromium(III), zinc and lead(II)), water hardness and two types of oil (peanut and paraffin oil). Temperature and contact time effect on copper(II) ion adsorption were studied. Dye and oil adsorption is due to the interaction between different functional groups of the molecules and those of cellulose whereas ion adsorption can be explained by ion-exchange mechanism. The best adsorbent to adsorb dye, metal ion and oil was found to be water-washed citric acid-modified bagasse, base-washed citric acid-modified coir and water-washed bagasse respectively. To put my investigation into actual practice, bagasse was added to spilt oil on salty water to simulate oil spillage treatment. Result showed that treated oil can be easily collected and recovered.<br><br>Biodegradable cellulosic wastes are effective adsorbents and further research should be conducted to explore the possibility of using them to remove water pollutants.

POTENTIALS OF COMMON HERBAL PLANTS IN SEQUESTERING COPPER IN FORMER MINE BROWNFIELDS
Ven Gabriel Galang Tan
Marinduque National High School, Boac, Marinduque, PHILIPPINES

Mining has brought soil contamination with heavy metals. One of these heavy metals is copper, which can be present in the soil as copper ions (Cu+2) in large amounts. These can be carried by rain as runoffs to the land and water streams, spreading its effects to the environment. Thus, this study looked on the potentials of common herbal plants in sequestering Cu+2 in their shoot systems.<br><br> The study used seedlings of Amaranthus spinosus, Desmodium heterophyllum, Ruellia tuberosa and Stachytarpheta jamaicensis with low levels of Cu+2. They were grown in three replicates in plain garden soil with detected Cu+2 (8.36 ppm), garden soil amended with 5,000 ppm CuSO4 stock solution and former mine site or brownfield soil with 1,121 ppm Cu+2. After a month, the shoot system of the plants were harvested and analyzed.<br><br> Results showed remarkable increase in accumulated Cu+2 of the plants in mine site soil media, such as D. heterophyllum (15.63 ppm), A. spinosus (11.52 ppm), R. tuberosa (5.75 ppm) and S. jamaicensis (3.76 ppm) as well as in copper solution amended soil, such as D. heterophyllum (8.99 ppm), R. tuberosa (7.49 ppm), S. jamaicensis (6.32 ppm) and A. spinosus (3.19 ppm). S. jamaicensis attained the highest height and weight in all three soil media followed by R. tuberosa.<br><br> Propagation of these plants in Cu+2 contaminated soils can be considered to reduce the amount of contaminants in land and water.

APPLICATIONS OF MULTIWALLED CARBON NANOTUBES IN FILTERING BENZENE
Kayson Levi Conlin
Wasatch High School, Heber, UT

In recent years, the practice of hydraulic fracturing has dramatically increased in popularity. This method of collecting natural gas has the potential to provide hundreds of years’ worth of energy, but the chemicals involved can get into the groundwater, raising public concern. The goal of this project is to test the effectiveness of using multiwalled carbon nanotubes to filter benzene from water.<br><br>A 33ml sample of 94,566ppm benzene in water was passed through a FRAM G12 fuel filter filled with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT’s). Afterward, a 33ml sample of 87,000 ppm diesel fuel (also in water) was passed through the same filter. The filtered samples were then taken to Enviropro Laboratories in West Valley UT and analyzed using EPA test methods 3510C, 8015B, 5030A, and 8260B. The results showed a 99.3% decrease in benzene (to a final concentration of 657ppm). The concentration of diesel decreased by 51% to 41,700 ppm.<br><br>Based on the analysis of the benzene sample, I submit that the filter was very effective at removing benzene from water. The filter was less effective at removing other hydrocarbons (diesel) but with adjustments and a proper application of the MWCNT’s it could become more versatile. I submit that my experiment shows proof of the concept that the MWCNT’s will actively remove benzene from water. Through proper research and design, perhaps carbon nanotubes can be incorporated into bioremediation, and provide a cleaner greener tomorrow.

SAVING OUR ENVIRONMENT FROM THE HAZARDS OF PLASTIC WASTES
Farah Khalifa Alazimi
Khalda Bint Alaswad, Kuwait, KUWAIT

Our environment is getting badly damaged from humans carelessness and neglect. One of the main reasons that causes devastating damaging effects to our environment are plastic bags . They cause enormous environmental damage, which adds up to 80% of the volume of litter on the roads, parks and beaches . Also, it makes up to 90% of the floating litter in the ocean . Therefore, there must be a solution to this problem . There is a way to fix this problem, which is to transform trees and plants to a renewed source of energy. Also, this source will be an alternative to crude oil in the production of energy and raw materials. By that way plastic bags, which stay up to a 1000 years until they might dissolve will last for few months or a year only. So that, we will save our environment and help rare animals from getting extinct especially animals which might feed on these wastes unintentionally which leads to there death and extinction eventually , Such rare animals as sea turtles, seals, wales and different kinds of fish even though the destructive effects do not end here , as it also effects land animals such as goats, cows and sheep which might feed on these plastic bags and which also would lead to there death eventually . And another damaging effect these plastic wastes cause is that they interrupt the life cycle of both land and sea after producing plastic from plants we would be striking striking two birds with one stone firstly saving the environment by transforming plastic bags into a permanent source of energy and secondly getting rid of the plastic bags in away that they wouldn't take too long to dispose off and stop plastic bags from slowly deteriorating our planet .

ANALYZING MERCURY CONCENTRATIONS IN WATER SOURCES WITH BRASSICA RAPA THROUGH A MERCURY CALIBRATION CURVE USING UV-VIS SPECTROSCOPY, ATOMIC ABSORPTION, AND LEAST SQUARES REGRESSION STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Nicole Lynn Miller, Nadia Kemal, 
Charlotte High School, Punta Gorda, FL

Brassica rapa is a phytoremedial solution to mercury pollution. After entering the body, mercury can lead to ailments including autism, Alzheimer’s, ALS, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s, nephrotoxicity, cancer and more. Due to its toxicity, mercury needs to be reduced from water sources world-wide.<br><br>Water samples were collected from Peace River, Myakka River, and Caloosahatchee River and placed in individual, plastic reservoirs. Model raft systems, containing Brassica rapa pot sites imbedded in a Styrofoam board, floated on the water samples under fluorescent light, until fully grown.<br><br>The analysis methods used were Mercuric Compound and Triple Distilled Mercury Calibration Curve, UV-Vis Spectroscopy, and Cold Vapor Atomic Absorption. The mercury calibration curve was conducted using serial dilutions and useful for determining parts per million of mercury based on spectroscopic transmittance. UV-Vis Spectroscopy analyzed transmittance percentages of the plant solutions to determine ppm Hg. Cold Vapor AA was, also, used in order to find specific ppm mercury values the B. rapa extracted from the water. Potassium permanganate digestion was used to eradicate organic matter from the solution to isolate mercury for AA analysis. <br><br>Based on Cold Vapor AA, Myakka River was found to have the highest ppm of Hg at 0.00029343. Caloosahatchee contained 0.00011238 ppm Hg and Peace River 0.00004896 ppm Hg. Based on UV-Vis Spectroscopy, Myakka River and Caloosahatchee both resulted around 115 ppm Hg. Peace River had the highest ppm of Hg at 179.9429802. The correlation between the two procedures was -0.423. Due to Brassica rapa’s ability to bio remediate contaminated water using the raft method, this idea is a solution to heavy metal pollution.

THE DOCTORS: A FUSION OF ENGINEERING AND BIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS
Logan Keahi Davis, Kyle Flores, Erin Main
'Iolani School, Honolulu, HI

This project represents our third year studying the brisingid sea star, a bright orange creature that lives at extreme depths off the southern coast of Oahu. In the first year of our project, we used video data taken by two submersibles to analyze the habitats of the sea stars and develop several qualitative and quantitative hypotheses about them. During the second year of our project, we expanded on this research by designing and constructing an undersea camera intended to collect more data about the sea stars. This year, we refined the design of our camera system, tested it in shallow water, and continued our analysis of the brisingids. We began our year analyzing video data and learning about brisingid biology. We also performed an analysis of the currents in the area where the brisingids live and the impact that the objects they live on have on water flow. Later in the year, we were presented with an opportunity to deploy our camera system and redesigned it for enhanced performance, strengthening the frame and adding lights. Our deployment collected data about the area surrounding two munitions located at Ordnance Reef in Waianae, proving that the new research questions that we have developed can be answered by the inexpensive, easily duplicable system that we currently have.

'POLYFUEL': A NOVEL SOLUTION TO FUEL SHORTAGES AND DISPOSAL OF ELPS
Eoghan Thomas Flynn, Ruairi O Neill, 
Blackwater Community School, Waterford, Munster, IRELAND

Today the world is between a rock and a hard place. The rock is the mountains of plastic rubbish that is fouling the planet. The hard place is dwindling oil supplies. Our project offers a solution to both of these problems by pyrolising mixed, dirty waste end of life plastics (ELPs) back into hydrocarbon fuel.Similar processes have been used on an industrial scale for some years now but our pyroliser is different. It is scaled down to suit the needs of a household or small business. It can be made from commonly available plumbing parts and uses a cheap, easy to obtain material as a catalyst. The ELPs are heated to melting point and then, in a sealed vessel, are heated to 360 Degrees Celsius where they crack back into hydrocarboon gases. These gases are passed through a catalyst to crack them further and then condensed to obtain a liquid fuel. The fuel contains 60% diesel, 30% kerosene, 5% petrol and 5% uncondensable gases. The gas and some of the kerosene/petrol can be fed back into the system to provide the heating required. The diesel<br><br>fuel can be used in any diesel engine. Our tests have shown it to be<br><br>cleaner burning than conventional diesel. The system is a closed loop so there are no noxious wastes other than a small amount of carbon/char residue. We believe our system can be used througout the developed and developing world to alleviate fuel shortages and help clean up our environment

Nuestra Senora del Carmen, Lircay, Angaraes, PERU

In Huancavelica, Peru, there is an environmental liability of 7.522 million MT between clearing and tailings deposits which constitute a permanent risk for the population and the surrounding ecosystem, due to its high content of heavy metals. For this reason, it is urgent to implement clean technologies such as phytoremediation, which is the use of plants to remediate contaminated soils.<br><br>In order to reduce environmental pollution caused by mine tailings, this research was done with hyperaccumulator species: Zea mays (maize), Vicia faba (broad beans) and Hordeum vulgare (barley) using substrates from the sludge located in the Mine "Recuperada" in Huancavelica, Peru. We’ve evaluated the ability of heavy metal accumulation and its effect on the physicochemical properties of the substrate.<br><br>For the research, we used four types of substrates that consisted of tailings mixed with soil enriched with humus and limestone at different rates. We analyzed the substrates for pH, organic matter, concentration of macronutrients and heavy metals. Results show the metal hyperaccumulator absorbed in the following order Pb > Cr > Zn. <br><br>In conclusion, the presence of the hyperaccumulators species was associated with a decrease of the content of heavy metals from the substrates, being the species Hordeum vulgare which absorbs more of Pb and Zn, and the species Zea mays absorbs Cr, reducing environmental pollution.

The world faces challenges due to limited resources of water. There exist the need to optimize the use of water for irrigation systems.<br><br>We designed a assembled an irrigation system under the principle of sustainability of natural resources, comprising of a smart card, power supply, a car windscreen water pump and two sensors. The systems is run by the software PROTEUS 7.2.<br><br>We apply the system for watering plants in pots. The sensors connected to the pot to gather information on water requirements of the plant. This information is processed by the intelligent system. If the plant requires water, the pump is automatically activated watering the plant, and then it turns itself off.<br><br>Our results show the intelligent irrigation system allows to optimize the water in a 60% for small plants exposed to the sun, and 87% for small plants exposed to the shade. The system optimize the use of water in a 74% in tall plants exposed to the sun, and a 81 % in tall plants under the shade, measured during a week of watering. <br><br>We show the application of this intelligent irrigation system determines what volume of water and when to water as required, thus optimizing the use of water resources for growing plants in pots. The system could be modified and applied and for irrigation systems.

Maya Braun, Avishai Ketko, 
Moshe Sharet High School, Netanya, ISRAEL

Water sources in developing countries are often contaminated.Currently, solar water disinfection (SODIS) is practiced in these areas. In SODIS, plastic bottles are exposed to sunlight, typically requiring6hours - 2 days for purifying a 1.5Literbottle.<br><br>Our low-cost "green" system invokes two focusing methods of the solar energy. The first takes advantage of the unique geometric and optical properties of the water drop, resulting in maximum energy retention within the water solution. The second is based on concentrating the solar energy using a solar trough. The two methods are combined by letting the water drop fall along the focal line of the vertical solar trough.<br><br>We built a prototype and conducted experiments with known concentrations of E Coli and achieved 99% bacterial killing. We used a model for the amount of UV energy absorbed by the water drop.<br><br>Our results are very exciting, as the system significantly outperforms the current SODIS systems. We measured that one unit of our prototype system can purify 12 liters of water in 2 hours, easily supplying the needs of a household in only 6 hours of operation.

THE FEASIBILITY STUDY OF USING BRINE SHRIMP AS A BIOLOGICAL INDICATOR IN THE WATER QUALITY EVALUATION
Nam Hei Lam, Ka Kei Lao, 
Escola Keang Peng (Seccao Secundaria ), Macao, MACAU

General water quality assessment is based on physical and chemical indicators, such as COD, BOD and TOD etc. For the testing instrument, the price is inversely proportional to the sensitivity. However, the high school students are lack of educational resource to purchase the instrument, it is necessary to create new methods.<br><br>In this study, some new methods which use the brine shrimp (Artemiasalina) as a biological indicatorto accomplish the traditional evaluation of water quality are created. Several special techniques are used to analyze the impact of the overall water quality with brine shrimps. Several special criteria include hatching rate, mortality rate, flapping frequency and return time. The hatching rate and mortality reflect the state of brine shrimps. Number of flapping wing is used to evaluate how active the brine shrimps are, as well as the elimination of individual differences on the experimental results, and also applied to the phototoxic of the brine shrimps. Another method, return time indicates how long a group of brine shrimps reach to the light source in the dark. From the result, the data which are obtained in several days is generally the same, it proves the stability and feasibility of these methods.<br><br>As a result, it shows the application of water quality evaluation without expensive instrument is wide in water pollution, especially for the third world.

Boyu Wang, Yichen Liu, Stephan Liu
Lakewood High School, Lakewood, CO

Our Phase I study demonstrated that microbial desalination cell (MDC) was a promising novel technology for desalination and wastewater treatment without the need for external energy. However, it used ferricyanide as electron acceptors and phosphate pH buffer. Phase II of our study aimed at improving the system sustainability by using dissolved oxygen, diffused from air, as electron acceptors and recirculating wastewater between the anode and cathode to mitigate the pH change and stabilize the microbes’ environment. Recirculation of wastewater was also used to enhance the supply of nutrients to microbes and diffusion of oxygen as electron acceptors.<br><br>Our experiments were conducted using a three-cell air cathode MDC operated as a batch system. Acetate was used as a control to compare with the experimental results using domestic wastewater. Anion and cation exchange membranes separated the chambers, enabling desalination in the middle chamber. The desalination efficiency was assessed with three types of saline water: 10g/L sodium chloride solution that represents brackish water, reverse osmosis (RO) wastewater concentrate, and synthetic seawater.<br><br>The following was concluded:<br><br>1. The two innovations achieved their hypothesized purposes.<br><br>2. Desalinating RO concentrate improved MDC performance since RO concentrate contains organic matter that provides additional nutrients for the microbes.<br><br>3. Synthetic seawater had the highest conductivity, allowing a stronger electrical field and osmotic pressure gradient, which resulted in the highest desalination rate.<br><br> <br><br>The study eliminated the need for additional chemicals in the MDC, making it environmentally sustainable and viable for treating different types of saline water and wastewater. <br><br>

USING COLORIMETRY TO MONITOR NICKEL CONTAMINATION OF WATER
Emily Elizabeth Mudder, Alyson Roth, 
Avon High School, Avon, SD

Metallic ions produced by electroplating and other industrial processes can be a major source of wastewater contamination. One example is nickel, which can cause environmental and health problems. Therefore, industries must pre-treat water to remove these ions. How do they monitor the effectiveness of their treatment?<br><br>We removed nickel from water by hydroxide precipitation and monitored the results by using a colorimeter. Before adding NaOH to a solution of NISO4, we predicted how much precipitate should be formed, and then measured the actual amount formed. We repeated this for the molarity of the filtrate. Our data showed that our predicted and actual values were close, which means colorimetry was successful in monitoring the process. Finally, we calculated the minimum detection limit for nickel of the colorimeter used in our experiment to be about 1300 mg/L.<br><br>Using this information, we then designed a schematic that could use colorimetry to monitor nickel levels in water. Presently, we are modifying our colorimeter to measure a continual flow of wastewater. As of now, metallic ions in water are tested by either atomic absorption flame (AA) or using an inductively coupled plasma light emission process (ICP). Our process may be a cheaper method of detecting metallic ions in the effluent of wastewater. This technique could possibly be used by industry and wastewater treatment plants to monitor the treatment process for removing nickel contaminates.

W3S: WATER SENSING SAVING SYSTEM
Abeer yousef Jazzar, Raghad iyad Hanbali, Nedeen majdi al Sharif
Modern Systems School, Amman, Tla'a al ale, JORDAN

The aim of this project is to save the cold tap water present in the hot water pipes that is normally wasted while waiting for the hot water to arrive. The research that we constructed based on different building structures, mechanical systems, and life styles; showed that a huge amount of water is wasted. Our system, W3S, redirects the cold water present in the hot water pipes in order for it to be stored in a mini tank rather than being wasted. This water can then be used as fresh cold water for different purposes. This allows the user to directly have a water flow at the desired temperature from the hot water outlet. The system has two ways that can function separately or together depending on the user's needs and preferences. The first option uses a temperature sensor, a controller, and a three way solenoid valve -which works manually and automatically-; the solenoid valve is normally open to allow the flow of water when the system is off, this valve changes the flow of water when its temperature is less than the set temperature leading the water to the mini tank. The second option uses leuco dyes to visually detect the change in temperature in the hot water pipe while the water is being directed to the mini tank. This option changes the valve into manual usage so that the user can change the direction of water from the hot water outlet to the mini tank and vice versa.

STUDY ABOUT MARINE FLORA AND WATER QUALITY IN LA GUANCHA BEACH IN PONCE AND ITS USE FOR EDUCATIONAL WORKSHOPS
Paola M. Caraballo, Ramon L. Colon, 
Bernardino Cordero Bernard Vocational High School, Ponce, PUERTO RICO

The Caribbean Oceanographic Center in Ponce is an educational recreational complex proposed for La Guancha Beach in Ponce, Puerto Rico. It is committed with education and scientific communication. Our goal is to determine whether La Guancha Beach has enough marine flora and if its water meets the quality standards established by the regulations of the Environmental Quality Board of Puerto Rico. To perform this work 6 transects were placed from west to east along the coastline at intervals of 50 meters apart. The transects had a distance of 50 meters into the sea to explore the marine flora with a quadrant of a square meter, for a total of 300 square meters area. This parameters were analyzed in water samples: fecal coliform, enterococci, pH, turbidity and 13 different heavy metals. Among the six transects a total of 26 types of seaweed (7 red algae, 11 green algae, 3 brown algae and still 5 unidentified ) were counted, including Thalassia testidinum and red mangrove seedlings (Rhizophora mangle). It was concluded that the marine flora of La Guancha Beach proved to be very abundant. All the parameters studied concourse with the normal standards, except Thallium. The high concentrations of this parameter affect the marine flora but not human. It was also demonstrated that the water is safe for human contact, and meet the standards required by the Environmental Quality Board. As a result of these findings it was possible to design and conduct educational workshops on marine flora at La GuanchaBeach.

Teerapat Satjalak, Satawat Atipunyapunt, 
Assumption College Lampang, Muang, Lampang, THAILAND

In our province, tamarind wood is widely used as household fuel and an electricity generating plant situated here uses lignite as main fuel. This project presents the use of tamarind and lignite ashes, reported to contain silica, to produce artificial gems. First, the main chemical components in tamarind and lignite ashes were analysed and found to contain Al2O3, SiO2 and CaO. Then silica was prepared and qualitatively modified based on tamarind ash and fly-and bottom-lignite ashes with appropriate calcite temperatures and times. The silica obtained was mixed with minerals such as Na2CO3, B2O3, CaO in different mass ratios of 60:30:5:5, 65:15:10:10, and 70:20:5:5, respectively, transition metal was added to each mixture to act as the color highlight of the synthetic gems. Each solid mixture was filled into ceramic crucibles and calcited at 1250 degree celcius for 8 hours. Finally, the properties of the products obtained such as hardness, specific gravity, crystal morphology, reflective index, and luster were determined. The hardness, specific gravity, and reflective index of crystals obtained from the mixture with 70% solid weight of tamarind and lignite ashes were higher than others. Their crystal morphologies depended on the templates. The luster of synthetic gem made from tamarind wood was similar to glass and that made from lignite ashes was similar to adamantine. This work not only reported a procedure to reduce the ashes occurred from use of tamarind wood and lignite as fuel sources for heat and electricity but also the production of synthetic gem for jewelry industries.

THE KINETICS OF CELLULOSIC ETHANOL YEAR II
Heath Edward Garner, Hayden Garner, 
Taylorville High School, Taylorville, IL

Every year each person in the United States produces approximately 340 pounds of waste paper. In this project, continued from 2011, the exhibitors designed an experiment to increase the efficiency and yeild of ethanol production from paper waste fermentation. Three types of waste paper (corrugated cardboard, office mixed paper, and newspaper) were shredded, mixed with cellulase, yeast, and water. The cellulase enzyme hydrolyzed the polysaccharides of the paper, converting them into glucose making them available as food for yeast metabolism. Yeast metabolism converted the glucose into ethanol. Changing the ambient incubation temperature to 40 degrees Celsius, and lowering the pH to 4.0 is believed to allow for the maximum activity of cellulase and thus produce the most yield of ethanol. After fermenting for 7 days, the paper mash was strained to remove the larger particles and then filtered with a Micropore filter. The effluent liquid was then distilled and the resulting distillate analyzed for the percentage of ethanol and mililiters of distillate. The data collected demonstrated that ethanol was produced from each type of paper product used. Mixed paper produced the highest quantity and quality of ethanol, newspaper the second most, and lastly corrugated cardboard.

UTILITY OF A TRANSGENIC C. ELEGANS MATRIX SYSTEM AS A BIOASSAY FOR HEAVY METAL POLLUTION
Christopher DiPreta, Sai Senthilkumar, 
Manhasset High School, Manahsset, NY

Heavy metal pollution affects many organisms and their biological communities. Most heavy metals affect neurons in an organism, but it appears that the type of neuron affected is very specific; therefore, the purpose of this project was to use fluorescently tagged C. elegans to develop a bioassay matrix by quantifying GFP expression in various neurological systems. The neurological systems investigated included dopaminergic neurons (BY250), GABAergic neurons (CZ1200), and cholinergic neurons (LX929). C. elegans were synchronized via bleaching and on day two of their adulthood were exposed to .5x LC50, LC50, and 2x LC50 concentrations per metal compound to establish a “bio-indicator matrix.” GFP visualization was done using a Zeiss Axiovert 40 CFL Imaging Microscope. The heavy metals examined included Nitrates of Aluminum, Iron, Lead, Magnesium, and Zinc and Chlorides Cadmium, Manganese and Nickel. Post-processing, luminosity evaluation was done via Photoshop and statistical analysis by an ANOVA followed by a Scheffe Post-Hoc test (p<.05). There was no statistical difference within groups; however, there was a statistical difference between groups, suggesting the successful creation of distinct “bio-indicator” equations. These data suggest that the selective destruction of different neuronal systems makes it possible to identify the particular heavy metal pollutant. The C. elegans matrix system is effective in the identification of heavy metal pollutants and suggestive of the actual concentration of the pollutant, in that the matrix-calculated values had a correlation of 0.9993 with that of the actual values.

THE EVALUATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION ON HEAVY METALS IN PASTORAL PLANTS FROM MAHAD ALTHAHAB REGIONAL MINE
Abdulrhaman Sulaiman Almutari, Abdullah Almutairi, 
Almmhahhab Bin Abisufyan Secondary School, Madinah, West, SAUDI ARABIA

Our mine polluted our plants, our animals and our lives. The people of Mahd Althahaah are deeply concerned about the dangerous consequences of mine activities in the area. The researchers examined 4 soil samples from the area they selected and 7 samples for both Rabalah and Huwaymdah. Three samples of each plant were washed with pure water. This process is intended to find out the effect of the dust from the mine. The samples were then crushed and digested in a 3051 microware. After adding some acids to the samples, they were treated by ICP to get the results. <br><br>The results show that the two plants examined are polluted with the following heavy metals ( cd,cu, pb, and zn). The concentrations of cd and pb in the unwashed Rablah samples were 2g/kg and 17g/kg respectively in contrast with 1.1g/kg and 8g/kg in the washed ones. In Huwaymdah, the concentrations were 0.7g/kg and 6g/kg on cd and pb respectively for both the washed and unwashed samples. This negatively affects the shape of the plants and its ability to receive dust. The results of the experiment show that the two plants are polluted with heavy metals. In light of this, the researchers recommend stopping any mine facilities that produce heavy metals, avoiding grazing in the areas neighboring the mine, and examining the livestock in the area to find and how they are affected by this pollution.

THE ENHANCEMENT OF ELECTROCHEMICAL DEGRADATION OF CYANO GROUPS IN WATER THROUGH ADDITION OF A PLATINUM-COATED CARBON NANOTUBE CATALYST SUPPORT
Vania Jiayi Ma, Julie Graf, 
Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Lexington, KY

The presence of cyanotoxins in water supplies is a concern in today’s industrialized world. Electrochemical treatment is one potential method for degrading dissolved cyanotoxins. This experiment examined the effects the addition of a Platinum-coated carbon nanotube matte had on the electrochemical degradation of cyanotoxins. Because cyanotoxins are highly toxic, this experiment utilized a stimulant, 5-Cyano-2, 3 di(p-tolyl) tetrazolium chloride (CTC). The addition of Pt-coated CNT mattes substantially increased the efficiency of the electrochemical treatment system. Whereas the system without CNT support degraded virtually no CTC in a 90-minute timeframe, the system with CNT support degraded 175ppm of CTC in a 5-mL sample of simulated polluted water in less than ten minutes. However, after approximately 8 minutes, a red formazan coated the counter electrode, impeding further electrochemical oxidation of CTC. In conclusion, the addition of the Pt-coated nanotube matte support enhanced the electrochemical degradation of cyanotoxins by concentrating all dissolved toxin onto one collective surface and by effectively conducting channeling electric current to oxidize rapidly the CN-. Work is in progress to remove the formazan on the counter electrode via reaction with peroxide. Though this method forms a waste mixture of benzene and benzoic acid, this mixture can be separated and the pure substances sent to labs for use. A prospective filtration system coupling electrochemical treatment with Pt-laden CNTs is a potential step toward sustainability; this system removes CN- quickly without requiring heavy amounts of electricity, nanotubes, or metal. Formazan removal via peroxide will also create cogeneration among businesses; waste from the treatment facility is used by the lab.

Kira Mikailyn Pelowitz, Holly Caulder, 
Albuquerque Institute of Math and Science, Albuquerque, NM

This study seeks to test the ability of the fungal species P. ostreatus to degrade the polyethylene found in plastic bags. This study was conducted in two experiments. The first grew large scale mycelial cultures in wood pellets and straw along large strips of plastic bag. The second trial grew small mycelial cultures from dowel plugs in petri dishes full of wood chips, along small squares of plastic bag. The first trial produced %12.6 degradation of the course of nine weeks by mass; the second produced no statistically significant degradation. This results suggest the ability of P. ostreatus to degrade polyethylene under the right parameters.

RESEARCH ON THE WAY TO REDUCE COLD-WEATHER DAMAGE TO GREENHOUSE FARMS BY DIMINISHING MPEMBA EFFECT
JinKyu Oh, Gyeongyeon Pyo, 
Dajeon Daseong High School, Korea, Dajeon, SOUTH KOREA

Is it possible that hot liquid freezes faster than cool liquid? Yes, it is reasonable. This is called 'Mpemba Effect'. So far, there have been a number of effort of scientists to find out the cause of this phenomenon in liquid condition. But no record about the experiment in air condition has been found anywhere all over the world. And we have finally reached the conclusion that Mpemba Effect arises also in the liquid state. <br><br> It has been a big mystery that the temperature of the atmosphere outside a greenhouse is above zero the temperature inside is still below zero. As to this question, we have tried to explain why these effects in temperature happen in air condition. Ultimately, we have found ways to prevent the cold-weather damages in significantly easier ways. <br><br> We thought the variables of Mpemba Effect in air condition are temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide concentration, and density, so we experimented using MBL(Microcomputer Based Laboratory). (Of course there are other variables besides our four variables, but we thought that four causes are most important.) We confirmed if the experimental results in lab are able to be applied to actual greenhouse circumstance. It is possible. Also, we found out the way to reduce cold-weather damage by analysing that experimental results. (We did it by comparing our data with that of local weather cast including heat capacity, amount of sunshine, wind speed, etc. as well as temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide concentration, and density.)<br><br> In short, we proved Mpemba Effect in air condition, and researched how to avoid cold-weather damage in case the temperature of greenhouse's inside is below zero while outside is above zero with proved facts.

FABRICATION AND CHARACTERIZATIONS OF DEGRADABLE POLYURETHANE MEMBRANES FOR THE PRODUCTION OF SINGLE-USE CULINARY GLOVES
Man Ting Chu, Wing Yan LI, 
Shun Tak Fraternal Association Yung Yau College, Hong Kong, HONG KONG

Single-use plastic gloves are used extensively in food preparation establishments. According to the 1999 FDA Food Code, ready-to-eat food should not be touched with bare hands and new gloves must be worn every time. These gloves are often non-degradable and are placing serious environmental burden to our landfills. Therefore, we proposed to fabricate degradable gloves for culinary use. Polyurethane (PU) would be an ideal candidate since it can eventually degrade into carbon dioxide and water, and can easily be fabricated into membranes.<br><br>Phase-inversion was chosen to fabricate PU-membranes. The fabricating conditions were systematically tuned to produce PU-membranes with the most desirable mechanical properties. The best fabricating conditions produced PU-membrane with the highest pull out strength, when we used acetone as non-solvent and 90 degree celsius water to induce phase inversion. Subsequently, water, oil and detergent proofing, anti-corrosion, anti-puncture properties and degradation rate were also characterized and compared with those of commercially-available gloves.<br><br>Results showed that pull-out strength of PU-membranes (~5.9±1.17N) were similar to those of controlled gloves (~5.3±0.81N). Tests on water, oil and detergent proofing showed that PU-membranes did not allow neutral, alkali, acid solutions (pH1-10), detergent or oil to pass through and there was no corrosion. Test on anti-puncture property showed that forces needed to puncture PU-membranes (~0.67±0.06N) were larger than those to puncture controlled gloves (~0.13±0.03N). Polyurethane also showed a decrease in mass by 22.38±1.03% after 60 days while the controlled gloves were non-degradable. Therefore, polyurethane shows a great potential to replace existing materials used for plastic gloves.

SHARK INFECTED WATERS: THE EFFECT OF SHARKSKIN RIBLETS AMD JULIFLORINE ON BIOFILM IN WATER PIPES
Keely Shaylyn White, Mahaily Rogers, 
Andrews High School, Andrews, TX

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the texture of pipe surfaces and therapeutic herbs such as mesquite have an effect on the biofilm formation in water pipes. Biofilms are communities of microorganisms that add layer upon layer of microorganisms. Water distribution pipes act as a reservoir for microorganisms that can detach bulk water, ultimately reducing the hygienic quality of the water. Juliflorine, an alkaloid extracted from Prosopis juliflora has shown to have antimicrobial properties. Studies have shown sharkskin’s pattern with its tiny microscopic riblets prevent bacteria from attaching to its surface. <br><br> The antimicrobial effect of Juliflorine was determined in vitro on four gram negative bacteria: Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter freundii. This was determined in by a zone of inhibition. <br><br> The texture of the sharkskin was proven in vitro to have bacteria inhibiting attachment on Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca.<br><br> In a lab setting the alkaloid Juliflorine exhibited antibacterial effects on gram negative bacteria, and the sharkskin pattern was shown to prevent the bacteria from attaching to the surface. Altogether the two aspects combined presented to be viable treatment option for biofilm. Further studies would be required for the application to a real world setting.

BIODEGRADABLE PACKAGING FROM PRICKLE PEAR AND LIME PEELS
Juan Carlos Jaramillo Laguna, Maria Selene Hernandez Gonzalez, 
Centro de Bachillerato Tecnologico industrial y de servicios No. 172, Cortazar, MEXICO

Mexico produces 500,000 tons of prickly pears and 1,880,000 tons of limes yearly. From this, 40 and 20% respectively are discarded peels. This is an opportunity area to substitute a fractioned of carton from wood and the plastic obtained from petroleum. Carton and plastic production is 5,000,000 and 4,513,000 tons approximately each year respectively. Discarded peels were processed to reuse and reduce the use of plastic and carton. The following question is set: Can we elaborate biodegradable packaging from prickly pear and lime peels to preserve the environment and avoid the use of non biodegradable packs? The project´s objective is the development of bio-packs and determination of physical and mechanical properties (density, superficial density, water vapor permeability, and breaking point). To obtain carton, Correa, J.2005 formulation was used applying a fractioned experimental design in Minitab 15. Results show that carton from lime peels present good characteristics in appearance, color, texture, porosity, malleability, pasta formation, superficial uniformity, water vapor permeability and resistance comparing it with experiment 3 from prickly pear peels, and with Correa J. 2005 and Guillen C. 2007 formulations. Experiment 3 from prickly pear peels had better characteristics relating to density and superficial density. The formulation to elaborate carton has been innovated. Project´s environmental impact is to develop useful and biodegradable innovative packs; therefore, tree felling will be reduced.

ANTILEAKS: A DEVICE FOR DETECTION AND DISCONTINUATION OF LEAKAGES IN DOMESTIC WATER SUPPLY SYSTEMS
Gal Oren, Nerya Stroh, 
JCT Torah & Science Yeshiva High School, Jerusalem, ISRAEL

One of the difficult problems in the water economy is that of water losses in supply systems. The proposed approaches to treat this problem available today are inadequate and do not provide a comprehensive solution. Antileaks, The device we have built, is designed to detect leakages in these systems and stop them. First, the system analyzes the consumer's average water consumption over a period of time based on a mathematical model. The system keeps measuring and analyzing the water consumption in real time. In case it detected a great deviation from the average or steady water consumption over a period of time it alert the consumer by cellular communication – and if necessary disconnects the leaking system from the water supplier. Additionally, the system can send data about the consumption to a nearby computer in wireless communication.

THE EFFECT OF FIRE ON THE COMMUNITY STRUCTURE OF MACRO-INVERTEBRATES IN A COMPARTMENTALIZED WETLANDS ECOSYSTEM: WILL WETLANDS RESTORATION EFFORTS REDUCE THE ANTHROPOGENIC INTENSIFICATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE FROM NATURAL DISTURBANCES?
Jamie Rachel Odzer
Dr. Michael M. Krop Senior High School, Miami, FL

The Everglades is a unique wetland ecosystem characterized by high species diversity. It has been significantly negatively impacted by anthropogenic activities, and is currently the target of expensive conservation efforts to restore it to its original state. A major aspect of this restoration is the reestablishment of hydrologic connectivity across the ecosystem. <br><br> It has been suggested that levees and drainage canals, which cause hydrologic and habitat discontinuity and compartmentalization, affect the burning patterns of wetlands. Fires are now occurring more often than historically, and are increasingly detrimental to the ecosystem. Everglades’ macro-invertebrate communities, which are critical components of the food web, can be used as indicators of the effects of fire on a compartmentalized wetland.<br><br> The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of fire on the community structure of macro-invertebrates in areas of the central Everglades. Using throw-trap and sweep surveys, invertebrates were collected in three restoration sites before and after these sites were disturbed by wildfire in June 2011. Invertebrates were also collected before and after June 2011 in two sites that did not experience a fire.<br><br> The results demonstrate that fire may have a significant impact on species richness and density of macro-invertebrates in the compartmentalized wetland ecosystem. This suggests that the severity of droughts, and consequently the severity of fires, need to be controlled to maintain proper balance of the ecosystem. These findings support the continued need for aggressive restoration efforts, which include removal of canals and levees to restore hydrologic connectivity to wetlands.

DETERMINING THE RELIABILITY OF THE DEAD QUAGGA MUSSEL (DREISSENA BUGENSIS) POPULATION AS A PREDICTOR FOR THE COMMUNITY STRUCTURE OF LIVE QUAGGA MUSSEL POPULATION IN LAKE MICHIGAN
Clarise Evelyn White
Divine Savior Holy Angels High School, Milwaukee, WI

The purpose of this primary research about quagga mussels in Lake Michigan is to measure the community structure of live and dead quagga mussels in certain locations and establish whether the dead population, according to their decomposition rate can be considered reliable indicators of the current environment of a sample location. Therefore, the “target locations” for extermination will be made apparent for the future. The hypothesis is that the mussels treated with filtered Lake Michigan water will dissolve more gradually than those treated with filtered EPURE. It is then acceptable to say that the dead quagga mussel shells are a reliable indicator of the capability of a certain location to maintain the growth of the quagga mussel population. I measured the length of all of the live and dead quagga mussels from five sample locations with a caliper in order to analyze their community structure using a size distribution chart. Through these graphs, I determined that the environment for offshore locations could sustain the expansion of quagga mussel population, whereas the inshore locations generally could not. I also assessed the dissolution rate of the dead shells by measuring each sample’s initial dry weight, treating half with EPURE and the other half with Lake Michigan water for nine weeks, and measuring their final dry weight. The mussels that were treated with filtered Lake Michigan water dissolved more gradually; thus, the dead mussels in Lake Michigan take nearly a century to dissolve, which brings about questions regarding their time of death.

CASCADING MIXED-MEDIA DENITRIFYING BIOREACTOR
Jed Matthew Mercado Paz
Griffin High School, Griffin, GA

High nitrate runoff to natural water bodies, such as streams, rivers, or lakes, can cause environmental problems and impact water quality. The discharge of excessive nitrate levels results in eutrophication causing the death of aquatic organisms. Denitrification by anaerobic bacteria involves the conversion of nitrate into nitrogen gas which is then released into the atmosphere. The goals of this research project were to design and construct a cascading mixed-media (wood chips and switchgrass) denitrifying bioreactor, and examine its effect on the removal of nitrate. Results indicate that the cascading mixed-media bioreactor enhanced nitrate removal as shown by decreasing nitrate-nitrogen (NO3--N) levels in the effluent over time, compared to the NO3--N levels in the effluent from the exclusive wood chips bioreactor. The mixed-media bioreactor provided a carbon-rich source and very low dissolved oxygen levels (close to zero) which induced denitrification by anaerobic bacteria. Denitrifying bacteria utilized carbon as their food, and low oxygen levels ensured that bacteria utilized nitrate for respiration. The pH of the effluent did not vary over time. Specific conductance and total dissolved solids were lower in the effluent collected from the cascading mixed-media bioreactor. High turbidity may be attributed to the presence of loose switchgrass straw that was dislodged in the effluent. The design, construction, and evaluation of a cascading mixed-media denitrifying bioreactor presented here may provide valuable information for developing a large scale denitrifying bioreactor which maximizes nitrate removal from runoff of septic tanks, dairies, or agricultural lands, thus minimizing adverse environmental consequences.

THE EFFECT OF PH LEVEL ON THE STRENGTH OF POLYLACTIC ACID OVER TIME
Jackson Sewall Bryant
Winona Senior High School, Winona, MN

Polylactic acid is a type of plastic that uses dextrose extracted from plants instead of crude oil as its raw material. This plastic degrades through a hydrolysis reaction and then microbial degradation. The PLA used in this experiment was Ingeo 2003D. Groups of bars made from PLA were placed into different groups, each with a specific pH level. These were 2, 5, 9 and 11. The control was pH 7. Bars were tested for tensile strength, elongation and modulus. It was hypothesize that over 10 days of being in solutions of these different pH levels the strength of the bars would stay the same. The results showed no decay in the strength of the bars except the pH 11 group. The hypothesis was correct for all groups except the pH 11 group. Through these results it can be concluded that PLA would be a usable alternative for uses involving substances of pH level 2, 5, 7, and 9 though not pH 11 over 10 days or less.

FURTHER STUDIES IN BIOFILM REMOVAL OF WASTEWATER CONTAMINANTS
Monica Elizabeth McFadden
Notre Dame Academy, Park Hills, KY

Earlier experiments by this researcher demonstrated that biofilms grown on sand substrates create active biobarriers that can remove nitrate, reactive dye, and beta-estradiol from water. The current study attempts to create new systems to improve previously-developed models without compromising effectiveness.<br><br>It was hypothesized that if a biofilm forms on the walls of small-diameter vinyl tubing or on granular activated carbon, then concentrations of nitrate and reactive dye emerging from a flow-through system would be reduced, much as they were in previous years when sand served as a substrate. Biofilms were created from Pseudomonas fluorescens grown in these systems. The reduced rate at which water flowed through the systems was an indicator of biofilm formation. Water containing reactive dye or nitrate drained through the tubes and concentrations were measured; averages were compared using Student t-tests. When reactive dye filtered through the small vinyl tube, there was no overall effect; therefore, that aspect of the hypothesis was rejected. The granular activated carbon filter proved an effective substrate, readily adsorbing both reactive dye and nitrate. The data trend for nitrate shows that after the carbon filter reached its adsorption maximum, biofilm grown on the substrate effectively removed additional nitrate from water. It can be concluded that a biofilm grown on a granular activated carbon substrate is more effective at removing contaminants such as nitrate than either the biofilm or the carbon filter alone.<br><br>

RIPARIAN AREA MULTIPLE INDICATOR MONITORING
Sarah Elizabeth Stalcup
Delta High School, Delta, CO

The purpose of this project was to test the effects of livestock management on a riparian area.It is a multi-year project (this being its second year).<br><br> In 2011 and 2012 baseline data of vegetation and stream health on Big Dominguez Creek was assessed. Data showed the area was impaired and needed management; this lead to the construction of targeted fencing and water developments in 2011.The Multiple Indicator Monitoring (MIM) protocol was used to evaluate pre- and post-grazing conditions of the riparian area. Data for short-term (annual) indicators including: stubble height, streambank alteration, and woody species use by cattle and elk was collected at the two reaches. This was done once each pre- and post-grazing season. <br><br> The data showed that grazing by cattle reduced the stubble height of stream-side vegetation and altered streambank conditions in both reaches; however, these changes were an acceptable amount. It also showed that 31-51% of the woody plants, specifically willow, had been grazed by elk and cattle, which is above the acceptable range.<br><br> The data suggests that cattle do have a negative effect on a riparian area. They also display that targeted fencing alone does not improve the area’s health. However the fencing, along with other management implications including using the pasture earlier in the year, before willow becomes palatable to grazing animals, would allow plants to grow to a height sufficient to resist grazing by cattle and wildlife.

RENEWABLE ENERGY DRIVEN UNDER ICE FISH SMOTHER PREVENTION DEVICE
Zenoviia Shvaika
Lvivskyi Tekhnolohichnyi litsey, Lviv, UKRAINE

Fish smothering due to the lack of oxygen during winter on lakes and rivers poses great ecological problem, often resulting in severe damage to fish population and causing significant organic water pollution. Traditionally dry reed stalks are placed through the holes in the ice that channel small amount of oxygen to the water, however the efficiency of this passive method is limited.<br><br>The aim of project was to develop and test fully autonomous unit that implements a combination of renewable energy sources (wind and solar) to actively aerate ice-bound waters. A suggested device is designed on a floating platform on which a wind turbine and solar cell is installed. The turbine drives frost protected shaft that rotates the blades underwater. Generated flow from deeper, warmer waters flushes the hole in the ice and provides adequate mixing and aeration. Solar cells in turn can also drive an air pump that improves aeration, as small bubbles will be carried away by the turbulent flow.<br><br>Frost protection of the shaft is achieved by implementation of contact-free magnetic coupling of the underwater blades and shaft, so that during low wind speeds the shaft is protected from freezing in to ice and when wind starts, scour reappears. Several units can be placed on the larger lakes or rivers as required. Suggested device can be permanently placed on the water providing fish stalks protection from suffocation even in the remote areas.

ANTIMICROBIAL AND HEAVY METAL SEQUESTRATION CAPACITIES OF GRAPHENE POLYMER NANOCOMPOSITE FILMS
Manvitha Venkatasai Katta
Michael E. DeBakey High School for Health Professions, Houston, TX

Membrane bioreactors (MBR) are important components in the production of effluent in wastewater treatment systems. However, MBR are susceptible to biofouling, a process by which bacteria colonize the surface of the membrane in contact with water. Graphene could be a solution to biofilm formation. In this study, the graphene polymer nanocomposite’s antimicrobial and heavy metal removal properties and the mechanisms behind the properties were investigated. Five different films of nanocomposites with a form of graphene and a polymer were synthesized: Graphene, Graphene Oxide, PVK-GO, PVK-G, PVK. A Büchner funnel and a vacuum pump were used to coat membrane filters with solutions of each nanomaterial. Using the Büchner funnel, E. coli and B. subtilis bacteria were filtered through the filter and both the filtrate and the filter were examined for bacterial content. Similarly, a Pb2+ solution was filtered through the coated filters and percentage removal of the ion was calculated using Atomic Absorbtion Spectrometry. PVK-GO was most effective at removing the highest percentage of heavy metal and inactivated the most bacteria and displayed the most antimicrobial properties. Further analysis from SEM data, ATR-IR, and a metabolic assay reveals that the PVK-GO nanocomposite inactivates bacteria by causing oxidative stress and lysis of the cell membrane. The carboxyl group present in the PVK-GO nanocomposite binds to lead ions and sequesters them from solution. PVK-GO coatings provide a better, more efficient and economical alternative to the current industry standard MBR. These polymer graphene coatings even have applications in the medical devices like catheters and mechanical heart valves.

REDUCE, REUSE, RECYCLE: THE EFFECTS OF NITRATE PHYTOREMEDIATION IN CONTAMINATED FRESHWATER AQUACULTURE WASTEWATER USING TRITICUM AESTIVUM, YEAR TWO
Valerie Rochel Gamayot Gamao
James Madison High School, San Antonio, TX

Year 1 (2012) study showed Triticum aestivum’s effectiveness in reducing nitrate levels in a simulated 200 ppm nitrate-contaminated aquaculture wastewater, but where the nitrate went is a mystery. This year’s research aimed to provide insight on wheatgrass’s suitability as a market crop through analysis of plant composition. The hypothesis was that a corresponding increase of nitrogen content in the harvested shoots and roots would result.<br><br>Wheatgrass was grown in a hydroponic system composed of six individual tanks, each with their own hydroponic unit. The first five tanks had a 200 ppm NO3 concentration and the last tank acted as the control with no nitrates. After 12 days, the crop was harvested and taken to a lab where they were dried, grounded, and combusted in a nitrogen analyzer and the percent nitrogen determined. <br><br>Based on the results, it can be concluded that the plant composition is affected by the addition of nitrate concentration. A corresponding increase of nitrogen content in the harvested shoots (4.89%) and roots (3.16%) occurred with the shoots containing a higher proportion of nitrogen. Significant statistical differences among the treatments were also seen through ANOVA. <br><br>The significance of this study is that Triticum aestivum maybe more than just a phytoremediator in aquaculture. This crop could potentially also serve as livestock feed due to its resulting high crude protein, or even act as a fertilizer for the agriculture industry. Further research still needs to be done to expand on the benefits of raising wheatgrass as a crop.

PHARM POLLUTION
Tabitha Lynn Hudspeth
Nettleton High School, Jonesboro, AR

Most animals on a farm are given antibiotics. Traces of these antibiotics are then excreted in their waste, which is then used as fertilizer. Ivermectin, Penicillin, and Cefdinir (common farm animal antibiotics) were used for this project. The purpose of this project is to see if antibiotics have an effect on the germination and growth of plants. <br><br> One dose of antibiotic was placed in 30 mL of water and then divided up in 5%, 10%, and 15% solutions. A piece of filter paper was placed in the bottom of a petri dish and then saturated with 2 mL of solution. 10 radish, snowbird pea, collard, or lentil seeds were placed in the petri dish. Every 24 hours 1 mL was added to keep to seeds in a moist environment. After 72 hours the seeds were counted for how many germinated and then each was measured. Also, soil was placed in a container and 10 seeds were planted in it and watered with 300 mL of water. The seeds were watered with 1 mL of solution around the base of each plant every 24 hours and were watered with 100 mL of water every 72 hours. After 10 days from being planted the height of the plants were measured.<br><br> The antibiotics had a definite negative effect on the seed and plant growth rate, but did not seem to effect the germination rate. Therefore antibiotics do not effect the germination of plants, but do hinder the growth of seeds and plants.

IMPERVIOUS SURFACES

Thomas Stone High School, Waldorf, MD

The purpose for this project was how impervious surfaces affect a streams overall health rating, which determines the quality of life for organisms in multiple sites. I tested for pH as well along with A GIS system, “My World.” From the MY World software, multiple tests sites within one watershed were found. For each trial, 1.5 hours were spent at each site (4 trials total) with a pH kit and reference paper to identify the organisms. My trials were conducted when the water was above freezing to ensure organisms could be found. <br><br> The results showed that there was a direct correlation with impervious surfaces, and BOTH the overall stream health index and pH levels. The sites that had “good” health ratings (which were the two sites with the least amount of impervious surfaces), also showed more stable and neutral pH levels. The main feeder stream, received a “fair” stream rating along with almost ideal pH levels. The two streams with the most impervious surfaces both received a “poor” health rating and very unstable pH levels. This means that were could be issues with the organisms living in the streams. <br><br> Testing both the pH levels and types of organisms living in streams was successful. Not all streams in my testing attain “good” health ratings. This is very disturbing as this is a nation wide issue. There are many precautions we can take to help improve local streams. Together we can make a difference.

THE EFFECT OF POLYMER-COATED NITROGEN FERTILIZERS ON NITROUS OXIDE EMISSIONS
Aaron Chu Solomon
Eleanor Roosevelt High School, Greenbelt, MD

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a powerful global warming agent, with 298 times the global warming potential of CO2. It also depletes stratospheric ozone. The majority of anthropogenic N2O is produced in agricultural systems,. The use of nitrogen fertilizer has been crucial to increasing agricultural productivity worldwide, but greatly exacerbates N2O emissions. Therefore, it is important to find fertilizers that can provide nitrogen to plants but reduce N2O emissions. Polymer-coated fertilizers (PCFs) are among the most promising of these solutions. In this experiment, two types of polymers are compared: polycaprolactone and a hydrogel of polyacrylamide. These were blended with urea and a montmorillonite base. The urea and montmorillonite were combined in a 4:1 ratio of urea to montmorillonite. The polymer was added as 5% or 20% of the montmorillonite on a mass basis. It was hypothesized that the PCFs would reduce N2O emissions when compared to urea. These PCFs were compared to urea, a urea and montmorillonite mix without any polymer, and a control with no fertilizer. The treatments were applied in a winter wheat field at a rate of 100 kg nitrogen/hectare in October, 2012. Gas sampling was conducted from application time through March 2013, quantifying N2O emissions. Cumulative N2O emissions from each treatment were compared, using analysis of variance and contrast statements. Nitrous oxide emissions from the polymer-coated urea fertilizers were significantly lower than from the fertilizers with no polymer coating with alpha=.05 (p=.02). This suggests that the polymer-coated fertilizers could be a viable alternative nitrogen fertilizer.

REDUCING CONTAMINANTS IN MINERAL PRODUCTION EFFLUENTS: UTILIZATION OF MYCOREMEDIATION TECHNIQUES TO IMPROVE WATER QUALITY
Sarah Ann Bockman
Greybull High School, Greybull, WY

Coal bed methane is found in underground coal seams and is extracted by hydraulic fracturing. Many concerns have arisen about the chemicals used in this process and whether or not they have contaminated soil and water. Mycoremediation is a form of fungal bioremediation that uses fungi species to reduce contamination levels in soil or water through decomposition. Mycoremediation has been known to break down petroleum, pesticides, and other hydrocarbons. This project focuses on the applications of mycoremediaton to reduce contaminants associated with coal bed methane in both soil and water samples. Two mushroom species – (Pleurotus ostreatus and Lentinula edodes) were tested using both soil and mushroom samples. Sodium arsenite, benzene, and toluene were added to samples in accordance to EPA regulations. After one week of observation, samples were taken in preparation for Gas Chromatography. Two gram samples of soil and 1 gram samples of mushroom were taken from each trial. Twenty milliliter aliquots of hexane were then added to each of the samples. Benzene and toluene extractions were taken in 1µL aliquots and inserted a gas chromatograph for analysis. Tested samples that produced distinct peaks did not have similar retention times to that of the benzene and toluene standards. Initially, this was believed to be a decomposition of the benzene and toluene, there is a possibility this peak may be a natural compound generated by the mushroom or something present in the sample prior to experimentation. Within two weeks of exposing samples to contaminants, there was no trace of benzene or toluene. Both of these highly toxic liquids are often present at waste sites long after the initial exposure. They do not simply evaporate or break down on their own. Though the amounts of toluene and benzene used in this research were small, they should be detectable if present in the samples. Their complete absence would indicate that mushrooms did remediate the substances in some manner. With these results, it can be concluded that Shiitake and Oyster mushrooms had a positive effect in reducing at least some of the contaminants associated with hydraulic fracturing through mycoremediation.

BIO-OIL: THE USE OF SPECIALLY MADE CATALYST
Nur Liyana Johari
Tuanku Syed Putra Secondary Science School, Kangar, MALAYSIA

In the palm oil mill plantation, the processing of palm oil fresh fruit bunch (FFB) to produce crude palm oil (CPO) resulting in the production and accumulation of waste product such as empty fruit bunch (EFB). The accumulation of EFB has become environmental problem since its delayed utilization results in its bioconversion to methane that directly contributes to the greenhouse gas emission. In this study, pyrolysis has been carried out to treat EFB using copper oxide coated onto silica oxide (CuO/SiO) catalysts. Pyrolysis is a thermo chemical decomposition of organic material at elevated temperatures in the absence of oxygen. Pyrolysis typically occurs under pressure and at operating temperatures above 430 degree celcius (800 degree fahrenheit). A series of CuO/SiO catalysts calcined at 400 degree celcius, 500 degree celcius, 600 degree celcius, 700 degree celcius and 800 degree celcius for 17 hours was synthesized by impregnation technique. The series of calcined CuO/SiO catalysts are analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) procedure. SEM enables the morphological studies on the synthesized catalysts. The catalytic pyrolysis was experimented using a fixed-bed reactor. The result showed that the 700 degree celcius calcined CuO/SiO catalyst has produced 54% bio-oil, 32% char and 14% gas.

NOVEL BIODEGRADABLE MATERIALS FOR HEAVY METAL REMOVAL: ONE-STEP CIRCULATING SYSTEM FOR ADSORPTION AND ANALYSIS
Hsin-Pei Lee
Kaohsiung Municipal Kaohsiung Girls' Senior High School, Kaohsiung, CHINESE TAIPEI

Heavy metal pollution in water has long been recognized as a serious environmental concern in Taiwan. Adsorption has been proved to be an excellent way to treat waste effluents, offering great feasibility and easy operation. Natural, biodegradable adsorbents were used in this study to develop a simple and effective circulating system for heavy metal adsorption and analysis. Cr(VI) and Cu(II) were chosen as target pollutants because they have been verified to be a public hazard in industrial wastewater; chitosan and C/P (chitosan/gamma-polyglutamic acid) complex were fabricated in the laboratory as adsorbents. To improve removal efficiency, chitosan and C/P complex were applied to porous foam, and vacuum-filtering was added. Furthermore, the theory of spectrophotometry was applied to establish a light dependent resistor (LDR) analysis method. Combining effective biodegradable adsorbents and the instant LDR analysis device, a one-step and instantaneous circulating system for adsorption and analysis was developed in which both cations and anions can be successfully adsorbed. Removal effect of the system under various conditions was also investigated and adsorption mechanisms of Cr(VI) and Cu(II) were discussed. Using chitosan and C/P foam for adsorption of 2.0 ppm Cr(VI) and 10.0 ppm Cu(II), a significant removal rate of 88.8 ~ 97.9% was observed in the batch study. The removal rate of 2.0 ppm Cr(VI) and 10.0 ppm Cu(II) with the system reached to 98.0 ~ 99.6% within 1.5 hrs. The efficient circulating system may provide a new, green and instant approach to effectively remove heavy metal ions in water.

REMEDIATING RADIOACTIVE CONTAMINATION: INVESTIGATING THE EFFECTS OF CHELATING AGENTS AND GROWTH-PROMOTING BACTERIA ON STRONTIUM PHYTOREMEDIATION IN LYCOPERSICON ESCULENTUM
Haley Roman Sproull
Niles North High School, Skokie, IL

Strontium-90, a carcinogenic radioactive agent, is among the most harmful components of nuclear waste. This research aimed to engineer Lycopersicon esculentum to increase the indiscriminate transport of strontium (Sr) over calcium (Ca) within biogenic calcium oxalate crystals (CaC2O4). If engineered to sequester large amounts of Sr, Lycopersicon esculentum may be used as effective Sr phytoremediators in field settings. Chelating agents were used to increase the solubility and subsequent uptake of Sr2+ by plants. The bacteria Pseudomonas were used to counteract the inhibiting effects of stress ethylene. Plants exposed to chelating agents were treated with solutions supplemented either with EDTA or NTA. Plants treated with bacteria were grown from seeds inoculated with one of two strains of Pseudomonas. Characterization of CaC2O4 crystals was achieved through X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Quantification of Ca and Sr was achieved through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Characterization of CaC2O4 crystals proved successful. ICP-MS analysis revealed a significantly lower Ca:Sr ratio in plants treated with chelating agents and Pseudomonas. That is to say, more Ca was replaced by Sr within the CaC2O4 crystals of treated plants. Plants treated with Pseudomonas contained significantly higher concentrations of Ca, suggesting that crystal formation varies directly with biomass. Significantly higher concentrations of Sr were also found in Pseudomonas-treated plants, likely as a result of increased CaC2O4 crystal formation and subsequent Sr sequestration. In conclusion, the treatments proved to have a significant effect on strontium phytoremediation.

THE FUTURE OF CH3CH2OH: THE RE-ENGINEERING OF E85’S CHEMICAL COMPOSITION
Vidal Castaneda
Americas High School, El Paso, TX

In status quo, E-85 provides little to no benefits in the aspect of emissions in comparison to gasoline. Conventional gasoline is a hydrocarbon solution of many different hydrocarbon fuels, alcohols, and ethers to lower emissions whereas standard E-85 has been left as 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline. Furthermore the purpose of the project is to determine if by adding, United States Department of Energy approved, oxygenating hydrocarbons, is it possible to lower internal combustion emissions in a mixture of 85% ethanol and 15% additive. Hydrocarbon additives to be tested are as follows: tert-Butyl Ethyl Ether, Isopropyl Ether, tert-Butyl Methyl Ether, Methanol, 1-Butanol, 2-Butanol, tert-Butyl Alcohol, tert-Amyl Methyl Ether, and natured ethanol. Mixtures of each of the eight fuel solutions were made in a laboratory and burned in a high compression internal combustion engine at a research facility while testing emissions in comparison to those of E-85. Emissions were tested using Department of Transportation approved emissions analysis equipment therefore, data can be considered at a federal level of accuracy. Emissions tested were those tested for during a United States Department of Transportation inspection: carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and aromatic hydrocarbons. All fuel mixtures were successful at lowering carbon based emissions with significant results by a statistical analysis of variance tests, and four of them were able to lower evaporative hydrocarbon emissions by the same tests.

THE EFFECTS OF CARBON DIOXIDE ON AEROPONICS PLANTS
Julian Benjamin Quesada
John B. Alexander High School, Laredo, TX

Leveling off, a term coined by modern innovational farmers, to practice a carbon dioxide boost of up to 2,000ppm of carbon dioxide concentrated in a container with plants purpose of the project is to test whether a carbon boost corroborating with aeroponics can expedite and further increase plant growth. The main materials that were used were two chambers equipped with a built in microprocessor which adjusts the nutrients levels, light cycle, and water for specific plants, and alerts for when the plants need water or nutrients, and a home made container to trap the carbon dioxide in the aeroponic chamber . Equally important materials include tubings, plastic bottles, water, seeds, nutrients, and material to create the pump (yeast, granulated sugar).Perfect indoor conditions and carbon dioxide caused a substantial growth in the plants, cutting the cultivating time by nearly three weeks. Carbon dioxide does affect the growth of plants. Plants can grow better and produce a more constant yield by artificial means using artificial light, regulated temperatures, a controlled environment, and a carbon dioxide boost. This concept could integrate a mass production of urban farming and vertical farming in mega cities to feed the masses of people and save our planet from ecological disaster while using less energy, land , and resources, which will furthermore help our planet from ecological destruction, the ultimate goal of this generation.

EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT GROWING MEDIA IN AQUAPONICS
Abraham Kwan
Moanalua High School, Honolulu, HI

Different media in the aquaponics systems have been components that can either enhance or limit plant growth. Air exposure to the root was discovered to produce more efficient plant growth, and the different media that commercial farmers use varies in the amount of air exposure for the roots. The goal is to working out the details of aquaponics so that it would be commercially useful which would allow the Pacific Islands to decrease dependency on imported food and generate jobs for people.<br><br> Four different types of media were explored throughout this experiment: volcanic cinder seen in the trickle filter, volcanic cinder with an ebb and flow filter, floating Styrofoam raft without air gaps, and floating Styrofoam raft with air gaps. Water chemistry, nitrate and dissolved oxygen, was tested once a week to check whether the plants were receiving sufficient nutrients. At the end of the experiment, a statistical T-test was conducted to compare the average lettuce mass. The volcanic cinder media had significantly larger lettuces compared to the floating raft with or without air gap in multiple trials. It is recommended that commercial aquaponics farmers use the volcanic cinder growing media with a trickle filter to increase the efficiency of their aquaponics systems. <br><br> Red worms (Eisenia fetida) were also added to the aquaponics system to test if there will be any difference in the mineral concentrations. The worms were discovered to have no effect on the mineral content however, they were able to prevent solid accumulation within the grow trays.

A SUSTAINABLE AND LOW COST APPROACH FOR CLEANING METAL CONTAMINATED WATER USING PYROLYZED BANANA PEELS
Bluye B. DeMessie
William Mason High School, Mason, OH

Sorption of metals from polluted water using wastes of banana peels(BW) and banana peels pyrolyzed at 500°C and 600°C(PBW-500, PBW-600) were tested as low-cost adsorbents for Cu(II) removal from aqueous solutions. The adsorbents’ properties were characterized through a variety of methods including Thermo-Gravimetric analysis, Fourier Transfer Infrared Spectroscopy, pH electrophoresis, surface area analysis, SEM imaging, and X-Ray diffraction analysis. Pyrolysis of dried banana peels formed a porous, large surface area adsorbent (50 – 60 m^2/g), with negative surface charges. Pyrolysis increased the adsorption capacity of BP by two orders of magnitude. Initially, a full 2^4 factorial design for each adsorbent with two central points, a total of 18 experiments, were performed. The tests were made to optimize the following factors: mass of adsorbent, pH of solution, tumbling time and initial Cu(II) ion concentration. After optimizing the batch adsorption system by statistical design of experiments, two equilibrium adsorption isotherms for Cu(II) uptake using BW and PBW-500 were performed. The equilibrium adsorption data was modeled using Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. Freundlich’s model fitted the equilibrium data better, and shows the degree of favorability of adsorption of Cu(II)ions with BW and PBW-500 were 0.75 and 1.25 respectively, with adsorption capacities of 4.87 and 351.1 mg/g, respectively. Sorption kinetics followed pseudo second order model. The second order rate constant of Cu(II) adsorption on pyrolyzed BW was found to be 3.73 mg/mgh. Extracting metal pollutants from water using pyrolyzed banana peel as an adsorbent is a low cost, affordable and sustainable approach for cleaning contaminated waters.

A MODEL-BASED APPROACH TO PREDICTING SPECIES' RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE BY CHARACTERIZING COMMUNITY DYNAMICS
Emily Elizabeth Baczyk
Choate Rosemary Hall, Wallingford, CT

My goal was to determine how a climate change-induced temperature increase of 4˚C over the next 100 years would affect the composition of ecological communities occurring along an elevational or latitudinal temperature gradient, with the objective of determining what conservation strategies might be most effective. To this end, I developed a novel computer-based model of a general community with three different trophic levels, representing the basal (e.g., plants), intermediate (e.g., herbivores), and top (e.g., predators) species typical of a food web. Consumptive and competitive interactions between these species were approximated with discretized difference equations. I incorporated temperature-dependence for many species- and trophic-level parameters including conversion efficiency, handling time, and reproductive fitness. I used empirical data to derive parameter values and established theoretical models to define the relationships between species and with their environment. Various model formulations with differing community size and composition were created, reflecting the diversity observed in nature. In each case, the model was run to quasi-equilibrium under current mean annual temperature, and then subjected to a 0.04˚C rise per year, over 100 years, or until communities reached a new quasi-equilibrium. I discovered the presence of strong bottom-up controls and some top-down indirect effects in the communities by examining the effects of rising temperatures and trophic vs. non-trophic interactions on the number of species extinctions, changes in community diversity, and formation of novel interactions. My results suggest that conserving plant species is most important to preserving the biodiversity of a community during climate change.

REVOLUTIONIZING OIL SPILL REMEDIATION VIA MODIFIED LUFFA CYLINDRICA
Kristin Nicole Wong
Jericho High School, Jericho, NY

With a rise in industrialization, oil spills have become a major environmental issue. Current remediation methods are expensive and cause oil leaching, so an inexpensive and stable adsorbing system is needed. A major objective of this study was to engineer a superhydrophobic and superoleophilic adsorbent for oil adsorption and oil-water separation. Pieces of Luffa cylindrica were treated in N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF), N,N-Dimethylacetamide (DMAc)/Lithium Chloride (LiCl), and Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) to enhance surface roughness and hydrophobicity. To render the luffas superhydrophobic, they were treated in 2-6% AminopropylIsobutyl/TriSilanolPhenyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) solutions. Various oils were utilized to evaluate adsorption capacities and recyclabilities of untreated and modified luffas. The 7% DMAc/LiCl + 2% AminopropylIsobutyl POSS-treated luffa exhibited the greatest adsorption capacity (10.4 wt/wt), significantly higher than that of the unmodified luffa (5.2 wt/wt) and K-Sorb Hydrophobic Particulate (3.7 wt/wt) (p=.00016). Optimal adsorption was exhibited using pump oil, which has a viscosity of 86 cP. The modified luffas, which cost ~$0.02 apiece after treatment, demonstrated excellent recyclability and selectivity, indicative of potential use for oil spill remediation. In the future, the adsorbing capabilities of the modified luffas should be compared to additional commercial adsorbents, and extended recyclability tests should be conducted.

SUCCESSIONAL SEQUENCE OF WATER QUALITY AND MACROINVERTEBRATES IN A PLAYA WETLAND SYSTEM
Tayler Ann Rocha
Monte Vista High School, Monte Vista, CO

The goal of this project is to describe the lentic succession of a playa basin after a flood event, analyze its hydrology, and compare it to existing mature wetlands. The experimental basin lies halfway between the San Luis Lakes and Blanca Wetlands complexes. Water quality and macroinvertebrate samples were taken on 8/31 and 9/14/12 from both experimental and control sites, and analyzed at the water quality lab. Basin perimeters were mapped on 8/31, 9/08, and 9/14/12 using a Trimble Geoexplorer 2004 and ArcGIS software. It was found that most water quality parameters increased as time and distance from the inlet pipe increased, and the semi-permanent wetland control (C2) more closely resembled the experimental basin then did the playa control (C1). Macroinvertebrate abundance increased through time, and the greatest diversity was sampled near areas with ancestral playa pans as opposed to areas receiving water for the first time in decades. Overall, biomass was greater in the upper basin but macroinvertebrates in lower basin were larger. Total biomass estimates for the combined basins would yield 1015.5 kg of insect forage. It was also found that of the 189996.2 m3 of delivered water, only 38.7% of it remained on the ground during active flooding, yielding a total basin volume of ~52000 m3. For land managers making decisions about wetland management, water table levels, evaporation rates, timing, and presence of ancestral pans should be considered when planning water application for the benefit of migratory and nesting waterfowl.

REPLACING SUPER ABSORBENT POLYMERS IN DISPOSABLE DIAPERS WITH SUGARCANE BAGASSE
Salvador Alvarado
Escola Americana De Campinas, Campinas, BRASIL

Super Absorbent Polymers (SAP) are a fairly new element in modern disposable diapers. While proven to be efficient absorbents, manufacturing these polymers is expensive and harmful to the environment. At the same time, large amounts of sugarcane bagasse are used every day as fuel, not tapping into its potential as a natural, biodegradable absorbent. This project aims to find if SAP can be partially replaced with bagasse. The first part of the experiment was to compare the absorbent efficiency of the bagasse and the SAP. After several tests, it was proven that 4.8 grams of bagasse are needed to absorb the same amount of water that 1 gram of SAP absorbs. The next step was to replace specific amounts of SAP with bagasse in a diaper proportionally to the previously obtained data. In a medium sized diaper, an average of 10.5 grams of SAP are used. One gram of SAP was removed and replaced with 4.8 grams of bagasse. Diapers were then sealed and secured. The final step was to test the bagasse-modified diaper for absorbency against un-modified diapers from the same production lot. The un-modified diapers soaked up water from a range of 903 grams to 1008 grams; the modified diaper with bagasse soaked up water within a range of 914 to 917 grams. In conclusion, the SAP in diapers can be partially replaced with bagasse without affecting the diaper’s performance.

ERODING EROSION
Elizabeth Daley
Saint David High School, Saint David, AZ

Intense wildfires destroy necessary vegetation and alter the properties of the soil. This leads to erosion which has many devastating effects including, but not limited to: loss of topsoil, that contains essential nutrients for forest plants; water pollution, which harms native wildlife; and major flooding, which can destroy homes and wash out roads. With wild fires scheduled to double in the next twenty years, this is a major problem. <br><br> In this experiment containers of soil were exposed to a simulation of heavy to moderate rainfall. Each container tested a different variable used to limit erosion: reseeding, log terraces, straw wattles, and then a control group that had no method of erosion control. Soil loss was measured in grams, and then calculated into a percentage showing the effectiveness of the technique to counter erosion. All the methods were beneficial, and cut down soil loss by more than half. Reseeding the soil was most effective retaining 97.27%. Log terraces followed retaining 90.69% of the original soil. The straw wattle method was a close third with 89.35% soil retention. The control lost 78.30% of the original soil.

A FILTER TODAY KEEPS POLLUTANTS AWAY: A STUDY OF NANOFIBER BASED STORMWATER FILTRATION
Darby Kathryn Schumacher
Baylor School, Chattanooga, TN

Pollution of our local waterways is an important issue. Water pollution not only adversely affects aquatic life, but also human safety during recreational uses of the water. Stormwater runoff from roads, constructions sites, agriculture, and other non-point pollution is a main factor in high nutrient, pathogen, metal, sediment, and chemical levels. Fifteen percent of all surface waters in the Middle Tennessee-Chickamauga Watershed are listed as impaired according to the Clean Water Act of 1998. A significant source of this impairment is from storm drain runoff, the majority flowing untreated into the Tennessee River, contaminating my favorite place to spend time during the summer months. This is why I chose to build a filter to fit inside, or around, storm drain outfalls to decrease the amount of sediment, excessive nutrients, metals, pathogens, and various other pollutants that can make water harmful to aquatic life and humans.<br><br>I designed and built two nylon polymer nanofiber and activated carbon based filters to test their mitigating effects on stormwater drain pollution that flows into the Tennessee River. Through several water testing protocols I determined that my filter, incorporating nanofiber material of 2gsm (grams per square meter) density, had minimal acceptable flow rate reduction and a high pollution mitigation efficiency, identifying it as the most practical and inexpensive choice for a storm drain outfall water filter. Further research and filter engineering has led to the expansion of the potential practical uses of my water filter to include clean residential water capture via downspout, clean rain barrel water storage, developing world clean water capture, and potential commercial use with the City of Chattanooga.

USING CHLAMYDOMONAS REINHARDTII AS A BIOREMEDIATION AGENT IN ARSENIC CONTAMINATED WATER
Rachel Suzanne Ehlers
North Toole County High School, Sunburst, MT

The purpose of this experiment was to determine if Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (blue-green algae) could successfully remediate water that had been contaminated with arsenic. I hypothesized that this type of algae would lower arsenic levels of this water over time. <br><br> I cultured algae using Bold’s Basal Medium, a growth medium for Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and distilled water, for weeks until I had cultured enough for my experiment, which was an amount of 6 liters of algae water. I divided the algae water into 4 different parts, each of 1.5 liters. I then contaminated the water with arsenate, a soluble arsenic. For each of the 4 parts, I inserted a different level of arsenic. The four dilutions were 0 mL, 1 mL, 10 mL, and 20 mL. I then tested the initial levels of arsenic using an arsenic test and then divided the water into five flasks per group. I tested the arsenic levels after 5 days and then after 2 weeks. I also performed cell counts of each flask on the fifth and tenth day to determine if arsenic affected the test organism population. <br><br> When comparing the decline of arsenic levels of each group over time, the results were statistically significant. Cell counts of the algae were not statistically significant. <br><br> Based on my results, I accepted my hypothesis that Chlamydomonas reinhardtii can act as a bioremediation agent in water contaminated by arsenic.

RAIN, RAIN, FLUSH AWAY
Julia London
Queen of Angels Academy, Dorval, CANADA

With population increasing and the fresh water supplies decreasing, new measures need to be taken to conserve the world’s fresh water. Today, water is also more expensive than oil & gas. The purpose of this design is to replace fresh, clean, water in toilets, with rainwater. A family of 4 using a standard toilet (19L per flush), with 4 flushes a day per person translates to over 120,000 L of fresh water wasted per year. <br><br>Using a wooden doll house (4 levels) vinyl tubing was hooked up to a reservoir and to different toilets. A large Ziploc© acts as the reservoir and 3 smaller Ziplocs© act as toilets. Vinyl tubing attached to the bottom of the reservoir, by a brass insert, is linked to the 3 toilets and the water flow at each toilet is controlled by an on and off valve. At the top of the reservoir there is an overflow, which is a brass barb connected to a larger vinyl tubing. At each of the toilets there are also brass barbs attached at the top, their function is to act as a drain which is attached to the same larger tubing.<br><br>Redirecting the gutters so they empty into the reservoir would allow for the rain off a roof to empty into the reservoir. Outside North America people collect and use rainwater for common household uses. By adding treatments such as, chlorination, ozonation, ultraviolet (UV) light, and membrane filtration rainwater could be used for other uses. Melting snow could also be another water supply, during the winter for countries with snow.

TRAP SUNLIGHT AND SOLAR RADIATION REDUCER
Ana Laura Barrales Walt
Escuela Preparatoria Oficial No. 40, Jaltepec, MEXICO

The project collecting sunlight and reducing solar radiation is an artifact that is 5 points ls purposes which are: 1. - Reduce solar radiation on where you are, 2. - Provide potable water, 3. - Raise water temperature to its boiling point, 4. - Give water temperature from inside the place in which it is installed, 5. - contribute to the conservation of water resources. This device consists of three parts called the highest upper manifold and hexagon shaped, this is constructed of 6mm glass mirror, here is given an extra amount of heat rays bounce mirrors, here comes the water also drinking, the second part is called container and is made of aluminum plates, and is sealed with polyurethane foam black color, this allows the water to maintain its temperature without losing heat, the third part is called lower manifold that is made of a box of 6mm glass and mirror, where were placed inside the water heater tubes which allow the fluid to have a cycle because the water loses density as it gets warmer, more point is that the materials with the fact that they are capable of withstanding high temperatures without deforming or water have some chemical change, are also capable of attracting solar rays but not let out due to the way in which it is located. So the collector works only with natural energy.

NATURAL FUNGICIDES, AN ALTERNATIVE FOR AGRICULTURE
Adrian Alberto Contreras Gonzalez
Instituto America, Culiacan, MEXICO

Nowadays, some of the main environmental problems are generated as a result of using chemicals to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms in agricultural fields. These phytopathogens cause diseases and a low production in cryptogamic plants. Chemicals used to control pests cause damage to the environment and health problems, they affect our respiratory system and cause diseases generated by eating contaminated food with chemical residues.<br><br>A natural alternative "FUNAT" made of (Azadirachta indica and Swietenia humilis) was developed, to control the growth of plant pathogenic microorganisms and mitigate the harmful effects to the environment.<br><br>This product was subjected to various tests of efficacy, was confronted with two species of phytopathogens (Aspergillus sp. Fusarium oxysporum and ciceris). <br><br>The ideal concentration of FUNAT was calculated to be used in agricultural fields. Later, was confirmed the inhibitory activity in maize plants, using FUNAT for the prevention and elimination of these funguses. FUNAT will give farmers an alternative environmentally friendly, the prolonged use of chemical fungicides creates severe pollution in soil, water and air, the short-term impact is not only about our health it could cause deterioration of the flora and fauna. With FUNAT, the pollution in agricultural fields will decrease and it will avoid diseases and poisonings caused by eating food contaminated with toxics residues.<br><br>The monitoring of food borne diseases and control of food and environmental pollution have been greatly neglected being that are essential tools for the assessment of health risks because there have been drastic cases where by consuming contaminated food these chemical residues causes the development of cancers.

MAKING DRINKABLE WATER FROM THIN AIR: THE OPTIMIZATION OF A HYDROPHOBIC SURFACE TO EFFICIENTLY HARVEST FOG PROVIDING A SUSTAINABLE SECONDARY WATER SOURCE
Michael Fernandez Vermeland
Loudoun County Academy of Science, Sterling, VA

There are places in the world that have low annual precipitation, thus a shortage of potable water, but that also have frequent fog episodes resulting in brief periods of high relative humidity. This project addresses this disparity by using varying hydrophobic solutions to capture water from the fog using a treated polypropylene mesh. Each tested climate condition represents an actual location on Earth in which this type of fog episode occurs. Two different treatments, copper acetate palmitic acid dispersion and copper stearate dispersion, were chosen as hydrophobic surfaces and tested against each other under varying relative humidities. Copper acetate palmitic acid raises off the polypropylene while the copper stearate lays flat, as demonstrated through scanning electron microscopy. The hydrophobicity of the two treatments was compared by finding the water surface contact angle between the mesh and collected water using high resolution photography. The treatments were sprayed onto a hydrophobic polypropylene mesh using a nitrogen dispersion system and placed in an environmental chamber of varying relative humidities. The beaded water was collected and quantified, and t-tests were run after subtracting out background humidity. Two-sample T-tests demonstrated statistically significant difference between the treated and untreated as well as the two treatments against one another. Additionally, HPLC was used to demonstrate the hydrophobic solutions were not contaminating the water. Calculations demonstrate this method is 25 times less expensive than traditional desalinization methods, leading to possible economically and environmentally friendly implantation.

USING SPENT COFFEE GROUNDS IN PURIFYING DRINKING WATER AND REMOVING ODOUR IN AIR
Tsui Yee Naomi Ko
St. Paul's Convent School, Hong Kong, HONG KONG

This project explores the possibility of using spent coffee grounds from 2 coffee chains to adsorb dyes, heavy metals ions and undesirable gases, all of which adversely affect the ecological balance and human health. Both types of coffee grounds were treated with laboratory chemicals (e.g. nitric acid, sodium hydroxide, hydrogen peroxide, deionized water), household chemicals (e.g. vinegar and bleach), or remained untreated. Spent green and black tea leaves, activated carbon and bamboo charcoal were also prepared. A total of 24 adsorbents were made.<br><br>The adsorption efficiency of 4 types of coffee grounds treated with laboratory chemicals on five dyes, five metal ions (copper(II), nickel(II), cobalt(II), zinc and lead(II)), and two gases (ammonia and hydrogen sulphide) were determined by colorimetry, gravimetric and volumetric analysis respectively. Then, all 24 adsorbents were tested on Gentian violet, copper(II) ion and ammonia. <br><br>Nitric-acid treated adsorbents performed very well in adsorbing dyes and hydrogen sulphide, while deionized water treatment was the best in metal ion and ammonia adsorption. Dye adsorption efficiency could be further enhanced by sodium hydroxide pretreatment. Roasting temperature did not have a large effect on coffee grounds’ adsorption efficiency as coffee grounds from both chains performed similarly. Coffee grounds generally performed better than tea leaves adsorbents.<br><br>My investigation also showed that applying coffee ground adsorbents in households or in large scale filters is possible. Spent coffee grounds showed comparable adsorption efficiencies to commercial adsorbents in certain areas. In conclusion, there is substantial recycling value of spent coffee grounds to treat pollution problems.

GUZZLER ELEVATIONS
Cole Dee Crim
Pershing County High School, Lovelock, NV

The purpose of this project was to figure out at what elevation we should build more guzzlers based upon the number and variety of wildlife that use existing guzzlers today. I set 6 motion activated cameras at guzzlers, 2 on top of the mountain, 2 at the middle of the mountain, and 2 in the middle. I checked the cameras every two weeks and exchange the SD memory cards. Then I would take SD cards to school and put the data into data tables, I repeated this process for 15 weeks. My equipment included: 6 motion activated cameras, 6 python grip locks, 12 SD memory cards, and my father with his truck. A guzzler is a man-made water source for wildlife, in Nevada we are lucky to get 7 inches of rain in a year. This is why we need to have water sources for vast wildlife. a big game guzzler has 4 huge tanks underneath the apron, the apron is a roof that catches precipitation and drains into a gutter system (like on a house) and the gutter leads to the tanks, the tanks lead to a drinker which is where the animals drink from.

THE ECOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT OF TURFGRASS MIXTURES TO REDUCE IRRIGATED WATER CONSUMPTION
Connor John Klemenhagen
Champlin Park High School, Champlin, MN

Freshwater resources are among the most precious on Earth yet continue to be consumed at an unsustainable rate. With turfgrass being the largest irrigated crop in the United States, reducing the amount of water used by lawns can have a substantial and essential impact.<br><br> Using ecological model data from previous research, mixtures were developed for the purpose of using less water to achieve equivalent visual aesthetics of currently available mixtures and typical lawns. Green cover ratings were measured first by standard visual ratings, then by digital image analysis. Being grown in a controlled environment of light and temperature, and established with equal factors such as soil mass and irrigation volumes, the water use of a mixture was quantified using differences in pot masses during drydown.<br><br> Of all mixtures tested and developed specifically for drought tolerance, Tall Fescue and Kentucky Bluegrass mixtures performed strongest. These competitively stable mixtures maintained desirable green cover for approximately 6 days longer than the conventional mixtures, while losing 20mL less water. This data estimates that the improved mixtures used, on average, 41 milliliters less water than their counterparts during the 4 week drought period.<br><br> Having established a basis for studying turfgrass ecological functions and applying this knowledge to develop more drought tolerant mixtures, the goal and purpose of the study were achieved. However, mixtures need to be further improved to use less water and remain greener for longer, with the ultimate goal being better irrigation practices working in collaboration with better turfgrass.

PURIFYING BATH WATER FOR ITERATIVE USE
Vijaya Ravali Dasari
White Station High School, Memphis, TN

Perhaps one of the most extreme problems in the world today is the lack of proper personal hygiene in developing countries. Many people in these areas do not have access to sufficient clean water, and they cannot afford to bathe regularly. To combat this misfortune, I wondered if I could create a device to increase the availability of clean water to enhance peoples’ hygiene. I wanted to create an apparatus to purify bath water for reuse as more bath water and therefore increase the number of people who can bathe with the same water. <br><br>After extensive research, experimentation, and weeks of hard work, I created a functioning apparatus. My inexpensive system for purifying and filtering the bath water used sand, cotton balls, an activated carbon filter, several mesh filters, and ultraviolet light to clean the dirty, soapy water and make it about 95% clean. The purpose of the activated carbon filter is to remove toxicity from the water and avoid the possibility of the water becoming putrid. Furthermore, the ultraviolet light is used to kill remaining bacteria after the water has flowed through all of the other parts of the apparatus. The cotton balls absorb some of the dirty water, retain the dirt, and release the water slowly. Additionally, the sand and mesh filters remove much of the dirt and soap by not allowing it to pass through. In the future, this apparatus can be enlarged, distributed globally, and lead to a more hygienic and healthy world.

USING HYDROPONICS TO PHYTOREMEDIATE COPPER FROM WATER USING BRASSICA JUNCEA AND ERUCA SATIVA
Katie Elizabeth Thorp
Fort Myers High School, Fort Myers, FL

This experiment examines the impact of using hydroponics to phytoremediate copper from water using Brassica juncea, and Eruca sativa. Copper is a naturally occurring element that is necessary for all living things to survive, however, too much of copper can also be hazardous, and in some instances toxic, to aquatic life. The experimental plan is to simulate run off of plant fertilizer into water, and place the simulated runoff water into hydroponic reservoirs where the plant roots of Brassica juncea, and Eruca sativa are growing. The researcher will then examine, measure and compare the copper levels of the reservoir over a two week period to identify trends and variations.<br><br>To conduct the experiment, the researcher constructed a deep water culture hydroponics system and used twelve Brassica juncea plants, and twelve Eruca sativa plants. The roots of these plants were submerged in their individual reservoirs, and each container had different concentrations of copper. To measure copper, the researcher used a color indicator kit that required a 5 mL water sample and ten drops of copper indicator solution.<br><br>After review of the data, it was concluded that both Brassica juncea, and Eruca sativa were successful in remediating copper contaminated water. Both plants were able to reduce the copper concentration by more than ninety percent. This is very encouraging for applications in many copper contaminated areas and it would be very easy and cost efficient to use phytoremediation as a primary method of reducing copper in aquatic areas.

MYCOREMEDIATION: A SOLUTION TO RUNOFF POLLUTION?
Devon M Enke
La Veta High School, La Veta, CO

If forests are planet Earth’s lungs, then water is certainly planet Earth’s blood. Sadly, pollution caused by human activity is poisoning our planet’s waters, our planet’s life blood everyday. <br><br>As water flows across the landscape, it picks up pollutants from numerous sources. This is called Non-Point Source (NPS) pollution. NPS pollutants like oil, fertilizer and pesticides are having devastating effects on water quality.<br><br><br>This project was designed to determine if straw filters (commonly used by roadsides / construction zones) colonized by Pleurotus ostreatus (PO) could collect and neutralize common NPS pollutants. <br><br>Experiment: Straw filters were made. Half colonized by PO, half un-colonized as Controls. Three polluted water samples were run through filters: Fertilizer, pesticide, used motor oil. Water tests were done before and after filtration. Filters were retained18 days post testing for pollutant exposure / neutralization evaluation. Straw, mycelium and water samples were run through a mass-spectrometer for elemental data.<br><br>Experiment was replicated 3X.<br><br><br>Results: Control filters had a minimal effect. PO filters effectively filtered out nitrates, nitrites and heavy metals. PO filters captured 244% more oil than Control filters. After 18 days of pollutant saturation, mycelium showed no signs of stress under the microscope. All PO filters began producing healthy fruiting bodies. Mass-spec data is pending.<br><br><br>These results show that PO colonized straw filters can effectively collect and potentially neutralize common NPS pollutants. I believe Mycoremediation can help solve many environmental challenges. Being open to new, creative solutions can help us jump far ahead in restoring and maintaining the health of the planet.

SUSTAINING ECOLOGICAL BIODIVERSITY WITH HIGHLY SPECIFIC RNA INTERFERENCE (RNAI)
Neha Kambam Reddy
Lincoln Park Academy, Fort Pierce, FL

Emerging strategies for pest and disease management, based on RNA interference (RNAi), now provide a highly specific biopesticide, which can target pest species while not affecting beneficial organisms and other non-target insects. RNAi is a natural, immunological, cellular process that is now used to down-regulate targeted messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts. RNAi was utilized to reduce two insect pests. Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri) transmits the most serious citrus infecting bacterium, which has resulted in the loss of billions of dollars since 2006; brown citrus aphid (Toxoptera citricidus) transmits serious viral disease of citrus. A double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) treatment was designed against the arginine kinase mRNA in both species. A cut plant feeding assay was used in each of the three trials, comprised of 4 control and 4 treated citrus cuttings. Treatments were either 12 psyllids or 10 aphids. Observations of survivorship were recorded daily for 11 days. Only plant cuttings that appeared to be ‘viable’ were used in the experiment. Unlike insecticides, which kill targeted pests and non-targeted insects such as honey bees, use of designed dsRNA treatments to induce RNAi can be highly species specific. Here it is demonstrated that a dsRNA treatment can induce significant insect mortality in two pest species, while not in a closely related hemipteran suggesting that utilization of RNAi is a viable technique for pest management. RNAi strategies, which are more environmentally friendly than current management techniques, provide a means to sustain ecological biodiversity and land productivity by maintaining natural populations.

USE OF CO-SOLVENTS TO ENHANCE ASTAXANTHIN EXTRACTION FROM L. SETIFERUS SHELLS WITH VEGETABLE OILS
Shixuan Justin Li
Rutherford High School, Panama City, FL

Astaxanthin is a valuable antioxidant found in crustaceans. Of the annual, global production of 4.5 million tons of shrimp, 50% by weight (heads and shells) are discarded. Cost-effective utilization of these shrimp processing wastes can improve the energy efficiency of the shrimp harvest operation, reduce environmental burdens to the ecological system, and facilitate sustainable development. Literature reports vegetable oils as effective solvents for Astaxanthin extraction from wet shrimp shells. This study aims at enhancing the efficiency of Astaxanthin extraction with vegetable oils by adding a co-solvent and developing a simpler extraction method. <br><br>Sunflower oil and safflower oil were control solvents. Vitamin E was the co-solvent. Sunflower oil with 10% Vitamin E and safflower oil with 20% Vitamin E were used as test solvents. Astaxanthin was quantified using the established spectrophotometric method. <br><br>A new extraction method utilizing dry shrimp shell powder was demonstrated with a bench-top prototype. The addition of vitamin E increased Astaxanthin concentration by 76% in sunflower oil and 56% in safflower oil, respectively. My hypothesis was proven correct that a co-solvent can improve the extraction efficiency. The total Astaxanthin measured in this study (7.0 mg/100 g dry L. setiferus shell) was compared to the reported value of 6.5 mg/100g of the same shrimp species. Furthermore, the processing time was reduced from 1 hour to about 2 minutes with new procedures. A preliminary cost analysis further suggests cost advantages of the dry over the wet method. A 100X scale-up model was developed to demonstrate the scalability of the process.

THE NOVEL IMPLEMENTATION OF BIOCHAR CATHODES IN MICROBIAL FUEL CELLS (PHASE I)
Meghana Vijay Rao
Jesuit High School, Portland, OR

In this research, a novel biochar cathode was developed and evaluated. Microbial fuel cells could contribute to energy production. Large-scale MFC applications are lacking because of low power generation and high electrode costs. Platinum cathodes encompass 60% of the cost of MFCs; one of the largest obstacles is development of feasible cathodes. The goal of this research was to determine whether biochar, pyrolized organic matter (conventionally a soil amendment), could operate as a feasible cathode in a MFC. <br><br>Biochar was made from three feedstock (mixed wood chips, Douglas fir, yellow pine) at 670C and four feedstock (Arundo Donax, Douglas fir, brewer’s grain, plant fiber) at 1100C. Biochar was crushed to < 63µm particle size. A ratio of binders to biochar was determined, unified with the biochar, and the biochar catalyst polymer was spread across 20cm2 stainless steel mesh. The cathodes were tested using an electrochemical test cell and linear sweep voltammetry. A traditional platinum cathode was the control. <br><br>Biochar cathodes made at 670C had current densities below 1.2A/m2 within the potential of 0-.1V. Biochar cathodes made at 1100C had higher current densities. The Douglas fir 1100C cathode demonstrated highest current density of 2.02 – 4.9A/m2. This is comparable to the lower bound of the platinum cathodes (5.3 – 12A/m2). The biochar cathode developed was 50x cheaper than the platinum cathode ($22-44 vs. $1500). Fifty to sixty biochar cathodes could be made for the cost of 1 platinum cathode, producing 25x more current. Future research involves increasing the efficiency of the biochar cathode.

PHYTOREMEDIATION OF A LEAD-CONTAMINATED MEDIUM
Ted Kenner Berrios
Jose Rojas Cortes High School, Orocovis, PUERTO RICO

Phytoremediation of a lead-contaminated medium<br><br>The problem under study was; Will Bryophyllum pinnatum be a hyperaccumulator plant without having toxicity symptoms, and will it allow for the remediation of a lead-contaminated medium? Scientific literature evidences the importance of phytoremediation to clean metal contaminated soil. Based on such studies the following hypothesis was studied: If Bryophyllum pinnatum plants are exposed to a lead contaminated medium, then its toxicology will not be affected, allowing the plant to act as a hyperaccumulator and be able to remedy it. This investigation intends to verify whether the accumulation of heavy metals in soils can be naturally treated with plants that absorb metals (hyperaccumulation) allowing soil reuse and avoiding environmental and human health threats.<br><br>Plants were grown in vitro in two different mediums during different periods of time (25 and 90 days). Then the plants were transferred to the Hogland growth medium in an aeroponic process for 21 days. Plants were divided into experimental and control groups. Experimental plants were exposed to a 5 ppm lead solution during 72 hours. Genetic, physiological and chemical analysis of plants were performed to determine if they have metallothionein gene, which accumulates metals, and whether the chlorophyll content and plant growth are affected. The chemical analysis through atomic absorption was to determine the per cent of lead accumulated in the plants. It was concluded that in vitro grown Bryophyllum pinnatum was able to hyperaccumulate lead and has the metallothionein gene. The plant suffered no toxic effects and can be used for phytorremediation of lead-contaminated environments.

REMOVAL OF COPPER FROM AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS THROUGH SPENT BLEACHING EARTH
Apisada Chulakadabba
Mahidol Wittayanusorn School, Nakhon Pathom, THAILAND

The spent bleaching earth (SBE) from palm oil refining process, decoloring, is a great quantity of solid waste, which requires special means of disposal and management. In order to reduce this waste, this present work aims to reutilize the SBE as an adsorbent for adsorption of heavy metal (Cu (II) ion) in wastewater. Prior to the adsorption study, the entrapped oil in the SBE was extracted with hexane and the obtained SBE was dried at 100 °C for 2 hours. The effects of various parameters including suitable pH, initial metal ion concentration, amount of SBE and contact time were studied. It was found that the removal rate of SBE decreased with an increase of the initial Cu (II) concentration. The removal percentage of Cu (II) ion was more than 90% at the initial concentration of 40 ppm, and practically 100% when the initial concentration was 0.5 ppm using 2 g/L SBE in solution at pH 7. It was also found that removal percentage of the SBE was slightly higher than that of the pristine bleaching earth. The maximum adsorption capacity was 45 mg/g at pH 7 and contact time of 10 minutes. The adsorption isotherm was in good agreement with the Freundlich model, and the kinetic adsorption followed the pseudo-second order. The adsorption capacity of the SBE was significantly higher than that of the virgin bleaching earth (VBE) (p<0.01) at 40 ppm Cu (II) solution, and was slightly higher at 100 ppm Cu (II) solution. When tested with industrial wastewater containing 83.7 ppm of Cu (II), the adsorption capacity of SBE was 20 mg/g. In addition, the SBE powder was made into the pellets so as to make it easily recovered after use. The SBE pellets showed 79 % removal. The results suggest that the SBE is a suitable material for adsorption of Cu (II) from aqueous solution.

STUDY OF TENORM DEPOSITS IN OIL FIELD EQUIPMENT
Alexander James Spilman
Mandan High School, Mandan, ND

Oil Patch equipment and oil waste products are coated with concentrations of Naturally-Occurring Radioactive Materials (NORM) mobilized by liquids. Once the NORM is concentrated or exposed by human activities, it is classified as TENORM (Technologically-Enhanced, Naturally-Occurring Radioactive Materials). By dissolving oil field equipment solids (salts) in acids, radioactive constituents can be removed. <br><br>In the experiment performed, radioactive salt byproducts from oil field equipment was collected and then mixed with acids to see which acid would best break down the salts. Which salts to collect were decided by measuring the amount of radiation emitted using a Canberra Industries InSpector 1000 Digital Hand-held MCA. The salts were collected from Bakken oil patch discarded equipment located in a scrap bone yard. Five different radioactive samples were collected from various equipment. Each sample was from a different piece of equipment with amounts of radiation levels from.085microCuries to 2.812microCuries. Only three of the samples were used in the experiment. Two were disregarded because one was an oil based solution and the other was insulation that had radioactive materials on it. Five grams of samples were measured then mixed with different organic and inorganic acids to test solubility. After being mixed with acids and let settle the solutions were then filtered and dried. Once the remaining material was dried it was then measured to see the amount of salts that broke down in acids. Sulfuric and Phosphoric acid, inorganic acids were the best agents for the decomposition of the different salts.

THE TROUBLE WITH TYPHA LATIFOLIA
Sarah Nicole Telehey
Trinity Christian School, Williston, ND

My question is what is the most effective way to prevent Typha Laifolia (cattails) from influencing the flood protection provided by the Corps of Engineers? My hypothesis is that solution 1 will work the best. I started by building replicas of the problem area. To do this, I took three big plastic containers. Then I used concrete to form a mold of the marsh at a 1 in. depth, the channel at a 4 in. depth, and the dike. After the concrete dried, I placed my wall in solution one. This wall would allow water to flow underneath while stopping the flow of the cattail rafts on top. Then I put the poles in place for the second solution. The poles are placed strategically to push the cattail rafts toward the land where a backhoe could go in and remove them. Then I put in the wall for the third solution. This is a lot like the first solution except the wall is supposed to push the cattail rafts into an overflow area where they would remain until needed to be removed. Then I put the pumps in. I had to wire the pumps through a heat switch so I would be able to control the speed at which the pumps flowed. Next, I filed the containers with water up to the 4 in. mark. I made the cattail rafts out of chunks of Styrofoam. Each raft was 2 in. by 2 in. with a thickness of 1/2 in. I placed three rafts in each test. Then I started the pumps and ran them for 15 minutes then recorded the results. I did this 10 times. The first solution stopped all 3 rafts every time. The second solution was very inconsistent and ended up different each time. The third solution stopped all three rafts 70% of the time. The control test never stopped and rafts and that resulted in clogged pumps. My conclusion is that my hypothesis was proven to be correct.

TEA FOR A CLEAN SEA: THE USE OF COMMON POROUS MATERIALS TO FILTER POLLUTED WATER
Sugirtha Panneerselvam
Plano East Senior High School, Plano, TX

As industrialization steadily increases, there is also a rise in industrial waste that can contain harmful concentrations of lead, cadmium, and nickel. Currently, filters with activated carbon are used to try and prevent the spread of these metals, but economically and environmentally are not the best choice. To combat this distribution, a more efficient filter was designed with the belief that biodegradable porous materials, such as activated tea remains, would be more effective. <br><br>After all filtration materials were purified and activated, the efficiency of activated tea remains, coffee remains, and carbon was tested against varying concentrations of solutions of lead, cadmium, and nickel. The concentration of heavy metals was determined before and after using each filter, which proved that the activated tea remains were the most effective at removing heavy metal pollution. In order to test the effect of the filtration method on the behavior of invertebrates, the life span and heartbeat of daphnia were also studied. When activated tea remains were used, the life span increased by 300% and the heartbeat patterns were healthier. Thus, the activated tea remains filter once again proved to be the best choice for industries to use.<br><br>In conclusion, the activated tea remains filter is not only 13,000% more economical than its counterparts, but also more efficient. Industries will not hesitate to install this filter due to its cost-effective nature. Furthermore, this filter is more sensitive to aquatic animals, essentially proving to be a mutually beneficial asset to industrialists and the environment.

«SMART GATE» MODULE AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO IN-ROAD SENSORS USED IN ITS
Gleb Semyannikov
Lyceum #11, Chelyabinsk, RUSSIA

In this work, an alternative to expensive, difficult to install and maintain in-road sensors used in ITS, is offered. <br><br>It is suggested not to count cars, but to perform integrating comparison of quantity of cars which gathered in different directions in noise level by means of a directional microphone and of a sound spectrum analyzer.<br><br>Directional microphone measures the noise level. Audio spectrum analyzer filters sounds with the running engine sound frequency, and the microcontroller calculates the best green light timing option and gives the appropriate commands to the traffic lights. In order to confirm the hypothesis concerning the possibility of using a combination of the directional microphone and audio spectrum analyzer, following experiment had been set up.<br><br>Running car noise had been recorded and the spectrogram of this record was obtained using the audio analyzer. In the analysis of the recorded sound spectrogram the stable peak at frequency of 170 Hz was found. We believe that in order to measure the noise level in the bands the frequency range close to this value shall be used. Thus we can get rid of most unwanted noises and isolate the sound of cars, thereby reducing the error further calculations made by the microcontroller. We called this system the «Smart gate» module, this module is compact, mounted on a traffic light pole and does not require additional structures to accommodate. When the «Smart gate» modules will be fitted with battery or alternative energy sources such as solar batteries, then the equipment of signaled crossing will not require laying any service lines. Proposed approach may allow refusing of the numerous, expensive and difficult to use in-road sensors and create "smart crossings" with a high capacity, lower cost and in shorter terms.

INVASIVE BARGE IN: IS A VOLTAGE VOID PRODUCED BY BARGES CROSSING ELECTRONIC FISH BARRIERS?
Brandon Brady Benninger
Boone Grove Senior High School, Valparaiso, IN

Previous research outlines an idea regarding a potentially devastating defect to the Asian Carp electronic fish barrier system in Romeoville IL. If this defect does exist,the barrier system would prove to be ineffective in the battle to keep them from Great Lakes. The purpose of my research was to determine if there is a void of low electricity (bubble) that occurs under a metal barge due to the nature of electricity and metal. It was hypothesized that the bubble would be present in the current horizontally mounted electrode design, but not present in the vertical electrode configuration of my own previous year design. A 2% scale model of the actual fish barrier in Romeoville, IL was constructed; a 2% scale model test barge was also built, with 6 sets of electrical sensors mounted, with volt/ohm digital readout meters. This testing barge was moved in exact centimeters over 1: existing horizontal canal bottom mounted electrode array, then 2: through my vertical wall mount electrode array design. The voltage data was collected and placed into a data program. The data collected showed that there was, in fact, a bubble of low voltage under the stern of a barge passing over the existing horizontal array. Further, the gathered data shows that no significant voltage drop under the test barge occurs as it passes through the vertical configuration of my design. In conclusion, both sections of my hypothesis were supported. This research demonstrates that there is potential for these dangerous invasives, Asian Carp, to bypass the existing electrical fish barrier, by hitchhiking under a barge in a safer, low voltage zone, and into the Great Lakes.

ROOTS RUN DEEP: A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF PANCIUM VIRGATUM AND CYNONDON DACTYLON IN THE PHYTOREMEDIATION OF HEAVY METALS AND UPTAKE OF PHOSPHATES USING RHIZOFILTRATION
McKalee Suzanne Steen
Grove High School, Grove, OK

The purpose of this project was to test Pancium virgatum (switchgrass) and Cynondon dactylon (bermuda grass) for their effectiveness in the removal of phosphates and heavy metals through rhizofiltration. Solutions were mixed for cadmium, nickel, lead and phosphorus. Thirty milliliters of the solution was placed in each of twelve test tubes for each grass per test group. Grasses were removed from a growth container, all soil removed and rinsed from roots, divided into groups of approximately the same mass and placed into the test tubes of solution. A composite sample from each test group was drawn and tested every two days for the level of heavy metal or phosphates depending on the test group. This test continued for nine days with a final biomass taken. Neither grass had a significant change in biomass. Both grasses were effective in reduction of heavy metals from the solutions. In the first trial, neither grass had a reduction in phosphorus, in fact the phosphate level increased in both test groups. Additional research was done; it was found that when plants were overwatered, they will leach out excess macronutrients from their tissues. A second test for phosphorus was done. The plants were placed in water, after a period of leaching, the test was repeated. Only the switchgrass removed phosphates from the solution. Switchgrass was determined to be a better bio filter for phosphorus. Even though both grasses removed heavy metals, the bermuda grass was not found to withstand an extended period in hydroponic conditions.

NO MO MINE: MGSO4, MO AND PLANT REMEDIATION OF MINE RESIDUAL CONTAMINATION
Hayden Allan Randall
Taos High School, Taos, NM

We need the resources that are taken from the Earth to survive and evolve, but we also have to live with the residue produced by processing ores from these mines. The focus of this project is to determine if magnesium sulfate, molybdenum and alfalfa can remediate damage produced by mine tailings. Hypothetically, magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) will reintroduce nutrients into the soil, balancing off pH of the soil and runoff to promote plant growth. The same will occur with the molybdenum and alfalfa. Infusion of nutrients could help ‘soften’ the soil, and allow for regenerative plant growth.<br><br><br>To conduct this experiment, holes were poked in the bottom of plastic cups. The cups were filled with large and small gravel, and simulated tailings topsoil mixture that was composed to approximate real mine tailings including calcium carbonate, galena and pyrite. MgSO4, ammonium molybdate, molybdenum picolinate, mountain loam soil and alfalfa were added. Water was added in "flooding doses". Cups were placed beneath the soil cups to collect percolation and were tested for pH and sediment accumulation through evaporation. This determined if the top layer percolated through to the ‘aquifer level’. There was a minimal amount of MgSO4 percolation, some molybdenum and a significant amount of mine tailing residue. The MgSO4 in tandem with the two forms of molybdenum produced more plant growth with mountain loam soil. The alfalfa lowered the amount of chemical percolation. This information supports the hypotheses as stated.

THE CITRUS SOLUTION, PHASE III: EFFECTS OF USING CITRUS PEELS WITH SAND AND CHARCOAL FILTERS ON THE REMEDIATION OF HEAVY METAL POLLUTANTS IN SEDIMENT AND WATER SAMPLES, COMPARING VOLUME EFFICIENCY OF FILTERS AND EFFECTS OF CONTAMINATED SEDIMENT ON FILTERED WATER
Wyatt Vann Dunham
Grove High School, Grove, OK

The purpose of this project is to determine the effects of adding citrus peels to a sand and charcoal filter on the remediation of heavy metal pollutants found in sediment and water samples. The water filter consists of a 1:2:2 ration of citrus: charcoal: sand. For sediment reemdiation, componenets were made into powders to make a "liquid filter". The ratio for that filter was 1:2 of citrus: charcoal. Heavy metal levesl were tested for both and the remediation began. It was observed in water remeidation that citrus filters were more effective on toxic compounds such as cadmium and lead, but the control removed more of the metals needed for human health. The citrus did reduce those metals to safe levels. For sedmient remediation, the metal concentrations was about 30% less compared to starting out. For efficiency of filter, the waters were filtered multiple times, and heavy metal levels were tested after first and fourth filtration. After testing, the filters were still filtering efficiently. For re-exposure, filtered water was exposed to the contaminated sediment, and both were retested. The water had a slight increase in heavy metals, while the sediment had a slight decrease in heavy metals. Utilizing citrus peels on the remediation of toxic pollutants in our streams and sediment would be a cheap, clean, ad environmentally friendly approcah for clean water. Use of the liquid filter for sediment would improve soil quality, as well as improved heath for crops, livestock, and human activities that associate with soil.

THE REPLACEMENT OF FISHMEAL WITH FORMULATED SUSTAINABLE MEALS AND ITS EFFECT ON THE GROWTH OF LITOPENAEUS VANNAMEI
Olivia Kaye Joslin
Hilton Head Island High School, Hilton Head Island, SC

Fishmeal is currently the main food source for farm-raised shrimp. The problem with this practice is that fishmeal is rising in cost, is unsustainable, and has detrimental effects on the environment and the food chain. If overfishing continues, fishmeal may not be an option as a food source for farm-raised shrimp. The purpose of this project was to develop a sustainable, original food source for farm-raised shrimp (Litopeneaus vannemei) that results in weight gains equal to, or greater than, the weight gain of shrimp fed fishmeal. Meal 1 was made up of vegetable protein powder, peanut flour, and Porcini mushroom powder. Meal 2 consisted of wheat isolate 8000, peanut flour, and Porcini mushroom powder. Both meals contained minimal amounts of fish oil (attractant) and both were formulated to have optimum levels of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins.<br><br>168 shrimp were individually weighed and divided equally among 6 tanks. Shrimp in tanks 1-2 were fed Meal 1. Shrimp in tanks 3-4 were fed Meal 2. Shrimp in tanks 5-6 (control) were fed fishmeal. After ten days, all shrimp were harvested and re-weighed individually.<br><br>According to the 2 sample Z Tests for difference of means, it can be concluded that at the 5% significance level, shrimp fed Meal 1 or Meal 2 had essentially equal weight gains when compared with the weight gains of the shrimp fed fishmeal. This experiment shows that Meal 1 and Meal 2 are potential, alternative, sustainable meals for farm raised shrimp because they result in weight gains that are statistically equivalent to that of shrimp fed fishmeal. These meals could potentially fill the fishing industry’s need for a sustainable food source for farm-raised shrimp.<br><br>A small taste-test was also conducted. Results suggested that shrimp fed fishmeal were less favored.

"BLACK GOLD" MANURE TO METHANE
Mikayla Marie Ockels
Sussex Central High School, Georgetown, DE

Because the world is suffering from so much pollution, I wanted to do my science fair project on an environmentally friendly topic-composting. I had been wanting to experiment with generating methane by making composting units, called digesters, that would generate methane through the process of microbes breaking down organic waste. This is what led me to choose the question “If I compost 5 types of animal manure: chicken, cow, goat, horse, and pig, which will produce the most methane?” as my science fair project. To carry out my experiment, I first set up composting units. There were 5 in all, and each was filled with a different type of manure, and 6 inches of dry leaves. Every 3 days, I weighed the bins and recorded the weight for each bin. I also kept a journal of my daily observations, where I could record my qualitative data. I concluded that, over a 30 day period, cow manure produces the most methane, with chicken manure in second, horse manure in third, goat manure in fourth and pig manure in last with the least methane generated over a month. In an average day, cow manure produced .25 oz. of methane, chicken manure produced .23 oz, horse manure produced .21 oz, goat manure produced .11 oz, and pig manure produced .05 oz. of methane daily. I hope that my research will spark an interest in composting. Composting and creating methane is a great way to convert manure from something that can be harm runoff water, or poison wells underground, into something that actually benefits nature, and causes plants not only to develop more immunities, but also to grow faster, larger, and produce more fruits and vegetables.

WHAT'S REALLY IN THE WATER? ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS OF THE OUACHITA RIVER
Noel Cary Philley
Crossett High School, Crossett, AR

The Ouachita River between Felsenthal Reservoir Lock and Dam No. 6, Arkansas, and Sterlington, Louisiana is affected by many land use activities such as oil and gas operations, forest production, agriculture, dredging, and industrial and urban discharges. The main source of industrial pollution is the local paper mill in Crossett, Arkansas. The local paper mill is permitted to release 48.5 Millions of Gallons per Day of wastewater into the Ouachita via Coffee Creek and Mossy Lake. The main source of urban pollution is discharges from the town of Crossett, Arkansas, which also releases wastewater into the Ouachita river via Coffee Creek and Mossy Lake.<br><br>It was hypothesized that heavy metal content and dissolved oxygen concentration would increase as the Ouachita River flows downstream.<br><br>In this study, 36 bottles of sample water from 2 sampling sights along the Ouachita River were analyzed for heavy metal and Dissolved Oxygen concentrations. Of the seven heavy metals studied, there was not a detectible concentration of four metals: Aluminum, Mercury, Nickel, and Lead. Atomic absorption spectrometry was able to detect levels of the other three subject heavy metals: Calcium, Copper, and Iron. Also, at the time of sample collection, a Dissolved Oxygen probe was used to measure the concentration of dissolved oxygen in each of the water samples. Overall, the hypothesis that heavy metal and Dissolved Oxygen concentration would increase as the water in the Ouachita River flowed downstream was supported.

ENDOCRINE DISRUPTER REMEDIATION IN FRESH WATER: EXPLORATION OF MYCOREMEDIATION CAPABILITIES OF FUNGI
Rachel Louise Rossi
Durango High School, Durango, CO

Endocrine disrupters, chemicals which obstruct or imitate hormones, have been identified as a great contributor to water pollution. Research indicates a connection between endocrine disrupters and numerous diseases, including malignant tumors, attention deficit disorder, and sexual development problems. No method exists to remediate endocrine disrupting chemicals from water. This research is a part of an ongoing study to explore mycoremediation capabilities of fungi in relation to endocrine disrupters, as represented by the synthetic estrogen, 17-alpha ethynylestradiol, in fresh water. In mycoremediation fungi decompose pollutants, rendering an environment less contaminated. The EE2 solution was divided into 24 sample containers. A pluerotus ostreatus fungi filter secured in cotton gauze was placed in each of 21 of the containers, leaving 3 as controls. Following exposure of the EE2 solution to the fungi filter for either 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 days, the samples were evaporated leaving behind any unmetabolized EE2. BSTFA + 1% TMCS, a derivatization reagent, was added to the samples, causing the EE2 derivative to become more volatile. Samples were injected into a Gas Chromatographer and peak areas corresponding to the EE2 derivatives were determined. The EE2 level of samples exposed to the filter for three days shows a 58.2% decrease in EE2 concentration. In the period of one week, the water exposed to the fungi filter experienced a 93.9% decrease in EE2 concentration. It can be inferred that the fungi filter has the possibility of being a successful and sustainable solution to endocrine disrupter contamination.

The aim of this project is to solve a daily urban uneasiness: the creation of long queues at the traffic lights of a crossroad. In order to reach this purpose, it is necessary to improve the commutation of the lights according to the actual affluence of vehicles at every cycle.<br><br>A video camera installed in a vantage point over the crossroad feeds images to a piece of software which estimates the affluence at each of the roads converging to the intersection, based on the area occupied by the vehicles waiting at the red light. This is achieved through edge detection, patch filtering and convex hull construction. The real time data dynamically tunes the duration of each green light so as to reduce the number of vehicles waiting at the red light.<br><br>There is an option to graph the daily trend of traffic in a form which is useful to highlight the hours of maximum traffic flow and effectively test the reliability of the installed system.<br><br>This provides an inexpensive and non-invasive improvement to urban mobility, without the hurdles of the traditional underground installation of traffic detection coils. <br><br>The positive effects deriving from a better timing are not only no more traffic jams and a consequent decrease of urban pollution and gas consumption, but also less stress and anxiety for drivers who have to cope with daily urban traffic.

In this project, a compact low-cost Stirling engine has been constructed with recycle materials and locally available parts. Biogas, mainly consisting of CH4 with high CO2 and moisture content produced from fermentation of agricultural wastes, has been utilized as the fuel source of the engine. Stirling engine is an external combustion<br><br>engine , the operation of which is based on the compression of the cooled and the expansion of the heated gas. Since the heat source is external, energy loss to the environment is profound. By incorporating newly designed concave cavity heat receptor into the engine, the<br><br>measured efficiency of our engine has been increased comparing to the one with the conventional type heat receptor. The resulting engine was preliminary tested and utilized in electricity generator. With low assembling cost, low-maintainance requirement, this engine could<br><br>prove to be very useful and environmental friendly for utilization in rural community.

THE EFFECT OF SINGLE-WALLED CARBON NANOTUBES ON REGENERATION AND ACTIVITY OF DUGESIA DOROTOCEPHALA, GROWTH OF CHLORELLA VULGARIS, AND EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT OF LYTECHINUS VARIEGATUS
Arthur Wang, Randy Tung, Archie Kong, Randy Tung
Manhasset High School, Manhasset, NY

The effects of carbon nanotubes in the environment are widely unknown. Single walled carbon nanotubes are able to penetrate through the membrane of cells. To explore the potential hazards of carbon nanotubes, the effects of SWNT on the regeneration and movement of planarian, the growth of Chlorella vulgaris, and embryonic development of sea urchins were studied. Planarian regeneration was examined using planarian cut and exposed to .4 mg/L and .8 mg/L concentrations of SWNT in water. Time to regenerate was evaluated as well as the time it took for it to travel .5cm. SWNTs were dispersed in the water using a sonicator. Chlorella vulgaris was exposed to the same concentrations of SWNTs as planarian and a colorimeter was used to measure the percent absorption of 4 wavelengths of light. Lytechinus variegatus gametes were extracted and combined to create embryos. Embryos were exposed to the same concentrations as the Chlorella and the planarian. Embryonic development was observed using a microscope. The alternate hypothesis is that SWNT will reduce the regeneration rate and movement of planarian, inhibit the growth of Chlorella vulgaris and disturb the embryonic development of Lytechinus variegatus. A one-way ANOVA with a Scheffe Post Hoc test was conducted for the planarian and the Chlorella. There was a significant difference only between the control and variable groups for the planarian, supporting the alternate hypothesis. Chlorella showed no significant differences in absorbance between control and exposed groups, supporting the null hypothesis. Although sea urchin embryos were not significantly affected, they show signs of uptake through the cell membrane.

THE ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATIONAL USES OF ENDOTHERMIC REACTIONS
Bisher Ghaleb Assamak, Amer Sawalha
Modern Montessori School, Amman, JORDAN

Nowadays technology is built on four terminological pillars, they tend to qualify an instrument, item, or just like in our case, a project into something that can be marketed, and seriously used. These four terms are sustainable, portable, recyclable, and reusable, if the project meets these four terms it would be ready to go, since polluting became a widely discussed topic. Therefore, such green systems provide efficiency with a sustainable non-polluting manner. These are seen as the common denominators of modern day technology. What our project is? It is simple for the eye, complex for the brain system that tends to turn any excess-heat-based problems to manageable solutions without any side effects on the environment, since all used chemicals and material can be recycled and reused. Based on endothermic reactions we sought to develop different applications in which these reactions would have high functionality without losing efficiency, serving multi-purposes. <br><br>Our research embarked with testing a selection of 50 chemicals by dissolving them in water thus witnessing the temperature change associated with each. According to the results, we managed to structure one primary model and three enhanced prototypes. Most developed systems reusability focuses on the concept of evaporation in which efficiency would remain unaffected. The evaporation will occur inside a Solar Dish/Panel with solar power as the lone provider of thermal energy stressing the non-polluting aspect of our project. The systems’ shapes vary from a straw-tree design, multi-cylindrical system to an ordinary plastic bag with balloons inside.<br><br>Joining all what has been mentioned, this will only lead to one simple title, our project, “The Environmental Innovational Uses of Endothermic Reactions".

Currently, one of the most discussed subjects is the planet lack of pure water. At the end of 2011, the Vale dos Sinos region in Brazil suffered from water scarcity, going through a critical period of rationing. Scientists estimate that about 80% of the world population suffers from serious water threats and some countries constantly suffer from lack of water. Since water is one of the most valuable nature assets, essential to all living beings, we noticed the increasing need for an alternative process that would provide a better use of seawater with an economically viable method. Therefore our goal was to use the Pseudomonas Stutzeri microorganism to reduce the amount of chlorides present in seawater, promoting a reduction in salinity. The P. Stutzeri bacteria is easily obtained and inexpensive, as it can be isolated from a commercial product available in supermarkets. The microorganism cultivation in seawater is simple, since this bacterial species requires only few nutrients, needing for its development only a single molecule as a source of organic carbon and nitrogen. The process starts with the distillation of seawater to reduce chloride content. So casein peptone and P. Sutzeri was added to this water. Afterwards, this solution was incubated at 35ºC for 7 days. The bacteria was eliminated by sterilization filtration. We determined the sample chloride content reduction by using the Argentometric volumetric precipitation method. After confirming the efficiency of the microorganism, we carried out water quality tests, such as chlorides, pH, conductivity and total solids. Then the seawater chloride content was reduced in 99,02%. This method is simple and can be used all over the world.

Silver nanoparticles have seen usage in the form of catalysts and micro-electronics. Among many applications, silver nanoparticles are extremely useful in the field of medicine as anti-microbial agents. The conventional chemical method for synthesizing such nanoparticles involves the use of toxic chemicals which are expensive and are potential threats to the environment and public health. This study aimed to synthesize silver nanoparticles using green methods via the use of a common weed found in the tropics called Lalang. The silver nanoparticles synthesized from the Lalang extract were characterized by UV-VIS spectrophotometry and their sizes determined through Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The anti-bacterial properties against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli as well as the anti-fungal properties against Aspergillus niger of the silver nanoparticles synthesized were also studied. The results from this study show that the common weed Lalang which is unexploited in Singapore can be put to good use by using it as a starting material for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles.

Unidad Academica Preparatoria Vladimir Ilich Lenin, Eldorado, MEXICO

Compost is a compound of the transformation of organic matter which provides great advantages in plant development, because improvement the soil structure, increased water retention capacity, provides mineral elements such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, increases cationic exchange capacity and to aid the solubilization of some soil minerals. The literature indicates that the compost have attributes greater than organic substrates from which they are derived (paper, manure, straw, etc.). This project seeks to compare a byproduct of sugar production which is cachaza and vermicompost derived from the same, in its characteristics, physical, chemical and microbiological as well as in their effects on crop development. The purpose of this project is to mount an experimental design in field to compare the behavior of crops in each substrate.

Staphylococcus aureus is a common and smart bacterium that can build immunity to antibiotics and infect us in numerous ways or cause death. It is imperative that humans find alternate and sustainable solutions to deal with this bacterium. Sustainable practices aim to solve problems taking into consideration three major pillars: the environment, the economy, and society. This research tries to present a sustainable and natural way of preventing humans from getting infected with the Staphylococcus aureus by treating it from the source.<br><br>The Playa Azul red mangrove in the northern area of Puerto Rico was selected and divided into ten experimental sites where temperature, CO2 and O2 levels were measured and water samples were analyzed for pH and conductivity. Four propagules were taken from each site and used to prepare an extract with 95% methanol. Staphylococcus aureus bacteria were inoculated in 12 Petri Dishes with solid agar using the three streak method. The plates were divided into four groups: control (no treatment received), plates treated with 100micro-grams of the extract, plates treated with 75micro-grams of the extract, and a group treated with 50micro-grams of the extract. The plates were observed and the colonies counted for two weeks. The same procedure was done three times. <br><br>It was concluded that red mangrove propagules act as bioremediators of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria found in soil and water bodies. The 100micro-grams concentration proved to be the most effective during the treatment process; its’ colonies disappeared after a week of treatment.<br><br>

To date, in Colombia there is no known record of research and studies that report the use of the grease resulting from the leather industry in agriculture. In Copacabana - Colombia, tanneries are an important source of employment, but also a source of environmental problems. The research group at the school located in Copacabana, produced compost from this grease with very high quality, according to the physicochemical and biological characterization. This compost acts as a soil enhancer for growing plants such as grasses, flowers, green onions (Allium fistulosum) and coriander (Coriandrum sativum). With the conversion of grease into compost, the effects of residual contaminants were reduced, avoiding its deposit in landfills, soils and streams and its putrescent odors during decomposition. <br><br>The application of lipolytic microorganisms and hydrolytic enzymes was very positive to neutralize odors, and the use of Californian red earthworms (Eisenia foetida), finalizing the thermophilic phase of composting (30 days after the start). It was also very important the control of variables such as temperature, moisture, pH, aeration-oxygenation and periodical mixing. With these conditions we reached a rapid decomposition (before 60 days) of grease and other organic material, good organoleptic characteristics, optimal grain size and chemical properties that certify the quality of the resulted compost and its potential as a enhancer and conditioner of arable, degraded and eroded soil.

IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF A HAND PUMP BOTTLE
Chesney De Nagel, Ariana Oorlog
Avon High School, Avon, SD

Every year millions of ounces of liquid from hand pump bottles are discarded by frustrated consumers. This results in hundreds of thousands of 12 ounce bottles being prematurely thrown away in the U.S. alone. Could a bottle be designed that produces less wasted liquid, discards less plastic, and is both environmentally and consumer friendly?<br><br>We attempted to answer this question by gathering different pump bottles, such as hand sanitizers, and pumped until no more liquid came out. Then we measured the volume of liquid left in the bottle. Our calculations show that some products can leave a considerable amount of liquid behind. We built and tested a series of different designs and found the best bottles had a series of slants around the entire bottom of the bottle. The viscosity of the substances in the bottles was also measured. Using this information, we designed a new bottle that leaves significantly less liquid behind. We continue to scrutinize our designs to see if this amount of waste could be further reduced. Finally, we found that certain highly viscous substances probably should not be used in hand pump bottles. <br><br>The benefit of redesigning simple hand pump bottles is to both reduce the amount of liquid wasted and the number of bottles discarded. Reducing the amount of environmental waste of these bottles is a win for the consumer and a win for the environment.

DETERMINATION OF THE ALLELOPATHIC POTENTIAL OF SPATHADEA CAMPANULATA AND EUCALYPTUS ROBUSTA AS PHYTOREMEDIATIVE AGENTS IN THE INVASIVE SPECIES LEMNA AEQUINOCTIALIS IN LAKES
Angelo Louis Vazquez, Jose Colon-Rodriguez
Benjamin Harrison Vocational High School, Cayey, PUERTO RICO

The objective of this research was to test the allelopathic potential of "Spathadea campanulata" (African tulip) and “Eucalyptus robusta" (Eucalyptus) extracts as phytoremediative agents in contaminated lakes with the invasive aquatic species "Lemna aequinoctialis"(duckweed). Both plants are allelopathic species which contain substances that inhibit, in different degrees, the growth and germination of many plants. Being allelopathic plants, could also be considered to check their phytoremediative potential. Phytoremediation is a natural alternative where the plants properties are used to restore or stabilize soils or polluted water. The hypothesis was that the extracts of the allelopathic species African tulip and Eucalyptus, will be effective as phytoremediative agents to eradicate duckweed, an invasive species in lakes. Thirty-six (400mL) bioassays were each prepared with 200 mL of distilled water and 10g of duckweed. Eucalyptus leaves extracts were prepared by the maceration and filtration process. The liquid substance in the cocoon of the African tulip was directly obtained from it. Different amounts of each extract were used to test its effectiveness. Three test stations were allocated: Station 1) five dosages of African tulip extract; Station 2) five dosages of Eucalyptus extract; Station 3) five solution dosages of African tulip and Eucalyptus extracts (1:1). A weekly qualitative analysis and quantitative tests of dissolved oxygen were made as an external indicator of the water’s quality in the samples. The data collected indicated that the African tulip extract was effective as phytoremeditive agent in the invasive aquatic plant duckweed and also showed acceptable parameters in water quality.

FILAMENTOUS FUNGI CULTIVATION ON “MOONSHINE” DISTILLATE RESIDUES AND THIN STILLAGE TO PRODUCE REUSABLE WATER AND A HIGH-VALUE FISH FOOD CO-PRODUCT
John Edward Hale, Sydney Burchell
Morristown Hamblen High School East, Morristown, TN

A commercial distillery in a nearby town was recently licensed. Because the municipality will not allow any discharges into its waste system, there is an on-site 10,000 gallon waste containment tank. The distillery offers its “stillage” to farmers as a livestock feed, but due to Increased production, the waste exceeds local consumption.<br><br> A method of processing stillage from corn fermentation was investigated for the second phase of this multiyear project. This included dry-grind ethanol production from corn, via fermentation with filamentous fungi. This produced high-value fungal biomass that was able to be recovered by centrifugation. It was easily dewatered and used as catfish feed. The methodology used an anaerobic micro-fermenter to enhance the morphology of the fungi for easy harvesting and separation of water for recycling and reuse. The fungal processing removed organic substances from the water that would otherwise be inhibitory to reuse of the water, i.e. suspended and dissolved organic matter, including glycerol, lactic acid, and acidic acids. The process separated glycerol from the stillage by enmeshing the glycerol in the fungal. This approach has the potential to generate revenue from low value thin stillage by creating an economically viable fish food co-product, while substantially reducing stillage processing costs, mainly by averting the need for storage of the thin stillage.

Institucion Educativa Panfilo Cantillo Mendoza, Campos de la Cruz, COLOMBIA

This research Project was carried in the municipality of “Campo de la Cruz”, in the “Departamento del Atlantico”, Colombia. Its main aim was to develop a culture of environmental awareness, through the design and construction of bottle classrooms, by collecting PET containers. This project started from the community’s concerns about the need for classrooms in one of the local schools of the municipality; as well as the lack of a recycling program organized by the town Hall, which will contribute to carry out this project. Furthermore, there is water pollution due to accumulation of waste, since the floods ocurred. The methodology applied was descriptive and exploratory, with a design of a medium-sized scale of the bottle rooms. The results showed that inhabitants at “Campo de la Cruz” consume everyday a great amount of drinks from “Big Cola” company (383 PET containers); followed by “Postobon” company (187 PET containers). Thus, it is concluded that only the amount of “Big Cola” PET containers gathered per year, in the streets, yards and surrounding areas of the municipality would be 139.795, being this a concern about massive pollution extended for some years. Therefore, it is proposed the continuity of this research project in the other two stages, in order to carry it out, and to implement it also in the restoration of the community’s homes, which were damaged due to the flood of 2010-2011.

Institucion Educativa Colegio Loyola para la Ciencia y la Innovacion, Medellin, COLOMBIA

Because of the Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of the most produced materials in the world (84.000Tons/year in Colombia ) and a contaminant material due its chemical composition.<br><br>In addition, after water, concrete is the most widely used material in the world. Hence, an analysis of the combination of concrete and PET was established as a potential initiative to do research on<br><br>sustainability. This research work was focused on mechanical and environmental evaluation of concrete when natural coarse aggregates are partially and fully replaced by PET. The research<br><br>methodology, which defined 5 concrete mixes to study (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of PET content), was implemented and concrete mixes were fabricated. While fresh concrete, slump was<br><br>determined and concrete cylindrical specimens were made. After 28 days curing, laboratory tests were conducted in order to identify the compressive strength (f´c) and density. Tests were carried<br><br>out according to American Society for Testing and Materials-ASTM. Slump and f´c were determined based on ASTM-C143 and ASTM-C39 , respectively. Moreover, environmental<br><br>impacts were also analyzed. The best performance was identified for 25%PET concrete mix, which reached f´c=15MPa while control mix attained 21MPa. Therefore, this concrete could<br><br>reduce the PET amount to dispose in landfills, increase the life cycle of PET and quarries (Natural resources) and reduce concrete density for non-structural applications.

URBAN HEAT ISLAND IN IZMIR
Melis Cirpici, Tanyel Rauner

Urban heat islands that indicate the urban climate changing due to rapid urbanization are actually a local form of global climate change. It affects the health and the life quality, energy consumption and such in a negative way. <br><br> Our primary endeavor in our study was to detect the problem and its dimensions on a local scale. To this end, we detected the formations of urban heat islands in İzmir using the temperature measurements we conducted in 16 different points during the day on 28, 29, 30 November and 01, 02 December. Based on the data we obtained, we made isothermal maps. We observed that there are considerable temperature differences between Üçkuyular-Güzelyalı-Balçova district where population is dense and Sahilevleri which is less densely populated. The long term temperature data from Güzelyalı Meteorology Station proves the fact that urban climate is different from rural climate. <br><br> Rapidly increasing population and emerging unplanned urbanization, deteriorating open – green areas, increasing air pollution, increasing low albedo surfaces that absorb more heat, wind losing effect, increase in water-repellent surfaces, urban canyons created by closely-built tall apartment buildings are among the major reasons of the temperature differences between urban and rural areas or different areas of settlement within an urban area. Considering the rise of urbanization and changing land cover all around the world, this local problem affects the climate change on a global scale. In this case, the answer to the question “how should sustainable urbanization be” should be the reduction or annihilation of urban heat islands.

Fish kill is an environmental problem known as the death of many fish species for many reasons such as dissolved oxygen, chemical wastes, thermal pollution and Turbines. Fish are important to economy and environment.<br><br>So, how can we do to alert fish or make them leave the hazardous place, avoid this ecological problem, save these animals, protect the environment?<br><br>We realized a project which consists in a system that alerts fish to the danger and saves their lives .This system is composed of two parts : First, we used infrasound generator to scare fish because natural disasters like earthquakes produce infrasound and many animals like fish can detect these disasters we added echolocalisation system because fish have not the same sensitivity of infrasound we have to see if fish still exist in the dangerous area or not in order to change the frequency of infrasound generator this will improve the efficiency of our project . Second, we made a study to know the clean or less polluted area by using pH meter, dissolved oxygen probe and chemical reactions to detect waste such as phosphates, nitrates,sulphates ,mercury and other chemical wastes then we used electricity with low voltage between 9 and 12 volts to attract fish to a far away area to save them from hazard. Fish use electricity to navigate and to find their prey .Third part, it is related to revision and testing the efficiency of project working we used an underwater camera to see if fish are still exist in the dangerous area or not.<br><br>After investigations, testing the project and asking professors and teachers we found that this project work 96% and it is useful. Now, we can save fish from danger.<br><br>Finally, our goals are: protect the environment by preserving fish species from hazards to reduce the risk of the phenomenon

COST EFFICIENT DEEP WELL PUMP
Mario Santiago Vilanova, Amanda Zuniga
Weslaco East High School, Weslaco, TX

The purpose of continuing this project was so improvements could be made to what was already done and finish what wasn't completed. The pump is now powered by a solar panel with a solar charge regulator. A twelve volt battery is now being used only when there is not enough sunlight as the main power supply. This change was made so the pump could be running continuously without having to stop to recharge the battery. The seventeen volts being produced by the solar panel is now being regulated into twelve volts to the circuit and the remaining five to the battery to charge. The voltage must be regulated to avoid buring out the motor of the air compressor and overcharging the battery. The additon of these items did not affect the cost efficiency of this pump; it is about $120 below the cheapest pump. Trials were made with the solar power as the main source and didn't decrese the amount of water being pumped out of the well.
