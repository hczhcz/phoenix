A COMPARISON OF BACTERIAL COLONIZATION ON TITANIUM AND STAINLESS STEEL
Ashley Elizabeth Smith
duPont Manual Magnet High School, Louisville, Kentucky, US

The purpose of this experiment was to determine how bacteria colonize differently on titanium and stainless steel, and on which surface more colonies form. It was hypothesized that more bacterial colonies would form on the stainless steel.<br><br> To test this, titanium and stainless steel tablets were placed in 25 mL of soy broth and were introduced to 1 mL of four different bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Escherichia coli. After incubation, the tablets were placed in 15 mL of saline and were sonicated. A 200 µL sample was drawn from each saline solution and was spread onto a plate of soy agar. The plates were incubated for 18 hours, and the colonies that had formed on each were counted.<br><br> The results of this experiment seemed to support the hypothesis. In every sample but one (E. faecalis), the colony count was higher on the stainless steel than on the titanium. The counts for the titanium samples range from 519 to 2519, with a mean count of 1508.75 colonies. The counts for the stainless steel samples range from 900 to 5890, with a mean count of 3052.5 colonies, twice the count from the titanium samples. However, a statistical analysis found the difference between counts to be insignificant. <br><br> Contamination and a lack of more trials seemed to play a role in the results of this experiment; further research with more careful precautions and more trial runs could return more reliable results, which may support the trend that was hypothesized.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF SELENIUM SULFIDE ON DISINFECTION AND INHIBITION OF CORYNEBACTERIUM EQUI AND ITS APPLICATION TO THE DURATION OF CONTACT LENS USAGE
Christina Marie Damman
Wamego High School, Wamego, KS, Pottawatomie

This project is the result of experimentation on the effects of selenium sulfide on the growth of Corynebacterium equi and its application to contact lens usage. The initial idea was to determine if selenium sulfide would prevent bacteria and microorganisms living within the eye from surviving.<br><br>This project was difficult to design, but eventually two methods were produced. Selenium sulfide was put on filter paper disks on agar plates to compare zones on inhibition of Corynebacterium equ. Selenium sulfide dilutions were also created and combined with cultures of Corynebacterium equi to see which culture was more turbid and had the most cells per millimeter, or organisms surviving within it.<br><br>Although current research and other findings regarding this same subject suggest that selenium compounds have bacteria-fighting properties, thus allowing consumers to wear these contact lenses longer, the findings of these particular tests contradicted those beliefs. In both tests, the hypothesis that selenium sulfide would discourage the survival of bacteria, was refuted. <br><br> While this could be due to errors and inconsistencies, the contributions of this project are significant. This issue may soon affect consumers, if they’re unaware that these contacts may prove to be detrimental to their vision. <br><br>

AMPICILLIN RESISTANCE IN GENETICALLY TRANSFORMED E.COLI
Tristan Nino Sarmiento Sotto
Waipahu High School, Waipahu, Hawaii, United States of America 

The investigation is to see at which concentrations of antibiotic Ampicillin will kill the antibiotic resistant E.coli.<br><br>A part of DNA recombination is transformation, which involves genetic information into a cell by direct uptake of DNA. The bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli) has been used extensively in recombinant DNA research as an ideal organism for molecular geneticists to manipulate. Antibiotics are chemicals that kill bacteria or inhibit their growth. My hypothesis is that the highest concentration of antibiotic solution will show a greater zone of inhibition in the untransformed E.coli than the antibiotic resistant E.coli. If the highest concentration of 0.5% Ampicillin shows the greatest zone, then it’s the best concentration that kills the antibiotic resistant E.coli.<br><br>To test the hypothesis, discs with different concentrations of antibiotics will be place in the transformed and untransformed E.coli cultures. The zone of inhibition is then measured in millimeters.The highest concentrations of 0.5% Ampicillin showed the greatest zone of inhibition with an average diameter of 28.4375 mm within the antibiotic resistant culture. The higher the concentration placed in the cultures, the bigger the zone becomes. <br><br>Bacteria in the human body can transform to be antibiotic resistant if it is exposed to the antibiotic environment. My investigation will give an idea of how much antibiotic a person should consume in order to kill the antibiotic resistant bacteria. For future research, I plan to use higher concentration of antibiotics for antibiotic resistant culture to see if there is an optimum level of antibiotic concentration.<br><br>

FACTORS AFFECTING THE GERMINATION OF BACILLUS CEREUS SPORES
Kay Webber Ribbel
Lake Crystal Wellcome Memorial Secondary School, Lake Crystal, MN, U.S.A. 

With the ever increasing threat of biological warfare, research into treatments and factors affecting germination of biological agents is warranted. Should portions of the population be unknowingly infected with a biological agent such as Bacillus anthracis, better known as anthrax, symptoms such as high fever, vomiting, fluid in lungs, and severe breathing problems, may lead people to seek home remedies and over the counter medicines. Bacillus cereus, a bacteria sometimes implicated in food poisoning, is a close relative of Bacillus anthracis. The purpose of this project is to determine if a germinant (representing: amino acids, sugars, and nucleotides, in the human body), EDTA (a calcium magnesium chelator) or nasal spray will affect B.cereus germination. It is hypothesized germinant and nasal spray will increase the germination of B. cereus while EDTA will decrease the germination of spores. The hypotheses were tested by running a series of B. cereus spores through a spectrophotometer while exposing them to each test agent. Data was collected on the percent spore germination that occurred during each trial. The data was analyzed using Multivariate ANOVAs. No significant time effect on spore germination was apparent. However, trials with germinant present did have significant increase in spore germination however, no significant change in germination occurred when EDTA or nasal spray was present. The results of this study suggest further research into the affects of these substances on B. anthracis and other biological warfare agents is necessary.

IS MELALEUCA A EFFECTIVE ANTIBACTERIAL AGENT ON APPLES?
Eric William Benson
GFW High School Winthrop MN U.S.A.

<br><br> The purpose of my project was to experiment with different concentrates of Melaleuca Oil to find out which amount of Melaleuca Oil kills off the most bacteria on apples. I took twenty apples and wash five in 4.5 drops per liter of water of Melaleuca, five in 9 drops of Melaleuca, five in 18 drops of Melaleuca, and five in 27 drops of Melaleuca. All were washed in a bowl with one liter of water. Melaleuca is a natural substance I compared it with a commercial cleaner that's made from natural substances, so I washed five apples with a commercial cleaner. For my control I washed five apples without any Melaleuca added to it. When the washings were done I cut a small square out of each apple and set them on the counter to air dry. When they were dry I put each square on a Petri Dish skin side down. I had six Petri Dishes, four for the different amounts of Melaleuca, one for the control and one for the commercial cleaner. I grew the cultures for two days. After two days of careful counting my results show that the bowl with the most amount of Melaleuca Oil in it had the least amount of bacteria. The control had the most bacteria on the Petri Dish because I didn't add any Melaleuca to it. The bowl with the least amount of Melaleuca had the most bacteria<br><br>

A STUDY OF THE VIABILITY OF NON-PATHOGENIC ESCHERICHIA COLI AND STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS ON PAPER CURRENCY
Louis Paul Derousie, Orange Park High School
Orange Park, Florida, U.S.A.

The project is to test the theory that non-pathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) maintain viability when inoculated on paper currency. Forty one dollar bills were inoculated with E. coli (ATCC 25922) and forty one dollar bills were inoculated with S. aureus (ATCC 25923). The controls were dollar bills touch-prepped on a blood agar plate (BAP) before inoculation with the organisms. The inoculated bills were touch-prepped on BAP at the following intervals: 1 hour, 4 hours, 8 hours, and 24 hours. Forty one dollar bills inoculated with E. coli yielded the following results: one hour- forty (100%) bills yielded 4+ growth; four hours- six (15%) bills yielded 4+ growth, sixteen (42%) bills yielded 3+ growth, twelve (28%) bills yielded 2+ growth, two (5%) bills yielded 1+ growth, four (10%) bills yielded few/rare growth; eight hours- eight (22%) bills yielded few/rare growth and 32 (78%) bills had no growth; and no isolates grew at twenty-four hours. Forty one dollar bills inoculated with S. aureus yielded the following results: forty (100%) bills yielded 4+ growth at 1 hour, 4 hours, 8 hours, and 24 hours. The eighty control plates yielded no growth of S. aureus and E. coli. This supports the hypothesis that a bacterial isolate can maintain viability when inoculated on paper currency.

EFFECTS OF IRON & ZINC ON CARBON TETRACHLORIDE DEGRADATION BY METHANOSARCINA THERMOPHILA CELL EXUDATES: OPTIMIZING CONDITIONS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP
A. Noel Suri
Harding High School, St Paul, MN, USA

Carbon tetrachloride (CT) used, until the 1960s, for dry cleaning, fire extinguishing, and metal degreasing purposes, was commonly disposed of in unlined pits and landfills. It was later found to migrate through the subsurface, contaminate groundwater systems, and persist for decades after initial disposal. Today, there are approximately 202 hazardous waste sites in the U.S. containing 20 million tons of this dangerous compound. Biotic transformation of CT has been demonstrated with cell exudates (biomolecules) of Methanosarcina thermophila, a methanogenic microorganism. These biomolecules have been found to contain iron and zinc. In an effort to optimize and determine the most efficient and cost-effective method of CT degradation, the current research hypothesizes that supplementing increased concentrations of iron and zinc in the growth medium of this methanogen will result in increased production of the biomolecules, thereby resulting in higher rates of CT degradation. Pure cultures of the microorganisms were grown in the presence of 4 variables (high & low concentrations of both iron and zinc), and the growth medium was filtered to obtain the biomolecules once the organisms were at stationary phase. CT was then added to this filtrate, and the degradation of CT was measured using gas chromatography. Comparison (in triplicates) of the concentrations of CT in the liquid cultures, with and without the metals over 7 time periods, indicated that the presence of high iron, low iron, high zinc, and low zinc increased the rate of degradation of CT by 49.4%, 14.1%, 231.0% and 52.2% respectively. ANOVA and t-tests indicated that the data was significant for P< 0.01. The hypothesis was, therefore, supported. It is estimated that this process will reduce the cleanup costs of CT by almost $3 million.<br><br>

CHARACTERIZATION OF THE SECRETED ASPARTIC PROTEINASES OF CANDIDA ALBICANS USING A NOVEL COMBINATORIAL APPROACH
Jamie Elyce Rubin
Canterbury School, Fort Myers, FL, USA

Candida is a dimorphic fungus that is responsible for a wide variety of mycotic infections. The secreted aspartic proteinases (Saps) are among the organism’s putative virulence factors, and inhibition of these enzymes has been shown to have a curative effect upon candidiasis. In this study chromogenic combinatorial libraries of octapeptides were used to investigate the extended substrate interactions of Sap1 and Sap2 of Candida albicans, the most common cause of candidiasis in humans. This novel technique revealed a key difference between the preference of these enzymes and the preferences of human aspartic proteinases, a characteristic that could be exploited to design effective inhibitors of Sap activity. Additionally, existing aspartic proteinase inhibitors were tested against these enzymes to demonstrate the feasibility of targeted inhibition of Sap activity. These data were used to construct peptidomimetic inhibitors that demonstrated marked inhibition of Sap activity and no interaction with human enzymes.

THE EFFECT OF X-RADIATION (X-RAYS) ON BACILLUS SUBTILIS
Anthony Michael Barnett
McDonaugh High School, LaPlata, Maryland USA

Research was performed to determine the effect of X-Radiation (X-Ray) exposure on observable and testable characteristics of Bacillus subtilis. With a sufficient exposure, X-Rays are known to have a lethal affect on bacteria, and this has a potential application as a method to control pathogenic organisms (such as Bacillus anthracis). This research was conducted to better understand how X-Rays affect Bacillus subtilis, which was selected due to its close relationship to the anthrax bacillus. This research observed cellular functions at varying levels of low-dose, 70 kilovolts pressure (kVP), X-Rays using a dental X-Ray machine. Easily observable (testable) characteristics were observed, before and after X-Ray exposure, including sugar metabolism (dextrose and mannitol), cellular motility, catalase production, spore production, and colony morphology after X-Ray exposures ranging from 120 seconds up to 360 seconds. This experiment showed that exposure to a non-lethal X-Ray dose has a significant affect on individual bacterial cell motility by direct observation (wet mount) immediately after X-Ray exposure. It is also noted that X-Rays affect motility in subsequent generations based on testing in motility media. In addition, this experiment noted that spores were produced by both the control (no X-Ray exposure) and by all of the cultures exposed to the various doses of X-Rays. However, the spore count data suggests that the higher X-Ray doses appear to stimulate or accelerate spore production. Further research is needed to determine the mechanism of the X-Ray effect on motility and to verify and explore the effect X-Rays on the spore generation process.

BACTERIAL BREAKDOWN
Hattie Bluestone Smith, Charlottesville High School
Charlottesville, Virginia (United States)

I sought to determine the effectiveness of different microorganisms (psychrophiles, mesophiles, and thermophiles) in decomposing a carbon-based compost heap. I researched the conditions of a compost heap, the way the decomposition process works, and the three main categories of bacteria that help this process. I found that in a compost heap the type of bacteria that is decomposing the organic matter is determined by the temperature of the heap. Thermophiles are activated to decompose at 95 to 160 degrees F, Mesophiles are activated to decompose at 68 to 90 degrees F, and Psychrophiles are activated to decompose at 55 to 62 degrees F. Therefore, I could isolate the work of a single type of bacteria by controlling the temperature of its compost heap. I put a mixture of paper, wood shavings, and microbes into three compost bins. To control the temperatures of the bins, I used different amounts of insulation. Then, to accommodate the climactic demands of a compost heap, I continuously pumped in water vapor. For three weeks I took temperature readings and made observations. After three weeks, I found that the bin with Psychrophiles at work looked similar to the original mixture, the bin with Thermophiles at work had many parts of rich brown compost, and the bin with Mesophiles at work had some of each. I concluded that Thermophiles are the most effective at composting a carbon-based compost heap, while Psychrophiles are the least effective.

DEVELOPMENT OF AN IMPROVED ENTEROVIRUS DETECTION PROTOCOL FOR TOMATOES: A SECOND YEAR STUDY
Hannah Mary Kaufman
Newberry High School, Newberry, Florida, United States of America

The purpose of this project was to test the effectiveness of Polyethyleneimine (PEI) on enumeration and recovery of viruses from produce and the effectiveness of chlorine dioxide on decontamination of seeded tomatoes.<br><br>MA104 (ATCC #CRL-2378) monolayer cells were tested. Pre-filtered viruses were procured from sewage wastewater. Rotavirus was also used. Ten tomato stem scars were inoculated with 0.1 mL of viral solution. After drying for one hour, select tomatoes were subjected to 10 ppm chlorine dioxide treatment. An activated chlorine dioxide pouch and three tomatoes were covered with a container and incubated for 15, 30, 60, or 120 minutes. For the aqueous treatments the pouch was activated and immersed in distilled water for one hour; tomatoes were submerged into the solution for one minute, then briefly into a solution of 0.001% sodium thiosulfate in distilled water. The stem scars were placed in 50 mL tubes with 20 mL Phosphate Buffered Saline and shaken for 15 minutes. Pre-Treatment with PEI and a Standard Method of cell culturing was then tested. Three mL of .004% PEI was added to flasks for Pre-Treatment. After ten minutes, three mL of the produce/viral solution was placed into all flasks. One hour later 10 mL of 2% medium was added. They were incubated at 370 Celsius and checked every 72 hours for cytopathic effect development. <br><br>The hypothesis that Polyethyleneimine would enhance the susceptibility of tissue cell culture to enterovirus infection and that chlorine dioxide would effectively decontaminate seeded tomatoes, proved to be correct.<br><br>

XYLELLA FASTIDIOSA GENETIC ANALYSES PROVIDE HOST-RANGE INSIGHTS
Mary Melissa Gardner
Spalding High School, Griffin, Georgia, United States

Preliminary data from the 2002 science fair project showed that AFLP molecular markers could be used to differentiate among host-specific Xylella fastidiosa strains. But, without population genetic analyses of the raw molecular dataset, there was no way to determine gene flow patterns, genetic partitioning or to gain insight into infection patterns that could be vector-specific and environment-specific. To determine if Xylella fastidiosa is geographically biased based on host-specificity, a new research project was created to accomplish the overall goal, which is to master population genetics computer software analyses that can be applied to many types of molecular datasets and which will facilitate continued research on Pierce’s disease. Data read from the ABI 377 automated sequencer were reconstructed using a computer program that turned the dye-specific bands into a gel image that was straightened and sized. Three population genetics programs were then used to analyze these data based on population genetics concepts and assumptions. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that population genetic analyses of host-specific Xylella fastidiosa strains will not demonstrate similarities across geography or host range to include systemic (causing symptoms) and nonsystemic (symptomless) hosts. After evaluating the phylogeny, genetic identity and genetic distance resulting from analyses of the molecular dataset, the original hypothesis was rejected in favor of an alternative hypothesis that population genetic analyses of host-specific Xylella fastidiosa demonstrates similarities across geography as well as host range. The results also provided insight into nonsystematic hosts for vector acquisition of the bacterium.<br><br>

A STUDY OF QUORUM SENSING ACITIVITY IN E. COLI (JM101) AFTER LACZ TRANSFORMATION
Caitlin Hannah Walls
South Pemiscot High School, Steele, Missouri, 

Bacteria utilize a low molecular weight chemical belonging to the N-oxo-acylhomoserine Lactone (HSL) family for communication by quorum sensing. In this project HSL production was observed in E. coli with the aid of a reporter strain modified with a LacZ reporter gene. The reporter strain produces b-galactosidase in response to exogenous HSL generated by the test organism. This production was measured quantitatively by using the lactose analog ONPG (o-nitrophenyl-galactopyranoside) in a spectrophotometric assay. E. coli JM101 lacks both the amp and lacZ genes. A plasmid, pBLU, containing the genes for lacZ and ampicillin was used to transform the E. coli JM101. Transformants were isolated on selective media, which contained LB/Amp/X-gal. The transformed bacteria grew in blue colonies illustrating the uptake of the pBLU plasmid. Transformed bacteria with the reporter gene were used as the test organism. Cultures of transformed bacteria, (-) lacZ bacteria and + lacZ bacteria were grown for 24 hours. Cell free extracts were taken every 4 hours for 4, 8, 12,16,20, and 24-hour samples. Cell free extracts were combined with a fresh culture of transformed bacteria for 30 minutes. B-galactosidase enzyme activity was assayed with ONPG substrate in a spectrophotometer at 420nm for 5 minutes. Optical Density of the culture was measured at 600nm. Specific activity of the enzyme was calculated and compared to a control sample of transformer bacteria for each cell free extract sample collected over the 24-hour period. Results indicate an increase in specific enzyme activity through the 8-hour extracts for each group tested. This corresponds to the maximum growth of the E. coli and maximum cell density reached at 8 hours of growth.

ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE FROM SEWAGE: PHASE IV
Heather Michelle Mispagel
Oconee County High School, Watkinsville, Georgia, United States

Tetracycline resistant genes C and G were detected in the 1st and 2nd stages and in the discharge of an oxidation pond going directly into the environment where they can spread rapidly. These genes are usually found in intestinal bacteria, so it can be inferred that they are from a human source. Antimicrobial residue from the beta-lactam family of antibiotics was found in all of the stages, the discharge, and in the creek above and below the pond, with a greater concentration found below the pond discharge. Tetracycline residue was found in the first stage of the pond. A biofilm was created using a highly antibiotic-resistant Salmonella typhimuirum 3/97 added to pond water. This was an attempt at simulating the biofilm which occurs in nature in such oxidation ponds. The biofilm was processed via a rotating disk bioreactor specifically designed to study biofilms in nature. Cultures revealed that in these optimal conditions, Salmonella typhimurium 3/97 was still present in the in vitro oxidation pond.<br><br>In this study, antibiotic-resistant pathogens and antibiotic residues were documented surviving the oxidation pond treatment. Tetracycline resistant genes were found surviving the pond and discharged into the environment. It was also documented that even in optimal conditions, the competitive inhibition used in biofilms does not effectively treat the sewage.

CAN YOU STOP A KILLER?
Carly Renee Nystrom, Carson High School
1111 N. Saliman Road Carson City, NV, 89701, U.S.A.

There are hundreds of strains of Escherichia Coli (E-coli) living throughout our world. E-coli is found inside our intestines, as well as the intestinal tracts of other animals. E-coli helps our bodies to perform vital functions such as digesting food. In spite of its usefulness, E-coli can be extremely harmful. For example, E-coli 0157:H7 is a deadly strain known worldwide. Symptoms include fever, vomiting, and even death. Considering the fact that we come in contact with this and other strains of E-coli everyday, the purpose of my experiment was to determine which soaps most effectively inhibited the growth of E-coli, as well as determining whether antibacterial soaps worked better than non-antibacterial soaps.<br><br> <br><br>To determine the effectiveness of the soaps, e-coli was grown in petri dishes then, a sterile disk of paper, coated in one of the hand cleaning products, was placed in each of the dishes. To increase the rate of growth of the E-coli, the petri dishes were placed in an incubator. Data was measured through daily observations, journal writings, and photographs. At the end of the experiment the most effective soaps were those that contained antibacterial properties: active ingredients.<br><br> <br><br>After studying the data, it is clearly evident that the antibacterial soaps worked much more effectively to inhibit the growth of the E-coli. It is important to note, however, that the experiment only shows the effects on E-coli that has come in contact with the soaps. It does not show the effectiveness of hand washing with each particular soap.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF RED AND WHITE WINE ON THE GROWTH OF SALMONELLA
Dylan Bennett Schram
Southside High School, Batesville, AR, USA

In the experiment with Salmonella, it was hoped to prove that red and white wine has an inhibitory effect on the pathogenic bacteria.<br><br> One hundred uL of Salmonella was added to 10 mL culture tubes containing 4.5 mL of Standard Lowry's Broth Medium, except for the juice treatment which was 500 uL. Five mL of red wine (Turning Leaf Merlot), white wine (Turing Leaf Chardonnay), grain alcohol (Gen Clear), and grape juice (Welch's Sparkling Cocktail) was added in concentrations of 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% to culture tubes. In the control groups five mL of distilled water was added. Three replicate samples were used in all experimental treatments, except the red wine control which had a single relicate. All culture tubes were maintained at 37oC in a Gyromax 702 Orbital Incubator Shaker. The Salmonella growth was read every 30 minutes for two hours using a Spectronic 20D spectrophotometer.<br><br> Salmonella grown in red and white wine demonstrated reduced growth in all concentrations with the greatest effect occurring in the 20% treatments. White wine seemed to be better at controlling growth of Salmonella. Grain alcohol and grape juice treatments had no inhibitory effect on growth.<br><br> In testing red and white wine on the growth of Salmonella, the white wine showed the greatest effect in controlling growth; therefore, the hypothesis was rejected. Further experimentation is required to discover the inhibitory agent affecting the growth of Salmonella.

DETECTION OF E. COLI IN COASTAL WATERS
BRADLEY JORDAN JONES
Brunswick High School, Brunswick, Georgia, United States

The focus of this project was to identify the presence of fecal coliform bacteria in coastal waters of Georgia. This is important because pinpointing specific locations where fecal coliform levels exceed legal limits could help protect the growing number of people using the coastal waterways. The hypothesis of this experiment stated that the recreational site on the Altamaha River would have the highest count of fecal coliform.<br><br> Both recreational and pristine sites were tested. Lauryl tryptose broth was used in the initial media preparation. Samples were collected and added to a buffer solution. This dilution was then added to each of the previously prepared media tubes. The media was incubated for 24 hours. Another 24-hour incubation was alloted for those not testing positive. The confirmed positives were put through the confirmed EC test. After a 24-hour incubation, the results were recorded. The results showed moderate amounts of fecal coliform present in most locations; however, the pristine site on the Satilla showed that two of the three samples had Most Probable Number (MPN) levels of 9,000 and 16,000 (legal limit is 200).<br><br> The hypothesis was not supported by the results. The pristine Satilla River site had the highest levels of fecal coliform. Research had shown animal waste to be a major cause of fecal coliform contamination in addition to human activity. At this pristine site, a deer carcass was observed, supporting the fact that there was most likely a large animal commuinity, which could have produced the high levels.

TRICLOSAN RESISTANCE IN CLINICAL ISOLATES OF STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS AND MUTATIONS IN THE FABI GENE
Yang Dai
Little Rock Central High School, Little Rock, Arkansas

The purpose of this project was to find whether 12 clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus show different levels of susceptibility to triclosan, a common antibacterial, and whether the variations result from an F204C alteration in the fabI gene. <br><br> 12 clinical isolates were randomly picked, and DNA was extracted from each of the 12 strains. Primers were ordered and used in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to replicate the desired portion of the fabI gene. The PCR products were then inserted into plasmids and shocked into E. coli cells. Plasmid preps were performed to extract the plasmids from successfully cloned cells, and the plasmid inserts were sequenced. An antimicrobial activity assay was performed using serially diluted solutions of triclosan and tryptic soy broth to determine triclosan minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the 12 strains. <br><br> The sequencing showed no F204C alteration in any of the 12 S. aureus strains, though there was a N170D alteration in strain 609. The alteration in strain 609 did not appear to have any affect on its resistance to triclosan. There was a range of minimum inhibitory concentrations in the 12 strains, but since there were no F204C alterations, the variations were mostly likely due to overexpressions of wild-type FabI.<br><br>

THE IDENTIFICATION OF ANTIMICROBIAL VOLATILE COMPOUNDS AND THEIR EFFECTS ON REPRESENTATIVE SPECIES OF MEDICALLY AND AGRICULTURALLY IMPORTANT FUNGI
Thomas Edgar Cleveland
Louisiana School for Math, Science, and the Arts, Natchitoches, LA, USA

The purpose of this research project was to determine the effects of plant volatiles on three fungal species, Aspergillus nomius, A. fumigatus and Curvularia lunata, which are representative of many medically and agriculturally problematic filamentous fungi. It was shown that chopped or ground garlic, onion, mustard and radish emit volatiles that inhibit the growth of these fungi within enclosed Petri plates. Using Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectroscopy, five volatile compounds were identified in the emissions from plant tissues: allyl isothiocyanate from mustard, allyl disulfide and allyl sulfide from garlic, and methyl propyl disulfide and dipropyl disulfide from onion. When tested individually in the Petri plate assay, these volatiles showed strong antifungal activity against all three fungal species. IC50's (50% Inhibitory Concentration) of individual compounds were determined using A. nomius as the test species. Different liquid volumes of the compounds were allowed to volatilize in Petri plate airspaces to expose A. nomius to the compounds. In this assay, allyl isothiocyanate, allyl disulfide, allyl sulfide, methyl propyl disulfide, and dipropyl disulfide had approximate IC 50's of <2.0, 42, 77, 80, and 188 µl respectively after 70 hrs growth. In conclusion, the most potent antifungal volatile identified was allyl isothiocyanate from mustard. Volatile antifungals may have unique medical and agricultural applications beyond traditional (nonvolatile) antibiotics. They could be used as inhalants for lung infections or as volatile antibiotic wound dressings. They could also be used as soil fumigants to suppress plant pathogens in the field, and/or during the storage, transportation and packaging of fresh foods.

EVALUATION OF THE PENETRATION OF CONSTRUCTION DEBRIS THROUGH FACE MASKS AND THE POTENTIAL HEALTH RAMIFICATIONS
Elizabeth Rea Sears, Monterey High School 3211 47th Street
Lubbock, Texas 79413 United States of America

The purpose of the project was to explore the correlation between the penetration of construction debris through face mask and potential health ramifications. The procedure for testing involved 3 phases. In Phase One a testing apparatus was designed and constructed. In Phase Two 7 different face masks were tested for penetration by construction debris by placing a 5.08cm circular filter paper over a Mannequin mouth and securing and then a face mask was added. A fan was turned on, and construction debris was added through P.V.C. pipe allowing the debris to circulate and recirculate for intervals of 5 minutes and 10 minutes. Each mask was tested at three air flow rates---low, medium, and high. After each time interval and speed variation, the filter paper was collected and placed into a Petri dish for a total of 42 samples. The controls were 12 Petri dishes with construction debris and 12 Petri dishes with fileters for a toal of 66 samples in this project. To each sample was added 15ml of sterile distilled water. Each sample was kept at 30 Degrees Celsius until 2/13/03 when each sample was evaluated for growth. In Phase Three all growth was identified and related to its health ramifications. There was penetration of every face mask with construction debris in every timed interval and at every speed. When moisture was added to construction debris, there was identifiable growth. The identifiable growth does have health ramifications from minor infections to major illnesses. All 3 hypotheses were supported.

THE BABY CHANGING STATIONS, HYGIENE ZONES OR INFECTION ZONES?
Eloisa Gerena
Colegio Nuestra Senora de La Piedad, Carolina, Puerto Rico

This is the result of a series of a investigations that led to demonstrate the hypothesis that the presence of pathogenic bacterias are found in baby changing stations.<br><br> The purpose is to demonstrate that baby changing stations located in different bathrooms are not being desinfected exposing babies and/or users to different diseases.<br><br> Samples were taken when the stores opened at 9:00 a.m. and when they closed at 8:00 p.m. The final results not only sustained the hypothesis but went beyond the expectations. The samples were analyzed in an approved bacteriology laboratory. The results showed the presence of bacteria such as Klepsiella pneumoniae, Staph aureus, E. coli, Salmonella and Streptococcus.<br><br> It is alarming the effect may this can have on babies health. Many of the bacterias found may cause serious diseases, specially Salmonella which is higly dangerous and can cause even death.<br><br> With these findings, it can be concluded that baby changing stations are not being well cleaned and desinfected, exposing babies health and wellness.<br><br> It is recommended that public health laws should be more strict with stores. Mechanisms to comply with laws.<br><br>

HALO-ADAPTATION OF ESCHERICHIA COLI
Edgardo Rafael Canales
Colegio San Ignacio de Loyola, Guaynabo, Puerto Rico

<br><br>Halophilic bacteria live in high salt concentration environments. The purpose of this investigation was to induce the conversion of Escherichia coli into a halophile. The procedure used in this investigation went through different trials in which different salt concentrations were used in order to determine the maximum concentration in which E. coli could survive. Strains of E.coli were inoculated in different concentrations of NaCl solutions such as: 0.98g, 2g, 4g, 6g, 8g, 13g, and 16g, and then .1ml and 1ml of each inoculated solution were mixed with the agar in a Petri dish. After 48 hours of incubation E.coli had grown in all of these. A second repetition was done using: 18g, 21g, 24g, 27g, 30g, 33g, and 36g of NaCl, in which the same procedure was undertaken. The results were that E.coli had also grown in all of these concentrations. After reviewing the results and comparing them with past investigations, we realized that the procedure wasn’t correct. We decided to first mix the NaCl concentrations with the agar while it was being prepared. Growth was exhibited in a maximum concentration of 2g. The adaptation process began using 2g concentrations. From then on these were increased by .5g until obtaining growth in 4g of salt. Afterwards no more growth was observed in higher concentrations. Applications of these organisms can be used in cancer research, production of bio-plastics and medicines and the bioremediation of saline soils and ocean water. As a result, Escherichia coli were converted into moderately halophilic bacteria. <br><br>

THE INTERACTION BETWEEN LEUKOTOXIN AND CU,ZN SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE FROM THE PERIODONTAL PATHOGEN ACTINOBACILLUS ACTINOMYCETEMCOMITANS
Diane Hyemin Park
Townsend Harris High School, Flushing, NY, United States of America

Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, the etiologic agent for several human diseases including localized juvenile periodontitis (LJP) and infective endocarditis, produces a toxin called leukotoxin (LtxA), an 116kDa protein that is part of the repeats in toxin (RTX) group. LtxA affects polymorphonuclear leukocytes in humans and Old World primates. In this study, an interaction between LtxA and a protein from A.actinomycetemcomitans was investigated. Candidates for proteins that might interact include those proteins that regulate or take part in the secretion, modification, or activity of the toxin. LtxA was conjugated to a solid support and cell extract was passed over the immobilized column. Results showed that the protein Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) interacted with LtxA. Identification of SOD was accomplished by mass-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). Cu, Zn SOD is an enzyme that protects the bacterial cell from the oxidative bursts of the host cell. Discovery of the interaction between LtxA and SOD is a novel finding; interactions between toxins and proteins have not been well examined. This particular interaction is significant because it contributes to the general knowledge of the pathogenocity of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.

DISINFECTING SPOROFORM-PRODUCING MICROORGANISMS USING MICROWAVE TECHNOLOGY
Eugenia Shmidt
High Tech High School, North Bergen NJ, USA

The investigation of spore-producing prokaryotes intensified as recent threats of biological warfare such as anthrax contamination greatly affected the world. The effects of 0.1 M soluble chloride solutions were studied in conjunction with various doses of microwave radiation to investigate the effect of microwave power and exposition time on the living properties of Bacillus subtilis and Clostridium thermophilus spores to determine the most efficient, environmentally safe, and lethal treatment for bacterial endospores. Colony quantification, duration of growth phases, pH analyses, antibiotic resistance tests, plasmid DNA quantification, and ProLabo testing were performed. Microwave radiation induced changes in DNA, metabolic activity, duration and pH levels of growth phases, rate of germination, and antibiotic resistance in studied microorganisms. After AlCl3 pre-treatment coupled with exposure to 1,000 kJ radiation at a 2450 MHz microwave frequency, 84% of Bacillus subtilis spores did not germinate, antibiotic resistance was diminished, and 33.3% of plasmid DNA was destroyed. <br><br>

ANALYSIS OF BACTERIAL GROWTH ON COMPUTER KEYBOARDS
Laura Leigh Walker
Lakewood Ranch High School, Bradenton Florida, USA

The purpose of this project is to analyze bacterial growth from computer keyboards in public places and private residences and compare it to that of a public restroom.<br><br> Using MacConkey and Tryptic Soy agar, cultures were taken from public library, school, and home keyboards. The keyboards were then cleaned using sterile alcohol preps, to determine if this could decrease the amount of bacterial growth. Cultures from door and faucet handles of a public restroom were taken to compare with the growth from the keyboards. <br><br> The comparison of growth prior to alcohol cleaning showed home computers averaged the highest amount of growth on both agars. Escherichia coli, a harmful enteric bacteria, was identified in 4 library and home MacConkey agar samples. Cultures taken from home computers on MacConkey agar averaged 43% more bacteria than a public restroom. On Tryptic Soy agar, public library keyboards showed the most growth with 71% more growth than a restroom.<br><br> The alcohol preps substantially lowered the amount of bacterial growth. On MacConkey agar, home computers showed the greatest decrease of growth with an 84% decrease following cleaning. On Tryptic Soy agar, home computers also had the greatest decrease of 82% following cleaning.<br><br> We often do not think about the bacteria which we come in contact with every day. Although not all is harmful, much of it is. Decreasing the amount of bacteria you come into contact with is a simple as wiping off a keyboard with rubbing alcohol, which can be found in almost any household. <br><br> <br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF BEE PROPOLIS ON AEROBIC AND ANAEROBIC BACTERIA
Richard Joseph Romeo
MacArthur High School, San Antonio, Texas, The United States of America

Propolis, a substance used to solidify beehives, has been reported to have various anti-fungal and anti-microbial properties. Is bee propolis an antibacterial agent against anaerobic and aerobic bacteria in post- and pre-inoculated colonies? I hypothesize that bee propolis is an effective anti-bacterial agent versus all pre- and post-inoculated colonies of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.<br><br> For the first phase, using sterile technique, soy agar plates are streaked with non-pathogenic aerobes (Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Sarcina lutea, Bacillus megaterium, Rhodospirillum rubrum, and Serratia marcescens). Onto one group, approximately .10025 grams of bee propolis are placed. After 48 hours of incubation, post-inoculation (new growth with applied bee propolis) data is collected, while propolis is applied to the pre-inoculation group (old growth). After another 48-hour period, pre-inoculation data is collected. In the second phase, pathogens and non-pathogens, both aerobic and anaerobic (aerobes- Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, etc. anaerobes- Clostridium perfringens and Propionibacterium acnes) are used in a similar methodology. However, to ensure confluent growth, the Kirby Bower method is used.<br><br> In conclusion, I found evidence suggesting bee propolis to be an antibacterial agent against some types of aerobes and anaerobes. The largest zone of inhibition is Streptococcus pyogenes (Post-inoculation) measuring 16.5 mm; however, propolis was ineffective against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, Rhodospirillum rubrum (Pre-inoculation), and Propionibacterium acnes. Because bee propolis was effective against Streptococcus payogenes, a portion of my hypothesis is supported; still, bee propolis’s ineffectiveness towards Bacillus subtilis, Propionibacterium acnes, and other bacteria, helps reject another portion of my hypothesis.

DESIGNING A NEW CARDIOVASCULAR STENT FOR RAPID ENDOTHELIALIZATION
Mark Mohan Mazumder
Little Rock Central High School, Little Rock, AR 72202, USA

An encased cardiovascular stent was developed to minimize restenosis (re-blocking) in stented arteries, which affects nearly 25% of stented patients. In the new design, the wire mesh structure of the stent, made of either stainless steel or Nitinol shape memory alloys, is completely encased by a radially expandable polyurethane (PU) film grafted with polyethylene oxide (PEO) with covalently bonded and embedded antithrombogenic drugs. The goal is to promote the formation of a homogeneous endothelial cell lining with its inherent, long term defenses against restenosis along the inner wall of the stent. Tensile and SEM tests were carried out to study the radial expansion and the surface structure of the coatings. The stent wires were first coated with conductive polyaniline (PANI) for corrosion prevention. Measured by impedance spectroscopy, the resistance of the PANI-PU-PEO stent coating against corrosion in an artificial physiological solution increased first exponentially then linearly with the coating thickness (95% confidence level) reducing the corrosion rate to under 10µm/yr (50µm film thickness). Embedding multiple layers of drug particles at 8µm in diameter within the coating optimizes drug delivery (2mg/stent). Drug incorporation prevents fibrinogen attachment (restenosis precursor) and smooth muscle cell proliferation during endothelialization. Atomic force and epi-fluorescent microscopy were used to study fibrinogen attachment and endothelium confluence. A flow cell was constructed for in-vitro biocompatibility studies of the coating with plasma treatment for surface modification and sterilization. The feasibility studies show that an encased stent with an endothelialized inner wall can effectively prevent restenosis.

IDENTIFYING BACTERIAL GENES VIA NEURAL NETWORKS
Jarryd Brandon Levine
Paul D. Schreiber High School, Port Washington NY 11050 , United States

Non - coding Open Reading Frames (ORFs) are sections of DNA that seem to possess all of the properties necessary to initiate protein transcription, yet RNA polymerase does not bind to them. This project attempts to identify the correlation between the coding and non-coding sections of DNA, through the use of an Artificial Neural Network. After the network was created and verified, it was used to differentiate between the coding and non-coding sections of forty different bacterial organisms. Results indicated that a neural network could separate between bacterial coding and non-coding ORFs with over 85 percent accuracy when the separation is based on a combination of the codon content and periodicity of the sequence. Further investigation showed that, when periodicity alone was used as a separating property, the accuracy of the network remained the same, while when only codon content was used, the accuracy of the classification dropped by over 40 percent.

GRAPEVINE VIRUS A AS A TRANSIENT EXPRESSION VECTOR
Ayelet Abush
Gimnsia Realit , Rishon Le-Zion , Israel

Grape is an important fruit crop planted worldwide. The production of grape cultivars with disease resistance by conventional breeding is a complex and time-consuming process. Genetic transformation involves difficulties with consistency in expression and, moreover, public disapproval remains as challenges for this technology. As an alternative method, we have examined a recently developed grapevine virus-vector system, based on Grapevine virus A (GVA), for expression of foreign genes in plants. Plant virus vector is a biotechnological tool that often results in high, rapid and systemic expression of the recombinant proteins and considered as a more efficient system which can be constructed in only few weeks. The widespread existence of GVA in grape vineyards makes it the virus of choice for engineering a vitivirus-based expression vector. In addition to grapes, GVA infects Nicotiana benthamiana plants. This allowed the use of this system to examine expression of foreign genes in N.benthamiana plants. Based on GVA sequence, the genome of the virus was engineered as a vector containing duplication of the movement protein-subgenomic RNA promoter, supplemented by enzymatic restriction sites to be used for insertion of a foreign gene. In our project we examined the expression of the reporter gene GUS and the coat protein gene of the Citrus tristeza virus (CTV)in N.benthamiana plants. Both genes were successfully expressed. The GVA vector can be utilized as a biotechnological tool for genetic improvement of grapevines and can allow vine breeders to overcome obstacles involved in genetic manipulation of perennial fruiting plants.

NOVEL BACTERIA FROM KEY LARGO: SOURCES OF NEW DRUGS?
Anthony Appiadu Agyapong
Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, Baltimore, Maryland, USA

Heterotrophic bacteria from sponges from Conch Reef, Key Largo, Florida vary in diversity. Sponges are unique animals with porous bodies. Due to their porous nature, they serve as filter feeders and as natural habitats for many microbial organisms. Isolated bacteria came from three sponge extracts and surrounding samples. Sponges chosen for microbial investigation were Xestospongia muta, Ircinia strobolina and Niphates digitalis. Bacteria were isolated from concentration plates, obtained in pure cultures and DNA extracted from them using a Small Scale Gram Negative Bacterial DNA extraction method. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the 16s rRNA gene fragment of the DNA. PCR samples were run on an electrophoresis gel and amplified bands were cut out. Bacterial DNA was sent for sequencing in order to obtain at least 500 base pairs of sequence for phylogenetic analysis. Sequences were compared with those in the Genebank database to determine their closest relatives and potential compounds. A phylogenetic tree using Phydit program was created to show the relationships between strains. The sponge-associated microbial communities were found to be diverse and to include bacteria of interest for screening for new bioactive compounds such as brominated compounds.<br><br> Bacteria were screened for potential brominated compounds since these compounds are often bioactive and may be useful as drugs. A screen was developed by incorporating phenol red as a substrate into the media. Bacteria with the bromoperoxidase enzyme were expected to turn phenol red into bromophenol blue. All the bacterial samples were screened but none gave positive results in the assay.<br><br>

SELENIUM THE MIRACLE ELEMENT: FACT OR FICTION
Rebekah L. Langel
Ensweiler Academy/ Highland High School, Gary, Indiana

It is important that contact lenses are properly cared for. Improper care, or lack of care, will lead to the build-up of protein deposits, dirt, debris, and biofilm caused by bacteria. Contact lenses are one of the most common devices used for medical corrections to be subject to biofilms. Build-up on contact lenses may cause eyes to become irritated. The problems may become more sever then a case of discomfort. Improper care may lead to eye infections and diseases. Two types of bacteria commonly found on contact lenses are Pseudomonas auruginosa and Staphylococcus aureues.<br><br> The idea of using a natural element as a way to inhibit the growth of bacteria was interesting because it seems to be an inexpensive alternative to antibiotics. The bacteria, which are the focus of these experiments, are also resistant to many antibiotics. Because of the over use of antibiotics many bacteria are becoming resistant to them. <br><br> Experiments were performed to test the effect of Selenium as an inhibitor of biofilms on contact lenses associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aereus. The effect of Selenium on the growth of yeast was also examined.<br><br> At low concentrations Selenium seems to stimulate growth or give variable results in the bacteria. Although many health food advocates promote the use of these types of substances it is becoming more evident that we need to look more closely at how effective natural substances really are.<br><br>

Purpose:<br><br>To see what kind of microbial growth is on the handrails at Rosholt High School and to identify the microbes.<br><br>Procedure:<br><br>A. I swabbed the handrails in the school with sterile swabs and then applied the bacteria on nutrient agar plates. I placed them in the incubator for 24 hours at 37 degrees Celsius. Then, I counted the bacterial colonies for each location. I repeated this procedure for 22 days.<br><br>B. To identify the bacteria, I first performed the gram-stain technique. I looked through a microscope to determine the shape and arrangement of the bacteria and whether the bacteria were purple (gram-positive) or pink (gram-negative). <br><br>C. I performed the catalase testing by applying the bacteria on a slide and applying hydrogen peroxide to observe the reaction. If it fizzed it indicated a positive test, if not it was a negative test.<br><br>Conclusion:<br><br>The location with the highest bacteria count was location 7. Location 11 was the second highest. The week with the highest bacteria count on the handrails was December 10-12. The week of January 7-9 was the second highest week. Gram staining and catalase testing led to the identification of the following bacteria: Staphylococcus or Microccus and Neisseria. <br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF AMPICILLIN AND COLLOIDAL SILVER ON THE GROWTH OF ESCHERICHIA COLI AND STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS
Yesha Hemant Patel
Northern Garrett High School, Accident Maryland, USA

Purpose: This project was designed to show whether gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria would react the same way to two treatments and how successful are herbal remedies when compared to antibiotics.<br><br>Procedure: I completed the dilution series of 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, and 1/32 dosages using colloidal silver and ampicillin. I dispensed an equal amount of each bacteria solution into two sets, one for ampicillin and the other for colloidal silver. Next, I dispensed each bacteria solution into one separate petri dish. I incubated all my experimenting test tubes for at least 20 to 24 hours. I used a spectrophotometer to measure the absorptions of the cultures. <br><br>Data: All absorbencies are for doses 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, respectively. The absorptions for the colloidal silver tested on S. aureus were .650, .630, .530, .000, .000, and .002. Absorptions for silver on S. aureus were .002, .002, .002, .002, .001, and .000. For silver on E. coli, the absorptions were .570, .650, .690, .660, .680, and .680. When using ampicillin the levels were .003, .003, .003, .000, .001, and .030.<br><br>Conclusion: Ampicillin had a great effect on both types of bacteria. The absorptions for tubes with ampicillin and bacteria were low. When colloidal silver was applied to S. aureus, the antimicrobial inhibited the growth of bacteria indicated by the lower absorption values when compared to S. aureus with no treatment. However, none of the doses of colloidal silver affected the growth of E. coli.<br><br>

The purpose of this project was to test Beta Streptococcus Group A in an enriched medium and on blood agar petri dishes for Penicillin susceptibility. After obtaining the bacteria, petri dishes were prepared to create subcultures, and then were placed into the incubator for 24 hours at 36° Celsius. A petri dish of bacteria was prepared and an Ampicillin disc was added. The effect of the Ampicillin was determined by the size of its zone of inhibition, proving Streptococcus susceptibility.<br><br>Penicillin was diluted with Bacteriostatic 0.9% Sodium Chloride. Streptococcus was cultured in Thioglycollate Medium and incubated. Primary Streptococcus solution was injected into three separate Thioglycollate vials, along with Penicillin solutions of 1cc, 0.5cc, and 0.25cc. Incubated for 48 hours. Compared the growth to primary vial. Cultured solutions on four petri dishes. Added Penicillin, Ampicillin, and Bacitracin discs to plates, and incubated. Growth was inhibited by all dilutions of Penicillin.<br><br>Created second test by culturing Streptococcus in Medium with Penicillin: 1, 2, and 3 drops. Compared vials to primary solution. Floating Streptococcus particles indicated growth.<br><br>A gram stain slide was prepared to identify the gram-positive cells and examined under the microscope. Research supported that proper testing for Streptococcus must be performed and correct antibiotic treatments must be administered in order to avoid drug resistance.<br><br>Tests showed that this strain of Streptococcus is susceptible to Penicillin and capable of growing in an enriched medium. All bacteria and supplies used in the laboratory were disposed of through biohazard trash for incineration.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF VARIOUS PH LEVELS AND METALLIC IONS ON THE RATE OF BACTERIAL TRANSFORMATION IN ESCHERICHIA COLI
Lindsey Joy Herbert
Seneca High Schol, Seneca, MO USA

Every year, antibiotic resistance increases because of bacterial exposure to certain environmental elements. Many metallic ions are used as germicidal agents to kill bacteria in drinking water, in cleaning solutions and as topical antiseptics. Prolonged exposure can create specialized plasmids, which can transfer a genetic code for antibiotic resistance. <br><br> The purpose of this study is two-fold: 1) to find the optimal pH level in which bacteria transform and 2) to test the effects of various concentrations of metallic ions on the rate of transformation. During the transformation, pH-specific calcium chloride and metallic ions were added to test their effects. <br><br> The pH levels greatly enhanced the rate of bacterial transformation. pH 7 created the optimal level of transformation. The increase of transformation in E. coli could possibly be used to improve the standard bacterial transformation procedures. Although the unaltered pH of calcium chloride was merely 0.28 higher pH than the controlled 7, it created an extreme difference between the number of colonies. pH 7 had 1,000+ colonies; compared to the control, which contained an average of 500 colonies. Using t-tests to show the significance between the number of colonies, the p value between pH 7 and the control was 1.09294x10-09. <br><br> The transferring of the plasmid pUC8 was disrupted in the use of metallic ions resulting in the absence of resistance of ampicillin in the bacteria. However the lead acetate, silver nitrate 0.5%, and copper sulfate did not kill all of the bacteria. Only silver nitrate 1% completely destroyed all bacterial growth.<br><br>

USE OF PROBIOTIC BACTERIA TO INHIBIT TOOTH DECAY
Karli Oberg
Weber High School, Pleasant View, Utah, U.S.A.

Dental caries are caused by oral streptococci that commonly inhabit the oral cavity. Competitive inhibition by an alternate or enhanced microbial flora could decrease the number of oral streptococci, thus reducing the potential for tooth decay. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB), normally found in fermented dairy products, can inhabit the human digestive tract and have been shown to inhibit certain pathogenic bacteria. In this study, 15 strains of LAB isolated from commercial sources were screened for their inhibitory effect against four species of oral streptococci; Streptococcus oralis F, Streptococcus sanguis F, Streptococcus mutans 502, and Streptococcus salivarius 518. Results of the "agar flip" method indicated nine LAB strains were strong inhibitors with Lactobacillus acidophilus 202, L. acidophilus 2262, L. acidophilus NEB, Lactobacillus delbruekii ssp. bulgaricus 33409, and Pediococcus acidolactici PAF showing the largest zones of inhibition. Sugar fermentation profiles of these LAB strains showed several highly inhibitory strains (P. acidolactici PAF and L. acidophilus NEB) could not utilize many common sugars, making these strains more likely candidates for oral use. Overlay inhibition studies indicate at least one LAB strain may produce bacteriocin-like compounds that inhibit oral streptococci. Replacement or competitive inhibition of oral streptococci by LAB shows promise as a means of decreasing dental caries.

MEASURING THE PHOTOVOLTAGE RESPONSES OF HALOBACTERIUM SALINARUM MEMBRANES CONTAINING LIGHT SENSITIVE PROTEINS PART I
Zachary Louis Newman
Greencastle High School, Greencastle, Indiana, U.S.

In this project I attempt to observe a possible evolutionary connection between organisms with different forms of rhodopsin and evaluate what occurs when Halobacterium salinarum absorbs a photon and whether that effect is similar to photocells of humans. Specifically I examine the change in electric potential and photovoltage across the membrane of H. salinarum when it is exposed to varying wavelengths of light for different periods of times. A secondary goal of this project is to see how varying environmental conditions—specifically the availability of oxygen—affect these responses. These results could potentially lead to more control over the photovoltage responses of bacteriorhodopsin membranes and a better understanding of the development of vision. I hypothesize that when H. salinarum absorbs light, the photovoltage response would be a hyperpolerization similar to that found in photocells and that this response can be changed by exposing the H. salinarum to varying environmental conditions. This project is divided into two parts. Part I involves constructing the equipment necessary to create the membranes containing the proteins being examined. Part II will involve testing the equipment and testing my hypothesis. Through the past year I have researched, designed, built and started to test an original device to allow me to test my hypothesis. Currently I am putting the final design changes on it so that it is completely operational. If my hypothesis is correct, the results could inform current research on artificial retinas and other applications of bacteriorhodopsin.

THE VCE MDR PUMP: REGULATION OF THE VCE OPERON IN VIBRIO CHOLERAE
Amanda Dyann Dugan 
Rockdale Magnet School for Science and Technology, Conyers GA, United States 

The emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance have sharply reduced the effectiveness of available antibiotics. The most efficient resistance methods are multidrug resistance (MDR) pumps. The purpose of this research is to examine the regulation of the oepX-vceAB (vce) operon by the compounds expelled by the OepX-VceAB (VCE) pump and the role of the VCE MDR pump in providing antibiotic resistance to Vibrio cholerae. The main research hypothesis tested was: If compounds expelled by the VCE pump are added to V. cholerae strain 569B with the vce-lacZ fusion present, then the chemical will induce transcription of the vce operon which encodes proteins of the VCE pump. The role of compounds expelled by VCE in regulation of the vce operon encoding VCE were examined by first constructing and then using a transcriptional oepX-lacZ fusion plasmid pAD5. V. cholerae 569B carrying pAD5 or the vector plasmid pTL61T was exposed to a range of chemicals to determine their effect on vce transcription by measuring the level of â-galactosidase activity. Different concentrations of the compounds and lengths of exposure were also examined. Results of this study indicate that the level of induction of vce expression in V. cholerae varies according to type of compound, concentration, length of exposure, and exposure at different times during the growth cycle. The chemicals induced the pump and the hypothesis is also supported.

PROANTHOCYANIDINS: GROWTH INHIBITOR OF E.COLI - ABSENCE OF GFP ??
Yvette Corina Lopez
Taos High School, Taos, New Mexico (USA)

In prior years’ experimentation it was found that Proanthocyanidins (PA) were good anti-adhesion agents against E.coli HB101 Strain K-12. These results lead to this years’ project. “ Will the proliferative rate of E.coli be affected with the treatment of PA when transformed with pGLO plasmid DNA? It is hypothesized that the PA will suppress the metabolism and the proliferative rate of transformed E.coli, which will be evident by its fluorescence.<br><br> The methods utilized in conducting this project are as follows: Prepare all solutions and LB agar as prescribed. Grow the E.coli starter plates from lyophilized E.coli. Follow prescribed methods in preparation of transformation of E.coli with or without pGLO plasmid DNA (ice bath and heat shock). Place the inoculant samples into corresponding labeled plates and incubate at 37 c for 24 hours. Observe and record results (number of colonies, fluorescence of colony and light intensity).<br><br> The results are: The plates with ampicillin and non-transformed E.coli had no growth. The plates with transformed E.coli irregardless of media did have bacterial growth. The fluorescence was evident on those cultures with + pGLO + arabinose. The culture with + pGLO + arabinose + PA had a lower Light Intensity. The bacterial colony count was lowest and colonies were smaller on the plates with PA.<br><br> It is therefore concluded that the PA does have a suppressing effect on the metabolism and proliferative rate of the transformed E.coli strain (decreased number and size of bacterial colonies, lower light intensity). The data analyses and interpretation then supports all of the hypotheses as presented therefore all hypotheses are accepted.<br><br> Future experimentation maybe using egg membranes to simulate the <br><br>permeability of the migratory process of transformed E.coli when subjected to PA.<br><br>

COMMON ANTISEPTICS EFFECTS IN BACTERIA
Ramon Gomez-Moreno
Thomas Alva Edison School, Caguas, Puerto Rico

This research studied the effect of nine common antiseptics on the control of certain kinds of bacteria. The antiseptics used had one of the following active ingredients: Isopropyl alcohol 70%, Benzalkonium Chloride 0.13%, Iodine Solution, Triclosan, Hydrogen Peroxide 3%, Isopropyl Alcohol 91% and Clorexihidine gluconate. These antiseptics were tested for five different bacteria that may cause skin infections. The bacteria were: Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomona aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundi and Klebsiella pneumoneae. The method used was Kirby Bauer(disk diffusion test). Bacteria suspensions were adjusted to approximately 10 CFU/ml by comparing its turbidity to a Mc farland 0.5. Each suspension was swabbed over the surface of each Mueller Hinton agar plate. After overnight incubation, the diameters of the zone produced by antiseptics inhibition of bacteria growth was measured. The antiseptics that have Alcohol Isopropyl of 70% and 91% and the Benzethonium 0.2% showed little effect in comparison to other antiseptics. The antiseptics with Benzalkonium Chloride showed moderate effect. The one with Triclosan and the one with Hydrogen Peroxide concentration of 3% showed very high effect. Hydrogen peroxide decomposes, forming “radical hydroxyl” wich has toxic effect in cells. The Triclosan is used in cosmetics, soap, toothpaste and mouthwash, mainly for its bacteriological effect. However recent studies demonstrate that it can be cancerous to the living tissue. <br><br> Alcohol Isopropyl and Iodine showed little effect in bacteria growth and the antiseptics that contains these substances are widely used in hospitals. Its necessary to produce new antiseptics that have bactericidal effect without damaging the living tissue.

BURNING HOT OYSTERS
Mirka Angelica Morales
S.E.S.O Mayaguez, Puerto Rico

<br><br>Many seafood-lovers go to a restaurant or fish market to purchase fresh muscles to prepare. Many muscles and Ostrea lurida, are prepared to eat raw with lemon juice or Tabasco sauce for extra taste. The FDA was faced with a health issue involving raw oysters that are contaminated with bacteria that are dangerous and possibly fatal. <br><br> This experiment determined if Tabasco sauce served as an inhibitor for the bacteria found in Ostrea lurida. Nutrient agar (prepared with 1% and 50% sea- water) was used in Petri dishes to create a colony of bacteria. After the bacteria grew on the dish, the inhibition zone measured. As more drops of sauce were added the larger the inhibition zone appeared on the dish. Tabasco sauce was successful as an inhibitor of the bacteria that was found on the Ostrea lurida. <br><br>The bacteria present in the Ostrea lurida grew throughout the nutrient agar. If the bacteria was destroyed by the sauce, a halo created around the paper discs containing the sauce would be observed. The zone was used to measure the ring around the paper disc, the larger the ring, the greater the amount of bacteria that was destroyed.<br><br>This project is recommended for further experimentation to investigate the amount of time Tabasco sauce must have in contact with the bacteria for inhibition. Tests can be made to find other inhibitors used on shellfish, such as lemon juice or vinagar dressing, to see if they are more effective than Tabasco sauce. <br><br>

Pedro Jose Hernandez
S.U. Almirante Norte, Vega Baja, Puerto Rico

Spices are aromatic herbs frequently used in recipies.The cloves are one of them.Clove is used to produce a sweet taste in different plates.<br><br> This study was done to find out if the clove has the property of inhibiting bacterium growth.The microorganisms under study were E.coli,P.vulgaris and S.aureus.The culture media used were Triptic Soy Agar, Blood Agar and MacConkey Agar.Three plates were identified with each microorganism's name for each of the three culture media plates. Three plates with one kind microorganism each were used for each of the three culture media plates as the control group.Each plate was inoculated with commercial swabs impregnated with each microorganism. Three cloves were put in each plate exceptin the control plates.<br><br> All plates were put in an incubator for 48 hours.All the security rules and aseptic techniques were used during the experimental process.The student only observed the scientists managing the bacterias.<br><br> The results obtained demostrated that the Syzyium aeromaticum inhibits the bacterium growth of the E.coli and S.aureus.Clove didn't inhibit the growth of P.vulgaris bacterium.These results demostrated that the Syzyium aeromaticum has bactericidal properties.<br><br> As a future projection it will be interesting to prepare an extract of clove in different concentrations to be used as a possible bactericide instead of the sticks of clove. Also it will be possible to prepare a mouthwash using a clove extract.

THE PRESENCE OF E. COLI AT THE MONSERRATE CHANNEL
Sezcov Ivan Rivera 
Berwind High School, San Juan, Puerto Rico

Water contamination is an alarming situation worldwide. This investigation was done to determine if there was human fecal contamination in the Monserrate channel of the Blasina Lagoon in Carolina. An indirect indicator of human fecal contamination was used to detect the presence of Escherichia coli. The possible human fecal contamination in the channel represents health risks to the community and also contributes to the esthetic deterioration of the water and the general quality of the environment. If there are sanitary discharges in the adjacent areas to the Monserrate channel it will be possible to detect Escherichia coli by the human fecal indicator. If the presence of Escherichia coli is not detected it can be assumed that there is no human fecal contamination of this body of water.<br><br>To corroborate the hypothesis a water sampling procedure was undertaken at the Monserrate channel. At the laboratory the sample was treated with the commercial indicator Coliert® to detect the presence of Escherichia coli and other coliforms. They were incubated for twenty-four hours at thirty-five Celsius degrees, together with a negative control and a positive control.<br><br>The results were as follows: the experimental sample and the positive control group turned to a yellow coloration indicating the presence of total coliforms. When exposed to an ultraviolet light both samples showed fluorescence in the container indicating the presence of Escherichia coli. On a future study it will be possible to investigate the concentration of this organism in the water.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF PH ON BIOLUMINESCENT DINOFLAGELLATES
Peter Douglas Clark
St. Andrew's Episcopal School, Ridgeland, MS, USA

The purpose of this project was to determine if pH affected the bioluminescence of Pyrocystis fusiformis, a marine dinoflagellate. It was hypothesized that varying pH levels would affect the bioluminescence produced by P. fusiformis.<br><br> Fourteen flasks were setup with 2 cultures of P. fusiformis and hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide was used to vary the pH in the experimental groups. Data were collected the first time by measuring the light emitted by the dinoflagellates shortly after addition of the acid or base. All tests were done with 1 minute of stirring and 2 minutes of data collection.<br><br> In all the cultures tested, the varying pH did affect the bioluminescence of P. fusiformis. The group containing pH 9.0 had the highest light average (in lux), while pH 7.5 had the lowest light average. The pHs 6.5, 9.0, and 9.5 peeked in light on the second day only to plummet the next day. The lowest group average of 0.65 lux was held by pH 6.5 on the 4th day. Dinoflagellates respond to mechanical or chemical stimulation by emitting characteristic patterns of light. These patterns were found to be different in the various pHs. Evidence was collected that indicated dinoflagellates also react to light of certain wavelengths.

HORROR HOSPITAL
Vernon Matthew Langford
Cass Technical High School, Detroit, MI, United States of America

Determining what pathogenic or potentially pathogenic agents reside within the confinements of a hospital is this project’s purpose. It’s hypothesized that potentially pathogenic agents reside in a hospital that receives massive traffic daily. The presence of fecal coliforms such as Escherichia coli, or other microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, and Penicillium sp. are expected to be present. The colony count and the type of pathogen will be classified using photographs, microscopic images, staining techniques. These data will be statistically analyzed. <br><br>In order to complete this project, gather and sterilize the materials to prevent the presence of bacterial pathogens which could cause limitations. Indirect sampling must be used in gathering samples. Take a picture of the area which will be called the sample site. Put sterile gloves on and brush forcefully against the fomite in order to obtain the sample. Upon brushing against the area, immediately remove the glove and place it into a biomedical bag. Seal the bag and take it directly to a lab equipped with an incubator. Incubate the bag at 30°C for 24 hours. Swab the glove and streak the sample onto prepared agar plates. Incubate the plates for 24 hours. <br><br>Specific media and staining techniques will be utilized for the data collection process. Colonies will be classified by using macroscopic observations. Microscopic data collection will allow the detection of the general morphology of the microorganism to be observed. Photos of the slides will be taken to document findings. Hospital professionals will handle the disposal of all materials. Procedures to prevent nosocomial catastrophes are needed by hospitals. These data will also discover any vulnerable areas where intentional contaminations could occur.<br><br>

OILFIELD BACTERIA TIME KILL STUDY
Erin Lynn Conaway
Memorial High School, Victoria Texas, U.S.A.

Six biocides were utilized in this experiment to evaluate their effectiveness for killing sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) and acid producing bacteria (APB) in oilfield produced saltwater. Four chemical concentrations applied over a four hour contact time were used for the six biocides. Data will conclude that the biocides have ability to kill both types of bacteria. Since biocides work by different methods to kill bacteria the results will vary, but as concentrations get higher the number of bacteria killed will be higher. This experiment was performed by applying one percent dilution biocides to field saltwater samples using an Eppendorf pipetter. After achieving the desired biocide contact time, SRB and APB culture vials were inoculated for the serial dilution time kill study. The samples were incubated at ambient temperature. Data was logged every seven days until twenty eight incubation period was reached. For SRB, final data indicated the optimum kill resulted in zero (0) bacteria per milliliter and was achieved with quaternary ammonium and isothiazolin biocides at three hundred parts per million. Final data for APB showed the optimum kill resulted in one to nine (1-9) bacteria per milliliter and was achieved with glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, isothiazolin, and tetrakishhydroxymethylphosphoniumsulfate biocides at four hundred parts per million. Higher treating concentrations yielded superior results, but not dramatically. In four instances the results did not vary between three of the four concentrations, however, there was a dramatic difference between the controls and treated samples. Each type of bacteria can be effectively controlled with biocides. <br><br>

A TWO YEAR STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF SULFUR, CALCIUM CARBONATE, AND FERRIC OXIDE ON THE CORROSION OF TIN AND COPPER BY THIOBACILLUS THIOPARUS
Charlie Demon McCullum
Yazoo City High School, Yazoo City, MS, United States of America

The purpose of this project is to determine the effects of ferric oxide, calcium carbonate, and sulfur on the corrosion of tin and copper metals by Thiobacillus thioparus. It is hypothesized that these chemicals will have an effect on the corrosion of tin and copper. Six 1000ml beakers were used and divided into the following: Two control groups containing tin and copper respectively; two experimental groups containing the calcium carbonate, and two experimental groups containing the sulfur. Each beaker was filled with 17ml of 0.5M ferric oxide solution and 5gms of each metal. Experimental group I was given everything in control group, but 17ml of 0.5M calcium carbonate solution was added. Experimental group II was given everything in control group, but 17ml of 0.5M sulfur solution was added. Changes in pH and color of the metals were obsevered and recorded over a period of ten days. It is concluded that the ferric oxide, calcium carbonate, and sulfur has an effect on the corrosion of tin and copper by Thiobacillus thioparus.

PATHOGENS IN THE PUBLIC SETTING
Travis Diaz
Grants High School, Grants, New Mexico, USA

The purpose of this project was to investigate if pathogenic bacteria existed on public countertops, if there were hemolytic strains, and find out of they were resistant to penicillin and Ampicillin. the hypothesis was that bacteria like streptococci and staphylococci would be found on public countertops. It was also believed that bacteria isolated would be hemolytic and resistant to Penicillin and Ampicillin. Experiements conducted were primary cultures of bacteria found on public countertops, Gram staining/microscopic observation to identify bacteria, secondary culturing to isolate bacterial strains, and blood agar cultures of the isolates for Penicillin and Ampicillin Resistance. The controls for the experiments were several agar plates that were streaked with sterile swabs, the same type of countertops were swabbed, and no previous sterilization methods were used by the employees who were unaware when samples would be collected.<br><br>Results indicated the existence of potential pathogens such as Strep and Staph, along iwth Bacilli and a Spiorchete. Countertop #2 showed the highest bacterial density. All locatins tested positive for hemolytic strains of Staphylococcus. The Staph isolated were catalase positive. From the eight culture plates with Staphylococcus, only two plates showed resistance to Penicillin and Ampicillin. The hypothesis of this project was proven true. Streptococcus and Staphylococcus strains do exist on public countertops, some of which were hemolytic. Other bacteria were also found which could be potential pathogens, particularly for individuals with weaker immune systems.

METHODS TO FIND ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS SPUTUM
Sarah Ann Wilfahrt, Park City High School
Park City, UT, USA

A new quantitative plating method was utilized to recover additional antibiotic resistant bacteria in sputum collected from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. CF patients have chronic infection in their upper respiratory system due to the presence of thick mucus, which provides an ideal growth environment for bacteria. CF patients receive ongoing antibiotic therapy resulting in the potential development of antibiotic resistant, pathogenic bacteria species. The standard plating method might not recover all the pathogenic bacteria present in the CF patients‚ lungs. The new method is designed to isolate additional bacteria species for antibiotic susceptibility testing to improve the efficacy of antibiotic therapy. <br><br> Standard culture techniques involve the direct plating of an aliquot of sputum samples to culture media. The new method differs from standard culture techniques in that sputum samples are digested with dithiothreitol (DTT) prior to culture. A second step to the new method was evaluated that involved a post digestion 1:50 dilution with water prior to culture. <br><br> The digestion procedure and the digestion with dilution procedure did not recover any additional organisms vs. the standard plating procedure. However, the cultures from both digestion procedures did not recover mold species which were recovered by the standard cultures. The results indicate that the use of DTT as a digestion reagent in sputum plating techniques may be ineffective, as the chemical can inhibit fungus growth on culture media. The isolation and identification of mold could be critical information in the accurate diagnosis of a CF patient's infection and subsequent antimicrobial therapy.<br><br>

THE QUEST FOR A "MAGIC BULLET" - THE SIX YEAR SAGA CONTINUES
Laura Anne Hartman
China Spring High School, China Spring, TX, United States of America

Escalating numbers of microorganisms are developing resistance to popular antibiotics. This trend is posing a mounting threat in the medical world today. Nosocomial infections are the fourth-leading cause of death in the United States. Scientists have returned to the search for new antibiotics in the hopes of finding a "magic bullet". <br><br> The organisms chosen for study this year included: Paenibacillus alvei, Bacillus pumilis, and Streptomyces purpureus. All three were isolated in my past research. The purpose of this experiment was to discover if soluble antibiotic substances could be isolated from these microorganisms. <br><br> Paenibacillus alvei, Bacillus pumilis, and Streptomyces purpureus were grown in nutrient broth for five days. The four control organisms, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were grown in nutrient broth for two days. <br><br> Following incubation, the variable tubes were filtered through a 0.2 micron filter so that the microorganisms were removed from the broth. The discs were then placed on the plates containing the control organisms. The plates were incubated for 24 hours. Following incubation, the presence or absence of zones of inhibition surrounding the discs was recorded. <br><br> Antibiotic substances were successfully isolated from the organisms. These substances were effective against all of the control organisms except M. smegmatis.<br><br> <br><br>

ADAPTATION OF MALASSEZIA PACHYDERMATIS THROUGH CONSUMPTION OF DIFFERENT OILS
Kruti K. Shah
Warren East High School, Bowling Green, Kentucky, United States

Across the world, oil spills continue to occur; techniques of bioremediation have been researched. However, more research techniques are needed to address this growing problem. The yeast known as malassezia pachydermatis which is found in dog’s ears could possibly be a means of bioremediation for these oil spills. The colony flourishes on oils. Growth of these colonies will be tested by adapting it to corn oil, mineral oil, and then engine oil to see if it truly can be used for means of bioremediation. By growing the colony on corn oil, it will slowly be adapted to mineral oil, leaving one as a control. Thereafter, when the colony grows on mineral oil, it will slowly be adapted to engine oil which is the most representative of an oil spill. The malassezia pachydermatis should be able to grow on the engine oil and prove to be useful in bioremediation while cleaning up oil spills as it utilizes the engine oil to grow its own colony. <br><br> <br><br> It was evidenced that the malassezia pachydermatis could be grown on corn oil and then adapted to grow on mineral oil which is refined crude oil. After obtaining results, the malassezia pachydermatis was then adapted to grown on engine oil which is the most representative of an oil spill. The malassezia pachydermatis as hypothesized did use the engine oil to grow. With these results, this yeast could possibly used to clean up oil spills as a means of bioremediation.

IS THERE A CYTOPLASMIC PH CHANGE IN YEAST TO HYPHAL TRANSITION IN CANDIDA ALBICANS?
Ewa Szymanska
Thomas R. Proctor, Utica, New York, U.S.A.

Candida albicans is a dimorphic yeast that is part of the human microbial flora.The hyphal form of this fungus is the most pathogenic to humans. This organism is a growing threat to individuals with immunodeficient illnesses. In 1998 Stewart at al found that with the dimorphic transition of C.albicans during the germ tube formation is also accompanied by an abrupt change in the internal pH of C. albicans. Last year, my work focused on the effects of sphingolipids had on the hyphal transition in C.albicans, and showed that sphingolipids did inhibit the formation of hyphae. It has been established in the literature that, hyphal formation in C.albicans is dependent on an increase in cytoplasmic pH as H+ are pumped out of the cell across the plasma membrane. The question addressed in this project is: is there a major shift in the cytoplasmic pH of C.albicans during the yeast to hyphal transition and is it inhibited by sphingolipds?<br><br>Experiment #1 The C.albicans 3153A was grown on YM agar slants. The cells were incubated in a water shaker at 37 C for various periods of time in Vogel's minimal media + N-acetyl glucosamine. To the cells for 2 min. were added 14C benzoic acid and tritiated water. The<br><br>label was 5ml of the 1/1000 dilution of the benzoic acid mixed with 10ul of the tritiated water. 100ul of the supernadent was collected into a scint vial and the rest was removed with a vacuum. Then the cells were resuspended in 100ul of steril water and mixed. Then transferred the cell pellet into a scint vial. Put into each vial 4ml of scintiverse and placed in the counter. Using the measurements of the chemicals and equations I was able to determine the internal pH of C.albicans from 0min to 60min. The result of this experiment showed no internal pH change in the yeast to hyphal formation in C.albicans.<br><br>Experiment #2 The C.albicans 3153A was grown on the YM agar slants. The cells were incubated in a water shaker bath at 37 C for various periods of time in Vogels's minimal media + N-acetyl glucosamine. The cells were filtered through the glass fiber filters and <br><br>resuspended in steril distilled water. Then 100ul of toluene was added to permeablized the cell membrane and mixed. The cells then were centrifuge at full speed in a table top clinical<br><br>centrifuge for 10min. The supernadent then was measured with a pH meter to determine the internal pH of C.albicans from 0min to 60min. This experiment was less sensitive, but the results showed a small internal pH change during the yeast to hyphal transition.<br><br>

MOUSE MAMMARY TUMOR VIRUS (MMTV): INVESTIGATING THE ROLE OF MOUSE TRANSFERRIN RECEPTOR 1 (MTF R1) POLYMORPHISMS IN RESISTANCE TO RETROVIRAL INFECTION
Maria Elena De Obaldia, Moorestown High School
Moorestown, New Jersey, USA

Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) is an infectious retrovirus that causes breast cancer in mice by insertional activation of cellular oncogenes. MMTV uses the mouse transferrin receptor 1 (mTfR1) as its cell entry receptor, hijacking the cell’s means of obtaining iron. This project aims to identify the role of mTfR1 polymorphisms in resistance to MMTV infection. Human cells, which are typically MMTV-resistant, become susceptible when they express the mTfR1, which shows 76% identity and 86% homology to the human TfR1. Discovering what differences make certain TfR1s nonfunctional as MMTV receptors has anti-retroviral applications, and could elucidate why humans are resistant to MMTV.<br><br> MMTV-resistant mice studied include Pera, C57BL/10, and B10.BR. The researcher hypothesized that polymorphisms in the mTfR1 genes of resistant mice may cause them to be nonfunctional as MMTV receptors. Because of mTfR1’s vital role in iron transport, differences between strains are likely to be subtle: polymorphisms, rather than deletions or frame-shifts.<br><br> RNA obtained from mouse tissue was reverse transcribed using random oligonucleotide primers to make complementary DNA. Gene-specific primers and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to amplify overlapping regions of the mTfR1 gene of each strain. The mTfR1 sequences of the resistant strains were compared to that of the susceptible C57BL/6 strain, using Basic Line Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) software.<br><br> A histidine to aspartate nonconservative amino acid substitution mapping to the surface of TfR1 was found in the C57BL/10 cDNA. This polymorphism will be investigated for a potential role in MMTV resistance. This may point to the site of viral envelope protein-mTfR1 interaction, a finding with anti-viral therapy applications.

THE ROLE OF MULTI-DRUG RESISTANCE (MDR) PUMPS IN RESISTANCE TO THE IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE DRUG FK506 IN SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE
Anna Lisa De Obaldia, Moorestown High School
Moorestown, New Jersey, USA

In a previous experiment, Saccharomyces cerevisiae developed resistance to the immunosuppressive drug FK506 after pre-exposure to the drug. A pretreated culture grew better than an untreated culture on media containing FK506. This experiment examines the cause of this resistance. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) pumps expel chemotherapy drugs from tumor cells, causing treatments to become ineffective. The researcher hypothesized that MDR pump activation in S. cerevisiae is responsible for resistance to FK506. FK506 kills yeast cells by inhibiting calcineurin, an enzyme which provides salt protection and is crucial to signal transduction pathways.<br><br> Twenty-four yeast deletion mutants were obtained, each missing a different MDR pump. Microtiter plates filled with broths of twelve FK506 concentrations were inoculated with two versions of each mutant: one pre-treated with FK506 and the other untreated. A plate reader at 650 nanometers analyzed the cell density in each well. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was calculated for each mutant using the Boltzmann equation. Mutants were also replica-plated to agar plates containing NaCl and FK506 at six concentrations.<br><br> The PDR18 and YOR1 deletion mutants were eight times more susceptible to FK506, showing that these MDR pumps protect against FK506 when present and may cause FK506 resistance. Calcineurin inhibiting drugs, such as FK506, inhibit T-cell activation, and are used to prevent organ transplant rejection. Resistance to FK506 would have grave implications. Furthermore, calcineurin inhibitors could provide a treatment for Down’s syndrome by preventing DSCR1 overexpression caused by interaction with calcineurin. Understanding mechanisms of FK506 resistance will enable us to develop therapies which block MDR pumps, leading to improved chemotherapy treatments and preventing the development of FK506 resistance in humans.

VORTICELLA

Vorticella is a ciliate that feeds primarily on bacteria, filtering food through its active oral ciliature. According to most literature, Vorticella accepts particles only according to their physical characteristics. <br><br> Does the bacteria’s shape affect its acceptability to Vorticella as food? The Vorticellae were offered Rhodospirillum rubrum (helixes), Bacillus subtillus (rods), and Micrococcus luteus (spheres). Contrary to my expectation, Vorticella ingested only small colonies of M. luteus and the smallest B. subtillus.<br><br> Counting food vacuoles of bacteria stained with the fluorochrome Acridine Orange and the vital stain Neutral Red proved difficult as the Vorticella picked up bacteria and dyes within a few minutes. The vacuole number varied greatly (from 0 to 25) and did not increase over time.<br><br> The literature is controversial as to whether filter-feeding ciliates feed on palpable and impalpable particles at the same rate. In the second phase of this experiment, the number of seconds between vacuole formations was recorded for Vorticella feeding on 0.481 micrometer polystyrene latex beads and similar sized M. luteus bacteria. Feeding rates were also determined for a control with no added particles. <br><br> The average Vorticella feeding rate on Micrococcus was 65.1 seconds per vacuole, on the microspheres, 133.4 seconds per vacuole, and on the control, 52.6 seconds per vacuole, indicating that vacuole formation rate is affected by the palpability of particles. The control rate was comparable to the Micrococcus rate, confirming that particle concentration does not affect feeding rate.<br><br>

ADAPTIVE RESPONSES OF S.AUREUS TO IL-1 AND HEAT SHOCK: IMPLICATIONS IN BACTERIAL PATHOGENISIS
Shaleen Tarun Cholera
White Station High School, Memphis TN, U.S.A

S. aureus has been known to cause ailments such as acne to deep-seated infections such as Toxic Shock Syndrome and Meningitis. S. aureus is prevalent in hospitalized patients suffering from exaggerated inflammatory immune response. Due to excessive and intermittent use of antibiotics in hospitals it has developed resistance to most antibiotics. <br><br>It was hypothesized that S. aureus resist the body's immune responses, specifically inflammatory response and the fever. It does this by manipulating specific genes to express "virulence factors". In this study we focused on the ability of S. aureus to counteract the host defense system by use of two types of virulence factors, leukotoxins and microbial surface components recognizing matrix molecules (MSCRAMMs). Both of these factors help the bacteria in its invasion process of the human body. Leukotoxins lyse leukocytes, typically neutrophils; MSCRAMMs help bacteria adhere to matrix, the material between cells so that it may colonize faster. <br><br>This hypothesis's were tested by examining the effects of increased concentrations of IL-1beta, an inflammatory mediator, on cultures of S. aureus. Heat-shock response was also tested by examining separate cultures of bacteria for increased amounts of time. The gene expression was examined using a semi-quantative RT-PCR. It was found that S. aureus could adapt to the innate immune responses by regulating the expression of the virulence genes. To further this project, new strains are being tested, specifically ones that are isolated from patients with inflammation and S.aureus invasion. Also, more genes are being examined using a Real-Time PCR and the super-array technique<br><br>

Lichens have traditionally been used for a range of human purposes, namely, food and seasonings, perfume base, dyestuffs, poisons, medicine and animal feed. In medicine, one of the most widely documented genii of lichen is Usnea, which has a history dating back to ancient China. There are between 13,000 and 17,000 known species of lichen, 50% of which contain substances with antibiotic properties.<br><br>The purpose of this investigation was to test for the presence of anti-microbial substances in four commonly occurring lichen species. Samples of Platismatia glauca, Graphis elegans, Lepraria incana and Lecanora chlarotera were collected from the National Botanic Garden of Wales. They were ground with acid-washed sand and ethanol to facilitate extraction of any active ingredient, then purified using filtration to exclude cell debris and rotary evaporation to remove the ethanol. A disk diffusion test was performed on two bacterial species, namely, Escherichia coli (Gram negative) and Micrococcus luteus (Gram positive).<br><br>Results from all four tests showed that only the Lecanora extract was effective against the Micrococcus culture, while none of the extracts were effective against the E. coli.<br><br>Subsequent assessment of the potency of the bactericidal compound proved more difficult, as the differential rate of diffusion of extract through the agar, relative to a tetracycline standard, was a major complicating factor. Similar analysis of a further seven samples will determine whether this active ingredient is common in other lichen and to ascertain its family, first by separation using a SEP-PAK, followed by fast atom bombardment.<br><br>

CATECHIN: FOR ORAL BACTERIA IT'S NOT THEIR CUP OF TEA! THE INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF GREEN TEA CATECHINS ON ORAL BACTERIA.
Gregory Andrew Warot
Boston Latin Academy, Boston, Massachusetts, USA

Catechin, a polyphenolic compound extracted from green tea is known to have anti-bacterial properties and has the potential to become a novel alternative medical therapy to treat periodontitis. An experiment was designed to determine the inhibitory effects of catechin on the growth of oral bacteria associated with periodontal disease. Eight different concentrations of the green tea catechin were assayed on twenty strains of bacteria, varying in pathogenic association with periodontitis . In addition, four different purified isoforms of green tea catechin were tested for growth inhibition on Actinobacillus actinomicetemcomitans, a major promoter of juvenile periodontitis. An experiment was also conducted to compare the inhibitory effects of commercially available brewed black and green tea, and another comparing the effects of Listerine and catechin on oral bacteria.<br><br> Experimental evidence suggested that all strains of the oral bacteria tested were inhibited by the catechin. However, A. actinomicetemcomitans displayed the most growth inhibition from the various concentrations of catechin. Among the four catechin isoforms, epigallocatechin gallate demonstrated the greatest anti-bacterial effect on A. actinomicetemcomitans. The green tea brew showed greater amounts of inhibition compared to the brewed black tea.<br><br> The catechin-based mouthwash also had inhibitory effects on the oral bacteria of healthy volunteers, which was comparable to the inhibition by Listerine. The data received from these experiments suggests that green tea catechins do possess the ability to inhibit the growth of oral bacteria associated with periodontal disease.<br><br>

THE PREVALENCE OF ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANT BACTERIA IN ORGANIC VERSUS CONVENTIONAL FOODS
Kasia Elizabeth Whiting
North Attleboro High School, North Attleboro, MA , U.S.A.

This project tested the prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in organic versus conventional foods. Samples were taken from the inside and outside of green bell peppers and red Macintosh apples. The samples were grown on a regular medium, LB agar. After the plates were incubated for 24 hours, they were replica plated onto antibiotic plates. The data and results were derived from the amount of colonies that grew on the antibiotic plates. <br><br> To determine whether or not the bacteria were enteric, a sample was replica plated onto antibiotic MacConkey plates as well. After the bacteria was plated onto the antibiotic MacConkey plates, the Carbohydrate Fermentation tubes were inoculated with the colonies that fermented lactose (the colonies were red). After they had been incubated for 24 hours, one of the tubes formed a bubble, which indicating that a gas was formed. Some of the bacteria from this tube was plated on an EMB plate. The growth on the plate had a green sheen to it. Which suggested that it was probably a coliform bacterium. <br><br> The end result indicated that the organic foods had more antibiotic resistant bacteria than the conventional foods. Not only did the results indicate a reversal of what all the research had shown, but also the difference between the two groups was significantly greater than what was expected. Analysis of the antibiotic LB plates found that there were 3,065 resistant colonies for the organic fruits, and 1,240 for the conventional fruits. <br><br>

OVEREXPRESSION OF CYP1 IN CD4+ T LYMPHOCYTE CELLS: THE POSSIBILITY OF INHIBITING HIV-1 REPLICATION
Syam Mohan, Mass Acad of Math and Sci.
Worcester, MA, USA

This investigation was aimed at genetically engineering CD4+ lymphocyte cells to overexpress the antifungal protein CYP1 from the legume Vigna var. Radiata (mung bean) as a defense mechanism against invading HIV-1. A previous study utilizing purified CYP1 with recombinant HIV-1 integrase, reverse transcriptase, and protease in an in vitro assay system indicated that CYP1 demonstrates inhibitory activity against both the HIV-1 integrase and protease enzymes. Our investigation used the technique of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the CYP1 nucleotide sequence from mung bean genomic DNA. The resulting amplified DNA was then cloned into an expression vector. The expression vector carrying the inserted CYP1 sequence was then transfected into the CD4+ T cell line CEMx174 allowing CYP1 protein to be expressed to a high level in this cell line. Further research is necessary to determine to what extent the HIV-1 retrovirus can be inhibited by overexpression of CYP1. <br><br><br>

RESTORING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BETA-LACTAM ANTIBIOTICS BY COMBATING BACTERIAL DEFENSE MECHANISMS: EXPLORING NATURAL AGENTS AS ENZYME BLOCKERS
Ibraheem Maqsood Mohammed, Niceville Senior High School
Niceville, FL, United States of America

Steadily decreasing options for combating antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains led me to pursue this investigation. In a previous study, I found that green tea shows synergism with the penicillin family. The objectives of this project were to determine whether green tea and other natural agents (honey and garlic) reverse resistance to the penicillin and cephalosporin classes of antibiotics by inhibiting production or secretion of beta-lactamase. To investigate the objectives, four clinical isolates of bacterial strains were obtained; this was to test the activity of natural agents against four of the five major types of beta-lactamases (cephalosporinase, gram -ve and gram +ve penicillinases, and AmpC). Next, sub-inhibitory concentrations of each agent for each bacterial strain were found. Tubes with these concentrations were centrifuged and the supernatant and pellet were both checked for beta-lactamase presence. Presence of the enzyme in the pellet but not the supernatant implied that secretion had been inhibited; presence in neither implied that production had been inhibited. To validate results, multiple trials were conducted for each part of the investigation. The final results obtained show that this investigation was indeed worthwhile. It was found that green tea did in fact inhibit both the production and secretion of four resistance enzyme; honey inhibited secretion of three enzymes; and garlic inhibited secretion of two enzymes. These enzyme blocking properties of the natural agents were all present at extremely low concentrations. The results indicate that, using natural agents, production and/or secretion of beta-lactamase resistance enzymes can be blocked. In this way, resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics can be reversed not only in the bacteria tested but in any bacterium producing these enzymes.<br><br>

COST VS. CONTAMINATION: A STUDY OF BACTERIAL COUNTS IN PERSONAL WATER BOTTLES THAT ARE USED MULTIPLE TIMES
Chelsea Whyte Carter, Myrtle Beach High School 
Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, USA

The purpose of this research was to conduct a study of bacterial contamination in water drink bottles that are used multiple times again and disinfected by different cleaning methods.<br><br> Five new water bottles were purchased and a sterilized pipette was used to take a .2 ml sample of each. Each sample was streaked on a nutrient agar petri dish and placed in an incubator. Bacterial growth was measured after forty-eight hours. The water was drunk daily from each bottle except Bottle E (Control Bottle). Different cleaning methods were used for each bottle before refilling: Bottle A-wasn’t cleaned, Bottle B-cleaned with tepid water(32C), Bottle C-cleaned with hot water(52C), Bottle D-cleaned with hot water(52C)and Clorox. These steps were followed over an eleven day period.<br><br> The data indicated that Bottle A contained the most bacteria(over 100,000 colonies)and Bottle D had the least amount of bacteria(0 colonies)after drinking and refilling. <br><br> The hypothesis stated: “If water bottles are cleaned (disinfected) using only tepid water(32C), they will have little or no bacteria. Bottles that are used over and over again without cleaning will harbor a large quantity of bacteria. The time spent to clean used water bottles before refilling them will make no difference in the risk of drinking contaminated water and ingesting harmful bacteria.” The hypothesis was correct because Bottle A, not cleaned, harbored the most bacteria. The hypothesis was incorrect because Bottle D, cleaned using a hot water (52°C)and ten percent Clorox solution, produced the least amount of bacteria. Cleaning did make a difference.<br><br>

THE ANTIMICROBIAL PROPERTIES OF HUMAN MILK: A FOURTH YEAR STUDY
Todd James Blumberg, Plano Senior High School
Plano, Texas, USA

Many premature infants are born with underdeveloped immune systems. Coupled with an immature digestive tract and the lack of a highly acidic stomach, pre-term infants are at a higher risk of infection. However, recent research has suggested that immune-like properties in human milk may help put premature babies at a lower risk for developing infection. <br><br> The problem being addressed in this study is to see if pasteurized human milk is as effective as non-pasteurized milk at inhibiting the growth of the bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and the yeast Candida albicans. In addition, will new infant formulas that contain DHA and ARA fatty acids naturally present in human milk inhibit the growth of these microbes? <br><br> A hypothesis is made that both pasteurized and non-pasteurized milk samples will significantly inhibit the growth of all of the microorganisms being tested. In addition, it is hypothesized that the formulas will not inhibit the growth of these microbes. <br><br> The data strongly supported the hypothesis. Eleven non-pasteurized human milk samples and five pasteurized human milk samples were obtained for testing from a milk bank. The non-pasteurized milk significantly inhibited the growth of Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphyloccus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The pasteurized milk samples did show a similar effect, but the only microbe that was significantly inhibited by all of the pasteurized milk samples was Klebsiella pneumoniae. In addition, the data showed that the infant formulas containing DHA and ARA fatty acids did not inhibit the growth of the microorganisms. <br><br>

BORDER HEALTH: ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE IN SALSA
Estevan Miguel Martinez
United High School, Laredo, Texas, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to see if there was any correlation between antibiotic resistance in bacteria and proximity to the Mexican border. As you may know, Mexico has lower standards regarding prescription medication and they are often abused in many cases. The more antibiotics a bacteria strain can get resistant to, the harder it will be to kill.<br><br> Procedure is as follows, use a sterile inoculating loop and dip it in a salsa and streak it across the agar in a petri dish then incubate for 24 hours. Perform two isolation streaks, each incubated for one day. Next, Inoculate a broth culture and incubate for 24 hours. Last, create a lawn with the broth and apply twelve antibiotic disks, incubate for 24 hours. After incubation, observe the plates, record data, and measure zones of inhibition. <br><br> The results came back supporting my hypothesis. The border areas had a greater number of antibiotics that a strain was resistant to. In my second year study, every strain was resistant to Penicillin. This was not a surprise because penicillin is one of the most prescribed and oldest antibiotics on the market. <br><br> High amounts of medicine in human bodies in border areas might have been why they so were resistant. In these areas, it is very easy to go to Mexico and buy medication, no questions asked. Slowly, bacteria in this region are getting more and more resistant.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF THREE TYPES OF MULCHES ON SOIL DWELLING BACTERIA IN A PEACH ORCHARD IN WESTERN COLORADO
Kayla Leigh Zimmerman
Hotchkiss High School, Hotchkiss, CO, USA

The goal of this project is to examine the effects of landscape cloth and two different green manure's (alfalfa and grass) on soil dwelling bacteria populations. Landscape cloth is used by some fruit growers to control weeds in the tree row. However, landscape cloth may prevent the introduction of organic matter and nutrients into the soil. Low organic matter can result in low bacterial populations. Bacteria play an important role in converting nutrients locked up in organic matter into a form usable by plants. Bacterial populations were measured at the first of each month from April through September for a total of six sample dates. Bacteria populations were evaluated in the laboratory. Bacteria colony plate counts were converted to bacteria colony forming units. The colony forming units for each treatment were compared for significant difference on the same sampling date and over the six sampling dates. There were no significant differences in the number of colony forming units between the three treatments and control. There were also no significant differences in the number of colony forming units between all sampling dates. One reason there were no differences, may be due to the fact that the trees had only been planted for two years. Also, there were a wide range in the numbers of colony forming units among all soil samples. The soil is a very large mass. In order to make changes in soil fauna, i.e. bacteria, large amounts of organic matter may need to be applied over the course of several years.

ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANT BACTERIA FOUND ON FOMITES IN A HOSPITAL SETTING A CONTROLLED STUDY
Sarah Margaret Kezar
The Altamont School, Birmingham, Alabama, United States

The purpose of this experiment was to observe the incidence of bacterial contamination and antibiotic resistance on fomites (inanimate objects which can harbor microorganisms) in a hospital setting compared to a control setting. Cultures were takes from three fomites at three locations in a hospital and one control location weekly for three weeks. The cultures were streaked onto LB agar plates and incubated. Gram stains were performed. The bacteria were placed into LB broth and then transferred onto another plate. Oxacillin, erythromycin, and tetracycline disks were placed on the plates, then incubated and growth was observed. Results showed that the rates of bacterial contamination were less in the hospital than control, with the OR showing the least contamination. Resistance to oxacillin was high in all cultures: ICU 93%, OR 80%, 4th floor 78%, and control 79%. Resistance to erythromycin and tetracycline was higher in the hospital than control. None of the bacteria cultured in the ICU were sensitive to all three antibiotics, compared to 21% in the 4th floor unit, 20% in the OR, and 21% of controls. The ICU and nursing unit had higher rates of multi-drug resistant bacteria than the OR and control.. These experiments confirmed the high rates of bacterial contamination of fomites in the hospital and control, with the lowest rates seen in the OR. This points out the need for continued vigorous efforts at cleaning and sterilization of inanimate objects which can spread microorganisms.

Hankinson, North Dakota, USA

PURPOSE: To assess the effects of natural products on various microorganisms and varieties of meat as preservational agents.<br><br>PROCEDURE: Collected four natural products and three chemical preservatives. The solutions were created by combining ten parts water to one part natural product or chemical. Meat Contamination Method: Analyze the bacteria content on varieties of meat from four different geographic locations. Sensitivity Method: Determine the effects of natural products and chemicals on the growth rate of various microorganisms. Ethanol Extraction Method: Extract a possible killing agent from the natural products that could possibly increase their inhibitory properties. Preservation Colonization Method: Test the products’ preserving abilities over a sustained period of time. Vacuum Seal Preservation Method: Investigate the preserving ability of the products while in a sealed environment.<br><br>RESULTS: The Meat Contamination Method showed beef having the least amount of microorganisms. The Sensitivity Method proved Goldenseal Root did the best job inhibiting the growth of microorganisms. Goldenseal Root was the best overall product in the Ethanol Extraction Method. In the Preservation Colonization Method, Cranberry preserved meat most effectively over a three-day period. Citric Acid was the top product in the Vacuum Seal Preservation Method. The best overall products were Citric Acid and Cranberry.<br><br>CONCLUSION: Overall, I feel that natural products do inhibit the growth of microorganisms. The solutions proved to preserve meat over an extended period of time, Cranberry being the most effective natural solution. In summary, I strongly believe that natural solutions can be implemented as effective natural preservatives.

PEPTIDE-DIRECTED INHIBITION OF ENDOTOXIN LPS-INDUCED PRO-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINE EXPRESSION IN RAW 264.7 CELLS
Yiliu Chen, University School of Nashville
Nashville, TN United States of America

Endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a component of the outer membrane of gram negative bacteria and a contributor to the majority of septic shock cases. LPS mainly targets macrophages. Through the action of transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B), LPS provokes the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6, which ultimately lead to septic shock. NF-kappa B plays a critical role in this pathway. The experiment that I conducted was to use SN50 and cSN50, two peptides containing a cell-permeable motif and a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) designed to be the same as that of NF-kappa B, as inhibitors by blocking the signaling pathway of NF-kappa B, to suppress LPS-induced cytokine production. First, I detected the peptide's intracellular location by direct fluorescence microscopy to verify that the peptide is imported into cells. Then, I measured the cytokine expressions of RAW 264.7 cells, a murine macrophage cell line, challenged with LPS by ELISA. I found that (1) Cell-permeable peptide can be delivered into the intact cells. (2) The production of cytokine levels increased as the concentrations of LPS rose. (3) The expressions of cytokine levels were suppressed by functional cSN50 and SN50 peptides but not by the mutant peptide SM, which was used as the negative control. These findings demonstrate that inhibition of the NF-kappa B nuclear import by peptides is able to suppress the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine in macrophage cells challenged with LPS. This finding may provide some fundamental knowledge for treatment of septic shock.

ANALYSIS OF DAUER FORMATION IN VARIOUS CAENORHADITIS SPECIES
Shirley Phan
Alhambra High School, Alhambra, CA, USA

Under normal conditions, the nematode Caenorhabditis brigsae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Caenorhabditis remanei, PS1010 and CB5161's (all Caenorhabditis species) life cycles consist of four stages: L1-L4. However, when faced with adverse conditions, the juvenile worms respond by undergoing an alternative pathway to form dauers, a developmentally arrested third larvae stage capable of surviving for a period of six months without feeding until conditions become favorable. Mutations that affect the dauer formation process cause worms to either form dauers even when conditions are favorabe, known as dauer constitutive mutants (Daf-c), or to lack the competence to form dauers, known as dauer defective mutants (Daf-d). The focus of the project is to discover the molecular componets underlying the evolutionary changes in development, physiology and behavior. Research in my previous projet demonstrated that the Daf-13 gene in Caenorhabditis briggsae is not X-linked,whereas in Caenorhabditis elegans it is, thus losing one of its evolutionary trait. Analysis in this year's experiment concludes that diverging Caenorhabditis species of ancestral specie Caenorhabditis elegans exhibit hyperduction, which causes an increase in dauer formation as the temperature increases. Further analysis of the Daf-7 promoter gene, responsibe for making Daf-7 protein, which can either induce or inhibit dauer formation reveals that diverging Caenorhabditis species has higher production of Daf-7 compared to that of ancestor specie Caenorhabditis elegans. In conclusion, the results obtained signify that through the process of evolution, divergiing Caenorhabditis species has lost some its traits while at the same time gaining new traits.

STACHYBOTRYS: ENVIROMENTAL PATHOGENIC MOLD
Davis Marshall Catlin
Episcopal High School, Jacksonville Florida, USA

Stachybotrys is a potentially deadly environmental mold. Stachybotrys produces airborne spores, which carry more than twenty identified human mycotoxins. Very little is known about its effects on other species. It has been shown that the spores of Stachybotrys can harm a complex lung (i.e. human), but many smaller species have spiracles and air sacs not lungs, and so they might not be affected at all. This experiment was designed to test the effect of Stachybotrys on species with other mechanisms of respiration. The rationale for choosing each species is the environment in which they live, and the way in which they might encounter Stachybotrys. The procedure involved placing Stachybotrys direcetly into the environment in which the species live. Each day, for 28 days, the viability of the remaining organisms was determined, and a comparison between the two viability rates was made. The data indicated that Stachybotrys does have a statistically significant (in terms of life expectancy) impact on the mortality rates of Acheta domesticus, Daphnia magna, and Tribolium confusium; with the average mortality rate being 71.9%, 70.8%, and 57.9% with Stachybotrys present, and less than 10% in the three separate controls.

ISOLATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF ENTEROBACTER SAKAZAKII FROM POWDERED INFANT FORMULA
Mallary Elizabeth Hodges
Gleason School, Gleason,Tennessee, United States

This project was the result of experimentation to determine whether Enterobacter sakazakii bacterial colonies were present in containers of powdered infant formulas before they were unsealed. 10 g were weighed out for each of the formulas: Nestle Carnation Good Start (1), Nestle Carnation Follow Up with Calcium (2), Wyeth Nutritionals Parent's Choice Formula with Iron (3), and Wyeth Nutritionals Parent's Choice Soy Formula with Iron (4). Each was added to a flask of prewarmed distilled water at a 1:10 dilution, gently shaken, and incubated overnight. Ten mL of each suspension was added to 90 mL of Enterobacteriaceae enrichment broth and incubated overnight. Each bottle was gently mixed and plated into prepared plates of Violet red bile glucose agar using the Direct Spreading Method and the Direct Streaking Method, and the plates were incubated overnight. Five presumptive colonies were selected from each of the formulas and streaked onto single prepared plates of Trypticase soy agar and incubated overnight. Presumptive colonies from the plates were selected and identified using an Oxidase test and the API 20 E biochemical identification test strips. This was repeated twice more using two more cans with different lot numbers for each of the formulas. The entire procedure was completed using the aseptic technique.<br><br> Enterobacter sakazakii was not found in any of the tests for the first three formulas and one batch of formula four, although various other strains of bacteria were present in the formulas. Two batches of formula four contained Enterobacter sakazakii colonies. Therefore, the hypothesis was supported.

EXAMINING S. CEREVISIAE MUTATIONS PHASE II: DNA DAMAGE RESPONSE & THE RELATIONSHIP TO CANCER
Katie Lynn Liberatore
Rio Rancho High School, Rio Rancho, New Mexico, USA

Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast), a eukaryotic organism, is commonly used in medical research because it is easily manipulated and its genes correspond to humans’ genes coded for identical functions. The response of the yeast cells in the following assays demonstrates how human cells with mutations in their homologous (corresponding) genes should react in the absence and presence of the same damaging agents. <br><br>This project attempts to pinpoint the function of the WTM genes by inducing DNA damage with Hydroxyurea (HU), Methyl methansulfanate (MMS), and Ionizing Radiation. The wtm mutations are also analyzed in conjunction with a mutation in the crucial MEC1 gene. The MEC1 gene is homologous to the human ATM gene, which causes the predisposition for cancer syndrome in humans. Cell cycle analysis by counting or using flow cytometry reveals any differentiation among the strains. <br><br>Statistical analysis indicates a significant difference between the wild-type and mutant strains of yeast. The most exciting and significant result is that of the mec1-21;wtmdelta1,2 mutant, a mutation that has not been significantly studied before. This result shows a significant increase of cells in the S-phase, indicating a delay in the cell cycle, which demonstrates the theorized relationship of these genes to the transcription of DNA.<br><br>By studying yeast genes, homologous to those in humans, it is possible to begin formulating better treatment methods for diseases, including cancer. <br><br>

SYNERGISTIC FUSION INHIBITORS OF HIV
Maria Gorodnitsky, Yorktown High School
Yorktown Hts., NY, USA

Despite almost twenty years of research, a cure for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) still eludes medical science. The Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 strain (HIV-1) infects via attachment to the CD4 receptor and one of two chemokine coreceptors on CD4+ lymphocytes. Once bound, HIV-1 integrates into the cellular DNA, causing the cell to ultimately produce more virus. Eventually the cell ruptures releasing infectious particles. Compounds that prevent HIV-1 from initially binding and fusing can stop the infection. Combinations of compounds can inhibit binding at levels that are greater than the sum total of inhibition caused by each compound acting individually. Humanized PRO 140 (huPRO 140), PRO 542, T-1249, and T-20 are potent inhibitors of HIV-1 mediated fusion as determined via the Resonance Energy Transfer (RET) assay. In this study, various combinations of the compounds were tested to determine if they behave synergistically in inhibiting fusion. The results show that huPRO 140, T-1249, and PRO 542 do behave highly synergistically over a broad range of conditions. The synergy observed with this combination of compounds on inhibition of HIV-1 mediated fusion offers great hope for a potentially powerful new therapy for the treatment of AIDS.

DO MARINE SPONGES PRODUCE ANTIBIOTICS?
Keriann Michelle Liberatore and Jordan Ashley Spaw, Jordan Ashley Spaw
Lincoln Park Academy, Ft. Pierce, Florida, United States

This project was performed to find out if sponge extracts that were toxic to brine shrimp would correlate with the toxicity against microorganisms that cause human diseases. We conducted this project as a continuation from our project last year. Some studies have been done on this topic before and we wanted to further our understanding and elaborate on research from the past. <br><br> This project was carried out in the Florida Keys off the coast of Key Largo. We collected sponges with the permission of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. After collecting the sponges, we sorted, labeled, identified and photographed them. Next, we cut them up in pieces and made extracts by adding ethanol. Then we tested to see if the sponges killed the pathogenic microorganisms: Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans, by putting some of each extract on filter paper discs and sticking them in our agar plates which contained the bacteria. We incubated the agar plates for twenty-four hours at 37 degrees Celsius. Twenty-four hours later we took the plates out to measure the zone of inhibition the extracts created. <br><br> Subsequent to this experiment we discovered that brine shrimp toxicity does correlate with the toxicity against human diseases. We discovered that nearly half of sponges inhibited the growth of the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, four of the 21 sponges inhibited the growth of the fungus Candida albicans, however, none of the sponges were active against the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

ALOE BARBADENSIS AND ALLIUM SATIVUM AS POSSIBLE BACTERIA INHIBITORS ON THE LIDS OF SOFT-DRINK CANS: PHASE II.
Fernando Javier Nido, Jaime Eduardo Flores
Colegio San Ignacio de Loyola, San Juan, Puerto Rico, USA

Phase I of this two-year investigation suggests that Staphylococcus aureus, the main cause of food poisoning, can be found on the lids of soft-drink cans. The sole purpose of this experiment is to use a lyophilized aqueous extract of Aloe barbadensis and an aqueous extract of Allium sativum as possible inhibitors of Staphylococcus aureus. Cans were collected again from the supermarket to look for Staphylococcus aureus. After identifying Staphylococcus aureus and other minor pathogenic bacteria, the extracts of Aloe barbadensis and Allium sativum were obtained and applied in high concentrations to the bacterium, using the Disk Diffusion Susceptibility Test. Staphylococcus aureus showed susceptibility to both extracts in these high concentrations. In the one hand, 25% was determined as the lowest concentration in which Aloe barbadensis could inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus. This supports the second hypothesis, which stated that Aloe barbadensis in high concentrations would be an effective inhibitor of the bacterium. In the other hand, Allium sativum was tested in lower concentrations against Staphylococcus aureus, to determine the lowest concentration on which it could be an effective bacteria inhibitor. Compared to positive control vancomycin, 14% of Allium sativum was determined as the lowest concentration that could inhibit Staphylococcus aureus, thereby supporting the third hypothesis, which stated that Allium sativum would be an effective inhibitor of this bacterium. As an application of this investigation, a cloth will be created containing a concentration of Allium sativum or Aloe barbadensis to clean the lid of the soft-drink cans before drinking.

PUNICA GRANATUM AND PHYLLANTUN ACIDUS EXTRACTS EFFECTS IN THE BACTERIAL GROWTH OF STAPHYLLOCOCCUS AUREUS AND ESCHERICHIA COLI
Keyla Marie Gonzalez, Rosalba Velazquez
Manuel M. Monserrate Junior High School, Santa Isabel, Puerto Rico, USA

In this research the Punica granatum peel and pulp extracts and the Phyllantus acidus pulp extract were use to verify if these extracts are effective in the bacterial growth inhibition of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus.<br><br> The Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus bacteria were cultured in specific culture media. Staphylococcus aureus in Blood agar and Escherichia coli in EMB (Eosin Methylene Blue.) These cultures were grown in a Zig Zag pattern in the specific culture media. After that, a filter paper disc (concentration disc) impregnated with the Punica granatum and Phyllantus acidus infusions were prepared. It was observed if any growth of inhibition area was present. If there was any presence of the inhibition ring it was measured. It was also determined in which of the infusions the growth of the inhibition area in the culture media of Staphylococcus aureus covers the biggest area. The same was done with the Escherichia coli.<br><br> During this investigation it was proved that the Punica granatum peel extract was the most effective in the growth inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Also it was proved that the Phyllantus acidus extracts inhibits the Escherichia coli bacterial growth. After that, different concentrations (25%, 50% and 100%)of Punica granatum extracts were prepared to determine if the dilutions were also effective in the grow inhibition of both bacteria. The greatest inhibition area was obtained from the Staphylococcus aureus treated with Punica granatum extracts. The saponine test for both extracts was positive.

COMPARATIVE STUDY BETWEEN CH3COOH (ACETIC ACID ) AND THE MELALEUCA ALTERNIFOLIA (TEA TREE OIL) INHIBITING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TINEA UNGUIUM TOE NAIL FUNGUS
Maribelis Rivera, Andrés Figueroa 
University Gardens High School, San Juan, Puerto Rico

The purpose of this study was to compare natural oil derived from Melaleuca alternifolia versus CH3COOH (acetic acid) with regards to the inhibition of Tinea unguium, a nail fungus. Two groups of five test tubes were prepared with decreasing (100%, 50%, 25%, 12.5%, and 6.25%) concentrations of each of the substances using normal saline solution as the diluents. Tinea unguium growth derived previously from patients with onycomycosis was incubated at 28 degrees for two hours with triptic soy broth.Five drops of the incubated growth were added to each of the ten solutions tubes, five from each susbtance. Subsequently five drops from each of the ten solutions tubes were placed on 20 Sabouraud angled culture media, two for each solution strength. Two control culture media containing only the incubated growth were also made for a total of 22 Sabouraud tubes. These were incubated at 28 degrees for 14 days. At the end of that period the acetic acid culture tubes fron 100% down to 12.5% yielded no organisms and the 6.25% tube had a bacteria growth. Culture tubes with M. alternifolia showed the fallowing; 100% tubes-no growth, 50% tubes - #1 no growth, #2 Aspergillus (contaminant) growth, 25%-both had Aspergillus growth, 12.5%- #1 bacterial growth, #2 bacterial plus T.unguium, and 6.25% showed scant bacterial growth in both. Surprisingly neither of the control tubes showed T.unguium growth. Results suggested that acetic acid was more effective than M. alternifolia inhibiting the growth of Tinea unguium thus contradicting our working hypothesis.<br><br>

EFFICIENCY OF POULTRY IRRADIATION
Danielle L. Butler, Rosser, Carly M. 
Hilton Head Preparatory School, Hilton Head, SC, USA 

The purpose of this experiment is to determine whether using the process of radiation on poultry helps control bacterial growth and development. It will be possible to distinguish these effects by comparing the bacterial difference in irradiated and non-irradiated poultry. The predicted outcome of this experiment is that the irradiated poultry will have less bacterial growth when compared to the non-irradiated poultry due to the sterilization methods of the irradiation process, thus making it safer for human consumption. The experiment was conducted using bacteriological techniques involving a swab test of both types of chicken. The collected bacteria were placed in an incubator set at thirty-seven degrees Celsius. At prescribed intervals colonies of bacteria were counted. The petri dishes that held bacteria from the raw chicken had an average of 18.8 colonies per dish. The petri dishes with bacteria from irradiated chicken had fewer colonies, with an average of 3.7 colonies per dish. Non-inoculated agar dishes were used as a control. <br><br> A T-Test was performed on the data. The hypotheses were as follows: the null hypothesis states the difference between the raw mean and the irradiated mean equals zero; the alternative hypothesis states the difference between the raw mean and the irradiated mean is greater than zero. The computed test statistic was T = 8.073 with a corresponding P-value of .00001029; since the P-value is less than a 1% significance level, there is strong evidence that the alternative hypothesis can be accepted. Therefore it can be deduced from this evidence that the irradiation process can be used to control bacterial growth and hinder bacterial development on poultry meant for human consumption.

THE USE OF ANTI-CANCER DRUGS IN THE TREATMENT OF MALARIA
Connie Pham
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, FL United States

Malaria, caused by Plasmodium parasites continues to be a major tropical disease killing nearly 3 million people each year. Development of parasites resistant to currently used anti-malarials demands that new treatment be developed urgently. <br><br>Post-translational modification of proteins by a farnesyl group is an important event for a number of proteins involved in diverse cellular activities. The purpose of this research is to analyze the effects of farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs) on malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. <br><br>Parasite cultures treated with various FTI inhibitors at different concentrations were collected at different time points, run on a SDS-PAGE gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Relative amounts of farnesylated proteins were quantitated using anti-farnesyl specific antibodies. Light microscopy was used to observe any morphological changes while immuno-fluoroscence was used to localize the farnesylated proteins within the parasite. The results demonstrate that, upon treatment with FTI's, the amount of farnesylated proteins is reduced, possibly affecting the cell cycle and growth. The use of potent FTI's may well be a new drug for treatment of malaria.

HERBAL REMEDIES: A BACTERIAL STUDY, YEAR 2
Barbara Kate Snowden
Pensacola High School, Pensacola, FL, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to show if herbs are capable of combating infections caused by bacteria. Barberry, chamomile, cinnamon, dill, garlic juice, garlic powder, licorice, and tea tree oil were tested on S. aureus and E. coli. <br><br> Since the previous year’s procedure yielded unsuccessful results, a different approach was taken. To carry out this experiment, 30 grams each of the dry herbs were soaked in individual lidded containers with 50 ml of 91% Isopropyl Alcohol for 24 hours. The mixtures were strained and sat without lids for 12 hours. Six sterile paper disks were placed in each of the containers, including a container each of crushed garlic cloves and 4ml tea tree oil. Suspensions of E. coli and S. aureus were made and labeled agar plates were inoculated. The herb-soaked paper disks were placed on the agar dishes, saving two plates for bacterial controls. Twenty-four hours later, results were recorded. Broth dilutions were performed with S. aureus and 3 different concentrations each of tea tree oil and garlic oil.<br><br> Garlic juice, garlic powder, and tea tree oil proved successful in inhibiting E. coli. Garlic juice, garlic powder, licorice, and tea tree oil proved successful in inhibiting S. aureus. The variations in diameter of inhibition among the experiments were most likely due to variations in amount of herb on the paper disks. There is no known explanation of the unknown bacteria colonies on Experiments 2 and 3 of E. coli with tea tree oil. However, since the tea tree oil still managed to inhibit E. coli, it is unlikely that the contaminants affected the outcome of the experiment. Bacterial controls were successful. Overall, the broth dilutions were unsuccessful because of the failure of the controls to produce consistent countable colonies. <br><br>

TAMING A FUNGAL PATHOGEN BY COMBATING ITS VIRULENCE: DISCOVERY OF NOVEL AND NATURAL - GROWTH AND PROTEASE INHIBITORS OF CANDIDA ALBICANS
Yahya Maqsood Mohammed
Niceville Senior High School, Niceville, FL, USA

Candida albicans is the fourth leading cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections with a mortality rate of 40% and claims over 5000 lives per year. HIV and AIDS patients have no other pathogen afflict them as much as Candida albicans, and it costs the country over $1 billion per year to just treat Candidemia. <br><br>Current anti-Candida drugs are toxic and also developing resistance. Recently, the proteases of Candida albicans have been identified as important pathogenicity factors and suitable targets for therapy. Clinical studies show that HIV protease inhibitors lessen the incidence of Candidiasis in HIV patients. Therefore, they are acquiring a place in mainstream anti-Candida regimens. But unfortunately, HIV protease inhibitors are also very toxic and are associated with a plethora of side effects including atherosclerosis, hypertension, and diabetes. This led me to explore anti-Candida agents from natural substances of botanical origin since they are known to have defenses against their fungal enemies. I used the Kirby Bauer and agar dilution techniques to test 8 different substances for growth and protease inhibitory effect against Candida. <br><br>My results were very rewarding. Out of the 8 natural substances tested 4 had growth inhibitory properties vs. Candida albicans and 3 of these were very significant. Out of the 8 substances tested, 4 substances exhibited protease inhibiting property. The investigation proved to be worthwhile. Safe and effective growth as well as protease inhibitors of Candida albicans have been discovered. These inhibitors are novel, natural, and safe therapeutic alternatives to the currently available regimen for Candida albicans infections. <br><br>

CHARACTERIZATION OF THE PROTEOME RESPONSE OF STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS TO IRON LIMITATION
Akash Kumar
Wayzata High School, Plymouth MN, USA

Proteins drive all biological events, but are notoriously difficult to analyze. Proteins manufactured by the prominent bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) comprise a microscopic arsenal capable of inflicting tremendous damage to the bacterium’s host, which includes humans and various species of animals. Iron has been shown to be a limiting factor during host infection by S. aureus, but interaction of the iron acquisition methods of S. aureus with its environment is not well understood. <br><br> The study’s purpose was to examine the protein expression response of S. aureus to low iron concentration and to investigate resulting changes in the morphology and growth kinetics of the bacteria. Bacteria were grown in iron-enriched and iron-deficient media. Optical density readings were taken every three hours in order to examine the bacteria’s growth kinetics. Samples of cell culture were examined under oil immersion microscope, and protein expression response was analyzed by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis. <br><br> Several proteins were found to have different responses to low iron concentration. The expression of these proteins was correlated with slower culture growth, an increase in cell size and an increase in cellular clumping during growth. This research has furthered the understanding of the iron acquisition methods of S. aureus, which lays the foundation for future drug development.<br><br>

HERBAL REMEDIES AS ANTIBIOTICS
Michael Timothy Vas
Northwestern, Kokomo, IN, United States 

The purpose of the experiment was to see if herbal medicines-agrimony, anise, and garlic-exhibited antibiotic-like properties. The test tubes were inoculated separately with the bacteria Bacillus cereus, Serratia marcescens, and E. coli and poured into a Petri dish using standard procedure. Dried sterile disks of two herb concentrations were placed on the Petri dishes of inoculated agar with five replicate samples per test. Agrimony inhibited the growth of E. coli and Serratia marcescens, but not the Bacillus cereus. The average ring of inhibition on E. coli was 5.4 mm at 1% concentration (t-test= 2.44>t 0.05= 2.306), and 9.6 mm at 5% concentration (t-test= 18.824>t 0.001= 5.041). Agrimony exhibited a stronger effect on Serratia marcescens with an average ring of inhibition of 10.6 mm at 1% concentration. The results from these agrimony tests were statistically significant (t-test= 26.5> t 0.001= 5.041). Garlic was only successful against the Bacillus cereus with highly significant results (t-test= 6.77> t 0.001= 5.041). The other herb, anise, was not successful in inhibiting bacterial growth. Anise did inhibit the bacterial coverage in the dish periodically but was not statistically significant. The results partially supported the hypothesis because agrimony and garlic could have antibiotic-like properties but the anise did not.<br><br>

COMPLEMENT DEPENDENT KILLING OF THE LYME DISEASE SPIROCHETE, BORRELIA BURGDORFERI, BY IGG BORRELIACIDAL ANTIBODIES SPECIFIC FOR OUTER SURFACE PROTEIN C
Carrie Calkins Rethlefsen
Winona Senior High School, Winona MN, USA

BACKGROUND: Borrelia burgdorferi is the bacterium that causes Lyme disease infection in humans transmitted from the deer tick. Determining the role that complement plays in the killing of B. burgdorferi will help to determine important immunological factors that will lead to advanced detection and vaccination procedures for Lyme disease. <br><br> METHODS: Immunoglobulin G (IgG) was purified from human serum that contained borreliacidal antibodies that are specific for outer surface protein C (OspC). The IgG borreliacidal antibodies were serially diluted from 1:80 to 1:40960 with and without complement added. Acridine orange was added to the samples to shine fluorescent. The samples were tested by a flow cytometer, which monitored the fluorescence intensity of the blebbed spirochete from the acridine orange. EGTA was added to samples after complement testing occurred to determine whether classical or alternative pathway activity from the complement cascade occurred. <br><br> RESULTS: The results show that without complement added to the IgG borreliacidal antibodies the titer was >80 versus a titer of >5120 with complement added. These results show that IgG borreliacidal antibodies are complement dependent. The results of the EGTA treated samples had a titer of >80 versus a titer of >320 without EGTA. These results lead to the conclusion that IgG borreliacidal antibodies are complement dependent via the classical pathway.

HOW CELLS COPE WITH STRESS: GENETIC DETERMINANTS OF HEAT SHOCK INDUCED GENE TRANSCRIPTION
Beth Cristol Zweig
Caddo Parish Magnet High School, Shreveport, LA USA

My project goal is to use a genetic approach to identify cellular determinants that contribute to the ability of the cell to survive stressful conditions. Specifically, I am concerned with the cell's initial response to stress that takes place in the nucleus - namely, the transcriptional activation of "heat shock" genes. A universal feature of how cells cope with stress is the involvement of a nuclear protein called Heat Shock Factor (HSF), evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans. HSF senses stress and switches on heat shock genes by binding to their promoter regions. In my project, I have constructed 11 genetically unique yeast strains through use of a microscope and micromanipulator to examine the role of additional genes that may team up with HSF in transcriptionally activating heat shock genes. My approach has been to use a colorimetric assay to measure the transcription of a customized reporter gene, "hsp82-lacZ," under both control and stressful conditions. Of the five protein complexes that I have examined, I found that one, Set1, is absolutely crucial for HSF-mediated transcription under nonstressful conditions, whereas a second, SAGA, is important under heat shock conditions. The other three - Swi/Snf, NuA3 and Paf1 - quite surprisingly, appear to play little or no role.

A CHROMATOGRAPHIC CONSTITUENCY ANALYSIS OF THE ETHANOLICALLY EXTRACTED COMPOUNDS OF RAW TEXAN PROPOLIS AND THEIR ANTIMICROBIAL EFFECTS
Richard Joseph Romeo
MacArthur High School, San Antonio, Texas, United States of America

Propolis, a resinous hive product of bees used to solidify and fortify their hives, has been proposed to contain many antimicrobial substances. Does propolis contain these antibacterial compounds? How can this bacteriostatic or bactericidal capability be quantified?<br><br> This year’s research encompassed the purification of newly obtained Texan propolis through the use of ethanolic extraction, decantation, vacuum filtration, simple distillation, and steam bath vaporization; a resultant 60. % solvent (EtOH) recovery and 71.1% extract recovery was found in this effective treatment. It also involved a modified version of the Kirby-Bauer method for confluent growth to test the effectiveness of the raw Texan propolis and the ethanolic extracts of propolis on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus; the results saw ineffectiveness of the raw Texan propolis on both bacteria and inhibitory response from the use of the purified extracts on both bacteria. The maximum inhibitory response was seen versus S. aureus with a maximum zone of inhibition of 12.1 mm. This year’s research also involved the use of GC/MS and FT-IR spectroscopy to identify the mainly phenolic composition of the Texan propolis and the mostly hydrocarbon (except for pinocembrin) composition of the Chilean propolis used last year. A GC/MS pinocembrin standard calibration curve was used to determine the concentration of pinocembrin in the Chilean propolis cream (251.359µg/ml). GLO parasite genetic transformation was attempted using various concentrations of ampicillin and L-arabinose in order to insert the pGLO plasmid into both E. coli and S. aureus to aid in further studies. Analyses were performed.

DETERMINING THE POTENTIAL FOR NICOTINE AS A BACTERIAL DISINFECTANT
Emily Ann Johnson
Greybull High School Greybull, WY USA

Nicotine is a liquid alkaloid that is naturally occurring. It is found in the leaves of the tobacco plant, Nicotiana tabacum. Nicotine is made up of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen. These three chemicals have powerful effects on the human body.<br><br> Nicotine has a very adverse effect on the human cells. It can kill brain cells and prevent new ones from forming in the hippocampus. The hippocampus is the region of the brain involved with memory. Nicotine may have the same destructive effects on bacteria.<br><br> Nicotine has many bad effects on the human body, but what effect could it have on bacteria? Could nicotine be used as a potent killer of bacteria? The purpose of this project is to determine the efficiency of nicotine to be used as a bacterial disinfectant.<br><br> Nicotine was diluted with distilled water into five strengths: 100%, 80%, 60%, 40%, 20% and put into vials. Six sterile paper disks were placed into each of the nicotine solution vials. Disks were placed on the plates of Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus. Areas of inhibition around each disk were measured. This data was recorded and graphed. The experimentation was repeated twice for verification.<br><br> Measurements of inhibition zones for Escherichia coli show that nicotine has a significant effect on the growth and development of the bacteria. The most significant effect occurred at 80%. As for Micrococcus luteus, inhibition levels were larger than those of Escherichia coli, although values for individual concentrations were not consistent. The largest amounts of inhibition were at 60%, 80%, and 100%.<br><br> Based on results achieved, it was shown that nicotine would indeed work well as a bacterial disinfectant for inanimate surfaces. The strength recommended for best results would be 80% nicotine.

IDENTIFICATION OF DRUG TARGETS IN MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS USING PHYLOGENOMIC PROFILING
Nimish Shukla
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Alexandria, VA, USA

The microbe Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes the deadly disease Tuberculosis. Current methods of combating Tuberculosis include treatment with antibiotics that target specific metabolic pathways that are essential for the growth of the organism. The emergence of new multi-drug resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis however, has hindered the eradication of the disease. In order to compensate for emerging resistances, new pathways and enzymes need to be discovered that can be potential drug targets.<br><br> Current drug discovery methods are expensive and time consuming. Thus, it will be beneficial to find a new cheap and efficient protocol for the discovery of potential drug targets. Phylogenomic Profiling is a relatively new method used in predicting functions of uncharacterized genes based on the assumption that genes that are functionally similar or functionally related have distribution patterns that are similar across all organisms containing those functions. Therefore it was hypothesized that this method would be effective in finding new genes because it is function rather than homology based and it may provide non-obvious links between genes. <br><br> Two genes were identified that have recently been identified as new drug targets, validating the use of this method for determining new drug targets. Two genes were identified that are involved in the synthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate, an intermediate in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids and cholesterol. Isoprenoids have been shown to be necessary for the growth of M. tuberculosis and cholesterol has been shown to be essential for infection of humans. Therefore, these two enzymes are possible drug targets.<br><br>

BIOACTIVITY OF CRUDE PRODIGIOSIN EXTRACT FROM SERRATIA MARCESCENS
Anna Kristina Buenaventura Bautista
Philippine Science High School-Main, Quezon City, Philippines

Serratia marcescens is a common pathogenic microbe with a distinctive red color caused by the presence of a non-polar pigment called prodigiosin. Prodigiosin has been found to have cytotoxic, antimicrobial and immunosuppresant activity.<br><br>In this project, a crude extract of a local culture of S. marcescens, strain 1357, was obtained using methanol, hexane and chloroform. The solvents were evaporated and the resulting extracts were partially characterized using thin-layer chromatography.<br><br>The extracts were tested for antimicrobial activity using TLC overlay assay with Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600. Hexane extract had greater activity while chloroform extract had slight activity. All extracts were also tested using an antimicrobial activity assay with S. aureus. The hexane extract was confirmed to have antimicrobial activity, but only slight activity was observed. <br><br>The extracts were submitted for cytotoxic screening. Hexane extract was found to be active against the MCF7 cancer cell line, which is a breast cancer cell line, and was more toxic than Doxorubicin while chloroform and methanol extracts were not active. <br><br>The hexane extract has more potential to be developed into an anti-cancer drug. Carbon utilization tests were also performed to provide additional carbon sources for further optimization of culture and prodigiosin production in succeeding studies.<br><br>

UV STIMULATED PUC19 TRANSFORMED INTO DH5-ALPHA CELLS AND THE CORRELATION TO HUMAN SKIN CANCER
Christine Maria Persampieri
Brewster High School, Brewster, NY USA

A transformation is the process by which a bacterium acquires a plasmid and gains certain genetic characteristics; however, this process can be disrupted by exposure to ultraviolet radiation. By transforming DH5-alpha cells with plasmid pUC19, which has been exposed to 365 nm of ultraviolet radiation A rays, data obtained can be extrapolated to understand skin cancer. The purpose was to determine the natural rate of mutation of the lacZ gene in pUC19 transformed DH5-alpha cells, through blue/white screening. The bla(APR) section of the plasmid was investigated for mutations in the beta-galactosidase protein, without affecting ampicillin resistance. The natural mutation rate of .0123% allowed comparison to the theoretical value of .0033%. This strain of E.coli colonies was transformed with pUC19, which had been exposed to increments of the 365 nm of radiation ranging from .5 minutes to 30 minutes. After differentiating between mutant and non-mutant colonies through blue/white screening, mutant colonies were sequenced to detect how specific exposure times of UVA radiation modified the DNA. While exposure less than 10 minutes yielded no mutants, plates with exposure lengths exceeding the threshold level of 19 minutes, made a rate of mutation incalculable. At times greater than 19 minutes, the ampicillin resistant gene was mutated so that there were 30% less colonies present as compared to the natural pUC19 transformation. Radiation not only mutated the beta-galactosidase protein, but also interfered with the ability of DH5-alpha cells to become ampicillin resistant. These outcomes due to UVA radiation can shed insight into human responses.

ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANT COLIFORM BACTERIA FROM FECES OF FREE-RANGE AND COMMERCIALLY RAISED CHICKEN
Charles Daniel Murin
Oak Grove High School, Hattiesburg Mississippi, United States of America

Antibiotic resistant bacteria are a problem that has become more apparent over the recent years. While the origins of antibiotic resistant bacteria are unknown, there is strong evidence between the sub-therapeutic use of antibiotics in agricultural feeds and the emergence of coliform bacteria that are resistant to those antibiotics.<br><br><br><br><br>In this study, 276 bacterial clones from chicken raised in commercial henhouses and 190 isolates from free-range chicken were screened for their resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline, and erythromycin. Plasmid DNA was subsequently extracted from 56 clones and examined by gel electrophoresis. Selected plasmids were used to transform a lab strain of Escherichia coli, and individual transformants were digested with restriction endonucleases to compare the resulting DNA fragment patterns with those obtained from the plasmid DNA that was used to transform E. coli. Results from this study showed that antibiotic resistance was not limited to commercially raised chicken but was widespread among free-range chicken as well. Plasmid DNA obtained from resistant bacterial isolates was capable of transferring the ampicillin resistance trait to E. coli. There was also evidence of multiple plasmids in isolates tested. <br><br>

STUDIES OF PURIFYING CULTURE SEWAGE OF DECORATIVE FISH BY FIXED PHOTOSYNTHETIC BACTERIA RHODOSPIRILLUM SP.
Rongfeng Cui
The No.6 High School of Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, PR. China

Keeping decorative fish at home becomes more and more popular nowadays. But the trouble of changing fresh water frequently and pumping oxygen continuously makes it inconvenient for people while it uses up energy and increases the family's extra expense. It was found that the PSB(photosynthetic bacteria) grew better in the lack-of-oxygen environment. The PSB can not only break down organic substances in water remarkably, but also increase the amount of dissolved oxygen. The PSB has already been used in breeding decorative fish, but what's used was the free PSB solution which would give off fishy and stenchy smell. And the oxygen, which was pumped into the fish tank day and night, would kill the PSB in a short while. What's more, the PSB dissolved in water can also be easily washed away. Therefore, the duration of purifying is shortened. Fixing PSB may solve the problem.<br><br> The paper deals with the process of using the free PSB and the fixed PSB to purify the culture sewage of decorative fish. The indexes of DO, COD and ammonia-N in the water were measured and compared. It was discovered that the fixed PSB could keep the culture sewage of decorative fish purified a longer time as well as more efficiency. The water won't give off fishy and stenchy smell. The experiment proves that the use of the fixed PSB to the culture water of decorative fish can not only save the resources of water & electricity, but also protect the environment.<br><br>

WHAT EFFECT DO PLASMIDS HAVE ON THE ABILITY OF BACTERIA TO DEVELOP AND TRANSFER TETRACYCLINE RESISTANCE?
Miriam Christine Rollason
Isabel High School, Isabel SD, USA

I tried to determine if plasmids enabled bacteria to become more resistant to antibiotics, and if plasmids enabled resistance to transfer to other bacteria species. I took petri dishes A, B, C, and D, and grew Escherichia coli strain RR1, which I obtained from Ward's Natural Science supply company, on them. In dishes A and B, E.coli RR1 was grown, and on the others E.coli with the plasmid pBR322 was grown. I placed Tetracycline in dishes B and D, and blank discs in A and D. I grew them for 5 days and then tested them for resistance. Then I started 10 new dishes, with varying E.coli from the first generation dishes. I placed blank discs in half the dishes and Tetracycline disc in the other half. I incubated them overnight and again took measurements of all the rings and transferred all the bacteria to new dishes. I did this 4 times. Then I took samples of only the E. cloacae and transferred them. I then placed Tetracycline discs in all 10 dishes. I incubated them and then took measurements of the rings. Dish D had a ring of 8mm at the end and dish N had a final ring of 14mm. I found that the plasmid-carrying E. coli was the most resistant and caused the E. cloacae to become resistant. This E. cloacae was much more resistant when it was exposed to Tetracycline constantly, than when it was only exposed to the resistant, plasmid-carrying E. coli.

COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE MICROORGANISM CONTENT OF MANDARIN ORANGES CANNED IN TWO DIFFERENT COUNTRIES
Monica del Pilar Crespo
Colegio San Antonio, San Juan, Puerto Rico

This research analyzes and compares the microorganisms in canned mandarin oranges from two countries. The cans from country #1 were expected to have higher microorganism content. <br><br>Thirty cans were bought and stored for 5 months. The cans from country #1 were from 2 different packaging lots (10 cans from each lot). The remaining 10 cans were from country #2. Tests were done with samples from each can to determine the microorganism content. Microorganisms were counted and classified.<br><br>Country #1 had the highest microorganism content average (lot 1 3.74E5 CFU/mL and lot 2 of 3.72E5 CFU/mL). The can with the highest microorganism content from lot 1 had 4.3E5 CFU/mL, and from lot 2 4.75E5 CFU/mL. The microorganism average content of country #2 was 2.52E3 CFU/mL, much lower than those of country #1. The can with most microorganisms from this country had 3.2E3 CFU/mL, and the one with the least microorganism content was 1.9E3 CFU/mL. Aerobic and anaerobic Gram + bacteria were identified and were probably Clostridium and Bacillus. Funguses were also seen in most of the cans. Aspergillus was seen in cans from country #1 and Penicillium in those from country #2.<br><br>The results show that the mandarin oranges canned in country #1 have more bacteria colonies than the ones from country #2. There is almost no difference between lots from country #1, so it was not just one contaminated lot. The difference in amount of colonies between cans from country #2 and from country #1 was significant, almost 150 times.<br><br>

TESTING IN VITRO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MALACHRA CAPITATA INHIBITING THE GROWTH OF STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS AND STREPTOCOCCUS MUTANS AND ITS INTERACTION WITH AMPICILLIN
Luis Antonio Somoza
Academia del Perpetuo Socorro, San Juan, PR

Streptococcus mutans causes dental diseases; Staphylococcus aureus causes bacterial pneumonia and other diseases. This investigation studied the effect of Malachra capitata on the growth of these bacteria and its interaction with ampicillin, hypothesizing that the plant would inhibit the growth of the bacteria and increase the effectiveness of ampicillin. <br><br> An extract of Malachra capitata was prepared, blending 28.955 g of leaves with 550 mL of distilled water. The extract prepared was considered pure (100%) and identified as dilution 1; using it, two others were made: dilution 2 was 50% pure and 50% water and dilution 3 was 25% pure and 75% water. The dilutions were placed in disks on the center of mediums containing the bacteria. Ampicillin was the positive control. Also, herb-drug interactions were observed, where ampicillin was added to each dilution. The dilutions had no effect on Staphylococcus aureus; but dilution 1 inhibited Streptococcus mutans. In all herb-drug interactions, the extract decreased ampicillin’s effectiveness, having the interactions smaller inhibition zones than ampicillin alone.<br><br> Two toothpastes were developed and tested on Streptococcus mutans; one was used as control and one as experimental. The experimental toothpaste had triturated leaves of Malachra capitata. The three experimental samples had 9 mm of inhibition; the three control samples had 6, 5, and 6 mm of inhibition. The toothpaste with Malachra capitata had larger inhibition zones, suggesting a bacteriostatic or bactericidal action. <br><br> Based on these results, polar and non-polar partitions will be extracted from Malachra capitata to identify the group with the active ingredient.<br><br>

THE ROLE OF GCN5, A CHROMATIN REMODELING GENE, IN DNA DAMAGE AND REAPIR
Aditya Denduluri
Saint Pius X, Albuquerque, NM 

This project involves investigating the role of GCN5, a chromatin remodeling gene, in the repair of DNA damaged by exposure to UV and hydroxy urea (HU). Defects in DNA damage and repair systems have been linked to the onset of various types of cancer, heart disease, and even the process of aging. Prior to experimentation, GCN5 was knocked out in a wildtype strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (done by mentor). Since GCN5 alters the chromatin context within a cell, it is hypothesized that the absence of this gene will potentially cause a distinct difference in the chromatin environment, thus affecting DNA repair. In both experiments, cell death demonstrated the extent of the damage and the failure to repair, while cell viability showed the opposite. In the first experiment, DNA damage was induced by exposing both the wildtype and "gcn5 DELTA (D)" strains to UV radiation. Varying concentrations of cells of both the wildtype and "gcn5D" strains were spotted on YPD agar plates. At both 25 joules (J) and 50 J of UV, no difference was observed between the wildtype and gcn5D strains. However, at 100 J, the haploid "gcn5D" strains experienced about 20-30% less cell growth, which indicates that the haploid strain is slightly sensitive to UV at 100 J. In the second experiment, DNA damage was induced by varying amounts of HU ranging from 25 mM to 100 mM. No significant differences in cell growth were observed between the wildtype and "gcn5D" strains. As a result, higher concentrations of HU will be used in future experiments to see if GCN5 plays a role in DNA damage caused by this reagent. Based off these results, it is concluded that GCN5 apparently plays a role in DNA damage and/or repair. Future directions involve investigating whether the effect on cell death caused by UV exposure is a result of more damage, less repair, or both.

A NOVEL APPROACH OF GENE KNOCKDOWN IN ZEBRAFISH THROUGH TARGETED MRNA CLEAVAGE
Leslie Yee Ming Beh
Raffles Junior College, Singapore

A novel approach of gene knockdown has been discovered through the <br><br>co-introduction of mismatch-forming oligonucleotides containing Locked Nucleic Acids (LNA) and the mismatch-cleaving restriction endonuclease, CEL I, into zebrafish embryos. It is hypothesized that gene knockdown occurs through TArgeted mRNA Cleavage (TARC), involving digestion of targeted mRNA by CEL I at the single-basepair mismatch in the heteroduplex formed by the LNA-DNA chimera and mRNA. In the experiments performed, the targeted gene was mitfa, which encodes a regulatory protein affecting pigment cell fate. Firstly, 63.2% of the embryos co-injected with CEL I and LNA-NT (an LNA-DNA chimera complementary to the non-transcribing strand of the mitfa gene) showed severe pigmentation loss at 55hpf, with 25.8% of them possessing pigmentless phenotypes. The pigmentation was restored in all co-injected embryos by 80hpf. Co-injection of CEL I and DNA-NT (a DNA oligonucleotide isosequential to LNA-NT) produced less pronounced pigmentation loss, while normal pigmentation was observed when either DNA-NT, LNA-NT or CEL I was injected alone. The proposed mechanism of knockdown has also been supported by tests performed in vitro by RT-PCR. Primers flanking the proposed binding site showed no amplification from mitfa mRNA treated with LNA-NT and CEL I in vitro, suggesting cleavage of the LNA-DNA/RNA heteroduplex. Irregular amplification was detected when the mRNA was treated with only LNA-NT, while amplification was unaffected by CEL I alone. In conclusion, gene knockdown through TARC presents a potential alternative to Morpholino-based knockdown, and it offers useful advantages like reduced cost and increased versatility of design. <br><br>

IDENTIFICATION OF NEW REGULATORY PROTEINS FOR TRANSCRIPTIONAL CONTROL OF KDP (K+ UPTAKE OPERON) IN SALMONELLA TYPHIMURIUM
Brenton Daniel Goodman
Jefferson High School, Lafayette IN, USA

The Kdp and Trk systems carry out the uptake of K+ in Salmonella typhimurium. Transcription of kdp is increased by two situations: K+ starvation and high Na+, but is relatively unresponsive to nonionic solutes. However, kdp transcription becomes responsive to nonionic solutes when trkA is not present. It is known that KdpD regulates kdp transcription. Our hypothesis is that there are other regulatory proteins in Salmonella that are responsible for transcriptional control of kdp.<br><br> A wild type strain of Salmonella was subjected to different concentrations of sucrose and NaCl to examine the effects of low K+ on Salmonella’s response to high osmolarity. The level of kdp transcription was measured as the expression of a kdp-lacZ fusion. We obtained mutations that changed the regulation of expression of the kdp operon. The location of the mutations was probed by genetic mapping. Mutants were then subjected to a complementation by a gene bank from the wild type strain to identify derivatives in which normal regulation of kdp was restored.<br><br> The results show that kdp transcription can be induced by sucrose at very low levels of K+, providing one possible explanation for the increased transcription seen in the trkA- mutant. Data from the mutant isolations showed that mutations unlinked to kdp and trkA can cause increased kdp transcription, therefore supporting our hypothesis that there are regulatory proteins other than KdpD that control kdp transcription. Further experimentation will involve determining the exact location of mutations responsible for kdp transcription.<br><br>

THE PRESENCE OF PATHOGENIC BACTERIA IN ONE DOLLAR BILLS
Janelyn Marie Vega
Eva Y Patria Custodio, Las Marias, Puerto Rico

The purpose of this study is to investigate the bacteria found in $1.00 bills. This denomination was selected because it circulates the most among the population. The hypothesis that was formulated was that the one dollar bills that circulate in the various establishments in Las Marías have pathogenic bacteria. Five local establishments were selected: a financial institution, a small store that also has a bar, a supermarket, a liquor store, and a dollar bill was also obtained from a transaction in the street. The bills were obtained using a pair of tweezers. They were then placed in bags for the transport of laboratory samples and identified accordingly and taken to a laboratory where culture samples were obtained using transport swabs. The transport swabs were sent to a specialized laboratory for the identification of potential pathogenic bacteria. Among the findings, the bacteria of the genus Bacillus was present in all the five bills, although the species was not identified in some cases. In addition, the bacteria "Bacillus cereus" was positively identified in three of the bills. Species of the genus "Staphylococcus" were present in the dollar bill that was obtained from the street transaction. Thus, it can be concluded that the exchange of bills also involves exchanging bacteria, some of which could potentially pose a health risk for humans. These results can also be compared to findings from similar studies. Even though it was not proven conclusively that the exchange of currency is a potential epidemiological threat, the fact that it is a possibility should not be taken lightly with the dangers of bioterrorism and the development of strange diseases. <br><br>

SYZYGIUM AROMATICUM ''CLOVE'' AS A POSSIBLE BACTERIA GROWTH INHIBITOR PHASE II
Pedro Jose Hernandez
Lino Padron Rivera , Vaga Baja Puerto Rico

This study pretended to find out if the extract of the Syzygium aromaticum sticks had any properties or components that can inhibit bacteria growth.In this phase S.aureus ATCC # 25923 and S.aureus ATCC # 29213 bacteria were used.The hypothesis was if the sticks of Syzygium aromaticum inhibit bacteria growth , then the extract and its dilutions are going to have better inhibition results.From the pure cloves extract different dilutions were made.At first ten grams of cloves were triturated in a sterile container with 1 mL of TSB broth to get a 1:1 dilution.Then serial dilutions from it were made to obtain 1:2,1:3,1:4,1:5 dilutions.Twelve labeled plates of Meuellr Hinton Agar were inoculated with S.aureus ATCC # 25923 and S.aureus # 29213.Two other plates were labeled as positive controls.Than 3 disks were aded to each Mueller HInton plate with the respective dilution of the extract which was already contained in each disk.In addition , sensitive test disks were performed by using Ampicillin , Oxacillin , Nafcillin and Azithromycin in the microorganism named above to compare the inihibition halo with the Syzygium aromaticum extract.Then , the inihibition halo was measured with zone reader equipment.Results were registered in tables and graphs.The extract of Syzygium aromaticum demonstrated to be a better growth inhibitor in both bacteria.Dilution 1:1 demostrated the best results.In the future the same procedure with active ingredients of cloves will be repeated to determine microbial activity.

BACTERIOPHAGE SUPPRESSION OF BIOTERRORISM AGENTS: A MODEL SYSTEM
Karli E. Oberg
Weber High School, Pleasant View, Utah, USA

A growing threat in today's world is the use of deadly bacteria as a weapon. One possible intervention to this ongoing threat is the use of bacteriophage to inhibit these organisms before they infect humans. In this project, E. coli T7 phage with host strain E. coli B was used as a model system to test the effectiveness of phage suppression against infected aerosols and liquids. Prepared phage T7 lysates had a titer of 23 billion per ml. Phage suppression was tested in two formats, a liquid medium mimicking water contamination and an aerosol chamber as an air dispersion model. After 60 minutes of phage exposure in the liquid model, a 5-fold reduction occurred when the ratio of phage to bacteria (P:B) was 5:1. No reduction was noted when the ratio was 1:1 after 60 minutes. If the exposure time was increased to 120 minutes then a 10-fold reduction from 2,460,000 to 280,000 CFU/ml was observed if the P:B ratio was 5:1. When phage and bacteria were tested in aerosol chamber the total reduction of bacteria was nearly 100%, from over 12,000 CFU on an exposed plate to less than 20 CFU per plate following phage exposure for only 10 minutes. In subsequent trials, residual phage appeared on the control plates indicating a hold over effect. The T7 phage was successful in inhibiting the bacterial strain E. coli B in both settings: the aerosol chamber and the liquid model. Results indicate that it was easier for the phage to come in contact with the bacteria in the aerosol application versus in a liquid medium. These experiments suggest the possibility of phage suppression as a means of neutralizing bacterial agents especially in settings where aerosol dispersion is a possibility. <br><br> <br><br>

-PETS- THE SECRETS WITHIN
Julia Ann Harden
Spring Creek High School, Spring Creek, Nevada, U.S.A

This is a continuation project of who has more bacteria in their mouths, cats or dogs. The final goal is to determine who has the worst bacteria in their mouths and what it is. I also wanted to find out if cleaning the animal’s teeth (with an animal dental wipe which takes the place of brushing their teeth) would affect the AMOUNT of bacteria that was grown on the petri dishes.<br><br> I took a sterile cotton swab and swabbed along the gums and tooth line of each of the cats and dogs. I streaked petri dishes and grew the bacteria for 2-3 days. I re-swabbed their mouths to validate the results. I also wiped the pets mouths out with the DentAcetic dental wipes for 10 days prior to swabbing their mouths for a third time. After that I swabbed their mouths and grew another set of petri dishes. I also took the previously grown plates and isolated the bacteria colonies out and grew them on new plates. I did this to try and determine how many kinds of bacteria I had, NOT necessarily to figure out what kinds.<br><br> After the research I determined that the average growth of bacteria for dogs was 5.5% higher than the cats. The average growth for cleansed teeth, the cats were 9% higher. This concluded that the dogs had more bacteria in their mouths when they were not cleansed, but when cleansed, the dogs bacteria level went down.<br><br>

ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY OF THE ENZYME KNOWN AS ALLICIN PRESENT IN ALLIUM SATIVUM AGAINST THE BACTERIAS: S. AUREUS AND E. COLI
Evelyn Carcano
Jose A. Castillo, Sabana Grande, Puerto Rico

This investigation was directed to prove the antimicrobial action of the enzyme allicin over human normal flora bacteria: S. aureus and E. coli (strain k12). How does this enzyme inhibit the bacterial growth?, was the primary concern of the study.<br><br>Basically the methodology used include broth cultures, sensibility tests with different concentrations of garlic extract, allicin and penicillin. Spectrophotometer tests were also done to determine the effects of each antibiotic mentioned above, in order to find the effects over the bacterial growth curves. Then a microscopic test was done with living bacteria to find out which is the effect of the enzyme over the structure and morphology of the specimens. Infrared chemical analysis were performed to extracts to determine garlic’s chemical components.<br><br>Both bacteria showed inhibition zones, with garlic bulbs with an effectivity of 100%. The arithmetic media for S. aureus were: 3.02, 2.94, 2.83; then for E. coil were: 2.30, 2.30 and 2.32 centimeters respectively. Allicin presented bigger inhibition zones comparable to the penicillin ones. The bacteria growth curves were affected by each of the antibiotic used including the garlic: the higher the concentration used the higher the effectiveness. Microscopic tests demonstrated that the enzyme allicin destroyed the cellular wall of each bacteria.<br><br>In conclusion, the allicin can be used as an excellent natural antibiotic against normal flora bacteria that cause intoxication by contaminated food and other infections.<br><br>

Instituto Nuestra. Señora de los Angeles - Concordia - Entre Rios - Argentina

The objective of this research was the study of the short wave UV-radiations as a method of sterilization of orange juice.<br><br>Citric juices are nutritionally very appreciated because of its heigh vitamin content. However their principal disadvantage is the vulnerability of those vitamins to the industrial temperatures at which they pasteurised. To solve this problem a UV-radiation system (253,7 nm) was built, with which it was possible to evaluate de influence of the rays on parameters such as microbiology of the juice, ascorbic acid, enzymatic activity, acidity, pH, reducers sugars and soluble solids from the juice.<br><br>In a total of 12 experiences, different orange juice samples were irradiated for 2, 6, 10, 14 and 18 minutes.<br><br>The obtained results have shown that the microbiology composition of the juice was reduced, averagely, in 95% during the first 2 minutes of irradiation.<br><br>Acid ascorbic, as wells as enzymatic activity, pH, reducer sugars and soluble solids were not affected by UV-radiation. In the other hand, the pectolitic enzymatic activity was instable to irradiation, which could not inactivate it as it were waiting to occur.<br><br>Finally, it can be affirmed that the method of UV-radiation used was probed to be very effective, at first place, because it is a good method for the control of microorganisms, which improve the hygienic quality of the juice, and in second term, because the other parameters analysed were not modified.<br><br>

WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF PERCENT MEDIUM USED FOR INCUBATION ON HYPNOSPORE ZOOSPORULATING OF PERKINSUS MARINUS FOUND ON CRASSOSTREA VIRGINICA?
Kayla Marie Green
John Ehret High School, Marrero, La., USA

The experiment was performed to find out the effect of the amount of medium used on zoosporulation. The experimenter's purpose was to find out what would be the most effective solution of medium and seawater to study zoosporulation of Perkinsus Marinus. The experimenter tested this by incubating different isolates. Each isolate was sampled and the cell size and viability were determined. The isolates were then rinsed and suspended in solutions of varing mixtures of culture medium and seawater, which were prepared by the experimenter. The samples were again incubated. 4 ml of eac hypnospore suspension was put into the centrifuge for five minutes. The experimenter then discarded the supernatants. The samples were then mixed with 3 ml of the appropriate solution and put into well plates, by the experimenter. After incubating for one week, percentage of hypnospore zoosporulation was calculated.<br><br>The results for the P-1 isolate peaked at 3.875% with 20% medium and was lowest with 80% medium at an average of 0.75%. The GTLA-33 isolate peaked at a low 0.625% with 40% medium and was lowest with 0% when 80% medium was used. The CRTP-J44 isolate was highest when 40% medium was used at 10.75% zoosporulation. The lowest two results for CRTP-J44 were 80% and 0% medium both with a result of 6.25%. From this the experimenter concluded that 40% and 20% mediums were the most efficient.

UTILIZING BACTERIAL CARPETS FOR BIONANOTECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS
Mahlet Kabtamu Woldemariam
Deming High School, Deming NM, U.S.A

The purpose of this experiment is to see if Serratia marcescens could be utilized to move 10 micrometer (µm) beads and PDMS coated chips (Polydimethylsiloxane, PDMS) through a liquid medium. S. marcescens is a pathogenic, opportunistic flagellated gram-negative bacterium best known for producing a red pigment called prodigiosin. S. marcescens is readily available and easily swarms. If this swarming characteristic could be coordinated and directed it might be utilized as a bio-robot. <br><br>The purpose of this experiment is to see if S.marcescens can be utilized to move objects in viscous fluids. It was hypothesized that the bacterial carpets would move the beads and chips faster than diffusion due to coordination of the S.marcescens flagella.<br><br>A carpet of swarming S.marcescens were blotted onto 22 mm PDMS covered glass cover slips pre treated with Rain-X ®. The cover slips were inverted and placed on a tunnel slide. 10 µm polystyrene beads (Duke Scientific) were then pipetted into the tunnel slide to quantify movement. The bacterial carpet produced rapid linear movement of the 10 µm beads. <br><br>The hypothesis was supported as the 10 µm beads next to the bacterial carpets moved at a significantly (p< 0.001) higher velocities than the control beads and the calculated diffusion rate. The bacteria were successful in moving a PDMS chip in a clockwise rotation at an average speed of 4 µm/s. This procedure indicates possible use of S.marcescens as a means to propel automobile chips which could contain biosensors. <br><br><br>

THE ANTIMICROBIAL EFFECTS OF GREEN AND BLACK TEAS
Matthew Wayne Volkman
Seneca High School, Seneca, MO, United States

Tea has always been thought of by many ancient cultures to help rid the body of illness. This experiment was developed in order to investigate this myth. The purpose of this experiment was to determine the antimicrobial effects of various types of the same brand of tea. Green, black, green decaffeinated, and black decaffeinated teas were used to test for their inhibition against the following five common microbes: Escherichia coli, Neisseria subflava, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Candida kefyr. Each microbe was grown in an appropriate sterile broth in combination with each of the various teas. Using a visible spectrophotometer, the absorbence was recorded for each of the tubes to determine each tea’s inhibitory effect after 24 hours of growth. One-way ANOVAs were performed on the absorbences and if significance (p<0.05) was found a post-hoc Tukey’s test was run to show which groups were significant. Many significant interactions were noted and these reactions varied among each microbe. Overall, green tea had the most inhibitory effect on the microbes, followed by green decaffeinated, black then black decaffeinated. These results show that the processing of the tea through fermentation and effervescence affect the ability of the teas to inhibit the microbes.

THE EFFECT OF CHLOROPHYLL REDUCTION ON BIOLUMINESCENT DINOFLAGELLATES
Peter Douglas Clark
St. Andrew’s Episcopal School, Ridgeland, MS, USA

The purpose of this project was to determine if, by varying the amount of light in an attempt to reduce chlorophyll production while at the same time providing simple sugar nutrients, the bioluminescence of Pyrocystis lunula and Pyrocystis fusiformis Dinoflagellates would be affected. It was hypothesized that varying light amounts would affect the bioluminescence of P. lunula and P. fusiformis.<br><br> 36 flasks were setup with 1 culture of P. lunula in half the flasks and 1 culture of P. fusiformis in the remaining half. Sugars were added and flasks were covered per their designation. All tests were done with 1 minute of stirring and data collection.<br><br> In all the cultures tested, the varying light levels did not significantly, yet still measurably, affect the bioluminescence of the dinoflagellates. The end means did not show any clear pattern of change. To the naked eye however, the light in the G-H-I flasks was too dim to be detected near the end of the experiment. This could be caused by the fact that lux is a measure of Illuminance and not Luminous intensity. After re-exposure to light, bioluminescence was again visible. Insignificant evidence was collected to support the theory that luciferin is derived from chlorophyll, yet this is also not ruled out. The highest integral (lux*sec) collected in a single data collection was from A4 on Day 8. This value was 254.3. The lowest integral collected was from B1 on Day 1. This value was 16.6. Overall, P. lunula had similar means while P. fusiformis had varied means.

SEARCHING FOR A MECHANISM FOR ACTIVATING 2,4-D DEGRADATION IN SOIL BACTERIA TFT39, TFT5, K19: A COMPARATIVE PROMOTER STUDY
Rohini Shantharam
Clovis West, Fresno, California, United States

2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid is a recalcitrant xenobiotic herbicide widely used as broad-leaf weed control for cereal crop production. The toxin has been accumulating in our soil thus increasing likelihood of health risks associated with its exposure. Studies have shown that the plasmid pJP4 from Ralstonia eutropha and Burkholderia spp. have evolved metabolic pathways to use 2,4-D as its soul carbon and energy source. <br><br>The main objective of this new approach is to test the promoters from JMP134 and RASC in various 2,4-D degrading bacterial soil strains to identify which promoter influences most enzyme activity. Prior to beginning research it was hypothesized that each promoter in each soil strain would show similar enzyme activity. <br><br>The experiment used E. coli containing plasmids with a variety of tfd promoters for the lacZ gene coding for beta-galactosidase. A quantifiable beta-galactosidase expression would be helpful for a better determination of promoter suitability. The experiment included mating, through conjugation, the E. coli containing cloned promoter regions from strain JMP134 and RASC with three different soil bacteria. Following this beta-galactosidase assays were performed to quantify gene expression. Finally, DNA extraction and gel electrophoresis were run for further assurance of the plasmid in the soil strain. <br><br>Results indicated that promoter pMD96 showed comparatively higher enzyme activity in both of the tested soil strains. This suggests that perhaps this promoter contains regulatory elements superior to the others. Understanding these gene regulatory mechanisms now will permit upcoming attempts at engineering toxin degrading regulatory and structural genes. <br><br>

THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ADENOVIRAL VECTOR THAT EXPRESSES PNC-28EG, A GENE THAT ENCODES A PEPTIDE SELECTIVELY CYTOTOXIC TO PANCREATIC CARCINOMA
Mou Chung Ng
Midwood High School, Brooklyn, NY, USA

The peptide, PNC-28, resembling the mdm-2 binding domain of p53, has shown selective cytotoxicity towards numerous carcinoma cell lines and induced rapid necrosis in several different tumors including pancreatic cancer cells. This study investigates the use of adenoviruses as an efficient delivery system of this peptide, in vitro and well as in vitro. Adenovirus is a widely studied vector for cancer gene therapy because of its high infection efficiency and capacity for transgene expression in both dividing and non-dividing cells. Since the utility of adenoviruses is usually limited by their lack of specificity the use of PNC-28EG as a selectively cytotoxic therapeutic gene eliminates this problem.<br><br> Here the development of an adenoviral vector containing PNC-28EG as the therapeutic gene is reported. The adenoviral vector construction was based on a two-plasmid system; a gateway vector and a destination vector which contained modified adenoviral genome. The gene coding for PNC-28 (PNC-28EG) was cloned into the gateway vector and through a lambda recombination reaction subsequently cloned into the destination vector. The constructed adenoviral vector was then successfully tested on Pancreatic Carcinoma cells BMRPA1.TUC3 with 98% of the tested cells killed.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF QUINOLONES ON GRAM-POSITIVE BACTERIAL RESISTANCE PATTERNS
Trina Chakravarty
The Bolles School, Jacksonville FL, USA

This report indicates the presence of fluoroquinolone-nonsusceptible pneumococci in the United States. Drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (DRSP) poses a growing threat to people in places where they live and work, as infections caused by this bacteria—including pneumonia, sinusitis, and meningitis—are among the leading causes of death and illness among the elderly, children and persons with underlying medical conditions. DRSP often strikes patient populations in daycare settings, nursing homes and prisons. Resistance to penicillin, the most common agent used to treat S. pneumoniae, now approaches 40%. This experiment was conducted in an effort to uncover whether penicillin susceptible, intermediate or resistant strains of S. pneumoniae show differences in acquiring resistance towards newer fluoroquinolonian antibiotics. <br><br> This experiment was conducted by isolating three strains of penicillin susceptible, intermediate and resistant S. pneumoniae cultures and exposing them to the fluoroquinolones, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin over ten days. At the end of the experiment, it was discovered that S. pneumoniae became resistant to fluoroquinolones regardless of its previous resistance towards penicillin. <br><br> Having one of the highest levels of antibiotic-resistant pneumococcal resistance in the world, pneumococcal isolates not susceptible to penicillin first appeared in Taiwan in 1986 and in 1995 an increase in the prevalence of nonsusceptibility to penicillins and extended-spectrum cephaloporins were brought to attention and now the persistence of high antibiotic selective pressure in the community. The international spread of this epidemic has substantially contributed to the crisis of resistance<br><br>

THE VCE MDR PUMP: PHASE TWO REGULATION OF THE VCE OPERON IN V. CHOLERAE
Amanda Dyann Dugan 
Rockdale Magnet School for Science and Technology, Conyers, Georgia, USA 

The emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance have sharply reduced the effectiveness of available antibiotics. The most efficient method of resistance is the multidrug resistance (MDR) pump through which microorganisms expel a wide variety of compounds. Previous experimentation described an MDR pump, VCE (Vibrio cholerae efflux). This research examines the regulation of the oepX-vceAB (vce) operon by the compounds expelled by the OepX-VceAB (VCE) pump and the role of the VCE MDR pump in providing antibiotic resistance and contributing to the pathogenesis of Vibrio cholerae. The main research hypothesis tested was: If compounds expelled by the VCE pump are added to V. cholerae 569B with the vce-luxAB fusion then the chemical will induce transcription of the vce operon which encodes proteins of the VCE pump. Additionally, this study developed a static growth induction model for V. cholerae. The role of the compounds was examined using an oepX-luxAB fusion plasmid, pXAP56. V. cholerae 569B/pXAP56 was exposed to a range of chemicals to determine their effect on vce transcription by measuring the Alkaline Phosphatase activity. Minimum inhibitory concentrations and exposure times were also examined. Enhanced expression in nalidixic acid and acetyl salicylic acid induced cultures appears as early as four hours. This positive regulation shows possibility of negative regulation, thus a transcription inhibitor. Results indicate that induction level of vce expression in V. cholerae varies by compound, concentration, length of exposure, and point of growth cycle. As the chemicals induced the pump, the hypothesis is supported.

DNA MICROARRAY ANALYSIS OF SHEWANELLA ONEIDENSIS GROWN IN A MICROBIAL FUEL CELL
Daniel C. Choi
Syosset Senior High School, Syosset, NY, USA

The metal-reducing bacterium Shewanella oneidensis, which releases electrons from its internal respiratory reactions possibly by means of outer membrane cytochromes c, can be used as the electron donor in a “microbial” fuel cell (MFC). To determine which genes are responsible for the electrochemical activity of S. oneidensis, the gene expression profile of S. oneidensis enriched in the anode compartment of a working MFC was studied using DNA microarrays. RNA extracted from the culture was used to synthesize fluorescently-labeled cDNA, which was hybridized to three whole-genome microarrays of S. oneidensis. cDNA representing the RNA transcript from S. oneidensis grown anaerobically with iron, manganese, or fumarate as electron acceptors were included on the slides as bases for comparison. The MFC, which achieved a maximum power rating of 1.6 mW, generated the most voltage (2 fold greater) and current (7 fold greater) of comparable MFCs. DNA microarray analysis indicated that though numerous energy metabolism genes were expressed in every sample, cytochrome expression was generally low. However, each sample exhibited high transcription of a single outer membrane decaheme cytochrome c gene; mtrF in the fuel cell and mtrC in the comparison samples. These proteins’ prominent expression levels, low redox potentials and location on the outer membrane make them prime candidates for further study as possible mediators between intracellular electron carriers and the extracellular MFC electrode.

DUSTBUSTERS: AN ANALYSIS OF AGRICULTURAL DUST
Amanda Nicole Hartman
China Spring High School, China Spring, TX, United States of America

This experiment examines dust samples from winter wheat, new hay, and barn-stored hay for amount of dust, number of fungal elements, and number and type of bacteria present in each dust sample.<br><br> Samples of winter whteat, new hay, and barn-stored hay were gathered at several locations in Central Texas. The samples were sifted for dust, and the dust was weighed. Dust dilutions were used to perform duplicate quantitative plate counts with half-strength Tryptic Soy Agar, MacConkey's Agar, Mannitol Salt Agar, and Potato Dextrose Agar for each sample. TSA/2 is a nonselective nutritive medium that supports the growth of aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria. MSA selects for gram-positive, halophilic bacteria. MAC selects for gram-negative bacteria. PDA selects for fungal organisms. TSA/2, MAC, and MSA plates were incubated for 48 hours at 37 degrees Celsius. PDA plates were incubated for 72 hours at 25 degrees Celsius. The colonies on each plate were counted to determine te number of microbes per gram in the original dust sample. Colonies were chosen for isolation and identification from these plates based on physical appearance. Representative bacterial and fungal colonies were frozen. Biochemical tests were performed to identify the genus of bacterial samples. Organism Central, Bergey's Manuals of Systematic and Determinative Biology, and the Biolog machine were used to aid identification.<br><br> Dust from the new hay was found to contain the most culturable gram-negative bacteria and fungi per gram, while dust from the old hay contained the most culturable gram-positive bacteria per gram.

EFFECTS OF NUTRIENT CONCENTRATION ON THE FRACTAL GROWTH PATTERN OF BACILLUS SUBTILIS
Amy Wei-ming Liu
Hoover High Schoo, North Canton, OH, USA

This project was undertaken to learn about the colony patterns that Bacillus subtilis forms under stressed conditions. The experiment was to utilize fractal geometry to analyze the patterns of bacterial colony growth. The bacterial colonies were also compared to Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA) models simulated on a computer to see if there was any relation between organic and artificial aggregates.<br><br> Petri dishes were made with nutrient agar. The levels of the nutrient Bacto Peptone were varied – agar with 0.2g, 0.16g, 0.12g, 0.08g, and 0.04g Bacto Peptone levels (per 200 mL distilled water) were placed into different petri dishes. The bacterium tested was Bacillus subtilis. After streaking a 0.2g Bacto Peptone plate and isolating bacterial colonies, the bacteria were point-inoculated onto the petri dishes. After 8 days, the colonies were photographed and fractal dimensions of each were determined using the box counting method.<br><br> This project showed that the fractal dimension of the Bacillus subtilis colonies was generally constant throughout the nutrient levels: Colonies on the 0.2g Bacto Peptone level agar had an average fractal dimension of 1.62, 0.16g, 1.63; 1.2g, 1.66; .08g, 1.51; and 0.04, 1.53. In addition, the growth pattern of Bacillus subtilis was found similar to aggregates modeled through artificial means, namely computer simulations of DLA patterns: both the Bacillus subtilis colonies and the simulated DLA clusters were found to have fractal dimensions within the range of 1.5-1.7. In addition, when visually comparing the DLA clusters to the bacterial colonies, a definitive similarity can be seen in the branching patterns.

THE EFFECTS OF QUORUM SENSING ON FLAGELLA PRODUCTION IN SINORHIZOBIUM MELILOTI
Jupin Malhi
North Garland High School, Garland, Texas, United States of America

Quorum sensing is a cell-density dependent phenomenon in Sinorhizobium meliloti, a symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacterium. The bacteria produce signaling molecules called autoinducers, which are released into the environment, and upon achieving a threshold cell density they attach to transcriptional regulators in a process known as quorum sensing. This process is mediated in S. meliloti by the SinI protein (the autoinducer synthase) and the ExpR transcriptional regulator. Quorum sensing seems to play an important role in the motility of S. meliloti. Upon reaching a quorum, this bacteria should stop producing flagella and become non-motile. Samples of three S. meliloti strains (wild type, a sinI mutant, and an expR mutant) were subcultured from frozen stocks into nutrient broth. TEM preparation was performed using phosphotungistic acid (PTA) negative staining for flagellar visualization. Each strain was observed at an OD600 of 0.2 (lag to early log phase) and 0.8 (mid log phase) and showed extensive flagella at both time points. The wild type strain showed no flagella at mid log phase, whereas a sinI mutant showed flagella at mid log phase, suggesting that the Sin quorum sensing system suppresses flagella production. Once the bacterium reaches the host plant it not only achieves quorum but it also ceases to move. Our work suggests that these two processes are related and further investigation would provide much clarification.

EXPLORATION OF EPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS (EBV) ONCOPROTEIN LATENT MEMBRANE PROTEIN 1 (LMP-1) INTERACTION WITH INHIBITOR {KAPPA}B KINASE{EPSILON} (IKK{EPSILON}) AND TBK1
Shahriar Akbar Khan
North Attleborough High School, North Attleborough, Massachusetts, USA 

The purpose of this project was to determine the roles of two newly discovered immunoregulatory kinases, IKK{epsilon} and TBK1, on EBV LMP-1 signaling. Preliminary experiments attempted to use IKK{epsilon} knockout cells as well as TBK1 wild type (WT) and kinase mutant (KA) vectors to explore whether these kinases affected NF{kappa}B signaling through LMP-1 and elucidate if LMP-1 activated interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). <br><br> IKK{epsilon} experiments were not possible due to initially poor cell growth and delayed plasmid production. TBK1 experiments were inconclusive. While some extrapolations may be drawn from data, these are by no means tenable. Primarily, it appears that LMP-1 concentration increases with increasing concentrations of both TBK1 WT and KA. These results directly contradict data from NF{kappa}B activity assays, however.<br><br> Nonetheless, this data is being used to direct future research. The unique results from this experiment suggest that further investigation is worthwhile. Future experiments include repeating the aforementioned experiments as well as developing an IRF3 reporter system amongst others. Future data will further guide the direction of this novel research. More research is currently underway using established techniques delineated in the research proposal. <br><br>

THE INHIBITORY EFFECT OF GREEN TEA CATECHINS ON THE PRODUCTION OF INTERLEUKIN-6 BY GINGIVAL EPITHELIAL CELLS
Gregory Andrew Warot
Boston Latin Academy, Boston, MA, USA

Catechin, a polyphenol, extracted from green tea previously demonstrated the potential to inhibit the growth oral bacteria associated with Periodontitis. Knowing that catechin possesses an antimicrobial effect, an experiment was designed to measure if catechin also possesses anti-inflammatory properties. <br><br> In response to orally colonized bacteria, gingival epithelial cells produce Interleukin-6 (IL-6), which causes inflammation and bone resorption. Although more than 600 species of bacteria colonize around the teeth, it is unclear which bacteria are associated with the induction of IL-6. The purpose of this project was to measure the amount of IL-6 produced by epithelial cells stimulated with various oral bacteria and to determine if catechin has a potential to decrease the production of IL-6. Twenty different strains of heat fixed bacteria, varying in degree of Periodontitis association, were combined with the cultured line of epithelial cells. Catechin solution or growth media alone were then added to the epithelial cell culture. The amount of IL-6 induced in the presence or absence of catechin was measured using the Enzyme Linked Immuno Absorbent Assay (ELISA).<br><br> The gingival epithelial cells stimulated with Actinobacillus actinomicetemcomtans, a pathogen of Localized Juvenile Periodontitis, induced the greatest amount of IL-6. Catechins were shown to decrease the production of IL-6 by gingival epithelial cells stimulated with bacteria. Current anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics have possible side effects and dangers of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Catechins, which are natural and consumable, have a strong potential to become a safe comparative therapy reducing the dependence of antibiotics in the treatment of Periodontitis.<br><br>

THE ANTIMICROBIAL EFFECTS OF ANTIBIOTICS AND HERBS ON INSULIN
Chelsea Rae Berg
Sawyer High School, Sawyer, ND, USA

The purpose of my project was to see if insulin had any affect on how antibiotics and herbs inhibit the growth of E. coli (14948), Staphylococcus epidermidis (155), and Streptococcus salivarius (14319) bacteria. My hypothesis was that the insulin would affect how antibiotics and herbs inhibit the growth of bacteria. My procedure began by making stock plates. After streaking one plate for each bacteria, I incubated the bacteria for 48 hours at 35 degrees Celsius and transferred the bacteria to inoculum tubes to measure with a turbidity meter for the suggested 0.08. For every single plate I experimented with, I used 200 micro liters of bacteria, streaked 4 plates to make 12 trials, and put three disks on each plate. For the antibiotics, I put three antibiotic disks on each streaked plate and incubated the plates. When I used the insulin on the antibiotics, I put 30 micro liters of insulin on each antibiotic disk and incubated the plates. For the insulin itself, I put three sterilized filter paper disks on each streaked plate, put 10 micro liters of insulin on each disk, and incubated the plates. For the herbs, I put five micro liters of the herb on each filter paper disk and then put 10 micro liters of insulin on each disk as well. I incubated each and every plate for 48 hours at 35 degrees Celsius, measured the inhibition zones with a vernier caliper, and recorded the data. I took pictures of every plate, and I wrote what I did each day in a log book.<br><br> I conclude that insulin does affect how antibiotics and herbs inhibit the growth of bacteria.

THE EFFECTS OF ALLIUM SATIVUM ON ANTIBIOTICS AND BACTERIA
Megan Elizabeth Whitted
Sawyer High School, Sawyer, ND 58781, USA

The purpose of my experiment was to see the effect Allium sativum (garlic) has on antibiotics and bacteria. I wanted to see how well garlic inhibits the growth of E.coli (14948), Streptococcus salivarius (14319), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (155). Another thing I researched was to see if the combination of garlic and antibiotics together would help antibiotics to be even more effective at inhibting the growth of bacteria. My hypothesis was I thought that Allium sativum would inhibit the growth of bacteria. I also thought that the combination of Allium sativum and antibiotics together would indeed help the antibiotics be even more effective at inhibiting the growth of bacteria. To do my experiment, I chose different kinds of garlic and antibiotics. E.coli (14948), Streptococcus salivarius (14319), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (155) bacteria were used. The bacteria was streaked onto sheep blood agar plates and either three sterilized disks that had been soaked in garlic or three antibiotic disks were placed onto the streaked plates. The plates were incubated for 48 hours at 32º Celsius. After incubation, the inhibition zones were measured and data was recorded. I also combined the antibiotics with the garlic. I took the antibiotic disks and soaked them in the garlic and then placed them onto the streaked plates. My control was plain sterile filter paper disks. My data shows that both garlic and antbiotics do inhibit the growth of bacteria. However, antibiotics inhibit the growth more then garlic. In some cases the combination of antibiotics and garlic inhibit the growth of bacteria more than antibiotics alone.

DETERMINATION OF LYTIC ABILITIES IN A CLOSTRIDIUM SEPTICUM ALPHA TOXIN MUTANT
Elizabeth Leigh Rathgeber
Alva Senior High School, Alva, OK

Clostridium septicum is a gram-positive, anaerobic organism located widely throughout the soil and in animals, such as humans and horses. Clostridium septicum alpha toxin is a lethal pore former which vacuolates victim cells, resulting in death through lysis within less than 24 hours. The purpose of this research project was to determine if the movement of the loop region in Domain 2 was necessary for pore formation in alpha toxin. An alpha toxin mutant (S220C/S269C) was generated by changing the serines on the nucleotides 220 and 269 to cystines by using multiple Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCR). By doing this, a disulfide bond (a reversible covalent bond) would be created. This disulfide bond was formed in hopes of locking down the Trans Membrane Domain, located in Domain two, which was believed to be the cause of lysis in victim cells. Alpha toxin mutant proteins that were structurally sound were grown up to a large scale of 10 L for purification. Then the purified protein was run through gels to determine if it would oligomerize on victim cell membranes. The mutant was added with red blood cells and ran in a hemolytic assay to determine the lysing abilities of this mutant. Dithiothreitol (DTT) was also added to the mutant, in hopes to reduce the disulfide bond. The mutant S220C/S269C was found to obtain no lysing abilities, but when DTT was added to the mutant, it regained all of the lysing abilities. In conclusion, the S220C/S269C mutant possessed no lysing abilities, and that DTT was found to reduce the disulfide bond that was generated in this mutant.

EFFECT OF HAZELNUT HUSK EXTRACT ON BACTERIA
Jennifer Elizabeth Goedhart
Unity Christian High School, Orange City, IA, USA

This project was designed to answer whether hazelnut husks (involucres) had an antibacterial effect. A modified Kirby-Bauer test showed water, ethanol, and DMSO extracts of hazelnut each significantly inhibited the bacterium Bacillus subtilis(ATTC strain #6633), but had no effect on the growth of Escherichia coli(K-12).<br><br>The inhibition increased with increasing concentrations of each extractant. Since water was as effective and was safer, all further extractions used water. The water soluable hazelnut extact was 20-25% by weight of the dried husks.<br><br>A comparision of the inhibition of the supernatant versus the pellet of the refrigerated, centrifuged extracts revealed that anitbacterial activity was present only in the supernatant.<br><br>Hazelnut involucre extracts at a concentration of 2260ìg/disk(obtained by concentrating the extract to one milliliter per gram of husk) produced an average zone of complete growth inhibition of 3.6mm past the edge of the disk in B. subtilis. In comparision with penicillin, the weakest antibiotic tested, the extract produced a zone of inhibition only 50% as great. B. subtilis growth in nutrient broth, as measured by absorbance, was inhibited 60-98% as hazelnut husk extract increased from 540 to 4500 ppm.<br><br>In conclusion hazelnut husk extract increasingly inhibited the gram positive bacterium B. subtilis as concentrations increased. Futher reseach is needed to determine the spectrum of activity against other bacteria and to determine the active component. This product holds promise as a natural bacteriostat in animal feeds or in the food industry.

THE PHENOTYPIC CONQUENCES OF L-LEUCINE DEPRIVATION
Ginger Lee Gullickson
Alexander Public School, Alexander, ND, USA

The problem studied in this research project was if amino acid deprivation have effects on the growth patterns of three different bacterium species; Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, and Micrococcus luteus. <br><br> It was hypothesized that amino acid deprivation will effect the bacterium species such that the colonial count will decrease.<br><br> The procedure used for this research project was to first obtain one nutrient agar plates for each of the different bacterium species. These plates contained the full spectrum of amino acids. These were the control groups. The next step was to obtain agar plates with the amino acid leucine absent for each of the bacterium species. Then, obtained cultures of S. marcescens, E. coli, and M. luteus. Using aseptic techniques streaked each plate for each bacterium species. Incubated all of the agar plates at 37°C upside down for 24-48 hours. After 24 hours observed the agar plates, and then observed them again at 48 hours. Recorded observations by counting all visible colonies.<br><br> The results of the experiment showed that amino acid leucine deprivation does effect all three of the bacterium species in some significant way or the other.<br><br>

THE INHIBITION OF E.COLI BY USING PLANT EXTRACT
Mahwish Noor
The City School, Islamabad, Pakistan

<br><br>Better methods to inhibit E.coli by juices and solid fruits or vegetables such as lemon, keno, onion, garlic, ginger and mixtures of seeds i.e. aniseed, mints and ijwain are needed. As antibiotics are losing their effectiveness due to resistance development of bacteria and unavailability of antibiotics in case of emergence of new microoganism, other alternative therapies are needed. The importance of local fruits and vegetables are due to no side effects, more availability and also a source of one of the alternative and complementary therapy. My objectives were to observe the sensitivity of a pathogenic E.coli, which has been previously, isolated in a diagnostic microbiology laboratory from a patient. The experiment was designed after discussion with my scientist. Due to safety reasons, I was only observing the whole experiment and the outcomes while the scietist performed the experiment. <br><br>The main focus of this experiment was to determine the usage of common foods in our daily lives that could help our health. The contribution to the existing knowledge is that local fruits and vegetables are not redundant but could be a complementary source of therapies. I expected that the lemon juice and the complete fruit would both inhibit E-coli since it is very citrus. This supports my hypothesis that it is probably the citric acid and other factors, which influence the inhibition of E.coli. On the basis of my study findings, I would be able to conclude that fruits and vegetables can be considered as potential sources of alternative and complementary therapy that can inhibit pathogenic bacteria that causes many health problems in human beings such as Escherichia coli which is an emerging cause of food and water borne illnesses. I would also conclude that natural fruits and vegetables are not redundant but could be use as a source of alternative and complementary therapy. <br><br> <br><br><br>

MICROBIAL CONTAMINANTS IN THE GROSS ANATOMY LABORATORY: ISOLATION OF GEOTRICHUM SP. AND PSEUDOMONAS FLUORESCENS IN A PHENOLIC WASTE MOP BUCKET
Ewa Szymanska
Thomas R. Proctor High School, Utica, NY, USA

Human cadavers used in the study of gross anatomy may contain a variety of possible pathogens. Precautions taken to prevent laboratory contamination and infection of personnel include cadaver disinfection by phenol. The phenol concentration used in the gross anatomy laboratory is 1.8% (w/v), but there is a possibility of contamination through dilution of phenolic wastes. In the gross anatomy lab at Utica College, a microbial mat formed on the surface of phenolic liquid waste in a mop bucket. A sample of the growth was collected and cultivated on agar media. A fungus and Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the biofilm. The bacterium was identified as Pseudomonas fluorescens using the API-20 test, which was confirmed by observing the production of fluorescein. 16S rRNA sequence analysis gave a 100% identification as P. fluorescens biotype A. Microscopic analysis of the isolated fungus revealed hyaline arthroconidia, suggesting identification as Geotrichum sp., a member of a group of dermatophytic fungi. Sequence analysis of the 28S rRNA gene revealed a 99.4% match with Geotrichum klebahnii. This is consistent with the fact that some members of that genus can utilize phenolic compounds. Chromatographic and spectroscopic analysis of the waste fluid quantified the concentration of phenolic compounds as 0.378%. Experiments to examine the phenol tolerance of the isolated fungus showed that it grew in enriched media containing phenol concentrations as high as 0.11%. Results indicate that a disinfectant like phenol may be diluted or metabolized to a point that it sustains the growth of potential microbial pathogens.

A SURVEY OF ZOOPLANKTON IN MINNESOTA LAKES
Elizabeth Ann Bassett
Bagley High School, 1130 Main Ave North, Bagley, MN 56621-9544 U.S.A.

Zooplankton are vital organisms to the biological integrity of any wetland environment. In monitoring these organisms, definite seasonal patterns were visible. This study involved two Minnesota Clearwater County Lakes, Minnow Lake(eutrophic) and Lake Lamond(mesotrophic). Samples were taken from both of these sites for 7 weeks, one day each week, starting in September and stretching to the end of October. A plankton net was used to collect the samples, and then they were taken back to the lab for identification. Five slides from every sample of both lakes were put under the microscope, and the organisms were keyed, identified, and tallied.<br><br>2763 individuals were identified. Among these were rotifers including keratella, trichonera, polyarthra, and asplancha. Copepods included cyclopoid, calanoid, and nauplius larval. The individuals in the suborder cladocera were daphnia and bosmina.<br><br>Statistical analysis was taken to determine the difference in populations between the two lakes. In conclusion, the data did not support the hypothesis that the seasonal change would cause the zooplankton populations in these two lakes to decrease. It did in fact show that the levels increased, as the time of the fall maxima was during my sampling period.<br><br>

RESISTANCE
Kalah Linn Cummings
Tishomingo County High School

While being sick, the problem became clear. Do bacteria show resistance toward antibiotics, the answer is yes. The Hypothesis tested states: If the colony of bacteria multiplies around the antibiotic strips, the bacterium shows resistance to the antibiotics. <br><br> By taking four different kinds of bacterium and placing strips of antibiotics on them, then is the experiment showed growth around the plates, it held resistance. By keeping the samples in a concealed lab environment with supervision from the lab technician, the results identified true. The Pseudomonas showed the perfect example; it grew on the left side of the plate entirely, but not on the right. The left antibiotic was not strong enough to hold it at bay. While the Strep showed little signs of resistances at either side of the plate. The other showed the same results.<br><br> The conclusion, which was analyzed clearly states the hypothesis to be right. After looking at the data, it shows not all antibiotics are meant for everything. A person could end up with a large pharmacy bill for nothing. This experiment proved hypothesis correct. That any old antibiotic cannot always hold off the growth of a bacterium. <br><br>

THE GHOST EFFECT ON VIRUSES
An Ho
Piedmont Hills High School, San Jose, CA, United States

In the experiment, I had hoped to see if the quantity of lysed bacterial ghost affects the rate of pathogenic viral activity. I tested this by preparing five sets of plates to observe any change in viral phi X 174 bacteriophage population based on the appearance of plaques on selected cultures of E. coli C. Two sets of control were used to demonstrate that the bacteria were capable of growing on the agar surface, and that the lysed bacteria had no significant effects on the growth of the bacteria population. I had hypothesized that since viruses are host specific and differentiate their hosts via protein markers, the rate of viral activity would decrease proportionally to the increase in concentration of bacterial ghost. In the experiment, the percent of infection dropped from 7.6 percent to 0.4 percent, as the concentration of lysed bacteria increased from 0 percent to 80 percent respectively. My hypothesis was confirmed as the percentage of infection was significantly lower when lysed bacteria were added. The values were largely within a certain degree of uncertainty and the values fitted an acceptable deviation from the mean value.

IS OUR SCHOOL A BACTERIA CAFETERIA?
Kaitlyn Nicole Arnold
Palmetto High School 1200 17st West Palmetto Florida 34221

<br><br>This project was completed to conclude whether or not our school is a bacteria cafeteria. I began this project by taking samples and applying them to blood agar plates that were then incubated for 24 hours. After the incubation period, I examined the morphology of each agar plate. After examining the morphology of the different colonies I chose the more dominant colonies throughout the plates to further examination. I proceeded to take a sterile loop and remove a sample from specific colonies and place them on slides. After completing extraction of the colony the slides were left to dry in a biological safety cabinet. Then I continued the project by doing a gram stain which is the first step to identify any bacteria. The first step in the gram stain was to place slides in crystal violet solution for one minute and then rinse the slide with water. Then the slides were placed in iodine for one minute. The iodine acts as a mordant for the crystal violet. The slides were again rinsed with water. The slides were then dipped in decolorizer (acetone) for five seconds then rinsed with water. The last step to the gram stain was to hold the slides in red saffron for one minute and then to rinse with water. After gram stains were completed and the slides were dry I applied emersion oil to the slide and viewed it under the microscope. In conclusion our school was a bacteria cafeteria.<br><br>

DETERMING CHEMICAL INHIBITORS OF ARGINASE ACTIVITY OF HELICOBACTER PYLORI
Michael Anthony Smith
Murphy High School, Mobile, Alabama, USA

The purpose of this project was to determine chemical inhibitors of arginase activity in Helicobacter pylori. H. pylori becomes susceptible to the acidic environment of the stomach once arginase activity is inhibited. This is done by preventing the creation of ammonia (a base) which would create a pH buffer system against the hydrochloric acid. It was hypothesized that chemicals that affect arginase activity in other organism would affect arginase activity in H. pylori in a similar fashion.<br><br>This experiment used an arginase assay that detected the production of ornithine. Using purified RocF, the samples were tested as various concentrations in multiples of five. Using a special program in the spectrophotometer, a standard curve could be derived to base the inhibitory effects of the different chemicals.<br><br>The results of this experiment disproved the general hypothesis. The RocF protein from H. pylori exhibited opposite reactions to the chemicals used in this experiment. This led to the conclusion that the arginase in H. pylori is unique to its superfamily. Further, it was shown that citrulline affects the development of ninhydrin for the purpose of measuring light absorbency.<br><br>In evaluation of this experiment, possibly an alternative to ninhydrin could have been used to test the citrulline. Additionally, human error may have caused the contamination of the arginase buffer used in the experiment.<br><br>

EFFECT OF ANTIOXIDANTS ON DNA REPAIR OF ULTRAVIOLET-INDUCE MUTAGENESIS
Kawakahi Kaeo Amina
Kamehameha High School, Honolulu, HI USA

This project seeks to evaluate the role of antioxidants (b-carotene and a-tocopherol) in the DNA repair process after ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation in prokaryotes. Serratia marcescens was irradiated with 5mJ of ultraviolet light (200-400nm) then incubated at 30C for varying amounts of time under white, red, blue, or green light or in complete darkness. Repair of UV-induced DNA damage to growth promoting genes was most efficient in the presence of white or blue light. Surprisingly, repair and/or expression of genes associated with the production of the red pigment prodigiosin were significantly inhibited or delayed after UV-irradiation. The addition of either b-carotene or a-tocopherol significantly improved the survival of UV irradiated cells but did not affect the timing of renewed prodigiosin production. To determine if these antioxidants affected the induction of DNA damage by UV or played a role in the repair of UV-induced damage, the plasmid pAMP was irradiated with 5mJ of UV light in the presence or absence of b-carotene or a-tocopherol. Neither antioxidant had any effect on the induction of DNA damage to pAMP as determined by the plasmid's ability to transformed E. coli (MM294) to ampicillin resistance. These results suggest that the ability of these antioxidants to improve the survival of cells after UV irradiation is not due to an inhibition of UV-induced DNA damage but to an enhancement of the repair of that damage. Yet to be determined is the step(s) in the repair of UV-induced DNA damage that are modulated by b-carotene and a-tocopherol.

STREPTOCOCCUS BETA HEMOLYTIC AND STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS PREVALENCE AND THEIR ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE IN THE STUDENT POPULATION OF CBTIS 172 CORTAZAR GTO.
Manuel Alberto Chavez Lira
Centro de Bachillerato Tecnologico industrial y de servicios.Cortazar Gto. Mex.

The Staphylococcus aureus are human parasites many people shelter them in their body generating diseases like pneumonias, pharyngitis, tonsillitis and mortal septicemias. The Streptococcus beta hemolytic are characterized by pathogenic process like septicemias, endocarditis and suppurations in any organ among others. The Staphylococcus aureus and the Streptococcus beta hemolytic are able to become resistant by the indiscriminated and excessive use of antibiotics. The object is to determinate the presence of these pathogenic microorganisms and observate resistance under antibiotics, which can be one of the causes of high level of absence or down level study. From October 2002 to January 2004 a practic study was realized, 100 pharyngal samples were taken from students of 15 to 18 years old, in both shift turns, in an aleatory way, the 86% have the support of government medical service. To isolate Staphyloccus aureus, they were seeded in 110 Agar, blood Agar for the Streptococcus beta hemolytic and for their identification I used the morphologic and microscopic characteristics and Gram stain, once identified the antibiogram was applied in Mueller Hinton Agar, 32 strains were obtained of Streptococcus beta hemolytic resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, dicloxallin and are susceptible to pefloxacime, cefotaxime, sulfamethoxazole-trimetrhoprim, tetracicline, gentamicine. 34 Strains were obtained of the Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, pefloxacine, cefotaxime, erythromycin, tetracycline, cefotaxime, dicloxacillin, and are susceptible to gentamicine, sulfamethoxazole-trimetrhoprim and pefloxacine. Concluding that 66 % of the obtained samples presented pathogenic microorganisms already mentioned.

CHINESE HERBAL MEDICINE, ANTIBIOTICS, AND RESISTANCE
Christine Yu-Shing Hsu, Zhi Hui Lu
John B. Connally High School, Austin TX, USA

<br><br>Antibiotic resistance has now become a global threat and a public health. New strains of resistant pathogens continue to evolve as scientists struggle to stay ahead. Traditional Chinese herbs employed in this study showed promising antibacterial effects against some common bacteria. In addition, many Chinese herbs have been shown to improve immunities. This dual capability bestows traditional Chinese medical herbs great potential in treatment and prevention of infectious diseases and in impeding the development of drug resistance. This experiment compared the performance of four traditional antibiotics, penicillin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline to 11 chinese medical herbs which included ginseng, pomegranate, gambir, ganoderma, dandelion, astragalus, lonicera, white & red peony, agastache, and istasis leaf. Extracts of whole dried plants from a chinese medical center were tested on growths of Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus cereus, Serratia marcescens and E. coli as were the the 4 antibiotics. Most promising herbs were combined with each of the antibiotics and tested with the bacteria. <br><br>Ganoderma, dandelion, pomegranate and ginseng exhibited the most marked antibiotic effects. Overall the herbs appeared to be as beneficial as the antibiotics and in the case of gingseng,pomegranate and dandelion at little better. A synergistic effect of herbs plus antibiotics showed promise of reducing the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics. <br><br>

THE STUDY OF PATHOGENIC GROWTH ON CONTACT LENS CASES
Jane GeHyun Kim, Deanna Tran
duPont Manual High School, Louisville, KY, U.S.A.

Many lens wearers are either unsure or ignore the dangers their contact lens cases present. Unlike contact lenses, which are immersed in disinfectants for hours, the cases are exposed to unsanitary environments, such as bathrooms, sinks, dressers, or bags, etc. The consequences for improper lens care include eye infections, keratitis, and even blindness (Seal, 1999). So this experiment is focused on the examination of organisms found on contact lens cases.<br><br> From pre-conducted research, it was suspected that both pathogenic and nonpathogenic organisms would be found. The cases were thoroughly swabbed in various areas. The swabs were streaked onto different media. After periods of time, growth appeared on the plates. A series of reagent tests, ID tests, and gram stains were run on the organisms. The results of the tests and gram stains were observed in order to identify the organisms. <br><br> After examination of the organisms, both pathogens and nonpathogens were found; the hypothesis was supported. Pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and potential pathogens such as Streptococcus species were recovered only in the lids of the cases. Non-pathogens such as Bacillus species and non-Candida yeasts were obtained. It was also concluded that lens wearers with yearly contact lenses had pathogenic growth on the lens cases. The presence of these organisms showed that contact cases were extremely unsanitary and extra care was needed to prevent future dangers. From the results of this research, it is hoped that lens wearers will take better care of their contact lenses and cases.<br><br>

EXPIRED OR EFFECTIVE PHASE III WOULD YOU RATHER BE AMOXICILLIN OR CLAVULANIC ACID?
Lauren Marie Calcote, Blaire Elizabeth Phelps
Farmington High School Farmington, NM United States of America

Phase III of this experiment was attempting to find out which of the components of Augmentin was deteriorating first. The original Augmentin sample was again used, which had expired in 1997, and compared to a current Augmentin sample. Two different gram negative bacteria were used, instead of the gram positive Staaphylococcus aureus used previously, one was sensitive to the amoxicillin component of Augmentin and the other required the clavulanic acid in order for the Augmentin to be effective. The hypothesis was that the amoxicillin component was breaking down more rapidly than the clavulanic acid component.<br><br>Standard dilutions of Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catorrhalis were developed using the method of Phase II. A sample of the bacteria was placed in serial dilutions of the antibiotics and an aliquot of TSB broth was added. The tubes were incubated and checked at 24 and 48 hours. The initial bacteria chosen were found to not be supported by the tSB broth and did not show any growth at the end of the experiment. A second set of bacteria were chosen, using the same criteria of sensitivities, and again the dilutions were developed and incubated. This time all of the tubes showed the same amount of growth after 48 hours, therefore a third attempt was made using higher concentrations of the antibiotic. The third experiment showed complete inhibition of growth of both sets of the Escherichia coli tubes, and no inhibition of growth in either set of the Klebsiella oxytoca tubes.<br><br>The E. coli bacteria were inhibited at the concentrations used in the third experiment, which suggests that the amount needed to kill the bacteria is somewhere between the dosages used in the second and third experiment. The Klebsiella were not inhibited at any of the concentrations used. The research suggest that the multiple beta-lacatamase enzymes exist which the bacteria used to break down the penicillins such as amoxicillin. Apparently, the Klebsiella expresses one of these extended spectrum beta-lactamases. Further testing is needed in order to find the exact concentration necessary for both organisms. Because the amoxicillin was more effective than the clavulanic acid, the hypothesis was proven incorrect.

FISHING FOR PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA VIA SEQUENCING AND RFLP ANALYSIS OF 16S SSRNA GENES
James Christopher Cronk, Laura Anne Kaningher
Centaurus High School, Lafayette CO, USA

The ribosome is one of the most highly conserved biological structures. The 16s ribosomal DNA sequence is known to code for the 30s ribosomal subunit. Being a part of the ribsome, the 16s sequence is highly conserved, meaning that its sequence is relatively unchanged among organisms. Therefore, individual species, as opposed to higher taxonomic levels, are more likely to contain unique polymorphisms in the 16s region. It is believed that these 16s polymorphisms may be used to genetically identify bacterial species. This interpretation is tested using Pseudomonas Aeruginosa in experimentation. A known culture of P. Aeruginosa will be used to establish specific sequences which may be unique to P. Aeruginosa. A restriction fragment length polymorphism pattern (RFLP) will also be established, as a backup method of P. Aeruginosa identification. These polymorphic sequences are identified by sequencing the 16s library and comparing results to other known bacterial 16s sequences, using the Arg database. These polymorphic sequences are used to develop a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) oligonucleotide probe. This probe is used to identify P. Aeruginosa in environmental samples. This method of bacterial identification is more reliable, as well as cost and time effective, than current methods.

DISCOVERY OF NOVEL AND HIGHLY UNIQUE MYCOBACTERIOPHAGES: MORPHOLOGICAL AND GENETIC COMPARISON
Lazlo Ring, Chiara Klaiman
The Beacon School, New York, NY, USA

Bacteriophages are among the most abundant organisms on the planet and have enormous genetic diversity. The purpose of this research was to discover and categorize new and unique mycobacteriophages for further use in genetic and therapeutic Mycobacterium tuberculosis research. Phages were extracted from soil by amplifying with non-pathogenic Mycobacterium smegmatismatis. Mycobacteriophage DNA was compared using restriction fragment linked polymorphism (RFLP) with the enzymes Cla 1 and BstE II. Mycobacteriophage morphologies were compared using whole cell thin layer electron microscopy.<br><br>Four new mycobacteriophage were discovered in soil gathered from the East coast of North America. These newly discovered mycobacteriophages have heterogeneous plaque morphologies, and the phage tail length appears to be heterogeneous with respect to latitude. These phages were compared with other newly discovered mycobacteriophages using RFLP analysis. Two mycobacteriophages were found to have similar RFLP fragments, giving entirely new insight into the highly mosaic pattern of the mycobacteriophage genomes. In addition, a unique phage that appears to belong to an entirely new phage genus was discovered. After repeated attempts, DNA was not isolated from this mycobacteriophage. Future studies will test for the possibility that the genetic material of this mycobacteriophage is RNA, unlike any other mycobacteriophage. <br><br>This research has seeded a mycobacteriophage library that has many implications for future research, including the development of new therapies for patients infected by antibiotic-resistant M. tuberculosis

ZOOPLANKTON AND PHYTOPLANKTON: ENVIRONMENTAL FUNGI GROWTH'S CURE
Juan Sebastian Villeta-Garcia, Eduardo R. Silva Silva
Academia del Perpetuo Socorro, San Juan, Puerto Rico 

Does zooplankton and phytoplankton inhibit the growth of environmental fungi in recycled paper? It was hypothesized that due to the fact that 3% Hydrogen Peroxide is one of the world’s most efficient fungi biocides and also that zooplankton and phytoplankton are one of the ocean’s leading producers of 3% Hydrogen Peroxide, zooplankton and phytoplankton would reduce and inhibit environmental fungi growth in recycled paper. Penicillium sp. and Synsiphilastrum sp. were provided by the qualified scientist and were put in Agar Petri Dishes and grown until full mature colonies were seen. After suspension, a dropper was used to extract samples of the suspended spores. Two drops of the suspended spores were inoculated, in the center of each of sixteen octagonal shaped recycled paper samples, encompassing a 8mm diameter circle, and were put inside empty Petri Dishes to enable a controlled environment. These papers were labeled as follows: four containing only plankton, as the positive control group; four without plankton, two of each kind of fungi, representing the negative control group; eight with plankton, four for each fungi used representing both the experimental group A and the experimental group B. In Synsiphilastrum sp., samples containing Zooplankton and Phytoplankton encompassed an area 53% smaller than those without Zooplankton and Phytoplankton, and in Penicillium sp., the samples containing Zooplankton and Phytoplankton encompassed an area 20% smaller. Zooplankton and Phytoplankton, through the release of 3% Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2), are effective fungi biocides against Penicillium sp. and Synsiphilastrum sp. environmental fungi in recycled paper.

MECHANISTIC STUDIES OF THE TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVATION OF THE INITIATION OF BACTERIOPHAGE LAMBDA DNA REPLICATION
Siyuan Wang, Tao He
Beijing No.4 High School, Beijing, P.R.China

What are the factor(s) that determine the requirement of the initiation of bacteriophage LAMBDA DNA replication for transcriptional activation? Some scientists believe that the Escherichia coli histone-like protein HU, a heterodimer of HU-ALPHA and HU-BETA subunits, is involved in the transcriptional activation; while others suggest that DNA supercoiling plays a critical role in the process. In this work, we have tried to test the above hypotheses using genetic methods. <br><br>In our superinfection experiments, we found that the initiation of LAMBDA DNA replication depended on transcriptional activation in Escherichia coli strains that lacked HU-ALPHA, HU-BETA homodimer or HU heterodimer. These data suggest that none of the three forms of HU is the direct determinant of transcriptional activation of the initiation of LAMBDA DNA replication.<br><br>In our gel electrophoresis experiments, we showed that the level of DNA supercoiling in a plasmid isolated from an E. coli strain defective in either one or both subunits of HU correlated with the extent of the influence that the corresponding dimer has on transcriptional activation. These data appear to suggest that DNA supercoiling is directly involved in the transcriptional activation, and HU influences the process indirectly by affecting DNA supercoiling.

DIEL VARIATIONS OF PLANKTONIC BIOLUMINESCENCE AND VERTICAL MIGRATION OF ZOOPLANKTON AT PUERTO MOSQUITO BAY, VIEQUES, PUERTO RICO

Casiano Cepeda H.S., Rio Grande, PR/Isidro A. Sanchez H.S., Luquillo, PR

Increase in planktonic bioluminescence at night has been observed since the first in situ measurements. Two main mechanisms have been proposed as sources of diel variations: an endognous circadian rythm of light emitions and the second one, the vertical migration of bioluminescent zooplankton towards the surface at night, which can represent the main source of nycthemeral variations in some places.<br><br> Although more evidence has been presented supporting the existence of a circadian rythm regulating bioluminescence , no evidence exists to deny the importance of zooplankton migration towards the surface at night.<br><br> In this research a Solid State Bathy-photometer (SSBP) was used to create bioluminescence profiles at the Puerto Mosquito Bioluminescent Bay, in Vieques, Puerto Rico. Measurements were made every hour in a 24 hour period. Bioluminescence profiles show that diel variations concern discrete regions in the water column. There is a movement of a bioluminescent layer towards the surface suggesting the migration of bioluminescent organisms at night. This will be confirmed when dinoflagellate counting is finished.

OPTIMIZING EXTREME ELECTROPORATION ON E. COLI K12 - YEAR 2
Lenny Boris Pekelis, Jonathan Vinea
Monte Vista High School, Danville, CA, USA

Electroporation is a phenomenon in which the membrane of a cell can be perforated when exposed to an electric field, allowing the entry of foreign particles such as DNA and medicine. In this study, a Tesla coil transformer is used to deliver 659,000 volts, as opposed to the standard maximum of 3,500 volts. The Tesla coil also has an inherent high frequency that is comparable to electroporation devices. A heat-sink was designed to prevent E. coli cells from overheating while maximizing energy traveling through the electroporation cuvette. In our first year of study, we devised a method to use a Tesla coil in electroporation, and discovered its potential during testing. This year, we optimized the procedure on E. coli, and compared it to well established heat-shock methods. Shock times were based on a logarithmic scale of 2^n so that an optimum time could be determined. The most efficient time for electroporation was found to be 16 seconds, where it was 219 % more effective than the heat-shock method. When time is optimized, Tesla coil electroporation is a significant improvement over the heat-shock and statistically comparable to commercial electroporation. <br><br>

THE ANTIBACTERIAL PROPERTIES OF ORIGANUM VULGARE, CINNAMOMUN ZEYLANICUM, HYDRASTIS CANADENSIS, ZINGIBER OFFICINALE AND SALVIA OFFICINALIS
Sarah Ann Wilfahrt, Michelle Wilfahrt
Park City High School, Park City, UT, United Sates

The purpose of this research experiment was to determine the effects of different herbal remedies on the growth of bacteria. The experiment was designed to identify the herbal remedy with the greatest antibacterial properties. The hypothesis stated there would be less bacterial growth in the growth media containing a higher concentration of herbal substances.<br><br>This experiment consisted of testing the antibacterial properties of sage, cinnamon, oregano, ginger, and goldenseal. The growth media utilized in this phase was organic chicken broth. All of the herbs tested were also of an organic nature, and contained no additives which could potentially influence their antibacterial properties. The herb with the greatest antibacterial effect was cinnamon. It inhibited bacterial growth at all concentrations, with the largest inhibitory effect being in the culture with the highest concentration of cinnamon. Sage also had a significant antibacterial effect, though not as great as cinnamon. It inhibited bacterial growth at the lower concentrations instead of the higher concentrations. Also, the variety of bacterial species was increased in the cultures containing lower amounts of sage. Goldenseal slightly inhibited bacterial growth at the highest concentration. It did not have any significant effect on bacterial specie variety. While oregano did not inhibit bacterial growth significantly, it did reduce the bacteriological specie variety to only one mono-specie. Ginger had almost no effect upon the bacterial growth or the variety of species. The hypothesis was fully proven by cinnamon and partially proven by sage in this experiment.

VARIATION OF DNA IN DIFFERENT SPECIES
Zachery Lee Elsik, Jaimie Ecklund
Memorial High School, Victoria TX, USA

It is commonly known that all the organisms are made up of DNA. It is the thing that decides everything about an organism, and like everything else in this world DNA has weight. We attempted to extract the DNA from a number of different organisms in order to compare the individual weights and find if the weights draw a parallel with each other. The results of studies such as these are used often in medical and scientific research. It has been used in the development of the enplane, which is an animal-to-human transplant where the animal organ has been genetically altered to suit the human systems. We used liquid nitrogen to dry up the organs and break apart the barrier tissue and cells. We then extracted the DNA and loaded the samples into the gel on the electrophoresis machine. It took a few hours to completely run the gel and move the DNA. We found that the DNA weight did not correlate to the actual weight of the different organs. Based on the information we found, we assumed that one particular organism would be bigger than the others, but found that the smallest organ had in fact the most DNA. The results of this experiment can, and has been, used in a number of other avenues. It is a general result that can have lasting and important effects that help in future advancements.

ESCHERICHIA COLI DNA DETECTION USING WATER SOLUBLE CONJUGATED POLYMERS AND PEPTIDE NUCLEIC ACID
Brianna Jean Gillund, Brooke Marie Gillund
North Toole County High School, Sunburst, MT, United States of America

The purpose for this experiment is three-fold. We wanted to develop a luminescent assay to detect Escherichia coli DNA using water-soluble conjugated polymers and peptide nucleic acid probes, and to determine if these can be used to detect DNA sequences other than those previously researched. Also, we wanted to determine a sequence specific to the Escherichia coli genome. We used the BLAST program at the NCBI website to determine a sequence specific to Escherichia coli K-12. We then used a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probe with flourescein attached to it to detect if the DNA was that of Escherichia coli. The cationic conjugated polymer that we added to the DNA/PNA solution produces light emission around 25 times higher than that obtained by exciting the flourescein dye on the PNA and permits detection of the DNA. We assembled a modified UV spectrophotometer to take voltage readings at wavelengths from 310 nm to 510 nm every 5 nanometers. We determined that it is possible to develop a luminescent assay for Escherichia coli using water-soluble conjugated polymers and peptide nucleic acid probes. We also discovered a sequence that is specific to only Escherichia coli K-12. Thus we can accept our expected hypothesis and reject our null.

BATTLING FREE RADICALS: THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF GREEN TEA AND UVA LIGHT ON FREE RADICAL GROWTH
Shweta Jain, Sheeja Thomas
Plano East Senior High, Plano, Texas, USA

Battling Free Radicals questioned the ability of antioxidant Green tea to deflect free radicals exposed to ionizing Ultraviolet light. The value of topical or oral applications of Epigallocatechin gallate, the most powerful catechin, is questioned. The experiment tests which element overpowers and has the faster rate of effect on the visible diameters of Sordaria fimicola. <br><br>A disk of filter paper soaked in a Green tea medium was placed in growths of mature Sordaria fimicola fungus exposed simultaneously to UVA light. Free radicals in fungal cell walls are necessary for growth. Fungi lack antibodies or immune system defenses, and the lifespan is sufficient for experimenting. The effect of polyphenols in fighting free radicals versus the effect of UVA radiation was determined by comparing growth slopes of the inoculated plates to the slopes of unexposed control fungus. A ring of no growth indicated that tea was warding off free radicals at a faster rate than the UVA light was forming them. As only three of the plates contained such rings, Green tea was ineffective in completely eradicating free radicals that were exposed to UVA light, disproving the hypothesis. <br><br>Trial I Week I and Trial II Week I, both containing unexposed fungus, had increasing slopes with slight deviation. A large difference in slopes regarding Trial I Week II and Trial II Week II indicated that fungal growth decelerated for the latter. Therefore, the catechins' sole effects are inadequate for complete sun protection but open the opportunity to exploring other defenses against the onset of immortalized cells.

RESISTANCE OF RED COLONY AND MM294 ESCHERICHIA COLI TO AMPICILLIN
Jonah Randolph Parker, Jesse Christopher Dodds
Central Lee High School, Donnellson, IA 52625, United States

The increase of antibiotic resistance is an important issue today as antibiotics are becoming increasingly ineffective in treating various illnesses. As bacteria become more resistant to antibiotics, more effective methods to control bacteria need to be developed. By comparing two established strains of Escherichia coli, Red Colony and mm294, this project could lead to new scientific revelations, spurring new dimensions in management of bacteria.<br><br> We sterilized all of our materials, and then extracted E. coli using accepted procedures and swiped the E. coli onto our Petri dishes. We then placed them into the incubator for 24 hours at 37° C. The purpose of this project was to discover which strain of E. coli was the most resistant to antibiotics during its growth and development, and provide groundwork for future testing.<br><br> Our first hypothesis was correct. We believed the Red Colony would have more growth. The experiment showed an average of 1.24 square centimeters more growth per plate than the strain mm294 had upon the agar. Our second hypothesis was incorrect. We believed the Red Colony would have more growth when, in fact, the Red Colony and strain mm294 had approximately the same amount of growth.<br><br> This scientific experiment most benefits those who hope to discover more about the behavior patterns accompanying specific strains of bacterial pathogens. Based upon our research, new ideas can be explored using selected strains of bacteria. This data could then provide additional information regarding resistance to antibiotics in the growth of bacterial pathogens.<br><br>

ANTIBACTERIAL POTENTIAL OF SYZYGIUM AQUEUM LEAVES AND BRASSICA OLERACEA VAR. ITALICA
Nur Aizaan Anwar, Mohd Al-Hanafi Ismail, Faiz Najmi Mansor
MARA Junior Science College Taiping, Perak, MALAYSIA

This project is an effort to discover the therapeutic value of local plants for future use. The research objective is to assess the antibacterial potential of Syzygium aqueum (leaves) and Brassica oleracea var. italica (BOVI). The bacteria are P. aeruginosa, Salmonella sp., E. coli, Staph. aureus and Klebsiella sp.<br><br> Seven plants were pre-screened for inhibitory properties in juice and methanol extract forms. S. aqueum and BOVI were later fractionated using methanol, petroleum ether and ethyl acetate. Disc Diffusion Assay was conducted against Methicillin Resistant S. aureus (MRSA) with Vancomycin and Oxacillin as the controls. Inhibitory fractions were tested for their Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) with Oxacillin as the control. Extracts were analyzed through Phytochemical Screening, Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC), Infrared Spectroscopy (IR) and Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS). <br><br> Screening showed that S. aqueum inhibited all the test organisms’ growth. BOVI inhibited the growth of all bacteria except Salmonella sp. S. aqueum juice inhibited all the bacteria except E. coli and Klebsiella sp. Only the ethyl acetate fractions showed activity against MRSA. Extract MICs are comparable to Oxacillin.<br><br>Extract Phytochemical Screening showed the existence of saponin and triterpenoids. GC/MS showed the extracts contain high amounts of octadecadienoic acid (triterpenoid), hexadecanoic acid (saponin) and trisulfides.<br><br> S. aqueum and BOVI showed wide spectrum inhibitory properties. As the extracts contain antibacterial phytochemicals, this is most likely why both extracts have inhibitory properties. These promising results are the first steps to discovering a new antibacterial substance that could be chemically synthesized in the future.<br><br> <br><br>

EFFECT OF ANTIBIOTIC FEED ADDITIVES ON DRUG-RESISTANT ESCHERICHIA COLI LEVELS IN CONSUMER MEATS
Aja Maria Hazelhoff, Anna Katharine Johns, Mary Elizabeth Griffin
The Altamont School, Birmingham, Alabama, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to analyze consumer meat products in order to determine the presence and relative amounts of E. coli that have developed resistance to the common livestock feed-additive antibiotics ampicillin, tetracycline, and gentamicin. Firstly, it was hypothesized that meats treated with antibiotics would contain significantly higher levels of antibiotic resistant E. coli than their organically raised equivalents. Secondly, since antibiotic resistance is more prevalent in antibiotics that have been used for a greater number of years, it was predicted that ampicillin would be least effective against bacteria, followed by tetracycline, and then gentamicin. To test this hypothesis, non-organic and organic ground beef, steak, chicken, and ground turkey samples were homogenized and then pipetted onto MacConkey agar plates containing either ampicillin, tetracycline, gentamicin, or no antibiotic. The plates were incubated overnight, and lactose positive (pink) colonies were counted. Any colonies found on the plates containing an antibiotic were considered antibiotic resistant. The resulting data indicated that the hypothesis was partially correct in that it accurately predicted the effectiveness of the various antibiotics. However, there was no notable correlation between the appearance of antibiotic resistant E. coli and feeding method (organic or non-organic).

INCREASED LACTOBACILLUS PRODUCTION IN MILK WITH HIGHER LIPID CONTENT
Ashley Anne Cady, Dominique Eghlidi
Southridge, Beaverton, Oregon, United States

The objective of the research is to investigate whether the fat content of milk affects the rate at which it spoils. Specifically, whether harmful bacteria multiply more in milk with a higher fat content because the extra fat provides more nutrients for the bacteria. Similar research conducted by other experimenters and scientists has been inconclusive. Methylene Blue (used as an oxygen indicator) will be added to milk with various fat concentrations including skim milk, one-percent milk, two-percent milk and whole milk. <br><br> The results of the trials support the hypothesis that the more fat present in milk the faster it will spoil. The mean length of time it took the whole milk to spoil was 3.13 hours, for 2% it was 5.15 hours, for 1% it was 6.48 hours and for the skim milk it was 9.96 hours. <br><br> The research supported the hypothesis and inspired new research as well. Secondary testing was conducted to learn about the types of bacteria present in milk. A Catalase test and Gram Stain test were both performed on organisms from agar plates. The Catalase test was positive for all the samples and the Gram Stain showed that the bacteria present were large, non-branching rods with some gram variable and a tendency to chain. The results from the Catalase test and Gram Stain test supported the secondary research hypothesis that the main bacteria present in milk was Lactobacillus.<br><br>

KEEPING ANTIBIOTICS WORKING II: EFFECTS OF PH AND BACTERIAL GROWTH MODULATION BY DAILY CONSUMABLES ON THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS TO ANTIBIOTICS
Maryam Khadijah Mohammed
Niceville Senior High School, Niceville, Florida, USA

Ineffectiveness of antibiotics is a global problem. For a problem of this magnitude, there are few known reasons, few strategies for prevention, and possibly a few reasons not yet discovered. This, together with my own experiences of hard-to-treat infections led me to investigate and discover innovative ways of preventing and combating this dilemma. In Phase-I, it was found that consumables (supplements, OTCMs, and fresh fruits) modulated the antibiotic susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus. <br><br>The main focus of Phase-II was to identify factors related to the consumables that modulate the antibiotic susceptibility of S. aureus. By identifying these factors strategies can be developed to keep conventional antibiotics effective. The consumables were tested for their effects on the culture-milieu pH, bacterial growth, and Beta-Lactamase. The pH was tested using a pH meter, growth modulation was tested using the agar-dilution method, and acidimetry was used to test Beta-Lactamase modulation. <br><br>The results were significant. The consumables modulated all three factors tested. The modulation of pH and bacterial growth were found to have significant effects on the antibiotic susceptibility of S. aureus, and were also determined to have a combinatorial effect. The majority of the consumables which increased the antibiotic sensitivity of S. aureus decreased both the culture-milieu pH and the bacterial growth. Also, the majority of the products which decreased the susceptibility of S. aureus to antibiotics increased the bacterial growth, and either had no effect on the culture-milieu pH, or increased it. <br><br>Based on these results, strategies can be developed to keep antibiotics working. <br><br>

MECHANISM OF ACTION OF RETROCYCLINS: CIRCULAR MINIDEFENSINS WITH ANTI-HIV-1 ACTIVITY
Andrew David Warren
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, Florida, USA

Attempts to prevent transmission of HIV with vaccines have failed because of the speed at which the virus can mutate. The current study will determine whether a novel peptide (a synthetic theta-defensin RC101O) will maintiain anti-HIV-1 activity after repeated viral infections. <br><br>PM-1 cells were infected with either HIV-1 alone as a control, HIV-1 with an inactive peptide (RC106 as negative control peptide, which is the inactive form of RC101), or HIV-1 with RC101. Five days post-infection, HIV-1 collected from each treatment group was quantified using p24 ELISA and viral RNA was extracted and converted into cDNA. Five overlapping PCR primer pairs were designed to amplify gp160, the gene that codes for the viral envelope. The products were cloned and sequenced. p24 concentrations showed RC101 effectively inhibited the infection of PM-1 cells for the first four rounds of infection, but decreased antiviral activity was shown in the fifth and sixth rounds. Ongoing sequence analysis of the gp160 gene will demonstrate which mutations of the viral genome affect RC101 activity by calculating p24 concentrations and will aid in designing more effective medicines to combat diseases in the future.

MY ENEMY IS MY FRIEND THE EFFECTS OF PHAGE THERAPY ON THE INDUCTION OF AGROBACTERIUM TUMEFACIENS
Tiffany Lynne Boyd
Miami High School, Miami, Oklahoma, U.S.

Phage therapy is the act of taking specific phages and adding them to a specific ecosystem in order to reduce the size of a specific bacterium. Agrobacterium tumefaciens is well known for the induction of cancerous growth in tissues known as crown gall. What causes this growth is an upset in the cell growth which leads to the production of galls. <br><br> The purpose of this investigation is to determine if the uses of phage therapy can effectively eliminate or control Ti plasmid induction of Agrobacterium in carrots.<br><br> It is hypothesized that phage therapy is an effective inhibitor of the induction of the Ti plasmid of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens. in carrots. Furthermore; phages will inhibit the disease cycle by destroying the viability of the Ti plasmid. Decreases in viability will be evident in number of galls produced on treated samples compared to the control. <br><br> Procedures consisted of filtering phages out of a fresh bovine manure samples, culturing isolated phages in A. tumefaciens cultures, and inoculating the A. tumefaciens-phage culture on carrot slices. Prepare carrots by washing, peeling, and placing them in Petri dishes containing agar. Inoculate the carrots with the bacterium and the phages at room temperature in a dark place.<br><br> The graphs show the amount of phages isolated, the number of galls formed, and the diameter of the crown gall rings. Twenty carrot slices were treated with phage treated A. tumefaciens, only four out of the twenty carrot slices (20%) contained evidences of established crown galls while eighty percent of the carrot slices (80%) showed no growth compared to the control plate which showed crown gall on all the carrot slices (100%). This supports the conclusion that the phages effectively inhibited Agrobacterium tumefaciens.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF STATIC MAGNETIC FIELDS ON THE GROWTH OF E. COLI
Carmen Bria'na Johnson
Amos P. Godby High School, Tallahassee, Florida, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to observe the effect of static magnetic fields on the growth of E. coli. The effect of magnetic fields on living organisms is a controversial topic that has not been thoroughly researched. It is significant in order to further explore the possible medicinal benefits, how life began, and how modern life may survive extreme earthen environments and elsewhere.<br><br> The results were determined after three experiments. In Part I, forty plates, including “non-magnetic” controls, were prepared with E. coli. Seven pairs of neodymium magnets were used, each having plates directly on top and at a distance (5-10 cm). Plates were incubated at 37ºC for 24 hours. Incubator space constraints may have factored in distance not appearing to effect growth. The direct contact plates appeared to have less growth nearer the magnet. However, bacterial lawns prevented colony counts. <br><br> In Part II, further dilutions were made, and three pairs of magnets (0.601 kG-3.37 kG) were used. A direct contact plate and a non-magnetic control were prepared for each magnet. Colony counts revealed lower counts on the magnetic plates than on the controls.<br><br> A t-Test was conducted on the Part II results to determine statistical significance. These results suggest the colony counts with the strongest magnets were significantly different (p = 0.10). Part III examined the average colonial growth rate and morphology. The qualitative results of Part I, and quantitative results of Parts II and III, suggest that higher magnetic fields may decrease bacterial growth.<br><br>

OPTIMIZING THE GROWTH IMPEDIMENT PROPERTIES OF PURE GARLIC OIL IN SERIAL DILUTIONS OF AGROBACTERIUM TUMEFACIENS
Benjamin Wayne Brewer
Eastern High School, Pekin Indiana, USA

The purpose of this project was to determine the optimal growth impediment properties of pure garlic oil when applied to serial dilutions of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Hypothesis 1 stated that if plated serial dilutions of Agrobacterium tumefaciens were treated with pure garlic oil, then the optimal strength to impede growth could be determined. Hypothesis 2 stated that if plated serial dilutions of Agrobacterium tumefaciens were treated with different strengths of pure garlic oil, then the greatest strength of pure garlic oil would cause the largest colony growth prevention rate. Using three slant tube cultures of Agrobacterium tumefaciens that were purchased from Carolina Biological, a base culture and five other 1:20 serial dilutions were made. The petri dishes were treated with different strengths of pure garlic oil and olive oil as a control. There were twelve petri dishes left untreated for the control. After allowing the treatments to soak into the agar for a day, the petri dishes were separated into pairs and were inoculated with different serial dilutions. When colony counts were taken, it was found that the pure garlic oil caused a colony growth prevention rate of 59% on the petri dishes that were treated with .28 ml of pure garlic oil; and when compared with the control, the results were found to be highly significant at the .005 level. Therefore, it was concluded that since the greatest strength of pure garlic oil had the largest colony growth prevention rate, that hypothesis 1 and hypothesis 2 were both supported.

THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT BROTHS ON PRODIGIOSIN PRODUCTION
Celina Padilla
John L. Chapin High School, El Paso Texas, U.S.

The purpose of this project was to find out which broth produced the most prodigiosin in Serratia marcescens. The production of prodigiosin in the S. marcescens bacteria is dependent on the nourishment it receives from the media it grows on. <br><br> To test which broth would produce the most prodigiosin, I grew S. marcescens in three different broths. The trypticase soy broth was used as the control because it’s typically used to grow S. marcescens in labs,while the sesame seed broth and peanut seed broth were my experimental groups. Each broth was kept at the same temperature and location, where there would be no interference from outside forces. The bacteria were grown in the classroom because it has been proven to grow best at room temperature (25 degrees Celsius). Because saturated fats are believed to help in the production of prodigiosin, my hypothesis is that the peanut seed broth, which contains the highest amount of saturated fat, will yield the most pigment.<br><br> The bacteria were allowed to grow for two days in each broth. The overall results (for the three trials) revealed that the peanut seed broth produced the most prodigiosin. The sesame seed broth produced the second highest, while the tripticase soy broth produced the least. These results show peanut seed broth as an inexpensive and efficient way of growing S. marcescens to produce higher amounts of prodigiosin. Scientists, who are finding that prodigiosin can possibly help fight cancer, can use these results to produce more prodigiosin for their experiments. <br><br>

OLD TRADITIONS: NEW APPLICATIONS CHARACTERIZATION OF PLANTS AS PROTEASE INHIBITORS
Eris Paige Moore
Woodlin School, Woodrow CO, USA

Biofilm is sticky ooze made of polysaccharides that bacteria release in response to the density of cells around them. Once this crititcal cell density is reached, bacteria communicate using molecular signals, also known as "quorum sensing" The goal of this project is to determine if extracts from collected plants, root exudates, and spices produce bioactive compounds that have anti-infective properties against Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAO1 using qualitative and quantitative assays. The researcher hypothesizes that the spices Turmeric and Goldenseal will show both quantitative and qualitative inhibition of bacteria strain PAO1. Four assays were performed: Anti-bacterial Disk Assay, Protease Qualitative Plant Assay, Protease Qualitative Plate Assay, and a Protease Quantitative Spectrometer Assay. The results showed that Goldenseal inhibited protease production by 33% or .570.

ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE: A STUDY OF THE AFFECT OF GENETIC MARKERS USED IN BIOENGINEERED FOODS
Andrew Scott Fritzler
Merino High School, Merino Colorado, United States

Bioengineered corn contains antibiotic resistant markers. These markers are used to test corn cells to be sure they are bioengineered. A recent concern dealing with these markers, are that they may actually be transferred from the crop to the consumer. This transfer could actually then cause antibiotic resistance in the bacteria of the consumer host. The purpose of the study is to see if genetically engineered contains antibiotic resistant markers that could transfer into the bacteria of the cockroach. The researcher hypothesized that the antibiotic resistant marker in the genetically engineered corn will be transferred from the corn to the bacteria in the intestine of the cockroach.<br><br>The researcher began by placing sixty cockroaches into three groups of twenty. The groups were fed the following diets: non-modified field corn (control), genetically engineered field corn that was bioengineered to be herbicide resistant (experimental), a mixture of half of each type of corn (experimental #2). The cockroaches were fed for 21 days. Two cockroaches out of the genetic engineered group and non-modified group were then dissected to obtain the bacteria from the midgut. A Kirby Bauer Sensitivity Test was run using Kanamycin, Ampicillin, and Penicillin antibiotics.<br><br>All cockroaches in the experimental group were found to show resistance to Kanamycin and some to Ampicillin. None of the cockroaches in the control group showed antibiotic resistance to either Kanamycin or Ampicillin. All cockroaches in both groups were found to show resistance to penicillin. <br><br>

BIOLOGICALLY POTENT BROAD SPECTRUM ANTIBIOTICS OBTAINED FROM TETRODOTOXIN-RICH ORGANS OF PUFFER FISHES (ARATHRON HISPIDUS, ARATHRON MANILLENSIS, CHELENODON PATOCA)
Joey Dacula Mangadlao
Agusan del Sur National High School (San Francisco, Agusan del Sur, Philippines)

Puffer fishes (locally known as “botete” in the Philippines) are considered as trash by fishermen when caught in their nets because these are considered poisonous fishes. Puffers carry in their bodies tetrodotoxin, a well-studied toxin, which is being explored as a pain killer at present.<br><br>This study investigates the antimicrobial potential of extracts derived from the liver, gonads, intestines and skin of three identified species of puffer fish (Arathron hispidus, Arathron manillensis, Chelenodon patoca).<br><br>Crude acidified methanol extracts through RotaVap were treated to eight selected microorganisms namely S. aureus, B. cereus, K. pneumoniae, E. coli, T. mentagrophytes, A. niger, C. albicans and S. cerevisiae using filter paper disc assay.<br><br>Zones of inhibition (mm) were measured and computed in terms of microbial index and compared with the standard antibacterial drugs, Chloramphenicol, Erythromycin and antifungal drug, Nystatin. DPPH assay was also conducted to test the antioxidant or free radical scavenging activity of extracted puffer fish organs.<br><br>Data analysis revealed that there were no significant differences among the antimicrobial effects of the three identified species of puffer fish crude extracts and Chloramphenicol, Erythromycin as well as Nystatin. Therefore, the antibacterial and antifungal activities of the organ extracts were significantly comparable to commercially available antibiotics. DPPH assay result showed only 24% inhibition.<br><br>The findings confirmed that tetrodotoxin-rich organ extracts from puffer fish possess potent broad spectrum antimicrobial activities that can be used as an alternative means of curing pathogenic infections, and thus, can be an abundant natural source in the production of commercial antibiotics. <br><br>

EFFECTS OF GOLDENSEAL ON PLASMID-INDUCED, AMPICILLIN-RESISTANT, ESCHERICHIA COLI HB101
Sarah Jayne Harshman
Mount de Chantal Visitation Academy, Wheeling WV, USA

Antibiotic-resistant forms of bacteria are a growing problem of global proportions. Scientists must look to other options for treating these resistant bacteria. Phytomedicines may be an option, and have been used as folk remedies for thousands of years. The feasibility of utilizing phytomedicines as an alternative or complement to traditional antibiotic therapies was investigated. The effects of the phytomedicine Goldenseal (Hydrastis canedenis), popularly touted as effective in inhibiting growth of a variety of bacteria, upon Escherichia coli HB101 were determined. E. coli HB101 was transformed with the engineered plasmid pGLO™ using a calcium chloride heat shock procedure. Resultant transformants were resistant to ampicillin and expressed green fluorescent protein when exposed to arabinose. Transformants were cultured with varying concentrations of Goldenseal in the presence of arabinose with or without ampicillin. Effect of Goldenseal was determined by standard colony count technique. Results indicated efficacy of Goldenseal against antibiotic resistant E. coli HB101. Additionally, results were suggestive of a Goldenseal-mediated reduction in the level of ampicillin resistance.

EFFECT OF OREGANO, PATCHOULI, CEDARWOOD AND TEA TREE NATURAL OILS ON THE GROWTH INHIBITION OF STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS AND ESCHERICHIA COLI
Bryan Rivera-Garcia
De La Salle School Bayamon, Puerto Rico

Natural oils or resins are extracted from medicinal plants used to prevent and cure physical and emotional illnesses. There are a great variety of natural oils that tends to show antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and fungicidal properties among others. The purpose of this research was to demonstrate if the resins from oregano, tea tree, patchouli and cedar wood can inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli that caused skin diseases as impetigo and severe bloody diarrhea respectively. The natural oils were bought in a botanical store. The resins were labeled as 100% pure. S. aureus and E. coli were inoculated in blood agar media. Paper disks were impregnated with all four resins and were placed in each of the Petri dishes. Control groups with each bacterium were labeled as "growth promotion" plates. All the plates were incubated for 48 hours at 35° C. Oregano oil inhibited both growth of S. aureus and E. coli, patchouli and cedar wood oils inhibited the growth of S. aureus but not E. coli. Tea tree oil inhibited E. coli but doesn't inhibit S. aureus. The result tends to indicate that oregano oil can be used to prevent serious illnesses due to S. aureus or E. coli. In a near future the researcher pretends to investigate the potential of this resin as an active ingredient in household disinfectants.

THE EFFECT OF ANTIBIOTIC EXPOSURE ON THE EMERGENCE OF RESISTANCE IN STREPTOCOCCUS PNEUMONIAE
Anne Helene Karam 
St. Joseph's Academy, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, United States of America 

It has been acknowledged that there are increasing patterns of resistance to antibiotics and this resistance may be a result of antibiotic exposure. To understand the potential risk for antibiotics to select for resistance in bacteria that are most likely to cause respiratory infections, the effect of antibiotic exposure on the emergence of resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae was studied. Isolates of S. pneumoniae were exposured to a subinhibitory concentration of antibiotic to determine if resistant strains would emerge, and if so, which drug class caused the most resistance after exposure. In this experiment, six isolates of S. pneumoniae with intermediate or full resistance to penicillin G were obtained from microbiology laboratories in two hospitals. Baseline susceptibilities were found on each isolate using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Each of the six isolates was then exposed to subinhibitory concentrations of six different antibiotics for 48 hours. After exposure, a second susceptibility test on the isolates was performed to determine whether there was a change in susceptibility. After exposure to a fluoroquinolone (specifically ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin), resistant strains emerged to both the antibiotic to which it was exposed and to other fluoroquinolones. Due to the low activity of ciprofloxacin against S. pneumoniae, it could kill the sensitive strains of the bacteria but not the resistant strains, which caused the resistant strains to emerge. In conclusion, exposure of S. pneumoniae to a fluoroquinolone has the potential to select strains to emerge with resistance to both that fluoroquinolone and also to others in its drug class. No statistically significant changes in susceptibility to any of the other antibiotics tested were noted. The potential for antibiotic exposure to lead to resistance is important in our world with increasing bacterial resistance but no development of new classes of antibiotics to treat these resistance pathogens.

EFFECT OF ORGANIC FARMING ON BACTERIA COLONIZING BEANS, CARROTS, AND LETTUCE
Carrie Calkins Rethlefsen
Winona Senior High School, Winona, MN, USA

PURPOSE: Examine the bacteria colonizing beans, carrots, and lettuce from organic farming. Phase One: Recover and characterize the bacteria. Phase Two: Evaluate the bacteria’s potential as pathogens. Phase Three: Compare and contrast the susceptibility of the bacteria to antibiotics. METHODS: Purchase organic and inorganic vegetables from local grocers. Ten grams of each produce was combined with 90 ml of water (1:9). Serial dilutions were made with water from 10-1 - 10-10. Bacteria were quantitated by culture on plate count agar (PCA). In addition starch-ampicillin plates (SA), eosin-methylene blue plates (EMB), and phenyl ethyl-alcohol plates with sheep blood (PEA) were used to characterize the bacteria. Bacterial colonies from EMB plates were cultured on PEA plates and a single colony of each phenotype was analyzed by API 20E strips according to the manufactures directions. A Kirby Bauer disk diffusion method was used to detect the susceptibility of the bacteria to antibiotics. Antibiotic disks were placed onto the agar and the zones of inhibition were recorded after incubation at 37oC for twenty-four hours. RESULTS: Generally, higher concentrations were recovered from organic produce. Gram-positive bacteria were not recovered. Aeromonas spp. was not detected. A similar variety of bacteria were recovered from both types of produce. Detection of Enterobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter baumannii required 10 days of incubation. Bacteria recovered from organic and inorganic produce had similar capacity to cause human illness. Bacteria that commonly cause gastroenteritis were not recovered. The bacteria recovered from inorganic produce appeared more resistant than bacteria from organic produce.

ANTIMICROBIAL PROPERTIES OF HIDE TANNING SOLUTIONS
Brian Keith Holmes
Dupree High School, Dupree South Dakota, USA

When tanning hides, some solutions do not adequately kill all of the bacteria present on the hide. For this reason I chose to test the antimicrobial properties of four common hide tanning solutions. Bacteria on the hide causes the hair to slip once the tanning process is completed, leading to a loss of money. <br><br> The first thing I did was gather the materials that I needed to perform my experiment. I then poured a nutrient agar into five Petri dishes. After they set up for 24 hours, I plated bacterial species Serratia marcescans and Sarcain lutea on the agar. I then placed the Petri dishes in the incubator and let them grow for 48 hours. After this time interval was up, I soaked four filter disks in each of the four solutions I chose to test. I then placed the soaked disks in the Petri dishes and recorded any change for five days.<br><br> In conclusion, EZ 100 proved to have the best antimicrobial properties. It killed microbes within 2.25 mm. of the soaked filter disks. Curatan came in second killing microbes within 1.25 mm. after five days. Trappers Hide Tanning Formula was third killing 0.8 mm. and Snaketan came in a far last killing microbes within only 0.25 mm. of the soaked disks.<br><br>

THE PATHOLOGICAL EFFECT OF BACTERIA ON MUSCLE TISSUE
Jessica L Miles
duPont Manual High School, Louisville, KY, USA

Muscle infections, which include the “flesh-eating disease” necrotizing fasciitis, are caused by bacteria that inhabit and destroy tissue, leading to illness and death. These infections can be devastating to hospitalized patients and are associated high mortality and amputation rates. This project investigated bacteria-induced changes in the structure of muscle over time. For 12 days, muscle sections from chicken meat were sectioned and stained to observe their decomposition. Additionally, bacteria from the muscle were cultured onto blood agar, counted, and identified using information from a gram stain in conjunction with the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System, which identifies organisms by testing their biochemical composition. This was done to facilitate the identification of bacterial invasion mechanisms. It was hypothesized that the bacteria would decompose the muscle over time, with decomposition correlating with the expiration date of the meat and paralleling bacterial growth.<br><br> The muscle was considerably degraded by the growth of bacteria. Bacteria eventually colonized the muscle cells causing widespread necrosis and tissue destruction that resembled necrotizing fasciitis. Moreover, evidence of decay and bacterial growth was present before the expiration date of the meat. The growth of these organisms was facilitated by several specific invasins and exotoxins, which were identified through research and information from the biochemical analyses of Enterococcus gallinarum, Vibrio metschnikovii, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Aeromonas sobria. These results supported the hypothesis.

METASTABLE CONFORMATIONS IN THE SECONDARY STRUCTURE OF THE POLY(A) SIGNAL IN HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS TYPE-1
Alan Ho-Yin Gee
Frederick High, Frederick, MD, USA

RNA folding predictions have become increasingly important in investigating viral function. Within the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1), the highly conserved sequence at both the 5' and 3' end called the polyadenylation (poly(A)) signal (AAUAAA) is essential for effective replication. When the viral RNA is ready for polyadenylation, the 5' signal is inhibited while the 3' poly(A) signal is active for cleavage and elongation with adenine bases. To examine the differential use of the signals, the structural tendencies of both the 5' and 3' poly(A) signals in HIV-1 were studied. <br><br> <br><br> The massively parallel genetic algorithm (GA) predicts several RNA secondary structural intermediates of a given sequence based on biological theories of evolution and survival of the fittest. Using the GA, several HIV-1 sequences from different subtypes were folded. Statistical tests of normality were applied to analyze the distribution of the various structures and poly(A) motifs. <br><br> <br><br> Through computational predictions of several HIV-1 sequences using the GA, the 5' poly(A) signal is found to be dominantly occluded in a hairpin stem-loop while the 3' poly(A) signal has a propensity to be expressed in a linear motif with the initial two adenine bases exposed in an asymmetric internal loop. In addition, the energies of the structures indicate that the poly(A) signal is a metastable structure that has the ability to switch conformations. This switch can potentially change the function of the viral RNA. (i.e. genomic RNA or mRNA).<br><br>

KINETIC ANALYSIS OF VIRAL FUSION USING PEPTIDE INHIBITORS
Amanda Kay Leatherman
Urbana High School, Ijamsville, Maryland, USA

The newest class of antiretroviral drugs developed target the viral entry process of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). The most clinically advanced of these drugs is a fusion peptide inhibitor called T20, which binds to an intermediate structure on the viral envelope protein. As it is important to understand the mechanism and kinetics by which these drugs work, I developed a cell-cell fusion assay that reflects the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) fusion process. This assay system involves the co-culture of viral envelope-expressing cells with cells that express CD4, the main receptor for HIV, along with the appropriate coreceptor. As all the molecular components are present to mimic viral fusion, these cells when co-cultured in close proximity interact with each other and fuse. This facilitates analysis of how inhibitors such as T20 inhibit fusion. I employed the envelope protein of a Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) isolate (SIVMac251), which is genetically and functionally similar to HIV. By analyzing the temporal resistance of this co-culture system to inhibitors, the kinetics of fusion and exposure of potential inhibitor targets were identified. These experiments indicate that SIV proceeds rapidly to coreceptor engagement and six-helix bundle formation resulting in fusion. Therefore, peptides that target intermediate envelope structures on SIV have a much shorter window of opportunity to bind and inhibit than is the case for HIV. <br><br>

ANALYSIS OF MUTATIONS IN THE AMP PATHWAY IN SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE
Alexander Michael Hincker
Roanoke Valley Governor's School for Science and Technology, Roanoke VA, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effects of exposure to UV-C radiation on mutation at various gene loci in the HA2 and HB2 strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It was hypothesized that mutations will occur more at some gene loci than at others. The genes studied in this experiment were those involved in the AMP pathway, a biochemical pathway that produces the chemical (AMP) from which the cell derives adenine, an essential nucleotide. The experimental yeast possess a red color due to an ade2 mutation in the pathway; induced mutations earlier in the pathway leave the yeast white.<br><br> Yeast cells on YED agar were irradiated with UV-C radiation for one minute. Mutants of each breeding type (a and alpha) were collected from each plate and were interbred. White colonies resulted from crosses of yeast cells with mutations at the same loci.<br><br>The results support the hypothesis. There were 19 mutations at site 1, three mutations at site 2, one mutation at site 3, and nine mutations at site 4. Mutations that occurred more frequently may have indicated chromosome sections more susceptible to disruption by UV-C radiation. Alternatively, certain mutations may have been more conducive to survival because mutations earlier in the pathway may have saved the yeast from using energy to make additional products in the pathway. Conversely, the yeast may benefit from having mutations that occur later in the pathway if the additional chemicals produced acted as intermediaries in other metabolic pathways necessary to survival.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF NUTRIENT RUNOFF ON THE DINOFLAGELLATE PROROCENTRUM MICANS
Erica Marie Rutherford
Central VA Governor's School/Appomattox Country HS, Appomattox, VA

The purpose of this study was to find what effects chemical fertilizer, nitrates, and simulated pasture runoff have on the growth of Prorocentrum micans. Cultures of P. micans (obtained from Center for the Culture of Marine Phytoplankton) were set up in L1 seawater media erlenmeyer flasks. There were four groups of two cultures each; nitrates, simulated pasture runoff, chemical fertilizer, and control cultures. Each culture from the experimental groups had nutrients added to it. Two trials were done in this way. Measuring the populations was done by counting dinoflagellates under a microscope using a Sedgewick-Rafter slide. One milliliter from each culture was counted each time data was collected. The first trial was done for 36 days, and the second for 43 days. The second lasted longer due to less total growth. Because of a lack of space, the first trial was closer to the light and received more light than the second one (mean of 276.7 lux as opposed to 42.5 lux), making it hard to compare the two trials. In trial 1, the simulated pasture runoff had the highest mean of 251 organisms/mL on one day, followed by the control group, having a highest mean of 240. The nitrate cultures were about the same as the control in the second trial, but in trial 1, there was no fluctuation. The chemical fertilizer appeared to inhibit growth in this species.

ATTENUATION: A NOVEL APPROACH TO THE CONTROL OF BACTERIAL WILT
Xinmiao Xie
Fuzhou No.1 Middle School, Fuzhou, Fujian, China

Bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum Smith (RS) is a disease widely distributed in the world, and a major constraint on production of many crops. Screening antagonistic bacteria is a research hotspot for its biocontrol. However, the density of antagonistic bacteria often decreases rapidly in the soil environment, which leads to the reproduction of the residue of RS and causes the death of plants. <br><br>The attenuation effect of bacteria on RS transformed virulent RS into avirulent RS. This research used this new approach to control bacterial wilt. To obtain ideal "attenuation bacteria", a screening system consisting of the following three steps was constructed: chromogenic reaction of TTC cultural medium, bioassay of tissue culture seedling and PCR analysis, which isolated attenuation bacteria from biochemical, ecological and genetical aspects. The advantage of this approach is that avirulent RS can continuously inhibit the growth of virulent RS after the effect of attenuation bacteria has weakened, thereby avoiding recrudescence of the disease.<br><br>Through this approach, a new kind of attenuation bacterium was obtained. Its attenuation indexes to virulent RS isolated from tomato, pimiento, tobacco and eggplant plants were 91, 87, 84 and 93%. It was identified as Bacillus sphaericus ANTI-8098B (DSMZ). This research also described its growth curve and studied the attenuation indexes under different conditions. The attenuation substance produced by ANTI-8098B was found in the extracellular suspension. The attenuated RS had an inhibitory effect on virulent RS. The control efficiency of ANTI-8098B against bacterial wilt of tomatoes in greenhouse was 92.8%.<br><br>

NO THANKS, I'LL USE MY OWN PEN A COMPARISON OF BACTERIA ON THE SURFACE OF PENS IN PHARMACIES AND STORES
Chris Michael Jenkins
South River High School, Edgewater, Maryland, USA

The purpose of this science fair project was to (1) determine the bacterial contamination level of pens used by customers in stores and pharmacies, and (2) to find out if my ballpoint pens had fewer or more bacteria. A total of 14 locations, including 6 pharmacies, were chosen for this study. In each location regular ballpoint pens or electronic pens were swabbed for bacteria. The swabs were put in sterile media, taken back to the laboratory, and inoculated onto nutrient agar plates. The plates were examined for growth of bacterial colonies over the next 3 days. This procedure was repeated for 2 more days for 8 pens to see if the type and number of bacteria on the pens changed over time. The pens that I regularly use in school were also swabbed and analyzed for bacteria over a 3-day period. A portion of each bacterial colony that grew on the agar plates was then transferred to glass slides, treated with Gram stain, and examined under the microscope to determine their morphology and whether the microbes were Gram positive or Gram negative. Of the 48 swabs analyzed from the 14 locations, 34 were contaminated with bacteria, while 14 did not appear to have bacteria on the surface. There was no real difference between pharmacies and stores in the number of pens that were contaminated. Also, no bacteria grew from my 3 pens. While there were many different kinds of bacteria on the pens, the most common were gram positive cocci.

TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING?
Benjamin Matthew Tatum
Glenwood High School, Chatham, IL, USA

Research indicates glucose and peptone are both essential for colony growth. If fungus is deprived of either, colonies suffer. The purpose of this experiment was to determine how increasing concentrations of peptone (nitrogen) or glucose (carbon) influence growth of Penicillium notatum and identify which is more the important limiting factor of growth.<br><br> Varying amounts of glucose or peptone were mixed with water and agar into flasks. Peptone and glucose series had their specific nutrient concentrations increased above the standard Sabouraud agar. After being autoclaved, the solutions were poured into Petri dishes, inoculated with Penicillium notatum in a bio-safety cabinet, and sealed. The plates were incubated at room temperature in the dark. Color, density, texture, and colony diameter were measured every seven days. The average daily growth rate was calculated, and comparisons were made.<br><br> In the peptone variable series, the average daily growth rate plateaued. Colony color lightened and ridges appeared as concentrations increased, with a possible negative aberration at 4.5%, and an increase at 6% peptone concentration. In the glucose variable series, the growth rates plateaued, with declines at 6.5%, 7.5%, 8.5% glucose, a somewhat noticeable increase at 7% glucose, and lesser increases at 5.5% and 6% glucose. Colonies lightened and uneven growth was observed. A standard deviation analysis of growth rates in both series found no significant differences.<br><br> In both series, the hypothesis was rejected, suggesting that Penicillium notatum was not greatly affected by increases in concentrations of either peptone or glucose at the levels measured in this experiment.<br><br>

DO LICHENS HAVE ANTIMICROBIAL PROPERTIES?
Rebecca Renee Alexander
Grants High School; Grants, New Mexico, USA

The purpose of this project is to see if Lichens have antimicrobial properties which could be used for making antibiotics. The hypothesis is all the Lichens will have some antibacterial properties.<br><br> Experiments using lichen extracts to test for antimicrobial properties were conducted on Bacillus subtilis gram (+) and Serratia marcescens gram (-) bacteria. Extracts were soaked onto sterile paper discs and placed on cultures of each bacteria. In disc diffusion tests 1–12 the lichen extracts were unable to affect the growth of Serratia marcescens but inhibited the growth of Bacillus subtilis. In test 13, a third bacteria was added, Escherichia coli gram (-), all samples did inhibit the Bacillus subtilis and samples 7, 8, and 9 had zones of inhibition for Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli.<br><br> In experiments 1–12, sample 8 a fruticose produced the best zone of inhibition averaging 15.65 mm. Samples 2, 3, and 5 with approximately 15mm zones of inhibition, show potential as an antimicrobial agent. Samples 1, 4, 6, and 9 had smaller zones of inhibition. Sample 7, showed no results in these experiments. In experiment 13, samples 7, 8, and 9 showed the first zones of inhibition for gram (-), Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli. In experiment 14, all samples had zones of inhibition against all the bacteria. In experiment 15, using discs from Paper Chromatography only samples 1, 2, 3, and 8 had zones.<br><br> The hypothesis was correct, as the lichens have shown antibacterial properties for both gram (+), and gram (-) bacteria.<br><br>

CONVENTIONAL VS. ORGANIC GROUND BEEF AN ANALYSIS OF TWO UNIQUE PROCESSING METHODS
Liana Soussan Ksaibati
Laramie Senior High School; Laramie, Wyoming; USA

<br><br> The market for organic foods has significantly grown in recent years. Organic foods cover everything from dairy to meat, produce to baked goods. The term ‘organic’ requires that dairy, meat, and poultry products come from livestock that have been raised without the use of hormones and antibiotics, and have been restricted from being fed animal by-products. <br><br> Compared to organic, the conventional methods of growing, handling and processing seem negligent or even risky. However, both forms must meet the same quality and safety standards in accordance with the USDA.<br><br> Since organic and conventional foods are both safe, why are some people willing to pay more money for products with the organic label? The purpose of this experiment is to chemically examine each product (conventional and organic ground beef), and compare based on various content ratios: protein, fat, and moisture content. Even more importantly, a microbial analysis will be conducted of organic and conventional ground beef to find the product that is truly safer.<br><br> The experiments followed procedures according to common practices, and took place in a sufficiently equipped microbiology lab. Meticulous care was taken in preventing contamination, and detailed data was collected from the samples. Results conclude that conventional and organic ground beef have few differences in terms of protein, fat, and moisture content. However, a remarkably higher CFU (colony forming units) of bacteria were found in the organic beef samples, revealing the conventionally processed beef to be the safer product. <br><br>

A STUDY OF THE PRESENCE OF ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANT BACTERIA IN FITNESS CENTERS AND THEIR SUSCEPTIBILITY TO A VARIETY OF ANTIBIOTICS
Jillian Rae Schroeder
Latta High School, Ada, OK, USA

The purpose of this project was to determine whether antibiotic resistant bacteria were present in public health fitness centers and to determine their degree of sensitivity to six different commonly used antibiotics: penicillin, ampicillin, streptomycin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline. The hypothesis was that a significant percentage of the bacteria present in fitness centers would be resistant and they would vary in their degrees of resistance to the antibiotics. Also, it was further hypothesized that greater numbers of bacteria would be resistant to penicillin, since it is the oldest known antibiotic. <br><br> Ten machines were swabbed from the fitness center and the bacteria were streaked onto LB plates. After incubation, five morphologically different colonies were chosen from each plate and cultured in LB broth. The bacteria cultures were added to soft agar and poured onto LB plates. The antibiotic disks from the six different antibiotics were placed onto the plates in a circular pattern. <br><br> After 24 hours the zones of inhibition from the antibiotic disks were measured and classified as resistant, intermediate, and susceptible according to the zone radii specified by the Antimicrobic Susceptibility Test System. The results showed that there was indeed a large number of bacteria that were resistant to one or more of the antibiotics. Also, more bacteria cultures exhibited high resistance to the penicillin (32%) and ampicillin (34%) as was hypothesized.<br><br>

EFFECT OF HGF-MET MODULATION ON INFECTION OF MOUSE HEPA1-6 CELLS BY PLASMODIUM YOELII
Minghao Liu
Bronx High School of Science

Malaria targets thousands of children in third-world countries. Recently, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was characterized as a susceptibility-inducing factor for Plasmodium berghei (mouse strain) infection in human HepG2 cells. The current research project seeks to determine if secretion of HGF and activation of its receptor (MET) also make mouse hepatocytes more susceptible to Plasmodium yoelii (mouse strain) sporozoites. To test the hypothesis, HGF was inactivated with anti-hHGF, which seemed to reduce P. yoelii infection. These results later proved to be invalid. A dose-response experiment showed that the concentration of anti-hHGF has little correlation with P. yoelii infection. The HGF-MET system was then stimulated with DO-24, a full MET agonist. Comparison to control showed that the increase in infection rate of DO-24 treated cells was not statistically significant. These results suggest that the HGF-MET system does not aid in P. yoelii infection and thus P. yoelii must utilize an alternate signaling system. The same might be true of P. falciparum, the most lethal human Plasmodium strain, for which P. yoelii is a good model.

DEVELOPMENT AND STANDARDIZATION OF A NOVEL APPROACH TO DETECT THE INFECTIOUS TRANSMISSIBLE SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPAHTIC PRION CONTENT IN PARAFFIN-EMBEDDED TISSUES
Megan Lakshmi Srinivas
Fort Dodge Senior High, Fort Dodge, IA, USA

The recent re-emergence of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) in livestock has proven to be a significant threat to human health on the global level. Present-day research is restricted to utilizing either fresh or frozen tissues for many informative analytical procedures. The overall goal of the current study is to develop and standardize a method utilizing paraffin-embedded tissues (PET) in western blot analysis in order to attain glycoform profiles from PET samples, detailed information unavailable through current methods of analyzing PET samples. Since there is an extremely close similarity between the procedures of the western and dot blot analyses, the first step towards developing a western blot procedure with PET is to develop a consistently accurate dot blot protocol. The results presented here show that a successful dot blot utilizing PET samples is feasible. The future directions of this research will concentrate on adapting the current findings in the standardization of the western blot procedure to increase the sensitivity and specificity of detection of prion proteins in the tissue samples. The results of the ongoing studies also indicated that one of the main hindrances in the standardization of a sensitive western blot method has been the clumping of tissue, preventing the prion proteins to be electrophoresed. By minimizing the size and varying the thermal treatment of the tissue in the homogenate, the electrophoresis vital to the western blot procedure should run successfully.

MICROBIAL TREATMENT BY CINNAMON CONSUMPTION
Aaron Michael Osentoski
Northwestern High School, Kokomo, Indiana, USA

The purpose of this project was to determine if mixtures containing ground cinnamon, cinnamon sticks, or Big Red cinnamon chewing gum would kill Serratia marcescens. Procedures included the use of a modified Kirby-Bauer method to test for the number of colonies and for the size of ring of inhibition. Saturated sterile disks for three cinnamon mixtures at four different concentrations were tested on four different bacterial dilutions on nutrient agar which was inoculated with the given percent of Serratia marcescens dilution. A 100% inhibition occurred with half of the 4% mixtures at a 0.1% bacterial dilution. The second largest colony inhibition occurred with the 4% Big Red mixture with a 1% bacterial dilution resulting in an average of 22 colonies per dish. The maximum effectiveness occurred with the bacterial dilution of the stock at 0.1% with both the ground cinnamon/water mixture and the cinnamon stick/water mixture. Each contained four grams of ground cinnamon or cinnamon stick separately steeped in 100 mL of boiled water for 24 hours. Big Red gum had a general tendency to decrease the number of colonies when the concentration increased to four grams of Big Red gum steeped in 100 mL of boiled water for 24 hours. In conclusion, as the cinnamon concentration and bacterial dilution were increased, the resulting inhibition increased. Cinnamon is, therefore, bacteriostatic as it reduces the growth of dilute bacterial concentrations of Serratia marcescens but does not kill it completely.

BIOFILMS: DANGEROUS YEAST FORMATIONS
Allison Helena Humble
Gig Harbor High School, Gig Harbor, Washington, United States of America

The purpose of the project is to grow yeast formations on medical implants, to represent biofilm attachments in the body, which can cause infections and complications in patients with prosthetic devices. My idea was to see if different yeast strains would adhere to several surface types of implants. <br><br> Cell-to-surface adhesion must be present to initiate the biofilm formation. The observations were made over the course of several weeks in incubation. The yeasts were first grown in the incubator, then transferred to the surfaces and grown there. The different surfaces were stained with crystal violet, rinsed, and recorded via observation and photographs. My data was measured in percentages by measuring the original growth, and then the remaining growth after it was rinsed. <br><br> The two types of yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae were used. They had both been selected for presence of a specific glycoprotein. The presence of glucose 2% was also critical in the adherence to the plastic surfaces as well as the metal parts. <br><br> The results supported my hypothesis and surface texture played a large part with the adhesion process. My results showed that the rougher the texture, the greater percent of adhesion. <br><br> The presence of glycoprotein in yeast strains was the key to the yeast adhesion. The ability to study yeast in the laboratory and the different environmental variables can help lead scientists to research anti-fungal therapies and preventative medications and procedures with regard to medical implants and devices.<br><br>

USE OF PROBIOTIC BACTERIA TO INHIBIT THE GROWTH OF PATHOGENIC BACTERIA
Cory John Millmier
Central Lee High School, Donnellson, IA United States

Pathogenic bacteria are harmful bacteria that can cause intestinal problems and even death. Probiotic bacteria are beneficial bacteria that can aid in the health of the intestinal tract. Laboratory testing was done to determine the ability of selected probiotic bacteria to inhibit the growth of selected pathogenic bacteria. Pathogens used were E. coli O157:H7, Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella sonnie, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Salmonella Enteritidis. Probiotics used were Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium longum B6, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG.<br><br> Pathogenic bacteria solution (0.1 mL) was spread across PCA agar. Two wells were made in the PCA for each probiotic bacteria solution and 0.1 mL of the solution was placed in each well. Wells were sealed with PCA and plates were incubated for 36 hours at 37oC. Areas of pathogenic growth inhibition were measured and recorded.<br><br> All probiotic bacteria were able to inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria. B. longum was not able to significantly inhibit S. sonnie. B. longum B6 was able to inhibit S. sonnie better than B. longum and L. paracasei. L. rhamnosus was able to inhibit S. aureus better than B. longum and L. paracasei. Pathogens were able to re-enter inhibition zones on some plates.<br><br> Further research will be needed to determine the most appropriate level of each probiotic versus each pathogen and to determine if utilization of probiotics in packaging materials is viable.

THE ROLE OF ARP8, A CHROMATIN REMODELING PROTEIN, IN DNA REPAIR AND ITS IMPLICATIONS TO CANCER
Aditya Krishna Denduluri
Saint Pius X Albuquerque, NM USA

The role of Arp8, a chromatin remodeling protein, was studied in DNA damage and repair. Defects in DNA damage and repair systems have been linked to cancer, heart disease, and aging. Since Arp8 alters chromatin, it was hypothesized that the absence of this protein affects DNA repair. Arp8 was deleted from a wildtype strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. DNA damage was induced by exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UV), hydroxyurea (HU), or methyl methonate sulfate. arp8 Delta (D) strains showed considerable sensitivity to UV and HU. The role of Arp8 in homologous recombination (HR), a DNA repair pathway, was also investigated. The HR studied was both break-induced and spontaneous. arp8D strains exhibited no major defect in HR. However, DNA repair tract lengths were longer than wildtype. An increase in long repair tracts has been linked to genome instability, which is related to tumorigenesis. In conclusion, Arp8 seems to play a significant role in DNA damage and repair systems. Thus, the absence or reduced expression of the protein Arp8 may be linked to the onset of various types of cancer and other diseases.

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TICKS AND A COMMON IMPERFECT FUNGUS, SCOPULARIOPSIS BREVICAULIS, FEATURING ITS LIFE CYCLE IN A TICK HOST
Seth Asa Murray
Northeastern High School/Wittenberg University, Springfield Ohio, USA

Scopulariopsis brevicaulis has been identified in the body contents of the American dog tick, Dermacentor variabilis, and the lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum. This study was to determine where the fungus resides in ticks, the mechanism of transmission and how the physiology of ticks may be affected by this symbiont. The presence of fungi was documented by standard culturing technique for deuteromycetes (imperfect fungi) in eggs and individual organs removed from ticks. Effects of the fungus on the tick were analyzed by the water loss rates, which are indicative of arthropod health. S. brevicaulis was recovered predominantly from cuticular glands in the dorsal idiosoma and the hemolymph. Based on the presence of mycelia in glands and conidia in hemolymph, a life cycle of S. brevicaulis has been established with fungal mycelia developing in the cuticular glands producing conidia both internally and externally. Interestingly, the weak immune system of the tick prevents internally released conidia from proliferating. Isolation of S. brevicaulis from eggs suggests that it is transmitted maternally, and then subsequently passed transtadially to larvae, nymphs, and adults. No effect on water loss rates was present after removing S. brevicualis, suggesting that neither the fungus nor the tick requires the other for survival. Clearly, the fungus benefits by this association, but the advantages for ticks harboring this fungus are unknown. In conclusion, S. brevicaulis does not require ticks for growth, but once established, the fungus can remain, causing little damage, through the tick’s entire lifecycle.

SELECTION OF ESSENTIAL OIL COMPONENTS TO INHIBIT CANDIDA WITHOUT AFFECTING NORMAL MICROBIOTA
Karli Oberg
Weber High School, Pleasant View, Utah, USA

The yeast, Candida albicans and Candida glabrata, are normal inhabitants of human gastrointestinal and genital tracts but can cause candidiasis infections (vaginal, oral, and skin) under certain circumstances. Previous research has shown that some plant essential oils have an inhibitory effect on fungi. This study was done to determine which essential oils and their individual components could be developed as a possible treatment for candidiasis. Fourteen essential oils were tested for inhibition of C. albicans and C. glabrata using the disk assay. Thirty individual components of the most effective essential oils were then selected and tested for Candida inhibition by the disk assay. All essential oils showed some inhibition with Mt. Savory, Lemongrass and Cinnamon Bark having the largest zones. Essential oil components with the largest zones of inhibition were citral, cinnamaldehyde, eugenol, perillaldehyde, terpineol, and carvacrol. When these components were tested for inhibition of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) representing human normal flora, cinnamaldhyde and citral were inhibitory, but heptanol, perillaldehyde, and furaldehyde did not inhibit LAB growth. Results indicate that a number of essential oil components have the potential to be used as a treatment for candidiasis without having an adverse effect on normal microbiota bacteria.<br><br>

THE ANTIMICROBIAL EFFECTS OF PLANT EXTRACTS
Melissa Marie Roark
Rosholt High School, Rosholt SD, USA

Purpose: To determine if bark and chemical extractions could kill Escherichia coli, Escherichia coli B, and Escherichia coli JM101 compared to Target Antibacterial Kitchen Cleaner, Wal-mart Great Value All Purpose Cleaner, Spic and Span, Formula 409, and Lysol. <br><br>Hypothesis: I thought the barks would kill the Escherichia coli, because Native Americans used barks for medicinal purposes. I also thought the disinfectants would kill a majority of the Escherichia coli.<br><br>Procedure: Prepared extractions using barberry, birch, buckthorn, slippery elm, wild cherry, and witch hazel bark. Water dilutions: 1.) Combined 1 gram of bark to 10 mL of distilled water. Chemical dilutions: 1.) Combined 1 gram of bark to 10 mL of chosen chemical: acetone, isopropyl alcohol, or methanol. 2.) Prepared test disks of extractions by evaporating the chemicals. Kirby Bauer method: 1.) Sectioned and numbered nutrient agar plates. 2.) Applied a type of Escherichia coli to the nutrient agar plates. 3.) Used a sterile forceps to place a sterile disk into the product. 4.) Placed the saturated disk on the corresponding number on the agar plate. 5.) Repeated this process for all products. 6.) Incubated the plates at 37 degrees Celsius. 7.) Measured inhibition zones and recorded the data. <br><br><br>Conclusion: Overall on all phases, the wild cherry bark with isopropyl alcohol dilution had the largest inhibition zone of 36.9 millimeters. Spic and Span was the leading disinfectant with an average inhibition zone of 34.3 millimeters.

THE EFFECTS OF ALLIUM SATIVUM, ALLIUM CEPA, AND ALLIUM SCHOENOPRASUM ON E.COLI, STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS, AND PSEUDOMONAS
Katherine May Coury
Port Huron Northern, Port Huron Michigan, United States of America

<br><br> I researched the effects of Allium Sativum (garlic), Allium Cepa (onion), and Allium Schoenoprasum (chives) on the growth Staphylococcus Aureus, Pseudomonas, and Escherichia Coli.<br><br> I hypothesized that Allium Sativum would have the most negative effect, Allium Cepa would have the second most detrimental effects, and the Allium Schoenoprasum would have the least negative effect on the bacteria.<br><br> Results showed that Allium Sativum had the most detrimental effects over all. It stopped the growth of each type of bacteria. Allium Cepa had the second most detrimental effects, but could only stop bacteria growth if applied immediately after infection. Allium Schoenoprasum had little to no effect on the bacteria. My results were limited because I had to discard the Pseudomonas dishes as the bacteria did not grow. Most of the Allium Schoenoprasum plates became infected with fungi. <br><br> Therefore, my hypothesis proved correct. There are several possible reasons for Allium Sativum’s and Allium Cepa’s successes. Because all three plants are in the same genus, they may have similar active chemicals. Their structural differences may account for their different effects on the bacteria. Allium Cepa possibly did not work as well as Allium Sativum because it contains more water than Allium Sativum, diluting the active chemical. Allium Schoenoprasum’s active chemical may have been even less concentrated being diffused throughout the plant, rather than concentrated in a bulb structure. It may have been contaminated because it is not protected by dry skins such of those of Allium Cepa and Allium Sativum. <br><br>

THE ANTIBACTERIAL EFFECTS OF PLANTS FOUND IN SOUTHERN ARIZONA ON STAPHYLOCOCCUS EPIDERMIDIS AND SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE
Kalie Rae Heideman
Buena High School, Sierra Vista Az, USA

As antibiotics are used, bacterial cells begin resisting the antibiotic and survive, passing on their genes, and crating an entire strain of bacteria that is resistant to that ntibiotic. I tested my plant extracts on Staphylococcus epidermidis (prokaryotic cells). I chose this bacterium because some strains of S. epidermidis are pathogenic. They are in the same genus as the most common organism that causes incision infections in hospitals, Staphylococcus aureus. I also tested the plant extracts against Saccharomyces cerevisiae which is baker's yeast. It is a eukaryote, the same type of cell found in humans. If the plants did not inhibit these cells, then they should be safe for human use.<br><br>I tested different concentrations of each decoction: a 400%, 200%, and 100% concentration. There were two sets of tests, which were set up exactly the same for both S. epidermidis and S. cerevisiae. I inoculated the concentrations of the decoctions with either S. cerevisiae or S. epidermidis. I calculated the percent of transmission by using a colorimeter. I verified the results by inoculating agar the same way and placing disks of paper saturated by 800% concentrations of the decoctions on the agar.<br><br>According to the results found by the colorimeter, the best decoction was Eucalyptus. It was effective against S. epidermidis while not being a detriment to S. cerevisiae. The verification with the disks did confirm the results from the colorimeter about Eucalyptus, but it also revealed that Desert Broom is almost as effective as Eucalyptus.<br><br>

“COLLOIDAL SILVER: THE DANGEROUS CURE” EFFECTIVENESS OF COLLOIDAL SILVER AS COMPARED TO PRESCRIPTION ANTIBIOTICS.
Jana Mae Marie Hill
Grove High School, Grove, OK USA

Colloidal silver is a fluid containing silver particles that is used as an alternative antibiotic for medicinal purposes. Research has proven that ingestion of too much colloidal silver can result in argyria. Argyria is a blue-grayish discoloration of the skin that is dangerous and irreversible. <br><br> <br><br>Colloidal silver is being sold in health fold stores and on web sites as an effective antibiotic. Research has shown that ingestion of colloidal silver can cause irreversible side effects. Are prescribed antibiotics just as or more effective than colloidal silver when tested on Escherichia coli bacteria?<br><br>Colloidal silver was compared to amoxicillin and erythromycin when tested on Escherichia coli. Meuller Hinton agar Petri dishes were used to grow the Escherichia coli. An incubator was used to heat the plates and make the Escherichia coli grow to read the results. The rings of inhibition were measured in full diameter in millimeters. <br><br>Colloidal silver is not as effective as prescribed antibiotics. It didn’t kill any bacteria in any of the four tests that were conducted. Amoxicillin killed the most, with erythromycin next. People are being sold this product, not knowing the dangers, and they end up in a bad condition. This product should not be used to treat any infection, if it won’t kill Escherichia coli.<br><br>

A BACTERIA CAULDRON
Jennifer L Rhinesmith
Del Rio Freshman School, Del Rio, Texas, United States of America

"A Bacteria Cauldron", designed to investigate the P-Trap, is an experiment that ascertains the bacterial state of the common household sink. It determines whether the P-Trap, the U-shaped pipe under your sink, is conductive for the growth of potentially harmful bacteria, and assesses what household cleansers would deter such growth. <br><br> A sample of bacteria was extracted from under a household sink using a sterile inoculating loop. After diluting the contaminant in five milliliters of water, five Petri dishes were inoculated, leaving one as a control and using the other four to test selected household cleansers (409, Clorox, Pinesol, Lysol). Four two-by-two centimeter squares were cut from sterile gauze, and each was saturated in a separate cleanser. Each square was then placed inside a dish and all five were incubated for forty-eight hours. Bacterial growth was observed, and Gram’s stains were performed to determine whether the organisms in each dish were gram-positive or gram-negative.<br><br> The results of my Gram's stains were thus: all resulted gram-negative with the exception of one. Ergo, gram-negative organisms, which are more often the cause of diseases, are prevalent against gram-positive organisms in the P-Trap. Out of the four cleansers I tested, the Clorox, Pinesol, and Lysol were all successful in hindering bacterial growth in the areas surrounding the gauze. The 409, however, was unable to deter the growth of bacteria. In conclusion, if one of the three successful cleansers is used routinely to cleanse the sink, malignant bacteria will be kept to a safe minimum.<br><br>

MODULATING MURINE LEUKEMIA VIRUS INFECTION WITH MCAT-1 RECEPTOR-MASKED LIPOSOMES ENCAPSULATING VIRAL INHIBITORS
Salvatore Mottillo
Marianopolis College, Montreal, Quebec, Canada

Liposomes have been shown to be clinically safe and effective in therapies involving the delivery of medicines, such as antifungal and chemotherapeutic agents. The present study proposes a novel antiviral application of these lipids, as cellular mimics acting as viral decoys. Contrary to conventional therapies that aim to inhibit viruses during replication, these decoys aim to divert and trap viruses, preventing them from encountering host cells.<br><br> These innovative virus decoys were tested against the Murine Leukemia Virus (MuLV), a retrovirus, and model for HIV. MuLV infection was modulated by mimicking NIH-3T3 host cells with vacant liposomes and MCAT-1 receptor-masked liposomes encapsulating rifamycin, a reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Viral production was detected by reverse transcriptase assays.<br><br> Contrary to untreated cultures, empty liposomes with MuLV diluted 1/10 and 1/100 successfully reduced infection by 84% and 60%. Liposomes encapsulating rifamycin reduced infection by 90% and 63% in MuLV dilutions 1/10 and 1/100 respectively. Rifamycin alone also inhibited infection by 46%, and MCAT-1 reduced infection by approximately 30%. Cytotoxicity was present in samples with MCAT-1 receptor-masked liposomes and they were consequently excluded from analysis. Further testing is needed to confirm the ability of MCAT-1 to enhance the affinity of MuLV for liposomes. <br><br> Virus decoys consisting of empty liposomes and liposomes encapsulating rifamycin were shown to significantly inhibit infection, and merit further dose response testing with MuLV and other viruses. The effectiveness of liposomes at reducing infection helps validate the innovative virus decoy mechanism and its ability to devastate destructive viruses.<br><br>

GENOMIC SIGNATURES OF PROKARYOTE ACCESSED BY CHAOS GAME REPRESENTATION
Jason Zicheng Hu
Boston Latin Academy, Boston, MA 02135

Chaos Game Representation (CGR) was used to display the relatedness of all prokaryotic genomes listed in National Center for Biotechnology Information database. In order to use this method, a novel computer program was developed to calculate the percentage of various combinations of nucleotide words presented in complete genomic sequences. This percentage was assigned a value on a color scale ranging from black to bright yellow. These values were then assigned to a matrix location that allowed fractal images to be created. Each organism formed a distinct fractal pattern. These fractal images were converted into mathematical values; these values were then subjected to pair-wise distance calculations. Cluster analysis was performed on various nucleotide combinations resulting in a dendrogram of all 267 genomic sequences. Combinations of 4-nucleotide words were shown to be the most effective in analyzing prokaryotic genomes.<br><br> Results revealed that most of the organisms sharing the same genus name are grouped together, indicating that the CGR method is potentially useful. However, the CGR results suggest that the relationship between organisms beyond the genus level, are different from the results generated from traditional methods. This suggests that non-coding regions might play an important role in the evolution of prokaryotic organisms.<br><br><br>

RNAI MEDIATED GENETIC ANALYSIS OF EPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS LYMPHOBLASTOID CELL LINES
Shahriar Akbar Khan
North Attleborough High School, North Attleborough, Massachusetts, United States

The purpose of this project was to create lymphoblastoid cells lines (LCL) with stably integrated Tet-regulatable RNA interference (RNAi) constructs. These cell lines were to be used for microarray analysis and specific breakdown of LCL gene function. Microarray data would potentially elucidate signaling mediators used by the viral oncogene Latent Infection Membrane Protein 1 cascade and similar human pathways such as CD40, IL-1, and TNFR1 and 2 while highlighting possible therapeutic targets. <br><br> Unfortunately, the Tet-regulatable system was unproductive because it was undetectable by Western blot. In addition, the Tet system was an ineffective regulator due to the presence of a CMV promoter that was discovered to be erratic in LCLs. Thus, a new system is currently being cloned. However, anti-NIK siRNA constructs were shown to be effective in Human Embryonic Kidney 293 cells. Selection of stable LCLs with siRNA constructs was inconclusive due to contamination and tenuous kill curve data. Troubleshooting experiments included testing for siRNA construct toxicity with an OriP-GFP fusion protein plasmid and siRNA construct transfection. Fluorescence Assisted Cell Sorting analysis of the aforementioned experiment revealed that siRNA constructs were non-toxic.<br><br> Future research focuses on continued cloning of a Tet-regulatable plasmid with a SV40 promoter. Upon completion of that intermediate goal, selection of stable cells will begin.<br><br>

SYNTHESIS AND EVALUATION OF NEW ANALOGS OF TRICLOSAN AND TRICLOCARBAN: PHASE II
Chelsey Ryan Hall
Seneca High School, Seneca MO, USA

<br><br>Triclosan and triclocarban are the two main antibacterial ingredients present in most commercially used antibacterial products. Due to the overuse of these two compounds, bacteria have become resistant, and antibiotic resistance is another major concern. The purpose of this experiment was to synthesized new analogs similar in chemical structure to these compounds to find another viable chemical that could be used commercially. Two analogs of triclosan and five analogs of triclocarban were synthesized following standard procedures. After compounds were synthesized NMR, melting points, IR spectrophotometry, and UV spectrophotometry were ran for each compound which verified their identities. All compounds were then dissolved in ethanol and a stock solution was made. Three commercially known concentrations of each new compound plus triclosan and triclocarban (controls) were placed on sterile blank antibiotic susceptibility disks and Mueller Hinton agar plates were swabbed in triplicate using five clinical isolates each of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli. Zones of inhibition were measured and comparisons were made between triclosan and its two analogs and triclocarban and its five analogs. ANOVA analysis indicated that at the concentrations chosen, in most cases, triclosan and/or triclocarban were significantly more effective than the analogs of each, respectively, when all strains of each bacteria were averaged. However, some of the triclocarban analogs were more effective than triclocarban on specific strains of E.coli.<br><br>

WHAT'S IN YOUR WALLET? AN ANALYSIS OF BACTERIA ON DENOMINATIONS OF U.S. CURRENCY
Shawn Marie Hughey
Navasota High School, Navasota Texas, USA

The purpose of the experiment was to discover which denomination of United States Currency contained the most bacteria. If different denominations of paper money and coins pertaining to relative years are tested for bacteria content, then the more frequently used denominations such as $1, $20, quarters, and pennies will contain a greater amount of bacteria. If circulated and uncirculated currency is tested, then I believe there will be a difference in the number of bacteria on the currency because the uncirculated money has not been passed through the public’s hands. You should first acquire 10 bills and coins (circulated and uncirculated) from each of these denominations: $1, $5, $10, $20, $100, cents, nickels, dimes, and quarters. Using a sterile swab, swipe each bill and coin using different swabs each time in a designated area. Swipe the swab onto each culture plate with the intended label and incubate at room temperature for 36 hours. Next, count the bacteria colonies on each one. The results of the experiment revealed that the one dollar bills contained the most bacteria with an average of 25.8+ colonies. The fifty dollar bills had the second highest amount of bacteria with an average of 17.9 colonies. The nickels (17.5 colonies) and dimes (17.1 colonies) contained the greatest amount of bacteria out of the coin denominations. Overall there was not a significant difference the amount of bacteria on paper money and coins. I observed that my hypothesis was partly incorrect because I believed that the one and twenty dollar bills would yield the most colonies of bacteria for the paper money and that the pennies and quarters would yield the greatest for the coins. Perhaps just because a certain denomination is used more frequently than others does not mean that it will necessarily be more contaminated.

INHIBITION OF HIV PRODUCTION IN GENETICALLY GENERATED HIV MODEL THROUGH HIV TAT TAR RNA BINDING DOMAIN
Michael Mi
Mount Lebanon High School, Pittsburgh, PA, United States

Anti-HIV drug development has lagged for the public’s demand because of limited accessibility to hazardous HIV facilities and the intrinsic high viral mutation rate of HIV that changes its sensitivity to antiviral drugs. The widely used anti-HIV drugs are nucleoside analogs that mainly interfere with the function of reverse transcriptase. They have a tendency to develop mutations that make this category of drugs ineffective. Recently, the regulatory proteins such as TAT and REV have been studied as potential targets for inhibition of HIV replication. Compared to reverse transcriptase, TAT and REV are relatively stable and should be ideal targets for antiviral strategies. In this study, the common in vitro lentivector generation approach as a surrogate assay to screen novel anti-HIV drugs was used. Lentivectors can be produced in vitro using three plasmids co-transfection method in a regular BSL2+ laboratory. It was found that the TAR RNA binding site of TAT protein (TAT-p) not only efficiently enters cells because of its transduction domain, but also effectively inhibits this generation of lentivector. This inhibition effect of TAT-p also exists when HIV replication is assayed in cultured T cells. First, it was found that the in vitro co-transfection approach could be used as a safe assay for screening anti-HIV drugs. In addition, it was found that TAT protein transduction domain, which usually guides protein entry to the cells, could effectively inhibit HIV replication. Thus, short TAT peptide may become a category of anti-HIV drugs that can compete with TAT protein in the cells and block HIV replication.

PSEUDOMONAS SYRINGAE PV. TOMATO DC3000 EFFECTORS' EFFECTS ON PLANT CELLS: HYPERSENSITIVE RESPONSE OR DISEASE
Daniel Abraham Blumenthal
Jones College Prep, Chicago, Illinois, USA

Pseudomonas syringae is a plant pathogen known to have detrimental effects on a variety of plants. When infecting plants, the bacterium P. syringae uses a type-III secretion system: it causes disease by strategically injecting proteins into host cells. Specifically, the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pto DC3000) contains about 50 different “effector” proteins which it injects into a host cell through a syringe-like structure inserted through the cell wall.<br><br> In this project, cloned, individual gene’s encoding effector proteins were obtained from the plant pathogen Pto DC3000 and the effect of each of these effectors was identified using transient transformation in Nicotiana benthamiana and N. tabacum. N. benthamiana and N. tabacum have responded with some degree of cell death to 25 of the 39 effectors that have been properly cloned from Pto DC3000. <br><br> The observed cell death was then analyzed to determine if it resulted from disease or hypersensitive response (HR). In order to study cell death dependence on known plant defense pathways required for HR, expression of four different defense genes was silenced in N. benthamiana plants by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS). Effectors known to elicit strong cell death were then tested on these plants. Through the use of VIGS, the cell death caused by one effector was decreased in the plant with the NPR1 gene silenced, indicating the HR dependence to this effector on the NPR1 pathway.

THE EFFECTS OF EXTENSIVE ANTIBIOTIC INFLUENCE ON GRAM NEGATIVE BACTERIA AND THE EFFECTS OF BETA LACTAMASES ON GRAM-NEGATIVE ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANT BACTERIA
Karan Shaileshkumar Patel
Macomb Junior Senior High School, Macomb Illinois, United States of America

Penicillin an antibiotic was used very abundantly. It is believed that the excessive use of penicillin and newer antibiotics is the leading cause of the production of antibiotic resistant bacteria. These bacteria become immune to antibiotics, producing the worldwide need for better antibiotics. Gram-negative bacteria are naturally resistant to some antibiotics. Bacteria are gram-negative if they retain a red color after the gram-staining process. These bacteria have an enzyme called Beta-Lactamases. Beta-Lactamases is located on the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria. It is the cause of the natural resistance of gram-negative bacteria against penicillin and its derivatives, also known as Beta-Lactam antibiotics. <br><br> In this project the question being answered was whether environmental bacteria were resistant to antibiotics. Gram-negative bacteria are resistant to some antibiotics. Also being tested was if the destruction of the enzyme Beta-Lactamases, which is gram-negative bacteria’s main line of defense against the cell wall breaking Beta-Lactam antibiotics, would make the resistant bacteria nonresistant. <br><br> The results show that excessive antibiotic influence on bacteria decreases the antibiotics chance of destroying bacteria. This means that bacteria develop an increase in resistance to antibiotics. It is expected that the disabling of the enzyme Beta-Lactamases, by forming a solution which will discard the enzyme using the enzyme’s chemical formula and characteristics, will enable antibiotics to destroy resistant bacteria. The destruction of Beta-Lactamases will result in the destruction of unwanted bacteria. This is because the bacterial would lose its main line of defense making it vulnerable to Beta-Lactam antibiotics.<br><br>

PUTTING A SILVER LINING ON SOLAR DISINFECTION THE ADDITIVE EFFECT OF SILVER NITRATE ON A SOLAR DISINFECTION MODEL
Cameron Thomas Gross
Solon High School, Solon, IA, USA

Solar water disinfection (SODIS) is a technique using sunlight to sterilize contaminated drinking water. Although simple and effective, there are many opportunities for error that could result in water-borne illness. The purpose of this study was to test if the addition of silver ions to a model of the SODIS system resulted in additive effects on water sterilization. I used a black light blue bulb to simulate ambient near ultraviolet radiation (UVA) and silver nitrate as a source of soluble silver ions. Sterile drinking water was contaminated with a non-pathogenic laboratory strain of E. coli, and then treated with silver ions with or without concurrent UVA exposure. Viable bacteria were assayed by hand-counting colonies on culture plates. I found that silver nitrate resulted in bacterial killing in a dose and time dependant manner. After a 3-hour exposure to silver ion concentrations of 1.0, 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001 µg/mL, bacterial counts were reduced by 93, 91, 66, and 0%, respectively. At 6 hours there was essentially complete killing at all but the lowest silver concentration. I also found that silver nitrate and UVA have at least an additive bactericidal effect. After exposing contaminated water to UVA (2 mW/cm2) or silver (0.01 µg/mL) for 3 hours, bacterial counts fell by 82 and 71%, respectively; concurrent UVA and silver treatment resulted in complete killing. Thus, it appears feasible that the addition of soluble silver ions may allow for more effective solar sterilization of drinking water.

"DO SUPERBUGS GO TO SCHOOL"
Matt Aaron Doty
Glen Rose High School Malvern, AR 72104 United States

My Science Fair project is focused on if there are any of the so-called Super bacteria growing at my school. The research will involve getting samples of bacteria from my school, culturing them, and testing to see what type they are. The tests will include bio-chemically testing the bacteria to see if any "superbugs" are in my samples. I hypothesize that I will find a sample of a superbug at my school. The first step in my project was to get approval from my school to get the samples. Next I got sterile swabs to get the samples. After that, I took the samples to get cultured, their growth recorded, and get them bio-chemically tested for their type. Last, I recorded the data on the bacteria and finished my project. My conclusion was that no superbugs were in any of the samples that I took.

A QUANTITATIVE STUDY OF VIRAL GENOMES WITH A FOCUS ON RAPID IDENTIFICATION OF UNKNOWN STRAINS
Benjamin Albert Schwank
James Madison High School, Vienna, VA, USA

The emergence of new viral strains such as SARS and avian influenza threatens to cause a global pandemic. Rapid identification of new strains is critical to combating disease. For example, if the current strain of H5N1 avian influenza in Southeast Asia is very similar to the 1997 strain, vaccines developed for the earlier strain might protect people. The purpose of this project was to determine new methods for the analysis and rapid identification of viral genomes. The complete public database of viral genomes was downloaded from the DNA Data Bank of Japan. This database contains nucleotide sequences for over 200,000 complete and partial genomes for about 100 virus types that are dangerous to humans. Java classes were written to calculate basic statistics for viral genomes such as sequence length and percent adenine. The standard LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) algorithm was determined to be inadequate for matching viral genomes. An enhanced algorithm LACS (Longest Associated Common Subsequence) was designed, coded, and tested for use in viral genome matching. It was found that the complete genomes of different virus types have a unique signature in the 2-dimensional space defined by percent adenine and length. Plots of individual sequences in the percent adenine/length space, combined with LACS algorithm processing, were used to identify loci exhibiting rapid mutations for a number of different virus types. A Java/Swing application was built with a user interface for the identification of newly-sequenced viral genomes. This application could be hosted on a website for use by researchers world-wide.

ENGINEERING 3-DIMENSIONAL SKELETAL MUSCLE TISSUE
Nikhil Gupta
Manhasset High School, Manhasset, NY, USA

According to the Coalition on Donation (2004), approximately 17 people die each day from lack of transplantable tissues and organs. Engineered tissue in vitro would allow generation of replacement tissue that is appropriate in size and function to fulfill the role of damaged tissue. Thus, the goal of this study was to create new and functional living tissue using living cells associated with a matrix and scaffold to guide development. None of the previous strategies for engineering skeletal muscle have been able to fulfill all requirements of engineered tissue (cylinder of aligned fibers, connected by an extracellular matrix). The study sought to combine previously used techniques (micropatterning and mechanical conditioning for parallel alignment, collagen as a pre-existing ECM, and PLGC as a cylindrical scaffold), along with a novel idea (vertical migration of cells) to engineer skeletal muscle in vitro. Histological analysis was performed by cryopreserving the tissue and staining the individual cross sections with hematoxylin and eosin to highlight cell nuclei and cytoplasm. The study was ultimately successful in the pursuit of a biologically accurate in vitro muscle tissue. This success was contingent upon the affirmation of the original hypothesis that cells could be stimulated to migrate in the vertical direction (against gravity). Histological examination revealed that the final tissue was a biocompatible cylinder consisting of aligned myotubes and connected by a network of extracellular matrix.

A STUDY OF OLFACTION AND LIFESPAN IN DROSOPHILA
Maham Ahmad
Alhambra High School, Alhambra, CA, USA

To identify neural regions that regulate the longevity of Drosphila, I selectively targeted a dominant negative of the Shibire gene, which controls vesicular trafficking at synapses to brain regions, and assayed the effects on longetivity. I used GAL4 drivers to screen for neural regions that, when silenced, via Shibire, conferred enhanced longevity. Potential candidates were tested and identification of one GAL4 line displayed longevity, by surviving for 43 days, as compared to the control that survived for 30 days. Using fluorescent microscopy, I identified the GAL4 to be expressed in the mushroom body, the structure that is responsible for olfaction memory. When c560 was retested the results implied that the control had a greater lifespan than the experimental strain. Testing the homozygote discovered that the c560 homozygote lived an average of 40 days, while the control lived for only 35 days. An olfaction test was done because the GAL4 had disrupted a gene in the mushroom body. The smell test determined that the c560 strain could not smell yeast as well as the control, thus leading to a conclusion that, because the flies do not eat as much, they live longer. This theory has been tested in most mammals, and it has been determined that caloric restriction slows down the energy flux, resulting in a slower aging rate, allowing the mammal extended longevity.

THE ANTIBACTERIAL EFFECTS OF HONEY ON DH5 E. COLI AND PEDIOCOCCUS
Cody Andrew Hartman
Laurel-Concord High School, Laurel NE, USA

Throughout history, there have been remedies using honey for its antibacterial qualities. This is an investigation of the effects of honey on the DH5 strand of Escherichia coli and Pediococcus. This study contained plates of 12 different types of honey from all over the world they were: Rape from Canada, Basswood from Minnesota, Orange from California, Clover from Minnesota, Clover from South Dakota, Clover from North Dakota, Locust from Romania, Horsemint Texas, Multi-floral from Uruguay, Cotton from Arkansas, Soy from Arkansas and Tallow from Texas. All of the plates were filled with 3 grams of honey per plate. The plates were then filled with 7 grams of nutrient agar and were left to set. After that they were streaked with the DH5 strand of E. coli. Another test consisted of quartered plates with 3 grams of each type of honey in a quadrant one quadrant was left unfilled with honey and was filled with nutrient agar or MRS media up to the divider of the plates. E. coli or Pediococcus was then streaked on the plates. The plates were then put in the incubator for 24 hours. They then were observed to see if there was any inhibition in the plate. It was noticed that there were levels of inhibition in the plate.

STUDIES ON THE PRODUCTIONS OF RANTES BY U937 CELLS
Lecia Ashanna Moya Brown
Suncoast High School, Riviera Beach, FL, USA

The purpose of this experiment is to determine which cytokines promote or reduce RANTES production. It is hypothesized overall that if the cell is correctly activated then RANTES will be expressed. Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF alpha), Interferon Gamma (IFN gamma), and Interleukin-4 (IL-4), are used as the stimulants. All experiments leading to the final conclusion are tested in 24 and 48 hour increments. Phorbol Myristate Acetate (PMA) and Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) are used as the control as well as an untreated negative control group. IL-4 induced the RANTES expression by two to three-fold on average in comparison to the untreated group. IFN gamma aided greatly in the production of RANTES with an expression of almost seven-fold in most cases when analyzed and evaluated with the negative control group. Furthermore, TNF alpha ranged from seven to eight-fold in most cases when evaluated. With the results recorded it is conclusive that the RANTES production was induced by all cytokines utilized. The induction of RANTES expression by these cytokines is optimal at 48 hours. Overall, the lower the concentration of the cytokines the greater the production of RANTES. The results show how the HIV infection could be slowed down. By blocking the Mu Opioid Receptor, TNF alpha cannot activate RANTES production.

HUMAN CYTOMEGALOVIRUS (HCMV) UP-REGULATES ADHESION MOLECULE EXPRESSION ON MONOCYTES: A POTENTIAL MECHANISM FOR VIRAL SPREAD
Jessica Elizabeth Minard 
Caddo Parish Magnet High School, Shreveport, Louisiana, U.S. 

Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a beta-herpesvirus that causes severe disease in immunocompromised hosts such as AIDS patients, transplant recipients, and congenitally infected neonates. It is also a leading cause of cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis and restenosis. In order for HCMV to cause disease it must find a way to spread from the blood to peripheral organs. It is thought that HCMV spreads from the blood by forcing monocytes to migrate into organs, where the virus then causes organ damage. Therefore, the knowledge of HCMV's mechanisms of spread could aid in understanding the diseases HCMV causes. The purpose of my research is to show that HCMV up-regulates ICAM-1, ICAM-3, L-selectin, occludin, VE-cadherin, E-cadherin, and Beta-2 integrin expression. Immunosluorescent analyses were performed on Mock-infected, HCMV-infected, PMA, or LY294002, am inhibitor of the biochemical pathway PI(3)K, treated monocytes in order to examine the expression of monocyte adhesion markers. Through the use of this immunofluorescent staining this hypothesis was supported by noting the increase in light intensity on the cell surface of infected and PMA (positive control) treated cells. Further work needs to be done to find the functions of the individual adhesion molecules listed above.

EVALUATION OF CHANGES IN SKIN FLORA
Yelena Waldmann Dewald
Allegany High School, Cumberland, Maryland, United States of America

When humans come in contact with bacteria, if the bacteria can attach to tissue and conditions are adequate for growth, the bacteria will reproduce and become part of the normal flora. Micrococcus luteus is naturally found on human skin and is also commonly used in introductory microbiology labs. The hypothesis tested in this study is when one is exposed to a lab strain of bacteria often found in natural skin flora, the bacteria will become part of the flora and will be detectable. <br><br>To see if M. luteus was in the flora initially, streak plates were made using samples of the flora taken from different areas of the hand. Any colonies that resembled those of M. luteus were subcultured and tested using catalase, cytochrome oxidase, acid from glucose and Gram stain tests to determine if they appeared to be M. luteus.<br><br> Then, to determine if the lab strain of M. luteus became part of the microbiota, (1) the hands were tested prior to any lab work, (2) standard aseptic transfer techniques were used to manipulate the bacteria for 30 min., inoculating various lab media, (3) the hands were tested again, and (4) the hands were then washed and tested once more. Any colonies which appeared to be M. luteus were tested as before.<br><br> There was no significant increase in the number of M. luteus colonies over three weeks and none of these shared colony characteristics with the lab strain of the species. Therefore, it was found that the strain used in the lab did not become part of the normal flora of the hand, refuting the hypothesis.<br><br>

AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE BIOLOGICAL/PHYSIOLOGICAL ROLE OF PRION CONFORMATION.
Emily Elizabeth McGettigan
Homeschool, Delanco NJ, United States of America

Prions are infectious proteins with altered shape and function. Previous experimentation revealed that prions prolong the growth and life span of yeast cells. The current study consisted of three experiments-the purpose being finding the mechanism for survival of prion-containing cells. Control: A starting culture with a 50:50 ratio of [PSI+] to [psi-] was mixed in order to establish a baseline for prions to non-prions. Experiment #2: Both groups were [psi-]. The first group used the Wild Type (WT) strain. The second group used the mutated strain with an early stop codon. This early stop codon prevents the completion of adenine. The purpose of this experiment was to reveal if the completed adenine gene is essential to the survival and life of yeast. Experiment #3: Both groups in this experiment were [PSI+]. Group 1 had the prion form of Sup35. Group 2 contained an extra copy of SUP35C in order to decrease nonsense suppression. This experiment displayed whether the prion tail itself has contributed to the survival and life of yeast.<br><br>During deep stationary phase all cultures were plated and the colonies counted.<br><br>Control group: [psi-]- 14.444%. [PSI+]- 85.555556%. Experiment #2: [psi-]Mutated Strain- 22.81377 %. [psi-]Wild Type Strain- 77.18623%. Experiment #3: [PSI+]Sup35C- 94.28668%. [PSI+]- 5.713317%.<br><br>Adenine contributes to initial cell division, but is not essential to the prevalence of prions. The abundance of red in Experiment #3 shows the life and survival of yeast is not dependent on the dysfunctional translation termination, but on the prion itself. <br><br>

DEVELOPING A METHOD OF PLANT EXTRACT USAGE IN FEED TO REDUCE THE LEVELS OF CLOSTRIDIUM PERFRINGENS IN THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM OF CHICKENS TO PROMOTE HEALTHY GROWTH.
Joseph Robert Stunzi
Clarke Central High School, Athens, Georgia, United States of America

The purpose of this project was to find an antimicrobial method for treating Clostridium perfringens in the digestive systems of chickens. The researcher hypothesized that if one isolates the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and acidity for plant extracts to have an antimicrobial effect on Clostridium perfringens, then he will be able to identify the correct conditions needed to control the level of Clostridium perfringens. The researcher selected an array of plant extracts. The researcher then cultured the ATCC #13124 type strand of Clostridium perfringens. An anaerobic environment was created for each set of cultures. All alcoholic contents were desiccated and applied to sterile disks inside of blood agar and PCU plates. In all, nine extracts were used. Then, phosphate buffered saline was used as a control.<br><br> The researcher found that phenols and polyphenols had an antimicrobial effect. These extracts were chamomile, licorice, mint, hops extracted with ethanol, and green tea. In the future, the researcher hopes to continue his study by testing for the MIC and pH levels of each extract and then later testing through in vivo experimentation.<br><br> Currently, antibiotics are used in feed to control the levels of Clostridium perfringens in the digestive systems of chickens. In turn, antibiotics allow chickens to grow faster in less amount of time. There is a global concern that frequent antibiotic use will eventually lead to mutation in the current strand of Clostridium perfringens. If this happens, antibiotic treatments for humans and animals alike will become less affective.

SINORHIZOBIUM MELILOTI INOSITOL CATABOLISM GENES AND THEIR ROLE IN SYMBIOTIC NITROGEN FIXATION
Yiqian (Jasmine) Zheng
Kalamazoo Area Mathematics and Science Center, Kalamazoo MI, USA

Rhizopine, an inositol derivative produced by specific Sinorhizobium meliloti strains, plays a role in nitrogen-fixing relationships between the bacteria and its host plant, Medicago sativa. Not all S. meliloti strains can synthesize and catabolize rhizopines, and the complete set of genes required for synthesis and catabolism is unknown. This research investigated which genes are essential for myo-inositol catabolism and studied competition between S. meliloti wild type and mutant strains with a mutation in the myo-inositol dehydrogenase gene. For analysis of putative genes' roles, gene fragments from S. meliloti 1021 believed to play roles in myo-inositol dehydrogenase (idhA) and catabolism (iolB, iolC, iolD) were PCR amplified. Triparental conjugation with recipient S. meliloti 1021, helper pRK600, and donor JM109/pVO155+ fragments of idhA, iolB, iolC, or iolD lead to integration of the vector at the specific gene locus. Streaking the mutants onto chemically defined medium with inositol as the sole carbon source (MMIno) tested their myo-inositol utilization ability. Competition assays between two wild-type strains and their isogenic idhA mutants were conducted by inoculating M. sativa with equal numbers of one wild type and one mutant strain. Frequencies of both cell types were monitored through time by isolating bacteria from the nodules. Less mutant strains present in nodules as compared to wild-type strains suggested that myo-inositol utilization ability allows competitive advantage for persistence in nodules. Mutants possessing mutations in myo-inositol catabolism genes could not grow on MMIno, indicating that both putative myo-inositol catabolism genes iolB and iolC essential for myo-inositol utilization in S. meliloti.

INVESTIGATION INTO THE POPULATION DYNAMICS OF AKASHIWO SANGUINEA
Barbara Ann Luttrell
Astronaut High School, Titusville, FL, U.S.A.

<br><br> This project is investigating the effects of global warming on the population of the dinoflagellate, Akashiwo sanguinea.<br><br> <br><br> The cells were kept at two varying temperatures and four varying carbon dioxide concentrations. The carbon dioxide was added by allowing dry ice to evaporate in a bag and then being added to the flasks using a syringe. Twelve flasks were kept at 20 degrees C. Three of those had no carbon dioxide added with the caps loose, three had no carbon dioxide added with the caps sealed, three had the carbon dioxide level doubled with the caps sealed, and the other three had the carbon dioxide levels quadrupled with the caps sealed. Twelve different flasks with the same carbon dioxide levels were held at 25 degrees C. One milliliter of each flask was removed and preserved with Lugol's solution. The cells were then counted with a microscope and recorded. The population was observed and recorded three times throughout the growth, at the original addition of carbon dioxide, about half way through the experiment and at the end of the project. The cultures were then washed safely down the sink.<br><br> After using the statistics software, Pearson r and t-Test for non-independent subjects ( alpha level=.05), I have accepeted my null hypothesis. The carbon dioxide and temperature levels had an effect on the cells. The population was decreased with the increase of carbon dioxide.

IN VITRO ASSAY OF CALCIUM SULFATE AND POLYMETHYLMETHACRYLATE BEADS IMPREGNATED WITH VANCOMYCIN
Claire Clothiaux
Greenwood Laboratory School, Springfield, Missouri

Antibiotic impregnated polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) beads have been used to augment the surgical treatment of soft tissue and osseous infections. The beads are surgically implanted at the site of osteomyelitis and remove by a second surgery after the antibiotics have eluted. Medical grade calcium sulfate is commonly used bone graft substitute used to promote bone growth. Based upon the clinical success of known elution properties on antibiotic PMMA beads, Ca-SO4 beads have been empirically impregnated with antibiotics. However, the drug elution properties of Ca-SO4 antibiotic beads when compared PMMA antibiotic beads are not know as well as the antimicrobial effects of the preparation.<br><br> Series of Vancomycin (vanc) impregnated beads were made as follows: 1) Ca-SO4 25g/1g Vancomycin (25:1) 2) PMMA 40g/1.6 gm Vanc (25:1) 3) Ca-SO4 25g/500mg (50:1) 4) PMMA 40gm/800mg Vanc 5) Ca-SO4 25g/250mg Vanc 6) PMMA 40g/400mg Vanco. Each series of beads was placed in 250 ml 0.9 normal saline kept at 37 degrees Celsius. Aliquots of each solution were assayed on specific intervals for the vancomycin concentration.<br><br> Kirby-Bauer discs were prepared from each solution and tested for antimicrobial effectiveness against S.aureus. The results demonstrated the release of super therapeutic level of vanc from Ca-SO4 beads at one hour with sustained release there after. PMMA titrates did not reach therapeutic levels until three weeks.<br><br> The clinical implications for the use of vanc-CaSO4 beads in 3 fold: 1) An effective biodegradable delivery method for antibiotics into infected civilian and military wounds. 2) A simultaneous bone graft substitute and 3) the eliminator of additional surgery for bead removal.<br><br>

DIFFERENTIAL BACTERIAL GROWTH IN CARBONATED BEVERAGES
Curt Henry Follman
Wolford Public School, Wolford, ND, United States of America

My objective was to determine the increase of bacterial colonies in pop after a twenty-four hour time period. I believe there will be around a 300% increase in the bacterial colonies present in the pop. Mountain Dew and Pepsi were extracted from just previously opened pop cans and placed onto petri dishes with nutrient agar as a gel. After a twenty-four hour time period, pop was again extracted from the two pop cans and placed onto petri dishes holding nutrient agar. The bacterial colonies were then examined from each set of petri dishes. The percent increase in Mountain Dew was 662% and the Pepsi was 609%. An overall average of the bacterial growth in both carbonated beverages was 636%. In summary, the bacterial growth in carbonated beverages within a twenty-four hour time period is very significant.

SNARING THE SNARE MOLECULAR STUDIES OF MEMBRANE FUSION; PROTEIN GS-15
Nisha Garimalla, Galimat Khaidakova, Laura Soderberg
Little Rock Central High School, Little Rock, Arkansas, United States 

The purpose of this experiment was to create tools for further Golgi research and to determine the position of the GS-15 protein in the cell. The Golgi functions in intracellular transport and helps import needed material into the cell and export waste out (Pack “Cliff’s AP”). The SNARE complexes within the Golgi are responsible for the correct delivery of vesicles and act in tethering vesicles to the cell membrane to facilitate fusion so that the vesicles can deposit their cargo. SNARE’s on the vesicles (vSNARE’s) work with SNARE’s on the Golgi to make sure that vesicles arrive in the correct location. Experiments have shown that when the SNARE complex is damaged, the Golgi is unable to operate (Xu “GS15 Forms…. Apparatus”), but little conclusive research has been conducted regarding the GS-15 (a protein on the SNARE) specifically. We isolated and cloned the DNA fragment that codes for the GS-15 into three expression plasmids, including pQE-30, pEGFP (green fluorescent), and pGEX-4T for use as experimental tools. The GFP-GS15 was then expressed into mammalian cells and used to generate antibodies for GS15. Use of light imaging with GFP-GS15 expressed in the HeLa cells showed the concentration of GS15 in the Golgi body and its presence vesicles. We were successful in creating the proper tools for GS-15 research and determined that the GS-15 is located on both the Golgi and on vesicles, indicating that the Golgi is a vSNARE as opposed to a target membrane (t) SNARE.

QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF ALLIUM SATIRUM, MELALEUCA ALTERNIFOLIA, AND ECHINACEA PURPURE AS COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL ANTIBIOTICS
Sarah Ann Wilfahrt, Michelle Lynn Wilfahrt
Park City High School, Park City, UT, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effectiveness of Garlic, Tea Tree Oil, and Echinacea when compared to the effectiveness of conventional antibiotics. Over-usage of conventional antibiotics in today’s society is a leading cause in the growing problem of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Alternative medicines that have antibacterial properties, with less chance of allowing bacteria to become resistant, would be a great benefit to the medical industry and our society as a whole. <br><br>This experiment utilized Staphylococci and Streptococci bacterium because they are some of the more prevalent bacterium found in everyday life and have shown an increasing ability to become antibiotic resistant. The procedures performed in the conduct of this experiment included: Kirby-Bauer tests performed for each bacterium to evaluate the antibacterial effectiveness of the herbs versus conventional antibiotics. A quantitative plating method was also implemented to identify the antibacterial effectiveness of the herbs at different concentrations.<br><br>The fresh garlic had a much greater antibacterial effect than the other herbal antibiotics. Echinacea had the second greatest antibacterial properties. In phase 3 there was less bacterial growth in the inoculants containing higher concentrations of herbal additives. Garlic proved the most effective; Tea Tree Oil and Echinacea had approximately the same effectiveness. The garlic required a lesser concentration to produced the highest bacterial inhibition. Garlic and Echinacea, while not suitable for major usage in modern medicine, could prove to be a valuable alternative to conventional antibiotics when the extent of the infection is not as severe or as preventative therapy.<br><br>

Timber Lake High School, Timber Lake, SD, USA

In today's society, herbal remedies have become very popular because of the rising cost of prescription drugs. The purpose of this project is to see if Ginkgo and Echinacea prevent viral infectivity in Monkey kidney cells (Marc-145) with Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) and mouse stromal cells (M2) with Murine Cytomegalovirus(MCMV-EGFP.<br><br>First the cells were grown in 75 cm2 flasks and transferred to 12-well plates. The herbal extracts were then prepared in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at the concentration of 10 mg/ml. The solution was then filtered through a 0.22 um syringe filter. Next, the herbal solutions were added to the cell cultures at doses of 100 ug/ml, 200 ug/ml, 500 ug/ml, and 1000 ug/ml. Then the virus preparations (.001 MOI of PRRSV and MCMV-EGFP) were added. The cell cultures were incubated for three days at 37 degrees in a CO2 incubator. Finally the cells were viewed underneath a microscope.<br><br>The Ginkgo did not prevent virus infectivity in either cells but did cause toxicity in M2 cells in the higher levels (500 ug and 1000 ug). Echinacea did prevent viral infectivity of the M2 cells, but it was slightly toxic to the cells at all levels. In the Marc-145 cells, Echinacea prevented viral infectivity at the higher doses and was not toxic to the cells.<br><br>

THE ISOLATION OF ANTIBIOTIC-LIKE PROTEINS FROM INSECT LARVAE OF MUSCA DOMESTICA, HOUSEFLY MAGGOTS, AND THREE OTHER SPECIES OF INSECTS
Shana Marie Wolff, Beth J. Cochran
Cheyenne Central High School, Cheyenne, Wyoming, USA

The purpose of our experiment was to examine the secretions from domestic housefly larvae, maggots, Musca domestica, and three other species of insects for antimicrobial antibiotic production. We had observed fly larvae in dead animal flesh and wondered how they could survive in the bacterial rich decomposing flesh and not be killed. We hypothesized that insect larvae, maggots or grubs, produce and secrete antibiotic-like substances that kill bacteria in the dead tissue in which the insect larvae grow, protecting the insect larvae from bacterial attack.<br><br> In this study, we used housefly larvae or maggots (Musca domestica), mealworm grubs (Tenebrio), fruit fly larvae (Drosophila melanogaster), and superworms (Zophobas morio). Fourteen different types of bacteria were streaked on agar plates. Secretions from the insect larvae cuticle were collected on sterile filter paper discs, placed on the inoculated petri plates, and incubated. Zones of bacterial inhibition were observed and measured. <br><br> Results showed that housefly larvae, mealwom grubs, and fruit fly larvae, produced and secreted from their cuticle an antibiotic like substance that inhibited several species of soil bacteria. Further characterization using denaturation by heat showed that the secreted antibiotic-like substance to be a protein. <br><br> Our research showed that insect larvae produce and secrete antibiotic-like proteins from their cuticles to protect the insect larvae from bacterial attack in the soil or rotting animal flesh in which the insect eggs were laid. These antibiotic-like proteins could possibly be of therapeutic value in the treatment of human infections as a new source of antibiotics.

Will samples from four local bodies of water contain gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria?<br><br> If gram-negative bacteria indicate the presence of fecal matter, then all of the samples we collected from Ruby Dome Ranch, South Fork, the Marina, and a pond will be gram-negative, as all these locations are frequented by wildlife.<br><br> The procedure involved taking samples of water and growing bacteria from each sample, then preparing and gram-staining slides of each sample. The slides were then analyzed for gram-negative and –positive bacteria.<br><br> Our hypothesis was correct; all of the samples were gram-negative.<br><br> Ruby Dome Ranch had the highest level of gram-negative bacteria, followed by the Marina. A small local pond was next, and Southfork Reservoir had the least amount of gram-negative bacteria.<br><br>The Ruby Dome Ranch ponds are frequented by livestock, which would explain the high gram-negative levels, and the Marina is visited by a large amount of wildlife. The Southfork Reservoir sample may have been somewhat diluted since that reservoir is significantly larger then the other bodies of water.<br><br>

LICHENS: INHIBITION OF STAPHYLOCOCCUS EPIDERMIDIS
Anne Marie Mallow, Sarah Elizabeth Mallow
Pendleton County High School, Franklin, WV, United States of America

This investigation was designed to discover if lichens have inhibitory effects on Staphylococcus epidermidis. In experiment one, lichen specimens were placed into tea bags and acetone was added to extract the acids. After 24 hours, the acetone was evaporated, leaving a lichen acid residue on filter paper discs. <br><br> In experiment two, the lichen acid extracts were mixed with fish oil after the acetone had evaporated. It was expected that the addition of the oil would enable more of the lichen acids to be absorbed by the filter paper discs.<br><br> In experiment three, the procedures from the first and second experiment were combined to see if lichen acids have a synergistic effect. The lichen acids were extracted using the method from experiment one. The acetone was allowed to evaporate and the extracts were mixed with fish oil, as in experiment two. To investigate synergy, all possible combinations of inhibiting lichen acids from previous experiments were tested. <br><br> In all experiments, the filter paper discs were applied to nutrient agar inoculated with Staphylococcus epidermidis which had been previously incubated for 24 hours. Incubation continued for 48 hours, measuring zones of inhibition every 24 hours.<br><br> Barbatic acid, found in Cladonia macillenta, vulpinic acid, found in Vulpicida pinastri, and lecanoric acid, found in Punctelia rudecta, exhibited inhibitory effects. Punctelia rudecta showed zones of inhibition in all three experiments. Results show that lichen acids have inhibiting effects on Staphylococcus epidermidis but do not have a synergistic effect.<br><br>

Our work is about one of the most actual problems in this time. It describes math-modeling AIDS virus and immune organism system, using data, sent us by faculty of Biology and Microbiology, Taft University, Boston, USA. Our achievement is a math-analysis of AIDS model and its correction. Also we have found the more efficient method of giving a medicine to an infected organism to maximize his life time. Also this method economize medicine, because in the low state organism have not to use the medicine. In this moment, medicine has some disadvantages. It is a very toxically and unhealthy and it costs very mach.

Selby Area School, Selby, SD, USA

We wanted to do this project to see if dollar bills or quarters contained more bacteria, whether they were Gram Positive or Negative, and whether they were Catalase Positive or Negative. We wanted to identify all shapes of bacteria. <br><br> We swabbed the quarters and the dollar bills with sterile swabs, smeared the swabs on petri dishes, and put them in an incubator, at 36o Celsius, for four days.<br><br> A colony-counting machine helped us find the percentage of bacteria. <br><br> We used the Gram Staining Technique by making a smear of bacteria on a slide using a sterile loop and “heat-fixing” the slide. We covered the smear with crystal violet, Gram’s Iodine, 95% ethanol, and saffranin. After each step, we rinsed the slide with water. Last, we examined the slide under a microscope.<br><br> We used the Catalase Test by transferring bacteria onto a slide using a sterile loop and adding hydrogen peroxide. <br><br> In conclusion, dollar bills had more bacteria, 38.3%, compared to quarters, 16.7%. Fourteen of the eighteen Gram Stains for quarters were positive, and four were negative. Ten of the twenty stains for dollar bills were positive, and ten were negative. Fourteen of the eighteen Gram Stains for quarters were cocci shaped, and four were bacilli. Fourteen of the twenty stains for dollar bills were cocci shaped, and six were bacilli. Seventeen of the eighteen Catalase slides for quarters were positive, and one was negative. Nineteen of the twenty Catalase slides for dollar bills were positive, and one was negative.<br><br>

Although more evidence has been presented supporting the existence of a circadian rhythm regulating bioluminescence, no evidence exists to deny the importance of zooplankton migration towards the surface at night. It would be reasonable to think that as plankton density fluctuates, chlorophyll concentrations might indicate the migration of such organisms in the water column.<br><br> The present investigation pretends to study the relationship between dinoflagellate density, chlorophyll and nutrients (N, P and K) concentrations.<br><br> Sampling was conducted every hour for 24 hours at three (3) different stations of the bay, along a longitudinal transect. Water was at 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 meters deep and stored in borosilicate glass Nalgene bottles.<br><br> Samples were analyzed for chlorophyll content using standard spectrophotometrical procedures (Axler and Owen, 1994). Nutrients (N, P and K) were determined with standard colorimetric tests (Hach’s Water Quality Kit). Cell counts will be determined under a microscope using a Sedwick counting slide.<br><br> Data shows that Pyrodinium bahamense responds strongly to depth in the water column, being more concentrated in the surface at 0100 and 1300 hours. Also, direct cell counts and chlorophyll content profiles suggest a significant response of P. bahamense towards high P concentrations. No apparent significant response was noted in P. bahamense towards N and K.<br><br> The implications of these results for the ecological stoichiometry of Puerto Mosquito Bioluminiscent Bay, is been considered as the researchers next topic of interest.<br><br>

PRE-PACKAGED ITEMS !!! SAFE OR NOT ?
Laramie Wayne Adams, Brianna Clements
Gustine ISD, Gustine, Texas, United States

We chose to do research and evaluation on prepackaged items that we use daily to see if the items are really sterile. We decided that we would inoculate agar plates with the many products we use in our daily routine. What happens when someone cuts themselves? Most people put a Band-Aid on it !!! We proposed the question, “Is it really sterile?” We gently rubbed some products on our agar plates to see if they were really sterile. We tested several items such as gauze, an antiseptic wipe, a first aid non stick pad, syringe needle, Liberty insulin syringe, prepackaged spoons, a test needle for diabetics, and we also exposed one dish the open air in a classroom. After inoculating the agar, we put it in an incubator and looked at the growth of bacteria from day to day. We found that some of the items are not sterile like they are supposed to be. We also found that some of the items we tested are truly sterile. In doing this experiment we can find that it may not be best to use some products because you are running a risk of spreading bacteria. For this experiment we propose the Question , “SAFE OR NOT?” We found that the air we breath is truly more harmful than any product we tested just by observing the growth on the different agar plates.<br><br>

EFFECTS OF ULTRAVIOLET-A RAYS ON THE GROWTH OF ESCHERICHIA COLI BACTERIA
Jesse Christopher Dodds, Jonah Parker
Central Lee High School, Donnellson Iowa, United States of America

The increase of antibiotic resistance is an important issue as antibiotics are being abused. As bacteria become resistant to antibiotics, more effective methods to control bacteria need to be developed. For our experimentation, we applied ultraviolet-A rays to two strains of Escherichia coli. <br><br> We sterilized our materials, bio-engineered E. coli using accepted procedures, and applied it to our Petri dishes. We then placed the plates into the incubator for 24 hours at 37°C. We exposed one set of plates to ultraviolet light for ten minutes; others were exposed after 48 and 72 hours to discover which time frame was best for decreasing growth. <br><br> Our first hypothesis was correct. We believed plates with ampicillin, exposed to UV-A rays, would generate less growth than those not exposed, regardless of the strain of E. coli. Our second hypothesis was incorrect. We believed the amount of growth would be least on plates with ampicillin, after exposure to UV-A rays at 24 hours. We found, however, plates with ampicillin exposed to UV-A rays at 48 hours resulted in less growth. <br><br> Use of ultraviolet rays disrupts growth of bacteria and spread of E. coli at its source. This is important in the food industry to prevent contamination of products, such as fruits, vegetables and meat. Irradiation could eliminate the need for antibiotics by preventing bacterial growth in our food supply. Another potential use is in medicine. UV rays offer an alternative to antibiotics, which have become less effective in the treatment of bacteria related illnesses.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF HERBAL REMEDIES VS. ANTIBIOTICS AGAINST BACTERIAL GROWTH
Nikola Lukenda, Christopher Matthew Balaban
Cardinal Newman Secondary School 

The origins of traditional medicines have their roots in herbal remedies. During modern times, society tends to look for alternatives to traditional science. One of the alternatives that many people pursue is the use of traditional herbal remedies to cure various ailments. Many herbal remedies claim to relieve illness through their anti-bacterial properties, and some claim their properties surpass those of traditional, modern antibiotics. This project compares the anti-bacterial properties of various herbal remedies that claim to have anti-bacterial properties, and modern antibiotics that are known to harbour anti-bacterial effects. <br><br> This project utilized the use of many standard biochemistry methods, tools, and precautions such as the use of a plate reader, pipettes and working near an open flame. Once the various antibiotics and herbal remedies were procured, they were prepared in varying concentrations. Equal amounts were then placed on sterile filter paper discs. These discs were introduced into multiple bacteria cultures, both Graham positive and negative. The cultures were allowed to grow, and in the days that followed one could see the area around the filter discs where the bacteria had not grown due to the antibiotic effects of the herbal remedies or antibiotics.<br><br> Some filter discs had distinct areas of non-growth around them. These discs showed that the solution placed on them had antibacterial traits, as they deterred the growth of bacteria. The results showed that modern antibiotics are often geared towards one type of bacteria, whereas herbal remedies, one in particular, eliminated all types.<br><br>

FISH MUCUS: FACTORS AFFECTING BACTERIAL GROWTH ON THE HAWAIIAN ELEOTRIS SANDWICENSIS
Genevieve C. Pang, Alayna Betsill, Taryn Takahashi
Henry Perrine Baldwin High School, Wailuku, Hawaii, USA

This experiment was designed to determine whether mucus from the Hawaiian Sleeper, Eleotris sandwicensis, inhibits growth of bacteria found in the freshwater environment, on the fish itself, and common pathogens. We predicted that the mucus would prevent development of bacteria found in its environment. We tested the inhibitory effect of mucus alone, bacteria from the mucus, and a combination of the mucus and its resident microflora. The pH measured on the fish was more acidic than its surroundings, suggesting that the fish provides an environment unique to its resident bacteria. The results of mucus grown with Clostridium perfringens indicate that the mucus alone may have weak antibacterial properties. Five pure cultures of bacteria from the pond and four common pathogenic bacteria were challenged against fish mucus samples collected on paper discs. In all cases, bacteria from the discs overgrew the introduced bacteria on the agar. When Gram stained, the colonies extending from the mucus disc appeared to belong to one of three types, despite the wide variety of bacteria normally found in a mucus sample. A loop of each colony was emulsified in nutrient broth and the resulting liquid was used to saturate a filter paper disc. When tested against environment and fish bacteria, one of the three filter paper bacteria displayed clear zones of inhibition against two pond bacteria and one fish bacteria. Therefore, specific types of bacteria on the fish may be specially adapted to living in mucus and play an important role in inhibiting other bacteria.

ENTRY OF PLASMID-ENCODED TOXIN INTO THE EUKARYOTIC CELL
Kaitlin Elizabeth Burlingame
Lake Brantley High School, Altamonte Springs, Florida, USA

Plasmid-encoded toxin (PET) is a protein involved with adult traveler’s diarrhea and pediatric diarrhea. PET travels from the cell surface to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) before entering the cytosol. The role of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) mechanism in this process is unknown, although other ER-translocating toxins travel into the cell (and are degraded) by this mechanism. This project’s purpose is to determine if PET uses the ERAD pathway to enter the eukaryotic cell and whether the structural properties of PET are similar to those of other ER-translocating toxins.<br><br> PET was added to wild-type Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells and to four ERAD-defective mutant CHO cell lines. Morphological and cell detachment assays were conducted on the cell lines. The two mutant cell lines with accelerated ERAD seemed toxin resistant and the two mutant cell lines with decreased ERAD remained toxin susceptible. This data suggests ERAD can influence PET intoxication and that PET is degraded in the eukaryotic cytosol. PET was added to wild-type cells exposed to the proteasome inhibitor ALLN. According to the cell detachment assay, these cells seemed more sensitive to PET. This would indicate that PET is degraded in the cytosol and that the rate of PET degradation influences the efficiency of intoxication. A protease sensitivity assay of PET at different temperatures, alone and in the presence of its cytosolic target, fodrin, seemed to indicate that PET exhibits similar structural properties to other ER-translocating toxins (thermal instability and regaining an active conformation through interaction with its target).

IDENTIFYING ESSENTIAL AMINO ACIDS IN MEDIA FOR XYLELLA FASTIDIOSA
Sambita Basu
Griffin High School, Griffin, GA, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to further chemically define medium for Xylella fastidiosa by identifying essential amino acids. This was accomplished by deleting specific amino acids for each media created. XF-26, a previously chemically defined medium, had been cut down from 17 amino acids to 6 essential. These 6 amino acids (with uncharged polar R groups) were the ones the researcher was primarily concerned with. The researcher created media by deleting one amino acid from each formula. She subcultured at most from 7 sources, and defined that the plates that showed no growth repeatedly indicated that they were lacking the essential nutrient for the growth of the bacterium. Two repetitions of the subculturing took place; the second provided logical proof as to which amino acids were essential- glycine, serine, threonine, and asparagine. Using this information, the researcher performed dilutions, trying to find prime concentration for optimum growth. A new set of media was made, each containing a different concentration of the four essential amino acids. Two repetitions of the dilutions were completed; most tubes showed promising growth. No definite concentration was ascertained, but the dilutions fortified her data found on the 4 essential amino acids listed previously. The researcher concluded that of the six amino acids with uncharged polar R groups, glycine, serine, threonine, and asparagine are essential. No specific concentrations were set.

CECROPINS: NATURE'S SECRET ANTIBIOTICS
Charles John Hansen
Northwestern High Shcool, Kokomo, IN, 46901, United States of America

The purpose was to determine how bacteria react to cecropins in haemolymph of Cecropia Moth pupae, to determine whether other bacteria exist in haemolymph, and to identify their genus. Haemolymph extracted from Hyalophora cecropia pupae was tested on Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens via a modified Kirby Bauer method. In phase 2, resultant bacteria growth around disks in E. coli was tested with negative stain, Gram stain, spore stain, double strength phenol red dextrose and double strength phenol red lactose broths. In phase 1, a 10% solution of haemolymph and pure haemolymph from 1 pupa/ every five dishes were tested separately on both bacteria. All disks of 10% haemolymph in E. coli created significant rings of enhancement (tavg.=34.030>t.05 =2.145). For the next 5 samples, none of the disks produced rings of enhancement. This was not significant (‡”=0, mu=0, therefore, tavg.=undefined<t.05=2.145). None of the disks on S. marcescens created rings of enhancement. The rings of enhancement were tested in Phase 2 at a BSL-2 lab. The causative bacteria were Gram positive, spore forming rods present as single cell, or short chains. Two of the disks dipped into pure haemolymph inhibited E. coli growth. This is significant vs. the control (tdia.=35.000>t.05=4.303). Pure haemolymph did not inhibit S. marcescens. Therefore, the hypothesis was partially supported in that pure haemolymph did inhibit the growth of some E. coli compared to the control. For comparison to cecropins, disks were dipped into ciprofloxacin, which totally inhibited the growth of all bacteria.

EPIDEMIOLOGY OF COMMUNITY ASSOCIATED MRSA VS. HEALTHCARE ASSOCIATED MRSA
Kathryn Leigh Davis
Leesburg High School, Leesburg, Florida, United States of America

Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been a problem relative to healthcare associated infections (HA-MRSA), and has now also been identified as a cause of community associated infections (CA-MRSA). This research was to determine if there are epidemiological differences in CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA in a population, as was hypothesized.<br><br> 160 frozen samples of Staphylococcus aureus were isolated on agar and inoculated to oxacillin screen agar to identify MRSA. 111 isolates were classified as CA-MRSA or HA-MRSA based on clinical history. Antibiotic susceptibility testing and testing for inducible resistance to clindamycin was performed. These results, MICs, patient demographics and clinical information were compared for each category.<br><br> Major epidemiological differences in CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA were demonstrated, proving the hypothesis. CA-MRSA patients were generally younger, healthier, and infections almost exclusively involved skin or underlying soft tissue. CA-MRSA was less resistant to antibiotics, usually only resistant to oxacillin and erythromycin. CA-MRSA rearely demonstrated inducible resistance to clindamycin. HA-MRSA pateitns were much older, had underlying diseases or conditions, and infections were rarely skin, but a variety of sources, such as blood, respiratory, and urinary. HA-MRSA was resistant to more antibiotics and usually demonstrated inducible resistance to clindamycin. Knowledge of and classification as CA-MRSA vs. HA-MRSA provides more timely, effective treatment in the absence of, or prior to antibiotic susceptibility results, aiding in improved care and reduced spread of infection.<br><br> Additional testing for mec-A gene and Panton-Valentine leukocydin would yield valuable data, as would the availability of more demographical information.

CPLD PREVENTION IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS: REDUCTION OF PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA BIOFILM AND VIRULENCE BY PUNICA GRANATUM
Maryam Khadijah Mohammed
Niceville Senior High School, Niceville, FL, USA

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most fatal hereditary disorder among American Caucasians, and the leading cause of chronic lung disease under the age of 21. Of the 70,000 CF patients worldwide, 30,000 reside in the U.S. CF patients suffer from a number of complications, including chronic progressive lung disease (CPLD), which causes 90% of CF mortalities. Of these cases, 61% are caused by P. aeruginosa biofilms. No safe treatment for these infections exists, as current treatments, including anti-inflammatory drugs, have numerous side effects. Although studies show cranberry inhibits E. coli biofilms in the urinary bladder, it is ineffective against biofilms of P. aeruginosa. Because some research has shown that Punica granatum (pomegranate) possesses anti-inflammatory properties, it was investigated for properties against P. aeruginosa. <br><br> A multi-faceted approach was used to investigate the effects of fresh and bottled P. granatum juices on P. aeruginosa. The effects on the biofilm were analyzed using microscopic and visual microcolony counts and microscopic examination of slides for inhibition of the extracellular matrix. The effects on pyocyanin, a virulence factor, were determined after examining P aeruginosa liquid culture for the presence of a green ring. Effects on capsule and cell size were evaluated by microscopic examination.<br><br> The data from this study reveal that P. granatum significantly reduces the formation of the P. aeruginosa biofilm, as well as its cell size and virulence. Fresh P. granatum juice was more effective than bottled juice in all respects, except for pyocyanin inhibition. This is the first study ever to demonstrate the efficacy of a natural treatment in preventing CPLD. These results show that P. granatum can be used as an essential component in formulating a safe treatment for P. aeruginosa biofilm infections and an effective prevention regimen for CPLD among CF patients.

SYNTHESIS OF RC-101 RESISTANT HIV-1: INVESTIGATING HIV-1 METHODS OF PEPTIDE EVASION
Andrew David Warren
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando FL, United States

RC-101 (an antimicrobial peptide that prevents HIV-1 infection) has proven capable of preventing long-term infection of cells. It also is capable of compensating for mutations within HIV-1's viral envelope and preventing infection by modified virus. This experiment focused on identifying mutations HIV-1 developed after 20 rounds of infection (from a previous experiment) and determining which of these mutations were key to partially evading RC-101's anti-HIV-1 activity. Three mutations (M1-3) were postulated to be of importance in HIV-1’s evasion of RC-101. The mutations were determined important if 1) that the mutation was in an area that coded for a part of the viral envelope that bound to cells and 2) that the mutation coded for an amino acid that would either be changed in polarity or would cause change in structure. In order to determine which mutation was most important, a pair of plasmid constructs capable of creating a mutated virus was located (JR-FL and NL-Luc). The idea was to create viruses with select mutations to determine which were important in evading RC-101. Multi-site-directed mutagenesis was used to modify JR-FL to contain select mutations to identify the important mutations. The viruses were then used to infect cells with RC-101 present. M2 and 3 (to a degree) were found to be most active. M1 didn't appear to be active in RC-101 evasion. Mutation 3 also appeared to have little activity against RC-101, and seemed to make the virus less fit to infect.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACTERIOPHAGES: A THIRD YEAR STUDY OF BACTERIOPHAGE GENOMES
Kyle Alexander Wallace
John Jay Science & Engineering Academy, San Antonio, TX, 78227

For years virologists have been oblivious to the potential impact bacteriophages could play in science: promote bioinformatic databases, further knowledge of biological and intermolecular systems, genetic vectors, and most importantly as natural antibiotics. Wommack (2000) estimates phage populations to gross 10^31, with this amount of influence the sequencing of bacteriophage genomes will play a crucial role in our understanding of the biosphere. <br><br> The intention is to extend scientists’ knowledge of environmental systems through the sequencing of novel bacteriophage genomes. I hypothesized that due to the known diversity within bacteriophage genomes (Hardies, 2005), there will be one or more unique viral regions.<br><br> The genomes were observed by creating primary and secondary phage cultures were cultivated with soil gathered from a local ranch. Bacterial colonies were typed, and phages were propagated via needle cloning, and purified with DNAse, RNAse, and ProteinaseK. Phage DNA was then sonicated, ligated to pUC118, transformed, and lastly minipreped. The phage DNA was sequenced using half-reactions. Bioinformatic databases were constructed and subjected to various programs to probe for biological structure and homologues. S.E.M. was also carried out on bacteriophage cultures.<br><br> In conclusion, sequencing the 1102phi3-1 genome illustrated the flawed nature of the phage nomenclature system through S.E.M. and the extent of homology between the 1102phi3-1 and Staphylococcal phage K genomes. A uniquely organized host-takeover mechanism was identified within an extraordinarily large terminal repeat containing B. subtilis sigma A-factors, many R.B.S.s and rho-factors, and host-takeover homologues.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF ALLIUM SATIVUM AND ANTIBIOTICS ON BACTERIA
Rebekah Anne Meller
Pettisville Local School, Pettisville, Ohio, USA

The public, doctors, and scientists are concerned bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics currently used. The problem was to compare the effectiveness of Allium sativum (garlic) to penicillin and ampicillin; and to determine if garlic and an antibiotic when combined would exhibit a synergistic effect. The hypothesis was garlic would demonstrate a comparable effectiveness to penicillin and ampicillin in inhibiting bacterial growth. In the presence of Allium sativum and an antibiotic together the zone of inhibition would increase. Petri dishes were divided into four quadrants. One half of the petri dishes were inoculated with Escherichia coli, and the other half were inoculated with Staphylococcus epidermidis. In three quadrants garlic soaked sterile disks, ampicillin disks, penicillin disks, ampicillin disks soaked with garlic, or penicillin disks soaked with garlic were placed. In the fourth quadrant a sterile disk soaked in distilled water was placed for the control. Each quadrant represented one trial and eighteen trials were conducted. Averages were compared and t tests were calculated to analyze results. The conclusion was garlic was more effective than penicillin and a synergistic effect was observed when penicillin and garlic were combined for both Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Garlic was more effective than ampicillin with Escherichia coli but not with Staphylococcus epidermidis. A synergistic effect was not observed with Escherichia coli for garlic and ampicillin combined. A synergistic effect was observed with Staphylococcus epidermidis when garlic and ampicillin were combined. This was not significant when compared to ampicillin alone.

TARGET BINDING BY PAPILLOMAVIRUS E6 ONCOPROTEINS
Brian Weber Vande Pol
Albemarle High School, Charlottesville Virginia, United States

Papillomaviruses cause benign tumors called papillomas or warts. The viral E6 oncogene is required for this. E6 binds to a short peptide sequence on a particular host cellular protein. This E6 binding sequence is known for only two papillomavirus types out of over 100. This project had two goals. First, to determine the short peptide sequence that E6 binds in additional papillomavirus types, and most importantly, to determine which E6 type will be best suited for structural studies. To determine the peptide binding sequence, we used a technique called phage display. In this technique, a library of engineered bacterial viruses called phage express randomly generated short peptide sequences that E6 might bind. Phage that bind to E6 are retained on immobilized E6 while non-binding phage are washed away, thus selecting for phage that express E6-binding peptides. We performed this technique successfully on three different E6 types, identifying peptides that were specific for binding to each particular E6 protein and some that could bind to more than one E6 protein type. We demonstrated that these peptides bound E6 in vivo in yeast. For structural studies, an E6 protein should bind its peptide well in vitro and in vivo. It was found that only BPV E6 met both of these criteria, making it the preferred model for studies of E6 structure. Such studies could serve as the basis for the future design of drugs to interfere with E6 functions. Such drugs could cure warts and cancers caused by papillomaviruses.

RNA PALINDROMES (INVERTED REPEATS) IN THE BIOINFORMATICS ANALYSIS OF MUTAGENESIS-PATHOGENESIS OF HEMAGGLUTININ AND OTHER SEGMENTS OF H5N1 AND H1N1 (1918 PANDEMIC) INFLUENZA
Alex Brendan Heeb
Heeb Homeschool, Chaffee, Missouri, USA

Frequent warnings predict the H5N1 virus could become pandemic, comparable to the 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Analysis of recovered 1918 H1N1 strains has not determined why the 1918 influenza was so virulent. Scientists also are unsure what mutations may cause H5N1 to become pandemic in humans. <br><br> This project tested if RNA palindromes (inverted repeats) contribute to the pathogenesis and mutagenesis of H5N1 and H1N1.<br><br> I downloaded RNA nucleotide sequences for H5N1 and H1N1 from the NCBI’s Influenza Virus Resource Center and from the Los Alamos National Laboratory Influenza Sequence Database. <br><br> I created a computer program to search for RNA palindromes. The program finds all perfect and spacer palindromes and computes their probability of being random occurrences.<br><br> For all three isolates from the 1918 H1N1 influenza virus in the United States, statistically significant, arm-length 12, spacer palindromes were detected in the hemagglutinin HA1 domain and were the largest palindromes found in all hemagglutinin isolates. MFOLD predicted this spacer palindrome forms a hairpin (stem-loop) structure. A CDC researcher stated that she was not aware of any studies of internal hairpin loops of influenza and translation. None of the scientific literature on 1918 H1N1 mentions this palindrome or hairpin structure. <br><br> While this length 12 palindrome exists in the hemagglutinin HA1 domain of the 1918 H1N1 pandemic strain, it is not found in the hemagglutinin HA1 domain of non-pandemic strains. This does not prove it is a causative factor in the extreme virulence of 1918 H1N1, but it does warrant further research.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF TURMERIC ON THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF DICTYOSTELIUM DISCOIDEUM AND ITS IMPLICATIONS TO CANCER
Sahitya Krishna Denduluri
St. Pius X High School, Albuquerque, NM, USA

In this project, turmeric, an Indian ayurvedic medicine was tested on Dictyostelium discoideum (Dd), a social amoeba that is used as a model organism for other types of cells and multicellular organisms. The goal of this project was to target one of the main components of cancer, chemotaxis, or the movement of cells by using Dd as a model. The first experiment involved testing the initial effects of varying concentrations of turmeric (0%, 0.05%, 0.1 %, 0.5%, and 1 %) on the growth and aggregation of Dd when the spice was inoculated with the cells. Experiment II dealt with these same effects, but when the Dd spores were plated with agar that was actually prepared with varying concentrations of turmeric (0%, 0.02%, 0.05%, 0.1 %, and 0.5%). Experiment III dealt with the negative effects of the same of turmeric from experiment II on the chemotaxis, or cell movement, of Dd during the onset of starvation. The hypotheses were demonstrated in that an increased concentration of turmeric correlates to a decrease in cell viability (experiments I and II) and cell chemotaxis (experiment III). Experiment III offered the most promising results in providing a possible way to inhibit the chemotaxis of malignant cancer cells, which move in a manner similar to Dd cells, throughout the body. Further research and experimentation would include studying the effects of turmeric on actual cancer cells, allowing for the possibility to reduce the abnormal spreading of the disease.

EFFICACY OF GINSENG AS A PHAGOCYTOSIS STIMULANT
Sarah Jayne Harshman
Mount de Chantal Visitation Academy, Wheeling West Virginia, USA

Popularity of phytomedicines has been steadily rising for decades, and while they have been used for thousands of years, little is known about their effectiveness. Many, such as ginseng, are said to be immune boosters, however the specific processes by which they support immunity remains unclear. This study investigated the feasibility of utilizing phytomedicines as a supplement for immune enhancement. The effectiveness of ginseng, a popularly touted immune booster, as a phagocytosis stimulant for the macrophage cell line P388- D1 was explored. Macrophages were inoculated with varying concentrations of ginseng and cultured with both opsonized and non-opsonized red blood cells. A known phagocytosis stimulant (lipopolysaccharide solution) was used as a control. Effectiveness of ginseng was determined by final numbers of cells that phagocytosed blood cells, number of blood cells phagocytosed per cell, and number of blood cells attached to macrophages. Statistically valid results indicated a higher phagocytosis rate and larger average number of cells phagocytosed per macrophage in cells treated with ginseng than regular opsonized and non-opsonized cells or cells treated with the control. <br><br>

APPALACHIAN TRAIL WATER SOURCES: SAFE OR NOT?
Erin Elizabeth Long
Angels Rest Homeschool, Pearisburg VA, USA

The purpose of my project was to test natural water sources along the Appalachian Trail in Giles County, Virginia. My belief was that I would find an abundance of pathogenic and nonpathogenic organisms. Since these organisms can be potentially dangerous to the welfare of a hiker, I also wanted to test the water samples with a type of purification. I chose Tincture of Iodine because it is an inexpensive and efficient method of purification. I tested for all platable waterborne diseases. I plated all samples on five different types of agar plates and incubated them. I also performed a Gram Stain test, Triple Sugar Agar Test, and API 20E test. The combined results of ALL tests show the presence of various organisms. Among several types of nonpathogenic organisms the most prominent type found in the samples was: fungus’ and bacillus. While these organisms are nonpathogenic they could have harmful effects after long periods of consumption. I also found multiple pathogenic organisms. Among these were: Enterobacter sakazakii, Pseudomonas fluorescens/putida, and Ochrobactrum anthropi. All of which can cause severe intestinal problems (e.g. diarrhea, constipation, intestinal bleeding). The samples that were treated with Tincture of Iodine showed no organisms, pathogenic or nonpathogenic. Through this project I have proved that natural water on the Appalachian Trail is not safe to drink and that Tincture of Iodine is an effective method of purification. I will be providing this information to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy for use in distribution materials. <br><br>

INVESTIGATION OF AN ANTIMICROBIAL EFFLUX PUMP-ENCODING GENE WITH AN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVE
Jennifer Ann Taylor
Florence High School, Florence, Alabama, United States

The increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance has made infections by Erwinia chrysanthemi and other enteric bacteria difficult to thwart. E. Chrysanthemi is an economically-important phytopathogen with a broad host range. Expression of acrAB, the gene that codes for the inner portion of a common multidrug resistance efflux pump, was monitored in E. chrysanthemi cultures throughout growth curves by detecting light production in a strain containing a plasmid with the acrAB promoter attached to a luciferase (lux) gene. Two distinct peaks of expression were consistently seen: one in late lag phase and one in late exponential phase. In the presence of phenolic acids or paraquat, lux activity was observed approximately two hours earlier than in cultures without these chemicals. Gene expression was also monitored during plant infections. Cellular stress in response to a changing environment likely has a pivotal role in up-regulating acrAB expression in E. chrysanthemi. Stress is a demonstrated trigger of acrAB expression in Escherichia coli. Two E. coli cultures were isolated from a sewage contaminated sample from the Tennessee River. A PCR using E. chrysanthemi primers showed one of the two E. coli cultures contained the acrAB gene. This efflux pump is a possible contributor to the developing threat of antibiotic resistant bacteria in the river environment. Due to its demonstrated similarity to members of the Enterobacteriacaea family, E. chrysanthemi can be used to safely study multidrug efflux pumps including AcrAB-TolC with results applicable to the fight against a broad range of resistant crop and human infections.

COMPREHENSIVE BACTERIAL IDENTIFICATION AND ANALYSIS SOFTWARE: PROTECTING THE ARMED FORCES AND IMPROVING HEALTHCARE WORLDWIDE
Benjamin Albert Schwank
James Madison High School, Vienna, VA, USA

Today, there are pressing needs to rapidly diagnose and understand disease and to mitigate potential acts of bio-warfare and bio-terrorism. In order to address these needs, a project was undertaken to facilitate the study of bacteria. This project involved the development of comprehensive software to rapidly identify and analyze bacterial DNA and amino acid sequences. This software is capable of comparing unknown input sequences (complete genomes, complete genes, other nucleotide sequences, complete proteins, and other amino acid sequences) to all currently known sequences, which were obtained from the DNA Databank of Japan. The user is able to narrow the database files against which the input sequence is searched by specifying known information about the sequence (e.g., whether it was sequenced from a plasmid), in order to reduce search time. This comparison utilizes search filters and an original algorithm, Slide Search, developed specifically for this software. The software also has a tool to aid researchers in determining applicable restriction enzymes for biotechnology research. A short side study was also conducted to compare the bacteria responsible for tuberculosis and leprosy. Despite being of the same genus, Mycobacterium, the complete genomes of these species were found to differ significantly in AT content and length. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was found to have 34% AT content and a length of approximately 4,400,000 nucleotides, while Mycobacterium leprae was found to have 42% AT content and a length of approximately 3,300,000 nucleotides. This suggests that the two species may not be as similar as previously thought.

AN UNLIKELY WEAPON AGAINST DEADLY BACTERIA: BACTERIOPHAGE THERAPY AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO TRADITIONAL TREATMENTS
Leslie Ann Hase
Merino Jr-Sr High School, Merino, CO, US

Bacteriophages, viruses that attack bacteria, were discovered in the early 20th century. When penicillin and other antibiotics were discovered, phage research was discontinued. Now due to the emergence of new antibiotic- resistant bacteria, bacteriophage research has been reinvestigated. The purpose of the experiment was to determine whether bacteriophages could change efficiently to infect bacterium that they are not specialized to. Whether a phage mixture (cocktail) increases the frequency of change was also observed in the research. <br><br>In this procedure, dilutions of the T4 coliphage were done in 3 different sets, one for E. coli K12, one for E. coli B, and for Enterobacter aerogenes. After the dilutions .1 mL of the bacterium was transferred into the tryptone tubes, this was done for 6 tubes for each bacterium. Then 1 mL of the T4 coliphage dilutions for 10-5 to 10-9 was also added to each tube and nutrient broth for the control tube. Plaque assays were completed then plates were observed and the plaques were counted. It was confirmed in the first two trials that the T4 coliphage was specialized to attack the E. coli K12 and the E. coli B. It wasn’t until the third trial that plaques were discovered on the Enterobacter aerogenes plates. This experimental data shows that the T4 coliphage was able to change its genetic material to infect a bacterium that is not specialized to. On the plate of E. coli K12 plaques that could be accurately counted were a total of 1909, and on E. coli B there were 916 plaques. And in the case of Enterobacter aerogenes there were 331 plaques. On the plaque containing the bacteriophage cocktail there were 669 plaques. Possible implications for this research include the development of a phage to treat cases of anthrax or botulism in bio-warfare, or simply just in every day cases of antibiotic resistance. <br><br>

FIRE ON THE MOUNTAIN
Lindsey Eva Rugh
Hotchkiss High School Hotchkiss, CO United States

This experiment is on the after effects of the Wakefield Fire that happened in 1994 in Paonia, Colorado. The researcher took soil samples from two areas of the mountainside; one where the land was burned, and one where the land was untouched by the fire. The objective was to test the soil samples for bacteria colony forming units and protozoa, and compare the soil samples from the burned area and the samples from the unburned area and see if the burn site samples had any deficiencies. The hypothesis was that the samples from the burn site would have a lower count of bacteria colony forming units and protozoa than the soil samples from the non-burn area. The researcher tested the soil samples for bacteria colony forming units by performing a bacteria plating process on the soil, and tested for protozoa by using a protozoa incubation method. The results of both tests showed that the soil samples from the burned area had a lower count of both bacteria colony forming units and protozoa. The researcher concluded that the soil of the burn site has deficiencies, compared to the soil from the non-burn site. The soil deficiency may be part of the cause of minimal regrowth on the burn site since the fire. This study will be extended into testing methods that could aid in the soil health and regeneration of plant life on the burn site.

THE EFFECTS OF FERRIC OXIDE ON K12 ESCHERICHIA COLI
Ganga Sudha Moorthy
Alva High School, Alva Oklahoma, USA

Escherichia coli, more commonly known as E. coli is one of the many species of bacteria that live in warm-blooded animals. It is usually harmless, but in certain cases it may be particularly dangerous. Although free iron levels available to bacteria are very small; human or animal tissues are the primary place for Escherichia coli to reproduce. To compensate for low iron availability Escherichia coli must evolve iron-transport systems to obtain iron. The purpose of this research project was to determine if increased amounts of ferric oxide produce growth in Escherichia coli. In addition, this research project was designed to determine if any morphological changes occur when increased amounts of ferric oxide were present. Various stains and tests were conducted on the individual Escherichia coli bacteria cultures. Plates of E. coli grown in solid media with varying amounts of ferric oxide and test tubes of E. coli grown in broth media with varying amounts of ferric oxide were observed. The samples were analyzed with a photo spectrometer to determine light transmittance, while under a digital microscope cell size was observed. T-values were calculated from the reported light transmittance of the control groups vs. the experimental groups, while r-values were calculated from cell diameter and length of the individual cells. The Escherichia coli grown in ferric oxide were shown to be significantly larger and greater in number than Escherichia coli grown without ferric oxide.

DO ALPHA TOCOPHEROL AND GAMMA TOCOPHEROL SYNERGISTICALLY INDUCE APOPTOSIS IN LUNG CANCER CELLS?
Shwetha Suresh Maddur
Novi Senior High School, Novi Michigan, United States 

Lung Cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in all races, genders, and socioeconomic groups. The purpose of this experiment is to join in the global attempt to change that, by determining if alpha tocopherol and gamma tocopherol could synergistically induce apoptosis in lung cancer cells. To determine whether the lung cancer cells become apoptotic due to the synergistic effects of the alpha and gamma tocopherol, some lung cancer cells in petri dishes were induced with only alpha tocopherol, and some with only gamma tocopherol. They were compared to the group of cells that were induced with both alpha and gamma tocopherol. A control group of cells was also prepared. One row of a 96 well plate also contained lung cancer cells. There were three control wells, three wells induced with a constant amount of alpha tocopherol, three wells induced with varying amounts of gamma tocopherol, and three wells with the combined chemicals. The petri dishes were read by a flow cytometry, and the 96 well plate by a WST assay. The result from the flow cytometry showed that the chemicals combined induced apoptosis in more cells than the gamma did alone, and less than the alpha did alone. The results of the WST assay showed that compared to the control, the alpha and gamma tocopherol combined killed more than the control when the gamma was high in concentration and not when the two chemicals were in a fifty fifty ratio. It seems the gamma decreased the apoptotic effect the alpha tocopherol had on the cells. 18.43% of the cells that were only induced with alpha underwent apoptosis, and only 1.50% of the cells induced with gamma tocopherol underwent apoptosis, so it shows that when the two chemicals are combined, the gamma tocopherol decreases the effect to around 5.72% of the cells being apoptotic. <br><br>

INHIBITING CLOSTRIDIUM PERFRINGENS IN POULTRY VIA EXTRACT USAGE - PHASE II
Joseph Robert Stunzi
Clarke Central High School, Athens, Georgia, USA

Clostridium perfringens is an anaerobic bacteria that poses a great threat within the poultry industry. The purpose of this project was to find an antimicrobial method for inhibiting Clostridium perfringens in poultry. In Phase I, phenols were found to have a high antimicrobial effect on the inhibition of Clostridium perfringens. Chamomile, hops, and green tea inhibited the most in Phase One experimentation. The researcher hypothesized that the minimum inhibitory concentration and pH for antimicrobials determined the amount of inhibition of Clostridium perfringens. He also hypothesized that hops and chamomile would inhibit Clostridium perfringens the most.<br><br> In Phase II Research, green tea proved to be the best inhibitory antimicrobial. Its minimal inhibitory concentration was found to be within a small margin of ten percent. Throughout the course of research, an extraction method was refined, tested, and developed to ensure maximum inhibition. A new method arose to extract the antioxidant components of green tea. This extraction method was developed in order to isolate the catechin antioxidants contained within green tea. Through HPLC, catechins were proven to be the key component of the extraction method. The researcher identified the minimal inhibitory concentration of this catechin extract to be approximately fifteen percent of a thirty percent solution. pH was shown to also have a significant impact on the affectivity of green tea extract on Clostridium perfringens. This research has provided an extraction method and the specifications for the inhibition of Clostridium perfringens within the poultry industry. <br><br>

THE ISOLATION AND ANALYSIS OF THE PRP8 GENE IN THE DIMORPHIC FUNGUS HISTOPLASMA CAPSULATUM
Hana Kamal Ali
Oak Grove High School, Hattiesburg MS, USA

Histoplasma capsulatum is a dimorphic fungus and the etiological agent of histoplasmosis, a respiratory fungal infection known to plague 500,000 people in the United States alone. Histoplasma capsulatum exists as small, airborne mold particles at room temperature (25C) that, when inhaled, transform into resilient, budding yeast cells in the lungs (37C). Scientists have proposed that histoplasmosis can be prevented by stopping the mold-to-yeast shift, but the actual explanation for the transformation is still unknown. Scientists are now analyzing an array of genes in the fungus to determine whether they trigger the transformation or are essential to it; one of the identified genes was prp8. It is speculated that the prp8 gene splices differently in each form of the fungus, and may be essential to the shift. If the prp8 gene is critical for the mold to yeast shift, then its manipulation may play a paramount role in the prevention of histoplasmosis. This project examines the splicing characteristics of the prp8 gene in the mold verses the yeast phase of Histoplasma capsulatum. Currently, the researcher has successfully isolated the prp8 gene from Histoplasma capsulatum. So far, the researcher has located the prp8 gene and mapped its intein and extein boundaries; designed primers to excise a specific portion of the sequence; amplified the prp8 sequence; treated the sequence with a restriction enzyme; phosphatase and enzyme treated the expression vector; and ligated the two sequences. The researcher is currently attempting to transform this plasmid into E.coli.

IMPROVING THE WIDELY USED PTRC99A EXPRESSION VECTOR
Suman Nag
Brookwood High School, Snellville Georgia, United States of America 

The widely used pTrc99A expression vector is an E. coli vector used to transport and express genes. The problem with pTrc99A is the location of a Shine-Dalgarno (SD) ribosome binding site at the beginning of the plasmid’s cloning region. The Shine-Dalgarno produces a series of amino acids that are initiated by the SD’s start codon and are able to reproduce in the proceeding cloning sites. When inserting a gene of interest into this region, either the plasmid’s original protein is inframed into the protein of the gene or the expression of the original protein takes precedence over the expression of the gene. <br><br> The purpose of this project is to improve expression vector pTrc99A for better gene expression by removing the SD-Site from the plasmid to eliminate the overproduction of unwanted proteins in the region. If the SD-Nco1 gene is PCR amplified, given a restriction digest with enzymes EcoR1 and Nde1, and then cloned, then the experiment will yield a plasmid with a potentially better gene expression. <br><br> Through PCR, the SD-Nco1 gene was amplified and the product was confirmed with gel isolation. The restriction digest was performed on both the plasmid and the PCR product with enzymes EcoR1 and Nde1. Finally, cloning took place through the ligation of the gene into the plasmid and reproduction of that plasmid in E Coli. The DNA sequencing diagnostic test of the clones supports the hypothesis. The experiment has successfully removed the SD site from the plasmid, creating a vector with potentially better gene expressions.

THE EFFECT OF SELECTED ANTIOXIDANTS ON CILIA REGENERATION IN TETRAHYMENA
Kate Elizabeth Christiaens
North Toole County High School, Sunburst MT, United States of America

The purpose of this study was to determine if there is a significant difference between “return to motility” rates in cilia isolated Tetrahymena pyriformis that were separately treated with a medium and a Vitamin B-complex supplement. This study involved a challenging procedure which accomplished deciliation of Tetrahymena, a model organism used for cilia functions in the trachea and female reproductive organs. By achieving a cilia isolated organism, I was then able to add the variable (Vitamin B-complex). Thus, the “return to motility” rates that I achieved were then subjected to an unpaired t-test which resulted in a significant difference between the control and experimental group at the 95% confidence level. This study suggests the possibility of regenerating damaged cilia in smokers using an antioxidant, Vitamin B-complex, supplement treatment.

MICROBIAL GROWTH COMPARISON AFTER SURGICAL PREP
Kayla Ann Grint
Weber High School, Pleasant View, Utah

The purpose of this experiment is to discover whether Nolvasan, Alcohol, or a Nolvasan-Alcohol combination is the best way to scrub an animal for surgery. I took samples from dog and cat spays and neuters after scrubbing them with the three different techniques. The experiment didn't actually involve the animals or cause them any pain. I just scrubbed them and swipped bacteria from their abdomens. I grew the bacteria on blood agar by means of an isolation streak to count the colonies, and grew them in Mueller-Hinton Broth to obtain spectrophotometry transmittance results. The Nolvasan-Alcohol combination plates grew no bacteria and the tubes had the highest transmittance; therefore, this technique appears to be the best.

THE RELATIVE SENSITIVITY OF FUNGAL MYCELIUM TO ALLELOPATHIC CHEMICALS PRODUCED BY NOXIOUS WEEDS
Angela Roberta Tomsheck
North Toole County High School, Sunburst, MT, United States of America

This study focused on whether or not allelopathic chemicals in noxious weeds could manipulate the soil fungal community.<br><br> My goals were to determine if extracts from Euphorbia esula, Centaurea maculosa, and Kochia scoparia would affect the growth of two soil fungi, Fusarium pseudograminearum (Fpg) and Pilobolus crystallinus (Pc); to determine if extracts would affect a fungus with a beneficial role in the environment (Pc) differently than a fungus with a harmful effect on the environment (Fpg); and to determine if the part of the plant from which the extract was taken (root, stem, leaf, and seed) would influence the fungus differently. <br><br> I collected samples of each weed, separated the plant structures, and made extracts of each. I prepared test plates by cutting wells into the agar and transferring fungal cores from stock cultures. I then filled the wells in the control plates with millipored, distilled water and the wells in the experimental plates with the appropriate millipored extract. Each trial consisted of three control plates and three experimental plates. After a 48-hour waiting period, I conducted measurements daily for five days to record growth rate as well as the occurrence of inhibition zones around the wells. <br><br> T-test results revealed that all extracts significantly inhibited the growth of Fpg. Sixty-six percent of the extracts partially inhibited Fpg, while 33% showed complete inhibition. T-tests also revealed that 8 of 12 extracts significantly inhibited the growth of Pc, with 50% of the extracts showing partial inhibition, and 8% showing complete inhibition. <br><br>

ARKANSAS HONEY COMPARED TO OTHER REGIONAL HONEY
Ethan Muriah Clement
Sheridan Freshman Academy Sheridan Arkansas United States of America

Honey is a thick, sweet liquid made from the by-product of bees. Raw honey(which has never been heated over 54.4 degrees Celsius) from different countries such as Australia, New Zealand and the Middle East have been used in hospitals for the treatment of burns, cuts, and scrapes. The antimicrobial properties of honey include a pH level of 3.9, hydrogen peroxide production, and a few water molecules. <br><br> This experiment was conducted to prove or disprove the hypothesis that raw Arkansas honey inhibits the growth of bacteria better than other regional honeys. The hypothesis stated that 2004 Huddleston House honey would inhibit the growth of bacteria and produce a larger zone of inhibition than all other regional honeys.<br><br> Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus were grown from frozen stock and inoculated onto tryptic soy agar plates. Seven 5 millimeter holes were punched evely into the plates. Honey was then added to each hole. The plates were incubated at 37 degees Celsius and the results were measured 24 hours later.<br><br> The hypothesis was proven incorrect. Though both the 2004 and 2005 Hudddleston House honey were proven to be great inhibitors of the bacteria tested. Weber Honey from Tennessee produced larger zones of inhibition, but only by one or two millimeters. The other honeys tested did not inhibit the bacterial growth as well. The conclusion of this experiment was that raw Arkansas honey was not the best inhibitor of bacterial growth.

ADAPTIVE RESISTANCE OF E. COLI TO TRICLOSAN AND CROSS-RESISTANCE TO ANTIBIOTICS
Steven Konstantin Lisica
Bergen County Academies, Hackensack NJ, United States

Recent concern has been directed towards the public health risks imposed by the increasing prevalence of multiple antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which may be direct results of the unregulated use of triclosan. Many of these antibiotic-resistant bacteria may have been created through the natural phenomena of adaptive resistance to triclosan and cross-resistance to antibiotics.<br><br> The purpose of this research was to determine if the adaptive resistance of E. coli K12 to triclosan led to cross-resistance to the antibiotics ampicillin, chloramphenicol, novobiocin, penicillin, penicillin G, and streptomycin and to evaluate the current proposed theories regarding the mechanisms of antibiotic cross-resistance in bacteria. For this study, E. coli was exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of triclosan that gradually increased in concentration over four cyclic exposures. After each cycle, the cultures were tested for antibiotic sensitivity by using antibiotic disks and by measuring the zones of inhibition in order to study the development of antibiotic cross-resistance.<br><br> The data indicated that cross-resistance of E. coli between triclosan and the antibiotics ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and streptomycin had occurred and was verified through statistical analysis with ANOVA and Student’s t-Tests. However, E. coli was not readily adaptable to resist the effects of triclosan, although some adaptive resistance did occur. These results suggest that the targets of the antibiotics had no effect in determining antibiotic cross-resistance and that the cross-resistance was most likely caused by multi-drug-resistant efflux pumps. This outcome signifies that the uncontrolled, household use of triclosan can have potential, public health effects through the creation of antibiotic resistant bacteria.

USE OF A PARAMYXOVIRUS TO REDUCE TUMOR DEVELOPMENT IN-VIVO AND KILL TRANSFORMED CELLS IN-VITRO
Nandini Sarma
Shawnee Mission East High School, Prairie Village, KS, USA

The use of viral therapy as an alternative method for cancer treatment is a relatively new and growing field in cancer research. In this study, a paramyxovirus was evaluated for its growth and replication potential in two different transformed cell lines. It was also tested for its effect on herpesvirus induced tumors. In both transformed cell lines the virus replicated very well, killing more than 90% of the transformed cells within 72 hours of infection, however, the virus yield from the avian transformed cells was higher than that of the primate transformed cells. This virus was not previously known to replicate in these transformed cell lines. Therefore, a new method was found to replace the current cumbersome and costly method of using embryonated eggs for manufacturing vaccines against this virus. In the second part of the study, 40 chicks were exposed to an oncogenic strain of herpesvirus, and two weeks later 10 of them were treated with the paramyxovirus. The birds were later examined for tumors in various internal organs. In the paramyxovirus treated group, tumor development was significantly reduced (p≤ 0.05) compared to the non-treated control group. These new findings hold great potential for an alternate technique of growing the virus for vaccine production, and more importantly, a possible method for cancer treatment.

ANALYZING THE ROLE OF GMMA-DELTA TCR+ T LYMPHOCYTES IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM (AAA)
Yandi Lu
Suncoast Community HIgh School

Although it is well documented that infiltrating T-cells are essentially always present in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) lesions, very little is known about the role of T-cells in the initiation and propagation of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease. The overall objective of the research is to determine whether AAA is a specific antigen-drive T-cell disease and to identify the antigen(s) recognized (self or nonself) by the T-cells that initiate and/or propagate the disease. Recent studies have demonstrated the presence of substantial proportions of clonally expanded alpha-beta TCR+ T-cells. In addition to the alpha-beta TCR, a second TCR, the gamma-delta TCR, has been identified and it is comprised of two highly polymorphic polypeptide chains. The majority of the alpha beta TCR+ T-cells recognize peptides in association with MHC. In contrast, the majority of the ãä TCR+ T-cells recognize whole proteins. The hypothesis to be tested in this study is whether T-cell infiltrating AAA lesions contain substantial proportions of oligoclonal ãä TCR+ T-cellls and whether these T-cells recognize self or nonself antigens. Sequence analysis following V-specific PCR amplification and cloning revealed the presence of substantial proportions of multiple identical VãI, VãII, Vä1, and Vä2 TCR transcripts in AAA lesions in all eight patients examined. These clonal expansions are highly significant (P < 0.0001). These results suggest the presence of oligoclonal ãä TCR+ T-cells in AAA lesions. These oligoclonal T-cell populations in AAA lesions may have undergone antigen-driven proliferation and clonal expansion in vivo, in response to as yet unidentified antigens. These T-cells may be important in the pathogenesis of the disease. These results support the view that AAA is a specific antigen-driven T-cell disease.

This project is the research result of a series of molecular biology experimentations initially aimed at identifying the pathogens of the mulberry mosaic wither disease (MMWd) which pathogens unidentified. Research processes mainly involves gene cloning and secondary structure analysis of mulberry mosaic wither viroid (MMWVd). The research finally shows the pathogen of MMWd is an unknown viroid contains 472 nucleotides. The proposed MMWVd¡¯s secondary structure calculated by computer program is branched, similar to CChMVd.<br><br>Crude nucleic acids were extracted and purified from healthy and affected mulberry leaves. Return-PAGE (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) under denaturing conditions was used to detect the pathogens.<br><br>Viroid RNA molecule was found in nucleic acids extract from affected mulberry leaves and did not appear in healthy tissue.<br><br>RT-PCR successfully amplified viroid RNA, while similar products were not obtained from nucleic acids of healthy tissue under the same RT-PCR condition. The expected amplified products were then cloned in pGM-T vector. <br><br>Fragments of the recombinant plasmids after digested by EcoRI endoribonuclease showed that it contained the full-length inserts of MMWVd. The recombinant plasmids were sequenced. RNAdraw was chosen to analysis viroid¡¯s nucleic acids secondary structure.<br><br>In summary, viroid RNA molecule, like what were originally expected, were identified as the pathogens of MMWd and later, name as Mulberry Mosaic Wither viroid. Known the pathogen, RT-PCR technique and Return-PAGE for viroid RNA helped develop a complete technique for the detection of MMWd, which can be a useful support for the prevention and treatment of the disease.<br><br>

CULTIVATION OF PLEUROTUS OSTREATUS FROM AGROINDUSTRIAL BIOSOLIDS
Rodrigo Franco Ferreira
Colegio Interativa, Londrina, Parana, Brazil

The cultivation of Pleurotus ostreatus in Brazil and in the world has been achieving great importance among the main cultivable eatable mushrooms, which are commercialized as “Hiratake” and “Shimeji”. Even though the Pleurotus ostreatus has already been cultivated in different agricultural residues, the majority of Brazilian chain needs a genetic improvement.<br><br> The biosolids were obtained from various sources and different locations. Orange Peel (OP), Rice Peel (RP) and Corn-cob (CC) residues were used as subtract in order to acquire micelial biomass and “Pleurotus ostreatus” basidiocarps. Four repetitions of each subtract were placed in propylene bags (500 gr of subtract/bag), autoclaved, inoculated with about 2 gr of the inoculum and incubated at 25 degrees Celsius. After the colonization, the bags were open and distributed at random in a growth chamber for the fructification induction. The mushrooms were collected, weighted and the biological efficiency was calculated in percentage, expressed in terms of fresh weight of produced mushrooms in connection with the dry weight of the initial subtract. The data were submitted to visual qualitative analysis in terms of commercial production and based on the physical-chemical conditions offered.<br><br> The subtract, which hold the OP and CC residues, present a potential for micelial biomass production and also commercial production of Pleurotus ostreatus. The corn-cob showed potential for the mushroom production presenting a biological efficiency of 21%. However, a genetic improvement is suggested in the used chain in order to raise the productivity.<br><br>

ANTIBIOTIC ALGAE THE EFFECTS OF MARINE PLANT EXTRACTS ON E. COLI AND B. MEG
Leah T'Keya Guthrie
The Good Hope School, Frederiksted, VI

There is a lack of new “first in class” antibiotics desired by pharmaceutical companies. Traditional medicinal plants of the Virgin Islands have proven to have antibacterial properties. I previously found antibacterial properties in tamarind and have successfully replicated my results. The purpose of my experiment is to extend my search for antibacterial properties to marine plants, more specifically in Padina sanctae-crusis and Chnoospora minima. For my experiment I used Bacilius megatrium as a representative of gram-positive bacteria and Escherichia coli as a representative of gram negative bacteria. In order to determine whether there are antibacterial properties in marine plants I collected marine plants and made extractions using acetone, ethanol and water. Other procedures included a gram stain, halo assay and broth dilution assay. I found antibacterial properties in Padina sanctae-crusis, Chnoospora minima, and successfully replicated my previous results of antibacterial properties in tamarind. Through six trials of halo assay’s and two broth dilution the results of my experiment show that the pharmaceutical industry has tremendous potential in the Virgin Islands and more specifically St. Croix. A pharmaceutical industry on St.Croix would create more jobs, inviting more local students with an interest in medicine to stay on St.Croix rather than going abroad. The combination of knowledge from tradition healers and research science has proven to be successful.

THE MICROBIOLOGICAL QUALITY OF JUICE
Sol Abigail Mercado Jimenez
Timoteo Delgado School, Hatillo, Puerto Rico

The problem was how microbial quality of juices imported from Central America compare with those prepared in Puerto Rico. The hypothesis established that juices imported from Central America have low microbial quality and juices prepared in P.R. have a better microbial quality. <br><br> A dilution of each of the two kinds of juices was prepared. It consisted of 25mL of each kind of juice separately in 225 mL of Peptone Water.<br><br> From this dilution serial dilutions were made (0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001) Yeast Malt Agar with citric acid (pH4.5) was used to detect microbial growth using the pour plate technique. Four Petri dishes were prepared for each dilution the imported juice labeled as juice #1 plates A, B, C, D. Four other plates were prepared and labeled in the same way but for the dilutions from Juice #2, the local one. One mL from each dilution of each juice was added to the corresponding plates. Later they were placed in an incubator for seven days at 25°C. Results showed that in dishes C and D, where dilution was higher, there was less microbial growth. In plates A, B, C, D with juice from Central America there was greater growth than in plates A, B, C, D with juice from P.R. The microbial growth in juice #1 (C.A.) was (5,500) however the microbial growth in Juice #2 (P.R.) was (3,000). The conclusion obtained was that local juice appeared to have better microbial quality than the juice from Central America.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF ALLIUM SATIVUM AND MELALEUCA ALTERNIFOLIA ON FUSOBACTERIUM NECROPHORUM.
Jessica Rae Parries
Estacada High School, Estacada, Oregon, USA

Abstract<br><br> The effects of Allium sativum, and Melaleuca alternifolia on Fusobacterium necrophorum. The purpose of this study is to see whether or not if these antimicrobial agents are capable of eradicating this bacterium in the equine hoof just as efficient as the Commercial product. The chemicals used in today’s treatments for thrush use highly toxicating chemicals that can be harmful for human and equine, causing breakouts, rashes, and soreness. Allium sativum, and Melaleuca alternifolia, are both natural antimicrobial agents and proven to kill various types of bacteria such as Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and E-coli. Bacteria was collected from a horses sulci found in the frog under the hoof. Then it was grown in Brain-Heart Infusion broth in anaerobic bags and incubated for 48 hours at a temperature of 37C. 21 plates were used; each agent was applied to 9 plates, using the concentration of 100% of teh agents. The measure of eradication was taken from the zone of inhibition. This study showed the average zone of inhibition on all tests, Tea tree oil had an average zone of 7.95mm; Garlic had an average of 5.02mm. These were then compared to the Iodine, and the Commercial product. The Iodine had an average zone of 8mm; the Commercial product averaged 12.5mm. This shows that the Commercial product was the most effective when compared to the commercial products, but for the antimicrobial agents Tea tree oil was the most effective.

AN IN-VITRO STUDY OF THE ANTIMICOTIC PROPERTIES FOR THE PHOSPHOLIPASE A-2 IN THE TREATMENT OF CANDIDA ALBICANS
Josue E. Juan-Martinez
Blanca Malaret High School, Sabana Grande, P.R. 

The purpose of this investigation was to determine the antimicotic activity of the enzyme phospholipase A-2 on the yeast Candida albicans. Apitoxin (honey bee venom), which is one of the enzyme producers, was used for the susceptibility test. Results showed a 100% of effectiveness. Then, the active ingredient that has the antimicotic properties in the bee venom, phospholipase A-2, was identified. Once again, susceptibility tests were performed, but this time with the enzyme in two different concentrations, 50% and 100%. The ranges of the inhibitory zones for a 50% concentration of the enzyme were between 3.8 and 5.0 centimeters. For a 100% concentration of the enzyme the ranges were between 5.1 and 5.7 centimeters. Bigger inhibitory zones were obtained with more concentration of this enzyme. <br><br> Carbohydrates synthesis tests were conducted demonstrating that C. albicans in the control group fermented the three sugars used (glucose, sucrose and lactose), but the presence of carbon dioxide gas was only detected for sucrose. The experimental groups showed that this enzyme decreased the yeast fermentation when the concentration of it was increased. For the hanging-drop test the results demonstrated, thru microscopic observation, that the enzyme phospholipase A-2 destroyed the wall and cellular membrane of the yeast cells. Finally it was concluded that the enzyme phospholipase A-2 is very effective in the treatment of Candida albicans. As a future projection a dermatological ointment for the treatment of candidiasis can be developed.<br><br>

STUDY OR THE PRESENCE OF SALMONELLA IN REPTILES
Omar Andre Rivera
University Gardens High School, SanJuan, Puerto Rico

This study investigated the presence of Salmonella in reptiles of the following orders: Crocodylia, Squamata, Testudinata and if there was a relationship between the habitat in captivity of the animals and the amount of Salmonella in the reptiles. The goal was to create awareness of the danger of having reptiles as pets. The reptiles used were: Caiman crocodiles (Spectacles Cayman), Python regius (Ball python), Elaphe guttata guttata (Corn snake), Clemmus insculpta (Wood turtle), Geochelone carbonaria (Red foot), Tilicua inteumedia (Blue tongue), and Elaphe guttata (Rat snake). The hypothesis was that cayman will have the largest amount of Salmonella in his body, while the blue tongue will have the smallest amounts, and that there is a relationship between the type of habitat in captivity and the amount of salmonella in the reptiles. Salmonella tests were done for these reptiles. Cotton swabs were rubbed against the animal’s cloaca and later these cotton swabs were rubbed on the culture medium and incubated for 24 hours. The results showed: 25 salmonella colonies in the cayman, 10 in the ball python, 9 in the corn snake, 2 in the red foot, one in the wood turtle, one in the blue tongue and one in the rat snake. It was found that reptiles in less-hygienic habitats had a higher amount of Salmonella. In conclusion the results backed the stated hypothesis. This work is important to alert the community on the dangers that Salmonella can cause to human beings.

INVESTIGATION OF EYE INFECTIONS: BACTERIAL ADHERENCE VS. CONTACT POLYMER TYPE & THE ANTIBIOTIC PROPERTIES OF CONTACT SOLUTIONS
Katie Joan Nix
Grove High School, Grove, OK USA

Eye infections are a problem associated with wearing contacts. Extended wear contacts pose an increased risk of infection. The question posed in this project: Does the type of polymer the contact is made of influence bacterial adherence to that contact? Another question posed is which type of contact solution kills the most bacteria?<br><br> It was hypothesized that the polymers with the higher water content would adhere the most bacteria because they are softer. It was further hypothesized that the cleaning/disinfectant solution would kill the most bacteria.<br><br> Four trials were done on each type of polymer. The contacts were soaked in a bacterial solution then removed and placed in sterile saline solution and shaken. The saline solution was tested for bacteria with a 10ul look and cultured overnight in body temp incubator. All pre and post CFU’s were determined and a percentage of bacterial adherences were calculated.<br><br> Results mostly supported the hypothesis. Two of the highest water content polymers did adhere the highest amount of bacteria and two of the lowest water content polymers had some of the lowest bacterial adherences.<br><br> It was also discovered that the older polymers adhered less bacteria. Sterile paper discs were soaked in solution and placed on nutrient plates that were streaked with bacteria. The contact solution that killed the most bacteria was the cleaning/disinfectant type. This supported the second hypothesis. The saline solution and multi-purpose solution killed no bacteria.<br><br> Only seven different polymers were tested because of time and resources. There are hundreds of polymers on the market. It is suggested that all polymers be tested to see if the trend seen in this study is supported more fully.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE LEGIONELLA VIP PROTEINS
Jennifer Michelle Schindler
Oceanside High School, Oceanside, NY, USA

Legionnaire’s Disease is a severe pneumonia that is caused by the gram-negative bacteria Legionella pneumophila. This pathogen enters the human respiratory system through man-made water aerosols and subsequently infects macrophages. Legionella pneumophila escapes the normally effective lysosomal degradation pathway in macrophages by using a Type IV Secretion System to inject pathogenic “effector” proteins. These effector proteins include VipA, which was identified in a screen for proteins that disrupt the intracellular trafficking in yeast. VipA is a 35 kDa protein that consists of an amino terminal Coiled-Coil domain and a carboxy terminal Proline Rich domain. The purpose of this study was to learn which region of VipA was responsible for this misdirecting of vesicular trafficking. To explore this, mutations were introduced into VipA and a loss in the ability of the mutant protein to block vesicular trafficking was tested. Mutations were introduced by either a PCR based deletional approach or a random transposon based mutagenesis approach. Five of the random mutations that blocked VipA function were identified and mapped upstream of the Coiled-Coil domain. These results demonstrated that a novel amino terminal domain plays a critical role in the ability of VipA to promote Legionella pneumophila infections. A continuation of studies on the mechanisms of how VipA domains block vesicular trafficking may lead to the development of target medications to prevent future Legionnaire’s Disease fatalities.

THE EFFECT OF ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT AND MICROGRAVITY ON GROWTH PATTERNS OF BACILLUS SUBTILIS
Ragini Annesha Basu
Roanoke Valley Governor's School, Roanoke, Virginia, USA

The purpose of this study was to determine how populations of Bacillus subtilis grow in ultraviolet (UV) light and microgravity. A study done at Clark University reported that UV light changes the morphology of B. subtilis colonies. When B. subtilis that were growing on agar plates were uniformly irradiated with UV light, the bacteria migrated to the edges of the plate, and when the radiation was turned off, they moved back to the central region of the dish. On the other hand, several studies have indicated that microgravity stimulates the growth of many types of bacteria, including B. subtilis. In this study, it was hypothesized that a combination of these two factors - UV light and microgravity - would change the growth patterns of B. subtilis that are subjected to either UV light or microgravity alone. Agar plates inoculated with B. subtilis were exposed to a) UV radiation and microgravity, b) microgravity alone, c) UV light alone, or d) neither variable. Microgravity was simulated using clinostats. These plates were photographed and analyzed using the image-analysis software ImageJ. Bacterial density and bacterial density distribution were measured indirectly by measuring pixels. Plates from group (a) were compared to the other three groups: (b), (c), and (d). Statistical analysis indicated that the growth patterns of B. subtilis populations in the different groups were not significantly different from each other.<br><br>

PHOTOENZYMATIC REPAIR: THE EFFECT OF UV-A AND UV-B RADIATION ON CILIATES
Eric Alan Sherman
Ephrata Senior High School, Ephrata, PA, USA

This research investigates the potential for photoenzymatic repair (PER) in four ciliate species by examining population changes resulting from exposure to photoreactivating radiation (PRR), a combination of UV-A radiation and visible light. The significance of PER may become more important as global conditions allow increasing levels of UV radiation to penetrate the ozone layer. A population increase after exposure to PRR would support evidence of PER and the existence of intracellular photolyase. Photolyase, when activated by UV-A, causes cleaving of pyrimidine dimers that bind adjacent DNA base pairs during UV-B induced photochemical injury. PER repairs the DNA and allows continued replication. Each species of ciliate (Tetrahymena sp., Euplotes sp., Glaucoma sp., and Cyclidium sp.) was exposed under controlled conditions to three different light scenarios. Test conditions included a dark control (36 hours darkness), a UV-B control (12 hours UV-B radiation and 36 hours concurrent fluorescent light) and a PRR trial (12 hours UV-B radiation followed by 12 hours UV-A radiation with 36 hours of concurrent fluorescent light). UV-B, UV-A, and fluorescent lamps simulated naturally-occurring damaging, repairing, and visible solar radiation, respectively. Tetrahymena sp. populations increased after exposure to PRR and demonstrated significant evidence of PER and the presence of photolyase (p<0.0001). Euplotes sp. and Cyclidium sp. exhibited high rates of mortality after exposure to either UV-B or PRR, indicating no PER potential (p<0.0001). Glaucoma sp. populations experienced no significant change after exposure to UV-B or PPR indicating limited or no PER potential (p<0.01).

FINDING AND MAPPING UNKNOWN MUTATIONS ON THE T4RII BACTERIOPHAGE USING COMPLEMENTATION AND RECOMBINATION TECHNIQUES
Michael Scott van Dijk
Pleasant Grove High School, Pleasant Grove City, Utah, USA

Throughout history, spontaneously mutating viruses have resulted in many world pandemics. Most recently there has been a lot of interest in the Avian Bird Flu which may be the source of the next world pandemic. When viruses mutate, finding the location of the unknown mutation often aids scientists in quickly producing a vaccine for distribution around the world. <br><br><br>I wanted to learn how to map the location of unknown mutations on viruses so that someday I might be able to help stop world pandemics. During my research, I learned that bacteriophages are very similar to viruses. I also learned about Max Delbruck and the methods that he developed for locating mutations on bacteriophages.<br><br><br>Using Delbruck's methods of complementation and recombination I mapped the location of two unknown mutations on bacteriophages. By combining the known mutant bacteriophage (T4rIIA) with the bacteriophage containing the mutation at an unknown location, and then spotting the mixture of bacteriophages onto the host bacteria E. coli K12 (lambda), the mutated cistron was found. <br><br><br>Once the mutated cistron had been located, recombination was used to find which segment of the cistron was mutated. To determine which segment of cistron A was mutated, the bacteriophage with the unknown mutation location was combined with bacteriophages r1272, rPT1, and rA105. These three bacteriophages each have different portions of cistron A deleted. By observing mortality patterns in the host bacteria, the location of the mutation within cistron A was determined.<br><br>

IN VITRO ASSESSMENT OF FRANCISELLA NOVICIDA TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVATION FACTORS MGLA AND IGLC WITH ADDITIONAL CYTOPLASMIC PROTEINS
Cory John Millmier
Central Lee High School, Donnellson, Iowa, United States

The organism Francisella tularensis, the etiological agent of rabbit fever, is an aerobic, gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium that is carried by rabbits or other small rodents. F. tularensis has been a bio-warfare concern since World War II. To combat rabbit fever, the proteins that associate within F. tularensis must be isolated. Previous research has shown proteins MglA and IglC must be present in the cytoplasmic fluid of F. tularensis in order for the disease to survive. This project was conducted to determine if additional proteins may interact with MglA or IglC to provide intercellular survival for F. novicida.<br><br> Francisella novicida was used as a surrogate form of Francisella tularensis. F. novicida was added to Luria (LB) broth and centrifuged 3X to gain F. novicida cytoplasmic contents. A French Press was utilized to disrupt F. novicida cells. Affinity chromatography was performed using Nickel Chelate Control, Maltose Binding Protein Control (MBP), MBP-MglA, and MBP-IglC columns. SDS-PAGE was conducted to view additional bonding cytoplasmic proteins. The first SDS-PAGE contained too much background so a chromatogram was conducted. Procedures were repeated for a second SDS-PAGE using a gradient elution with similar bonding proteins.<br><br> New proteins were found to bind with MglA, but not with IglC. With the discovery of proteins associating with MglA, it may be possible through specific chemotherapeutic intervention, that reagents could be placed upon these proteins to inhibit the association with F. novicida. Antibiotics are utilized to cure tularemia, but new strains can be developed with the intention of resisting antibiotics.<br><br>

A QUANTITATIVE ASSAY OF FOOD-BORNE BACTERIA IN PREPACKAGED FRESH-CUT PRODUCE
Ying Fan
Cookeville High School, Cookeville, TN, USA

This project follows the developmental growth of bacteria primarily found in ready-to-eat salads of Lactuca sativa and Spinacia oleracea. A fluorescence-based assay of animate and deceased surface bacteria in various vegetables with LIVE/DEAD BacLight was used to determine surface bacterial populations on microscope fields. The types of prepackaged vegetables studied included iceberg lettuce, romaine lettuce, and spinach. Expiration date, content, packaging, and temperature variables as well as controls were tested. Two-day incubations of ready-to-eat spinach in 12 C, 18 C , and 22 C were the independent variables for temperature variation. <br><br> Based on this study, it can be concluded that the surface bacteria in prepackaged vegetables multiply rapidly when nearing expiration. Meanwhile, the fresh-cut spinach showed 2.87 times surface concentration of bacteria versus prepackaged lettuce and a 1.25 times surface concentration versus prepackaged romaine, signifying that the surface bacteria concentration in prepackaged spinach is higher than any fresh-cut vegetable with the same expiration date. Unpackaged, loose-leaf spinach had a 6.67 times higher surface bacteria concentration than prepackaged spinach. The temperature is also an important factor in affecting bacterial development, inhibiting about 1.59E+07 more bacteria/mL/g as storage temperature dropped from 22 C to 12 C. <br><br> Growth in the number of bacteria-caused diseases contracted by humans, shown in the form of increasingly common outbreaks, brings more public attention on the health issues associated with prepackaged produce. This quantitative assay of surface bacteria found on fresh-cut salads provides valuable information and fulfills the curiosity of scientists and the general public.<br><br>

CD20 INVOLVEMENT IN HYPOXIA INDUCIBLE FACTOR (HIF-Á) STABILIZATION
Edison Wakulyaka
Somerville High School, Somerville, Massachusetts, United States of America

Rituximab (IDEC-C2B8, Mabthera®) is a chimeric (human-mouse) monoclonal antibody (MoAb) against the B-cell specific CD20-antigen. It has been used for the clinical treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Some patients experienced a first Infusion reaction characterized by Hypoxia (Bronchospasm) which, as a precaution, required stopping therapeutic treatment. This is a project to test whether components of the anti-CD20 are directly involved in hypoxic response, in the presence of dioxygen. <br><br>The transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor alpha-subunit (HIFalpha) is essential in the cellular response to the stress of hypoxia. In normoxia, 4-hydroxylation of human HIF-alpha at Pro402 or Pro564 peptides occurs by a set of HIF prolyl hydroxylase isoenzymes (PHD 1-3) which mediates HIF-1a (OH) recognition by pVHL, which, together with a multisubunit ubiquitin ligase complex, tags HIF-1a with polyubiquitin; this allows recognition by the proteasome and subsequent degradation. Under Hypoxic conditions, the absence of the substrate oxygen prevents the hydroxylases from modifying HIFalpha and allows for HIFalpha protein stability and transcriptional activation capability. <br><br>Two chimeric Anti-cd20 monoclonal antibodies where added to B-cells, and the second Antibody showed more HIF-Alpha than the first. There are multiple chimeric anti-CD20 (IDEC-C2B8) monoclonal antibodies that can be used in the making of Rituximab. If scientists avoid using certain anti-CD20 antibodies that have a higher amount of HIF-alpha increase, it is possible that the amount of patients with hypoxia, as a first infusion reaction, might decrease.

USE OF GFP TO ANALYZE PSEUDOMONAS SYRINGAE PV. PHASEOLICOLA 1448A IN PLANT CELLS
Daniel Abraham Blumenthal
Jones College Prep, Chicago, IL, USA

The bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448A (Pph 1448A) contains about 20 different effector proteins which it injects into a host plant cell through a syringe-like structure inserted through the plant cell wall. Pph 1448A is a known cause of halo blight, a bacterial disease that affects beans world-wide. In this project, cloned, individual genes’ encoding effector proteins were obtained from the plant pathogen Pph 1448A and the effect of each of these effectors was identified using transient transformation in Nicotiana benthamiana and N. tabacum. The expression of these effectors in N. benthamiana was identified by cloning the effectors into a host vector with a region coding for the green fluorescent protein (GFP). In some cases, this technique allowed for identification of protein localization within host plant cells. Plants tested have responded with some degree of cell death to 4 of the effectors in Pph 1448A. GFP analysis has identified expression of all effectors in N. benthamiana, which was confirmed through Western-blot analysis. Further, the localization of several effectors has been identified, in host cell’s nuclei, chloroplasts, and plasma membrane.

HIGH INTENSITY FOCUSED ULTRASOUND EFFECT ON SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE AND CANCER
China M. Melton
Poughkeepsie High School, Poughkeepsie, NY, USA

High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) produced by the Sonablate® 500 system has been used as a minimally invasive and effective treatment for localized and recurrent prostate cancer. Saccharomyces cerevisiae (active dry baker’s yeast) is analogous to certain types of ocogenic cells because of similarities in the action of the DNA structure transcription in proliferation of mutated DNA, RNA, and transcriptase. The purpose of this study was to determine how high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) affects Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Four trials conducted using different frequencies (100 kHz, 1 MHz, 10 MHz, and 100 MHz) on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells at a temperature of 36-40 degree Celsius for 1 hour produced varied and unexpected results. The frequency of 1 MHz destroyed the highest percentage of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. The frequencies of 10 MHz and 100 MHz destroyed the least percentage of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. Additional experiments conducted by using different types of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are necessary to confirm these findings.

STUDIES ON THE CELLULAR LOCALIZATION OF THE HIV-1 NEF AND VPU PROTEINS
Tiffany Renee Steele
Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, Baltimore MD, United States

In this project, two proteins of the HIV-1 genome, Nef and Vpu, were selected for study in order to develop experimental strategies for analyzing their effects on a common cellular target, the CD4-receptor on the surface of Helper T-Cells. The experimental approach of this project involves the use of the pEGFP plasmid to express greeen fluorescent Nef and Vpu proteins in the HeLa Cell line by DNA Transfection assay.Expression of the Nef and Vpu proteins were followed by SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and the Western Blot Assay with an antibody aganist GFP,and by Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy. Results for the SDS-Polyacylamide Gel Electrophoresis and the Western Blot Analysis reveal that both the GFP-Vpu and GFP-Nef proteins were expressed in the transfected HeLa Cells. The results from the Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy also reveal that the GFP-Vpu fusion protein was expressed and localized in the Perinuclesr region (Endoplasmic Recticulum) of the cell. The results of the Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy also show that the GFP-Nef fusion protein was expressed, and is believed to be localized in the Periphery (Plasma Membrane) of the Cell. <br><br> In future studies, the Vpu gene will be fused to the Ds-Red protein for Co-Transfection as red fluorescent proteins in the Hela-CD4 cell line, which will also express the GFP-Nef protein.

THE USE OF CAPSAICIN SOLUTION FROM JALAPENO AND HABANERO PEPPERS AS AN ANTIBACTERIAL AGENT AGAINST ESCHERICHIA COLI (E. COLI)
Chad Everette Peters
Mayo High School for Math, Science, and Technology, Darlington, SC, US

Capsaicin, the spicy component of peppers, has been used recently as an antibacterial agent for preventing salmonella in poultry. Moreover, experiments have been done in which capsaicin was added to the diets of baby chicks in order to increase their resistance to Salmonella enteritidis. As a result, it was found that both the low and high levels of capsaicin in the chicks’ diet yielded a higher level of resistance to the salmonella enteritidis without harmfully affecting feed consumption, weight gain, or the taste of the chicken when cooked. <br><br> An experiment was set up to further test these findings using the diluted solutions of jalapeno and habanero peppers against a ‘cousin’ bacteria to the salmonella enteritidis – Escherichia coli (E. coli). Groups of Jalapeno solution, Habanero solution, and a control of distilled water were used in order to test the effectiveness of the capsaicin against the bacteria. <br><br> A student’s t test was used to analyze the results, showing a significant difference being that the diluted jalapeno solution had a larger diameter in destroying the E.coli versus the habanero and control groups. The experiment’s means was found at the 95% level. The P-value of the experiment was < 0.0001, thus showing a significant difference being that the diluted jalapeno solution had a larger diameter in destroying the E.coli versus the habanero and control groups. Therefore, the null hypothesis can be rejected.<br><br>

COMPARTMENTALIZATION OF GENE EXPRESSION IN A SPORULATING COCCUS- SPOROSARCINA UREAE
Mamatha Chetlur Chary
Central High School, Philadelphia PA, USA

Sporulation in bacteria offers a simplified model of cell differentiation. It is a process which certain bacteria use in response to unfavorable environmental conditions such as lack of nutrients or non-optimal temperatures. In these situations, bacteria form spores which are bodies highly resistant to physical and chemical abuse. During sporulation, genes get differentially expressed in separate cell compartments ultimately leading to the formation of a spore. Rod-shaped Bacillus subtilis and coccal-shaped Sporosarcina ureae are typical examples of bacteria which form endospores. The former is characterized by asymmetric division leading to unequal sized cells with the smaller cell forming the spore. The latter divides symmetrically and one of the cells forms the spore. The goal for this investigation was to determine whether S. ureae also exhibits compartment-specific gene expression similar to the asymmetrically dividing species B. subtilis.<br><br> The strategy involved using a multi copy shuttle plasmid in which two reporter genes- cfp (cyan fluorescent protein) under the control of a gene which is expressed only in the smaller compartment, the forespore, and yfp (yellow fluorescent protein) under the control of a gene which is expressed only in the larger compartment the mother cell. This plasmid was constructed in a series of steps and tested in both B. subtilis and S.ureae. Studies with this plasmid reveal that compartment-specific gene expression occurs in S.ureae on similar lines to B. subtilis. The implications of these findings have an important bearing in the understanding of cell differentiation that occurs in higher organisms such as humans. <br><br>

CAN MATING-TYPE SWITCHING IN SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE BE USED TO DETECT DNA DAMAGE? DOES INCREASING TRANSCRIPTION INFLUENCE DNA REPAIR AFTER UV EXPOSURE?
Cristina De Obaldia
Moorestown High School, Moorestown NJ, USA

The purpose of this experiment is to see whether mating-type switching in the yeast S.cerevisiae can be used as an indicator of DNA damage. This method would provide a eukaryotic alternative to the widely used Ames test, which detects whether a chemical is a DNA mutagen in prokaryotic cells. Mating-type switching happens as a result of double strand break in the DNA through the recombination process.<br><br> A UV sensitive yeast strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae G948-1C/U (uracil deficient) alpha mating-type, was exposed to likely DNA damaging agents: UV light and various chemical substances. After exposure, these yeast were mated with S. cerevisiae HB12 strain(adenine deficient)also an alpha mating type. Only the rare G9481C/U yeast that had switched to mating type a after DNA damage could mate with the HB12 strain. Minimal Vitamin Agar (MV) was used to isolate the diploid yeast which could grow on the media due to complementation. The presence of yeast colonies on MV indicates that DNA damage occurred.This alternative process could be used when testing the safety of new medicines for humans.<br><br> Recovery after UV exposure was also studied to test whether nutritional conditions: media type and uracil content, affected the cell recovery and survival after UV exposure. <br><br>Proof of mating-type switching was not accurate due to G948-1C/U’s growth on MV at 0 min UV exposure. The possible cause for this was that the strain reverted back to its wild-type and was able to sustain itself on MV. Different media types did not show significantly different survival rates of the exposed G948-1C/U. The uracil proved to significantly increase yeast recovery and survival after UV exposure.<br><br>

ANCIENT MEDICINE TO MODERN MEDICINE: LICHENS WHAT'S THE POTENTIAL?
Rebecca Renee Alexander
Grants High School; Grants, New Mexico, USA

Last year’s project investigated the antimicrobial properties of lichens found in New Mexico. The initial testing this year on the extracts from last year have shown that the lichen extracts retained some ability to inhibit bacteria.<br><br>Based on data from last year, samples 1, 3, 8, and 9 were selected for further investigation. The purpose of this project is to identify the chemical properties of the lichen extracts with a goal of producing an antibiotic. The hypothesis of this project is that the Fruticose Lichen (sample 8) collected and tested last year will have the chemical properties needed to produce an antibiotic.<br><br>The results of experiments done using the Disc Diffusion Method have shown that sample 8 does have the best over all results. (See graph of averages) Paper chromatography shows that sample 9 may also have the chemical properties needed to produce an antibiotic. (See experiment 11) The results for Electrophoresis were inclusive. In test 13 thru 17, samples 3 and 9 had improved results. The results of Thin Layer Chromatography and High Performance Liquid Chromatography reveal several components in the lichen extracts with #8 having the most separations in both.<br><br>In conclusion, the hypothesis is at least partly correct as sample 8 has shown very positive results. More tests need to be done on the lichen extracts to isolate and identify the chemicals, which are producing the zones of inhibition against the bacteria.<br><br>

EYE AWARE A TWO-YEAR STUDY OF ACANTHAMOEBAS IN EYEWASH STATIONS AND THEIR ENVIRONMENT
Kristin Lynea Fields
Ballard High School, Louisville, KY, USA

Acanthamoebas can cause Acanthamoeba keratitis, an eye disease that requires corneal transplants. The purpose of this research was: 1) To see if acanthamoebas were present in the eye wash stations at local high schools, universities, and industry; 2) To determine the sources and/or origins of acanthamoebas; and 3) to find the best flushing technique to prevent contamination. <br><br>Samples were taken from 80 eyewash stations and then examined for the presence of Acanthamoebas. The control used was an Acanthamoeba culbertsoni smear slide. In addition, real time PCR was performed to confirm the micro-organisms found were Acanthamoebas. Of the 80 samples tested, 15 were found to have Acanthamoebas while 65 were not. <br><br>An eye wash station was taken apart and various parts were tested. Acanthamoebas were only found to be in the heads and the pipe below the bowl. The river and the water company’s finished water were then tested eight times each. 13% of the time the river samples indicated the presence of Acanthamoebas. <br><br>Flushing techniques to prevent contamination were tested using 4 eyewash stations. Flushing for 3-minutes twice a week and 3-minutes once a week prevented the contamination of Acanthamoeba; however, flushing for 3-minutes once a month did not prevent Acanthamoebas.<br><br> <br><br>Contrary to OSHA’s 3-minute monthly flushing mandate, this study indicates that eyewash stations should be flushed at least 3-minutes weekly; therefore, OSHA must review their current mandate and consider revising to at least 3-minutes weekly flushing.<br><br>

A STUDY OF THE ANTI-MICROBIAL EFFECTS OF HONEY ON ESCHERICHIA COLI
Nyssa Catherine Boyd
Eastern High School, Pekin IN, US

It is said that a honeybee hive is one of the cleanest environments in nature. The purpose of this project was to determine if different concentrations of raw honey would inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli. It was hypothesized that if different concentrations of raw honey were used to inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli, then the greatest anti-microbial effect would come from the highest concentration of raw honey. Nine different concentrations of honey were tested for their antimicrobial effect on Escherichia coli by soaking sterile disks in each concentration and placing them on Petri dishes that contained EMB agar and were inoculated with E. coli. The average zones of inhibition were as follows: 686.6mm2 for 100%, 753.4mm2 for 75%, 582.1mm2 for 50%, 457.8mm2 for 25%, 366.8mm2 for 20%, 311.1mm2 for 15%, 121.9mm2 for 10%, and 65.2mm2 for 5%. No inhibition was found with the distilled water. The ranges for each concentration were as follows: 962.1-530.9 for 100%, 934.8-490.9 for 75%, 660.5-510.7 for 50%, 530.9-380.1 for 25%, 397.6-330.1 for 20%, 330.1-298.6 for 15%, 188.7-44.2 for 10%, and 103.9-44.2 for 5%. ANOVA was used to determine statistical significance with a P-value of 0.01. Based on the data collected, the hypothesis was supported.

COLONIZATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF MICROBES IN THE WEIGHT ROOM
Jalissa Jean Hovland
Maddock Public, Maddock, ND, United States

Purpose: The purpose is to swab five different machine surfaces in the weight room and show how much bacterial colonies are found on each of them.<br><br>Procedure: For my procedure I swabbed a 10g/cm2 area for each of my selected surfaces. My surfaces were: the bench press bar, the waist belt, the squat bar, a 10 pound weight on the curl station, and the power clean bar. I then made serial dilutions to 10-6. After making serial dilutions, I took .1 mL of each of the dilutions and made duplicate plates to show the Colony Forming Units. However, after three times of trying this, I found that my colony forming units were too small at those dilutions, therefore I went down to straight swabbing the surface and placing them directly onto the Nutrient Agar Plates. I repeated this every Wednesday for five weeks. <br><br>Conclusion: After observing the bacterial colonies, I found that there were more bacterial colonies than I had predicted. Although serial dilutions are the best thing to do, I found that when I did the serial dilutions there were not enough colony forming units to count. I found out that in the end the ten-pound weight on the curl station had the most colony forming units.<br><br>

IMPROVING SURVIVAL OF BIFIDOBACTERIA IN YOGURT CONTAINING EXOPOLYSACCHARIDES
Kara Renée Gutormson
Maddock Public School, Maddock North Dakota, United States

<br><br><br>The objective of this experiment was to determine if the survival of bifidobacteria in yogurt could be improved by using an exopolysaccharide producing culture. It was hypothesized that the EPS producing culture would act as a protective matrix in the yogurt to improve the growth and survival of bifidobacteria. If the survival of bifidobacteria is greatly enhanced, EPS producing cultures could be used in yogurt to help those who suffer from GI tract illnesses. <br><br>First, all of the necessary cultures were obtained and then propagated. Following propagation, 2 separate batches of yogurt were made. The two strains of Streptococcus thermophilus, 3534 and 5842 (an EPS+ and EPS- strain) were used for the manufacture of yogurt. Batch 1 contained the EPS+ culture, while batch 2 contained the EPS- culture. The initial plate count was conducted 48 hours after the yogurt was inoculated. To conduct plate counts, two types of selective medium were used, ST agar (for enumeration of S. thermophilus) and NNLP media (for enumeration of B. bifidum). When the yogurt was 14 days old, a second plate count was conducted to determine survival of bifidobacteria during storage. <br><br>The initial plate count results showed that batch 1 had an increased amount of bifidobacteria compared to batch 2. After the second plate count was conducted, the survival of bifidobacteria in both batches significantly decreased. In conclusion, the growth of bifidobacteria in yogurt made with an exopolysaccharide producing culture was initially improved, but was only slightly enhanced as the yogurt aged. <br><br>

A RELATIONSHIP OF DEVIATION BETWEEN GROWTH RATE AND MUTATION USING E. COLI TRANSFORMATION: A MEANS OF DISEASE CONTROL
David Len Elion
Mississppi Math and Science School, Columbus MS, USA

In molecular biology, mutation refers to the modification of genetic material by altering the DNA structure and code. Mutations can be positive, which guarantees characteristics favorable to the environment; negative, which includes characteristics unfavorable to the environment (sometimes fatal); and neutral, which has no effect on the organism. Like most bacteria, E. coli experiences a lag phase, stationary phase, and unless a mutation occurs, a death phase. Scientists have discovered that E. coli entering the mutative state can be seen in frantic movement. In conclusions made by scientists Patricia Foster and Jill Layton who conducted 1989 experiments dealing with the transformation of E. coli strain FC40 in obtaining the gene to metabolize lactose, it is observed that E. coli mutates when it is "starved" or without necessities for life. In the experiment "Normal Bacteria Growth Rate vs. The Growth Rate After Mutation", the effects of mutation on the growth rate of bacteria are explored. Using the spectrophotometer, the growth rate of a naturally fermented bacteria culture, E. coli isolated from that culture, the genetically engineered strain mm294 which lacks the gene to metabolize amplicillin, and the newly transformed strain mm294 which accepted the plasmid pAMP to metabolize ampicillin were recorded. Because results from the experiment revealed that the strains of mutated and genetically engineered E. coli had growth rates slower than natural strains, one can conclude that newly acquired phenotypes negatively effect a bacteria's population. The fact that repeatedly mutated bacteria had the slowest growth rate supports this conclusion.

XYLITOL XTREME 2: A TIME SEQUENCING STUDY ASSESSING THE INHIBITORY EFFECT OF PENTAHYDROXYPENTANE (XYLITOL) ON THE BACTERIAL GROWTH CURVE OF STREP. MUTANS.
Justin A. Johns, Christine E. Johns
Evangelical Christian School, Fort Myers, Florida, USA

The researchers’ hypothesis is that the introduction of xylitol into a Streptococcus mutans culture will have the greatest inhibitory affect on the bacteria’s replication when inoculation is done early in the bacterial growth cycle. <br><br> The researchers began by preparing a growth medium of Bacto Brain-Heart Infusion broth placed in 21 125-ml. belico nephelo flasks, a culture of Streptococcus mutans bacteria placed in 50ml of the infusion broth, and an experiment reagent of 25% pentahydroxypentane (xylitol) solution. The broth flasks and bacteria culture mixture were placed in a 5% CO2 incubator for 18 hours. Upon removal the researchers placed 2 ml of a Streptococcus mutans culture in each of the 21 test group flasks and the 1 control flask under a vented biological safety hood. The test flasks were randomly divided into 4 groups (A,B,C,D) of 5 each, with 5ml of xylitol added to each test group’s flasks at 1 hour intervals beginning with group A at hour 0. Every 30 minutes the amount of bacterial growth was measured using a digital spectrophotometer to evaluate turbidity levels.<br><br> All four test groups showed significantly lower bacteria counts than the control group with group B, the one hour inoculation group, showing the greatest level of cell growth suppression at 60.9%, at least 20.0% lower than any of the other three test groups. Statistical analysis (ANOVA) indicates that the data is significant, and that there is a strong correlation between when xylitol is introduced, and its effectiveness for inhibiting Streptococcus mutans cell replication. <br><br>

DECREASING THE MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION OF AN OAK WINE BARREL BY IMPROVING THE SANITATION OF BRETTANOMYCES BRUXELLENSIS USING 254NM ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT AND AN ULTRASONIC BATH
Arnaud Sillis, Keenan Ferar, Brian Siperstein
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland Oregon, USA

Barrel reuse is critical to economic winemaking but the optimum method for sanitation is debatable. Blocks cut from an oak barrel and inoculated with Brettanomyces bruxellensis were sanitized using ultraviolet light B alone, ultrasound alone, or the combination of the two. These were compared to results obtained by treating the blocks with ozone. Core samples were taken from the blocks and divided into a surface layer and three depths; this enabled measurement of the degree of penetration of each sanitation method. Each layer was then dropped into broth and the number of yeast cells after 48 hours of culture was counted using a hemocytometer. UV B performed best at the surface but with little effect at any depth. Ozone was weaker at the surface but removed half the yeast at the first depth. Ultrasound performed well all around, but had less of an effect on the surface than UV B and ozone. A combination of UV B and ultrasound worked best of all (killing 99.99% of surface yeast cells), providing both surface and depth sanitation. Winemakers should consider a combination of ultrasound and UV B for wine barrel sanitation due to its better performance and significantly lower cost than ozone.

AMERICAN INDIAN MEDICINE: AN ANALYSIS OF ANTISEPTIC PLANTS FOR ANTIMICROBIAL EFFECTIVENESS
Shana Marie Wolff, Beth J. Cochran
Cheyenne Central High School, Cheyenne, Wyoming, USA

Living in Cheyenne, Wyoming, Plains American Indian culture is very important to us. The purpose of our experiment was to examine the effectiveness in the laboratory of Plains American Indian plant remedies traditionally used as topical antiseptics to prevent or treat infections of the skin. Our hypothesis is that some of these plants will display significant antimicrobial activity in the laboratory, in vitro.<br><br> In this study we used 30 different medicinal plants that Plains American Indians used as antiseptics that we could find growing in and around Cheyenne, Wyoming. We extracted juices from each of these plants and then filter sterilized each using a 0.22 um Millipore filter to remove contaminating bacteria. The plant extracts were tested against 9 different bacteria and 1 yeast. After incubation, the plates were examined and any zones of bacterial inhibition were observed and measured. These zones of inhibition would indicate antimicrobial activity of the plant extracts, and a possible benefit as a topical antiseptic.<br><br> Results showed that very few plants, only 6.36%, traditionally used by Plains American Indian tribes as antiseptics showed significant antimicrobial activity in the laboratory, and primarily against non-pathogenic Gram positive bacteria. From our research, we conclude the main benefit of using boiled plant extracts as antiseptics came from the physical rinsing and washing away of bacteria from a wound with boiled, clean water. Another benefit of using certain plants on wounds is that the mucilaginous leaves covering the wound acted as a barrier to keep out infection causing bacteria.<br><br>

MODULATION OF QUORUM SENSING IN PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA
Siew Han Wong, Kuan Yee Wong
National Junior College, Republic of Singapore

Pseudomonas aeruginosa utilize quorum sensing (QS), a microbial community genetic regulatory mechanism, to launch unified attacks against organisms by synchronizing the expression of a set of target genes in a cell density-dependent manner. When signal molecules, such as N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs), reach a critical concentration, the expression of the certain genes, including virulence genes are triggered.<br><br>vqsM, an AraC-type transcriptional regulator, is a novel QS modulator that regulates two interrelated QS systems, las and rhl, as well as the expression of at least 302 genes in P. aeruginosa. This project aims to investigate genes responsible for the regulation of vqsM and their roles in the modulation of QS.<br><br>Transposon mutangenesis was first carried out by mating a reporter strain of PA01 (containing a lacZ gene and vqsM promoter) with the transposon strain, E.coli. Mutants showing abnormal coloration were selected and sequences of the disrupted genes ware recovered using Thermal Asymmetric Interlaced PCR and then checked against the NCBI database. <br><br>Six genes were identified, one of which negatively regulates vqsM and the remaining five which are involved in positive regulation. Complementation was performed for two genes by the insertion of the respective genes back into the mutants. Normal blue coloration of the mutant colonies was restored, affirming their regulatory roles of vqsM.<br><br>Although no QS modulation roles were discovered in these genes, findings nevertheless contribute to a better understanding of the QS cascade in P. aeruginosa and hopefully contribute to the reduction of related bacterial infections.<br><br>

B. THURINGIENSIS SPORE DESTRUCTION UTILIZING A FE-TAML, CTAB CATALYZED, TBHP REACTION.
Gabby Stoner, Rana Gibson
San Jon Municipal Schools, San Jon, NM, United States

The events of September 11, 2001, heightened the nation’s awareness and placed a renewed focus on ensuring the protection of the nation’s critical infrastructures. One area of concern is food and water which can be contaminated with bacteria such as B. anthracis (anthrax) and B. thuringiensis (Bt). Bacilli spores are often hard to kill. Current technologies to kill bacilli spores include chlorine dioxide gas (ClO2) and vaporized hydrogen peroxide. While effective, these treatments are often expensive and hard to apply in large scale decontaminations. The purpose of this experiment is to test the effects of Fe-TAML catalyzed, CTAB, and TBHP, H2O2 and UV-C irradiation on the growth of B. thuringiensis. Fe-TAML catalyst, is an activator for peroxides including, TBHP (tert-butyl hydroperoxide) which is known to cause inactivation of enzymes within intact spores leading to their death. CTAB is a quaternary ammonium compound which has the ability to disrupt microbial cellular membranes but is not independently sporicidal.<br><br> B. thuringiensis spores were exposed to UV-C irradiation, Fe-TAML, CTAB + 30%H2O2 and Fe-TAML, CTAB + 3%H2O2 for 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 minute exposures.<br><br>The UV-C irradiation while decreasing the amount of growth did not inhibit all growth even at the 2 minute irradiation period.<br><br>There was no growth of B. thuringiensis exposed to the peroxide treatments at all exposure times. This indicates that the Fe-TAML catalyzed peroxide treatments maybe a viable technology to remediate bacilli spore contaminated sites. Further research should include testing the treatment on actual contaminated facility surfaces. <br><br>

HAMBURGER: HEALTHFUL OR HAZARDOUS WAYS TO DECREASE MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION ON HAMBURGER
Annika Marie Sullivan, Kristen Delwiche
US Grant, Portland, OR, USA

Hamburgers are eaten by millions of Americans each day. However, meats contaminated with pathogenic (disease-causing) bacteria are a cause of foodborne illness. We sought to determine the types and amount of bacteria in hamburger from four different stores and test which of several common household substance (vinegar, soy sauce, sherry or bleach) reduced bacterial counts the most. To determine types and amounts of bacteria, we homogenized 2 grams of meat with 5 mL of PBS (phosphate buffer solution) in a stomacher, and cultured the solution on LB agar, Salmonella / Shigella, Blood, and MacConkey/Lactose media. We counted colonies, and made gram-stains to identify bacteria. To determine if we could trace E. coli or Shigella genes in the hamburger, we extracted DNA from the meat and performed polymerase chain reaction with 10 primers. To reduce bacterial counts, we mixed 1 mL of vinegar, soy sauce, sherry, soap and bleach with 4 mL of PBS, and 2 grams of hamburger and repeated the above methods. We found that all the hamburger had bacterial contamination, and Store A’s hamburger had the highest counts. We identified primarily non-pathogenic E. coli, but also one colony of Salmonella. We were able to identify hamburger DNA on PCR, but not any pathogenic bacteria. Vinegar and bleach were the most effective substances in decreasing bacterial counts. We conclude that no hamburger meat should be eaten with out thorough cooking.

WHAT SHARES YOUR AIR?
Kacie Barnett, David Jacks
Drew Central High School, Monticello, AR, USA

This project was meant to determine whether two schools in the same area have the same amount and types of bacteria in the air vents. We hypothesized that the findings would be similar in both schools. After swabbing various vents and testing for bacteria with the help of hospital staff, we are able to prove our hypothesis.<br><br> After using culturettes to swab each vent, we plated the organisms that were collected on the swabs. We observed the growth the following day. Then we identified the microbes. The results were as expected.<br><br> The majority of the microbes in each school were molds, yeasts, and gram positive rod bacteria. None of these pose a serious health risk to healthy individuals. <br><br> The schools did have similar amounts and quantities of microbes. However, School B did have a bit more. Every plate had growth and the growths were more expansive than those of School A. One plate from School A had no growth. These results allowed us to prove our hypothesis.

THE EFFECT OF ELECTRODE MATERIALS ON THE EFFICIENCY OF A MICROBIAL FUEL CELL
Veronica Leigh Winget, Jessica Hee Park
Gig Harbor High School, Gig Harbor, WA, USA

The purpose of this project was to investigate the amount of power produced by microbial fuel cells with different electrodes. Our idea was to change electrodes in the fuel cell we built, and see which metal produced the most power. Through our experiment, we discovered the correlation between bacterial growth on the anode, and the current production in the microbial fuel cell. We also discovered that silver was the best electrode for a microbial fuel cell.<br><br> <br><br> We hypothesized that aluminum would be the best electrode, since in our early experiments aluminum grew the most bacteria. To test our hypothesis, we built a two-chambered microbial fuel cell, and we manipulated the electrode metal to measure the current production in volts. We observed that the metals that grew the most bacteria would generally produce the most electricity in the microbial fuel cell. We statistically saw that overall silver produced the most electricity. When we went back to do more bacterial growth trials, we also found that silver was the best substrate for bacterial growth. <br><br> <br><br> The results to our experiment disproved our hypothesis that aluminum would produce the most electricity in a microbial fuel cell. Silver produced the most electricity overall, thus making the best electrode in a microbial fuel cell. Many metals that produced high concentrations of bacteria also made efficient electrodes in the microbial fuel cell, but surface area, conductivity, the use of catalysts, the concentration of microbes, and the durability of the electrode also effect power production. <br><br>

Nease High School, St. Augustine FL, St. Johns

Alexander Fleming discovered the first antibiotic, penicillin, in 1928. Since this monumental discovery, the world has been producing and distributing different antibiotics at alarming rates. The bacteria that would normally have negative effects on people are now being eliminated through the use of various antibiotics. Over the course of the last century this process has selected for genes in the bacteria that are resistant to the antibiotics. Essentially the use of antibiotics has killed all of the bacteria susceptible to the medicine but it has allowed those bacteria with natural resistance to the antibiotic to reproduce and become common in today’s world.<br><br> The problem that society faces today is whether or not our use of antibiotics has created bacteria that cannot be killed. The bacteria of today bear the natural resistance to many of the different types of antibiotics. In order to determine if there is a relationship and correlation between socioeconomic status and effectiveness of antibiotics, our project examined the relationship between ethnicity and antibiotic effectiveness. We chose to test the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus because it is common in all races. After using a Kirby-Bauer Antimicrobial Disk Diffusion Susceptibility Test to test for antibiotic effectiveness we applied statistical analysis to attempt and determine if there was a significant relationship between ethnicity and antibiotic effectiveness. We concluded that the antibiotic clindamycin is ineffective for eliminating S. aureus in Hispanics and the antibiotic oxacillin is ineffective at eliminating S. aureus in African Americans. As only two of the tested data sets could provide a relationship it appears as if antibiotic effectiveness transcends race.<br><br> <br><br>

EFFECTS OF STREAM HYDRODYNAMICS AND WATER FILTRATION PLANT DISCHARGES ON THE COLONIZATION, DIVERSITY AND BIOMASS OF AQUATIC FUNGI AT RIO SABANA, LUQUILLO, PUERTO RICO
Zacha M. Ortiz-Correa, Esteban Hernandez, Sylvanna Savona
Casiano Cepeda High School, Comunidad La Dolores, Río Grande, PUERTO RICO

Fungi are traditionally considered to be dominant in organic matter cycling in terrestrial environments, while bacteria correspondingly are superior in aquatic areas. However, fungi are commonly found in marine and freshwater systems, and their importance in nutrient cycling may be higher than expected (Coffin, et.al., 1990). Presence of fungi in natural waters raise interesting questions such as if occurrence of fungi in water is unintended (transport into the water due to wind and rain), do aquatic fungi form hyphae like terrestrial species and if yes, how is this related to streams hydrodynamics.<br><br> The present investigation intends to study the influence of stream hydrodynamics (i.e. flow velocity, depth, etc.) and anthropogenic disturbances (water filtration plant discharges) in the aquatic fungal diversity and biomass on artificial and natural substrates.<br><br> A traditional before and after design was conducted to study the diversity and biomass during 28 days, of fungi colonyzing leaves discs at Río Sabana in Luquillo, Puerto Rico.<br><br> Species were identified after inducing sporulation in the lab, aliquots filtered and conidia stained with cotton blue in lactophenol. Biomass was determined through the ergosterol content. Ergosterol was determined using spectrophotometric methods after extraction by saponification of extractible lipids.<br><br> The results demonstrated a biomass increase with time at all stations, but lower at stations after the discharges. Fungi diversity was also affected, when aproximately 30% of the species found before the discharge were lost (not found) after the discharge.<br><br> Further research is needed to analyze how far down the river the discharge still impacts the diversity of aquatic fungi.

LEGIONELLA MONITORING OF INDUSTRIAL WATER SYSTEMS BY PCR; A NOVEL MUST IN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF INDUSTRIALISATION WORLDWIDE
Ahmet Faruk Kavak, Omer Faruk Yuca
Private Faith Science High School, Istanbul, TURKEY

Industrialisation brings new problems and emerging infectious diseases; one of them is Legionnaire's Disease. Our project mostly aims the sustainable development of industrialisation without further breaking the health integrity in especially developed countries. Spreading of Legionnaire’s Disease is easier with new water distribution systems and cooling towers of large industrial facilities to more people working and living nearby. Infectious diseases’ control of spreading or monitoring should be very easily done in especially developed or developing, industrialized and most important touristic countries. We have chosen Legionnaire’s disease monitoring in water systems of Turkey as a pilot work for improvement of health in our country using newly emerging technologies and introducing them to the government and different industries and facilities where there is the high risk of exposure to Legionella infectious agent. <br><br>Legionella is a common pathogenic colonizer of water distribution systems and cooling towers leading to severe health risks and considerable legal and/or economic damage to businesses. Large facilities (i.e. hospitals, hotels, industrial plants, etc.) are especially susceptible to legionella colonization within water distribution systems. Outbreaks of Legionnaire's Disease are highly unpredictable, and have fatality rates of up to 30%. We aim to focus the importance of this infectious disease’s environmental surveillence with a new PCR approach, to detect the infectious agent and to make aware our government with the ease of establishment of such a method in environmental surveillance.<br><br>

MULTI-FACTOR OPTIMIZATION OF GENE EXPRESSION IN SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE
Krystina Rose Daniels, Adeline Wong
Milpitas High School, Milpitas; Homestead High School, Cupertino, California,USA

The goal was to determine optimal conditions for the induction of native soluble Ste7 and Kss1, proteins involved in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae pheromone pathway. Factors identified as likely to improve solubility were IPTG induction level, induction temperature, ethanol, and NaCl. Orthogonal arrays were used to design the experiments so that all four factors could be varied simultaneously. A statistical method was used to find a robust, high-output combination of levels of factors.<br><br><br> The initial conditions were 1 mM IPTG at 30ºC, without ethanol or NaCl. We predicted that decreasing the induction temperature and IPTG level, and adding ethanol and NaCl would increase the expression of soluble protein. This hypothesis was tested by inducing E. coli under the sets of conditions dictated by an orthogonal array. The amount of protein produced was quantified via spectrophometry of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and Western blotting membranes. The best conditions for Ste7 were 0.1 to 0.5 mM IPTG at 25ºC, without ethanol or NaCl. Analysis of variance showed that 70.5% of the increase in soluble protein resulted from changing the IPTG level and 9.6% from induction temperature. Ethanol and NaCl was ineffective at increasing solubility. Bradford protein assays showed that purification of a 100-mL culture increased by 240% when conducted at 0.1 mM and 30ºC. Kss1 was difficult to express, but after changing to ER2256 strain, a small amount of Kss1 was detected. Additional testing should be done to refine levels of factors to better understand signal transmission and amplification by cells.<br><br>

FISH MUCUS: ANTIBACTERIAL PROPERTY UNIQUE TO THE HAWAIIAN ELEOTRIS SANDWICENSIS
Genevieve C. Pang, Alayna R. Betsill
Henry Perrine Baldwin High School, Wailuku, Hawaii, USA

This experiment evaluated antibacterial properties of epidermal mucus from the amphidromous fish, Eleotris sandwicensis, and three non-native species in the same freshwater environment. We predicted antibacterial activity common to E. sandwicensis, Tilapia, Guppy, and Molly, but found antibiotic effects only in samples from E. sandwicensis. Antibacterial action attributable to mucus itself was compared between species by pretreating Clostridium perfringens growth medium with mucus from four species of fish. Noticeably diminished C. perfringens growth was only observed over E. sandwicensis mucus compared to untreated control areas and those with mucus from the other fish. The pH of mucus from E. sandwicensis (6.6±0.2) was statistically lower than in the Tilapia (7.0±0.24), Guppy (7.6±0.28), and Molly (7.0±0.25), p<0.05, but like Tilapia, was not significantly different from the pH of pond water (6.8±0.20), p>0.05. In Eleotrid mucus, we found a total of five antibiotic/inhibitory bacteria, with three identified to date by DNA sequencing. All grew on both Nutrient (pH=6.0) and Marine (pH=7.6) Agar leading to the conclusion that pH may contribute to, but cannot explain the lack of antibacterial flora on the other fish. Finding Bacillus subtilis as one of the antibacterials was interesting. This organism is non-pathogenic, antibiotic, and grows under a wide range of pH and salinity. This suggests potential application as an in vivo treatment for diseased marine or freshwater fish. Eleotris sandwicensis’ antibacterial mucus, pH, and intriguing array of resident bacteria imply a mutually-adapted and possibly beneficial relationship, emphasizing uniqueness of this endemic Hawaiian fish in its native habitat. <br><br>

THE EFFECT OF THE GREEN TEA POLYPHENOL, EGCG, ON T CELL-ANTIGEN PRESENTING CELL INTERACTIONS
Iddoshe Hirpa, Yi Cai
duPont Manual High School, Louisville, Kentucky, United States of America

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by decreased nerve function due to myelin loss and secondary axonal damage in the central nervous system (CNS). The presentation of myelin components as antigen is a major factor in the development of MS as is the CD40 receptor-CD154 ligand interaction. Current medications for treating MS are often only modestly efficacious and some have significant toxicity. It has been shown that mice fed with green tea polyphenols (GrTP) in their diet can be protected from the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which is a mouse model of human MS. <br><br> In this study, murine macrophages (100,000/well) were stimulated with CD154-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-CD154) to investigate the effect of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a major component of GrTP, on macrophage inflammatory responses. EGCG inhibited interleukin-12 (IL-12) and IL-6 production from macrophages stimulated through CD40 by interaction with CHO-CD154 cells, but did not decrease CD40 cell surface expression, as analyzed by flow cytometry. The impact of EGCG on macrophage and dendritic cell (DC) antigen presentation capability using ovalbumin and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide, a component of myelin, as antigens was also evaluated. The EGCG significantly reduced the ability of antigen-presenting macrophages and DCs to induce T cell interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production. IFN-gamma upregulated the overall immune response and induced macrophages and DCs to produce inflammatory proteins. In summary, our results suggest that EGCG can affect several pathways that regulate inflammatory responses. Therefore, EGCG may prove useful for MS treatment.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF UVB AND UVC LIGHT ON BACTERIAL STERILIZATION
Rebecca Anne Powell
Trinity Catholic High School, Ocala, Fl, USA

This study explored the sterilization response of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria when exposed to various doses of ultraviolet B (315-280nm) and ultraviolet C (<280nm) light. Seven species of bacteria (two Gram positive and five Gram negative) were propagated and diluted in nutrient broth solutions, and then distributed on nutrient agar Petri plates. The organisms were then exposed to either UVB or UVC light for increasing periods of time. The exposed plates were then incubated at 37°C for 24-48 hours until colonies were visible and easily counted. Colony counts were then tabulated and rendered in graphical form. The results showed that UVC light was a very rapid and effective sterilization agent when used on common strains of pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria. Several organisms also demonstrated susceptibility to UVB light but after much longer exposure intervals. A review of the data showed the Serratia liquifaciens may make a useful biological model for studying the photo protective abilities of various physical and chemical UVL barriers.

TURMERIC: A NATURAL ANTIBIOTIC?
Pranali Hemant Dalvi
Bartow International Baccalaureate School - Bartow, Florida in United States

Turmeric, besides adding zest or flavor, has more substantial uses. The aim of this project was to ascertain if turmeric, the powdered rhizome of a tropical plant of India, has antimicrobial properties. Boneless chicken, chicken with bone, lamb, ground turkey, and pork loin were acquired, placed in sterilized containers, and distinguished with labels. Under the Laminar Airflow Microbiology Hood, a sterilized swab scooped a meat piece and placed it on a Chocolate agar plate labeled with the variable and specimen name. Using a sterilized inoculating loop and the streaking procedure, the meat piece was spread onto each quadrant of the agar plate. An identical procedure was performed for the MacConkey and Blood agar plates and for each of the remaining four specimens. The fifteen agar plates were sealed and incubated for seventy-two hours at 37 degrees Celsius in 5-10% CO2. The procedure performed under the Laminar Airflow was repeated after applying turmeric onto each specimen. Gram's stain was used to differentiate between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Observations, analysis, and data collection followed experimentation. One-hundred percent of the specimen had less bacterial growth (measured in colony forming units) after turmeric addition than before. The average reduction in bacterial colonies was forty-five percent. The quantity of bacterial species for each specimen plummeted. After turmeric addition, each specimen's bacterial growth rating lessened by at least one rating. On the whole, turmeric has antimicrobial properties. This project could be furthered by determining a concentration of turmeric that is most effective in inhibiting bacterial growth.

FRACTAL BACTERIA COLONIES: SELF-SIMILAR AGGREGATION UNDER STARVATION CONDITIONS
Kristina Lynn Buschur
Carroll High School, Dayton, Ohio, United States of America

The purpose of this research was to investigate how varying levels of starvation affect the growth and colony formation of B. subtilis, E. aerogenes, and E. coli. It was hypothesized that as the degree of starvation increased, the complexity of the colony, measured by the fractal dimension, would increase as well, although the colonies grown on agar with no bacto peptone would exhibit little or no growth. B. subtilis, E. aerogenes, and E. coli were each grown on six types of agar with concentrations of bacto peptone that varied from 0 g/L up to 5 g/L. The diameters of the colonies produced were measured daily and at the end of the incubation period the fractal dimension of each colony was calculated. In general, all the bacteria grown on 3 g/L, 4 g/L, and 5 g/L bacto peptone produced intricate colonies, with complex borders and fractal properties. The 0 g/L agar produced little or no growth, but the 2 g/L bacto peptone agar showed huge, very thin growth in all three types of bacteria. It was determined that this concentration was the optimal level for chemotaxis, and that the starvation stimulus did lead to complex fractal colony shapes in most of the treatments.

MEDICINE FROM THE SEA

There is a growing need for novel antibiotics as microbes are increasingly becoming resistant to the current ones in use. Many of these new antibiotics are have been found in deep-sea sponges, corals, and tunicates. The purpose of this project is to find bacteria with unique antimicrobial chemistry from deep and shallow water sponges and tunicates that will fight either Candida albicans and/or Staphylococcus aureus.<br><br> To determine this, a shallow water sponge and a tunicate were collected. Each sample was ground up and diluted ten-fold. Next, each diluted suspension was plated on both a marine broth and oligotrophic media, to see which one produced more colonies/diversity. After the colonies had grown, the different colonies were aseptically picked and a t-streak was performed to ensure there was a single isolate added to the plate. The individual colonies were grown in a liquid culture and tested for activity at two, four, and seven-day intervals. Disc diffusion assays, which show a zone of inhibition around a colony that is producing an antibiotic, were used to determine the activity. The compounds were extracted from the active bacteria.<br><br> Two active bacteria were found from the deep-water sponges, an alpha proteobacterium and a Bacillus species. Both were active against Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus. The bacteria were found to be active in all four repetitions and in some cases were actually more effective than the controls that were used. No compounds were successfully extracted from the two active bacteria due time constraint. As a continuation to this project, the compound that is active could be identified.<br><br>

A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF VARIOUS FORMS OF ALLIUM SATIVUM AND ANTIBIOTICS ON BACTERIA
Rebekah Anne Meller
Pettisville Local School, Pettisville, Ohio, USA

The public uses many forms of Allium sativum (garlic), but some may be ineffective. The problem was to compare the effectiveness of fresh, cooked and supplemental garlic in inhibiting Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, to determine if any of these forms of garlic were as effective as ampicillin and erythromycin, and to determine if a synergistic effect would be exhibited. The hypothesis was fresh garlic would be more effective than cooked or supplemental garlic. Fresh garlic would be more effective than both antibiotics and there would be a synergistic effect with fresh garlic and both antibiotics on both bacteria. Cooked and supplemental garlic would not have a significant synergistic effect. Plates were divided into quadrants. Half of the plates were inoculated with Escherichia coli, and the other half with Bacillus subtilis. In each quadrant sterile disks soaked with distilled water; fresh, cooked, or supplemental garlic; ampicillin; erythromycin; and ampicillin or erythromycin disks soaked with a form of garlic were placed. Each quadrant represented one trial with eighteen trials conducted. Averages were compared and t tests calculated to analyze results. During the first 24 hours the fresh garlic had a greater affect on E. coli and B. subtilis than cooked or supplemental garlic, and it inhibited both types of bacteria more than either antibiotic. On B. subtilis there was a synergistic effect with fresh, cooked and supplemental garlic with both antibiotics. On E. coli there was a synergistic effect with fresh garlic with ampicillin, and cooked garlic with both antibiotics.

A COMBAT AGAINST CAVITY CAUSING BACTERIA: RAISINS AS A FUNCTIONAL FOOD FOR ORAL HEALTH
Leslie Ann Hase
Merino Jr-Sr High School, Merino, CO, US

Five chemical compounds that are found in raisins, oleanolic acid, oleanolic aldehyde, betulin, betulinic acid, and 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-furfural, are thought to help decrease the risk of tooth decay in children. The purpose of the research is to investigate using the five compounds to stop the growth of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Staphylococcus epidermis, and Escherichia coli. <br><br>The researcher created slurry dilutions of the raisins and onions and then introduced the bacteria into slurries and plated them on the appropriate agar plate. The growth of the bacteria was observed and the colonies were counted using a colony counter. The hypothesis of the research is that these compounds found in raisins will effectively kill the Streptococcus mutans. This would indicate it would be effective against tooth decay and could be used in tooth pastes and wipes for babies’ teeth. The researcher believes that the raisin slurry will also be effective against Streptococcus salivarius, Staphylococcus epidermis, and Escherichia coli, but it will not be as effective. <br><br>In the two trials completed I conclude that the raisins did slow the growth of the Streptococcus mutans. The two raisin trials with the Streptococcus mutans at the most had 704 colonies. For the onion dilutions with the Streptococcus mutans there were 2355 colonies present on one plate. Also, with the Streptococcus mutans, the 100% dilution had 283 colonies while the 20% dilution had 408 colonies. I could not conclude that the onion showed effectiveness against the Streptococcus mutans. The raisins also appeared to slow the growth of the Streptococcus salivarius, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli when compared to the onion. More trials are being conducted.

MALTOSE UTILIZATION OF ESCHERICHIA COLI K12
Ganga S. Moorthy
Alva High School, Alva, Oklahoma, USA

The maltodextrin system of Escherichia coli consists of five genes (LamB, malF, malE, malG, and malK) which encode the ATP-binding cassette controlled by malT. The purpose of this research project was to measure growth rates of wild type strains of Escherichia coli K12 in comparison to the growth rates of Escherichia coli K12 with malEFG mutations. The working hypothesis was that the wild type strain of Escherichia coli K12 would have a higher growth rate than the mutant strain, malEFG due to the deletion of the malEFG genes in the mutant strain. Both were monitored on three separate occasions for twelve hours using a spectrophotometer. Least regression equations and lines where found for each trial and for the average.. A one tailed t-test conducted comparing the optical densities of the MG 1655 wild type and malEFG MG found a value which fell about the critical value thus; the working hypothesis was accepted with a 95% level of confidence. This shows that malEFG is critical to maltose uptake, however it is possible that other genes may be able to code for maltose uptake.

ADAPTATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF BACTERIAL RESISTANCE TO DISINFECTANTS A STUDY OF RND EFFLUX PUMPS WITH SINGLE POINT MUTATION TARGETING VAL-610 (YHIV)
Marietta Grace Young
Farmington High School, Farmington, NM, USA

<br><br>Five families of bacterial efflux systems have been identified as being a key factor in bacterial resistance. In E. coli, twelve resistance nodulation division (RND) pumps can be found, including YhiV. These pumps are used to expel chemical compounds from the bacteria. Fluoroquinolones (Poole 2000a,b) have found some resistance at the active efflux of the cell. The same multidrug efflux systemic pumps have been identified not only for antibiotic substrates but Triclosan as well (Kohler et al., 2001: Poole, 2001). <br><br> This two part study was to determine if first, bacteria could become resistant to diluted disinfectants, and secondly, if genetic mutations would take place. This research was based on other studies linking bacterial resistance to E. coli RND-type efflux pumps and Val-610 (YhiV). <br><br>It was hypothesized that bacterial resistance would occur. The results of this experiment showed there were some bacterial colonies that were resistant to the disinfectants. Of the three molecular studies performed, the third trial gave the best results because it had cleaner DNA bands with a base pair size approximate to three hundred. However, after receiving the results from the DNA sequencing, it was apparent that something had gone wrong. The chromatographs were undistinguishable, meaning that the results were too close together for a positive reading to be found. A thought of why this happened is that the DNA was contaminated or there were abnormal amounts of DNA. According to the results gained by using the Kirby Bauer Method, it is still believed that a mutation took place.<br><br> <br><br>

DO HERBAL REMEDIES KILL STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS, ESCHERICHIA COLI, AND PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA?
Phillip Alan Lichlyter
Orange Park High, Orange Park, FL, United States

The purpose of this experiment is to determine if traditional herbal remedies kill commonly found infectious bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The herbs in capsules (dandelion, cat’s claw, and garlic) were taken out and mixed with 2.5 mL of sterile water in sterile petri dishes. Several drops of echinacea extract and oregano oil were placed in sterile petri dishes. 3.0 g of parsley were mixed with 2.0 mL of water and combined in a tissue grinder to produce a green liquid that was poured into a sterile petri dish. 2.5 mL of sterile water (a control) was poured into a sterile petri dish. Nine 6 mm diameter filter paper disks were soaked in each herb and the water (Cefoxitin, another control, was already on a disk). Procedures continued according to the Disk Diffusion Susceptibility Test. The zone of inhibition was measured in millimeters and recorded. Dandelion, echinacea, parsley, cat’s claw, and water had average zones of 6 mm for each bacterium. Oregano oil had zones of 8-9 mm for each bacterium. Cefoxitin had zones of 26-28 for S. aureus and E. coli and 6 mm zones for P. aeruginosa. Garlic had zones of 20-25 mm for S. aureus, 14-16 mm for E. coli, and 6 mm for P. aeruginosa. This data did not support the hypothesis that the herbs would show antimicrobial activity. The garlic showed broad spectrum inhibition and the oregano oil would need more testing as it was the only one to kill P. aeruginosa.

THE PATHOLOGICAL EFFECT OF BACTERIA ON MUSCLE TISSUE
Laurie Marie Agosto, The Pathological Effect of Bacteria on Muscle Tissue
The Villages High School, The Villages, Florida

<br><br>Muscle infections, which include the "flesh-eating disease" necrotizing fasciitis are caused by bacteria that inhabit and destroy the tissue, leading to illness and death. These infections can be devastating to hospitalized patients and are associated with high mortality and amputation rates. This project investigates bacteria-induced changes in the structure of muscle over time. For 5 days, muscle sections from chicken meat were sectioned and inoculated with bacteria to observe their decomposition. Additionally, the bacteria was swabbed over the surface of the muscle tissue, and injected with the bacteria to enhance the decomposition. Microscopic photographs were taken through the medical microscope to see the damage more clearly. It was hypothesized that the bacteria would decompose the muscle over time, with decomposition correlating with the expiration date of the meat and paralleling with bacterial growth.<br><br>The muscle was considerably degraded by the growth of bacteria. Bacteria eventually colonized the muscle cells causing widespread necrosis and tissue destruction that resembled necrotizing fasciitis. The growth of these organisms was facilitated by several specific invasions and exotoxins, which were identified through research. These results supported the hypothesis.<br><br>

CIRCUMVENTING ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE
Aaron Christopher Enten
American Heritage School, Plantation Florida, United States

This experiment was designed to circumvent antibiotic resistance in E. coli. Research showed that water, a polarized molecule, could be magnetized with a 3000 gauss strength magnet. Historically, magnetized water has been used to treat illnesses and bacterial infection. The north pole of the magnet also had deadly effects on bacteria. It was deduced that Ampicillin, an aqueous, polarized molecule, could also be magnetized. Therefore the hypothesis stated that if Ampicillin resistant strains of E. coli were treated with magnetized Ampicillin, then the colonies of E. coli would die off.<br><br>The poles of six 3000 gauss strength magnets were determined by using a compass. The first magnet was used to magnetize a vial of ampicillin reducing the bonding angles of the molecule. Once reduced, the shape of the molecule is contorted and the enzyme, beta-lactamase, no longer has the capability of breaking down the ampicillin. Twelve cell suspensions were set up and four were treated with the magnetized ampicillin; six were set on top of a magnet placing the suspensions in a magnetic field. Each of the suspensions were allowed to grow for 24 hours in their pre-made environment, and then each were plated on both ampicillin positive and ampicillin negative plates. Growth was recorded in either number of colonies present or on a predetermined scale for growth density. The evidence from the test shows that a magnetic field alone does not have a large affect on growth, but when combined with magnetized ampicillin the bacterial growth was observably impaired.<br><br>

A NOVEL NON-PHARMACEUTICAL THERAPEUTIC AGENT FOR CUTANEOUS INFECTIONS: AN IN VITRO STUDY OF DE- RMATOPATHOGENIC STAPHYLOCOCCUS, STREPTOCOCCUS, PROPIONIBACTERIUM, & PSEUDOMONAS
Jeremy Chenghow Hsiang
Niceville High School, Niceville, Florida, United States

The purpose of this experiment was to study the bactericidal effect of shampoo against six different bacteria commonly associated with cutaneous infections. The first part involved testing bacteria inhibition by Head & Shoulders, Healthy Sexy, and Dove shampoos using Kirby-Bauer Diffusion Assay. Head & Shoulders, the only shampoo tested containing 1% zinc pyrithione, showed the most effective bacteria inhibitory activity against all bacteria tested – Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Healthy Sexy and Dove shampoos showed much less bacteria inhibition due to the presence of two weaker bactericidal compounds, methylisothiazolinone & Methylchloroisothiazolinone. The second part involved detecting the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each shampoo following serial dilutions. The MIC of Head & Shoulders against MRSA was 1:729 dilutions, whereas the MIC of both Dove and Healthy Sexy was only 1:27. Likewise, Head & Shoulders was superior against other Gram-positive bacteria tested. However, no significant difference was observed on the inhibition of Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The third part involved testing the interaction between shampoos and four antibiotics commonly used for skin infections – ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime, and vancomycin. Although no synergistic bacteria inhibition against MRSA was shown between Head & Shoulders and antibiotics, additive, antagonistic, and indifferent interactions were all observed.<br><br> In conclusion, commercially manufactured shampoo can be used as an effective alternative to inhibit dermatopathogenic bacteria. It can be used as a non-pharmaceutical therapeutic agent for common cutaneous infections in a state of emergency, when no traditional antibiotics or first aid is readily available.

ENHANCING THE HUMAN IMMUNE RESPONSE AGAINST PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA: COMBATING BACTERIAL DEFENSE MECHANISMS BY DISRUPTING QUORUM-SENSING WITH NATURAL AGENTS
Maryam Khadijah Mohammed
Niceville Senior High School, Niceville, FL, USA

P. aeruginosa, the leading cause of nosocomial infections and the second leading cause of nosocomial pneumonia, is responsible for over 50% of cystic fibrosis, AIDS, and cancer mortalities. This problem is further complicated by the emergence of multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa (MDRPA), the gram -ve counterpart of MRSA. Its hardiness is due to the defense enzymes it secretes and its quorum-sensing capability. Quorum-sensing is a bacterial cell-to-cell communications system which senses relative cell density and population strength before coordinating the secretion of enzymes and toxins in large quantities. This overwhelms the host immune system and renders antibiotics ineffective. Disruption of quorum-sensing to block defense enzymes would therefore be an effective method of combating P. aeruginosa infections. <br><br> Two natural agents, white vinegar and Citrus latifolia, were tested for P. aeruginosa growth inhibition, catalase blockage, and quorum-sensing disruption. Standard methods were used to determine the MIC and MBC. Innovative yet simple techniques were developed to assess quorum-sensing disruption and catalase blockage quantitatively. <br><br> The results of this investigation were truly outstanding: 1) white vinegar inhibited P. aeruginosa growth, 2) both natural agents decreased catalase A and B secretion by 66.24%, 3) white vinegar decreased the pre-secreted catalase A activity by 68.7% and citrus latifolia decreased it by 90.13%, and 4) both natural agents effectively disrupted quorum sensing, p. aeruginosa’s most potent arsenal, by requiring an overwhelming increase in the cell density necessary for catalase secretion (white vinegar requiring 700.2% more cells and Citrus latifolia requiring 16,604.6% more cells). It is evident from the results that both natural agents have an outstanding potential to be effective treatments for the prevention and inhibition of fatal P. aeruginosa infections.<br><br>

HYPERMOTILITY IN ESCHERICHIA COLI: A NEW REGULATORY MECHANISM CHARACTERIZED
Erin May Turingan
Eau Gallie High School, Melbourne, FL, United States of America

The goal of this study is to determine if Escherichia coli cells lacking the gene, mioC (mioC-) secrete signal molecules that induce hypermotility in mioC+ cells, and if mioC+ cells secrete signal molecules that suppress motility in this the hypermotile mioC- strain.<br><br> Two strains of Escherichia coli (mioC- and mioC+) were cultured in Luria-Bertani broth and centrifuged to obtain cell secretions and then mixed with soft agar to form the substances for incubation of experimental cells. A bio-assay of the media was conducted. Mutant strain (mioC-) was grown in wild-type media (mioC+ secretions) and wild-type strain (mioC+) was grown in mutant media (mio- secretions). Both strains were also incubated in a control (agar only) media to serve as a reference for the quantification of the reaction of both strains of Escherichia coli to different culture of media. After twenty-four hours of incubation, the growth of the cells from the point of origin was measured. A scanning electron microscope was used to observe physical differences between strains in control and experimental media.<br><br> t-Tests showed that wild-type cells were significantly affected by the mutant media, with some bacteria becoming hypermotile. Also, results suggest that the mutant strain had suppressed motility.<br><br> Results of this study may have profound implications for the field of medical research. The motility of bacterial cells plays a significant role in their pathogenic performance. Medical research that demonstrates the ability of bacterial cells to secrete suppressor molecules may lead to a breakthrough in the field of medicine<br><br>

DEVELOPING ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE IN ESCHERICHIA COLI
Rohit Thummalapalli
American Heritage School, Plantation, FL USA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether Escherichia coli has the ability to mutate into an antibiotic resistant form, and if so, how quickly and effectively these mutations could take place. My hypothesis was that if strains of E. coli are exposed to the dilutions of the antibiotic ampicillin, it would take approximately five weeks to achieve full antibiotic resistance. <br><br> The experimental design was that during Week 1, a control zone size was calculated as the E. coli was swabbed onto Petri dishes containing ampicillin disks. During subsequent weeks, the bacterial strains were then incorporated with a specific amount of ampicillin dilution and growth agar, and each week, these bacterial suspensions would be swabbed onto Petri dishes containing the ampicillin disks. The hypothesis was, as the weeks progress, the average zone of inhibition would steadily decrease, signifying the rise of mutant, resistant E. coli.<br><br> The results of this experiment support the hypothesis, and the trends that were observed indicated that most of the strains achieved ampicillin resistance in four weeks. For Week 1, the average zone size of inhibition was approximately 22 mm, for Week 2, it was 19 mm, Week 3 was 17 mm, and finally, an average of 12 mm in Week 4, signifying that the strains became resistant (13 mm classifies a bacterial strain as resistant). This experiment proves that E. coli has the ability to quickly mutate into a resistant form, so, careful attention must be paid to antibiotic overuse and subsequent contamination. <br><br>

INHIBITING THE GROWTH OF STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS WITH ELDERBERRY EXTRACT
Jing Hua Chen
Benson Polytechnic High School, Portland, Oregon, USA

Elderberries are used for a variety of health issues such as flu symptoms, colds, and fevers. They are a decorative shrub that many people in the Northwest have in their yard. People use the blue elderberries to make tasty jams, but avoid the red berries because they make humans sick. My research focuses on the red elderberries. I separated out ingredients in the stems, leaves, and berries of the plant by extracting methanol-soluble components and filtering the solids out. <br><br> They were tested on Staphylococcus aureus, E. Coli, and Pythium. This procedure was done within a Class II Biological Fume Hood. Extracts from the red berries inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, a gram-positive bacteria that cause infections in health care facilities. Further fractional separation using a silica gel column and thin layer chromatography indicated that subfractions are also effective in inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus. I attempted to purify the effective subfractions and analyzed the ultraviolet (UV) absorption of my samples using a high-pressure liquid chromatograph (HPLC). More bacterial testing indicated that certain peaks in the graphs of each subfraction are more effective in inhibiting bacterial growth. My discovery is significant because Staphylococcus aureus has traditionally been treated with antibiotics, but the overuse of antibiotics is causing the bacteria to become resistant. Therefore, my research can provide a potential alternative treatment.

CECROPINS AS AN ANTITUMOR AGENT
Charles John Hansen
Northwestern High School, Kokomo, IN, US

The purposes are 1) to determine whether purified protein with cecropins is effective in inhibiting the growth of the bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and 2) to determine whether cecropins are effective in killing tumors induced by Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Low molecular mass protein was purified from Hyalophora cecropia haemolymph via protein precipitation with 3.5M ammonium sulfate. In Phase 1, two concentrations of bacterial suspension, 0.1mL and 0.01mL, were used with 0.1mL of protein suspension and both were placed in nutrient broth, which was checked with a DR 2000 spectrophotometer (wavelength 600 nm) after 0, 24, and 48 hrs to determine bacterial growth. After 24 hours, the 0.1mL concentration had an average transmittance of light through the broth of 94.46%, which was not significant vs. the bacteria control of 94.64% (t24hr=0.28<t0.05=2.132). After 48 hr, the average transmittance of light was 86%, which was significant vs. the bacteria control of 82.40% (t48hr=2.20>t0.05=2.132). Three of five test tubes had an average transmittance of 88.40% which was even more significant (t48hr=6.36>t0.05=2.132). This higher transmittance suggests that either 1) the protein effectively kills bacteria (but the concentration used was not large enough to overcome the growth of all bacteria) or 2) the protein has bacteriostatic characteristics. In the second phase, A. tumefaciens was inoculated onto green bean plant stems and carrot calluses. At this time, galls have not yet appeared, so the in vivo second phase of the experiment is incomplete. In conclusion the purified protein holds promise as a possible in vitro bacteriostatic or bacteriocidal substance.

DON'T TOUCH THAT, WAS YOUR MOTHER RIGHT
Rachael Nicole Wood
Kilgore High School, Kilgore TX, United States

The purpose of this investigation is to determine if various commercial restroom surfaces are contaminated with bacteria. Is there a difference in the amount of bacterial growth in commercial restrooms compared to your home? Are any identified bacterial species harmful to the average human? Procedures included obtaining samples from designated surfaces in commercial and home restrooms which were then plated on sterile growth media in petri dishes, incubated and observed. Gross visual inspection to quantify the amount and types of bacterial growth was performed. The more commonly appearing bacterial growths were sampled to obtain an isolate culture which was gram stained following incubation and the results recorded. Both gram negative and positive bacteria were identified with gram staining. An identification process was run on four gram negative and four gram positive isolates with results recorded and evaluated for pathogenesis. There was a significant growth of bacteria from most surfaces that were sampled. There was not a significant difference in bacterial growth between fast food or department store restrooms. All of the restrooms sampled were in high traffic areas. The home surfaces also were contaminated but to a lesser degree. Multiple bacterial species were identified from the isolates and pathogenic potential is present. Unless there is a significant break in the skin, a healthy person is unlikely to be harmed. If a person is immunocompromised or suffering from a major illness and therefore more susceptible to transmission, greater care should be taken.

CORRELATION OF SINGLE AND MULTIPLE SPECIES BIOFILMS AND ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE
Haleigh Jo White
Mid-Buchanan R-5 Faucett Missouri United States

Biofilms are populations of microorganisms adherent to each other and/or to wetted surfaces (such as catheters and pacemakers). During biofilm formation, cells undergo developmental changes,one of which is increased antibiotic resistance. This project was divided into two parts. Part I: The purpose was to determine if multi species biofilm cultures demonstrated a significant increase in antibiotic resistance compared to single species biofilms. Enterococcus faecalis and Enterobacter aerogenes were used as single species representatives and then combined for testing of multiple species. Ampicillin and Streptomycin antibiotic disks were used during testing. In all cases, zones of inhibition for biofilm cultures and for multi-species biofilms were significantly smaller, indicating increased antibiotic resistance. Part II: The purpose was to determine the antibiotic concentration necessary for the zones of inhibition produced by the biofilms to equal that of broth cultures from Part I. The problem addressed was “At what antibiotic concentration do biofilm cultures demonstrate the antibiotic resistance of broth cultures?” Antibiotic concentrations were prepared from Ampicillin and Streptomycin salts and tested. The concentration necessary for biofilms to demonstrate an antibiotic resistance equal to that of the broth cultures varied between species of bacteria and type of antibiotic. <br><br>

BEACH CLOSINGS, IS IT THE KELP?
Rachel Lea Abramson
San Lorenzo Valley High, Felton, CA, United States

Every summer at Santa Cruz County beaches, beach-goers are dismayed at the warning signs posted for high fecal coliform levels in the waters. It has always been assumed that these high levels of bacteria have resulted from birds or polluted runoff. My purpose is to test a new theory that has been proposed by a water quality specialist. His theory was that decaying kelp could be one of the sources of elevated fecal indicator bacteria that has caused Cowell Beach to be posted with swimming advisories. My goal is to determine if decaying seaweeds are indeed the cause of increased coliform levels measured at Cowell Beach and which species of seaweed may be the culprit. I collect samples of seaweed in sterile Whirl-Pac Bags from Cowell Beach. Next, I crush the seaweed in the bag, shortly thereafter I add 100 mL of sterile water to each bag and incubate my samples at room temperature for 24 hours. After 24 hours, I employ the Membrane Filtration Process filtering the samples through a 0.45 micron filter, plating on MFC media and incubating at 44.5 degrees C for 24 hours. After which, I count and record number of fecal coliform colonies per 100 mL. Thus far not enough data has been collected to make any definitive conclusions.

THE EFFECT OF PH ON ELECTRICAL OUTPUT OF A MICROBIAL FUEL CELL
Timothy Chang
Stuyvesant High School, New York, NY, US

Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) hold the promise of a clean, renewable energy source. MFCs are powered by bacteria which generate free electrons as a by-product of anaerobic metabolism. These bacteria are common in the environment, particularly in benthic sediments. The effect of pH on electrical output was studied by modifying the pH of two fuel cells at regular intervals and then recording the increased or decreased electrical potential. Since the ideal growth pH for one common species of electricity-producing bacteria, Geobacter sulfurreducens, is 6.8, it was hypothesized that this pH would produce the maximum voltage. Two dual-chambered MFCs were constructed from plastic jars and tubing. The anaerobic microbes used were grown from a mixed culture of freshwater lake mud. After the MFCs produced electricity at a constant rate, the pH was altered incrementally more than 50 times using 1N HCl and 1N NaOH. The results showed a peak in voltage at a pH of 5.52 and showed two plateaus in voltage before and after the peak. This may indicate ideal pH levels for two species in the mixed culture. Thus, maximum electrical output appears to occur when the pH of the growth medium is capable of supporting both species simultaneously. These results provide some insight into optimizing electrical output of a MFC. Further research is needed into all aspects of MFC operation, in order to develop a cost-effective and useful energy source.

INVESTIGATION OF NEW MEXICO LICHENS: METABOLIC PRODUCTS FOR ANTIBIOTICS
Rebecca Renee Alexander
Gants High School, Nem Mexico, United States

Investigating the metabolic products of Lichens, collected from previously chosen sites in New Mexico (that have shown antibiotic properties) is the purpose of this project. The hypothesis is that some of the chemicals extracted from the lichens can be isolated and will have the potential to produce a better antibiotic. Extracts were produced using an acetone extraction technique and then tested on five strains of bacteria using the Disc Diffusion Method. <br><br>Samples were extracted, vacuum filtered and evaporated to remove excess acetone. Extracts were separated by Silica Gel Thin Layer Chromatography, producing various fractions for experiments to test the ability of these compounds to inhibit bacterial growth. The results have shown that Lichen samples 8 and 9 have the best ability to inhibit bacterial growth. Fractions separated from 8 have shown the greatest potential as a broad spectrum antibiotic substance by inhibiting the growth of both gram (+) and gram (-) bacteria. In most experiments it produced greater zones of inhibition than the antibiotics used and Usnic acid which was added as a positive control. <br><br>Cultures of the fungus isolated from samples 8 and 9 in Czapek DOX broth are growing. In the first experiments using the metabolic products from fermentation only sample 9-1 had a zone of inhibition. The method for filtering the metabolic products needs to be improved along with a process to concentrate and filter the extracts for further testing. Experiments are being designed to filter the media and remove the fungus. <br><br>

COMBINED EFFECTS OF CHITOSAN AND LACTOFERRIN ON STAPHYLOCOCCUS EPIDERMIDIS BIOFILMS
Kathryn Leigh Davis
Leesburg High School, Leesburg, Florida, USA

<br><br> Bacterial biofilms cause infections by their growth on implanted devices, contact lenses, and catheters. Biofilms cause many types of human infections, such as cystic fibrosis, dental caries, and ear infections. Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms have been implicated as a major cause of chronic wound infections. This research was to determine if the substances chitosan and lactoferrin could reduce biofilm formation and/or improve the effect of antibiotics on the bacteria found in a Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm.<br><br> A wild strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis was cultivated and a suspension of the organism placed in four batch growth reactors. Glass coupons coated with either chitosan, lactoferrin, chitosan and lactoferrin, or uncoated (control) were placed in one of the reactors, stirred and incubated to allow growth of a biofilm. The biofilms were then harvested from the coupons, the bacteria enumerated by dilution methodology and arithmetic formula, and MICS performed on the planktonic and sessile bacteria from each reactor. <br><br> Lactoferrin and chitosan alone and in combination inhibited growth of a biofilm of Staphylococcus epidermidis on the glass coupons equally, reducing the cfu/cm2 by 96.7% or a 1.47 LOG difference. The MICs of the planktonic bacteria and the biofilm bacteria in all reactors were the same as the original MICs of the organism, including the untreated control reactor. <br><br> Chitosan and lactoferrin could be used to coat implants and otherwise administered for treatment or prevention of human infections caused by biofilms. Chitosan could also be used in industrial and agricultural applications. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

A PILOT STUDY OF THE EFFECT OF SHORTWAVE ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT ON BACTERIAL CONTAMINATION OF LACTUCA SATIVA
Jennifer Erin Gutman
Wheeling Park High School, Wheeling, WV USA

The effect of shortwave (254 nm) ultraviolet light on the bacterial contamination of Lactuca sativa was investigated. The bacterial contamination of Lactuca sativa directly from pre packaged bags was observed by placing approximately 1 gram of leaves in 2ml of sterile saline. The sample was rinsed and .1ml was spread plated on tryptic soy agar (TSA) and eosin methylene blue (EMB) plates. The plates were incubated for 24 hours at 35.5 degrees Celsius and this was repeated using dilution series to yield a countable sample. A minimum of 4 x 10 cells per gram were present on each sample. Samples of Escherichia coli K12 in tryptic soy broth were tested and pipetted onto TSA plates; a 100% kill rate was observed at the minimum 1 minute exposure and beyond. A prototype UV exposure apparatus was constructed using an aluminum foil lined box with the ultraviolet light mounted 25.4 cm above the rack in the chamber. Additional samples of Lactuca sativa were tested exposing 1 gram samples of leaves to ultraviolet light for 1, 2, 5, 10 and 15 minutes. A series of 5 trials were conducted. For the 6th trial a spinning mesh chamber replaced the rack for more consistent results. At the shortest time tested, the ultraviolet light killed 99.9275% of the bacteria and at the 15 minute exposure 100% was killed. The use of 254 nm ultraviolet light in early testing was very effective at reducing the contamination and shows promise for commercial food production.

THE EFFECTS OF CAPSICUM SPP. ON MICROCOCCUS LUTEUS IN RELATION TO THE SCOFIELD FACTOR.
Shelby Elizabeth Oelklaus
Juneau-Douglas High School, Juneau, Alaska, United States

Abstract: The effects of Capsicum spp. on Micrococcus luteus in relation to the Scofield factor.<br><br> In order to determine how Capsicum spp. affected the growth of Micrococcus luteus in relation to the Scofield factor (scale to measure the heat level of chilies) , five different varieties of peppers were tested: Habanero, Jalapeno, Pablano, Anaheim, and Red Bell Pepper. Additionally, the ground peppers were extracted into two different liquids; spring water and mead wine (11% by volume alcohol) extract to mimic the Mayan’s different antibacterial uses of peppers. Control treatments were used for both spring water and mead extracts, and each of the treatments was replicated. I then measured the antibacterial halo where the peppers prevented the Micrococcus luteus from growing.<br><br> The data did not support the null hypothesis that Capsicum spp. would have no affect on the growth of Micrococcus luteus. The p-values of ANOVA analysis showed significant differences between pepper and extract treatments; however, these responses were not proportional to the Scofield factor. The data for the spring water extracts showed that the red bell pepper had the highest average halo of 3.32 mm, while Pablano had the lowest average of 0.69 mm. The data for mead extracts showed that red bell pepper had an average halo of 3.25 mm, while the anaheim had an average halo of 1.15 mm. The mead control indicated a higher effect (2.48 mm) than the spring water control (1.41 mm). These results suggest further study is warranted. <br><br>

MAGIC OF MUSHROOM , COPRINUS COMATUS DAMAGES NEMATODE WITH SPINY BALLS AND PRODUCES TOXINS TO IMMOBILIZE NEMATODE
Lin Fang
Middle School Attached to Yunnan Normal University, Kunming, Yunnan, P. R. China

Can you image a mushroom can attack nematode? But that is true. Earlier we reported a unique fungal structure called spiny ball on vegetative hyphae of Coprinus comatus contributed to immobilize nematodes. In this study, we showed that purified spiny balls immobilize and kill free-living nematode Panagrellus redivivus Goodey in high efficiency. Scanning electron microscopy studies illustrated that the spiny structure damaged the nematode cuticle, suggesting the presence of mechanical force in the process of immobilizing the nematode. Severe injury on nematode cuticle caused leakage of inner material of the nematode. When these structures were ground with liquid nitrogen, the efficacy against nematodes was lost, indicating the shape and the complete structure of the spiny ball are indispensable for its function. Moreover, extracting the structure with organic solvents never lowered their activity against P. redivivus, and the extracts showed no obvious effect on the nematode. We also investigated whether C. comatus was able to produce toxins which would aid in the immobilization of nematodes. Here we presented the identification of 7 toxins isolated from C. comatus which could immobilize the nematodes P. redivivus and Meloidogyne incognita (Kofoid & White) Chitwood. The structure of the toxins was identified with NMR, MS, IR, and UV spectrum data. Two compounds were revealed as novel compounds. The toxins found in C. comatus are O-containing hetero-cyclic compounds.<br><br>

THE STUDY OF SCREENING OF THE FEATHER DEGRADATION STRAIN AND ITS BEST CULTURE CONDITIONS
Ang Li
Jilin Provincial Experimental School ChangChun City JiLin CHINA

The objective of this study was to solve the existing problem that the feather keratin is difficult to degrade, which has resulted in a big waste of protein and environmental pollution. Microbial strains that can effectively degrade the feather keratin were screened from the feather that decayed in nature. Effective isolation media and effective methods of screening the strains were found out. Factors that have a larger effect on the growth and enzyme production of the strain were selected to conduct five experiments on proportioning of culture media composition, pH of culture media, water activity, culture temperature and duration. Through mensurating the numbers of thallus, nitrogen content and optical density in the degradation solution, the optimum culture conditions for the strain were found out from the experiments: cane sugar is the better carbon sources of this strains and the optimum amount of cane sugar added was approximately 2% of the weight of the feather powder, the optimum pH 7.5-8.0, the more appropriate water activity approximately 0.95, the optimum culture temperature 37 1 and the optimum culture duration 72h. The simulated experiments of the rate of pepsin digestion in animals showed that the rate of digestion in animals has reached to 70.26% after the feather keratin is degraded by the strain, and the rate of digestion in animals is increased by 34% compared with the high temperature hydrolyzed keratin now available, providing reference data and excellent strains for the production of feather protein feed. <br><br>

DECONTAMINATING TOOTHBRUSHES (YEAR TWO): EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GREEN TEA SPRAY BY PCR
Jessica Kaycee Lam
Keystone School, San Antonio, TX, United States of America

Toothbrushes can be contaminated by microorganisms after one use. Last year’s project determined that toothbrushes soaked in herbal solutions, including green tea, were effectively disinfected. Although inexpensive and easy to prepare, soaking solutions require frequent preparation. The commercial spray, Brushtox® Antiseptic Toothbrush Cleaner, offers a practical decontamination method, but is available only in the United Kingdom. The purpose of this project was to determine if green tea spray has the potential of being produced commercially. The hypotheses were green tea spray could effectively disinfect microbial-contaminated toothbrushes, eliminate Streptococcus mutans, and work as effectively as Brushtox®.<br><br> Eighty toothbrushes were collected after one use and divided into 4 groups: sprayed with Brushtox®, green tea, water, or soaked in green tea. Nine additional toothbrushes soaked in different S. mutans concentrations were sprayed with green tea. All toothbrushes were cultured before and after decontamination. The percent reduction of microorganisms was calculated. Duration of effectiveness was evaluated. Presence of S. mutans was determined by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).<br><br> Green tea spray and green tea soaking solution were equal (p=0.29) and both were statistically as effective as Brushtox (p= 0.65 and 0.5, respectively). Water was less effective than the test solutions (p= <0.0001). The percent reduction of S. mutans by green tea spray ranged from 85.7% to 100%. Colony reduction remained above 80% twenty-one days after preparation. PCR detected elimination of S. mutans.<br><br> The results supported the hypotheses that green tea spray could decontaminate toothbrushes as effectively as Brushtox® and was effective against S. mutans.

THE EFFECT OF GREEN TEA POLYPHENOLS ON LEVELS OF NUCLEOTIDE EXCISION REPAIR GENE EXPRESSION IN AND SURVIVAL RATE OF DICTYOSTELIUM DISCOIDEUM
Lillian Lee Tsai
Winston Churchill High School, Potomac, Maryland, USA

Epigallocatechin gallae (EGCG), the most prevalent green tea polyphenol, reduces UV-induced DNA damage and therefore may help prevent skin cancer. However, the mechanisms of this prevention remain unclear. This study hypothesizes that EGCG can increase the growth rate of Dictyostelium discoideum due to the prevention of DNA damage after UVB radiation. Dictyostelium discoideum was used as a model system since it is exceptionally resistant to UV damage and its genome is more closely related to the human genome than that of many other organisms such as yeast. In addition, the preventive effects of EGCG may be related to the upregulation of a set of genes that are specialized in repairing UV-induced DNA damage. This study indicates that UVB radiation may lead to a lag in cell growth, but doubling times do not appear to be affected. The mRNA expression levels of Nucleotide Excision Repair genes were studied using real time PCR. Although there is trend that shows an increase in mRNA expression, suggesting a possible mechanism of prevention, the results of this study are inconclusive. These findings provide novel insights into the potential implications of EGCG as a natural agent for the prevention of skin cancer.

THE EFFECTS OF DISINFECTING CONTACT SOLUTIONS IN RELATIONSHIP TO SOFT CONTACTS
Kama Jean Konda
Sisseton High School, Sisseton South Dakota, United States

Purpose: To determine whether or not disinfecting soft contact solutions will destroy commonly found bacteria on soft contact lenses. The bacteria used in the project are Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis). <br><br>Procedure: Five contact solutions containing a disinfecting agent for soft contacts were chosen. Each solution and control, which was distilled water, for each bacteria had a separate case. The soft contacts were swabbed with lyophilized S. aureus and placed in solutions to soak for four hours; same was done with the E. faecalis bacteria. After soaking, each contact was swabbed. The swab was streaked across a Petri dish with 5% sheep's blood agar. An inoculating loop was then used to thin the bacteria. Petri dishes were placed into an incubator for 48 hours at a constant temperature of 37 degrees Celsius. Petri dishes were removed and the colonies on the third and fourth quadrants were counted.<br><br>Data: On average, Solution 3 destroyed the most bacteria. Solution 5 was the most effective in the E. faecalis trials. For the S. aureus trials Solution 3 was most effective. There was a clear difference in the qualities of the different disinfecting solutions. <br><br>Conclusion: Overall, Solution 3 was the most effective solution. On average, the control was the second most effective at disinfecting soft contact lenses. The least effective was Solution 2. Some solutions were more effective at disinfecting, and the distilled water not being as effective as the disinfecting solutions was proven incorrect.<br><br>

5'-METHOXYHYDNOCARPIN AS AN INHIBITOR OF ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE IN E. COLI
Eric N. Delgado 
Bayonne High School, Bayonne NJ, United States 

Multidrug resistance pumps (MDRs), which protect bacteria from many classes of antibiotics, have become a serious concern in the treatment of bacterial infections. One of these pumps, the AcrB, a part of the AcrAB-TolC complex in E. coli, is an MDR with an extremely wide specificity. This study explored the employment of 5’-methoxyhynocarpin (5-MHC) as an inhibitor of the AcrB pump. 5-MHC is a molecular species that has been derived previously from plants within the berberis genus, which produces the natural antibiotic berberine. Using flash chromatography, 5-MHC was isolated from three different herbs indigenous to several diverse areas of the world. Because all of the herbs were indigenous to different regions, this data demonstrates that the development of 5-MHC in these herbs is not an isolated environmental response, but a widespread adaptation to the threat of resistant bacteria. Using crystal violet to measure the degree of active transport, the ability of the AcrB to effectively cause efflux was tested in the presence of varying concentrations of 5-MHC. Results of these experiments demonstrated that efflux was effectively inhibited. Finally utilizing a standard Minimum Inhibitory Concentration 90 test, the ability of the 5-MHC to function in the presence of conventional antibiotics, as opposed to its natural antibiotic complement, berberine, was also tested. Tests with Rifampicin and Kanamycin demonstrated significant inhibition of the pump in the presence of these antibiotics. Tests with Ampicillin demonstrated that 5-MHC had no significant effect. This is probably due to the ability of Ampicillin to permeate the cell membrane through porin channels, effectively, canceling out the effect of AcrB efflux.

ASCORBIC ACID AND NAPHTHOQUINONE INOCULATED KERATINOCYTE AND FIBROBLAST CULTURES RESISTANCE TO HSV-1 CONTINUED
Derek Kurtis Smith
Greenon High School, Springfield, Ohio

This project demonstrates the inhibition qualities of four organic compounds (ascorbic acid, naphthoquinone, riboflavin, and pyridoxine) in three cell types. The purpose of this experiment was to identify inhibition of HSV-1, Herpes Simplex Virus 1, in vitamin treated cell cultures. My hypothesis was the ascorbic acid vitamin solution at a 500µM concentration would present the strongest inhibition capability. <br><br> Relative toxicity of these vitamin treatments was tested through the establishment of four 1mM control samples. Murine keratinocytes, murine fibroblasts, and human fibroblasts were propagated until 80% confluence. The keratinocyte cell type never fully matured to confluence. Subsequently, the fibroblast cells were inoculated at concentrations of 100µM, 200µM, 500µM, and 1mM of each vitamin solution. The vitamin inoculation occurred one time over a 72 hour period. <br><br> Total plaque formation was analyzed after experimentation. The thymidine kinase deficient murine fibroblasts revealed no plaque developments as expected. Also, the human fibroblast cell line revealed no plaque developments, and the growing cells continued to proliferate unabatedly. Thus, 200 PFUs of HSV-1 are effectively inhibited by the use of these vitamin solutions. This leads to the conclusion that the vitamin solutions used for this experiment had a negative effect on the replication of HSV-1 in the fibroblast cultures. The most important development was discovered upon analysis of the vitamin control fibroblast cultures. This review revealed that all control cultures propagated for this experiment maintained greater than 99% viability. This justifies the safe use of these four vitamins as effective viral inhibitors.<br><br>

THE EXTRACT OF PSEUDELEPHANTOPUS SPICATUS AND IRESINE DIFFUSA (ARLOMO) FROM BARRANCA DE HUENTITÁN, JALISCO, MEXICO, AS AN ANTIBIOTIC AGAINST HUMAN PATHOGENIC AGENTS.
Daniel Evangelista Alatorre
Tecnologico de Monterrey, Campus Guadalajara Guadalajara Jalisco, Mexico

Since human pathogenic agents (HPA) have created resistance to common synthetic antibiotics (CSA), there have been developed new alternatives. So the purpose of this project was to evaluate the antimicrobial potential of the extract of Pseudelephantopus spicatus and Iresine diffusa (Arlomo) from Barranca de Huentitán, Jal. The project was divided in 4 phases. First: collection, taxonomic identification and production of the herbal extract as an alcoholic maceration. Second: (pilot test) the extract was placed in contact to eight microorganisms by means of agar diffusion method. Third: Standardization of the extract for future productions by Lowry’s spectrophotometric method. Fourth: comparative analysis of the extract faces to CSA by means of Minimum Inhibitory Concentration method over the most frequent bacteria on a hospital during January and February. So the actual results were: during the pilot test, the extract showed bacteriostatic behaviour due to partial inhibition rings (average: 19.04mm) over Salmonella typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus; nevertheless, it showed bactericidal/fungicidal behaviour due to total inhibition rings (average: 9.95mm) over Klebsiella pneumoiae, Candida albicans, Pseudomona aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Bordetella bronchiseptica. It was determined that Pseudelephantopus spicatus enclose 0.251mcg/ml of proteins while Iresine diffusa 0.258mcg/ml. Most frequent bacteria presented only 46.92% of sensibility face to CSA at heavy concentrations, yet 100% of sensibility face to the extract at mainly 1:4 and 1:8 dilutions, so it could be proved administrating it in vivo at a 1:2 dilution to assure its potentiality. The extract of Pseudelphantopus spicatus and Iresine diffusa. (Arlomo) presents antibiotic activity against some HPA.

ANTIMICROBIAL PROPERTIES OF ALLICIN GARLIC EXTRACT AND CIPROFLOXACIN AGAINST E. COLI K-12
Keegan Mikel Sims
Sherando High School, Stephens City, Virginia, USA

The purpose of this study was to answer the question, "Is allicin garlic extract an effective natural antibacterial against E. coli K-12 as compared to a synthesized broad spectrum antibiotic?" Hypotheses were that allicin garlic extract would inhibit growth of E. coli K-12, and it would be as potent as ciprofloxacin.<br><br> Disk diffusion antibacterial susceptibility testing was performed for 20 Mueller-Hinton agar plates using the Kirby-Bauer method. Normal saline (control) and four antimicrobial solutions (raw garlic, two concentrations of Allimed® liquid, and ciprofloxacin) were tested. Zone of inhibition measurements were analyzed using a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and dependent t-tests.<br><br> Raw inhibition measurements were the same for all control and Allimed® disks (6.0 +/- 0.0 mm). The mean inhibition for ciprofloxacin (40.9 +/- 3.2 mm) was 1.9 times larger than raw garlic (21.2 +/- 0.6 mm). ANOVA showed significant differences among conditions. Post hoc testing showed no difference between the control and Allimed® conditions, but raw garlic and ciprofloxacin means were different from the control condition, and each other.<br><br> The results of this study partially supported the hypotheses. Aqueous raw garlic contained sufficient allicin to inhibit growth of E. coli K-12, but was not as effective as ciprofloxacin. Allimed® liquid was most likely ineffective due to chemical instability. A freshly prepared solution using allicin powder may match the potency of ciprofloxacin, thus preventing overuse of synthetic antibiotics.

OPTIMIZING BACTERICIDAL EFFECTS OF CINNAMON OIL ON TRICLOSAN-RESISTANT ESCHERICHIA COLI IN VARIOUS SOLUTIONS AND FUNGICIDAL ACTIONS AGAINST SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIA
Joseph Hong
Bloomington High School South, Bloomington, Indiana, United States of America

The project is the result of biological experimentation about antimicrobial properties of cinnamon-leaf essential oil against normal/triclosan-resistant E. coli strain K12 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The goal was to determine whether cinnamon-leaf oil could be used to replace usage of household antimicrobial-agents. Cinnamon oil, when compared, demonstrated more success against E. coli and S. cerevisiae; its antimicrobial actions were optimized by mixing it with other agents.<br><br>The oil’s bactericidal effect was determined by lawning E. coli on petri dish and then putting four drops of the oil on different places; same was repeated for other agents used: hand-sanitizer, sanitizer-and-oil mixture, hand-soap, and soap-and-oil solution. Triclosan-resistant bacteria were created by taking ones surviving from a dish that had been inoculated with 0.1% triclosan-soap-solution and E. coli. The inhibition rate of each agent was measured by taking the average diameter of four inhibition “circles” around each spot of the drop. The effective concentration of cinnamon oil turned out to be 20% or greater solutions and thus all cinnamon oil used were from 20% solutions.<br><br>The fungicidal effect was determined in the same way as the antibacterial effects. S. cerevisiae was obtained in solid form then was mixed in water to provide in liquid form for the experiment. The results were also determined the same way. However, different agents were used: Listerine and 20% cinnamon oil. <br><br>Cinnamon leaf essential oil was proved by this project to have effective bactericidal and fungicidal actions, even better than common household products. Sparsely known benefits have been demonstrated.<br><br>

THE ANTIMICROBIAL PROPERTIES OF THE ISOLATES OF CURCUMA LONGA AND ITS GROWTH IMPEDIMENT EFFECTS ON ESCHERICHIA COLI - YEAR 3
Nhila Jagadeesan
Lake Central High School, Saint John, Indiana, USA

The purpose was to determine if all the compounds of Curcuma longa exhibit antimicrobial properties and inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli.<br><br> My hypothesis was that all the compounds would exhibit antimicrobial properties and equally inhibit the growth of E coli. First, Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) was used to isolate the compounds of turmeric into sections with specific retardation factor values. The TLC plate, which had absorbed the turmeric-water solution, was marked every 1.5 centimeters, with water as the mobile phase. Sections were separated and a solution was made from them. The same procedure was done with a turmeric-oil solution, with ethanol as mobile phase, separating the non-polar components. The solutions were centrifuged to separate the turmeric isolates and the solvent from the silica gel. <br><br> In the experiment’s second stage, blank sterile disks were dipped in various turmeric isolate solutions and placed on Petri dishes inoculated with E.coli. The radius of the inhibition zones around the disks was measured after 20 hours and after 44 hours of incubation. The controls, water and oil, contained no turmeric.<br><br> The result was that there were inhibition zones around all the disks dipped in the turmeric isolate solutions. The inhibition rates of the turmeric isolate solutions were similar in most cases.<br><br>Therefore, my hypothesis that all polar and non-polar compounds of turmeric would exhibit the antimicrobial properties was proven correct. I was also correct in saying that there would be no major differences in inhibition zones for the various turmeric isolate solutions.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT ON INFECTED SPINACEA OLERACEA
Terra Richardson
Fremont High School, Plain City, Utah, United States

Recently an E. coli scare, caused by contaminated spinach, sickened many in the United States. Several methods, including use of ultraviolet light, have been used to prevent E. coli from retail produce. The purpose of this project was to see if ultraviolet light could control the growth of harmful bacteria. In this experiment two types of bacterium were used, Micrococcus luteus and Rhodococcus rhodochrous. Fifteen Spinacia oleracea leafs were infected with Micrococcus luteus and another fifteen with Rhodococcus rhodochrous by dripping a bacterial solution onto the Spinacia oleracea leafs using a pipette. Ten from each group were exposed to ultraviolet light, while five from each group were exposed to normal light. Depending on the day the Spinacia oleracea leafs were exposed to anywhere from one minute to two-and-a-half minutes under the two types of light. Samples of the bacterial solutions were taken from the Spinacia oleracea leafs after its regulated increment of time. This was done by using a sterile inoculating tube and dipping it into the solution then spreading it on the Petri dish in an “S” shaped pattern. After allowing 24 hours of incubation, the number of colonies were counted and recorded. Results showed that the Spinacia oleracea leafs subjected to ultraviolet light had ¼ the amount of bacterial growth as the Spinacia oleracea leafs under normal light. These results show ultraviolet light has the potential to assist in the fight against bacterial infection of produce.

IDENTIFYING THE HERBAL CHEMICAL CONSTITUENTS RESPONSIBLE FOR INHIBITION OF BACTERIA
Shruti Ramesh Hegde
Jasper High School, Plano, Texas, United States

This experiment tested medicinal herbs and its inhibitory effects on Escherichia coli DH5aTM-T1R, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC 23857, pathogens causing foodborne illnesses. The purpose was to identify the chemical constituents present in ocimum and coleus responsible for the inhibition of the bacteria. It was hypothesized that ocimum would inhibit the most bacteria.<br><br>Each of the bacteria was exposed to positive control (ampicillin), negative control (no treatment), and not extracted, ethyl acetate extracted, and water extracted for ocimum and coleus. Thin-layer chromatography was done to separate the compounds. Using absorbance spectrometer, absorbency and bacterial concentrations were calculated. Mass spectroscopy was used to identify the chemical constituent in these herbs.<br><br>When TLC was conducted, the separation was distinct only in 50% ethanol, 50% water solution. Ocimum proved to be more effective in inhibiting the growth of bacteria. In ocimum ethyl-acetate extraction had lower absorbencies which suggests a greater inhibition; however, coleus water extraction had greater absorbency which suggests that it promoted the growth of bacteria. These rates displayed that the antimicrobial properties must be present in ethyl acetate extractions due to low bacterial concentration. Through mass spectroscopy, the main chemical constituent present in ocimum was dehydro-a-lapachone and in coleus, glaucic acid (fumaric acid). This chemical can be administered in a drug that can combat problems such as diarrhea, dysentery, and various foodborne illnesses. The water extraction could be used to combat problems such as loss of gut bacteria in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.<br><br>

USE OF NATURAL PLANT EXTRACTS TO PREVENT FOOD-BORNE DISEASES
Jakob D. Oberg
Snowcrest Junior High, Eden, Utah, USA

Food-borne diseases are a serious health concern in the United States resulting in millions of cases and thousands of deaths each year. Previous research has shown that some essential oils exhibit antibacterial properties. Using the disc assay method, 16 essential oils were screened for inhibition against teaching strains of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Shigella boydii, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus cereus, and Salmonella enteritidis. Although some essential oils didn’t produce zones of inhibition against all test bacteria, each oil did inhibit at least a few bacterial strains. Essential oils with the largest inhibition zones were thyme, cinnamon bark, mountain savory, and lemongrass. A dose response test was performed to see if decreasing the amount of essential oil would still have an inhibitory effect. Decreasing the dose by two-thirds still resulted in large zones of inhibition for thyme while mountain savory and cinnamon bark inhibition zone size decreased slightly. Using oils in combination resulted in some synergism of bacterial inhibition between oils particularly when thyme was paired with either mountain savory or cinnamon bark oils. These three oils were then mixed with test bacteria in broth and growth monitored over time. All three oils significantly inhibited growth out to six days when compared to the controls. Results from these four experiments indicate essential oils could be incorporated in disinfectants to replace harsh disinfectants currently used to sanitize kitchens and food preparation areas and, thus, decrease the incidence of food-borne disease transmission.

This study is in response to the increasing antibiotic resistance of pneumolysin, a pore-forming cytotoxin produced by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Previous studies have indicated pneumolysin the vital virulence factor of S. pneumoniae inducing severe cellular damage and the primary incentive of this pathogen’s toxicity. The objective of this study is to determine if immunization of rabbits with either native heat-inactivated pneumolysin (HI-PLY) or mutant pneumolysin (WU-PLY) yield significant anti-pneumolysin antibodies. <br><br>During 2 sets of active immunization, 12 rabbits, 6 from each set, blood samples were collected to acquire the antibodies produced prior to and subsequent to primary, secondary and tertiary boosts each week. Serum was accumulated from each sample and ELISA titers were performed on serum. <br><br>Immunization with either pneumolysin immunogens produced significantly high anti-pneumolysin titers greater than A405= 0.129 in contrast to those of the mock rabbits whose titers were significantly lower possessing a minuscule of anti-pneumolysin antibodies thus eliciting little protection against the toxicity of S. pneumoniae. <br><br>The effectiveness of HI-PLY and MT-PLY in producing high titers of antibody against pneumolysin suggests a probable effective antibiotic to elicit protection against S. pneumoniae and diminish the efficiency of Gram-positive pneumococcal infections.<br><br>

MICROBIAL EYE NUISANCE THE RESPONSE OF SERRATIA MARCESCENS TO VARIOUS STERILIZATION TECHNIQUES.
Katie Joan Nix
Grove High School, Grove, Oklahoma, United States of America

Endophthalmitis is an infection caused by contamination during an ocular surgery. Approximately one in 3,000 patients who undergo cataract surgery develop endophthalmitis. This number can be reduced by more effective sterilization of intraocular lenses. The question in this experiment: Which method of sterilization is most efficient in killing Serratia Marcescens from the surface of intraocular lenses?<br><br> It was hypothesized that peracetic acid would be the most effective method. This is because peracetic acid is often used in hospitals to sterilize items used in surgery. <br><br> Three trials were conducted, using a variety of variances of each method. The intraocular lenses were soaked in a Serratia marcescens bacterial solution overnight. The lenses were then placed in sterile Petri dishes, four per dish. Each Petri dish was then subjected to a method of sterilization. The methods used include: autoclaving, dry heat, peracetic acid, methanol, ethanol, UV short wave light, and isopropanol. The lenses were then placed in small vials containing sterile water and placed on a rocker/shaker overnight. A 10ul sample of water was taken for bacterial counts. <br><br> The hypothesis proved to be partially true. When used at a one percent dilution or higher peracetic acid is effective. Other groups that were completely effective include: autoclaving when used for ten minutes at fifteen psi, dry heat when used at 165°C for 45 and 90 minutes, and 100% methanol. Autoclaving and dry heat would not be suitable for intraocular lenses though because the heat clouds the lenses. <br><br> If more time and resources were available more methods would have been used. There are a variety of methods that should be tested that could be safer for lenses. <br><br>

ISOLATION OF NUTRITIONAL MUTANTS OF ESCHERICHIA COLI
Samuel Emerson Harvey
Roanoke Valley Governor's School, Roanoke, Virginia, United States of America

This experiment was designed to isolate nutritional mutants from an N1624 strain of Escherichia coli as well as to determine the nutritional deficiency of said mutants. The bacterial strain was infected with a bacteriophage that inserted a transposon of viral DNA into the bacterial genome, creating a library of genetically different cells. Nutritional mutants are bacteria unable to synthesize a particular amino acid due to the interference of the transposon on the corresponding gene. This deficiency must be supplied to facilitate growth.<br><br> An enriched medium containing the nutrients E. coli need for survival and a minimal medium lacking only amino acids were prepared. Two hundred and fifty colonies were inoculated from the N1624 library and through growth comparison, three nutritional mutants were identified and designated C35, C39, and C48. These three colonies grew on enriched media but not the minimal.<br><br> Solutions of fifteen amino acids were prepared and spread on minimal plates. C48 grew only on the plate supplemented with leucine. C39 did not grow at all, and C35 grew sporadically on several plates. An amino acid supplement containing eighteen amino acids, including four unavailable individually, was spread on minimal plates. C48 unexpectedly did not grow on this supplement. C39 did grow, indicating deficiency in histadine, isoleucine, arginine, or tryptophan production. C35’s unexplainable growth on available media suggested its deficiency could be another compound or an amino acid metabolic pathway. The only mutant whose deficiency could be determined within the parameters of the study was the leucine deficiency of C48.<br><br>

A NOVEL TREATMENT USING ULTRASOUND SONICATION TO REMOVE FOOD-BORNE MICROBES FROM FRESH-CUT PRODUCE
Ying Fan
Cookeville High School, Cookeville, TN, USA

This project follows the development of a novel treatment using ultrasound sonication to remove food-borne microbes from fresh-cut produce. Spinacia oleracea in prepackaged baby spinach was the focus of an amoeba population comparison before and after treatment, a surface bacteria concentration analysis in relation to the treatment, and a feasibility investigation. The novel treatment was hypothesized to decrease both amoeba and bacteria concentrations on prepackaged spinach and positively affect shelf-life.<br><br> As the treatment, a 5-minute ultrasound sonication paired with a 1 C sterilized bath was utilized while the control consisted of only a 5-minute immersion in Tris buffer. A fluorescence-based assay of LIVE/DEAD BacLight stained animate and deceased amoeba and bacteria found on baby spinach for enumeration in fields under the microscope. For the amoeba concentration study, the amoeba species used was Acanthamoeba polyphega. The feasibility study included a study on the practicability of the treatment process for commercial application and a quality control test. <br><br> For the amoeba variation experiment, the sonication treatment eliminated 71.9% to 93% of the surface A. polyphega. Meanwhile, the total average surface bacteria concentration decreased by 78.9% after the sonication treatment. Based on this study, it can be concluded that both the amoeba and bacterial concentrations in prepackaged spinach decreased noticeably after the ultrasound sonication treatment. The feasibility study showed that the treatment possesses ease of usage, few required resources, and no quality change in the spinach. Commercial applications of the treatment procedure for the fresh-cut produce industry are suggested by the results of this study.

CELLULAR TRANSLATION FACTORS REQUIRED FOR VIRION HOST SHUTOFF (VHS) FUNCTION OF HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS: EFFECT OF SIRNA-INDUCED DEPLETION OF CELLULAR FACTORS ON VHS ACTIVITY
Nandini Sarma
Shawnee Mission East High School, Prairie Village, KS, USA

Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) is a highly contagious infectious agent that causes various diseases and affects approximately 80% of the human population. The Virion Host Shutoff (Vhs) protein is an essential component of HSV that initiates host mRNA degradation during infection, ultimately leading to cell death. Vhs binds to certain eukaryotic cellular translation factors, such as eIF4H and eIF4B, but the significance of these factors on Vhs function was unknown. Thus, the objective of this study was to explore the effect of siRNA-induced depletion of cellular translation factors, such as eIF4H and eIF4B, on Vhs function. RNAi was used to deplete protein by using siRNA (small interfering RNA) targeted at the specific genes to silence gene production. HeLa cells transfected with siRNA targeting the translation factors were infected with Wild Type HSV-1. The cells were analyzed by Real-Time rtPCR targeting 18S-rRNA and ACTB-mRNA. The results showed significantly lower amounts of mRNA in HSV-infected mock-transfected, GAPDH, and eIF4B siRNA-transfected cells compared to the HSV mock-infected cells, confirming Vhs induced mRNA degradation. However, eIF4H siRNA-transfected cells had up to 99% of the gene expression of normal, mock-infected cells, indicating a lack of Vhs activity, thus suggesting that eIF4H is essential to Vhs function. The requirement of eIF4H binding in the Vhs pathway is a new finding that exposes the mechanism of HSV infections. These results have great potential for the development of novel effective antiviral treatments or possible cures not only for HSV infections, but also for other viral infections in general.

A NEW NON-TOXIC PSEUDO-PLASTIC HOME DISINFECTANT: PROPERTIES OF ITS UNIQUE DRY FILM.
Camila Giordano
Nuestra Seniora de Los Angeles number 8027, Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina.

Non-intentional poisonings with home disinfectants, mainly with chlorine derivatives, show a remarkable evolution in Rosario (Argentine) since 2000, being still a recurrent problem. <br><br>To solve this, we proposed as an alternative, the development of a novel, low risk, product totally efficient as a germicide in both, horizontal and vertical surfaces. With this aim in mind, we elaborated a powerful anti-microbial agent, that we called “Genius disinfectant”, composed of different proportions of citric acid, acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide, as active compounds. Additionally, through the incorporation of sodium carboxy-methyl-cellulose (CMC), a non-toxic additive that avoids losses by draining, we modified the viscous properties of our product converting it in an excellent choice for its application in vertical surfaces.<br><br>“Genius disinfectant” forms a stable fixed anti-microbial liquid film that dries after its application, maintaining non-volatile acidic derivatives able to create a physical-chemical barrier that prevents the microbial development until its next use. Besides, the careful selection of its specific aroma made it a pleasant option.<br><br>To evaluate the bactericide capability of our product we perform microbiological tests to both, the viscous product and its unique dry film. In addition, complementary assays were included, such as: viscosity measures, UV transmission of the plastic package, corrosivity of the product to different materials, IR spectrophotometry, scanning electronic microscopy, oil absorption tests of the dry film and durability.<br><br>The final result was an exceptional disinfectant with extraordinary properties that offers an effective solution to home poisonings with this kind of products.<br><br><br><br>

ANTIBIOTIC ENHANCEMENT USING ALLIUM CEPA EXTRACTS
Jonathan Christian Ryherd
Lutheran School Association High School, Decatur, Illinois, United States

The purpose of this project was to determine whether onion extracts can demonstrate synergistic qualities when used in conjunction with conventional antibiotics against typical nonvirulent bacteria.<br><br> The researcher obtained and prepared all materials necessary for creating and testing bacterial cultures. After petri dish preparation was complete, the researcher placed the various types of treatment disks on the plates (antibiotic, antibiotic+onion extract, onion extract, blank). After 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours, the recession was measured and recorded. All data was entered into a statistical analysis program and the bacterial cultures were destroyed by steam autoclave.<br><br> The cursory view of the results shows that the combination of onion and antibiotic treatments yielded a larger zone of inhibition than the antibiotic treatment alone. The statistical analysis confirms these results, with Sig. numbers of .000 for both Levene's test for equality of variances and the t-test for equality of means. In other words, the differences in the zone size have less than a 0.1% probability of being caused by chance.<br><br> In conclusion, the researcher's hypothesis was supported partially. The onion extracts did exhibit a synergistic quality beyond a simple additive effect, and streptomycin, an aminoglycoside, was not affected as much as penicillin or ampicillin, which contain BETA-lactam rings. However, penicillin's performance was not boosted to that of ampicillin, contrary to the researcher's hypothesis.<br><br> This research could be applicable for the future; with microbes rapidly developing resistance to antibiotics, boosting the performance of the antibiotics with onion extracts could be beneficial.

THE EFFECTS OF ANTIOXIDANTS ON LIFESPAN USING THE C. ELEGANS MODEL
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
Yorktown High School, Yorktown Heights NY, United States

Oxidative stress is the state in which the amount of free radicals outnumbers the amount of antioxidants in the body. Free radicals are negatively charged ions created in metabolic processes. Oxidative stress creates an unstable cellular environment, which is hypothesized to be responsible for numerous neurological diseases, cancer, and even wrinkles. Antioxidants, compounds that neutralize free radicals, are created and consumed in every day products. This study tested the effect of various antioxidants on lifespan using the C. elegans model.<br><br> C. elegans were used as a 'guinea pig' model because of their relatively short lifespan, genome structure, and undemanding environment in which it grows.<br><br> Antioxidants were chosen based on a biomax database. Compounds with the highest amount of citations to antioxidant capabilities were chosen and tested. Overall, the antioxidant drugs tested extended lifespan. In some cases longevity was extended drastically, from the 12 day-old control to the 45 day-old sample tested with lipoic acid.<br><br> The benefits of this project are clear. Practical applications include using antioxidant application methods in the early stages of degenerative diseases, such as macular degeneration. In other words, we may one day utilize antioxidants to prevent degenerative maladies that oxidative stress induces.

THE EFFECT OF APIS MELIFFERA VENOM ON DIFFERENT TYPES OF CANCER AND BACTERIA CELLS
Skyler Greg Carter
American Fork High School, American Fork Utah, United States Of America

Apis mellifera venom has been thought to cure different ailments of the human body; this is called apitherapy. The protein mellitin has been determined to be one of the main components in bee venom that breaks down the cell membrane. The purpose of this project was to test this hypothesis on different types of cancer and bacteria cells. To obtain bee venom, I first used a shock plate. A shock plate is a device that causes bees to deposit their venom onto a piece of glass, and the venom is later collected. The shock plate produced minimal results, so I turned to a milking procedure. <br><br>Breast cancer colonies were subjected to different concentrations of bee venom and incubated for twenty-four hours. After incubating, a cell count was conducted. The venom was found to break down cell membranes of the cancer cells and caused 100% cell death in all concentrations.<br><br>Bacteria cultures were treated in the same way by putting the bee venom solution onto the agar before cell growth had occurred. After incubating the plates for forty-eight hours, the results were no bacteria grew around where the bee venom was deposited. <br><br>

EVALUATING THE EFFECTS OF SELECTED ANTIBIOTICS ON THE MOTILITY, ADHERENCE, AND TRANSFORMATION RATES OF E. COLI AND PSEUDOMONAS FLUORESCENS.
Alexandria Victoria McNeely
Miami High School, Miami, Oklahoma, United States of America

Antibiotics are used to treat infections caused by pathogenic bacteria. Some bacteria have become resistant to all approved antibiotics. Research suggests that antibiotics influence bacteria motility, adherence, and transformation rates thus accelerating the multi-drug resistance problem. This experiment investigates the effects of selected antibiotics on motility and adherence of E. coli and Pseudomonas fluorescens. The project further evaluates the effects of selected antibiotics on the transformation rate of E. coli. It is hypothesized that:1) the antibiotics tested will decrease the motility of E. coli and Pseudomonas fluorescens; 2) the antibiotics tested will inhibit attachment mechanisms in both bacteria as the concentration of antibiotics increases; and 3) antibiotic exposure will increase transformation rates. A standard zone of inhibition test was conducted to determine the effectiveness of the selected antibiotics. Then, the motility was tested with a soft-agar motility test using antibiotic enriched agar. The adherence of each bacteria was also calculated by serially diluting the antibiotic concentration, adding a standard bacteria concentration, allowing biofilms to develop for 24 hours. A crystal violet assay was conducted to quantify the biofilms and was evaluated by measuring the absorbance with a plate reader. The effect of antibiotics on transformation rate was evaluated by using the pGLO plasmid.protocol modified to include an antibiotic shock treatment. This experiment shows that all antibiotics tested decreased motility (ANOVA 0.0001). This experiment also shows that as the antibiotic concentration increases, the adherence of bacteria decreases. Specifically gentamicin and neomycin are most effective at biofilm inhibition for Pseudomonas and E. coli. Finally, the data suggests that some antibiotics increase transformation rates, (gentamicin, neomycin, streptomycin, and tetracycline) while the rest of the antibiotics had no effect on transformation rate.<br><br><br>

INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF GARLIC VARIETIES AGAINST SELECTED GRAM+ BACTERIA
Courtney Renae Foss
Maddock Public, Maddock, ND, USA

This project in its present form is the result of biological analysis experimentation of the inhibitory effects of garlic varieties against selected Gram+ bacteria. By carefully performing this experiment and recording data properly, I will see how the different garlic varieties affect the two selected Gram+ bacteria. <br><br>I performed my first experiment using the crushed garlic against both the Micrococcus luteus and Serratia marcescens. I performed 5 trials on both types of bacteria using 10 agars for each experiment. To record my data, I measured the size of the clear, circular inhibition zone around each sterile disk using millimeters. <br><br>I also completed three separate Kirby-Bauer tests, which shows if bacteria will be inhibited by common antibiotics. I used this test as a control to show if my experiment and results are working. The results can turn out resistant, intermediate, or sensitive. The larger the number the more sensitive it becomes. The largest measurement I had in all of my results was eleven millimeters, which shows that both of the gram + bacteria were resistant to the garlic. <br><br>My results of this experiment were not accurate with my hypothesis. I predicted that the 70% solution would work the best against the bacteria. This is because in alcohol, a 70% solution kills more bacteria rather than at 100%. The results of my experiment showed that the 100% solution was the most effective. <br><br>

COMPARING THE ANTI-MICROBIAL EFFECTS OF SELECTED HONEYS ON ESCHERICHIA COLI
Nyssa Catherine Boyd
Eastern High School, Pekin, Indiana, USA

The purpose of this project was to determine if differences in anti-microbial effects could be seen between different types of honey. This was done by looking at honeys of varying color, age, and processing methods. A variation of the Kirby-Bauer method was used for this. It was hypothesized that a difference in antimicrobial properties could be found between different types of honey. This was partially supported. ANOVA was used to determine if the variation between treatments was greater than the variation within treatments. A t-test was also used to compare specific groups of data. Statistically, the new honey had a greater anti-microbial effect than the older honey. This may indicate that the active ingredient or ingredients are something that may dissipate over time. It was also statistically shown that processed honey had less of an anti-microbial effect than raw honey. This suggests that processing may eliminate the beneficial components, possibly because of the heat used when commercial honey is processed. It was surprising to find that the darkness of honey does not affect its antimicrobial properties, as a darker color might have indicated a higher concentration of the active ingredients. When the weakest and strongest honeys were analyzed in a gas chromatograph, differences in their compositions were determined. It may be possible to isolate the different compounds in future research.

THE POTENTIAL OF MARINE BIOLUMINESCENT BACTERIA AS ANTIBACTERIAL AGENTS AGAINST TWO MAJOR RICE DISEASES CAUSED BY XATHOMONAS ORYZAE PV. ORYZAE & XANTHOMONAS ORYZAE PV. ORYZICO
Luiji John Karlo Miravalles Suarez
Doña Hortencia Salas Benedicto Nat'l HS, La Carlota City, Neg. Occ., Philippines

The Marine Bioluminescent Bacterium, a light-emitting type of microorganism has been noted as a potential bio-indicator of environmental problems in aquatic ecosystem. In the medical field, studies have also shown its possible use as a biosensor to diagnose medical conditions.<br><br> This research aimed to establish another possible role for this bacterium in the agricultural setting: the use of bioluminescent bacterium as an antibacterial agent. This investigation targeted two major bacterial diseases in rice: bacterial blight disease caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and bacterial leaf streak caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola. According to the International Rice Research Institute, these two diseases often cut yields as high as 60% in Asia. <br><br> The Marine Bioluminescent Bacteria were isolated from three different marine organisms; namely, long-jawed mackerel (Rastrelliger sp.), market squid (Loligo opalescens), and white leg shrimp (Penaeus vennamei). The antibacterial activity of each species was tested against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola using paper disc diffusion method. Treatments A, B, C used Vibrio fischeri, Vibrio phosphoreum and Vibrio orientalis, respectively, with Treatment D using streptomycin sulfate as positive control and Treatment E using distilled water as negative control. <br><br> The zones of inhibition were measured after 24 hours treatment. One-way Analysis of Variance showed that the marine bioluminescent bacteria are effective antibacterial agents with Treatment B (Vibrio phosphoreum) as the most effective as shown in Duncan's Multiple Range Test. The results of this research showed the great potential of Marine Bioluminescent Bacteria as antibacterial agents against the two major pathogens of rice.<br><br><br><br>

Reduction in the aquaculture production in Southeast Asian countries has been caused by<br><br>bacteria, viruses and parasites. Occurrences of antibacterial components of fish mucus<br><br>have attracted research interest in aquaculture industry because of biochemical diversity<br><br>and broad specificity against bacteria and fungi.<br><br>Antimicrobial effects of pond-cultured fish skin mucus secretions of sea bass (Lates <br><br>calcarifer), grouper (Epinephelus areolatus), Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and<br><br>rabbitfish (Siganus guttatus) were tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli,<br><br>Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, and Aeromonas hydrophila. To determine the<br><br>involvement of fish mucus proteins possibly lectins in the antibacterial activity,<br><br>fucose-binding proteins were detected.<br><br>Microbiological assay was tested by Agar cup/well Diffusion Method. Five wells using 7<br><br>mm cork-borer were made on Mueller Hinton Agar and 100 ul of fish mucus was placed<br><br>in the well and incubated at 32 C room temperature. Microtiter Plate Assay was<br><br>performed to detect fucose-binding proteins. Fish mucus samples were coated on<br><br>microplate wells, blocked and washed prior to adding horseradish peroxidase labeled<br><br>fucosylated – Bovine Serum Albumin. Substrate was added, incubated and absorbance<br><br>measured at 450 nm.<br><br>Mucus from sea bass showed best antimicrobial activity against test organisms. Other<br><br>mucus secretions also exhibited antimicrobial properties. Proteins possibly lectins were<br><br>shown to be present in all fish mucus samples except sea bass. This evidence shows<br><br>possible presence of lectins as antimicrobial peptide. These findings demonstrate the<br><br>possible role of fish mucus secretions as a source of potentially useful antibiotic on<br><br>humans and acts as a host defense mechanism of fish.

ADVANCING PLASMID DNA TRANSFECTION WITH VARIOUS CHEMICALS ENCLOSED WITHIN LIPOSOMES
Benjamin Louis Ho
Suncoast Community High School, Riviera Beach Florida, United States

There are various methods for gene transfection using viral and polymer vectors yet these available methods create high cytotoxicity and can often kill the cells. Using a cationic liposome decreases the amount of cytotoxicity present yet the transfection of DNA using cationic liposomes has not yet found an effective and efficient method. Adding different chemicals within the liposome might assist it in being an effective transfection vector. The goal of the study is to determine which chemical within the liposome to aid in the transfection process due to its ability to separate into three particles. To complete this experiment one mg/ml Dioleoylo-Trimethlyammonium-Propane/Dioleoyl Phosphatidylethanolamine liposomes will be made separately with HBS buffer (Hank's Balance Salt), 150 mm NaHCO3, glucose, sucrose, fructose, and malitrose. The expression of the luciferase gene will then be measured and will determine how well the transfection took place. The data showed that glucose had the highest luciferase expression compared to the other chemicals and thereby is the agent with the highest transfection rate. Due to standard deviation the sucrose and malitrose both have approximately the same expression with malitrose being slightly higher. Furthermore the vast error in fructose is that its data cannot accurately show this agent's luciferase expression. The hypothesis was proven wrong but since the glucose showed the highest amount of luciferase expression this demonstrates that it can be used as a plausible transfection agent.

IMPACT OF TIDES AND CULTURE MEDIA ON BACTERIAL ENZYMATIC ACTIVITY, MORPHOLOGY AND PHYLOGENY
Nina Oiyen Wong
Dr. Michael M. Krop Senior High School, Miami, Florida, USA

The purpose of this experiment is to determine the differences in phylogeny, morphology and enzymatic activity of bacteria isolated from the mouth of Oleta River into North Biscayne Bay at high and low tides, cultured on varying bacterial growth media. The bacteria were characterized based on visible morphology, Gram staining, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), gene sequence, and enzymatic activity. <br><br> Bacteria on the same culture media from similar tidal periods tended to have more similarities based on a Simpson’s Index and species richness. The variations between culture media and tidal periods based on the Simpson’s Index and richness that showed Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) statistical significance (p<0.05) were not surprising. Minimal media limits the amount of nutrients by providing only the exact vital compounds for bacterial growth; tides cause movements and changes in ecological communities. However, the lack of statistical significance between water groups (fresh and salt) was unexpected because of the estuarine condition from which the samples were collected (p>0.05). Phylogeny and enzymatic activity tests are currently being run for replication of trials. Knowledge from this study will lead to the development of new applications of biotechnology using organisms, such as bacteria, to areas that include: fermentation processes, chemical manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, energy, food products, agriculture, and microbial mining. <br><br>

CAVE PRESCRIPTIONS? SEEKING ANTI-MICROBIALS FROM EXTREMOPHILES
Mary Lou Leone Hedberg
North Attleboro High School, North Attleboro, Massachusetts USA

While studying bats at Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico, this researcher became interested in the possibility of extracting medicinal compounds from cave extremophiles (microorganisms living in extreme environments). Samples from the warm, dry Carlsbad caves were received from a New Mexico caver/scientist. Also, guided by another skilled caver, this researcher collected samples from the wet, cold Schoharie Cave in upstate New York. <br><br> Pure strains were isolated from the cave samples and grown in various media. Liquid-liquid partition techniques were used to extract the metabolites from the cells and eliminate those of extreme high and low polarity. The remaining mid-polarity molecules are most “drug-like” because they dissolve well in the bloodstream and penetrate bi-lipid cell walls.<br><br> The extracts were titrated onto culture plates spread with fungus (Candida albicans) and bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus). A positive and a negative control were also included on each plate in order to qualify anti-microbial activity of the extract titrations. Five “hits” were detected by growth inhibition rings associated with organisms from three different locations in Schoharie Cave, and one “hit” was detected from a New Mexico strain. The hit strains have since been acquired and continue to be developed.<br><br> The positive results of this study demonstrate that antimicrobial compounds can be extracted from organisms living in extreme cave environments. Because such unique, unpolluted environments are proven repositories of molecular diversity, created by millions of years of evolution, they must be preserved if we are to someday realize their medicinal value.

INHIBITION OF BOTRYTIS CINEREA INFECTION IN FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
Sarah Elizabeth Stahl
Huntsville High School, Huntsville, Alabama, USA

Purpose: Botrytis cinerea mold infects post-harvest fruits and vegetables causing significant economic loss. Since some plants are more susceptible to infection than others, this research examines if Botrytis infection can be inhibited naturally by mixing susceptible plants with less susceptible ones. It also examines if pH effects infection.<br><br> <br><br>Procedure: First, I tested plants with known and unknown susceptibility to Botrytis: strawberry, tomato, pear, pepper, garlic, spinach, and banana. I created pulp for each; tested pulp pH using strips and meter; made phytagel, mixed with pulp and poured two Petri dishes of each, labeled and parafilmed. After the media gelled, I inoculated each dish with fungal cylinder of Botrytis; incubated at 25C; recorded growth for four days and tested pH. Second, I tested if plants resistant to Botrytis can inhibit infection in susceptible plants. I prepared strawberry and tomato pulp; and made two dishes each (control, garlic, spinach and pear). After the media gelled, I inoculated each; incubated at 25C and recorded growth. <br><br> <br><br>Data: As expected, strawberry and tomato were susceptible, and pear and pepper inhibited infection. I learned that banana is susceptible. I discovered that garlic and spinach kills Botrytis. Contrary to published literature, pH became more basic for tomato, pepper, banana and spinach. Garlic, spinach and pear all inhibited infection in strawberry and tomato. Garlic inhibited the best for both. <br><br> <br><br>Conclusions: Garlic was most effective at inhibiting infection of strawberry and tomato. Spinach was next best for strawberry and pear for tomato. Plant pH was not a factor.

THE TESTING OF ALTERNATIVE WOUND REMEDIES
Alexis Lee Krivoshik
Sturgis Brown High School, Sturgis South Dakota, United States of America

The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether or not certain historical and homeopathic remedies are actually effective in inhibiting specific bacterial strains that cause infection in wounds. Using the absorbtion method it was determined that many of these alternative treatments actually have inhibitory properties.<br><br>Inhibition was measured by the standard clearance technique, measuring the clearance from one side of the disk to the lawn. E.coli, Staphylococcus aureus, beta hemolytic Streptococcus pyogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa obtained from hospital standards were used during experimentation. Tea tree oil, Saliva, and grapefruit seed extract were effective on all of my organisms. While red wine was particularly effective on Pseudomonas and Streptococcus. Garlic was effective on Staphylococcous, Pseudomonas, and E.coli. Honey was effective on E.coli and Streptococcus, and whiskey was not effective at all possibly due to the incubation time and the rapid evaporation of the alcohol.<br><br>In conclusion, historical and homeopathic remedies can be effective inhibitors of bacterial infections that can cause serious complications and even death in patients with open wounds. The remedies tested may also lead to cheaper topical antiseptics.

TOOTHBRUSH DESIGN THE EFFECT OF TOOTHBRUSH DESIGN ON THE TYPE OF BACTERIA FOUND PRESENT.
Aschah Lodavina Williams
Tian Jin International School, Tian Jin, China 

Abstract:<br><br>The purpose of this experiment was to test and see what type of toothbrush collected the most bacteria and to see if the design of the toothbrush effected what type of bacteria would be found on the different types of toothbrushes. The hypothesis was the group of toothbrushes with least amount perturbances would collect the least amount of bacteria because there aren’t as many things that would trap the bacteria on the toothbrush rather then letting it run off. <br><br>In order to prove or disprove the hypothesis I had to cultivate bacteria in an incubator from multiple toothbrushes that I had split into eight groups ranging from group number 1-8 according to how many perturbances they had on agar Petri dishes and observe for five days. After the five days of observation are complete gather all recorded data and analyze it. <br><br>After all the analyzing the project came to its conclusion: The Hypothesis was incorrect. The group number six had the least amount of bacteria. This means that the toothbrush with neither too much nor too little amount of perterbances had the least amount of bacteria. As for the type of bacteria, it didn’t differ from group to group. The types of bacteria that were found during this experiment were consistent throughout all the designs of toothbrushes. This means that no matter what toothbrush you use you will still be putting the same bacteria in your mouth. You just have to be careful as to how much you put in your mouth. Use a good toothbrush that isn’t totally plain but isn’t to fancy either. <br><br>

Halobacterium salinarum sp. NRC-1 (Hbt.) is an extremophile that offers a window into life that is different from most life on earth. Hbt. has unique proteins and metabolisms that allow it to survive in extreme terrestrial conditions, similar to conditions in other planets. <br><br> Under different stress conditions, Hbt. uses different survival mechanisms, ultimately controlled by its DNA. To study the gene expression of Hbt., a plasmid transformation technique is developed. The transformation technique is applied to the expression of araL, a gene of ``unknown'' function (as of 2007) identified in the recently sequenced genome of Hbt. (Ng et al., 2004). The plasmid produces a green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the presence of arabinose by-products.<br><br> Using E. coli as a control, Hbt. is transformed and placed in an environment with different energy sources (LB agar, light, and arabinose). In this environment, Hbt. metabolizes arabinose through the expression of the araL gene, as indicated by the production of GFP and its green glow under ultra-violet light.<br><br> This project has shown that it is possible to monitor the gene expression of Hbt. using a plasmid transformation technique, and that experimentally the araL gene of Hbt. is expressed in the metabolism of arabinose. By using different plasmids it now becomes possible to study the different survival mechanisms of life in extreme conditions.

HUMAN CYTOMEGALOVIRUS ACTIVATES PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL 3, 4, 5 TRIPHOSPHATE KINASE TO INHIBIT APOPTOSIS IN MONOCYTES
Alexander Todd Parmater
Benton High School, Benton, Louisiana, USA

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a leading cause of disease and mortality in immunosuppressed patients (such as Acquired Immuno-Defficiency Syndrome and transplant patients and congenitally infected newborns), and is associated with cardiovascular disease in immunocompetent hosts. A cause of disease is the widespread dissemination of the virus to nearly every organ in the body and the life-long infection established. Viral dissemination and persistence are achieved through the manipulation of monocytes, which possess the capacity to migrate to most organ tissue. Monocytes naturally undergo apoptosis, systematic cell death, however, well before HCMV is able to replicate. Thus, the virus must devise a mechanism to limit the naturally occurring apoptosis in monocytes if it is to survive within the infected host. It is hypothesized that HCMV activates the anti-apoptotic phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5 triphosphate kinase [PI(3)K] pathway to promote cell survival by regulating Bcl-2 proteins in monocytes. <br><br><br>The project shows, through analysis of apoptosis in HCMV-infected monocytes compared to control monocytes, that HCMV activates PI(3)K. Infected cells treated with a PI(3)K inhibitor express greater levels of apoptosis than cells only infected with HCMV. This is supported by the absence of the Bcl-2 protein Mcl-1 in PI(3)K-inhibited monocytes. However, only up to 48 hours post infection (hpi) does HCMV utilize the protection of PI(3)K activity. In conclusion, HCMV activates PI(3)K, to promote infected monocyte survival in the infected host, which in turn allows the establishment of life-long persistence observed in infected individuals. <br><br>

DETERMINATION OF THE PRESENCE OF BACTERIA ON US PAPER CURRENCY
Adrian Godoy, Jose Rodriguez
Colegio San Ignacio de Loyola, San Juan PR, United States

Bacteria on paper currency have always been a concern for people, especially when food is being handled in restaurants by employees and people alike with poor hygienic measures. These non-hygienic measures could represent a subtle silent source of food contamination thus presenting a risk to the human health. The purpose of this experiment was to find out whether bacteria presence could be detected on US paper currency of one dollar determination, and if so, what effects could these bacteria have on our health. US paper currencies of one dollar denomination were obtained from fast food restaurants and a bank. Each dollar was swabbed. Swabs were placed inside Thyoglycollate Culture Media and incubated for 24 hours at 37° C. After the incubation period bacteria growth from Thioglycollate Culture Media was transferred to Blood Agar and MacConkey Agar Culture Media and placed in an incubator for 24 hours at 37° C. After incubation, samples were evaluated for colony growth and visual appearance. Colony growth, from selected MacConkey Agar samples, were submitted to Gram Negative Bacteria identification tests using Vitek Equipment. Tests for all samples yielded a presence of 99% Pseudomonas aeruginosa, known for being an opportunistic pathogen, and 1% percent Pseudomonas fluorescens/putida. These results should serve as a warning to immune-suppressed pations whose corporal defenses have been weakened by prior factors or diseases. These results confirmed the hypothesis of this experiment that bacteria that could pose a risk to human health are found on US paper currency of one dollar denomination.

ROLE OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS ON THE ELECTRICAL OUTPUT OF MICROBIAL FUEL CELLS USING CHLORELLA
Benjamin Lewis Ranard, Andrew Li, Eli Chen
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Alexandria, VA, USA

Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are mechanical devices that turn chemical energy into electrical energy using microbes. MFCs traditionally use high-energy electrons generated by yeast or bacteria oxidizing organic matter (non-photosynthetic processes). These electrons are captured by the anode or by chemical mediators which shuttle the electrons to the anode, generating electricity. This study first determined that Chlorella, a green alga, could be used in a MFC. Once demonstrated, this study examined whether photosynthesis contributes to the electrical output of Chlorella MFCs. <br><br> Chlorella, in addition to producing electrons during respiration, also produces high-energy electrons during photosynthesis. Therefore, we propose that Chlorella, using solar energy, would be particularly efficient in MFCs because both electron-producing processes occur simultaneously.<br><br> The MFCs were modeled on previous research. Control experiments with yeast were conducted for calibration. The ability of Chlorella to generate electricity was assessed in the presence and absence of the known photosynthetic inhibitor ammonium sulfate.<br><br> This project successfully produced a Chlorella-powered MFC. There was no significant difference in electricity generation between the two yeast controls, indicating that the two MFCs we constructed produce electricity similarly. Surprisingly, the inhibited Chlorella produced significantly more voltage than the uninhibited Chlorella, suggesting that something other than photosynthesis was affecting voltage production. We propose that the increased ion concentration in the MFC with inhibited Chlorella was the cause for this discrepancy. Our MFC can produce electricity cleanly from sunlight, and it may even have the potential to remove pollutants such as phosphates, nitrates, and pesticides from wastewater.

THE DESIGN AND EVALUATION OF AN ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT APPARATUS FOR SANITIZING BRETTANOMYCES BRUXELLENSIS IN WINE BARRELS: A THIRD YEAR STUDY
Arnaud Georges Sillis, Brian Furness Siperstein
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland Oregon, USA

An apparatus for applying ultraviolet light for use in wine barrel sanitation was constructed and built. Multiple tests were run to determine the effects of the device. The preliminary tests included: measuring changes in temperature in the barrel and ensuring there were no dark spots inside the barrel. The main evaluation of the effectiveness of the apparatus was its ability to eliminate Brettanomyces Bruxellensis yeast, the primary contaminate in winemaking. The barrel was divided into sixty-six locations for testing. For the light coverage test, small rectangles of photo paper were placed at each location and the barrel was exposed to ultraviolet for five minutes. For the temperature test, a digital thermometer was placed at each of the sixty-six locations, the light turned on, and temperature recorded every thirty seconds for 5 minutes. For the effectiveness test, blocks were inoculated with yeast, placed at each location, and exposed to the light. The samples were then taken using a core bore and a hand plane. They were cultured for 48 hours in broth and individually counted using a hemocytometer counting chamber. The temperature did not rise enough (maximum 3.1ºC) during treatment to affect the barrel by cooking the residual wine. There were no dark spots observed in the barrel. Finally, the ultraviolet light killed 97.41% to 99.57% of yeast on the surface of the barrel. Overall, the results suggest that the ultraviolet light apparatus constructed is a successful mechanism for applying this sanitation treatment to the surface of a wine barrel interior.

THE EFFECTS OF GREAT BASIN NATIVE PLANTS ON GRAM-POSITIVE AND GRAM-NEGATIVE BACTERIA
Rubina Anna Belen Dann, Bethany Pete
Owyhee Combined School, Owyhee, NV, USA

Native Americans have used plants as healing remedies for centuries. Knowledge of what to use and when to use it has been passed down through generations. Both of our families use healing plants that appear to work against various illnesses. We were interested in the actual properties that these plants have, so we decided to scientifically test the effects of healing plants on bacteria.<br><br> First, we asked local Shoshone/Paiute elders about the plants they generally use for healing purposes, how to use them, and where to find them. With the information we gathered on healing plants, we chose three commonly used plants for our experiments: buhddabah (Wild Peony), doza (Wild Parsley), and Mormon tea. <br><br> When we previously experimented with these plants, we compared the effects of the plants with the effects that commonly prescribed antibiotics have on bacteria (previous research in 2004/2005). We used Gram-negative bacteria that we obtained from the Owyhee Community Health Facility, and found that none of the plants seemed to inhibit the growth of these bacteria. <br><br> It was then that it was suggested that we use Gram-positive bacteria. We decided to continue our research, this time focusing only on the native plants and eliminating the antibiotics from our experiments (this year’s research). We tested the plants on a variety of bacteria - beginning with Gram-positive bacteria - and we are very excited about the promising results of doza, one of the three native plants that we used in our experiments.<br><br>

THE USE OF BACILLUS THURINGIENSIS IN FIGHTING MOSQUITO- BORNE DISEASES
Moshira Ashraf Abd El Meguid, Mariam Ashraf Abd El Meguid
Dar El Tarbiah American School, Zamalek, Cairo, Egypt

Human race has been suffering along the ages several highly lethal diseases .By tracing the source of these diseases it was found that one of the main source of these diseases were mosquitoes causing several epidemics .Such diseases are like malaria,West Nile fever, dengue fever,….etc.<br><br> Several ways were used to eradicate and control mosquitoes .The development of synthetic pesticides since 1940 coupled with the improvement in chemical application technology, dramatically increased the potential for insect pest control. Pests that had been naturally controlled by predators and parasites began to cause significant damages and became resistant to chemical pesticides. Moreover, chemical pesticides have become costly and imposed great hazards to the environment and all living organisms.<br><br> An alternative tool for effective control of pests is the use of Bacillus thuringiensis. Using Bacillus thuringiensis directly on the mosquitoe’s swamp is not efficient due to ultra violet rays which break down the Bt gene toxin.<br><br> So we isolated cry11Aa from Bt and cloned it in TA cloning vector and sub cloned in pet30a as expression vector .The purified protein gave a very good mortality against mosquito larvae concentration 224 ng/ml. this biopesticide is environmentally friendly and not harmful for the ecosystem and it does not sediment and is not affected by the ultra violet radiations. <br><br>

BRANDED VS. GENERIC ANTIBIOTICS: WHICH BATTLES BACTERIA THE BEST?
Amanda Lynn Jundt, Amber Lee Kolb
Central High School, Aberdeen, SD

The purpose of our experiment was to determine whether generic antibiotics work as well as their branded forms.<br><br>Four generic and four branded antibiotics were put into solution and were then made into three different dilutions. A sterile disc was soaked in each of the solutions and a branded form and generic form were put on a TSA plate that had Staphylococcus epidermidis spread on it. The bacteria were allowed to grow for 24 hours and then the zones of inhibition around the discs were measured. The zones around the generic-soaked discs were compared to the zones around the branded-soaked discs. As an extension to our project, a solution containing hydrochloric acid and pepsin was added to the antibiotic solutions of one of the dilutions. Similar tests were run and compared to the previous data of the same dilutions.<br><br>Before the HCL/pepsin solution was added, the generic antibiotics worked as effectively as their branded forms. There was no significant difference for the 1/10 dilution (p-value=0.555), the 1/100 dilution (p-value=0.913) and the 1/1000 dilution (p-value=0.399). After adding the HCL/pepsin solution, there was a significant (p-value=0.000) difference between the effectiveness of the original solution of antibiotics and the modified solutions. We failed to reject our null hypothesis and therefore are able to conclude that generic antibiotics work as effectively as their branded forms.

YOU MAY BE LIFTING MORE THAN JUST WEIGHTS
James Tyler Dunn, Jack Courtney
Hilton Head High School, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, USA

The purpose of this project was to test for Staphylococcus (staph) on our school’s weight room equipment. <br><br>Equipment was swabbed and plated on Tryptic Soy (TSA) and Mannitol Salt Agars (MSA). TSA was the basic growth medium for observation of bacteria colony number and morphology. MSA was used to isolate pathogenic staph. The salt concentration of this medium inhibits most other organisms. Pathogenic staph grown on this agar produces acid which turns the pH indicator from red to yellow. Although non-pathogenic strains of staph grow on MSA, these bacteria don’t produce acid or an agar color change.<br><br>Most bacterial growth was obvious within 24 hours. The total bacterial count on TSA plates was the highest for the leg press foot rest. A high bacterial count was expected from this sample because it’s where people put their feet. It served as the experiment's positive control. The arm lift had the highest count of staph colonies on the MSA plates, but most of this was non-pathogenic (no color change). The dumbbell had the highest number of possible pathogenic staph colonies. <br><br>Most equipment tested positive for staph. There were only three devices that didn’t yield possible pathogenic staph. It is troubling the dumbbell had the highest number of potentially pathogenic staph because it was rusty, had a lot of rough edges, and someone could easily get an infected wound from a scratch. This research shows the possible need for disinfectant procedures for exercise equipment in school weight rooms. <br><br>

Oak Ridge High School, Oak Ridge, TN, USA

The purpose of this investigation was to develop a computational tool to link biochemical processes and phenotypic traits of organisms to address problems in the efficient development of biofuels. This project presents a novel methodology for using comparative network analysis to link key biochemical processes with phenotypic traits. The link between biochemical processes and phenotypic traits is indisputable, but not well understood. <br><br>We made specific assumptions about this link, and developed a computational methodology that was validated against a well-studied trait. <br><br>We made several assumptions regarding the link: 1) For a given phenotypic trait, there is a set of key genes related to this trait that are evolutionarily conserved across multiple genomes; 2) For a given trait, there is a set of key metabolic, regulatory and signaling pathways enriched by those evolutionarily conserved genes and 3) The topology of a biochemical pathway alters organismal phenotypic functions; it is evolutionarily conserved across genomes with similar phenotypic traits. <br><br>Two groups of bacterial genomes were assembled – 14 anaerobes, and 14 aerobes. Each organism’s entire genome was compared to others in a BLAST database . Information was assembled into a 28-partite graph with each node signifying a gene; adjacent nodes were considered orthologous. Dense subgraphs, denoting conserved genes, were noted. Biochemical pathways enriched by these conserved genes were determined statistically. Finally, the enriched pathways were compared topologically against known pathways, and each other, to quantify similarity. Genes and pathways identified were validated by a literature search, confirming the validity of our novel method.<br><br>

A STUDY OF LATENCY ASSOCIATED NUCLEAR ANTIGEN AND CELLULAR APOPTOSIS THROUGH P21 EXPRESSION
Thomai Gastopoulos, Evangelia Athanasoula
Central High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States

This project was conducted to determine if the Latency Associated Nuclear Antigen (LANA), a latent gene expressed by Kaposi's Sarcoma Herpes Virus (KSHV), inhibits the expression of the p21 tumor suppressor gene and which pathway it takes to down regulate p21. Using information obtained from research, it was shown that LANA is an oncogenic protein. Thus, it was hypothesized that LANA inactivates p21, specifically through the p53 pathway. <br><br> Two cell lines were used: GW33, which contained ATR and p53, a tumor suppressor gene, and GK41, which did not contain ATR or p53. These cells were used as a control (no LANA) or were transvected with LANA. Luciferase Assay was performed to determine the difference in the expression of the p21 gene in the cells that contained LANA and did not contain LANA. During Luciferase Assay, the luciferase enzyme, which binds to p21, is detected.<br><br> The results of the Luciferase Assay showed that there was a decrease in p21 expression in LANA positive cells. Difference in the expression of p21 was greater in cell lines that contained p53. Through these results, it is concluded that LANA inhibits p21 through the p53 pathway. Immunofluorescence and Western Blots were also conducted to show that LANA inhibits the ability of p21 to express proteins. A Polmerase Chain Reaction was performed to confirm changes in p21 expression that were detected during Luciferase Assay. Data obtained from these experiments determined how LANA causes cancer in Kaposi's Sarcoma patients. <br><br>

Presence of Bacterial Communities in Marble Mines at Juana Diaz , Puerto Rico.<br><br><br> A total of eleven caves have been accounted for in the area composed of Majagual Village, La Cueva location and Naranjo location. Those caves constitute a priceless natural resource which is being jeopardized by marble mining activities. El Cerro Cuevas was of particular interest; due to the fact that two universities were doing research in caves located there. Up to now, research on this location has been preliminary and has not included a microbiology assessment. For the present research four locations at the vicinity of the mine were randomly selected. These were Stone Forest, Naranjo Cave, Lucero Cave and Majagual Village. Petri dishes were exposed to the environment for a total of twenty five minutes. These were sealed and transported to the laboratory where samples were incubated to 27° C for a period that ranged between 24 and 48 hours. Results indicated a great microbial diversity on all sampled locations. The identification of endospores strongly suggested the high probability of the presence of pathogenic bacteria. The highest proportion of endospore-containing bacilli was identified at Stone Forest which was the nearest location to the marble mines of all four sampling locations. Cocci and bacilli, mostly Gram positive ones, were also identified in samples in all four locations. The research demonstrated the pernicious nature of marble mining on both, human population and the environment, which is considered an extreme environment. This research is of vital importance to help prevent future and further contamination of ecosystems and the biodiversity that comprises those ecosystems.<br><br> <br><br>

The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate the effectiveness of rinsing lettuce and spinach in regard to Escherichia coli contamination. This could be important for the consumers of said vegetables, especially considering the recent outbreak of Escherichia contamination of spinach. We hypothesized that it would be possible to rinse the Escherichia coli from both spinach and lettuce. To determine the effectiveness of rinsing, we introduced a lab strain of Escherichia coli to the experimental group of each vegetable after pre-rinsing. Fifty milliliters of sterile water was added to all flasks containing vegetables and these were placed in a shaker for five minutes. This is comparable to vigorous rinsing by consumers. The rinse water was replaced with sterile water, and the vegetables were rinsed again using the same method. This water was drained and used to perform dilutions for plating. After the plates were allowed to culture overnight, colony forming units per milliliter were calculated. Our results indicated that Escherichia coli can be effectively rinsed from both lettuce and spinach.

The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether lysozyme protein crystals grown in a magnetic field would have a positive bactericidal effect on gram-negative Neisseria subflava. It was hypothesized that the growth of lysozyme crystals in an electromagnetic field may alter the structure of the crystal rendering it more receptive to the phospholipid and lipopolysaccharide outer membrane layer of the gram-negative bacteria allowing it to move through the outer membrane and attack the peptidoglycan layer.<br><br>Cultures of Neisseria subflava were grown for this experiment by plating re-hydrated bacteria purchased through a reputable biological supply house onto plates containing BHI agar (also purchased through a reputable biological supply house). The sterile technique was used in plating the bacteria. Lysozyme purchased from a chemical supply house was added to a sodium acetate buffer and allowed to dissolve undisturbed in two separate dishes. Sodium chloride was then added to each dish. One dish was placed in a magnetic field and the other was not. Once crystallization had occurred the lysozyme crystals were placed by methods, which included placement of sterile discs saturated in a solution made by dissolution of .1g lysozyme crystals into 8ml of distilled H2O onto each quadrant of 10 of the N. subflava plates and placement of .01g samples of lysozyme crystals directly on each of the quadrants of 10 of the plates. The plates were then examined after 72 hours and diameters of affected areas were measured. Additionally, two dishes of buffer and sodium chloride (minus lysozyme) were also allowed to crystallize inside and outside of the magnetic field and crystals were placed onto the N. subflava utilizing the same methods as those with lysozyme. These plates were also examined after 72 hours and diameters of inhibition zones were measured in cm. All cultures were then destroyed and autoclaved before disposal.<br><br>The average inhibition zone diameter of lysozyme grown inside the magnetic field was .97cm for direct application and .82cm for saturated disc application, while for lysozyme grown outside the magnetic field the average zone diameters were .74cm and .52cm respectively. This proved to be a 76.3% increase in bactericidal activity for the direct application and a 63.4% increase for the saturated disc application. Lysozyme grown inside the magnetic field was 95% efficient with the direct and saturated disc applications, while lysozyme grown outside the field was 82.5% efficient using direct contact application and 62.5% efficient with the saturated disc application. Lysozyme grown inside a magnetic field proved to have a more positive bactericidal effect on gram-negative N. subflava<br><br>

THE NEW FOOD FIGHT: REDUCING PATHOGENIC LOAD ON FRESH PRODUCE TO ELIMINATE THE RISK OF POTENTIALLY LETHAL FOOD-BORNE ILLNESS CAUSED BY BACTERIAL CONTAMINATION
Jeremy Chenghow Hsiang
Niceville High School, Niceville, FL

Salad is an integral part of American diet. While we enjoy eating salad, we are at risk of food-borne illnesses. Each year we have repeatedly heard breaking news regarding bacteria contamination of prewashed greens. Most of them are associated with contamination of E. coli, including the virulent strand causing hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Produce contamination raises great health and economic problems, and the issues are not yet resolved.<br><br>In this study, the student researcher tested various solutions composed of water, salt, and vinegar, along with commercially available produce cleaner, on five different fresh produce including lettuce, tomatoes, strawberries, celery, and spinach. <br><br>Spinach contained the largest amount and variety of bacteria of the produce tested. There was no difference of bacteria load in prewashed bagged spinach and unwashed spinach.<br><br>Of the various solutions tested, vinegar was most effective. It inhibited more than 99.9% of the bacteria on spinach up to 1:3 dilutions. It did not change the look or texture of the produce. There was no significant difference in terms of bacteria inhibition among white distilled, rice, and balsamic vinegars. There was no difference when fresh produce was soaked in vinegar solution for five minutes vs. ten minutes.<br><br> <br><br>In conclusion, soaking fresh produce with white distilled vinegar (inexpensive: cost only 1.5 cents per fluid ounce) with 1:3 dilution for 5 minutes can inhibit more than 99.9% of the bacteria. It is feasible, and potentially life-saving, to prevent food-borne diseases from a consumer's point-of-view.

HYDROGEN PEROXIDE & TRICLOSAN: NEW ANTIMICROBIALS FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF ESCHERICHIA COLI 0157:H7
Arielle Elizabeth Glawe
New Ulm Cathedral High School, New Ulm, MN

October 12, 2006, about 199 people were infected with Escherichia Coli 0157:H7 in 26 states. Could this have been prevented by produce manufacturers? The answer is yes, it could have been. This project entails an in depth analysis of Escherichia Coli 0157:H7 inoculated with assorted antimicrobials. Do the ingredients and form of antimicrobials used contribute to the effectiveness of the antimicrobial action?<br><br> One host strand of Escherichia Coli 0157:H7 was plated amongst thirty-six Petri plates. Each plate had two filter paper discs. The discs of one plate were dosed with .03 ml of one antibacterial. The colonies were then allowed to grow over night in an incubator. Measurements of the zone of inhibition were taken along with the pH levels for each antibacterial.<br><br> After comparing the active ingredients with the zone of inhibition measurements it was found that the chemicals of Triclosan and Hydrogen Peroxide had the greatest effect on the Escherichia Coli 0157:H7. <br><br> Triclosan is a great antimicrobial, but if produce withholds the chemical and a person consumes it, a build up of the chemical can cause illness. Electrochemically activated water was also used as an antibacterial and turned out to have little to no results. This may have been caused by the concentration of free radical chlorine gas. Hydrogen Peroxide, if used with the correct concentration, can be used by manufacturers to wash and water their produce. From this experiment manufacturers across the country can now assemble FDA and consumer approved produce with a new antimicrobial, Hydrogen Peroxide.

ISOLATING HONEY CHEMICAL CONSTITUENTS RESPONSIBLE FOR ANTI-MICROBIAL PROPERTIES
Nyssa Catherine Boyd
Eastern High School, Pekin, IN

The purpose of this project was to determine whether the anti-microbial compound in honey could be isolated using chromatography resins, and if so, whether it could be identified via high pressure liquid chromatography. It was hypothesized that the anti-microbial components in honey could be isolated from the sugars using chromatography resins. For initial testing, new, raw honey was compared to older honeys from the same source to determine if it would be just as effective using a disk diffusion technique. The newest honey had the greatest average zone of inhibition, but was statistically shown to have an effect equal to that of the older honeys. After determining that the newest honey was indeed as effective as the honey from previous years, sorbent extraction was used with 10 different chromatography resins to attempt to extract unidentified antimicrobial substances from honey. These extracts were then tested for their antimicrobial properties using the same disk diffusion technique. The extracts which showed some inhibition were Isolute C4 (Basic), Isolute C8 (EC) (Basic), Isolute C8 (Basic), and Isolute PH (Basic). All four had a high pH and all left a chalky residue behind. It is suggested that the hypothesis is supported. Testing is not completed at this time; extracts found to have anti-microbial properties will be analyzed using a chromatograph. Identification of chromatography peaks will be attempted using standard reference numbers.

SYNERGISTICALLY REVERSING OXACILLIN-RESISTANCE IN MRSA BY INHIBITING MECA GENE PRODUCT (PBP2A)
Maryam Khadijah Mohammed
Niceville High School, Niceville, FL

Antibiotic resistance is an ever-growing problem and presents a formidable challenge to health-care providers worldwide. In the USA alone, 1.4 million patients acquire nosocomial antibiotic resistant infections annually, of which 90,000 are fatal. One particular strain of antibiotic-resistant S. aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), presents a particular challenge, as it is resistant to not only the beta-lactam antibiotics, but many other widely-used groups as well. In 2005, deaths from MRSA surpassed those from HIV/AIDS in the USA. Currently, there are few solutions to this problem because of MRSA’s broad-spectrum resistance. The use of more potent antibiotics, such as vancomycin, has even led to the outbreak of vancomycin-resistant S. aureus. Thus, there exists a need to develop a more effective and safe treatment for MRSA infections. This was the goal of this study.<br><br> Four natural antioxidants [eucalyptus oil (EO), grape seed extract (GSE), noni juice (NJ) and tea tree oil (TTO)] were tested for synergism with oxacillin against MRSA and inhibition of Penicillin Binding Protein 2a (PBP2a), a product of the mecA gene of MRSA. They were tested for synergism by a modified Kirby-Bauer technique where oxacillin E-Test strips are placed in Mueller-Hinton agar petri dishes containing sub-inhibitory concentrations of the test agents. Effect on PBP2a was tested by Latex Agglutination assay. A comparison was done between the MICs of oxacillin against MRSA with and without the natural antioxidants. MSSA (methicillin-sensitive S. aureus) was used as the control organism. <br><br> The findings of this investigation are significant. Three of the four natural antioxidants, (EO, GSE, and TTO) worked synergistically with oxacillin to inhibit MRSA. Two of the agents (TTO and GSE) did so by inhibiting PBP2a. The most effective of these substances was TTO. A mere concentration of 1.25 µL/mL TTO reduced the MIC of oxacillin from 8 µL/mL to 0.5 µL/mL (a 16 fold reduction in MIC) by inhibiting PBP2a. These findings have the potential to be used in developing treatments for MRSA infections, thereby reversing the antibiotic resistance of MRSA and bringing back the glory days of the first miracle drugs – the penicillin class of antibiotics.

The ability of pathogenic microorganisms, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, to sequester iron from their hosts has been implicated as a factor in their virulence. Consequently, serum ferritin levels are directly related to the amount of iron stored in the body. The focus of this study was to measure the growth rate of Mycobacterium smegmatis (as a model for Mycobacterium tuberculosis) in comparison to increasing ferritin levels. Concentrations of ferritin added media ranging from 5ng to 400ng were inoculated and growth was monitored. It was found that although growth did not increase as ferritin amounts increased, the general growth pattern was altered. In increased amounts of ferritin, growth was more exponential in nature whereas in lower concentrations, growth was exponential for some time followed by a long period of linear growth and slow decline. However, a significant difference was found to exist between growth aided by ferritin and growth lacking ferritin. These results implicate that although ferritin is integral for growth, a difference in growth pattern exists depending on ferritin concentration. This variation may play a role in latency experienced during many cases of Tuberculosis infection and/or may show varied infection patterns in women and anemic individuals as compared to men or those with excessive iron.

ARG! WHAT’S IN YOUR WATER?: ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANT GENES (ARG) IN HOT SPRINGS WATER SUPPLIES
Madhav Keval Shroff
The Arkansas School for Mathematics, Sciences, and the Arts, Hot Springs, AR

With the overuse of antibiotics, a new breed of pathogens has developed that contains antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs), a major problem throughout the world. Scientists have proposed that bacteria either switch to an “SOS response” that allows them to mutate more frequently in a challenging environment or they share ARGs with each other via horizontal gene transfer (HGT). The current experiment was designed to examine if ARGs for the antibiotics tetracycline and sulfonamide are present in water samples from Whittington and Hot Springs Creeks, Lake Hamilton, and the local tap water. Both extracted (DNA from bacteria) and bulk water (DNA from extracellular, liquid environment) samples were analyzed. It is hypothesized that ARGs for sulfonamide and tetracycline will be identified in some of the water sources. <br><br>Methods to test the stated hypothesis included sample collection, DNA extraction, DNA amplification using primer pairs for both ARGs as part of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and agarose gel electrophoresis which was used to visualize the resulting DNA products. While free-floating ARG DNA was found only in early creek samples, bacterial ARG DNA was found within every tested sample. The presence of ARGs in every water sample tested, including tap water, was alarming because ARGs are potentially dangerous to human health. Without antibiotics, we have few other defenses against bacterial infections. Since ARGs are present in our water supply, we must assume they are fairly ubiquitous in our environment.

THE CONSTRUCTION AND SCREENING OF A METAGENOMIC SOIL DNA LIBRARY
Devavrata Joshi
Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School, Elstree, Hertfordshire, UNITED KINGDOM

Most of the 4-6 x 10^30 prokaryote cells on Earth are thought to exist in soil, oceanic or subsurface environments. Soil is therefore one of the most microbially diverse environments and due to the fact that less than 1.0% of soil bacteria can be cultured using standard laboratory methods, soil remains an untapped resource for biologically important molecules. <br><br>The construction and screening of clone libraries has been used to discover such biomolecules and unearth the various roles of microbial communities in soil. It is estimated that DNA extracted from 1g of field soil can contain up to 18,000 genomes, leaving extensive scope for research. <br><br>Using DNA extracted from a local soil sample, a clone library was created and screened to look for the presence of expressed genes. However, due to the time constraints of the project only limited screening for amylases, proteases or antibiotic resistance could take place. Results from the screening process were largely inconclusive but the library created formed the basis for alternative avenues of research. <br><br>Further analysis involved the sequencing of the DNA in order to search for homogeneity with existing genomes or find new sequences which could be analysed to find hypothetical genes. Prior to sequencing, DNA fragments (inserts) were isolated from the library using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit. Subsequent analysis showed that up to 35% of the inserts analysed did not bear any significant resemblance to previously known sequences thus offering the possibility of discovery of novel DNA genes.

AIR-BORNE PATHOGENS, PHASE III
Deidre Sue Daniel
Gustine High School, Gustine, TX

My last years projects have found that disinfectant sprays that contain ethanol are the most effective at killing air-borne pathogens. This year I isolated bacteria growth with Nutrient agar Petri dishes and discovered the harmful and non harmful bacteria growing in the air at my school. I set out two a nutrient agar plate for six hours in two different high school classrooms, two separate middle school classrooms and two separate elementary classrooms. I repeated this experiment three different times. These are my original colonies from which I isolated each colony to find my pure colony. Once I collected the bacteria, I sealed the agar plates and placed them into an incubator for twenty – four hours, then forty eight hours to allow the bacteria time to advance. I observed the bacteria and identified the colonies to find what type of bacteria was growing. I isolated each colony in a separate nutrient agar plate. Then, I prepared a hydrogen peroxide test to distinguish that the bacteria degraded the hydrogen peroxide. I used crystal violet and iodine to find whether the bacteria was Gram – or Gram +. My total bacteria analysis found that 26% of the bacteria degraded the hydrogen peroxide, 4% of the bacteria were Gram -and 70 % of the bacteria were Gram+. To further test for Staphylococus, I used blood agar plates to isolate the bacteria because Staphylococus aureus thieves on blood. It will beta hemolyze the blood agar. I have found that there is more beneficial bacteria growing in the air that are exercising our immune system to fight off harm full bacteria. By using air sanitizer, you are killing off beneficial bacteria along with potentially harmful bacteria, but for only twenty second until the bacteria replenishes.

THE JOURNEY TO IDENTIFY ANTIBIOTIC COMPOUNDS IN NEW MEXICO LICHENS
Rebecca Renee Alexander
Grants High School, Grants, NM

The purpose of research this year is to determine which lichen fraction/fractions from samples 8 and 9 used in previous work can be separated, purified, retested and identified to better understand its potential as an antibiotic. The hypothesis is to identify specific compounds producing inhibition of bacteria with an effort to determine if the compounds are known antibiotics or something new.<br><br> UPLC (Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography) is being used to produce chromatograms of the Lichen extracts from an improved extraction technique. Q-TOF Mass Spec analysis has provided molecular weight data on aqueous PBS and acetone extracts of the samples. Fractionated samples were collected from Chromatography runs for bioassays on Bacillus cereus and E. coli the PBS extract fractions in a series of wells obtained results close to the (+) controls ampicillin and kanamycin. The disc diffusion method using extracts produced has also shown positive results for inhibition of Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus salivaris, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and E. coli.<br><br> Genetic Analysis of the DNA extracted from each of the samples being researched was done in order to determine the species of fungus producing these compounds. DNA has been extracted, electrophoresed, and PCR using fungal primers has been carried out. Three samples of the PCR products have been sequenced and research using the NCBI Data Base showed a 95% match of 501/525 base sequence from lichen sample #8 with five species of Usnea while sample #9 showed a 98/99% match of DNA sequence from (721/727 & 722/727) with two species of Melanelia.

FORMATION AND GRAM STAIN IDENTIFICATION OF A WATER-PURIFYING BIOLOGICAL LAYER
John William O'Shea
Bagley Junior/Senior High School, Bagley, MN

This project was designed to examine the formation, purifying properties, and gram-stain identity of the biological layer in a bio-sand water filter. A biological layer (called a bio-cap) grows on the surface of the sand layers in the filter and eliminates virtually all contaminants from drinking water.<br><br> Based on research, my hypothesis was that the bio-cap would take between one and three weeks to be fully formed and functional. The water run through the filter each day was contaminated with E. coli bacteria, and it was also my hypothesis that the bio-cap formed should therefore contain this type of bacteria. Gram stain tests should show all areas of the bio-cap with gram negative (pink) bacilli (rod-shaped) bacteria.<br><br> The bio-cap in the filter took four weeks to fully form. The filtered water did not, however, completely meet drinking water standards for E. coli until after seven weeks of formation. Ten areas of the bio-cap were cultured and incubated for 24 hours, at which time gram staining tests were conducted. Of the ten areas, only four actually contained gram-negative bacilli. Nine of the areas contained gram-positive bacilli.<br><br> My hypotheses were not supported by my experiments. The bio-cap formed in three weeks less time than it took for it to be fully functional, and most of the bio-cap did not contain gram-negative bacilli. To expand on this project, I intend to identify and conduct sensitivity tests on the bacteria that makes up the bio-cap.

THE HUMAN CYTOMEGALOVIRUS: INVESTIGATING PP71
Kathryn Lynn Williams
Ocean Lakes High School Mathematics and Science Academy, Virginia Beach, VA

The Human Cytomegalovirus infects fifty to eighty percent of the population, causing immunosuppressed individuals, babies, and burn victims to contract diseases such as CMV pneumonia, CMV retinitis, and dementia. Protein pp71 is central to HCMV, activating viral genome and helping to make new viruses. When pp71 moves from the nucleus to the Golgi (taking over the cell), phosphorylation occurs. The effect of phosphorylation on the function of amino acids was investigated in an attempt to understand HCMV so that a drug can be created to stop the disease. <br><br>To do so, oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to put a missense mutation in pp71 plasmids. PCR amplified them and Dpn1 digestion destroyed the original methylated plasmid. The plasmids were transformed into bacteria and then went through DNA purification. The plasmids were transfected into Epithelial and Fibroblast cells. A western blot showed protein activity, a Luciferase reaction showed transcriptional activity, and immunofluorescence slides showed the location of pp71 in the cell. It was discovered that Serine at position 20 has low protein levels and may therefore be important for the stability of the protein. A correlation was found between transcriptional activity and immunofluorescence slide formations (globule and punctuate nuclear). This will lead to further research to determine if pp71 is binding to itself and if phosphorylation is regulating this.

THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT CUTTING METHODS AND GARLIC TYPES ON THE GROWTH OF ESCHERICHIA COLI IN LIQUID CULTURE AND THE NATURAL MICROBIOTA IN GROUND BEEF
Rebekah Anne Meller
Pettisville Local Schools, Pettisville, OH

Garlic is considered a phytochemical and with the breakdown of cellular structures an antimicrobial component, allicin, is produced. The primary objective of this study was to determine the impact of different types of garlic and cutting methods on the growth of E. coli K12 and E. coli O157:H7. The secondary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of different types of diced garlic on the natural microbiota of ground beef. Water extracts (1 mL) of sliced, diced, pureed, and whole garlic (elephant, generic, organic, or bulk organic) were added to two mL Trypticase Soy Broth inoculated with Escherichia coli K12 or O157:H7 (non-pathogenic). Samples incubated at 37C and bacterial growth was measured as change in optical density (600 nm) at regular intervals for 18 hours. Diced organic, generic, and elephant garlic were added to ground beef at two levels (1% or 10% (w/w)) and stored at 4C. During the 16 day storage period, samples were homogenized, serially diluted (in .01% peptone water), and spread plated on Trypticase Soy Agar. Colonies were enumerated after incubation (25C, 48hrs). Elephant had the greatest affect on the E. coli followed by bulk organic then generic and organic respectively at 16 hours. The preparation types that had the greatest affects were sliced and diced then pureed. Whole cloves didn't have an affect. For the second experiment the concentration differences weren't significant. Generic and elephant garlic had a significant affect on the ground beef microbiota. Overall garlic doesn't have an extended affect on refrigerated ground beef.

THE EFFECT OF THE S2 PYOCIN ON THE GROWTH AND BIOFILM FORMATION OF PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA
Lindsey Elizabeth Hastings
duPont Manual High School, Louisville, KY

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative bacterium that has a highly mutable genome. As a result, it has become resistant to many types of antibiotics typically used to treat infections in cystic fibrosis patients. A possible alternative to antibiotic treatment is the use of pyocins, produced by P. aeruginosa as an anti-competitor toxin, to treat the biofilms often found in vivo in cystic fibrosis patients. It was hypothesized that the introduction of the S2 pyocin to P. aeruginosa biofilms would result in less biofilm growth and development than in the control. The S2 pyocin was produced by applying oxidative stress and iron starvation to several P. aeruginosa colonies. The pyocins were then purified and tested against 16-hour biofilms grown at 37oC and 8-hour biofilms grown at 50oC. The biofilms were visualized using dye and microscope assay. ComStat and MatLab were used to do the data analysis and statistical analysis. It was found that foreign S2 pyocins greatly reduce biofilm formation and cause substantial cell death in P. aeruginosa biofilms.

SOME LIKE IT HOT: FUSELLOVIRUSES OF THE HYPERTHERMOPHILIC ARCHEON SULFOLOBUS SOLFATARICUS
Annika Marie Sullivan
Grant High School, Portland, OR

Spindle-shaped viruses (SSVs), which infect the host archeon Sulfolobus solfataricus, thrive in extreme environments of high temperature and high acidity. While spindle-shaped viruses have recently been isolated from a single hot spring at Lassen Volcanic National Park, their exact biogeographical distribution is unknown. I collected 11 soil samples from hot springs (80C, pH 3), and a soil and a water sample from Boiling Springs Lake (50C, pH 4) at Lassen Volcanic National Park. In the laboratory, I incubated the 11 hot spring samples: 8 showed positive growth of Sulfolobus. I then extracted DNA from these 8 hot spring soil samples using a DNA extraction kit. I also extracted the DNA from the soil and water Boiling Springs Lake samples. Using polymerase chain reaction, I amplified SSV genes, and 16S rRNA genes (indicating the presence of archaea), from Boiling Springs Lake with SSV and 16S rRNA specific primers. I then cloned the desired SSV genes and 16S rRNA genes in E. coli bacteria. I am in the process of sequencing these genes using Big-Dye Terminator Sequencing. Both SSV DNA and 16S rRNA were present in the Boiling Springs Lake water and soil samples. None of the hot spring samples tested positive for SSV DNA or 16S rRNA. This is the first discovery of SSV DNA in Boiling Springs Lake at Lassen Volcanic National Park.

RATIONAL DESIGN OF NOVEL ANTI-HIV PEPTIDES CONTAINING MULTI-FUNCTIONAL DOMAINS
Na Xue
Midwood High School at Brooklyn College, Brooklyn, NY

HIV-1 contains an important protein structure in its transmembrane, gp41, which enables viral entry into the target cell by changing conformation and binding to the cell membrane. Although the peptidic anti-HIV drug T20 (known as enfuvirtide or Fuzeon) and anti-HIV peptide C34 both have a heptad repeat (HR) sequence and are derived from the gp41 CHR region, T20 contains a critical lipid-binding domain (LBD) at its C-terminus to interact with the cell membrane, whereas C34 has a pocket-binding domain (PBD) at its N-terminus that stops gp41 from changing conformation. In this study, peptides were designed that contain multiple copies of 1) 4-3 heptad repeat sequence (5HR), 2) HR sequence plus either LBD (4HR-LBD) or PBD (PBD-4HR), or 3) both (PBD-3HR-LBD), to compare their inhibitory activity and biophysical properties. Findings show that the 5HR peptide exhibited low anti-HIV-1 activity, while the addition of LBD or PBD to the HR peptide resulted in significant increase of activity. Furthermore, the addition of both PBD and LBD led to further improvement of the inhibitory activity against HIV-1 infection. These results suggest that peptides containing PBD form a stable six-helix bundle with the N-peptide N46 and effectively block the gp41 core formation, while the peptides containing LBD interact with the lipid vesicles. Results also suggest that although the HR sequences are essential for the basic structure of the antiviral peptides, the functional domains are required for these peptides to specifically interact with target sites for maximum anti-HIV activity.

THE EFFECT OF UV-C IRRADIATION ON THE GROWTH AND SURVIVAL OF BACILLUS SUBTILIS ENDOSPORES AND VEGETATIVE CELLS: LIMITATIONS IMPOSED ON PANSPERMIA BY SOLAR RADIATION
Parker Denys Vascik
Roanoke Valley Governor's School/ Cave Spring, Roanoke, VA

Due to the controversial nature of the panspermia theory and its application to modern astrobiology, this project was designed to evaluate the susceptibility of bacteria to solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The hypothesis was proposed that if Bacillus subtilis endospores and vegetative cells are exposed to UV-C radiation, then the vegetative cells will survive shorter periods of irradiation more efficiently by developing radio-resistance while the endospores survive extended exposures more adeptly. This investigation aimed to assess the overall effect of UV irradiation similar to that of space on vegetative cells and bacterial endospores and apply the knowledge gained to the panspermia theory.<br><br> This experiment found that both B. subtilis spores and vegetative cells are able to survive radiation doses up to 120 minutes of direct UV-C. Exposure to 15 minutes of radiation leads to an immediate drop in both vegetative cell and endospore viability by two orders of magnitude. Further exposure up to 120 minutes reduces viability in vegetative cells by an additional factor of 700 while only reducing endospore viability by a factor of 27. This pattern of reduction in cellular viability coupled with an extrapolation of exponential curves fit to each set of data shows that vegetative cells survive shorter periods of radiation more adeptly while endospores tolerate extended exposures; this pattern supports the hypothesis. Repeated exposures to radiation prompted both bacterial structures to adapt and develop radio-resistance. These finding suggest that bacterial cells posses the ability to adapt to interstellar radiation and could survive travel as described by panspermia.

IDENTIFICATION OF THREE NEW TARGET GENES FOR MALARIA VACCINE DEVELOPMENT BY DIFFERENTIAL GENE EXPRESSION PROFILING
Benjamin Uri Hoffman
Georgetown Day School, Washington, DC

Radiation attenuated Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites are the only immunogens that reproducibly protect the majority of human recipients against malaria. Irradiation prevents sporozoites from completing development in hepatocytes. The effects of irradiation on overall sporozoite gene expression, mechanism of attenuation, and parasite proteins that are the targets of protective immunity are unknown. To gain insight into these unknowns, transcript profiles of irradiated (150 Gy) and non-irradiated P. falciparum sporozoites were compared. Twenty 70-nucleotide oligo-arrays representing the complete P. falciparum genome (7,256 parasite oligo probes) were separately hybridized with cDNA obtained from 3 different preparations of irradiated and non-irradiated sporozoites. From these twenty, 8 arrays were chosen for further analysis based on correlation analyses (r^2 > 0.80) between technical replicates. For each array studied, differentially regulated genes were selected based on, 1) fold change (>1.5 in either direction) and 2) signal quality from each spot (rQuality>0.5). By this method, 60-80 upregulated and 50-150 downregulated genes were found in common among array samples within an experimental batch. Shared responders from the 3 experimental batches were then compared to determine which genes were affected by irradiation in all 8 arrays. Four sequences derived from 3 genes (redox protein-PFC0165w, membrane protein-PFI1820w, and lipid metabolism protein-MAL8P1.37) and an unknown open reading frame were identified. Because of the stringency of the selection methodology, there is confidence in the findings, and the three identified genes are being evaluated for their capacity to play a role in creating an effective genetically attenuated or subunit recombinant malaria vaccine.

C. ELEGANS AS A MODEL FOR INVESTIGATING THE EFFECTS OF ESSENTIAL OILS AS INHIBITORS OF THE QUORUM SENSING SYSTEM, YEAR TWO
Kaitlin Elisabeth Joest
Keystone School, San Antonio, TX

Yearly, over 90,000 people die from bacterial infections in the U.S., of which over 70% involve antibiotic-resistant strains. The purpose of this project was to determine the effectiveness of four essential oils, thyme, oregano, tea tree, and garlic, in inhibiting the quorum sensing system (QSS) in X. nematophila, A. hydrophila, and A. radiobacter. These oils have proven to be successful topical antiseptics; however, this study planned on infecting the model organism, C. elegans, with these pathogens to study the internal antibiotic properties of the oils. It was hypothesized that all four of the essential oils would prove to be successful inhibitors of the QSS in the pathogenic bacteria.<br><br> C. elegans were exposed to bacterial cultures for four days. Then, they were transferred to plates with varying oil concentrations as well as plain NGM plates which were controls. Survival rates of the initial generation were recorded for eight days.<br><br> In conclusion, the experiment showed both tea tree and garlic oils acted as possible inhibitors of the QSS in X. nematophila and tea tree can be shown as an inhibitor in A. hydrophila. A. radiobacter did not provide sufficient pathogenicity towards the C. elegans, so the oils could not be proven effective. This research introduced a new method of detecting inhibitors of the QSS. This is another step forward in determining alternative methods for curing internal bacterial illnesses.

Bio-Diesel is an environmentally-friendly sustainable-carbon fuel. One way to lower its cost is to convert its largest by-product, Glycerol, into a compound with commercial value. This project seeks to find and identify a naturally occurring microbe that uses Glycerol as its sole carbon source. And thus, maybe convert it into a valuable compound.<br><br> Procedure: <br><br>1. Collect samples via micro-tider plates put at places with petroleum oil or animal fats.<br><br>2. Incubate samples on 2XYT and CDOX agar then isolated into pure colonies.<br><br>3. Identify organism using standard procedures including: Gram Stain, Heletoenteric Plate, EMB Plate, Enterotube, and DNA Analysis. DNA analysis was performed using: Extract DNA, Run PCR, Run Gels, Gene Clean, Ligration, Digest, Sequence, and BLAST.<br><br> Data: Three microbes were collected which grow on Glycerol at a local butcher shop.<br><br> Conclusions:<br><br>1. Sample #1 was initially thought to be E-coli, given its rod shape and Gram Negative test. But, EMB test for E-coli was negative. Enterotube testing indicated it might be Serratia Liquifaciens. Nucleotide blast found one part of reverse sequence a perfect match for Serratia Proteamaculans; however, forward part did not match, thus, it could be a new organism with similar parts and characteristics of Serratia.<br><br>2. Sample #2 grew weak colonies. It was Gram Positive. It has not yet been sequenced.<br><br>3. Sample #3 was a robust fungus. It grew on 2XYT and CDOX but best on PDA. It has not yet been sequenced.

BIPHASIC EFFECT OF TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS ON BACTERIAL POLYMERASE-DEPENDENT RNA SYNTHESIS
Siyu Crystal Zhang
Troy Athens High School, Troy, MI

There are numerous transcription factor (TF) elements in coding sequences that encode proteins in all species. Bacterial polymerase binds to its promoter, such as T7, and drives in vivo RNA synthesis without the presence of transcription factors. The effect of TFs on bacterial polymerase is unknown. The hypothesis is that prokaryotic RNA polymerase like a smooth template track without TFs binding to their elements unlike eukaryotic RNA polymerase that like a rough template track. To test this hypothesis, a Megascript T7 kit for in vitro transcription, both nuclear extracts containing transcription factors and AP1 (as transcription factor resources), and Real-time RT-PCR have been employed. The results demonstrate a biphasic effect of TFs on bacterial polymerase. Real-time RT-PCR results further confirm the biphasic effect that AP1 enhances about two fold RNA synthesis at 2 fpu concentration and inhibits 9 fold RNA synthesis at 8 fpu concentrations. These results indicate that bacterial polymerase need a relatively smooth template track in order to synthesize RNA efficiently. In addition, these results can also explain why obligate intracellular bacteria such as Chlamydias and Rickettsias can grow and proliferate in human cells.

PURIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF MYCOBACTERIOPHAGE PHANTOM X
Shanay Lee Darrah
Malta High School, Malta, MT

The purpose of this project was to identify, purify, amplify, and characterize a mycobacteriophage that infects Mycobacterium smegmatis. Bacteriophage research is one possible route for biologists to discover a new, more effective form of vaccines and antibiotics. M. smegmatis is important because it is a fast-growing, non-pathogenic, distant cousin to the mycobacterium that causes tuberculosis. I hypothesized that I would successfully perform each procedure until I had viewed the bacteriophage’s DNA, and obtained images of the phage under an electron microscope. <br><br>The bacteriophage I characterized was previously identified and named Phantom X. I purified the phage to ensure I was only working with a single type of phage and without any contaminants. The amplification process gave me a more concentrated sample of Phantom X bacteriophage. To characterize the phage I separated its proteins from its DNA and compared its DNA to other phages’ DNA by restriction enzyme digestion followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The DNA bands were visualized under UV light and photographed in a BioRad Gel Doc system. Then, I was able to examine Phantom X by transmission electron microscopy.<br><br>Future biochemical analysis of Phantom X proteins will allow additional comparison to other known viruses. These bacteriophage viruses infect and kill harmful bacteria that cause bacterial infections.

THE EFFECT OF MURRAYA KOENIGII ON STAPHYLOCOCCUS EPIDERMIDIS
Niyati Shah
Munster High School, Munster, IN

The purpose of this experiment was to test the effect of Murraya koenigii on acne. The method used was bacterial inhibition. I grinded 10 dried and 10 fresh leaves separately of the plant with 10ml of water each. I made tenfold dilutions of the extract, soaked a filter paper disk, and placed it onto Nutrient Agar plates spread with the skin bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermidis and E.Coli. Murraya koenigii is proven to be an antibacterial agent for E.Coli. I looked for the inhibition of growth from the water extract of the plant. The results were as follows: the dried leaves had no zone of inhibition on either Staphylococcus epidermidis or E.Coli. The fresh leaves had an effect on Staphylococcus epidermidis, but the results were not consistent. For the E.Coli, the results were a little more consistent except that there was no growth for the concentrated. I did the experiment again because the first time proved that there was an effect, but the effect was not consistent throughout the serial dilutions. Unlike the first time, I only tested fresh leaves and filtered the extract with a Whatman filter. The results for the second experiment were very consistent. The zone of inhibition (10^0-10^-5) for E.Coli ranged from 4.0mm to 1.2mm. For Staphylococcus epidermidis (10^0-10^-5) the range went from 7.8mm to .7mm. Because Murraya koenigii is proven to be effective against E.Coli, my results showed that Murraya koenigii is more effective against Staphylococcus epidermidis, which is one of the causative agents of acne.

HOW CLEAN ARE YOUR HANDS? PHASE TWO
Emily Jane Sanford
Warren Central High School, Bowling Green, KY

This experiment will present insight regarding the reduction of bacteria using, anti-bacterial hand soap verses hand sanitizer, to see which will yield the greatest reduction in the growth of microorganism found on ones hands in the course of patting out ground chicken for food preparation. This information should be most beneficial in reducing food borne illnesses associated with unclean or improperly washed hands.<br><br> I predict that the anti-bacterial hand soap will work much better in reducing the amount of microorganisms on ones hands when compared to using hand sanitizer prior to food preparation, especially preparation involving the use of commercially packaged ground chicken.<br><br> Prior to the project all experiment materials will be procured. Five Petri dishes will be utilized for controls and will be labeled as follows: unwashed hands, commercially packaged ground chicken, unwashed hands with patted chicken, hand sanitized hands, and anti-bacterial cleansed hands. These will be monitored at 24 and 48 hour intervals to serve as a base line guide in my experiment. Once this is established, trial number one and number two will be initiated. <br><br> The results will clearly demonstrate that the various cleansers, which I have selected, will have different degrees of effectiveness in reducing the amount of microorganisms. Controls will be a comparison. Trials and percentages of growth will be documented for entry. As noted I will use anti-bacterial soap, hand sanitizer, and commercially packaged ground chicken. In my experiment, of cleansers I use, the anti-bacterial hands soap will appear to be more effective.

AN EFFICIENT METHOD TO STERILIZE FOOD PRODUCTS
Kaleem Ahmed Qazi
Carman-Ainsworth High School, Flint, MI

Gastroenteritis is the most common result of bacterial contamination of food products. While visiting third world countries it is very difficult not to come in contact with these pathogens, especially since we do not know how the food is handled before eating, apart from water. I always wondered how to take care of this problem. Is there any device that can successfully get rid of the infection present in the food we eat and the water we drink? From this I realized that microwaves were present in all homes, even in developing countries. Microwaves work on electromagnetic waves that rotate the polarized water molecules with so much speed that the water becomes very hot and even boils in a few seconds. Bacteria such as Escherichia coli, were used in this experiment since they are the most common waterborne non-spore forming microorganisms. Different types of soups were inoculated with the bacteria. I microwaved the soups at different times (0 seconds to 5 minutes) and observed that soups had been completely sterilized in a few seconds.<br><br>The next part of my project was to find out if there was a way that the contaminated dinnerware could eradicate the microorganisms. I used spore-forming bacteria (Bacillus subtilis), a pink colony forming yeast (Torula glutinis), a spore-forming fungus (Aspergillus nigricans), and also Escherichia coli. They were swabbed on glass petri dishes to simulate dinnerware contamination by organisms. The dishes were microwaved at different times and then re-swabbed to collect microorganisms from the petri dish. Interestingly bacteriocidal activity took an even longer time to eradicate for spore forming organism (Tortula glutinis), and the spore forming fungus did not have any effect even when it was microwaved for up to five minutes. Hence, I conclude that microwaving is the most economical and efficient way to sterilize water and it only works with the food products that have more water content.

THE EFFECT OF CLODRONATE ON CONJUGATIVE TETRACYCLINE RESISTANCE PLASMID TRANSFER BETWEEN ESCHERICHIA COLI AND SALMONELLA TYPHIMURIUM
Aaron Christopher Ramsey
Jefferson Forest High School, Forest, VA

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of varying concentrations of clodronate on the transfer of tetracycline resistance via bacterial conjugation from Escherichia coli to Salmonella typhimurium during a mating assay. The initial assumption was that as the molarity of clodronate in the mating solution increased, the relative rate of plasmid transfer, as determined by a plate count difference using Salmonella selective agar plates with and without tetracycline, would decrease. Experimentation took place over the course of several weeks, and it was carried out at the local Virginia Department of Agriculture laboratory. Cultures of E. coli known to carry a plasmid for tetracycline resistance and S. typhimurium known to be susceptable to tetracycline were grown to an equal OD600. A 1:9 matting assay was set up and the various molarities of clodronate were placed in each tube. Eight different runs were incubated for approximately 18 hours. The newly grown assays were then plated at different dilutions on plates both with and without tetracycline and grown overnight. As a result the total conjugation did decrease over all. At 0M clodronate the conjugation was an average of 0.60% with some tests nearing closer to 1.00%. The 100mM assay, however, was a mere <.01% conjugation in all cases. This proves that in adequate quantities, clodronate does in fact prevent tetracycline resistance plasmid transfer between Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli.

Guilherme Henrique Martins
Universidade Tecnologica Federal do Parana - Campus Campo Mourao, Campo Mourao, Parana, BRASIL

The present study was undertaken to investigate in vitro antibacterial activity of latex of Euphorbia tirucalli, a plant found in various regions of Brazil and better known as aveloz or pencil tree, which is traditionally used for the treatment of tumors. Aerial parts of the plant were collected and deposited in a Herbarium. The latex was extracted and kept in a bottle sterilized under refrigeration until used for the biological tests. The antimicrobial assays were performed by diffusion disc method, using Sthaphylococcus aureus. All assays were carried out in triplicate. Whatman no. 1 sterile filter paper discs (5mm) were impregnated with latex solution (concentration of 0.2, 0,4 and 0.6% v/v). In vitro antibacterial activity was determined by using Baird-Parker Agar. 0.1mL of inoculum’s solution was uniformly spread on solidified agar. The discs were then applied and the plates were incubated at 37°C for 48h. The control assay was performed with discs without latex solution. The diluted solution of latex of the plant inhibited the growth of bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, featuring halos increasing bacterial inhibition, in accordance with the increase of concentration of the solution (0.2, 0.4 and 0.6% v/v), average by 1.33 mm, 2.17 mm and 2.33 mm, respectively for each concentration from the edge of the disk. The results confirmed the ability of inhibition of bacterial growth in vitro by the solution of latex of Euphorbia tirucalli.

ISOLATION OF GRAM POSITIVE RODS FROM MANGROVE SOIL OF CARDOSO ISLAND, CANANEIA, SAO PAULO, BRAZIL
Bruno Martinucci
Colegio Giordano Bruno, Sao Paulo, BRASIL

The mangrove is a characteristic ecosystem of tropical and subtropical regions that is placed in transition from the land and sea environments, commonly situated in the join of rivers and seas. Despite the facts that the soil contains an enormous diversity of microorganisms, a few bacteria genus show capacity of multiplication in vitro. The goal of this research was to isolate bacteria in mangrove soil and verify best bacteriological method for bacterial determination. At the University Laboratory, samples of mangrove soil obtained in the Cardoso Island (Cananéia, São Paulo, Brazil) (n=4) were cultured in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth, STUART with glucose 5% broth and filtered mangrove soil at 1% broth and maintained at 25°C or 37°C for seven (07) days. After this, the preliminary growth were cultured in BHI agar, potato agar, STUART with glucose 5% agar and mangrove soil 1% agar incubated at 25°C or 37°C. Afterwards, bacterial morphology utilizing Gram staining method was used as a first step of bacterial identification. <br><br>The greater bacterial diversity was obtained when mangrove soil were cultured in BHI at 25oC in comparison with the growth at 37°C. In addition, bacterial isolates were used on inhibition assays of Salmonella Typhimurium. None bacterial isolate was able to inhibit the Salmonella Typhimurium growth in these conditions, but it was observed halo of inhibition between the rods isolates.

THE PRECIPITATE OF ARSENIC IN GROUNDWATER INFLUENCED BY BACTERIA
Cragun Coleman Liston
Orion Junior High, Harrisville, UT

A landfill in Northern Utah recently found a dramatic increase in the level of arsenic in a groundwater monitoring well. The level of arsenic was 120 ppm which significantly exceeds the groundwater protection standard of 50 ppm. This project tested the well to determine if the cause for this rise in arsenic had occurred from bacterial development due to garbage seepage. Groundwater samples from the well were tested for the amounts and types of bacteria using Biological Activity Reaction Tests, a system that determines the population and type of bacteria found in water samples. Based on pattern and reaction time, the amounts of colony forming units found in the well were determined. Aerobic and anaerobic sulfate reducing bacteria and heterotrophic aerobic bacteria were found to be the most dominant. The other two types tested for, iron related and slime forming bacteria, were existent but not in large amounts. After comparing the results to those of the other wells on the premise, there was no significant difference between the quantities and types of bacteria, concluding that there was no correlation between the elevated level of arsenic and the bacteria in the well.

FLOWER POWER: AN INVESTIGATION OF NATURAL ANTIBIOTIC PROPERTIES IN ROSACEAE, LILIACEAE, GERBERA JAMESONII, CARYOPHYLLACEAE, AND SCROPHULARIACEAE
Kassandra Wilson
Orion Junior High School, Harrisville, UT

The Native American People have long used plants for natural healing. The purpose of this project was to find additional ways to use the plants once again. This time, though, not only for healing but also for the prevention of diseases. Tests of common house and garden flowers were conducted to determine their natural antibiotic properties. These flowers included Roses, Lilies, Snap Dragons, Carnations, and Gerberas. It was predicted that the stems of plants would have greater antibiotic properties then the petals. <br><br> <br><br>In order to test this theory I cut the flower petals into a 1”x 1” square and the stems into a 1 inch length. Once the cuts were complete I ground up all flower petals and stems separately to make a total of ten slurries. I then plated the bacteria (E-Coli and Micrococcus Leutius) onto the Petri-dishes. After which a sterile cotton disk was placed into the each Petri-dish and two of slurry was applied to the cotton disk. Once completed, I placed the Petri-dishes into an incubator. I let them sit for 48 hours at a temperature of 40 degrees Celsius. I measured the zone of inhibition. The flowers did kill the bacteria. The data stated that the average amount of bacteria killed by the petals was only 1 millimeter. The stems, however, killed 2.3 millimeters of bacteria. <br><br> <br><br>The test was a success. I found that flowers do kill bacteria. I believe that one day we can take this information and apply it to every day life. Maybe, we can prevent deadly diseases from taking over. Even if we stopped only a few types of bacteria it would be a natural product that wouldn’t harm and may even benefit the environment. If only we could protect us and the environment at the same time. Wouldn’t that be great?

RPON REGULON IN THE VIRULENCE OF A CYSTIC FIBROSIS (CF) PATHOGEN
Chen Sun
A B Lucas Secondary School, London, Ontario, CANADA

This project investigates Burkholderia cenocepacia (B. cenocepacia), an opportunistic pathogen dangerous to people with compromised immune systems, particularly cystic fibrosis patients; its virulence factors are not understood. A previous paper showed two interesting B. cenocepacia mutants unable to survive in vivo (among others), so my project here tries to answer the questions of why the two mutants were unable to survive in vivo and why the mutated gene regions themselves (one, in a promoter region located between operons BCAL-1524 and BCAL-1525; the other, in a region encoding a transcriptional activator) were important for virulence. <br><br> <br><br>A B-Galactosidase Assay I conducted revealed the two operons BCAL-1524 and BCAL-1525 to be controlled by RpoN, an alternative sigma factor important for B. cenocepacia virulence. A Motility Assay I conducted revealed the two operons BCAL-1524 and 1525 to be crucial for B. cenocepacia motility. This study, then, is the first in which genes controlled by RpoN in B. cenocepacia have been characterized. It is an important starting point in eventually understanding the RpoN regulon in B. cenocepacia. Motility is a proven crucial virulence factor in B. cenocepacia --the results of my Motility Assay help explain why the mutated promoter gene in the previous paper had been unable to survive in vivo, and further elucidate the possible roles the crucial RpoN Regulon plays in B. cenocepacia pathogenicity. The results of my study suggest that developing an antimicrobial agent to target the specific proteins of the genes studied here, may be a novel and practical idea in helping cystic fibrosis patients combat B. cenocepacia.

SPICES: NOT JUST A SEASONING
Ganna Viktorivna Pastukh
Murphy High School, Mobile, AL

This project is designed to determine antimicrobial activity of onion, garlic, and lime extracts at different concentrations (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100%) against Escherichia coli (E.coli) bacteria. The hypothesis of this project is that garlic extract will have the highest antibacterial activity while onion extract will show the least, if any, antimicrobial activity. <br><br>The effects of spice extracts on E.coli bacterial growth were determined by using the disk-diffusion method. Agar plates were uniformly inoculated with E.coli bacteria culture. The paper disks were placed on the agar surface and were impregnated with appropriate spice extracts with different concentrations and also with water (control) and Ampicillin solution. The diameter of the clear zone around the disks, death zone, was measured and expressed in millimeters as the antimicrobial activity of the spices extracts. <br><br>The results demonstrate that onion extract did not show any antibacterial effect against E.coli bacteria. Garlic and lime extracts began to show their antimicrobial activity at concentration of 40%. However, garlic extract at concentration of 40% proved to be more effective than lime extract at concentration of 100%. Comparison of the inhibitory effect of these spice extracts with that of antibiotic Ampicillin with the concentration of 200 µg/ml showed that the average diameter of death zone for Ampicillin disks (17.6 mm) proved to be higher than the average diameter of death zone for lime disks with concentration of 100% (12.4 mm) and garlic disks with concentration of 40% (16.5 mm). However, it was lower than the average diameter of death zone for garlic disks with concentration of 60% (18.3 mm). <br><br>The results of the experiment supported the hypothesis in that the garlic extract had the highest antibacterial activity against E.coli bacteria. Garlic extract thus can be useful in inhibiting bacteria for medicinal purposes and preserving food.

DETECTION OF NASAL COLONIZATION BY MRSA: A COMPARISON OF IDENTIFICATION METHODS TO DEVELOP AN ALGORITHM FOR SURVEILLANCE AND INTERVENTION
Sarah Elizabeth Hodges
First Academy- Leesburg, Leesburg, FL

This project’s purpose was to initiate best infection control practices for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) to reduce hospital cost and patient morbidity/mortality. Polymerase Chain Reaction, Chromogenic agar, Penicillin-Binding Protein (PBP2’) Latex Agglutination, Oxacillin Screen Agar, Cefoxitin Disk Diffusion, and Oxacillin MIC were compared in detection of nasal colonization by MRSA to develop an algorithm for surveillance and intervention for MRSA patients in health-care facilities. The researcher hypothesized data collected would prove PCR to be the most sensitive for detecting MRSA isolates from the anterior nares. <br><br>After 100 swabs were collected and PCR assay was observed, plates of manitol salt agar and chromogenic agar for MRSA were swabbed and streaked from the patient samples. At 24 and 48 hours, Chromagar results were evaluated, and Staphylococcus aureus colonies identified from manitol salt agar were tested by each of the following procedures: PBP2’ Test, Oxacillin Screen Agar, Cefoxitin Disk Diffusion, and Oxacillin MIC, which was used as the reference test.<br><br>The data collected was compared based on sensitivity, specificity, +/- predictive value, time, and cost. The research was not able to prove or disprove the hypothesis due to discrepancies between the reference method and the PCR assay. Based on a variety of healthcare-related factors, a combination of methods was utilized in the development of three separate algorithms for initial screening, rescreening of long-term patients, and determining if infection is by MRSA.

EFFECTS OF WATER QUALITY ON THE PROPAGATION AND GROWTH OF BATRACHOCHYTRIUM DENDROBATIDIS
Scott Paul Boisvert
Basha High School, Chandler, AZ

Chytridiomycosis, a disease caused by the amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, is a major threat contributing to amphibian population decline worldwide. This research evaluated how water from a natural environment affects the propagation and growth of B. dendrobatidis. Water samples were collected representing potential amphibian habitats with varied locations, physical features and natural elements in the greater Phoenix area. Bioassay experimentation measured optical density (% absorbance) over time reflecting the relative number of zoospores and sporangia produced, indicating the growth of the fungus within the water samples. Chemical analyses including visible light spectrophotometry, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) were used to identify features of the water quality that influenced B. dendrobatidis growth, expecting impurities or contaminants to inhibit growth. Results were evaluated by correlating optical density (% absorbance) of B. dendrobatidis over time (days) for each water sample site, and calculating percent change in growth to describe the overall effects of water quality on the growth of B. dendrobatidis. Results supported the hypothesis; growth curves for B. dendrobatidis demonstrated that 12 of the 15 water samples inhibited growth as compared to experimental controls. In conclusion, water from a natural environment has an inhibitory effect on the growth of B. dendrobatidis, and growth behavior varies dependant upon the features of the particular habitat the water sample was taken from. This project contributes to the understanding of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis’ growth behavior, a necessary tool for abatement planning, and critical knowledge to stop this ominous mass extinction.

ENGINEERING A NOVEL GRAM-NEGATIVE EFFECTIVE EFFLUX PUMP INHIBITOR
Eric Nelson Delgado
Bayonne High School, Bayonne, NJ

The emergence of bacterial multidrug resistance pumps (MDRPs) is a growing problem in the treatment of infectious diseases. One attractive treatment option for bacteria which have developed these MDRPs is the use of efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) such as 5’-methoxyhydnocarpin (5’-MHC), a natural EPI only shown effective in gram-positive bacteria. However, many known EPIs are natural products which are large and hydrophilic. It seems these qualities prevent them from being effective in gram-negative bacteria because the compounds are not able to permeate the outer membrane, which is absent in gram-positive bacteria. The aim of this study was to engineer a derivative of 5’-MHC which is able to permeate the outer membrane of E. coli while retaining the inhibitory activity of the original 5’-MHC molecule. The AcrB efflux pump expressed in E. coli was studied. The effectiveness of all molecules tested was determined utilizing an active transport assay and MIC90 tests. To illustrate the importance of the outer membrane to a molecule’s effectiveness, these experiments were performed on both membrane intact and membrane compromised bacteria. Experiments demonstrated that 5’-MHC was effective in membrane compromised cells, but not in membrane intact cells. This indicates that the impermeability of the outer membrane was indeed a barrier for the molecule’s effectiveness in inhibiting the AcrB. Also, 4’-isoproxyflavone, the molecule selected to have the most potential to enter the cell via diffusion across the outer membrane, was shown to be more effective than 5’-MHC in membrane compromised E. coli, but not at all effective in membrane intact E. coli. Finally, diosmetin, the molecule selected to have the most potential to cross the outer membrane via a porin channel, was equally as effective as 5’-MHC in both membrane intact and membrane comprised E. coli. Thus, diosmetin was identified as a gram-negative effective EPI.

EVALUATION OF BURKHOLDERIA PYRROCINIA (FL728) AND PAENIBACILLUS LENTIMORBUS (FL97) FOR THE PRESENCE OF BACILLUS SUBTILIS ANTIBACTERIAL GENES
Stephanie Page Hoskins
Lincoln Park Academy High School, Fort Pierce, FL

The purpose of this experiment was to determine if bacteria isolates Burkholderia pyrrocinia (FL728) and Paenibacillus lentimorbus (FL97) possess the antimicrobial fengycin, iturin, surfactin, and TasA genes of Bacillus subtilis. The researcher chose this experiment because in past years, Burkholderia pyrrocinia (FL728) and Paenibacillus lentimorbus (FL97)were proven to suppress plant pathogenic fungi, and the scope of the two isolates would be increased with the ability to suppress bacteria. The antimicrobial genes of Bacillus subtilis have never been confirmed in the two variable isolates.<br><br> The researcher isolated the DNA of the three isolates. Multiple PCRs and DNA gels were run using the FF/FR, IF/IR, SF/SR, and TR/TR constructed primers to amplify the DNA for all the isolates. Results showed that only the FF/FR and IF/IR primers should be used for DNA gel extractions. The DNA of each FF/FR and IF/IR primer and isolate set were cloned by the process of ligation, transformation, and grow-up. All bacteria isolates were cloned and sequenced for gene comparison. The statistical analysis showed that none of the four antibacterial genes were present in the three isolates. The isolate Bacillus subtilis showed a strong similarity to a Burkholderia species, and was sent for identification and was identified as Burkholderia cenocepacia. The data was invalid.<br><br> The researcher re-ran the project with the proper Bacillus subtilis isolate. The researcher noticed all four primers were amplifying within Bacillus subtilis. Once extracted, the three bacteria isolates were sequenced. The statistical analysis showed that Bacillus subtilis had a confirmed iturin gene and Burkholderia pyrrocinia (FL728) had a hypothesized iturin gene. According to research, Bacillus subtilis isolates have never simultaneously produced the antimicrobial genes. The researcher confirmed the production of the iturin gene and is testing the organism for other antimicrobial genes. Further testing is being completed to confirm the presence of the iturin gene in Burkholderia pyrrocinia (FL728).

CAN GREEN TEA REDUCE THE SPREAD OF ANTIBIOTICS RESISTANCE?
Peter Yin
Ames High School, Ames, IA

Almost every type of bacteria has become more resistant to antibiotics in the last decade. Antibiotic resistance is the ability of bacteria to become invulnerable to certain antibiotics, which is already a big problem in today’s medical world. On top of that, a more dangerous problem is the spread of antibiotic resistance through bacterial conjugation, the transfer of genetic material (plasmids) by contact between two bacterial cells. In last year’s science fair project, I found that green tea could synergistically work with antibiotics to reduce the antibiotic resistance. This year, I wanted to test whether green tea could stop the spreading of antibiotic resistance by inhibiting the bacterial conjugation, the main mechanism by which the antibiotic resistance spreads. To do this, I used a bacterium donor strain (F+) that has an F plasmid containing the Ampicillin resistant gene, and a recipient strain (F-) that has the Streptomycin resistant gene on its chromosome. After mixing the two bacterial strains together, the conjugation efficiency can be determined by the number of colonies grown on the medium containing both Ampicillin and Streptomycin. My results showed that green tea did in fact inhibit bacterial conjugation, as there were fewer conjugates formed as more green tea was added to the conjugation reaction. Moreover, I found that EGCG, the main polyphenol of green tea, also inhibited the conjugation. My results therefore demonstrate that green tea can inhibit bacterial conjugation, and thus has the potential to stop the spread of antibiotics resistance.

CONTRIBUTION OF PNEUMOLYSIN(PLY),PNEUMOCOCCAL SURFACE PROTEIN A (PSPA), AND PNEUMOCOCCAL SURFACE PROTEIN C (PSPC) TO PNEUMOCOCCAL VIRULENCE
Ashley Dekira Poullard
Murrah High School, Jackson, MS

Streptococcus pneumoniae, pneumococcus, is an important pathogen that causes worldwide morbidity and mortality. In addition to the capsular polysaccharide, there are a number of proteins that contribute to the virulence of this pathogen. Previously a mutant in a serotype 2 strain that lacked pneumolysin (Ply), pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA), and pneumococcal surface protein C (PspC) was produced and found that mutant to be avirulent in mice. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of these proteins in a different pneumococcal capsular serotype. I obtained a mutant of S. pneumoniae TIGR4, a serotype 4 pneumococcus, that failed to express PspA and PspC. We inactivated Ply in this strain by allelic replacement and designated the resultant mutant as TIGR4∆PAC. Using an in vitro competitive growth assay, I was able to determine if the mutations affected the growth rate of the mutant. All in vivo studies were conducted by the qualified scientist. A mouse model of systemic infection was used to assess the virulence of TIGR4∆PAC in tissue samples. TIGR4∆PAC was able to compete and grow at a rate similar to the wild-type in the in vitro assay. In a seven-hour period, both strains exhibited a mean generation number of approximately 8. Following intravenous challenge of mice at 24 hours, there were 4.4x103 ± 1.2x103 colony forming units (CFU)/ml of blood of TIGR4∆PAC compared to 5.1x109 ± 3.7x109 CFU/ml of blood of TIGR4. Our data demonstrates that mutations in Ply, PspA, and PspC do not affect the in vitro growth rate of pneumococci. However, results show there is a significant reduction in the virulence of TIGR4∆PAC as compared to the wild-type. Despite this reduction in virulence, TIGR4∆PAC was not avirulent as had been seen with the serotype 2 mutant.

STUDY OF 5FOA-RESISTANT MUTANTS IN SCHIZOSACCHAROMYCES POMBE
Catherine Anna Hoffman
Hamilton-Wenham Regional High School, South Hamilton, MA

Uracil biosynthesis genes are important research tools in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The S. cerevisiae URA3 gene and the S. pombe ura4 gene encode the same enzyme required for growth in medium lacking uracil, but also for sensitivity to the pyrimidine analog 5FOA. A second uracil pathway enzyme, encoded by both S. cerevisiae URA5 and URA10, is required for 5FOA-sensitivity. S. pombe open reading frame SPBC725.15 appears to encode the same enzyme, but it has not been proven that strains designated as ura5 mutants have a defect in SPBC725.15, nor has it been shown that only ura4 and ura5 mutations confer 5FOA-resistance.<br><br> It was hypothesized that while ura5 is likely to be SPBC725.15, genes other than ura4 and ura5 may be mutated to confer 5FOA-resistance.<br><br> The goals were to 1) isolate 5FOA-resistant mutants and place them into genetic linkage groups to determine the number of affected genes, and 2) clone ura5 by plasmid complementation and identify mutations in this gene from ura5 mutants.<br><br> It was determined that of 23 independently-isolated 5FOA-resistant mutants, 16 carried ura4 mutations and 7 carried ura5 mutations. Thus, mutations in only these two genes confer 5FOA-resistance. The ura5 gene was cloned, showing it to be SPBC725.15. Finally, mutations in SPBC725.15 were identified from three ura5 mutant strains, proving that ura5 is SPBC725.15. Based on these results, the S. pombe genome database was updated to indicate that the ura5 gene has been experimentally identified.

EFFECTS OF V. CYANOCOCCUS ON E. COLI BIOFILMS AND MORPHOLOGY
Lauren Elizabeth Blake
Hopkinton High School, Hopkinton, MA

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are caused by an accumulation of bacteria in the urinary tract in structures called biofilms. In vivo studies have demonstrated that blueberry juice has the potential to prevent UTIs by affecting the bacteria’s adhesion mechanism, the p-fimbriae. The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the effect of blueberry juice on biofilm formation and morphology of two E. coli strains: P-fimbriated HB101pDC1 and non-fimbriated HB101. <br><br>The two strains of E. coli were cultured and sub-cultured to the end of exponential growth phase in media containing 50% w.c. blueberry juice. The bacteria were analyzed using a modified biofilm assay and Gram staining. <br><br>After one exposure to blueberry juice, the average absorbance was reduced by up to 67% for E. coli HB 101pDC1 and up to 75% for E. coli HB101, suggesting that biofilm formation was inhibited for both strains. Both bacteria strains had difficulty forming biofilms after 12 subsequent exposures to blueberry juice. <br><br>Both strains underwent changes in morphology after exposure to blueberry juice. After one exposure, both bacteria appeared cocci with the aspect ratio of E. coli HB101pDC1 decreasing 67% and E. coli HB101 decreasing 50%. The morphological changes in both strains were also observed after 12 subsequent exposures to blueberry juice. The results demonstrate that blueberry juice affects cell morphology and biofilm formation in both strains, suggesting that the effects of the blueberry juice on E. coli are not related solely to the adhesion mechanism (p-fimbriae), as concluded in previous studies.

CAN WE TRACE PLANT PATHOGENIC BACTERIA? THE STABILITY OF PUC ORIGIN FLUORESCENT PLASMIDS IN PECTOBACTERIUM SPP.
Woonyung Hur
Korean Minjok Leadership Academy, Hoengseong, Gangwon, SOUTH KOREA

Pectobacterium strains cause diseases on plants and are known as destructive plant pathogens. In order to understand the behavior of the pathogen in the host or non-host plant, the discovery of available markers is necessary. To discover such marker, the stability of fluorescent plasmids in P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum and P. carotovorum subsp. betavasculorum, with pUC origin which is commonly used for E. coli, was measured. Three kinds of pUC origin fluorescent plasmids, pDsRed, pZsYellow, and pGFPuv, were inserted into rifampicin resistant P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum and subsp. betavasculorum. After transformation, all three plasmids were expressed well in P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum and P. carotovorum subsp. betavasculorum. However, plasmid pDsRed expressed red color slowly and made some white colonies. Plasmid isolation and electrophoresis showed that the white colonies lost the pDsRed plasmids. The number of white colonies increased in media with no antibiotic and at higher temperature than optimal temperature. The stability was different in different strains: P. carotovorum subsp. betavasculorum responded much more sensitively to antibiotics and temperature than subsp. carotovorum so that subsp. betavasculorum showed much lower stability under different antibiotics and high temperature. The fluorescence of those plasmids in bacteria on plants was measured. Strains with plasmid pDsRed showed restricted fluorescence near inoculation area even though they had normal pathogenicity. Strains with pZsYellow seemed to express fluorescence normally but the fluorescence could not be discriminated from the plant tissue’s own fluorescence formed by the defense system when infected. Strains with pGFPuv tended to lose their brightness as spread, but pGFPuv traced the pattern of spreading excellently. Throughout whole experiment, it was concluded that pDsRed has an advantage in that its color is very lucid but had slow color change and was more unstable than other plasmids. Plasmid pDsRed could be used as a fine marker despite of its slow expression if treated with appropriate antibiotics. Plasmid pZsYellow was found out to be not good as a marker of plant disease bacteria. Plasmid pGFPuv was found out to be an excellent marker which was easily observable and expressed well on plants.

EFFECTS OF NONNUTRITIVE SWEETENERS ON GROWTH OF E. COLI
Joanna Christine Ryherd
Lutheran School Association High School, Decatur, IL

The purpose of this project was to determine the effects of saccharin, sucralose, and aspartame on the growth of E. coli. <br><br> The researcher gathered the components needed to prepare bacteria cultures, adding concentration discs saturated with solutions of each sweetener comparable to three times the normal human consumption level, as a preliminary experiment with normal consumption levels showed little visible effect. The cultures were allowed to grow for ten days. On each day, data was taken in five spots on each plate using a Vernier Light Sensor, which measured how much light was coming through the plate in lux. Means were taken of each spot for each day. The data from the transition from spot to spot on each plate was removed. The data was then entered into a statistical analysis program and was subjected to an independent samples t-test. <br><br> Contrary to the researcher’s thoughts, the sweeteners failed to produce zones of inhibition. Instead, the sweeteners, excepting sucralose, seemed to have enhancing effects on bacterial growth. The statistical analysis confirmed this observation, as was reflected by the low Significance numbers of each t-test concerning aspartame, sucrose, and saccharin. <br><br> The researcher concluded that aspartame and saccharin had enhancing effects, contrary to the hypothesis. Sucralose had no statistically significant effect. The hypothesis was supported in that sucrose had an enhancing effect. <br><br> The results of this research have proved that these sweeteners are probably safe for humans to consume, as they did not destroy E. coli, which resides in the human digestive system.

THE INVESTIGATION OF POSSIBLE NATURAL ANTIBIOTICS IN SOILS
Erin Marie Gaugler
Grant County High School, Elgin, ND

The emergence of pathogenic microorganisms, resistant to antibiotics, causes an urgent need to find new antibiotics. The soil contains varieties of uncharacterized microorganisms. Believing that these organisms have potential to secrete antibiotics, this project is designed to pinpoint them.<br><br><br>I collected 24 soil samples from land that had no cattle access or pesticidal application as it would contaminate experimentation. After adding sterile LB solution to samples, they were centrifuged to secrete liquids. Next, I prepared growth medium for the sterile petri dishes. This growth medium is called LB Broth, composed of LB Powder, distilled water, and agar agar. These solutions along with filter paper discs and pipette-tips were then autoclaved. Once completed, the solutions were poured into sterilized petri dishes and allowed to solidify. Then, I applied the test organism, Esherichia coli Strain MC4100, to the surface of the growth medium. This strain is non-pathogenic and closely mimics the E. coli present in our intestine and colon. After application, I placed 4 sterile discs on the surface of each dish. This was completed for every sample of soil plus a control. Each individual soil culture was pipetted onto the discs, as well as distilled water for the control. These samples were then incubated overnight and any clearing within the plates indicated antibacterial activity. <br><br><br>This new procedure was conducted 4 times to have a basis of comparison. The assumption that there are unknown microorganisms in soil, which secrete antibiotics, has been proven. Every trial possessed soils that prevented E. coli growth.

POTENTIAL USE OF SIRNA AS AN INHIBITOR FOR THE REPLICATION OF THE HEPATITIS C VIRUS
Gina Mamdouh Gayed
Dar El Tarbiah American School, Cairo, EGYPT

Hepatitis C virus (HCV), a member of the Flaviviridae family of viruses, is a major cause of chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Because it does not have a proper antigen presentation, it is able to elude the host's immune response, and thus, attempts to create vaccines against the virus have not shown any success. <br><br>Combination therapy of the more stable, pegylated IFN alfa and ribavirin improves response rate to more than 50% with some side effects, which makes it the standard treatment for chronic HCV. However, most patients with chronic HCV infection, especially those infected with genotype 4 of the virus, are not candidates for IFN alfa-based therapies, and the IFN alfa-treatments has limited efficacy in immunocompromised patients while treatment of HCV/HIV co-infection presents another challenge. So the development of alternative therapeutic interventions based on newer strategies is urgently needed. A novel strategy that has emerged in the last few years is to target HCV genomic RNA by using siRNA technology, which inhibits gene expression by inducing cleavage of the target. <br><br>In this study, we tested the efficiency of siRNA in inhibiting the hepatitis C viral replication in vitro while we used autologous oval cells developed from cultured stem cells to rebuild the diseased liver.<br><br>Indeed, siRNA could be a new molecular target therapy to inhibit HCV replication in the presence of more than one HCV quasispecies. This technology, if merged with the rebuilding of the diseased liver with oval cells, could possibly help conquer the severe liver damage the virus causes.

THE USE OF MALALEUCA ALTERNIFOLIA COMMERCIAL OIL AS AN INHIBITOR IN GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF ASPERGILLUS NIGER AND CANDIDA ALBICANS, THE MAIN CAUSES OF OTOMYCOSIS
Rhyan S Villanueva
Centro Residencial de Oportunidades de Mayaguez, Mayaguez, PUERTO RICO

Malaleuca alternifolia, known as "Tea Tree Oil", is an australian origin tree and it is used as a medicinal plant. Bio-assay was done to determine the effect of M. alternifolia commercial oil in Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans. The hypothesis was: the commercial oil of Malaleuca alternifolia will inhibit the growth and development of Aspegillus niger and Candida albicans, the main causes of otomycosis.<br><br> To seek for the answer, twelve petri dishes were prepared with PDA. Six plates were inoculated with Aspergillus niger, and six plates with Candida albicans. Aspergillus niger was added to dishes labeled as A1, A2, A3, and Candida albicans to dishes labeled as C1, C2, C3. Three discs embedded with commercial oil of M. altenifolia were placed in the first three dishes of each group. Three discs with sterilized water were added to each of the dishes labeled as A4, A5, A6, C4, C5 and C6; making them the control group. The plates were sealed with paraffin and incubated at thirty six degrees Celsius (36 °C) for 7 days. <br><br> On the third day, there was no growth of A. niger nor C. albicans in dishes A1, A2, A3, C1, C2 and C3. Growth was observed in the control group dishes. On the seventh day, none of the fungi in the experimental group had developed contrary to the control group. The conclusion was that Malaleuca alternifolia commercial oil was effective to inhibit the development of Aspergillus niger and the growth of Candida albicans.

ANTIBIOTIC ACTIVITY OF DIFFERENT EXTRACTS OF CLAUSENA EXCAVATA AGAINST THE PATHOGENS ESCHERICHIA COLI AND STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS, SECOND PHASE
Genesis Serrano-Rodriguez
Padre Anibal Reyes Belen High School, Hatillo, PUERTO RICO

The purpose of this research was to determine the bioactive properties of the plant Clausena excavata. The antibiotic activity of different extracts from Clausena excavata on the pathogens Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were examined. The hypothesis was that the pathogens Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus will be susceptible to the extracts of Clausena excavata. Different extracts from Clausena excavata were prepared in a proportion of 1:2. These were homogenized for 3 minutes and then were filtered. The colonies of bacteria were grown in Petri plates with Tryptic Soy Agar in triplicate with the treatment and a control in the center using the Kirby Bauer method. After 24 hours the diameter of the inhibition halo was measured in millimeters. The average diameter of the halo with Escherichia coli was: bark 2mm, fruit 4.43mm, leaf 0mm, and root 1.5mm. The average halo diameter with Staphylococcus aureus was: bark 0mm, fruit, 4.86, leaf 2.6mm and root 1.46. These results revealed that the extracts of Clausena excavata controlled the growth of the bacteria. The extract of the fruit was the most effective part of the plant in both bacteria. The zone of inhibition did not reach the measurement required according to the inhibition standards to consider it bactericidal, but there was inhibition of both bacteria growth. Further research is recommended using other concentrations of the extracts. The hypothesis was accepted,because the pathogens Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus demonstrated to be susceptible to the extracts of Clausena excavata, especially the fruit extract.

THE EVALUATION OF PHARMACOLOGICAL MODULATION OF CELL SIGNALING KINASES ON VIRAL VECTOR ENTRY
Leah T.C. Guthrie
The Good Hope School, Frederiksted, St. Croix, VIRGIN ISLANDS

Improving the efficiency of viral vector entry is a crucial step in improving gene therapy techniques in the overall pursuit to cure genetic disorders. Genetic disorders are caused by one or more problems of the genes and disrupt the function of vital systems. The goal of gene therapy is to cure genetic disorders by correcting the errors in the DNA. A vector is used to deliver the therapeutic agent in gene therapy. A virus is the most common type of vector used. Amphotropic Murine Leukemia Viruses is a type of retrovirus that uses PiT-2 as its viral receptor. Cells infected with this virus express down modulation of phosphate uptake. It is established that PKC and PKA regulate phosphate uptake by Pit-2. PKC signal to PT-2 to allow phosphates in while PKA signals the opposite. PMA is an effector that binds to PKC and increases its activity. 8 - Br-cAMP binds to PKA and decreases its activity. H89 inhibits PKA. The goal of this project is to evaluate the pharmacological modulation of cell signaling kinases on viral entry in order to gain further understanding of the biological processes and the relationship between the virus and the receptor. It is hypothesized that PMA and H89 will increase the amount of cells infected with the virus. Br-Amp should decrease the amount of cells. There were four major procedures which included the production of the effector solution, viral infection in the presence of the effectors, the staining assay, and evaluation of the results. The Results of the experiment showed a 50% increase of viral infection from cells with effectors PMA and H89. For 8- Br-cAMP there was a decrease in viral infection overall. In conclusion the effectors PMA and H89 appear to have no significant effect on viral vector entry under the conditions used. The pharmacological effector 8-Br-cAMP does appear to cause a significant decrease in A-MLV viral vector infection. This result is highly significant, especially when it is applied to HIV/AIDS. By preventing HIV from making copies of its genome, using this effector could prevent the onset of AIDS. Further studies are necessary to confirm this interesting result and determine the full capability of the effector 8-Br-cAMP. The future objectives include using mutations of PiT-2 and producing the virus in the presence of the effector to determine the abilities of the effect to modify the envelope.

EVOLUTION OF MARINE CYANOBACTERIA IN THE RED SEA
Kevin Huang Lin
Falmouth High School, Falmouth, MA

The cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus are the smallest photosynthetic organisms on Earth yet account for two-thirds of the oceans’ photosynthetic reactions. Their abilities to survive in diverse environments make them ideal for studies of genetic diversity. This research investigated the genetic compositions of multiple Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus species isolated from the Red Sea to determine how the organisms have evolved to nitrogen stress conditions and therefore differ from cyanobacteria found in other bodies of water.<br><br> PCR-based sequencing of cyanobacterial DNA was followed by computer-based analyses to determine the functions of sequenced genes. A phylogenetic analysis compared the sequences of Prochlorococcus marinus strains 8390-C9 and 13A3 to Synechococcus species 4320-C2 and 4320-C3. The alignments were used to observe genotypic adaptations to nitrogen stress, causing sequences to differ from P. marinus strain HOT0M-8F9, isolated from the Pacific Ocean.<br><br> One hundred ninety-two open reading frames, corresponding to possible genes, were identified through sequencing and assembly. Of these, 95 - 100% had highest-significance matches to other cyanobacterial genes, indicating that the geographic boundaries separating species do not cause extreme evolutionary divergence. Twenty-six nitrogen assimilating and metabolizing genes were identified in the two Synechococcus sequences. Only one such gene was found in Prochlorococcus DNA. This lack of nitrogen related genes was surprising due to high levels of nitrogen stress found in the Red Sea.<br><br> The ability of Prochlorococcus to survive in nitrogen-stressed environments despite an apparent lack of necessary genes for nitrogen metabolism should be further investigated.

ANTIBIOTIC SUSCEPTIBILITY OF TWO E. COLI STRAINS DEFICIENT IN THE PRODUCTION OF REDUCED SULFUR
Lawrence Chihyung Ku
Mission San Jose High School, Fremont, CA

Currently, there is no way to kill Mycobacterium tuberculosis once it enters the latent phase in humans. The bacteria must have some way to defend against macrophage oxidants since they are continually being exposed to them. The compounds the bacteria secrete to counteract the oxidants most likely contain sulfur. If the bacteria are deficient in a pathway for synthesizing sulfur containing compounds, will they be more susceptible to the current tuberculosis drugs we have? By using Escherichia coli K-12 and cysC and cysH strains (both deficient in the production of reduced sulfur), this concept can be demonstrated.<br><br>Growing the E. coli in Petri dishes containing variable concentrations of rifampicin, kanamycin, ciprofloxacin, and combinations of these three tuberculosis drugs allows us to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (the two concentration values of the antibiotic treatment between which growth stopped). From experimentation, it has been shown that both the cysC and cysH mutants have a lower minimum inhibitory concentration for ciprofloxacin when compared to the K-12 strain, and additional testing using the zone of inhibition method confirms this.<br><br>The data leads us to conclude that both the cysC and cysH mutants show an increased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin when compared to the K-12 strain. These results suggest that further experimentation with M. tuberculosis may produce similar data, and a vector targeting the pathway for synthesizing sulfur containing compounds may help in our battle to eradicate the white plague.

OYSTER ODYSSEY: TESTING FOR VIBRIO VULNIFICUS IN LOCAL OYSTERS
Clara Jordan Chalk
Hilton Head Preparatory School, Hilton Head Island, SC

The purpose of this experiment is to determine the presence of Vibrio vulnificus in oysters found in the local waters of Hilton Head. It is predicted the South Beach oysters will contain the most V.v. and the Jarvis Creek oysters will contain the least because South Beach has many boat tours and recreational activities while Old Oyster Factory and Jarvis Creek are calm. <br><br> All oysters were collected and the juice was swabbed into prepared Petri dishes. Bacteria percentage was checked every other day for five days using a cm² grid. On average, Jarvis Creek contained 44% bacteria, Old Oyster Factory contained 61%, and South Beach had 35% at the last observation. <br><br> The hypothesis was rejected. The bacteria were not classified and the prediction of levels was incorrect. Due to results, another experiment was conducted over three days testing for all Vibrio using TCBS agar. On the third day, Old Oyster Factory contained 36%, Jarvis Creek contained 22%, and South Beach contained 12%. The hypothesis was rejected because the Old Oyster Factory oysters had the most Vibrio and South Beach Marina contained the least. <br><br> In conclusion, the Old Oyster Factory and Jarvis Creek oysters proved to be the most harmful with a strong possibility of pathogens due to the inability for the water to carry away pollutants, whereas the waters of South Beach are constantly moving, preventing bacteria from sitting long enough to cultivate. Caution is recommended when consuming oysters from the Old Oyster Factory and Jarvis Creek areas. Further testing is recommended.

ASSESSMENT OF ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE IN FARM ISOLATES OF ESCHERICHIA COLI O157: CHROMOSOME VS. PLASMID AND POTENTIAL FOR TRANSFER
Taylor Wesley Jones
Alcoa High School, Alcoa, TN

Overcoming the rise of antibiotic resistance is one of the greatest challenges facing modern medicine. What is the link between consumption of animal products and the emergence of antibiotic resistance? The link lies within the usage of substantial amounts of antibiotics to farm animals. Farm animals become reservoirs for antibiotic resistant bacteria that can spread to the human population via food. In this study, the objective was to determine distribution/incidence of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations isolated from farm animals and establish the genetic origin of the antibiotic resistance (plasmid vs. chromosome) as a means to evaluate the risk for rapid transmission. Forty-seven animal isolates of Escherichia coli strain O:157 from 18 different farms across the United States were tested for their resistance to antibiotics. Testing the genetic origin of antibiotic resistance in the isolates showed that plasmids were present in 21 isolates. Successful plasmid and associated antibiotic resistance transformations were carried out for all but one isolate. Results demonstrated that E. coli O:157 isolates from farms across the United States are reservoirs for antibiotic resistant genes that may be spread to other bacteria via plasmid. Therefore, this study showed that antibiotic resistant genes can be acquired by consumption of animal products.

ANTIBIOTIC PROPERTIES OF PROTOUSNEA POEPPIGII
Rocio Pellegrino Vidal
Escuela de Nivel Medio Nuevos Horizontes, El Bolson, Rio Negro, ARGENTINA

The lichen Protousnea poeppigii (Nees & Flotow, Parmeliaciae, Krog) grows on endemic forests of Patagonia Argentina. Natives have used it traditionally to heal their wounds and throat affections. Specialists were consulted about the presence of these lichens in the region, its morphologic characteristics and its chemical composition. According to bibliography, this species contain usnic acid (known to have antibiotic effects) and because of that, it's supposed to have antibiotic properties. The acetonic extract of this lichen was dissolved to impregnate discs. Its activity against some ATCC® and clinical strains was evaluated, and some gram + bacteria appeared to be sensible. The presence of usnic acid was detected by microscopy and Thin Layer Chromatography against a pattern of usnic acid. The Minimal Inhibitory Concentration and the Minimal Bactericidal Concentration against sensible microorganisms of the extract was determined and compared with those of cf Usnea comosa (Ach.) Roehl extract (this lichen activity has been studied before). The Protousnea poeppigii extract was fractioned by Preparative Thin Layer Chromatography obtaining five different fractions. Their activities were tested against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, resulting all of them active against S. aureus, and only two against the latter. The composition of the fractions was characterized by HPLC. It was determined that Protousnea poeppigii has a stronger activity than cf. Usnea comosa owing to the presence of other antibiotic substances than usnic acid. New antibiotic substances have been discovered.

THE IDENTIFICATION AND KIRBY ASSAY OF BENZETHONIUM CHLORIDE
Alexis Lee Krivoshik
Sturgis Brown High School, Sturgis, SD

This project was the continuation of a project on homeopathic topical antimicrobials. The idea was that grapefruit seed extract, having a high inhibitory rate must have an active compound. The initial idea was to identify and test compounds within grapefruit seed extract for antibacterial properties. Using a gas chromotography test, two compounds were identified, Benzethonium Chloride and Benzylamphetamine. Since amphetamines are near impossible to procure, a Kirby Assay was performed with Benzethonium Chloride upon seven organisms: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes( group A), Streptococcus pneumonaie, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytosa, and Proteus vulgaris using two controls, distilled water and grapefruitseed extract and several concentrations of Benzethonium Chloride 1:100ml, 1:1000ml, and 1:10000ml. All of my organisms were effectively inhibited at dilutions between 1:100ml and 1:1,000ml. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes were even inhibited at 1:10,000ml. The controls of distilled water and grapefruit seed extract acted as expected. Distilled water did not inhibit at all and grapefruit seed extract was slightly more effective than Benzethonium Chloride at the concentrations tested. The higher concentrations of Benzethonium Chloride were more effective in inhibiting bacterial growth than the lower concentrations; however grapefruit seed extract was a bit more effective than the compound at the concentrations tested. I believe that further testing is needed to determine if Benzylamphetamine, aids the Benzethonium Chloride in inhibiting bacterial growth.

GERMICIDAL ORGANICS ON MYCOBACTERIUM FORTUITUM
Bailey Denise Day
Andrews High School, Andrews

This project, in its finished form, is the result of intense curiosity regarding the effects of organic compounds on Mycobacterium fortuitum. It was hypothesized that upon the identification of the correct organic compounds, the bacterial growth would be significantly inhibited with as much efficiency as the ten percent bleach solution required by state law that the salons run through the spa pedicure footbaths.<br><br>Samples were taken from five spa pedicure footbaths, incubated, and monitored for growth. The samples then went through processing and decontamination. Five percent, ten percent, twenty percent, and thirty percent suspensions of burdock, Echinacea, peppermint oil, and tea tree oil were created, and clinically isolated bacteria were added to the suspensions in equal amounts and incubated. The growth of the suspensions was monitored daily. <br><br>All compounds showed inhibitory qualities on M.fortuitum; however, burdock and Echinacea allowed Bacillus to grow, and peppermint oil had Staphylococcus contamination in the ten percent and thirty percent concentrations. Tea tree oil proved to be as effective as bleach in this experiment. There was no growth in any of the vials containing any concentration of tea tree oil.

STIMULATING THE GROWTH OF MARINE ALGAE
Nerissa Hoglen
Kauai High School, Lihue, HI

This experiment examines the conditions most conducive to algal growth. Four different test groups of microbial cultures were grown. Each test group contained: a control culture, with no added growth stimulants in the environment; a culture with fertilizer added to the environment; and cultures with both sugar and fertilizer added to the environment. The cultures in two of the test groups contained sand while the cultures in the other two did not. The cultures containing sugar and fertilizer, both with and without sand, showed immediate growth while the controls and cultures containing fertilizer showed no growth, as indicated by the optical density of the cultures measured with a spectrophotometer. During the first week of growth, bacteria and other microbes dominated the cultures showing growth. After a week, however, algae dominated the cultures containing sand. Following an extended growth period (four weeks), other types of organisms were found both in cultures containing sand and in cultures without sand.

MOBILE GENETIC ELEMENTS AND THEIR EFFECTS ON VIRULENCE IN STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS
Rachel Erin Goldberg
Boca Raton Community High School, Boca Raton, FL

Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of community and hospital-acquired infections, and is becoming evermore antibiotic resistant. A previous study of clinically well defined isolates, grouped into eighteen clonal complexes, showed that isolates in two such complexes were associated with more severe disease. Virulence properties have been identified in mobile genetic elements, and it appears that the lateral transfer of such pathogenicity islands allows for the rapid evolution of virulent bacterial populations. This study utilizes comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) microarray data of 224 clinical S. aureus isolates to demonstrate clear differences in the genetic composition of mobile genetic elements between clonal complexes associated with severe disease and other clonal complexes. In addition, data from seven sequenced strains of S. aureus and the known mobile genetic elements contained in these sequenced genomes confirms that the content and organization of genes in such pathogenicity islands is highly variable with some genes occurring in several different mobile elements.

ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY IN THE HAEMOLYMPH OF CHORUSMYTILUS CHORUS
Jael Stephanie Bravo, Mariana Zherezade Munoz, 
Liceo Santa Maria La Blanca, Valdivia, Region de Los Rios, CHILE

The importance of the search of new peptides with antimicrobial activity has potentials biotechnological applications to fight against bacterial infections. Among other compounds with antimicrobial activity studied, the most relevant in recent years are the antimicrobial peptides or AMPs, because they act as true antibiotics and have the advantage that in general, does not develop resistance. Chilean coasts are rich in bivalves and have endemic species in which AMPs have not been studied. Thus the investigation of these substances in species not studied before is of interest for the scientific world.<br><br>For that reason it was considered important to investigate if the haemolymph of Chilean mollusk “Choro Zapato” (Chorusmytilus Chorus) contain antimicrobial peptides as part of their innate immune system. <br><br>For this study haemolymph was obtained from Ch. chorus and haemocytes were separated from plasma. From this heamolymph plasma several peptide fractions were isolated by acid- and solid-phase extractions”. To determine the antimicrobial activity, the capacity of the different peptides fractions to inhibit Escherichia coli DH5á growth was assayed.<br><br>This investigation allowed us to determine that in the haemolymph plasma of the Ch. chorus a powerful antimicrobial activity of peptide nature exists, which opens the possibility of projecting the use of these peptides in biotechnological applications. The investigations in this area are being extended around the world with the purpose to identify and isolate new antimicrobial peptides that have enhanced antimicrobial activity for their therapeutic use in humans and animals.<br><br>KEYWORDS:<br><br>Antimicrobial peptides, Haemolymph, mollusk

THE EFFECTS OF DISACCHARIDE SUBSTITUTES AND SUCROSE IN VARYING CONCENTRATIONS ON CELL POPULATION AND MORTALITY RATES OF MEDULLOBLASTOMA AND GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME CELL LINES
Stephanie Marie Hicks, Tara Pahwa, 
Keystone High School, San Antonio, TX

The use of artificial sweeteners has greatly increased in recent years, and there is much speculation about their safety as staples in a human diet. The purpose of this project was to determine the effects of saccharin, sucralose, aspartame, and sucrose on the cell mortality and division of two human neural cell lines- DAOY and U251- as a continuation of two previous years of experimentation involving the sweeteners’ effects on Drosophila melanogaster and C. elegans. This third year continuation involved the application of the artificial sweeteners directly into the cell media of both neural cell lines in 0.01% and 0.001% concentrations for seven days. It was hypothesized that saccharin would have the most negative effects, followed by aspartame, and sucralose, with sucrose being the least detrimental to the health of the neural cells. <br><br> Based on daily observations, the U251 cell lines exposed to the sweeteners in both concentrations showed much higher cell mortality when exposed to saccharin, indicating that saccharin had the most detrimental effects. Aspartame had the second most, followed by sucrose, and sucralose was found to have the least detrimental effects. Experimental results from the DAOY cell lines were similar, with saccharin being the most detrimental, followed by sucrose, aspartame and sucralose, regardless of concentration. Based on statistical analysis of raw data, and overall conclusion was reached, finding saccharin to be the most detrimental to the health of human neural cells and sucralose to be the least detrimental.

BACTERIA ON FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
Rachel Linette Sullivan, Emily Wagoner, 
Vista Ridge High School, Cedar Park, TX

The experimental problem was that there was a significant amount of bacteria on produce, and whether treatments actually decreased the bacteria present. The hypothesis was that if a large amount of bacteria is present, including some E. coli and Salmonella, then treatments would decrease the amounts of bacteria. In the first experiment twelve apples and twelve tomatoes (four samples from three different stores) were swabbed three times (two types of Petrifilm and Petri dishes with nutrient agar were used) testing for the presence of bacteria. One apple/tomato from each store was tested as a control. Variables were controlled. Bacteria were present on all produce except three dishes and four Petri film samples. More Salmonella then E. coli was present. It was found that if produce was washed, more bacteria were present, but if also dried or put in a bleach solution, the amount of bacteria was reduced.<br><br>In the second experiment tomatoes were tested with various treatments, including homemade and store-bought oregano oil, after being exposed to E. coli for twenty-four hours. All produce was swabbed three times, one as a control and two washed (one type of Petrifilm and one type of nutrient agar Petri dish were used). It was found that washing and drying and bleaching worked the best, while the oregano oils weren’t effective. <br><br>The hypothesis was accepted that washing and drying or treating with bleach did reduce the amount of bacteria but using oregano oil did not effectively reduce the amount of bacteria present.

HERBAL INHIBITION OF ESCHERICHIA COLI
Boram Lee, Huaiying Wang, Roderick Johnson
The Mississippi School for Mathematics and Science, Columbus, MS

The purpose of this experiment was to test the inhibitory effects of common household herbs on E. coli at various concentrations. An assortment of herbs were used including garlic, cinnamon, oregano, green tea, thyme, cloves, and mustard seed. These herbs have been researched and proven to have antimicrobial and antibacterial characteristics. Luria broth plates were made and E. coli was cultivated. The inhibitory herbs were mixed with distilled water at varying concentrations, and then using as sterile a work area as possible, sterile disks were placed in the varying concentrations and then placed on a Luria broth plate that had been previously innoculated with E. coli. If there was no area of inhibition around the disk, then the concentration was raised further. (The initial concentration of all herbs was 1%.) The garlic was assumed to have the most concrete and efficient antimicrobial and antibacterial properties, and was hypothesized to inhibit the E. coli best at any concentration. However, cinnamon had the most advantageous conditions in inhibition at both 1% and 2%, and further literary reviews were completed to verify this claim.

A NOVEL WAY OF PRODUCING PROTEINS USING ABC TRANSPORTER PROTEIN SECRETORY PATHWAY IN PSEUDOMONAS FLUORESCENS: EFFICIENCY AND SAFETY
Jung Min Ryoo, Hyung Hoon Cho, NaYeon Kim
Korea Science Academy, Busan, SOUTH KOREA

Our research aims to construct a protein manufacturing factory using the ATP-Binding Cassette Transporter (ABC Transporter) in Pseudomonas fluorescens (P. fluorescens). A direct use of P. fluorescence gives the uniqueness to our research because it provides easy genetic manipulation, simple protein purification steps, and high protein secretion efficiency. This research includes two main themes: confirming protein secretion and investigating the safety of P. fluorescens.<br><br> In order to cause a protein secretion, each of six length-varied segments of the lipase C-terminal signal sequence — TliA, TliC1 to TliC5 — were genetically attached to Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP). Western blot analysis and GFP fluorescence measurements were used to confirm protein secretion. As a result, GFP-TliC3 was identified to be well secreted in P. fluorescens. Furthermore, lipase activity plates indicated that P. fluorescens secreted protein more effectively than E. coli did.<br><br> The toxicity of P. fluorescens was determined by investigating its effects on the immune system of human lung epithelial cells, A549. Effects were checked with each step of gene expression — promoter, mRNA, and protein — for three different inflammation inducing proteins: Interleukin-8 (IL-8), Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and Macrophage Inhibitory Cytokine-1 (MIC-1). The experimental methods included luciferase assay, RT-PCR, western blot, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results suggested that P. fluorescens did not considerably affect the immune system of host cells. Also, a cell viability test showed that P. fluorescens was as safe as E. coli at the low concentrations that can possibly be contacted through respiration.<br><br> The contributions of this project are twofold. Firstly, we successfully secreted GFP through the ABC Transporter and this verifies the potential of our system to produce other proteins. Secondly, the safety of P. fluorescens shows that this approach is also realizable.

THE EFFECTS OF MOUTHWASH ON ORAL FLORA AND BIOFILM BACTERIA
Emily Ann Bodensteiner, Katherine Baker, 
John Marshall High School, Rochester, MN

Given the increasing concern with dental care in today's society, everyone is trying to do all they can to protect their smiles. Many products are used to keep those pearly whites shining bright including whitening treatments, floss, fluoride, special toothpastes, and of course mouthwash. But is your mouthwash all it’s cracked up to be?<br><br> Is mouthwash as effective as advertised at killing bacteria? How does mouthwash differ in killing planktonic versus biofilm bacteria? To investigate these questions, we scraped bacteria from mouths, isolated single strains of bacteria, grew bacteria floating in a nutrient broth and in biofilms on coupons, exposed it to mouthwash, and counted the colonies formed. These results were then compared to a control, in which the bacteria were exposed to a nutrient broth in place of mouthwash. <br><br> In doing this experiment, we found that mouthwash is not consistently effective in killing oral bacteria, whether biofilm or planktonic. Although many mouthwashes claim to kill 99.9% of the bacteria found in your mouth, we found this to be an inconsistent statistic. While some bacteria were killed 99.9% of the time, others were not killed at all. In testing three different brands of mouthwash, none of them were found to kill a significant amount of the total bacteria in your mouth. The results we obtained may be useful for further research by mouthwash companies and dental researchers.

FABI POLYMORPHISMS AND TRICLOSAN RESISTANCE IN GRAM NEGATIVE ISOLATES FROM PRIMARY WASTEWATER
Joel Ramon Menchaca, Maria Barron, Luis Rios
Capitol HIll High School, Oklahoma City, OK

Triclosan is used as an antibacterial additive in a wide range of consumer’s goods, including cutting boards, mattress pads, facial cleaners, and hand soaps. Triclosan is a biocide that is effective against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms. Enoyl-ACP reductase (FabI) catalyzes the last step in each cycle and plays a regulatory in determining the rate of fatty acid synthesis The FabI enzymes are receiving increased attention because of the recent discovery that inhibitors of the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway are effective antibacterials. The purpose of this investigation was to isolate triclosan resistant bacteria from wastewater, and to see if they have the FabI G93V gene, which has been suggested to confer triclosan resistance. Bacteria were cultured in TSB and streaked on MacConkey plates. Five cultures were selected and streaked on Mueller-Hinton plates containing 0.0 mg/L, 0.1 mg/L, 0.3 mg/L, 0.6 mg/L, and 1.0 mg/L triclosan. Two triclosan resistant colonies were selected and their DNA was sequenced. One colony was resistant up to 0.6 mg/L, and one was resistant to 1.0 mg/L triclosan. Genetic sequencing data was inconclusive and should be repeated. Results from this study showed that there were triclosan resistant bacteria in primary wastewater, but more genetic sequencing will be needed to see if these bacteria have FabI G93V gene.

GOT YOGURT? THE EFFECTS OF THE TYPE OF YOGURT ON THE AMOUNT OF PROBIOTIC BACTERIA COLONIES CULTIVATED
Vybhavi Bharadwaj, Janet Zhou, 
Shepton High School, Plano, TX

When people take antibiotics, all the bacteria are killed regardless of its benefit. Doctors recommend the usage of yogurt to help replenish probiotic bacteria in the body’s immune system, but the type is still debated. Through this experiment, the students observed which yogurt brand had the most bacteria colonies and thus had the most benefit to the body. <br><br> Yoplait® was hypothesized as the most beneficial because the Live and Active Cultures Label certified the presence of probiotic bacteria. Using a microbiology lab at SMU, the experimenters tested for the effects of different yogurts at different molarities on the bacteria colonization rate. A 0.5 gram sample of each type of yogurt was diluted 2 times using sterile saline before being placed in Petri dishes containing agar and set in the incubator to cultivate. The procedure was repeated five times to validate data, and the bacteria cultures were checked every day for 3 days to observe bacterial growth. <br><br> CFU of the bacteria colonization was calculated to find the number of bacteria colonies/gram; this showed that homemade wholefat yogurt contained the most probiotic bacteria. After calculating the standard deviation for the experiment, it was observed that the error range was considerably small, besides the one glitch in one of the Dannon® trials, because of an accidental drop of a Petri dish. This experiment would benefit the world as a whole, because of yogurt’s wide-spread benefits; by figuring out that homemade yogurt is the most beneficial, it makes it possible for everyone’s lives to improve.

THE EFFECT OF THE OPTIMAL DOSAGE OF THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF TRIGONELLA FOENUM-GRAECUM ON THE INHIBITION OF ENTEROCOCCUS BACTERIA
Saramati Narasimhan, Maanasa Jayachandran, 
Coral Reef Senior High School, Miami, FL

The purpose of this investigation is to test the effect of the water soluble and water insoluble components of Trigonella foenum-graecum on the inhibition of Enterococcus bacteria. It was predicted that if Enterococcus bacteria was exposed to the water insoluble components of Trigonella foenum-graecum, its growth would be inhibited. <br><br> To test this hypothesis, the following was done. Enterococcus bacteria was obtained by spreading settled, sewage water onto Enterococcus media and incubating them at 37 degrees Celsius for 5 days. The Trigonella foenum-graecum was split into its water soluble and water insoluble components with hexane and water. Both components of Trigonella foenum-graecum and Enterococcus bacteria were made into inoculums and put on numerous media to test the effect that the water soluble and water insoluble components had on the inhibition of Enterococcus bacteria. The controls were the regular, unaltered growth of Entrococcus bacteria, the growth of Enterococcus bacteria under the influence of hexane, and the growth of Enterococcus bacteria under the influence of DI water. Three trials, 3 dosages, and 3 concentrations were experimented with. After 5 days of incubation, the colonies were counted. The analysis of these results made it clear that 300 µL of water soluble components at a concentration of 0.053g/mL is the most effective in the inhibition of Enterococcus bacteria. <br><br> The results of this project can be used for the treatment of Enterococcus bacteria. These potential treatments include agricultural products, the purification of water without the use of Chlorine, and the treatment of animals for Enterococcus bacteria.

NANOMOLAR LEVELS OF SELENIUM TRIGGER BIOFILM FORMATION BY ENTEROCOCCUS FAECALIS V583
Sesheta Benu Mwanza
Lake Brantley High School, Altamonte Springs, FL

Biofilms, intricate aggregations of microorganisms, are often the cause of bacterial infections. Previous studies have suggested that oxidative stress, a disproportion between reactive oxygen production and a biological system’s ability to detoxify itself, increases biofilm formation. Reactive oxygen species, such as hydrogen peroxide, cause oxidative stress when present in high levels. This study aims to determine whether selenium at non-toxic levels has the ability to trigger biofilm formation in a manner similar to hydrogen peroxide. Enterococcus Faecalis V583 was cultured in basal media without glucose (BM-G), BM-G with sodium selenite (BM +Se), and BM-G with hydrogen peroxide (BM + H2O2). After 24 hours of incubation at 37ºC, planktonic cells were removed. The biofilm was disrupted with trypsin and harvested after centrifugation in Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline (DPBS). The cells were resuspended, serially diluted in DPBS (10^-1 to 10^-9), plated onto L-agar and incubated for 24 hours at 37ºC. Visible bacterial colonies (CFU) were counted. After three experiments, the total number of CFUs were determined and then averaged: (BM-G): 10^7.17± 0.63 CFU/mL, (BM +Se): 10^8.88± 0.31 CFU/mL, (BM + H2O2): 10^8.38± 0.19 CFU/mL. This data would support the hypothesis that non toxic levels of selenium can trigger biofilm formation in the same manner as H2O2 and therefore plays a role in oxidative stress.

THE EFFECTS OF CERTAIN ORGANIC AND INORGANIC NUTRIENT ADDITIONS ON THE GROWTH OF KARENIA BREVIS
Kay Li
Pensacola High School, Pensacola, FL

The purpose of the experiment was to determine which organic and inorganic sources of nutrition will affect the growth of Karenia brevis the most. The experiment used cultures of Karenia brevis and cultured them in 50mL test tubes. They were given different nutrients: urea, an amino acid mixture, ammonium, iron (III) chloride, and soil water. The results taken by these cultures were compared with a control group which contained an F/2 growth media They were put under full spectrum lights in a 12:12 day/night cycle. Then, the in vivo fluorescence of the cultures were measured using a fluoromoeter.<br><br>The results showed that the cultures given urea and iron (III) chloride grew at a comparable rate to the control. The amount of Karenia in the ammonium trial fell drastically. At the end, it could be said with relative certainty that all the Karenia in the ammonium trials were dead. The amino acid trial grew very well in the first two days. However, after those days, the amino acid trial decreased in size. The soil extract trial grew well, but it still did not grow as well as the control. From these results, it can be said that urea and iron (III) chloride are potent nutrients for Karenia brevis while ammonium may actually kill Karenia. The soil water extract is one of the less important sources of nutrition for Karenia. As for the amino acids, little can be said about it because all the trials died off after two days. This is likely due to bacteria outcompeting the Karenia.

POSSIBLE THERAPEUTIC TREATMENTS TO BLOCK THE ACTION OF PLANT AND BACTERIAL TOXINS: YEAR TWO
Mansfield Nello Burlingame
Lake Brantley High School, Altamonte Springs, FL

Many toxins, including Ricin, Cholera toxin (CT), Pertussis toxin (PT), and Exotoxin-A, have an AB structure, containing a catalytic A-subunit and a cell-binding B-subunit. These toxins have cytosolic targets and must reach the cytosol in order to enact any toxic effect. Ricin, CT, PT, and Exotoxin-A use the Endoplasmic Reticulum Associated Degradation pathway to reach the cytosol. In my research I sought to find a broad spectrum antitoxin therapeutic which blocks the toxins’ path to the cytosol. 4-Phenylbutyrate (PBA) prevents protein unfolding and thus should block the unfolding of the A-subunit. Geldanamycin (GA) inhibits hsp90 function which should prevent extraction from the Endoplasmic Reticulum.<br><br>GA and PBA were added to cells in the presence of Exotoxin-A, Ricin or CT. GA and PBA were effective in blocking Exotoxin-A and CT, but not Ricin. These results support the conclusion that GA only inhibits ADP Ribosylating toxins because both Exotoxin-A and CT use ADP Ribosylation, and Ricin does not. These results were confirmed using Surface plasmon resonance, which showed that in the presence of GA, hsp90 could not bind to the ADP Ribosylating PT. The conclusion that PBA only inhibits toxins that unfold spontaneously is supported because CT unfolds spontaneously, but Ricin does not. Circular Dichroism spectroscopy was performed on PT both in the absence and presence of PBA. This test confirmed that PBA has a stabilizing effect on the spontaneously unfolding PT. My research supports the conclusion that blocking the path to the cytosol can prevent some toxin mediated diseases.

CAN IT CHANGE? CHARACTERIZING PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA MORPHOLOGY VARIANTS AND REDUCING BACTERIAL VIRULENCE WITH A BIOFILM INHIBITOR
Jeremy C Hsiang
Niceville High School, Niceville, FL

Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections can be difficult to treat. Part of the reason is its ability to form biofilm in body tissue. This is especially true for cystic fibrosis patients, whose infections are associated with small-colony variants (SCVs), a subgroup of Pseudomonas that is more virulent and associated with higher mortality rates.<br><br> Antibiotic sensitivity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from a local hospital was analyzed. The ratio of antibiotic-sensitive to resistant strands varied between isolates of bronchial wash, skin infections, and ear infections. The highest percentage of resistance (72% for levofloxacin and 39% for ceftazidime, respectively) was observed in bronchial wash isolates. <br><br> <br><br> Morphology variation was observed from Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates of bronchial wash, skin infection, and ear infection. Bronchial wash isolates tended to be more translucent and more viscous/mucoid.<br><br> Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from bronchial wash formed more autoaggregates in tissue culture media than those from skin infections and ear infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from bronchial wash formed biofilms more rapidly in the first 24 hours and reached plateau in 36 hours.<br><br> Hydrogen peroxide was able to completely eliminate Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation from all three isolates. The biofilm was eliminated within three minutes to exposure.<br><br> Antibiotic-sensitive Pseudomonas aeruginosa did not become antibiotic-resistant against tested antibiotics when growing in their biofilm state in an in-vitro bacteria culture condition. This indicates that other factors, such as constant sublethal doses of antibiotic exposure, are needed for the acquisition of antibiotic resistance.<br><br> The sites of infection and morphology variation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa may predetermine its virulence.

THE 5 SECOND RULE: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF TIME FOOD SPENDS ON A KITCHEN FLOOR AND THE RISK OF INFECTION SHOULD IT BE EATEN
Zachary A. Gooch
F.W. Springstead High School, Spring Hill, FL

The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the "Five Second Rule," which states that should food be dropped on the ground, it is safe to pick the food up within five seconds, and eat it without risk of infection. To conduct this experiment, three consistencies of food (hard, soft, and moist) were dropped on the floor at 6 five second intervals, starting with 5 seconds, and ending with thirty seconds. After time was completed, the food was picked up with sterilized forceps to avoid further contamination. There was a zero second control to determine whether the food had already been contaminated. The foods used were peppermint candy (hard), bread (soft), and apple slices (moist). The food was used to streak agar plates which were placed in a CO2 incubator for 48 hours. After 48 hours, the plates were examined for growth of bacterial colonies. 50% of all peppermint trials showed an increase in the amount of bacteria after it had been dropped on the floor. 60% of all bread trials showed an increase in the amount of bacteria after it had been dropped on the floor. The apple trials yielded inconclusive data due to heavy bacterial growth on the zero second controls. There was no direct correlation to time spent on the floor and bacterial growth. However, based upon the data, it is not advisable to eat off the floor, regardless of how long the food has been there.

FIGHTING SUPERBUGS: VALIDATING DISINFECTANTS
Rosemary Tamsin Watkinson Halfyard
The Cavendish School, Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, UNITED KINGDOM

Bio Products Laboratory (BPL) is a research and manufacturing organisation that produces a range of medicinal products derived from blood plasma. I helped to develop a validation process for BPL’s microbiology department to monitor and maintain standards of cleanliness within the production cycle. <br><br>The purpose of validation was to ensure that BPL’s use of disinfectants is both necessary and effective; if ineffective, it can be assumed that various classes of microorganism would be found within cleaning fluids recovered from the production areas. My task was to determine whether this was true or not by devising a method of neutralising the disinfectants sufficiently to allow microbial colonisation. <br><br>I undertook extensive reading and research of the microorganisms and disinfectants being tested, as well as equipment and materials used. <br><br>Each method involved making up a test sample of disinfectant to which microorganisms were added. All samples were then incubated.<br><br> <br><br>Results were obtained by counting the number of microbial colonies from each sample. These were compared to both positive and negative control samples. If the survival rate of each microbe species was between 50 and 200% of the positive controls then the validation method was deemed successful.<br><br>Perhaps reassuringly, due to their potency only one of the four disinfectants produced ‘successful’ results, despite trying three different methods of neutralisation.<br><br>Although the aim of the project was not met, the disinfectants used at BPL were demonstrated to be extremely effective by the fact that it was so difficult to neutralise them.

DID YOU WASH YOUR HANDS TODAY?
Lauren Marie Cook
Spalding High School, Griffin, GA

The purpose of my experiment was to test three different anti bacterial solutions to determine which was the most effective. The solutions were Betadine, Germ-X, and liquid soft soap. The controlled variable was distilled water. The human subjects placed a hand in a Petri dish filled with nutrient agar. Next the human subject’s hands were treated with Betadine, Germ-X, a mixture of 75% water and 25% soft soap, or distilled water. A sterile bandage was provided to dry hands. The subjects again placed a hand in a different Petri dish filled with nutrient agar. The test was repeated many times on different days to provide accuracy. The Petri dishes were taken to a lab and cultures were grown. Different tests were performed on the bacteria, as shown in the procedures portion of the paper. The conclusion was; out of the three solutions and the control, all killed some bacteria but the Betadine worked the most effectively.

THE EFFECT OF ELEVATED LEVELS OF CARBON DIOXIDE ON PLANT BACTERIA
Carl Edwin McManus
Titusville High School, Titusville, FL

In this project, I tested the effects of adding elevated levels of carbon dioxide on two plant-associated bacteria. Acetobacter aceti is known to be a pathogen of crop plants, and Rhizobium leguminosarum is important as a nitrogen-fixing bacteria. This project was done because of the interest in global warming and the effects that global warming will have on the environment. The null hypothesis was that there would be no difference in the growth of the bacteria in elevated CO2 levels. The alternative hypothesis was that there would be a significant different in their growth.<br><br> I inoculated ten petri dishes of each of the bacteria on their respective preferred agars, then placed half in a twenty gallon aquarium, sealed airtight with a piece of lexan and duct tape. Then I raised the carbon dioxide ten percent in the chamber using a gas pack and incubated the plates for 48 hours. Plates were then sealed and counted using gridded squares. <br><br>Average plate coverage for the A. aceti control group was 10.2 cm2 and for the experimental group the average was 17.6 cm2. Average plate coverage for the R. leguminosarum control group was 26.8 cm2 and for the experimental group the average was 30cm2. Data was analyzed using a t-test. For the R. leguminosarum the p-value was 0.027 and for A. aceti the p-value was 0.028 so the alternative hypothesis was accepted. The growth was significantly different for both species in elevated carbon dioxide levels.

THE EFFECTS OF CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXINS A AND B ON PORCINE SHOWN USING LABORATORY TESTING.
Brady John Welu
Marshall High School, Milroy, MN

The main focus of my project is to make an effective way to combat Clostridium difficile and its subsequent diseases in swine. There is no vaccine for this bacterium. Therefore, based on last year’s success, I made a liquid product containing avian antibodies specific to Clostridium difficile to treat this disease.<br><br> My first step was to obtain a sample of the bacteria to work with. After I acquired this I grew it up in an anaerobe chamber to two liters. I then centrifuged the bacteria and killed the packed cell volume and the broth with formalin. To inoculate the chickens, I made an immunogen using the bacterin and the toxiod. I injected 20 chickens once a week for four weeks. Four weeks is when optimum antibody production is in effect. I took 6 of their eggs and did an E.L.I.S.A. using the eggs and the sample of Clostridium difficile I grew up. This test and a cytoxcitiy test I did went very well with significantly favorable results. I did some testing in the lab trying to replicate a pig's gut with an incubator and using Vero cells as the host. I made one product from the eggs, designed for just piglets. My next step is live pig trials, which requires a herd with active Clostridium difficile.<br><br> I am hoping that after I test my product on live animals and show that it works, to mix it with other antibodies to protect against different bacteria and potentially dangerous diseases, in an effort to make a universal pig health supplement. Each bacteria and antibody set has to be tested independently to show that it works, before making the universal supplement.

THE EFFECT OF IBUDILAST ON TAT-INDUCED TNF-ALPHA PRODUCTION
Divya Seth
Brighton High School, Rochester, NY

The primary purpose of the project was to determine whether Ibudilast (aka AV411), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor used for neuropathic pain, effectively reduces TNF-alpha production in mouse microglial cell line (BV2) exposed to the HIV-1 encoded protein Tat. Tat is thought to mediate the disease progression of HAD (HIV-associated dementia) via induced chronic inflammatory response in the central nervous system, and is released from infected microglia. Tat induces cytokines, including TNF-alpha, which produces demyelinating lesions and can cause neuronal death. <br><br><br>BV2 cells were treated with Tat alone or together with AV411 at concentrations of 50µM, 100µM, and 150µM. The experiment was run in triplicate, and lysates and supernatants were collected at 0h, 4h, 8h, and 24h. Levels of TNF-alpha present in the supernatant were measured by ELISA. A significant decrease in Tat-induced TNF-alpha production occurred in cells treated with 50µM AV411 at 8h. The experiment was repeated, using clinically relevant doses of AV411 for 8h. The results of these two experiments together show a dose-dependent effect of AV411 on Tat-induced TNF-alpha production. The possibility of AV411 inhibiting NF-KB activation as a mechanism for inhibition of TNF-alpha production was tested through immunoblot analysis and Luciferase reporter assays. Our data suggests that inhibition of TNF-alpha production by AV411 involves NF-KB independent processes. The results from this project underscore the therapeutic potential of AV411 in context to HAD.

REVERSING RESISTANCE: EVALUATING THE ANTIMICROBIAL EFFECTS OF FLAVONOID EXTRACTS ON REVERSING RESISTANCE TO OXACILLIN
James Evan Fenska
Miami High School, Miami, OK

Bacterial infections and the development of multi-drug resistant bacteria strains continue to pose a significant risk for human populations. The increases in MRSA (Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus), E. coli, and other infectious bacteria outbreaks and their increasing antibiotic resistance has led to a renewed interest in researching novel traditional antimicrobial treatments. Over 90% of Staphylococcus aureus strains are B-lactamase positive and thus resistant to B-lactam antibiotics. B-lactamase cleaves the B-lactam ring of several antibiotics and renders them ineffective. Additionally, strains of MRSA, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, owe their resistance to the expression of the mecA gene which modifies the penicillin-binding proteins PBP2A, which promotes the formation of the bacterial cell wall in the presence of antibiotics. This project evaluates the antimicrobial properties of flavonoid extracts and the ability of flavonoids to reverse resistance to oxacillin. Anthocyanin, propolis, green tea extract, grape seed extract, and red wine bioflavonoids were evaluated. The procedures included the preparation of 1% flavonoid extracts and the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion test to determine the inhibitory response of E coli, S. aureus, and two clinicial isolates of MRSA. Resistance of each bacteria to oxacillin was determined using a novel E-Test™ procedure (AB biodisks). The MIC and the sub-inhibitory dosage of the flavonoid extracts were determined by serial dilution. Sub-inhibitory doses of flavonoids were used to enhance Mueller-Hinton Agar to determine if the flavonoids would reduce the resistance to oxacillin using E-test™ strips. Results suggest that green tea extract, grape seed extract, and red wine bioflavonoids significantly inhibited the growth of the selected bacteria (ANOVA p < 0.00001). Grape seed extract, red wine flavonoids and green tea showed promise in reversing resistance to oxacillin in the S. aureus and MRSA strains tested.

HOW CLEAN IS YOUR SHOWER?
Nicholas Charles Frohlich
John Jay High School, San Antonio, TX

Since the mid-1800s bacterial biofilms have been studied as isolated liquid cultures. However, removing bacteria from their real environment isn’t an appropriate way to study biofilms since liquid cultures don’t mimic the physical and nutrient status of a complex ecosystem. Biofilms affect us world wide limiting our daily activities and causing various diseases harmful to humans. <br><br>The purpose of this study is to determine to what extent biofilms grow in a shower, which location is most favorable for growth, and what is the best method of killing biofilm bacteria. To monitor native growth of bacterial biofilms, the student researcher strategically placed tiles with and without grout or caulking in a household shower. Tiles were removed at weeks three and five for observation by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Staining biofilms with the LIVE/DEAD BacLight Bacterial Viability Kit enabled collection of three-dimensional data sets to assess biofilm thickness on the different substrates, to determine the area of the shower most favorable for biofilm growth and to monitor the efficiency of cleaning solutions. <br><br>Analysis of the data revealed that plain tiles were the most favorable environment for growth (week 5, tile, 30.8 microns thick, grout 25.2 microns thick, caulking 23.6 microns thick). Biofilms grew best in wet corners of the shower floor. The most effective agent to kill bacteria in mature biofilms was Clorox bleach.<br><br>In conclusion the tiles had the most amount of growth. The drain had the greatest biofilm thickness, and the bleach killed the most percentage of the biofilm.

ISOLATING A NOVEL ANTIBIOTIC FROM BACILLUS FLEXUS, A BACTERIUM FOUND IN THE HUMAN MICROBIOME
Andrew James Macgregor
Butte High School, Butte, MT

<br><br> Antibiotics, such as Penicillin and Bacitracin, were discovered in microbes. The human microbiome is a prime example of a habitat for such microbes, as there are many different species of microbes which occur naturally in the body. These microbes can protect us from pathogens. <br><br><br> The aim of this project is to isolate an antibiotic from an almost completely unresearched bacterium, Bacillus flexus, that was previously isolated from human earwax. In prior phases of this project, B. flexus displayed antibiotic activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Candida tropicales. A chemical - as opposed to biological - basis of the observed activity was established, meaning that B. flexus does produce an antibiotic. Processes for the isolation of the active chemical were started. <br><br><br> This year, bioassay guided fractionation, the standard isolation scheme of natural products chemists which alternates chromatography and biological testing, was used to continue the isolation. Organic extracts from large B. flexus broth fermentations were applied to three different different kinds of column chromatography to separate the complex extracts into fractions. Silica gel and C-18 columns separated based on polarity; TSK gel columns separated based on molecular size. At the end of each stage of chromatography, the resulting fractions were examined using nuclear magnetic resnonance (NMR) spectroscopy and were tested for activity against S. pneumoniae. Fractions exhibiting antibiotic activity were carried on to further stages of chromatography. Recurring patterns in collected NMR spectra now suggest that there are at least two different peptidal antibiotics produced by B. flexus. <br><br>

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF S2 PYOCINS AND OXIDATIVE STRESS IN COMBATING PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA BIOFILM DEVELOPMENT
Lindsey Elizabeth Hastings

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative opportunistic pathogen that commonly infects people with suppressed or compromised immune systems. The high mutability of P. aeruginosa’s 6.3 Mbp genome allows it to rapidly develop resistance to antibiotic treatment, making it difficult to eliminate infections in patients with resistant strains. A possible alternative or complement to antibiotic treatment is the use of S2 pyocins in combination with hydrogen peroxide—which has been found to cause the downregulation of the S2 pyocin immunity gene and the upregulation of the S2 pyocin production gene (Bentley 2005). It was hypothesized that the introduction of dilutions of S2 pyocin with 1mM hydrogen peroxide to P. aeruginosa biofilms would result in less biomass and an increase in cell death. Static biofilms were grown in 96-well microtiter plates at 37oC for 1 hr. and then pulsed with H2O2 for 20 minutes. S2 pyocin dilutions were introduced and the biofilms were allowed to grow for 24 hrs. Biofilms were stained with 1% crystal violet and analyzed using a spectrophotometer with an O.D. set at 570 nm. Non-static biofilms were grown for 16 hours at 37oC before the introduction of the S2 pyocins and 1mM H2O2. Biofilms were then allowed to grow for an additional 16 hours. The biofilms were visualized using dye and microscope assay. Data analysis was performed using Comstat and MatLab. Results showed that the addition of hydrogen peroxide to S2 pyocin dilutions significantly reduced the total biomass and increased the percentage of dead biomass when compared to controls.

THE EFFECT OF SUGAR (SUCROSE) AS A NATURAL PRESERVATIVE IN COMPARISON TO ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER (SACCHARIN) ON THE GROWTH OF BACTERIA IN FOOD
Amy Lee Bischoff
Ballard High School, Louisville, KY

To determine the least concentration of sucrose needed to prevent bacterial growth, specifically in unpasteurized milk, and how saccharin compares to sucrose in this aspect, was the purpose of this scientific experiment. It was expected that the higher the concentration of solute, the less bacteria would grow, and sucrose would be more effective than saccharin at inhibiting bacterial growth. Sucrose and saccharin were added to unpasteurized milk in specific quantities to create sucrose-milk and saccharin-milk solutions of various concentrations. Both sets were placed in a refrigerated environment. A sample was obtained from each solution after one, seven, and fourteen days, and inoculated onto individually labeled agar plates. The number of bacterial colonies was then counted after 24 hours of incubation. The expectation that higher concentrations of solute would be most effective was demonstrated in the results as accurate. 30% was the lowest effective concentration of both sucrose and saccharin. Contrary to the anticipated results, saccharin proved as effective as sucrose as a food preservative. The difference in efficiency of the two solutes was not significant according to the t Test results. So, both sucrose and saccharin act as food preservatives, and they are nearly equally effective.

ISOLATING AN ANTI-CANCER COMPOUND FROM THE ACID MINE WASTE FUNGUS TRICHODERMA VIRENS
Daoning Zhou
Butte High School, Butte, MT

Secondary metabolites produced by the acid mine-waste fungus Trichoderma virens have shown potential as anticancer compounds based on their activity in signal transduction enzyme inhibition assays and brine shrimp lethality assays. In an initial pilot it was shown that when grown in a variety of microbial broths, different secondary metabolites were produced by a single fungus. These compounds can be extracted, purified and then tested for bioactivity. The growth conditions that generated the most activity were used to cultivate a large broth culture which was thoroughly extracted and retested to insure it maintained activity. The chloroform extract was applied to a normal phase silica gel column and the resulting fractions were tested for bioactivity. The most active fraction is further resolved with different chromatographic systems that separate compounds based on the size or polarity of the various compounds. Finally, each compound is examined using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to begin the process of structure elucidation.

ARE YOU LEAVING YOUR LOCAL SUPERSTORE WITH MORE THAN THE ITEMS YOU PURCHASED?
Andrew Vincent Gearhart
Savannah Arts Academy, Savannah, GA

The purpose of this research project was to determine what, if any, bacteria could be found throughout a local superstore: on the grocery car handle and seat, on unwrapped produce, on the handle of the frozen food section door, and the bathroom door. Sterile swabs were used to gather the samples from each of the surfaces. The streak plate method of isolation was chosen to help identify what types of bacteria were found throughout the superstore. The samples were applied to the agar using zigzag inoculation. Four sterile plates remained free from exposure to serve as this study's control. The plates were then placed upside down on a solid surface, and moved to a dark area to incubate. Daily recordings of visible growth from each plate were documented for the period of one week. After one week was completed, sufficient growth was noted, and the petri dishes were taken to a local lab to count the colonies using a Quebec Colony Counter. The raw produce, with the highest amount of growth, grew an average that exceeded 300 bacterial colonies, which is stated as "too numerous to count", the raw produce also grew an average of 2 fungal colonies. The group that grew the least amount of bacteria, other than the control group, was the grocery cart handle, with an average growth of 3.25. One of the frozen food door handle plates was chosen to do a simple stain, on which Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Actinomycetes were found.

DETECTING THE MALARIA PARASITE PLASMODIUM FALCIPARUM
Andrew Ken Stridiron
Kapolei High School, Kapolei, HI

Malaria is one of the top three major infectious diseases in the world. It kills millions of people each year. Treatments are available, yet people continue to die due to false or late diagnosis. These unnecessary deaths can be prevented with a fast and accurate diagnostic test. Plasmodium parasites are transferred by infectious bites of the Anopheles mosquito. The objective of this study was to run a comparison on diagnostic tests that can be used in malaria-endemic areas. Microscopic detection in human blood smears has long been used as a gold-standard for clinical diagnosis. Alternatively, nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been used with a much higher sensitivity. Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) has also been used to detect proteins released by parasites within human serum. Nevertheless, microscopy, nested PCR and ELISA require extensive training, high-end resources and time. <br><br> Recently, the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method has been developed to detect similar microbial infections. In this study, LAMP was used to detect P. falciparum and the results were compared with traditional microscopy, nested PCR and ELISA. A total of 25 blood samples from Cameroon were obtained from consenting adults. Based on microscopy, 10 samples were negative and 15 were positive for P. falciparum. These 25 samples were coded and analyzed using nested PCR with purified DNA, corresponding serum samples for ELISA and blood for LAMP. Data showed PCR remains highly effective, but the rapids and simple detection of LAMP holds potential to become the new standard.

A STYROFOAM-DECOMPOSING BACTERIUM FROM MEALWORMS
I-Ching Tseng
National Taichung Girl's Senior High School, Taichung, Taiwan, CHINESE TAIPEI

Due to the properties of waterproof, light-weigh and low-price, styrofoam is now widespread used in our daily lives. However, overuse of styrofoam caused a serious environmental problem. The observation that mealworms might be able to feed on styrofoam sparked a curiosity to answer whether mealworms could digest styrofoam, and if so, how could they remain alive. First of all, these mealworms were fed in different kinds of food to insure the mealworms can digest styrofoam. The results showed that mealworms can indeed feed on styrofoam only. The hypothesis of this study is that microbes inside the digestive tracts of mealworms are responsible for the decomposition of styrofoam. To further test this hypothesis, microbes from the digestive tracts of mealworms were cultured at 37 C in LB medium under anaerobic conditions. There were many kinds of microbes isolated. From those microbes, a kind of bacteria forming red colonies was confirmed responsible for decomposing styrofoam. The growth conditions and strain characteristics of the bacteria forming red colonies were further examined. These results imply that the red bacteria isolated from the digestive tracts of mealworms may shed light on solving the serious environmental pollution caused by styrofoam.

KEEPING IT REAL PART II: NATURAL ANTIBACTERIALS VS. PHARMACEUTICAL ANTIBIOTICS
Zachary Taylor DOrsi
Scituate High School, North Scituate, RI

In the world today, people are looking for every method in which to save money and to live healthier. One way this is possible is to gradually omit unnecessary and costly pharmaceutical antibiotics, replacing them with healthier, natural solutions. This project continues to investigate the effectiveness of natural antibacterial solutions in comparison to pharmaceutical antibiotics. In addition, the investigation of the natural antibacterial, tea tree oil will be continued. Since tea tree oil cannot be ingested, its antibacterial qualities would be useless to someone who had an internal bacterial infection. However, if tea tree oil is split up into its respective components, the effective components may be able to be put in an ingestible form. The procedures performed in this project include bioassays, thin layer chromatography, column chromatography, and fractional distillation. The natural substances tested in this project include tea tree oil, rosemary, and lemon. The antibiotic is Amoxicillin. The zones of inhibition of each bioassay will be measured and compared in order to determine if natural antibacterial solutions are as effective as pharmaceutical antibiotics in the eradication of E. coli. After the comparison of the zones of inhibition, some link was shown between the effectiveness of Amoxicillin and the effectiveness of Tea Tree Oil. It was also concluded that Tea Tree Oil’s effectiveness lies in its components with relatively high boiling points.

IDENTIFICATION OF GENES IN C. ALBICANS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO ANTIFUNGAL RESISTANCE
Shubhangi Arora
Novi High School, Novi, MI

Candida albicans causes life-threatening infections in immunocompromised and intensive care patients, and resistance to current antifungal drugs is increasing. The purpose of this investigation was to identify genes that confer resistance to three antifungal agents: aureobasidin A, rapamycin, and fluvastatin, acting on different pathways. The expected outcome would identify new drug targets, and facilitate rationale synthesis of new drugs or combinations. The hypothesis was that the overexpression of genes in the target pathway, or genes that regulate each pathway, would confer resistance specific to each drug. Gene overexpression was chosen due to its ability to investigate on a global genome scale. A library of 30,000 pooled C. albicans transformants, overexpressing any of the normal C. albicans genes on a high copy shuttle plasmid, was plated on selective concentrations of the three drugs. Resistant colonies were isolated and DNA from these resistant colonies was extracted and amplified through transformation in E. coli. The cloned gene sequences were analyzed using the online Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). Phenotypic and genotypic data suggests that the IPT1 gene, acting in the target sphingolipid biosynthesis pathway, increases resistance in C. albicans to aureobasidin A. Surprisingly, these transformants were cross-resistant to drugs (rapamycin, and fluvastatin) which act on other pathways. Other clones with resistance to one or multiple drugs were isolated. Multiple drug resistance resulting from overexpressing single genes suggests that there are regulatory links between unrelated pathways, and that identification and analysis of these cloned genes is an important strategy for understanding these new links.

THE MYSTERY OF ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE OF THERMOPHILES
Kassandra Wilson
Weber High School, Pleasant View, UT

Thermophiles are a type of bacteria that can survive the extreme temperatures of thermal hot springs. These hot springs range in temperature from 50 – 70 C. There may be present a health risk regarding the publics use of thermal hot springs. However, the purpose of this project was to test thermophiles only to determine if they are resistant to commonly used antibiotics. <br><br>Three natural hot springs were the site for bacterial collection. Samples were collected, diluted and isolated. Once the bacteria were isolated, they were incubated in a nutrient broth for 48 hours at 55 C. Following this, 2 ml of the liquid was spread onto nutrient agar Petri dishes. Presoaked disks containing the antibiotics Bacitracin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, and Vancomycin were then placed onto the Petri dish. The samples were incubated for 48 hours at 55 C and then analyzed. <br><br>The amount of resistance was determined by measuring the zone of inhibition in millimeters. Overall, the experiment suggests that thermophiles are unable to resist ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, and Vancomycin. The zone of inhibition for these antibiotics ranged from 20.8 to 32.9 mm. However, thermophiles were resistant to the antibiotic Bacitracin, which had a zone of inhibition of 6 mm.<br><br>The results of this project suggest that thermophiles are not resistant to antibiotics. However, thermophiles can withstand extreme temperatures and different environments as long as the temperature remains unchanged. I believe that there is still a hidden potential for these bacteria that deserves future research.

NATURAL ESCHERICHIA COLI 0157:H7 INHIBITORS: A FUTURE INNOVATION IN FOOD SAFETY
Abbey Elaine Thiel
Isabel High School, Isabel, SD

This project examined naturally antimicrobial herbs and spices, specifically cinnamon, cloves, and garlic, to find which most effectively inhibits the growth of Escherichia coli. It also created packaging to aid in the reduction of this illness-causing strain. <br><br>I created five batches of packaging using the same method. The first batch of packaging contained only tomato puree and was used as my control group. It was tested against four experimental batches. I added one spice, either garlic powder, ground cloves or ground cinnamon, individually to the next three respective batches. The fourth batch contained a combination of the three spices as well as tomato puree. All of these spices possess antimicrobial properties in addition to health benefits for consumers. <br><br>I predicted the batch of plastic containing the combination of all three spices would most effectively inhibit the E. coli growth. When analyzing the individual spices, I predicted garlic would decrease the most bacteria. <br><br>Agar was warmed, poured in the plates, non-pathogenic E. coli obtained from a scientific supply company was swabbed onto the plates, and the created packaging was cut and placed in the plates. This strain of E. coli was used to model the growth of pathogenic strain E. coli 0157:H7. The plates were put into the incubator and the growth was observe. I created another set of plastic using the same process. This time, the zone of inhibition of bacteria growth was measured. Cloves most effectively reduce E. coli growth, followed by the combination of all three spices, cinnamon, garlic, and the control batch.

ANALYZING GROWTH OF FACULTATIVE ANAEROBE BACILLUS SUBTILIS UNDER MICROAEROPHILIC CONDITIONS
Christina Kun Wang
Shanghai American School, Shanghai, CHINA

Until recently, Bacillus subtilis was characterized as a strict aerobe; studies concluding the bacterium’s ability to metabolize nitrate under anaerobic conditions found that this was not the case. This experiment analyzed the growth of Bacillus subtilis under microaerophilic conditions established by broth without aeration to test the establishment of the bacterium as a facultative anaerobe. Based on the definition of a facultative anaerobe, it was hypothesized that lag phase and doubling times under microaerophilic conditions would be between the lag times and doubling times reported under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and that the highest amount of viable organisms reached in the stationary phase would be lower than that under aerobic conditions. Similar sized individual colonies from a streak plate were inoculated into nutrient broth and the time it took for the broth to reach turbidity as established by a turbidity standard were recorded. The doubling time was calculated through dilution plating and colony counting. Samples of nutrient broth after 24, 36 and 48 hours were plated to record the highest amount of viable organisms at the end of the stationary phase; two temperatures of 30 and 37 degrees Celsius were tested. Recorded lag times and doubling times were longer than times reported under similar experimental setups. The stationary phase population reached levels similar to experiments carried out under aerobic conditions

CAVITY CURES? A STUDY INTO MATERIALS LIKELY TO PREVENT GROWTH OF THE CAVITY CAUSING BACTERIA STREPTOCOCCUS MUTANS, PART II
Lauren Ashlee Hoffman
Marysville High School, Marysville, MI

The purpose of this experiment was to find which material inhibited the growth of the cavity-causing bacteria Streptococcus mutans the most. As a result of experimentation last year, I also attempted to sterilize all materials.<br><br> I first made up the wasabi, broccoli, cinnamon extract, clove, and zinc citrate solutions. Then, all solutions and agar were autoclaved for 20 minutes. The agar was allowed to cool. I then inoculated the agar with the Streptococcus mutans. The Petri dishes were filled with enough agar to cover the bottom. This was allowed to set. I then placed the wasabi disks on a total of 5 plates, and followed the same procedure for the broccoli, cinnamon extract, clove, and zinc citrate solutions. The Petri dishes were then incubated at 37°C. After 96 hours, I then measured the area of no growth around each disk. All materials were autoclaved prior to disposal. <br><br> The zone of inhibition around the broccoli was unable to be determined because it brought in a microorganism and was therefore contaminated. The clove had a zone of inhibition of 5.75 millimeter, while the zinc citrate had a halo of 4.62 millimeters. The cinnamon extract had an average halo of 0.85 millimeters and the wasabi had an average zone of inhibition of 0 millimeters. <br><br> Therefore, the clove solution most effectively inhibited the growth of the cavity-causing bacteria Streptococcus mutans. Additionally, the autoclave seemed to control contamination in the majority of solutions, the only solution in which contamination was observed was broccoli.

GROWTH OF THE AMPHIBIAN PATHOGEN BATRACHOCHYTRIUM DENDROBATIDIS IN RESPONSE TO THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF AQUATIC ENVIRONMENTS
Scott Paul Boisvert
Basha High School, Chandler, AZ

Chytridiomycosis, a disease caused by the amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, is a major threat contributing to amphibian population decline worldwide. This research evaluated how the water chemistry of aquatic environments affects the growth of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. Water samples were collected from major Arizona watersheds, representing documented amphibian habitats. In Phase I, bioassay experimentation measured optical density over time, indicating the fungus’ growth within each water sample. Chemical analyses including Ion Chromatography (IC) and Ion-Coupled Plasma Spectrometry (ICP) were conducted to identify components of the water chemistry. A stepwise multiple regression analysis at a 0.1 significance level was used to isolate the factors significant to Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis growth in relation to the chemical analyses for each water site, identifying eleven elements that affect Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. To establish real-world significance, bioassay experimentation in Phase II evaluated solutions containing these identified elements for their effects on growth. In conclusion, water from the amphibian habitats tested had a statistically significant effect on the growth of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. Differing growth responses were observed dependant upon the chemical composition of the aquatic environment sampled. This project furthers the understanding of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis’ growth behavior in response to its aquatic environment, providing insight into triggers facilitating its growth and potential inhibitors, working to promote a solution for its eradication.

WHICH ANTISEPTIC WORKS BEST ON ESCHERICHIA COLI.
Nancy Kay Maleno
Greenfield High School, Greenfield, MA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine which antiseptic works best on E. coli. We live in an age where micro-organisms are becoming more and more resistant to the common detergents, soaps and antiseptics. A major concern today is whether every-day antiseptics are still effective combating common bacteria or are these micro-organisms becoming more resistant.<br><br> <br><br> Escherichia coli(E.coli) is a bacterium found in the colon of warm blooded organisms, producing vitamin K, which is needed for blood clotting and food absorption. Antiseptics are used to prevent the growth of bacteria on a location such as an open cut on the skin. Antiseptics are prepared in many different forms from creams to liquids. This investigation involves the application of four different commonly used antiseptics, hydrogen peroxide, iodine, isopropyl alcohol and bleach.<br><br> In this case four antiseptics were tested to see which would best prevent the growth of the E. coli on nutrient agar. Four dishes of each antiseptic were prepared. Each dish had only one type of antiseptic. Four small disks were constructed from filter paper and placed into the dishes containing one of the antiseptics. Traditional microbiological techniques were used to observe the development of a plaque around each of the antiseptic discs. The more distant the plaque, the more effective the antiseptic. Distances were easily measured using transparent metric rulers.<br><br> From the results it was concluded that the iodine and the hydrogen peroxide performed best at maintaining the zone of inhibition. The bleach and the isopropyl alcohol were much less effective.

SYNTHESIS OF THIAZOLINE-BASED COMPOUNDS AS POSSIBLE ANTIBACTERIAL AGENTS
Lauren Marie Jessup
Marian High School, Mishawaka, IN

Thiazoline is a heterocyclic compound that contains one sulfur and one nitrogen atom and a single double bond. Thiazoline-based compounds have been synthesized in the past to treat hemochromatosis; however, this is one of the first time that thiazoline based compounds have been tested to observe antibacterial properties. In order to do this, a thiazoline-based core compound was synthesized by reacting cystine and benzonitrile. Next, the core (parent) compound was chlorinated to form an acid chloride. Then, this reactive intermediate (acid chloride) was then coupled with another substituent (“tail”) in order to increase the compound’s reactivity to bacteria; this new compound was named ND-009310. The resulting compounds were then tested by agar diffusion assay against bacteria to see if the thiazoline-based compounds are effective at killing harmful bacteria. Some of the bacteria that the thiazoline-based compounds have been tested against are Staphylococcus aureus ATCC11632, Escherichia coli X580, Pseudomonas aeruginosa K799/WT, Pseudomonas aeruginosa K799/6, Mycobacterium vaccae IMET 10670, Micrococcus luteus ATCC 10240, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633. The results of the assays proved that ND-009310 proved to be effective at killing Escherichia coli X580, Pseudomonas aeruginosa K799/WT, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633. Therefore, through this research, it has been proven that thiazoline-based compounds can be synthesized and these compounds are reactive against bacteria. Research is currently ongoing, and the thiazoline-based compounds are currently being oxidized so that the compounds will have a thiazole-base to see if this increases the compounds reactivity to bacteria.

HOW DOES TIME AFFECT THE POTENCY OF TETRACYCLINE?
Tanisha Lynea Howard
West Side High School, Gary, IN

This project is the result of microbiological experimentation on the potency of Tetracycline. The initial idea was to determine how long it would take Escherichia coli to overcome the zone of inhibition when exposed to Tetracycline. The rapid decrease of the zone of inhibition led to use of Escherichia coli as the test bacteria. It was hypothesized that the potency of the antibiotic would decrease over time.<br><br><br>The antibiotic's potency was measured by measuring the bacteria's zone of inhibition. Effectiveness was determined by the lack of bacteria growth around the antibiotic when measured at 12 hour intervals.<br><br>At the conclusion of this experiment, the antibiotic had not lost its potency. It has also been observed that the zone of inhibition had not decreased, and in some cases, increased.<br><br> <br><br>The practical applications of this project are that a medically prescribed course of treatment for bacterial infections must be closely followed to insure effectiveness. Over time an antibiotic can increase its effectiveness.

THE EFFECT OF UV-C RADIATION ON THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF ESCHERICHIA COLI TO ANTIBIOTICS
Michael Tri-Minh Nguyen
Lehman Catholic High School, Sidney, OH

In the news today, there have been many cases in which people have gotten sick from contaminated foods. Many of these cases dealt with a bacteria that is very natural to human beings; however in some cases this bacteria can be very harmful to humans. This bacteria is none other than Escherichia Coli. Escherichia Coli is a gram-negative bacteria and some strains of E. Coli can be highly deadly to humans. This project is based around E. Coli’s susceptibility to the antibiotics Ampicillin, Gentamicin, Erythromycin, and Tetracycline. However this project is unique because not only does it deal with E. Coli’s susceptibility to these antibiotics, but it primarily deals with the effect of UV-C radiation on the susceptibility of E. Coli to these antibiotics. UV-C radiation is short wave radiation that is emitted naturally from the Sun but is absorbed by the Earth’s atmosphere and thus does not penetrate into the earth. UV-C radiation also has a very noticeable effect on the DNA structure. When E. Coli is exposed to UV-C radiation, the DNA structure breaks apart from its complementary strand and kinks. Thus when the DNA polymerase comes through the DNA is destroyed. That is the effect of UV-C radiation by itself. This project will look at the effect of UV-C radiation on the susceptibility of E. Coli to antibiotics, combining the aspects of susceptibility and effectiveness of radiation as a germicidal.

A MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETIC STUDY OF ARCHAEA FROM A MUSKEG IN SOUTHEAST ALASKA
Stephanie Anne Thompson
Mount Edgecumbe High School, Sitka, AK

The Tongass National Forest’s 17 million acres make it the largest national forest and a large carbon sink. Wetlands account for 76% of naturally-emitted methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, and approximately 25% of the Tongass is wetland. Crenarchaea and methanogenic archaea are known to be present in peatlands, but the Southeast Alaska muskegs are poorly characterized. With traditional phylogenetic analyses using PHYLIP software, this study illustrates the evolutionary relatedness of crenarchaea and euryarchaea DNA sequences from a Southeast Alaska muskeg and how they relate to species from other habitats. Working to determine microbial species will aid in understanding the role of microbes in the Tongass and their relationship to climate change and the carbon cycle. I hypothesized I would find crenarchaea of the FFSB clade and euryarchaea related to the Methanosarcinales family. Only a few crenarchaea samples showed relation to FFSB and boreal soil samples and only one euryarchaea sample showed any relation to known, cultured species, but not of the Methanosarcinales family. In both trees, sample sequences formed a large grouping unrelated to any reference sequences tested. Results from the crenarchaea BLAST similarity search returned as highly related sequences from the GenBank database as are currently available, and no muskeg samples were related to sequences selected from such results, suggesting a clade that is, so far, unique to the muskeg sample site.

HOW DOES THE BIOTOWER TREATMENT AFFECT E. COLI LEVELS IN WASTEWATER?
Whitney Heileson
Clearfield High School, Clearfield, UT

Biotowers, used to convert carbon forms in water treatment plants reduce E. coli levels as well. E. coli, introduced into the human blood stream from contaminated water, causes fatal problems such as septicemia. The purpose of the experiment was to determine if there was opportunity for scientific advancement in this area of wastewater treatment. It was hypothesized that the E. coli counts would decrease after the Biotower treatment. Samples were taken from different locations at the North Davis Sewer District wastewater treatment plant and were tested for coliforms and E. coli. Tests were taken repeatedly throughout a day and studies were continued for an additional three weeks. Samples were incubated for approximately twenty-four hours after being taken down to a 1% dilution, nutrient addition, and sealing. The wells that produced a yellow color indicated positive for coliforms, and those that glowed under ultraviolet light showed positive for E. coli. The hypothesis was supported. Through use of Biotowers, the E. coli decreased from an average of 1,510,600 mpn down to 46,340 mpn. The results demonstrated that the effects of the Biotower treatment were much more varied than was expected. It was found that E. coli traveled in flocs, bacterial colonies, in the water rather than dispersed. It was when these flocs settled out that the mpn counts decreased significantly. If these bacterial solids are settled out earlier in the wastewater treatment process, the efficiency of the overall treatment could be greatly improved.

ANTIBIOTICS FROM EGGS OF THE SPIDER PHONEUTRIA NIGRIVENTER
Ivan Lavander Candido Ferreira
Colégio Guilherme Dumont Villares, São Paulo, SP, BRASIL

The proliferation of infectious diseases is an important problem to human health. Inappropriate use of antibiotics brings the appearance of bacterial strains resistant to conventional drugs, which means that research is necessary to identify new molecules as alternatives to the currently used drugs. The study of antimicrobial peptides may be advantageous for human use, because its action is faster than conventional antibiotics. Many studies have identified antimicrobial peptides in several species. One example is the gomesin, an antimicrobial peptide isolated from the hemocytes of the spider Acanthoscurria gomesiana, which possesses a high spectrum of activity against many microorganisms. Lysozymes have been identified in eggs of some species; 14kDa molecules with antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria and yeast. Studies on spider silk pointed to the possibility of antimicrobial activity, but no researches reported antimicrobial activity from the spider eggs. Therefore, my objective was to purify and characterize some antimicrobial molecules found in the eggs of Phoneutria nigriventer. In order to do so, I used liquid chromatography, eletrophoresis and mass spectrometry techniques to isolate molecules with these characteristics. I have isolated two peptides and other two molecules with antimicrobial activity from those eggs. The peptides were active against the Gram-positive bacteria Microccocus luteus. One possible lysozyme purified was active against the yeast Candida albicans. The results showed the presence of antimicrobial molecules that probably protect the eggs against pathogens. Future analyses must be made to determine the primary structure of the molecules.

TESTING E. COLI FOR ANTIBIOTIC SUSCEPTIBILITIES
Robin Alexis Byron
Byron Homeschool, Hardin, MT

Problem<br><br>The purpose of this experiment was to find whether E. coli from the Bighorn River show resistance to commonly used antibiotics. The hypotheses include: 1) more coliforms will be found further downstream, 2) there will be more coliforms when the water level is lower, 3) E. coli will have higher levels of resistance to more commonly used antibiotics.<br><br>Procedure<br><br>Using standard water quality protocol, water samples were collected along the Bighorn River at all sites where cattle were seen near the water and all fishing accesses the first 31-miles downstream from Yellowtail Dam. E. coli were isolated using Coliscan® Easygel® and confirmed using standard EC-MUG testing. Antibiotic sensitivities were determined using standard Kirby-Bauer antibiotic testing protocol.<br><br>Results<br><br>There were increasing numbers of coliforms with greater distance downstream. The largest numbers of E. coli found at one site were found directly downstream from cattle access. Antibiotic resistance patterns are as follows: Amoxicillin/Clavulanic: 11%; Ampicillin: 17%; Cefazolin: 6%; Nitrofurantoin: 6%; Tetracycline: 44% resistance and 50% intermediate.<br><br>Conclusions<br><br>E. coli and coliform concentrations did increase further downstream, but decreased with lower water levels. The highest level of antibiotic resistance was found with Tetracycline.

MULTI RESISTANCE = MULTI TREATMENT? ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDES AS THE FUTURE WEAPON AGAINST MULTI-RESISTANT PATHOGENIC BACTERIA
Cecilia Engel Thomas
Ordrup Gymnasium, Charlottenlund, DENMARK

During the last century humankind has benefited immensely from the discovery of antibiotics; but we have been far too short-sighted with the use of them. Unfortunately, this has lead to multi resistant pathogenic bacteria, which has very serious consequences for treatment possibilities.<br><br>One promising solution to this problem is antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). But in order not to repeat past mistakes future antibiotics must be used more sensibly and combined with other pharmaceuticals to increase the “life span” of the antibiotics.<br><br>The aim of this project is to investigate whether AMPs and conventional antibiotics have a synergistic effect and if resistance to one AMP affects sensitivity to other AMPs and conventional antibiotics.<br><br>Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a rather common bacterium, which relatively easily acquire resistance against antibiotics. To study acquired resistance it is important that the in vitro test-system for the bacteria is very close to the in vivo growth-situation - growing the bacteria as a biofilm solves this problem.<br><br>Different strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were grown as biofilms, and treated with various combinations of AMPs and conventional antibiotics.<br><br>The results show that the two types of antibiotics have a synergistic effect - most significantly on AMP resistant strains. Furthermore AMP resistant strains tested had developed sensitivity to some conventional antibiotics. <br><br>This means that treating simultaneously with AMP and conventional antibiotics would help preventing AMP resistant strains from appearing in clinical settings, thereby providing a possible method for fighting bacterial infections now and in the future.

TURMERIC: BITTER SPICE OR STRONG ANTISEPTIC?
Karthik Guruswamy Siva
Charter School of Wilmington, Wilmington, DE

Turmeric is a popular root in food and skin care products. This project aimed to determine the lowest concentration of turmeric in water and ethanol extracts that was necessary to inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Turmeric was ground, and neat water and ethanol extracts were made. These extracts, plain water, and plain ethanol controls were spread on petri plates and then air-dried. Diluted cultures of the bacteria were spread on the petri plates and then air-dried; each combination of bacteria and extract or control was tested three times. All plates were incubated and then refrigerated to prevent overgrowth of colonies. Colonies were counted, and statistical t-tests were used to determine significance of inhibition. Water extracts did not exhibit a very significant effect on bacterial growth. However, ethanol extracts exhibited 38.6% inhibition of E. coli and absolute inhibition of S. aureus. Dilutions of the neat ethanol extract were tested in the same fashion against the bacteria. For inhibition of E. coli growth, the extract must have a concentration greater than 0.1 grams of turmeric per milliliter of ethanol. For inhibition of S. aureus, the extract must have a concentration greater than 0.04 grams of turmeric per milliliter of ethanol. Curcumin, the water-insoluble compound in turmeric that gives it the heavy yellow hue, is likely to be the active compound. Its chemical composition has functional groups resembling groups in modern antibiotics. If the antibacterial component(s) is/are isolated, an effective preventative and possibly a treatment could be made.

THE GENETIC CODE OF ANAEROMYXOBACTER DEHALOGENANS
Jimmitti Teysir
City Honors School, Buffalo, NY

Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans (Adhal) is a species of bacteria whose genome contains 4,346 protein sequences. The GC content of the third base position of all codons used in Adhal is 97%, indicating that it primarily uses the 32 codons ending in GC. Certain codons ending in A or T are not used in the most reliably identified proteins in Adhal (i.e.: ribosomal proteins), suggesting that AT-ending codons were nonsense when Adhal came into existence. Of the 4,346 proteins, 40% contained a nonsense codon, though all of these proteins could not have been misidentified. If codons with AT-endings only appear near intergenic regions, it would support our contention that they are nonsense. The genomic data for 50 random Adhal proteins containing one nonsense codon each, was analyzed. Approximately 65% of the time, the nonsense codon was located at either end of the protein, and the excised sequence deleted by the nonsense codon had a higher than typical concentration of the amino acids G, A, R, and P, a composition which usually does not form functional proteins. The nonsense codon, either acting as a defacto stop or preceding the true start codon, excised GARP-rich nonsense segments of the proteins, still leaving a viable open reading frame. From these data, we extrapolated that over 1000 postulated Adhal proteins are in fact nonsense. The results support our hypothesis that it is possible to trace the evolution of the genetic code and use this information to correct errors in genome annotation.

POEA IN THE ENVIRONMENT, YEAR III: TOXIC EFFECTS OF POEA SURFACTANT ON AND IDENTIFICATION OF BACTERIA ON EISENIA FOETIDA AND SURROUNDING SOIL
Jayton Lewis Rainey
Slaton High School, Slaton, TX

Polyethoxylated tallowamine (POEA) is a surfactant and an inactive ingredient found in the most common herbicide formulation used worldwide today to control weeds in crop production. Engineered cotton, resistant to this herbicide, is farmed in the Texas High Plains near natural water bodies called playa lakes. Eisenia foetida is an important species in this ecosystem, and they are affected by POEA. <br><br> In this study, bacteria on Eisenia foetida and in surrounding soil were used to examine toxic effects of three POEA concentrations of 100%, 14%, and 1.4% POEA in water. Disk Diffusion test results show one bacteria susceptible at 100% concentration, and all bacteria resistant at 14% and 1.4% concentrations. Therefore, it is conclusive that toxic effects of POEA on bacteria were not the same at 100%. However, toxic effects were the same at 14% and 1.4% concentrations with all bacteria showing resistance, no zone of inhibition.<br><br> In addition, three methods were used to identify bacteria: Gram Stains, MacConkey’s agar, and Biolog Microbial Identification. Chemical Gram Stains identified two worm bacteria as Gram-positive. The remaining worm bacteria and four soil bacteria were Gram-negative. MacConkey’s agar, used as a selective growth medium, identified one worm bacteria to be Gram-positive. The remaining three worm bacteria and all soil bacteria were Gram-negative. Also, MacConkey’s agar, used as a differential growth medium, identified two bacteria lactose positive, and five bacteria lactose negative. Finally, results from a Biolog Microbial Identification test strongly identified two bacteria: Klebsiella (Raoultella) terrigena (99%) and Pseudomonas putida biotype A (100%).

ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE: BATTLE OF THE SEXES
Bea Ann Fischer
Ashley Public School, Ashley, ND

Do male or female’s fingers harbor more antibiotic resistant bacteria?<br><br> It’s a common belief that males aren’t as hygiene conscious as females. So I hypothesize the male subjects will have more antibiotic resistant bacteria on their fingers compared to the female subjects.<br><br> Obtain permission from each of your test subjects to take bacterial samples. Take a sterile applicator and swab their right thumb, place the swab into the sterile vacuatiner. Repeat this process for each finger and test subject. While wearing rubber gloves, swab the correct Petri dish with the sample. After you have spread the bacteria broth place the two antibiotics on its labeled sections of the Petri dish. Repeat this step for each test subject and each finger. Incubate the dishes for 48 hours. Remove the Petri dishes and measure the zone of inhibition for each of the antibiotics and record your data. Then incubate the dishes for an additional 24 hours and repeat the last step.<br><br> With the Azithromycin antibiotic the males had an average resistance of 14.25 mm compared to the females who had an average resistance of 11.70 mm, the total difference between the two was 2.55 mm. with the Ampicillin antibiotic the males and females had a difference of 0.25 mm, the males had a distance of 12.525 mm and the females had an average distance of 12.275 mm.<br><br> I conclude that my hypothesis was incorrect, females may be more hygiene conscious but the female test subjects had more antibiotic resistant bacteria on their fingers compared to the male test subjects.

A STUDY OF VITIS EXTRACTIONS AS PATHOGEN-SPECIFIC INHIBITORS
Rebecca Anne Asp
Hankinson Public School, Hankinson, ND

PURPOSE: To determine the efficacy of Vitis (grape) extractions as compared to antibiotics and bacteriophages. Furthermore, to analyze whether grape extractions will have a beneficial effect on human health by examining B-cell viability.<br><br>PROCEDURE: Collect Red Globe Grapes, peel the skin from the grapes, extricate the seed, and collect the vines from the grapes. Dehydrate the three grape components (seed, skin, vine). Perform extraction on the dried grape components. Obtain three types of antibiotics and two coliphages (T3 and T4r) as a basis for comparison. PLATE COLONIZATION: Analyze and count bacterial colony growth on nutrient agar. The grape extractions will be compared to antibiotics and tested on Staphylococci, Escherichia coli, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ss. bulgarius bacteria. BIOMASS: Measure growth of Escherichia coli bacteria after seven and ten days of incubation with the bacteriophages and extractions added. After growing, the broth will be filtered and the bacterial growth massed. BACTERIOPHAGE CULTURE TEST: Add bacteria, extractions, and phages to the soft agar tubes and pour onto prepared Tryptic soy agar plates OR pour soft agar tubes onto plate and after agar has set, apply bacteria culture. After incubation, the plaques and colonies will be counted on the plates according to corresponding application procedure. B-CELL ANALYSIS: Viability of B-cells, which are white blood cells and are part of the body’s immune system, was analyzed. <br><br>CONCLUSION: After a statistical analysis was preformed, it showed statistical similarities between the antibiotics and grape extractions. Overall I feel that grape extractions, especially the skin extraction, have the potential to be an asset in the medical world as it is comparable to antibiotics, specific as a bacteriophage, and finally showed to have beneficial effects on human health.

CORRELATING GENETIC SIGNATURES WITH SURFACE SUGAR EXPRESSION IN VIBRIO VULNIFICUS
Shilpa Pramod Argade
Scripps Ranch High School, San Diego, CA

Vibrio vulnificus is a gram-negative, marine bacterium responsible for gastrointestinal infections with a high mortality rate. Sialic acids (Sias) are a family of 9-carbon sugars found on glycan chains in mammals. Some pathogenic bacteria also express Sias on their cell surfaces as part of polysaccharide structures that act as virulence factors. In the Sia biosynthetic pathway, NeuB synthesizes Sia and NeuA activates Sia. <br><br> V. vulnificus has been shown to express a capsular polysaccharide. I hypothesized that V. vulnificus will express Sias. There may be a correlation between the clinical or environmental status of V. vulnificus isolates and the level of Sia expression.<br><br> Nineteen strains of V. vulnificus for which sequence data of the Sia biosynthetic genes was characterized as CMCP6-like and YJ016-like and five controls were analyzed for Sia content by DMB-HPLC. The Sia/Kdo (internal control) ratio was then calculated.<br><br> The results show that the strains with a CMPC6-like NeuA gene, many of which were clinical isolates, had high Sia expression (average = 85.59) while the strains with a YJ016-like NeuA gene had low Sia expression (average = 0.26) (p-value < 0.01). The same categories for NeuB showed no pattern. Strains from the eel had low levels of Sias. <br><br> This data shows a correlation between Sia expression and virulence potential. High levels of Sia corresponded to clinical strains, while low levels of Sia corresponded to environmental strains. Since Sias play an important role in host-pathogen interactions, drugs targeting NeuA may be an effective treatment for this and other similar infections.

CAN A BACTERIAL PIGMENT KILL CANCER CELLS? A STUDY ON THE CYTOTOXIC NATURE OF VIOLACEIN ON MELANOMA AND FIBROSARCOMA
Rakesh Ram Goli
The Altamont School, Birmingham, AL

The purpose of this project is to determine whether violacein possesses anticancer properties against two cancer cell lines. The violacein used for this experiment was extracted from Janthinobacterium lividum DSM 1522. This pigment will be tested on two cell lines of cancer, a melanoma line (B16F10) and fibrosarcoma line (2237).<br><br> The violacein was extracted and purified from the bacteria both from solid and liquid culture. After spectral analysis of the violacein for its purity, the violacein was added to the cultured cancer cells. After 24, 48, and 72 hour increments, the viability of the cancer cells was assessed through an MTT assay. <br><br> The percentage of viable cells in melanoma cell culture was: 96.1%, at 24 hours for 0.1 µM, compared to 89.6% at 72 hours. At 2 µM, percentage of viable cells was 53.4% at 24 hours, compared to 17.6% at 72 hours. The results for fibrosarcoma cells were: at 24 hours for 0.1 µM, 87.9% cells were viable, compared to 58.9% at 72 hours. At 2 µM, the percent cell viable was 47.1% at 24 hours, compared to 14.2% at 72 hours. <br><br> These preliminary studies suggest a pronounced cytotoxic effect of violacein extracted from Janthinobacterium lividum on both melanoma and fibrosarcoma cancer cell lines. There is also a dose and time dependent response of its cytotoxic property.

SUPERBUG BUSTERS II: A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE CHANGE IN ANTIBIOTIC SUSCEPTIBILITY USING MONOLAURIN, COCONUT OIL AND THE FATTY LAYER FOUND IN BREAST MILK
Jordanne Nicole Wright
Seneca High School, Seneca, MO

Antibiotic resistance is becoming one of the most pressing health epidemics. This study is a continuation of a previous year’s research which concluded that coconut oil increased the susceptibility of multidrug resistant strains of S. epidermidis collected from long-term users of broad-spectrum antibiotics for the treatment of acne. The rationale of this year’s project was to compare the effects of pure monolaurin, a monoglyceride found in coconut oil and breast milk, to coconut oil and the fatty layer in breast milk on multi-drug resistant clinical isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The bacteria were exposed to the chemicals then plated for Kirby-Baur antibiotic susceptibility testing after exposure for one generation. The monolaurin worked most effectively against S. epidermidis and completely inhibited the growth of K. pneumoniae. The coconut oil did not show very promising results, only reversing resistance of K. pneumoniae for the antibiotic ciprofloxacin. The breast milk showed significant results, reversing resistance of all three clinical isolates by large margins. Additional studies will be conducted for replication purposes and additional MDR bacteria including MRSA.

EVALUATING MUTANT ADENOVIRAL GENOME-END INTEGRITY BY POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION
Swetha Chandrasekar
Princeton High School, Princeton, NJ

Adenoviridae (double-stranded DNA viruses) cause common colds and respiratory diseases. However, mutant adenoviruses can serve as a platform for new drug development specifically for cancer therapy.<br><br>Mutant E1B55kDA-deleted adenovirusus are being used commercially in China to treat cancer. Yet, the reason behind its therapeutic success remains unknown.<br><br>It was originally thought that the mutant was unable to counteract the cellular p53 protein that induces apoptosis (suicide signals) in infected cells. But, this proposition is wrong, as recent laboratory results have proven p53’s noninvolvement.<br><br>It has been proposed that E1B55kDA protein could have some connection with the double strand break repair system, which is responsible for mending broken DNA. The problem could lie here rather than with the p53 status.<br><br>The hypothesis is the E1B55kDA protein enters the cell and counters double-strand break repair system, which would otherwise potentially damage the ends of the adenovirus genome, which are required for genome replication, hence killing the virus.<br><br>As a first step, my project focuses on developing a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay for clear observance of the adenoviral genome ends in the normal Wild Type versus the mutant Hr6, which cannot synthesize the E1B protein. The examination of these genome ends can test the validity of the double strand break repair system hypothesis – a potentially significant advancement in cancer therapy.<br><br>Through numerous trials, it was found that 52°C annealing temperature and 57°C extension temperature produced optimal results and can be used as protocol for further research in this area.

CHANGES IN SPECIFIC CELL SURFACE PROTEINS OF AZOSPIRILLUM BRASILENSE AND CONSEQUENCES ON BACTERIAL DEVELOPMENT
Taylor Wesley Jones
Alcoa High School, Alcoa, TN

Propensity for cell to cell interaction has always been mysterious. Cell clumping has major roles in biology from triggering diseases such as Alzheimer’s to the production of organic nitrogen, thus becoming important in agriculture. The aim of this study was to gain insight on the mechanisms that are conducive to cell clumping in the soil bacterium Azospirillum brasilense. Clumping by cell-to-cell interactions in this species improves its ability to survive under various conditions. Under conditions of nutritional stress and high aeration this bacterium’s cells clump, then flocculate and become capable of nitrogen fixation; which is used as a biofertilizer. The objective in this experiment was to investigate changes in cell surface properties in A. brasilense during clumping. Six different mutants of A. brasilense that were affected in their clumping abilities were compared. Profiles of outer membrane proteins produced by clumping or non-clumping cells revealed no difference. Using fluorescent lectins, a specific increase in the production of glucose/mannose-containing exopolysaccharides in clumping cells were identified. Treating clumping cells with proteases and mannose or glucose also prevented further clumping. Taken together, these results suggest that clumping is caused by the transient production of mannose/glucose exopolysaccharides that can bind to lectin-like protein(s) exposed on the surface of the cells. The application of this research is mechanistic information that can be used to improve stability and efficiency of currently available Azospirillum-based biofertilizers. Further insight into fundamental properties of cells, such as clumping, can also lead to a better understanding of medical conditions such as Alzheimer’s.

COMBINATION OF ULTRASOUND AND ANTIBIOTIC'S SYNERGY ON BACTERIA VIABILITY.
Mayank Tahilramani
Peachtree Ridge High School, Suwanee, GA

Bacterial cultures exposed to ultrasound radiation are known to show enhanced growth while Ultrasound-induced bacterial cultures treated with antibiotics show enhanced antibiotic efficiency (Rediske et al., 1998; Esing, 2001). This study calculated the efficiency of sodium hypochlorite as a bactericidal agent in ultrasound-induced cell cultures versus control cultures. Sodium hypochlorite was applied from one certain region of the bacterial colonies towards the ultrasonic transducer to determine the involvement of diffusion in the enhancements. Data was derived from the comparison of the growth rates of a set of three cultures (ultrasound and antibiotics induced, antibiotics induced, and free growth). To further explore the possibility that the diffusion of molecules in a fluid is facilitated by ultrasound as an explanation for these observations, a primitive wet-cell battery apparatus was conjured to collect potential differences between a sodium hypochlorite solution cell and a deionized distilled water cell. With a high-keratin protein membrane as a divider, measurements supported predictions of bleach diffusing through a barrier and its interaction leading to a disintegration of the uniform protein. To analyze the effects of bleach’s potency, its interaction with Keratin protein membranes was critically observed at 400x to 1000x magnification under an oil immersion microscope. This further clarified how bleach kills E. coli cells. This study provides an insight to Ultrasound’s applicability to real life problems with limited tolerance of antibiotics.

CULTURING ACIDOBACTERIA FROM MARINE SPONGES
Miera Monae Armstead
Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, Baltimore, MD

Using molecular methods, it has become evident that the diversity of the bacterial groups in marine sponges is vast. Successful culturing of bacteria makes them available for sequencing and as sources of novel bioactive compounds that may have biomedical applications. A common bacterial group found in sponges is Acidobacteria which are notoriously difficult to culture and have not yet been cultured from marine sponges. A common medium used in many experiments that cultured Acidobacteria from soils is a low nutrient medium called VL55. The goal of my experiment is to successfully culture Acidobacteria from marine sponge tissue using the VL55 medium at varying pH levels. I also did a separate experiment to examine the effect of media type on the growth of Actinobacteria from a single marine sponge. Using DNA extraction methods, PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene, and BLAST analysis, the bacterial isolates selected were identified. Although my research is still ongoing I have so far seen that there is little difference between the numbers of putative Acidobacteria grown on the VL55 medium on varying pH levels but colony morphologies in fact differ based on pH. Out of 39 putative Acidobacteria, six have been classified so far and are not Acidobacteria. However, the remaining 33 isolates are currently being identified. 10 out of 14 bacterial isolates grown on Actinobacteria -specific media were found to be Actinobacteria . Finally, I have observed that different genera of bacteria from the same marine sponge were grown on three different media types.

IRRADIATION EXTERMINATION - A PORTABLE SYSTEM TO ELIMINATE WATER-BORNE MICROORGANISMS
Kelli Ann Lynch
Blevins Junior High, Fort Collins, CO

The Irradiation Exterminator is a portable water sanitizing system designed to provide drinkable water to people without access to clean water through the utilization of ultraviolet light. All the testing was done to design a water sanitizer that was efficient with limited power consumption, to ease the conversion to solar power.<br><br> Initial testing identified the distance from a UV-C source and time exposure required to eliminate E. coli from a water sample. The data showed that one inch away, exposed for one minute was effective, giving me design parameters for my first prototype.<br><br> The first prototype consisted of plastic tubing wound around the bulb. Testing revealed that it was inefficient and took over an hour to eliminate the E. coli. A third round of testing for material selection identified that the plastic was blocking the UV-C rays.<br><br> A second design concept was tested using open trays of water. A depth of 1.5 inches left no trace of E. coli after five minutes of exposure.<br><br> The current prototype purifies over 9 gallons (34 liters) per hour, using a 17 watt UV-C light bulb. In the future, in accordance with my original design goal, I intend to use solar as the energy source, increasing the portability and applications of the system. A solar powered system could be utilized by developing countries and teams in remote locations that only have access to contaminated water.

PROBIOTIC BACTERIA: MEDICAL APPLICATIONS OF LACTOBACILLUS ACIDOPHILUS
Emily Anne Schubert
Northwestern High School, Kokomo, IN

The purpose of this project was to determine the success of Lactobacillus acidophilus in inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria that have historically developed antibiotic-resistant strains. If the invasive organisms Bacillus cereus, Serratia marcescens, and E. coli were introduced to the probiotic microflora in equal quantities, then L. acidophilus would restrict 80-90% microbial growth. Populations were checked at 24 and 48 hours by spreading 0.1mL of the inoculated broth over agar and allowing at least 24 hours to incubate. Since L. acidophilus does not grow on solid media, this test determined the % inhibited by the probiotic compared to the control. All tests were significant compared to control. The pH of the broths was used to indicate the production of lactic acid by L. acidophilus in hostility. B. cereus decreased by 1.16 pH when combined with L. acidophilus (t=4.56>t0.05=2.306), S. marcescens decreased by 1.8 pH(t=18>t0.05=2.306), and E. coli decreased by 2.26 pH(t=6.86>t0.05=2.306). The spread plates of mixed cultures after 24 hours of incubation showed significant inhibition on infectious bacteria by L. acidophilus. B. cereus lost 54% growth(t=4.10.7>t0.05=2.306), S. marcescens lost 77%(t=12.2>t0.05=2.306), and E. coli lost 61%( t=4.39>t0.05=2.306). Spread plates after 5 days of interaction showed similar rates: E. coli lost 67%, S. marcescens lost 71%, and B. cereus lost 72%, however, on average, inhibition rates were higher and more consistently around 70%. The hypothesis was partially supported. Results indicate an antibiotic response of at least 50% degradation. Current tests show the effects of hydrochloric acid on mixed cultures broths.

WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF PH AND TEMPERATURE ON ANAEROBIC RESPIRATION IN YEAST CELLS?
Toby Claire Douglas
Oxford High School, Oxford, MS

I was interested in examining how pH and temperature affect anaerobic respiration in yeast cells. Based on previous studies and research, I hypothesized that anaerobic respiration would have higher rates at a neutral pH and a temperature of 32°C. I measured the rate of anaerobic respiration by calculating the volume of carbon dioxide released in a homemade respirometer that included a closed test tube, a syringe and tubing. I examined the combinatorial effect of pH and temperature by determining the rate of respiration at four different temperatures, 27°C, 30°C 32°C, 35°C and five pH levels, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0 and 9.0. And repeated the experiment three times. The technique that was used was putting the solutions in a metal tub kept at the appropriate temperature with an aquarium heater. Each was tested for sixteen minutes with two-minute intervals to record the information needed.

ANTIBIOTIC-PRODUCING CHARACTERISTICS AND SPECIATION OF BACTERIA IN PARKS RANCH CAVE
Hee Sung Park
Carlsbad High School, Carlsbad, NM

In nutrient-deficient environments, antibiotic-producing bacteria that reduce the reproduction rate of neighboring bacteria may have a competitive advantage. Because desert caves have limited nutrient resources, it is hypothesized that bacteria present in desert caves may produce antibiotics. A study was conducted at Parks Ranch Cave, Eddy County, New Mexico to identify bacteria present in the cave and to assay the bacteria for antibiotic production. The study site receives only 27 cm of rainfall per year, thus minimal organic material and nutrients infiltrate the caves. Bacteria were obtained from standing water within the caves and were cultured on low-nutrient growth media within the cave environment. The cultured bacteria were identified using standard biochemical tests and identification flow charts and were tested for antibiotic production against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. One of the colonies found at the study site, tentatively identified as Micrococcus, exhibited an antibiotic response against E. coli. This colony will be tested for antibiotic activity against other bacteria obtained from the study site. Sequencing of PCR-amplified DNA will be performed on this colony for more accurate bacterial identification.

BACTERIA GROWTH IN GARLAND COUNTY LAKES
Kaci Brianne Dickey
Lakeside High School, Hot Springs, AR

The Purpose of this project is to calculate bacteria differences in Lake Ouachita, Hamilton, and Catherine. This project was performed due to an interest in the lakes and outdoors. If water samples are taken from these three lakes, then the bacteria count will be highest from Lake Hamilton. The results from this project should give people better understanding about bacteria in every day life. <br><br>Collecting water samples, Gram Staining, and making dilutions were the things this project covers. Water samples were taken from the Dams of Lake Hamilton, Catherine, and Ouachita. They were tested to see whether the bacteria colony was gram positive; thick cell wall, or gram negative; thin cell wall. By making dilutions it is possible to count the number of bacteria colonies per milliliter of water.<br><br>All three lakes tested different on the gram stain; Lake Ouachita tested Gram Positive, Lake Hamilton: Gram Negative, and Lake Catherine: Gram Variable. From the dilutions, Lake Hamilton’s colony count was the highest with 3,710 bacteria colonies per milliliter of water. The water sample from Lake Catherine showed that Lake Catherine had 830 bacteria colonies per milliliter, and Lake Ouachita had 1,080 bacteria colonies per milliliter. <br><br>Based on the evidence taken and bacteria count results my hypothesis was correct in which lake Hamilton did have the highest bacteria count. The data supports this conclusion with 3,710 bacteria colonies per milliliter Lake Hamilton’s count was the highest. The hypothesis stated that if water samples are taken from Hamilton, Catherine, and Ouachita then Lake Hamilton’s bacteria count would be the highest.

SWEET SUPERBUG: USING HONEY AS AN ANTIBIOTIC
Abdallah Abu-Ghazaleh
Narmer American College, New Cairo City, Cairo, EGYPT

Since their discovery in the 20th century, antibiotics have substantially reduced the threat posed by many infectious diseases, saving lives and easing the suffering of millions of people. Today this is jeopardized by the emergence of microorganism that are resistant to their first-choice antibiotic. Some bacteria even gained resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents. Trying to look for the remedy that is more effective and have minimum side-effects, this research experiments honey (of Nigella sativa ,blackseed, flower), and honey diluted in 9 different concentrations with water, and three antibiotics (vancomycin, memethicilin, and penicillin). The experiment was conducted on three Gram-positive bacteria strains of Staphylococcus aureus and three Gram-negative strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In hypothesis, honey alone and honey diluted with water in less than equal proportions would inhibit the growth of bacteria.<br><br>The bacteria were inoculated and then seeded in Petri-dishes along with honey solutions (in wells) and antibiotics. The bacterial cultures were then examined for halos, representing the inhibition zone. The diameters of the halos were measured and compared. The antibiotics’ actions varied in effectively stopping the growth of the bacteria while honey by itself showed promising results when it stopped the growth of the bacteria tested. Honey diluted with water had varying result for the six strains. The hypothesis was proven incorrect since honey diluted with water in less than equal amounts proved effective in stopping bacterial growth.<br><br>As honey proves itself as a possible antibiotic for resistant-bacteria, speculations arise of these bacteria gaining resistance to honey.

CONFIRMATION OF BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY IN TN5 MUTAGENESIS OF BURKHOLDERIA PYRROCINIA (FL728) BIOLOGICAL CONTROL AGENTS
Stephanie Page Hoskins
Lincoln Park Academy, Fort Pierce, FL

This year's study was to confirm that the antimicrobial bacillomycin, fengycin, and surfactin genes found in Bacillus subtilis (GB03) are in Burkholderia pyrrocinia (FL728) and Paenibacillus lentimorbus (FL95) to molecularly characterize these organisms to enhance methods of biological control. In phase one, multiple primer sets were used to get good amplification of the genes in GBO3. However, none of the amplicons from FL728 and FL95 were the same gene products. Even when there was a product from PCR caused by non-specific binding of the primer, the genomic sequences confirmed that the products were not the antimicrobial genes of GBO3. The negative results allowed for the identification of new genes responsible for the observed biological activity of these strains. Inhibition assays were conducted to test the three isolates against six plant pathogenic fungi. All isolates proved to be biologically active; however, FL728 was the most active and was selected for further study. Using Tn5 Mutagenesis, positive transformants were generated within the bacterial population of FL728. After the insertion of the kanamycin resistance gene with the Tn5 transposon, putative "knock-outs" were selected from kanamycin-resistant bacterial colonies. The kanamycin-resistant isolates were transferred to grid plates and screened for a loss of biological activity. Out of the 360 original mutant colonies, 15 colonies were no longer able to produce a zone of inhibition. A repeated bioassay confirmed the loss of biological control activity in the 15 mutant colonies. Identification of the insertion sites of the transposon has begun, based upon primers specific to the DNA fragments. Generation of the positive transformants allows for further characterization of the genomic sequences that encodes novel genes involved in biological control.

Miles Joseph Delahoussaye
Ovey Comeaux High School, Lafayette, LA

Microbial growth on common surfaces is a growing concern to health care facilities, schools, public facilities, and people’s homes. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to study the effectiveness of metals and alloys that might be used for common surfaces to reduce the colonization of harmful bacteria.<br><br> The metals used for the project were tin, aluminum, copper, and silver. Twenty-two alloy samples were made in combination of copper: tin, copper: aluminum, copper: tin: Silver and copper: aluminum: silver. The metals were in increments of 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 % except for silver which were only 0.01%. Prior to infecting each alloy with Staphylococcus epidermis, each sample was sanitized. Bacteria were allowed to incubate on the metal alloy for a 24 hour period. Bacteria swabs were taken from each metal alloy and streaked onto prepared agar plates. Sterile swabs were streaked for a control. After 20 and 36 hours the number of CFUs were counted and recorded. <br><br> After pretesting the effects of metals and alloys on Staphylococcus epidermis metal ions solutions were made based off of the composition of alloy samples. The ion solutions were used to treat Staphylococcus epidermis by the impregnated disk method. The zones of inhibition were measured and recorded.<br><br> A t-test was preformed using EXCEL and p-values < 0.05 were considered to be significantly different. The 80% Cu 19.99% Al 0.01% Ag sample solution showed the highest antibacterial activity toward Staphylococcus epidermis. The metal and alloys that exhibited the best antimicrobial activity were 100% copper, 99.99% copper 0.01% copper, 80% Cu 20% Sn, 80% Cu 19.99% Sn 0.01% Ag, and 60% Cu 39.99% Sn 0.01% Ag. Practical uses of this research could be applied in hospitals, schools, many public places, and people’s homes.

AN ANALYSIS OF THE DISPERSION OF BACTERIAL AEROSOLS PRODUCED BY PUBLIC TOILETS
Shereen Imad Rabie, Kristen Kylberg, Areej Rabie
Temple High School, Temple, TX

To determine the extent of bacterial dispersion from toilets in response to flushing, tryptic soy agar plates were placed in various locations throughout two school bathrooms. The angular velocity of each toilet was measured for quantitative analysis. Gram stains, hydrogen peroxide catalase testing, and identification of the shape of the microbes were used for microbe identification. It was hypothesized that the aerosol created in response to flushing the toilet would contain bacteria and that toilets with greater angular velocity would result in greater bacterial dispersion. In the women’s restroom an average of about 6.3 bacterial colonies per plate was found while the men’s produced about 4.0 bacterial colonies per plate. An absence of coliform bacteria but a presence of environmental contaminants such as a number of Bacillus species and also skin flora such as coagulase negative Staphylococcus was found; fungal species, such as Fusarium, were also present. The concept of angular velocity producing greater aerosol dispersion was supported in the women’s restroom because the highest mean number of colonies per plate was consistently found further away from the toilet and towards the sink (about 17% of the total number of colonies in the bathroom), suggesting the forward movement of the aerosol. This study indicates that while bacterial and fungal contaminants are present in school restrooms, the lack of coliforms from fecal contamination present on the media negate any serious apprehensions concerning the level of contamination. However, this study again suggests that proper hygiene is useful in protection from contamination.

C. ELEGANS AS A MODEL FOR INVESTIGATING THE EFFECTS OF ESSENTIAL OILS AS INHIBITORS OF THE QUORUM SENSING SYSTEM YEAR THREE
Kaitlin Elisabeth Joest, Nakhila Mistry, 
Keystone School, San Antonio, TX

Yearly, over 90,000 people die from bacterial infections in the U.S., with over 70% involving antibiotic-resistant strains. The purpose of this project was to provide significant amounts of data to establish the effectiveness of three essential oils (tea tree, garlic, and honey) in inhibiting the quorum sensing system (QSS) in the bacteria Xenorhabdus nematophila. Last year’s research demonstrated the oils were successful topical antiseptics as well as internal antibiotics when the model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans, was infected. This year the bacteria were tagged with a green fluorescent protein to trace their population sizes in nematode intestines. It was hypothesized that all three essential oils would be successful inhibitors of the QSS in pathogenic bacteria and that changes in bacterial population densities could be observed in GFP images.<br><br> C. elegans were exposed to bacterial cultures for four days. Then, they were transferred to plates with varying oil concentrations and plain NGM plates (controls). Survival rates of the initial generation were recorded for eight days and images of the GFP-tagged bacteria, within the nematodes, were captured.<br><br> In conclusion, these experiments reinforced that tea tree and garlic oils act as possible inhibitors of the QSS in X. nematophila. Surprisingly, honey oil produced higher mortality rates than controls; leading to speculation that the oil was too acidic. The GFP images were successful in tracing the bacterial population changes. This research introduced a new method of detecting inhibitors of the QSS. This is another step forward in determining alternative methods for treating internal bacterial illnesses.

METHODS TO REDUCE E. COLI IN KITCHEN SPONGES
Gabriela Maria Bosque, Isabel Bosque, 
Colegio Marista, Guaynabo, PUERTO RICO

Kitchen sponges have contaminated millions of Americans for years. Many people think that cleaning sponges with water and soap is enough to eliminate contamination, but many studies have been conducted to identify different methods to reduce or eliminate bacteria in kitchen sponges. This experiment studied how effective these cleaning methods can be in reducing the presence of E. coli in kitchen sponges. As part of this experiment the methods that are accessible, fast and safe will be tested. The objective is to bring safety options compatible with the daily activities and materials available in a regular home. The sponge pieces infected with E. coli were exposed to different disinfection methods for a period of two minutes; two pieces were placed in vinegar, two in a solution of 10% chlorine, two in water at room temperature with soap, two in boiling water with soap and other two pieces in a microwave.The results in this study indicate that the most effective methods to eliminate E. coli, reducing the bacteria concentration completely in kitchen sponges, is by placing the sponge two minutes in a microwave. Among the other methods tested, were the least amount of E. coli was left, was the solution at 10% chlorine with 69 CFU/ml. The conclusion was that the microwave is the easiest, cheaper and more accessible way of reducing E. coli in kitchen sponges.

WHY ARE YOU GLOWING?: ANALYSIS OF A MUTANT PLASMID
Neale Patrick Ross, Marissa Simeone, 
Mt. Hope High School, Bristol, RI

This project concerns mutations within a plasmid of a bacterium. Mutations are changes in the gene sequence in the DNA. There are various forms of mutations, including inversion, deletion, and in this experiment particularly, point mutations. This kind of change involves the alteration of one base of the genomic sequence.<br><br> This experiment was selected because of our joint interest in microbiology and genomic mutations. The goal of the project was to learn what it takes to mutate a bacterium and if it could be done by continuously re-culturing the E. coli. <br><br> To complete the process, heat shock the E. coli to insert Green Florescent Protein into the cell wall, which is turned on by an arabinose activator. After locking in the protein, culture the bacteria. Using agar streak plates with LB and Ampicillin, ensures that the arabinose activator could enter through the bacterial cell wall and cause the plasmid to glow. We next began culturing the bacteria; some grew on plates with arabinose, and others did not. After eleven generations, we took a sample of the bacteria and brought it to the Rhode Island Genomic Sequencing Center. By extracting the plasmid from the bacteria, the gene sequencer was able to record the sequence of the plasmid. With this information available, we compared the experimental sequence to the control sequence of GFP as provided by BioRad.<br><br> The sequence of the experimental plasmid differed from the control plasmid. The data showed that several mutations occurred, thereby supporting the hypothesis. This project will allow for further understanding of exactly how bacteria mutates and what is required to make these changes occur. It paves the way for further research into how point mutations develop.

THE EFFECTS OF TEA TREE OIL AND UREA ON ESCHERICHIA COLI BACTERIA COLONIES
Tamim Ahmed Shaker, Lyndsey Reich, 
Macomb Mathematics Science Technology Center, Warren, MI

The purpose of this experiment was to compare the effectiveness of two natural disinfectants, urea and tea tree oil, at three concentrations, high, low, and standard, to determine the percent reduction of Escherichia Coli (E. coli) bacteria colonies. The experiment consists of preparing the petri dishes in a sterile environment for the application of treatment of high, standard and low values of tea tree oil and urea. Urea concentrations were based on the concentration of urea found in human urine. Following treatment, bacteria inoculation takes place by first diluting the concentration of bacteria in three one-milliliter tests tubes and then pouring the bacteria into the petri dish. The dishes are then placed in an incubation chamber for two days. The dishes are removed from the incubation chamber and the colonies then counted. It was determined that tea tree high, 0.55 milliliters of tea tree oil and 0.45 milliliters of distilled water, overall, inhibited the most E. coli bacteria colonies with an average of 20% inhibition. It was also determined that urea high, 0.135 grams per 10 milliliters of distilled water, was the least effective inhibitor of E. coli bacteria colonies because it averaged approximately 1600% increase in the amount of bacteria found in the Petri dishes. In conclusion, it was found that smaller concentrations of urea increase bacteria growth, and it is not an effective disinfectant at the concentrations found in human urine.

EFFECT OF EXPOSURE TO VARIOUS CONCENTRATIONS OF TRICLOSAN AND TEA TREE OIL ON RESISTANCE AND/OR CROSS-RESISTANCE TO VANCOMYCIN IN STAPHYLOCOCCUS EPIDERMIDIS
Alex Eric Yuan, Sadhana Bharadwaj, 
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland, OR

Traditional Western antibacterial agents are being used too often to fight off common bacteria such as Staphylococcus epidermidis. Overuse of antimicrobial substances can lead to resistant strains. We conducted an experiment to determine if exposing bacteria to non-traditional (alternative) medications would also result in resistant strains of bacteria. We exposed S. epidermidis to differing concentrations of a traditional germicidal agent (triclosan) found in common hand-washing soaps and to an alternative medication (tea tree oil). High concentrations of either agent killed all bacteria, whereas low concentrations resulted in some survivors. We then plated the surviving bacteria on petri dishes and re-exposed the bacteria to the two different agents to see if the surviving Staphylococci were now more resistant to either agent. By measuring the zones of inhibition of the antibiotic disks, we found that S. epidermidis did become resistant to triclosan, but not to tea tree oil. The triclosan disk’s zone of inhibition was significantly smaller on the plate with previously exposed bacteria than on the plate with the control group. The same could not be said for the tea tree oil disk. We believe that these results occurred because triclosan is a single compound which lends itself to resistance. Tea tree oil, however, contains numerous germicidal agents, making it much more difficult for bacteria to become resistant. In summary, we suggest that when selecting hand-washing products, consumers should either choose those with relatively high concentrations of triclosan, or those with alternative active ingredients so as to prevent resistance.

SUPER GERMS VS. HERBS AND ANTIBIOTICS
Ishan Harshad Mehta, Nithin Tumma, 
Port Huron Northern High School, Port Huron, MI

Overuse of conventional antibiotics has created dangerously resistant bacteria. One form of bacterial resistance is the production of beta-lactamases which hydrolyze beta-lactam antibiotics. The purpose of this study was to determine the antimicrobial properties of various herbs, and the effectiveness of cephalosporins on beta-lactamase producing E. coli. We also assessed which antimicrobial would remain the most potent with continued use. <br><br>We tested two 2nd generation cephalosporins (CTT, CXM), two 3rd generations (CAZ, CRO), and four herbs (Ginger, Garlic, Clove and Cinnamon), against three strains of E. coli (AMP-C producing E. coli, ESBL producing E. coli, and E. coli without beta-lactamases).<br><br>It was hypothesized that the third generation cephalosporins would be the most effective in treating AMP-C and E. coli without beta-lactamases, while the second generation would be the most effective in treating ESBL. Among the herbs, cinnamon would be the most effective.<br><br>The strains of bacteria were inoculated onto Mueller-Hinton agar plates. We utilized the Kirby-Bauer Disk Method to measure the susceptibility to the antimicrobials. Filter paper disks containing the herbs/antibiotics were placed on the agar plates. The zones of inhibition were recorded the following day. The growth of bacterial resistance was determined by the change in zone size over five days.<br><br> <br><br>Our results indicate that all herbs were ineffective against the E. coli. While the second generation cephalosporin (CTT) was initially the most effective, the bacteria developed the least resistance to the third generation cephalosporins (CAZ, CRO), hence they will be the most useful in treating the E. coli.

REPRESSION OF TUMOR SUPPRESSOR GENES EXPRESSION BY HEPATITIS C VIRUS CORE PROTEIN VIA PROMOTER DNA METHYLATION
GiSeok Choi, Dong Chan Kim, 
Korea Science Academy, Busan, SOUTH KOREA

In this research, we studied HCV infection, one of the most important causes of liver cancer. Previous clinical studies indicate that cancer patients' tumor suppressor genes are promotor hypermethylated. There are also studies about the increment of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) activity by HCV core protein. DNMT's activation induces DNA promoter hypermethylation. Thus, this research primarily studied whether the expression of p14, p16, p21, p27 is inhibited by HCV core protein via DNA hypermethylation. We transfected the HCV core plasmid DNA into the human liver cell(HepG2), and treated the DNMT inhibitor, named AZA. By conducting three experiments, Methylation-specific PCR, Reverse Transcriptase-PCR, and Western blotting, we found that expressions of all four tumor suppressor genes were inhibited by HCV core protein via DNA methylation. After that, this research proceeded Cell counting and MTT assay to determine how the repressions of these gene expression affect the cell growth. Then, we could verify the repressions led to the promotion of cell growth. Our conclusion is that the expression of four tumor suppressor genes is inhibited by core protein via DNA hypermethylation, and this causes the promotion of cell growth. In short, we saw two correlations: one between HCV core protein and p14, p16, p21, p27 expressions and the other between HCV core protein and the promotion of cell growth. We could expect another correlation between p14, p16, p21, p27 expressions and cell growth. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that HCV core protein down-regulates p14, p16, p21, p27 expression via DNA methylation and the repressions of these genes lead to the promotion of cell growth, even though this research did not verify the correlation between p14, p16, p21, p27 expressions and cell growth.

This project used genetic techniques to identify four unknown fungal samples. Microbes colonizing the walls of the former Homestake Gold Mine required identification. This mine is the future site of a neutrino lab and will house giant particle accelerators.<br><br>DNA was isolated from the samples and used to identify four unknown fungal samples based upon the DNA sequence of a part of the ribosomal DNA region. The isolated Polymerase Chain Reaction products were cloned and the ribosomal DNA was sequenced. Successful sequencing in all four fungal samples and the use of the GenBank DNA database resulted in the identification of one sample; Penicillium charlesii.<br><br>The other three samples could not be identified to the genus or species level due to a lack of similar sequences in the database. However, the taxonomic classification could be estimated at a higher level. Because not all species of fungi have their DNA sequences in the international database, other methods may need to be used to positively identify some of the unknown samples. This may include traditional morphological identification.<br><br>DNA research is extremely useful because some microorganisms living in the rock, soil, or other substrates deep underground or any other environment cannot be grown in laboratories. Humans will come in contact with these living microorganisms. Therefore identification of microbes residing in the subsurface is imperative for the safety of the workers.

SCREENING FOR QUORUM SENSING INHIBITORS FROM SURFACE-ASSOCIATED BACTERIA OF HALYMENIA DURVILLAEI
Kevin Jer Ven David, Orven Jules Dumaoang, 
Philippine Science High School - Main Campus, Quezon City, Metro Manila, PHILIPPINES

Quorum sensing (QS) is a type of bacterial communication wherein signal molecules or auto-inducers that bind to receptors in other cells are released by microorganisms. When a threshold concentration of QS molecules is reached, virulence factors such as formation of biofilms – communities of bacteria encased in an extracellular polysaccharide matrix – are expressed, helping bacteria in biofilms adapt to environmental stresses, making them more resistant to antibiotics. Quorum sensing can be blocked by compounds that prevent the production of auto-inducers, destroy the auto-inducers or interfere with the signal receptors. <br><br>Fifty-three bacteria with distinct colonial morphologies were isolated from the seaweed Halymenia durvillaei and assayed for potential QS inhibition using Chromobacterium violaceum 12472, a biosensor whose violet pigmentation is muted by quorum sensing inhibitors, and Chromobacterium violaceum 026, another biosensor which exhibits violet pigmentation only in the presence of exogenous acylated homoserine lactones (AHLs), the signal molecules used by C. violaceum.<br><br>All isolates were observed to decolorize C. violaceum 12472, indicating putative QS inhibiting activity. However, of these, only one isolate was observed to induce violet pigmentation in C. violaceum 026, indicating possible QS inhibiting activity through AHL production. Supernatants of eleven of the isolates were assayed for biofilm inhibition. Among them, six tested positive in inhibiting the biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Identification of the putative QS inhibiting isolates, together with the isolation and characterization of secondary metabolites of the bacteria would help elucidate the mechanism of action of its QS inhibiting activity.

FROM SEQUENCE TO STRUCTURE: LINKING GENOMIC AND BIOCHEMICAL INFORMATION TO IDENTIFY AND OPTIMIZE CELLULOLYTIC BACTERIA
Katherine Shaohua Xue, Alborz Bejnood, 
Oak Ridge High School, Oak Ridge, TN

The current energy crisis necessitates development of alternative fuels like bioenergy. Ethanol from the cellulose found in the cell walls of plants is a promising solution, but the structure of cellulose makes it difficult to break down. However, many bacteria are able to efficiently degrade cellulose. Our project analyzed the amino acid sequences of enzymes that play a part in breaking down cellulose using computational techniques and linked the observations to experimental results regarding protein structure. We compared enzymes and deduced their relationships based on sequence similarities and linked groups of related enzymes to function and domain architecture. Within these groups, sequence similarities lent insight into how the enzymes catalyze their reactions, and we identified specific residues and regions of proteins that we predict are critical to their function. Observations about the roles of different parts of proteins provide directions for further study. We aim to develop models of enzyme function that can be used to predict what enzymes do and how they work together to hydrolyze cellulose. This information can be used to engineer bacteria able to directly produce ethanol from cellulose.

THE EFFECTS OF CARBON NANOTUBE ON CYANOBACTERIUM SYNECHOCYSTIS SP. FOR SUBSEQUENT BIOFUEL PRODUCTION
Sarah Mieko Tamashiro, Lindsay Fujimoto, 
Saint Andrew's Priory School, Honolulu, HI

With the unstable prices of oil and the depletion of our natural oil supplies, better alternatives for oil must be found. Biofuel production is critical for solving this problem and more people should focus on the potential that algae may have for biofuel use. Algae is considered to be a third-generation biofuel, where lipids are taken out of the cell and blended into biofuel for a more eco-friendly and affordable solution to our country's constant need for oil. By adding carbon nanotube to the solution of algae and liquid media the algae may become stressed and agitated, causing it to metabolize more or produce more lipids. The carbon nanotube may absorb the nutrients in the liquid media and, because it is 10^-9 meters in size, may be able to penetrate the cell, thus enabling more growth. Three different dosages (10, 20, 40 mg/l) of carbon nanotube were tested with the algae in order to see if an increased level of growth could be obtained, while still being nontoxic. After three trials, the data showed that carbon nanotube positively affected the growth of the algae, but higher dosages of carbon nanotube did not increase the amount of growth in the algae cells. This is an important first step in finding a solution for alternative energy and, with these encouraging results, carbon nanotube can possibly lead to an increase in the amount of lipids that can be extracted for biofuel production in an economical manner.

EX-CHANGING MICROBES: THE UNSEEN HAZARDS OF INFANT CHANGING TABLES
Sarah Dawn Niitsuma, Shwan Javdan, 
Academy for Math, Engineering and Science, Salt Lake City, UT

Infants have a greater vulnerability to sickness from exposure to bacteria than adults, and a significant risk is posed if the surfaces of infant changing tables are unsanitary. Thus, the goal of this project was to determine the amount of bacteria on infant changing tables, and whether or not these microorganisms are potentially harmful strains. Additionally, disinfectant wipes were used to determine their effectiveness in preventing the transmission of microbes. Samples were collected from 12 locations in Salt Lake City, Utah. Swabs were taken from the changing table surfaces, spread onto LB agar plates and placed in incubators to culture any bacteria and fungi. Colonies were counted and replica-plating was done in order to transfer colonies to Mannitol salt agar plates. This selective media tested specifically for Staphylococcus aureus, a skin-dwelling bacterium which causes nausea and stomach ache. A single microgram of S. aureus will induce these symptoms in a healthy adult, and could result in more severe illness for infants. Test results displayed as many as 1,000 bacterial colonies, including similar colony counts of S. aureus. Disinfectant wipes killed nearly all present microbes. It is recommended that public places, such as those tested in this study, enforce the cleanliness of infant changing tables by providing disinfectant wipes next to the tables and educating the public.

SOAP VS. SOAPLESS
Atef Kokash, Raoaa Edmon, 
Franklin High School, El Paso, TX

Staphylococcus infections are responsible for MRSA, BRE, boils, skin infections, and loss of limbs; it may cause death. By washing your hands with antibacterial products, you lessen the chances of infection. Soap contains molecular particles which bonds to the bacteria, and with effective washing using water, it removes the harmful germs. Hand sanitizers contain a large amount of alcohol which attacks the cell walls of bacterial cells, breaking the shell and denaturing protons within. <br><br>The intent of this project was to determine the effectiveness of soap (Johnson’s, Softsoap, Meijer) and hand sanitizers (Germ-X, Eqauline, Walgreens), in destroying the essential quality of the Staphylococcus epidermidis. It was hypothesized that Germ-X hand sanitizer brand and the Johnson’s soap brand would be the most effective in eliminating bacteria.<br><br>To test this, one-hundred sixty test tubes containing aqueous solutions of nutrient broth and Staphylococcus epidermidis were examined. These test tubes, along with the control containing only bacteria, were incubated at thirty-seven degrees Celsius for forty-eight hours. The percent transmittance was determined using a Spectrophotometer 20. The percent transmittance was then converted to optical density using the equation: OD=2-log(%transmittance).<br><br>Based on the results, it was calculated that the lowest average optical density of the hand sanitizers was Germ-X – a 10.99% O.D. Johnson’s had the lowest average optical density of the three soap brands, with a 15.00% O.D. Buyers are now able to purchase the superlative brand that meets their needs.

ARE MYCOBACTERIUM LEPRAE ELIMINATED FROM THE BODY AFTER TREATMENT FOR HANSEN'S DISEASE (LEPROSY)?
Elizabeth Anne Blanchard, Caroline Hebert, 
Saint Joseph's Academy, Baton Rouge, LA

The purpose of this experiment was to see if Mycobacterium leprae are eliminated from the body after treatment for Hansen’s Disease. The research hypothesis was that after the antimicrobials that treat Hansen’s Disease kill Mycobacterium leprae, the body will eventually eliminate the bacilli. The null hypothesis was that after Mycobacterium leprae is killed, all of the bacilli will be immediately eliminated. The formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples of six patients were looked at, at three different time intervals over the course of many months. There are roughly 200 cases of Hansen’s Disease in the United States annually. The bacterial index was used to count the number of bacilli on each tissue sample. The partners would look at fifty fields on a tissue, and assign a category to each field, depending on the number of bacilli found. If a field had over 1,000 bacilli, a +6 was assigned to that field. If a field had 100 to 1,000 bacilli, a +5 was assigned. If a field had 10 to 100 bacilli a +4 was assigned. If a field had 1 to 10 bacilli, a +4 was assigned. If fifty fields of a tissue were looked at and no bacilli were spotted, one would have to look at the entire tissue make sure there are no bacilli When the average of the first trials of every patient is compared to the average of the last trials of every patient, one should accept the research hypothesis and reject the null hypothesis. In conclusion it was determined that the body will slowly, but steadily eliminate Mycobacterium leprae, after it is killed.

A CREATURE FEATURE: THE MONSTERS THAT CAME FROM THE KETCHUP PACKETS
Hunter A. White
Crystal River High School, Crystal River, FL

The purpose of my experiment is to determine how dirty fast food condiment packets are. I hypothesize that these packets will all be "dirty" and will have spore forming, anaerobes. My procedure involved the collection of the packets from three fast food restaurants in my area. These packets were placed in individual plastic bags that were labeled with a specific letter which identifies the restaurant, and a number which identifies the particular packet number. These packets were brought to a BSL-2 lab where a safety hood was set-up and the entire experiment was conducted under the hood. Three each of chocolate agar and blood agar plates were divided and labeled into quadrants accordingly, and a packet was taken out of the bag individually and swabbed with a single-use cotton swab and then sterile water was placed on the swab. The moisten swab was then used to swab the respective quadrant, and this was continued with the other packets. For the control, sterile water placed on an unswabbed swab, and this swab was used to streak the control quadrant on all plates. However a new swab was used for each plate's control quadrant. The plates were then placed in an incubator for 37 degrees Celsius for 24 hours, and then taken out for a visual examination. Representative colonies were chosen for biochemical tests for the anaerobes(chocolate plate)and sensitivity testing on the aerobes (blood agar plate), which determines the species of the organisms. Various staph and strep skin flora was discovered, but in large amounts which indicates that my hypothesis was both correct and wrong. This experiment could be used to strike interest for public health regulations. This procedure could be enhanced by using more restaurants and by gathering samples at different intervals of time.

PREVENTION OF CENTRAL VENOUS CATHETER ASSOCIATED INFECTIONS: A STUDY OF EFFICACY OF SILVER NANOPARTICLES ON REDUCING BACTERIAL AND FUNGAL COLONIZATION AND BIOFILM FORMATION
Stephanie Yeeshan Hsiang
Niceville High School, Niceville, FL

Approximately 2-6% of patients suffer from central venous catheter (CVC)-associated infection. The mortality rate can be up to 30%. The estimated medical cost is $16,500. Reducing CVC-associated infection is of great clinical importance.<br><br> In this project, the student researcher analyzed the microorganisms of 47 positive cultures of CVC from a 257-bed community hospital over 6 months’ period. Gram-positive bacteria caused 62% infection. Candida albicans and Gram-negative bacteria each caused 19%. Among Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermidis accounted for 59%, followed by Staphylococcus capitis (14%), Staphylococcus aureus (14%) and others (13%). For Gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the leading etiology causing 33% of infections.<br><br> Six Gram-positive bacteria(4 Staphylococcus spp, 1 Streptococcus spp and 1 Enterococcus spp), 6 Gram-negative bacteria (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Candida albicans were tested using Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion assay and optic turbidity growth assay. All the microorganisms tested were significantly inhibited by silver nanoparticles, indicating its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against CVC infections.<br><br> The amount of microorganism colonization was significantly reduced when a CVC device, pre-coated with silver nanoparticles, was exposed to cultures of Staphylococcus epidermidis or Candida albicans. After 5-minute exposure and 24-hour culture, the amount of Staphylococcus epidermidis or Candida albicans was reduced by 63% (6,720 vs. 2,457 and 6,990 vs. 2,553 cfu, respectively; p< 0.001). The amount of biofilm formation was also significantly reduced, both by morphological examination and by quantitative colorimetic optic density assay (0.408 vs. 0.207 and 0.420 vs. 0.210, respectively; p<0.001).

EVALUATION OF BURKHOLDERIA PYRROCINIA (FL728) AND PAENIBACILLUS LENTIMORBUS (FL92) FOR THE PRESENCE OF GENES ENCODING THE BIOSYNTHESIS OF PYRROLNITRIN, PYOLUTEORIN, PHENAZINE, AND 2,4-DIACETYLPHLOROGLUCINOL ANTIBIOTICS
Stephanie Page Hoskins
Lincoln Park Academy, Fort Pierce, FL

The presence of genes responsible for the biosynthesis of pyrrolnitrin (PRN), pyoluteorin (PLT), phenazine (PHZ), and 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (2,4-DAPG), broad spectrum antibiotics produced by certain Psuedomonas and Burkholderia species, was investigated in Florida isolates Burkholderia pyrrocinia (FL728) and Paenibacillus lentimorbus (FL92). These isolates have been proven to have antifungal activity, and the work focused upon identifying putative mechanisms of the observed biocontrol. This characterization can enhance the efficacy of the isolates as biocontrol agents. Oligonucleotide primers, developed from conserved sequences of prnD, plt, phz, and phl2 genes, were used. Two characterized isolates of Psuedomonas fluorescens, CHAO and Pf-5, were the positive controls. Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCR) were performed using protocols established for each primer pair. After PCR, amplified genes were visualized using gel electrophoresis. The control isolates, CHAO and Pf-5, presented amplification of the prnD, plt, and phz genes. FL728 presented amplification of the prnD and phz genes. Sequence analysis of the amplicons confirmed the identification of the target genes. The prnD gene was detected in FL92 by PCR-based screening method and amplified a 786-bp fragment characteristic of the gene responsible for the biosynthesis of pyrrolnitrin. Confirmed through cloning, sequencing, and aligning of the fragment through BLAST database, this discovery represents the first documentation of a Paenibacillus species and a gram-positive bacterium producing pyrrolnitrin. The identification of the antibiotics of FL728 and FL92 allows for the design of liquid culture media for mass production to practically use the isolates as biological control agents in the field.

THE EFFICIENCY OF GREEN TEA IN INHIBITING TRANSFORMATION
Kiyokuni Yamada
Glynn Academy, Brunswick, GA

The researcher’s purpose on this experiment is to see if green tea could prevent bacterial transformation using E. coli as gram-negative bacteria and S. epidermidis as gram-positive bacteria. So the researcher hypothesized since green tea have astringent, antibacterial properties, it could prevent the transformation on E. coli and S. epidermidis, and conjugation on E. coli. Thus the researcher made a solution consisting of LB, LB+ampicillin, and LB+ampicillin+arabinose as another factor for transformation. Then, the researcher labeled the plates, gathered 3 micro test tubes, for transformation, had pipette necessary materials, heat shocked it, and streaked it. As a result, the green tea was able to prevent transformation in E. coli when the researcher replicated the experiment 3 times, but was unable to prevent it in S. epidermidis possibly because of the thick peptidoglycan layer that prevented the salt to make pores. In conjugation, the researcher used Streptomycin and Ampicillin as factors to see if green tea can prevent conjugation in E. coli, however, when it was experimented 3 times, the E. coli was still able to conjugate in presence of green tea. Therefore in a life-case situation, if a person accidentally ate meat that still had remains of dead virulent E. coli, but drank green tea with it, the green tea would prevent the virulent E. coli to transform the E. coli in your intestines. However, it will still allow the virulent E. coli to conjugate if it was alive.

WASTE TO ENERGY: MICROBIAL FUEL CELLS
Christopher Austin Paschal
Glynn Academy, Brunswick, GA

The purpose of this project is to determine the effectiveness of a microbial fuel cell. It will also test the voltage production differneces between benthic and topsoil mud. My hypothesis is that the benethic mud samples will have a higher voltage reading than the topsoil samples.<br><br>This project involves building six microbial fuel cells. I used tweleve small plastic storage containers as the body of the fuel cells. I then cut holes in the top each container in order to place tubes inside connected to aquarium air pumps. I connected two of the containers together with a PVC pipe filled with boiled agar solution. This piece is known as the semi-permeable membrane or salt bridge. I then made twelve electrodes using copper wire and carbon cloth to place inside each container. This made a total of six fuel cells. Finally, I collected benthic mud samples from the McKay River and I purchased a bag of topsoil. I added water to the topsoil to make mud. I completed construction and then filled each cell. I measured the voltage of each fuel cell twice a day for thirty days.<br><br>After checking voltage for thirty days, I found that the benthic samples of mud produced almost twice as much voltage as the topsoil samples. This proved my hypothesis correct. I found that this technology can produce electricity and may prove effective with more research.

LNSV VS. TBSV: EFFECT OF VIRUS COMPETITION AND DOMINANCE IN DIFFERENT HOST TYPES
Aradhana Sinha
Salinas High School, Salinas, CA

The objective of this experiment is to find out which virus, TBSV or LNSV, is dominant in individual plant species, as well as to look at how symptoms differ when you have the viruses alone, compared to when you have both in one plant. This would help determine which virus is more of a threat to a particular host plant, and which virus is going to be dominant in a particular host. Finding the dominant virus will help researchers predict what the next major destructive virus will be, so that they can prepare for it.<br><br><br> I hypthesized that in the singly-infected plants one virus will have a higher concentration. I expected that the virus that has a higher quantity in a host in the individual infections will be the one that is dominant in that host during the co-infection. I also believed that the virus that has a larger concentration in a host will show more severe symptoms.<br><br><br> For this experiment, I had 4 groups of Nicotiana clevelandii, Lettuce, Tomato and Spinach. One group was infected with just TBSV. The second group was infected with LNSV. A third group was infected with both viruses at the same time. The fourth group was the control, and was not infected. Lambsquarters (indicator plant) was infected with the LNSV and TBSV single infections.<br><br> <br><br> My results showed that it was not necessary that one virus (LNSV or TBSV) be dominant over the other: they could be equal. I also discovered that the virus with a higher quantity in the individual infections was also the one with a higher quantity in the mix. On the Symptom Severity Scale in Spinach and Clevelandii, TBSV was worse than LNSV or the mixed-infection. I concluded that the severity of the symptoms in TBSV and LNSV does not always correlate with the quantity of the virus in the plant.

WILL MELALEUCA ALTERNIFOLIA ENHANCE THE EFFECTS OF ANTIBIOTICS AGAINST RESISTANT E.COLI STRAINS (35218 AND 25922)?
Cassandra Lee Gutierrez
Grants High School, Grants, NM

The purpose of this experiment is to identify a vitamin or mineral that allows the bacterium to open a metabolic pathway degrading the antibiotics. Once mutations have been identified the purpose is to reverse bacterial resistance in E.coli 35218 and 25922, using Tea Tree Oil (Melaleuca alternifolia) to enhance the following antibiotics: augmenton, levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and gentamicin. A gel electrophoresis of DNA samples will be used to confirm mutations are taking place. <br><br> The hypothesis of this project is that the growth of E.coli strains 35218 and 25922 will be enhanced by vitamins A and E. The other vitamins and minerals will not affect the bacterial growth. The resistant bacterial strains exposed to Tea Tree Oil will show susceptibility and the gel electrophoresis will confirm mutations are occurring.<br><br> After making vitamin and mineral solutions disk diffusion was used to identify which solution affected bacterial growth. The resistant strains were exposed to Tea Tree Oil through disk diffusion to determine if the resistant bacterial strains could become susceptible. DNA extracted from all bacterial samples used was digested using HIND III to produce restriction fragments from each sample for electrophoresis and compared to Lambda standards and each other. <br><br> In conclusion the hypothesis was shown to be partially correct. All of the minerals effected the growth of both bacterial strains. Vitamins C and E caused bacterial mutations where as vitamins A and B had no effect on bacterial growth. The use of Tea Tree Oil showed resistant bacterial growth to be susceptible. The electrophoresis of DNA samples compared to each other and the Lambda DNA Standard showed several similarities between the fragments seperated, confirming mutations.

VITIS LABRUSCA ANTHOCYANIN IDENTIFICATION AND THEIR ANTIBACTERIAL EFFECTS ON CAPRA HIRCUS HOOF ROT BACTERIA
Sarah Marie Cox
Zane Trace Local Schools, Chillicothe, OH

Capra hircus hoof rot is a common health problem and an economic liability. Fusobacterium necrophorum and Arcanobacterium pyogenes are common bacterial causes of goat hoof rot. Anthocyanins, pigments found in grapes, are polyphenols proven to have antibacterial effects. This experiment sought to treat hoof rot utilizing environmentally safe grape anthocyanins.<br><br>The project’s purpose was to identify the primary anthocyanins found in Vitis labrusca (Catawba cultivar) and to determine if these anthocyanins have antimicrobial properties against two common hoof rot bacteria. The hypotheses include: 1) the grape extract will contain at least 15 different anthocyanins; 2) the grape anthocyanins will have antibacterial effects on F. necrophorum and A. pyogenes; 3) The higher anthocyanin concentration will directly correlate with more extensive antibacterial inhibition zones.<br><br>There were 21 individual anthocyanins identified in the grape extract. V. labrusca anthocyanins were extracted and identified primarily as delphinidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-glucoside using HPLC gas chromatography. C. hircus hoof cultures were grown in an anaerobic chamber. F. necrophorum and A. pyogenes were identified using biochemical tests including gram stain methods, catalase, automatic testing, genetic testing, and oxidase. Several strengths of anthocyanins and a control of methanol and acidified water were concentrated onto disks and placed on isolated cultures of F. necrophorum and A. pyogenes to show the antimicrobial effect. F. necrophorum had inhibition zones to both anthocyanin strengths. A. pyogenes showed resistance to all anthocyanin strengths.<br><br>Providing a safer, environment-friendly alternative to the traditional treatments of hoof rot is important both economically and ecologically.

SILVER NANOPARTICLES AND SPECTROSCOPY: POWERFUL TECHNIQUES FOR BACTERIAL DETECTION ON BIOTERRORISM
Veronica Maria Biaggi
Southwestern Educational Society, Mayaguez, PUERTO RICO

Terrorism has become an agonizing reality of our times. Terrorists have already used the undetected spread of pathogenic bacteria as a way to carry on their unjustified evil goals. This experiment established how the use of nanoparticles facilitates the detection of these pathogenic bacteria making it faster, more efficient and precise to timely detect them thus being able to prevent these bioterrorists’ attacks. <br><br>The hypothesis stated that if silver nanoparticles are used as a Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy’s (SERS) substrate to detect Bacillus thuringensis (non-pathogenic bacteria with qualities similar to the bacillus anthracis) these bacteria will become easier to detect in comparison to the use of normal Raman spectrum due to the enhancement of the bands.<br><br>Silver nanoparticles were made and the bacteria Bacillus thuringensis was grown for 24-48 hours. Initially, the bacteria were placed by itself under the effect of a Raman microscope, the same procedure was done with the nanoparticles alone. Then, the nanoparticles and the bacteria were placed together in the microscope under SERS.<br><br>The hypothesis was supported. When the silver nanoparticles were added to the bacteria, the signal obtained showed peaks in the spectrum that did not appear when the bacteria and the nanoparticles were alone. <br><br> These results merit the future use of this detection technique in public spaces, such as airports, or any place where any bioterrorist threat is imminent. In addition, this process can have health related applications assisting in the detection and control of bacteria outbreaks in hospitals and other medical facilities.

UTILIZATION OF THE FUNGUS ASPERGILLUS NIGER ON WASTEWATER TREATMENT II
William Lopes
Fundacao Escola Tecnica Liberato Salzano Vieira da Cunha, Novo Hamburgo, Rio Grande do Sul, BRASIL

The presence of dyes in the environment causes many problems due to its toxicity and difficult treatment. The leather industry generates a large amount of wastewater containing high concentrations of pollutants. Present in the wastewater, are dyes and other compounds such as: nitrogen, calcium, magnesium, iron and lithium. These compounds when released into the environment affect biological systems causing imbalance in the local biotic interactions. Technologies for efficient removal of pollutant are economically and energetically costly. An alternative for the treatment of wastewater is called bioremediation, a technological process that uses organisms to remove pollutants. The research project, here stated, tested the removal of dye, nitrogen, calcium, magnesium, iron and lithium, through a filtration system using the biomass of the fungus Aspergillus niger. This research analyzed the best way how to use the biomass as a filtration system: biomass autoclaved (dead) or non-autoclaved (live). After flows a tannery wastewater sample through the biomass filter, was tested a method to extract the dyes from the biomass as a possibility to reuse it for further leather dyeing. The results indicated that the filtration system is able to remove all the compounds studied. The analysis showed the following results (removal of pollutants): dye Brown Antique: 78.6%, iron: 81.7%, calcium: 70.3%, magnesium 78.4%, nitrogen: 64.1% and lithium: 82%. It was concluded that the filtration process here developed, was efficient and the results suggest the possibility of using it as an alternative to existing processes in wastewater treatment. <br><br><br>Keywords: Aspergillus niger, bioremediation, pollutants, effluents, wastewater

MATRICARIA CHAMOMILLA EXTRACT - AN ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY ON THE FIGHT AGAINST ACNE
Cassio Felipe Stumm
Fundacao Escola Tecnica Liberato Salzano Vieira da Cunha, Novo Hamburgo, Rio Grande do Sul, BRASIL

Acne is a cutaneous disease which brings forth serious problems on the physical and psychosocial fields, affecting 80% of the population between 11 and 30 years old. Among the causes that determine the appearing of this disease, there can be mentioned microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus. One of the means used in order to soften or remove symptoms induced by acne are antimicrobial drugs, which, to a large extent, present high costs of production and low efficiency. An alternative way created to solve this problem is the usage of plant extracts that are easily found and have lower costs. In order to attain a Matricaria chamomilla extract that could offer the highest output and the best inactivation capacity of S. aureus, two extractive methods have been tested in this project: plant immersion in different solvents; and steam distillation. Research results indicate that only extracts though immersion in hexane, acetone and hexane 50% v/v, acetone, ethanol and acetone 50% present antimicrobial effects, whereas the best of all these has been proved to be acetone, which attained an average inhibitory circle of 5,53mm. Nonetheless, the extract which attained the best output has been the immersion into ethanol and acetone 50% v/v, with an output of 5,79%. It is concluded, therefore, that the usage of Matricaria chamomilla is possible on the reduction of acne-related problems, yet only on the extract form resorting to specific solvents.

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF USING HAND SANITIZER IN A SCHOOL SETTING
Megan Mae Khoury
Trinity School of Midland, Midland, TX

A. Starting last year, many Americans have been terrified of the ongoing flu and H1N1 virus. Sales of hand sanitizers have sky rocketed as its use has been continually advised by health specialists on national television. The purpose of my experiment is to find how effective the use of hand sanitizer is in reducing the amount of bacteria on surfaces found in an ordinary school classroom. <br><br>B. First I will test for the effect of ethyl alcohol concentration on effectiveness of hand sanitizer. Then I will determine baseline bacterial count in regular and “treated” classroom. The data will be recorded by counting the bacterial colonies found in each Petri dish. The difference in the count of colonies will determine whether the hand sanitizer was effective in lessening the bacterial count in a classroom setting. Finally I will test the effectiveness of hand sanitizer on a subject’s hands as a function of time. <br><br>C. The average number of bacterial colonies in the untreated classroom was 48.5 and in the “treated” room 19.6. As a function of time on hands, the bacterial count 0 minutes after application was 1.3 while after 40 minutes it reached 19.8. By extrapolating, the bacterial count would reach 49 bacterial colonies after 105 minutes.<br><br>D. My conclusion is that if everybody who enters a room applies hand sanitizer to their hands before entering the amount of bacteria on the surfaces in the room will be decreased by more than half. Also hand sanitizer loses its effectiveness to kill bacteria after about 105 minutes.

Banana Fusarium wilt, a devastating disease of banana caused by Fusarium oxysporum. f.sp.cubense (Foc), is highly infectious, and it is the most effective way to control the banana Fusarium wilt disease to set up a set of stable, sensitive, simple and rapid molecular detection method for early examination of banana seedlings and soils in planting areas to stop the transmission of Fusarium oxysporum f.sp.cubense. In this study, 128 random primers were used for RAPD amplification of isolates from Fusarium oxysporum f.sp.cubense that causes Banana Fusarium wilt, other specialized types of Fusarium oxysporum, other Fusarium spp, and other pathogens in bananas and soil, and a specific 400 bp fragment of Fusarium oxysporum f.sp.cubense was obtained. This product was cloned and sequenced, and it was found that the sequence doesn’t have homologous sequence in the Genbank database. The marker was converted into a sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR), and a specific PCR primer pair FOC-F/FOC-R was designed. The primer pair specifically amplified a single 364 bp product from isolates of pure DNA of Fusarium oxysporum f.sp.cubense, and infected plant tissues and soils. The detection sensitivity of nested PCR reached that of the 10fg/25 µl system. Field detection has proved that this detection technique developed here is accurate, stable and sensitive, can be applied in rapid detection of Fusarium oxysporum f.sp.cubense in banana tissues and soils, and is helpful for the early diagnosis and control of banana Fusarium wilt.

SHOWERHEAD BACTERIA: WHAT DANGEROUS MICROORGANISMS ARE LURKING INSIDE?
Kaitlin Alissa Loyd
Bartlesville High School, Bartlesville, OK

In recent months researchers have found that bacteria are growing in household showers and could be dangerous. The bacterium that has been found is likely to cause infections in individuals with autoimmune diseases. This experiment tests for bacteria in eight different showerheads and one brand new metal showerhead. All of the showerheads were swabbed initially and those samples transitioned to nutrient agar Petri dishes, which were sealed and placed in an incubator. After swabbing the control, it was placed back into its purchase package. Forty-eight hours later the dishes were taken out of the incubator and the bacterial growth was analyzed. Six out of nine showerheads tested had significant bacterial growth. Each showerhead was then placed in a 10% bleach solution for 10 minutes, then rinsed and placed back in its original position. Immediately after the bleach soak the showerheads were swabbed once more and samples plated onto separate Petri dishes. Those dishes were placed in an incubator for 48 hours and the results were compared to that of the first swab. The bacterial growth had decreased dramatically from the first swab. Two weeks later the same swab process occurred and the experiment was concluded. Soaking showerheads in a 10% bleach solution about every two weeks decreases the bacterial growth that is likely to be dangerous for those who have compromised or weakened immune systems.

THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT INOCULA AND MEDIA ON THE POWER OUTPUT OF MICROBIAL BIOBATTERIES
Sarah Katherine Hooper
Charlottesville High School, Charlottesville, VA

These experiments were performed in order to demonstrate the ability of biobatteries to harness electrons from bacterial fermentation to produce power and to study the effects of different inocula and media on power production. Two-chamber biobatteries were assembled from PVC pipe to use in experimental tests. Variations in inocula (yeast, yogurt and Rid-X), inoculum concentrations and media additions were used to maximize the power output of the microbial biobatteries. The hypothesis was that different inocula and the addition of media supplements would affect the power output of microbial biobatteries.<br><br> The first stage of this experiment involved assembly of salt bridges using Knox gelatin and salt. The second stage involved assembling electrodes from carbon fiber strips and the final stage involved assembly of the biobatteries.<br><br> The third stage of the experiment involved testing the power output of different inocula and the effects of adding media supplements to the biobatteries. The first two tests provided controls. Voltage and milliamp readings were taken from the biobatteries when the chambers were filled with air, and then with the anode filled with dechlorinated water and the cathode filled with saltwater. The third test compared the power output of yeast, yogurt and Rid-X. The fourth test used different concentrations of yogurt in dechlorinated water as the inocula. Finally, media was tested by adding sugar to the biobatteries. Power was calculated for all tests. The data provided evidence that both inocula and media affected the power output of the assembled biobatteries.

EFFECT OF TRANS-CINNAMALDEHYDE ON REDUCING ATTACHMENT AND INVASION OF UROPATHOGENIC ESCHERICHIA COLI IN URINARY TRACT EPITHELIAL CELLS
Amoolya Narayanan
Glastonbury High School, Glastonbury, CT

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common infectious diseases in the United States, causing more than 100 million cases and costing over $1 billion annually. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is the primary bacterium causing UTIs in humans. Emerging antibiotic resistance in UPEC is a major concern, highlighting the need for alternate approaches to control the pathogen. Attachment and invasion of urinary tract epithelial cells by UPEC is the first critical step in establishing a successful UTI, which results in pathogen colonization of host tissue, thereby evading host defenses and serving as a reservoir of recurrent infections. UPEC encodes several virulence factors, including fimA, fimH, focA, sfaA and SfaS that enable bacterial attachment and invasion of urinary tract. This research investigated the effect of sub-inhibitory concentrations (concentrations not inhibiting bacterial growth) of trans-cinnamaldehyde (0, 350, 550, and 750 µM), an ingredient in cinnamon, on UPEC attachment and invasion of human urinary tract cells. Additionally, the effect of trans-cinnamaldehyde on expression of UPEC genes encoding fimA, fimH, focA, sfaA and SfaS was investigated, using real-time, quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Moreover, the cytotoxicity of trans-cinnamaldehyde, if any, on urinary tract epithelial cells was determined. Results indicated that trans-cinnamaldehyde significantly reduced UPEC invasion of uroepithelial cells, and expression of UPEC genes encoding fimA, fimH, focA, sfaA and SfaS. Trans-cinnamaldehyde did not exert any deleterious effect on uroepithelial cells. Trans-cinnamaldehyde attenuated UPEC virulence via modulating bacterial gene expression, and justifies follow up studies validating its potential to control UTIs.

KILLER EXTRACTS: A STUDY ON THE ANTIBACTERIAL EFFECTIVENESS OF MEDICINAL PLANTS OF THE US VIRGIN ISLANDS.
Eliza Walton Mongeau
The Good Hope School, Frederiksted, St.Croix, VIRGIN ISLANDS

Using Caribbean plants for medicinal purposes has been a common practice in the United States Virgin Islands, and it is still going strong in the 21st century. Knowledge of the specific uses of certain plants has been passed from from generation to generation, and is a thriving part of the culture of the USVI. The purpose of the experiment was to determine antibacterial effectiveness of certain medicinal plants from the United States Virgin Islands. I tested the effect of extracts from four plants common to the VI on gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. My procedure included making extracts using 3 solvents (water, ethanol and acetone). Using filter disks, I tested the plant extracts on a Gram-positive bacteria (B.subtilis) and a Gram-negative bacteria (E.coli). The process of creating the extracts was adapted in each testing round. Using the two extracts that showed the most positive results (tamarind and guava); I ran a cell dilution series. The results of my study showed that guava and tamarind extracts in acetone have the most antibacterial activity. In the cell dilution series the guava showed 6.50E+09 cells per ml of extract. The tamarind showed an average of 8.44E+10 cpml. The major conclusion found in my study is that guava and tamarind have the most antibacterial activity, even more than garlic, the positive control. Future studies could include fractionation of the guava and tamarind extracts. Fractionation would identify the antibacterial factor of the plant. Successful fractionation would result in a more concentrated and powerful antibacterial extract.

BACTERIAL SILENCING: THE DISCOVERY OF QUORUM QUENCHING SOIL MICROBES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANTIMICROBIAL COMPOUNDS
Sonia Grace Sundar Rao
Camdenton R-3 High School, Camdenton, MO

Quorum sensing (QS) is a kind of bacterial communication. Pathogens utilize QS and disruption of QS, which is called quorum quenching, can lead to inhibition of virulence. The purpose of this experiment is to observe whether soil isolates produce possible quorum quenching enzymes. <br><br>Ten soil samples were collected from various locations around Osage Beach, Missouri. Each sample was added to R2A broth in culture tubes, vortexed and sat at room temperature for thirty minutes. 0.1 ml of the broth was spread onto R2A plates. At a local hospital, isolates were streaked onto R2A plates at room temperature overnight. Chomobacterium violaceum 12472 was streaked next to each isolate at room temperature overnight. C.violaceum utilizes QS to produce a purple pigment. Loss of pigment indicates disruption of QS. Isolates that inhibited pigment production in C.violaceum, were streaked next to A. tumefaciens with x-gal solution. Agrobacterium tumefaciens detects if the isolate was producing an AHL molecule or quorum quencher that interfered with QS in C.violaceum. X-gal produces a blue pigment when a quorum quencher is not present. <br><br>Results demonstrated, for the first time, that highly competitive soil communities, such as late successional communities (Parrish and Bazzaz, 1982), could be a potential harbor for quorum quenching enzymes, which could be used to develop a new class of antibiotics. Ten isolates were identified as producing quorum quenching enzymes. Isolates are currently being subjected to 16 S RNA gene sequencing analysis by a genetic microbiology laboratory at a local university for identification purposes.

ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY OF A PHENOLIC COMPOUND EXTRACTED FROM THE RIND OF PUNICA GRANATUM AGAINST KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIA, HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE AND ACINETOBACTER SPECIES
Ghayda Ismat Alhawamdeh
Jumana Secondary School for Girls, Ramtha, Irbid, JORDAN

Punica granatum is commonly used in Jordan as a traditional medicine for the treatment of pathogenic bacteria. In this study, the antimicrobial activity of different extracts from the rind of P. granatum was evaluated against Klebsiella pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae and Acinetobacter species. The extract with the best activity was chosen for purifying the active ingredient which responsible for the antimicrobial activity.<br><br>METHOD: Three crude extracts of P. granatum were prepared using chloroform, methanol and distilled water. Phenol bounded with peptides was released by hydrolyzing aqueous extract with 0.1N NaOH pH12.<br><br>Proteins in the aqueous extract were partially purified using ammonium sulfate, gel chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography. Disc diffusion method was used to evaluate the antimicrobial activity.<br><br>RESULTS: Both aqueous and methanolic extracts showed antimicrobial activity against the three bacterial species. The third fraction obtained from ammonium sulfate fractionation inhibited the growth of K. pneumonia, H. influenzae and A. species with inhibition zones 2.1, 1.7 and 1.9 cm respectively. The inhibition zones of the second peak in gel chromatography were 1.4, 1.8 and 1.5cm respectively, while the inhibition zones for the second peak of ion-exchange chromatography were 1.4, 1.3 and 1.2cm respectively.<br><br>Free phenol extract showed the highest activity with the inhibition zones of 2.2, 1.9 and 2.1 cm respectively. Phenol free peptides did not show any antimicrobial activity.<br><br>CONNCLUSION: The rind of P. granatum posses an antimicrobial activity against Klebsiella pneumoniam, Haemophilus influenzae and Acinetobacter species. And this antimicrobial activity is due to a phenolic compound and not to a peptide.

EVOLUTIONARY STUDY OF P. AERUGINOSA IN CHRONIC LUNG INFECTIONS OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS
Mikkel Mohr Madsen
Middelfart Gymnasium & HF, Middelfart, Fyn, DENMARK

Cystic Fibrosis patients are susceptible to bacterial infections because they have impaired clearance of their lungs. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common pathogen of CF. In this study the metabolism of one of the two dominant genotypes of P. aeruginosa in chronic lung infections are studied with methodologies never used on this genotype before. <br><br>25 strains from chronic lung infections of CF-patients have been assayed on Phenotypic MicroArray (PM) producing very valuable data on the metabolism. PM investigates the ability of the bacterium to grow on 190 different sources of carbon and 95 different sources of nitrogen. The 25 strains investigated represent the infection history of 4 patients with CF ranging from the early stages to the late stages. <br><br>By comparing PAO1, which is a wildtype P. earuginosa, to the early and late samples from chronic lung infections with statistical methodologies a clear tendency is showed in this work. The bacterium adapts to the lung environment and in this process looses the ability to use many carbon and nitrogen sources. These tendencies will be investigated further in the following months with advanced statistical methodologies.

ANTIBIOTIC SENSITIVITY OF MRSA IN DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
Luis Alejandro Acaba
Academia del Perpetuo Socorro, San Juan, San Juan, PUERTO RICO

Objective-To evaluate the incidence of MRSA, using data results, as part of the normal flora in different groups of patients and their sensitivities to antibiotics.The procedure involved was made by a certified bacteriologist and a specified othtalmologist.The results were sumited and analized by the current investigator. Results were organized in tables and graphs, and summited to a statistical analisis. <br><br>Materials and Methods- The nose of two hundred patients were cultured in ChromAgar MRSA plates. Patients were divided into 4 groups of fifty patients: non-diabetics younger than 60y (Group 1), non-diabetics older than 60 y (Group 2) (Controls); diabetics younger than 60y (Group 3) and diabetics older than 60y (Group 4). MRSA colonies were inoculated into Mueller-Hinton Agar plates and antibiotic discs of vancomycin, gatifloxacillin and moxifloxacillin placed. Sensitivities to antibiotics wee recorded.<br><br>Results-Growth of MRSA colonies was detected at 48 hours in 31 plates(15.5%). . Twenty-eight plates showed growth (90%). In the control groups: non-diabetic patients younger than 60 years of age (Group 1) and older than 60 y of age (Group 2) the incidence of MRSA was 18% and 16%. In the experimental groups: diabetic patients younger and older than 60 years of age (Groups 3 and 4) the incidence of MRSA was 20% and 8% respectively. This difference was statistically significant (p =0.0245). Resistance of the MRSA samples was 0 for vancomycin, 22% for gatifloxacillin and 25% for moxifloxacillin.. Among the patients with MRSA younger than 60 y, only one patient in the control group had resistance. 3 patients each in the non-diabetic and diabetic over 60 groups showed resistance to moxifloxacillin and gatifloxacillin.<br><br>Conclusions-In older, patients, the MRSA isolated, as part of their normal flora was more resistant to some antibiotics.

UV RADIATION VS. MUTATION: EFFECTS OF RADIATION ON ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE
Ashley Marie Miller
Aberdeen Central High School, Aberdeen, SD

Ozone depreciation is a major issue, but are some of its effects overlooked? This study focuses on increased intensity of ultraviolet radiation on bacteria. UV radiation can cause thymine dimers to form; even though there are many repair enzymes to fix such alterations, inevitably not all will be corrected. With increased intensity of UV light the chances of mutation are greater. Because bacteria reproduce quickly by binary fission, these mutagenic populations could overcome weaker populations. If this happens, once effective treatments could fail and the outcomes would be dramatic. <br><br>To begin six bacteria were cultured. Two control groups were conducted: one using blank disks and another using four antibiotics. One milliliter of bacteria was drawn from the broth cultures and put in a sterile three-sectioned disk and exposed to UV radiation. Then three drops of each bacteria was spread evenly on an agar plate and onto which the antibiotics were placed. This was done for five generations in trials of 30, 60 and 90 seconds of UV radiation.<br><br>The data showed UV radiation does affect antibiotic zones of inhibition. Two interesting outcomes are: 1, overall, bacteria became stronger in the 90 second trials and was weakened in the 60 second trials (30 second results varied); 2, at 90 seconds the control group to the first generation of bacteria was weakened (where 30 seconds was opposite and 60 seconds represented both).<br><br>Overall, as intensity of UV radiation increases the effects on the bacteria are more extreme and decrease some antibiotic’s effectiveness.

BACTERIA SAVING THE ENVIRONMENT: FACTORS INFLUENCING THE PHENOL TOLERANCE OF SOIL BACTERIUM PSEUDOMONAS PUTIDA
Kristina Aare
Narva Senior High School of the Humanities, Narva, Ida-Virumaa, ESTONIA

This research project relates to phenol tolerance of three genetic derivatives of soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida, such as wild-type and its colR and ttgC knockout strains. The practical objectives of the study were formulated as follows: <br><br>1) To test a hypothesis suggesting that metabolically active exponential cells are more phenol-sensitive than metabolically dormant stationary cells.<br><br>2) To examine how different mutant strains manage to tolerate a short-term treatment with lethal concentration of phenol (50 mM).<br><br>In order to estimate the phenol tolerance level of different strains, the author applied the solid medium phenol-stress test. The second analysis was focused on responses of the same strains originating from different growth phases to phenol-shock conditions.<br><br>Basing on the literature overview, it was reasonable to anticipate that the stationary cells would endure the short-term phenol treatment better than the exponential cells. The results of the phenol-shock assay supported the hypothesis, as the stationary cells indeed tolerated phenol better than the exponential bacteria. However, surprisingly, the analysis of different genetic backgrounds revealed that both the ColRS signal transduction system and the TtgABC efflux pump influence the phenol tolerance of growing bacteria only and are negligible in non-growing cells. <br><br>Given that nowadays the use of extremophilic microorganisms is considered one of the most rational technologies for purifying sewage water, it can be concluded that the practical value of this project and further studies in this field are mind-blowing. Knowing tolerance mechanisms of the phenol-degrading bacteria facilitates development of a special methodology for cleaning water from phenolic compounds.

THE EFFECTS OF GRAZER EXCLUSION ON THE COLONIZATION OF HARD SUBSTRATES BY MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES
Joshua Andrew Lewin-Jacus
Lynbrook Senior High School, Lynbrook, NY

The natural driving forces of microbial diversity and community structure are significantly unexplored. In this project, the influence of predators on the colonization of hard substrates by microorganisms was examined. Field sampling and incubation occurred during the summer of 2009 at a marine field station on the southern coast of New Jersey (39°30’32” N, 74°19’29” W). Anoxic, salt marsh sediments were relocated to an oxic environment and enclosed in 6 different pore sizes of Nitex mesh (1-500 micron). Sand packages were re-suspended approximately 2.5 m below the water surface and incubated in situ for 50 days (with 10 day sampling intervals). After collection, total genomic DNA was extracted from the encased sediments using a phenol/chloroform protocol. Small subunit rRNA gene analysis was used to profile the prokaryotic communities in the treatments with Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis. Data indicated 48 +/- 4 OTU's were present on the sands with distinct differences between profiles (in peak height/area and presence/absence of various TRFs) for the different pore size treatments. Peak height data was also used to generate Sorenson’s and Bray Curtis similarity indices. These similarities were used to cluster the profiles by employing a COMbinatorial Polythetic Agglomerative Hierarchical clustering packages (COMPAH). The cluster analysis shows definitive grouping of communities under similar predator exclusion treatments and time points. This suggests that the predators influenced the different colonization patterns in particle attached bacteria and may explain some of the microbial diversity seen in the sedimentary environment.

ATTACHMENT FACTOR SECRETION IN UROPATHOGENIC E. COLI BACTERIA
Erica Brooke Portnoy
Commack High School, Commack, NY

The purpose of this study was to develop a model for uropathogenic Escherichia coli P pilus secretion. P pili are external structures that facilitate adhesion to kidney epithelial cells, playing a major role in bacterial pathogenesis. They are composed of monomeric proteins that are assembled and secreted at the cell surface through the chaperone/usher pathway, in which periplasmic chaperones transport pilus subunits to the outer membrane to be secreted through outer membrane usher proteins. The usher PapC in the pyelonephritis-associated pilus gene cluster was hypothesized to function as a twin-pore, dimeric protein, in which the N-terminal target domains of each monomer alternate in recruiting periplasmic chaperones. A fused usher dimer was created through DNA manipulation to disable single domains by mutation. If the domains alternate in recruiting chaperones, a single disabled domain will disallow pilus expression. Results show that the current linker sequence is able to fuse the usher monomers, but also leads to protein degradation, requiring a modified construct for effective study of N-terminal mutations. Understanding the mechanisms of the chaperone/usher pathway can lead not only to a further understanding of bacterial pathogenesis, but also to the development of novel methods for fighting bacterial infection.

ALTERING LENTIVIRAL TROPISM BY PSEUDOTYPING WITH SPECIFIC RECEPTOR-MEDIATED PROTEINS
Thomas Scott Silver
Bergen Academy for Medical Science and Technology, Hackensack, NJ

One major obstacle in gene therapy has always been the lack of vector specificity. The scientific community has no effective method of transporting genes to specific cells if a naturally occuring virus or other vector does not already exist. This experiment outlines a method of directing viruses to cell lineages of choice, via a modification of the process known as “pseudotyping”, which is the modification of proteins on the surface of enveloped viruses: viruses are pseudotyped with proteins that specifically attach to naturally unique receptors on the cell lines that are to be infected. To prove the viability of pseudotyping, lentiviral particles expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) were pseudotyped with Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Protein G (VSV-G) and introduced to a gastric adenocarcinoma cell line (AGS) in vitro. After 24 hours, flow cytometry revealed that 48% of the AGS cells had been infected, in comparison to nonpseudotyped viruses, which only infected 10% of cells. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the specific receptor-mediated protein pseudotyping concept, this experiment utilized pseudotyped lentiviruses with gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), a protein which attaches to GIP receptor (GIPR). GIPR is a receptor which is unique to pancreatic beta cells, and thus these viruses will specifically target pancreatic beta cells. This method can be applied in order to deliver genes to any cell line that has a unique protein receptor.

DEVELOPMENT OF ANTIBACTERIAL RESISTANCE IN BACTERIA CHRONICALLY EXPOSED TO TRICLOSAN
Aleksandar Jamborcic
Northwest Career and Technical Academy, Las Vegas, NV

Triclosan is an antibacterial agent found in household products such as hand-soap, and has been controversial for its promotion of drug resistance among bacteria. The large amounts of consumed triclosan largely become part of sewage water, and studies show that small amounts of triclosan persist into the effluent fluid from waste water treatment plants. This study aimed to determine the lowest levels of exposure at which triclosan could promote antibiotic resistance among three different species of bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Escherichia coli. The bacteria were grown on a range of triclosan concentrations, using nutrient agar as the medium, for a period of 16 days. The triclosan minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were examined by two-fold broth dilution as well as by non-manufactured epsilometer test strips. Strains of bacteria grown on triclosan-infused media showed unambiguous levels of increased MICs across the board, with higher exposure levels resulting in higher MICs. In particular, E. coli grown at .1 ug/mL and E. aerogenes grown at 0.01 ug/mL showed high levels of increased resistance (MIC > 30 ug/mL). Even at the lowest exposures, there were subsets of the populations showing MIC levels at or above the detection limits of the epsilometer test strips (30 ug/mL). This data shows that there is a very real possibility of widespread environmental selection processes for triclosan resistance arising from continued use of antibacterial household products, and that further research into the full consequences should be conducted.

THERMOPHILIC MICROBES OF THE ELKO HOT HOLE GEOTHERMAL AREA
Kirsten Rae Perry
Elko High School, Elko, NV

Properties of thermophilic microbes thriving in a hot pool beneath Well #23900 in the Elko Hot Hole area were identified. The hot spring’s pH, nitrite, nitrate, ammonia, sulfate, hydrogen sulfide, and copper levels were determined using an eXact Micro 7+ Photometer. Well temperature was measured at 72 degrees Celsius. Iodine, catalase and gram stain tests were performed on the microbes; they were examined underneath a 400X microscope to determine morphology. <br><br> The thermophiles were tested for ammonia-oxidation and/or sulfate-reduction in the field. Sealed vials containing microbes and sample water were placed in the hot spring over a 10 day period; pH, ammonia, sulfate, and hydrogen sulfide levels were monitored. Vials containing microbes saw significant decrease in sulfate levels. All other levels remained stable. A second 48-hour test was run, using similar techniques outlined in the first 10-day test with only sulfate levels tested. Over the two-day period, sulfate decreased from over 100 mg/L to less than 1 mg/L.<br><br> Sulfate-reducing thermophiles were present in the hot spring’s underwater microbial mats; ammonia-oxidizing microbes were absent. Based on the temperature range of the hot spring, the anaerobic microbes were identified as either bacteria genus Thermodesulfobacterium or Archaea Archaeoglobus.<br><br>Possible practical application of these sulfate-reducing microbes includes the reduction of sulfate in water supplies.

COMPARISON AND IDENTIFICATION OF ANTIBIOTICS PRODUCED BY BACTERIA IN HIGH-NUTRIENT AND LOW-NUTRIENT ENVIRONMENTS
Hee Sung Park
Carlsbad High School, Carlsbad, NM

The research was conducted with bacterial samples from two different locations within Coffee Cave in Eddy County, New Mexico and one location on Brantley Lake 2.5 km southwest of the cave. In Coffee Cave, it is anticipated that the nutrients from above ground are very limited because it is a hypogenic cave, making it an ideal location for low-nutrient environment. The objectives of this study are: to compare the frequency of antibiotic production of bacteria and its efficiency from two different types of environments; to identify antibiotic producing bacteria using PCR and DNA sequencing; to identify antibiotics produced by bacteria.<br><br> Cave-cultured samples were left at the site for one week for optimal growth. Lake samples were contaminated by rain and airborne bacteria. Lake water sample will be brought back to the lab and cultured. Bacterial samples were cultured on R2A plates.<br><br> Bacterial samples collected from the cave sites were isolated. Isolated colonies were tested for antibiotic production against Escherichia coli DH5 alpha. Five of 18 isolated colonies produced antibiotics. Three of these produced zones of inhibition greater than 1 cm in diameter; these colonies’ antibiotics will be processed through chromatographic fractionation for identification. Cave- and lake- cultured bacteria will be tested for antibiotic production against E. coli K12 (Gram-negative) and Staphylococcus epididymis (Gram-positive). DNA sequencing results identified colonies that produced antibiotics as Pseudomonas spp., Bacillus spp., and Bacillus subtilis. Water samples will be used for water chemistry analysis in order to compare the nutrient level among different locations.

PVISIA, VACCINE VECTOR FOR ANTIGEN PRESENTATION
Vishwajith Sridharan
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Alexandria, VA

The Escherichia coli adhesin-involved-in-diffuse-adherence (AIDA) autodisplay expression cassette functions by directing a specific passenger protein across the bacterial membrane and tethering it to the surface. This project details the design and testing of an optimized synthetic vector, named pVISIA, which allows for the surface display of immunogenic proteins via the AIDA system. The vector was designed in silico, and includes a mechanism for antibiotic selection, as well as a thymidylate synthase (thyA) gene for plasmid maintainance in thyA- bacterial hosts. pVISIA also includes a means to identify individual plasmids, via a DNA ‘barcode’ from among a large population of plasmids each bearing a different passenger protein. The vector’s barcoding capability is implemented by insertion of unique 16S rRNA gene sequences, which will enable the identification and quantitation of individual plasmid populations via the Phylochip microarray platform. The vector was produced via gene synthesis. Successful surface display of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) peptide was demonstrated via trypsinization of whole cells and western blotting. Further quantitation techniques revealed over 80,000 copies of the HA peptide surface-displayed per gram-negative cell, indicating that the AIDA system is a promising paradigm for antigen presentation in stimulating an immune response. Ultimately, pVISIA will serve as a key enabling technology for an in vivo screening approach to identify highly immunogenic proteins that may be useful as potential HIV vaccine candidates.

THE EFFECT OF UV-C RADIATION ON CATALASE ACTIVITY IN STAPHYLOCOCCUS EPIDERMIS AND IN VITRO
Andrew Nickolas Abboud
Tippecanoe High School, Tipp City, OH

The effect of ultraviolet radiation on catalase activity has not been widely studied. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a germicidal dose of UV-C radiation on catalase activity in Staphylococcus epidermidis and on the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide by catalase in vitro. It was hypothesized that a germicidal dose of UV-C radiation inhibits catalase activity in vivo and in vitro. Ten bacterial cultures of Staphylococcus epidermidis were tested for catalase activity before and after exposure to UV-C light at progressively increasing doses. All samples tested positive for catalase immediately after UV-C exposure. All samples were sub-cultured, incubated, visually inspected for growth, and retested for catalase activity. One sample was exposed to a bactericidal dose, as evident by absence of bacterial growth in sub-culture. This sample was positive for catalase activity immediately after exposure to a germicidal dose of UV C, demonstrating that bacterial death occurred before catalase activity was inhibited. The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide by catalase was tested in vitro under the same germicidal UV C radiation dose and compared to a control reaction. Oxygen gas production rates of both reactions were equivalent, indicating that UV-C radiation did not inhibit catalase activity in vitro. These results disprove the hypothesis that a germicidal dose of ultraviolet radiation to Staphylococcus epidermidis inhibits catalase, as demonstrated by the persistence of activity in vivo and in vitro, after exposure to a germicidal dose of UV-C radiation. The effect of UV-C radiation on catalase in other microorganisms should be further studied.

A SOLUTION TO THE WORLDWIDE MALARIA EPIDEMIC: A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY OF IRON AND NITRIC OXIDE'S EFFECT ON THE GROWTH AND SURVIVAL OF TOXOPLASMA GONDII
Matthew Karmen McIntyre
Yorktown High School, Yorktown Heights, NY

Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular protozoan parasite that forms tissue cysts in the neurologic and cardiac tissue of infected individuals. Unborn fetuses can be infected with the parasite and develop toxoplasmosis resulting in birth defects. In fact, toxoplasmosis is represented by the “T” in the well known mnemonic “T.O.R.C.H.” representing teratogenic infectious agents. Interestingly, T.gondii has the ability to survive in macrophages (Mφ) and even hijacks monocytes and dendritic cells to pass the blood brain barrier to infect the brain. Activation of the Mφ can slow parasite replication and in some cases even kill the parasite. During Mφ activation from lipopolysaccharide and IFN-γ, many changes occur in the macrophage that can aid killing of intracellular microbes like T. gondii. Specifically, this study focuses on the interactions between T.gondii and macrophage nitric oxide and iron. Nitric oxide and iron both play multiple roles in the normal life cycles of all organisms. High or low concentrations of nitric oxide and iron could be unfavorable for T.gondii replication due to genetic mutations or other damage to the parasite. Using a panel of parasite mutants’ defective for survival in activated macrophages, we evaluated whether macrophage iron concentrations or nitric oxide contributed to their increased susceptibility to macrophage activation. We were able to determine that both nitric oxide and iron concentration affect survival of Toxoplasma gondii in activated macrophages. Furthermore we found the increased susceptibility of some of the mutants to macrophage activation was due in part to increased susceptibility to concentrations of nitric oxide or iron.

THE INTERACTIONS OF COTO SUGGEST A NOVEL METHOD OF SPORE INACTIVATION
Jack Benjamin Greisman
Stuyvesant High School, New York, NY

B. anthracis endospores, the etiological agent of anthrax, are metabolically inactive cells that are capable of enduring adverse conditions. This unique resistance is endowed by the spore coat, a proteinaceous shell, composed of over 70 species of proteins. The formation of this coat is controlled largely by a subset of proteins, called spore coat morphogenetic proteins. The role of one such protein, CotO, was investigated in Bacillus subtilis, a close relative of B. anthracis. It was shown that the localization of CotO to the spore surface is dependent upon CotE (which controls the assembly of the outer coat), SpoVID (which is necessary for spore encasement), and SpoIVA. By yeast two-hybrid assays, it was found that CotO is capable of interacting directly with two of these morphogenetic proteins, CotE and SpoVID. In conjunction, these data sets suggest that CotO interacts directly with CotE and SpoVID during spore formation. The amino acid sequences of the interacting protein regions contain motifs of charged amino acids, which suggest both a plausible explanation for these interactions, and also a possible drug target – a site that when blocked may disrupt the integrity of the spore coat, rendering spores susceptible to inactivation and decontamination.

THE GROWTH OF MICROFLORA ON SILICONE WRISTBANDS
Timothy Devon Morris
Central Virginia Governor's School for Science and Technology, Lynchburg, VA

The purpose of this project was to determine if silicone rubber assisted in carrying microflora, thus supporting the spread of bacterial and yeast related diseases. The study was conducted at a high school in December 2009. In each of the three trials silicone wristbands were evaluated according to different levels of human contact. The three levels being air contact, human contact with disinfection, and human contact without disinfection. Each wristband was placed in a 50ml centrifuge tube and vortexed for thirty seconds. Dilutions were then created according to the testing group (1:100 for all yeast tests and the air contact bacterial test and 1:10,000 for human contact with disinfections, and human contact without disinfection bacterial tests). The dilutions were run through a filter via a Millipore® vacuum pump and the filters were placed on Petri-pads soaked with specified broths. These filters were allowed to culture and then the colonies were counted. The results from two ANOVA tests show the two P values (6.14x10-7 for yeast and mold colonies and 3.83x10-4 for bacterial colonies) to be less than the set alpha value (0.05). The alternated hypothesis that not all means are equal was accepted. In conclusion, silicone rubber harbored microflora and is a possible agent in spreading bacteria and is a possible agent in spreading diseases.

QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON BACTERIAL GROWTH RATES
Peter Lee Zhan
Aragon High School, San Mateo, CA

The purpose of this project was to mathematically analyze the influence of temperature on bacterial growth using fundamental chemical and statistical principles.<br><br> In my experiment, I incubated E. coli at various temperatures. All E. coli used came from a common stock. At various times, I measured the optical density (OD) of the cultures. By performing nonlinear regressions, I obtained the growth rate constants at different temperatures. I only included data from the exponential growth phase. I then analyzed the correlation between expected growth rate constants based on the Arrhenius equation and observed growth rate constants.<br><br> Three major conclusions may be drawn from my data. First, at low temperatures, bacteria significantly upregulate their metabolic rate; their growth rate constant k is much larger than the predicted rate based on simple chemical principles. Second, below optimal temperatures, both the growth rate constant and the chemical reaction rate constant increase as temperature increases, albeit at different rates. Third, bacteria are significantly more susceptible to temperature changes than are chemical reactions. These findings are particularly alarming as we face global warming, since even relatively small increases in temperature in any temperature range pose risks to the delicate nature of life's regulatory abilities.

DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION OF NOVEL SCREEN FOR DETECTING BIOFILM-INHIBITING METABOLITES IN FOUR BACTERIA STRAINS: E. COLI, B. SUBTILIS, A. TUMEFACIENS AND P. AERUGINOSA
Christina Kun Wang
Shanghai American School, Shanghai, Shanghai, CHINA

Pertinent research on biofilms focuses extensively on single-species biofilms and non-bacterial metabolites, while the involvement of bacterial metabolites in interspecies interaction has not been extensively researched. This study aimed to characterize the presence of biofilm-inhibiting metabolites in E. coli, B. subtilis, A. tumefaciens and P. aeruginosa by pinpointing the time of greatest effect, the magnitude, and the morphological differences induced by metabolites on biofilms of the same four species. Supernatant analysis was used to simulate interspecies biofilm interaction in nature. It was hypothesized that 1) the supernatants’ peak inhibition of biofilms would occur at the late-log phase, 2) the peak inhibition would reveal a linear relationship with a dosage response and 3) biofilm inhibition revealed through biomass would result in lower antibiotic resistance. Phase 1 indicated the time of peak inhibition through CV-extraction quantification of biomass in 96-well plates and comparison with the control group with sterile LB. The greatest negative % change from the control occurred at the late-log, consistent with the hypothesis. Qualitative analysis revealed weaker dispersal and structure in inhibited biofilms. Phase 2 added 20, 40 and 60 microliters of supernatants from the hour of peak effect. The linear relationship between dosage and % negative change in biomass was consistent with the hypothesis. The third phase added 1/1000 v/v ampicillin to P. aeruginosa biofilms. Antibiotic resistance was directly related with preliminary biomass results. The study narrowed the time to isolate metabolites and indicated morphological changes induced by the bacterial metabolites, focusing further research direction in controlling biofilms.

REEXAMINING THE MECHANISM-OF-ACTION OF HOECHST 33342 UPON CANDIDA ALBICANS AND SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE YEAST CELLS
Stanford Jeremy Schor
Brighton High School, Rochester, NY

In recent years, the prevalence of immunocompromised individuals has increased in direct conjunction with a similar trend in the occurrence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cases, chemotherapy, and organ transplants. This has led to a heightened search for antifungal compounds. Hoechst 33342, a Biz-Benzimide family fluorescent DNA stain, is one such compound that is being examined for such properties. Experimentation showed that the mechanism of Hoechst 33342 is not, as previously published, through interaction at the DNA level. This is illustrated by the combined results of a positive β-galactosidase assay and a competitive growth assay with log2 ratios of the appropriate gene knockouts. Furthermore, similar methodology was used to show that Hoechst 33342 acts through the RLM1 cell wall stress response sub-pathway specifically, and leaves the SBF (Swi4/Swi6) secondary sub-pathway of the stress response inactivated. As these results indicate a greater activation of the unfolded protein response (a novel characteristic of antifungal compounds), it is likely that further research will distill this pathway in a way that will allow bio-technicians to create an even more effective antifungal agent.

A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EXTENDED SPECTRUM BETA-LACTAMASE (ESBL) AND NON-ESBL ESCHERICHIA COLI: SCREENING FOR MULTIDRUG RESISTANCES AND PLASMID ANALYSES USING MINIPREP AND PLASMID CURING METHODS
Taylor Diahann Gaines
Seneca High School, Seneca, MO

Antibiotic resistance is becoming a worldwide epidemic. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) bacteria carry a mutation that produces an enzyme that disables beta- lactam antibiotics. This mutation is carried on a plasmid. The intent of this project was to screen hospital strains of ESBL Escherichia coli and non-ESBL Escherichia coli for resistances to various classes of antibiotics, and to characterize the plasmids isolated from these strains. Antibiotic susceptibility testing using the Kirby-Bauer method was performed using six common antibiotics. Comparisons were made between the ESBL and non-ESBL strains to see if there were similar trends in resistance. Plasmids were characterized using Quantum Prep Plasmid Analysis to isolate the plasmid with and without a restriction enzyme. After the electrophoresis was run, plasmid curing was performed to analyze whether the resistance was carried on a plasmid. The antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed that ESBL strains showed significantly more resistances than the Non-ESBL strains. Plasmid DNA Electrophoresis showed that there were plasmids present in every strain and the approximate number of base pairs which was around 4000. Plasmid curing revealed that many of the resistances for ESBLs were shown to not be plasmid-mediated. Non-ESBL resistance had half the strains showing to be plasmid-mediated.

Antibiotic resistance is reaching beyond hospital walls and into our communities. Can synthetic and naturally occurring compounds combat this pandemic? The rationale of this project was to synthesize various ketoximes and aldoximes, compounds that have never been tested for their antimicrobial properties, and use naturally occurring compounds to investigate their affects on various multi-drug resistant clinical isolates. Multiple aldehydes and ketones were used in conjunction with hydroxylamine to produce oximes crystals. Sterile sensi-tabs were saturated with each compound and the Kirby-Baur Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing determined the effectiveness against strains of MDR gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to deduce their antimicrobial properties. Using the Kirby-Bauer method four polyphenols (Red Wine Extract, Bitter Orange, Olive Leaf Extract, and Licorice Root) were tested for their antimicrobial properties. Then, using two different procedures the synergistic effect between the polyphenols and antibiotics were evaluated. Oximes showed no antimicrobial properties. The polyphenols completely inhibited the growth of two gram-negative, ESBL-producing bacteria; and, when used in conjunction with antibiotics significant evidence was found showing there was a synergistic effect against the multi-drug resistant bacteria.

ANTIFUNGAL EFFECTS AND IDENTIFICATION OF EISENIA FOETIDA BACTERIA ON BATRACHOCHYTRIUM DENDROBATIDIS (BD), AN AMPHIBIAN PATHOGENIC FUNGUS, YEAR II
Jayton Lewis Rainey
Slaton High School, Slaton, TX

Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is an amphibian pathogenic fungus that causes chytridiomycosis, a fungal infection of the skin, and is responsible for amphibian extinctions worldwide. In this experiment, five bacteria isolates from the surface of earthworms, Eisenia foetida, were characterized and used in an inhibition assay. <br><br>Four methods were used to identify bacteria as Gram negative or positive: Gram Stains, MacConkey’s agar, Mannitol Salt agar, and Biolog Microbial Identification. MacConkey’s agar and Mannitol Salt agar were used as a differential growth medium to assess biochemical fermentation. Supernatants were extracted from each isolate cultured in a nutrient broth. Filtered supernatants and boiled controls of each were used in the inhibition test. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis was susceptible to one isolate. Three replicates of the inhibiting isolate averaged strong zones of inhibition, 18.33 mm, and controls produced no zones. In addition, Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) procedure and silver stain was used with all five isolates to separate proteins. Seven proteins within the inhibiting bacteria were separated and identified between the following molecular weight markers: 26 and 118 kilo Daltons. Finally, results from a Biolog Microbial Identification test identified the inhibiting bacteria: Delftia acidovorans (88%). The antifungal potential from the naturally produced proteins of Delftia acidovorans in controlling Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis has not been previously reported. The prospects for sustainable fungal treatment from these bacteria may be significant in amphibian survival in natural environmental ecosystems, zoo collections, commercial trade, and science laboratories.

Tyler Daniel Kubina
Tuscarawas Valley High School, Zoarville, OH

The goal of this study was to analyze the bacterial diversity in cigarettes and to ascertain if cigarettes could potentially be harboring any human pathogens.<br><br> Tobacco garnered from one cigarettes was suspended in saline, and after blending via a vortex mixer, serial 10-fold dilutions were made. Aliquots of 0.1-ml from each dilution were spred on triplicate sets of five Petri dishes. Differential agar media were used to cultivate bacteria. Brain Heart Infusion, Eosin Methylene Blue, and Phenylethyl Alcohol agars were all employed. All plates were incubated at 37°C for 48 hours. Colony-forming Units were calculated at 24 hour intervals.<br><br> Gram and endospore stains were performed from pure cultures; multiple biochemical tests were completed in addition to aid in identifying the unknown microorganisms in the tobacco. Results from each test were verified after 24 hours of incubation at 37°C.<br><br> The metagenome of tobacco was investigated through polymerase chain reactions. A fragment of the 16S rRNA gene corresponding to positions 518 to 1513 of the Eschericia coli 16S rRNA was amplified from each isolate. The fragment strands were sequenced after PCR and identified using NCBI BLAST. Agarose gel electrophoresis was performed to verify whether the PCR generated the anticipated amplicons.<br><br> After testing was completed, it was concluded a high concentration of bacteria exists, including human pathogens, in cigarettes. A number of Bacillus and Nocardia specied were identified from culturing; E. coli (AD) and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis were identfied from biochemical tests. The hypothesis was therefore proven correct.

USING REVERSE VACCINOLOGY TO IDENTIFY GENE CANDIDATES FOR USE IN A VACCINE TO PREVENT ESCHERICHIA COLI-INDUCED POST-WEANING DIARRHEA IN SWINE (SUS DOMESTICA)
Somer Marie Drummond
Breck School, Golden Valley, MN

The purpose of my project was to use reverse vaccinology to develop a broad-spectrum, attenuated vaccine for post-weaning diarrhea in swine (Sus domestica). Reverse vaccinology involves surveying an entire genome to identify gene candidates which express proteins that have potential to be used in a vaccine. I used M-PCR and gel electrophoresis to determine prevalence of twenty-nine genes that a study by Johnson (2008) identified as vaccine candidates. I screened 426 porcine E. coli boil preps from three locations in the E. coli genome; these included 100 neonatal diarrhea E. coli preps, 203 post-weaning diarrhea E. coli preps, and 123 healthy porcine-fecal preps. Results showed that twelve genes were significantly more prevalent in post-weaning diarrhea preps than in healthy (p < 0.05), and six genes were significantly more prevalent in both neonatal and post-weaning diarrhea preps than in healthy (p < 0.05). Ideal gene candidates will be those that are prevalent in both neonatal and post-weaning diarrhea, because a vaccine could then be developed to protect against both neonatal and post-weaning diarrhea. Future work will include using reverse vaccinology to identify additional genes that may serve as potential gene candidates for a broad-spectrum vaccine against neonatal and post-weaning diarrhea in swine. Then, the prevalence of these genes will be determined in order to identify sufficient numbers of genes to provide complete coverage against all bacterial strains of porcine E. coli. The final step is to prepare and run clinical trials on an attenuated vaccine against neonatal and post-weaning diarrhea.

ANTIBACTERIAL AND ANTI-INFLAMMATORY EFFECTS OF MYRICETIN AGAINST AN ACNE-CAUSING BACTERIUM (THIRD YEAR STUDY)
Lori Kim
Homeschool, Salt Lake City, UT

My previous research showed that antioxidants found in pomegranate could inhibit the acne bacterium, Propionibacterium acnes. This year, an in-depth study was conducted to identify an antioxidant that had antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects against P. acnes. Acne is known to be the combined result of a bacterial infection and the inflammatory response to that infection. Thus, it was hypothesized that if an antioxidant had antibacterial effects against P. acnes then it should also have anti-inflammatory effects as well in order to be considered an anti-acne agent.<br><br> This year, five antioxidants found in pomegranate were tested in an in-vitro study for antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, and one antioxidant named myricetin was identified as having both properties. Antibacterial tests against P. acnes were carried out in terms of MIC, MBC, and time kill curves following the CLSI methods. Anti-inflammatory properties in terms of production of COX-2, iNOS, Smad-7, IL-1alpha, and IL-8 in HaCaT cells stimulated by P. acnes were tested using RT-PCR and Western blot methods. <br><br> Myricetin did not induce HaCaT cytotoxicity at concentrations below 100 uM as determined using the MTT assay. Furthermore, myricetin inhibited P. acnes, decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1alpha and IL-8, and suppressed phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha and translocation of NF-kappaB. In contrast, myricetin increased the production of Smad-7, an anti-inflammatory agent naturally found in our bodies. These results conclude that myricetin has the potential to be used as an alternative anti-acne agent in the future.

Water eutrophication of Salto Grande Reservoir has a huge impact on the development of toxigenic cyanobacteria blooms. Many cyanobacteria species are producers of toxins (cyanotoxins) and the frequency and intensity of algal blooms have increased worldwide in the last years, resulting in severe health, economic and environmental effects.<br><br>In order to attend to the impact of the regional cyanobacterial blooms, this research studied the presence of potentially toxic cyanobacteria in the raw and drinking water network of regional urban area and quantified microcystins concentration present there.<br><br>Six sampling sites were chosen. The samples were collected fortnightly or weekly during nine months. The phytoplankton analysis was made using an optic microscope for qualitative and Uthermöl method for the phytoplankton recount. The detection of microcystins was performed using High Performance Liquid Cromatography (HPLC DAD UV).<br><br>Microsistis sp. cells and pieces of trichoma of Anabaena sp. were founded in the water mains samples. The 68.18% of them had a microcistins concentration that was higer than the toleance value suggested by the WHO (1 microgram/litre). The presence of cyanobacteria on Salto Grande Reservoir had a negative impact on the drinking water quality of the city located downstream of the reservoir. Therefore, a simple and alternative household method was proposed to reduce the contamination with microcystins in drinking water and to protect human health from chronic exposure to microcystins.<br><br>The results were reported to the regional authorities who carried out actions in order to improve the quality of drinking water.

IMPACT OF DI(2-ETHYLHEXYL)PHTHALATE(DEHP) ON THE MORTALITY, GROWTH, AND REPRODUCTION OF CAENORHABDITIS ELEGANS
Chia Yu JaJa Liao
Wilson Senior High School, Florence, SC

The controversial and toxic di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) was tested for its effects on the growth, mortality, and reproduction of the soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. In 2000, Puerto Rican scientists reported on a link between high phthalate exposure and premature puberty in girls. Phthalates are completely banned from all personal health products in Europe. DEHP, the most commonly used phthalate and pseudo-estrogen, was hypothesized to have overall negative effects on the three endpoints (high mortality, less growth, and less reproduction). Four different concentrations of DEHP were tested: 2 mg/l, 0.2 mg/l, 0.02 mg/l, and 0 mg/l. Feeding off colonies of Escherichia coli, around 10 young adult nematodes grew in each petri dish for 48 hours at 25º Celsius. Mortality was first determined by observation and probing with a nichrome wire, growth was evaluated by measuring the length of each worm using a stage micrometer after nematodes were slowed down using a Bunsen burner, and reproduction was assessed by counting the number of eggs in each nematode. The experiment was performed a total of seven times to ensure accuracy. The results supported the experimental hypothesis. DEHP had significantly negative effects on the C. elegans populations and caused decreases in growth and egg count. The overall conclusion could be simply summarized as the following- the higher the DEHP concentration, the more apparent the toxicities. This experiment not only shows that C. elegans can be used to detect DEHP in soil (notably landfill sites with plastic waste) and bodies of water, but also that DEHP could be toxic to humans as well. Lastly, since DEHP is a pseudo-estrogen, it could have the ability to proliferate breast and uterine cells, which can eventually lead to cancer.

PURIFICATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF A PEPTIDE ANTIBIOTIC PRODUCED BY THE HUMAN MICROBIOME BACTERIUM BACILLUS FLEXUS
Andrew James Macgregor
Butte High School, Butte, MT

The purpose of this project was to purify a novel antibiotic from the human earwax bacterium Bacillus flexus. It displayed antibiotic activity against the human pathogenic bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is the causative agent of pneumococcal pneumonia, one of the two most important bacterial causes of inner ear infections, and the most important cause of bacterial meningitis in both adults and children. The chemical – as opposed to biological – basis of the antibiotic activity was determined and the purification of the antibiotic compounds was begun.<br><br> Following the principles of Bioassay-Guided Fractionation, a series of liquid-solid chromatographic techniques was used to resolve the antibiotic products of B. flexus into four compounds. Both one-dimensional and two-dimensional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy experiments and mass spectrometry were used to help determine the nature of these almost pure compounds. Pattern recognition analysis of the proton NMR spectra indicated that these antibiotics are peptidal in nature and contain the amino acids phenylalanine, valine, leucine, and proline. Comparison of these spectral data to that of known peptidal antibiotics produced by other species of Bacillus showed several important differences. These previously reported structures contain the amino acids diaminobutyric acid, ornithine, tyrosine, and tryptophan, which do not appear to be present in the peptide antibiotics of Bacillus flexus. <br><br> As more pathogenic bacteria develop antibiotic resistance the search for new antibiotics becomes more compelling. Careful spectroscopic analysis of the compounds isolated from B. flexus suggested that they are indeed unique and could serve as new agents against Streptococcus induced illnesses.

GERMS VERSUS SPICES: THE POWER OF FLAVOR AGAINST PATHOGENIC BACTERIA
Sajal Kumar Tiwary
Sumner Hill Junior High School, Clinton, MS

The purpose of this project was to determine the effect of spices on certain bacteria. My hypothesis was that certain spices may slightly inhibit the growth of bacteria. To test this hypothesis, a disk diffusion test was conducted. Filter paper disks were soaked in solutions of turmeric, coriander, and garlic juice. One disk per spice was place on the inoculated media. The tests were conducted on four species of bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli.<br><br> The observations of the bacterial growth somewhat supported my hypothesis. The turmeric and coriander had no effect at all on any of the bacteria tested. The garlic juice inhibited the growth of Enterobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli. On the basis of the sizes of the zones of inhibition, these bacteria may be classified as intermediately susceptible to garlic juice.

EFFECTS OF IBUPROFEN ON H. LITTORALIS FEEDING REFLEX
Jeannette A. Daida
Huron High School, Ann Arbor, MI

Regulated water treatment and disposal helps to ensure clean water supply. However, because not all contaminants are regulated, water may not be purified relative to those contaminants. Common unregulated contaminants that can be found in a water supply include over-the-counter drugs. I investigate how an over-the-counter drug may affect a littoral ecosystem. I specifically examine the effects of ibuprofen on the feeding behavior of H. littoralis, a common freshwater species. I hypothesize that ibuprofen should interfere with this species’ ability to feed and that its feeding reflex would be noticeably slowed. Hydra rely on glutathione emitted by their prey to capture and consume their prey. Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that reduces glutathione production. Ibuprofen may interfere with this link.<br><br>My experiment focused on H. littoralis’ feeding reflex, which was measured by timing the duration between capture and ingestion of Artemia. Baseline feeding reflex of H. littoralis was recorded for a month. The group of hydra were then chronically exposed to specific concentrations of ibuprofen. Low levels of ibuprofen (20 mg/L) were not immediately detrimental to the H. littoralis, but gradually slowed its feeding reflex. Exposure to 40 mg/L of ibuprofen resulted in an immediate slowing of feeding reflex; by the third day of testing, H. littoralis stopped feeding. My results supports the hypothesis that ibuprofen interferes and slows the feeding reflex of H. littoralis. More slowing was correlated to increasing concentrations of ibuprofen.

BROCCOLI GOING GREEN AND ITS EFFECT ON BACTERIA GROWTH 2010
Alexis Diamond Kennedy
Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Baltimore, MD

This study focused on extracting antibiotic chemicals from broccoli. When broccoli is macerated during the chewing process, research has shown that there is a potent antibiotic (Sulfaraphine) present.This antibiotic has been reported to lower levels of H.phylori,a bacterium that is closely associated with the risk of stomach damage and gastric cancer. The purpose of this research was to find out which maceration process(cutting, chopping or blending) will activate the antibiotic from different parts of the broccoli. The three extracts( cutting,chopped and blended) were made from the flower and the stalk of the broccoli. Filter disks were soak in the solution for two minutes, five of the soaked disks were placed on each Petri plate that contained isolated bacteria from computer keyboards. The Petri plates were incubated for 24 hours. Petri plates were observed to have no clear "halos". The soaked disks were removed. There were signs of resistant activity( diameter<17mm), meaning that bacteria did not grow under the disks. The same observations were made for all the soaked disks on each Petri plates in this study. For further studies, varying concentrations of the antibiotic(.1%,.2%,3%) and maceration processess( grinding, mashing, pounding) are needed to develop standard conditions to reproduce antibiotics from different parts of the broccoli, so the many properties of the antibiotics found in broccoli can be used for medical purposes such as: inhibiting cancer growth, protecting skin against UV radiation damage and its effect on dietary consumption.

SCREENING HAWAIIAN MARINE DERIVED YEAST AND FUNGI FOR PRODUCTION OF ANTI-BACTERIAL COMPOUNDS
Genardine Arizala
Waipahu High School, Waipahu, HI

Approximately 60 distinct species of marine yeast and fungi were isolated from seawater and sediment samples to test for anti-bacterial properties. The samples were collected from four locations on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. The collected organisms were subsequently grown in pure culture and grown in close proximity to several bacterial species, which cause human infection. Any inhibition of bacterial growth caused by the fungi or yeast served as evidence of potential anti-bacterial compound secretion. Therefore any inhibition observed served as a basis for further study. Although some inhibition of bacterial growth has been documented, it is likely that the most drastic inhibition noted is a consequence of acid production by yeast and not anti-bacterial organic compounds. One of the cultured fungi potentially secreted anti-bacterial properties and further studies will be conducted on that specific culture.

INVESTIGATING CELL TO CELL CLUMPING ON A MOLECULAR BASIS IN THE BACTERIUM AZOSPIRILLUM BRASILENSE
Taylor Wesley Jones
Alcoa High School, Alcoa, TN

The soil bacterium, Azospirillum brasilense, is capable of differentiating into various cell types as a survival strategy for growth in different environments. One such type of differentiation involves cell-to-cell interactions (clumping) that takes place under nutritionally stressful conditions. I hypothesized exopolysaccharides that are rich in glucose are specific for clumping cells and are directly involved in inducing the clumping behavior, by acting as “glue” between cells in A. brasilense. This is important for the agricultural, industrial, and medical worlds because all can greatly benefit from the ability to control cell flocculation. Its importance lies within biofertilization, bioenergy, and relevance with the study of biofilms. My research involved multiple experiments and designing assays to gain insight into the role(s) of OMPs and EPS in clumping behavior. Specifically, my goals were to (1) identify and understand mechanisms behind clumping behavior (2) use glucose-rich EPS extracted from clumping cells to induce clumping behavior in cells that are not yet clumping, and (3) characterize specific function of OMPs and EPS in clumping behavior using newly designed assays to better understand EPS/OMP analysis. It was shown that glucose-rich EPS extracted from cells during clumping behavior were able to induce clumping in free-swimming cells. Also, it was shown that a specific outer membrane protein is affected by Pronase and Proteinase K. This suggests that both OMP’s and glucose-rich EPS have significant roles in clumping. Together, these experiments will provide further insight into the importance of OMPs and glucose-rich EPS to clumping behavior in A. brasilense.

CINNAMOMUM VERUM (CINNAMON) AS A NATURAL FUNGICIDE
Ruth M. Martell
Centro Residencial de Oportunidades Educativas, Mayaguez, PUERTO RICO

The chemicals used to protect agriculture are not only inefficient, but they can also damage the environment, crops, animals and human health. Identifying a natural fungicide can represent a solution to this problem. This investigation has the purpose to determine if there is a significant relationship between the cinnamon extracts and the growth inhibition of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides fungus. The hypothesis was that there is a significant relationship between Cinnamomunm verum (cinnamon) and the growth inhibition of the fungus. To test the hypothesis cinnamon liquid and powder samples were acquired. Serial dilutions from those samples were made (10^-1 to 10^-4) to resolve whether or not the presence of some natural microbial flora could interfere with the fungicide effect. The Colletotrichum gloeosporioides fungus was cultivated in thirty-six Petri dishes using SDA as the culture medium. Twelve of these Petri dishes were used as control groups. Six of them were inoculated with the fungus and six only had one of the different cinnamon concentrations. The experimental group was the remaining Petri dishes which were divided into groups of five each with specific cinnamon concentrations: 0.1%, 1%, 5%, 10% and 25%. They were incubated at ±25°C for a five day period during which observations were made. In the plates identified as P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5 with 10% concentration of cinnamon, only one colony with reduced diameter grew. Meanwhile, nothing grew in the 25% concentration. The results evidenced a direct proportional relationship between the cinnamon concentrations and the fungus inability to grow.

FIGHTING BAC!!, PHASE III: THE EFFECTS OF FLAVONOID FRACTIONS FROM CRANBERRY EXTRACT INHIBITING PROLIFERATION OF ESCHERICHIA COLI
Jordan Mark Grainger
Rio Rancho High School, Rio Rancho, NM

The purpose of my experiment was to determine which flavonoid fraction of cranberry extract would increase the sensitivity of the bacteria, Escherichia coli, and make it more susceptible to antibiotics. The hypothesis proposed if the extract is chromatographed into fractions and exposed to E. coli cultures, then the tannin, proanthocyanidin, would significantly increase the bacteria’s sensitivity, because of its ability to inhibit proliferation. The methodology used consisted of gel and vacuum chromatography, in which the extract was separated into fractions based on molecular weight and chemical composition; Disk diffusion, in which filter-paper disks were soaked in the fractions, plated on bacteria-cultured petri dishes, and the zones of inhibition were measured after incubation; and a serum bactericidal test (SBT), in which bacteria were exposed to various dilutions of the purified cranberries, incubated for 24 hours and checked for turbidity.<br><br>The results displayed that the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) eluate that contained positively charged, antioxidant molecules, proanthocyanidins and anthocyanins, had a similar zone of inhibition as the original cranberry sample. It was also concluded that dilutions of 1:2 to 1:16 of the sample were effective at inhibiting the proliferation of E. coli in a 15 minute period.<br><br>With further experimentation, I intend to research which flavonoid within the PBS eluate is responsible for the potent antibacterial properties of cranberries. In order to do this, a Sephadex gel of less than 25,000Da, would be implemented in the chromatography column.

EVALUATION OF THE KILLING EFFECTS OF ANTIBIOTICS WITH EQUINE POLYMORPHONUCLEAR NEUTROPHILS AGAINST STREPTOCOCCUS EQUI AND RHODOCOCCUS EQUI
Rachel Marie Rudlaff
Kalamazoo Area Mathematics and Science Center, Kalamazoo, MI

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the killing ability of equine polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) by determining if they would take up any of the three investigational drugs tested to cause an enhanced bacterial killing effect. PMNs were isolated from equine blood using the Ficoll-Paque PLUS method, and Streptococcus equi and Rhodococcus equi were added to PMNs to phagocytize. The three test drugs as well as the positive (rifampin) and negative (cloxacillin) control drugs were added to the PMNs with engulfed bacteria. Enhanced killing ability was determined by the plate count of bacteria. It was determined that strains of S. equi used in the study were not encapsulated; therefore, they did not have defenses against the neutrophils, and bacteria were killed regardless of the added drug. The strain of R. equi was encapsulated and appeared more difficult for the PMNs to kill. A significantly enhanced killing effect was seen with all three of the investigational drugs for R. equi as there was a significant reduction in the mean bacteria concentration compared to tests with cloxacillin, the negative control, and the tests where no drugs were introduced.

MICROBIAL INHIBITORY ACTIVITIES OF EXTRACTS FROM SEVEN PHILIPPINE SEAWEEDS
MarcArthur Jordan Irlandez Limpiado
Philippine Science High School-Eastern Visayas Campus, Tacloban City, Leyte, PHILIPPINES

Antibiotics have long been used to kill pathogenic bacteria. However, over the years, antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria have developed. Considering the harmful nature of these microorganisms, it is important for scientists to find new substances that could inhibit their growth. <br><br>The study tested the microbial inhibitory activities of the aqueous, ethanol and methanol extracts of seven (7) seaweeds collected from the Philippines against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli using modified Kirby-Bauer method. <br><br>Inhibitory activity was observed against S. aureus from the methamol extracts of Sargassum polyycystum (18.4 mm). Sargassum oligocystum (12.50 mm), and Mastophora rosea (13.0 mm); and against E. coli from S. oligocystum (16.67 mm), S. polycystum (17.75 mm) and M.rosea (14.0 mm). Aqueous extracts of S. oligocystum (8.17 mm) and Caulerpa racemosa (17.33 mm) inhibited S. aureus but not E. coli.<br><br>The seaweed extracts demonstrated strong antimicrobial activity indicating its great potentials as source of pharmaceuticals.

IRRADIATION EXTERMINATION, PART II: A PORTABLE SYSTEM TO ELIMINATE WATER-BORNE MICROORGANISMS
Kelli Ann Lynch
Rocky Mountain High School, Fort Collins, CO

Does ultraviolet light eliminate B. subtilis? How does the elimination of E. coli compare to the elimination of B. subtilis when exposed to ultraviolet light? What exposure time is needed for Prototype #3? Can the system be operated by a reasonable sized solar panel? The experiments were all steps toward the development of a UV-C water purifier. <br><br> Initial testing of B. subtilis was done to learn how to make a solution of the same concentration as E. coli in order to compare the two. I compared B. subtilis to E. coli by testing similar concentrations of bacteria in water at depths of 3 inches in Prototype #2. After Prototype #3 was completed, I tested the necessary exposure time using E. coli. All the samples from each test were diluted so that the bacteria colonies could be counted after being incubated for 24 hours. <br><br> The results showed that gram positive bacteria, B. subtilis, is more resistant to UV-C than gram negative bacteria, E. coli, which caused me to change the design of the purifier. The results for testing Prototype #3 showed that there was a shadowing effect from the end of the bulb, that prevented all the E. coli from being eliminated. <br><br> Testing on Prototype #3 showed that if the shadowing effect can be eliminated, only two minutes of exposure is required to purify six liters of water. Prototype #3 was also tested with a 75-watt solar panel, which proved to run the bulb even without ideal panel orientation.

DAIRY FARMERS' DREAM II
Matthew Joseph Schaefbauer
Strasburg Public School, Strasburg, ND

There are many ways to help produce good quality milk, but I think that one procedure that is overlooked by some farmers that could be used effectively is the prestripping method. To prestrip a cow means to milk a milk bearing animal before the milk unit is applied.<br><br>This year I used the strip method to look for patterns in other quality components of milk such as bacteria, butterfat, solids non-fats, protein, and total solids. I believed that by using the stripping method farmers will improve the quality of their milk in more quality components than somatic cell. To prove this, I preformed aerobic bacteria tests as well as tests on protein, butter fat, solids non-fats, and total solids. All tests used the same 5 strip per sample method to get accurate results from 3 samples per cow. Each sample was taken from different times of milking. Sample 1 was taken from the first 5 strips after the cow's teats were clean, sample 2 was taken from the next 5, and sample 3 was 5 strips taken from after the milking unit came off the cow. The results showed stripping out cows effects bacteria counts when in a sterile environment and increase butterfat and total solids. Further, the amounts of protein, lactose, and solids non-fats tended to be presented in higher amounts in sample 2 than in samples 1 and 3. My Conclusion is that stripping out the cows increases the quality of our milk.

WHAT'S IN YOUR SHOWER? METAL VS. PLASTIC
Bea Ann Fischer
Ashley Public School, Ashley, ND

Do plastic or metal shower heads harbor more bacteria on their surface?<br><br>It's a common belief that metal surfaces harbor less bacteria than a plastic surface. So I hypothesize the plastic shower head will harbor more bacteria compared to the metal shower head.<br><br>Gather all of the supplies necessary to collect each bacterial sample. Take a sterile cotton applicator and swab the shower head for 30 seconds, place the swab into a sterile container. Repeat this same process seven additional times with the same shower head. Repeat with each shower head being tested. After you have swabbed all shower heads place the designated amount of sterile saline solution in each sterile container to create a broth. On the back, divide each dish into fourths and label (the shower head type and the amount of ccs). Use a SpeedStreak, dip it into the sterile container and swab the correct Petri dish section with the sample. Repeat for each cc level. Incubate the dishes for 24 hours at 35°C. Measure the number of colonies in ½ cm. If there is growth in more than one area take the average number of colonies per ½ cm, incubate for an additional 24 hours and observe again if there is growth. <br><br>The average growth of the metal shower head was 0.651 c/.5cm. compared to the growth of the plastic shower heads which was 2.278 c/.5cm, which was a difference of 1.6529 c/.5cm.<br><br>I conclude that my hypothesis was correct, metal shower heads harbor less bacteria than plastic shower heads. The plastic shower heads average growth was 1.6529 c/.5cn more than the metal shower heads. Therefore, I conclude that metal shower heads harbor less bacteria then plastic shower heads.

EVALUATING THE ROLE OF THE ESCRT COMPLEX IN HOST/CELL INTERACTION AND STRESS RESPONSE OF CANDIDA ALBICANS
David Kenneth Tang-Quan
Palos Verdes Peninsula High School, Rolling Hills Estates, CA

The fungus Candida albicans can enter the bloodstream in immunocompromised patients, infecting most organs of the body and resulting in disseminated candidiasis, which has a 50% mortality rate, even with treatment. The body utilizes a variety of defense mechanisms to prevent candidiasis. It is hypothesized that the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) is integral as a protein sorting and transport apparatus in C. albicans. For C. albicans to colonize patients and cause disease, it must be able to withstand these stressors and invade the host cells.<br><br>An endocytosis assay with ESCRT insertion mutants was completed to determine the role of the complex in epithelial cell invasion. Then, stress tests were conducted on the ESCRT mutants as well as on the insertion mutants from the HOG1 kinase pathway. Stressors included: protamine (antimicrobial peptides), SDS (cell membrane), H2O2 (oxidative), NaCl (HOG1 pathway), Congo Red and Calcofluor White (cell wall), and CuSO4 (ion).<br><br>The endocytosis assay revealed that the ESCRT-1 and ESCRT-3 complexes are important for C. albicans invasion, while ESCRT-0 and ESCRT-3 are important for C. albicans ability to withstand stress. The ESCRT-2 complex did not play a role in either cell invasion or stress response. Results did show a correlation between disruption of the ESCRT complex and a negative impact on C. albicans ability to withstand stress and invade the cell.<br><br>Overall, early or late gene inhibition in the ESCRT complex can severely impair C. albicans normal function. Most significantly, the HOG1 pathway and the ESCRT complex proved to play a key role in C. albicans general stress response. These discoveries open up the exciting possibility of significantly decreasing 50% mortality rate of disseminated candidiasis.i

A MULTIPRONGED INVESTIGATION OF THE AMPHIBIAN PATHOGEN BATRACHOCHYTRIUM DENDROBATIDIS
Madeline Berit Sides
Davis Senior High School, Davis, CA

Chytridiomycosis, an infectious disease of amphibians caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), has been called the worst infectious disease ever recorded among vertebrates. In this investigation, three different aspects of the fungus were examined: (1) How Bd infects amphibian host cells: A study of the Bd genome using sequence alignment tools showed that the fungus may use a wide variety of fibrinogen binding proteins similar to those found in other microbial pathogens to bind to surface of host cells. (2) How Bd responds to a range of temperatures: Bd was grown at a range of temperatures within and outside of its ideal range (16-37ºC). It was consistently found that Bd is still viable after exposure to high temperatures and protein production varies in response to these changes, which may indicate that heat is a less effective treatment for a chytrid infection than previously believed. And (3) The identification and development of a treatment for a Chytridiomycosis infection: natural antifungals were tested on Bd. As a result of these tests, it was determined that Garlic extracts (Allium sativum) consistently inhibited development of Bd zoospores and biofilm formation. This antifungal has potential for use as a Bd treatment, as it is nonhazardous and natural, although more research is needed before it could be used on infected amphibians. Overall, the results of this investigation suggest how this pathogen infects a host and responds to nonideal conditions and, most important, how it can be stopped.

THE EFFECTS OF EDTA/TETRACYCLINE ON WOLBACHIOA PIPIENTIS
Edwin Haro Chavez, Michael Sturdivant, 
E.E.Waddell High School, Charlotte, NC

Since its discovery, Wolbachia has garnered a spike in interest among the scientific community due to its gender bending characteristics and growing associations with human filarial diseases. These gram- endosymbionts reside within reproductive systems of invertebrates and filarial nematodes. As these associations are beneficial to Wolbachia their hosts experience negative effects like virgin births, skewed gender ratios & lymphatic inflammation within secondary hosts like humans. While strides have been made to cure these uncultivable organisms insitu with Tetracycline, attempts for total eradication are necessary to make strides in reduction of human inflammatory responses. To assess the synergistic effects of EDTA and Tetracycline on Wolbachia, 4 culturing vials were prepared with different treatment combinations( 4% Sucrose solution, .005% EDTA/4% Sucrose solution, 0.031mg/ml Tetracycline/4% Sucrose solution, and 4% Sucrose/.005% EDTA/0.031mg/ml Tetracycline solution). Each vial was populated with descendents of Wolbachia infected Nasonia wasps (5 females/ 2 males) and sarcophaga hosts. After mating, parent wasps were removed, & assessed for Wolbachia via DNA extraction, amplification of Wolbachia 16s rRNA gene and gel electrophoresis. Upon hatching, all offspring gender was assessed and used with similar treatments to set up succeeding generations. I hypothesized that the EDTA/Tetracycline treatment would yield a 10-20% increase of males by the final generation. Our data showed that EDTA/Sucrose not EDTA/Tetracycline eradicated & reversed the gender skewing effect Wolbachia. This treatment increased male presence by 28% & reinstated gender balance. In conclusion EDTA/Tetracycline is an ineffective agent to minimize the effects of Wolbachia in its hosts (1st & 2nd).

ASSAYS IN THE DETERMINATION OF HEMOLYTIC BACTERIAL COLONIES ON PAPER CURRENCY AND STERILIZATION TECHNIQUES USING SILVER NITRATE AS A MICROBIAL INHIBITOR
Paden Thomas Brunault, Miles Neslaw, 
Edgewater High School, Orlando, FL

Studies show that paper currency harbors a variety of bacterial species. Some bacterial species found on paper currency has the potential to be harmful to anyone but pose a particularly significant risk to people with weakened immune systems. Our team has set out to investigate and attempt to solve the problem of bacterial contamination of US paper currency. 1$ bills from community businesses, were tested for bacterial contamination in the following manner. Each dollar bill was swabbed with sterile cotton swabs dipped in soy broth (10 times on each side)and then each sheep's blood agar plate was inoculated with the same swab. Then each bill was treated with 3% silver nitrate, by submerging them fully for 10 seconds. The bills were then placed on an air vent within a sterile fume hood to dry. All procedures previously described were repeated on the four remaining contaminated bills. Forty-eight hours later data was collected by counting colonies of bacterial growth. <br><br> Results indicated that series 2003 bills compared to the other series 2006 bills, had more bacterial colonies. Additionally, results indicate that serious bacteria found on the older bills have the potential to make someone with a weakened immune system very ill. After treatment with Silver Nitrate, results indicate that the same bills had no bacterial colonies growing on the agar plates. One negative side-effect of the silver nitrate treatment was the discoloration of organic materials found in the bills to a darkish brown color. <br><br> Further research and experimentation is needed to investigate alternative methods for sterilizing money and assisting particularly vulnerable people in avoiding exposure to potentially harmful bacterial contamination.<br><br>

FRUIT PUNCH: AN EPIC KNOCK-OUT MATCH BETWEEN THE ANTIOXIDANT HEAVY-WEIGHT CHAMPIONS!
Sarah Michelle McIntyre, Ariel Isabelle Burnett, 
Stanton College Preparatory High School, Jacksonville, FL

The goal was to determine how antioxidant rich fruits would affect the growth of yeast. The experiment took advantage of yeast, a good precursor to other types of medical problems.<br><br>Four fruits of high antioxidant concentrations were selected for the experiment: pomegranates, apricots, blueberries, and mangoes. The researchers hypothesized that the pomegranate and blueberry groups would produce the fewest colonies because of their higher level of antioxidant concentration; the control would likely produce the most because the yeast would have nothing in the container to hinder its growth. <br><br>The Petri dishes were carefully prepared with agar and yeast. Each fruit was liquefied and allowed to incubate in an appropriately labeled Petri dish. A colony count was taken each after day of the incubation period using the naked eye and a pen. <br><br>A sizing chart was used to record the number of "small," "medium," and "large" colonies for each trial. The data was organized in tables including the total number of colonies per trial and the average number for each day. The average numbers were used to generate line graphs to show the effect of the fruit juice on the yeast over time. Each graph was analyzed for a best-fit line. The equations for the lines were found and the coefficients were used to compare the growth rates.<br><br>The researchers were correct. The control produced the greatest number of colonies followed by the mango, apricot, blueberry, and pomegranate.

THE ANTIMICROBIAL EFFECTS OF COMMERCIAL SPICES AND PLANT EXTRACTS ON ESCHERICHIA COLI O157:H7 IN GROUND BEEF
Sumedha Ravishankar, Sirtaj Bir Singh, 
Empire High School, Tucson, AZ

Escherichia coli O157:H7 is reported to be responsible for several foodborne illness outbreaks via contaminated ground beef. Reducing or eliminating the pathogen using safe and edible natural products is one approach that can be used to overcome this problem. It has been reported that spices have antimicrobial activity. However, to current knowledge, a systematic survey of the effects of relative antimicrobial activities of commonly used spices in controlling E. coli O157:H7 in ground beef has not been performed. The effects of the following commercially available spice powders and plant extracts against E. coli O157:H7 in ground beef were investigated: cardamom, paprika, garam masala, curry powder, Tikka Boti BBQ mix, Meat and Vegetable Spice Mix, olive extract, nutmeg, apple extract, grape extract, and ginger. The most effective antimicrobials were also tested in combination with heat. Antimicrobials (7% wt/wt) were mixed in ground beef which was then inoculated with E. coli O157:H7, mixed well and incubated at 4 degrees C for 5 days. Sampling and enumeration was done on days 0, 3, and 5. Beef samples were treated with olive extract and Tikka Boti mix, inoculated with E. coli O157:H7, flattened into patties, cooked to an internal temperature of 70 degrees C, and sampled for enumeration of survivors. Among the antimicrobials tested in ground beef, olive powder showed the highest reduction of E. coli (about 2 logs) followed by Tikka Boti BBQ Mix (slightly >1 log), and Meat and Vegetable mix (about 1 log), at 5 days of storage. The other spices induced only limited reductions. Compared to the control, heated samples with olive extract induced an additional 4 log reduction of E. coli O157:H7.

THE INVESTIGATION OF ANTIMICROBIAL PROPERTIES OF BARK FROM SELECTED LOCAL TREES
Allison Elizabeth Bye, Haeli Turner, 
North Toole County High School, Sunburst, MT

The purpose of this experiment was to determine if local trees (Daniels Cottonwood (Populus deltoides), Russian Olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia), and Colorado Blue Spruce (Picea pungens)) contain antimicrobial properties as tested on the bacteria species Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Bacillus cereus. We hypothesized the Cottonwood would show the greatest results because it contains salicin, which is used as an antiseptic and disinfectant. The Blue Spruce and Russian Olive would give the least results as they are used primarily for ornamental purposes. We also hypothesized that the extracts created with alcohol would show greater results than those created with distilled water. We created extracts from the different trees, one water-based and one alcohol-based for each species. To test our hypothesis, we soaked sterile disks in the extracts and then placed them in bacteria coated petri dishes. Using a ruler, we measured the diameter of the zones of inhibition around the disks at twelve hour increments for three days. After analysis, we rejected our hypothesis. Contrary to what we thought would occur, the alcohol extracts did not result in larger zones of inhibition than the water extracts. In addition, the Daniels Cottonwood extract did not inhibit bacterial growth more efficiently than the other extracts for every bacteria species. The only case where this significantly occurred was with the water extract on the Staphylococcus epidermidis experimental group, whereas the Blue Spruce water extract was statistically significant compared to the control in two bacteria species.

INVESTIGATING THE ANTIMICROBIAL PROPERTIES OF THE FLATULENCE AND HEMOLYMPH OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Robert Matthew Daitzman, Joanne Guidry, 
Loudoun Academy of Science, Sterling, VA

The goals of this investigation were to determine whether herbivorous fruit flies possess antimicrobial properties, and to identify and isolate antimicrobial peptide(s) other than cecropin, a known antimicrobial peptide. Antimicrobial properties of D. melanogaster hemolymph were confirmed using non-fractioned hemolymph. The hemolymph was subsequently size fractioned using column chromatography compared to a molecular weight standard and fractions were tested using zone of inhibition of gram- positive and negative bacteria. One-tailed T-tests were run comparing the experimental to negative control data. The <1.355 kDa (P = 0.001 for E. durans; P = 0.0211 for M. catarrhalis) and >16.7 kDa (P = 0.001 for E. durans; P = 0.0421 for M. catarrhalis) hemolymph fractions displayed the most statistically significant inhibition. Cecropin was found to be in the fraction that was not significantly different from the negative control for E. durans, however the 1.355 – 16.7 kDa fraction was found to be statistically significant (P = 0.002) against M. catarrhalis. Additionally, the antimicrobial properties of the D. melanogaster maggot flatulence were tested using an airtight system. The flatulence passed through a test tube containing M. catarrhalis bacteria in suspension. Light absorbance was measured between control and test groups, as both showed growth over the hour testing window. A statistically significant difference (P= 0.012) was demonstrated between the bacteria exposed to the flatulence and the control. Identification of individual peptides using protein gel electrophoresis and antimicrobial components in the flatulence using gas chromatography, as well as the extent of the antimicrobial properties, continues.

EVOLUTION OF THE H5N1 VIRUS: A STUDY OF HOW SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS AFFECT HOST AND REGIONAL VARIABILITY IN THE H5N1 VIRUS
Lauren Hannah Stephens, Boning Han, 
North Central High School, Indianapolis, IN

This project examines the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the Influenza type A subtype H5N1 virus, with emphasis on the HA and NA segments of RNA. SNPs were examined to find evidence of antigenic shift through a comparison of the relatedness of different segments of RNA. In addition, the polymorphisms between strains infecting different host species were analyzed. <br><br> Relatedness was defined as the patristic distance between the particular segments of two viruses and was determined by constructing a phylogenetic tree and then analyzing the tree using the Patristic program. The lack of correlation between phylogenetic trees constructed using HA and NA segments supported antigenic shift. <br><br> Four antigenic sites on the hemagglutinin protein monomer that are known to be important in antibody binding were then examined. A program, SNP Analyzer, was created to analyze the first appearance of HA segment polymorphisms in different hosts and regions. These results were analyzed using PHYRE and Jmol programs to find the structure of the hemagglutinin proteins. Similar sets of SNPs and changes in the four antigenic sites suggest that antigenic shift from changing migration patterns may have selected for mutations that allow a particular strain to infect new avian species.<br><br> These conclusions provide evidence for and a means to discern antigenic shift in the H5N1 virus. They also show the importance of monitoring the H5N1 virus for antigenic shift that could increase virulence or potential to infect new hosts.

EVOLUTION THROUGH RIBOSOMAL PROTEINS
Rasheen Gartrell Powell, Fiona Hennig, 
City Honors School, Buffalo, NY

The ribosome is a small, yet import part of a cell. Without the ribosome, an organism has no way to synthesize proteins, thus leading to the organism's death. The ribosome is coated with proteins that are located on the surface of the ribosome. These proteins are crucial to maintaining the ribosome's structure, and the process of translating mRNA into protein. If one amino acid changes in a single protein, the structural integrity of the protein becomes compromised leading to the destruction of the ribosome, in turn killing the organism. The need for the ribosomal proteins to stay the same, or similar to their ancestor, is critical for our method of analysis, as similar organisms have similar ribosomal sequences that contain similarities among themselves and differences among others, making it easier to differentiate different organisms from one another.

HOST GENE EXPRESSION PROFILING DURING TBSV INFECTION OF SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE
Tamas Nagy, Patrick Michael, 
Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Lexington, KY

The intricacies of virus-host interactions with plus-strand RNA viruses are not fully understood. It is thought that host proteins are subverted by the virus for its replication but the specific genes targeted and the extent they are influenced is mostly unknown. We expected that host genes, which are subverted for viral replication, would change at the early 24h time point while genes involved in cell defense, regulation, and repair would not show expression changes until later at 48h. We performed bioinformatical analysis via self-written JAVA programs on microarray data for the 48h time point and performed RT-PCRs and qPCRs at the 24h time point to analyze the effects of the viral infection at an earlier stage. Expression of ~40% of all host genes were significantly affected by viral infection as compared to a healthy Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell. Genes coding for nuclear proteins normally make up 16% of the genome but made up 41% of the ones significantly affected by viral infection. We have discovered that the expression level of SRL4 was greatly upregulated, SLR4 regulates nucleotide synthesis needed for robust virus replication. On the contrary, FDH1 expression was downregulated the most, suggesting that the virus slows down detoxification and thus increases the length of the cell cycle, which could be advantagous for viral replication by providing extra time to perform viral RNA synthesis. Overall, our discoveries allow for a better understanding of how a virus manipulates important metabolic processes in the host cell to facilitate its replication.

INHIBITION OF BETA-LACTAMASES: DETERMINING THE EFFICACY OF SAW PALMETTO, CHOLECALCIFEROL(VITAMIN D3), GLYCEROL MONOLAURATE, AND LACTOBACILLUS ACIDOPHILLUS AS BETA-LACTAMASE INHIBITORS
Ishan Harshad Mehta, Nithin Tumma, 
Port Huron Northern High School, Port Huron, MI

Beta-lactamase enzymes provide bacteria defense against many antibiotics. They cleave the beta-lactam ring, the backbone of beta-lactam antibiotics. Substances to inhibit beta-lactamases have been developed; our study assessed alternative substances as potential beta-lactamase inhibitors. <br><br> This study examined four substances (Cholecalciferol, Glycerol monolaurate, Saw palmetto, and Lactobacillus acidophillus), and their effect when used in conjunction with beta-lactam antibiotics, against Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) producing E. coli. Further testing determined if the substances facilitated the inhibition of the ESBL enzyme. In addition, the rate at which the bacteria developed resistance to the treatments was assessed. <br><br> Utilizing the Kirby-Bauer disk method, the effect that each antibiotic/inhibitor pair exhibited against the strains of bacteria was observed. To isolate the effects of the inhibitor and thus determine if it acted upon the beta-lactamase, the inhibition against a wild strain was compared to an ESBL strain. To determine if the substances enhanced the effect of the antibiotics, the degree of inhibition exhibited by the antibiotic/inhibitor pair was compared to that of the antibiotic alone. Each strain was exposed to the same treatment for five days to evaluate the rate at which resistance developed.<br><br> The results indicate that none of the substances inhibit the ESBL enzyme. When coupled with Amoxicillin, the substances appeared to significantly enhance the antibiotics' activity. However, when coupled with Cefuroxime and Cefotetan the substances did not seem to increase either antibiotics’ activity. Although most strains became less susceptible to the treatments, no significant patterns in the development of resistance were observed.

HOST RANGE MUTATIONS OF THE SINDBIS VIRUS
Myles Xavier Hodge, Mykellah Jarvis, 
Wake Early College of Health and Sciences, Raleigh, NC

The purpose of this Sindbis Virus research was to select model mutant viruses to use as templates to make vaccine strains that will combat the Dengue Fever Virus, and to produce other vaccines for mosquito vector viruses. Mutagenized Sindbis virus, a mosquito vector virus was used in this research. Experiments were conducted to determine which mutations inside the virus’s genes displayed a host range phenotype to make a vaccine strain. Sindbis Virus is a non-pathogenic virus, so it was not problematic to work with in the lab. For instance, if there was a virus spill and Sindbis was exposed to humans, no one would have to be concerned about being infected. Sindbis Virus was used as a model for other mosquito derived viruses because it has similar shape and composition, and because it contains a positive RNA strand.<br><br>The MTT assays will aid in finding mutations inside the virus genome. The significance of finding the mutation was needed for further screening for vaccines. There were several mutants that did complement and did kill a significant amount of cells, as others did not. This means that there could have been a mutation in the gene or genes of the mutants that made the virus grow effectively, or complemented.<br><br>MTT assays conducted with mosquito restricted mutants and all the temperature sensitive mutants gave the following results. Out of the 7 mosquito restricted mutants that were complemented with the TS mutants the mosquito restricted mutants were chosen to be screened were 4, 43, 27, 29, 31, and 33. Another MR mutant that was chosen out of the seven was number 28, because it did not complement at all. All of these mutants will be further screened to search for specific mutations.

GET PUMPED FOR SICKNESS
April Lauren Stoops, Jeni Turner, 
Glen Rose High School, Malvern, AR

Our science fair project is focused on the bacteria found in work out facilities, and whether or not easily accessible antibacterial wipes are helpful. The research involved using microscopes to observe the bacteria found on weight room equipment after they have been cultured in a lab, before and after the antibacterial wipes have been used in the designated areas. The test includes swabbing the designated areas, culturing the bacteria, wiping the areas down with antibacterial wipes, swabbing the designated areas, culturing the bacteria for a second time, and analyzing the data. Our research attempts are to unveil harmful bacteria, fungi, or viruses that are spread by simply going to the gym to excercise so that people are more aware and will take precautions, such as take antibacterial wipes with them, to avoid serious illnesses and diseases. After viewing the first set of data before wiping the areas with antibacterial wipes, we found a disturbing amount of bacteria. We then wiped the areas with the antibacterial wipes and swabbed the areas again, the bacteria cultured from the second set of data was remarkably less in number. After conducting theis experiment we found two important things. 1. Gyms are surprisingly more contaminated than we would assume. 2. The antibacterial wipes are not only easily accessable, but are protecting us from harmful bacteria causing illnesses and diseases.

THE EFFECT OF THE CHANGE IN PH ON THE RESPONSE OF A BACTERIAL SYSTEM: MEASURING THE INITAL AND DELAYED REACTION TO GASTRIC ACIS BY AS AN INDICATION OF ACID RESISTANCE BY AN ENTERIC BACTERIA: ENTEROBACTER AEROGENES
Grant Morgan Bodner, Andrew Kim, Rigel Kaufman
Battlefield High School, Haymarket, VA

Enterobacter aerogenes is a type of enteric flora, which are microogransims that reside within the human gastrointestinal tract. The human digestive sysetem prevents a hostile environment in which organisms and cell which inhabit this area must be highly specialized to survive. This experiment was designed to test the response of an enteric bacteria, when the pH undergoes a rapid change. This pH change is similar to the environment that these bacteria are exposed to everyday. which is the gastrointestinal tract. The three substances used to adjust to the pH were distilled water, hydrochloric acid, and acetic acid. Water was used as a control, as it usually has little affect on the change in pH. Hydrochloric acid is an acid commonly found in the human body and is the main component in stomach acid. Acetic acid is regularly ingested and is diluted both by manufacturers and the human body. The experiment was designed to test for two measures. The first process tested for the initial reaction of the bacteria to the addition of an acid. The second process tested the bacteria’s reaction to the addition of an acid over time. The results of the experiment showed a substanial increase in external pH and descrease in overall acidity. These findings supported our hypothesis that the bacterium would react to the stimuli, the change in pH, by externally neutralizing the substance.<br><br>

INVESTIGATING E. COLI COLONIZATION AND PREVENTION ON LEAFY PRODUCE
Wyatt Neal Palser
Otis High School, Otis, CO

E. coli outbreaks among the food industry are both costly to producers and dangerous to consumers. The purpose of this research was to examine the possbile prevention of E. coli colonization on spinach, lettuce, and cabbage leaves through the use of microbes safe for human consumption. It was hypothesized that T4 bacteriophage, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae would limit the growth of E. coli on all leaf types. A third hypothesis stated that T4 bacteriophage would be the most effective treatment at preventing E. coli colonization. The hypothesis were tested by applying the chosen microbes and, independently, their carrier broths to leaves inoculated with E. coli. The leaves were then incubated for 48 hours and finally vortexed in a buffer solution. The solution was plated on MacConkey's agar. An E. coli cfu count was taken after 48 hours. The first hypothesis was supported. T4 phage successfully limited E. coli bacterial growth on all leaf types, although there was only a statistically significant 10-fold cfu count differences on the lettuce leaves. The second hypothesis was partially supported because Saccaromyces cerevisiae restricted growth of E. coli only on lettuce, but Lactobacillus acidophilus did on all leaf types. Neither microbe showed a ten-fold signifcance level. The third hypothesis was partially supported. Analysis showed that the sugar carrier broth showed a ten-fold difference on the lettuce and the spinach leaves. The sugar broth was equally effective with the T4 bacteriophage on lettuce and spinach leaves.

Vanguard High School, Ocala, FL

The purpose of this experiment is to purify and crystallize Adeno-Associated Virus Serotype 7 in pH 5.5 and pH 6.0, for the purpose of determine the structure of the viral capsid of AAV-7. This study will help further the research and study on AAV-7, for future use in gene therapy. <br><br>The first step in this experiment was to acquire samples of replicated AAV-7. The second step was to purify the viral samples through cell lysis, centrifugation, and dialysis. For these processes, a sucrose cushion and a sucrose gradient were prepared. The third step of this experiment was to verify the purity of the AAV-7 samples. An optical density measurement was measured. Then, an SDS-PAGE was prepared. Next, a western-blot was conducted using the antibody B1. Then, an electron microscopy image was taken. Next, the AAV-7 samples were sent out for mass spectrometry. Finally, a dot blot was conducted. The last step of this experiment was crystallography. First, lysozyme was crystallized using both hanging and sitting drops. Then, AAV-7 samples were crystallized in pH 5.5 and pH 6.0, using hanging drops. <br><br>The purification of AAV-7 samples was successful. Crystals formed in the lysozyme tray. After twenty days, crystals formed in the AAV-7 crystal trays with a pH of 5.5 and 6.0. <br><br>This study was successful in the purification and crystallization of AAV-7. Unfortunately, the structure of the AAV-7 viral capsid has not been determined yet. The structural determination will be the next step in this study.

EFFECTS OF BENZOYL PEROXIDE AND SALICYLIC ACID ON E. COLI AND S. EPIDERMIS
Redeat Fisseha Abegaz
Burnsville Senior High School, Burnsville, MN

It is said that the active ingredient benzoyl peroxide in acne medication works best to prevent acne. The main goal of this experiment was to show whether benzoyl peroxide actually does work better than other active ingredients in other acne medications. The hypothesis was yes, benzoyl peroxide is more effective than other active ingredients. The measurement of zones of inhibition will be higher in the plates with the medications with benzoyl peroxide as the active ingredient while the plates with the other active ingredient (salicylic acid) will have smaller measurements. To test this hypothesis, three different acne medications were dipped in sterile paper disks and were put onto thirty agar plates with E. coli on them. The zone of inhibition was measured every two days in order to see which ingredient was more active. The results showed that the average measurements of the acne medications with benzoyl peroxide as the active ingredient were higher than the average measurements with Salicylic acid as the active ingredient. According to the results, benzoyl peroxide ended up being more effective. In addition, the data indicated that the zone was increasing over time. This supports that the disk diffusion test measures inhibition of growth, not cidal activity. A second phase for the experiment was conducted testing the bacteria S. epidermis, a gram positive bacteria, to determine whether the creams were bactericidal or bacteriostatic. A minimum biocidal concentration (MBC) setup was conducted to test this second phase.

Chytridiomycosis, a fungal infection of the skin, is caused by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), an amphibian pathogenic fungus. Nearly one-third (32%) of the world’s amphibian species are threatened by this lethal pathogen. In this experiment, one bacterium isolate from the surface of earthworms, Eisenia foetida, was used in an in vitro antifungal susceptibility test against Bd biofilm formation and zoospore attachment. <br><br>Supernatants were extracted from the isolate. Three replicates of filtered supernatants and its growth medium were used in a 12-well Microtiter Crystal Violet assay. Biofilm formation and zoospore attachment was compared to wells containing Bd and H-broth, a Bd growth medium (positive control), and wells containing H-broth only, (negative control). Visual readings of the wells with un-boiled samples indicated little or no biofilm formation. A novel approach using spectral analysis methods quantified unclassified digital images of biofilm formation. The inhibition of biofilm formation from the supernatant in all replicates was found to be statistically significant (p<0.0001). Spectrophotometer readings of Crystal Violet stains indicated an increase in zoospore well attachment (an average .1677 nm (supernatant) to .1563 nm (Bd control). Therefore, the supernatant had no statistical significance in inhibiting zoospore attachment. The bacterial supernatants inhibited Bd biofilm formation, but did not inhibit Bd zoospore attachment. Eisenia foetida bacteria may allow transport of zoospores, but the antifungal potential in controlling Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis biofilm formation describes possible interspecies interactions and may be significant in amphibian survival in natural habitats, zoo collections, commercial trade, and science laboratories.

THE ANTIMICROBIAL EFFECTS OF GINGER (ZINGIBER OFFICINALE) ON E. COLI HB101 (ESCHERICHIA COLI) IN GROUND BEEF
Nisha Pillai
Temple High School, Temple, TX

Spices and herbs have been used for hundreds of centuries by many cultures to enhance the flavor and aroma of foods. Previous Studies have shown that Cumin and Turmeric have shown antimicrobial properties that reduce the amount of E.coli. This experiment examined the effects of Ginger in powder form on E.coli HB101. Ginger itself has been shown to have the ability to increase the motility of the gastrointestinal tract and have analgesic, sedative, antipyretic and antibacterial properties. By using Ginger, this study was able to test the effects of a spice that is also considered a root in natural form. The procedure involved various concentrations of ginger from 0.5 g/ml to 2.5 g/ml when converted into percentages it was 5% to 30% of solution. The sample data consisted of 40 trials that were conducted using an incubator and agar plates. The data showed that as the ginger concentration increased the E.coli bacteria decreased. In comparison to the control group, the CFU amount was reduced from 500 CFU to 50 CFU. However the CFU margin between trials was small rather than a drastic decrease from trial to trial. Furthermore, Ginger had a significant effect on the E.coli compared to previous experiments. However, due to the minimal concentrations of Ginger, The full effect cannot be determined until a higher ginger concentration is tested which would present difficulties combining the ginger into the agar plates. Future research could include the testing other herbs and spices to determine the antimicrobial effects on various bacteria.

INVESTIGATING ACYL-HOMOSERINE LACTONE BASED QUORUM SENSING DEPENDENCY IN MUCOID AND NONMUCOID PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA BIOFILM DEVELOPMENT
Spencer Chang
West Linn High School, West Linn, OR

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is notorious for causing morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis and immunocompromised patients. This becomes problematic when P. aeruginosa develops into a biofilm, and especially dangerous when the bacterial community possesses the mucoid phenotype. There are currently no therapeutic treatments for mucoid P. aeruginosa biofilm infections, but targeting the quorum sensing circuit of these bacteria proves promising. However, the specific roles of the systems of communication (las and rhl) within the quorum sensing circuit of P. aeruginosa have yet to be investigated. In this project, it was presumed that the N-butyryl-L-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL) would play the greatest role in biofilm development because it controls rhamnolipid production within the rhl system and rhamnolipids have been shown to be important for the maintenance of biofilm architecture. Microtiter plate and air-liquid interface assays were used to assess quorum sensing responsiveness; the biofilm mass was measured quantitatively with spectrophotometry and qualitatively using bright-field microscopy. These analyses were conducted over a 5 day period while undergoing various treatments of one of the two principle acyl-homoserine lactones of P. aeruginosa. It was observed that the N-[3-oxododecanoyl]-L-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C12-HSL) exhibited the greatest effects over biofilm development, thus it could be concluded that the las system of communication plays the biggest role in both mucoid and nonmucoid biofilm development, refuting the original presumption respecting C4-HSL. These findings can be translated into developing novel therapeutic approaches for biofilm based infections in cystic fibrosis patients. Treatments targeting the las system specifically would prove to be optimal.

MEDIOCRE MYTHBUSTERS: REVISITED
Ethan Daniel Falleur
Alma High School, Alma, AR

The purpose of this project is to compare the bacterial content of human mouths to that of canines. In sterile, nutrient agar Petri dishes, 30 samples each, of pet canines, shelter canines, and humans, male and female, saliva were cultured for bacteria. After 48 hours in an incubator at 37 degrees Centigrade (approximate human and canine body temperature), the resultant bacterial colonies were counted. The results for the human male plates show an average of 47.42 bacterial colonies, while human females averaged 27.50 colonies. Pet male canines averaged 179.56 colonies, while pet female canines had 194.30 colonies. Shelter male canines averaged 256.90 colonies, while the shelter canine females had 260.04 colonies. The average hauman culture was 37.46 colonies per plate, while the the average canine culture was 222.7 colonies per plate. Thus, within the sample collected for this research, the average canine mouth has nearly six times the bacteria count than the average human mouth. Shelter canines had more bacteria colonies than pet canines.

WEAVING HEALTH: THE WEAVING OF ANTIMICROBIAL SUBSTANCES FROM THE OOTHECA OF THE BANANA SPIDER II
Leonardo de Oliveira Bodo
Dante Alighieri, Sao Paulo, BRASIL

Increasingly the conventional antibiotics are losing their ability to heal. Also, infectious diseases are one of the most important problems to human health. Researches have demonstrated that microorganisms like bacteria or yeasts are acquiring resistance against conventional antibiotics too widely. It is happening mainly by the slow activity and also the wrong way using of these by humans. The conclusion of these facts is that in the future these antibiotics may be not effective and the number of deaths by infectious diseases will grow. Therefore, this research is to find new antibiotics that reduce in almost 100% the chances of the microorganisms acquire resistance. By this deal I created the hypothesis that it would be possible to find these antibiotic substances in the ootheca of the spider Phoneutria nigriventer since  against eight yeasts. I characterized these two molecules like peptides and also I found their sequencing. It all mean that these can be natural, cheap, fast and functional antibiotics that can save human lives since I also proved that these molecules have no hemolytic activity.M and 0,72it is used to protect the eggs not just physically but also from infections. From this initial idea I could start the laboratorial process to identify and characterize antimicrobial substances doing purifications of the sample using HPLC. Then, I did the mass characterization of the fractions using MALDI-ToF and also the sequencing by Q-ToF. I found eight fractions with activity by doing antimicrobial assays agains15 microorganisms, including bacteria and yeasts. Beyond that I found the mass of two molecules from the purified peaks, with respectively 1338Da and 1194Da. These two fractions showed antimicrobial activity with respectively 0,5

IDENTIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF BACTERIAL ENDOPHYTES AS NOVEL BIO-INOCULANTS FOR JATROPHA
Yuan Jin Tan
Raffles Institution, Singapore, SINGAPORE

Jatropha curcas is a plant which can be used to produce biodiesel, and is thus a very important crop. Improving Jatropha growth, and subsequently biodiesel production has become a great industrial interest in view of depleting fossil fuel reserves. This study investigates novel strains of endophytic bacteria which can potentially be developed into bio-inoculants to benefit Jatropha growth. We studied over 20 strains, eventually confirming two as nitrogen-fixers and further characterized them using an array of phenotypic and biochemical tests. The two selected strains were found to be of the Pleomorphomonas and the Entereobacter genera. Both strains contain storage granules and were gram negative, non-pigmented rods. The strains also exhibited resistance to carbenicillin and ampicillin but were susceptible to kanamycin and tetracycline. However, the two bacteria were found to have major differences in nitrogen-fixing ability and characteristics. Even though both strains were strong nitrogen-fixers, the Enterobacter strain was five times stronger than the Pleomorphomonas strain. Furthermore, the Enterobacter strain was observed to have greater tolerance for pH variation and NaCl concentration. It was also confirmed as highly motile, with competent endophytic properties. While both strains were relatively fast growing, the Enterobacter strain was observed to be able to grow on a much larger range of media types. As such, the Enterobacter strain is recommended as a very suitable candidate for further development as a bio-inoculant.

A GFP-LABELED STREPTOCOCCUS SUIS: A TOOL TO TRACK THE BACTERIA FOR PATHOGENESIS STUDY
Xu Cheng
High School Affiliated to Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CHINA

Streptococcus suis, especially its serotype 2 (SS2), is a zoonotic pathogen that causes meningitis, septicemia and even severe streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS). However its pathogenesis, esp. the SS2-caused STSS is not yet understood. Recent work has reported that SS2 can get into the cells though it is not a strict intracellular bacterium. Studies of its intracellular movement might give some insights into its toxic shock characters. In this study an STSS-causing SS2 was chosen and a new SS2 strain with GFP (green fluorescent protein) (discovery of GFG used for cell biology study was awarded Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2008) incorporated as a plasmid form was developed and its attachment to HeLa cells was studied. A second strain with a plasmid harboring a more intensive fluorescence protein, Azami-green (AG), was also devloped. Both strains have been confirmed stable with passages and the fluorescence was clearly seen. The labelled SS2 was also used for the study of phagocytosis. Taken together, this could be a useful tool to track the movement of the SS2 inside the host and the mechanism for entry into the mammalian cells. Further detailed studies using this strain will help elucidate the mechanism of the STSS pathogenesis, which might give clue on the prevention and control of the SS2 infection. The technique developed here has also implications for the study of other bacteria, tacking for the host infection or enveironment transmission.

PRODUCTION OF VALUABLE SIALIC ACID FROM TRASHED CHALAZA OF HEN'S EGG WITH SIALIDASE PRODUCED BY NEWLY ISOLATED STRAIN LXS6
Yulin An
Dalian Yuming High School, Dalian, Liaoning, CHINA

Humans are genetically unable to produce sialic acid although it plays an important role in the biomedical function. Whereas sialic acid is widely distributed in hen’s egg including yolk, albumen, and chalaza. In order to prepare the sialic acid from indissoluble chalaza of hen’s egg, one strain LXS6 capable of dissociating sialic acid from chalaza was isolated from soil sample. The sialidase activity for the production of sialic acid was detected in the culture supernatant. It was found that all the tested carbon sources promoted the sialidase production, and the highest specific activities were obtained when mannitol was used as carbon source or no carbon source was supplied, suggesting that the carbon source is not necessary for sialidase production if tryptone is supplemented in the medium. However sialidase production needs the addition of nitrogen sources by strain LXS6 grown in the mineral solution with chalaza as carbon source. Among the nitrogen sources examined, casein given the best sialidase production, but inorganic nitrogen sources given very poor results. The optimum temperature and the optimum pH for sialidase production were at 30℃ and pH 6.6 respectively. The optimum temperature for crude sialidase activity was 45℃ and the highest activity was obtained in phosphate-citrate buffer with a pH 6.6. The results suggest a potential application of sialidase for sialic acid production process with trashed chalaza.

EVALUATING THE ANTIMICROBIAL PROPERTIES OF ESSENTIAL OILS ON SELECTED BACTERIA
Jeffrey Gage Holleman
Cascia Hall Preparatory School, Tulsa, OK

Antibiotic resistance has been an increasing problem over the past centuries. The essential oils tested were rosemary, thyme, grape seed extract, green tea, lemon rind, and lemon. The purpose of this study was to determine if there is a different way to inhibit the growth of bacteria. It is hypothesized that if the essential oils of certain plants are applied to bacteria, they will inhibit the growth of the bacteria as measured by the zone of inhibition around essential oil infused discs. To extract the essential oils of the chosen plants, the plants were placed in 10 mL of a 10% ethyl alcohol extracting medium. Sterile discs were placed in the essential oil extracts to concentrate the essential oils. 24 hour cultures E. coli and B subtiliis and applied to Mueller-Hinton agar to create a lawn growth. Essential oil infused discs were placed on the agar and allowed to incubate for 24 hours. After 24 hours the zones of inhibitions were then measured and averaged. The data collected suggests that green tea effects the bacteria growth the most. ANOVA suggested the zone of inhibition data to be significant (p=0.0001) for each essential oil tested. Further statistics, Student T-test comparing the essential oils to the control (alcohol) suggested significant differences for green tea, lemon rind and rosemary for E. coli and for B subtilis (p=0.0001).

ICE CREAM PRODUCTION USING LACTIC ACID BACTERIA WHICH PRODUCE EXOPOLYSACCARIDE AND WITHOUT USING SALEP (I.E. STABILIZER)
Tugce Horozoglu
Private Yelkenoglu Science High School, Kayseri, TURKEY

This project addresses production of ice cream, a product widely consumed, using lactic acid bacteria without using salep. It aims to reduce cost of ice cream production, facilitate digestion of lactose by producing fermented ice cream, help, through ice cream consumption, intake of lactic acid bacteria which are very important for human health and preserve orchids in nature which face threat of extinction as they are used for salep production.<br><br>With these objectives in mind, ice cream was produced using lactic acid bacteria which produce exopolysaccaride and also with salep and the panelists conducted a sensory analysis of the results. As a result, the overall satisfaction of ice cream produced with lactic acid bacteria which produce exopolysaccaride (exopolysaccaride serves as bacterial stabilizer) scored higher than the ice cream produced using salep.

THE EFFECT OF HOLY BASIL ON THE GROWTH OF RESPIRATORY VIRUSES (ADENOVIRUS AND RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS)
Sangamithra Vardhan
West Shore Junior/Senior High School, Melbourne, FL

The purpose of this project is to find out if Holy Basil is effective in inhibiting the growth of Adenovirus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). The hypothesis is that Holy Basil will be effective against both the viruses. Holy Basil infusion was prepared for the virus inoculation. Five shell vials of MRC-5 cell lines were inoculated with Adenovirus (control group) and ten shell vials were inoculated with Adenovirus and Holy Basil (experimental group). The same was done with Respiratory Syncytial Virus. Also, one shell vial of MRC-5 cell lines, with no virus or Holy Basil, was incubated as negative control. After incubation period, cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed for all shell vials. The CPE of cells in Holy Basil experimental groups was reduced compared to the control groups for both viruses. The cell suspensions were then stained with Trypan Blue. The live and dead cells were counted under the microscope and recorded. <br><br>The average number of live cells per milliliter was 10,630,000 in RSV Holy Basil group and 3,500,000 in RSV Control group.<br><br>The t test p-value of these data sets was 1.22542E-05(0.000012), reflecting that data sets were significantly different indicating that Holy Basil did inhibit the growth of RSV. <br><br>The average number of live cells per milliliter was 5,460,000 in Adenovirus Holy Basil group and 4,440,000 in Adenovirus Control group.<br><br>The p-value of these data sets was 0.26, reflecting that the data sets were not significantly different indicating that Holy Basil did not inhibit the growth of Adenovirus significantly.

ISOLATION OF POLYETHYLENE AND POLYSTYRENE DEGRADING BACTERIA
Jason Yuan
Central High School, St. Joseph, MO

The purpose of this investigation is to test for the presence of bacteria capable of degrading polyethylene or polystyrene. These bacteria, if they exist, will be isolated and then characterized according to their phenotypic characteristics.<br><br>Soil samples from a landfill were obtained and mixed with growth medium and a small amount of either polyethylene or polystyrene. These samples were incubated for 1½ weeks at 37˚C. They were then re-inoculated into fresh growth medium and incubated for another 1½ weeks at 37˚C and called the Final Enrichment Culture. They were also re-inoculated into distilled water with plastic and labeled the Distilled Culture. The samples were plated out onto LB agar. They were Gram-stained and then viewed under the microscope. They were characterized by cell shape, cell arrangement, and whether or not they were Gram-positive or Gram-negative. Four different species of bacteria were isolated from the Final Enrichment Culture and labeled A, B, C, and D. Species A, B, and C were isolated from the flasks containing polyethylene. Species D was isolated from a flask containing polystyrene. Species F and G were from the Distilled Culture, F from a polyethylene flask, and G from a polyethylene flask. These have the potential to degrade polyethylene or polystyrene, respectively.

ISOLATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF BOVINE RESPERATORY CORONA VIRUS FROM A DAIRY HERD
Elijah Lloyd Welu
Marshall High School, Marshall, MN

The purpose of my experiment was to isolate and identify bovine respiratory corona virus. Respiratory corona virus is characterized by severe watery diarrhea, decreased milk production, listlessness, depression, anorexia, weight loss, coughs, and nasolacrimal discharge. Corona virus is a new growing problem in the United States and it has few vaccines, most of which are not effective. <br><br> First in my project was that I swabbed five cows in a dairy herd, I then went to a research lab and I created an HRT cell monolayer to infect with the swabs. I took the swabs to the lab and I isolated corona virus from them and I applied it to the monolayer. I then did a fluorescent test on the virus to see if there was virus on the cultures. <br><br> I found that there were two of the swabs that came back positive for the virus. I found that the two cows that had the virus were different from the cows that did not have the virus. The cows with the virus were both around three years old, both had three calves, and both were cows. The other three that did not have the virus were five years and two years old, they all three had 1 calf, and they all three were heifers. <br><br> I concluded that I could isolate and identify the virus. My next step is to create an immunogenic to inject chickens with. After that I will try to make a product to combat bovine respiratory corona virus.

DOUBLE DIPPING: CHIPS AND DIPS
Emily Theresa Wood
Minnesota New Country School, Henderson, MN

Imagine you are at a friend's house having a good time. There is a container of dip sitting out, just calling your name. Just as you are about to get up to grab some, you notice someone has just dipped their chip into it. A chip that they had already bitten into! This act is known as "double-dipping."<br><br>The purpose of this project was to find out if double-dipping really did spread bacteria, and how much. There have only been a few previous studies on the effects of double-dipping, and I wanted to find out for myself.<br><br>For my experiments I used chips and salsa, French fries and ketchup, and carrots and veggie dip. Subjects were required to sign a permission form before I had them help me with my experiments. I then took samples of the dips to grow in petri dishes. I made my own incubator, in which I let the petri dishes sit in for about 70 hours. After incubation, I examined and took data from the petri dishes to find a conclusion.<br><br>My results showed that double-dipping does, in fact, spread bacteria from a person's mouth into the dip. This was shown by the rise of bacteria levels from the control tests of just the dip compared to the double-dipping results.<br><br>During this project I was able to learn about growing bacteria in petri dishes. I had to make my own incubator, prepare agar, pour the dishes, and grow the bacteria. I gained a better understanding of microbiology in the process.

TO EXIST, IT MUST RESIST
Clark Mitchell Cranfill
Sargent High School, Monte Vista, CO

As a society, we take antibiotics too often. The antibiotic azithromycin, a derivative of erythromycim, is prescribed in the form of Zithromax. In an age where antibiotics are the magical cure, there is the opportunity for resistance development. Enterobacter aerogenes, a gram-negative pathogen, is excellent at becoming resistant to drugs. I hypothesized that E. aerogenes would develop measurable resistance when exposed to azithromycin over five generations. <br><br> First, I determined that the minimum inhibitory concentrate (MIC) of the azithromycin to the Enterobacter aerogenes was 150 µg/mL. I began to grow generation one. By growing the antibiotic in tube cultures, then later plating them out; I was able to distinguish between growth and non-growth. Each generation, I exposed the Enterobacter aerogenes to an increased amount of antibiotic, possibly to raise the maximum concentration of antibiotic that would allow growth. <br><br> At the end of the fifth generation, the highest concentration of the azithromycin that allowed growth was 180µg/mL. This showed that it took more antibiotic to kill the organism. Over five generations, the Enterobacter aerogenes made a measurable resistance to the azithromycin. In a disc diffusion test, the bacteria grew to the rim of an antibiotic disc from generation five. This was different than the large zone of inhibition of the original organism. This project has substantial applications. If you were infected with E. aerogenes, received azithromycin, and received an inadequate dose, the bacteria could easily become resistant to azithromycin. My hypothesis was correct.

STATE TRANSITION MECHANISM PROTECTS PHOTOSYNTHETIC LIGHT REACTION IN THERMOPHILIC CYANOBACTERIA
Kuang-Ming Shang
Taipei Municipal Jianguo High School, Taipei City, CHINESE TAIPEI

With much attention being placed on global warming, how thermophilic hot spring cyanobacteria live and perform photosynthesis at high temperatures becomes an interesting and pertinent issue. In this study the photosynthetic characteristics of the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechoccus sp.CL-1 and the mesophilic cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.PCC6803 were compared. Chlorophyll a fluorescence induction analysis and 77K emission spectra revealed that phycobilisomes, the light harvesting antenna of photosystem II in cyanobacteria, were highly mobile and could be readily be coupled and uncoupled with photosystem II by state transition in Thermosynechoccus sp.CL-1, but not in Synechocystis sp.PCC6803. Moreover, the effects of state transition on Thermosynechoccus sp.CL-1 was stronger as temperature increased. To study the physiological impact of state transition on Thermosynechoccus sp.CL-1 at high temperatures, a high concentration of buffer was used to inhibit the state transition of Thermosynechoccus sp.CL-1. When state transition was impaired, photoinhibition was occurred in Thermosynechoccus sp.CL-1, suggesting that state transition protected the photosynthetic apparatus at high temperatures by reducing the energy delivered from the phycobilisomes to photosystem II. Taken together, these results suggest that state transition in thermophilic cyanobacteria may play an important role in protecting thermophilic cyanobacteria from photoinhibition at high temperatures.

WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT CONCENTRATIONS OF TART CHERRY JUICE ON THE GROWTH OF ESCHERICHIA COLI?
Rebecca Hope Caughman
Batesburg-Leesville High School, Batesburg-Leesville, SC

The purpose of this experiment was to see if tart cherry juice concentrate diminishes or increases the growth of Escherichia coli. The results of this experiment helped determine if tart cherry juice concentrate could help prevent or cure an E. coli infection. The hypothesis stated that the higher the concentration of tart cherry juice, the greater growth of the E. coli is inhibited. <br><br> In testing the hypothesis, there were three trials of four Petri dishes. Each Petri dish contained four circular pieces of paper soaked in the same concentration of tart cherry juice. Four concentrations of cherry juice were used. The control group contained only boiled water. The other groups contained a 2:2, 3:1, and 4:0 tart cherry juice to boiled water mixture. Once the concentrations were mixed, the circles sat for 7 hours 17 minutes in the corresponding concentrations. Four circles of the same concentration were then placed on each dish and were left in the incubator for 22 hours 47 minutes.<br><br> Through conducting this experiment, it was found that tart cherry juice concentrate could help prevent an E. coli infection, but is not a guaranteed prevention. In trial one, the results showed that boiled water was a better prevention for the growth of E. coli. In trial two, the results showed that boiled water and pure tart cherry juice were equally the most effective. In the fourth trial, the results showed that pure tart cherry juice was the most effective in diminishing the growth of E. coli.

FIGHTING BAC!!, PHASE IV: THE ISOLATION OF ANTI-PROLIFERATIVE PHYTOCHEMICALS FROM CRANBERRIES TO ERADICATE ESCHERICHIA COLI
Jordan Mark Grainger
Rio Rancho High School, Rio Rancho, NM

The purpose of this study was to successfully isolate and identify the phytochemical from cranberries that would eradicate Escherichia coli. The hypothesis proposed was if cranberry juice is chromatographed into fractions and exposed to E. coli cultures, then the tannin, proanthocyanidin, would significantly increase the bacteria’s sensitivity, because of its ability to inhibit proliferation. <br><br> The methodology used for this experiment consisted of Gel Chromatography, in which fractions of an original sample are separated based on molecular weight; Plate Lawning, where fractions of interest obtained from the Gel Chromatography are exposed to cultures of E. coli to test for viability; A Ferric Reduction/Antioxidant Power (FRAP) Assay to determine if antioxidants are responsible for cranberry’s inhibitory action; A Thermal Death Point (TDP) test to determine the optimal temperature of inhibition of bacterial growth, and a Decimal Reduction Time Test to calculate the D-value of cranberry juice.<br><br> The results display that an antioxidant with a molecular weight of 1,800Da is responsible for cranberry’s inhibitory and anti-proliferative properties. These characteristics match those of the proanthocyanidin molecule. It was also concluded there is an inverse relationship between the temperature of the cranberry juice and the number of colonies present, with optimal inhibition at 37°C or body temperature. After 10 minutes of exposure at 37°C, approximately 90% of the bacteria were inhibited, exhibiting complete inhibitory action within 45 minutes.<br><br> With further research, I intend to compare cranberry’s antioxidants in-vitro to in-vivo and observe the overall effects of proanthocyanidins.

CAN A BACTERIAL PIGMENT KILL FLESH-EATING BACTERIA? A STUDY ON THE CYTOTOXIC NATURE OF PVP (PURE VIOLET PIGMENT) ON MULTIDRUG RESISTANT (MDR) AND METHICILLIN RESISTANT (MRSA) STRAINS OF STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS, YEAR III CONTINUATION STUDY
Rakesh Ram Goli
The Altamont School, Birmingham, AL

The purpose of this project is to determine the effect of PVP (Pure Violet Pigment) extracted from Janthinobacterium ANT 5-2 on MDR/MRSA Staphylococcus aureus. To do this, PVP was first extracted and purified from a liquid culture of the bacteria. The cytotoxic effect of PVP was then determined using a live vs. dead stain, resazurin assay, spectrophotometric analyses, and plate count analyses.<br><br> Following the live vs. dead stain treatment, PVP addition changed the color of the majority of cells from green to red, indicating cell death. The resazurin assay measured the MIC90 for the 10.005 (MDR/MRSA), 10.006 (Control), and 10.007 (MDR/MRSA) strains at 3.13, 6.25, and 1.57 µg/mL, respectively. In the spectrophotometric analysis, PVP at an MIC90 concentration (3.13 µg/mL) inhibited the growth of all 3 strains for 8 hours. PVP re-addition following degradation at 37ºC inhibited cell growth for an additional 7 hours on average. Finally, PVP addition to cell cultures in the plate count assay dropped the viable cell count two folds.<br><br> All four studies point to the cytotoxic effect of PVP on MDR/MRSA Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, because of PVP degradation at 37ºC, the results point to a dose and time dependent response of the antimicrobial effect of PVP.<br><br> In the face of growing antimicrobial resistance to traditional antibiotics, these studies are duly warranted. If these preliminary experiments can be validated in the future through in vivo studies, it would provide a natural antimicrobial agent that could be important in improving the prognosis of patients with Staph infections.

RED GLOBE GRAPE ANTHOCYANIN EXTRACTION, ISOLATION, AND CHARACTERIZATION AND THEIR ANTIBACTERIAL EFFECTS AGAINST CAUSATIVE AGENTS OF HOOF ROT
Sarah Marie Cox
Zane Trace High School, Chillicothe, OH

Cloven-hooved animals, specifically Capra hircus, hoof rot is a common health problem and an economic liability. Fusobacterium necrophorum, Dichelobacter nodosus, and Arcanobacterium pyogenes are common bacterial causes of hoof rot. This experiment sought to treat hoof rot utilizing environmentally safe grape anthocyanins. Anthocyanins, pigments found in grapes, are polyphenols proven to have antibacterial effects. This experiment sought to find a way to extract, isolate, and characterize anthocyanins in a less expensive, less time-consuming way than commercial anthocyanin production. The project’s purpose was to identify the primary anthocyanins found in Vitis vinifera (Red Globe cultivar), to determine if these anthocyanins’ percent purity, and to determine if these anthocyanins have antimicrobial properties against two common hoof rot bacteria. The hypotheses included: 1) the grape extract would contain at least 15 different anthocyanins; 2) the grape anthocyanins would have antibacterial effects on F. necrophorum, D. nodosus and A. pyogenes; 3) The anthocyanin individual peak isolates will have a purity of 85% or better. There were 9 individual anthocyanins identified in the grape extract. V. vinifera anthocyanins were extracted and identified primarily as peonidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-glucoside using HPLC gas chromatography. Peak 2 and peak 4 isolates, as well as, total anthocyanins, and a control of 0.01% Hydrochloric acidified water were concentrated onto disks and placed on isolated cultures of F. necrophorum, D. nodosus and A. pyogenes to determine the antimicrobial effect. No significant antibacterial effect was found. Providing a safer, environment-friendly alternative to the traditional treatments of hoof rot is important economically and ecologically.

EVALUATING THE ROLE OF THE HOG1 AND ESCRT PATHWAYS IN HOST/CELL INTERACTION AND STRESS RESPONSE OF CANDIDA ALBICANS
David Kenneth Tang-Quan
Palos Verdes Peninsula High School, Rolling Hills Estates, CA

The fungus Candida albicans can enter the bloodstream in immunocompromised patients, infecting most organs of the body and resulting in disseminated candidiasis, which has a 50% mortality rate. Since current antifungal treatments are non-specific and ineffective - often hurting the host as much as they help - a more specific and targeted approach toward treating C. albicans infections can provide a much needed medical breakthrough. This project sought specific genes that could be targeted to inhibit C. albicans normal function so that fungal cells can be killed without harming human cells.<br><br> A forward genetic screen of over 150 kinase insertion mutants found that the HOG1 (High Osmolarity Glycerol) pathway and ESCRT (Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport) pathway were both necessary for stress response. Further research was conducted on the ESCRT pathway in an endocytosis assay as well as a cell damage assay in order to determine its role in host/cell interaction.<br><br> Both the HOG1 and ESCRT pathways were implicated in C. albicans normal stress response to the body’s defense mechanisms. Furthermore, early or late gene inhibition in the ESCRT pathway severely impaired C. albicans proper interaction with host epithelial cells. Specific subcomplexes within the ESCRT pathway proved to be more important than others.<br><br> Overall, either of these two biochemical pathways can be inhibited in C. albicans in order to disrupt its normal function and cause it to die. Since these genes are non-homologous in human cells, they provide specific gene targets for future medications. These discoveries will help in significantly decreasing the high mortality rate of disseminated candidiasis as well as other fungal diseases.

EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF FOXO3A, A TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR ASSOCIATED WITH MUSCLE ATROPHY IN RUNT PIGLETS
Sachin Raviteja Rudraraju
Olentangy Liberty High School, Powell, OH

Foxo3a is a major transcription-factor implicated in muscle atrophy. pFoxo3a is the inactive-form of Foxo3a. The purpose was to identify differences between the expression of Foxo3a in SGA, or runt piglets versus normal piglets using immunohistochemistry. It was hypothesized that Foxo3a was expressed more in runt piglets than normal piglets. Tissue samples from three pairs of piglets were used. Each pair contained one runt and one normal piglet from the same litter. A Hematoxylin stain was used for the background. Foxo3a and pFoxo3a primary antibodies anneal to the transcription factor. A universal secondary antibody anneals to the primary antibody and is stained brown by the DAB wash. In the resulting slides, bundles of muscle-fibers were clearly visible. In each bundle, one larger type-2 fiber was surrounded by several smaller type-1 fibers. Analysis of the color values of the images lead to the finding that pFoxo3a was stained to a greater degree in normal piglets versus runt piglets. It was also found that the differences in staining of type-2 fibers was greater than those of type-1 fibers. This leads to the conclusion that type-2 in runt-piglets are being degenerated to a higher extent than the same fibers in normal piglets. Type-2 fibers are more mebolically active than type-1 fibers. A loss type-2 fibers correlates to higher risk for metabolic-health-disorders, including obesity, and diabetes, in adult life. Although immunohistochemistry can help identify such patterns as above, it is difficult to measure the actual levels of the transcription-factors in each sample of tissue.

METHICILLIN-RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS (MRSA) IN A HIGH SCHOOL
Toni Susan Emma Viola
New Milford High School, New Milford, CT

In 2007 Governor Jodi Rell sent an advisory to Connecticut schools offering assistance and advice to prevent the spread of the potentially dangerous bacteria, Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). This advisory was administered resultant of reported outbreaks in school facilities which led to student and athlete infection. The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus, specifically MRSA, in a suburban Connecticut high school. Contributing factors to MRSA infection can potentially include a combination of improper hygiene/sanitation, and exposure. For these reasons, sample selection of cultures included commonly touched items, shared gym equipment, and objects that present difficult and/or infrequent cleaning procedures. A total of thirty samples were collected. The hypothesis of the experiment was that the samples would demonstrate selective positive results for MRSA, the extent of prevalence was however unknown. The samples were incubated on blood agar plates to investigate growth. Furthermore, a series of tests were necessary to identify the bacteria that did grow. These tests included a Gram stain, catalase test, coagulase test, and an oxacillin sensitivity test. The confirmation of MRSA was proven by its ability to grow in the presence of oxacillin as determined by measuring the zone of inhibition. The data concluded: out of thirty cultures, six were found to be Staphylococcus aureus, two of which tested positive for MRSA. This experiment demonstrates the presence of MRSA in a high school setting in areas that could potentially expose all students. Further investigations are suggested.

ANALYSIS OF THE BACTERIAL HEAT SHOCK RESPONSE TO PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY-MEDIATED OXIDATIVE STRESS
Tyler Gordon St. Denis
John Jay High School, Cross River, NY

The formidable emergence of widespread antibiotic resistance has recently prompted researchers to look for new ways to inactivate bacterial pathogens. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (PDT), a photoantibacterial approach, has recently emerged as an effective modality for the selective destruction of bacteria and other pathogenic organisms. Accordingly, PDT has been forwarded into the clinical setting; however, to date, no research has explored whether bacteria are capable of acquiring tolerance to the oxidative stresses of PDT. This project pragmatically investigated whether PDT induced protective responses such as heat shock proteins (HSPs) in bacteria and if bacteria could become tolerant to the effects of PDT via these responses. Using the photosensitizer Toluidine Blue O (TBO) at sublethal conditions, a seven-fold increase in bacterial HSP GroEL and a three-fold increase in HSP DnaK were observed in Escherichia coli post 30 min of PDT. Pretreatment with 50º C heat for 30 min reduced PDT killing in both E. coli and Enterococcus faecalis, with the most pronounced inhibition occurring at 50 µM TBO with 5 J cm-2 635 nm light, where E. coli viability was enhanced 99% (2 log10) and Enterococcus faecalis viability was enhanced 99.98% (4 log10). Finally, inhibition of the highly conserved HSP DnaK using a small molecule benzylidene lactam HSP inhibitor potentiated the effects of PDT at TBO concentrations of 2.5 µM in E. faecalis. This effect was not observed in E. coli presumably because the inhibitor could not gain access due to the Gram-negative permeability barrier. Induction of HSPs may be a mechanism whereby bacteria could become resistant to PDT and warrants the need for further study in the application of dual PDT-HSP inhibition therapies.

A SOLUTION TO THE WORLDWIDE MALARIA EPIDEMIC: T. GONDII MITOCHONDRIA-ASSOCIATED PROTEINS AS POTENTIAL DRUG TARGETS OF TOMORROW
Matthew Karmen McIntyre
Yorktown High School, Yorktown Heights, NY

Plasmodium falciparum, the apicomplexan parasite responsible for the deadliest form of malaria, causes one million deaths annually. Recently, resistant strains of the parasite are leaving standard treatments ineffective. The goal of this study is to identify a new genetic target for the treatment of infections caused by apicomplexan parasites. This study focuses on the nifU gene which transcribes two forms of a scaffolding protein known to be crucial to the assembly of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters. Fe-S clusters are known to be involved in host cell modification, ribosome biogenesis, and in sensing redox signals. Using another apicomplexan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, as a model, this study utilized bioinformatics, endogenous tagging, and Western blot analysis to characterize the nifU gene in apicomplexan organisms. To our knowledge, this study is the first to confirm the expression of a nifU protein in apicomplexa. This study has shown that the nifU gene in apicomplexa has a unique region that could potentially serve as a therapeutic target. This study has also demonstrated that the nifU protein has multiple localizations to the parasite’s mitochondria and apicoplast throughout the invasion-lyses cycle. A new hypothesis for the interactions between the parasite’s apicoplast and mitochondria is proposed.

IDENTIFICATION OF THE TARGET OF THE ANTIBIOTIC SALINAMIDE A
Katherine Yon Ebright
North Brunswick Township High School, North Brunswick, NJ

The antibiotic salinamide A (Sal) inhibits bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) in vitro. The objectives of this work were to determine whether Sal inhibits RNAP in vivo, to determine whether Sal kills bacteria by inhibiting RNAP, and to obtain information about how Sal inhibits RNAP.<br><br>To determine whether Sal inhibits RNAP in vivo, effects of Sal on RNAP activity in vivo were assayed. Upon addition of Sal to bacteria, RNAP-dependent RNA synthesis decreased immediately, indicating that Sal inhibits RNAP in vivo.<br><br>To determine whether Sal kills bacteria by inhibiting RNAP, spontaneous Sal-resistant mutants were isolated, and genes for RNAP subunits in Sal-resistant mutants were amplified and sequenced. One hundred percent (28 of 28) of analyzed Sal-resistant mutants contained mutations in genes for RNAP subunits, indicating that Sal kills bacteria by inhibiting RNAP.<br><br>Substitutions conferring Sal-resistance were obtained at positions 690-782 of RNAP beta' subunit and positions 569-677 of RNAP beta subunit. When mapped onto the three-dimensional structure of RNAP, the sites of substitutions conferring Sal-resistance formed a compact cluster ("Sal target"). The Sal target is likely to be the binding site for Sal on RNAP. The Sal target overlaps the RNAP active center, suggesting that Sal interferes directly with RNAP active center function. The Sal target does not overlap the targets of currently used antibiotics, and, accordingly, Sal does not exhibit cross-resistance with currently used antibiotics.<br><br>The Sal target represents an attractive new target for antibacterial drug discovery.

A NOVEL APPROACH TO MAPPING PROTEIN INTERACTIONS DURING PILUS BIOGENESIS BY USING IN VIVO PHOTOCROSSLINKING
Erica Brooke Portnoy
Commack High School, Commack, NY

The purpose of this study was to map the protein interactions involved in uropathogenic Escherichia coli P pilus secretion. P pili are external structures that facilitate adhesion to kidney epithelial cells, playing a major role in bacterial pathogenesis. Constructed through the chaperone/usher pathway, they are composed of monomeric proteins that are assembled and secreted at the cell surface by an outer membrane usher. The N-terminal domain of the usher contains a disulfide loop region that is required for unidentified steps of pilus assembly following the binding of chaperone-subunit complexes. To map interactions of the disulfide loop region, mutant amber suppressor tRNA was used to incorporate a synthetic photocrosslinkable amino acid, p-benzoylphenylalanine (pBpF), at sites distributed throughout the loop region. Interactions were captured upon exposure to UV light. Results show that the photocrosslinking method is functional for use in the study of P pilus biogenesis, that pBpF can be incorporated without structural deformation, and that the disulfide loop domain serves a structural purpose in pilus biogenesis. Understanding the mechanisms of the chaperone/usher pathway can lead not only to a further understanding of bacterial pathogenesis, but also to the development of novel methods for fighting bacterial infection.

SYNTHESIS AND USE OF GOLD NANOPARTICLE THERAPEUTICS IN ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANT BACTERIA
Soyeun Yang
Fairview High School, Boulder, CO

In recent years, nanoparticles have become increasingly promising in the biomedical industry due to their potential as novel tools in drug delivery. This research focused on the synthesis and applications of gold nanoparticle systems that would potentially maximize bacterial uptake and the growth inhibition of various bacteria. These experiments explored the abilities of gold nanoparticles not only to act as binding sites for antibiotics and uptake promoters (i.e. glucose or biotin) but also to carry antibiotic drugs into S. aureus and E. coli.<br><br> I synthesized gold nanoparticles of two sizes by attaching them to various ciprofloxacin-based antibiotics as well as to glucose or biotin. First, the ligand attachments to the gold nanoparticles were confirmed by gel electrophoresis and UV-visible spectroscopy. The concentrations of gold and antibiotic in each nanoparticle system were determined using the Beer-Lambert Law. Then the inhibitory effects of the nanoparticle systems were tested and evaluated on E. coli and methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. The results showed that nanoparticles can be successfully modified to increase their uptake in bacterial cells, consequently inhibiting bacterial growth. The nanoparticle systems studied were able to significantly inhibit both strains of S. aureus while they had limited effects on E. coli. Given the results on bacterial inhibition, these gold nanoparticles show potential as vehicles for drug delivery, which may be applicable to other therapeutics as well.

EPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS-INDUCED ALTERATIONS TO CELLULAR CHROMATIN: A POTENTIAL MECHANISM FOR HIT AND RUN ONCOGENESIS
Ethan Traveny Skaggs
Caddo Parish Magnet High School, Shreveport, LA

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a gamma-herpesvirus known to establish lifelong persistent infection in humans and is associated with numerous malignancies. The pattern of connection between the virus and associated malignancies is unpredictable. A transient model of infection was established in which a carcinoma cell line infected with a recombinant strain of EBV were allowed to lose viral genomes through the removal of selection pressure. These EBV-negative, transiently-infected clones grew in a cohesive matter, unlike the parental and vector controls. This morphological change was maintained for over ten passages subsequent to proven loss of the virus. Global gene expression identified changes in expression in approximately 1% of genes, when comparing the gene expression of EBV-negative, transiently-infected clones to that of uninfected controls. Among the downregulated genes was E-cadherin, a gene known to be DNA methylated in cancer. E-cadherin is hypermethylated in EBV-positive gastric and nasopharyngeal carcinomas. Transient EBV infection was shown not to change DNA methylation of the E-cadherin promoter; moreover, infection was responsible for the formation of a repressive chromatin state, repressing E-cadherin expression. Results suggest that EBV can alter gene expression through epigenetic changes in formerly infected cells, while its own, true contribution to the oncogenic process is hidden.

THE CHARACTERIZATION OF A SHORT CHAIN OXIDOREDUCTASE ENZYME IN M. TUBERCULOSIS
Dana Victoria Hogan
City Honors School, Buffalo, NY

M. tuberculosis is the etiological agent of the disease tuberculosis, responsible for the deaths of millions worldwide. In an effort to combat the disease through the study of the bacterium's critical enzymes, a specific family of Short Chain Oxidoreductases were examined. Enzyme Q11150 was selected for analysis through a variety of biochemical and bioinformatic techniques. The aim of this study is structural characterization through protein crystallization. Additionally, the enzyme will be compared ti human homologs to ensure that, in the event of use as a drug target, harmful side-effects do not occur. At this time, there is no conclusive biochemical evidence to support the hypothesis that Q11150 is a viable drug target; however, any eventual characterization will contribute to the Protein Data Bank.

THE DIFFERENCE IN BACTERIAL GROWTH ON GOLD PLATED, SILVER PLATED AND COPPER EARRING HOOKS AFTER EIGHT HOURS OF WEAR AND TWENTY-FOUR HOURS OF INCUBATION AT BODY TEMPERATURE
Elizabeth Claire Mappus
Academic Magnet High School, North Charleston, SC

The scientific question researched and tested in this paper and experiment is whether or not more bacteria exists on gold plated, silver plated, or copper earring hooks after a period of eight hours in the ear and twenty-four hours of incubation at 36.6 degrees Celsius. Out of the great number of people who have pierced ears, very few realize how much bacteria accumulates on that tiny scrap of metal after only a few hours of wear. If not washed regularly, these unwashed earrings would increase the wearer’s chance of getting an infection. The null hypothesis in this experiment was that If gold plated, silver plated, or copper earrings are swabbed after a period of eight hours in the ear and incubated on soy agar plates at a temp of 36.6 degrees Celsius for twenty-four hours, then there would be no significant difference between the amount of bacteria growth after twenty-four hours on the gold, silver, or copper earrings. Recent tests have shown that copper has some natural antibacterial qualities that may decrease the amount of time bacteria can survive on its surface. The results showed that the null hypothesis was rejected; the gold plated earring posts having an average of 2.2 CFUs, the silver plated having an average 2.8 CFUs, and the copper having an average of only 1.8 CFUs.

IN VITRO EVALUATION OF THE POTENTIAL FOR RESISTANCE DEVELOPMENT IN CARAGENIN CSA-13
Justin Daniel See
Karl G. Maeser Preparatory Academy, Lindon, UT

Antibiotic resistant bacteria are a major problem for the drug industry. One of nature’s oldest methods for killing bacteria, Anti-Microbial Peptides (AMPs), have been killing bacteria for eons and may serve as a model to stop bacteria from becoming resistant to antibiotics. AMPs themselves are expensive and impractical, so researchers have developed non-peptide mimics called caragenins. My question was if caragenins retained AMP’s ability to continuously kill bacteria, and I hypothesized that caragenins would have a low potential for resistance development and therefore retain the ability to kill bacteria over time. <br><br> In order to test my hypothesis, I grew samples of A. Baumannii (AB) and P. Aeuruginosa (PA) in the presence of Colistin, a common drug, so that the bacteria developed increasing resistance over time. I periodically measured and recorded the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), or the smallest concentration of the drug necessary to kill the bacteria. Eventually, Colistin resistance skyrocketed in both strains of bacteria. <br><br> This data was contrasted with already existing MIC data for a leading caragenin, CSA-13. There was a consistently low amount of resistance development in AB, PA, and S. Aureus when grown in the presence of CSA-13. When compared to the MIC data from Colistin, as well as data from the common drugs Ciproflaxin and Vancomycin, CSA-13 showed significantly lower amounts of resistance development. <br><br> This data shows that CSA-13 has retained AMP’s low potential for resistance development, confirming my hypothesis. Caragenins are a major step towards long-lasting and effective antibiotics.

VACCINE PRESERVATIVES: THIMEROSAL OR 2-PHENOXYETHANOL?
Andrew Kay Andreasen
Woods Cross High School, Woods Cross, UT

This work compared efficacies of two common vaccine preservative agents, Thimerosal and 2-phenoxyethanol, to determine if the preservatives kill or inhibit bacteria along with the effect of chemical concentration.<br><br>Effectiveness of each chemical was determined using two assays: a “killing” assay and an “inhibition” assay. The “killing” assay determined the chemicals’ abilities to kill Staphylococcus aureus by creating 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001% solutions of control (water) and the 2 reagents in a solution of NaCl and S. aureus. These were refrigerated, diluted and plated on petri dishes. Significant Colony Forming Units of bacteria were then counted. <br><br>For the “inhibition” assay, a 0.1% solution of S. aureus in Lysogenic Broth was made, including 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001% solutions of the 2 reagents. A water-only blank and 0.1% water-bacteria control were used too. These were placed into quadruplicate wells into the Bioscreen, a device using light to quantify bacteria cells in the solutions, and a growth curve was calculated.<br><br>The “killing” assay’s results show bacterial growth still occurring as the solutions were diluted. These results showed the chemicals inhibited bacteria, rather than killed. The “inhibition” assay results confirmed this- growth curve analysis showed that Thimerosal completely inhibits bacterial growth, while 2-phenoxyethanol increases bacterial growth, determined after significance tests and regression analyses.<br><br>The conclusion is that Thimerosal inhibits bacterial growth more effectively compared to 2-phenoxyethanol and the chemicals only inhibit, not kill, bacteria; concentration was directly proportional to chemical efficacy. Possible applications include a review of 2-phenoxyethanol use and continuation of Thimerosal use.

INVESTIGATING THE EFFECTS OF AUTOINDUCER ANALOGS ON QUORUM SENSING IN VIBRIO HARVEYI
Felix F. Angelov
Niles Township West High School, Skokie, IL

Purpose: The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether the autoinducer analog N-Butyryl-DL-homocysteine thiolactone and N-(3- Oxadecanoyl)-L homoserine lactone can inhibit quorum sensing in Vibrio Harveyi. This experiment will determine whether it is possible to use autoinducer analogs to inhibit quorum sensing.<br><br>Procedure: Three strains of V. harveyi were grown on brain heart infusion agar. Strains BB151 & BB202 were streaked onto one plate to induce each other and BB720 was streaked separately to serve as a control (because it synthesizes both autoinducers). An autoinducer analog, a small molecule that has a vital signaling function in bacterial communication (quorum sensing) analogous to that naturally synthesized by V. harveyi—was added to the agar in the experimental group with hopes of inhibiting the bacteria’s communication and consequentially eliminating it’s luminescence. After the autoinducer analogs were added, pictures were taken in a dark room every hour for 8 hours, and luminescence was recorded. Pictures were also taken after 24 hours.<br><br>Conclusion: The data supported the hypothesis. When .15g of each AI analog was dissolved in acetone, the concentration and structure of the molecule was enough to occupy the site at which AI-1 normally binds. This resulted in the absence of luminescence in the BB202 strain while the BB721 still luminesced normally. The implications of these results are important. Bacterial infections can potentially be treated through the introduction of these small analogs which disrupt their communication process thus eliminating the concern for emerging resistant strains which are non-responsive to antibiotic treatments.

ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT EFFECTS ON ESCHERICHIA COLI
Matthew Charles Wilen
Sturgis Brown High School, Sturgis, SD

A common problem today is finding an effective and easy way to keep things sterilized, whether it is lab equipment, cooking and eating utensils, or even household items. Many disinfectants are not only expensive, but are also quite harmful on the environment. One simple way to control many bacterial problems and sterilize equipment is through exposure to ultraviolet light. Ultraviolet light kills cells by denaturing the thymine bases in their DNA.<br><br>The purpose of this project is to find which ultraviolet exposure time most effectively kills the bacteria Escherichia coli.<br><br>For this experiment, the bacteria were diluted into three different dilutions; 10-5, 10-6, and 10-7. One milliliter of each dilution was spread onto 15 plates of pre-warmed agar. Three plates of each dilution were exposed to the ultraviolet light at each of the following time periods: 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 seconds. The plates were placed in a 37ºC incubator and allowed to sit for 28 hours. <br><br>The bacteria were then counted and results were recorded. In conclusion, the hypothesis was not supported. At the two minute mark, only one out of 330,000 approximate possible colonies survived the deadly rays. Through this experiment, it was shown that ultraviolet light is quite effective and does have a place in many sterilization procedures.

Weber High School, Pleasant View, UT

Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have government regulations designed to remove contaminants, such as microorganisms, chemicals, and solids from the water. Previous research has shown viruses are still present in the treated wastewater released back into the environment.<br><br>The purpose of this experiment is to compare the level of viral contamination within the wastewater before and after filtration through a 0.45 µm filter using bacteriophage as a model for virus survival. This will help determine if filtration is effective in reducing the amount of viruses. This project is working to characterize and compare the bacteriophages of Escherichia coli found in wastewater. <br><br>To test the effectiveness of filtration, 10 ml samples were collected at different treatment stages. Methodology includes soft agar overlay methods enumerated with E. coli phage and incubated at 36°C for 24 hours. Afterward, phage plaques were counted. The data shows there is a decrease in phage plaques following filtration. This also shows other microorganisms must be present in the wastewater prior to filtration acting as hosts to the phages. The phages found were isolated and the nucleic acid was extracted.<br><br> <br><br>Characterizing these bacteriophages may lead to a more effective ways of removing viruses. In return, this will provide clean and safe water, protect our environment, prevent disease transmission, and ensure human health.

PLANT SYMBIOTIC MICROFUNGI AS NOVEL FORMS OF CELLULASE AND LIGNINASE ENZYMES FOR BIOFUEL PRODUCTION, A TWO-YEAR STUDY
Francisco Xavier Orozco
Tucson Magnet High School, Tucson, AZ

Given the cost, environmental impact, and political challenges associated with petroleum, the U.S. increasingly needs a fuel supply that is inexhaustible, and domestically produced. This energy challenge has led to a boom in alternative fuel research but a major challenge remains: to efficiently degrade plant biomass, including cellulose and lignin, into simple sugars for ethanol production. Endophytic fungi reside in the healthy tissues of all plants. Because they penetrate leaf and stem tissues to complete their life cycles and are capable of degrading plant material after host plants die, they have the potential to be a novel source of cellulase enzymes for ethanolic biofuel production. This study examines for the first time the cellulolytic and ligninolytic activity of novel fungal endophytes from three plant species native to Arizona, including a conifer (Cupressus arizonica, Arizona cypress) and two angiosperms (Simmondsia chinensis, jojoba; Larrea tridentata, creosote). Overall, >75% of endophytes demonstrated cellulolytic activity, with a higher incidence among leaf endophytes (94% of strains) than twig endophytes (67%). Cellulolytic activity was more potent among leaf endophytes, both overall and within focal fungal species. Endophytes both leaves and twigs demonstrated the capacity to degrade lignin, but incidence was higher among leaf endophytes (100%) than twig endophytes (14%). PCR screening identified for the first time the presence of the cellobiohydrolase gene – critical for biofuel production at an industrial scale -- among endophytes from leaves. Overall this study shows that previously unknown endophytes are promising as potential tools in biofuels development, reveals the high frequency of cellulolytic and ligninolytic species among leaf endophytes.

THE PROTECTIVE EFFECTS OF THE VIOLACEIN PIGMENT AGAINST UV-C IRRADIATION IN CHROMOBACTERIUM VIOLACEUM
Andrew Nickolas Abboud
Tippecanoe High School, Tipp City, OH

Chromobacterium violaceum is a gram-negative, catalase-positive bacteria found in tropical regions. C. violaceum has the distinct phenotypic characteristic of a deep violet pigment called violacein. Violacein has a high molar extinction in methanol, suggesting that it is protective against visible light. The purpose of this study was to determine the protective effects of violacein against UV-induced DNA and enzymatic damage. It was hypothesized that the violacein pigment protects DNA and enzymes (e.g. catalase) from UV-C induced damage in C. violaceum. A wild-type strain of C. violaceum WT was mutagenized with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine to create mutants with varying amounts of violacein. Mutants CV9, CV13, and CV14 (non-pigmented) produced less violacein than WT, and mutants H19, H20, and H21 (hyper-producers) produced more violacein than WT. UV-induced DNA damage was assayed through sub-culture post-irradiation at 6,000(mu)W*s-1*cm-2 at (lambda)=253.7nm. Sub-cultures of WT and hyper-producers showed growth; non pigmented mutants showed no growth, suggesting violacein protected against UV-induced DNA damage. UV-induced catalase damage was assayed before and after irradiation with a dissolved oxygen sensor to determine the rate of oxygen gas dissolution. Catalase activities of WT and hyper-producers significantly decreased post-irradiation; catalase activities of non-pigmented mutants significantly increased post-irradiation. Increased activity in non-pigmented bacteria can potentially be explained by free radicals creating reactive oxidative species that induced additional catalase genes under oxidative stress, allowed by lack of violacein. These results support the hypothesis that violacein is protective against UV-induced DNA and catalase damage. Bacterial pigmentation should be further studied in other microorganisms for its applications in UV-protection.

TRUTH TO THE 5-SECOND RULE
Nicole Marie Steiner
Bishop Feehan High School, Attleboro, MA

This experiment tested the 5-Second Rule, which states it is safe to eat food within five seconds of it falling on the floor. People often think it is acceptable to eat food in this situation. The hypothesis stated the longer a piece of food was exposed to the Escherichia coli, the more bacteria it would collect. It was further thought that moist and sticky foods accumulate more bacteria than dry foods and that all foods would contract bacteria within five seconds.<br><br> E. coli bacteria were spread on three Petri dishes and incubated at 37 degrees Celsius for 24 hours at which point each contained a full lawn of bacteria. Three crackers were individually placed on each plate for 4, 15, and 30 seconds. A cotton swab was used to pick up and transfer any potential bacteria from the cracker to a new Petri dish. As a control, one cracker was swabbed after no exposure to the E. coli. These steps were repeated with noodles and starlight mints, the moist and sticky foods.<br><br> After 24 hours of incubation at 37 degrees Celsius, all dishes, except the controls, had a thin but prominent lawn of bacteria. Each plate, with the exception of the controls, showed similar growth. The colonies could not be quantified on any plate. The hypothesis was partially supported since the food was contaminated with thousands of E. coli bacteria within less than five seconds of exposure, which means people should not abide by the 5-Second Rule.

NIPPING NEPHRITIS IN THE BUD
Rahi Dilip Punjabi
Advanced Math and Science Academy Charter School, Marlborough, MA

With the rise of antibiotic resistant bacteria such as MRSA and VRE, administering antibiotics efficiently has become crucial to patient care. This study determined the most effective antibiotic against pyelonephritic (kidney-inflaming) bacteria Escherichia coli. Natural antibiotics and pharmaceutical agents were tested for their antimicrobial activity.<br><br> Standard disk diffusion tests were used to assess the sensitivity of twelve antibiotics-six natural and six pharmaceutical. Filter disks impregnated with standard concentrations of the antibiotics were applied to Petri dishes inoculated with E. coli bacteria. The plates were incubated and after eighteen hours, zones of inhibition were measured and recorded. A novel method was used to analyze the antibiotic patterns of inhibition by measuring zones in six hour intervals to determine trend lines in the speed of inhibition and faltering rates of different antibiotics. Dissolution rate testing was also conducted to determine which oral antibiotic would be absorbed most rapidly by the body.<br><br> Cefotaxime created the largest average zone of inhibition at 43.375 mm. Among the natural agents, garlic created the largest average zone of 22.25 mm. In the novel trend line testing, ciprofloxacin had the highest average change in zones over the growth period. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole had the lowest adjusted dissolution rate at 5.035 (100 mg/sec). Overall, after comparing pharmacokinetic factors such as half-life, bioavailability, protein binding, and cost, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole proved to be the most effective antibiotic to use in treating pyelonephritis.

MILK EXTRAVAGANZA
Brittany Jean Berndt
Deubrook Area High School, White, SD

Flavored milk is the most common milk choice in schools across America. However popular it is, does it even compare to regular milk? The purpose of my experiment was to compare the bacteria counts of pasteurized, naturally sweetened and artificially sweetened milk. I also wanted to see if the sugar or artificial sweetener affected the bacteria in milk. I will also be looking at the protein content of the milk and how it relates to the length of time being stored.<br><br>I hypothesize that all of the milks will have less than a 20,000 bacteria count. I do not think the sweeteners in the milk will raise the spore bacteria count. Lastly, I hypothesize that the longer the milk sets on the shelf (getting closer to but not after the expatriation date) the more bacteria will be present and the protein content will decrease.<br><br>First gather two samples of pasteurized milk, naturally flavored milk and artificially flavored milk. Dilute each sample 10 and 100 times. Plate each sample. Gather two samples of sugar and one sample of artificially sweetened milk. Dilute each sample 10 times. Pour 10 mL of each of the milk into test tubes. Heat the milk and sugars at 40 degrees for 10 minutes. Plate each sample. Do a Kjeldahl test for total protein content on each of the milks. Repeat all these steps in two weeks or closer to the expiration date.<br><br>I accept my first two hypotheses and reject my last.

ANTIMICROBIAL EFFICACY OF MYRCIARIA DUBIA ON GRAM-POSITIVE AND GRAM-NEGATIVE PATHOGENS IN VITRO
Tyler Daniel Kubina
Tuscarawas Valley High School, Zoarville, OH

The objective of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of Myrciaria dubia extracts against multiple gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria types.<br><br> The test microorganisms (Bacillus subtillus, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Citrobacter freundii) were selected because of their pathogenic capacity. Susceptibility was determined by means of Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion, agar well diffusion, and broth dilution assay techniques. Antibacterial activity was assessed in terms of the radii of the zones of inhibition measured as well as the determined minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).<br><br> A 10 percent solution of commercially-available powdered form of the M. dubia berries was prepared in deionized water and filter sterilized. The Kirby-Bauer test was conducted by placing disks impregnated with different concentrations of the extract onto seeded Nutrient agar plates. The agar well diffusion test was conducted by producing wells in the seeded agar plates and by placing varied concentrations of the extract in each well. The zones of inhibition were calculated after a 24 hour incubation period for both tests. The broth dilution test was conducted by placing varied concentrations of the extract and pure broth cultures of each organism in multi-well plates. Results were determined using a plate reader after incubation. Thin layer chromatography was also conducted in order to pinpoint the active compounds.<br><br> After testing was completed, it was concluded that M. dubia inhibited the growth of the gram-positive bacteria (M. luteus, B. subtillus, S. faecalis, and S. aureus) but none of the other bacteria.

INTERRUPTING BACTERIAL CONVERSATION WITH BLACK OLIVE (BUCIDA BUCERAS) EXTRACTS
Rohan Batra
American Heritage School, Plantation, FL

Quorum sensing (QS) is a signaling pathway used by bacteria to alter gene expression in response to changes in population density. Many opportunistic pathogens, including Chromobacterium violaceum and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, use QS to regulate virulence. Thus, by inhibiting QS, we can inhibit bacterial pathogenicity without selecting for antibiotic resistance. This study quantitatively characterized the anti-QS activity of Bucida buceras leaf extracts. B. buceras leaf extracts showed significant dose dependent inhibition of QS in CV026, a C. violaceum mutant that cannot produce its own signaling molecule, or autoinducer, but can respond to externally added autoinducer. Therefore, the inhibition seen was due to a process other than synthesis of the autoinducer. P. aeruginosa has multiple QS pathways which intercommunicate. Previously, B. buceras was shown to inhibit two P. aeruginosa QS pathways, the Las and Rhl pathways. To determine if B. buceras inhibits the Las and Rhl pathways directly or if it affects both by the inhibition of one, each pathway was isolated in a heterologous Escherichia coli system. Additionally, these E. coli strains could not produce their own signaling molecule, just as in C. violaceum CV026. B. buceras significantly and dose-dependently inhibited Las signaling but did not inhibit Rhl signaling. Therefore, B. buceras does not inhibit the Rhl QS system itself; rather, inhibition seen in P. aeruginosa is most likely due to inhibition of the Las system. Additionally, B. buceras inhibits Las and C. violaceum QS at a step other than autoinducer synthesis, and does it dose dependently.

INVESTIGATING THE USE OF USTILAGO BULLATA AS A BIOLOGICAL CONTROL AGENT FOR BROMUS TECTORUM: IS GENETIC VARIATION PRESENT WITHIN VARIOUS USTILAGO BULLATA POPULATIONS ON MPG RANCH?
Stacia Lynn Hill
Big Sky High School, Missoula, MT

The fungi Ustilago bullata has been found to prevent the development of seeds in seed banks of B. tectorum (commonly known as cheatgrass). Cheatgrass is viewed as a major problem by many farmers, and previous methods of control were inefficient and had harmful effects. U. bullata infection naturally occurs to some degree in almost all cheatgrass populations. This makes it a good candidate for use as a biological control agent for this invasive weed. Biological control of weeds can be described as the introduction or release of insects or specific pathogens in the hopes of controlling populations of unwanted or harmful vegetation. This study investigates potential protocols for the growth and infection of U. bullata within unwanted cheatgrass populations on MPG ranch; a 6,227 acre conservation land located in the northern Sapphire Mountains of southwestern Montana. <br><br> An area of interest was whether genetic variation of U. bullata could contribute to varying success rates of infection within cheatgrass populations. The result of this study concluded only minor genetic variation was present, which was not considered significant. These results have led to the study of other factors which may affect infection rates and aid in the protocol for the development of a biological control agent for cheatgrass.

THE EFFECTS OF VARIOUS CARBON SOURCES ON THE GROWTH RATE AND LIPID PRODUCTION OF CHLORELLA SP.
Noelani Hannah Murray
Kauai High School, Lihue, HI

Chlorella sp. is an alga that requires carbon dioxide (CO2), water, sunlight and a small amount of minerals to grow and reproduce asexually. Different carbon sources affect the algae's growth rate and lipid production in its own different ways. By feeding separate flasks of Chlorella sp. algae culture three different carbon sources; CO2, sugar and sodium bicarbonate, I hypothesize that there will be a difference in both the growth rate and lipid production. I concluded that sodium bicarbonate was the best choice due to its acceptable results and its inexpensive use. Glucose produced the highest biomass and lipid production because it is so quickly and easily digested by the algae. Oil can be extracted from dried algae and be turned into multiple forms of biofuels, which in the future may replace petroleum and be used for many other energy sources. Algae is the fastest growing organism on Earth and is by far the most efficient biofuel; General Atomics Kauai has demonstrated a production rate of up to 5000 gallons of oil per acre per year, 10 times more oil per acre than conventional crops, such as grapeseed, palms, soybeans, or jatropha. Algae fuel is a non-food source biofuel, unlike other biofuels such as corn and soybean, which could be used as food. Algae also can conveniently be grown in fresh, brackish, salt or pond water in dry, hot lands not suitable for food production rather than farming land. When food crop biofuels are wasting water, rich topsoil, nutrients and valuable farming land, algae is being grown on invaluable land in ponds that use recycled water and is consuming CO2 that could potentially contribute to global warming. Algae biofuel is currently being researched in the hope of replacing petroleum in the near future.

SYNERGY IN ANTIBIOTICS
Vishnukumaar Premsankar
South Burlington High School, South Burlington, VT

The purpose of this experiment was to find synergy between different antibiotics. Three experiments were conducted. The first experiment was to test and see whether it was possible or not to measure the growth of Escherichia coli bacteria. The second experiment was to set the range of doses for each antibiotic. The third experiment was to culture the bacteria and test for synergy between the different antibiotics. To execute this three part experiment, the following steps were followed. For the first experiment, 50 microliters of cultured E.coli bacteria was put into 1 milliliter of broth. The tube was placed in a shaking incubator. This incubator was monitored and checked using a spectrophotometer for possible growth every 30 minutes. Doubling time turned out to be 2 hours of incubation. For the second experiment, the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration of representative antibiotics in different drug classes were researched and tested on the E.coli bacteria. This gave an S curve of bacterial inhibition which was possible to analyze when looking for the right dose that was needed to be used for the synergy test. In the third part of the experiment, different non-inhibitory doses of the antibiotics were put together into culture tubes of 50 microliters of E.coli cultured bacteria and 1 milliliter of Luria broth. This test produced the information needed to determine any sign of synergy between the different antibiotics. After conducting the experiment, a synergistic effect was found between two of the antibiotics, ampicillin and neomycin.

FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERIZATION OF GREEN TEA-RESPONSIVE PROTEINS IN ESCHERICHIA COLI
Peter Yin
Ames High School, Ames, IA

Antibiotic resistance is one of the most pressing problems in public health. Bacteria can develop resistance to one or multiple antibiotics and become extremely difficult to treat. The main goal of this project is to find strategies to counter antibiotic resistance. Previous studies have shown that Green Tea Extract (GTE) can reduce antibiotic resistance by making bacteria more sensitive to treatment, but the molecular mechanism by which GTE makes E. coli more susceptible to antibiotics is not known. In this study, I discovered a molecular link between GTE and antibiotic resistance in outer membrane protein W (OmpW), a porin protein located in the outer membrane of E. coli. First, by SDS-PAGE protein gel analysis, I found that both GTE and its major catechin component, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), reduced the protein levels of OmpW in wild-type E. coli BW25113. Second, using mRNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), GTE and EGCG were found to reduce the levels of OmpW mRNA, indicating that GTE and EGCG regulate OmpW expression at the transcriptional level. Lastly, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and survival capability tests, I determined that the OmpW deletion mutant was more susceptible to ampicillin and tetracycline treatment compared to the wild-type, demonstrating that OmpW protein is involved in antibiotic resistance in E. coli BW25113. Taken together, these findings establish an important molecular connection between GTE/EGCG and antibiotic resistance. Further research into how EGCG regulates OmpW expression can help develop strategies to fight antibiotic resistance.

EFFECT OF CULTURE AXENICITY ON PROCHLOROCOCCUS PHAGE INFECTION KINETICS
Laurie Ann Rumker
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland, OR

Prochlorococcus, an abundant marine phytoplankton, contributes significantly to global nutrient cycling and climate regulation and is used as a model organism for microbial evolution in the oceans. Recent research has demonstrated the importance of phage in the life and evolution of Prochlorococcus, as phage cause host cell mortality and facilitate horizontal gene transfer. However, obtaining and maintaining axenic Prochlorococcus cultures, samples free of foreign microbes, is difficult. Therefore, the cultures used in many of these studies also included heterotrophic strains that coexist with Prochlorococcus in the ocean. The present study investigated the possible effect of heterotrophic bacteria on Prochlorococcus phage infection kinetics to better understand this biological process and to examine the related validity of previous Prochlorococcus phage research. The cyanophage P-SSP7 was used to infect both axenic MED4 cells and MED4 cells inoculated with four heterotrophs isolated from non-axenic MED4. Quantitative polymerase chain reactions were used to monitor phage counts during the 14-hour infection period. Flow cytometry was used to monitor host cell counts. The results suggest infection kinetics did not differ significantly between the axenic and heterotroph-inoculated cultures, supporting high specificity of P-SSP7 for MED4 and the validity of prior P-SSP7 research performed with compromised MED4 cultures.

SALTY SITUATION
Jessa Lynn Dee Zimmerman
Trenton High School, Trenton, ND

Microbial life may exist in extreme environments on other worlds. Quantities of salty water may exist on Mars and Europa, suggesting survival of halobacteria requiring ten times the ocean’s NaCl. H. salinarium and H. NRC-1 were starved long-term in NaCl and complex salt solutions. Cells were grown in 213 media, centrifuged and rinsed in salt solution then starved at 4°C and 37°C. The viability was determined using 213 media, incubation at 37°C and OD readings. The halobacteria do not grow well on plates, especially when starved. Halophiles survived long-term starvation in complex salts better than NaCl. The NRC-1 4°C liquid starved long-term recovered more quickly than salinarium. The NRC-1 solid starved cells showed good recovery. The short-term starved halophiles in liquid 4°C complex salts recovered the best at first. Once 4°C solid cultures started to grow, they recovered quickly. Salinarium recovered more quickly than NRC-1, even with more NRC-1/ml at starvation set up. The healthy NRC-1 cells resisted UV exposure and responded to photoreactivity better than salinarium. The long-term starved NRC-1 4°C liquid complex salt resisted UV exposure best. The salinarium NaCl and complex salt cultures in 4°C liquid starvation also grew. Ecoli showed resistance to UV, but Staph epidermidis responded to photoreactivity. Healthy cultures grew in the vacuum but not CO2. Starved 2 month 4°C cultures placed in CO2, vacuum and freezer for 14 days at 4°C all survived. The liquid phase recovered better, as did the vacuum, CO2, and salinarium. <br><br>Look in cold, liquid, salty environments for halophiles.

NEUTRALIZATION OF ESCHERICHIA COLI BACTERIA WITH FOOD EXTRACTS
Aprotim Cory Bhowmik
Parkview High School, Lilburn, GA

Infecting thousands of people in the Unites States every year, Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a common and occasionally fatal bacterium that can be transmitted through uncooked food, unpasteurized milk, and water. Although antibiotic drugs can be used to prevent/treat the illnesses caused by the E. coli bacteria, these drugs have side effects, and their frequent use can cause the bacteria to be more resistant to the drugs. The purpose of this research was to investigate the effects of natural food extracts on the growth of the E. coli bacteria, with the ultimate objective of determining if natural food extract(s) can be used to prevent/treat diseases caused by the E. coli bacteria. Based on background research, it was hypothesized that the extracts of garlic, ginger, lemon, and onion will have the greatest effect on the growth/neutralization of the E. coli bacteria. The effects of these natural food extracts were studied by counting the number of E. coli colonies that developed over a four-day experimentation period. An antibacterial agent (Ampicillin) was also used in one of the samples for the purpose of comparing the effects of a commonly used medicine with those of the natural food extracts. The results of the experiments indicate that extracts of garlic and lemon can be as effective as Ampicillin in the neutralization of the E. coli bacteria. The results of this research have significant practical implications, which include the potential to provide advancements in the prevention/treatment of the diseases caused by the E. coli bacteria.

SURVEY OF BACTERIAL PREVALENCE IN RAW MILK
Lucy Michelle Hritzo
Villa Joseph Marie High School, Holland, PA

As demand for organic products increases, and growth in this multi-billion dollar industry explodes, consumers increasingly seek the reported benefits of drinking raw milk. Alleged benefits must be weighed against the risks associated with un-pasteurized milk. Reported serious illnesses, including kidney failure and death, are linked to raw milk. It is therefore important to investigate the safety of consuming raw milk.<br><br>In this project, raw milk from 5 dairies was cultured on TSA to determine bacterial prevalence, with pasteurized milk as the control. Milk was cultured on selective/differential media, MacConkey-Sorbitol agar, Staphylococcus 110 agar, and Mannitol Salt agar, to determine coliform and Staph. counts. Agar and colony color were examined for pathogenic E. coli and Staph. Gram staining further characterized bacteria type, shape, and size. <br><br>All raw milk samples had considerably higher bacterial prevalence, some over 100,000 to 3.8 million CFU/mL, compared to the control, with 0-10 CFU/mL. All raw milk samples were significantly higher than 9 states’ standards of 10 coliforms/mL. Staph. counts for raw milk were higher than state regulations of 10,000 CFU/mL. Gram staining confirmed G– rod for possible E. coli and G+ cocci for possible Staph. pH indicators and colony color also showed the potential presence of pathogenic strains, E. coli O157:H7 and Staph. aureus.<br><br>From the data, it appears the bacterial, coliform and Staph. counts of the raw milk exceed state and federal regulations. The apparent presence of pathogenic strains E. coli O157:H7 and Staph. aureus show raw milk is potentially unsafe for consumption, meriting further study. Future studies include serological testing determining if E. coli O157:H7 and Staph. aureus exist in raw milk.

THE EFFECT OF THE GUAVA TREE LEAF ON MAKING PORK INTESTINE EDIBLE FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION
Francisco Roberto Martinez
Radians High School, Cayey, PUERTO RICO

The purpose of this project was to examine the effect of guava tree leaves on making pork intestines edible for human consumption. The hypothesis stated that, do to the well-known antiseptic effects of the guava tree leaves, it would have work. First three intestines were cleaned with a guava leaves extract and then scrubbed with guava leaves. After this another was cleaned with water only. Five water samples were taken to the lab, the positive control (water from the intestines cleaned with water only), the negative control (water only), and three water samples of the intestines cleaned with guava leaves. The samples were first incubated in a Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) media, to see if any of the samples had bacteria. After 24 hours, the samples where verified, and the only one that had no bacteria presence was the plain water sample. But to verify if the guava leaves had any effect on the intestines, a sample of each TSB was transferred, by streaking, to an Blood Agar (BA) and MC Conkey (MCK) media plates (one plate of each media). After 24 hours on the plates, the same results were viewed, and the bacteria colonies couldn’t be counted, hence the guava leaves had no effect. Based on the results of this experiment, the hypothesis that guava leaves could work to clean pork intestines (and make them edible for human consumption) was rejected.

ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY AND PHYTOCHEMICAL SCREENING OF SAGO-PALM ROOT EXTRACTS
Thammarong Tangsai
Buranarumluk School, Muang District, Trang, THAILAND

This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of the Sago-Palm root extracts in resisting bacteria that cause diarrhea and food poisoning. The study consisted of four experiments. The first experiment investigated four extracts including petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol and crude extract that inhibited those bacteria through disc diffusion. Subsequent to multi-step separation based on polarity, potential bacterial inhibitor was found in polar solvent specifically ethanol. In second and third experiment, the extracts from multi-step separation were used to perform the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). The result showed that ethanol extract has the highest minimum for inhibiting (0.25 mg/ml) and killing (1 mg/ml) S.aureus. Our findings indicated that petroleum ether/ethyl acetate/ethanol fraction was the most effective inhibitor and killer for S.aureus. Finally, the extracts were further examined through Phytochemical Screening using modified qualitative methods for detecting chemical components. Deoxy and reduced sugar, tannin, cardiac glycoside, alkaloids and saponin were found to be composites in Sago-Palm root extract. Whereas petroleum ether extract had no inhibitory function, polar fraction of Sago-Palm root extracts could inhibit virulent Staphylococcus particularly S.aureus. Our results can contribute to the databases in pharmaceutical botany of Sago-Palm root, that have never been studied systematically.

KILLER EXTRACTS II: A STUDY ON THE ANTIBACTERIAL EFFECTIVENESS OF PSIDIUM GUAJAVA
Eliza W Mongeau
The Good Hope School, Frederiksted, St.Croix, VIRGIN ISLANDS

Using Caribbean plants for medicinal purposes has always been a common practice in the United States Virgin Islands, and the tradition is continuing just as strong in the 21st century. Knowledge of the specific uses of certain plants has been passed from generation to generation, and is a thriving part of the culture of the USVI. The purpose of my experiment is to further characterize and isolate the previously identified effective antibacterial activity of the Psidium guajava leaf. To do so I tested various levels of concentrated extracts of Psidium guajava on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. I tested the effect of various levels of concentrated extracts from Psidium guajava leaves on gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. My procedure included making extracts using 4 solvents (water, ethanol, acetone and hexane). Using filter disks, I tested the plant extracts on Gram-positive bacteria (B.subtilis) and Gram-negative bacteria (E.coli). The extracts made were changed in each experimental procedure. Using the most effective solvents, acetone and water, concentrated extracts were created to determine the possible strength of the extract. The major conclusion found in my study is that acetone is the most effective extraction condition and the antibacterial activity can by successfully concentrated by evaporation of the acetone solvent and resuspension with either acetone or water. Future studies include fractionation of the guava extract. Fractionation would identify the antibacterial factor of the plant. Successful fractionation would result in an even more concentrated and powerful antibacterial extract and potential isolation of the active ingredient(s).

BACTERIAL INHIBITION WITH NATURAL SUBSTANCES VS. STREPTOMYCIN
Induja Reddy Nimma
duPont Manual Magnet High School, Louisville, KY

Can a natural substance such as cinnamon, ginger, onion, turmeric, and vinegar inhibit bacteria as well or better than Streptomycin; a pharmaceutical antibiotic? <br><br>The hypothesis for the experiment was, yes. The natural substance hypothesized to inhibit the most effectively was turmeric. However, the hypothesis was not supported fully; a natural substance did inhibit the bacteria better than streptomycin, but it was ginger, not turmeric. <br><br>In this experiment, 30 petri dishes filled with agar had been plated with bacteria evenly covering the surface. After the bacteria had set, four agar plugs were removed from each dish and filled with 170 µl of substance solution. Four different concentrations of the six solutions were placed in each dish. After all of the solutions had been placed, the petri dishes were placed in an incubator for 12 hours. After the elapsed time, the radii of the zones of inhibition in every dish were recorded in millimeters. The substance with the largest zone of inhibition was the most effective inhibitor; ginger was the most effective with an average radius of 17 mm for its highest concentration. Cinnamon and onion came in 2nd and 3rd place. <br><br>My hypothesis was partially supported; a natural did inhibit bacteria more effectively than an antibiotic. However, that natural substance was ginger and not turmeric.

AN ECO-FRIENDLY ANTIFUNGAL AGENT: LEAF EXTRACT OF GIRARDINIA DIVERSIFOLIA
Diksha Gupta
Maharaja Agarsain Public School, Delhi, INDIA

Cajanus cajan is one of the most important legumes in the world. Wilt caused by Fusarium udum is the most menacing fungal disease of C. cajan. Chemical control methods are in practice to control Fusarium-wilt. But, the indiscriminate use of synthetic fungicides is causing health problems, environmental pollution and pathogen resistance. Utilization of plants and their products for pathogen management has become the demand of this century. <br><br>So far no work has been done to explore the antifungal activity of leaves of G. diversifolia, an annual herb of the family Urticaceae, growing abundantly in India. Thus in my research project, I have studied the efficacy of leaf extracts of G. diversifolia on F. udum.<br><br>Antifungal activity of the aqueous and organic extracts of leaves of G. diversifolia was studied following poison food technique. The aqueous extract showed complete inhibition of fungal growth at a concentration of 1500 µg/ml and inhibition of 95% spore germination at 2000 µg/ml. Moreover, it appeared to be fungicidal at concentrations >4000 µg/ml. The aqueous extract also caused significant reduction of wilt incidence in field conditions largely comparable to the systemic fungicide carbendazim. Phytochemical analysis of the extract confirmed presence of flavanoids, tannins, saponins and anthraquinone. The aqueous extract also showed insecticidal property causing 97% mortality in Helicoverpa armigera.<br><br>Thus, aqueous extract of G. diversifolia leaves possesses high fungi-toxicity and can be used as an eco-friendly, cost-effective and non-toxic alternative to harmful chemical fungicides.

MICROBIAL EXPLORATIONS OF A NEW WINDOW INTO THE DEATH VALLEY DEEP HYDROLOGICAL FLOW SYSTEM
Alexandra Elane Wheatley
Northwest Career and Technical Academy, Las Vegas, NV

Exploratory boreholes or wells, often hundreds of meters deep, are being drilled by scientists of the National Park Service to assess hydrologic resources near Death Valley in eastern CA, USA. These deep wells can serve as windows into unexplored subsurface microbial ecosystems. Nevares Spring deep well was compared to other deep subsurface habitats to study the microbial diversity, potential for novel life, and possible inter-basin flow in the Great Basin region. Bacterial cell samples were collected using filtration and nucleic acids extracted; the 16S rRNA gene was amplified through polymerase chain reaction, and cloned for DNA sequencing. Phylogenic analysis of sequenced DNA showed that Nevares deep borehole houses an uncultured bacterium closely related (approximately 98% of 16rRNA gene) to other deep subsurface environments geographically distant locations. This could be a possible implication of ancestral linkage of bacteria in the deep subsurface.

Go Green: <br><br>Background: Broccoli sprouts are a plentiful source of sulforphane. Broccoli sprouts are a dietary source which will combat h-pylori. It has been estimated that 50% of Americans harbor this harmful bacteria, though they don’t always display symptoms. When h-pylori cause infection treatment can be difficult ; typically it involves taking two different antibiotics. The end result of this is frequently another ulcer; in approximately 20% of patients, the h-pylori caused infection is not cured by commercially produced antibiotics. Methodology: This study focuses on making a natural sanitizer using extracts from broccoli. Some of the ingredients that will use in this all natural sanitizer are amylase (increase the antibiotic out-put of broccoli) Alcohol (fight infection), and aloe (protection for the skin) agents. Antibiotic test and microbiology agar plate procedures will test the effectiveness of the sanitizer .Results: The zones for broccoli extracts averaged a 3.6,mm were as though sanitizer’s average was 11.6mm broccoli go green average was 5.6mm and alcohol average was 5mm. Broccoli by itself did show zones so it showed some antibiotic activity but the activity was greater when the go green was made. Conclusion: Broccoli can be made into a sanitizer even though it does not kill 99 percent of bacteria it still kills bacteria, it can kill bacteria 15%.

THE EFFECT OF CITRUS EXTRACT ON MYCOBACTERIUM AVIUM SUBSPECIES PARATUBERCULOSIS UNDER AEROBIC AND ANAEROBIC CONDITIONS
Erin Allison Weddle
Musselman High School, Inwood, WV

Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (PTB) is the causative agent of Johne’s disease in ruminants and has been associated with Crohn’s disease (CD) in humans. Therapy for CD includes multiple drugs. I investigated the ability of PTB to adapt to anaerobic growth from an aerobic state and susceptibility to citrus extract compared to other commonly used drugs. All strains adapted to anaerobiosis with growth ranging from ~10^6 - 10^7 CFU/ml after ~ 14 days incubation. All strains were tested for susceptibility to two dilutions of a citrus extract and compared to other antibiotics (rifampin, RIF; rifaximin, RFX; ciprofloxacin, CIP; metronidazole, MET; doxycycline, DOX; azithromycin. AZI; and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (T/S) under both conditions. All strains were 100% susceptible to the highest concentration of citrus extract tested under both conditions with inhibition ranging from 2.1 X 10^6 to 2.2 X 10^7. Susceptibility to all other drugs tested varied widely between strains. No currently used antibiotics resulted in 99% inhibition of growth in the anaerobic model. Of these drugs, MET, RFX, and RIF were the most active against anaerobically adapted strains with inhibition ranging from 0.5 to 2 logs. CIP, DOX, AZI, and T/S showed almost no activity (< 0.5 log decrease in CFU/ml). These results demonstrate that citrus extract is effective against both aerobically and anaerobically adapted PTB, unlike other current drugs. These findings suggest further studies are warranted to determine the specific mechanism of action of citrus extract against these organisms and potentially elucidate a new avenue for drug development.

A "CULTURAL" EXPERIENCE: WHAT CONCENTRATION OF STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS PROVIDES A CULTURE OPTIMAL FOR THE TESTING OF BACTERICIDAL AGENTS?
Jacob Scott Henry
Delta High School, Muncie, IN

In the United States, the extreme immune response known as sepsis is the tenth most common cause of death. While many different diseases can cause the onset of sepsis, the bacterial strain Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most dangerous. To facilitate the testing process for future experiments regarding potential bactericidal agents, I looked at cultures of S. aureus and measured their growth over time to find what population size would provide the optimal growth curve for testing. I grew the S. aureus in vials containing tryptic soy broth (TSB) for necessary nutrients. I made a series of dilutions from this stock, creating twenty total dilutions. According to my data, in a media that contains only TSB, the sixth dilution provides an optimal growth for testing. I recreated the above experiment, altering it to model the activity of S. aureus in the bloodstream. The large amounts of protein in the blood could potentially hinder the effectiveness of bactericidal agents. For our experiment, I used fetal bovine serum as the bloodstream proxy. In this recreation, I created two sets of twelve dilutions of bacteria, each grown in a media containing TSB and 2% fetal bovine serum. It appeared that in each set, the fifth dilution provided the optimal growth pattern, albeit at a much more rapid pace. In finding the dilutions most conducive to testing, I have not only simplified the overall process, but I have also created a method that should allow researchers to gather data much more quickly.

DO DIFFERENT CONCENTRATIONS OF BLEACH AFFECT THE RESISTANCE OF E. COLI?
Kathryn Elise Morris
New Prague High School, New Prague, MN

In the world today, it is common knowledge that bacteria can become resistant to antibiotics if the antibiotics are not used correctly. Now there are some new concerns among the medical community that bacteria may also become resistant to antiseptics as well. Bleach is one of those antiseptics that could possibly induce resistance in bacteria. As a household cleaner, bleach is used at many different concentrations, so in my experiment I used four different concentrations. I wanted to see if a different amount of resistance was induced for each of the four concentrations. Using the concentrations, 25, 50, and 75 percent as well as a control of sterile water, I tested to see if E. coli became resistant to the bleach. I swabbed E. coli onto the agar plates and then placed the different concentrations of bleach onto the plates using filter paper disks. After the plates sat in the incubator for 36 hours, I measured the zone of inhibition around the filter paper. The zone of inhibition is the amount of bacteria that was killed by the bleach. By measuring this diameter every round, I was able to tell if the diameter was getting smaller, meaning resistance was being built up. As I predicted, the lower concentrations of bleach induced more resistance than the higher concentrations did, however all of the concentrations induced a very large amount of resistance.

IN VITRO STUDY OF BACTERIOSTATIC ACTIVITY OF ALLIUM SATIVUM AND ITS SYNERGISTIC EFFECTS ON LEVOFLOXACIN AGAINST ESCHERICHIA COLI
Aakash Jain
Brophy College Preparatory, Phoenix, AZ

The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether Allium sativum (garlic) has an inhibitory effect on the growth of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and if it affects the antimicrobial action of levofloxacin, which was also used as a positive control. The research hypothesis was that at least one form of garlic tested inhibits the growth of E. coli when used alone or in conjunction with levofloxacin. The organism was confirmed as pathogenic. In controlled laboratory conditions, E. coli coated agar plates were exposed to three forms of garlic at two different concentrations, levofloxacin, and combination treatments containing both garlic and levofloxacin. The experiment consisted of four phases, utilizing the disc diffusion assay. The garlic treatments 1, 2, and 3 were garlic powder used in cooking, garlic powder from capsule form, and raw garlic, respectively. Bacteriostatic activity was quantified as the diameters of zones of inhibition after 24 hours of incubation at 37°C. Over the course of the entire study, the levofloxacin treatment’s average zone of inhibition against E. coli was 31.67 mm. Garlic 1 and garlic 2 both averaged 20.33 mm in the phases they had activity. Garlic 3 and all negative controls had no activity. Combination treatments had similar activity as the positive control. Two analyses of variance were conducted, the first comparing the means of the negative controls and garlic treatments and the second comparing the means of the positive controls and combination treatments. The data analyzed in the second ANOVA was not statistically significant. However, the null hypothesis was rejected in favor of the alternative based on the first ANOVA. This ANOVA had a P value of 1.04E-27 and an F value of 732.92. A Tukey-Kramer post hoc analysis and a one sample t test provided further evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

BETA LACTAM ANTIBIOTICS STIMULATE NON TYPEABLE HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE BIOFILM FORMATION IN VITRO
Kathleen Rose Maguire
Marlborough School, Los Angeles, CA

Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a biofilm forming bacterium that can cause otitis media, a middle ear infection. Beta-lactam antibiotics are used to treat otitis media however they are not effective in treating chronic infections. This study shows that sub-lethal concentrations of antibiotics stimulate biofilm formation. Different NTHi bacterial strains were incubated for 24 hours in 96 well plates in the presence of increasing concentrations of amoxicillin, cefuroxime and ampicillin. Biofilm formation was assessed using a crystal violet assay. At specific sub-lethal concentrations of antibiotic the majority of NTHi strains exhibited increased biofilm formation. These antibiotic concentrations were deemed maximum stimulatory concentrations (MSC). At these MSCs, biofilm formation increased while bacterial count decreased. When the antibiotic concentration was increased beyond this point, biofilm mass decreased. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) support these findings. Changes in the biofilm profile and bacteria morphology coincide with a large stress response at the MSC. These results suggest that the pharmacological bioavailability is not homogeneous throughout the body and that the local concentration in the middle ear is sub-lethal. Additional studies will be performed to confirm that the local concentration is lower than the administered dosage.

RDNA GENETIC ENGINEERING: TRANSFORMATION EFFICIENCY OF THE LUX GENE AND MEDICAL IMPLICATIONS
Neil Singh, Vaibhav Penukonda, 
Canterbury School, Fort Myers, FL

Every hour, two more people will face the diarrhea, fever, vomiting, and possible hemorrhagic colitis that come as a result of E. coli poisoning. And unfortunately the sicknesses may not end there. Risk of secondary infection in hospitals is at an all-time high, where those who are immune suppressed face a journey towards healthiness that is forever hindered by the health-care environment. While new ailments are often responsible, it is often simply a gene or mutation that causes a change in treatment efficiency. Mutations might leave a current treatment useless, or the transformation of bacteria via exogenous DNA material may create total resistance. It is well known that one illness often leads to another, but to what extent is this premise quantifiable? The researchers designed an experiment to correlate the efficiency of the uptake of the lux gene, a plasmid that provides resistance to Ampicillin (a treatment for E. coli), to a variation of temperature settings. This mimics the multitude of temperatures a human may face in a hospital setting, from normal body temperature to a fever to a low temperature during surgery. Using Petri dishes as a host medium, the researchers found evidence to suggest that at higher temperatures, like those exhibited during a fever, an increase in cellular activity and energy flow allows for the resistant bacteria to replicate faster than the untransformed bacteria. Indeed, the saying “Hospitals only make one sicker” has some relevance.

AN INVESTIGATION OF THE ANTI-MICROBIAL PROPERTIES OF SELECTED SNAKE VENOMS
Veronica Ardelle Gillund, Scott Bye, 
North Toole County High School, Sunburst, MT

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effectiveness of Agkistrodon piscivorus leucostoma (Western Cottonmouth), Crotalus atrox (Western Diamondback Rattle), and Hemachatus haemachatus (Ringhals Cobra) snake venoms as anti-microbial agents against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermis, and Bacillus cereus. Agkistrodon piscivorus leucostoma venom contains hemotoxic, though no neurotoxic, components, meaning it does not cause systematic reactions in its victims, but reactions within the blood. The Crotalus atrox venom is also hemotoxic, affecting the blood and tissue of its victims. Hemachatus haemachatus venom contains neurotoxic and some cytotoxic components. The neurotoxic components cause damage to the nervous system while the cytotoxic components cause cell damage. To determine if these venoms possessed anti-microbial properties, we made dilutions of 1/10, 1/100, 1/1000, 1/10,000, and 1/100,000 of each venom. Then we soaked sterile disks in each dilution of each venom and sterile distilled water (for the control), and placed on a petri dish of either Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermis, Bacillus cereus, or sterile distilled water (for the control). The dishes were then placed in an incubator at 37 degrees Celsius. Every six hours for 48 hours, we observed the petri dishes and recorded the zone of inhibitions. We completed three trials of this experiment. The results showed that out of all the tests, the only one that proved to be significant was the Cottonmouth 1/100 dilution on Staphylococcus epidermis. Therefore, the null hypothesis can be accepted for all of our tests except Cottonmouth 1/100 dilution on Staphylococcus epidermis, which, in contrast, showed antibacterial properties.

ASSESSMENT OF VARIOUS ORGANIC ELECTRON DONORS FOR ELECTRICAL PRODUCTION BY GEOBACTER GRBICIAE IN A NOVEL H-TYPE MICROBIAL FUEL CELL
Jyotishka Biswas, Jiahe Gu, 
Hume-Fogg Academic High School, Nashville, TN

Geobacter, an entire genus of metal-reducing bacteria, holds immense potential in the organic production of electricity. Using its external conductive nanowire pili, these extraordinary bacteria are able to adopt an extracellular molecule as the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain; using a microbial fuel cell, this reaction can be enlarged, allowing multiple bacteria to simultaneously produce current. In an H-type microbial fuel cell, two separate chambers exist. In the anode, bacteria oxidize an organic substance; the byproduct electrons are then pushed across a wire to the cathode, where a designated electron acceptor receives them. Here, we present a survey of five organic fuels for use in the anode as electron donor. Municipal sewage sludge (biosolids), wheat (Triticum aestivum), rice (Oryza sativa), corn (Zea mays), and potato (Solanum tuberosum) were analyzed for potential over approximately two months in a novel and inexpensive H-cell design. Statistically significant results demonstrated that biosolids produced the highest peak voltage, followed by wheat, which showed the greatest level of output consistency. With a new fuel cell deemed effective and the five most common organic products surveyed, the use of Geobacter in biological electrical production is now closer to implementation.

BIOENGINEERED RASS PROTEIN TREATMENT MITIGATES BACTERIAL LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE TOXICITY
Alvin Wang, Gabriel Molina, Apurv Suman
Oak Hall School, Gainesville, FL

Gram-negative bacteria release an endotoxin called LPS. When released, LPS binds to the CD14 receptor in macrophages, causing cell breakdown and a cascade of systematic responses known as sepsis. Our previous years of research demonstrated that Argininosuccinate synthase(ASS) was remarkably effective in counteracting LPS toxicity; however, rASS also showed poor stability, rendering its therapeutic effects ineffective over time. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) presented the potential to counteract this problem by providing the protein with a coating to shield it and improve its pharmacokinetic profile. We hypothesized that if rASS was PEGylated, then it would not only retain its curative ability but also have improved stability. <br><br>rASS protein was produced and purified through an affinity column. The rASS was then PEGylated in a 1:10 ratio using Methyl-polyethylene glycol. Biochemical characterization using gel electrophoresis showed successful expression of PEG-rASS and that PEG-rASS was able to form a complex with the LPS. In a bacterial growth test, PEG-rASS successfully suppressed a high rate of E. coli growth. PEG-rASS also effectively combated LPS toxicity in a mice macrophage model in vitro, significantly lowering the LDH release from the macrophages. PEG-rASS showcased its improved stability in a plasma stability test, maintaining three times greater concentration of protein after 24 hours than normal, unPEGylated rASS (which showed complete breakdown at the same time point). <br><br>PEG-rASS showed significantly greater stability than rASS while simultaneously retaining its therapeutic abilities in forming a LPS complex, suppressing E. Coli growth, and preventing LPS toxicity. Thereby, it was concluded that PEG-rASS has a greater potential as a treatment against sepsis.

ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY OF SYNTHETIC FIRE ANT VENOM: DEHYDROSOLENOPSIN B
Hugh Ansulm Warren, Sharolyn Slater, 
Madison Central High School, Madison, MS

This experiment was performed to determine the in vitro antibacterial activity of two synthetic fire ant alkaloids (2R, 6S)-dehydrosolenopsin B and (2R, 6R)-dehydrosolenopsin B against two pathogenic bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis, by means of the Kirby-Bauer antibiotic testing method (disc-diffusion method). BBL Sensi-Discs of Penicillin, Rifampin, and Sulfamethoxazole were used as control antibiotic agents. Both venom alkaloids inhibited the growth of S. aureus and E. faecalis. Zones of inhibition were measured and interpreted in accordance with the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. The results of this experiment suggest that synthetic fire ant venom could be utilized as an antibacterial agent in the near future.

The most known toxinogen types of microscopic fungies are genus Penicillium<br><br>and Aspergillus. The aim of our project was to observe representatives of<br><br>microfungi obtained from bread culture. Our project had four phases. Results<br><br>from the first three phases were decisive for the last one. At first, we determined<br><br>microfungi representatives in our cultures; genus Aspergillus and Penicillium. We<br><br>isolated the pure culture of Aspergillus and we selected the best nature inhibitor<br><br>among the substances in which we supposed an antifungal effect (garlic, onion,<br><br>aloe vera, propolis, oregano, greapfruit´s seeds, cinnamon). The most effective<br><br>inhibitor was garlic and cinnamon sticks. The best inhibitor was garlic. We examined the low effective concentration (10%, 1%, 0.1%<br><br>and 0.01%) in the most active inhibitors.<br><br>Our aim, in the fourth phase, was to confirm the effectivity of natural substances<br><br>after temperature rise above 100°C, as well. The effectivity has been confirmed.<br><br>We can put our results into practice by using these natural inhibitors in the process<br><br>of bread baking.

ANTIMICROBIAL BRASS IN AQUEOUS MEDIUM
Hyungjin Kim, Xiaolin Zhu, 
Robert Lewis Stevenson School, Pebble Beach, CA

The purpose of the experiment was to determine if brass is a potent antimicrobial agent relative to other metals. First, copper, zinc, brass, silver, aluminum, lead, and a control were prepared in agar petri dishes inoculated with E.Coli OP50 to determine which of these metals exhibited antimicrobial properties. Silver, copper, and brass had a “zone of clearing” around the metal where no bacteria grew. This suggested that these metals had antibacterial properties. Thus, they were selected to proceed into the next part where each metal’s potency was compared against each other. In the next experiment, the metals were placed into flasks containing bacterial broth inoculated with E.Coli OP50. The opaqueness of each solution as the bacteria grew over time was recorded with a spectrophotometer (Recorded in absorbance). Those with lower opaqueness contained fewer bacteria. Silver showed the greatest potency with brass second and copper last. Lastly, we tested two brass compositions: brass 230 and brass 260. Brass 230 is 85 percent copper to 15 percent zinc; brass 260 is 70 percent Cu to 30 percent Zn. Our results showed that brass 260 was more potent than brass 230.<br><br> From the data and outside references, the conclusion was drawn that brass is indeed comparable in potency to silver, which is the strongest antimicrobial agent of the metals we tested.

A NOVEL APPROACH TO THE REDUCTION OF VIABLE PATHOGENIC BACTERIA UTILIZING VISIBLE LIGHT AND THE ADDITION OF A PHOTO-INITIATOR
Adam Brandon Oppenheimer, Mark Oppenheimer, 
Hilton Head Preparatory School, Hilton Head Island, SC

Scientists have demonstrated the use of light in conjunction with photosensitizers to target and destroy cancer calls. This experiment investigates the use of this model in reducing the number of pathogenic oral bacteria. The purpose of this experiment is to determine the bactericidal effects of a visible curing light with the addition of camphorquinone (CQ) on pathogenic oral bacteria. <br><br>First, human oral subgingival anaerobic pathogenic bacterial cultures were exposed to a 460nm visible light source of varying durations. Results demonstrated a reduction in the number of viable bacteria as the duration of exposure increased. Compared to positive controls, bacteria were reduced by 32.5% with exposure went as long as 60 seconds.<br><br>Second, the effects of adding a photo-initiator, camphorquinone (peak absorption 460nm), to the bacterial culture and then exposing it to a light source for 30 or 60 seconds was investigated. The addition of 0.1ml of CQ to a 1ml sample resulted in a bacterial reduction of 31.4% after 30 seconds and 32.9% after 60 seconds. When 0.2ml of CQ was added to a 1ml sample, the reductions were 48.6% after 30 seconds and 51.4% after 60 seconds. Multiple negative controls ensured that the observed results were only from the addition of the CQ and its exposure to light.<br><br>Results indicate that exposure to light has some bactericidal properties, but the addition of a photoinitiator greatly enhances this effect. <br><br>Both the light source and the CQ have been shown not harm human fibroblasts. This may offer a novel approach to reducing the amounts of pathogenic bacteria that have been associated with a variety of oral diseases.

ANTIMICROBIAL SURFACE
Atakan Acar, Malik Kismet, 
Gazi University Foundation Private Science High School, Ankara, TURKEY

Lack of disinfection, one of the problems faced everywhere people chose to live, increases the harmful micro-organisms for human health. The substances used in the disinfection of daily-life spaces, shouldn’t harm the environment and the human health . In this study we aimed to show that the anti-microbial quality of Titanium Dioxide(TiO2) which has the photocatalitic quality can be used as an alternative way to decrease the cost of disinfection and prevent production of bacteria and fungus where people always are in touch and to make it common throughout the country.<br><br> First of all, high vacuumed sputtering system is used to cover the glass surfaces with Tio2 in 300 A and 500A. Secondly, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureua and Candida albicans cultures are used to examine the anti-microbial activities of glass surfaces covered with Tio2. After 24 hours leaving a number of cells placed on TiO2 covered glass surface into light for an hour, the colony count of bacteria survived was made. <br><br> When the thickness of covering and the time of light are increased, it is stated that the effect of anti-microbial quality of TiO2 also increases. If the thickness of the coverage is increased, it is seen that the E.coli, S.aureus and C.albicans kinds cannot live.<br><br> We think that it is more effective to cover the surfaces touched by people like bus holders with TiO2 than the other methods for both economical and health reasons. We believe that the TiO2 usage is going to increase through our study.

THE EFFECT OF ESSENTIAL OILS ON THE GROWTH OF STREPTOCOCCUS PNEUMONIAE
Emily Galan Murphy, Adam Kallas, 
Nicolet High School, Glendale, WI

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effect of essential oils on<br><br>the growth of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Essential oils are liquids derived from plants and have natural antibacterial properties. It is hypothesized that when essential oils are added to Streptococcus pneumoniae, bacterial growth would be inhibited. To test this, 30 Petri dishes were inoculated with S. pneumoniae. 4 sterilized filter disks and 1 pre-inoculated Penicillin G. disk were placed onto each dish. One disk was left sterile(Control Group). Using a sterile loop to measure the essential oil, 1 disk received 10 µl of oil (Experimental Group), 1 disk received 20 µl of oil (Experimental Group), and 1 disk received 30 µl of oil (Experimental Group). Ten essential oils were tested in triplicate and incubated at 37ºC for 24 hours. After removing the dishes from the incubator, readings were taken using a caliper to measure the zone of inhibition in millimeters. This shows the effectiveness of the oils against the growth of S. pneumoniae. The final data shows that Oregano at all concentrations and Thieves at 20 and 30 µl were more effective against the growth of S. pneumoniae than Penicillin G. The remaining oils had some effect on the growth of S. pneumoniae but did not show to be more effective than Penicillin G. This experiment leads to the conclusion that certain essential oils could be used topically against the growth of S. pneumoniae and help prevent the spread of disease.

TESTING THE EFFECT OF VARIABLE MUCILAGE SUBSTRATE ADHERENCE ON THE MOVEMENT VELOCITY OF ANABAENA VARIABILIS TO INVESTIGATE THE GLIDING MOTILITY MODEL FOR CYANOBACTERIAL MOVEMENT
Abhinav Sai Venkat, Kevin Timothy Keller, 
Battlefield High School, Haymarket, VA

This paper describes the effect of variable surface adhesiveness on the movement velocity of cyanobacterial species Anabaena Variabilis to investigate the gliding motility theory for cyanobacterial movement. This theory states that polysaccharide mucilage propulsion may be a viable model for motility. However, an investigation of the mucilage-substrate interactions of the bacterium is required to understand how its cells create enough force to provide motility. In addition, a study of Anabaena’s substrate-mucilage interactions could potentially have beneficial applications in water treatment. A rotator shear assay was used in conjunction with motility assays to determine hydrodynamic adhesive interactions of the bacterium as well as providing a quantifiable measurement method for filamentous cyanobacterial adhesiveness. Variable adhesiveness was established through the use of histological solvents such as Poly-l-Lysine (amino acid polymer with high biological adhesiveness), SuperFrost Plus (frosted glass), Neutral Glass (blank, untreated, and sterilized), and Jersey-Cote (silicone coating solution with low adhesiveness) microscope slide coatings. In the motility assays, bacterial samples were added to the various slides, covered with coverslips, provided a halogen white light source for directional movement, and recorded with time-lapse photography for 3 five minute trials for each experimental group. In the adhesion assay, bacteria were pre-counted, stored in thin silicon grease canals, sheared with water movement caused by a 40 rpm rotator for 2 minutes, and recounted for adhering filaments. Results showed that movement velocity directly varied with mucilage adhesiveness, showing that the gel’s adhesiveness to the substrate acts to provide a wall of rigid mucilage off of which the bacterial cell can bounce through further gel extrusion.

IDENTIFICATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL MYCOBACTERIA ISOLATES DL474, DL505A AND DL592 USING PCR (POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION) AMPLIFICATION AND DNA SEQUENCING OF GENES
Kendra Anastasia Pallin
Cloquet Senior High School, Cloquet, MN

Mycobacteria, is a genus of bacteria including the commonly know pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and the uncommonly known Mycobacterium leprosy. However, not all Mycobacteria species are pathogenic. Mycobacteria are considered "acid-fast" and are either parasitic or saprophytic. Many species of Mycobacteria have exploited any habitats throughout the earth, one being sphagnum moss bogs. Mycobacteria thrive in sphagnum vegetation, specifically bogs, because they are low in nutrients and are very acidic. The lipid character of the cell wall provides a resistance to this acidic condition making sphagnum moss bogs a suitable place for Mycobacteria to inhabit. The purpose of this project was to identify previously un-desrcibed Mycobacteria isolates DL474, DL505A and DL592. I hypothesized that there is a possibility that a new species of Mycobacteria will be identified from the isolates. The method consisted of PCR amplification of the genes hsp65, 16r sRNA, dnaJ, secA, and rpoB, genetic sequencing and BLAST searches for genetic homologies in known species of Mycobacteria. The results, suggest that is highly likely that these three species of Mycobacteria are indeed a novel species. Thus, my hypothesis is probable. However, for further verification more biochemical tests must be done. Mycobacteria, consists of both pathogens and non-pathogens. Sphagnum moss, which is a soil additive, is often found colonized with Mycobacteria species that are thought to be non-pathogenic. However, since an increase of Mycobacteria infections (non-pathogenic) has been recognized by scientists, individuals having a both a compromised and non-compromised immune system may be at risk.

INHIBITION OF XANTHAMONAS CITRI BY ORGANIC SUBSTANCES
Vishalakshi Lakshmanan
South Fork High School, Stuart, FL

The purpose of this experiment is to test the inhibition properties of five organic solutions (garlic, turmeric, tea tree oil, cinnamon, and asafetida) on Xanthamonas citri bacteria. Xanthamonas citri is a very contagious bacteria that causes premature leaf and fruit drop in citrus plants. Currently, copper sprays are being used to prevent citrus canker; however, copper tends to accumulate in the soil and slow the decomposition of organic matter. The results of this experiment will yield an organic alternative to copper sprays that can be used without the fear of environmental damage.<br><br> A liquid culture of bacteria was spread onto 6 petri dishes. Then, four wells were drilled into each petri dish. Four wells, each on different petri dishes were labeled and filled with 0.5mL of garlic solution. This step was repeated with the other 5 solutions. The inhibition zone of each well was checked every morning for 3 days.<br><br> The average for the 6 solutions in order from greatest to least was as follows:<br><br>Garlic - 5.1 cm; Tea Tree Oil - 2.15 cm; Cinnamon - 1.85 cm;<br><br>Turmeric - 0.925 cm; Asafetida - 0 cm; Control - 0 cm<br><br> Asafetida and the control solutions did not show any inhibition to the bacteria in any of the 4 trials. The turmeric only inhibited the bacteria in half of the trials, so further investigation is needed to determine its true antibacterial properties.<br><br> The hypothesis was supported because the garlic solution did exhibit the greatest inhibition of the Xanthamonas citri bacteria.

UTILIZING THE DGT GENE IN ESCHERICHIA COLI TO ASSESS THE ROLE OF DGTP POOLS IN MUTAGENESIS: POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER AND VIRUS PROTECTION
Maheetha Chandramouli Bharadwaj
Thomas Jefferson School, St. Louis, MO

This project mainly studies the mechanisms of mutations. Along with assisting with evolution, they are also responsible for causing cancerous cells. This project focuses on mutations occurring during DNA replication as a result of varied concentrations in nucleotide (dNTP) pools, particularly that of dGTP. To study this facet of DNA replication, my project utilizes the dgt gene, which encodes the protein deoxyguanosinetriphosphate triphosphohydrolase (dGTPase), in Escherichia coli. This dGTPase is thought to work by hydrolyzing dGTP into deoxyguanosine (dG) and inorganic tripolyphosphate (PPPi).Existing research suggests that dgt gene inactivation has shown mutator and antimutator phenotypes. My research takes this a step further by studying the overexpression of dgt gene (termed optA1).We will also use the Mismatch Repair System to look more confidently at mutator and anitmutator patterns. To do so, we utilize the lactose reversion assay. In this assay, we had initially three strains: dgt+(wild-type), Δdgt, and optA1 that had the lac operon deleted; thus these strains would not be able to utilize lactose. These strains were conjugated with six F' plasmids [CC101-CC106] that contained the lac operon but with a single base-pair substitution in codon 461 of the B-galactosidase-encoding lacZ gene, resulting in 18 total strains. We plate the different strains on Lac Plates. The colonies that grow have somehow changed the mutation on their F’ lac gene back to the GAG wild-type sequence, reverting from lac-minus to lac-plus again. In general, both in an MMR+ and MMR- background, the dgt inactivated cell showed a mutator phenotype and the dgt overexpressed showed an antimutator phenotype. These results have implications for cancer prevention and HIV protection.

GENETIC CHARACTERISTICS OF INFLUENZA A VIRUSES IN SWINE POPULATIONS
Keshav Kumar Mangalick
Mounds View High School, Arden Hills, MN

Swine influenza viruses have caused severe mortality in humans over the last century, including the most mortal pandemic in recorded history, the 1918-1919 H1N1 pandemic, and the most recent pandemic, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. This study examined strains of swine influenza viruses present in Minnesota swine populations between late 2007 and early 2009, immediately preceding the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. It was hypothesized that if the genomic sequences of the Minnesota viruses were compared to that of the 2009 pandemic strain, neither the pandemic virus nor any of its genomic segments would be found among the Minnesota samples.<br><br> <br><br>The RNA from these viruses was extracted and converted into cDNA for sequencing. These sequences were examined for mutations found in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain and other mutations believed to increase virulence. The sequences were broken up by segment and compared to the complimentary segments in the pandemic virus’ sequence. The results show that none of the 2007-2009 Minnesota swine influenza viruses are the 2009 pandemic strain, nor do they carry segments similar to those of the 2009 pandemic strain. However, there are mutations that are shared between the Minnesota samples and the 2009 pandemic strain. None of these mutations guarantee that the Minnesota samples are zoonotic, but it is possible that such viruses could infect humans. Thus, a comprehensive national surveillance system is needed to track the evolution and gauge the potential danger of the swine influenza strains that exist in the United States in order to minimize future mortality.

COMBATTING METHICILLIN-RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS (MRSA) WITHOUT THE USE OF ANTIBIOTICS
Adeel Ahmad
Champlin Park High School, Champlin, MN

Problem: Antibiotics have been overused to the extent that many bacteria have become resistant. So alternative medicines must be found to treat infections caused by these bacteria. In this project, various natural products were tested for their effectiveness against a methicillin resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and compared to the antibiotics currently being used to treat MRSA.<br><br>Methods: Six natural products including olive-leaf, propolis, honey, and crude extracts of onion, garlic, and ginger were used. Each product was filtered and tested for any bacterial or fungus contamination prior to testing. Sterile filter discs were loaded with precise amount of each extract. The MRSA culture was streaked onto Petri dishes of brain-heart infusion medium and discs added. Extracts were tested in duplicate and also tested against methicillin sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) for comparison. Vacomycin and cefoxitin were used as a positive control, and a disc without extract added as a negative control. All plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours.<br><br>Results: After 24 hours, the clear zone around each disc was measured. Of six products, three showed clear zones. The garlic extract had the largest clearance zone with 1.42 cm, propolis with 1.02 cm, and olive-leaf with .90 cm in diameter. No clear zone was demonstrated with onion, ginger, or honey. The positive control of cefoxitin had a clear zone on MSSA plates only.<br><br>Conclusions: This study suggests that garlic, propolis, and olive-leaf extracts could provide an alternate source of medicine to combat the resistant strains of S. aureus.

THE EFFECTS OF MYCOREMEDIATION ON INORGANIC MATERIALS
Devin Cole Buchanan
C.H. Yoe High School, Cameron, TX

The purpose of this experiment is to determine the effects of mycoremediation on inorganic materials. The inorganic materials in the experiment are materials that are severe pollutants in the world's environment. The inorganic materials are: Crude Oil, Enamel Spray Paint, Styrofoam, and 5W30 Used Engine Oil.<br><br>The procedures began with collecting a sawdust spawn of the Pleurotus ostreatus mycelium that would later be used to inoculate the cultures. Straw was then collected from a local farm and pasteurized by submerging the mass of straw in water at a temperature of 84 degrees Celsius for a period of 45 minutes. The pasteurized straw was placed in Petri Dishes to be inoculated using the sawdust spawn. The inorganic materials were then introduced at a volume of 0.5mL into the inoculated cultures. Baseline cultures were established with each individual element in the cultures without the inoculation of mycelium to compare the percentage of decrease in mass in the test cultures. Each culture was massed upon creation and observed and massed daily after that.<br><br>Growth chambers were used to measure the use of oxygen by the fungi. The data collected showed that the cultures with mycelium had a greater percentage of decrease in mass in comparison to the baseline cultures by up to 9.8%. The oxygen usage of the fungi was similar between the cultures with inorganic materials and the control culture. Thus showing that mycelium had an impact on the degradation of the inorganic materials being tested and that mycelium in a successful re-mediation process of inorganic materials.

THE EFFICACY OF MOUTHWASH ON THE BACTERIA STAPHYLOCOCCUS EPIDERMIDIS AND STREPTOCOCCUS PYOGENES
Kasey Montgomery Johnson
Sherando High School, Stephens City, VA

To maintain good health, good oral hygiene habits are needed, and mouthwash can be used as an aid to maintain optimal oral hygiene. The purpose of this experiment was to determine what mouthwash was the most effective at preventing the growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes. The independent variable for this study was the mouthwashes used, which were Crest, Scope, Listerine, a baking soda mixture and water. The dependent variable was the inhibition zone in centimeters. The bacteria were spread in petri dishes and paper discs containing each mouthwash were placed in the petri dishes. The samples were incubated for 24 hours and the inhibition zone was measured. The results for each bacteria was independently analyzed and it was found that both Crest and Scope were most effective at preventing the growth of both bacteria. The one-way ANOVA test and the t-test were used to determine if there was a significance between the data. The statistical analysis showed Crest and Scope were equally effective against the bacteria.

THE EFFECT OF UV-C LIGHT ON E. COLI
Emily Lynn Schnepp
Gresham High School, Gresham, OR

E. coli is a coliform bacterium that grows most commonly in fresh feces. The problems we have been having with it are that it’s getting into the irrigations systems and making people sick. After collecting water samples from Johnson Creek and putting them in graduated cylinders that were cut T 5, 10, 15, and 20cm, I exposed them to UV-C light to kill the E. coli. We found that the 5cm was the most affected; then the 10cm, 15cm, etc. In conclusion, we may be able to sterilize water depending on the intensity of the light and the depth of the pipe. So, the shallower the water, the more bacteria were killed.

AN EVALUATION OF COMPOUND MEDIA AND THE ANTIMICROBIAL EFFECTS ON MRSA
Emily Allison Wells
Carroll High School, Dayton, OH

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a bacterium that infects the human body. Staphylococcus is a type of Gram - Positive bacteria which appear as round grape-like clusters and appear mostly on the skin of humans and other organisms. The long term exposure of antibiotics to the human race has resulted in the emergence of antibiotic- resistant skin bacteria. This experiment evaluates the antimicrobial effects on MRSA using 12 different compounds at various concentrations. These compounds are variants of each other, differing in their R groups or structure. The compounds of various concentrations are applied to antimicrobial discs and placed on a nutrient agar that is exposed to the MRSA colony. The Petri plates are then incubated according to protocol and evaluated. The ring of inhibition is measured and evaluated. After comparing the data, it is concluded that the two compounds, D2 and D12, which are isomers of each other, showed the largest ring of inhibition. In these two compounds, the lower compound concentrations had a greater effect on the inhibition of growth than the higher concentrations. This is because the higher concentrated compounds formed a precipitate, and the entire compound was not absorbed into the discs. These results indicate that too much of a compound can prove not as effective as a smaller concentration. The compounds in concentration of 1 mg/ml had the greatest suppressing effect on the growth of MRSA because there was lesser amount of compound in the solution to be absorbed by the discs.

ERADICATING STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS CATHETER INFECTIONS
Cory L. Cummings
Cascade High School, Cascade, MT

The purpose of this project was to determine an alternative way to eradicate biofilm growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Serratia marcescens in a urethral catheter tube. Cranberry juice and lemon juice were chosen as the two experimental groups, cranberry juice because doctors recommend an individual drinks this if they get a urinary tract infection, and lemon juice because of its possible cancer-fighting properties. The methods performed in this project were first to cover 26 plates with Staphylococcus aureus nutrient broth and 26 plates with Serratia marcescens nutrient broth. Divide those plates into four quadrants and place a cranberry juice disk in the center of one quadrant, a lemon juice in another, a triclosan disk in the third, and a sterile disk in the final quadrant. Record the zone of inhibition around each disk at 24 hour intervals. Performing students t-Tests on the results shows that the results are statistically significant. Lemon juice was more effective than cranberry juice but both were statistically less significant than the control positive. This project has shown that if an individual gets a catheter infection, drinking lemon juice or cranberry juice would help the infection, but lemon juice is more effective. Lemon juice and cranberry juice are medias that need further investigation if they are to be used to eradicate Staphylococcus aureus and Serratia marcescens.

CHARACTERIZATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA ACYL-HOMOSERINE LACTONE BASED QUORUM SENSING AND INNATE MACROPHAGE FUNCTION IN VITRO
Spencer Michael Chang
West Linn High School, West Linn, OR

<br><br>Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is an opportunistic bacterium that causes serious infection in immunocompromised individuals. PA becomes even more precarious when it develops a biofilm, especially one of mucoid nature, where there are no effective treatments. But recently, quorum sensing (QS), which describes how bacteria communicate with each other via small signal molecules, has been proposed as a therapeutic target. The QS circuitry of PA is comprised of two primary systems, las and rhl. This study examines the role of QS in evasion of host immune defenses, both in a non-biofilm and biofilm model. The hypothesis that las knockouts would induce the most cytokine production and also be phagocytosed most by alveolar macrophages was tested using ELISAs and gentamicin exclusion assays, respectively. The hypothesis that las knockout biofilms would have the least percent survival against macrophages was tested using biofilm assays that involved macrophage-biofilm co-culture, and quantification of biofilm mass quantitatively with spectrophotometry and qualitatively with microscopy. The data show that QS, and especially the las system, has a role in innate macrophage function. Data also suggest that QS does not play a significant role in the ability of PA biofilms to resist destruction by macrophages. This is the first study to discover a specific relationship between QS and IL-6 expression and phagocytic properties of macrophages. The interaction between QS, biofilms, and innate immunity is very unclear, and these findings further define how PA interacts with the immune system and have many implications in developing novel treatments for PA infections.<br><br>

DOES EXTRACT FROM OPUNTIA SPP. (PRICKLY PEAR CACTUS) INHIBIT BACTERIAL GROWTH?
Brandon David Beatty
Hardee Senior High School, Wauchula, FL

The prickly pear cactus (Opuntia spp) has many protective mechanisms. The purpose of this experiment was to determine if the prickly pear cactus has antibacterial traits against gram positive and gram negative bacteria. In this experiment various concentrations of cactus extract were produced by dilution with distilled water. The extract was spread over the cultures of the bacteria of both Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The number of colonies was counted on 10 random spots of the petri dishes. On the gram positive bacteria S. epidermidis the cactus did not have a significant affect. On the gram negative bacteria E. coli the cactus extract only affected the growth of the bacteria when it was in high concentrations of 25%, 50%, and 100%. At 25% extract the reduction was 49%, 50% extract the reduction was 16.7%, and at 100% extract the reduction was 26.9%. The conclusion of this experiment is that the prickly pear cactus does have antibacterial traits but only in high concentrations and on the gram negative bacteria.

VIRUS VS. BACTERIA: THE EFFECTS OF BACTERIOPHAGES ON E. COLI COVERED EGGS
Kelly Devyn Barns
Saint Clair High School, St. Clair, MO

Food poisoning from E. coli is becoming a threat in restaurants and grocery stores all over the United States. The Center for Disease Control has seen an increase in the past 15 years in the number of cases of foodborne illness and deaths. A total of 19,087 foodborne diseases were reported in 2010, and 68 of them accrued in death. In 2011, St. Louis was a part of an E. coli outbreak, in which 51 people were confirmed with having E. coli. E. coli 0157:H7 has been estimated to cause approximately 62,000 cases of foodborne disease a year. Bacteriophages, which are viruses that kill bacteria, are active against specific types of bacterial species or strains such as E. coli. <br><br>The purpose of this study was to eliminate the E. coli on the exterior shell of an egg using the bacteriophages that were cultivated from the environment. Soil was obtained from a chicken farm and the bacteriophages were isolated from the soil using non-pathogenic strains of E. coli. Four bacteriophages that were cultivated from the soil successfully lysed E. coli 0157:H7. Five groups of eggs were tested at the University of Missouri labs. Three groups were a control, one group was a part of a mix of store bought bacteriophages, and one group was a mix of cultivated bacteriophages from a chicken farm. <br><br>Both the store bought and chicken farm mixes were successful in eliminating all the E. coli 0157:H7 on the eggs. This demonstrated that bacteriophages can be used as a possible way to prevent E. coli growth on eggs.

THE EFFECTS OF VARIOUS NITROGEN SOURCES ON THE GROWTH RATE AND LIPID PRODUCTION OF CHLORELLA SP.
Noelani Hannah Murray
Kauai High School, Lihue, HI

Chlorella sp. is an alga that requires water, sunlight, carbon dioxide, and nutrients and minerals to grow and reproduce asexually. Nitrogen's purpose is to create amino acids which link together to create protein, helping algae to grow. Different forms of Nitrogen will affect the growth and lipid production of Chlorella sp. In this experiment, I have tested three different variables: Sodium Nitrate (NaNO3), Urea ((NH2)2CO), and a proportioned combination of Sodium Nitrate and Urea (referred to as combination method). I hypothesize that the combination method will prosper the most in growth rate and lipid production. After doing my experiment, I found that my hypothesis was not supported because algae fed the combination method growth media grew the least in biomass and produced the least amount of lipids. What I found, is that by feeding algae Sodium Nitrate, algae will both generate more biomass, and will produce the most lipids. But when cost is considered, Urea has the highest absorbency units per dollars at 14.14 a.u./$, nearly twice as much as Sodium Nitrate with 7.84 a.u./$. From this, I can conclude that Urea is the best Nitrogen source for growing algae when cost is a factor.<br><br> The lipids, in this case oils, that algae produce can be extracted from dried algae and be converted into multiple forms of biofuels. Algae is the fastest growing organism on Earth and is a very efficient biofuel; An algae farm on Kauai has demonstrated a production rate of up to 5000 gallons of oil per acre per year, 10 times more oil per acre per year than conventional crops, such as grapeseed, palms, soybeans, or jatropha. Algae biofuel is currently being researched in the hope of replacing petroleum in the near future.

THE EFFECT OF SALINE SOLUTIONS ON EVIDENCE OF PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA AND PSEUDOMONAS FLUORESCENS BIOFILMS ON GLASS SLIDES AND STAINLESS STEEL
Jeffery Reaves Seals
Central Virginia Governor's School for Science and Technology/Liberty High School, Lynchburg, VA

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of .9% and 1.8% saline solutions on the evidence of biofilms growing on glass slides and flat stainless steel. To observe evidence of biofilms, slides and stainless steel were placed in containers that had an infusion, which was the combination of either Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Pseudomonas fluorescens and the appropriate solution; control, .9% saline or 1.8% saline. They were left in covered containers for two weeks then observed by air drying, plating the infusion from each container, and plating swabs of biofilms from randomly chosen slides or stainless steel. When air drying, biofilms were observed on the control and .9% Pseudomonas aeruginosa samples for both materials, however biofilms were only observed on the metal for the Pseudomonas fluorescens on the control and .9% samples. When plating the infusion from the containers, evidence of biofilms was found on all of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa plates for each solution, as well as the control for both material, and the set 1 .9% solution plate for Pseudomonas fluorescens. When swabbing the materials, biofilms grew on all of the Psuedomonas aeruginosa media plates as well as the control for Pseudomonas fluorescens on both materials. In conclusion, it was shown that the higher concentration of saline solutions inhibited the growth of biofilms compared to the control which was just distilled water.

REGULAR OR THROWBACK? DO DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER PREFER REAL CANE SUGAR OVER HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP?
Sarah Grace Pitts
Annie Camp Junior High School, Jonesboro, AR

The purpose of this experiment was to explore the preferences of Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies) to sweeteners to determine if given a choice would the flies prefer Mountain Dew Throwback, sweetened with sugar,compared to Mountain Dew, sweetened with high fructose corn syrup. My hypothesis was that the fruit flies will prefer Mountain Dew Throwback because it contains real cane sugar, compared to Mountain Dew Regular which contains high fructose corn syrup. Three control groups and one treatment group were used to determine the flies' preferences. The controls insured that color did not impact choice, and caffeine did not kill the flies. The treatment revealed that the fruit flies preferred the real cane sugar (Mountain Dew Throwback) over high fructose corn syrup (Mountain Dew Regular).

DETERMINATION OF BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES IN ACACIA RIGIDULA
Marcus Amiel Agno Ynalvez
J.B. Alexander High School, Laredo, TX

Lectins are proteins containing at least one carbohydrate or carbohydrate-derivative binding site. There are found in a number of organisms which include plants. They possess different biological activities which include anti-bacterial activity. The presence of these biological activities highlights the great potential for pharmacological and therapeutic applications. The objectives of this study are (1) to identify plant sources of lectins (2) to determine the temperature stability of the crude lectin extracts and (3) to identify potential application of the crude lectin extracts from the identified plant source.Agglutination assays were carried out to determine the presence of lectin activities while the disc-diffusion assay was used to determine the presence of antimicrobial activities. Buffalo grass, Mesquite, Blackbrush, Guajillo, Retama, and Mistletoe, were surveyed for the presence of lectin.Acacia rigidula showed presence of lectin activity, stable up to 100C. It also showed antibacterial properties against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. The antibacterial activity was significantly higher on S. aureus. The results of the experiment showed that A. rigidula could be a possible source for a cost effective and potent antibiotic for E. coli, S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium. In conclusion, the study has shown that A. rigidula has lectin and antimicrobial activities. Therefore, the isolation and purification of the lectin from A. rigidula is highly recommended. The matter of fact that A. rigidula is in abundance within the South Texas area makes A. rigidula a great candidate to be used commercially.

QUANTITATIVE POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION OF TEMPORAL EXPRESSION OF GLUCOSE OXIDASE IN APIS MELLIFERA
Corinne Marie Demler
Pecatonica Area High School, Blanchardville, WI

Glucose oxidase is an enzyme present in honey that has been demonstrated to give honey antibacterial qualities by producing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Previous studies have determined that the gene encoding glucose oxidase is present in the Apis mellifera genome and is expressed in vivo. Honey bees only produce honey during the part of the year when nectar is available; when the growing season ends, honey production stops. In this experiment it will be investigated whether glucose oxidase is expressed even when honey is not being produced, or if the gene is more highly expressed during the honey flow. <br><br> In order to determine this, quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) will be performed to compare the relative amount of expression of the gene between different castes of bees (foragers, nurse bees, drones), as well as examining expression at different points in the honey flow cycle.<br><br> The relative quantitation will be determined by primer competition between known concentrations of genomic template and unknown concentrations of cDNA. The resulting equivalence point determines where the genomic and cDNA are at approximately equal concentrations and are therefore competing equally for primers in the reaction. This will show the approximate quantity of cDNA, determining the level of expression of the glucose oxidase gene.

ANTIBIOTIC DISCOVERY THROUGH SELECTIVE CULTIVATION OF SUBTROPICAL ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLES
Nancy Gao
Nicolet High School, Glendale, WI

A major approach to discovering new antimicrobial compounds is exploration of subtropical wetland environmental samples for pharmaceutically relevant bioactive natural products. Environmental sediment samples were collected from nineteen subtropical zones in Miami and Orlando, FL., Auburn, AL, and College Station, TX. Selective media containing antibiotics apramycin and ampicillin with antifungal methylparaben were formulated to select for chromobacterium, pseudomonas and burkholderia, hypothesized to produce novel antimicrobial compounds because they are known producers of antiproliferatives. A total of 188 morphologically distinct isolates were purified and dereplicated by Rep-PCR. Taxonomic analysis through 16S rDNA sequencing of these 188 isolates was performed to determine their classification. Isolates were further analyzed through the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology) BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Tool) database to screen for taxonomically related strains. The 188 isolates were then screened for antimicrobial activity using 96-well pin replicators. The six pathogenic tester strains tested were: Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Staphylococcus aureus. 31 of the original 188 isolates expressed antimicrobial activity and 4 expressed activity to more than one test strain. These isolates are regarded as “unique” strains based upon selective cultivation and morphological characteristics.<br><br>Natural product extracts will be screened for anticancer activities. Further purification and structural determination of active natural products will afford novel chemical compounds.

THE ANTIMICROBIAL EFFECTIVENESS OF SILANE BASED NANOPARTICLES ON TREATED SURFACES
Katherine Ann Marsh
Richland High School, Richland, WA

The purpose of my experiment was to investigate the antimicrobial effectiveness of a silane based nanoparticle antimicrobial and compare it to a Silver Nitrate nanoparticle antimicrobial and traditional leaching antimicrobials over time. Manufacturers of some silane based nanoparticle antimicrobials are claiming that they are effective anywhere from one month to 3 years after initial application.<br><br> I found the third trial, in which full strength E-Coli was applied to tiles that had been sprayed with antimicrobials and lightly wiped off, to be the best indicator of antimicrobial effectiveness. All of the tested antimicrobials showed some effectiveness in the 1st 21 hours after no further contamination, but when the tiles were re-contaminated after 7 days with no additional antimicrobial application, none of the antimicrobials showed effectiveness on all of the surfaces. Opticide, a leaching antimicrobial, proved to be the most effective antimicrobial against the E-Coli during the 1st 21 hours. The ATP levels didn't have a direct correlation with the E-Coli CFU.<br><br> My hypothesis that the silane based antimicrobial would provide the best antimicrobial effect due to the molecular bond formed on the treated surface, that I based on manufacturers' claims, was incorrect. <br><br> I believe that more extensive testing would be useful in determining the short and long-term effectiveness of silane based nanoparticle antimicrobials comparing them in the same laboratory with the same techniques and to determine what concentration of active ingredients are best suited for different applications.

NOVEL TREATMENT METHOD OF BIOFILM-INVOLVED STAPHYLOCOCCUS EPIDERMIDIS INFECTION THROUGH DNASE I AND ANTIMICROBIAL COMBINATION TREATMENT
Kevin Z Xin
Shanghai American School Puxi Campus, Shanghai, CHINA

Staphylococcus epidermidis has emerged as a major cause of nosocomial infections. Formation of biofilms enables S. epidermidis to become successfully established in hospital environments. 54% of clinical isolated S. epidermidis from inpatients at a university teaching hospital in Shanghai are biofilm-forming, 96.25% are methicillin resistant. Biofilm formation causes antimicrobial treatment of medical device-related S. epidermidis infections to often fail and removal of the infected catheter or prostheses is required. The study aimed to provide scientific data supporting the development of a novel treatment method using a combination of DNase I and antimicrobial against biofilm-associated S. epidermidis infections, by evaluating established biofilms for the presence of extracellular DNA and whether the novel treatment method can enhance the bactericidal effect of antimicrobials. To simulate real-life catheter-related S. epidermidis biofilm-involved infections, the clinical isolate chosen was the most prevalent strain, responsible for over 90% of biofilm-involved catheter-related infections at the hospital. Results determined the presence of eDNA in the extracellular matrix of S. epidermidis biofilms. DNase I is able to significantly enhance the bactericidal effect of all four tested antimicrobials and reduce biomass by degrading eDNA in the biofilm’s extracellular matrix. DNase I concentrations greater than or equal to 1 ug/ml yielded statistically significant decrease in the biomass of biofilms (p<0.0001). 40 ug/ml was concluded as the optimal DNase I concentration for treating biofilm-involved S. epidermidis infections.

INVESTIGATING THE COMPATIBILITY OF AUTOINDUCER SYSTEMS: ONE MOLECULE TO TARGET MULTIPLE SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION PATHWAYS
Felix F Angelov
Niles Township West High School, Skokie, IL

The purpose of this experiment is to identify whether autoinducer receptors are compatible among different bacterial strains and genera. <br><br> Three strains of V. harveyi were grown on boron-deficient agar. S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a precursor of autoinducer 2, was added to the agar in hopes of inducing luminescence with the autoinducer 1 molecule from Salmonella typhimurium. In addition, Cholera Autoinducer 1 (CAI-1) was organically synthesized and added to the agar of the V. harveyi BB202 strain to test if CAI-1 will be compatible with the receptor in V. harveyi and if it will also induce luminescence. Pictures were taken of the control and experimental groups in a pitch black environment 24 hours after having been streaked and luminescence was recorded.<br><br> The data supports the hypothesis. When 0.15g of SAM were dissolved in 800 µl of DMSO (1%) and added to the agar of boron deficient plates, the three strains of V. harveyi began to synthesize an alternate boron-free autoinducer, identical in structure to AI-1 from S. typhimurium. As a result, AI-1 from S. typhimurium proved to be compatible with the AI-2 receptor in V. harveyi strain BB202 and induced luminescence in the absence of the normal AI-1 from V. harveyi BB151. In addition, when 0.15mg of CAI-1 were added to the agar of the normal BHI plates, strain BB202 of V, harveyi was luminescent despite the lack of AI-1 from BB151. The implications of these results are huge. Bacterial infections can potentially be treated through the introduction of autoinducer analogs which disrupt bacterial communication thus eliminating the concern for emerging resistant strains which are non-responsive to antibiotic treatments.

ALLICIN & PENICILLINASE: REVERSING PENICILLIN RESISTANCE IN BACTERIAL CULTURE
Alec Cole Emry
Arkansas School for Mathematics, Sciences, and the Arts, Hot Springs, AR

Science and evolution are locked in an arms race, as bacteria develop resistance to each antibiotic developed and more are in-turn produced; however, little thought is afforded the possibility of destroying bacterial defenses, rather than simply creating new offenses. It was hypothesized that introducing a disulfide-bonded chemical and an alkaline catalyst to cultures of penicillin-resistant bacteria would negate their resistance by instigating disulfide-thiol exchange in the enzyme penicillinase, noncompetitively inhibiting it. Wild-caught bacteria were cultured and selected for resistance and then subjected to all three chemicals in various concentrations in order to analyze their combined effect on resistance. No controls demonstrated inhibition, while clusters of discs impregnated with all three chemicals displayed various zones of inhibition up to 3 mm. These results supported the hypothesis. Future testing could be conducted to analyze whether this procedure is harmful to eukaryotes, and to what degree; it’s conceivable that drugs may be developed that utilize the principle displayed in this experiment. The thesis of this experiment in countering bacterial defenses as opposed to or in addition to developing new offenses holds broad implications for future research; this procedure may prove effective against resistance to any penicillin-derivative drug as well as to penicillin itself, the processes employed not being dependent on the drug’s variable group. These results could also conceivably be adapted to negate other enzyme-based resistances.

EVALUATING THE SYNERGISTIC EFFECT OF POLYPHENOL EXTRACTS ON ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE IN SELECTED BACTERIA
Jeffrey Gage Holleman
Cascia Hall Preparatory School, Tulsa, OK

The problem created by the misuse of antibiotics has led to an increase in newly mutated strains of bacteria that form a resistance to them over time. A proposed possible solution could be to look at natural plant products that have survived the natural onslaughts of bacteria and have survived and thrived and evolved. The purpose of this scientific undertaking is to analyze the antimicrobial properties of different organic, naturally occurring plant extracts, known as polyphenols and to determine if polyphenols will increase the efficacy of selected antibiotics. The polyphenols tested included Grape Seed Extract (GSE), Green Tea (GT) and B propolis. The problem being investigated in this research is the ability of selected essential oils to increase effectiveness of selected antibiotics on bacteria. The hypotheses evaluated include: Green Tea, Grape seed extract, and propolis will exhibit significant antimicrobial activity as measured by Disc Diffusion Methods. As polyphenol concentration increases bacterial growth will decrease, as measured by Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Sub-Inhibitory Concentration (SIC). The polyphenols tested will increase the effectiveness of the selected antibiotics on the bacteria tested by increasing the zone of inhibition in mm. The hypothesis that green tea, propolis, and grape seed extract will exhibit antimicrobial activity will be accepted for green tea and grape seed extract for all bacteria tested by the disc diffusion Kirby-Bauer Test. The hypothesis will also be accepted for propolis and B. subtilis.

ENGINEERING RCAS-TVA VECTORS FOR GENERATING A NOVEL TRANSGENIC MOUSE MODEL OF MELANOMA
Bilal Ahmed Siddiqui
Wellington C. Mepham High School, Bellmore, NY

Modeling of melanoma by regulating the expression of an oncogene of interest (BRAF, NRAS, etc.) is a costly and time consuming endeavor. A novel gene delivery system, the RCAS-TVA system, employs RCAS retroviral vectors as vehicles to efficiently insert genes into cells expressing the TVA receptor. Unfortunately, TVA is an avian protein not present in mammalian cells, resulting in the RCAS vectors being defective in targeting murine tissue for in vivo modeling of cancer. The objective of this investigation was to engineer plasmid vectors in order to express the TVA receptor exclusively in melanocytes. This was achieved via cloning the TVA800 gene downstream of a tyrosinase promoter vector, which limited TVA expression and the target of RCAS vectors to melanocytes. An auxiliary goal was to clone the BRAFV600E oncogene into RCAS vectors (BRAFV600E is activated in nearly 60% of melanomas). After successful subcloning of both TVA800 and BRAFV600E, the plasmids were sequenced and tested for functionality. TVA protein expression was verified when Melan-A cells (immortalized melanocytes) were transfected with the engineered TVA800 vector. Ultimately, successful in vitro tests have demonstrated that microinjecting the TVA800 vectors into murine embryonic stem cells and subsequently infecting the resulting mouse with RCAS vectors conjugated to BRAFV600E will result in an accurate in vivo model of melanoma.

ANTI-BATRACHOCHYTRIUM DENDROBATIDIS BACTERIAL SYMBIONTS ON ANEIDES AENEUS EPIDERMAL TISSUE
Sarah Katherine Johnson
Brevard High School, Brevard, NC

This experiment was designed to address the hypothesis “Anti Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis bacterial symbionts are found on the epidermal tissue of the Aneides aeneus.” B. dendrobatidis affects many amphibian populations and has been known to cause decline in some frog populations. Some salamanders like the endangered green salamander (Aneides aeneus) have tested positive for B. dendrobatidis but show no signs of infection. For this reason, it is hypothesized that there may be inhibitory bacterial symbionts located on the epidermal tissue of the individual salamanders. Looking at inhibitory bacteria and other methods of protection could explain the way certain amphibians experience population decline while others are resistant to infection. To examine the hypothesis, four green salamanders were swabbed on their left, right, and ventral surfaces. The swabs were streaked onto separate plates which were grown up over 48 hours. Isolates were then transferred to separate plates. Cell free medium from each isolate was obtained using centrifugation and filtration. The CFM was then added to a flask with B. dendrobatidis zoospores, pen-strep, and nutrient broth. A control flask was set-up with just nutrient broth and zoospores. Six isolates were found to be inhibitory. The DNA was extracted from these isolates and was amplified using PCR. The cleaned samples were sent to a facility for nucleotide base sequencing. The resulting sequences were entered into Genbank BLAST. All identified bacterial isolates belonged to the genus Pseudomonas. Examining these inhibitory bacteria is important in looking for a solution to the current issue of amphibian population decline.

CELL JAMMING: THE HYDROLYZATION OF DENTAL SEALANTS DURING BIOFILM DEVELOPMENT AND INHIBITION OF QUORUM SENSING BY ESCULENT SPICES
Azad Sunil Dhingra
Springfield High School, Springfield, OH

The Streptococcal bacterial strain is one of the early colonizers of the occlusal surface, and its growth and metabolism often results in the formation of dental plaque. By determining whether this strain can hydrolyze dental sealants and if specific spices can obstruct biofilm development, it can be concluded as to what products reduce plaque and therefore preclude cavities in the human oral flora. The problem was hence formulated: Does Streptococcus mutans or S. salivarius hydrolyze dental sealants as a carbon source during biofilm formation? Based on the findings, can esculent spices then inhibit quorum sensing and thus biofilm development in the aforementioned S. mutans? <br><br> A series of thorough and intricate methods were then utilized to obtain and collect data: Formation of dental sealant carriers, preparation of isolates for attachment and biofilm investigation, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, anticipation of esculent spices, formulation of spice extracts, preparation of bacterial cultures, and finally, determination of antibiofilm activity. The acquired results revealed that both Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175 and mutans UA159 failed to utilize the Delton dental sealants as a primary carbon source. Nevertheless, the results of the study still show potential antibiofilm activity for some of the spices used, as they were able to inhibit the initial stage of biofilm formation and subsequent growth. This success of inhibiting cell attachment is a promising tool for reducing microbial colonization on occlusal surfaces and dental sealants alike; with further isolation and identification of the constituents that exhibit antibiofilm properties, it will be possible to include these alternatives in the control of biofilms.

DETERMINING THE ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVE INGREDIENT OF THE OREGANO ESSENTIAL OIL
Emily Galan Murphy
Nicolet High School, Glendale, WI

Previous experimentation has shown that oregano essential oil kills Streptococcus pneumoniae. The purpose of this year’s project is to find the active ingredient of oregano oil, analyze how its antibacterial properties work, and see if its effectiveness can rival that of penicillin’s. In order to discover how this oil worked, the active ingredient must be found. Components were chosen through research to find the most probable active ingredient. The components chosen were Carvacrol, Lynalyl Acetate, Terpinen-4-ol, p-Cymene. alpha-Pinene, beta-Pinene, Linalol, and Myrcene. Streptococcus pneumoniae was inoculated onto blood agar plates and filter disks were placed on top. These disks were inoculated with 10 µl of one of four dilutions for each component of oregano oil. Dilutions were created using almond oil as a carrier oil. Almond oil was used because it has no antibacterial effect on bacteria and all components diffused within it. The dilutions had ratios of 1:0, 1:1, 1:10, and 1:100. The results showed that three individual components showed excellent antibacterial properties. These components were Carvacrol, Terpinen-4-ol, and Linalol. On average, all three components inhibited growth as well or better than penicillin at the 1:0 and 1:1 ratios. Pure Carvacrol was the most effective with an average zone of inhibition of 37.67mm followed by pure Terpinen-4-ol with an average of 33.33mm and pure Linalol with an average of 32.6mm. Penicillin only had an average zone of inhibition of 17.5mm. These results could be used to create an alternative to penicillin.

IRRADIATION EXTERMINATION, PART THREE: A PORTABLE SYSTEM TO ELIMINATE WATERBORNE MICROORGANISMS
Kelli Ann Lynch
Rocky Mountain High School, Fort Collins, CO

Upon learning that 1.4 million people die each year from a lack of clean drinking water and sanitation, I set about trying to find a way to help. This year, I developed the final prototype and sought answers to: Does Prototype #4 work? What exposure time is needed to purify a solution of E. coli and B. subtilis? How does dirt affect the efficiency of the purifier?<br><br>I tested the effectiveness of Prototype #4 by putting controlled samples of E. coli and B. subtilis and 4.2 liters of tap water into the purifier. Samples were taken from the spigot at specified time points. For the experiments that tested the effect of dirt, 30 grams of calibrated dirt was added to the water prior to introducing the bacteria. All samples were diluted and colonies were counted.<br><br>The results showed that the new prototype is more effective than previous designs. Further, the data suggest that both E. coli and B. subtilis can be eliminated using Prototype 4. Unfortunately, dirt greatly affects the purification rate.<br><br>The next step is to build a sand filter, which will remove particulates prior to the water going into the purification chamber with the ultraviolet light. Once filtration is added, the purifier will be able to clean 4.2 liters of water in approximately 20 minutes using a 30-watt solar panel. The efficiency and low cost of the Prototype #4 makes it a practical and sustainable solution for providing families in impoverished countries with clean drinking water.

VIRULENCE ASSOCIATED TRAITS OF UROPATHOGENIC E. COLI CAUSING PYELONEPHRITIS IN CHILDREN
Jingwen Zhang
Thomas Worthington High School, Worthington, OH

The project’s purpose was to determine if virulence traits of uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) bacteria, which cause urinary tract infections (UTIs), are related to a child’s likelihood to contract pyelonephritis. UPEC bacteria cause either pyelonephritis, urinary infection in the kidneys, or cystitis, infection in the bladder. The recurrence rate of UTIs are high and it is currently impossible to predict if the recurrent infection will be pyelonephritis or cystitis. Though only some patients develop recurring pyelonephritis, all patients are treated rigorously for years against the possibility of pyelonephritis. In this project, the virulence trait of filamentation, in which bacteria grows into a long, threadlike shape, was tested in UPEC bacteria for correlation between filamentation and pyelonephritis. Strains of UPEC bacteria were cultured with murine RAW macrophage-like cells. Lengths of bacteria in the culture were determined by flow cytometry. Using flow cytometry program FlowJo, bacteria in each culture were grouped as normal (bacillary) or filamentous, and percentages of normal and filamentous bacteria were found for each sample. Information regarding the severity of the strain (whether the patient contracted cystitis or pyelonephritis) was then obtained. Results showed that the ratio of UPEC filamentation rates in pyelonephritis and in cystitis was 2.84:2.10, or 135%. There is a correlation between filamentation and contraction of pyelonephritis. This correlation is a definite factor that will aid in finding a diagnostic method to predict if the recurrent UTI is likely to be pyelonephritis or cystitis. If that information is obtained, rigorous treatment against pyelonephritis can be reserved for only the children at risk of developing recurrent pyelonephritis.

DOES EPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS PLAY A ROLE IN THE EPIDEMIC OF HUMAN PAPILLOMA VIRUS ASSOCIATED HEAD AND NECK CANCERS?
Sean Jeffrey Nathan
Caddo Parish Magnet High School, Shreveport, LA

There has been an alarming epidemic of Human Papilloma virus (HPV) associated head and neck carcinomas of the oral cavity. Although the entire oral cavity is exposed to HPV, these tumors are only noted in the tonsil and base of tongue (BOT), composed of lymphoid tissue where Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) virus can reside. Hence, we hypothesized that it is the co-infection of EBV with HPV and not HPV alone that is associated with malignant transformation of these tumors. Predictive biomarkers CD21 and CK19 were studied. Previously extracted by a surgeon, tonsil and BOT samples from cancer and non cancer patients were analyzed with Real time-PCR for EBV, CD21 and CK19 after laser capture microdissection (LCM) and for HPV with in situ hybridization. Invasion and proliferation assays determined whether co-infected cells had increased tumorogenicity. SCC BOT samples showed a significantly increased rate of co-infection of 81.8% (p=0.0001). In vitro studies showed a significant 3-fold increase in invasiveness (p<0.01) and significant increase in proliferation (p<.05) in co-infected cell line. Significantly higher levels of CK19 were found in co-infected patient samples (p<0.001). This is the first study showing co-infection in BOT cancer, increased tumorigenic potential of the co-infected cells and the potential of CK19 to be a predictive biomarker.

HOW INTRASPECIES AND INTERSPECIES SIGNALING AFFECT BACTERIAL RESPONSES TO ANTIBIOTICS
Sajal Kumar Tiwary
Clinton High School, Clinton, MS

Developing effective antibiotics to fight bacterial infections has always been a challenging task for the scientific community. One of the major obstacles in the research process is caused by the unique behaviors of microbes which keep changing in different environments. The purpose of this project was to study the bacterial intraspecies and interspecies signaling in response to certain antibiotics. According to the hypothesis, some species of bacteria may show discrepancies when they are exposed to antibiotics in a mixed culture vs. pure cultures. This discrepancy may be due to intraspecies and interspecies signaling among bacteria. To test the hypothesis, Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test was performed on some common opportunisitic and pathogenic bacteria. Several microbial samples from biofilms were collected from different places. The bacterial colonies were isolated and identified by various laboratory tests and techniques. Also, ATCC bacterial cultures were used in the experiment to compare with the results of bacteria collected from the natural biofilms.<br><br> Out of eight antibiotics initially used in the experiment, only four (penicillin, azithromycin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline) gave significant results. Using these antibiotics, about 80% of the test results of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were very unique and remarkable with regard to mixed vs. isolate. Some other bacterial species also responded differently to certain antibiotics in the same respect. All results supported the hypothesis that bacterial species respond differently to the antimicrobial agents in mixed cultures when compared to the pure cultures, and vice versa. This intriguing behavior may be attributed to intraspecies and interspecies signaling among bacteria.

BACTERIOPHAGES VS. ANTIBIOTICS: THE EFFECTS OF BACTERIOPHAGE THERAPY, ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT, AND THEIR SYNERGISM ON ESCHERICHIA COLI
Matthew Colton Estes
Seneca High School, Seneca, MO

The purpose of my project was to determine if bacteriophage therapy or antibiotic treatment was a more effective inhibitor of bacterial growth and to determine the effects of antibiotic/bacteriophage synergism on Escherichia coli. My hypothesis was that bacteriophages would be a better microbial inhibitor than antibiotics and that antibiotics and bacteriophages used synergistically would be a more effective inhibitor of bacterial growth than antibiotics alone. Antibiotic resistance is a huge problem in hospitals all around the country. Simply put, antibiotics are no longer very effective. As a result, I experimented with bacteriphages, natural predators of bacteria, to see if they are more or less effective than antibiotics alone. My research yielded mixed results. Some bacteriophage concentrations were much more effective than antibiotics. Also, the bacteriophage/antibiotic synergism was, for the most part, more successful than just antibiotics alone.

EFFECTS OF GREEN AND BLACK TEA ON THE GROWTH AND VIABILITY OF BACILLUS ANTHRACIS
Shane David Falcinelli
Middletown High School, Middletown, MD

This study determines the effects of green and black tea on the growth and viability of Bacillus anthracis. The growth and viability of bacilli over a period of time were determined by (1) optical density measurements to generate growth curves, (2) counts of bacterial colony forming units (CFU), and (3) a fluorescence microscopy based assay to differentiate between live and dead bacilli. In Luria Broth (LB), the exponential growth of B. anthracis was inhibited by green and, to a lesser extent, by black tea. In Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth supplemented with Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and sodium bicarbonate, a medium used to grow short bacilli chains, the growth of B. anthracis was also inhibited by green tea, albeit less killing of the bacilli was observed. Reduced killing was due to the presence of albumin in serum because adding albumin alone reproduced the reduced killing observed with FBS. FBS is known to inactivate tea catechins, the molecules thought to be responsible for much of green tea’s beneficial properties. The most abundant catechin in green tea, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), has been shown to inhibit activity of bacterial products, to protect host cells, and is found in blood plasma after consumption of green tea. Therefore, the effects of EGCG were also examined. In conclusion, green tea inhibits B. anthracis growth and contributes to its killing. Drinking green tea or administration of EGCG may serve as a prophylactic measure in the event of anthrax biological warfare attacks.

MICROBIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF BACTERIA PRESENT IN OBJECTS AT THE REACH OF OUR FINGERTIPS
Lyneiza Emine Collazo
Jose Rojas Cortes, Orocovis, PUERTO RICO

The problem under study was: What type of material for door handles will better inhibits bacterial growth? The purpose was to investigate which material is better to inhibit the growth of bacteria. The hypothesis under study was that a door handle made out of bronze will inhibit bacterial growth and therefore it will have less growth of bacterial colonies. To do the investigation three different door handles were chosen. Each door handle is made out of a different material; aluminum, stainless steel and bronze. Samples were taken from an area of 16 cm of each door handle using a transport swab. The samples from each door handle were inoculated into a Blood Agar plate and into a Mac Conkey Agar plate. Then these were incubated between 35-37 Celsius degrees for a period of 48 hours. After that, the data was collected by performing a colony count and an identification of bacteria from each type of material door handle. It was found that the aluminum made door handle had the largest bacteria colony count identified as E-coli and Streptococcus. The stainless steel door handle had the second position on the number of bacteria colonies that grew and those were all E-coli. On the bronze door handle grew only one colony identified as Mycoplasma. From the results analysis of the three types of door handle materials it can be concluded that the handle made out of bronze is the best material that inhibits bacterial growth, therefore the hypothesis was accepted.

ISOLATION, PURIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF MYCOBACTERIOPHAGES OBTAINED FROM THE SOIL AND WATER OF RIVERS IN THE PUERTO RICAN TOWNS OF COMERÍO, MAYAGUEZ, PONCE, RÍO GRANDE AND VEGA BAJA
Kiara Rivera
Superior Juana Colon, Comerio, PUERTO RICO

The principal objective of the investigation was to isolate mycobacteriophages obtained from river soil and water samples. The hypothesis was that more mycobacteriophages will be found in soil samples than in water samples from rivers in the Puerto Rican towns of Comerío, Mayagüez, Ponce, Río Grande and Vega Baja; and more bacteriophages will be found in the town of Río Grande than in the other towns. In this investigation the host cell will be Mycobacterium smegmatis, an environmental non pathogenic microorganism. The selection of the towns was done according to their geographic location. After collecting the 30 samples, the methodology was followed. The analysis began with the isolation and with the enrichment technique. Then, the dilutions were performed infecting the bacterium if any phage was found. The next step was the purification and the empirical test of the samples to produce the infection of the 10 plates and the recollection of the phage lysate. Finally the DNA was obtained and the concentration was measured. Of all the samples analyzed a phage was only found in the soil from Mayagüez and in the river water from Río Grande. The complete research was only done with the mycobacteriophage in the soil sample. The size of the viral plaques of the mycobacteriophage from the water were too small, and it was not possible to characterize and purify them. The obtained sample of DNA was sent to a center of sequencing to obtain the phage genome.

COMPARATIVE STUDY ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DIFFERENT METHODS OF STERILIZATION AND A METHOD OF DISINFECTION IN THE ELIMINATION OF THE NORMAL FLORA FOUND IN ODONTOLOGICAL INSTRUMENTS USED IN THE HUMAN ORAL CAVITY
Kevin Manuel Rodriguez-Santos
Escuela Especializada en Ciencias y Matemáticas University Gardens, San Juan, PUERTO RICO

When odontological offices are visited people expose themselves to microorganisms such as: HIV, Hepatitis, Tuberculosis and Influenza. The objective of this project was to realize a comparative study between the methods of sterilization/disinfection commonly used for dental instruments. The hypothesis is that the sterilization/disinfection methods used in the dental institution are adequate and the humid heat sterilization is more effective to eliminate microorganisms. It is important to emphasize that the most frequently used methods for sterilization are humid heat, dry heat and for disinfection, is glutaraldehyde. Forty-eight (48) dental instruments, recently used in patients, were identified to realize microbiological tests. Two areas of each instrument, the handle and the active area, were used for sampling. Using a sterile hyssop, a sample was taken from each area (one hyssop per area). The hyssop was scrubbed through plates of Agar TSI identified according to the sample. Then the instruments were passed through sterilization/disinfection and re-sampled in the same order of the previous sampling. The plates were cultivated to 37ºC during 4 days. The microbial colonies were counted (CFU). This was done to make an appraisal of the sterilization/disinfection treatments used in these instruments. Results revealed that none of the treatments prevented in 100% the microbial growth. There were major microbiological growths in the plates of instruments treated with humid heat. The instruments treated with glutaraldehyde revealed the smaller number of CFU after incubation. The results of this preliminary study will help to propose better practices so that sterilization/disinfection methods are more effective.

THE EFFECT OF AMMONIA SIGNALING ON THE COLONY MORPHOLOGY OF YEAST THROUGH DEXTROSE STARVATION
Mark Alan Kirollos
North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, Durham, NC

Saccharomyces cerevisiae is often classified as a unicellular organism, however, this species displays complex behavior such as cellular differentiation and cell signaling often associated with multicellular organisms. Carbon limitation in media causes yeast colonies to form complex morphology, believed to be an adaptation for surviving stressful conditions. Ammonia signaling has been shown to synchronize complexity in yeast colonies alongside other transcriptional changes triggered by carbon limitation that effect complex colony formation. By submitting yeast strains grown on high and low dextrose levels to varying levels of extracellular ammonia, the effect of each treatment on variation in complexity and colony size could be determined. Increasing ammonia exposure time decreased the strength of morphology in certain strains and promoted growth, contrary to prior published finding. Ammonia levels also affected colony diameter in some strains, causing colonies to become larger as ammonia exposure time increased. These findings may further the treatment of pathogenic biofilms by identifying potential pathways that effect the growth and transcriptional changes that increase survivability of fungal diseases.

COMPARISION OF THE TRANSFORMATION EFFICIENCY OF COMMON STRAINS VS. ENVIRONMENTAL WILD STRAINS OF E. COLI USING HEAT SHOCK AND ELECTROPORATION
Jordan Lynn Putman
Lubbock-Cooper High School, Lubbock, TX

The purpose of conducting this research was to compare the transformation efficiency of two environmental wild strains of Escherichia coli vs. two common strains of E. coli using two methods of transformation: heat shock and electroporation. It is hypothesized that strains of E. coli isolated from environmental sources can be genetically transformed equally as well as laboratory strains of E. coli. In the previous year’s research, It was determined that increasing the temperature five degrees Celsius at which a common stain (k-12 HB101) of E. coli was transformed, the transformation efficiency was doubled. This year’s research focused on two common strains and two environmental wild strains of E. coli that were isolated from lake water. To transform the E. coli cells two methods of transformation were used: heat shock and electroporation. A plasmid DNA called pGLO was used in this transformation. This experiment was achieved by culturing the newly transformed E. coli on LB agar mixed with Arabinose and Ampicillin. After this experiment was completed, it was determined that heat shocking the bacteria at 47 degrees Celsius resulted in higher transformation efficiency than 42 degrees Celsius, but the heat shocking method is limited to common strains of E. coli. The electroporation method was successful in transforming all four strains of E. coli. The hypothesis was incorrect; transformation efficiency differs between isolated wild strains and common strains of E. coli possibly due to differences in cell wall or membrane integrity or defense mechanisms.

CREATION OF ALGINATE MICROPARTICLES AS A NOVEL DRUG DELIVERY VEHICLE
Melissa Rachel Fagan
San Diego Jewish Academy, San Diego, CA

Bacterial resistance is a growing issue in the modern world. Silver is an antimicrobial that does not have the same issues with resistance associated with antibiotics. The success of silver depends upon a dose that maximizes antimicrobial activity but minimizes toxicity. Therefore alginate microparticles, encapsulating silver antiseptics, were engineered through emulsification and internal gelation with the objective of minimizing the downsides of rapid silver deactivation and toxicity.<br><br>Microparticles were synthesized with and without the encapsulation of silver sulfadiazine (SSD) and tested for their ability to inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis, a substitute for the pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus. Research was also conducted to determine stability, size and density of the microparticles. <br><br>Results demonstrated that the alginate microparticles had an average size of between 1-10µm and were stable with regard to density, particle size and appearance. Antimicrobial testing at 24 and 48 hours showed that alginate microparticles containing SSD produced significantly increased antimicrobial activity when compared to alginate microparticles alone (p<0.001). Results demonstrated a significant increase in the zone of inhibition of alginate microparticles containing SSD from 24 to 48 hours (p<0.05 vs. SSD alone). The release continued through 96 hours (p<0.001 vs. SSD alone), illustrating the ability of alginate to provide a continual release of encapsulated agents.<br><br>Further experiments were conducted to investigate release of SSD from alginate microparticles. Pre-treatment with alginate-lyase showed a decrease in anti-microbial activity from 24 to 48 hours, suggesting that alginate lyase breaks down the microparticles causing immediate release of SSD (p<0.05).

CO-INOCULATION OF S. ONEIDENSIS AND G. SULFURREDUCENS FOR NOVEL MICROBIAL FUEL CELL ENHANCEMENT
Sruti Arulmani
Glenforest Secondary School, Mississauga, Ontario, CANADA

The consumption of fossil fuels at unrelenting rates signifies the commercial and economic viability of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) as a renewable energy source. MFCs induce current through bioelectrochemical reactions in which organotrophic anaerobic microorganisms metabolize an organic carboxylic acid through anaerobic respiration in the trycarboxylic acid cycle. With the thermodynamic and biological constraints in bioelectrochemical systems, this study focuses on a novel concept of increasing the efficiency of MFCs through the co-inoculation of Shewenella oneidensis (sp.MR-1) and Geobacter sulfurreducens. In this research, enhancements were attained through the reduction of lactate fuel to a flavin mediator by the S.oneidensis. The flavin mediator functions as an electron shuttle to increase the efficiency of the electron transfer in MFCs. The main kinetic constraint in which MFC efficiencies are compromised is not in the bacterial interactions, but rather the electron transfer without the presence of an externally supplemented mediator. The novel concept of co-inoculating two microorganisms in order to sustain a mutually supportive biological system was evaluated by bioelectrochemical characterization in which potentiodynamic polarizations, resistance modulation, power curves and electrical potential evolution were employed for analysis. Efficiencies greater than that of Shewenella monoculture MFCs were obtained through the co-inoculated cell of S.oneidensis and G.sulfurreducens in the electrical potential evolution. Ultimately, a significant enhancement in the extracellular electron transfer and overall power output was observed. These remarkable efficiency gains demonstrate the future feasibility of MFCs as a green bioelectrochemical energy source.

CAN HALOARCHAEA REPLACE POTASSIUM FOR CESIUM?
Ha Young Shin
Governor's School @ Innovation Park, Manassas, VA

This experiment was conducted in order to see if haloarchaea could replace potassium for cesium. Haloarchaea are extremophiles that thrive in saline environments, and they often use potassium as their intracellular ion for their regulation of salt and water content in and out of their cells, also known as the potassium-sodium pump. Because cesium has similar chemical properties as potassium, the experiment investigated whether haloarchaea could utilize cesium instead of potassium to regulate the salt and water content. In the first part of the experiment, potassium-free nutrient media containing cesium was made for the haloarchaea in 25% NaCl in distilled water. The media was autoclaved and the five species of haloarchaea were inoculated: Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1, Halorubrum californiense, Haloarcula turkmenica, Halorubrum saccharovorum, Haloarcula marismortui. After inoculation, the growth of the species of haloarchaea was measured by using a spectrometer. It was found that four out of five species of haloarchaea could grow on cesium. Due to a research indicating haloarchaea’s ability to store up to 5 M of potassium inside of their cells, the experiment was repeated to ensure these haloarchaea were not growing by using the stored potassium inside of their cells. The cultures were then centrifuged and were made into cell pellets, which were then washed with NaCl three times and were sent to the lab for X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. <br><br>This experiment gives the implication that if haloarchaea were to be placed in an environment devoid of necessary elements or compounds, they could adapt and substitute the needed compounds with chemically similar ones. This could possibly lead to the evolution of the haloarchaea species or even the environment.

BACTERIAL BIOFILMS ARE INFLUENCED BY BETA-LACTAM ANTIBIOTICS
Kathleen Rose Maguire
Marlborough School, Los Angeles, CA

Biofilms are multi-cellular microbial communities composed of microorganisms and extracellular products attached to a surface. Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a biofilm forming bacterium that can cause otitis media, a middle ear infection. Beta-lactam antibiotics, which combat bacterial infections by inhibiting the synthesis of the cell wall, are often used to combat otitis media. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of beta-lactam antibiotics on NTHi biofilm formation. Although beta-lactam antibiotics are known to be bactericidal, it was hypothesized that antibiotics may not kill all biofilm bacteria and that specific sub-lethal concentrations may enhance biofilm growth.

HUMAN HEMOGLOBIN POLYMORPHISMS AFFECT RECOGNITION BY S. AUREUS RECEPTOR ISDB
Jiahe Gu
Martin Luther King, Jr. Magnet High School, Nashville, TN

Iron is an essential nutrient for the survival of Staphylococcus aureus. During infection, the body sequesters iron as a method of nutritional immunity. However, S. aureus can utilize the protein IsdB to bind hemoglobin, from which iron can then be extracted and metabolized. In the human population, there are over a thousand characterized polymorphisms of hemoglobin. It was unknown whether these natural variants are bound differently by IsdB. Eight naturally occurring mutations were selected for their proximity to sites previously identified to be recognized by another S. aureus surface protein, IsdH. The levels of interaction between IsdB and these hemoglobin variants were measured using the bacterial adenylate cyclase two-hybrid system, which was optimized for this particular study. Experimentation identified five hemoglobin variants (aD6Y, aK7E, aK11Q, aD75Y, and aN78K) that demonstrated significantly lower recognition by IsdB. Of these variants, the first four are very rare. The aN78K variant is relatively more common, found in many populations of African origin. These results primarily demonstrate that natural hemoglobin variants can be bound differently by S. aureus receptor IsdB. Hemoglobin genotype, then, is a potentially important factor to consider during treatment of infections. The possible need for individualized therapies is thus suggested.

THE UTILITY OF USTILAGO BULLATA TO CONTROL CHEATGRASS INVASIONS
Stacia Lynn Hill
Big Sky High School, Missoula, MT

Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) is an invasive species of grass found all throughout the intermountain west of the United States, and is controlled by the use of herbicides, tillage, or burning which is damaging to the surrounding environment. Cheatgrass populations exist on MPG Ranch which is conservation property in western Montana. Some populations of cheatgrass are infected with the fungi Ustilago bullata (commonly head smut) which prevents the development of seeds in cheatgrass. A better understanding of U. bullata and the relationship between the fungi and cheatgrass could lead to the utilization of U. bullata as a biological control agent for cheatgrass.<br><br>Some populations of cheatgrass on MPG Ranch are more heavily infected with U. bullata than others, which could be explained by differences in the fungal endophyte community of various cheatgrass populations. T-RFLP analysis was used to assess the fungal endophyte community of cheatgrass populations. Significant differences in endophyte communities have been found in cheatgrass samples from MPG Ranch.

IN VITRO STUDY OF THE EFFECT OF ARMORACIA RUSTICANA AS A BACTERIOSTATIC AGENT AGAINST STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS AND VARIOUS UNKNOWN BACTERIA FOUND ON SUSHI
Thomas Xavier Brown
Cookeville High School, Cookeville, TN

This research project is an in vitro study of the effect of Armoracia rusticana as a bacteriostatic agent against Staphylococcus aureus and various unknown bacteria found on sushi.<br><br> Bacteria was taken from sashimi samples and cultured on nutrient growth agars. Determinate tests were then done to identify what kinds of bacteria were present. This was done to find out, by first hand, the kinds of bacteria that are on sushi. The tests were a long process that yielded many results, leading me to believe bacteria Y-1 (Yellow tail) is Staphylococcus lutrae, T-3 (Tuna) is either S. auricularis or S. schleiferi subsp. schleiferi, T-4 (Tuna) could be Staphylococcus auricularis, S. hominis subsp. hominis, Macrococcus caseolyticus, or S. cohnii subsp. cohnii, S-2 (Salmon) is Staphylococcus hominis subsp. hominis, S-3 (Salmon) is Rahnella aquatilis, and S-4 (Salmon) is Enterobacter amnigenus.<br><br>After discovering what types of bacteria are on sushi, I began my wasabi assay to observe the effect of common wasabi, or Armoracia rusticana, on the bacteria I found, as well as bacteria said to be found on sushi. I was going to see if the compound effected gram negative rods different than gram positive cocci and so on with the various differences. The process included diluting both the Armoracia rusticana into a saline solution, and the bacteria into a TSA broth. Then a MIC was performed to test whether or not the wasabi kills bacteria.<br><br>The test was result was negative. Bacteria grew in all of the wells meaning the wasabi was ineffective. There were many limitations to my investigations that may account for my results.<br><br>In conclusion, wasabi is ineffective as an antibacterial agent or has a low bacterioasis.

CAN THE PROPERTIES OF A BIOFILM BE STUDIED USING IMPEDANCE MEASUREMENTS?
Kaylyn Christine Risse
Lake Central High School, Saint John, IN

When bacteria enter stationary phase, they enter a protective state. They change their metabolism to anaerobic in order to protect themselves from a lack of oxygen. They secrete polysaccharides and glycoproteins to form a biofilm, which are made to protect themselves from toxins, antibiotics, and other species of microorganisms. Biofilms can form in people because of complications in diseases; they can also form in equipment, tubing and pipes. The bacteria that I used was Vibrio harveyi, a biosafety level one marine bacteria. The purpose of this project is to see if the properties of a biofilm can be changed or studied using impedance measurements. Because the biofilms can behave like a capacitor, this allowed me to test the integrity of them. I found that a square wave signal, with a low-pulsed current, can go through the biofilm and that the exponential curve is due primarily to the biofilm. This curve made me wonder, and because of that I had to understand impedance. Impedance is the sum of the resistance due to a resistor plus the capacitive resistance, which is the reactance. Biofilms were my capacitor in this experiment, because they can sometimes behave like one. This technique is important because biofilms can form almost anywhere, and we need to be able to study their properties and find a way to inhibit them.

THE EFFECT OF NATURAL HERB EXTRACTS ON THE PRODUCTION OF DENGUE FEVER VIRUS IN CELL CULTURE
Jumana AbdulRahem Turkistani
Albayan Model School for Girls, Jeddah, Makkah Almukkarama, SAUDI ARABIA

The horrific flooding in Saudi Arabia in (2009) was the foundation of increasing Dengue Fever Virus (DFV) cases, especially in the city of Jeddah with 263 confirmed diagnoses. Worldwide deaths reached in (2007) to 22,000. This terrifying number should alarm researchers to focus on solutions to cease this disease from spreading. The WHO estimated that 80% of people worldwide rely on herbal medicines for a portion of their primary health care, and that was the aim of this project. To develop an effective herbal remedy that inhibits DFV without having a negative effect in cell culture. The effect of four kinds of natural herbs (FMS – ANS – MNS – RI-NS) was examined on DFV strain (DEN-1). First, (LLCMK-2) monkey kidney cells were prepared. Second, toxicity of the herbs was tested on cell culture using different dilutions. Third, Virus dilutions (10 fold dilution) were added to 24-well plate with media containing nontoxic herbs (positive control). Also, virus dilutions were added with media without herbs (negative control) to compare between them. This test was repeated three times at 10 minute duration. The results shows that the nontoxic herb dilutions were (1:40 FMS) – (1:40 MNS) – (1:10 ANS) - (1:10 RI-NS). PCR was used to amplify specific virus genes then confirm the results. This indicates that FMS herb has affected DFV by inhibiting its growth in cell culture when virus dilution =0.01 compared to virus dilution with media =0.001. Our result could lead to the development of a safe, cheap anti-viral compound to whoever needs it.

INVESTIGATING THE ROLE OF HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS IN LUNG CANCER
Justin Yat-Fung Wong
Germantown Acacdemy, Fort Washington, PA

Lung cancer is the worldwide leading cause of cancer-related mortality with over a million deaths a year. Although smoking has been attributed to a 90% higher risk of developing lung cancer, less than 20% of smokers actually develop cancer meanwhile lung cancer also causes a substantial amount of mortality in never-smokers. The DNA of HPV has been identified in tissues from a subset of lung tumors with prominent presence of HPV 16 and 18, which are most often associated with oncogenesis. When the circular DNA breaks at the E2 gene, the virus aborts the natural cycle therefore the cell will not undergo apoptosis. By integrating into the human genome, the DNA interferes with p53 causing cancer. For HPV to be deemed the causative agent in carcinogenesis in the lung, HPV DNA must be detected in tumor tissues, viral DNA must be integrated into the host genome, an active synthesis of those proteins must be confirmed, and the synthesized proteins must significantly disrupt the cell’s functions. This study will conduct a pooled analysis from the literature on the detection of HPV in lung cancer tumors to determine possible prevalence correlations among demographics. The analysis suggests no correlations other than age, which can be attributed to the compromising of the immune system associated with age. An ongoing extension of this study is being conducted to investigate the carcinogenic effects of HPV DNA integration.

THE EFFECT OF LACTOBACILLUS ACIDOPHILUS ON THE SURVIVAL AND MOTILITY OF CAENORHABDITIS ELEGANS AGAINST PATHOGENIC SERRATIA MARCESCENS
Ananya Sureshkumar
Biotechnology High School, Freehold, NJ

Probiotic bacteria are used in the production of dairy products. Live strains are incorporated for human consumption because they are thought to colonize the human gut and out-colonize pathogenic bacteria. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the gut-colonizing probiotic strain Lactobacillus acidophilus on C. elegans as the nematodes were exposed to a gut-colonizing pathogen S. marcescens. <br><br>Two C. elegans were placed onto each plate. Twelve positive control plates were grown with E. coli OP50, standard laboratory nourishment. Twelve negative control plates contained worms with S. marcescens, a pathogen. Twelve plates contained worms and a bacterial lawn with E. coli and S. marcescens to ascertain effects of non-probiotic strains against pathogenic bacteria. The final twelve plates contained L. acidophilus and S. marcescens to observe the effects of a probiotic against a pathogen in the nematodes. The worms were plated using a worm pick. Afterward, 80 microliters of broth containing the corresponding bacteria was placed onto the plates. With plates containing two bacterial strains, 40 microliters of each one was plated. The results were observed after 6 days.<br><br>Reproduction rates were observed by counting the amount of worms per 3 mm2 and multiplying by 75.66 to ascertain how many worms covered the entire plate. Motility was observed by looking at the number of head twitches in 10 seconds. The E. coli OP50 yielded the highest number of worms. The L. acidophilus with the pathogen yielded the next highest number of worms, and the highest motility recordings.

THIRD WORLD METHODS OF FILTERING E. COLI BACTERIA FROM DRINKING WATER
Kellie Elizabeth French
Windsor High School, Windsor, VT

Every 20 seconds a child in a third world country dies of a preventable, water borne disease. A third world country is characterized by a nations lack of advanced sanitation for the majority of its population. In the United States we enjoy the luxury of turning on the faucet and expecting clean, cool, and clear water to flow. Clear water can be misleading though because bacteria can hide in crystal clear water. In my experiment I used cloth filtration, boiling and adding iodine to test which method would best kill E. coli bacteria. Using the labs at a local nanotechnology startup company, I made "dirty" water and after using a filtration method, I grew the samples in Petri dishes. At the conclusion of many trials I determined that boiling water most efficiently eliminates the bacteria from water. This is an accessible solution to many people living with out advanced sanitation and it has the potential to save many lives. Because the method of boiling was both simple and efficient I wondered why people worldwide are still dying from these diseases. It led me to question whether education of the microscopic world affected the likelihood of a person dying of one of the many waterborne diseases.

RE-EVALUATION OF FUZEON, THE FIRST PEPTIDE ANTI-HIV DRUG, REVEALS A NOVEL MECHANISM OF ACTION
Tongzhu Xu
The Bronx High School of Science, Bronx, NY

This paper describes a previously undiscovered and novel two-step mechanism of action for Fuzeon (enfuvirtide, T20). T20 is the first FDA-approved peptide anti-HIV drug targeting the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp41. T20 was initially proposed to inhibit HIV fusion with the target cell by blocking formation of the six-helix bundle (6HB) core between the N- and C-terminal heptad repeats (NHR and CHR) in gp41. Subsequent studies indicated that T20 does not inhibit 6HB formation, raising controversy about the true mechanism of action. In this study, a monoclonal antibody specific to only 6HB was used to determine the interaction of T20 with the gp41 NHR domain at different stages of 6HB formation and viral envelope-cell fusion in cell-based systems. The results demonstrated that T20 inhibits 6HB formation in the early fusion stage. However, as time progresses, 6HB inhibitory effect decreases concomitant with increased T20 interaction with a different region of gp41, likely the fusion peptide (FP) region. Taken together, these results suggest a model in which T20 inhibits viral envelope-cell fusion in two distinct steps: (1) interaction with the NHR to block 6HB formation at the early stage and (2) binding to the FP to suppress FP-mediated membrane fusion at the late stage. Therefore, this study elucidates the mechanism of action of T20 as being a two-step process. This provides a paradigm for new strategies upon which to base design and development of novel and more effective HIV inhibitors.

A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY OF DIFFERENT SPICES ON THE SHELF-LIFE OF AN EMERGENCY FOOD PRODUCT
Sarah Ariyan Sakha
Xavier College Preparatory, Phoenix, AZ

The international community faces an increasing number of humanitarian emergencies that necessitate various means of aid, particularly food relief assistance in the form of ready-to-eat compact foods – Emergency Food Products (EFPs). EFPs are designed to be culturally acceptable, edible and palatable, energy and nutrient dense, easy-to-open, deliverable within forty-eight hours, and consumable within fifteen days. Each EFP should consist of 500 calories with 8 grams total fat, 100 grams of carbohydrates, and 17.5 grams of protein. This experiment compared the antimicrobial activity of Cinnamomum zeylanicum (cinnamon), Cardamomum (cardamom), and Pimenta dioica (allspice) in relation to the shelf-life of a potential alternative EFP, which used lentil rice as the base food product and was designed to meet EFP standards. Cinnamon was hypothesized to yield the greatest antimicrobial activity, based on past studies that recorded its substantial antibacterial activity against several strains. Twenty 5-gram specimens from each of the four subgroups – cinnamon, cardamom, allspice, and a control group untreated with spices – were vacuum-packed and stored at room temperature. Over the course of six weeks, samples were tested for bacterial growth at days 1, 5, 10, 21, and 42 by diluting the samples with phosphate buffer, plating the samples, and counting and identifying bacteria colonies. Petri dishes with few bacteria colonies indicated enhanced antimicrobial activity. Results obtained supported the hypothesis: the food product prepared with cinnamon yielded the longest shelf-life. The application of these results to the real world carry wider social, political, and economic implications concerning potentially marketable alternatives to EFPs.

A UNIQUE APPROACH IN DNA BASED IDENTIFICATION OF AIRBORNE FUNGAL SPECIES
Ryan Hsu
Davis Senior High School, Davis, CA

Fungal allergies can cause a range of illnesses in humans. Current studies on fungal allergies have primarily focused on limited groups of fungi. Data on airborne fungal ascospore related allergies are virtually non-existent due to the lack of a viable method for collection and culturing. My goal is to identify and document airborne fungi present in the Sacramento area by a combination of a new method of collection, culturing, and identification.<br><br>Using an Ionic Spore Trap, airborne spores were collected in the Fall and Winter months when ascospores are most abundant. Ascospores were selected under microscope and cultured in potato dextrose agar. DNA were prepared from well isolated individual colonies of sizable mycelium. The nucleotide sequences of the fungal 18S rRNA gene were determined by Polymerase Chain Reaction and nucleotide sequencing. The identity of each fungus was determined by matching the nucleotide sequences with the GenBank database.<br><br>This project demonstrated an effective method of obtaining viable fungal cultures from airborne ascospores, which had not been previously achievable. Six airborne fungi species were identified in the Sacramento Area. This experimental design can be applied to establish a detailed database of airborne fungal spores in virtually any geographical location. A parallel study in our group has demonstrated that one of the ascospore cultures are immunoreactive with sera samples from patients with fungal allergies. Future studies will identify these potential fungal allergens at the molecular level and improve medical therapies.

ANTIBIOTIC CONCENTRATION AND BACTERIAL RESISTANCE: A STUDY USING AMPICILLIN AND ESCHERICHIA COLI
Joshua Cyril Abreo
Liberty Middle School, Madison, AL

This study determines the effect different concentrations of ampicillin have on the antibiotic resistance property of E. coli. The hypothesis was that E. coli gains more resistance to ampicillin when exposed to higher concentrations of the antibiotic.<br><br>Each Petri dish was inoculated with E. coli, and a paper disk, containing a predetermined concentration of ampicillin was placed in the middle, in accordance with the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion protocol. After the bacteria had grown, the inhibition zone was measured, and the next set of Petri dishes was applied with the surviving bacteria. This procedure was repeated three times to observe the change in inhibition zones. <br><br>At the conclusion of the tests, it was observed that E. coli became more resistant to all ampicillin concentrations, as evidenced by the decrease in inhibition zone size. However, the decrease in the inhibition zone was not uniform across all antibiotic concentrations. For example, the 100 µg/ml ampicillin concentration yielded a 55.6% decrease while the 1000 µg/ml yielded a 33.3% decrease. <br><br>The conclusion one can draw is that when E. coli is exposed to lower concentrations of ampicillin, it builds up resistance faster than when exposed to higher concentrations. This finding has valuable applications: to avoid producing a drug resistant form of the bacteria it is important to treat and kill the bacteria the first time with the proper dose of antibiotic. Another application is that when, given an antibiotic, one must take the entire dose, on time, in order for the drug to be effective.

IMMUNOMODULATORY HOST DEFENSE PEPTIDES AS NOVEL ANTI-INFECTIVES
Christina Andersen Resende de Paiva
Nordsjaellands Grundskole og Gymnasium, Horsholm, DENMARK

This project has explored the future possibility of using immunomodulatory host defense peptides as novel anti-infectives. <br><br>The aim of this project was to explore the mode of action of host defense peptides and assess their medical application as an alternative to antibiotics. The immunomodulatory activities of peptides are of particular interest since they show significant promise and may lead to the development of peptides with enhanced anti-infective properties. <br><br>The laboratory experiments have demonstrated some of the initial processes that have been done in the search for new peptides with new properties that can serve as templates for the development of novel anti-infectives – this involved enzyme assays, PCR, gel electrophoresis, sequencing and determination of evolutionary relatedness. The tests were done on samples collected from hot springs in South Greenland and the bacteria were shown to be Aeromonas veronii. <br><br>Synthetic immunomodulatory peptides have shown significant potential as anti-infective therapeutics. It might be possible to tailor the design of the peptides for different purposes. Most importantly is the ability to alter the normal balance between protective innate immune responses, such as chemokine production and leukocyte recruitment, which provides a unique opportunity to assist in innate immune protection against pathogens. Finally, because the primary target of an immunomodulatory treatment is the host and the effects on the pathogen are exerted indirectly through an enhancement of the immune response, it is unlikely that these therapies will result in the development of microbial resistance.

CLONING OF CORONAVIRUS NONSTRUCTURAL PROTEIN NSP15 FOR EXPRESSION IN MAMMALIAN CELLS
Nathanael Yongxiang Ji
Little Rock Central High School, Little Rock, AR

Coronovirus MHV non structural protein (nsp) 15 was truncated and cloned to help identify the function of regions in nsp15’s genetic sequence through bonding with EGFP and examining its expression. Coronavirus NSP15 DNA was truncated at the N-terminus at lengths of 100 base pairs, 150 base pairs, and 200 base pairs, and these were compared with full-length NSP15 and EGFP. The DNA was cloned through polymerase chain reaction into EGFP vector for expression in 293T mammalian cells. Gel electrophoresis was constantly used to check that DNA had been prepared correctly. A spectrophotometer was utilized to ensure that DNA was distributed evenly throughout the mammalian cells. Results were analyzed by fluorescent and normal light imaging quantification. To determine the outcome of the experiment, the percentage of fluorescent and circular cells were calculated. The fluorescent rate represented the DNA’s rate of transfection and activity. Circular cells represented those that were dying and had detached from the underlying surface. All data was checked for statistical significance through Z scores and normal distribution. F200 showed a substantially lower fluorescence rate, indicating that there is a region between F150 and F200 that is critical to NSP15 activity and/or transfection. NSP15 was also shown to impair the activity of EGFP, as fluorescence brightness declined when plasmids of NSP15 and its derivatives were inserted. Additionally, NSP15 was shown to further impair the activity of EGFP since the percent of dying cells sharply increased when NSP15 or one of its truncations was inserted into the vector.

INCREASING ANTI-FUNGAL EFFECTIVENESS THROUGH GENE DISRUPTION AND MUTANT SELECTION STUDIES
Natasha Dawn Ceballos
The Good Hope School, Frederiksted, St. Croix, VIRGIN ISLANDS

Yeast infections are among the most frequent types of infections that occur in women. The purpose of this experiment was to generate mutants of Candida albicans that would allow scientists to better understand anti-fungal resistance in pathogenic strains of yeast. The multiple procedures included screening strains at random with the hope of finding resistant mutants as well as developing strains of yeast that had disrupted key genes in the sphingolipid pathway. The results showed that we were unable to generate mutants or find them through screening strains at random. The major conclusion in this project was that the occurrence of CRS-MIS mutants in nature is not as frequent as originally thought. Future research includes disrupting different genes in different lipid pathways, as well as screening more strains at random for resistance.

USING AVIAN ANTIBODIES IN AQUACULTURE TO COMBAT STREPTOCOCCUS INIAE AND STREPTOCOCCUS AGALACTIAE IN OREOCHROMIS
Samantha Kay Welu, Elijah Welu, 
Marshall High School, Marshall, MN

Fish farms across the nation struggle with bacterial infections resulting in millions of dollars in lost revenue. Our goal is to help reduce labor and costs with an avian antibody product that will combat two prominent bacterial strains. Our hypothesis is to create an immunogen to inject chickens with. We will be able to collect antibodies from their egg yolks and prove they will bind to Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus iniae through an ELISA test.<br><br> First, we streaked blood agar plates with some isolates and grew out the bacteria in a broth. Then we did a gram stain and a Vitek test. Next, we did an ELISA test to show that anti-Strep. suis would bind with out bacterial strains. We also showed this binding visually through an agglutination test. Then we created an immunogen to inject chickens, so their eggs would contain natural antibodies. We collected the eggs and ran an ELISA test on them to show the antibodies would bind to our bacterial strains. Finally, we did a fish food trial to show that the antibody will stay on the fish food in the water.<br><br> In conclusion, we were able to prove the avian antibodies would bind to Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus iniae through an ELISA test. After analyzing our fish food, we are conducting further research to test effective methods of coating the food with avian antibodies. Looking forward, we will be starting feed trials in tanks of tilapia.

EFFECT OF SALINITY ON THE GROWTH OF VIBRIO FISCHERI
Jamie Lynn Cicchella, Sara Johnson, Stacy Hebrock
North Marion High School, Citra, FL

In March of 2011, eleven people were diagnosed with a mild form of cholera caused by Vibrio cholera after eating raw oysters. This raised the question, “If the oysters were relocated to an area with a different salinity, would there be less bacterial growth in the water and in the oysters?” To test this, a salinity shift was created using Vibrio cholerae’s non-pathogenic cousin, Vibrio fischeri was used. <br><br>The hypothesis for this experiment was that there would be a negative correlation between the increase in salinity and the amount of bacteria growth.<br><br> The V. fischeri was cultured in Luria broth overnight and then moved to six salinities ranging from 8ppt to 38ppt and using 0ppt as the control. The absorbance of each culture tube was measured using a spectrophotometer. Absorbances were recorded and the McFarland standard was used to determine the cell count present in each salinity. <br><br>The hypothesis was shown to be incorrect. The greatest concentration of V. fischeri occurred at 8ppt salinity and the least at 38ppt with a fluctuation between the remaining salinities. Using this data, it was determined that if the oysters were relocated to deep water with high salinity, there would be a significant reduction of bacterial growth. While the results were conclusive, some additional questions were raised. During the course of recording spectrophotometer readings we noticed that some of our samples actually had a negative absorbance. One possible explanation to this could be the bioluminescent nature of the Vibrio fischeri interfered with the spectrophotometer reading meaning that at the time of spectrophotometer use, the bacteria was glowing causing there to be more light travelling through the sample than the blank was able to account for.

THE EFFECTS OF ZINC OXIDE NANOPARTICLES ON PHENAZINE PRODUCTION IN PSEUDOMONAS CHLORORAPHIS O6
Jean-Luc Watson, Tommy Fang, 
Logan High School, Logan, UT

Nanoparticles, nano-sized materials about 10 nm in diameter, harbor unique properties, thus offering tremendous potential for the future. The purpose of our project is twofold: (1) To test if ZnO nanoparticles inhibit the amount of phenazines (natural antibiotics that protect certain pseudomonads) produced by Pseudomonas chlororaphis O6 (PcO6); and (2) To determine if the reduction is caused by inhibition of cell-signaling molecule acyl homoserine lactone (AHSL) production. Our results advance research towards a cure for cystic fibrosis, a terminal disease that affects 1 in 2,500 Caucasians. Because cystic fibrosis is caused by the relative of PcO6, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, PcO6 is commonly used as a surrogate for phenazine studies. Using standard procedures, 500 µg/L of PcO6 was inoculated in lysogeny broth under varying treatments: control, bulk ZnO, ZnO nanoparticles, Zn ions, Al-doped ZnO nanoparticles, Al Ions, and Al-Zn ions. After centrifugation, phenazines were extracted using ethyl acetate from a 40 mL supernatant and a residual pellet. Phenazine concentration was measured via optical density at 366 nm with a spectrophotometer. ZnO nanoparticles were found to substantially decrease phenazine production in PcO6 via the release of zinc ions (5% significance); alternate treatments of aluminum ions and aluminum-doped nanoparticles had negligible effect. Because ions released from ZnO nanoparticles only slightly reduce AHSL levels, AHSLs are likely not the primary cell-signaling molecule being affected. Our results open medical and commercial possibilities for ZnO nanoparticles, especially in regards to the disease cystic fibrosis. Additionally, they raise new questions regarding nanoparticles’ complex role in the environment.

ANALYZING THE EFFECTS OF ANTIBIOTICS PRODUCED FROM SOIL-BORNE MICROBIALS ON THE INHIBITION OF E. COLI, M. LUTEUS, P. AERUGINOSA, AND S. AUREUS
Marc Siler, Danielle Terukina, 
Mililani High School, Mililani, HI

Antibiotics play a vital role in the survival and success of the human race. There is an eternal issue at hand involving the abilities of pathogens to develop resistance against antibiotics. Further research and development of such medicine is crucial to the growth of mankind.<br><br>Being tested is the effectiveness of antibiotic producing microbes from soil-borne bacteria against Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. Based on our experiment we hypothesized that if bacterium cultivated from soil samples exhibit antibacterial properties, then it can be utilized as an effective inhibitor on the growth of select strains of pathogens depending on the strength of the antibiotics produced. The experiment was performed through a process of serial dilution, multiple isolations of bacterium presenting antibacterial properties onto petri dishes and testing against E. coli, M. luteus, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus. Measurements of the zones of bacterial inhibition were taken. The antibiotic producing microbials were most effective against M. luteus, and showed no signs of impeding P. aeruginosa bacterium. The hypothesis was supported through experimentation and results displaying effective anitibiotic inhibition of 3 out of the 4 pathogens. Microbes from the soil samples taken were in fact effective against select harmful pathogens, proving that cultivation and analysis of antibiotic producing microbes from soil-born bacteria is a plausible way to discover and develop new medicinal products.

AN ANALYSIS OF SNAKE VENOM PROTEIN FRACTIONATION ON BACTERIAL INHIBITION
Scott Eldon Bye, Alex Watterud, 
North Toole County High School, Sunburst, MT

The purpose of this experiment was to determine which specific protein fraction in with Agkistrodon piscivorus leucostoma (Western Cottonmouth), Hemachatus haemachatus (Ringhals Cobra), and Crotalus atrox (Western Diamondback Rattlesnake) contained antibacterial properties. In earlier testing, the whole venoms displayed bacterial inhibiting behavior. We hypothesized that each of the venoms will contain at least one protein fraction that can be safely and effectively extracted for antibiotic therapy against selected bacteria. To do this, we ran venom samples through an HPLC machine, which fractions protein groups out of venom based on either molecular weight and or hydrophobic properties. After these were fractioned out, we tested them against two different bacteria to assess which fractions were effective. After finding the antibacterial properties, we tested the effective fractions against a sheep blood agar plate to determine hemolysis.

PROTIST ABUNDANCE AND TROPHIC DIVERSITY IN AREAS OF VARIED EUTROPHICATION
Lucas William Johns, Carlo Bocconcelli, 
Falmouth Academy, Falmouth, MA

As the population rises, increasing concern has been drawn to detrimental anthropogenic activities and their disruptions in ecosystems and the atmosphere. In some aquatic environments, eutrophication, though a natural process, has been accelerated by excess nutrient runoff from human actions. Over-fertilization can set off a series of events that starts with algal blooms and eventually reduces biologic production. This allows bacterial decomposers to flourish, resulting in low oxygen concentrations. <br><br> The purpose was to determine the effect of eutrophication, using nitrate concentration as a proxy, on the abundance and trophic diversity of aquatic protists. It was hypothesized that more eutrophied environments would contain lower numbers of protists and higher ratios of phytoplankton to zooplankton. <br><br> Water samples were collected at five marine and brackish sites and analyzed for water quality and protist composition. DAPI staining and epifluorescence microscopy were used to count protists and phytoplankton in each sample. <br><br> Results suggest that eutrophication relates to an increased ratio of phytoplankton to zooplankton, less trophic diversity and biodiversity, and fewer overall protists, supporting the hypothesis. The sites had not fully eutrophied, as dissolved oxygen levels remained healthy, but could eventually become dead zones such as the Gulf of Mexico coast and Chesapeake Bay. Phytoplankton maintain the balance of oceanic oxygen and consume harmful oceanic carbon dioxide, originally atmospheric, during photosynthesis. In conclusion, disturbance in phytoplankton populations or the trophic balance could cause fluctuation in oceanic CO2 and oxygen levels, negatively impacting other organisms and hindering atmospheric carbon absorption.

GMOS VS. NON–GMOS: THE FIELD OF THE UNCERTAINTIES
Rose Mary Figueroa, Julian E. Morales Delgado, 
Florencia Garcia High School, Las Piedras, PUERTO RICO

Through this investigation, it was expected to know which type of food contains less microorganisms: the genetically modified foods (GMOs) or the genetically non modified foods (Non – GMOs). It was postulated that the genetically modified foods contain a minor quantity of microorganisms when compared to the genetically non modified foods. To prove the hypothesis, the types of foods were compared by counting the microorganism’s presence in each one of them. The GMO foods used for the investigation were canned chicken, tomato sauce, and canned corn. The Non - GMO foods used were chicken, tomato and corncob. First, four growth mediums for microorganisms were prepared: MacConkey Agar to detect bacteria; Mycological Agar, which cultivates fungi; Tryptic Soy Agar, which cultivates enterobacteria; and the Luria Bertani Agar, which detects diverse microorganisms. After having placed them in an autoclave, they were poured in Petri dishes, identified and left to harden. Meanwhile, the solutions of the foods were prepared following those steps: First the solid foods were crushed. Then each one of them were diluted in solutions of 1/100mL and 1/1000mL. Finally the food solutions were pour in the Petri dishes that were already prepared containing the growth mediums. After a week of incubation, the microorganisms colonies were observed and counted. The quantitative results were tabulated as well as the qualitative ones. It was concluded that the hypothesis turned out to be false due to the fact that the genetic modification is not a factor that influences the quantity of microorganisms found in food.

ISOLATION, IDENTIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF ENDOPHYTES FROM CHEROKEE MEDICINAL PLANTS: YELLOWROOT (XANTHORHIZA SIMPLICISSIMA), DOWNY RATTLESNAKE PLANTAIN (GOODYERA PUBESCENS), AND INDIAN TOBACCO (LOBELIA INFLATA)
Erika Kate Williams, Kris Petterson, Meredith Tooley
Brevard High School, Brevard, NC

Antibiotic resistant microorganisms are becoming an increasing threat to human health. Endophytes, symbiotic fungi and bacteria that live within plants, have been recently targeted as a novel source of bioactive compounds. Previously, endophyte bioprospecting studies have focused primarily on medicinal plants from tropical rain forests in Central and South America. This study explored endophytes from three medicinal plants used by the Cherokee Indians in a temperate rain forest in western North Carolina. Xanthorhiza simplicissima, Goodyera pubescens, and Lobelia inflata specimens were surface sterilized and plated on water agar. Fungal hyphae and bacterial colonies were subcultured until pure endophyte cultures were obtained. Endophyte morphology was characterized macroscopically and microscopically. Antibiotic activity was measured against Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Six endophytes were successfully isolated from the plants, five of which demonstrated antibiotic activity against one or more of the test organisms. Bioactive endophytes were identified through DNA analysis. Two bioactive bacterial endophytes, Pseudomonas gingeri and an Enterobacter species, were isolated from the roots of Xanthorhiza simplicissima. Two bioactive fungal endophytes, a Leptosphaeria species and an Anthostomella species, were isolated from the leaves of Goodyera pubescens. One bioactive fungal endophyte, Podospora decipiens, was isolated from the leaves of Lobelia inflata. Findings suggest that Cherokee medicinal plants in western North Carolina harbor bioactive endophytes warranting further exploration.

THE EFFECTS OF VISIBLE LIGHT-INDUCED PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY IN CONJUNCTION WITH A PHOTOINITIATOR ON BACTERIUM
Adam Brandon Oppenheimer, Mark Oppenheimer, 
Hilton Head Preparatory School, Hilton Head Island, SC

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the bactericidal effects of visible light in combination with camphorquinone on pathogenic oral bacteria in human subjects. Experiments were later performed on Staphylococcus epidermidis to assess universal applicability. Bacterial collection was conducted by the qualified scientist. After bacterial samples from a randomly selected quadrant of the mouth were collected without treatment to serve as a control, 25 mM camphorquinone and 60 seconds of visible light was applied to the contralateral quadrant, and a bacterial sample was taken. The samples were introduced into a bacterial medium and grown for 4 days. The relative amounts of viable bacteria were quantified by comparing the turbidity of each test sample to its corresponding control sample. Each of the test samples demonstrated a bacterial reduction when compared to its control sample. The percent reduction in turbidity from each paired sample ranged from 1.97% to 31.00%, with an average reduction in turbidity of 20.54% which in a matched pairs t-test was statistically significant (p<.05). This observed reduction in viable bacteria confirms the previous in vitro findings and compares favorably or exceeds the bacteriocidal activity of the currently available commercial oral antimicrobial agents.<br><br>A second experiment was conducted on Staphylococcus epidermidis to examine the effects of this treatment on non-oral bacteria. Through in vitro testing, an average reduction of 21.2% was found using the same 60 seconds of visible light and 25mM camphorquinone. This reduction was nearly the same as that which was observed in the in vivo study. The similarity in the bacterial reductions on differing bacteria suggests that many other bacterial species may respond similarly.

PHAGE THERAPY: IDENTIFICATION OF VIRUSES IN STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS DURING THE EXPONENTIAL GROWTH PHASE
Angela Jean Smith, Jackson Frazier, 
Louisville High School, Louisville, OH

Phage therapy is the use of a virus to treat a bacterial infection. Certain viruses are specific to killing one type of bacteria. Viruses can be isolated to kill strains of bacteria without destroying any of the body’s cells. The purpose of this experiment was to isolate a phage to treat staphylococcus aureus bacterial infections. It was hypothesized that phage could be extracted from within the staphylococcus aureus bacteria and used to lyse multiple strains of S. aureus. Bacteria samples were collected from college students and staphylococcus aureus was isolated using standard mannitoal salt agar, catalase and coagulase tests, and gram staining. Mitomycin C was applied to the samples during their exponential growth phage and incubated for 30 minutes. The samples were then centrifuged and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was re-suspended in lysogeny broth and incubated for four hours. The samples were centrifuged again and the supernatant was tested for a virus using a spot test. No viruses were discovered from the eleven sampled inoculated.

SAVING CITRUS TREES: SEROLOGICAL DETECTION OF BACTERIA ASSOCIATED WITH CITRUS GREENING DISEASE, YEAR TWO
Neera Manoj Shah, Nehaly Manoj Shah, 
Martin Luther King High School, Riverside, CA

Huanglongbing (HLB) is a devastating disease that endangers citrus industries around the world. It is associated with an unculturable bacterium, Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (LAS), and is spread by Diaphorina citri. Early detection is critical for protection of citrus industries. This project aimed at raising antibodies against select LAS surface proteins using recombinant DNA technology to develop a rapid high-throughput serological detection method.<br><br>Based on in-silico analysis two putative LAS surface proteins, lepB and yajC, were selected for study. The two gene fragments were amplified by PCR of infected plant DNA; cloned in a bacterial expression plasmid vector, pET101D/TOPO (Invitrogen); and used for transforming Top10 E. coli cells. Plasmid DNA from positive clones confirmed by sequencing were used to transform the expression host, E. coli BL21 (DE3). Bacteria were grown to log phase and expression was induced with IPTG. Total protein extracts were analyzed by Western blot for detection of polyhistidine tag at carboxy terminal of recombinant proteins, which were purified by affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA agarose, and dialyzed. Purified protein was used to raise antibodies in chickens. Test bleeds were tested for specificity of reaction to cognate antigens by Western blot.<br><br>Clones with correct gene sequence, followed by V5 and polyhistidine tags, were used for expression. Expressed protein from large scale expression and purification was tested for purity by PAGE analysis; specificity was confirmed by Western blot. Antibodies raised in chicken detected the cognate antigen at up to 1:160,000 dilution.<br><br>This immunological method is a useful complement technique to current PCR methods. The antibodies developed need to be tested against live field samples.

Saral Baweja, Nishi Paliwal, 
Maharaja Agarsain Public School, Delhi, Delhi, INDIA

Excessive and imbalanced use of chemical fertilizer for increasing crop productivity has reduced soil fertility and caused deterioration of the environment. The use of biofertilizer in combination with organic manure has improved the quality of soil and water resulting in enhanced food productivity and sustainability.<br><br>The phosphate solubilizing activity of Bacillus subtilis RP24 on bone meal was tested and field trials were conducted to detect its efficiency as biofertilizer.<br><br>The amount of phosphate solubilized by B. subtilis from bone meal was quantified by Olsen’s procedure (Olsen et al., 1952) using tricalcium phosphate as standard. Pot experiments were conducted to compare the effect of B. subtilis and bones on growth of Phaseolus vulgaris L. and this was compared with single super phosphate as standard. Soil pH and water holding capacity were quantified after treatment.<br><br>It was observed that B. subtilis solubilizes more phosphorus from bone meal than tricalcium phosphate. Pot experiments showed that a combination of B. subtilis culture and bone meal increased fresh weight, dry weight, shoot length, root length, root shoot ratio, number of pods per plant and pod dry weight of P. vulgaris over control. Soil pH was maintained at neutrality and water holding capacity was increased after the treatment with Bacillus subtilis RP24 and bone meal combination. On the basis of our research finding, we concluded that B. subtilis and bone combination is a novel and eco-friendly way to increase the growth of plant giving far better as well as multiple benefits than its chemical counterpart.<br><br>

EXPLORING THE ANTIMICROBIAL PROPERTIES OF THE PPE (POLY-PHENYLENE ETHYNYLENE) AND THE OPE (OLIGO- PHENYLENE ETHYNYLENE) AND THE TWO ANTIBIOTICS AMPICILLIN AND VANCOMYCIN ON E.COLI AND S.AUREUS
Serene Akkad, Jenene Akkad, 
Keystone National home school, Albuquerque, NM

Investigating the antibacterial effects of the OPE (EO-OPE-TH-C2), the PPE (DABCO), Ampicillin and Vancomycin on two strains of bacteria E.coli and S.aureus. It is hypothesized that: 1) the PPE and OPE will show greater bactercidal effect in the dark, 2) both bacteria will start resisting the polymers and the antibiotics after continous exposure to them, 3) the antibacterial properties of the polymers and antibiotics will be greater at 37 degrees Celcius than 0 and 25 degrees Celcius, and 4) when combining the polymers with the antibiotics the polymers will enhance the bactercidal effects of the antibiotics. Our firsy test was to test the bactercidal effect of the polymers and the antibiotics. A set of 12 test tubes were collected. 6 were clear and 6 were dark so that no light could go through them. 1mL of each bacteria was placed into the tubes; 2 test tubes were left from each set of 6 as controls. .5 microliters and 5 microlitere of each polymer and antibiotic were added to each bacteria. Test tubes were placed into the incubator for 30 minutes. The clear testubes were irradiated at 365 nm seperatly from the dark test tubes. .2ul of the dyes Syto 9 and Propedium iodide were added to each test tube. Reading were taken using the flow cytometer. Within 30 minutes of incubation the polymers killed 99% of the bacteria and the antibiotics killed ~50% of the bacteria. However in the light the antibiotics were not quite effective as opposed to polymers. The second test consisted of testing to see if the bacteria would build a resistance to the antibiotics and polymers over the course of 18 days. After 18 days, both bacteria showed no resistance to the polymers, but showed resistance to the antibiotics.

REMOVAL OF ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANT BACTERIA FROM ANIMAL FECAL CONTAMINATED WATER BY BACTERIOPHAGE
Hyunjin Rho, Myeong Soo Ko, Seung Gi Hong

Millions of animals have been slaughtered and buried in animal farms in South Korea over the winter of 2010-2011 in an effort to curb the national outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). Consequences of water contamination from the burial of FMD-infected animals have been emerged as a public health concern, especially, heightened by reports of biological contamination such as pathogenic bacteria. Since Korean farms use approximately 1.5 times more antibiotics than other OECD countries do, the emergence of resistant bacteria from contaminated water near a burial site of FMD-infected animals is thought to be one of major threats on public health. Therefore, regular monitoring of the prevalence of antibiotic resistance as well as developing treatment techniques of contaminated water is a highly valuable study from the public health point of view. Here we investigated the prevalence of antibiotic resistance from the aquatic environments nearby an animal farm. The bacterial isolates showed a high incidence of resistance in the samples collected near the farm. Most of the isolates showed multi-antibiotic resistance and appeared to be dominated by the genera Delftia, Burkholderia, Enterobacter, Acinetobacter, Shigella and Pseudomonas. By the reason that bacteriophages are one of new potential therapeutics to treat antibiotic resistant bacteria, we subsequently tested a bacteriophage-mediated bactericidal effect for antibiotic resistant bacteria. We showed significantly decreased antibiotic resistance by bacteriophage treatment. Therefore, it strongly suggests that the application of bacteriophage is plausible in the treatment of antibiotic resistant bacteria that contaminate water, especially derived from a burial site of FMD-infected animals.<br><br>Keywords: Antibiotics, Antibiotic resistance, Bacteriophage, Foot-and-mouth disease

Nowadays, nanoparticles are widely used in medicine, industry and agriculture. To meet this demand scientists use chemical and physical methods of synthetic procedure which have some economic, healthcare and environmental disadvantages. <br><br>Recent research proves that using fungi in the synthesis of silver nanoparticles is an efficient and viable alternative to the existing methods. In this project fungus belongs to Aspergillus genus which is used for biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles. The initial idea was to use Aspergillus for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles. We thought that it was possible to synthesize AgNPs in a shorter time with czapek-dox.<br><br>In this procedure fungi which were isolated from soil reduced Ag+ ion to the non-toxic Ag nanoparticles by producing enzymes and metabolites for their own survival. The absorption UV-Visible light spectroscopy and scanning electronic microscopy is used to prove synthesis of silver nanoparticles.<br><br>The measurements indicate that biosynthesis of AgNPs by Aspergillus sp.UB-5 produces AgNPs with the diameters in the range of 40-50 nm. Aspergillus sp.UB-5 is an environmentally friendly fungus, and it is well known for its formation of enzyme and metabolites in very large amounts, much higher than other fungi. <br><br>As a result we obtained clean silver nanoparticles in 48 hours with chapeck-dox. The benefits of this way of production are economic effect (by using czapek-dox as a nutrient) and production of large amounts of AgNPs in a shorter period of time. The project proves that the presented process is an excellent opportunity for industrial scale production of silver nanoparticles, which are widely used in optics, water treatment, electronics, catalysis and antimicrobial agents.

The Antarctic has extreme biodiversity because of their climatic conditions, therefore, there is a wide variety of species that are adapted to these conditions. The Pseudomonas sp. is a bacteria of global expansion that also live in Antarctic, so this genus has demonstrated extremophile conditions. This research, experiment with this genus of bacteria isolated from King George Island, Antarctic. The work was conducted with strains of land and water origin. Were exposed to UV laboratory lamp, to prove the existence of resistance. At the same time, it experimented with each of the strains linking the different angles of incidence on the crop, simulating the winter sun angle 2.6 ° and 48.1 ° in summer time. This research has found UV resistance in this genus of bacteria, which are much stronger in winter because the angle of incidence of the sun, giving a large projection to the biotechnology.

FINDING NOVEL ALGINATE GENES FOR THE BETTER MANAGEMENT OF PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA INFECTION IN CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS
Shiva Kangeyan
Archimedean Upper Conservatory, Miami, FL

The opportunistic pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, infects patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). P. aeruginosa undergoes a phenotypic reversion in the CF lung, from nonmucoid to mucoid, by overproducing the exopolysaccharide alginate. This is often due to a mutation in the mucA gene, which encodes an anti-sigma factor. These mucoid strains often revert to nonmucoid in vitro due to second-site suppressor mutations. It was thought that mapping these mutations will lead to identification of novel genes involved in alginate production. In order to do so, thirty-five nonmucoid revertants were spontaneously generated from a mucoid strain, PAO1mucA22, containing a mucA mutation. These revertants are known as sap (suppressor of alginate phenotype) mutants. Previously in this project, a sap strain, sap17, was complemented by mucP, a novel alginate gene. So, it was hypothesized that a mutation in mucP was causing the reversion of sap17 to nonmucoid. This year, the mucP locus was sequenced in sap17, which revealed no mucP mutation, implying that other alginate genes were responsible for its reversion. Since other sap strains were complemented by algO (a homolog to the Prc protease), sap17 was complemented with algO with the expectation of similar results. The complementation restored its mucoid phenotype. Sequencing showed that sap17 had a truncated AlgO protein caused by a base-pair substitution. Taken together, the data suggests that mucP works downstream of algO, whose role is presently being elucidated. The results from this experiment will help understand alginate production, increase the life expectancy of CF patients, and decrease the bacteria’s lethality.

OPTIMIZING ENERGY PRODUCTION THROUGH WASTE WATER TREATMENT: THE UTILIZATION OF A MEDIATOR-LESS, SINGLE CELLED MICROBIAL FUEL CELL
Nurul MohdReza
Union Colony Charter School, Greeley, CO

Microbial fuel cells are of promising technology in the bio electrochemical field, but to produce sustainable amounts of energy, further experimentation on certain boundaries such as the type of inoculum need to be taken into consideration when constructing a viable fuel source. This study investigates the comparison of primary and secondary treated waste water in single-chambered microbial fuel cells. The effect of potassium ferricyanide, as a cathodic electron acceptor, was also tested to determine if there was a correlation between the chemical, the production of energy, and the treatment of water. <br><br>Four single-chambered microbial fuel cells were developed. Two of the containers contained 600 ml of either primary or secondary treated waste water depending on the fuel cell. Electrodes represented the anode and the cathode and consisted of carbon-cloth squares bounded by copper wire. Electrical parameters along with chemical oxygen demand (COD) tests were recorded to determine the performance of the fuel cells.<br><br>After conducting t-Tests (assuming unequal variance), the results revealed that there were no significant differences between the two waste waters and the comparison of which inoculum performed best with the permeation of potassium ferricyanide. Power production was significant with the addition of the chemical oxidant, creating a maximum power output of 400 mW. COD removal efficiencies were also significant, producing a maximum of 83% substrate removal. With further knowledge of the working parameters within a fuel cell, this product can soon become a green bio energy technology; therefore, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and protecting the environment.

THE EFFECT OF HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN 33 ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE RESISTANCE IN ESCHERICHIA COLI
Kathryn Elise Morris
New Prague Senior High School, New Prague, MN

I tested to see if Heat Shock Protein 33 (HSP33) is one of the causes of bleach resistance in E. coli bacteria. I plated a wild type and a mutant (HSP33 lacking) strain of E. coli onto agar plates and then placed 4 filter paper disks onto each plate. I pipetted 20 μl of bleach onto each of the disks and then incubated the plates. After incubation, I measured the diameters of the zones of inhibition (the bare circles around the disks. Using a sterile loop, I selected a colony of resistant bacteria from the edge of the zone of the inhibition. I then plated these bacteria on a TH plate to incubate overnight. This made up the resting round of my experiment. I repeated these steps for 5 rounds using 5 different concentrations of bleach. I calculated an average percent change from the 1st round to the 5th round and used the percent change to compare the mutant to the wild type strain of bacteria. The greater the percent change, the greater the resistance induced. The wild type bacteria induced a slightly greater resistance than the mutant bacteria at most concentrations. This shows that HSP33 is a cause of resistance to bleach in E. coli, however it is not the only cause. I believe my experiment shows that E. coli has evolved many proteins to help it survive under oxidative stress.

 POSSIBLE SPORULATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF MYCOBACTERIA ISOLATES FROM PITCHER PLANTS, PHASE II
Kendra Anastasia Pallin
Cloquet Senior High School, Cloquet, MN

Bacteria have the ability to adapt to different growth conditions, survive in various environments, and enter into dormant stages, while others have the ability to form spores when exposed to potential stressors (Singh et. al, 2010). However, Mycobacteria are acid fast, show significant resilience against environmental stressors and inhabit many environmental reservoirs (Singh et. al, 2010). The purpose of this project was to identify previously un-described Mycobacteria isolates from pitcher plants found in a northern Minnesota bog and to determine what effect potential stressors, such as starvation, have on the possible adaptive sporulation of Mycobacteria species. The hypothesis was there is a possibility a new species of Mycobacteria will be isolated from pitcher plants. Additionally, since Mycobacteria are acid fast and show significant resilience against environmental insults, they will, when exposed to potential stressors, adapt sporulation as a defensive mechanism. The method consisted of PCR amplification of the genes hsp65, dnaJ, secA, and rpoB, genetic sequencing and BLAST searches, as well as spore forming techniques. The results suggest that new Mycobacteria species may have been cultured from the pitcher plants. Additionally, acid-fast stains indicate possible sporulation as well. Thus, both hypotheses are probable. However, further investigative techniques are being performed and results are pending. The latency of Mycobacteria poses several threats to human health (Ghosh et. al, 2009).Thus, an improved understanding of the physiology and genetics of Mycobacterium and its persistence to stressors and slow growth, could attribute greatly to the prophylaxis of Mycobacteria pathogens.

ADVANCED DESIGN FIELD COMBAT AND BURN BANDAGE USING ANTIMICROBIAL COPPER AND BIO INHIBITOR FILM
Summer Anne Monroe
Polk State College Lakeland Collegiate High School, Lakeland, FL

Battlefield wounds present a significant risk of infection due to the potential for massive trauma and burns. Dangerous conditions often delay and limit critical medical treatment in combat, and current wound bandages are not designed to significantly fight infection other than covering the wound. This project examined the effectiveness of a modified combat trauma bandage in reducing the viability of Staphylococcus aureus in wound infections. This is accomplished by incorporating layers of copper mesh, copper foil, and a nano imprinted bio-inhibitor film into the gauze bandage padding.<br><br> Bandage testing was performed in a BSL level 2 university laboratory using three different testing procedures. The first was the Kirby Bauer “zone of inhibition” test on copper coupons. The second test studied the effect of copper tarnishing on bacterial viability. The third test series examined if bacterial viability on the bandage itself could be measured using “flow cytometry.”<br><br>Test times ranged from 30 to 180 minutes.<br><br> Test results on the copper clearly showed coppers strong antimicrobial properties. Tarnish on the coppers surface did slightly reduce the antimicrobial properties of the copper. The test series using “flow cytometry” was inconclusive however, as flow cytometry analyses at the single bacterial cell size level and the gauze padding gave off particles of cotton that interfered with the laser analysis. <br><br> Future testing using standard plating techniques could further demonstrate the antimicrobial properties of this advanced bandage. DAPI staining with fluorescent microscopy would also be of interest but very expensive to utilize.

INVESTIGATING THE ROLE OF HEME POCKET RESIDUES IN A GLOBIN COUPLED SENSOR
William Huang Jin
Gwinnett School of Mathematics, Science, and Technology, Lawrenceville, GA

BpeGReg is a Globin Coupled Sensor; it has a sensing heme that binds ligands and then transmits that signal to a diguanylate cyclase domain that produces c-di-GMP, an important nucleotide in biofilm formation which causes 65% of infections in the developed world. The infectiousness of Bordetella Pertussis is due to biofilms, but the problem to solving biofilm formation is that nothing was known about BpeGReg in regard to important gas-binding residues, which would then also be vital signal transmission, so this project researched how this signal is transmitted through BpeGReg. By reducing the protein in the glovebox and looking at UV-visible spectroscopy, the results of mutation to key residues— Y43F or S68A— on oxygen binding was found. It was originally thought that both mutations would only weaken oxygen binding because this was the case in a related globin coupled sensor, HemAT-Bs, but the Y43F mutation actually resulted in autooxidation and no oxygen-binding. The S68A mutant weaker binding and it resulted in a Kd that is seventy times weaker than the wild type. This means it is a 70x weaker oxygen binder, in fact oxygen-saturated buffer (1.3 mM O2 concentration) was needed for full binding. This supports our model where Tyr-43 is a primary hydrogen bond donor while Ser-68 assists by holding the tyrosine in place. The research also led to the conclusion that Tyr-43 probably has a vital role in signal transmission that should be the focus of future research to elucidate the signal transmission system for promising anti-biofilm applications.

Harmony Science Academy - Euless, Euless, TX

The purpose of this experiment was to compare the transformation efficiency of E. coli mutants and wild strand E. coli. Concentrated Lysol was used to screen for mutants. Lysol was distributed into melted TSA tubes using concentrations of 1000µl, 100µl, 10µl, and 1µl respectively. There was no growth on agar plates containing 1000µl, 100µl, or 10µl but an abundance of growth on the 1µl plates. Due to these results, more TSA plates were prepared using concentrations ranging from 10µl to 1µl in increments of 2µl. From this trial 15 potential mutants were found, and after confirmation 14 mutants were left; 8 growing on TSA plates with 10µl of Lysol and 6 growing on TSA plates with 6 µl of Lysol. These 14 mutants, although some formed from the same concentration of Lysol, should be thought of as individual mutants and run through transformation separately. Therefor 4 mutants were randomly selected from the 10µl plate. From the 10µl plate, mutants 6 and 8 increased in transformation efficiency, and although there was abundant growth on the media containing mutant 9, the transformation efficiency was relatively the same as the wild type; exhibiting the strong resistance mutant 9 had to ampicillin. All mutants from the 10µl plates either had an increase in transformation or no difference at all. Along with this the majority of the mutants also gained an ampicillin resistant gene, showing that the Lysol altered the E. coli in some unknown way.

Rosa Scarlett Reece
Woodland High School, Stockbridge, GA

In today's society, many fear that the overuse of antibacterial products will lead to germs building resistance to these products. This experiment will test the effectiveness of UV-C versus steam.<br><br>Using a sterile pipette, place 1 ml of sterile water onto the center of petrifilm. Use a petrifilm spreader to distribute the sterile water onto the petriflm. Swab the surface and culture the petrifilm prior to exposing the surface to the independent variable. When cleaning the surface with the UV-C, hold the UV-C 2 inches above the area for 2 minutes as recommended. When cleaning the surface with the steam cleaner, hold the cleaner 1 inch above the surface for 10 seconds as recommended. Swab each surfaces after cleaning and culture petrifilm. Place petrifilms in an incubator at 37 degrees Celsius for 24 hours. Record the quantity of bacterial colonies.<br><br>After conducting the UV-C experiment on the desktop, the percentage reduction was 93.28%, after the bathroom door, the percent reduction was 99.06% , and after the lunch tables, the percent reduction was 95.84%. After conducting the steam experiment on the bathroom door, the percent reduction was 88.8%, after the desktop, the percent reduction was 68.08%, and after the lunch table, the percent reduction was 94.33%. There was a greater percent reduction of bacteria after the UV-C cleaning than the steam machine while cleaning the different surfaces.<br><br>The hypothesis was accepted because the UV-C eradicated more bacteria on the surfaces than the steam machine. This experiment showed how both green ways to clean effectively eradicated bacteria, but the UV-C killed more bacteria.

Shilin Gong
Jilin Provincial Experimental High School, Changchun, CHINA

Fungus puffball is a Chinese Medicine healing trauma and ulcer, however, it has insufficient wild resources. The project intends to isolate strain suitable for industrial fermentation production from wild puffball, utilize fermentation metabolite to replace puffball for medicinal use protecting its ecological resources. We adopt experiment method of tissue isolation and spore isolation, screen out strain of fast growing hypha, flourishing growing trend from 8 kinds of wild puffball; adopt solid slant culture to inspect biological character of mycelium; adopt shake flask culture to ensure liquid fermentation conditions; adopt agar plate disc method to detect antibacterial activity, double dilution to detect minimum bacteriostatic concentration; MTT method to detect tissue repair effect of zymotic fluid. The result indicates, Scleroderma polyrhizum–Spo2 strain germinates fast; it has strong growing trend; its liquid fermentation conditions are simple, low-cost; it has short production cycle coinciding with requirements of liquid fermentation strain. Compared with sporophore and fermentation hypha, its zymotic fluid has comparably strong inhibited effect on staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli; zymotic fluid heal trauma quickly with small dosage. It dosage can make suckling mouse skin fibroblast proliferation rate 57.09% at 4h 30 mg•L-1. The results indicate that zymotic fluid has effect of anti-infection and stimulating tissue repair providing scientific basis for zymotic fluid to replace wild puffball for medicinal use.

RESEARCH PROGRAM ON THE EFFECT AND PRELIMINARY MECHANISM OF EARTHWORMS (EISENIA FOETIDA)-WASHED SOLUTION ON PREVENTION OF ROSE BOTRYTIS CINEREA
Yicen Yan
Beijing No. 101 High School, Beijing, CHINA

Rose Botrytis cinerea is a worldwide serious plant disease harmful to its growth and flower quality. Preventive chemicals may cause Botrytis cinerea resistant to them, and bring environmental pollution. This experiment intended to find a biological method to solve the problem. An earthworm-washed aqueous solution containing grume secreted from earthworm’s deuterocoel and back was used in agar plate and field anti-bacteria experiments with CK as control and CT, CT1 and CT2 (original solution, 10% and 1% content) as experiment groups. In field experiments, the solution was directly sprayed on rose leaves to compare their growth and quality difference with blank. After 4 weeks growth with the solution sprayed, 3 plants of each group were randomly chosen, Botrytis cinerea spore suspension was injected onto them. After 3 days, the injected leaves were measured. The results showed that the injection area of control leave group, CK, reached 171.87 cm², while the treatment group was 0. Then the earthworm-washed solution was dialyzed to separate it into macromolecules and micromolecules solutions. Vacuum freeze-drying was used to treat the solutions and recover the molecules which were further used for preparation of solutions in repeated experiments. After some agar plate and field experiments using the two solutions, the micromolecules including antibacterial peptide showed obvious bacteriostatic effect, however the macromolecules did not. It is concluded that the earthworm-washed solution has obvious bacteriostatic effect on rose Botrytis cinerea, especially the micromolecules. <br><br>Key words: rose, Botrytis cinerea, earthworm-washed solution, antibacterial peptide

ANTI-BACTERIAL LEMONADE
Mason David Corbett
Lakeview Christian School, Auburn, AL

Observing that certain common household substances are very acidic, I experimented to determine how effectively such substances kill bacteria found in creek water. I hypothesized that if the substances used were acidic enough, they would effectively kill bacteria in the water.<br><br> First, I created a 1:10 strength nutrient agar as a growing medium for any microorganisms in the creek water sample. I created treatments by mixing the substances to be tested with creek water in different ratios. In the first set of treatments, I used lime juice, Diet Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola, and reconstituted powdered milk. After observing the results of the first experiment, I decided to try the experiment again using lemon juice, which has a pH very close to that of the most effective substance used: lime juice. I created a second set of treatments using lime juice and lemon juice.<br><br> The citrus juices killed bacteria very effectively. Neither Coca-Cola product nor the powdered milk significantly impeded the growth of bacteria. Citrus juice would be an effective, inexpensive, and easy way to kill bacteria in drinking water when on the trail. My hypothesis was: “If a substance has a low enough pH, I think that adding that substance to a sample of creek water will kill a significant amount of bacteria in the sample, because of the acidity of the substance added.” Apparently, neither Coca-Cola product nor the milk had a low enough pH.

THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL: UTILIZING OLIGOSACCHARIDE COMPOUNDS TO ENHANCE THE GROWTH OF NORMAL INTESTINAL FLORA
Taylor Diahann Gaines
Miami High School, Miami, OK

In the human intestines, there are more than 500 different species of bacteria; however not all of them are commensalistic. One of the primary jobs of commensal bacteria is keeping in check the pathogens that also reside in our gut. A prebiotic is a non-digestible food product that acts as a nutritional source for the commensal bacteria. To be considered an effective prebiotic, the compound must be non-digestible. Upon reaching the colon it must then be able to be fermented by commensal bacteria. Six potential prebiotics were chosen. The oligosaccharide compounds FOS, fucoidan, brown seaweed, chitosan, and alginate, as well as beta-glucan, were all tested for potential prebiotic properties. The compounds were tested for resistance to digestibility with digestive enzymes and hydrochloric acid over a 3 hour incubation period using the Benedict’s reagent test for reducing sugars and glucose test strips. For fermentability, the oligosaccharides were added to phenol red broth at 1% and 3% concentrations and lactic acid production was evaluated for two commensalistic and one pathogenic bacteria: Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Enterococcus faecium. All tested oligosaccharides remained mostly intact after incubation with the acid and enzymes, indicating their ability to reach the colon. An iodine starch test indicated that the oligosaccharides did not contain starch. Based on the results of the phenol red fermentation tests, all oligosaccharides were fermentable by the probiotic bacteria at various concentrations and/or preparatory methods. Mixed cultures of commensal and pathogenic bacteria are being tested with the oligosaccaride compounds to determine the competition and aiding factor of oligosaccharide.

ENGINEERING A NOVEL FUSION PROTEIN THERAPY FOR MENINGOCOCCAL INFECTION
Rahi Dilip Punjabi
Advanced Math and Science Academy Charter School, Marlborough, MA

Neisseria meningitidis is a major cause of meningitis and sepsis worldwide with a 25% mortality rate. Since the bacterium binds to factor H (fH), a protein intended to shield human tissue from the complement system, via factor H binding protein (fHbp), it can elude complement-mediated killing. In this study, recombinant fusion proteins were constructed to bind to fHbp on N. meningitidis and thereby enable the complement system to target the bacterium. These proteins comprised of murine IgG fused to rhesus fH mutants that hypothetically induced a higher affinity for fHbp than human fH. <br><br> Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the binding of the fusion proteins to fHbp was compared to the binding of human fH to fHbp. The rhesus fH G401R mutant fusion protein was able to bind to fHbp at a significantly higher level than the human fH wild type fusion protein. This finding was confirmed using flow cytometry to assess the binding of the rhesus fH G401R fusion protein to representative strains from the A, B, C, W, and Y serogroups of N. meningitidis. Furthermore, there was a significant increase from 41.6% to 81.6% (p<0.01) in the median fluorescence of complement proteins deposited on N. meningitidis across all five serogroups with the addition of the rhesus fH G401R fusion protein. <br><br> In conclusion, fusion proteins demonstrate considerable potential as a therapy for meningococcal infection since they reverse the complement evasion mechanism of N. meningitidis, boost the body’s immune response to infection, and work effectively across a range of meningococcal serogroups.

TESTING DISINFECTANTS FOR KILLING BACTERIA ON COMPUTER KEYBOARDS
Megan Abigail Lange
Auburn High School, Auburn, AL

Exposure to bacteria on school surfaces is known to be a factor in the spread of illnesses among students. Multi-user computers are one possible source of bacterial and viral exposure. In this study, the bacteria populations of computer keyboards in public computer labs were quantified using adenosine triphosphate swab testing. A majority of the keyboards were found to have a large bacterial population, which could spread illness. The large bacteria population is likely due to a combination of frequent human contact and infrequent cleaning of the keyboards. To reduce the possibility of contracting illness due to contact with the keyboard, effective disinfection is needed.<br><br>In this study, various disinfectants were tested including: chlorine based disinfectant spray (Clorox); alcohol based disinfectant wipes (CVS); quaternary ammonium surfactant based wipes (Lysol); and botanical based wipes (CVS Hand & Face). Disinfectants were applied and allowed to act for ten minutes. All disinfectants reduced the bacterial population of the key-boards, but none accomplished complete disinfection. Chlorine based spray disinfectant was the best for reducing bacteria, achieving over 98 percent kill. Commonly utilized quaternary ammonium based disinfectants were less effective than chlorine, but were more effective than isopropanol and botanical based disinfectants. None of the disinfectants could achieve the 99.9 percent reduction of bacteria that is heralded on the package labels. However, normal disinfection of keyboards could reduce, but not eliminate, the possibility of infection.

CU LATER BACTERIA
Brandon Healey
Weber High School, Pleasant View, UT

Over 70,000 people die each year from hospital infections and many antibiotics have become ineffective in the fight against bacterial infection. There are natural antimicrobials, such as copper, that could help in the fight against bacterial infections. This project attempted to demonstrate that copper, if used in a clinic setting, could reduce the amount of bacteria spread. Different metals were tested for their antimicrobial abilities. The metals were inoculated with bacteria and then observed for seven days after which bacterial counts were documented. A second series of tests were conducted in a medical clinic to compare the growth of bacteria on copper against bacterial growth on stainless steel, the most commonly used metal in healthcare settings. The study was conducted on both airborne bacteria and bacteria spread by touch. Samples were taken from each metal and colony forming units were counted and observed for five (5) days. This process was repeated twelve times at varying locations of the clinic. The data demonstrate that copper was a very effective antimicrobial. All of the stainless steel samples showed bacteria growth while the copper samples showed little existent bacterial growth. Copper showed to be 99 percent more effective in stopping bacterial growth than the other metals and may be more effective in maintaining a sterile environment in healthcare settings.

EFFECT OF MANUKA HONEY ON BACTERIAL BIOFILMS: MECHANISM OF ACTION AND EFFECTS IN COMBINATION WITH ANTIBIOTICS
Michelle Elisabeth Marie Campeau
Mayo High School, Rochester, MN

Biofilms cause most modern infections, and are challenging to treat due to antibiotic resistance. Manuka honey could be used to treat biofilm associated infections.<br><br> Manuka honey’s ability to kill Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms alone and in combination with traditional antibiotics was investigated. S. aureus and P. aeruginosa biofilms were eradicated by 3 and 30% Manuka honey, respectively. Subinhibitory Manuka honey concentrations increased vancomycin’s activity against S. aureus biofilms and gentamicin’s activity against P. aeruginosa biofilms. Specifically, 0.3433 was the fractional biofilm eradication concentration index (FBECI) for the combination of vancomycin and Manuka honey against S. aureus biofilms, indicating a synergistic interaction. The FBECI for the combination of gentamicin and Manuka honey was 0.7833 - 0.8167 against P. aeruginosa biofilms, indicating an additive interaction.<br><br> Scanning electron microscopy of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa biofilms exposed to Manuka honey and artificial honey containing equivalent sugar concentrations to Manuka honey was performed. Manuka honey had dramatic effects on both S. aureus and P. aeruginosa biofilms. Manuka honey resulted in a decrease of P. aeruginosa biofilm extracellular matrix. S. aureus and P. aeruginosa biofilm cells had distorted morphologies when exposed to Manuka honey. Artificial honey had similar, but less pronounced effects.<br><br> Manuka honey was active against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa biofilms and enhanced the activity of vancomycin in killing S. aureus biofilms and gentamicin in killing P. aeruginosa biofilms.

EVOLUTIONARY AND LIGAND-BINDING DYNAMICS OF CLFB AND ISDA IN STAPHYLOCOCCAL SPECIES
Amy Xu
Jericho High School, Jericho, NY

Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage (SANC) in healthy humans (30% of the population) increases infection risk by a factor of three. Coevolution allows for the transition from SANC to pathogenicity, yet the processes involved—specifically those concerning non-immune factors—are ill-defined. <br><br>This study aims to elucidate the evolved host-specificity of SANC-associated adhesins clumping factor B (ClfB) and iron-regulated surface determinant A (IsdA) in pursuit of an improved mouse model of staphylococcal infection. PCR screening, molecular cloning, whole-genome sequencing, and Sanger sequencing resulted in the discovery of novel ClfB and IsdA genes in S. lentus, a mouse colonizer. Phylogenetic analysis showed that both ClfB and IsdA undergo divergent evolution across the Staphylococcus genus (p<.001) through direct adhesin-to-host ligand interactions. Fibrinogen-binding assays showed S. lentus ClfB+ with greater adherence to mouse fibrinogen than S. lentus ClfB- and S. aureus ClfB+ (p<0.0001), demonstrating host-specific divergence in the binding region of ClfB. <br><br>A major setback for S. aureus research is the ineffective binding of human commensal S. aureus to WT rodents. Thus, an improved mouse model of SANC was conceptualized and created by engineering a S. aureus strain that expresses the more mouse molecule-adherent ClfB binding region of S. lentus. The genetic manipulation of S. aureus is about 25 times faster and 30 times less expensive than using transgenic mice to address the incongruence between mouse models and the human host condition. <br><br>Taken together, this study highlights evolutionary patterns of SANC that are key to correcting current animal models and designing individualized, preventative medicine.

MORPHOGENESIS OF AND CHROMOSOME SEGREGATION IN ESCHERICHIA COLI BRANCHING MUTANTS
Kaitavjeet Chowdhary
Glastonbury High School, Glastonbury, CT

The cell shape of any bacterium is essential to its function. Recent studies have shown that deletion of a group of peptidoglycan-synthesizing enzymes called Penicillin Binding Proteins (PBPs) leads to a unique, "branching" morphology in E. coli, causing rod shaped cells to bifurcate into “Y”-shapes. The mechanisms governing the morphogenesis of these mutants, especially the role of the essential cell division protein, FtsZ, are not well understood. This study aimed to probe the morphogenesis of branching mutants, and also investigate how the process of chromosome segregation is affected. Through site-directed mutagenesis of 90 FtsZ surface amino acid residues, we isolated the 96th amino acid as the single FtsZ residue responsible for cell branching. Comparisons with branching in PBP deletion strains, and immunofluorescence microscopy of FtsZ and MreB in the FtsZ mutants, led us to propose a novel model pointing to the morphology being a result of the interaction of this FtsZ residue with Low-Molecular-Weight PBPs to position the cytokinetic FtsZ Ring. Additionally, visualization of chromosome localization in the branching mutants through DAPI staining revealed an even pattern of segregation into both branch arms. Thus, we also proposed a model for chromosome segregation in these mutants. Ongoing and future experiments will involve mutant “rescue” experiments and more specific chromosome localization methods. Understanding the questions posed in this study and future work will provide key insight into the fundamental processes responsible for how bacterial cells control cell shape, as well as into chromosomal dynamics. Such work is promising for applications such as antibiotic drug development.

THE PHYLOGENY OF ANTIBACTERIAL TRAITS IN CACTI AND RELATED SUCCULENTS, YEAR TWO
Brandon David Beatty
Hardee Senior High School, Wauchula, FL

The purpose of this experiment was to determine if there was a phylogenetic relationship between various tribes of cacti and related succulents in regards to their antibacterial characteristics. Fourteen different species of cacti and succulents representing eight different tribes were used in this experiment. A fifty percent extract was prepared for each cactus species. The extracts were spread over LB agar plates which were previously inoculated with nonpathogenic Escherichia coli. After incubation, colonies were counted and recorded in colonies per square centimeter for each extract. A secondary experiment tested each extract using the Kirby-Bauer agar diffusion test. . Eleven of 14 species of cacti and succulents studied had half or less colonies per square centimeter than the control group. Thirteen of 14 had statistically significant reduction in bacterial colony counts. The Opuntioidea group and the ancestral plant Pereskia grandifolia had the greatest bacterial reduction, with 118.4 and 116.1 colonies per cm2 respectively. Haageocereus spp. which had 98.1 colonies per cm2, but was in the same tribe as Hylocereus undatas, at 448.2 colonies per cm2, which was the cactus with the highest bacterial colony count. The non-cactus succulent Portulacaria afra had similar results to most of the other cacti in the study. These findings do not support the hypothesis that that there is a phylogenetic link between the tribes of cacti.

BACTERICIDAL BEHAVIOR AND THE EFFECTS OF NANOPARTICLES IN THE ENVIRONMENT
Sarah Maria Berumen
Sunnyside High School, Sunnyside, WA

Objectives: To determine if commercial products that contain silver nano-particles can inhibit Escherichia-coli, Nitrosomonas europaea, and Bacillus subtilis. To determine if silver nanoparticles are toxic to the environment and to find if nanoparticle straws can improve water quality. <br><br>Methods: Measured the turbidity of the Euglena population. Tested the fermenatation of yeast with and without nanoproducts, then calculated ppm of CO2 . Measured inhibition zone of bacteria treated with nanoproducts. Coated metal tubes with nano-silver and gold and measured turbidity of broth.<br><br>Results: The Nano silver was most effective in inhibiting bacterial growth on B.subtilis. The second most effective was the toothbrush extract on B. subtilis. Concentrations of (.1 ml) ml nano-silver and antimicrobial sock extract (.1 ml) decreased the Euglena population. The metal straws coated with nano-silver, and gold decreased the amount of N. europaea in the broth. Nano- silver products significantly increased the production of CO2 from the yeast fermentation. The experiments with yeast fermentation and Euglena didn’t show any toxic effects from the Nano- particles. <br><br><br>Conclusion: The most effective inhibitor against E.coli was the Nano silver. The (.3 ml) concentration of the product extract increased the Euglena population after four days. With (.1 ml) concentration of the product extract did not produce a significant difference in the Euglena population. In the experiment with the metal straws coated with nano-silver and gold, the turbidity of all bacteria decreased but N. europaea decreased the most in the broth.

PREVENTING TOOTH PLAQUE: USE OF TEA TREE OIL AND OTHER NATURAL SUBSTANCE TO INHIBIT STREPTOCOCCUS MUTANS BIOFILM
Stephanie Gavin
Sachem High School East, Farmingville, NY

The objective of this project was to discover possible ways to treat dental caries with natural substances. Dental Caries results when tooth plaque, a bacterial biofilm, is formed by specific types of acid-producing bacteria that can cause damage in the presence of fermentable carbohydrates (sucrose, fructose, glucose, etc.) Essential oils tested included: palmarosa, lavender, rosemary, sweet orange, cinnamon, baobab, tea tree, clove, eucalyptus, and sesame, coconut, and frankincense myrrhs. The hypothesis for this study was that tea tree oil (from Melaleuca alternifolia) , clove oil and baobab oil (from Adansonia digiotata) will decrease the amount of Streptococcus mutans and its biofilm formation. Multiple suspensions of S. mutans were performed in triplicate and exposed to tea tree oil, clove oil and baobab oil at: 1:10, 1:100, 1:1000, as well as a 1:100 dilution of coconut oil, sesame oil, and a combination of the two oils, with nutrient broth as a control. To assess biofilm formation, crystal violet assay was performed and samples were measured at 625nm of light using a Vernier colorimeter and a Logger Pro program. A disc diffusion assay was also performed and collected data through measurement of zone of inhibition. Data indicated that the largest dilution of tea tree oil, a 1:10 dilution, causes the largest decrease in Streptococcus mutans biofilm. Disc diffusions were performed and showed that lavender and rosemary also prevent and destroy S. mutans biofilm growth. This data can be used to make more effective approaches to controlling dental plaque.

COMPARING ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE IN TRADITIONAL AND ORGANIC DAIRY CATTLE USING DISC DIFFUSION SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING
Stephanie Theresa Keller
Conrad Weiser Area High School, Robesonia, PA

Antibiotic resistance has become an issue in the food, agricultural, and medical industries in the United States and around the world. Studies have shown that antibiotic resistance in farm animals can spread between species, including the humans handling them. This experiment compares the antibiotic resistance in dairy cattle that are raised on traditional and organic dairy farms. Traditionally raised cattle are commonly exposed to antibiotics, whereas organic dairy cattle are fed natural products, and only exposed to antibiotics if absolutely necessary (i.e. disease treatment). The bacteria were collected from manure samples using diluted saline swabs, streaked onto plates using a cell spreader, and tested against five different antibiotics. The zones of inhibition were compared to the standards for antimicrobial drug susceptibility adapted from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The results were analyzed to determine if a significant difference exists in the antibiotic resistance in the two bacteria populations. <br><br>Results showed that antibiotic resistance may occur in both traditional and organic dairy cattle. The traditional dairy cattle were resistant to more types of antibiotics than organic dairy cattle. A two-tail t-test was used to measure statistically significant differences in the resistance to tetracycline. The t-test indicates bacteria from the organic dairy cattle were more resistant to tetracycline than the population from traditional dairy cattle, which contradicted the expected outcome.

FINDING THE QUORUM IN P. FLUORESCENS THAT ALTERS GENE EXPRESSION
Megan Elizabeth Campbell
Conrad Weiser Area High School, Robesonia, PA

Quorum sensing is the regulation of gene expression in response to fluctuations in cell-population density. Pseudomonas fluorescens are known to bioluminate as a result of quorum sensing and the release of N-Acyl Homoserine Lactones, known as AHL. Test tubes containing ten milliliters of liquid Luria Broth media and plates of twenty-five milliliters of Luria Broth agar were inoculated with Pseudomonas fluorescens. The cultures were observed to determine the growth rate and the point at which gene expression is altered, otherwise known as the quorum. The P. fluorescens in the Luria Broth agar reach their quorum between six and seven hours of growth in an incubator set at twenty-five degrees Celsius. It was discovered that the rate of growth of P. fluorescens exponentially slows down as the bacteria reach their quorum, or full communication. Future experiments may determine if bacterial populations enter the stationary stage due to the disadvantage of P. fluorescens continuing growth after the quorum has been reached.

BIOACTIVE MOLECULES IN DIPLOPODS (RHINOCRICUS SP): THE FUTURE OF DRUGS!
Pedro Machado de Godoy
Colegio Rainha da Paz, Sao Paulo, BRASIL

Since the pre-Cambrian period, 650 million to 450 million years ago, the arthropoda phylum is the most numerous phylum of living organisms with more than a million taxa. They are found in all regions except for Antarctica. This happens because the arthropods are well adapted to most environments, even the hostile ones with high presence of microorganisms and parasites, what may indicate an efficient immune system. The invertebrate immune system is directly related to humoral and coordinated cell reactions. Bioactive molecules are an important factor in the invertebrates immune system. These molecules can be constitutive or synthesized when an invasion by microorganism is detected. The study of bioactive molecules has been gaining popularity as they may be the best substitutes for antibiotics, and may also provide necessary data for a better understanding of the immune system of these animals. Bioactive molecules have been purified and characterized in a broad range of invertebrates, but the group of millipedes calls attention since studies on the immune system are few and flawed. This work aims to better understanding the immune system of millipedes. For that I collected two populations of these animals, and separated into experimental and control groups. The experimental group, was challenged with a bacterial solution, and the control group was “challenged” with saline solution. RF-HPLC analysis of full body extract indicated that the likely presence of bioactive molecules occurs during infection. I found two bioactive molecules, one in the full body extract, which is not a protein, and another in the plasma, which is a probable protein. This molecule has a mass of 2368.69Da with no hemolytic action and is similar to a hemocianin fragment of the spiders.

A NOVEL NON-INVASIVE DETECTION FOR COLON CANCER USING BACTERIAL BIOMARKER F. NUCLEATUM
Syed Shadman Hossain
Herndon High School, Herndon, VA

Colon cancer, once detected early, is highly curable. However, customary methods of detection such as colonoscopies are invasive, expensive, not able to detect some polyps and tumors, and return false-positive results. Thus, many patients are diagnosed when the cancer has progressed to its deadliest stages when there is a 5-year survival rate of only 6%. A novel non-invasive test is described as a simple, inexpensive, and new method for screening of colon cancer. Bacterial strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Listeria monocytogenes were cultured. Caco-2 human colon cancer cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) + 21% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) media. 5mL of Caco-2 supernatant media and 5mL of DMEM + 21% FBS media were extracted and put into two separate 15mL tubes in which appropriate amounts of F. nucleatum was added to initialize an Optical Density(OD) of 0.1. Tubes were incubated for 24 hours. Eight experimental trials were run for F. nucleatum. A similar procedure with two trials was followed for L. monocytogenes. Following the 24-hour growth period, the OD of the trials were generated, and an average was calculated. The presence of F. nucleatum was 4.33 times more in supernatant Caco-2 media (Average OD: 0.554) than regular media (Average OD: 0.128). The average OD of L. monocytogenes remained about the same in both types of media. It was concluded that F. nucleatum favors the secretions (cytokines/chemokines) from the Caco-2 cells by having a larger presence in the Caco-2 supernatant. This novel test for detecting colon cancer is fast, non-invasive, and costs $0.

COMMON TARGETING OF EPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS MICRORNA BART1-3P AND HUMAN MICRORNA MIR-29A: IMPLICATIONS IN EBV-LINKED LYMPHOMA
Tejas Govind Sundaresan
North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, Durham, NC

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a prevalent herpesvirus that causes lymphoma in individuals with compromised immune systems. A growing problem in impoverished regions, EBV expresses microRNAs, short regulatory RNAs that suppress complementary messenger RNAs through a mechanism largely dictated by the “seed region”. In this investigation, we tested whether two cancer-associated microRNAs, EBV BART1-3p and human miR-29a, which possess identical seed sequences, regulate common targets in vitro. MicroRNA expression vectors and luciferase indicator plasmids were cloned for miR-29a, obtained for BART1-3p, and then incorporated into a luciferase reporter assay. We determined that both miR-29a and BART1-3p downregulated each others’ indicators (p < 0.05), which suggests that they can target similarly in the cell. Thus, this study’s findings support the hypothesis that EBV’s oncogenic properties derive from its functional mimicry of cellular microRNAs, and that correcting for this mimicry could present new ways to mitigate EBV-linked lymphoma.

A NOVEL PENTAMERIC MODEL OF THE T4 BACTERIOPHAGE GENOME PACKAGING MOTOR AND A MEANS OF DISRUPTING ITS MECHANISM
Raghu Vamsi Dhara
Mission San Jose High School, Fremont, CA

Due to the widespread and destructive nature of viruses, it is of great interest to researchers to elucidate the mechanisms that underlie their function. Of particular interest is the manner in which viruses package their genetic material, which a key step in the infection process. Little is known about exactly how viruses accomplish this task, a gap this project attempts to address. The T4 bacteriophage is a dsDNA virus that is known to use an assembly of motor proteins for genetic translocation. The structure of a subunit of the T4’s motor has been recently determined using X-ray crystallographic techniques, allowing us to more closely analyze three distinct yet intertwined aspects of viral function. The first phase of the project was to create a refined model of the packaging motor. Using Java code, molecular visualizers, and an approximate initial conformation, a stable pentameric structure that met theoretical and experimental criteria was designed. In phase two, a mechanism that described how the DNA was being translocated by the motor was developed using known constraints as well phase one’s model. Phase two was accomplished using biomolecular simulations and packages. In the final phase, a molecule that would effectively disable viral function by interfering with its mechanism is proposed. This “phospholamban cap” was found using rigid-body docking software. This project has potential in both medicine and nanotechnology – the drug molecule proposed can be refined to produce antiviral medications, and future nanomachines can utilize the elegant mechanism described in phase two for medial pore translocation.

BACILLUS IN DEFENSE OF THE CHICKPEA PLANTS AGAINST FUSARIUM OXYSPORUM CICERIS
Diana Laura Barraza Villarreal
Centro de Ciencias de Sinaloa- Apoyo a Sobresalientes en el Estado de Sinaloa, Culiacan, MEXICO

The culture of chick-pea in Sinaloa, Mexico is affected by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum ciceris (FOC), that causes yellowish coloration and withering. This work contains information about bacteria that control the growth of the fungus, and are useful for the manufacture of products that likely protect the plant. Laboratory tests in confrontation were realized in microbiological culture media PDA and Nutritive Agar, with four bacterial isolates of Bacillus subtilis (T442, M175, T46, M14-1) against FOC, cause of the disease of chick-pea known as "Rabies". Only isolated T442, and M175 showed an antagonist effect towards the fungus, limiting its growth. It was realized a test in greenhouse with pots, using the bacterial agents who turned out to be positive in its antagonist activity, comparing them with the application of a fungicide, where protective effects appeared in plants for used microorganisms; these indicated us the possibility of its future utilization to elaborate biological control products.

Topicality.<br><br>Hypersaline deep-sea lakes are one of the most unexplored planet's ecosystems. They are characterized by high salinity, high pressure, lack of oxygen and sunlight. Organisms of such environments have a unique metabolism. Studying of the diversity and physiology of these microorganisms is important from theoretical and practical points of view.<br><br>Using molecular methods of identification the following results were obtained:<br><br>1) Two libraries of clones were obtained during analysis: lake Tyro (24 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), 10 classes) and sea water (6 OTUs, 2 classes of eubacteria). <br><br>2) The most abundant classes were: gamma-, delta-, epsilon- Proteobacteria, which is in agreement with previous reports about bacteria in brines of Mediterranean Sea. <br><br>3) The number of clones was not sufficient to obtain stable estimates of diversity, the analysis require additional data. <br><br>4) The diversity of bacteria was unexpectedly high in brine but not in the seawater, due to more diverse ion composition. <br><br>5) Most of detected bacteria in the deep-sea lake belonged to the previously undiscribed (18,75%) bacteria or had an unusual metabolism (43,75%).<br><br>6) DNA was extracted from Urania (viruses). And phoresis showed that it can be virus’s DNA.<br><br>The analysis demonstrated unexpectedly high diversity of halophilic bacteria inhabiting Tyro lake. Most of bacteria presented in brine water had unique and uncommon characteristics based on information about its closest relatives. Therefore, the deep-sea hypersaline lakes of Mediterranean Sea have great potential for further investigations. Also the DNA that can be virus’s DNA was extracted first time from deep basins.

AUTISM AND GUT MICROBIOME: IS THERE A LINK?
Kamran Jamil
The Bishop's School, La Jolla, CA

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) now affect 1 in 88 children in the U.S and cost $35 billion annually. Although, both genes and environment are well established risks, however neither a single gene defect nor an environmental factor has yet been found to produce ASD. The gut microbiome contains up to 10^15 bacteria which produce an array of bioactive metabolic products capable of entering systemic circulation and can have profound effects on host metabolism and immune function in many organ systems, including the brain. Maladapted microbiome has been implicated in diseases such as colon cancer, obesity and diabetes. The hypothesis is that gut microbiome metabolite are different in autism compared with controls and that these can be used as an early screening tool. A well-established maternal immune activation (MIA) model of autism in C57BL/6J mice was used. Stool samples were collected from 4 month old male control and ASD (6 mice each). Concentration of 75 metabolites were quantified by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography and scheduled multiple reaction monitoring on mass spectroscopy. Data was analyzed using univariate and multivariate statistical tools implemented by Metaboanalyst 2.0. Strong metabolic differences between ASD and control mice were found. The metabolites increased in ASD microbiomes included nucleotides (GTP,Deoxyadenosine, Inosine, Hypoxanthine, & cAMP), sulfur-containing metabolites (Taurine),and tryptophan, nicotinamide & serotonin precursors. The health-associated metabolites that were decreased in the autism microbiomes included vitamin cofactors (Thiamine), & Krebs cycle precursors. One of the future direction is to use this metabolite trend as an early screening tool for ASD, as this disorder may take years to diagnose.

DISCOVERY OF NOVEL INFLUENZA ENDONUCLEASE INHIBITORS TO COMBAT FLU PANDEMIC
Eric Shu Chen
Canyon Crest Academy, San Diego, CA

Influenza pandemics remain a constant threat to public health. If the highly lethal avian influenza H5N1 or H7N9 acquires the ability of human to human transmission, it could cause a disaster like the 1918 Spanish flu, which killed 40 million people. Anti-flu drugs are crucial for treating patients before vaccines become available, but flu strains resistant to current drugs have emerged. Therefore, new anti-influenza drugs are urgently needed to prepare for impending flu pandemics.<br><br>Influenza endonuclease is well conserved and essential for viral propagation, so its inhibitors can potentially block any influenza virus. An interdisciplinary approach combining computational research with biological assays was implemented to expedite the discovery of new endonuclease inhibitors. Computer pharmacophore models were built and used for virtual screening of compound libraries. A fluorescence-based assay was set up to validate virtual screening hits as endonuclease inhibitors. In parallel, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and solvent mapping of the endonuclease were performed to construct a comprehensive database of binding pockets and druggable hot spots. Molecular docking of the new inhibitors to the PA endonuclease active sites revealed interacting residues. Structure and activity relationship analysis led to identification of more drug leads. <br><br>As a result, a number of new, potent and structurally diverse endonuclease inhibitors with great potential to be developed into new anti-influenza drugs have been identified. The structural study also provides valuable information for designing more potent inhibitors. Therefore, these findings will help combat influenza and save lives. A patent has been filed on my discovery.

GRAPEFRUIT SEED EXTRACT VS. PROTOZOA: STENTOR AND PARAMECIUM MULTIMICRONUCLEATUM
Nicole Lynn Sims
Sale Creek High School, Sale Creek, TN

The FDA has reported that a suspected 1/5 of the world's population is infected with protozoan disease. Grapefruit Seed Extract is known to be an Antimicrobial agent that provides exceeding amounts of benefits and uses including being an antiprotozoan. However, there is a controversy on how “natural” GSE really is because of a known preservative in GSE called Benzethonium Chloride that is suspected to be the cause of GSE's antimicrobial activity. Phase One of testing was performed to find the most accurate concentration of GSE to provide to best kill times of the Stentor and Paramecium Multimicronucleatum. Five concentrations of GSE and distilled water as a control were introduced to the Protozoa and the kill times were recorded. Phase two was performed to determine the antimicrobial activity in the commercial brand GSE by engineering a pure, homemade GSE without the added preservative. Different procedures and modifications were used to create a GSE like “tea” and the pure extract was tested on the Paramecium. The results gathered for phase one suggested that the most accurate concentration was the 10 drops of GSE to 100 milliliters and 5 drops of GSE to 100 milliliters; which were similar to the recommended serving of 5 to 15 drops per every eight fluid ounces. The results for phase two showed no antimicrobial activity with the homemade GSE which suggests that the antimicrobial activity evident in the commercial GSE was due to the added preservative.

MALATHION AS A MODEL COMPOUND FOR THE DEGRADATION OF THE NERVE AGENT VX
Karthik Balaji Chakravarthy
Beavercreek High School, Beavercreek, OH

Degradation of the toxic nerve agent VX in the event of a chemical contamination could avert a severe crisis. However, VX’s hazardous properties restrict testing and decomposition methodologies. To overcome this challenge, the organophosphate pesticide malathion was used as model compound due to similar biological structures and reduced toxicity to mammals than VX. The important structural similarity involves the phosphate group, located in both VX and malathion, which if degraded by a phosphorus utilizing bacteria such as Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes, could degrade the compound and decrease toxicity. This research focused on inserting a kanamycin resistance transposon gene into the genomic DNA of P. pseudoalcaligenes, analyzing the clones’ growth on kanamycin and malathion based media, and then extracting, sequencing, and identifying the malathion-utilizing plasmid. It was hypothesized that bacterial clones (containing kanamycin resistance gene) would grow on kanamycin media but no longer utilize malathion as a phosphorus source, therefore selecting essential gene knockout clones. Also, the recovered P. pseudoalcaligenes gene would resemble phosphotriesterase sequences - an organophosphate degrading enzyme. The procedure involved transposon electroporation of cells, clone growth on kanamycin and malathion media, specific clone DNA isolation, DNA digestion and ligation, DNA electroporation into E. coli cells, and plasmid isolation and sequencing from the cells. The bioinformatics analysis results indicated 84% homology between P. pseudoalcaligenes gene and C1SA, a mouse protein gene bearing resemblance to phosphotriesterase. In conclusion, P. pseudoalcaligenes gene matched phosphotriesterase, confirming the hypothesis. These instrumental findings could identify potential bacterial genes to break down malathion and eventually degrade VX.

BACTERIAL BETA-GALACTOSIDASE ENZYME-PRODRUG THERAPY: A NEW APPROACH AGAINST COLON CANCER 
Vanna Nga Hovanky
James Bowie High School, Austin, TX

Colon cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. Gene therapy is an emerging topic in cancer research, but the viral gene therapy explored today holds drawbacks such as safety concerns and high cost. E.coli beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) converts the nontoxic prodrug Daun02 into a drug that may kill cancer cells. The major goal of this project is to propose and test a novel bacterial beta-gal enzyme-prodrug treatment against colon cancer. The main experiment was the MTT assay, of which 4 trials were performed. Yeast acted as the eukaryotic cell model for cancer cells. E.coli were transformed with plasmid DNA containing the beta-gal gene. The amount of absorbance at 570 nm in the samples correlates to the amount of purple formazan product converted from MTT dye by living cells. Lower absorbencies indicate yeast cell death. The hypothesis was that if E.coli expressing the beta-gal enzyme are added to yeast with Daun02, then there will be a decreased number of living yeast model cells as indicated by a decrease in absorbance. The greatest difference between average absorbencies were between the control yeast sample (average absorbance of 1.560) and the yeast sample treated with the beta-gal expressing-bacteria and 2.5 μM Daun02 (average absorbance of 0.814). The data demonstrate the decrease in yeast model cell survival in beta-gal enzyme-prodrug therapy treated samples. This research may reveal the promise of a potentially low-risk, cost-effective, and successful alternative approach to treat colon cancer with bacterial beta-gal enzyme-prodrug therapy.

THE POWER OF MORINGA FLOWERS
Aliyah Alexa Allick
The Good Hope School, Frederiksted, VIRGIN ISLANDS

In today’s world we are constantly trying to stay one step ahead of bacteria, but what if I told you the secret to this just might be sitting in your backyard. This secret I’m referring to is the flower of the Moringa oleifera and the antibacterial properties it exhibits against a wide range of hand bacteria, E.coli and B.subtilis. The purpose of this project is to determine the effectiveness of Moringa oleifera extract as an antimicrobial for the hands and to determine if it is more effective than hand sanitizers containing Triclosan. Triclosan commonly used in household products and happens to be a probable carcinogen. My procedure included a three-step process, and four trials were done to ensure consistency and to narrow down the extracts based on the effectiveness of the extract. The first step of my procedure was creating the extracts, the second part was preparing the bacteria. Finally a Halo Disk Assay was done and the results were recorded. The general trend found was the flower water extract worked the best when compared to all other extracts. In conclusion, I don’t believe I have found a viable alternative to Triclosan due to the fact that flower water did not perform at an equal level or better than the soap or hand wash containing Triclosan. However, further studies can be done to isolate and identify the antibacterial compound in the Moringa and why is it concentrated in some plant parts and not others.

SITE-DIRECTED MUTAGENESIS OF THE METAL-REDUCING BACTERIUM S. ONEIDENSIS MR-1: A NOVEL STRATEGY FOR GENETIC ENGINEERING IN RECALCITRANT MICROORGANISMS
David Masao Zimmerman
Brentwood School, Los Angeles, CA

Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 is widely employed as a model organism for the study of subsurface bioremediation and electricity production in microbial fuel cells. However, its usefulness as a model organism is limited by recalcitrance to classical techniques of genetic engineering. My objective was to implement a strategy for site-directed mutagenesis of the MR-1 chromosome independent of exogenous recombinase functions; to assess and optimize this utility for the construction of point substitutions and large deletions by examining strand-, site- and sequence-specific effects. Competent cells were electroporated with DNA oligonucleotides (oligos) that contained the desired sequence alterations (conferring drug resistance) flanked by homology to the target loci. Recombination frequencies were determined by plating on selective media while controlling for basal mutation rate, with subsequent restriction-fragment analysis to confirm presence of the intended genotype. Point substitutions were achieved at frequencies of 10^-8 to 10^-7, with a lagging-strand bias (p < 0.05). Oligos with 1 silent base change designed to evade mismatch repair (MMR) enhanced the efficiency by ~10-fold (p < 0.05), but oligos with 2 MMR-refractory modifications decreased the efficiency (p < 0.1). Although the drug resistance assay was not sensitive enough to detect oligo-mediated knockouts, PCR amplification revealed that a minority of isolates contained the intended deletion. These findings greatly expand the molecular toolkit for rational manipulation of Shewanella spp. and have broad applicability to other recalcitrant microbes. Ongoing work involves use of long ssDNA substrates to mediate insertion of marker cassettes, obviating the need for mutations that confer selectable traits in themselves.

DETERMINING ANTIMICROBIAL AND SYNERGISTIC PROPERTIES OF SELECT PLANT ESSENTIAL OILS AGAINST CLINICAL ISOLATES OF GRAM-POSITIVE STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS AND GRAM-NEGATIVE ESCHERICHIA COLI: PHASE II
Bryant Jo Heckart
Seneca High School, Seneca, MO

Antimicrobial resistance is a worldwide epidemic that continues to spread out of control. Many bacterial strains such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae continue to thrive in healthcare and community settings as they develop mechanisms enabling resistance to antibiotic therapies. Researchers around the globe are searching for a solution to this worsening problem, and many advocate that utilizing antimicrobials derived from plant sources is a potential option for annihilating resistant microbes.<br><br>In this second-year study, the in vitro activities of select plant essential oils were observed to determine their potential as antimicrobial agents, both alone and in conjunction with common antibiotics, against clinical isolates of gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative Escherichia coli. Dilutions were made of each essential oil to determine minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranges. Part one results were determined by colony counts and comparisons were made between the experimental and control groups to indicate the antimicrobial properties of each essential oil. Part one results determined that all essential oils displayed antimicrobial properties and that results ranged from minimal to complete inhibition. Part two results were determined by zones of inhibition and comparisons were made between the experimental and control groups to indicate synergistic properties of each essential oil and antibiotic combination. Part two results determined that essential oil and antibiotic combinations exhibited mixed results of synergism, as results showed a decrease, an increase, and no change in bacterial susceptibility. MIC ranges also varied for both part one and part two of this experimentation.

COMPARATIVE IN VITRO ANTIMICROBIAL EFFICACIES OF POLYPHENOL EXTRACTS ON NON-PATHOGENIC BACTERIA AND MRSA AND MSSA
Jeffrey Gage Holleman
Cascia Hall Preparatory School, Tulsa, OK

Polypheonol extracts show a promising novel solution to the growing multi-drug resistance problem in bacteria. This research provides evidence for the potential of Green Tea, Grape Seed Extract, and Propolis to inhibit bacterial growth, increase antibtiotic sensitivity, and inhibit the formation of biofilms. Concentrations of 10% Ethanol extracts of each polyphenol were evaluated for efficacy in dilutions to 1 x 10-5. Cultures of E. coli, B. subtilis, MRSA and MSSA were evaluated. 24 hour cultures, OD 0.1, were plated on Mueller-Hinton Agar and each polyphenol was evaluated for MIC using a standard macrodilution assay. Additionally, all cultures were evaluated for antibiotic sensitivity to Chloramphenicol, Penicillin, Vancomycin, Erythromycin, Tetracycline, and Neomycin. Sensitivity was also evaluated using Polyphenol enhanced MH plates for synergistic effects. Finally, polyphenol extracts were diluted in a 96 well plate,innoculted with cultures (OD 0.1), and allowed to grow at 37 C for 24 hours to determine the effects of polyphenols on biofilm formation using a standard crystal violet assay and a plate reader(600 nm). Significance with a p value less than 0.05 were determined for 21 of the test comparisions in the antibiotic sensitivity tests indicating the presence of polyphenols in the agar increased the efficacy of most of the antibiotics tested. Data strongly supports the claim that polyphenols will inhibit biofilm formation for all bacteria tested. Propolis, Grape Seed extract and Green Tea were effective at biofilm prevention to concentrations of 1 x 10-3 to 1 x 10-5. Results strongly suggest the use of polyphenol extracts as novel chemotherapeutic agents.

THE EFFECT OF BENZOQUINONE ON THE GROWTH OF BACILLUS SUBTILIS
Jacob McKinney Smith
Cascade High School, Wartrace, TN

The purpose of the experiment was to determine if benzoquinones have antibiotic properties- benzoquinones specifically from millipede (Narceus gordanus) secretions. Ten petri dishes were labeled: one as control, three as bacteria alone, three as bacteria and benzoquinones, and three as bacteria with secretion. An incubator was set to 30⁰ Celsius, and the control was placed inside upside down. A 1:10 solution of 2,6-Dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone to water was made. All of the petri dishes except for the control were streaked with bacteria (Bacilus subtilus) while wearing gloves. A swab was soaked in the benzoquinone solution and lightly spread along the bacteria streak in the benzoquinones dishes. Separate swabs were used for each plate. Swabs rubbed along the millipedes collected secretions and were then spread over the bacteria in the secretions plates. Petri dishes were then set upside down in the incubator. Number of colonies that grew over two days was recorded. <br><br> No bacteria grew in the control plate. In the plates with bacteria alone, bacteria grew in thick lawns wherever it was streaked. An average of five colonies grew on each plate with benzoquinones. The plates swabbed with millipede secretion grew an average 155 colonies with around four lawns; however, microbes other than the streaked bacteria were observed.<br><br> The hypothesis was supported because the secretion did inhibit the growth of some of the Bacilus subtilus. Research grade benzoquinone proved effective at inhibiting bacterial growth. This investigation should be repeated with a different method of gathering secretion to avoid introducing other microbes.

MAPPING PHOSPHORYLATION SITES NECESSARY FOR LARGE T-ANTIGEN PROTEIN EXPRESSION
Biruktawit Mesfin Assefa
H-B Woodlawn Secondary Program, Arlington, VA

In 2008, it was discovered that Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) is the main culprit behind 80% of metastatic Merkel Cell Carcinoma. Evidence has shown that MCV encodes for a protein called large T antigen, an essential component of the viral replication process. This project describes the phosphorylization sites necessary for large T antigen stability and function. <br><br> DNA mapping was utilized to gain a relative idea of the locations of said phosphorylation sites. Next, mutagenesis was performed on four different motifs that contain the majority of the phosphorylization sites on the large T-antigen to isolate their functions. A truncation mutation was executed on three different sites on said oncoprotein to locate the sites vital for large T-antigen stabilization. The resulting constructs were 516 base pairs, 390 base pairs, and 345 base pairs. These inserts were ligated into vectors 1038 and 2956 and expressed in eukaryotic cells. The resulting samples were then run on a western blot to analyze protein expression. Although the result calls for more confirmation, there is promise that the phosphorylation site found between the 516 base pairs and the 390 base pairs could be critical due to significant protein expression discrepancies between those two base pairs. This finding provides an improved idea of the phosphorylization sites and the motifs responsible for large T antigen stability and correct function which in turn could lead to locating a possible target for therapeutic drugs.

RETT SYNDROME: DETERMINING THE OPTIMAL VIRAL SYSTEM FOR GENE THERAPY
Meera Radha Srinivasan
Interlake High School, Bellevue, WA

Rett Syndrome is a single-gene disorder caused by silencing of the Mecp2 gene, located along the X-chromosome. This silencing mechanism shares many proteins involved in X-inactivation. By identifying proteins involved in X-activation and then knocking them down through viral gene therapy, the Rett phenotype can be reversed. The purpose of this experiment was to determine the optimal viral system for delivering potential knockdown mechanisms in both brain and fibroblast cells. These cell types were selected since the neuromuscular phenotype is pronounced in Rett’s syndrome. The experiment was conducted by transfecting HEK293 cells with the GIPZ (lentiviral) and MSCV (retroviral) plasmids to create the viral delivery systems. These plasmids contained the GFP marker. Then, brain and fibroblast cells were infected with both these viruses in different concentrations (0 µl, 250 µl, 500 µl). To determine which viral system was the most effective, cells were imaged for GFP fluorescence and also processed with flow cytometry. Results demonstrate that for both cell types, MSCV (retroviral) system is optimal for infection. These results are relevant and useful to researchers because utilizing the optimal viral delivery system can enhance the knockdown of desired genes. This in turn, can aid in finding a cure for Rett’s Syndrome via viral gene therapy.

THE ROAD TO NOVEL ANTIBIOTICS
Sarah Julia Hyslop
Bishop Carroll High School, Calgary, CANADA

There is an urgent need for novel classes of antibiotics as most species of bacteria have at least one antibiotic resistance gene, resulting in the bacteria being almost impossible to eradicate. It is essential that novel antibiotics be developed to combat the increasing threat from multi-drug resistant bacteria. The purpose of this experiment was to determine if potential novel classes of antibiotics could be identified by analyzing Pseudomonas aeruginosa gene expression in response to 13 antimicrobial substances. These were 9 chemical compounds, 3 plant tinctures (Uva ursi, Barberry, Goldenseal), and silver nitrate. The 13 antimicrobial substances and 14 antibiotics were tested against 96 mutated strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Each strain had been mutated to produce light when one specific gene was expressed. This allowed for the determination of which genes were affected by each substance. Cluster analyses were run on the results to determine statistically similar patterns of gene expression. The plant tinctures had methods of action similar to that of Kanamycin, an aminoglycoside, indicating their potential as novel antibiotics. The nine antimicrobial chemicals were sorted into two statistically distinct groups from the antibiotics tested, based on variation in gene expression. This indicates that they form two potential novel classes of antibiotics, with modes of action distinct from the tested antibiotics. This is a novel experiment as the antimicrobial substances have not previously been analyzed for their genomic effects and the mutant Pseudomonas aeruginosa has not previously been used as an indicator of gene expression.

THE EXPRESSION, PURIFICATION, AND CHARACTERIZATION OF THE OMCE PROTEIN TO DETERMINE ITS ROLE IN THE MEMBRANE ELECTRON TRANSFER
Bader Abdalhameed Almubarak
Dhahran Ahliyya School, Dammam, SAUDI ARABIA

The pathway of electron transfer reactions (ETRs) ensured by Geobacter sulfurreducens's outer surface c-type cytochromes has been identified in previous studies. Geobacter sulfurreducens has been one of the most widely studied microorganisms capable of electricity generation for use in Microbial Fuel Cells. The chemistry of these ETRs needs to be thoroughly investigated in order to understand how this process can be efficiently reversed and utilized for energy storage. This study is aimed at expressing, purifying, and characterizing the OmcE protein, one of G. sulfurreducens' cytochrome c-type proteins, with the goal of understanding its role in the ETRs. The OmcE protein was cloned into the expression vector pET303-HisCT, has been expressed in a strain of E. coli (BL21), and attempts to purify it were made using His-tag purification and Ultrafiltration. Characterization was tested through oxydo-reduction. The heme-function was proven present in the purified fractions, and the OmcE protein did have a peak of UV-Visible light absorption at 407nm (when oxidized) and 417nm (when reduced), characteristic of heme groups. The OmcE protein in the purified fractions was identified and proven present (100%) via mass spectrometry yet likely to be associated with some other interesting proteins, including a Major Outer Membrane lipoprotein. The implications of this study will lead to integration with the comprehensive Bio-CCC (Biological carbon capture and conversion) project which is investigating possibilities to convert excess electric energy (e.g. from photovoltaics during the day) into hydrocarbons, which can serve to store and transport energy inexpensively and efficiently.

THE UTILITY OF USTILAGO BULLATA TO CONTROL CHEATGRASS INVASIONS, PHASE II
Stacia Lynn Hill
Big Sky High School, Missoula, MT

Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) is an invasive species of grass found throughout the intermountain west of the United States, and is controlled by the use of herbicides, tillage, or burning which is damaging to the surrounding environment. Cheatgrass populations exist on MPG Ranch, a conservation property in western Montana. Some populations of cheatgrass are infected with the fungi Ustilago bullata (commonly head smut) which prevents the development of seeds in cheatgrass. A better understanding of U. bullata and the relationship between the fungi and cheatgrass could lead to the utilization of U. bullata as a biological control agent for cheatgrass.<br><br>Some populations of cheatgrass on MPG Ranch are more heavily infected with U. bullata than others, which could be explained by differences in the fungal endophyte community of various cheatgrass populations. PCR and 454-sequencing were methods used to assess the fungal endophyte community of cheatgrass populations by identifying fungal species present in cheatgrass samples and looking at relationships between the presence of certain fungal endophytes in specific plants and the present or absence of U. bullata in those plants. Some endophytes in cheatgrass may play a role in whether or not cheatgrass becomes infected with U. bullata, and therefore loses the ability to reproduce through seeds.

A SHELF-LIFE STUDY OF 3 POPULAR RICE RECIPES WITH NATURAL ANTIMICROBIAL COMPOUNDS AS ALTERNATIVE EMERGENCY FOOD PRODUCTS
Sarah Ariyan Sakha
Xavier College Preparatory School, Phoenix, AZ

With the increasing number of humanitarian emergencies, there is a prevalent need for food relief, typically provided in the form of Emergency Food Products (EFPs). Lentil rice (Middle East), Mujaddara rice (Middle East), and Jollof rice (Africa) were tested to determine which popular regional rice recipe, or which combination of spice(s), yields the greatest antimicrobial activity and longest shelf-life. The Mujaddara recipe was hypothesized to pose the greatest potential. As a part of comprehensive microbiological testing, the products were vacuum-packaged, stored at room temperature, and tested for Aerobic Plate Count (APC), yeasts/mold, total coliforms/Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus, using four different microbiological tests. At 1, 2, and 3 weeks, a sample from each product was added to nutrient broth and incubated for 24 hours. Serial dilutions were then performed and plated to attain countable colonies. The results yielded a shelf-life of 2 weeks for Mujadarra and Jollof rice. Lentil rice, however, yielded fungal growth. The results suggest EFP viability for Mujaddara and Jollof rice, while casting doubt on the viability of the lentil rice recipe. Ubiquitously, though, no growth of coliforms or Staphylococcus was observed. The data manifests the antimicrobial activity of natural compounds and point to the viability of a marketable product that is cost-efficient, regionally and culturally acceptable, nutritious, palatable, and long-lasting, spans a large geographic area, and targets areas of the world in need, to provide an alternative to the dry bar or biscuit traditionally used today as an EFP in emergencies requiring immediate food relief.

SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING THE CONCENTRATION OF CELLULOSIC ETHANOL USING CEDECEA DAVISAE
Abigail Lyn Walling
Iowa City West High School, Iowa City, IA

The purpose of this experiment was to isolate and identify the naturally occurring bacterium that ferments grass. I hypothesized that if I concentrated this bacterium, then I could increase the yield of cellulosic ethanol. The first step was to create four grass samples containing 70 grams of Kentucky Blue Grass and 10 grams of distilled water. Two of the samples were allowed to ferment due to the addition of 5 grams of cellulase, while the others were the control. When plating the samples on agar plates, there was one dominant strain of bacteria on the control. However, there were three main colonies of bacteria on the fermented samples. Each colony was isolated, concentrated in LB broth, and inoculated into four separate autoclaved grass and water samples. After allowing these samples to mature, they were tested using a GC-MS. I found that two of the samples fermented, producing a yield of 4600 mg/L and 5600 mg/L ethanol, while the others did not react. The bacteria colonies were then identified using DNA sequencing. The strain able to produce 4600 mg/L ethanol was Cedecea davisae. This bacterium was concentrated and inoculated into three grass, water, and cellulase samples, while three samples acted as a control. After the samples fermented and were tested, I found that Cedecea davisae produced an average of 24,168 mg/L while the control only had 1,655 mg/L ethanol. Therefore, I isolated a bacteria strain that increases the yield of cellulosic ethanol by 1900 percent.

PROBIOTICS: THE STOOL SOLUTION?
Madelyn Faith Lucas
Farmington High School, Farmington, NM

The purpose of this project was to determine whether probiotics can actually survive the journey through the digestive system and still inhibit growth of bacteria harmful to the digestive system, and if so, determine which ones do.<br><br> The hypothesis was that if orally administered probiotics, such as Kefir, Activia yogurt, and Acidophilus probiotic tablets are tested in different pH environments under lab conditions as those found in the stomach and small intestine, the probiotics will not only survive, but they will inhibit the growth of non-pathogenous E. coli. <br><br> One of the goals of this experiment was to create a virtual stomach. During the experiment, the researcher combined ingredients usually found in the human stomach, including enzymes and acids, and daily probiotics, and mixed these together under lab conditions to create a virtual stomach. These ingredients were placed in a shaker incubator for a total of six hours to represent the mixing around of the ingredients of the stomach. After this, the mixtures were plated onto agar plates and incubated for 24 hours at 37ºC.<br><br> The results showed that there was a great amount of growth on the plates for Kefir and Activia®, but not the probiotic tablets. When the bacteria was identified in a test with multiple types of agar, the results showed that a large amount of gram-negative bacteria, most likely E. coli in this case, grew in the Kefir mixture. A very small amount of bacteria grew on the plates of the probiotic tablet mixture, and the researcher later found out that the type of bacteria that did grow was gram-positive.<br><br> The researcher concluded that her hypothesis was accepted because the growth of E. coli was inhibited when tested against probiotic tablets.

HOW DO PROBIOTIC BACTERIA COMMUNICATE WITH THE HOST?
Sarah Joyce Flaherty
Westdale Secondary School, Hamilton, CANADA

Probiotics are microorganisms which, when ingested live, confer a health benefit on the host. Therapeutic and dietary applications of probiotics are an area of current investigation and the mechanisms by which beneficial effects occur remain largely unclear. The probiotic bacterium lactobacillus rhamnosus JB-1 (JB-1) is known to stimulate a heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and interleukin 10 (IL-10) dependent increase in regulatory T cells in the gastrointestinal tract. One novel communication pathway between cells is the transfer of microvesicles (MVs), small membrane sacs which bud from a cell bearing cellular components. This project investigates the role of MVs in communication between JB-1 and dendritic cells (DCs). Mouse DCs were co-cultured with JB-1, with conditioned medium of JB-1 and with two concentrations of JB-1 derived MVs. DC expression of HO-1 and IL-10 was analyzed using flow cytometry. MVs were found to dose-dependently instigate the same HO-1 response as JB-1 and the conditioned medium. This is the first time that MVs have been shown to play such a role. However, MVs did not stimulate the same IL-10 response as JB-1 or the conditioned medium regardless of concentration. This indicates that MVs from JB-1 can promote DC immunoregulatory function via HO-1 expression, but that MVs alone do not mediate all aspects of the responses to JB-1 and the products secreted by JB-1. This insight could facilitate eventual isolation of the molecules responsible for HO-1 and IL-10 upregulation in DCs, with potential applications in the refinement of existing treatments, drug development and commercial probiotic product design.

BACTERICIDAL EFFECTS OF THE EXTRACTS OF EACH ALOE VERA, CUCUMBER (CUCUMIS SATIVUS), HONEY AND MILK ON STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS BACTERIUM
Angel R. Rodriguez
Ruben Rodriguez Figueroa, Naranjito, PUERTO RICO

In ancient times natural medicine used accessible home remedies. Aloe vera was used to cure skin infections, honey was used as a disinfectant and cucumber and milk were used as skin hydrators. Staphylococcus aureus is a very harmful and extremely resistant to antibiotics bacterium, accountable for skin infections. The purpose of this investigation is to identify if extracts of each Aloe vera, Cucumber (Cucumis sativus), honey and milk have bactericide actions on Staphylococcus aureus. The hypothesis under study was:<br><br> The extracts of each Aloe vera, cucumber (Cucumis sativus), honey and milk will have different bactericide properties on Staphylococcus aureus bacterium. Aloe vera extract will have the highest effectiveness followed by honey, cucumber and milk. <br><br>To confirm the hypothesis, Staphylococcus aureus bacteria were placed in four Petri dishes containing agar nutrient. Subsequently, extracts of each Aloe vera, cucumber, honey and milk were prepared and a sterile disk was moistened with them separately. The plates were placed in an incubator at 37 Celsius degrees during 24 hours. Afterwards, the inhibition area for each extract was measured. It was found that honey is the most bactericide substance of all four, then Aloe vera and finally cucumber and milk which have no bactericide effects on Staphylococcus aureus. The objective of finding natural products with medical properties and are accessible, inexpensive and without side effects was achieved. It was concluded that each of these four extracts have different bactericide effects on Staphylococcus aureus but the order of the effectiveness was different from the one proposed.

BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN IN VITRO AND IN VIVO
Kevin James Cyr
Clear Lake High School, Houston, TX

Purpose:<br><br>Currently, the production of new pharmaceuticals is an inefficient process that results in many promising new treatments wasting away in the pharmaceutical “valley of death”. This inefficiency originates from the imprecise testing models which are used to evaluate new pharmaceuticals. The present testing models fail to accurately represent the human body. Thus, the focus of this project was to create tissue-engineered human lung models that serve as accurate representations of the human respiratory system. Due to their humanoid qualities, tissue-engineered models could supplement or replace current in vitro and in vivo testing models, accelerating the pharmaceutical development process.<br><br>Methods:<br><br>In this experiment, three different tissue-engineered lung models were fabricated using acellular lung matrices. Each model was recellularized inside a bioreactor chamber with human fibroblast stem cells. After 8 weeks, samples were evaluated for cell viability using fluorescent DAPI staining. Additionally, this assay reports the first reconstituted innate immune response in a tissue-engineered model. This was achieved by implanting the models with CFSE tagged macrophages and then exposing them to an inactivated FITC Influenza A pathogen, simulating an infection.<br><br>Conclusion:<br><br>Conclusive bronchiole and connective tissue formations were reproduced in two of the models. The successful formation of bronchioles, along with the reconstitution of an innate immune response, suggests that these models exhibit characteristics similar to the characteristics of a normal human lung. Potentially, tissue-engineered models could drastically accelerate the entire pharmaceutical development process, resulting in faster discovery of treatments and lower prescription costs for the consumer.

MICROWIRE BIOSENSOR: NOVEL DETECTION OF ESCHERICHIA COLI
Ariana Hyo Jin Kim
Saint Andrew's Priory School, Honolulu, HI

Outbreaks of foodborne illness linked to pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli have attracted increasing public attention. Traditional culture-based methods for pathogens identification are time-consuming and labor-intensive, raising the need for fast and sensitive detection techniques. <br><br>A novel, rapid detection method for E. coli performed by a functionalized microwire sensor was developed and evaluated. A gold-tungsten microwire immobilized with anti-E. coli-antibodies was used to capture E. coli bacterial cells. Cell suspension with dielectrophoretic force generated by an alternating current with an electric field was used. Immobilization of antibodies using conventional methods is non-compatible with the DEP driven electric field, challenging the surface functionalization. <br><br>Therefore, this study was aimed to develop a microwire sensor based on DEP and antigen-antibody reaction for pathogen detection and evaluate the sensor’s performance to detect Escherichia coli K-12 from a liquid sample. Then, a test was done to see if the wire was specific to Escherichia coli, or other possible foodborne pathogens. The results showed that the wire is indeed specific to Escherichia coli, after Stahpylococcus aureus had insignificantly appeared on the wire compared to the significant results of Escherichia coli.<br><br>The microwire was manipulated by an automated xyz stage and the sensing process included antibodies immobilization, bacteria detection and cells quantification. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope figures and fluorescence intensities of bacteria on the wire validated the sensing mechanism. The developed sensor demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity with fast detection rate, which shows a strong potential for the application in food industry.

TESTING ARTIFICIAL GENES DESIGNED TO INHIBIT THE GROWTH OF E. COLI AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO TRADITIONAL ANTIBIOTICS
Logan Thrasher Collins
Fairview High School, Boulder, CO

The CDC states “antibiotic resistance is one of the world's most pressing public health threats”. Through mutation, bacteria too easily defeat traditional antibiotics by rendering their narrow attacks ineffective. This research explores a novel alternative to traditional antibiotics by specially designing artificial genes to broadly disrupt bacterial systems. Unnaturally high quantities of hydrophobic residues were used within the genes with the intention of causing uncontrolled aggregation, exhaustion of intercellular resources, and to overwhelm the chaperone systems. One sequence was highly hydrophobic (H) while the other was highly hydrophobic and highly acidic (HH). These genes were delivered to bacteria in pET11a plasmid vectors through artificial transformation. A liquid growth media experiment was conducted. Nine groups, based on the type of bacteria (H, HH, or untransformed) and the amount of IPTG used (1 mM, 0.1 mM, or none), were cultured and data was collected on their growth via spectrophotometry. Partial growth inhibition was observed in all the groups with IPTG. However, with the H gene at 1 mM IPTG, nearly total growth inhibition occurred. This novel antibiotic has great potential for combating bacterial resistance. Weakening the bacteria by this technique would likely allow the natural immune system to eradicate the remaining bacteria. Though artificial transformation is not a usable delivery system in the human body, promiscuous bacterial conjugation shows distinct possibilities for significantly enhancing the human bacterial flora’s effect on the immune system. Through further development of this technique, the presently grim future of bacterial infection and resistance could be significantly and positively altered.

Katarina Orsaghova, Maria Benova
Milan Rufus' Secondary Grammar School, Ziar nad Hronom, SLOVAKIA

Dust mite allergies present a serious health problem. To control dust mites in the households, several commercial products are used along with folk remedies based on herbs. In order to implement an „eco-friendly „approach, a use of the natural products able to get rid of them at lower concentrations would be the best alternative for dust mite elimination.<br><br> Main objective of the project was to detect the potential acaricidal effect of the three selected herbal extracts on two species of dust mites using laboratory biotests: Dermatophagoides farinae, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus. These mites were exposed to the extracts of the Lavandula angustifolia, Eucalyptus globulus and Azadirachta indica. The experiment was conducted using shut Petri dishes. A bottom of each dish was covered with a filter paper containing herbal extracts diluted in paraffin oil (decimal dilution, starting at 1 μ1 per cm2 up to 0,01 μ1 per cm2). The negative control filter papers received pure paraffin oil. Mite mortality and mobility was evaluated after tested extracts application and mites were subsequently observed under a stereomicroscope at a magnification of 30-80x. Our ten-month research was undertaken at the professional institute. <br><br>Based on the obtained results it can be said, that the aim of this work was fully completed, since all experiments were performed under appropriate conditions and the potential acaricidal effect of the selected herbs was detected. In our opinion, research in this area will remain interesting for many specialists, providing the potential for further scientific research. It has a widespread use in health protection and maintaining a healthy home environment.

ESTABLISHING THE SENSITIVITY & RELIABILITY OF MICROBIAL FORENSICS
Ashley Danielle Driver, Alexis Nesbitt
Rockdale Magnet School for Science and Technology, Conyers, GA

The purpose of this project was to determine how temperature change affects the bacterial growth patterns of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus salivarius, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Corynebacterium xerosis on four common surfaces (plastic, metal, wood, and glass). If fairly consistent patterns were deduced it could be inferred that apply microbial forensics to traditional forensics investigations would be viable at most temperatures. To test this, the four bacterial species, along with a control, were applied to the four surfaces at four different temperatures (10°C, 23°C, 28°C, and 37°C). To attempt to prove that the protocol of swabbing for bacteria could be performed while dusting for fingerprints, fingerprint powder was applied to subcultures of each bacterial species. Then 48 hours later the absorbance was measures and the samples were plated. The hypothesis, which stated that the changes in temperature would cause only minimal changes in growth patterns, was not fully supported. Results indicated that overall bacterial growth patterns were fairly consistent at the 10°C and 23°C temperatures. However, the growth did decrease some at the 37°C temperature. Although it did change, the pattern across the surfaces did remain rather consistent, indicating that the protocol could still be viable with further testing. Experimental error caused greater variation that expected at the 28°C temperature. The fingerprint powder testing revealed positive results. Growth was present on all plates indicating that the fingerprint powder did not significantly alter the bacterial growth. This implies that the protocol for collecting bacterial samples could be combined with the fingerprint dusting procedure.

METAGENOMIC ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY AND CHARACTERIZE ANTIBIOTIC PRODUCING MICROBES
Danielle Erin Terukina, Marc Siler
Mililani High School, Mililani, HI

Previously discovered was the presence of antibiotic producing Streptomyces in Hawaii by cultivating bacterium and exposing them to a series of testing against the pathogens E. coli, M. luteus, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus. 21-candidate bacterium inhibited selected pathogens. It was concluded that laboratory research on soil-born bacteria was a plausible way to discover and develop novel medicinal products.<br><br> Based on our previous results we hypothesized that if we cultivate bacterium from a variety of natural environments in Hawaii, then we will discover antibiotic producing bacteria that can be identified through PCR and electrophoresis and later utilized in the medicinal field to prevent and inhibit detrimental pathogens. This experiment was performed through serial dilution, primary screening against M. luteus, cross streaking, secondary testing against M. luteus, isolation of bacterium presenting antibacterial properties onto agar plates, exposure to pathogenic bacteria (E. coli, M.luteus, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus), select gram staining, polymerase chain reaction, gel electrophoresis, purification, quantification, synthesizing, sequencing, and BLASTing (identification). Our hypothesis was supported through experimentation. Results showed that PCR and gel electrophoresis on bacterium from soil and pond environments produced a concentration between 5.9 and 25.5 μg/mL of DNA. Once sequenced, the bacteria were identified as Bacilus pumilis, Bacilus thuringiensis, and Pseudomonas mendocina. Each is actively utilized to inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria. Bacilus pumilis is known posses antibacterial and antifungal properties. Bacilus thuringiensis is commonly used in insecticides. Certain strains produce crystals that have insecticidal qualities. Pseudomonas mendocina has yet to be utilized and further researched.

DELETION OF ENDONUCLEASE G DISRUPTS MITOCHONDRIAL HOMEOSTASIS AND LEADS TO REDUCED VIRULENCE IN THE HUMAN PROTOZOAN PARASITE LEISHMANIA MEXICANA
Neil Shivraj Davey, Katie Barufka
Montgomery Blair High School, Silver Spring, MD

Human leishmaniasis is a debilitating disease that affects millions of people worldwide and leads to approximately 60,000 deaths annually. There are currently no effective vaccines against any form of this disease. Endonuclease G (endoG) is a recently reported determinant of mitochondrial functions in humans; these mitochondrial activities are essential for survival of infectious Leishmania parasites in humans. We deleted the gene encoding endoG in the Leishmania mexicana parasite to create a weakened form of the parasite that may be useful as a live attenuated vaccine candidate in humans. <br><br> Our studies showed that deletion of endoG from the Leishmania mexicana parasite impairs the parasite’s mitochondrial functions, which are critical in the amastigote stage of the parasite life cycle within humans, and leads to other severe defects. Impaired parasitic mitochondrial functions included reduced ATP production, increased generation of reactive oxygen species, and reduced mitochondrial respiration. Defects included significant growth reduction of amastigotes and altered karyotype with high proportion of abnormal, multinucleated amastigotes. Data from mouse model studies done by the mentor using our knockout revealed that cumulative defects render parasites less fit to survive and prevent overt disease by limiting replication of parasites within the host. The results demonstrate that deletion of endoG leads to reduced parasite virulence. <br><br> Previous human vaccine attempts using recombinant subunit vaccines, DNA vaccines, and killed whole cell parasites did not yield highly protective vaccines. Our work creating a genetically altered parasite strain that can be tested as a novel live attenuated vaccine offers a promising approach.

EXAMINING THE ANTIBACTERIAL PROPERTIES OF GARLIC OIL, OREGANO OIL, AND GRAPEFRUIT SEED OIL EXTRACTS ON MICROORGANISMS SIGNIFICANT TO WOMEN’S HEALTH
Abigail Tillman, Jesseca Kusher
Spartanburg Day School, Spartanburg, SC

Alternative medicine is the practice of using herbs and other unconventional methods as medical treatments. While not scientifically tested, alternative medicine may prove useful in fighting new antibiotic-resistant bacteria and fungi. This research project investigated if oregano, garlic, and grapefruit seed oil extracts would have antimicrobial properties against the chosen bacteria and fungus. S. aureus and P. aeruginosa were cultured in Luria Bertoni (LB) broth and agar. C. albicans, was cultured in Sabourand dextrose (SD) broth and agar. Commercially purchased grapefruit seed oil, the garlic bulb (Allium sativum) oil and oregano (Origanum vulgare) extract were used. After overnight incubation, the turbidity was adjusted to the absorbance 0.08 (at 625 nm). A spread culture for each organism was prepared. A sterile paper disc immersed in the extract was placed in the middle of the Petri dish. Zones of inhibitions were measured in S. aureus and P. aeruginosa plates after 24 hours, in C. albicans plates 48 hours following the incubation. A t-test was performed to analyze the results. Our results show that even though not statistically significant Oregano and grapefruit seed oil extracts showed antibiotic properties against P. aeruginosa (p>.05). Garlic oil extract was ineffective against all three microorganisms. Oregano oil extract showed antibiotic properties when used against S. aureus (p<0.05) and C. albicans (p<0.001), inhibiting C. albicans growth completely. Grapefruit seed oil also had antibiotic properties against S. aureus and against C. albicans. Its effectiveness against S. aureus nearly equal or stronger than two of the antibiotics used (p<0.05).

ICA-METHOD
Lucas Noel Sulzberger, Robert Gautsch

Within the scope of our project, we deal with the bacteria clostridium sporogenes. The consumption of food containing CS is most likely to lead to severe diarrhea. In case of detecting a possibly contaminated food sample, the producer faces huge costs, because a whole day's production has to be destroyed right away. It is a natural component of soil and it also occurs in the digestive system of pigs and cows. That explains why it is also detected in milk, and therefore in dairy products in general. What's more to consider is the fact, that CS is spore forming and for short periods it is able to stand temperatures up to 140 degrees Celsius. So currently used pasteurization methods fordairy products leave CS unharmed. <br><br>We started doing a series of tests with various nutrient agars. We analyzed the bacteria's growth and determined what enhanced it, combining the ones with the best results in the end. Adding growth accelerators and color indicators to that mixture, we finally introduced what we call the ICA method. The agar we implemented provides test results within 24 hours, and the contained color indicators make any additional expensive machinery and equipment obsolete. The extraordinary short time our method takes to provide results, not only pushes current food safety standards, but also safes food producer's money, in the specific case of the company we collaborated with - an amount of €40.000, not only once, but every single time!

REINVENTING ANTIBIOTICS: A STUDY TO DETERMINE IF THE ADDITION OF A GRAM-POSITIVE LYSIN CAN PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OF RESISTANCE TO VANCOMYCIN AND DAPTOMYCIN IN MRSA
Anna Elizabeth Blech, Alexander Epstein
Hunter College High School, New York, NY

Staphylococcus aureus is a significant human pathogen, causing morbidity and mortality in hospitals and the community. Sixty percent of hospital-acquired S. aureus infections are methicillin-resistant, and resistance to vancomycin and daptomycin, i.e., “drugs of last resort,” is now appearing. A new treatment strategy is needed to combat increasingly drug-resistant S. aureus strains. Recombinant Gram-positive lysins (GPLs) represent a promising new family of antimicrobial agents currently under development. GPLs are enzymes encoded by bacteriophages and can destroy bacteria by rupturing the cell wall. Importantly, GPLs have a synergistic killing effect in combination with vancomycin or daptomycin. Our work tests the hypothesis that synergy also exists in terms of preventing resistance to these antibiotics. The evolution of resistance to vancomycin or daptomycin was compared to the resistance developed after exposure to a combination of antibiotic and GPLs. The serial passage method, in which bacteria are gradually exposed to increasing concentrations of antibiotic over time, was used to select for resistance. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)—the minimum concentration of antibiotic needed to prevent bacterial growth—was measured after each passage. With vancomycin alone, the MIC rose 16-fold after 26 passages. With vancomycin in combination with GPL, the vancomycin MIC rose only 3.3-fold. Similarly, for daptomycin alone, the MIC rose 128-fold after 30 passages, but when daptomycin was combined with GPL, the daptomycin MIC rose only fourfold. Therefore, adding GPL to vancomycin and daptomycin prevented MRSA from developing high-level resistance to these antibiotics. In this manner, the spread of antibiotic resistance in S. aureus can be diminished.

COMBATING MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS BY INDUCTION OF SELF-POISONING
Zhun Che, Julia Kavanagh
Pelham Memorial High School, Pelham, NY

Tuberculosis is a global health emergency due to the emergence of drug resistance. Methylglyoxal (MG) is a toxic electrophile present in bacteria that can cause cell death at high concentrations. MG is produced from an alternate glycolytic pathway in times of metabolic imbalance and can be detoxified through well documented pathways in gram-negative bacteria. However, virtually nothing is known about MG metabolism in mycobacterium, such as Tuberculosis. Through this study, we designed an assay to determine genes involved in MG metabolism within mycobacterium. A transposon mutant library was created using M. Smegmatis and screened for resistant and susceptible mutants. Mutants were verified through a second test and false positives were eliminated. At the end of this study, we were able to isolate sixteen mutants. Three mutants we further researched proved to be extremely interesting: MSMEG_3083, MSMEG_2317 and MSMEG_2402. MSMEG_3083 is a resistant mutant that is possibly a regulator of the genes gap, pgk, and tpiA; three genes that are essential in the glycolytic process of bacterium. MSMG_2317 and MSMEG_2402 are part of a new degradation pathway discovered as a result of this study. We are taking the first steps to creating a new anti-tubercular drug through targeting the methylglyoxal pathway.

Nosocomial infections, along with hospital errors, are one of the leading causes of death in America, resulting in 99,000 deaths annually. The problem being addressed is the prevalence of bacteria leading to nosocomial infections on peripherals for data entry for electronic medical records (EMR) in hospital rooms, and the efficacy of the current cleaning methods used on said peripherals for data entry. The hypothesis is that several different types of bacteria that lead to nosocomial infections, such as E.coli and members of the Staphylococcus genus, will be present on the peripherals for data entry, and the current cleaning methods will not be completely effective in removing these bacteria. Forty-two samples of keyboard swabs before and after cleaning were taken, and put onto blood agar plates. They were later analyzed using the gram staining procedure. These bacteria were quantified in tables for optimal understanding, and it was concluded that the current cleaning method was 21.21% effective in eliminating Staphylococcus aureus, 50% in Serratia, 52.94% in Staphylococcus epidermidis, 55.17% in E.coli, and 50% in Micrococcus. The current cleaning methods were completely ineffective in eliminating Streptococcus chains and Klebsiella pneumoniae. These results reveal the ineffectiveness of the current methods, and the need for an improved cleaning system. These results are extremely important to the safety and well-being of patients and hospital staff in hospitals globally. With the recent introduction of electronic medical records (EMR) and the resulting increase in computer use, these results are crucial in improving the conditions and safety of hospitals.

Antibiotics and iron are frequently used in the daily lives of many people. The researches hypothesized that iron will decrease the efficiency of the antibiotics doxycycline and amoxicillin. Two experiments were performed, one including amoxicillin and the other including doxycycline. For both experiment the process was consistent altering the antibiotics. The researchers collected bacteria from household surroundings and grew it on one agar plate. Then, they created a solution with the bacteria and inoculated eighty agar plates. Next, disks of equal size and volume were soaked in their designated solution. These included 5ml of amoxicillin, 5ml of amoxicillin and iron, 5ml of doxycycline, or 5ml of doxycycline and iron. Each of the eighty agar plates had each of the four solutions. After one week, the zones of inhibition were measured and the data was analyzed with a T-test. The T-test between amoxicillin and amoxicillin and iron’s p value was 0.0026; therefore, the researches reject their null hypothesis. The T-test between doxycycline and doxycycline and iron’s p value was 0.0001; therefore, the researchers reject their null hypothesis. The T-test of amoxicillin and iron verses doxycycline and iron’s p value was 0.0001; therefore, the researchers reject their null hypothesis. In conclusion, these experiments showed that iron reduces the effect of antibiotics on bacteria.

By loosing control of cell division mechanisms creating dysfunctional individuals to give rise to mass is known as cancer. This disease, in the last century, was spread with environmental factors such as radiation, pollution etc. due to the increasing development of technology. The increasing number of this disease‟s patients and with the reaches of scientists as “One of every three people will be diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime”, cancer came into our lives as a dread disease. In the study, it is aimed to invesestigate the interaction of doxorubicin as an anticancer drug and the active substance isolated from algae with DNA by designed optical biosensor. With this goal, interaction of active substance and doxorubicin with DNA was examined by not using cell culture or livings. <br><br> Research was performed using developed optical biosensor by using 28-based synthetic DNA sequences of Influenza-A virus. Interactıon of Doxorubicin and active substance which was thought to have anticancer activity with DNA was observed by using SPR. <br><br>SPR array hybridization using 28 bases used in this study are shown. Interactions of anticancer drug doxorubicin and the active ingredient with DNA in experimental environment were investigated. <br><br> It was found that doxorubicin intercalated the hybridized DNA sequences in experimental environment and active substance can be used as anticancer agent with the mechanism of distruption the hybridization by attaching the DNA single chain.
