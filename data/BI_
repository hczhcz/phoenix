BETTER DRUGS FROM BETTER MOLECULES
Paige Erin Finkelstein
Pine Crest School, Fort Lauderdale, FL

Optically pure solutions of fluorinated molecules are of current interest to the pharmaceutical industry as drug building blocks. Current methods for controlling fluorine stereochemistry use transition metal complexes to reduce fluorinated alkenes stereoselecively, but harsh conditions must be used to achieve high enantioselectivity and avoid defluorination. A less expensive alternative, enzymatic reduction, can be used to asymmetrically reduce alkenes in safer environments and produce the optical purity of solutions needed by pharmaceutical industries. It has previously been shown that a library of purified reductases can reduce a representative fluorinated alkene with high selectivity. To expand this range, I synthesized two fluorinated alkenes, an alcohol and an aldehyde, as potential substrates for the reductases. The alcohol, lacking a carbonyl group, was not a substrate for the enzymes, but future research will determine if the corresponding aldehyde will be accepted. Although the alcohol was not accepted as a substrate, the results helped to clarify that in order for the mechanism of reduction used by the enzymes to work, a carbonyl group must be found within the molecule. This discovery makes the aldehyde a perfect candidate for reduction in the future.

POISON STIMULATION: THE EFFECTS OF SODIUM BENZOATE ON THE REPRODUCTIVE PATTERNS OF CHOANEPHORA CUCURBITARUM AND MUCOR HIEMALIS
Anna Aleksandrova
Lake Brantley High School, Altamonte Springs, Florida, United States of America

This project is the result of bioassay experimentation on the effects of Sodium Benzoate on two types of fungus: Choanephora cucurbitarum and Mucor hiemalis. The purpose is to determine the amount of Sodium Benzoate required for hormesis (stimulation by low doses of usually inhibiting substance) to occur. The fungi were isolated and grown in the V8 agar gel media with various doses of Sodium Benzoate. The control media contained no Sodium Benzoate. Through experimentation the toxic level where Sodium Benzoate kills the fungi was determined to be 10 ml per 100 ml of V8 agar gel. Doses lower than those were tested for hormetic effects. <br><br>Each time the experiment was conducted, the rates of growth were observed and recorded. The values recorded demonstrated that each fungus excelled the rate of growth of the control plate by as much as 50% when grown on media containing 10 to 150 micro liters of Sodium Benzoate. The results of the project show that Sodium Benzoate can stimulate growth of Choanephora cucurbitarum and Mucor hiemalis fungi when exposed to minuscule doses. <br><br>Practical applications of this conclusion may be found in food industry, specifically in the matter of food additives. The amount of Sodium Benzoate must stay above .1 % in products that use it as a protection against fungi; otherwise the fungus may reproduce more actively, hence damaging the product. Also, the hormesis effect may help induce growth in fungi which will aid in the identification of the fungus by its reproductive patterns.<br><br>

UNIQUE LOADING PATTERNS OF THE RHO FAMILY GTPASE TCL
Forrest Ryan Guilfoile
Bemidji High School, Bemidji, MN

In this project, I analyzed the GDP-loading behavior of a little characterized member of the Rho family GTPases called TCL (TC-10 Like GTPase). The purpose of this project is to observe and verify the differences in TCL's regulation compared to other members of the Rho family. <br><br>To produce TCL protein, a TCL DNA sequence was PCR amplified and ligated into an E. coli expression vector (pGEX), and tranformed into the protein-expressing strain E. coli BL21. The TCL protein was produced as a GST fusion protein and was purified using standard methods. A fluorescence assay using Mant-GDP was performed to verify activity. The GDP-loading activity of TCL was compared to that of Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoG. <br><br>TCL activity differed substantially from the other GTPases. In the presence of EDTA ,TCL did not load with GDP; however, it loaded readily with in the absence of EDTA. The opposite occurred with the other GTPases tested. Which only loaded with GDP in the presence of EDTA. This is likely attributable to variations in the amino acid sequence of TCL, which has critical regions that are more negative and more positive than Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoG. The important variations seem to be in the switch 1 region which may affect the binding of magnesium in the nucleotide binding region.<br><br>This project provides a substantial step forward in understanding GTPase activity and regulation. It helps to characterize what role TCL plays in vivo, and shows the variety of Rho family regulation in vivo.

EFFECT OF FERRIC UPTAKE REGULATORY PROTEIN ON THE TRANSCRIPTION OF THE SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE GENE OF ESCHERICHIA COLI
Katherine Marie Shaeffer
Breck School, Golden Valley, Minnesota, USA

The expression of a gene into a protein through transcription of DNA to messenger RNA (mRNA) can be moderated. The focus of this project was to determine how ferric uptake regulatory (Fur) protein modulates the transcription of the superoxide dismutase gene (sodA) of E. coli. It was hypothesized that Fur regulates the transcription of the sodA gene by enhancing the amount of mRNA produced during transcription. The objective of this project was to transcribe DNA in the presence and absence of Fur and quantitate the amount of mRNA produced to determine if Fur regulates sodA expression. A reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to quantify transcription using gel electrophoresis. Complimentary DNA (cDNA) was successfully transcribed and amplified through RT-PCR with and without Fur. The results of gel electrophoresis showed that 2 µL of a 1/10 dilution of Fur in Tris buffer added during transcription most effectively enhanced expression of the sodA gene. This study is unique in that it showed that Fur does regulate gene expression. These results can be used in future research on regulatory proteins and their effects on gene expression.

GLOW FACTOR: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF CAPSAICIN AND ANTIOXIDANTS
Maria Encarnacion Garcia
Taos High School, Taos, NM, USA

Green and Red Chile have been a vital part of a majority New Mexican diets for many generations. Scientists have researched the health benefits of Chile, because of its theorized healing properties. Antioxidants (AO) are considered the new fountain of youth. Experimentation on AO rich foods continues to identify substances with AO properties. <br><br> The objective of this project is to compare capsaicin levels against AO capacity and activity in red and green chile. It is hypothesized that as the capsaicin levels increase, the AO activity will also increase. It is hypothesized that green chile will have a higher capsaicin level and higher AO activity than red chile.<br><br> The first step of experimentation was to extract capsaicin, Vitamin A, and Vitamin E from red and green chile powders. Chile samples were dissolved in ethanol at 40°C for 4 hrs. These solutions were then assayed with a gas chromatograph to determine Capsaicin, Vitamin A and Vitamin E levels. Possible AO activity was assayed using light intensity, ORAC, pH, and SET tests. The capsaicin levels are then compared against the AO activity, and the Vitamin A and E capacities/levels in the samples. <br><br> Results indicated that capsaicin levels were higher between the different heat levels of Chile. Green chile samples exhibited higher capsaicin levels than red. Samples tested for Vitamin A and Vitamin E, Capsaicin and Dihydrocapsaicin indicated possible AO activity. <br><br> In conclusion, the analysis shows that capsaicin levels are higher in green chile than red, with a direct relationship to heat levels and Vitamin E levels. The Vitamin A levels were independent of heat level, and instead were dependant on the darkness of the chile; therefore the red chiles contained more Vitamin A. The data indicates that chiles with higher capsaicin levels appear to have higher AO capacity and activity, therefore supporting the hypotheses as stated.<br><br>

SUPER-ANTIMYCOTIC: NANOPARTICLES OF BIOPHILIC METALS + HYPERBRANCHED POLYMER
Ekaterina Igorevna Zimakova
Municipal School 'Gymnasium # 7', Kazan, RUSSIA

According to WHO, mycosis suffers every fifth inhabitant of the planet. In US mycosis come out on top in-hospital mortality from sepsis. An effective, non-toxic antimycotic has been created by combining nanoparticles of biophilic metals (eg. Co, Cu, Ag and Au) with a polymer as a stabilizer. The polymer used was Boltorn H30 which is hyperbranched polyesterpolyol and its products. <br><br> We conducted synthesis with the aim of making the nanoparticles as small and stable as possible. By the method of chemical reduction of metal salts with a stabilizer thermolys of the metal polymer complexes synthesized nanosized particles of Au, Ag, Cu, and Co. The Cu/BH30 nanoparticles are hexagonal Cu0 particles with diameters from 12 to 26 nm. The Co/BH30 nanoparticles have sizes from 3 to 9 nm and coordinated on a ribbon. The nanoparticles with the greatest size are the Ag/BH30, with 15-20 nm and the Au/BH30 with 20-25 nm. A new stabilizer BH30(CH2CH2COOH)22 was synthesized. The size of the Cu/BH30(CH2CH2COOH)22, Co/BH30(CH2CH2COOH)22 particles is reduced to 3nm.<br><br> On a proteinase of Candida albicans it was observed that the combination of the stabilizers with the metal nanoparticles increases the inhibition to 70%. The fungicidal properties of the nanoparticles increases in the order Au<Ag<Cu<Co. The fungicidal effect of the nanoparticles has been shown on cultures of Candida, Aspergillus, Pennicillum, Paecilomyces, Trichoderma.<br><br> The high effectiveness, bioavailability and low toxicity of the prototypes have been achieved due to the mechanism of inhibition of fungal proteases with metal nanoparticles immobilized on surface of branched polymer by carboxyl groups. It was provided stabilization and transport of the nanoparticles.

ANTI-TOXIN PROPERTIES OF GRAPE EXTRACTS, YEAR THREE
Srikar Patlola Reddy
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, FL

Two grape extracts (seed and pomace) were used to block AB toxin activity. AB toxins consist of a binding B-subunit and a catalytic A-subunit. AB toxins, through retrograde vesicular traffic, reach the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Examples of AB toxins include cholera, ricin, Shiga, and Exotoxin A. Cholera toxin was incubated and grape extracts were added periodically over a period of two hours: 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 60 minutes. The grape extracts still showed a large anti-toxin response despite not being added immediately after intoxication. Through surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis, the grape extracts were shown to prevent the toxin from exiting the ER and entering the cytosol after 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 60 minutes. Grape pomace inhibited toxin translocation to the cytosol at a greater degree than the grape seed did. Certain polyphenols within the grape extracts, specifically epigallocatechin gallate (EgCg) and to a lesser extent resveratrol, inhibited Exotoxin A activity.

PROTEIN DEFORMATION: GEOMETRIC DETECTION OF LIGAND BINDING TO PROTEINS IN THREE DIMENSIONS
Troy Justin Kleber
Henry W. Grady High School, Atlanta, GA

We examined the three dimensional structure of proteins to determine whether the Combinatorial Condensed-Object Parameterized Analysis (COPA) was an effective method for conformational analysis. COPA is a new method for analyzing the three dimensional structures of proteins, that reduces the dimensionality to two. The overall goal was to determine if COPA can detect subtle changes in protein conformation upon ligand binding. We hypothesized that the ligand-bound protein will yield a COPA plot that is slightly different from the free protein, and the conformational changes incurred by ligand binding can be localized and characterized by COPA.<br><br> We used hemoglobin as our subject and examined two different forms: human deoxyhemoglobin and hemoglobin bound with nitric oxide. We calculated the pseudo-0, the dihedral angle (angle between the normal lines of adjacent peptide planes) for the hemoglobin structures. We plotted several different variations of the three parameters: residue number, pseudo-0, and delta.<br><br> The delta plots (residue number versus delta) produced the most valuable results. We determined that a certain structural element in hemoglobin, the alpha helix, remained mostly unchanged when the protein was bound to nitric oxide. In contrast, the loops between the helices were more deformable. We also identified the locations of the greatest deformations, which we determined might be regions of hyper flexibility. We concluded that the alpha helix is much more rigid in structure than the loops, which tend to be areas of deformation.<br><br> COPA produced an effective method for analyzing proteins and locating deformations resulting from ligand binding.

INHIBITION OF BACTERIA BY CHEMICALS IN HERBS
Ekta Ashok Solanki, Lake Brantley High School
Longwood, Fl, USA 

This research investigated the antimicrobial potential of several herbs. This could be an indirect indication to their effectiveness against fighting the organism. Those herbs identified as possessing any antimicrobial properties were then examined to determine what product(s) of the herb was responsible for this activity. Nutrient agar plates were swabbed with either two types of bacteria: Bacillus cereus and Escherichia Coli. Once nutrient agar plates were swabbed, a sterile filter paper disk was dipped into mixture of 70 % Isopropyl and each respective herb. The disk was then placed in the center of the nutrient agar plate. After 18 hours of incubation the zones of inhibition were measured in millimeters. Paper Chromatography was done on the herbs which inhibited the most bacteria within each organism(Oregano, Sage, Cinnamon and Rosemary)to separate the herbs into different components.Agar Zone Diffusion was done on the individual herbs that inhibited the most bacteria within each organism. After the completion of these tests the following conclusions were formulated. There are bacterial growth inhibitors present in the herbs. All of the components from each herb inhibited the growth of either organism. To better improve my research a larger sample size could be used, different organisms could be tested i.e. Salmonella, and Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) could be conducted to identify the minimum concentration of the solution needed to inhibit the bacteria. <br><br>

SEARCHING THE FLUORESCENT COLOR PROTEIN PALETTE FOR NOVEL FRET PAIRS
Xin Guan
Lincoln High School, Tallahassee, FL

Metabolic FRET biosensors derived from cyan and yellow fluorescent protein variants have proven useful for a large number of in vivo detection strategies, ranging from intracellular pH and calcium measurements to monitoring protease cleavage, phosphorylation, and the visualization of protein-protein interactions. Nevertheless, many of these sensors are hampered by relatively low dynamic range and the requirement for illumination wavelengths below 450 nm, a region where phototoxicity can limit the useful lifetime of imaging experiments. In this study, combinations of new monomeric and dimeric reef coral proteins with green fluorescent GFP derivatives were assessed for their ability to display increased levels of sensitized emission characteristic of FRET in the orange, red, and deep red wavelengths. Fluorescent protein-based FRET pairs were generated using molecular cloning techniques, and were subsequently imaged using scanning confocal microscopy. Spectral imaging profiles indicated that the mVenus fluorescent protein donor coupled with tdTomato and mOrange2 acceptors produced the most efficient FRET signals. Similarly, the mEmerald-tdTomato –mKO and –TurboRFP donor-acceptor pairs also demonstrated reasonable FRET activity. Additionally, results suggested a possible role of amino-acid linker length and the compatibility of donor-acceptor maturation rates in the occurrence of FRET. The expansion of long wavelength-shifted FRET pairs offers reduced phototoxicity to subcellular matter during imaging while the photophysically advantageous properties of these proteins may replace conventionally employed pairs. Although experiments are ongoing, extension of the fluorescent protein color palette ultimately presents the opportunity to explore new FRET partners that may be suitable for use in advanced biosensors.

THE TRANSFECTION OF P53 17–26-V IN NEOTOMA CINEREA PANCREATIC ACINAR CELLS, BMRPA1, AND HUMAN PANCREATIC CANCER CELLS, MIAPACA-2, AND THE PROTEIN MODELING OF THE ACTIVE DOMAIN OF PNC-27 AND PNC-28
Michael Andrew Fairchild Harding
Lake Highland Prep School, Orlando, FL

The experiment was designed to determine the mechanism of cellular death of p53 dependent cancer cells when exposed to the anticancer peptide, PNC-28, and to determine the molecular structure of the PNC-27 and PNC-28. MiaPaCa-2 and BMRPA1 cell lines were transfected with the plasmids: p53 17–26-V, p53 17–26-scrm-V, or an empty vector. The GFP levels of the cells were measured at 445 nm in order to ensure that optical density was above 1 optical unit and that over 50 percent of cells underwent transfection. Samples were taken from MiaPaCa-2 and BMRPA1 cells treated with either PNC-28 or PNC-29 at 18, 44, 66, and 90 hours, at which time a Caspase and LDH assays was performed. The results of the experiment did support the null hypothesises of N0 treatments-- if MiaPaCa-2 and BMRPA1 cells are transfected with p53 17–26-V, p53 17–26-SCRM-V, or null vector plasmids treated with PNC-28, and PNC-27, then MiaPACa-2 cells transfected with p53 17–26-V shall have a highest prevalence of cellular death and if MiaPaCa-2 and BMRPA1 are treated with the proteins, PNC-28 and PNC-29, then MiaPaCa-2 cells treated with PNC-28 will have shall have a higher prevalence of cellular death compared to all other experimental groups and shall have elevated Caspase levels-- because of the respective P-Values of the N1 hypothesis is P≥0.0263 and P≥0.00131. Additionally, MiaPaCa-2 cells treated with PNC-28 had an 83 percent prevalence of cellular death, while MiaPaCa-2 cells treated with PNC-28 had a 23 percent prevalence of cellular death (P≥0.001).

The Orc6 region in Schizosaccharomyces pombe was identified and deleted through homologous recombination with plasmids. Southern blot confirmed the deletion. Nmt41, a thymine controlled promoter, was used to rescue the expression of Orc6. The phenotypes of cells with Orc6 suppressed were compared with cells expressing Orc6. Results show that cells lacking Orc6 expression were elongated and dead after 24- 48 hours suggesting that Orc6 is essential for cell viability and that the cell cycle may have been blocked.

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ENZYME TREATMENTS ON NATURAL FIBERS WHEN VARYING DURATION AND TEMPERATURE
Kimberly Nicole Braulick
St. Mary's High School, Sleepy Eye, MN

The reason I chose this project was to learn more about enzymes as well as their effect on the silk and alpaca fibers. I wanted to find a process that is effective on the wool, alpaca, and silk fibers. I also wanted to find a process that is environmentally safe, energy efficient, reusable, and increases the color intensity in the fiber.<br><br> The treatments used on the fibers include a bleaching and enzyme treatement. The fibers are first added to the bleaching solution, and then agitated in the pretreatment. The duration of the pretreatment is varied. After the pretreatment is complete, the enzyme tretment takes place. This treatment has varied temperatures. <br><br> The alpaca and silk fibers at the lowest temperature and moderate duration had the best effect on the fiber. The silk fibers at this duration and temperature were completely degummed and were ready for dyeing. The alpaca fibers treated at the lowest time and moderate duration had some fibers that were smooth and others still had scales remaining. This treatment led to greater color intensity when dyeing, but because some of the scales still remained, the fiber still had a fair amount of strength. <br><br> This process would be beneficial to any company wanting to treat fibers with a reusable, energy efficient, and environmentally safe treatment using various natural fibers made of the protein keratin (such as silk, alpaca, and wool). To continue my experiment I could use different enzymes to treat these fibers. I could also use other natural animal fibers such as mohair, cashmere, or angora. I may also test to see if this enzyme treatment can degum cotton in the way it degums silk.

UPREGULATION OF ATGL IN THE MODEL OF LOW MUSCLE MASS.
Shrishiv Avanti Timbalia
Louisiana School for Math Science and the Arts, Natchitoches, LA

This experiment was performed in order to investigate the enzymes (ATGL, HSL, AMPK, and HSL ser660) involved in the lipolytic pathway within rats bearing tumors. Western blots were performed on subcutaneous adipose tissue (supplied by the PI) in order to detect the aforementioned proteins. Tubulin was used as a standard. ECL detection was performed with the VersaDoc system, and Quantity One was used to quantify the amounts of protein in each lane. The levels of ATGL in the rat adipose was significantly different on day 21. Although this might be indicative of increased expression with the progression of time, any metabolic mechanisms that might have been activated as the animal lost adipose cannot be ruled out. ATGL levels in TB are elevated in day 21, as opposed to day 15, suggesting that ATGL has a continued importance in the later stages of lipolysis. The differentiation between HSL and ATGL levels on day 15 and day 21 suggest that they are not congruent enzymes. This differentiation may also suggest a link between tumor size and levels of lipolytic factors in tumor bearing rats.

CHARACTERIZATION OF CYCLIN DEPENDENT-LIKE KINASES IN PLASMODIUM FALCIPARUM
Preethi Raghavan
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, FL

Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, affects nearly 300-500 million people each year, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. Resistance to the traditional antimalarial, chloroquine, creates the need for new drug targets, thus calling for a deeper understanding of the molecular biology of P. falciparum. Studies show a high degree of homology between eukaryotic Cyclin Dependent Kinases (CDKs), a subset of protein kinases involved in cell cycle regulation, and a group of CDK-like proteins in P. falciparum, including PfPK5 and PfPK6. This project sought to elucidate the role of PfPK5 & PfPK6 in cell cycle regulation. <br><br>Immunofluorescence assays revealed that PfPK5 localizes within the nucleus and PfPK6 localizes within the nucleus and cytoplasm of the parasite within the infected erythrocyte. This reveals that both the proteins localize in the region where DNA is replicated. PfPK5 also exhibits co-localization with PfCyc1, PfCyc2, and PfCyc3 while PfPK6 exhibits little co-localization, indicating perhaps no cyclin involvement. The expression profile for PfPK5 and PfPK6 revealed peak expression during Late and Early schizont stages respectively. It is during the schizont stage when DNA replication occurs, thus suggesting cell cycle involvement. The hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged PfPK5 and PfPK6 constructs were successfully transfected. Further experimentation includes the Co-Immunoprecipitation, which will allow for the identification of the substrates that PfP5 and PfPK6 interact with. By gaining an understanding of how these two CDK-like Kinase function, potential drug targets may be identified and lead to the creation of effective antimalarials.

ENZYMATIC HYDROGEN PRODUCTION: EXPRESSION OF HYDROGENASES FROM THE HYPERTHERMOPHILE PYROCOCCUS FURIOSUS
Joseph Robert Stunzi
Clarke Central High School, Athens, GA, USA

Pyrococcus furiosus is a hyperthermophilic archaeon that grows optimally at 100°C. Because P. furiosus grows at boiling temperatures, its enzymes are highly thermostable. Three of these enzymes, named hydrogenases, catalyze enzymatic hydrogen production. The goal of this research was to recombinantly express the Soluble Hydrogenase I protein complex within Escherichia coli and to obtain functional recombinant proteins capable of hydrogen production. It was initially believed that this could be achieved within the host cell itself. However, a reconstitution experiment was developed to account for the influence of numerous chaperone proteins and to attempt to replicate catalytic activity in vitro.<br><br> The researcher found that protein expression could be maximized through the addition of iron to growth media and the increase of temperature beyond 37°C. The large and small subunits of the hydrogenase protein were successfully expressed in separate E. coli strains. Such strains did not catalytically produce hydrogen. Additionally, it was shown, through reconstitution experiments, that the large subunit cannot catalytically produce hydrogen unaccompanied by other subunits. Conversely, the combination of purified large and small subunit proteins with the chaperones from P. furiosus yields functional hydrogen production. Enzymatic hydrogen production, as achieved in this research, could potentially revolutionize future hydrogen production.<br><br>

"LEAD TO GOLD...PLANTS TO PLASTICS," WHICH AGRICULTURAL RESOURCE WILL SATISFY THE 'TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE'?
Casey Jo Freeman
Mid-Buchanan R-V, Faucett, Missouri, United States 

The project was the result of a study that included research, observations, preliminary testing, modifications and retesting for plant-based polymers. The objective of the study was to determine a relationship between the type of agricultural plant used in a polymerization process and the hardness, tensile strength and biodegradability of the product. Preliminary testing of the separation, fermentation, condensation and tensile strength was completed for corn, plaintain and potato polymers. The researcher pursued the study to obtain insight in one of the most exciting fields of the future. Testing instrumentation included the use of a distillation apparatus, a caliper, the Micro Hardness instrument, the Instron machine, and the digital balance. Numerous raw data was collected, analyzed and summarized for the three plant-based polymers as well as wheat and soybeans. The data was statistically analyzed. The results exhibited promising possibilities for the corn-based polymer as a useful renewable resource for plastic materials, which maintain applicable uses and biodegradability properties. The study does not exclude the possible uses of wheat, plantains, and potatoes, depending on the purpose of the plastic. The information for the study is considered to be important to the development of biodegradable polymers that are economically, environmentally and socially sustainable, the 'triple bottom line,' for the future.

The purpose of this project was to determine whether anthraquinone could be the possible active reagent in the leaves of Morinda citrifolia (noni), responsible for healing superficial wounds. Extract from noni leaves and 1%, 0.5%, and 0.25% anthraquinones in 95% ethanol were made and tested with broth cultures of Staphylococcus aureus and Aspergillus niger. The zones of inhibition, which determine the effectiveness of anthraquinone and noni as antimicrobial agents, were measured after two days (48-hour incubation for Staphylococcus-plates).<br><br> Twenty tests were conducted. The results showed that all three anthraquinones and noni extract were effective against Staphylococcus aureus because their zones of inhibition were greater than those of the 95% ethanol. This could possibly mean that anthraquinone may be responsible for the antibacterial actions of the leaves. However, only the anthraquinones were effective against Aspergillus niger. The 0.25% anthraquinone had the greatest zones of inhibition, while the 1% anthraquinone had the least. This could mean that the optimum level of anthraquinone is somewhere around 0.25%, and once it reaches 1%, anthraquinone probably loses its effectiveness as an antifungal agent. Since the results showed that noni leaves were not antifungal, the anthraquinone present in the leaves may be less concentrated than the actual anthraquinones used in this experiment. It was also possible that anthraquinone may not be present in noni because if it were, then the extract from the leaves should have at least shown zones of inhibition.<br><br> Statistical analysis showed 95% significance and the results, therefore, were not due by chance.<br><br>

ANTIFREEZE PROTEIN VS. ARTIFICIAL POLYMER
Taylor Christian Velarde
Cornerstone Christian School, San Angelo, TX

Kinetic polymers are used in industrial applications to lower the freezing point of liquids under certain temperature ranges. The purpose of this project was to determine if a naturally occurring antifreeze protein (AFP) found in arctic fish is more effective than an artificial kinetic polymer in lowering the freezing point of water. My hypothesis was that the natural protein would be more effective than the artificial polymer in lowering the freezing point. <br><br> To test this, a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) was used. This device measures the heat flow in and out of a liquid sample as it is cooled and heated. The protein and the polymer were diluted in a buffer solution and then five tests were performed; one with the buffer solution as a control sample and two samples of each the protein and the polymer with two different concentrations: 1000 and 2500 parts per million. The DSC cooled the sample from 20 degrees Celsius to minus 20 degrees and then heated it back to plus 20 degrees at a rate of 5 degrees per minute. Due to the supercooling effect, where a liquid can be cooled far below its freezing point without freezing, the melting point was used to test my hypothesis.<br><br> <br><br> The antifreeze protein was found to be as effective as the artificial polymer at lowering the freezing point of water. Its effect, even at different concentrations, was the same as the polymer. In conclusion, the AFP was as effective as the polymer.

"LEAD TO GOLD...PLANTS TO PLASTICS," WHICH AGRICULTURAL RESOURCE WILL SATISFY THE 'TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE'?
Casey Jo Freeman
Mid-Buchanan R-V, Faucett, Missouri, United States 

The project was the result of a study that included research, observations, preliminary testing, modifications and retesting for plant-based polymers. The objective of the study was to determine a relationship between the type of agricultural plant used in a polymerization process and the hardness, tensile strength and biodegradability of the product. Preliminary testing of the separation, fermentation, condensation and tensile strength was completed for corn, plaintain and potato polymers. The researcher pursued the study to obtain insight in one of the most exciting fields of the future. Testing instrumentation included the use of a distillation apparatus, a caliper, the Micro Hardness instrument, the Instron machine, and the digital balance. Numerous raw data was collected, analyzed and summarized for the three plant-based polymers as well as wheat and soybeans. The data was statistically analyzed. The results exhibited promising possibilities for the corn-based polymer as a useful renewable resource for plastic materials, which maintain applicable uses and biodegradability properties. The study does not exclude the possible uses of wheat, plantains, and potatoes, depending on the purpose of the plastic. The information for the study is considered to be important to the development of biodegradable polymers that are economically, environmentally and socially sustainable, the 'triple bottom line,' for the future.

ENZYMATIC HYDROGEN PRODUCTION: EXPRESSION OF HYDROGENASES FROM THE HYPERTHERMOPHILE PYROCOCCUS FURIOSUS
Joseph Robert Stunzi
Clarke Central High School, Athens, GA, USA

Pyrococcus furiosus is a hyperthermophilic archaeon that grows optimally at 100°C. Because P. furiosus grows at boiling temperatures, its enzymes are highly thermostable. Three of these enzymes, named hydrogenases, catalyze enzymatic hydrogen production. The goal of this research was to recombinantly express the Soluble Hydrogenase I protein complex within Escherichia coli and to obtain functional recombinant proteins capable of hydrogen production. It was initially believed that this could be achieved within the host cell itself. However, a reconstitution experiment was developed to account for the influence of numerous chaperone proteins and to attempt to replicate catalytic activity in vitro.<br><br> The researcher found that protein expression could be maximized through the addition of iron to growth media and the increase of temperature beyond 37°C. The large and small subunits of the hydrogenase protein were successfully expressed in separate E. coli strains. Such strains did not catalytically produce hydrogen. Additionally, it was shown, through reconstitution experiments, that the large subunit cannot catalytically produce hydrogen unaccompanied by other subunits. Conversely, the combination of purified large and small subunit proteins with the chaperones from P. furiosus yields functional hydrogen production. Enzymatic hydrogen production, as achieved in this research, could potentially revolutionize future hydrogen production.<br><br>

EXTRACTING DNA: SOAP VS. DETERGENT
Samantha Audell Rosemore
Booker T. Washington High School, Pensacola, FL

The problem was to discover which has more DNA: liquid soaps or liquid detergents? My hypothesis was that liquid soaps would produce more DNA strands than liquid detergents. To begin this project, you need to gather a bag of peas, salt, 70% - 95% isopropyl or ethyl alcohol, meat tenderizer, a blender, measuring cups, a strainer, thin glass containers (test tubes), a stirring rod, three or more types of liquid soaps, and three or more different types of liquid detergents. The next step is to place the following items into the blender: 1/2 cup of peas (100 ml), 1/8 teaspoon of table salt (less than 1 ml), and 1 cup of cold water (200 ml). Next, you blend these items on high for 15 to 20 seconds until it looks like a thin pea soup. Now, you must pour your new thin pea soup into another container (like a measuring cup) through a strainer. Then, you add 2 tablespoons (about 30 ml) of liquid soap or liquid detergent and swirl to mix your mixture. After mixing up your mixture, let the mixture sit for 5 - 10 minutes so that the mixture starts to form different layers. The next step after waiting is to pour the mixture into your thin glass containers or test tubes until they are 1/3 full. Now, you have to add a pinch of meat tenderizer to the mixture and gently stir with your glass rod. Then, you have to slowly pour about the same amount of 70% - 95% isopropyl or ethyl alcohol as the pea soup into your mixture, which is about 1/3 the volume of your thin glass containers. The final step now is to wait about 1 - 1 1/2 hours for the DNA to form in your mixture and then to observe and record your results. This experiment proved my hypothesis that liquid soap detergent had more DNA than liquid detergent. However, I was surprised to find that liquid detergent had almost no DNA at all except a few strands, but the liquid soaps had, at least, 2 -3 times more DNA strands. Out of all the liquid soaps that I used, ULTRA Concentrated Joy dishwashing soap had the most DNA strands and All Small & Mighty laundry detergent had the least amount of DNA strands. I conclude that liquid soaps had more DNA than liquid detergents.

HOW LONG WILL HUMAN EMBRYONIC KIDNEY CELLS EXPRESS A TRANSIENTLY TRANSFECTED GENE?
Bryan Christopher Bardin
Lakewood High School, St.Petersburg, FL, USA

Cellular biology is a field of science that is quickly evolving and now transcends levels previously thought possible. This project employs transient transfections, which is the process of introducing a DNA vector into a cell so that the cellular machinery drives expression of the target gene. Since the DNA of the vector does not get incorporated into the cellular genome, no permanent changes to the cell are thought to occur. "The ability to introduce DNA into cells provides (scientists) with a powerful tool." (Methods in Molecular Biology, Eason Ph. D) In this project human embryonic kidney cells, ATCC HEK293T, were grown to confluency in a six well tissue culture dish, then transfected with EGFP-N1, pDsRed-Express-N1, or the pGL3-Control vectors in solution with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and incubated at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 for 48 hours. The goal of this project is to ascertain the period of time in which human embryonic kidney cells express a transfected gene introduced by liposome mediated transfections. While little is known about the mechanics in which liposomes mediate the transient transfection, they remain the pinnacle of advancement in this field here to fore. The cell cultures were monitored at specific time intervals for red fluorescence and green fluorescence as well as for light emitted in response from the reaction of luciferase on luciferin. Fluorescence was determined using fluorescent microscopy and a visual check for the presence of the fluorescent protein. The results suggest that the human embryonic kidney cells used in this experiment express GFP and RFP for about 28 days. Luciferase activity was detected for 32 days, and the increase likely reflects the increased sensitivity of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. These findings support my hypothesis, which states that the expression of a transiently transfected gene would diminish over time.

IS 2-N-PROPYLPIPERIDINE THE INSECT ATTRACTANT IN PURPLE PITCHER PLANT MUCILAGE?
Austin Hensel
Lincoln Park Academy. Fort Pierce Florida, United States

The purpose of this experiment was to determine if 2-n-propylpiperidine is the insect attractant in purple pitcher plant mucilage. The hypothesis tested was that 2-n-propylpiperidine is the insect attractant in purple pitcher plant mucilage. The hypothesis was based on the fact that 2-n-propylpiperidine is found in large quantities in purple pitcher plant mucilage, and on supporting data from the previous year's project.<br><br> Purple pitcher plant mucilage was extracted from the leaf by shaking the leaf in distilled water. This mucilage extract, 2-n-propylpiperidine, and distilled water, were applied to flypaper attached to wooden stakes. These stakes were placed in tomato fields, and collected the next day. Attracted insects were counted and the most effective solution was determined. Then, 100 microliters of distilled water, distilled water and insecticide, mucus extract, and 2-n-propylpiperidine were separately placed in petri dishes containing aphid covered citrus leaves. The aphid death rate was counted and the most effective solution was determined. <br><br> The results of the experiment support the hypothesis. It is highly probable that 2-n-propylpiperidine is the insect attractant, as insects were equally attracted to 2-n-propylpiperidine and the purple pitcher plant solution and as the 2-n-propylpiperidine solution and the purple pitcher plant solution were approximately equally concentrated. Additionally, all other possible insect attracting compounds in pitcher plant mucilage are present in significantly lesser quantities than 2-n-propylpiperidine Therefore, it can be concluded that 2-n-propylpiperidine is the insect attractant in purple pitcher plant mucilage. This is a major new discovery and could be extremely beneficial to the agriculture industry.<br><br>

DESIGNING GENES
Michael Patrick Boniface
Satellite High School, Satellite Beach, Fl, United States

A genetic disorder that affects many humans worldwide named A1AT deficiency causes the absence or low serum level of A1-Antitrysin. This disorder can, and in most cases will, result in emphysema, asthma, lung failure, liver failure, or death.<br><br> The gene for A1-antitrypsin and the pThioHis cloning vector were cut using a restriction enzyme digest containing Not1 and EcoR1 restriction enzymes. The linear fragment containing the A1AT gene was ligated to the pThioHis cloning vector and transformed into a prokaryotic host (escherichia coli, SURE2 Supercompetent strain). IPTG was added to remove the repressor group and initiate expression of human A1AT.<br><br> DNA from the experimental cells was sequenced. The sequence for human A1AT was found in the sequence from the experimental cells. Samples from the cells were taken and frozen at one hour intervals after the IPTG initiated expression. An ELISA process and analysis was performed to determine the concentration of A1AT in the control and experimental cells at all time points.<br><br> The analysis of the ELISA procedure and lab sequencing data supports the following conclusions: The transformation procedure successfully incorporated the gene for human A1AT into the genome of the prokaryotic escherichia coli cells. The expression of A1AT in the experimental cells increased exponentially with respect to time while the expression of A1AT in the control cells remained linear with respect to time at nominal levels.<br><br> This experimentation represents the first documented case of human A1AT expression in a genetically engineered prokaryotic host cell. <br><br>

VACUOLAR MEMBRANE IS CRITICAL FOR REMOVING INTRACELLULAR ROS
Muhammad Akef Abu-Rmaileh
Little Rock Central High School, Little Rock, AR

The vacuole, the primary degradation compartment of the yeast cell, is regarded as the central and dynamic organelle for the proper functioning of the cell. Last year, the researcher found that treating yeast cell with H2O2, a reactive oxygen species, induces vacuole fragmentation. The researcher hypothesizes that tampering with the vacuolar membrane will accumulate in ROS. The cells were inoculated for 60 hours, allowed them to be incubated with DRC 123 and viewed them under a fluorescent microscope. It is known that mutants (erg6Δ, nyv1Δ, etc) with fragmented vacuoles have shortened lifespan under caloric restriction, a well-established longevity manipulation. Thus, the researcher explored the relationship between intracellular ROS and longevity. Consistent with the researcher’s old observation, mutants (vps18Δ) with highly fragmented vacuoles accumulated high levels of intracellular ROS. To my surprise, mutant (rck1Δ) defective in cell’s response to oxidative stress did not show elevated intracellular ROS. Instead, the researcher found that intra-vacuolar degradation of lipids mediated by Atg15p is critical in decreasing the intracellular ROS. Several longevity mutants (Perg6-ERG2, Perg6-OSH6) accumulated ROS in CR medium but not in YEPD medium. Introducing atg15Δ into Perg6-OSH6 also accumulated ROS. Moreover, blocking sterol depletion from the vacuolar membrane by osh5Δ also induced accumulation of ROS in the longevity mutant Perg6-ERG2. These observations suggest that the vacuole-mediated degradation is a key step in relieving the intracellular ROS stress and thus support longevity.

CAN YEAST BE USED TO EXTRACT ETHANOL FROM NONI JUICE (MORINDA CITRIFOLIA)?
Kiana Wilson
Kahuku High School, Kahuku, HI

My project is the result of research to determine how much ethanol can be extracted from noni (morinda citrifolia) juice using yeast. Yeast is an inexpensive way to cause noni juice to ferment and become alcoholic. I noticed that a new ethanol distillation pump called “eFuel100” can convert discarded wine into ethanol for about 10 cents a gallon. Since fermented noni juice could be considered as wine, I felt that it would be an excellent application for the experiment.<br><br>Every plant has the potential of being converted into ethanol, but some are more efficient than others. Hopefully noni juice will have the potential to be converted into ethanol since it is a native Hawaiian plant and is a renewable energy source that can be produced on the site of a noni farm where it is harvested. The gas being produced is carbon dioxide, CO2 as a result of natural yeast spores that are all around. For every molecule of CO2 produced, there is one molecule of ethanol produced also. The mixture must be greater than 50% ethanol to burn. In the old days, this was a test of whether a whiskey was good or not. If it burned, that was 100% proof that it was good whiskey, consequently, pure ethanol is said to be 200 proof alcohol. The noni juice is most likely 50% or more carbohydrate. The yeast does not do well in fermenting carbohydrates alone, the carbohydrates need to be broken up into the simple sugars for best fermentation so there should be some enzymes that can break it down into it's component sugars, which can then be fermented with yeast to produce ethanol. After the noni has been fermented, the eFuel100 distiller can remove the excess water from the ethanol so it can be used as a fuel for cars and for other types of engines.

EFFECT OF HEAVY METAL IONS ON THE SUGAR METABOLISM IN THE MODEL ORGANISM BAKER'S YEAST!: INHIBITION OF GLYCOLYTIC ENZYMES
Robert Alexander Leonard Stanley Salzmann
Gymnasium Andreanum, Hildesheim, GERMANY

Goal of my biochemical project was to research effects that are comparable to human reactions by using yeast. In three experiment blocks, I researched the inhibitive effects of different heavy metal ions on the sugar degradation in the model organism baker's yeast – to elucidate the possible different mode of action:<br><br>1. For the quantitative experiments, I measured the metabolic activity by measuring the CO2 volume created under the influence of different metals. I compared the inhibitive strengths of the metals to the yeast and also the inhibitive strength of ions of the same metal at different charging levels. I used Copper(II)-sulfate, Copper(I)-chloride, Iron(III)-chloride and Iron(II)-sulfate. Generally the higher charged ions were more inhibitive, and copper was more inhibitive than iron.<br><br>2. In the qualitative experiments, I calculated approximately the point of a completely inhibited metabolism. To achieve this, I tried to detect the substrate which collects in the solution, by using Fehling’s solution and a glucose test. The Fehling’s solution only showed a positive result when used on the fermented end result of the copper salts. To explain the results, we need to know which intermediate can react as a reductant – I consider 5 of the 14 to have this reaction. Further elimination processes leave 3 positions for copper and 8 for the iron salts. <br><br>3. Last I tried to reactivate completely inhibited metabolisms by separating the enzyme-inhibitor-complex using a strong chelating agent (EDTA). I succeeded only when using FeCl3. This might conclude for a reversible inhibition of the organism.

MOLECULAR DYNAMIC SIMULATION OF NEUROGLOBIN: ACTIVE SITE MUTATIONS AND TEMPERATURE EFFECTS
Laura Maria Lopez
Southwestern Educational Society Mayaguez, P.R.

Neuroglobin is a recently discovered member of the globin protein group that is associated to the transport of oxygen of the vertebrate brain. The unusual protein's six coordinate heme iron in its deoxy state and its unbinding rate constants make it an intriguing and exciting system. Moreover, variations in temperature and mutations in the active site cause changes in the amount of oxygen that can be transported. The experiment conducted in this study was focused on the characterization of the changes in the structure of neuroglobin that occur when site-directed mutations and increments in the temperature are performed. The experiment used molecular dynamic computer simulations that ran for 1 to 2 ns using the NAMD package. Several mutated neuroglobin systems were prepared by changing one of the heme pocket residues at positions E11 and B10. The B10 position was mutated with arginine, glycine, and valine; and E11 was mutated with arginine, glycine, and phenylalanine. the single mutated systems were analyzed by means of structural analysis. The root mean square deviation (RMSD)and radius of gyration analysis revealed that in general the protein size and flexibility varies depending on the size of the amino acid that is used for the mutation. Also, the variation on the stavility of the protein at various temperatures was determined. In the range of temperatures used, the molecules showed small changes in the size and flexibility. The results of this study showed that the structure of the protein changes with single point mutations and hence the amount of oxygen that can be transported will be affected.

SMART CONOTOXIN DETECTION KIT BASED ON NOVEL SINGLE-CHAIN FRAGMENT VARIABLE ANTIBODY
Shengxing Yu
Fuzhou No.1 Middle School, Fuzhou, Fujian, CHINA

The highly poisonous conotoxin, a kind of neurotoxin excreted from conus, is a serious threat to marine products. Therefore it is an urgent need of a rapid, effective and sensitive conotoxin detecting method to ensure safety of seafood. This study cloned and expressed the -CTX gene successfully. Total RNA was extracted from the -CTX protein immunized mice and antibody heavy and light chain variable-regions genes were cloned via PCR, and single-chain variable antibody (scFV) genes were synthesized using OE-PCR. Synthesized scFV genes were cloned into phagemid vectors and transformed into E. coli to construct phage antibody library. An anti -CTX scFV with high affinity was obtained by screening the library. With the help of the single chain antibody and competitive ELISA technique, the conotoxin in the sample can be determined. Therefore, a conotoxin detection kit was developed. Its minimum detectable concentration was 0.01 ppm (with a range from 0.01 to 10 ppm), and there was no cross reaction to other types of toxin. This detection kit has been proved to be able to detect conotoxin rapidly, accurately, reliably and specifically.

COMPUTER-ASSISTED IDENTIFICATION OF NOVEL HISTONE DEACETYLASE INHIBITORS: PHASE 3 OF A TWO-YEAR INVESTIGATION
Paul Frederick Baranay
Marian High School, Mishawaka, Indiana, USA

Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors and histone acetyltransferase (HAT) are opposing enzymes responsible for, respectively, the suppression and expression of DNA. Although HDACs are essential for life, an excess of HDAC recruitment has been correlated to the growth of cancerous tumors. HDAC inhibitors disrupt the HDAC-HAT cycle, causing apoptosis and differentiation and thereby eliminating the tumor. In the future, HDAC inhibitors may be used as key elements of a targeted anti-cancer drug therapy. Although many HDAC inhibitors have already been identified, the search for even more effective inhibitors continues. In this experiment, virtual screening software was used to analyze a library of never-before-investigated molecules and determine their effectiveness as HDAC inhibitors. The virtual screening program AutoDock 3.0, which employs a Lamarckian genetic algorithm, was used to "dock" members of this library to two isoforms of the HDAC enzyme, HDAC6 and HDAC8.<br><br> Of the compounds investigated, one of them--designated as molecule #0017--was shown to be an extraordinarily effective inhibitor of both HDAC6 and HDAC8. It bound to HDAC6 and HDAC8 with extremely low energies: -6.05 x 10^5 kcal/mol and -6.90 X 10^5 kcal/mol, respectively. Moreover, for both isoforms, molecule #0017 favored configurations where its terminal benzene ring was just 1.4 angstroms to 2.5 angstroms away from the HDAC's active site, indicating direct inhibition. Molecule #0017 is without a doubt well worth further investigation through both virtual screening and in vivo experimentation.

BOVINE AGE VERSUS CHEESE QUALITY
Guinevere Patricia Ellen Bitker
Westbrook-Walnut Grove High School, Westbrook, MN, United States

The reason I chose to do this project is because I wanted to see if the age of the cow had an effect on the quality of the cheese that is produced.<br><br>I did this by first milking the cows. Then I made the cheese using, rennet and two starter cultures, made from Mesophilic A and Mesophilic M bacteria cultures. Then I pressed the cheeses after separating the curds from the whey. Then I waxed the cheeses and let them age. I cut a large chunk out of the cheese wheels to do testing on them. I tested the meltability, the percent moisture content, the density, the crumble and the pH of each cheese sample. I have not yet found any set results because my project is still an ongoing process and will not have any set results until the desired age is reached which is approximately seven years.

CAFFEINE: THE HIDDEN RISK
William Wilford Heise IV
Canterbury School, Fort Myers, FL

The purpose of this project was to determine what effects caffeine has on daphnia and to compare these results to similar experiments with humans. If the researcher exposes daphnia to different levels of caffeine solutions then the researcher predicts that the daphnia’s heart rates will increase when exposed to stronger solutions and these results will be consistent with research done by doctors on humans. The experiment consisted of preparing the following solutions of caffeine: 25mg/ounce; 12.5mg/ounce; and 6.25mg/ounce. Each individual daphnia was exposed to a solution for two minutes, and the heart rate counted for thirty seconds. The following were the results in heart beats per minute of the daphnia: no caffeine, average heart rate of 266.3; 6.25mg per ounce solution, average heart rate of 334.2; 12.5mg/ounce solution, average heart rate of 339.8; and 25mg per ounce solution, average heart rate of 325.5. The deaths of the daphnia were as follows: no caffeine - no deaths; 6.25mg per ounce solution - 2 deaths; 12.5mg per ounce solution - 4 deaths; and 25mg per ounce solution - 5 deaths. These results were compared to tests done on human subjects. The hypothesis was partially proven correct. The results showed that caffeine did greatly increase the heart rate of daphnia which corresponded partially to doctor’s studies. However the increase in heart rates did not increase steadily with a higher concentration of caffeine.

GENERATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF RESPIRATORY-DEFICIENT YEAST COX17 AND CYTOC1 MUTANTS
Geoffrey Allen Vargish
Lake Brantley High School, Altamonte Springs, FL, USA

This project was developed in order to create a mutation in cytochrome c oxidase subunit 17 (COX17) and CYTOC1 of the electron transport chain in respiratory – deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast). Study on the yeasts’ sensitivity to reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen was then done using exposure to .1 mM Nitrotyrosine and 1 mM Paraquat.<br><br> The mutants were created by extracting the pADCL plasmid from Escherichia coli, amplification of the Leucine (Leu) gene and primers through PCR and through transformation and homologous recombination the PCR product was incorporated into the mitochondria. Results were based on growth on Leucine deficient media. An assay was then developed to test the inhibition of Cytochrome c oxidase in the COX17 mutant. Results were measured by absorbance at 550 nm. Following this test the mutated yeast, ATP2Ä, COX17Ä, QÄ, COR1Ä and the wild type yeast were exposed to.1 mM Nitrotyrosine and 1 mM Paraquat. Results were measured in percent viability, which was determined by the number of colonies at the zero hour divided by the number of colonies present at four hours.<br><br> After five attempts of transformation the mutation was completed and proved both phenotypically and genotypically for COX17 but not for CYTOC1. Results of the assay came back inconclusive as to whether Cytochrome c oxidase was properly inhibited. Percent viability results were as expected for all mutants except for COX17Ä, which showed a significantly enhanced sensitivity to reactive oxygen (1 mM Paraquat). Further analysis using western blotting must be done to determine the full cause of the enhanced sensitivity.<br><br>

THE ROLE OF PAXILLIN BINDING IN THE PHOSPHORYLATION OF MERLIN, THE NEUROFIBROMATOSIS TYPE II TUMOR SUPPRESSOR
Poonam Kirti Kalidas
Lake Highland Preparatory, Orlando, FL, USA

Neurofibromatosis Type II (NF2) is a disorder that affects 1 in 40,000 people and causes the formation of schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas of the nervous system. The hallmark of this disorder is the development of bilateral vestibular schwannomas of the eighth cranial nerve, which often results in a loss of hearing, dizziness, and/or tinnitus. The schwannomas associated with NF2 are caused by a mutation in the NF2 gene, which encodes for the protein Merlin, or Schwannomin. Merlin has been characterized as a tumor suppressor, and its tumor suppressing abilities are regulated by phosphorylation. Therefore, the focus of this study is to determine if Paxillin binding is required for Merlin phosphorylation by Pak at Serine518.<br><br>Biochemical and cell biological approaches were used for this study. First, RT-4 Schwannoma cells were transiently transfected with cDNA encoding Xpress-tagged Merlin mutants and immuno-precipitations and –blots were performed. Second, Normal Rat Schwann Cells were transiently transfected with cDNA encoding GFP-tagged Merlin mutants and cells were fixed and immunostained. Results show that PBD1 is the essential site for Pak-Rac/Cdc42 mediated phosphorylation at S518. Without PBD1, phosphorylation levels drop by roughly 90%. When phosphorylated, Merlin becomes an inactive tumor suppressor and promotes cell growth. Therefore, phosphorylation must be regulated in order o suppress tumors. These results can hopefully aid in the creation of a drug or treatment that will inhibit Pak phosphorylation as a treatment for Neurofibromatosis Type II. <br><br>

THE SELF-ASSEMBLY AND GROWTH OF MODEL PROTOCELL MEMBRANES
Kirstine la Cour
Munkensdam Gymnasium, Kolding, DENMARK

What is life? How did it emerge on Earth? Is it possible to create artificial life?<br><br>The advancements of science and technology have enabled scientists of our time to be within a striking distance of understanding as well as imitating the fundamental characteristics of life. <br><br>The term “protocell” denotes simple, artificially constructed cell-like systems composed of three essential components: a metabolism, an information component and a container. These components are all required for the properties of self-maintenance, reproduction and the ability to evolve - the hallmarks of a living system.<br><br>The focal point of this project is the construction of a functional container component. The container should be created from a prebiotically relevant compound and should furthermore exhibit the ability to self-assemble and grow.<br><br>The container will consist of two kinds of short chain fatty acids, i.e. oleic and decanoic acid, which have been chosen because of the likelihood of their presence on early earth. The actual membrane growth is accomplished by injecting decanoic acid micelles into an oleic acid vesicle solution. This will cause the lipid molecules from the micelle structures to incorporate into the vesicle bilayer, thereby causing an increase in volume. <br><br>Undertaking a number of pilot tests has provided a collection of preliminary results along with valuable insights to the experimental procedures, thus laying the foundation for future improvements and extensions of the system. <br><br>The project thereby contributes to the ongoing developing of the fully functional protocell as well as the further examination of living systems and their origin on Earth.

IDENTIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF ATYPICAL SNARE COMPLEXES IN PLASMODIUM FALCIPARUM
Preethi Raghavan
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, FL

Asexual forms of the malaria parasite P. falciparum exhibit several unusual vesicle transport pathways that are likely to be crucial for their intracellular survival in human erythrocytes. Vesicle targeting and fusion in eukaryotic cells require an ordered assembly of distinct sets of SNAREs between specific transport vesicles and their target compartments. SNAREs are classified as R- or Q-SNAREs based on the presence of a conserved arginine or glutamine residue in their core motifs. Assembly of fusion-competent SNARE complexes in vivo is a highly selective process requiring the participation of at least one R-SNARE and three Q-SNAREs. <br><br>In an attempt to map out the putative SNARE complexes in P. falciparum, the combinatorial binding specificities of two Plasmodium R-SNAREs, PfVAMP7 and PfVAMP8 will be analyzed. In order to do so, in vitro binding assays will be performed by the utilization of Far-Western analysis. To confirm the results of this assay in vivo Co-Immunoprecipitation analysis followed by mass spectrometry will be utilized to identify binding partners. Both of these methods identify protein-protein interactions. Preliminary data does suggest the presence of a trans-SNARE complex. A Far Western analysis run with PfVAMP7 does indicate interactions at the following binding Q-SNARE spots: PfBet1, PfBos1, PfSyn6, PfSyn7, PfSyn17, and PfVti1. To confirm these results, a Co-Immunoprecipitation will be run and sent out for mass spectrometry. Further experimentation and analysis will delineate the trans-SNARE complexes formed with PfVAMP7 and PfVAMP8.

TYPE 2 DIABETES IN THE AGE OF EPIGENETICS: DIET TAKES OVER!
Sailee Yadav
James W. Martin High School, Arlington, TX

Type 2 diabetes and obesity are major public health priorities because of their high prevalence and incidence in the U.S. population. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in ten US adults has diabetes. This raises a vital need for a change of course in type 2 diabetes. <br><br>Although the mechanisms underlying type 2 diabetes are incompletely understood, epigenetics have recently been established as a massive regulatory machine. The biochemical modifications that govern epigenetics are DNA methylation and histone modifications; these processes are catalyzed by the enzymes DNA methyl transferases (DNMTs) and histone methyl transferases (HMTs). In this project, we checked the effect of dietary constituents on epigenetics based on our hypothesis that nutrition is the main player in the epigenetic repertoire which regulates gene expression and alters disease susceptibility through epigenetic modifications. <br><br>We profiled how dietary factors contribute to epigenetics by checking the activity of DNMTs, HMTs and DNA methylation of CpG island of selected genes (SMC1, GST, Ralbp1) in cultured cells (HEK293) treated with vitamins, glucose, free fatty acids, cholesterol and 4-hydroxynonenal, a byproduct of unsaturated fatty acids. Our preliminary results showed that diet affects the expression of stress responsive genes. The mean and standard deviation of three independent experiments was calculated. Our data indicates that nutrition alters epigenetics in cultured cells. Since epigenetic changes often precede disease pathology, our ultimate goal is to find food/supplements that switch on good genes and switch off bad genes epigenetically and prevent the population from obesity and type 2 diabetes.

CHARACTERIZATION OF A BIOPHYSICS MODEL TO EVALUATE REGULATION OF THE P53 PROTEIN
Pranali H Dalvi
International Baccalaureate at Bartow High School, Bartow, FL

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly. This protein misfolding disease, or proteopathy, results when amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cleaved by the gamma-secretase enzyme into smaller fragments which accumulate as senile plaques of the beta amyloid protein, a hydrophobic 39-43 residues amino acid peptide. These senile plaques cause the devastating symptoms associated with AD such as cognitive dysfunction, memory loss, and language breakdown. A series of biochemical events cause multicellular organisms to initiate a process of programmed cell death termed apoptosis. p53 is a 53 kilodalton protein that plays a pivotal role in initiating apoptosis when DNA damage is irreparable. The p53 protein's primary function is to regulate the cell cycle and to conserve genomic stability by preventing mutation. p53 activation, in response to stress, is marked by (1) an increase in the half-life of the p53 protein which leads to the aggregation of p53 and (2) a conformational change of the p53 protein which forces the protein to assume the role of a transcription regulator due to the phosphorylation of its N-terminal domain. Therefore, p53 acts as a tumor suppressor protein and prevents carcinogenesis. Excessive apoptosis is proposed to characterize neurologic disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Therefore, it was hypothesized that an upregulation of the p53 protein would be characteristic of cells with the Alzheimer’s-associated APP mutation. By Western Blot analysis and causal mapping, the level of p53 protein was quantified and the biochemical interactions were elucidated, respectively.

THE CHARACTERIZATION OF HUMAN EPIDERMAL STEM CELLS

The role of Notch signaling in the regulation of growth and differentiation of epithelial stem cells is poorly understood. While specific markers for epidermal stem cells have not yet been identified; the Notch signaling pathway, a regulator of cell growth and differentiation, has shown to be differentially expressed in interfollicular epidermal stem cells. This study sought to demonstrate the presence and distribution of Notch and its ligands, Delta and Jagged, in epidermal stem cells, and thereby characterize this subpopulation. <br><br> Human neonatal foreskin samples were used to obtain isolated epidermal cells. Cells that were shown to be negative for connexin43, a gap junction protein, and positive for keratin14, a basal marker, were classified as presumptive stem cells (PSC). This sorted subpopulation was shown to be small and agranular by flow cytometry analysis. After two weeks in cell culture, PSC revealed a proliferative potential three times greater than non-sorted cells. The PSC exhibited increased expression of Delta and Jagged ligands than the general population. Additionally, RT-PCR analysis confirmed the presence of Jagged and Delta; however, only Jagged was observed in immunohistochemistry tests. Notch components were identified in the epidermis at the cell-, protein-, and mRNA-level. The data suggests that variations in Notch ligand expression could be used as a potential markers for stem cells of the epithelium; however, further research is necessary to make definitive conclusions, which would provide better insight into Notch regulatory pathways, allowing for eventual disease treatment.<br><br>

ABP1, A HOMOLOGUE OF THE HUMAN CENP-B PROTEIN, IS REQUIRED FOR EFFICIENT INITIATION OF DNA REPLICATION IN THE FISSION YEAST S.POMBE
Cristina Victoria Fernandez
Pine Crest School, Ft. Lauderdale Fl, United States of America

abp1, a protein found in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (S. pombe), has been shown to bind to several sites of the ARS (autonomously replicating sequence) element ars3002 origin (3). When abp1 was purified, its binding to sites on the origins of replication suggests that it may have roles in DNA replication. In this study analysis of DNA content shows that Äabp1 mutants arrest before the initiation of replication. Yeast two hybrid experiments show a physical interaction between abp1 and cdc23, an established replication initiation protein, suggesting that the two proteins interact and are involved in the initiation of replication. Results from viability tests show that an abp1 and cdc23 double mutant is synthetically lethal. <br><br> With proof of both a genetic and physical interaction of abp1 with cdc23, abp1 is implicated in having a key role in the initiation of replication. Previously abp1 has only been shown to have a function in gene silencing. This investigation suggests a completely novel role of abp1 in the control of the cell cycle. Due to the significant level of amino acid sequence homology with its human homologue CENP-B, it would be interesting to pursue a possible role for CENP-B in the initiation of human DNA replication.<br><br>

PRESERVATIVES: HELP OR HINDRANCE?
Benjamin Ross Fruits
JW Mitchell High School , New Port Richey, FL, USA

This research was conducted to determine if preservatives in food – specifically sodium benzoate – would have an effect on living organisms.<br><br> By adding a preservative/water solution to some plants and just water to others, it was hypothesized that preservatives would have an adverse affect on the organisms.<br><br> The first step was to research the most common preservatives found in foods. Plants and materials needed for my experiment were obtained. The preservative was acquired after talking to bakers and pharmacists. Solutions of equal parts, 5 ml preservative mixed with 5ml water and 10 ml plain water were prepared. Plants were watered identically everyday. Changes in color, size, and appearance were monitored and recorded during three trials.<br><br> In week one, no changes were evident. In week two, plants watered with preservatives showed signs of stress, plants without preservatives did not. Leaves on plants watered with preservatives were curling and color was fading. During week three, in plants watered with sodium benzoate, color variations began to appear, changes were definitive and small holes developed. Plants without preservatives showed little color change and minimal withering. Although more experimenting is needed to be conclusive, this shows that there is something in preservatives that affect living organisms.<br><br> The results of the experiment verified my hypothesis. The plants watered with preservatives showed signs of stress: color change, withering, and deterioration. Plants watered without preservatives showed no signs of stress. Using plant reactions, preservatives appear to have an adverse effect on living organisms.<br><br>

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ENZYME TREATMENT ON NATURAL FIBERS: FOCUSING ON DYE ABILITY AND TENSILE STRENGTH
Kimberly Nicole Braulick
St. Mary's High School, Sleepy Eye, MN

This project examined the effectiveness of enzyme treatment on spun silk fiber, yak fiber, and silk and yak blends. This project explores ways to find a process that is environmentally safe, reusable, and creates a durable fiber, to keep the process legal, the costs down, and the quality at its peak. <br><br> The treatments used on the fibers included a bleaching and enzyme treatment. The fibers are first added to the bleaching solution, and then agitated in the pretreatment. After the pretreatment is complete, the enzyme treatment takes place. The enzyme treatment has varied temperatures. <br><br> The fibers are treated at the lowest temperature had the best effect on the fiber. All of the fibers were smoothened; however, the yak fiber still had some remaining scales. The silk fiber was completely degummed. While the blend showed the same results as both the silk and yak fibers. The fibers were then ready for dyeing. The treatments and dyeing weakened the fibers, but, not to the extent that the fibers would lose overall quality. Blending the silk and yak fibers significantly improved the quality of both fibers. <br><br> Considerable funds will be saved in the textile industry, since there will be no need to produce new solutions for every treatment. Due to the low ideal temperature, the fibers can be treated together, and can provide for an energy efficient and safe process. To further this experiment, different enzymes or protein fibers could be used. An addition continuation may include blends of protein fibers with synthetic or cellulose fibers.

TRANSIENT GENE EXPRESSION IN HEK-293 CELLS: EFFICACY OF LIPOSOMAL TRANSFECTION FOR PROTEIN PRODUCTION BY SUSPENSION CULTURES
Yueyang Li
Montgomery Blair High School, Silver Spring, MD, USA

Recombinant proteins (r-proteins) are potent but expensive components of pharmaceuticals used in the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. To counter the rising costs and shortages of recombinant drugs, a more efficient method must be developed for the large-scale production of r-proteins. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the efficacy of liposomal transfection for large-scale protein production in suspension cultures. Suspension-adapted cells were transfected using lipid-, calcium-phosphate-, and polymer-based methods. Various cell lines, transfection media, and media components were also tested. The protein yield by suspension cultures was compared with that attained using the traditional adherent-mode cells. This study demonstrates that the liposomal vector, lipofectamine, is not suitable for the large-scale transfection of cells in suspension. The data also suggests that the 293F cell line/FreeStyle medium transfection system allows for higher protein yield regardless of transfection vector. Ultimately, recombinant proteins were produced at a faster rate, a significantly reduced cost, and a 10-fold greater yield. These findings hold implications for the greater affordability and availability of medical drugs.

I GOT C: A STUDY OF EPIGALLOCATECHIN GALLATE AND SONICATION ON THE STABILITY OF VITAMIN C IN DEAERATED FRESH ORANGE JUICE USING TITRATION
Nirva Vassa

A novel study was designed to investigate the effect of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a natural inhibitor of pectin methylesterase, on Vitamin C retention in deaerated fresh orange juice under sonication. The purpose was to study the kinetics of Ascorbic Acid (AA) degradation in deaerated fresh OJ with and without EGCG in amber glass containers at different sonication treatment times using titration. <br><br>AA levels were studied using classic starch-iodine method. The iodine was standardized with a known AA concentration. Starch was used as an indicator to determine the amount of AA present in OJ. Experiments were conducted over 10 days and results were tabulated. <br><br>Results indicated that the retention of Vitamin C in deaerated fresh OJ is dependent on EGCG and sonication treatment times. A t-test concluded that the addition of EGCG to deaerated OJ under different sonication times had a significant effect on Vitamin C retention. AA deterioration in samples ranged from 2.18% to 9.12% after 10 days. OJ at 30 minutes of sonication with EGCG retained the most amount of Vitamin C while deaerated container without sonication and EGCG retained the least. EGCG, sonication treatment times and deaeration appear to have an additive effect on Vitamin C retention. Kinetic study reveals that AA in fresh OJ follows first order reaction rate law while AA in OJ with EGCG follows both zero and first order reaction rate laws. <br><br>The study has processing and packaging applications for preservative free OJ fortified with EGCG; introduction of a first juice extractor with a sonicator and deaerator to store fresh OJ at home for the health conscious society; an innovative home kit with titration app for consumer use; and food science applications for the Space Industry.

EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF NITRIC OXIDE ON MANGANESE SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE
Tiancheng Zhang
Pulaski Academy, Little Rock, AR

A significant factor in renal allograft rejection is the nitration and subsequent inactivation of manganese superoxide dismutase. Manganese superoxide dismutase is an antioxidant enzyme which keeps levels of reactive oxygen species in check to prevent oxidative stress. Nitric oxide, which is presumed to play a major role in the inactivation of manganese superoxide dismutase, is an inorganic radical and signaling molecule; upon reaction with superoxide, it readily forms peroxynitrite, which has been shown to severely inhibit manganese superoxide dismutase activity through the nitration of key tyrosine residues of manganese superoxide dismutase. S-nitrosoglutathione, an organic nitric oxide donor, is suspected to be a significant factor in the inactivation of manganese superoxide dismutase. The results of an in vitro assay using a spectrophotometer to measure the rate of reduction of cytochrome c at the 550 nm absorbance level concludes that s-nitrosoglutathione does not yield a statistically significant impact on manganese superoxide dismutase activity in the presence or the absence of superoxide generated by xanthine and xanthine oxidase in the course of the sample treatment as compared through a two-sample t-test. Therefore, our results suggest that the hypothesized reaction pathway of s-nitrosoglutathione donating nitric oxide to react with superoxide to form peroxynitrite is incorrect due to negligible peroxynitrite formation concluded by the absence of a statistically significant reduction in activity. Ultimately, while s-nitrosoglutathione may still play a role in the inactivation of manganese superoxide dismutase, it is not through a direct reaction pathway or an indirect reaction pathway involving interaction with superoxide present.

DENITRIFICATION PREVENTION IN AN AQUAPONICS SYSTEM
Abraham Kwan
Moanalua High School, Honolulu, HI

Aquaponics system was developed for use in the Pacific Islands, and has been estimated to generate six times as much produce per unit of land while only using around 2% of the water compared to the traditional soil agriculture methods. Fish eat feed and produce nitrogenous waste in the form of ammonia. This is broken down by autotrophic bacteria called Nitrosomonas bacteria, converted to nitrite, then nitrate, by Nitrobacter. However, when the dissolved oxygen declines to around 1 mg/L, the aerobic nitrifying bacteria are inactive and the anaerobic denitrification heterotrophs convert nitrate into nitrogen gas, which is then lost into the atmosphere. This destroys the fertilizing effect of the fish for the system.<br><br>Two aquaponics systems were set up, A and B. Both tanks were filled with 200 L of water, aerated with a 50W pump, and stocked with 2.5 kg of tilapia. Tray B was also aerated with two air stones. Lettuces were then sprouted and distributed to the two systems. Water chemistry was done twice a week to determine ammonium, nitrite, dissolved oxygen, and nitrate. At the end of the experiment, a T-test was done to compare the averages of dissolved oxygen, nitrate, and mass of plant growth. Significant difference in the dissolved oxygen and nitrate levels were in the two trays with p=8.6x10-17 and p=0.05 respectively. However, the plant growth was not significant with p=0.09. The nitrate level obtained was 20 mg/L and apparently this is still an acceptable level for the plants to grow. This experiment proves that denitrification occurs at the 3 mg/L levels of oxygen obtained but that the resulting nitrate levels are adequate for plant growth.

HEME PROTEIN MOIETY: SYMBIOSIS BEWTEEN LUCINA PECTINATA AND CHEMOAUTOTROPH BACTERIA
Alexandra Marie Saavedra
Southwestern Educational Society, P.O. Box 40, Mayaguez P.R. 00681

One of the mysteries of the deep sea fauna of the hydrothermal vents may be addressed by studying 'Lucina pectinata'. Of the three hemoglobins in its gills, hemoglobin I (HbI) has been the only one known that reacts with hydrogen sulfide (H2S). This permits the clam to survive in the black sulfide mud of mangroves swamps in Puerto Rico. Hemoglobin I is also isolated with a cysteine rich protein (PCys) at the active site that should influence the interaction with H2S. This study pretended to determine the interaction between HbI and HbIPCys with various concentrations of H2S. Comparisons of the HbI and HbIPCys affinity for H2S were used to determine the role of PCys in H2S binding.<br><br> The ctenidias were processed, homogenized, centrifuged, submitted to size exclusion chromatography and Amicon ultrafiltration to obtain hemoglobin I with the cysteine rich protein (HbIPCys). Ion exchange chromatography helped obtain hemoglobin I (HbI). Both products were diluted. Once titrated, hydrogen sulfide was diluted to different concentrations. Stopped-flow kinetic data provided the association rate (Kon). Data from the UV-VIS spectrophotometer helped calculate the disassociation rate (Koff).<br><br> Data suggested that Kon and Koff for HbI were smaller than for HbIPCys, respectively. When calculated, HbI had a greater constant of affinity (2.84x10^7) in comparison to HbIPCys (3.49x10^6) suggesting that the protein may modulate the affinity for hemoglobin I.

THE EFFECT OF AMYLOID BETA EXPOSURE ON PROTEIN SUMOYLATION IN MOUSE ASTROCYTES
Jessica Mingming Lee
York High School, Yorktown, VA

The purpose of this experiment was to observe the effects of amyloid-beta 42 exposure with time as a variable on protein SUMOylation in mouse astrocytes, imitating pathological conditions found in patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). SUMO is a protein found in all animal cells that regulates the activities of other protein, and amyloid-beta 42 is found in higher concentrations in the brains of AD patients. Astrocytes recently have been shown to play a possibly greater role in AD, so they were the type of cells used. <br><br>The experimental method was then tested using H2O2 as the variable in order to verify that it worked. SUMOylation levels decreased, a finding which was consistent with previous research done. The astrocytes were then exposed for either 0 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, or 4 hours. The samples were lysed, and a Western Blotting technique was implemented in order to obtain the SUMoylated proteins; they were marked with fluorescent antibodies and measured using an infrared scanner. <br><br>The experiments showed that SUMOylation increased significantly and peaked at 1 hour exposure for SUMO 2/3 and mono SUMO 2/3. The levels decreased back to control levels at 4 hours, indicating that the effects were not long-term. <br><br>The results showed that amyloid-beta 42 did have an effect on protein SUMOylation, which could be involved in harmful processes that can aggravate AD. The next step would be to find out what proteins SUMOylation with amyloid-beta exposure affects and possibly developing a drug to block this increase in the end.

ISOLATION OF DIOSGENIN
Andrew Derry-Farrell
Bradenton Preparatory Academy, Bradenton, FL, USA

My project involved trying to isolate the biologically important steroid, diosgenin, from a local species of air potato, dioscorea bulbifera. My hypothesis was if the local species of air potato contains diosgenin, then I should be able to isolate it from the plant. In doing this project I would also get experience with advanced laboratory techniques.<br><br>I used two different procedures to isolate diosgenin from the air potato. The first involved extraction of the plant with ethanol followed by hydrolysis with 2N hydrochloric acid (HCl). The product was obtained by extraction with hexanes. In the second procedure I used 3.5N HCl to cleave the saponins in the plant first, and then I extracted any steroids present using hexanes.<br><br>I ended up with the same two component mixture in both procedures according to analysis by thin layer chromatography (TLC), and the same yield of material (0.22%) from the plant samples. I conducted the analysis using ethyl acetate/hexanes as the solvent system and found two spots with retardation factors (Rf) of 0.09 and 0.27. I analyzed a commercial sample of diosgenin and it showed one spot with an Rf value of 0.18. The comparison of the TLC data indicated that neither component in these mixtures was diosgenin. The above data caused me to reject my hypothesis because there was no diosgenin in this species of air potato, at least according to TLC analysis.<br><br>Possible continuations of this work would to isolate and identify the two components in the extract and to analyze other species of air potato to see if they contain diosgenin.<br><br>

A STEP TOWARDS CURING MALARIA: THE IDENTIFICATION AND POTENTIAL WEAKNESS OF HEME DETOXIFICATION PROTEIN
Laura Christine Vogelaar
Blacksburg High School, Blacksbburg, VA

When chloroheme is mixed with heme detoxification protein it causes the chloroheme to form a crystalline structure. A powder diffraction of the crystalline structure revealed that it matched the calculated pattern of hemozoin, a dimer that a malaria parasite forms in its digestive vacuole. A powder diffraction of the commercially available chloroheme did not match with the calculated pattern of chloroheme.<br><br> Recrystallization of the chloroheme involved letting a concentrated sodium chloroheme solution diffuse through dialysis tubing into a mixture of chloroheme dissolved in glacial acetic acid, tetrachloroethane, and pyridine while being heated to 120 degrees Celsius then cooled. A powder diffraction of the recrystallized chloroheme matched the calculated pattern better, but a single crystal diffraction revealed that the structure is the same as documented, with different parameters. The past structure is inaccurate due to a lack of technology when it was discovered. <br><br> The individual interaction between heme detoxification protein and chloroheme produces hemozoin; therefore the heme detoxification is responsible for the creation of the hemozoin in malaria. Because free heme is toxic to malaria, and the heme detoxification protein causes the heme to form hemozoin, the protein is vital to malaria’s ability to survive in red blood cells. Inhibiting this protein’s function would make it so the malaria parasite could no longer live in red blood cells.

FUNCTIONALLY PREDICTIVE POSITIONS IN WATER AND GLYCEROL TRANSPORT PROTEINS
Corbin Andrew Burstein
Blanche Ely High School, Pomano Beach, Florida, United States

Aquaporins, aquaglyceroporins, and glycerol facilitators are three related families of membrane transport proteins, each with unique solute specificity. Since the discovery of the first aquaporin in 1992, 'hnAQP1', each of these families have grown substantially. With ready electronic access to the sequences and published functions, of roughly 57 in all, the researcher set out to create a systematic way of identifying the function of uncharacterized, potential aquaporins from only their sequence. Using PubMed, a NIH resource, 57 functionally assayed proteins were selected across multiple organisms (bacteria, plants, humans, etc.). Swiss-Prot, EMBL, and Genbank were then used to access these sequences. Water specific proteins were lumped into the 'AQP' category, and proteins with any glycerol capacity were considered 'GlpF'. Then, the sequences were aligned through ClustalW, and all positions were screened for functional markers. Ten sites were identified based on similarity within a category, and difference towards the other. This was a major improvement over previous models, which accounted for fewer, weaker markers. The model markers were generally successful in predicting the functions of various proteins, but may possibly be limited to proteins related to those already within the model.

EFFECT OF INCREASED FRUCTOSE-2,6-BISPHOSPHATE ON THE AKT LEVELS OF 293 CELLS
Kyrstin Timara Underbakke
Maranatha Christian Academy, Brooklyn Park, MN, USA

This project is to determine the effects of the bifunctional enzyme (6-phosphofructo, 2-kinase/fructose-2, 6-bisphosphotase), which increases the levels of fructose-2, 6-bisphosphate, on the activation (and therefore functionality) of Akt, a protein involved in other vital pathways that is farther downstream in the metabolic pathway. I hypothesized that increased amounts of fructose-2, 6-bisphosphate will increase the amount of phosphorylated Akt.<br><br>Western blots were run to determine the amount of total Akt and phosphorylated Akt in 293 cells (tissue cultured human kidney cells that are a standard in biochemistry) that had been either in a control group, a group treated with a GFP virus (a virus that does essentially nothing relevant to this experiment) as a control virus, and a group treated with a double mutant virus to increase the bifunctional enzyme. Each of these groups was divided into three subgroups: those in the control, those treated with wortmannin which stops insulin, and those treated with insulin. The blots were developed and shown that, though the total Akt stayed about the same, the amount of activated Akt varied. The activated Akt in the control groups was about the same, but the activated Akt in the double mutant group was considerably more than the others. In each of these groups, the group treated with insulin showed more activated Akt than the control, and the wortmannin-treated cells showed very little to no activated Akt.<br><br>My hypothesis was correct. Increased levels of F-2, 6-P2 increase the levels of activated Akt.<br><br>

XAF-1C SENSITIZES CELLS TO TRAIL-INDUCED APOPTOSIS
Taylor Steven Conrad
Caddo Parish Magnet High School, Shreveport, LA 71106 USA

Apoptosis, also called programmed cell death, is the highly regulated process by which individual cells self destruct. XAF-1 (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis associated factor 1) is a protein that indirectly regulates caspase activity and promotes apoptosis. A novel splice variant of XAF-1, termed XAF-1C, has been discovered that may also play a role in apoptosis. Many cancer cells express low levels of XAF-1 [hereafter referred to as XAF-1(A)] and XAF-1C, partially accounting for their resistance to extra-cellular inducers of apoptosis released by the body’s immune system. One such inducer, TRAIL, is released by the body’s natural killer (NK) cells and selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells. Low XAF-1(A) expression could be a factor in TRAIL resistance among cancer cells. <br><br>To determine the biological function of XAF-1C, MDA-231, MDA-435, and PC3 cells stably transfected with expression vectors encoding XAF-1(A) and XAF-1C to compare their apoptotic response were cultured. Transfected cells were treated with TRAIL in different doses. Apoptotic response was measured indirectly as a reduction of cell viability and directly using flow cytometry.<br><br> XAF-1C expression caused a significant increase in sensitization to apoptosis when compared to XAF-1(A) transfectants and control cell lines. This raises the possibility of using the XAF-1C protein or gene for combination treatment with other cancer therapeutic agents such as TRAIL to sensitize cells to apoptosis.<br><br>

EXPLORING INTERACTION IN A CENTRIN SFI1P COMPLEX
Roberto Andres Rios
Southwestern Educational Society, Mayaguez, PUERTO RICO

Centrin is a calcium binding protein containing 172 amino acids. Three human isoforms have been found: hcen3, associated with the spindle poles, hcen2 with centriole separation and duplication, and hcen1 essential to sperm motility and the first zygote division. The centrin gene has been linked to a phenotype known as vfl2 resulting from a single point mutation causing cell death. Recently, centrin¡¦s biological target protein was found, known as Sfi1 containing 1242 amino acids and twenty three binding sites for centrin. Like, centrin it localizes to the centrioles. <br><br>Transformed Escherichia coli BL21 DE3 cells were grown using a fermentor in 2xYT media containing ampicillin. Once the bacterial culture reached log phase, they were induced with Isopropyl-D-thiogalactoside to express hcen1 or mutant hcen1 (E105K). These proteins were isolated and purified by chromatographic methods and fractions containing the desired protein pooled. The purified proteins were then analyzed by UV spectroscopy, SDS-PAGE, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and sent for MS analysis. Finally, hcen1-Sfi1p21 and hcen1 (E105K)-Sfi1p21 complexes (6:1, mol ratio) were analyzed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). In both cases the binding was exothermic and the thermodynamic data for hcen1-Sfi1p21 was the following: N 1.33 ¡Ó 0.0165, Ka 1.59 x107 ¡Ó 2.48 x106 M-1, ƒ´H -1.72 x104 ¡Ó 301.1 kcal/mol and ƒ´S -23.8 kcal/mol, while for hcen1(E105K)-Sfi1p21 N 0.4 ¡Ó 0.0132, Ka 3.24 x105 ¡Ó 4.33 x 104 M-1, ƒ´H -1.301 x 104 ¡Ó 536.5 kcal/mol and ƒ´S -19.3 kcal/mol), suggesting a Sfip21 has a lowered affinity for hcen1(E105K).

PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED WITH GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE IMPACT OF THEIR ENERGY CHOICES ON OUR ENVIROMENT ARE STARTING TO REALIZE BIOGAS DIGESTERS ARE A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCE. I WANTED TO HELP HOMEOWNERS CONSIDERING INVESTING IN A BIOGAS DIGESTER BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW TO INCREASE PRODUCTION AMOUNTS FROM THEIR DIGESTERS. MY EXPERIMENT WAS DESIGNED TO TEST WHICH MIXTURE OF MANURE AND BIOMASS ADDITIVE WOULD PRODUCE THE MOST BIO-GAS. RESEARCH ON THIS SUBJECT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE AMERICANS NEED TO OBTAIN MORE ENERGY SECURITY AND REDUCE THEIR NEED OF FOREIGN OIL IMPORTS. I GATHERED MY MANURE AND WEIGHED OUT THE EXACT AMOUNTS NEEDED FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL SLURRY. I THEN ADDED MY INDEPENDENT VARIABLES INTO THE APPROPRIATE SLURRIES. I ASSEMBLED MY ERLYNMEYER FLASKS AND TUBING TO CREATE MY DIGESTERS. THE SLURRY WITH GREEN BEAN ADDITIVE PRODUCED 89mL OF BIOGAS TOTAL FOR AN AVERAGE 17.8mL OF BIOGAS PER DIGESTER. THE SLURRY WITH BANANAS PRODUCED A TOTAL OF 206mL OF BIOGAS FOR AN AVERAGE OF 41.2mL OF BIOGAS PER DIGESTER. THE SLURRY WITH VEGETABLE SCRAPS PRODUCED A TOTAL OF 48mL OF BIOGAS FOR AN AVERAGE OF 9.6mL OF BIOGAS PER DIGESTER. THE CONTROL PRODUCED A TOTAL OF 134mL OF BIOGAS FOR AN AVERAGE OF 26.8mL OF BIOGAS PER DIGESTER. BASED ON MY DATA I CONCLUDED THAT MY HYPOTHESIS, OF IF YOU ADD BANANAS TOA BIOGAS DIGESTER THEN THE DIGESTER’S BIOGAS OUTPUT WILL INCREASE, HAD BEEN SUPPORTED. MY RESEARCH WOULD BE APPLICABLE TO ANY DIGESTER OWNER WHO WISHED TO INCREASE ENERGY PRODUCTION FOR THEIR HOME OR OFFICE. PERHAPS A SLURRY ADDITIVE COULD BE MANUFACTURED TO HELP WITH THIS PROCESS.

DOES THE RESIN CONTENT IN PINE FEEDSTOCK AFFECT ENERGY OUTPUT? YEAR THREE
Holly Linn Tucker
Union County High School, Lake Butler, FL

This experiment was to determine if the resin content in biomass feedstock would have a positive effect on energy output. Three samples were selected which include North Florida slash, High Gum slash, and Lighter wood. These three samples were chosen first, because slash pine is commercially significant to the South East. Second, Lighter wood would be an extreme comparison because this wood is known for its high resin. Third, the High Gum slash was thought it would fall between the previous two samples because it was developed in the late 1970’s for its increased resin content; developed for the naval industry. After my initial testing, comparing, the data I found that there was a significant difference between Lighter wood when compared to the other two feedstock. I can also determine that there was no significant difference between north Florida slash and High Gum Yield slash. Post extraction I found that there was no significant difference between all three feedstock. When individually tested to their own pre and post extraction outputs the Lighter wood and High Gum yield slash had a very low t-test which indicates a significant drop in energy output , while north Florida slash had a slight drop in energy output but was not a significant difference. My results show that my hypothesis was correct because at least one of the feedstock’s energy output is significantly different than the others. Then, two of the three feedstock showed a significant drop after resin extraction.

THE EFFECTS OF SYNSEPALUM DULCIFICUM ON THE TASTE OF FOODS AT DIFFERENT PH LEVELS
Hope Louise Didier
McIntosh High School, Peachtree City, GA

This experiment was designed to test the effects of Synsepalum dulcificum on the taste of foods at different pH levels. Seven foods of various pH levels were tested with and without a Synsepalum dulcificum tablet to determine if Synsepalum dulcificum would cause foods with a lower pH to be more greatly enhanced than foods with a higher pH level. Each food sample was administered prior to the subject's consumption of Synsepalum dulcificum. After each subject tasted and rated each food, each subject dissolved a Synsepalum dulcificum tablet on their tongue and repeated the procedure. Quantitative measurements were made, with and without Synsepalum dulcificum, using a Hedonic tasting scale ranging from a one, at like extremely, to a nine, at dislikes extremely. Data was recorded for twenty-five test subjects. A comparison was made between the taste of foods with and without Synsepalum dulcificum and conclusions were made. After the use of Synsepalum dulcificum the taste of foods with a lower pH level appeared to be more greatly enhanced than foods with a higher pH level. Research should be continued on the effects of Synsepalum dulcificum as a potential aid to patients undergoing chemotherapy. Synsepalum dulcificum could prevent the loss of appetite during critical treatment of their illness.

DESIGNING ORGANIC BLOCKERS WHICH MITIGATE PROTEIN LIGAND BINDING BETWEEN HIV-1 AND CD4+T CELLS
Frank Michael Selb
Astronaut High School, Titusville Florida, USA

The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) is the virus that leads to AIDS, and belongs to a subset of retroviruses called lentiviruses. Upon entering the bloodstream through mucous membranes or blood-to-blood contact, HIV infects the CD4+T cells and begins to replicate rapidly. “Blocker” molecules are able to inhibit the docking processes of HIV, but success has been limited.<br><br> This research used the new approach of advanced molecular modeling programs, which are used in pharmaceutical companies worldwide. AutoDock, was used for all of the docking sequences between the blocker molecules and known protein structures, all obtained from the RSCB© Protein Data Bank. All molecule modifications and measurements were done using the Swiss-PDB viewer. Three known blocker molecules were tested in 500 docking simulations, then modified according to four basic principles so they could be more successful: torsion, stretch, bend, and nonbonded interaction. The modified versions were then retested in the docking program.<br><br>  level of .05, as well as the root-mean-square deviation. The XK-263 blocker molecule increased from 36.6% efficiency to 62.6% efficiency; T20 molecule decreased from 53.4% efficiency to 46.7% efficiency; and the R5 blocker molecule efficiency rate was increased from 18.4% to 69.7%. In conclusion, it is obvious that a blocker molecule can inhibit the docking of HIV, however, the success rates of these blocker molecules is not yet perfect.All results are formulated using known thermodynamical data from the actual docking stages of HIV-1 to T4 cells as a specified critical value at an <br><br>

BIOINFORMATIC AND SYNTHETIC APPROACHES TO STUDYING ADVANCED GLYCATION END-PRODUCTS IN EUKARYOTES
Jason A. Gandelman
Staples High School, Westport, CT

Advanced Glycation End-product (AGE) accumulation has been strongly implicated in the pathology of diabetic complications of the vasculature and kidneys through the activation of the Receptor for AGEs (RAGE). Thus a better understanding of AGE formation and RAGE activation in eukaryotes is highly desirable in the creation of novel treatments for diabetic complications. First, I provide evidence, using comprehensive bioinformatic screening analyses, that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae an evolutionary adaptation decreases the susceptibility of its enzymes to AGE formation. From a total of 5883 metabolic enzymes in S. cerevisiae, I identified 185 enzymes that catalyze reactions involving metabolic intermediates which contain reactive carbonyl groups. These enzymes are considered the most susceptible to AGE formation due to an enhanced probability of nucleophilic substitution by the reactive carbonyls with nucleophilic amino acids in these enzymes. I subsequently found that these enzymes were significantly under-represented in nucleophilic amino acids compared to the proteome-wide average, providing the first scientific evidence that an evolutionary adaptation can lead to a biochemical mechanism to combat the formation of toxic AGEs. Second, I synthesized biologically important AGE-peptide fragments of glycated human serum albumin. These AGE-peptides are being tested for binding efficiency to RAGE using a unique enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. These binding assays may identify an AGE-peptide sequence that binds specifically with high affinity thereby competitively blocking RAGE activation. Thus, this study provides possible novel directions in the development of therapeutics to confer vasculo- and renoprotective effects in diabetic patients.

RED TIDE MITIGATION: NEUTRALIZING BREVETOXIN USING THE AMINO ACID DERIVATIVE, CYSTEINE METHYL ESTER
Collin Northcott McAliley
Cocoa Beach Jr/Sr High School, Cocoa Beach, FL

Red tides occur worldwide and produce toxins that result in human health problems, devastating consequences to marine life, and significant economic losses. Karenia brevis, the algae causing Florida red tides, produces a powerful neurotoxin called brevetoxin. This project evaluated a chemical method of neutralizing Karenia brevis toxins. The amino acid derivative, cysteine methyl ester (CME), has shown promising potential as a neutralizer for brevetoxins. This project investigated how long a single CME treatment would effectively neutralize brevetoxins, in vitro, at typical Gulf of Mexico summer and winter temperatures, 29°C and 18°C respectively. The experimental period was 44 days, allowing time for sufficient test replications and determination of the effectiveness of CME during a typical Karenia brevis bloom. Artificial seawater (ASW) was treated with CME, and stored in incubators for use throughout the experiment (Original CME/ASW). Each Sunday and Friday, Original CME/ASW was combined with Karenia brevis and incubated for two hours. The resulting toxins and derivatives were extracted using Solid Phase Extraction. As a control, each Sunday, Fresh CME/ASW solutions were prepared, processed, and stored as above. The collected samples were shipped to a research lab where toxin concentrations were measured using High Performance Liquid Chromatography – Mass Spectrometry. Results showed CME to be very effective in neutralizing brevetoxins at both summer and winter temperatures. A single treatment remained 100% effective for thirty-seven days and partially effective for at least seven additional days. Temperature was not found to have a statistically significant influence on how long a treatment was effective (P=0.0978).

EVALUATION OF CALCIUM CHANNELS IN INVERTEBRATES
Elizabeth Ivory Caudle
Eastside High School, Gainesville, Florida, United States

Voltage-gated calcium channels are ubiquitous in living organisms. However, very few calcium channels have been cloned from invertebrates. The purpose of this research was to identify and sequence voltage-gated calcium channels in a variety of invertebrates. Primers from Caenorhabditis elegans were used to try to identify the calcium channels from three species of Cnidaria, Aiptasia, Bdelloura, and Cyanea. Cloned DNA libraries were used from these three species. A polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the DNA signal. The DNA was separated by agarose electrophoresis. The primers did not anneal to the calcium channels in Aiptasia, Bdelloura, and Cyanea. In addition, the same primers were used to attempt to identify calcium channels in Paramecium multimicronucleatum. The primers did not anneal to the calcium channels in Paramecium multimicronucleatum. However, in a mammalian fibroblast cell line, the primers successfully annealed to the voltage gated calcium channels. This shows that the calcium channels found in the highly conserved region from C. elegans are significantly different from those found in the invertebrates tested. Therefore, the calcium channels in C. elegans are more closely related to those of mammals than these four invertebrates.

REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES ACCUMULATION DURING EMBRYOGENESIS SIGNIFICANTLY MODULATES PLANT FERTILITY: ROLE OF ROS SCAVENGER GENES IN ENHANCING CROP YIELD
Yahya Maqsood Mohammed
Niceville Senior High School, Niceville, FL, USA

Environmental stress (e.g. high salinity) inhibits key enzymatic functions and impacts crop yield significantly. High ion concentrations due to stress disrupt cellular homeostasis and cause oxidative damage. To overcome this, plants have evolved multiple mechanisms, such as decreasing fertility, which shunts resources from reproductive activities to metabolic reactions that increase stress tolerance. When ovules abort in response to salinity, high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is noticed. <br><br> Arabidopsis thaliana is used as a model plant because of its short life cycle and the ease to grow it in the laboratory. Many of the findings about how plants work are learned from studies with Arabidopsis thaliana. In this study the role of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Scavengers in neutralizing the ROS molecules is investigated. I hypothesized that if ROS scavenging genes that are expressed in developing ovules are mutated, these mutants will accumulate ROS, which will lead to high ovule abortion rates. Through the comparison of wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana plants with those with mutations in ROS scavenging genes, it can be determined whether ROS is the mechanism by which the plant gets rid of ovules. First, the genotypes of plants with T-DNA inserts was performed using PCR and agarose gels to determine which T-DNA inserts were actually successful, thus creating a mutation. The mutations have been identified and new plants were grown from the seeds with mutations and the wild-types. The number of ovules and amount of ROS were determined in both mutated plants and wild-type. <br><br> It is concluded that: ROS significantly modulates plant fertility during stress; depending on the type of ROS they neutralize, ROS Scavenger genes play either protective or detrimental roles in embryogenesis; and the findings of this investigation are very significant and have a direct application in enhancing crop yield.

PRION AND LIPID MEMBRANE INTERACTIONS: THE ROLE OF DILAUROYLPHOSPHATIDYLETHANOLAMINE IN FATAL PRION DISEASE PROPAGATION
Marie Nielsen
Pacific Collegiate School, Santa Cruz, CA

Fatal prion diseases have no cure, with malicious prions eventually spreading throughout the brain. How prion proteins (PrP) propagate themselves is largely unknown. Lipids have been linked with misfolding of the malicious PrP. This project provides specific evidence that energy changes occurring in the PrP-lipid interactions are involved in infectious prion misfolding. Specifically, the biomolecular dynamic simulation analysis done shows significant changes in inter-atomic energies in PrP in a lipid environment. PrP interactions with lipid versus water were simulated using NAMD, VMD, Charmm. Results found that electrostatic energies of PrP immersed in a Dilauroylphosphatidylethanolamine (lipid) box differed widely from PrP in a water box. These energy differences only occur in nonbonded energies. A lipid membrane environment leaves openings for misfolding and the PrP moves differently in the lipid solution rather than a water one. Using molecular modeling and dynamic simulations, the specific energies in the region of the misfolding were investigated with Chimera. Visual changes were observed in the Octarepeat Domain (OD). There was also extra twisting directly adjacent to the E200K region which codes for the hereditary susceptibility of prion diseases and is the region where misfolding occurs. It is likely that the polar nature of water reduces PrP’s internal electrostatic energy. It is conclusively shown that PrP interaction with a lipid membrane induces stresses within the protein and affects the region of misfolding. With this knowledge of PrP-lipid interactions, additional information can be extracted to better identify the nature of the linkage.

GLYCOSYLATION OF THE BETA 4 ADRENAL NICOTINIC RECEPTOR SUBUNIT
Jacob Liu
Upper Arlington High School, Upper Arlington, Ohio, United States of America

The presence of two different sized BETA 4 nicotine receptor subunits was examined in bovine adrenal medulla cells. There are many different nicotine receptor subunits that combine to form the quaternary structure of nicotine receptors. Last year’s results from studying the BETA 4 subunit suggested the presence of two different sizes of the protein, most likely resulting from the glycosylation of BETA 4 protein post-translationally. To determine if the hypothesis was correct, bovine adrenal medulla proteins were deglycosylated and run on a10% SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with negative and positive controls. The sorted proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and blocked in 10% dried non-fat milk solution. The membrane was then probed with BETA 4 specific antibodies. A secondary antibody was added to indicate the presence of the primary antibody. The membrane was then incubated in luminescent compounds and imaged for indications of BETA 4 deglycosylation. The procedure was repeated for accuracy, using different cell preparations. After results were obtained, the migration distances of the unknown protein bands were compared with those of the protein weight markers. Using logarithmic regression, a computer program extrapolated the molecular weight of the bands identified by the antibody probes. Treated samples of adrenal protein lost the 54 and 52 kilodalton protein bands identified as the BETA 4 subunit, while a 42 kilodalton bands increased in luminescence and width. This suggests that there are actually two differently glycosylated BETA 4 subunits used by the body for some unknown reason.<br><br><br>

INVESTIGATING THE INHIBITORY EFFECT OF RESVERATROL ON OVARIAN CANCER CELLS
Jimmy Lin
Robert Louis Stevenson Upper School, Pebble Beach, CA

French paradox states that the French have a longer average lifespan than the Americans, despite their higher caloric intake. This is mostly credited to resveratrol, a compound found in red wine. Resveratrol has been shown to inhibit tumor progression by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Previous studies disclose that resveratrol may activate sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) activity. This NAD-dependent deacetylase is important for many cellular processes such as gene silencing and cell cycle regulation. This study aims to verify whether SIRT1 expression is involved in the resveratrol inhibitory effect of human ovarian cancer progression. The experiment design integrates the use of cell count test, MTT assay and flow cytometry, and all the results therefrom are cross-referenced, which is original in this field. Normal and abnormal cells were treated with different dosage combinations of resveratrol and sirtinol, a SIRT1 inhibitor. Decreased cell counts, optical density and flow cytometry scatters plots identically indicated a dosage-dependent inhibition of cell growth by resveratrol. The inhibitory effect on cell growth increased with increasing concentrations of resveratrol. Furthermore, sirtinol decreased this inhibitory effect, implying that SIRT1 plays a critical role in cell cycle regulation. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that resveratrol inhibits the growth of ovarian cancer cells and SIRT1 expression influences the inhibition process by resveratrol. In conclusion, resveratrol may help to activate apoptosis in cancer cells, and its inhibitory effect on cancer cell growth can be applied in the development of anticancer therapies.

2-DEOXY-GLUCOSE INDUCES CELL DEATH OF HUMAN LEUKEMIC LYMPHOID CELLS
Gloria Maria Torres-Ayala
Academia Maria Reina, San Juan

Most cancer cells obtain their energy from glycolysis and fermentation instead of using mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect. The goal of this work was to determine if the Warburg effect may be a target for the development of anticancer drugs. For this purpose we tested the hypothesis that exposing acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells to 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), an inhibitor of glycolysis, will result in cell death. Human lymphoblastic leukemia CEMC7 cells were exposed to increasing 2-DG concentrations and cell concentration and cell viability were determined 24 and 48 hours after treatment using the trypan blue exclusion method. Cells treated with 5, 15, and 25 nM 2-DG for 24 hours resulted in a 48, 57 and 66% decrease in cell density, respectively and in a 43, 58 and 69% decrease in cell viability, respectively. Cells were dead after 48 hours of 2-DG treatment. The results of these experiments show that 2-DG treatment causes a dose-dependent decrease in both cell density and cell viability. We conclude that inhibiting glycolysis may be an effective chemotherapeutic approach to kill lymphoblastic leukemia cells.

ELECTROSTATIC POTENTIAL CALCULATIONS AND PKA PREDICTIONS OF THE BINDING DOMAIN OF EBNA-1
Emily Marie DuBois
LC Anderson High School, Austin, TX

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a commonly transmitted virus of the herpes virus family that causes acute infectious mononucleosis, Burkitt’s lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, among other malignancies. The Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) protein is responsible for viral DNA-binding and the regulation of DNA replication post-dormancy. The inhibition of DNA-binding by residues 459-607 of EBNA1 may be an approach to the treatment of EBV-linked diseases. A Brownian Dynamics software package was used to calculate pKa shifts of ionizable residues. By examining the electrostatic potential and irregular pKa values of ionizable amino acids of EBNA1, information regarding potential activation sites, DNA-docking regions and targets for drug inhibition was attained. These results will aid in further research on the mechanisms of the Epstein-Barr virus DNA binding and replication processes.

TOWARDS THE PAINLESS PAINKILLER: DESIGN AND SYNTHESIS OF NOVEL FATTY ACID BINDING PROTEIN INHIBITORS FOR ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AND ANALGESIC EFFECTS
Raghav Tripathi
Westview High School, Portland, OR

Over 1.5 billion people suffer from chronic pain, a detriment to worker productivity, quality of life, etc. Furthermore, excess acute pain/inflammation afflicts billions worldwide. However, current analgesics have numerous unintended adverse effects, removing many such agents from the pharmaceutical market entirely. This research discovered, assayed, and optimized a novel class of anti-inflammatory medication without the negative side-effects associated with contemporary painkillers. Recently, preclinical studies have indicated that elevated levels of the endogenous compound anandamide (AEA) result in beneficial effects on pain, stress, and inflammation, and ameliorate drug withdrawal without adverse side-effects. Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) have been identified as intracellular AEA transporters that chaperone AEA to degradation. As such, FABPs are targets for small-molecule inhibition to increase endogenous AEA levels. This research developed innovative compounds for FABP inhibition. First, 1,057,042 molecules were virtually screened for binding affinity to FABP using a computational analysis program (DOCK). Then, 48 compounds with the greatest modeled efficacy were screened with a fluorescence displacement assay. The compound with the greatest FABP inhibition (truxillic acid) underwent a liquid scintillation assay to simulate AEA cellular uptake. Results indicate that truxillic acid significantly inhibits AEA uptake. For drug optimization, functional modification libraries were synthesized and DOCKed. Taken together, results strongly support the potential of these novel small-molecules with significant efficacy in inhibiting FABP and increasing AEA concentrations. This discovery may contribute to the next generation of innovative analgesic medication.

A NOVEL APPROACH FOR DETECTING THE INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF FLAVONOIDS
Pranali Hemant Dalvi
International Baccalaureate at Bartow High School, Bartow, FL

Candidiasis is a condition that results from uncontrolled multiplication of Candida yeasts, Candida albicans being the most common. Candida yeasts are found in most persons, and their growth is controlled by microorganisms and the immune system. Systematic fungal infections in immunocompromised persons (cancer, transplant, AIDS patients) can result in mortality. Superficial infections of skin/mucosal membranes by Candida causing inflammation and discomfort are frequent among humans. The ability of Candida to form a biofilm makes it a potential bioterrorism tool: it causes infections and is sometimes impenetrable by antifungal drugs. The main purpose of this research was to engineer a method of penetrating the biofilms of Candida yeasts with extracts and, therefore, find a cure for Candidiasis. The eight fungal pathogens used were Candida glabrata, Candida utilis, Prototheca wickerhamii, Trichosporon mucoides , Candida lusitaniae, Geotrichum capitatum, Kloeckera apis, and Candida albicans. The extracts tested were Ajowan Extract, Ginger Extract, Carrot seed Extract, Turmeric Extract, Basil Extract, Cumin Extract, Clove Extract, and Wheatgrass Extract. This is the first published study to synthesize ethyl acetate, butanol, and water extracts of wheatgrass. After treating the fungi with the herbal extracts, data was quantified for the comparison of the antifungal properties of each herbal supplement. Serial dilutions were performed to identify the most effective dosage of Ajowan Extract for application as a potential antifungal drug. By testing the anticarcinogenic properties of these extracts, patients suffering from Candidiasis can be completely rehabilitated.

ANIMAL ATTRACTION: TO WHAT EXTENT DO DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS PREDICT A FEMALE HUMAN'S ABILITY TO DETECT MALE HUMAN PHEROMONES
Kyrie K Bourgeois 
Luther High School, Lutcher, Louisiana, USA

After extensive research it is proposed that humans can detect pheromones. This will be tested 3 ways: can a female subject detect pheromones on a shirt among shirts with no pheromones, can a female detect pheromones of her significant other from among shirts of other males and can a female detect male pheromones from amongst female pheromones. For all three tests, a set of new t-shirts will be washed in fragrance free detergent. Each shirt will be placed in a ziplock bag and remained sealed until testing. Several of these shirts will be kept aside as controls for the tests. The remaining shirts will be issued to the male counterparts of the females to be tested. These males will be asked to shower with fragrance free soap, used no deoderant, put the shirt on and go immediately to sleep. Upon arising the male will put the shirt back into the ziplock bag. The procedure will be followed the next night as well. Female subjects will return the shirts in the bags and fill out a simple survey for demographic information. When all shirts have been collected, shirts will be coded so that no identifying marks can be associated. Females will be individually tested in the following ways: (1) First, the familiar male shirt will be placed amongst 2 placebos. The female will be asked to pick out the one worn by her man. (2) Next, the familiar male shirt will be placed amongst 1 strange female and 1 placebo shirt. The female will be asked to pick out the one worn by her man. (3) Finally, the familiar male shirt will be place amongst 2 strange male shirts. Once each of these tests is completed with all females, the results will be analyzed to determine if females can detect pheromones and if age, years together or other factors affect this detection.

CATALASE: CAN YOU TAKE THE HEAT?
Geralyn Anne Schexnayder
Luther High School, Lutcher, LA 70090 USA

Catalase is a protein molecule found in living cells. This enzyme is responsible for the ripening of fruits and vegetables. Catalase begins its enzymatic action as soon as fruits and vegetables are picked, causing undesirable changes such as the development of off flavors and over-ripening. The main objective of this project was to determine at what temperature catalase becomes inactive in various root vegetables. This will aid consumers in deciding the cooking method to be used on different vegetables. <br><br>Catalase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. Catalase inactivity temperatures were determined by heating a mixture of root vegetable and water to specific temperature on a hot plate, cooling the mixture to room temperature and testing for enzymatic decomposition of household (3%) hydrogen peroxide by timing the ascent of a paper disk in the solution caused by the oxygen bubbles rising out of solution.<br><br>It was found that catalase is inactivated at different temperatures in different root vegetables ranging from 50-95°C. From this data on can determine the appropriate cooking method to obtain the best color, flavor and nutritional value of the vegetables. <br><br>

COARSE-GRAINED MOLECULAR DYNAMICS (MD) SIMULATION OF PROTEIN AGGREGATION: AN INSIGHT INTO PROTEIN AGGREGATION PROPERTIES IN ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE
Prachiti Hemant Dalvi
International Baccalaureate School at Bartow High School, Bartow, FL

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss, disorientation, and overall mental incapacitation. A fundamental development in AD is the formation of amyloid-beta plaques. Further analysis of protein aggregation properties will thus serve as the initial step in eliminating these plaques. Coarse-graining methods were employed to model interactions between four different peptide bead lengths (4, 8, 12, and 16) simulated at 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% hydrophobicity. These interactions were monitored for a time span of 1.0 µs. The MARTINI force field in the Groningen Machine for Chemical Simulations was utilized to generate graphs that illustrated the clustering tendencies of these peptide chains at their respective hydrophobicities. At a hydrophobicity fraction of 0.5, a phase plot diagram illustrated that a peptide-bead length greater than 12 yielded clusters comprised of all 336 peptide beads. Chain lengths greater than 12 peptide beads exhibit clustering regardless of hydrophobicity. At 50 percent hydrophobicity, the peptide chain that was 12 beads long did not remain stable in a single cluster but instead divided into two smaller clusters near 0.9 µs. The 16-bead peptide, unlike the 12-bead peptide, was more stable, forming a single cluster at approximately 0.5 µs. The peptide clustering parallels the aggregation of amyloid-beta plaques in Alzheimer’s patients. A closer evaluation of the 12-bead peptide chain at 50% hydrophobicity can reveal unknown characteristics of protein aggregation. In essence, a drug discovery program can be initiated following this study to dissolve amyloid-beta aggregations and ultimately alleviate the symptoms of AD.

STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF HUMAN BOCAVIRUS (HBOV)
Sarah-Marie Hopf
Canterbury School, Fort Myers, FL

The ssDNA parvovirus HBoV causes lower respiratory tract infection in infants and children. HBoV causes about 7-9 % of lower respiratory tract infection which is a leading cause for hospitalization of young children and accounts for approximately 250,000 hospitalizations a year. The high-resolution structural analysis of HBoV is important for understanding its infectious pathway. This study aimed at identifying the cell surface receptor used by HBoV for host cell infection. Empty, noninfectious capsids were purified using a sucrose cushion and gradient protocol. Optical density readings were taken, a Comassie blue SDS-Page was run, and images of purified virus particles were taken using negative-stain electron microscopy. All this was performed to ensure the presence of intact virus proteins and capsids. A dot blotting procedure was used to check reactivity against a capsid antibody in preparation for glycan microarrays that would identify potential cell surface receptor molecules used by HBoV for attachment during host cell infection. In addition, crystal trays were set up for obtaining a high-resolution 3D crystal structure of HBoV. Crystals of HBoV were successfully obtained from the trays. The structural insights of HBoV and the identification of cell surface carbohydrates can lead to an understanding of how to interrupt or stop the infectious pathway of HBoV. In the future, this could create possibilities for vaccine development by targeting the carbohydrate sites on the host cell receptors and blocking them. This could stop the majority of lower respiratory tract infections that HBoV causes.

Adeno-Associated Viruses (AAVs) are small ssDNA viruses. Many of the <br><br>serotypes have been discovered to have gene transfer applications. By determining the structure of AAV 9 using X-ray crystallography or reconstructing it from cryo-electron microscopy micrographs, the functional properties of the virus capsid can be better understood. <br><br> The researcher received AAV capsids in sf9 insect cells. From there the cells were lysed by freezing and thawing them three times, this allowed for the retrieval of the virus particles. The virus was then purified, using a sucrose cushion and gradient. The virus was pulled from the 20-25% range in the gradient. Next the virus was analyzed for purity and integrity using a SDS-PAGE gel and negative stain Electron Microscopy, following dialysis respectively. All three viral proteins were found and there was no sign of aggregation. The virus was then split and concentrated to two concentrations, the first to 2mg/mL, and the second to 10mg/mL. The first sample was taken to a Cryo-Electron Microscopy. There were approximately 700 images gathered from the Cryo. These images were sorted according to orientation, and then averaged. From these images a 3-D image was reconstructed at 25ð. The other sample of AAV9 was used for crystallization procedures. The virus was tested under a variety of conditions, and it was determined that the condition, 50mM Tris, 5.0% PEG 8K, and 150mM NaCl, produced the best crystal, but it was still not large enough to diffract. <br><br> Other studies include the production of a sequence alignment of AAVs 1-11, a pairwise comparison of the first 11 AAVs, which delivered that AAV was most similar to AA10, and most different to AAV5. Also a monomer was constructed using PyMOL, it will be used in conjunction with the results of x-ray diffraction data to gain a high resolution structure.

LOOP MODIFICATIONS ON CRY1AA TOXIN AND EFFECTS ON TOXICITY TOWARD MOSQUITOES
Bin Ni
Upper Arlington High School, Upper Arlington, Ohio

The insecticidal ability of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is due to the crystalline parasporal protein inclusions found in the bacteria. Once ingested by the target pest, the Bt protein is solubilized in the alkaline midgut juice and digested to produce an active toxin. The active toxin binds to receptors on the membrane of midgut epithelial cells of insect larvae. It then inserts into the cell membrane to form ion channels, disrupting the normal pH level of the cell and causing the death of the insect. Different proteins are lethal to differnt types of insect larvae. The Cry1Aa protein is lethal against lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) while the Cry4Ba protein is lethal toward diptera (mosquito). Previous studies suggest that toxicity of Cry proteins is directly related to the receptor binding abilities of the protein. It is suspected that the loops in Domain II of the proteins play an essential role in receptor binding. A greater understanding of the role Domain II loops play in the receptor binding abilities of Cry proteins is sought. In this experiment, two mutations were made to the loops of the wild type Cry1Aa protein using the Kunkel method. In the first mutation, loop 1 of the Cry1Aa was replaced with loop 1 of the Cry4Ba protein. In the second mutation, loop 2 of the Cry1Aa was deleted in addition to the loop 1 substitution. Serial concentrations of the mutant proteins were fed to Aedes aegypti and Anopheles quadrimaculatus. Both mutants, like the wild type protein, were not toxic to either specie of mosquito (0% death rate).

CONTROLLING THE ENCAPSULATION OF LIGASE RIBOZYME IN BILAYER PHOSPHOLIPID VESICLES THROUGH DEHYDRATION/REHYDRATION
Sergio-Francis Mellejor Zenisek
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland, OR, USA

Compartmentalization of chemical reactions is considered a requirement for life, and has been theorized as playing a role in the origin of biological compounds from abiotic processes. The goal of this series of experiments was the encapsulation of a ligase reaction within liposomes made from phosphatidylcholine, a phospholipid whose abiotic formation has been demonstrated. Vesicles were produced by sonication and encapsulation was performed through the dehydration-rehydration method pioneered by David W. Deamer. Various combinations of both unreacted and reacted RNA and substrate were run, after encapsulation and separation from unencapsulated solute, with agarose and polyacrylamide gels. These were then imaged with short-wavelength UV, in the former case, and fluorescence imagery, with the latter. In all cases, except one trial, these images supported the conclusion that the solutes were encapsulated and could be reacted from outside the vesicle. Results from an experiment addressing this inconsistency supported the conclusion that a degree of encapsulation did occur, and again that the ligase reaction was successfully triggered from outside the vesicles. Possible sources of error include gel cross-contamination and the binding of solute to the exterior of vesicles.

A NOVEL MECHANISM LEADING TO GENOME INSTABILITY AND CANCER DEVELOPMENT
Jessie Y. Li
Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Lexington, KY

The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is an essential component for DNA replication and repair, including DNA mismatch repair (MMR), an important genome-maintenance system that ensures replication fidelity by correcting base mispairs created during DNA replication. PCNA is required for MMR at both the initiation and re-synthesis steps. Recent studies have shown that PCNA is phosphorylated at tyrosine 211 (Y211) by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) during tumor progression. We therefore hypothesize that Y211-phosphorylated PCNA promotes tumor progression by inducing elevated mutations in critical tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes by altering its function in MMR and DNA replication. To test this hypothesis, we directly determined the influence of Y211-phosphorylated PCNA on MMR activity and DNA synthesis accuracy. We demonstrate here that nuclear extracts derived from tumor cells with Y211-phosphorylated PCNA are defective in MMR, and that the deficiency can be restored by purified non-phosphorylated PCNA, suggesting that PCNA phosphorylation inhibits MMR. We also show that Y211-phosphorylated PCNA induces misincorporations during DNA synthesis. This study therefore demonstrates that a novel mechanism, i.e., MMR protein modifications, promotes genome instability and tumor progression by negatively regulating MMR function and DNA synthesis. Thus, the work solves a long-time puzzle that certain cancers displaying the classical MMR-deficient phenotype do not have a detectable mutation in MMR genes, and identifies PCNA Y211 phosphorylation as a novel biomarker for cancer etiology and development.

THE EVALUATION OF SMALL MOLECULE INHIBITORS OF PKM2, A DOWNSTREAM PRODUCT OF MTOR, IN NEUROBLASTOMA
Christina Diane Collins
Caddo Parish Magnet High School, Shreveport, LA

Neuroblastoma, an orphan disease, is the most common extracranial solid tumor in childhood with only a 3-5 year survival rate, and 75% diagnosed as highly metastatic. All cancers exhibit key oncogenic features that could prove as targets for therapeutic benefit. One of these features is the use of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), the product of an mTOR pathway. Although mTOR inhibitors have been under research, many are found to cause adverse effects, but the inhibition of a product of mTOR might prove a safer target. PKM2 has the unique ability to change form according to the presence or absence of hydrogen bonded fructose-1,6-biphosphate (FBP) at an allosteric site. PKM2 forms a tetramer with hydrogen bonded FBP causing a domain closure but is only a dimer without FBP. <br><br>This study further tests two PKM2 inhibitors from previous literature for the possibility of inhibiting PKM2 in vitro. The most effective molecule was found to inhibit at least 90% of PKM2 activity. The results and the analysis of inhibitory molecules suggest the molecules hydrogen bond in place of FBP. This does not allow for complete domain closure obtained with FBP and thus inhibits tetramerization of PKM2, inhibits the cell’s ability of rapid metabolism, and induces cell death. These results show the possibility of innovative ways in treating cancer by exploiting its key oncogenic features and explore possible cost effective treatments for orphan disease cancers. This research also discusses the possibility of using a perfected PKM2 inhibitor as a chemo-preventative.<br><br>

THE AUTOCATALYTIC ASSEMBLY OF AZOARCUS RIBOZYME AND THE RECOMBINATION OF RNA IN A COMPARTMENTALIZED SYSTEM: AN ORIGIN-OF-LIFE STUDY
Sergio-Francis Mellejor Zenisek
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland, OR, USA

RNA has both the ability to store genetic information and to behave as a ribozyme, catalyzing chemical reactions. Because of this, it has been hypothesized that an ‘RNA world’ of active RNA molecules preceded the DNA and protein-based genetics present in all known living things. The recombination of RNA molecules, for instance, has the potential to increase genetic complexity and diversity in such a scenario. Previously, ribozyme-driven recombination has been demonstrated in solution chemistry; however, membranes are a ubiquitous feature of life and facilitate evolution through natural selection, so compartmentalization must play a role in some stage of life’s origins. The purpose of this research was to demonstrate the auto-catalytic assembly of the Azoarcus ribozyme through a process known as autorecombination, in a water-in-oil emulsion, to model the compatibility of ‘RNA world’-type chemistry with compartmentalized chemistry. Combinations of RNAs were encapsulated in emulsion through vortexing in a heavy oil phase containing surfactant molecules. These RNAs were reacted and then analyzed on polyacrylamide gels. Results indicated the successful autorecombination of two substrates in a compartmentalized system. In addition, results during the course of experimentation suggested the spontaneous mixing of vesicle contents occurred, and additional experiments demonstrated autorecombination when reagents were emulsified separately and then joined. Other experiments demonstrated the recombination of substrates by Azoarcus ribozyme in emulsion, both with and without the content exchange mechanism, using a fluorescently-tagged secondary substrate. Possible sources of error considered include the presence of a non-compartmentalized aqueous layer in the emulsion.

THIOLATED GELATIN NANOPARTICLES: A NOVEL APPROACH FOR INTRACELLULAR DELIVERY IN GENE THERAPY AND DRUG DELIVERY
Joline Marie Fan
Upper Arlington High School, Upper Arlington, OH, USA

In this study, thiolated gelatin nanoparticles were prepared and tested against unmodified gelatin nanoparticles for robustness and precision as vectors for drug delivery and gene therapy applications. The thiolated gelatin nanoparticles have a positive surface charge, which assists in targeting cells with slightly negatively charged cell membranes. Trafficking of nanoparticles in NIH 3T3 cells was studied using a fluorescent dye as the payload. The thiolated nanoparticles were observed to release the dye instantly upon entering the cell due to the reduction of their disulfide bonds by the naturally occurring glutathione antioxidant, thereby yielding a uniform distribution of dye throughout the cell. The gelatin nanoparticles, on the other hand, remained intact and slowly released their payload through degradation. Similar results were observed with a plasmid DNA payload, as measured by green fluorescent protein expression in the cell. These results show that thiolated gelatin nanoparticles are more effective than gelatin nanoparticles for intracellular delivery of drugs and DNA.

ICAM-1 CYTOPLASMIC TAIL REGULATION OF ENDOTHELIAL CELL ACTIVATION IN TYPE I DIABETES
Shiqi Joy Shan
Caddo Parish Magnet High School, Shreveport, LA

Type I Diabetes is an autoimmune disease characterized by insulitis, an invasion of the pancreatic islet by leukocytes. These leukocytes attack and destroy insulin-producing beta cells. Leukocyte recruitment is mediated by adhesion molecules on the activated endothelial cell surface. As in many other chronic inflammatory illnesses, T1D is characterized by increased levels of oxidative stress, culminating in a positive feedback loop leading to enhanced leukocyte recruitment mechanisms and magnified oxidative stress. Thus, detoxifying reactive oxygen species would decrease oxidative stress and reduce the influx of immune cells into the pancreatic islets, mitigating insulitis. I hypothesized that AP-ICAM, a peptide mimicking the cytoplasmic domain of ICAM-1 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1) that has been shown to increase intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels, regulates endothelial cell activation in a GSH-dependent manner. In this investigation, firm adhesion and rolling interactions between monocytes and pancreatic islet endothelial cells were measured using an in vitro parallel plate flow chamber. Fluorescently labeled monocytes were perfused across a confluent layer of endothelial cells, and the interactions were recorded with an inverted camera and microscope. Videos of treatment groups were watched and analyzed in real time with a motion tracking software. The AP-ICAM peptide inhibited firm adhesion between the monocytes and stimulated endothelium. When AP-ICAM treated cells were also treated with BSO, which stops GSH production, the inhibition of inflammation was reversed. However, rolling velocities of the monocytes were not affected by AP-ICAM and/or BSO treatment. These data suggest a novel regulatory pathway that could be used in treatment of T1D.

UNDERSTANDING THE PHYSIOLOGICAL PATHWAY OF HOMOCYSTEINE
Rafi Ridwan Kazi
Little Rock Central High School, Little Rock, Arkansas, United States

Elevated levels of plasma homocysteine (Hcy) have been implicated as an independent risk factor for coronary, cerebral, and peripheral arterial occlusive diseases and accelerated atherosclerosis as well as peripheral venous thrombosis. In addition, elevated levels of plasma Hcy is attributed to recurrent restenosis and blockage of the lumen following vascular surgical procedures. This study was designed to better understand the pathophysiological pathway homocysteine utilizes in order to initiate vascular disease. The hypothesis was that elevated Hcy initiates peripheral arterial disease by crossing the endothelium cell membranes and is then metabolized in the cytosol by cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS), a hepatic Hcy metabolizing enzyme. This study involved 1) determination of Hcy-induced endothelial cell proliferation in cell cultures of rat aortic endothelial cells (RAEC) by hemacytometer, 2) measurement of Hcy-induced vascular smooth muscle cell (A7r5) proliferation using H-thymidine incorporation, 3) the detection of Hcy in cellular fractions using slot blotting, and 4) examination of hepatic tissue from Hcy fed rats for enzymatic activity levels of CBS activity. The results suggest that Hcy; 1) is involved in inducing both RAEC and A7r5 cellular proliferation, 2) and/or its components cross the endothelial cellular membrane and is localized in the cytosol and 3) reduces hepatic CBS activity. The mechanisms which Hcy utilizes to produce these results are not yet fully understood. Understanding these mechanisms may provide useful information in the prevention and/or reduction of the various pathologic effects attributable to elevated Hcy.

<br><br>The purpose of this project was to measure and compare the relative amounts of Vitamin C in generic and name brand juices using an iodine-starch solution as an indicator. After introducing juices by drops to the indicator solution and recording the data, I compared and determined a relative amount of Vitamin C for the five different types of juices and their name brand counterparts.<br><br>The results supported the first hypothesis in that the generic (Sam's) brand would have more Vitamin C than the name (Ocean Spray) brand. The second hypothesis that stated that the more opaque juices would have more Vitamin C was incorrect. The more transparent juices had more Vitamin C.<br><br>From this project you can see that the generic, transparent brands of juices have relatively more Vitamin C.

MT-3 AND METAL CONCENTRATIONS IN MOUSE BRAIN TISSUE THAT EXHIBITS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
Brendan Stephen Doms
Breck School, Minneapolis, MN, USA

The question addressed in this project was whether there were significant variations in levels of metallothionein-3 (MT-3) and concentrations of the metals Zn, Cu, Al, Ca, Fe, Mg, and Mn present in brain tissue of mice (Mus musculus) that had been genetically altered for another study.<br><br> The first hypothesis of this project was that transgenic positive mice, which had exhibited AD, would have significantly less MT-3 in their brain tissue than the transgenic negative mice, which had not inherited the AD gene. The validity of this hypothesis could not be determined because results produced no quantifiable data, however gels strongly suggest the presence of MT-3 in transgenic positive, transgenic negative, and control mice.<br><br> The second hypothesis was that the concentrations of the Zn and Cu analyzed would be significantly less in the brains of transgenic positive mice than in the brains of transgenic negative mice. The data showed no correlation between the two transgenic genotypes for any metal, but the two transgenic genotypes had significantly less Al when compared to control mice. Whether this reduction of Al was an anomaly, a cause, or a symptom of AD could not be determined, because both the transgenic genotypes inherited this lowered level of Al.<br><br>

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF WOOL BIOPOLISHING ENZYMES WHEN VARYING TIME AND TEMPERATURE
Kimberly Nicole Braulick
St. Mary's High School, Sleepy Eye, Minnesota, United States of America

The reason I chose this project was to learn more about enzymes and their effect on the wool fiber. I wanted to find an environmentally safe and reusable enzyme. I also wanted to enhance my knowledge of wool to better familiarize myself with my own sheep.<br><br> The process of biopolishing includes a bleaching and enzyme treatment. First, add the wool to the bleaching solution, agitating it in the pretreatment. Repeat this process with the first enzyme varying the time and temperature. When the process is complete, repeat it again using two other enzymes.<br><br> The wool samples treated at the lowest temperature for various time increments and enzymes had little effect. The recommended time and temperature of the first enzyme had an unsurpassed effect on removing the scales from the fiber, not completely destroying them. The wool samples that were in the enzyme treatment for the longest time and average temperature had less destruction than the samples tested at higher temperatures. The other biopolishing enzymes had little effect on the fiber, smoothening only a few scales.<br><br> Various organizations are interested in biopolished wool because the material will not melt to your skin. This experiment is beneficial in finding a durable material. To continue this experiment I could test the wool using the Bradford Protein Assay process so that I could identify the protein levels of the wool after biopolishing.

HYDROGEN PRODUCTION BY BIONANOSYSTEM FROM WATER IN SUNLIGHT
Arif Anar Bayramov
"Young Talents" Lyceum of Baku State University, Baku, AZERBAIJAN

The main idea of the work was to ensure stable operation of the photocatalytic system of photosynthesis decomposing water into O2 and hydrogen ions, as a system for biotechnological production of hydrogen. <br><br>Chloroplast is the organelle performing the function of photosynthesis and containing bionanoelements performing various parts of photosynthetic process. It begins from photodecomposition of water and ends with the formation of ATP and NADPH. The research was performed on water-oxidizing complex. Water-oxidizing complex was isolated by centrifugation. Firstly, I destroyed chloroplast into small membrane particles by using special chemicals – detergent.<br><br> The absorption spectral analysis showed that in the isolated state the chlorophyll of the reaction centre, the least stable element of water-oxidizing complex during the lighting system in order to start the process, compared with the light-harvesting chlorophyll and reaction centre of photosystem I. Based on the measurement of delayed fluorescence of chlorophyll, found that Mn4OxCa cluster, is also the most sensitive element of photosystem II. Addition buffer extract from Danae racemosa L to water-oxidizing complex increased stability of bionanosystem – water-oxidizing complex. In my opinion the best way is the creation of effective protection of native water-oxidizing complex maintaining high efficiency of the process. <br><br>So, (i) it evidences that in principal there is possibility to increase the stability of bionanosystem. (ii) I think that antioxidant and some free radicals quenchers contained in water extract is the way to increase the stability of my bionanosystem. The results of my experiments show that my idea to use native bionanosystem is real.

COPPER CHELATION AS A POSSIBLE ATHEROSCLEROSIS TREATMENT
Mashad Arora
Science Academy of South Texas, Mercedes, TX

Heart disease and atherosclerosis cause many deaths to US citizens annually. Copper is known to be associated with atherosclerosis, so it was postulated that chelation of copper would be effective against atherosclerosis. Copper chelation involves adding certain compounds, called chelators, to the blood to form complexes with copper and prevent it from reacting. Three known chelators (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), cyclohexanediaminetetraacetic acid (CDTA), and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)) were tested for their effectiveness in chelating two forms of copper: (1) copper ions in solution and (2) copper ions bound to bovine serum albumin (BSA). It was hypothesized that the multipurpose chelator EDTA would be most effective in chelating copper since it is effective against many other metals inside and out of the blood, including iron. The results showed that EDTA (1 mM-4 mM), CDTA (4 mM), and DTPA (4 mM) are effective in chelating unbound copper ions in solution. Although an initial test showed that EDTA is effective in chelating copper bound to BSA at 12.5 mM-100 mM concentrations, a diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC) assay of copper in the presence of BSA at .03125 mM-.25 mM chelator concentrations did not indicate significant copper chelation by any chelator. A bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay showed that copper bound to BSA could be chelated by all chelators at .125 mM-.25 mM concentrations. The research suggested that EDTA was the most effective in chelating unbound copper. However, conflicting results regarding chelators’ effectiveness against copper bound to BSA suggest the DDC and/or BCA assays might not be entirely reliable.

UNUSUAL COLD DENATURATION OF THE SMALL PROTEIN DOMAIN
Natalie Melinda Shih
Laramie Senior High School, Laramie, WY

Currently, it is not possible to predict the protein structure from its amino acid sequence and experimental determination of structure is difficult. Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanism of protein folding. Small proteins are simpler models to study but they are often thermally unstable and make poor models for larger proteins. The small ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain was used to study because previous data suggested it was thermally stable. The protein was chemically synthesized using automated solid phase peptide synthesis. The crude peptide was purified by high performance liquid chromatography to obtain the pure protein used for experimentation. The thermal and chemical denaturations of UBA were studied using circular dichroism and fluorescence. The experimental data was fit into a model with a single set of thermodynamic parameters. Unexpectedly, UBA displayed cold denaturation. In order to shift the cold denaturation to measureable temperatures, higher concentrations of urea were added to the solution. Small proteins exhibiting this trait are highly unusual because it requires a large heat capacity, which is usually seen in larger proteins. Heat capacity is associated with hydrophobic effects. UBA domains can bind to other proteins and these protein-protein interactions are mainly due to hydrophobic forces. Since UBA is highly hydrophobic, cold denaturation can be observed. As a small protein domain, UBA can be used as a model for protein folding studies that exhibit cold denaturation and would be an interesting model for future thermodynamic and kinetic studies of protein folding.

These results are expected to significantly enhance the ability of researchers to explore the impact of ECM on cancer.

INULIN VS. CELLULOSE IN ETHANOL FERMENTATION
Apurv Suman
Oak Hall School, Gainesville, FL

Inulin and Kluyveromyces marxianus provide a system that eliminates use of commercial enzymes in ethanol production (unlike cellulosic fermentation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae). This provides the potential to eliminate the greatest expense in ethanol production. <br><br>Cellulosic fermentation was run using Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cellulase [50µL/g cellulose], and cellulose [1%, 2%, 5%, and 10%] at 37ºC. Inulin [1%, 2%, 5%, and 10%] was directly fermented by Kluyveromyces marxianus at 42ºC. <br><br>Results of experimentation showed that inulin fermentation produced, on an average, 98.5% more ethanol within 24 hours. Cellulose fermentation only managed to equalize with inulin fermentation after a full 120 hours (at which point inulin fermentation had reached plateaus several hours beforehand). <br><br>In comparing the initial rates of both systems with regard to substrate concentrations, it was seen that inulin fermentation remained linear while the efficiency of cellulose fermentation began to level off. Thereby, inulin has greater potential with higher substrate concentrations as well. <br><br>Inulin fermentation produced greater concentrations of ethanol at a faster rate without diminishing performance at higher concentrations of substrate. Considering that inulin fermentation accomplished all this without the addition of commercial enzymes (the most expensive part of production), it was concluded that inulin has greater potential than cellulose as a substrate in ethanol fermentation.

THE FUNCTION OF A NOVEL APOPTOSIS REGULATING PROTEIN, XAF-1C, IN BREAST CANCER CELLS
Charles William Dyer
Caddo Parish Magnet High School, Shreveport, LA, USA

XAF-1 (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis associated factor 1) is a protein that indirectly regulates caspase activity and promotes apoptosis. A novel splice variant of XAF-1(A), termed XAF-1C, has been discovered that may also play a role in apoptosis. Many cancer cells express low levels of XAF-1(A) and XAF-1C, partially accounting for their resistance to extra-cellular inducers of apoptosis released by the body’s immune system. One such inducer, TRAIL, is released by the body’s natural killer (NK) cells and selectively induces apoptosis in cancerous cells. Low XAF-1 expression could be a factor in TRAIL resistance among cancer cell lines.<br><br> To determine the function of XAF-1C, MCF-7 breast cancer cells were stably transfected with XAF-1(A) and XAF-1C to compare their apoptotic response. Transfected cells were pretreated with etoposide, a cancer chemotherapeutic drug, and IFNá followed by TRAIL treatment. Apoptotic response was calculated as a measure of percent inhibition of cell viability. Also, the cell cycle profiles of the stable transfectants were measured by FACS and compared to wild type and vector control cells.<br><br> XAF-1C caused a significant increase in sensitization to apoptosis when compared to XAF-1(A) and the control cell lines. This increase was seen in cells pretreated with both etoposide and IFN and in cells treated with TRAIL alone. XAF-1C expression also caused an altered cell cycle profile, suggesting a proliferative effect by the protein.<br><br> These results show that XAF-1C expression results in a greater sensitization of cells to apoptosis than does XAF-1(A). This suggests that the delivery of the XAF-1C protein or gene could cause cancer cells to be more vulnerable to combination treatment. Also, the FACS results indicate that XAF-1C may play a proliferative role, a finding that warrants further research.<br><br>

PROTEOMIC CHARACTERIZATION OF THE EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX (ECM) TO IDENTIFY TUMOR ASSOCIATED BIOMOLECULES PART 2

The proteomic composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM) influences the growth and motility of cancer cells. The identification of differences between healthy and cancerous ECM can provide a list of candidate biomolecules that can be validated as tumor suppressors or promoters. <br><br> The proteomic composition of a sample is obtained using an optimized protein digestion protocol followed by chromatographic separation and analysis of the individual fractions using tandem mass spectrometry. The number of peptides for a given protein sequence are used to determine the proteomic composition and estimate protein abundances. <br><br> Three ECM samples from rat mammary were characterized using the above procedure: virgin, involution, and involution treated with ibuprofen. Virgin mammary matrix supports normal mammary epithelial growth and was used as a control. Involution is the pro-inflammatory ECM that occurs following pregnancy and promotes tumor cell dissemination. Involution matrix from animals treated with ibuprofen appears to behave functionally closer to the virgin ECM. <br><br> Analysis of experimental data identified ECM proteins with biological significance (e.g., decorin, agrin, biglycan). Two-way ANOVA showed statistically significant differences in the abundances of proteins between the samples. The proteins were ranked based on the magnitude of the difference and their biological significance, thereby providing a prioritized list of candidate tumor promoters and suppressors. Independent research has confirmed that one of the proteins identified (MMP-2) plays a critical role in the metastasis of tumors.<br><br> This research has applications to the development of new breast cancer detection methods and drugs to treat cancer based on ECM protein imbalances.

Marian High School, Mishawaka, IN

Tuberculosis is an infectious disease, caused by the Mycobacteria tuberculosis bacteria, which kills nearly 2 million people each year. The treatments that exist today consist of complex antibiotic therapies which are long, harmful, and have low compliance. Like most bacteria, Mycobacteria secrete proteins. One way proteins are secreted is via the ESX-1 secretion machine. It is known that when the ESX-1 secretion machine is not functioning, Mycobacterium tuberculosis can no longer infect humans. Being able to detect specific proteins that are known to be secreted via the ESX-1 secretion machine allows the status of the machine to be determined. The main focal point of this project was to develop a new, highly efficient process for screening whole-cell Mycobacteria for the secretion of proteins using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. I hypothesized that secreted proteins from whole-cell Mycobacteria can be directly detected using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. To develop the assay, positive and negative controls of Mycobacterium marinum, a close relative of M. tuberculosis, were screened for ESX-1 protein secretion. Using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to detect protein secretion in whole-cell bacteria will eventually make it possible to scan the thousands of mutated bacterial cells necessary to make conclusions on which genes are responsible for ESX-1 function. This is the first step in a process that will eventually provide new gene targets for future antibiotics or currently existing ones.

DON'T EAT THAT
Stedmond Danzel Ware
Greenwood High School, Greenwood, MS, U.S.A.

Which meal is most nutritionally sound? This is the question that this project is based on. Analysis was made using the same procedure that is used in food science. Food menus used consisted of store bought prepackaged frozen meals, fresh foods prepared using the Atkins diet, fresh foods prepared using the South Beach Diet, and fresh food prepared the "soul food" way. I hypothesized that the store bought meals would be the most nutritionally sound meals. My procedure included Vitamin C testing, Starch testing, Protein testing, and Fat testing. Each test involves the liquidation of the food in all the menus,the testing of food based on the chemical reaction of the food. Chemical reactions observed and measured were based on the discoloration of the chemical substances being used. The Vitamin C testing is the only testing that I was able to give an accurate account for. All the rest of the tests,which included the Starch test, the Protein test, and the Fat test, were only able to give me an acknowledgement of the presence of or tell the circumference of the allotted amount of starch, protein and fat in each diet. The results of my experiment showed that even though the store bought menu didn't contain the most fat and starch, unfortunately, it did not contain the least amount. The Atkins and the South Beach dietary menus were the ones that contained the most protein and vitamin C, but they contained the least amount of starches and fat. Hence, proving my hypothesis wrong.

DANGERS OF DRINKING: THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL IN PC-12 CULTURED CELLS
Heather Kay Ali
Fayetteville Christian Academy, Fayetteville, Arkansas, United States of America

Alcohol (ethanol) is one of the most abused drugs in the United States. Millions of dollars are spent on rehabilitation and detoxification programs annually. This study demonstrates some of ethanol’s direct effects on PC-12 cells. PC-12 cells are cultured from a transplantable rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cell line. Cultured PC-12 cells share similar neurochemical properties, with brain cells. PC-12 cells were exposed to varying amounts of ethanol and then incubated for 24 hours, after which the effects were recorded. Tests included HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) to measure neurotransmitter content, RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) extraction to determine changes in cell replication, and Fluorescent Microscopy with Hoechst 33258 staining and Tunel staining to evaluate alterations in cell structure. The results of the study demonstrated evidence of cellular dysfunction and morphological changes with increasing ethanol dosage. Dose dependent decreases in Dopamine, DOPAC (3,4 Dihydroxyphenyl Acetic Acid), and HVA (Homovanillic Acid) were observed with exposures to higher concentrations of ethanol. Total RNA concentration also fell with ethanol exposure in a dose dependent relationship. Cell morphology is disrupted with DNA fragmentation and condensation as evidence by Hoechst 33258 Staining, and apoptotic cell changes on Tunel Staining. This data suggests that ethanol produces a neurotoxic effect in PC-12 cells.

SHATTERED SUGAR
Laura Ann Willig
Cornerstone Christian School, San Angelo, Texas, United States

This project was conducted to determine the best temperature for cooking sugar to increase the strength of sugar structures. In the culinary world, chefs spend hours making sugar sculptures, only to have them shatter. Sugar was cooked to various temperatures, starting at 144 degrees Celsius, and poured into bars. After the bars cooled, they were tested, and their strengths were calculated. Then the average strength, the median strength, and the standard deviation were calculated and compared. The experiment showed that the strength of the sugar increased as the cooking temperature increased, to a point. The highest temperature tested, 160 degrees Celsius, was weaker than the test at 154 degrees. Two different groups were made and tested. The second set of tests was stronger, at the same temperature, than the first set, indicating that the humidity may have had an effect of the strength. The humidity in the second day was six times greater than it was on the first testing day.

ARE THE ALPHA AND BETA CHAINS OF THE INTERLEUKIN-2 RECEPTOR PRESENT ON THE SURFACE OF C1498?
Benjamin Kahn Boxer
Nicolet High School, Milwauke, Wisconsin, United States of America

The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether cells from a natural killer T cell (NKT) leukemia, C1498, expressed the receptor for the growth factor interleukin-2 (IL2) on its cell membrane. This experiment was the first step in a multi-step project that will eventually prove or disprove the hypothesis that C1498 leukemia cells proliferate through an autocrine circuit. If it is discovered that C1498 goes through an autocrine circuit, then methods to block the autocrine circuit will be explored. <br><br> The goal of this experiment is to discover if the alpha and the beta chains of the interleukin-2 receptor are present on the surface of C1498. Antibodies specific to the alpha and beta chains of the interleukin-2 receptor were added to the C1498 leukemia cells. The antibodies were tagged with the fluorochrome phycoerythrin so that they could be detected in a flow cytometer. When the C1498 cells were analyzed by the flow cytometer, it was discovered that both the beta and alpha chains of the IL-2 receptor were present on the surface of C1498. <br><br>This experiment proved for the first time that C1498 expressed the receptor for interleukin-2 on its cell membrane. Thus, C1498 leukemia may be proliferating through an autocrine circuit in which it produces its own growth factor (interleukin-2). Without the receptor for the growth factor interleukin-2, it would be impossible for C1498 to operate through an autocrine circuit. Future experiments will determine whether the C1498 leukemia cells are producing the growth factor interleukin-2.<br><br>

COMPUTATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION ON ANTI-DIABETIC COMPOUND IN FOXGLOVE
Peiyan Duan
No. 2 Secondary School Attached to East China Normal University, Shanghai, CHINA

Foxglove is a plant with sweet taste and refreshing fragrance. The purpose of this study is to investigate its active compound, antidiabetic effect and mechanisms of action. Firstly, I used computer docking to explore the potentially antidiabetic compounds in foxglove. Docking result shows that 12 compounds in foxglove could nicely bind with 32 protein targets related to diabetes. Of all the 12 active compounds, aucubin, a natural non-toxic compound, has the highest normalized fit score (79.2%) with its protein target, glycogen phosphorylase-a (GPa), an important enzyme controlling the process of glycogenolysis. Pharmacological inhibition of GPa is a strategy to attenuate overproduction of glucose and hence limit the pathogenic consequences of hyperglycaemia. Next, I did an enzymatic experiment to test the result of computer docking. The result showed that aucubin exhibited inhibition activity towards GPa at different concentrations. It reaches an inhibition rate of 83% at 100 microMOLES. In cell experiment, I found that aucubin can increase the content of glycogen in human hepatocytes, which confirmed the inhibition activity of aucubin at cellular level. Besides, Investigation on inhibition effect of aucubin on GPa at various glucose concentrations showed that the IC50 of aucubin decreased with the increase of glucose concentration, indicating that aucubin only appears to be active at high glucose level. This is really meaningful because it showed the selectivity of aucubin and avoid the side effect of hypoglycemia of most clinical agents. Finally, the result of in vivo experiment also showed that aucubin has a significant antidiabetic effect compared to metformin.

IMMOBILIZATION OF ENZYMES VIA CONCENTRIC NAFION/CELLULASE ELECTROSPUN FIBERS FOR BIOETHANOL PRODUCTION
Alicia Danielle D'Souza
Clark High School, Plano, TX

Cellulase is an enzyme that converts the most abundant biomass (cellulose) to glucose, which can then be transformed to the biofuel ethanol. A significant challenge in biocatalysis is to immobilize and stabilize enzymes. This project discusses a way to immobilize cellulase in the form of non-woven fiber mats by electrospinning to improve bioethanol production from cellulose. Electrospinning is a versatile process to create nanofibers using a bead of polymer solution drawn towards a grounded collector within an electric field. Though not electrospinnable itself, cellulase can be spun into fibers using concentric electrospinning. Cellulase fibers were electrospun concentrically using a Nafion/polyethylene oxide (PEO) solution as the outer shell, and cellulase as the inner core. The enzyme fibers were washed to remove the PEO leaving only porous Nafion as the outer shell. Nafion is a superacid polymer that functions in synergistic fashion with cellulose to hydrolyze. The enzymes were cross-linked with glutaraldehyde, which immobilizes and imparts enhanced stability to the enzymes. The Nafion/enzyme fiber activity was then assayed using cellulose as a substrate. While the activity of free enzymes in solution declines rapidly, the Nafion/enzyme fibers maintained activity even after 2 days of continuous use. The Nafion/enzyme fibers were 3 times more effective in converting paper to glucose, compared to only Nafion fibers. The Nafion/enzyme fibers were more active when incubated at higher temperatures (up to 60°C). These enzyme fibers have great potential as membrane reactors incorporated into a flow system for efficient large-scale conversion of cellulose into glucose for bioethanol.<br><br>

AN INNOVATIVE STRATEGY FOR THE PROTECTION AGAINST CHEMO-TOXICITY AND RADIATION POISONING
Preeti Singhal
Arlington High School, Arlington, TX

Cancer, a disease characterized by uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells, kills millions of people worldwide every year. Because cancer cells get resistant to most treatments, I chose to observe a transporter of these drugs called RLIP (Ral-Interacting protein), a stress-defense protein that is found ubiquitously from drosophila to humans. <br><br> My purpose was to observe the expression of RLIP and to see the cytotoxic effect of the RLIP antibody on various cell types. I also wanted to see whether introducing RLIP liposomes would prevent radiation toxicity in mouse embryonic fibroblasts as well as in lung and breast cancer cells. In order to observe the RLIP expression, I performed a Western blot and immuno cytochemistry. The cytotoxic affect of the RLIP antibody was determined using a MTT assay and TUNEL apoptosis assay. The protective effect of RLIP liposomes against chemo and radiation toxicity was shown through liposomal delivery, followed by radiation exposure. After seven days, the cells were stained with methylene blue, and colonies were counted. <br><br> Surprisingly, I found that RLIP is upregulated during malignancy. When inhibiting RLIP with the RLIP antibody, I noticed that cancer cells underwent apoptosis while normal cells were spared. In the MEFs, I observed that the RLIP knockout cells were most sensitive to radiation, and after the administration of RLIP liposomes, I saw a remarkable improvement in cell survival. Nevertheless, RLIP containing cells were the most radio-resistant. These finding are of fundamental significance because they provide a single target for enhancing chemotherapy and radiation. RLIP plays a pivotal role in defending normal cells from a variety of poisons and stresses and cancer cells from apoptosis. My results indicate that normal cells do not need RLIP for survival, however, cancer cells cannot survive without it.

A HIGH-THROUGHPUT, ECONOMICAL, AND HIGHLY SENSITIVE SELECTION METHOD FOR DE NOVO PROTEIN ENGINEERING
David Andrew Levary
Parkway Central High School, Chesterfield, MO

The ability to create proteins with predefined properties would revolutionize fields ranging from medicine to environmental engineering, accomplishing tasks from tissue-specific drug delivery to bioremediation. Isolation of de novo protein interactions is well-suited to the yeast surface display system due to its unique ability to process complex protein folds; however, current methods using fluorescence activated cell sorting have had limited success. A technique for screening yeast surface-displayed libraries was developed utilizing multivalent cell surface interactions. Streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads were employed as the primary model for a multivalent solid surface. The increased number of yeast-to-ligand contacts that this material afforded was shown to dramatically improve the selection of extremely low affinity binders with a greater than 30,000-fold enrichment achieved from an initial ratio of 1 binder to 100,000 non-binders. A general strategy for the screening of naïve libraries that utilizes a negative selection with bare streptavidin beads followed by positive selection with progressively decreasing ligand density in successive rounds of sorting was successfully tested against a model hen egg lysozyme target. The ligand-saturated magnetic bead format allows for the rapid processing of library populations of over four billion cells at a cost of mere dollars compared with the hundreds of thousands necessary to maintain a standard flow cytometer while decreasing the necessary amount of antigen input almost a billion-fold. Utilization of multivalent cell surface interactions provides a highly sensitive, rapid, and economical method for screening naïve yeast-surface displayed combinatorial protein libraries.

INDOLE-3-CARBINOL PROTECTS NORMAL NEURONAL CELLS (HCN-1) AND KILLS BRAIN CANCER CELLS (SK-N) BY DOWNREGULATING CLYCLOOXYGENASE-2 AND NUCLEAR FACTOR KAPPA B IN VITRO ANALYSES
Lascelles Ewen Lyn-Cook
Hall High School, Little Rock, Arkansas, United States 

<br><br>Indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a dietary agent found naturally in cruciferous vegetables, has shown anticancer effects in a number of cancers. The present study was designed to determine if I3C was also a neuroprotective agent. Normal cortical neuronal cells (HCN-1A) were treated for 24 hrs with 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 micromolar of ZnCl2. Cellular damage and toxicity was determined by induction of apoptosis and proliferation assays. Treatment of cells with 0.1 micromolar of ZnCl2 and 100 micromolar of I3C decreased apoptosis by 42% and stimulated the growth of the HCN-1A cells by a factor of 7. This was significant (p<0.005) and showed that I3C can protect normal cells against induced apoptosis. I3C also exerted anti-cancer effects on the SK-N tumor cells by inhibiting their growth and inducing apoptosis. Cox-2 and NF-kappa B were recently reported to be involved in neuronal cell damage and cancer. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses revealed that I3C decreased expression of Cox-2 in ZnCl2-induced normal brain cells by 40%. NF-kappa B expression was completely downregulated in the normal cells by I3C. Both NF-kappa B and Cox-2 expression was decreased in the SK-N brain tumor cells by I3C. Recent studies have shown that neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinsons have high levels of Cox-2 expression. My results are novel in that I3C, a natural dietary agent significantly (p<0.005) decreased Cox-2 expression in ZnCl2-treated normal cells and further protected the normal brain cells from apoptosis by ZnCl2. These data have demonstrated that I3C is a neuroprotective agent. <br><br>

HOW SILICA NANOPARTICLES DAMAGE FUNGI?
Diana Galautdinova
Gymnasium 7, Kazan, Russian Federation, Kazan, RUSSIA

The goal of my research is a directed modification of silica nanoparticles to obtain enzyme inhibitors that function inside the fungus tissue. Mycotic infections are particularly dangerous, as they result in tissue destruction and contribute to the propagation of diseases, being the cause of death in case of HIV as well. The secretory asparaginic proteinases of the Candida albicans fungus, SAP4 and SAP2, were selected as subjects of research. Silica nanoparticles have the membrane permeability and can deliver a component for the proteinases’ inactivation into a fungus cell.<br><br>I modified silica spheres by amino groups and by zinc ions consecutively and then by means of UV-spectrophotometry measured the SAP2 and SAP4 activity in relation to a specific substrate – hemoglobin. The particles’ size was identified by dynamic light scattering method. 7 sets of tests were carried out, 5 times each. Silica nanoparticles that were modified over the surface by amino groups and zinc ions led to inactivation of both enzymes 100.0±0.1%. This combination can bind with active site (amine fragments), with the metal site (zinc ions) and result in enzyme inactivation. We explain the achievable effect by formation of a poly-nuclear Zn(II) complex with nanoparticles, with nitrogen coordination of Zn(II) of aminogroups fixed on the surface of silica particles. <br><br>The performed experiment shows that a directed modification of silica nanoparticles allows us to effectively control the fungus enzymes’ activity. So these nanoparticles can be used in developing next-generation drugs against mycotic infections.

MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS OF GRAMICIDIN A AT EXTREME TEMPERATURES
Ravi Uday Sheth
Sycamore High School, Cincinnati, OH

Gramicidin A is a linear antibiotic peptide found naturally in the bacterial species Baccilius brevis. When dimerized, gramicidin acts as a cation selective transmembrane channel. Recent experimental studies have shown ion translocation to occur in gramicidin at unexpectedly high temperatures. These findings have large implications; gramicidin has many high temperature applications, most notably as a membrane in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. However, the molecular mechanisms and structural behaviors of the channel at these extreme temperatures have not been previously examined.<br><br> Molecular dynamics simulations use known physics to approximate the interactions of a system of atoms. To determine the effects of extreme temperatures on the channel, gramicidin systems were examined using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations on supercomputers. The two known conformations of the channel, the head-to-head helical dimer and the intertwined double helix, were simulated at both 300K and 360K.<br><br> High temperatures were found to decrease hydrogen bonding and the pore radius of both conformations; however, despite these high temperatures, the channel’s overall structure was retained. Additionally, a gating transition, which has never previously been reported, was observed in the double helix conformation at extreme temperatures. These findings suggest the viability of gramicidin as a high temperature membrane, and as a future model for gating studies.

SYNTHESIS, VIRTUAL SCREENING AND BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY STUDIES OF 3,4-DIHYDROISOCOUMARIN DERIVATIVES
Mykhaylo Rimel
Lvivs'ka Szosh No. 45, Lviv, UKRAINE

Biological activity of the 150 3,4-dihydroisocoumarin-3-carboxamides was investigated in silico using online-service PASS (Prediction of Activity Spectra for Substances) Results revealed a prediction for 15 compounds with the highest probability of antimicrobial, antifungal, antiprotozoal, antiischemic and cardioprotective biological activity. These compounds showed high probability to be active index (Pa) in one or more types of biological activity (range 0.78..0.92) and low Pa in toxicity as well as low probability to be inactive index (Pi<0.01). Selected compounds were synthesized by copper-catalyzed arylation reaction, with following intramolecular cyclization of intermediates of unsaturated methyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate with ortho-methoxycarbonylarenediazonium bromides, obtained from the corresponding substituted methyl anthranilates. Arylation of unsaturated compounds with simultaneous intramolecular cyclization yielded 3,4-dihydroisocoumarin derivatives.<br><br>Implemented synthesis scheme is a simple, one-step process that does not require complex reactions conditions and is cheaper than other methods for isocoumarin compound synthesis. Obtained compounds were sent for in vitro screening studies to investigate their antimicrobial properties.<br><br>We have also tested for the first time the reaction of 2,5-dimethoxycarbonyl benzenediazonium bromides with methyl/ethyl acrylate and styrenes in the presence of Copper(I) bromide. It was found that the arylation of unsaturated compounds with a simultaneous intramolecular cyclization occurred and 3,4-dihydroisocoumarin derivatives were obtained as a result of the reaction.

SHATTERED SUGAR

Cornerstone Christian School, San Angelo, Texas, United States of America

This project was conducted to explore the possibilities of using other boiled sugar formulas to produce sugar pieces that were not yellow. Previous experiments showed that as the temperature was increased for bars made with corn syrup, the bars turned a darker yellow. These tests were conducted by boiling different sugar formulas to the same temperature, pouring them into bars, testing their strengths, and observing their color. The cost to produce each batch of sugar formula was calculated and compared as well. Formulas using glucose and isomalt were compared to the basic boiled sugar method that uses corn syrup. The glucose bars were stronger and lighter in color than those made with corn syrup. The isomalt bars were clear, but they were 25% weaker than the corn syrup bars; they were also twenty-nine times more expensive to produce as the bars made with corn syrup.

James Madison High School, Vienna, Virginia, USA

The purpose of this study was to calculate and analyze statistical data associated with human gene introns at the chromosome level. Nucleotide data for human genes (1.2GB) was downloaded from the Harvard website. Java programs were written to calculate statistics such as average intron length and percentages of each of the four DNA nucleotides. Initial processing showed that about fifteen percent of the genes included unknown nucleotides. These genes were excluded from the final statistics.<br><br> Analysis of the results indicated that there is a large spread in average intron length between human chromosomes. This result was unexpected because it is accepted that more complex organisms have longer introns. Therefore, the findings seem to indicate that some human chromosomes are more "complex" than others. This variation also indicates that additional intron research should be done at levels below the species, such as at the chromosome and gene levels. Genbank-115, which includes a large sample of nonhuman genes from less complex species, such as flies and worms, was also downloaded and processed like a human chromosome. After comparing the data, Chromosome 19 was found to be less complex, like the nonhuman genes, based on average intron length. Chromosomes Y and 13 appeared to be the most complex. Percent of the nucleotide adenine was also found to increase with the more complex chromosomes.<br><br> Common, serious genetic diseases appear to be associated with chromosomes of moderate complexity, and not the least or most complex.

SIMULTANEOUS DETECTION OF E. COLI O157:H7 TOXIN GENES BY NUCLEIC ACID SEQUENCE-BASED AMPLIFICATION
Jennifer Jing Huang
Oak Grove High School, Hattiesburg, MS 39402

Escherichia coli O157:H7 food poisoning is an international health concern. Early, rapid, sensitive, and accurate detection is essential to the prevention and containment of outbreaks as well as the treatment of subsequent illnesses. Many conventional techniques such as culture methods can identify E. coli O157:H7. However, they take tens of hours to complete analyses. On the other hand, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA), using fluorescent molecular beacons, is a fast, accurate, and highly sensitive real-time method of simultaneous E. coli gene detection. In brief, the NASBA reaction solution contains a buffer, nucleotides, primers, RNase H, reverse transcriptase, T7 RNA polymerase, fluorescent molecular beacons, and target RNA/DNA. Through reverse transcriptase, each RNA/DNA molecule becomes a RNA-cDNA heteroduplex. Afterward, RNase H digests the RNA strand, leaving the single-stranded cDNA. The cDNA is used as a template to make double-stranded DNA that contains a T7 promoter. Transcription by T7 RNA polymerase generates RNA. Each amplification cycle can make 100-1000 copies of RNA. Target-specific fluorescent molecular beacons shine when they bind to their complementary target RNA. The more copies of RNA, the brighter the fluorescence will be, and the color of the fluorescence indicates the presence of a specific gene. During amplification, the sample is read for fluorescence output every minute. The results show that NASBA is a fast, efficient, sensitive, and accurate method of detecting E. coli O157H7 toxin genes. In contrast to the PCR method, NASBA is much faster, has less opportunity for contamination, and does not need expensive PCR machines.

ISOLATION OF THE ROLE OF EARTHWORMS IN THE CHEMICAL ALTERATION TRAJECTORY OF LIGNIN IN OLD AND YOUNG FOREST SYSTEMS
Russell B. Conard

Invasive earthworm activity has been shown to shift forest ecology by altering the rate of litter decomposition, organic carbon content of soil, and impact of fungi and bacteria. A microscale chemical analysis of the role of earthworms in litter decomposition in forest ecosystems is lacking and may provide insight into the macroscale role of forests in the global carbon cycle. This research suggests a direct correlation between invasive earthworm activity and the chemical alteration trajectory of forest litter undergoing decomposition. The analysis of lignin decay in forest floor litter was determined using an isotope-tagging chemolysis mass spectrometry technique with modification to include a semi-automated data extraction and analysis method with direct graphical export developed during the course of this research. The influence of earthworms can be studied by analyzing samples from forest systems known to have native or invasive species. Also, earthworm activity was isolated from other factors by analyzing open air samples (which permit earthworm decay) and samples in litter bags (which eliminate the influence earthworms). This research showed that earthworm activity inhibits lignin decomposition by fungi, causing it to accumulate with respect to low earthworm sites. Background microbial activity assessed by litter bag studies demonstrated differences between high and low earthworm sites; however, the major litter alteration trajectories were related to earthworm activity. These findings suggest that invasive earthworms are altering the rate and nature of litter decay and thereby interrupting the established organic carbon cycling pathways in these forests. Long term implications are yet to be determined.

ANALYSIS OF FEL D 1 ALLERGEN TRANSCRIPTS IN FELIS CATUS SALIVA USING REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION QUANTITATIVE POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (RT-QPCR)
Savannah Joy Tobin
West Salem High School, Salem, OR

In this study a diagnostic technique was created to measure mRNA transcripts of the major cat allergen Felis domesticus 1 (Fel d 1) in cat saliva using a variation of Reverse Transcription quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR). The purpose of this research was to determine the existence of hypoallergenic cats and to develop a methodology capable of comparing Fel d 1 levels among multiple cats. This study documents a new type of gene specific reverse transcription that allows analysis of mRNA transcripts in as little as 4 µl of feline whole saliva. The methodology was then optimized by trialing both GAPDH and RPS7 endogenous control genes to improve the precision of the technique. The Russian Blue cat is anecdotally referred to as hypoallergenic, and this research attests to the breed’s lower expression of the Fel d 1 allergen. Using ∆∆CT calculations to compare the relative expression of Fel d 1 among multiple cats, preliminary results indicated that the hypoallergenic cat expressed significantly lower levels of Fel d 1 when compared to the other test subjects. As an ongoing investigation, future replication is needed to draw definite conclusions, but the main objective was achieved by developing and optimizing a methodology for future use. The saliva based RT-qPCR developed in this research offers an inexpensive, time efficient, and non-invasive technique alternative to blood diagnostics that can be utilized as a viable tool in future veterinary diagnostics.

DETERMINATION OF ESTROGEN AS A TRIGGER OF PROTANDRIC COLONY FORMATION OF AMPHIPRION OCELLARIS
Emily Marie Crisp
Loudoun County Academy of Science, Sterling, VA

Amphiprion ocellaris form colonies of only one female and one mature male. All A. ocellaris are born non-functional males, and change sex to become a functional male and then the female as they move through the dominance structure of the colony. This experiment has been used to find the triggers behind the formation of the dominance structure within the colony. The hypothesis for this experiment is that estrogen is responsible for determining colony formation. Water samples were taken and run through HPLC to look for forms of estrogen, as well as a change in concentration of estrogen throughout colony formation. A chi square test was used to analyze the area under the peaks of the chromatographs, with samples as the observed values, and the negative control as the expected. Research shows that the change in the estradiol level read at 200 nm on the chromatographs is statistically significant.

MECHANISMS OF TUMOR CELL INVASION: THE ROLE OF STAT3 IN SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA
Kendall Marie Hughes
Caddo Parish Magnet High School, Shreveport, LA

The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) is a central regulator of proliferation, survival, and cell motility, and is elevated in many cancers, including skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). This study aims to determine the role of Stat3 in the invasive behavior of skin SCC, a clinically aggressive form of skin cancer.<br><br> An MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] cell viability-based cell adhesion assay was performed to determine Stat3 regulation of the adhesive properties of SRB12-p9 cells (P9WT), a human skin SCC cell line, along with SRB12-p9 cells engineered to have reduced Stat3 activity (S3DN2 and S3DN5). Severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice were injected subcutaneously with P9WT and S3DN cells and tumors were measured twice weekly. Extracted tumors were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting, for expression of the invasion related enzymes, MMP-2 and MMP-9. <br><br> The suppression of Stat3 in S3DN cell lines resulted in a less invasive phenotype. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting indicated higher levels of MMPs in the P9WT cells with expression localization towards the outer perimeter of the tumors. This data suggests that Stat3 does play a role in skin SCC invasion and better understanding of Stat3 function could lead to improved treatment and prevention of the disease.

GLUCOSE UPTAKE INHIBITORS AND T CELL SURVIVAL: A SECOND YEAR STUDY IN AUTOIMMUNITY
Rebecca Joy Vitale
duPont Manual High School, Louisville, KY, United States

Over 50 million Americans suffer from autoimmune diseases. Many of these are caused by T lymphocytes attacking necessary body cells. Previous research has shown that glucose analogs are moderately effective at limiting T cell viability. This study was designed to determine if glucose transport inhibitors are more effective than glucose analogs. Glucose transport inhibitors were hypothesized to be a more effective treatment. Splenocytes of two mice were compared: one (treated with an antigen and natural adjuvant) modeled a normal immune response; the other (treated with only antigen) an abortive response. Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of either cytochalasin B (0-100 µM) or phloretin (0-50 µM), two glucose transport inhibitors. After a 20 hour incubation, viability was analyzed using flow cytometry. Statistical analyses were performed using Student T-tests.<br><br> Treatment with the first compound, cytochalasin B, showed that it does limit the viability of both sets of cells. It also, however, limits the viability of non-activated resting cells to an extent that would be considered dangerous to the health of an organism. The 50 µM concentration of phloretin completely eliminated the survival advantage afforded by adjuvant treatment. The effect on non-activated resting cells was much lower with phloretin, and did not seem to be toxic to the system. In summary, glucose transport inhibitors are much more effective than glucose analogs at limiting T cell viability. With further research, these compounds, especially phloretin, could be explored as a mechanism for T cell inhibition in autoimmune disease.<br><br>

A STUDY OF THE MEDICIANL VALUE OF SYMPHYTUM OFFICINALE (COMFREY ROOT) ON THE GROWTH OF LUMBRICULUS VARIEGATES
Alix Beth Stelly
Catholic High School, New Iberia, Louisiana, USA

This project is a study of the medicinal value of Symphytum officinale (comfrey root) on the growth of Lumbriculus variegates. The purpose was to determine if the topical application of comfrey root to bisected California Blackworms would result in faster growth and to determine if the growth rate would be affected by increasing the concentration of comfrey root applied to California Blackworms. <br><br> An experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that treating regenerating California Blackworms with comfrey root would increase the growth rate. Comfrey root was purchased and made into a tea. 400ml of each solution strength was made. Comfrey tea solution strengths tested were 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25%. 12 worms were cut into 10mm segments for each test group and a control group. Each bisected worm was placed in a petri dish with 25ml of solution. 12 were placed in each prevously stated solution and in 25ml of spring water (the control). The experiment spanned 4 weeks. The worms were measured weekly for growth.<br><br> The results supported the hypothesis. California Blackworms treated with 25% solution had a growth rate measuring 1.91 times longer than the control. Worms in 50% solution grew 2.52 times longer, 75% solution grew 3.31 times longer, and 100% solution grew 4.65 times longer. A statistical analysis consisting of ANOVA and t-Tests showed the results to be significant at p<.001 level. It was concluded that comfrey root does have an effect on the growth of California Blackworms. Furthermore, increasing the concentration caused the worms to grow faster. <br><br> Thus, Symphytum officinale does have medicinal value. Recommendation for further research includes specification of the component (allontoin, etc.)responsibile for prompting the accelerated growth and healing.

SCREENING FOR NOVEL DRUGS TO PREVENT LUNG INFLAMMATION
Christine Ivey Hoyle
Ballard High School, Louisville, KY

The purpose of this project was to find a drug that inhibits lung inflammation. Inflammation is caused by tissue injury or the fighting of infection by white blood cells. However, the white blood cells can attack body cells in their attempts to kill the infection. Although in some cases inflammation can be helpful, with some chronic lung conditions it can make the disease worse. A drug that inhibits inflammation would be very helpful for patients who suffer with inflammatory diseases. A search for inhibitors was done by screening a library of 446 drugs for anti-inflammatory effects. Interleukin 8 (IL-8) was used as a marker of inflammation in this experiment because it is a molecule that signals inflammation in the lungs. The hypothesis was that if a collection of 446 chemicals is tested for inhibition of IL-8 production, then novel inhibitors will be found. Test compounds were added to human lung epithelial cells together with substance P (SP), a neuropeptide that triggers the production of IL-8 in these cells. The amount of IL-8 released into the cell growth media in response to SP treatment was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA). After a series of tests, the hypothesis was supported because 23 compounds were found that reproducibly inhibited IL-8 production yet did not affect cell viability. The drugs were also tested to see if they could inhibit IL-8 induced by another protein, TNF, or if the inhibitory effects were specific to SP. It was found that all of the compounds showed inhibition of TNF, so none were SP specific. A dose response experiment was performed for one of the 23 inhibitors, Triptolide. The IC50 (the concentration at which 50% inhibition would occur) for the inhibition of IL-8 production by Triptolide was 2.3x10-8 M. The 23 drugs that were found could potentially be helpful in treating lung inflammation characteristic of diseases such as asthma, pulmonary fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

GIMME SOME SUGAR! YEAR TWO
Brittany Michelle Roe
Nettleton High School, Jonesboro, AR

The purpose of this experiment involving pears and carrots was to determine how the sugar content of carrots before and after baking compared to pears, after testing the sugar content of apples and knowing that sugar content changes after baking. Organic, conventionally grown carrots, Green Anjou, and Bosc pears were used. The hypothesis was: the sugar content in vegetables will increase after baking, Bosc pears will have greater sugar content than the Green Anjou before and after baking, and organic carrots will contain more sugar than regular.<br><br> The procedure was like last year’s. There were three pears of each type that were juiced with a juicer. Pieces of each pear were baked in the oven at 350º for 30 minutes. The other pieces were juiced. The juice was placed on the Refractometer and viewed using a graph that measured sugar in Brix. All data was recorded. The cooked pears were taken out of the oven and juiced. The experiment continued the same way with each pear and carrots. Both organic and regular carrots had to be placed in the microwave for 45 seconds and then tested. After each reading, the Refractometer was cleaned. After each test object was juiced, baked, and recorded, the experiment concluded.<br><br> The results concluded that sugar content in carrots decreases. Bosc pears had a greater sugar content average than Green Anjou. Organic carrots and the regular carrots scarcely differed in sugar content. Overall, the project was successful, even if the hypothesis was partly incorrect.

INSULIN- REGULATED INTRACELLULAR TRAFFICKING MRNAS IN SKELETAL MUSCLE CELLS
Nina Oiyen Wong
Dr. Michael M. Krop Senior High School, Miami, Florida, United States of America

Insulin regulates the glucose intake of cells by employing membrane vesicles containing GLUT4 glucose transporters from the interior of cells to the cell surface, where they admit glucose into cells by facultative diffusion. This study attempts to determine the molecular mechanisms by which the glucose transporter GLUT4 moves within Rattus norvegicus (rat) L6 skeletal myoblast cells to allow an increased entry of glucose upon insulin stimulation by using microarrays. Cells were grown to confluence in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) containing 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 1% by volume Penicillin-Streptomycin, and 1% Amphotericin-B. At confluence, DMEM media will be supplemented with 2% horse serum instead of FBS to allow for differentiating fusion of cells into myotubes. Comparisons were done between the mRNAs isolated from the cells in serum-free media containing 100nM insulin, and the mRNAs from the cells in the serum-free media vehicle control, after 6 hours. <br><br> Microarray analysis was used to determine if the mRNAs steady-state level corresponding to these genes are regulated by insulin. Results revealed fold changes in the following intracellular trafficking proteins with insulin-responsive mRNAs: ArpBP-2 (+2.15), BIN-1 (+2.3), Caveolin-3 (+2.85), and Kinesin-related protein-1 (-3.15). Real-Time PCR and Western blot analyses are currently being performed. Biological efficiency implies that mRNAs regulated by insulin are important for insulin action. Their trafficking roles may be important in trafficking GLUT4 within the cell. This research holds potential for therapies for type II diabetes, a disease in which cells have a decreased response to insulin stimulation and are starved of energy. <br><br>

CRYSTALLIZATION OF A NOVEL MALARIAL PROTEIN, CELTOS, FOR X-RAY CRYSTAL STRUCTURE DETERMINATION AND ANTI-MALARIAL DEVELOPMENT
Venkat Arunkumar Iyer
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Alexandria, VA

The cell-traversal protein for ookinetes and sporozoites (CelTOS) is a novel malarial protein involved in the movement of the parasite through single-cell epithelial layers of the mosquito gut and the parasite's establishment in the liver of humans. CelTOS is localized to motility organelles called micronemes, which translocate micronemal contents from an apical pore along the surface of the parasitic cell. Research studies have shown that disruption of the CelTOS gene diminished parasite infectivity in mosquitoes and in liver. In order to examine the druggability of CelTOS, it is proposed that the X-ray crystal structure of the protein is elucidated. By determining the structure of CelTOS through X-ray crystallographic techniques, subsequent research can be conducted to aid in the development of anti-malarials that target the mosquito vector as well as humans. In this research study, lyophilized CelTOS was reconstituted, buffer exchanged, and concentrated for crystallization experiments. In preliminary crystallization trials, needle crystals and rectangular prism crystals were grown; however, these crystals were not reproducible. Crystallization efforts for CelTOS will be continued in future studies by varying standard conditions including protein storage buffer conditions, protein concentration, and experimental temperature, and such studies are currently underway.

INVESTIGATION OF AROMATIC ENDOPEROXIDES FOR O2 DELIVERY TO PROMOTE WOUND HEALING
William Gregory Lawler
Northside Health Careers High School, San Antonio, TX

The purpose of this research study was to determine the feasibility of using endoperoxide-forming aromatic compounds such as Rubrene and Di-methyl Napthalene to compose a solid system to generate oxygen at a constant rate according to temperature. This compound could then be integrated into a bio-degradable scaffolding material that might be either inserted into internal wounds to promote healing or integrated into a type of bandage that can be applied with an antibiotic to encourage wound healing on the surface of the body. A dental curing light was used to convert the Rubrene and Di-methyl Naphthalene (used in conjunction with a photosensitizing dye) to its endoperoxide form in an acetone solution, which was evaporated away at the same time. The color of the solution was then measured in a spectrophotometer designed to measure the percent conversion of the endoperoxide. Subsequently, the oxygen output of the solution was determined directly with a fluorescent oxygen probe, which gives an inverse measure of oxygen concentration. In addition, an oxygen concentration probe was used as a direct measure of oxygen release. In conclusion the engineering goals of the experiment were met, with a change in oxygen concentration of about 2-3% obtained from a 2 milligram sample of Rubrene.

NATURAL PLANT ANTIOXIDANTS IN APOPTOSIS OF OVIS ARIES CELLS
Megan Marie Nash
Timber Lake High School, Timber Lake, SD, USA

Free radical production, a natural occurrence in cells, is known to cause various diseases. When allowed to do so, these free radicals cause damage to cell walls, cell structures, and the cell's genetic material, which eventually leads to aging and certain diseases such as cancer.<br><br> Antioxidants are molecules, which can safely interact with free radicals and terminate the chain reaction before vital molecules are damaged. Their job is to prevent the free radicals' attack on the cells. The purpose of my project is to determine if various plant antioxidants reduce the damage inflicted upon the cells by free radicals.<br><br> I introduced a free radical (tBOOH) into ovis aries' white blood cells. Then I distributed the extracted antioxidants into each sample. After periods of incubation, the cells were stained to detect apoptotic and necrotic cells. In order to do this a FACS machine was used. The FACS machine sorts various types of cells such as viable cells, apoptotic cells, and necrotic cells. This information was used to analyze the results to determine the effectiveness of the antioxidants from the native plants. A spectrophotometer was also used to measure the antioxidant activity in each of the samples.<br><br> After experimenting I found that the agastachi root did extremely well in neutralizing the free radicals, while the agastachi leaf and sage performed above average as well. A further study is entirely possible to see if these plants hold promise in finding a solution to various diseases caused by free radicals.

CAN DISTILLATION BE USED AS A METABOLIC QUANTIFIER?
Amber Rose Gardner
Home School, Dayton, TN

The purpose of this investigation was to determine if distillation could be used as a metabolic quantifier. <br><br> It was estimated that 400g of glucose would be burned per day. This rate was based on the Resting Energy Expenditure (REE) of 1,600 calories for minimal activity of an average sized human. <br><br> The distillation apparatus condensed the water from the subject's exhaled air into a collecting flask. By condensing the water from the air that is exhaled by the subject, it was expected that the amount of the water could be measured and then calculated using stoichiometry to find out how many grams of glucose and how many calories were burned in the process.<br><br> The over-all average for 15 minutes of respiration was 2.1 grams of water. After the application of stoichiometry for calculated results, there was 10% error compared to research. However, the most represented group by testing was the teenage group with an average of 2.4 grams, which resulted in 0% error compared to research.<br><br> The evidence suggests that this distillation apparatus can be used to analyze the respiration of an individual. However, since there is variance in data, a more detailed analysis of a person’s precondition may show evidence that dehydration and other aspects may cause significant error.

DETERMINATION OF BINDING ENERGY HOTSPOTS ON A BROADLY NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODY AGAINST HIV-1
Nina Jessica Lu
Montgomery Blair High School, Silver Spring, MD

VRC01 is a recently isolated human monoclonal antibody from an HIV infected patient that is a promising template for anti-HIV therapeutics and vaccines due to its ability to potently neutralize over 90% of HIV-1 strains. Previous crystallographic analysis reveals that VRC01 targets the functionally-conserved CD4-binding site on HIV glycoprotein-120 through thirty-two contact residues. However, the individual contribution of these residues to VRC01’s tight binding remains unknown. Here, I apply a systematic alanine-mutagenesis strategy to evaluate the influence of these residues on overall binding energy of VRC01 to a stabilized HIV gp120 core (RSC3). Nine mutants individually resulted in >30-fold increases in KD and >2kcal/mol changes in Gibbs Free Energy compared to the wild type, forming hotspots of binding energy on the antibody contact interface. Unexpectedly, a single mutation at residue W100B in Complementarity Determining Region 3 (CDRH3) knocked out binding. The same effect was observed when the analogous structural positions on two other VRC01-like antibodies, VRC03 and VRC04, were mutated, highlighting the importance of precise V(D)J recombination in the previously overlooked CDRH3 region in eliciting this class of broadly neutralizing CD4-binding site antibodies. This study identifies a single residue as a major contributor to the binding energy, establishes a hierarchy of significant contact residues and suggests structural mechanisms underlying their contributions. Results have implications on the rational design of potent next-generation anti-HIV therapeutics and vaccines, and provide insight into how scientists can elicit the successful development of this potent and broadly-neutralizing class of VRC01-like antibodies in the human body.

PREVENTING DEGRADATION OF DNA AND CELLS BY RUTILE TITANIUM DIOXIDE NANOPARTICLES, A COMMON SUNSCREEN INGREDIENT
Matthew Samuel Wieder
SAR High School, Riverdale N.Y. 10471, USA

The rutile form of titanium dioxide (TiO2) is an ingredient commonly found in sunscreens because of its ability to reflect UV radiation and thus protect skin from sunburn, aging and some forms of skin cancer. Recently, it has been reported, however, that the very same TiO2 generates hydroxyl radicals in the presence of UV radiation, which can damage or destroy DNA and cells, making its continued use in sunscreens questionable. <br><br> The objective of this study was to assess the extent of damage that photoactivated untreated rutile TiO2 causes to DNA and cells, and to find a way to prevent these adverse effects from occurring. The hypothesis was that a surface modification of the TiO2, including the addition of an antioxidant, would prevent the TiO2 from entering cells and also scavenge any hydroxyl radicals that are produced by irradiation of the TiO2, thus preventing both DNA and cell damage from occurring.<br><br> A surface modified TiO2 nanoparticle with grape seed extract added as an antioxidant, was tested to assess its ability to protect DNA and cells from damage due to exposure to UV rays, without causing damage itself. Results revealed that the surface modified TiO2 was effective in scavenging hydroxyl radicals produced by irradiation of the TiO2, as well as in preventing degradation of DNA and cells due to UV radiation, which is essential to the continued use of TiO2 in sunscreens. <br><br>

MACRO-SCALE TO NANO-SCALE: KINETICS OF THE MYOSIN-ACTIN MOLECULAR BIOMOTOR SYSTEM
Divya Nettimi
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science & Technology, Alexandria, VA, USA

A model for the movement of the myosin biomotor protein is developed and used to determine the rate at which a single myosin molecule moves along an actin filament in the process that drives muscle contraction. An equation for the bulk rate of the myosin-ATP reaction is derived and parameterized using Michaelis-Menten kinetics, experimental data, and a combination of thermodynamic and kinetic quantitative techniques. Then, the stoichiometry of the myosin-ATP reaction is used to establish a relationship between the bulk kinetic rate of the reaction and the nano-scale translational rate of myosin. Converting the macro-scale reaction kinetics into the nano-scale molecule movement reveals that a single myosin molecule moves along an actin filament at 2.5 x 10^7 nanometers/second. Further, it is determined that the muscle contraction reaction is driven primarily by the concentration of myosin rather than ATP, contrary to previous belief. This shows that an increase in food intake to obtain more ATP molecules will not be effective in increasing muscular activity, without the addition of more muscle tissue to produce a higher concentration of myosin in the body. These results provide new insight into how the myosin biomotor drives muscle contraction and controls almost all large-scale biological motion. Furthermore, this research may aid the development of analogous artificial nanosystems since molecular biomotors are examples of natural nano-scale systems that have worked successfully for billions of years.

THE CRYSTALLIZATION OF RIBOSWITCHES: POTENTIAL TARGETS FOR ANTIBIOTICS
Artem Alexander Serganov
The Bronx High School of Science, New York, NY

Alarming expansion of antibiotic resistance necessitates the development of novel classes of antibiotics specific for new sites. Riboswitches, evolutionary conserved RNA elements recently found in mRNAs, control expression of genes essential for microbial viability and, therefore, represent potential targets for novel types of antibiotics. Riboswitches function through highly specific interactions with small metabolites, which range from co-enzymes to nucleobases and amino acids. These natural metabolites could be utilized for the design of novel metabolite-like antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals that are capable of interacting with the three-dimensional structures of riboswitches and shutting down the synthesis of vital proteins. Since crystallization is an obligatory step in determination of three-dimensional structures, extensive trial-and-error crystallization screenings have been performed for two classes of wide-spread riboswitches bound to cellular metabolites S-adenosylmethionine and pre-queuosine-1. The major finding of the crystallization trials, guided by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, was the successful crystallization of both riboswitch-metabolite complexes. RNA modifications and optimizations of crystallization conditions produced crystals of the pre-queuosine-1-riboswitch complex diffracting up to 3.1 Å. This level is sufficient for determination of the high-resolution crystal structure of this riboswitch. Given the atypical secondary structures of the studied riboswitches, the crystal structures may reveal novel riboswitch conformations and modes of metabolite binding that are potentially important for the design of future antimicrobial drugs.

DETERMINATION OF MECHANISM OF ACTION OF ROR2 IN SKELETOGENESIS AND BRACHYDACTYLY
Lingzi Ouyang
Ossining High School, Ossining, NY

Ror2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in skeletogenesis. Mutations in Ror2 give rise to two severe genetic inherited diseases: Dominant Brachydactyly B (BDB) and Recessive Robinow Syndrome (RRS). Previous research in our lab demonstrated that Ror2 interacts with WTIP and Scribble. Interestingly, Vangl2 also interacts with Scribble; however its involvement in Ror2 signaling via Scribble (and WTIP) remains unclear. Using a combination of biochemical techniques, such as Plasmid Transfection, Co-Immunoprecipitation, SDS Polyacrolymide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western Blot analysis, this study attempted to determine whether Vangl2 could interact with proteins in the Ror2 signaling pathway. Ultimately, we will use similar biochemical techniques to search for novel proteins involved in Ror2 signaling. Here, we transfected 293 cells with Ror2, WTIP, Scribble and Vangl2 plasmids. Western Blot analysis confirmed the expression of proteins from the transfected plasmids. Next, using a monoclonal antibody to Ror2, we successfully immunoprecipitated Ror2 and co-immunoprecipitated Vangl2 from HEK293 cell lysates. These results illustrated the interaction between Ror2 and Vangl2. Unexpectedly, this evidence suggested a direct interaction between Ror2 and Vangl2 that is independent of WTIP and Scribble.

GENE THERAPY TRANSFECTION OF R-PLASMIDS UTILIZING POTASSIUM INFUSED LIPOSOMES
Sarah Kathleen Fayad
Piedra Vista High School, Farmington, New Mexico, United States of America

<br><br> This experiment will compare the transfection ability of two liposomes; one composed of phosphatidylcholine (a naturally occurring phospholipid) and one composed of phosphatidylcholine that has been infused with a natural, cationic transfection agent, mineral potassium (K). Each method will be employed alongside multiple controls to determine which is most effective in the transplantation of resistance plasmids (r-plasmids) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa(P. aeruginosa) into non-resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli). It is hypothesized that (1) the potassium infused phosphatidylcholine will be most effective in the transfection of resistance plasmids across E. coli cell membranes that (2) The second most effective method will be the phosphatidylcholine-encapsulated plasmid having neutral charge and that (3) the naked DNA will have the lowest transfection ability. First, the resistance plasmid DNA from cultures of P. aeruginosa is extracted and purified using a mini prep. This purified DNA will be added to cultures of E. coli both naked, and enveloped in lipids. When it is added to the liquid solution of DNA, the liposome will form, engulfing the plasmids. Liposomes composed of phosphatidylcholine alone will be compared in their transfection ability to those infused with mineral potassium. All hypotheses were supported. Most important, however is the great decrease seen in the inhibition zones of the potassium infused liposomes. The transfection ability of these liposomes was 97.861 percent greater than the natural lipid, and more than 100percent of this ability in naked DNA. All results were found to be statistically significant. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

AUTOPHAGIC MEDIATED CELL DEATH IN GLIOBLASTOMAS
Shreya Gundavaram Rao 
Lecanto High School, Lecanto FL, U.S.A

Autophagy plays a critical role in the recycling of amino acids and degradation of intracellular macromolecules. It is important for normal growth control and is involved in various pathological conditions including cancer. However, little is known about its role in tumor development. Because glucose and amino acids are principal physiological regulators of mammalian autophagy, we analyzed the effect of nutrient deprivation on U-87MG human glioblastoma cells. The cell viability, cell death phenotype and caspase-3 activation were analyzed and compared in U-87MG cells treated with serum free medium (control) or nutrient deprived medium (EBSS). Starvation resulted in cell death as demonstrated by lactate dehydrogenase release. Cell death was observed as early as 6hrs after starvation compared to control cells. To determine if starvation leads to autophagic death we used the autofluorescent drug monodansylcadaverine (MDC), a specific autophagolysosme marker. Results show that MDC accumulation was induced in starved cells compared to control and was inhibited by 3-methlyadenine, a classical inhibitor of the autophagic pathway. Furthermore, autophagic vacuoles were labeled with LC-3, one of the mammalian homologues of the yeast protein that plays an important role in autophagosome formation. Western blot analysis showed a shift of LC-3 band 12hrs after starvation from monoautophagic, cytosolic (LC3-I) form to membrane associated LC3-II form. These results strongly suggest that nutrient deprivation results in autophagic death. Our results also indicate that nutrient deprivation mediated death is caspase independent. The data suggests that nutrient deprivation autophagic cell death may be effective therapy for inhibition of malignant brain tumors.

ASSESSING THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH P2Y1-RECEPTOR STIMULATION OF ASTROCYTES AS A TREATMENT FOR STROKE
Carolina D. Lopez-Trevino
John Jay Science & Engineering Academy, San Antonio, TX

Stroke is the third leading cause of death in America and a leading cause of adult disability. Stroke is characterized by clogged blood vessels in the brain, which inhibits blood and nutrient flow to cells. Current treatments for stroke fail to address damaged tissue recovery. Stimulation of the P2Y1-Purinergic receptor in astrocytes is an innovative treatment for stroke being researched that reduces the size of the lesion caused by stroke. ATP production is increased, which in turn increases the rate at which astrocytes replicate. This treatment is currently being explored in mice by researchers. The implications of tissue recovery suggest potential for rehabilitation after injuries to the brain. However, the effects of the P2Y1-Receptor agonist, 2meSADP, on other potential cell types present in the brain has not been explored.<br><br>This experiment investigated the safety of P2Y1-Receptor stimulation on Glioma cancer cell growth, which models tumor growth. It was hypothesized that ligand 2meSADP would increase Glioma cell replication rate and colony formation. Glioma cancer cells were cultured and treated with 100uM 2meSADP for either two hours (acute) or seven days (chronic), thereafter cell growth and anchorage independence assays were performed. Results indicated that the addition of 2meSADP to the media of the Glioma cancer cells, increased the replication rate and colony formation. In conclusion, the hypotheses were accepted, which indicates that when treated with 2meSADP the Glioma tumor may be enhanced. This research can be applied to medical sciences by contributing to the development of side effects or hazards associated with P2Y1-Receptor stimulation as a treatment for stroke.

AN INVESTIGATION OF FLAVONOID EXTRACTION FROM SUGAR BEETS AND SOYBEANS ON NON-SMALL LUNG CANCER
Candace Dayle Rastedt
Perham High School, Perham, MN

Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States and the world. The National Cancer Institute reports that in 2010 there were 222,520 new cases of lung cancer and 157,300 deaths due to both non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer. Over 80% of primary lung cancers are NSCLC and while there are a number of clinical trials focused on this disease, there remains less than a 10% five-year survival rate for patients with NSCLC. In fruits and vegetables, flavonoids are substances that have various and valuable biochemical and antioxidant effects. A flavonoid is a polyphonic compound that is found in nature, which has probable natural benefits. The purpose of this project was to treat the non-small cell lung cancer cell line, H1299 with sugar beet and soybean flavonoid extracts, to determine the effects on cell growth, morphology, and cellular viability. It was hypothesized that both of the extractions would reduce cellular growth and change cellular morphology due to the antioxidant properties of flavonoids. With the treatment of flavonoids from both sugar beets and soybeans, cellular growth significantly reduced as concentration of flavonoid increased. In both cases cell number and confluency decreased when compared to the controls after being treated for 48 hours. Furthermore, the live dead assay established cellular viability was maintained with the addition of the flavonoids extracts. This research shows a potential method which flavonoids can be extracted from soybeans and sugar beets, to help reduce the growth of cancer cells.

NOVEL POLYMERIC NANOPARTICLES AS CARRIER FOR CURCUMIN IN CHEMOTHERAPY OF NEUROBLASTOMA
Sulabh S. Singhal
Arlington High School, Arlington, TX

Purpose: To develop novel nanoparticulate drug formulation, we assessed the efficacy of curcumin encapsulating PLGA nanoparticles in neuroblastomas. <br><br>Procedures: The nanoparticle size and cellular uptake were determined by dynamic light scattering and confocal microscopy respectively. Cell survival was performed by MTT assay. Cell cycle analysis was demonstrated by Flow cytometry. The expressions of proteins were measured by Western blot. <br><br>Results: Cell uptake studies revealed that nanocurcumin (curcumin encapsulating PLGA nanoparticles) are efficiently taken up by neuroblastoma cells and are predominantly distributed in the cells 120 min post-treatment compared to control curcumin alone treatment groups. Nanocurcumin formulation was more effective than curcumin alone in decreasing the survival of neuroblastoma cells. Nanocurcumin caused G0/G1 cell cycle arrest to a greater extent compared to curcumin at similar doses. Nanocurcumin was more effective in inhibiting mitochondrial permeability transition, in decreasing the levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl2 and increasing the expression of pro-apoptotic Bax proteins. This collectively reflects superior efficacy of nanocurcumin formulation in inducing apoptosis compared to curcumin treatment alone. <br><br>Conclusions: The development and validation of targeted (sustained) drug delivery methods for flavonoids like curcumin will facilitate to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy in cancer. This system could be translated in childhood tumors like neuroblastomas, where the use of safe and effective compounds like curcumin can have potential clinical benefits.

Insulin and MIS are hormones that affect steroid production. MIS has been shown to decrease steroid synthesis while insulin has been shown to increase steroid expression. StAR is a protein that aids in the transport of cholesterol into the mitochondria where it is transformed into steroids. This experiment tests to see if these two hormones work through the StAR pathway to influence steroid production. It was hypothesized that: 1) MIS will inhibit StAR expression; 2) insulin will enhance it; and 3) when the hormones are used together, they will prevent one another’s effects. <br><br>In order to test these hypotheses, MA-10 cells were cultured on 96-well plates and, on the third day of culture, co-incubated with either insulin, MIS, or insulin and MIS. The cells were harvested, the RNA was converted into cDNA through reverse transcription, and then the cDNA was amplified through a polymerase chain reaction. The results were analyzed with ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni test.<br><br> The insulin, as predicted, increased StAR production 3.71-fold plus or minus 0.5. MIS had no significant effect on StAR production, which was not hypothesized. When the cells were treated with both MIS and insulin, the two substances inhibited one another’s effects. While there was no significant change in StAR production in comparison with control, there was a significant change compared with insulin alone, which proves that MIS did change insulin’s effect. These data provide a foundation for further research that could lead to the investigation of new treatments for people afflicted with steroid-related conditions.<br><br>

STRUCTURAL STUDIES OF THE INACTIVE FORM OF INDOLEAMINE 2,3-DIOXYGENASE
Ling Zhang
The Nightingale-Bamford School, New York, New York 

Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is a hemoprotein, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of L-Tryptophan metabolism. It plays an important role in immune responses to pathogen and cancer invasions during pathological conditions and fetal tolerance during pregnancy. Since IDO expression leads to the depletion of the essential amino acid, L-Tryptophan, and the production of cytotoxic metabolites, the activity of IDO has to be well-regulated. Accordingly, IDO was produced as an inactive form in several cell types, although it remains unclear as to how it is reactivated. Despite its importance, no structural information is available for this inactive form of IDO. The main goal of my research is to investigate this inactive derivative of IDO with spectroscopic methods. <br><br>IDO possesses a heme group with an iron in the center, where O2 is bound and inserted into Trp. Under certain conditions, instead of O2, an amino acid residue of the protein, possibly a Cysteine may coordinate to the heme iron to form a mis-coordinated species. I postulated that it’s the Cysteine mis-coordination that converts IDO to its inactive form in vivo. I sought to examine the energy required for the conversion by systematically perturbing its structure with a denaturant, Guanidine Hydrochloride, and identify the Cysteine residue by site-directed mutagenesis. I concluded that (1) it requires only 3 kcal/mol energy for IDO to convert to the mis-coordinated form; (2) the conversion is reversible and can be inhibited by the substrate, L-Tryptophan; and (3) a Cysteine residue, other than Cysteine-129, is responsible for the mis-coordination.

I concluded that (1) it requires only 3 kcal/mol energy for IDO to convert to the mis-coordinated form; (2) the conversion is reversible and can be inhibited by the substrate, L-Tryptophan; and (3) a Cysteine residue, other than Cysteine-129, is responsible for the mis-coordination.

MINING ACTIVE NATURAL PRODUCTS AND POTENTIAL MEDICINAL PLANTS BY USING MOLECULAR POSITIONING SYSTEM
Yuxi Jiang
No.2 High School Attached to East China Normal University, Shanghai, CHINA

Discovering active natural products and medicinal plants is of most significance for human health, but it is a formidable task to the present methods and technologies. In this study, I developed an intelligent discovery technology called molecular positioning system (MPS) by combing molecular similarity search, natural product chemistry and bioassay. MPS is much more effective than the traditional approaches (e.g. extraction + random screening) in identifying active natural products and potential medicinal plants. By employing MPS, I took the anti-lung cancer drug Iressa(TM<br><br>) as the template molecule to search two natural product databases containing thousands of compounds and identified 27 natural products with similar structures to Iressa. Notably, 6 natural products were proven by enzymatic assays to have potent inhibitory activities against the lung cancer target c-Met. The most prominent compound could inhibit c-Met with an IC50 value of 91.4 nM. Meanwhile, all the alcohol extractions of the five medicinal plants containing these active compounds also showed inhibitory activities against c-Met. Remarkably, for the first time, I found that Premna microphylla Turcz has anti-cancer effect and its alcohol extraction of 0.25 mg/mL could inhibit c-Met with an inhibitory ratio of 80.7%. Moreover, this plant has been used as traditional medicine in treating other diseases and as food in China, thus it is safe enough and worth to be developed further. Guided by MPS, I only tested five plants rather than thousands of plants and discovered a new potential medicinal plant. All these results demonstrated that MPS is an effective method in discovering natural medicines and can be widely applicable in discovering new medicinal plants based on the knowledge of existing drugs.

DOES CELL PHONE RADIATION AFFECT THE METABOLIC RATE OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER?
Zachary Carter Strickland
Christian Academy of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky, United States

The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether cell phone radiation would affect the metabolic rate of Drosophila melanogaster. Twenty Drosophila of each sex (male and female) were placed in four vials with nutrient rich food. Two vials were used as the control groups and the other two vials were attached to a cell phone that was turned on for the entire time. The experimental vials were exposed to cell phone radiation 24 hours per day for 15 days. The Drosophila were anesthetized and placed in a Warburg apparatus to measure oxygen consumption. Numbers from this measurement were then used to calculate the metabolic rate. This experiment was repeated two more times for a total of three growth periods.<br><br> The results showed that the Drosophila that were exposed to the cell phone radiation had an average change in metabolic rate of 11.63% higher for males and 14.13% higher for females at the end of the 15-day period. Therefore, the experimental group had an average metabolic rate change 12.88% higher than the control group. The results showed that cell phone radiation does affect the metabolic rate of Drosophila melanogater.

EFFECTS OF UV IRRADIATION ON EMBRYONIC LETHALITY IN C. ELEGANS JUN-1 AND XPF-1 DELETION MUTANT WORMS
Carissa Janine Pekny
West Lafayette Junior-Senior High School, West Lafayette, IN

C. elegans is a free-living nematode that resides in many temperate climates. Though C. elegans only measures about 1mm long, it is used as a model organism because its entire genome is mapped and it contains proteins homologous to that of humans and other organisms. The purpose of this experiment is to measure how many eggs are affected by UV light that don't have jun-1 or xpf-1--two genes that code for their respective proteins and help lessen harmful effects of UV light in worms as well as humans. Three young adult C. elegans worms with jun-1 deletion, xpf-1 deletion, and jun-1 deletion fed xpf-1 RNAi were subjected to 0J/m², 60J/m², and 120J/m² of UV light and allowed to lay eggs on 2 sets of plates, one from 0-8 hours after UV exposure and one from 8-24 hours after UV exposure. Embryonic lethality rates were higher in the 0-8 hour time frame than in the 8-24 hour time frame. This could indicate involvement of cep-1 (a protein regulating apoptosis) to weed out damaged eggs that would be laid in the 8-24 hour time frame. There was more survival in the jun-1 deletion worms fed xpf-1 RNAi than in the xpf-1 deletion worms in higher doses of UV in the 0-8 hour time frame, possibly due to xpf-1 and not jun-1. Experiments like this can help shed light onto functions of proteins that help repair UV damage in C. elegans as well as functions of their protein homologues in humans.

THE EFFECTS OF BIOPOLISHING AND DYE ADHESION ON WOOL
Kimberly Nicole Braulick
St. Mary's High School, Sleepy Eye, Minnesota, United States of America

The purpose of this project is to learn how biopolishing affects the wool fiber and its ability to dye. I chose this project because I wanted to expand my knowledge of wool and how it is being improved and upgraded. I also raise lambs and I wanted to learn more about wool and the woolen industry.<br><br> Safety precautions need to be taken before starting. Biopolishing involves two treatments which include a bleaching process and an enzyme treatment. First, wash the wool in the pretreatment and rinse it in cold water. Next, agitate the wool for thirty minutes in the enzyme. Rinse the wool in delicate fabric wash and allow it to dry. Dye the wool and compare the color intensity, texture, and mass of the wool fibers. Finally, properly dispose of all chemicals.<br><br> Biopolishing shows a great difference when comparing the raw wool fiber to the pretreated wool and finally to the biopolished wool. The microscopic photographs show the scales slowly being removed throughout the process. Biopolishing makes the wool feel smooth without taking away from any of the positive aspects of wool such as its ability to be fire resistant. This experiment also shows that biopolishing allows the fiber to dye with greater color intensity. <br><br> In fact, organizations are very interested in biopolished material. Biopolished woolen material is used for underwear to prevent exposure to high temperatures and fire. Wool has not been used prior to this due to its itchy fibers that can now be removed.

A DIET SUPPLEMENTED WITH BETA-CAROTENE INCREASES CHOLESTEROL LEVEL IN CHICKEN EGGS
Antonia Leigh Busch
Hillsdale Academy, Hillsdale, MI

In recent years, cholesterol has been proven to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and the possibility of suffering a heart attack or stroke. A diet that is high in cholesterol can greatly increase one’s chances of suffering these consequences later in life. Eggs are one of the most common foods that are high in cholesterol. If one has more than one egg per day, the chances of having high cholesterol increases. One of the foods that can counteract cholesterol in humans is a naturally occurring carotenoid called beta-carotene. In this project, it was tested whether or not chickens put on a diet supplemented with beta-carotene would lay eggs that had lower cholesterol. Eggs from chickens on a normal diet were tested for the level of cholesterol present in them. Then, the chickens’ diet was supplemented with beta-carotene and this set of eggs was tested for the level of cholesterol. It was shown in the results that beta-carotene increased the level of cholesterol in the eggs instead of reducing it, as happened in the study of humans. Therefore, it was concluded that it is not beneficial to eat eggs from chickens that have been fed beta-carotene; however, it presented a new question of whether or not the level of cholesterol in chickens’ bodies had been reduced.

EFFECTS OF VITAMIN C ON HELIANTHIS ANNUUS: A POSSIBLE TREATMENT FOR CROWN GALL DISEASE
Naiya Patel
Melbourne High School, Melbourne, FL

The purpose of this experiment is to investigate the effects of Vitamin C on Helianthus annuus as a treatment for crown gall disease, which is caused by Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Vitamin C was chosen as a treatment because it serves an important role in photosynthesis as an electron donor, in defense against oxidative stress as an antioxidant, as well as in cell division and expansion. <br><br>To assess the effect of Vitamin C, sunflowers, grown hydroponically, were administered vitamin C weekly. The effect of Vitamin C was evaluated through photosynthetic rate, root length and cell structure observations. <br><br>The rate of photosynthesis will be measured by a spectrophotometer through the loss of color by DPIP. Vitamin C showed no significant effect (p>0.05). For the length of the main taproot, Vitamin C significantly increased the length (p<0.05) Cell walls in the experimental group were observed to be thicker than that of the control (p<0.05). <br><br>Though additional research is necessary on the effects of Vitamin C on photosynthetic rates, this research suggests that weekly supplements of Vitamin C could be used as an effective treatment for crown gall disease.

THE EFFECT OF ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION ON SCYTONEMIN IN CYANOBACTERIA PART II
Zachary Sherman Truman
Roanoke Valley Governor's School for Science and Technology, Roanoke, VA

The purpose of this experiment was to examine which environmental conditions produce oxidized and reduced scytonemin. Scytonemin is the sheath protective pigment for cyanobacteria. This pigment, scytonemin protects the cell from various types of UV radiation. The two groups of cyanobacteria being tested consisted of Anabaena variabilis and Nostoc punctiforme. After the cyanobacteria were exposed to UV radiation for three months they were placed inside of separate growing conditions. These conditions consisted of light aerobic, light anaerobic, dark aerobic, and dark anaerobic. The hypothesis formulated for this experiment was that the scytonemin would be reduced under dark anaerobic conditions. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that the scytonemin would be oxidized under the light aerobic conditions. <br><br> In this experiment, the various growing conditions served as the independent variable, whereas whether the scytonemin was oxidized or reduced was the dependent variable. Anabaena variabilis served as the control group because it tested positive for scytonemin production. <br><br> A combination of MALDI TOF-TOF (Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight) and TLC (Thin Layer Chromatography) was used in order to test whether the scytonemin had been oxidized or reduced. The results of TLC were compared to each other in order to test which conditions caused oxidation and reduction.<br><br> The data for the different post UV radiation environments it was found that both light aerobic and light anaerobic conditions produced oxidized scytonemin, whereas the dark aerobic and dark anaerobic conditions caused reduced scytonemin. This led the researcher to believe that under dark conditions, where photosynthesis can not take place, scytonemin could be the final electron acceptor.

COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS OF SPECIFIC MISSENSE MUTATIONS IN THE SMN TUDOR DOMAIN
Dianna Hu
Half Hollow Hills High School West, Dix Hills, NY

The neuromuscular disease Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is the most common genetic cause of infant mortality, resulting from mutations in the Survival of Motor Neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. The SMN1 gene encodes for SMN protein, a crucial component in uridine-rich small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U snRNP) assembly that functions in spliceosomal removal of introns from pre-mRNA. The SMN Tudor domain, a highly conserved motif of approximately fifty residues, binds Sm proteins to form the U snRNP core. Certain SMA-causing missense mutations are known to severely reduce this binding interaction, but exact mechanistic details remain unclear. Thorough equilibrations of both the wild-type and several pathogenic mutants were completed via molecular dynamics simulations to provide atomic insight into the behavior of the Tudor domain and the structural discrepancies resulting from implementation of the missense mutations. Although energies stabilized and root mean square deviation (RSMD) remained relatively low for all equilibrations, analysis of several peaks in the RMSD graphs revealed distortions of loop regions at moments of high RMSD, which were compensated through modification of structural topology. Extension of the subsequent simulations for these converged structures could possibly introduce a dynamic mechanism concerning the Tudor deficiency that causes SMA.

INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR I MEDIATED CELL PROLIFERATION VIA THE INSULIN RECEPTOR
Laila Areen Wahedi
School of Science and Tech, Beaverton OR, USA

The Insulin Receptor (IR) acts through two cell transduction pathways, the MAPK pathway and PI3K pathway. It was recently shown that Insulin-like Growth Factor I (IGF-I) acts on the IR.<br><br>To determine which pathway was being utilized for what, growth was measured while cells were treated with physiological levels of IGF-I or Insulin and different components to either pathway were inhibited. Cells were mouse fibroblasts lacking IGF-IR, IGF-IIR, and expressing human IR. UO126 inhibited Mek in the MAPK pathway, Wortmannin inhibited PI3K, and Rapamycin inhibited mTOR, previously believed to be in the PI3K pathway. In most experiments, Rapamycin inhibited behaviors as UO126 inhibited. It is possible that mTOR is more closely associated with the MAPK pathway. Growth was measured at 0 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours. Death was measured at 0 hours and 48 hours. Proliferation was measured at 48 hours. The mitogenic actions of insulin are found to be through the MAPK pathway. IGF-I stimulates growth through both pathways. Proliferation is promoted via the MAPK pathway, and cell survival is promoted via the PI3K pathway.

A NOVEL MEANS OF STABILIZING THE HUMAN ESTROGEN RECEPTOR DURING INDUCTION IN A YEAST EXPRESSION SYSTEM
Sheena Marie Hayes
Eastern High School, Pekin, Indiana, USA

The purpose of this project was to determine any correlation between a compound’s chemical structure and its effect on the growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the binding capacity of the compound to the human estrogen receptor alpha (rhER alpha), the affinity of the compound to the receptor, and the molecular weight of the rhER alpha after inoculation with an estrogen mimic. It was hypothesized that if yeast cells containing the rhER alpha were incubated with specific estrogen mimics with similar chemical structures, then a correlation would be shown between the similar chemical structures and the growth of the yeast cells, the binding capacity and affinity of the compound to the rhER alpha, and the molecular weight of the receptor. Estrogen mimics were chosen based on similar chemical structures (tamoxifen and 4hydroxytamoxifen, alpha-zearalanol and beta-zearalanol) using a naturally occurring female estrogen as a control (estrone). The estrogen mimics were added to yeast cultures containing the rhER alpha. The growth of the yeast was unaffected by the addition of the estrogen mimics. A titration assay (not performed by the student) revealed that tamoxifen and beta-zearalanol increased the binding capacities of the radioactive isotopes compared to the control. 4-hydroxytamoxifen, estrone, and alpha-zearalanol decreased the binding capacities of the isotopes, possibly stabilizing the estrogen receptor, as revealed by the low binding capacities and the Western Blot assay. The molecular weight of the extracts was unaltered by the estrogen mimics; however, the intensity was altered. ANOVA showed the binding capacities to be significant. Based on the data collected, the hypothesis was not supported.

A STUDY ON THE NEUROPROTECTIVE PROPERTIES OF EPIGALLOCATECHIN-3-GALLATE (EGCG) IN RELATION TO P25-ACTIVATED CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE 5 (CDK5): IMPLICATIONS FOR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
Shivani Brinda Agarwal
Spring Valley High School, Columbia, SC

Accumulating evidence has shown that the main constituent of green tea may inhibit the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is a complex molecule that has antioxidant and iron-chelating properties. Previous research conducted by the researcher showed that EGCG was able to protect cos-7 kidney cells from cell death induced by p25-activated cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), which is highly associated with Alzheimer's disease. The purpose of the current study was to determine first whether EGCG when applied at the time of transfection blocked transient lipid-mediated transfection or expression. This was tested by using the calcium phosphate transfection method. The cos-7 cells that were transfected using the calcium-phosphate method and were treated with 10 μM EGCG at that time as well were able to express eGFP along with the other DNA. The purpose of the second part of the study was to determine which property of EGCG caused it to be protective when applied after transfection. It was then hypothesized that EGCG was protective in this system due to a combination of its antioxidant and iron-chelating properties. This hypothesis was tested with an MTT cell proliferation assay on cells that were expressing the p25-Cdk5 pathway and were either treated with 10 μM EGCG, 10 μM epigallocatechin (EGC), 1 μM desferrioxamine mesylate (DFO), or 10 μM EGC with 1 μM DFO. The one-way ANOVA test and the several Tukey tests conducted on the data supported the hypothesis, for the healthiest cells were those treated with EGCG, but those that were treated with EGC and DFO together were the only other cells that were statistically equally healthy.

Mould propagation is a disgusting problem in our daily life. The purpose of this project is to find out a natural material that can combat mould effectively.<br><br> With reference to the literature of the Ancient Chinese Herbal Medicine, garlic, gingko and cinnamon were chosen as samples for the tests of mould inhibition. In the experiment different concentrations of the samples¡¦ extracts were mixed with the agar in sterilized and standardized conditions and then streak-cultures of yeast were applied on to the agar plates respectively. A control experiment was also performed. The time duration measured in days for the commencement of the mould growth on each sample was recorded. Also, a similar experiment was conducted by using bread mould as the fungous source instead of yeast.<br><br> The results of the experiment showed that cinnamon is the most powerful inhibitor for both bread mould and yeast. Garlic has a weak inhibiting power and gingko does not show inhibition at all. Finally the quantities of the active ingredients (cinnamic acid and cinnamic aldehyde) in cinnamon were also found by the method of High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). <br><br> These results led to two methods for making environment-friendly mould retardants in DIY approach. These are anti-mould wax coating and anti-mould PVOH film. Initial tests on the products show that they can protect household items from mould for a long period. Moreover, the process of making the product is easy and price is not expensive. Marketability is high.<br><br>

THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH: A NEW AGE OF PLANTS
Justin Andrew Townley
Okaloosa-Walton Community College Collegiate High School, Niceville, Florida,USA

Antioxidants have been noted to reduce the free radicals that affect aging. Slowing the aging process would provide for an extended productivity time for plants. The antioxidants Alpha Lipoic, Bilberry, Zinc, Glutathione and a combination of Glutathione and Vitamin E were applied to pinto bean plants. To measure the effects of these anti-oxidants on the plants, the pH was periodically measured to see if they were continuing to stay away from the pH of a dead leaf. Dead leaves have a range of ph 6.3 to 6.5, where living leaves range from 5.74 to 6.09. The visual observations also indicated the mixture of the Glutathione and Vitamin E were most effective on the plants as compared to the other anti-oxidants, yet pH testing indicates that all the anti-oxidants were effective on slowing the aging rate.

THE EFFECTS OF ABETA ON NEURONAL RECEPTORS IN THE BRAIN
Eleanor Meaghan Reilly
Saint Francis Preparatory School, Fresh Meadows, NY

Abeta, a neurotoxic plaque, accumulates in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and interferes with synaptic transmission. Spines, protrusions off the sides of neurons that change shape as memories are stored, are limited when Abeta is present. This study found fewer spines in transgenic neurons when compared with wild-type. Glycine, a neurotransmitter found to prompt synaptic activity was tested in the transgenic model to see if this glycine-induced neuronal activity could increase spine changes in the presence of Abeta. The results showed that glycine recovers spine changes in the transgenic model, suggesting that AD patients could recover brain function. Here, AMPA receptors, neuronal receptors in the brain, were shown to colocalize with Abeta, suggesting that the two are directly related. Both AMPA receptors and proteins necessary for spine morphological changes are trafficked through the recycling endosomes and depleted in the presence of Abeta. This suggests the possibility that Abeta inhibits recycling endosomal action. However, when Abeta stimulated neurons were compared with stimulated neurons treated with an endosomal inhibitor, the results were different, suggesting Abeta does not directly inhibit recycling endosomes. Next, the multivesicular body portion of the late endosomal/lysosomal system was examined, and found to colocalize with Abeta and AMPA receptors. This shows that the three are directly interrelated, suggesting that Abeta interferes with the degradative pathway and the proteins that aren’t degraded in turn interrupt the action of the recycling endosomes. This study proposes a novel mechanism which accounts for the depletion of AMPARs and spine proteins at the plasma membrane.

PREVENTING AMYLOID AGGREGATION WITH OSMOLYTES IN VITRO AND IN VIVO
Luis Lafer-Sousa
Keystone School, San Antonio, Texas, U.S.A.

Certain neurodegenerative diseases, such as ALS, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's, are on the rise. These are all caused by a similar mechanism, amyloid aggregation. Amyloid aggregates (prions) are massive clumps of deadly Beta-sheet proteins. Certain osmolytes are naturally synthesized to stabilize proteins. Last year, some of these osmolytes were used to inhibit aggregation in two model proteins. The purpose of the study this year was to use these to inhibit amyloid aggregation. The aim was to use these to inhibit SOD (Superoxide Dismutase) amyloid aggregation, the protein responsible for Familial ALS. The conditions under which SOD formed amyloid aggregates were first determined The protein was then set-up with the addition of all the osmolytes being studied. The experiment was analyzed, and repeated using the most successful osmolytes at varying concentrations. The study also involved the study of aggregation in E. coli. E. coli were heat shocked to induce aggregation, with and without the presence of the osmolytes, and then plated to see the effects. The researcher then lysed open the E. coli and used SDS Gel Electrophoresis to determine if the osmolytes were in fact inhibiting aggregation in the E. coli. The results indicated that TMAO and Glycerol were effective inhibitors of SOD aggregation, even at lower concentrations. TMAO and Trehalose were able to severely reduce E. coli death due to heat shock by inhibiting aggregation in the cell. In conclusion, this research suggests that TMAO or Trehalose could potentially be developed into treatments for these diseases, with much more research.

THE EFFECT OF NATURAL ANTIOXIDANTS ON LONGEVITY AND OXIDATIVE STRESS RESPONSE IN GENETICALLY SUPPRESSED C. ELEGANS
Jasdeep Singh Mangat
Keystone School, San Antonio Texas, United States

According to the free radical theory of aging, oxidative free radicals and decreased antioxidant levels represent one of the major causes of shortened lifespan in aerobic organisms. However, the effects of oxidative stress can be countered naturally by the production of cellular proteins or antioxidant intake, which enhances an organism’s defenses against free radicals. This project’s purpose is to determine whether or not natural antioxidants, Vitamin E and Beta-carotene, can effectively supplement the protein products and extend the lifespan of genetically suppressed Caenorhabditis elegans under the stressed conditions of a hyperoxic environment. Groups of C. elegans were subjected to different combinations of the following three variables: a hyperoxic environment of 88.8% oxygen, different natural antioxidants, and a sod-2 suppressing plasmid. It is predicted that, in a hyperoxic environment, C. elegans which are given antioxidants and a sod-2 suppressing gene will experience an extended lifespan. Worms in a control environment, exposed to the Vitamin-E antioxidant and the sod-2 plasmid, had the longest lifespan of 24.4 days. The results, including the electrophoresis gels, proved that antioxidants effectively supplemented the stress proteins produced by the sod-2 gene. Antioxidant administration on C. elegans could be a method of decreasing the chances of age-related diseases like cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Gene suppression in humans could also prove a valuable agent of life extension because, when a specific gene is suppressed, it no longer translates proteins, thus saving energy for the body to use elsewhere and increasing lifespan.

THE EFFECT OF NATURAL ANTIOXIDANTS ON LONGEVITY AND OXIDATIVE STRESS RESPONSE IN GENETICALLY SUPPRESSED C. ELEGANS
Jasdeep Singh Mangat
Keystone School, San Antonio Texas, United States

According to the free radical theory of aging, oxidative free radicals and decreased antioxidant levels represent one of the major causes of shortened lifespan in aerobic organisms. However, the effects of oxidative stress can be countered naturally by the production of cellular proteins or antioxidant intake, which enhances an organism’s defenses against free radicals. This project’s purpose is to determine whether or not natural antioxidants, Vitamin E and Beta-carotene, can effectively supplement the protein products and extend the lifespan of genetically suppressed Caenorhabditis elegans under the stressed conditions of a hyperoxic environment. Groups of C. elegans were subjected to different combinations of the following three variables: a hyperoxic environment of 88.8% oxygen, different natural antioxidants, and a sod-2 suppressing plasmid. It is predicted that, in a hyperoxic environment, C. elegans which are given antioxidants and a sod-2 suppressing gene will experience an extended lifespan. Worms in a control environment, exposed to the Vitamin-E antioxidant and the sod-2 plasmid, had the longest lifespan of 24.4 days. The results, including the electrophoresis gels, proved that antioxidants effectively supplemented the stress proteins produced by the sod-2 gene. Antioxidant administration on C. elegans could be a method of decreasing the chances of age-related diseases like cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Gene suppression in humans could also prove a valuable agent of life extension because, when a specific gene is suppressed, it no longer translates proteins, thus saving energy for the body to use elsewhere and increasing lifespan.

PREVENTING AMYLOID AGGREGATION WITH OSMOLYTES IN VITRO AND IN VIVO
Luis Lafer-Sousa
Keystone School, San Antonio, Texas, U.S.A.

Certain neurodegenerative diseases, such as ALS, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's, are on the rise. These are all caused by a similar mechanism, amyloid aggregation. Amyloid aggregates (prions) are massive clumps of deadly Beta-sheet proteins. Certain osmolytes are naturally synthesized to stabilize proteins. Last year, some of these osmolytes were used to inhibit aggregation in two model proteins. The purpose of the study this year was to use these to inhibit amyloid aggregation. The aim was to use these to inhibit SOD (Superoxide Dismutase) amyloid aggregation, the protein responsible for Familial ALS. The conditions under which SOD formed amyloid aggregates were first determined The protein was then set-up with the addition of all the osmolytes being studied. The experiment was analyzed, and repeated using the most successful osmolytes at varying concentrations. The study also involved the study of aggregation in E. coli. E. coli were heat shocked to induce aggregation, with and without the presence of the osmolytes, and then plated to see the effects. The researcher then lysed open the E. coli and used SDS Gel Electrophoresis to determine if the osmolytes were in fact inhibiting aggregation in the E. coli. The results indicated that TMAO and Glycerol were effective inhibitors of SOD aggregation, even at lower concentrations. TMAO and Trehalose were able to severely reduce E. coli death due to heat shock by inhibiting aggregation in the cell. In conclusion, this research suggests that TMAO or Trehalose could potentially be developed into treatments for these diseases, with much more research.

ALL-ATOM MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS OF STAPLED P53/HDM2 INTERACTIONS: MODELING A NOVEL CANCER THERAPEUTIC AGENT
Jan Gong
Garden City High School, Garden City, NY

An important tumor suppressor, p53 plays a critical role in regulating the cell cycle. One of its inhibitors, hDM2, is overexpressed in a majority of cancers; an hDM2 inhibitor could suppress tumors by inducing apoptosis. The stapled p53 peptide SAH-p53-8 kills cancer cells through hDM2 inhibition. However, the conformation and stability of SAH-p53-8 bound to hDM2 remain poorly understood. Here we investigated the conformation of both wild type p53 and SAH-p53-8 using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. We found that the helicity of SAH-p53-8 in the bound state was 21% higher than that of wild type p53. In the unbound states, the helicity of the SAH-p53-8 was more than 10-fold, 7-fold, and 3-fold higher than that of wild type p53 at 300 K, 305 K, and 310 K, respectively. This increased helicity suggests that SAH-p53-8 has a higher binding affinity to hDM2 than wild type p53 does. In addition, the probability of native contacts was greater in SAH-p53-8 than in wild type p53, further indicating that SAH-p53-8 is more stable than wild type p53. These findings demonstrate that SAH-p53-8 is a potential cancer therapeutic and offer us new insight into the development of effective targeted treatments for human cancers.

THE EFFECT OF TYRAMINE ON AMYLOID-BETA PLAQUE LEVELS IN CAENORHABDITIS ELEGANS
Katherine Rita Kamis
Loudoun County Academy of Science, Sterling, VA

Alzheimer’s disease is a degenerative disorder that attacks the brain’s neurons. It causes behavioral changes and loss of memory, thinking, and language skills. One characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease is the buildup of amyloid-beta plaque within the brain. A study by Heneka et al. concluded that increasing norepinephrine levels enhances amyloid-beta plaque phagocytosis. Tyramine, a trace amine found in the nervous systems of many animals, is known to release norepinephrine, synthesize the invertebrate analog of norepinephrine, octopamine, and inhibit the β-site amyloid precursor protein cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE-1) . Therefore, increasing the concentration of tyramine should decrease the level of amyloid-beta plaque. Experiments were conducted in Caenorhabditis elegans strain CL2006, a model system for Alzheimer’s disease. The strain CL2006 expresses the human amyloid-beta peptide, which causes amyloid-beta plaque accumulation in the worm’s body wall muscle cells. CL2006 worms were exposed to approximately zero, three, and six percent tyramine solution for four days. The amount of amyloid-beta plaque was assayed by staining the worms with Thioflavin S, a fluorescent dye that binds to amyloid-beta plaque. The amount of amyloid-beta plaque was quantified in a ratio of fluorescence area to the total area of the worm. Worms exposed to tyramine showed a statistically significant (p-value<0.05) reduction in amyloid-beta plaque. However, the higher percentage did not have the highest reduction in amyloid-beta plaques. One reason for this may be the greater availability of tyramine and octopamine as substrates for monoamine oxidase-B. These results suggest tyramine can be used to prevent amyloid-beta plaques within humans.

A NOVEL CYCLODIPEPTIDE WITH A SIGNIFICANT ANTI-TUMOR ACTIVITY FROM A MARINE BACILLUS
Heng Jiao
Shanghai Yanan High School, Shanghai 200433, P.R.China

A novel cyclodipeptide [3-methyl-6-(2-methylbutyl)-piperazine-2, 5-dione] was isolated from a marine bacillus in my previous works, and it showed a potent anti-fungal activity in vitro. The purpose of the present study is to identify its anti-tumor activity as well as the possible mechanisms involved in. Cytotoxicity was tested against tumor cell lines in vitro, tumor growth inhibition was observed on tumor-bearing mice model transplanted with S180 cells subcutaneously. The mechanisms on cellular apoptosis contributing to its anti-tumor activity were revealed by electronic microscopy, flow cytometry, DNA fragmentation, and caspases activation. The results showed the compound exhibited a significant cytotoxicity against tumor cells including P338, S180 and A1990 with the IC50 of 0.10, 0.98 and 5.20 microgram/ml, respectively. It elicited also a strong anti-tumor activity in S180-bearing mice model in an ED50 of 49.14 microgram/kg. The anti-tumor effect of the compound was identified through the induction of the apoptosis in tumor cells. The typical appearances including chromatin condensation, mitochondrial swelling, and intracellular bulb formation were seen under the electronic microscopy. An apoptotic rate of 53.04% was achieved at the concentration of 2.0 microgram/ml by flow cytometry with annexin V/PI double staining. DNA fragmentation was detected obviously on DNA electrophoresis, and it was demonstrated that it was a potent activator for caspase 3, 7 and 8. Furthermore, the compound did not affect the behaviors and activities of our mice in the experiments at the dosage of 2000 microgram/kg (40-fold ED50). The novel cyclodipeptide may serve as a lead compound for further development of the novel anti-tumor agent.

MODIFICATION OF FIBRINOGEN CLOTTING IN THE ABSENCE OF THROMBIN: A NOVEL SURFACE CHEMISTRY APPROACH WITH BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS
Pooja Rambhia
Jericho High School, Jericho, NY

Structural alterations between the surfaces of implantable biomedical devices and blood proteins (fibrinogen and fibrin) can be controlled through the use of two distinct surface chemistries. These structural alterations can be further controlled through interactions between specific domains of the fibrinogen molecule. The purpose of this study was to employ the use of hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces to alter the conformation of fibrinogen on synthetic fluoromica clay, organo clay, polystyrene, and poly (styrene-random-4-vinylphenol) (PS-r-P4VPh) with 13 mol% of vinylphenol. Fibrinogen conformations on varied polymer surfaces determined the induction or inhibition of clotting. PS-r-P4VPh (13 mol% of vinylphenol), a hydrophilic polymer, inhibited fibrinogen clot formation while polystyrene, a hydrophobic polymer, induced clot formation. Experimental outcomes were due to the interactions mainly between the A-pocket and a-knob of the fibrinogen molecule, as well as interactions between its' alpha-C domains. A secondary purpose included using the induction and inhibition of fibrinogen clotting to induce thrombin deficient wound healing and also inhibit unwanted thromboses on endovascular stents. Confocal microscopy showed the migration, adhesion, and proliferation of dermal fibroblasts and endothelial cells on polystyrene surfaces. Additionally, confocal microscopy showed the inhibition of fibrinogen clotting on an endovascular stent coated with PS-r-P4VPh (13 mol% of vinylphenol). In the future this process may be used develop wound healing grafts for individuals suffering from blood coagulation disorders, as well as eliminate detrimental thrombosis on implantable biomedical devices.

EXPLORING THE EFFECTS OF NICOTINE ON THE EXPRESSION OF MOLECULAR COMPOUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE: A NOVEL MECHANISM IN NEUROPROTECTION
Steven Ham
Herricks Senior High School, New Hyde Park, NY

Studies regarding nicotine’s effect on molecular compounds associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) prompted this experiment to explore a possible neuroprotective mechanism of nicotine. It was hypothesized that nicotine functions in its neuroprotective manner via induced morphine release to regulate beta-amyloid metabolism. Cultured neuroblastoma cell lines (SY-SY5Y and HTB-11) were treated with nicotine. Genes associated with AD were observed via RNA isolation, RT-PCR, and gel electrophoresis. SH-SY5Y cells were also treated with naloxone and L-NAME, antagonists of nitric oxide production, to confirm nicotine’s modulation of beta-amyloid aggregation through induced morphine release. Heat shock protein-70 (HSP-70), a chaperone protein associated with amyloid precursor protein, was observed using an ELISA assay. Cell viability assays were employed to observe nicotine’s effect on SH-SY5Y cells treated with rotenone, a compound used to mimic AD. Results showed nicotine down-regulated proteases associated with increased beta-amyloid metabolism, such as beta-secretase-1, while up-regulating proteases with neurotrophic qualities, such as beta-secretase-2 and alpha-secretase. In cells treated with naloxone and L-NAME in addition to nicotine, no modulation of these protesases occurred. Cells also demonstrated increased levels of HSP-70 when treated with nicotine, while naloxone and L-NAME inhibited this up-regulation in protein concentrations. Furthermore, viability assays showed nicotine inhibited cell death and inactivity in cells treated with rotenone. This project successfully demonstrated nicotine’s neuroprotectivity via induced morphine release. Future studies include delving into the possibility of coupling nicotine, or a molecular compound with similar chemical effects as nicotine, with a drug delivery system to directly target nicotinic receptors in the brain.

MULTIPLEX TAGGING TO UNDERSTAND RIBOSOMAL BIOGENESIS
Mary Katherine Germino
Immaculata High School, Somerville, New Jersey, USA

The composition of large protein complexes can change under various environmental conditions and according to the cell cycle. However, tracking the changes in individual proteins in the complex can be difficult. The purpose of this research was to test the feasibility of a novel multiplex tagging scheme in yeast for an analysis of the role of proteins in a complex involved in the biogenesis of the 60S ribosome which consists of 24 non-ribosomal proteins. A number of proteins in the complex were tagged with two epitope tags: a tag common to all the proteins (HA1) and a specific tag (different for each protein). Each double tag was inserted in the proper chromosomal location of the target gene with a selectable kanamycin marker. The utilization of a Cre-loxP-kanamycin cassette allowed the kanamycin marker to be recycled for each successive tag. The introduction of each tag at the proper chromosomal location was confirmed through PCR, and the expression of each tagged protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Interestingly, the tagging process slowed the growth of the yeast cells, suggesting an impairment in ribosome biogenesis. When the cells with these tagged proteins were cultured, colonies of cells with an abnormal phenotype were discovered. These abnormal cells were unusually large and appeared to have a defect in cytokinesis. This mutant may connect cell size, cell division and ribosome biogenesis. The tagging scheme developed in this project was shown to be viable and useful for the identification of individual proteins of a large complex, and may offer insight into the complex process regulating cell growth and ribosome biogenesis. The "tagged" cell lines, because of their slower growth, also might be useful for selecting mutants which overcome this slower growth, thereby allowing genetic analysis of the process of ribosome formation.

THE EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE AND PH ON ENZYME ACTIVITY
Christine Ivey Hoyle
Ballard High School, Louisville, KY

The purpose of this project was to discover under what conditions an enzyme will catalyze most efficiently. The enzyme chosen for this study was potato catalase. Catalase converts hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water. Solutions of hydrogen peroxide were prepared at different temperatures and pHs. Filter paper disks were dipped into a crude extract of potato catalase. The disks were submerged into the different hydrogen peroxide solutions, and the oxygen created caused the disks to eventually float to the surface. The time it took for the disks to rise to the top was recorded. The time required was an indirect measurement of the enzyme's rate of activity. It was discovered that as the temperature was raised, the enzyme catalyzed faster up to 39 degrees Celsius, but then the reaction rate dropped at higher temperatures. However, for pH, the enzyme worked well over a range from pH 5 to 9, with pH 5 being slightly optimal. These results are consistent with scientific understanding that enzymes have optimal temperature and pH conditions at which they work the fastest.

The main purpose of the study was to analyze some of the many effects that the sodium bicarbonate has. The hypothesis was that it can neutralize the acids that come after insects’ stings. The other question was how the saliva’s pH changes after eating or drinking different kinds of food and if the sodium bicarbonate helps cleaning our teeth. <br><br>The pH of the different substances was shown, after many measurements, by the litmus paper, used as an indicator. <br><br> <br><br>Mosquitoes and other insects inject a special liquid in our blood to prevent coagulation or other reasons. The acidity of the liquid breaks the delicate blood’s balance and causes itch. If we put a water solution of bicarbonate of soda on the bite, it will enter through the pores until the interested zone where it will neutralize the acidity and pain will finish. <br><br>After eating food our saliva becomes more acid. This is the main cause of the proliferation of bacteria. If we brush our teeth with sodium bicarbonate we will make our saliva basic again so we will prevent the arrival of bacteria, maintaining our mouth clean.<br><br> <br><br>The study is very practical in our everyday life and bicarbonate of soda is really a great substance because it solves the problem immediately and once for all, but the most important characteristics are that it is without collateral effects and it can be used by anyone – form a child to a pregnant woman to an ill person.

WASTE TO WATTS: EXAMINING THE EFFICIENCIES OF MEDIATOR AND MEDIATOR-LESS MICROBIAL FUEL CELLS
Patrick Austin Myers
Carlisle High School, Carlisle, PA

The purpose of this experiment was to examine the comparative efficiencies of mediator and mediator-less MFCs, with the aim of increasing MFC power output. The procedure was constructed to determine the most efficient MFC out of mediator-less, 0.1M methylene blue (MB)-mediated, and 0.1M neutral red (NR)-mediated anode mixtures. The hypothesis was that NR would outperform other mixtures because it possesses a far more negative redox potential than MB. This allows NR to facilitate more electron transfers than MB and the mediator-less mixture, which suffered from a lack of any catalysts to aid in facilitating electron transfers. To evaluate this project, three dual-cell MFCs were constructed, with plastic containers housing an anaerobic anode, aerobic cathode, and a carbon rod electrode in each. The containers were separated by an agar-based PEM and connected by alligator wires attached to the 12 gauge copper wires of the carbon rod electrodes in each container. Three trials of five days each were conducted and measurements were taken twice a day. Analysis revealed that NR clearly outperformed the other anode mixtures. In overall test results, NR produced up to three times the voltage of the MB and mediator-less mixtures. The findings thus supported the conclusion that NR mediation produced the most efficient MFC and, as an interesting side-note, that mediator MFCs are more efficient than mediator-less MFCs.

WEAVING HEALTH: THE WEAVING OF NEW DRUGS FROM THE WEB SILK OF SPIDERS, III
Leonardo de Oliveira Bodo
Colegio Dante Alighieri, Sao Paulo, SP, BRASIL

In the first two years of my research I worked with one type of websilk called otheca, searching new antimicrobial substances. I found some and characterized one as an antifungal peptide. This third year, based on the same hypothesis that the spider deposits on the websilk substances able to protect prays, eggs and itself, I decided to look for different activities: antiviral and antitumor. For that, I searched for more bioactive molecules on another spider and websilk, the hunt one. Besides, I tested the cytotoxic of the antimicrobial fractions and worked on their characterization. Diseases, infectious or cancers cause 20000 deaths per year worldwide. Resistant microorganisms are being selected and accessible treatments for cancer or viral diseases almost do not exist. Based on it, I started the laboratorial step. I used again the HPLC for purifications. I also repeated antimicrobial tests but, most important for this year, the cytotoxic, antiviral and antitumor tests. For characterization I used not only Q-Tof but Quadrupole for non-peptide fractions. I concluded that, the peptide I characterized during the first two years of my research as antifungal, showed high cytotoxic against five lines of cells. However, it showed activity against oxidant bacteria which survives in gasoline. I found a low molecular weight and a simple acetyl polyamine, easy synthesizable with strong and low concentration antimicrobial activity but, most important: also no cytotoxicity, which is the main issue of drugs. I also found a bioactive molecule that showed antitumor activity. Antiviral tests are still in progress.

THE EFFECTS OF THE IRON SPECIFIC CHELATOR, SALICYLALDEHYDE ISONICOTINOYL HYDRAZONE, IN PROVIDING PROTECTION TO PC3 CELLS EXPOSED TO CESIUM RADIATION.
Zachary Carter Strickland
Christian Academy of Louisville

The purpose of this experiment was to see whether the iron specific chelator, salicylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone (SIH), would provide protection to PC3 cells exposed to radiation. PC3 cells were cultured for 72 hours using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The cells were transferred to well plates and 5ìM of hemin was added to one half of the wells. The plates were cultured for twenty-four hours. Then 2ìM of SIH was added to one group of the cells, 20ìM of SIH was added to second group, 50ìM of SIH was added to third group, and the fourth group was held as the control group. After two hours, cells were exposed to 5 gray of cesium radiation for either 10 or 12½ minutes. After seventy-two hours, the cells were examined using a spectrofluorometer and results recorded. A second test was conducted as above using a cloning density of 1 x 103 cells per well and MTS assay conducted after five days to measure cell kill.<br><br> The results showed that the SIH had a significant impact on the viability of the cells. The cells with 2ìM SIH concentration had a 16% greater viability than the control group. The cells with 20ìM SIH concentration had 31% greater cell viability than the control group and the cells with 50ìM SIH concentration had 56% greater cell viability than the control group. Therefore, SIH, when coupled with radiation therapy, offers the promise of a better treatment alternative for patients suffering from cancer. <br><br>

IS AUTISM BOTH A GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL DISORDER?
Alexander Scott Caldwell
Saint Pius X High School, Albuquerque, NM

Complex diseases like autism are likely the result of an interaction between genetic susceptibilities and environmental triggers. Folate plays a critical role in a number of biochemical pathways involving the transfer of methyl groups. Methyl groups play key roles in metabolism of metals, reduction of toxic metabolic byproducts (e.g. homocysteine), and DNA transcription. The amount of folate in the body depends not only on diet but also upon the activity of enzymes involved in folate metabolism. There are many polymorphisms within the folate metabolic pathway and most of these variants display a reduced level of enzyme activity which would result in a decrease in the metabolism of heavy metal toxins, and decrease the generation of methyl donor groups for DNA. Reduced activity of one of these enzymes, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), would likely result in toxic elevated plasma homocysteine levels and lower the levels of methionine and s-adenosylmethione (SAM). In this study, saliva samples from 8 Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and 10 normal children were measured for two common MTHFR polymorphisms using RT-PCR techniques. Children diagnosed with autism displayed the minor allele for the MTHFR genes more often than controls. Hair samples showed less excretion of sulhydryl reactive metals suggesting lower levels of methyl donor groups. These findings suggest that folate enzymatic activity may be lower in autistic children and may contribute to a depletion of methyl groups needed to metabolize metals and other toxins as well as methylate DNA.

FATS THAT KILL CANCER
Alexander Edmund Blank
Lower Canada College, Montreal, Quebec, Canada

Most anticancer agents are extremely toxic. Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), a fatty acid which occurs naturally in the milk and meat of ruminant animals, is safe and non-toxic. This project investigates the anticancer effect of CLA on the human hepatoma cell line (HepG2), an exceedingly virulent cancer, by hypothesizing that CLA kills HepG2 cells in a dose dependant way.<br><br> HepG2 cells were grown in serum free Minimal Essential Medium. At time zero, 50 uM, 100 uM or 200 uM CLA was added and the cells were divided into two groups: 1) 24 hour and 2) 48 hour incubation. To eliminate the possibility that CLA’s effect was due to a non-specific effect of fatty acids, 100 uM Oleate was used as a negative control. CLA’s toxicity was determined using the CytoTox 96 cytotoxicity assay.<br><br> The percentage cell death after 24 hours were: 12.8% for 200 uM CLA, 10.5% for 100 uM CLA and 9.9% for 50 uM CLA. At 48 hours, 200 uM CLA killed 6.6%, 100 uM CLA killed 4.9% and 50 uM CLA killed 1.4% of the HepG2 cells.<br><br> These results show that CLA kills HepG2 cells in a dose dependant manner. Therefore, CLA may prove to be an ideal chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of early liver cancer by safely killing isolated cancer cells before they multiply. If CLA proves clinically useful, dairy products could be fortified with higher concentrations of CLA to give people a non-toxic, cancer preventative agent that helps eliminate precancerous cells through apoptosis.<br><br>

WEAVING HEALTH: THE WEAVING OF NEW DRUGS FROM THE WEB SILK OF SPIDERS, III
Leonardo de Oliveira Bodo
Colegio Dante Alighieri, Sao Paulo, SP, BRASIL

In the first two years of my research I worked with one type of websilk called otheca, searching new antimicrobial substances. I found some and characterized one as an antifungal peptide. This third year, based on the same hypothesis that the spider deposits on the websilk substances able to protect prays, eggs and itself, I decided to look for different activities: antiviral and antitumor. For that, I searched for more bioactive molecules on another spider and websilk, the hunt one. Besides, I tested the cytotoxic of the antimicrobial fractions and worked on their characterization. Diseases, infectious or cancers cause 20000 deaths per year worldwide. Resistant microorganisms are being selected and accessible treatments for cancer or viral diseases almost do not exist. Based on it, I started the laboratorial step. I used again the HPLC for purifications. I also repeated antimicrobial tests but, most important for this year, the cytotoxic, antiviral and antitumor tests. For characterization I used not only Q-Tof but Quadrupole for non-peptide fractions. I concluded that, the peptide I characterized during the first two years of my research as antifungal, showed high cytotoxic against five lines of cells. However, it showed activity against oxidant bacteria which survives in gasoline. I found a low molecular weight and a simple acetyl polyamine, easy synthesizable with strong and low concentration antimicrobial activity but, most important: also no cytotoxicity, which is the main issue of drugs. I also found a bioactive molecule that showed antitumor activity. Antiviral tests are still in progress.

SCREENING HIV REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE(RT) INHIBITORS FROM EDIBLE AND MEDICINAL MUSHROOMS
Jianbin Wang
High School Attached to Peking University, Beijing, P.R.China

Twelve species of mushrooms, including both edible and medicinal mushrooms, were screened for HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitory activity. Polysaccharides and glycoproteins were prepared from hot water extracts of the mushrooms and their HIV-1 RT inhibitory activities were assayed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit from Boehringer Mannheim Company (Germany). Polysaccharide-enriched preparations from Lactarius camphorates, Trametes suaveolens, Sparassis crispa, Pleurotus sajor-caju, and Russula paludosa elicited over 50% inhibition when tested at the concentration of 1 mg/ml. The glycoprotein fraction from Russula paludosa demonstrated the highest inhibitory activity on HIV-1 RT (97.6%). Fraction SU2, purified from Russula paludosa glycoprotein fraction by anion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and gel filtration on Superdex 75 exhibited potent inhibitory activity on HIV-1 RT. At the concentrations of 1 mg/ml, 0.2 mg/ml and 0.04 mg/ml, the inhibition ratios were 99.2%, 89.3% and 41.8%, respectively. The molecular mass of SU2 was 4.5 kDa and its N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined to be KREHGQHCEF.

A QUEST FOR A STRONGER HOMEMADE BIOPLASTIC: THE EFFECT OF NATURAL ADDITIVES ON THE TENSILE STRENGTH OF HOMEMADE BIOPLASTICS
Erica Budina
Medford High School, Medford, MA

Regardless of the progress made in recent years, the improvement of the properties of bioplastics remains an issue open to creative solutions. This study provides methods to improve the ultimate tensile strength of homemade bioplastics using natural additives. <br><br> Three experiments were conducted to accomplish this goal. Experiment 1 investigated the effect of different bioploymers (corn starch, agar powder, potato starch, and a combination of potato starch, agar powder, and gelatin) on the tensile strength of homemade bioplastics. Experiment 2 studied the role of eggshell powder as a natural additive. Experiment 3 sought to identify whether inserting other natural additives such as clamshell powder, sawdust, or a combination of clamshell powder, eggshell powder, coconut shell powder, and gelatin would further improve the tensile strength. A device was built to measure the ultimate tensile strength of each bioplastic specimen.<br><br> The results of these experiments indicated that the use of agar powder as a biopolymer yielded a bioplastic with a higher tensile strength than the specimens made with corn starch, potato starch, or a combination of potato starch, agar powder, and gelatin. The use of eggshell powder as an additive in an amount up to 16.7% of the amount of biopolymer increased the tensile strength by 87%. The use of a combination of eggshell, clamshell, coconut shell, and gelatin resulted in the bioplastic with the highest tensile strength. This combination of natural additives created a new bioplastic with an ultimate tensile strength of 8.4 MPa. <br><br> Food processing companies can use this material as packaging for their products. With slight improvements, this product can be used to replace petroleum-based plastics in other applications.

IDENTIFYING ANTICANCER DRUG TARGETS THROUGH A NOVEL SYNTHESIS OF RNAI AND MICROARRAY TECHNOLOGY
Leah Anthony Libresco
The Wheatley School, Old Westbury NY, USA

The two central problems in developing anticancer drugs are finding targets for drugs and minimizing the damage done to non-cancerous cells. RNAi screens expedite this process by allowing researchers to test numerous drug targets quickly to find targets that kill cancerous cells. My screen explored the synergistic effects of rapamycin on prostate cancer when combined with the shRNA’s. Two probable synthetic lethal combinations of drugs were identified: rapamycin and tarceva and rapamycin and velcade. These paired treatments may help treat prostate cancer more effectively.

A BIOCHEMICAL, QUALITATIVE, SEMI-QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE ENZYME SUPPLEMENT VITALZYME
Michelle Chandra Baker
Baker Preparatory Academy: Festus, MO USA

In view of the PC-SPES scandal concerning an alternative cancer therapy for prostate cancer and the lack of FDA regulation of nutritional supplements, the accuracy of the labeling on an enzyme supplement was assessed. The ingredients of the vitalzyme capsule include protease, serrapeptase, papain, bromelain, amylase, lipase, rutin, amla. Amylase was primarily investigated because the testing methods are readily available. Two questions were asked (a) is amylase present, and (b)since there are over 6000 types of amylase and some are carcinogenic, which types are present?<br><br> It was hypothesized that amylase would be present and that some of the amylase present would be derived from the Bacillus lichenformis organism, a common source of industrial amylase. <br><br> To determine the presence of amylase, a lugol test was performed, indicating the presence of amylase. To test the type of amylase, temperature and pH assays were performed. <br><br> Since each enzyme has its own specific optimum pH and temperature, if the optimum pH and temperature were found, the type of amylase could be found by entering the data into the protein database BRENDA. Unfortunately, the database lacked a corresponding optimal pH and temperature values and no definite conclusion was drawn. More research must be completed to reach a definitive conclusion. However, based on the research completed, the investigated amylase's optimal pH does not correspond with any of the pHs in the body and thus may not function well if ingested for nutritional and health benefits. FDA approval may be warranted for nutritional supplements.

RESVERATROL INDUCES APOPTOSIS AND INHIBITS THE CELL GROWTH OF NEUROBLASTOMA, ENDOMETRIAL AND HUMAN LEUKEMIA CELLS
Quintisha Marie Walker
SASA, Saginaw, MI, USA

Resveratrol is a phytoalexin, a natural plant product, which has the ability to fight cancer at initiation, promotion, and progression. It has been shown to act as an antioxidant, antiplatelet, anti-inflammatory and antitumor compound. Research shows that resveratrol inhibits the growth of and induces apoptosis in many cancer cell types. This research studied its apoptotic and inhibitory effects on Neuroblastoma, Endometrial, and Human Leukemia cells. Neuroblastoma is an aggressive childhood cancer with limited treatment options. Endometrial cancer is a disease in which malignant cells form in the tissues of the endometrium. Leukemia is a cancer that occurs in the blood cells. <br><br> To test the effects of resveratrol on neuroblastoma cells, the neuroblastoma cell lines SKNAS, SY5Y, and NGP were treated with 10µM, 50uM, 100uM, and 200uM of resveratrol. The Endometrial cell line ECC-1 was treated with 50uM, 100µM, and 200uM resveratrol. The Human Leukemia cell line MOLT-4 25uM, 50uM, 100µM, and 200uM resveratrol. Cells were analyzed for cell viability, and apoptosis was measured by morphology and the activation of degradative enzymes caspase 3/7 and 9. <br><br> Resveratrol was found to induce apoptosis and inhibit the growth of Neuroblastoma, Endometrial, and Human Leukemia cancer cells. The inhibitory effects of resveratrol were dose dependent and these effects of resveratrol were associated with the induction of apoptosis. An increased number of apoptotic cells were observed which coincided with increased caspase activity in a time-course and concentration dependent manner. The effects were more pronounced at higher concentrations, and with longer time of drug exposure. The data suggests that Neuroblastoma, Endometrial, and Human Leukemia cells are sensitive to resveratrol and that further animal experiments are warranted.<br><br>

IN VITRO ENZYME-CATALYZED CONVERSION OF CARBON DIOXIDE TO METHANOL
Dayton Thomas Horvath
Newtown High School, Sandy Hook, CT

As nations around the world develop and grow, pollutants levels are increasing in the atmosphere far beyond controllable levels. The emission of carbon dioxide may be causing the warming of Earth’s climate. The billions of tons of carbon dioxide produced every year from combusted fuels needs to be captured and controlled. There are multiple methods available to collect newly produced carbon dioxide but no simple way to store or recycle it. Using an in-vitro equilibrium between three enzymes and reduced Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NADH), one carbon dioxide molecule can be converted through a series of intermediates into one methanol molecule. A novel procedure was developed from a previously reported sol gel carbon dioxide conversion method and a recent silica-film coated alginate bead setup. Encapsulating each dehydrogenase enzyme into silica-film coated alginate gel beads enhanced the reaction over previously described methods. The NADH functioned as an electron donor and allows for the reactions to take place. The reverse mechanisms of each enzyme were utilized to convert carbon dioxide into methanol, theoretically consuming six molecules of NADH in the process. A fluorimeter was employed to analyze NADH levels over time to ascertain the reaction rate of the system. Gas Chromatography was used to quantify methanol production. The data indicate that enzyme-enhanced alginate beads successfully convert carbon dioxide to methanol. The electric current was applied in an attempt to recycle NAD+ electrochemically. This may help the system become a self-contained method of recycling carbon dioxide.

GOLD DUST: AN ALTERNATIVE TO COMMERCIAL SUNSCREENS A SPECTROMETRIC AND ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT STUDY USING LUMBRICUS TERRESTRIS
Kelly Sabrina Lynn
Wetumpka High School, Wetumpka, AL

My project proposes using gold in sunscreen to eliminate harmful chemicals and utilize gold’s reflectivity and elemental stability. <br><br>My goal was to develop a gold based, light absorbing solution that allowed the skin to breathe and absorb Vitamin D. The solutions' absorbance and transmittance were measured using a spectrometer. Five solutions (Solutions B, C, D, E, and F) with concentrations ranging from 0.015-0.125% were applied to forty-eight test subjects (Lumbricus terrestris). Eight groups were tested under fluorescent sunshine light and eight groups under black light for fifteen minutes over five days. Each light group tested either control, baby oil, commercial sunscreen or a gold-dust solution. After exposure, worms were examined and physical changes noted.<br><br>Spectrometric tests indicated baby oil would make a good agent and that Solutions B, C, D, E, and F would be the most testable on worms. Light tests indicated that the commercial sunscreens had the highest percent area affected in both light groups, and the highest fatality rate. Of the gold solutions, Solution B had the highest percent area affected in both light groups, Solution E the lowest percent area affected, and Solution F the highest combined fatality rate. <br><br>My hypothesis was correct. Spectrometer readings indicate that gold dust does in fact absorb light. Tests on worms further proved that a gold concentration of 0.09375% (Solution E) can provide protection from both visible and ultraviolet light . The cost is $0.05 per milliliter, approximately $0.01 more than commercial sunscreen (Coppertone).

THE ROLE OF BRADYKININ ON BREAST CANCER CELLS
David Bai
Troy High School, Troy, MI

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women. Its primary danger comes from metastasis to other organs, especially to bone. During this metastasis, breast cancer cells destroy the bone and cause the patient pain. Recently, a pain mediator, bradykinin (BK) has been shown to have a possible role in promoting tumor survival and growth. Therefore, in this study, the role of BKs on human breast cancer tumor cell lines and its ability to regulate expression of BK receptors (B1 and B2) in addition to matrix metalloprotineases (MMPs) 1, 2, 9, and 13 were investigated since MMPs aid metastasis to bone by dissolving bone extracellular matrix. Human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-10-2A were cultured and treated with varying concentrations of BK1 and BK2, their antagonists, and a mixture of the BK and its respective antagonist; samples were collected at 24 and 48 hours. Gelatin zymography, western blotting, and reverse-transcription with qualitative polymerase chain reaction were used to analyze the samples. The results showed a consistent and significant downregulation of MMP and B2 expression when the cells were treated with BK antagonists at both time intervals. Thus, treatment of human breast cancer cells with BK antagonists may reduce their ability to destroy the extracellular matrix of bone and be a target for the treatment and management of bone metastasis.

BIOMARKERS FOR CIN GENE(ZW10) MUTATIONS IN EARLY OVARIAN CANCER
Sierra Dominique Harris
Dutchtown High School, Hampton, GA

The hypothesis for my experiment is if there are any mutations in CIN gene (ZW10), then they may be associated with the early ovarian cancer subtypes and stages, and could be used as potential biomarkers. I prepared my samples by homogenizing (Tissue/DNA Extraction), amplifying (Polymerase Chain Reaction), and purifying (Gel Extraction) them.<br><br> Restriction Digestion, a method using enzymes, was used to determine if any of the enzymes could "cut" my samples. The four enzymes used were Enzyme 4 (Hha1), Enzyme 7 (Hae2), Enzyme 9 (Hinf1), and Enzyme 10 (Mbo1). Cycle Sequencing was also done to compare the nucleotide patterns. I ran an agarose gel (Gel Electrophoresis) to see if any of the enzymes used had cut my samples. <br><br>Based on my results, Enzyme 9 (Hinf1) was the only enzyme to cut any of my samples. Sample 1 (Stage 3 endometrous), Sample 2 (Stage 4 endometrous), Sample 5 (serous T of low malignant borderline), Sample 6 (serous borderline), and Sample 7 (serous papillary carcinoma) were cut. Enzyme 9 could be used as a potential biomarker for those types of ovarian cancer so my hypothesis was correct.

RICE ETHYLENE RECEPTOR GENE: CONSTRUCTION OF THE EXPRESSION VECTOR AND PROTEIN LOCALIZATION
Dinghao Tang

Drought and high soil salinity are the major factors related with reduced plant growth and productivity. Approximately, a quarter of the cultivated lands and half of the overall lands are affected by drought and salinity in China, which is still worsening. Therefore, the research of stress-tolerance¡¯s molecular mechanisms is important to help in improving the quality of new paddy rice varieties.<br><br> Ethylene is a gaseous hormone that plays an important role in plant growth, development and stress responses. In the previous studies, a new ethylene receptor gene, OSPK1, have been cloned from rice cDNA. Its expression may be induced by adversities. The overall sequence of OSPK1 was obtained by sequencing and after comparing it with published genome sequences, an intron was found. Through structural analysis of OSPK1 protein, it can be anticipated that a signal peptide existed in the N-terminal, followed by three transmembrane regions, a GAF domain, a putative kinase domain and a receptor domain. Using in vivo DNA recombination technique, the OSPK1 plant expression vector was constructed through amplifying the gene from original OSPK1 carrier T-easy vector with designed primers and inserting the sequence into pBIN438 plant expression vector by restriction enzyme reactions and ligations, which will be of use for the next ready transfer into paddy rice. Furthermore, I also created the OSPK1-GFP fusion protein expression vector. By instant expression of OSPK1-GFP fusion protein in the rice protoplast, the OSPK1 protein was localized to the cytoplasm membrane and proceeded to act as a signal transducer there.

ETHANOL PRODUCTION YIELD IMPROVEMENT BY STERILIZATION OF THE SUGAR CANE JUICE (GARAPA) VIA MICROWAVE
Alejandro Mariano Scaffa
Escola Americana de Campinas, Campinas, Sao Paulo, BRASIL

The purpose of this experiment was to find a less expensive, than the already existent, way to get rid of the lactobacillus contamination in the sugar cane juice. These lactobacillus diminish the efficiency of the production of ethanol of the fluid. One way to possibly solve this was to expose the lactobacillus filled solution to microwaves. As the hypothesis the lactobacillus were to be eliminated, and in a much cheaper way. The experiment followed by putting together two smaller experiments: doing it the conventional heating way, and doing it with microwave exposure. The microwave exposure was done by exposing the samples of the sugar cane juice into a microwave at 2.45GHz and 1000 watts of power from 0 to 9 seconds. Each sample would remain one second more exposed than the other. The conventional way had samples heated conventionally for 10 minutes having each sample at the same temperature as the other samples temperature in the microwave. The results showed that after nine seconds of microwave exposure all the lactobacillus died (results got by petri dish incubation) differently than in the conventional way. The clear conclusion is that it is much more expensive to sterilize it the regular way, by using the microwave exposure the price of sterilization drops and most probably so would the price of the ethanol when reaching the costumer, making this non-oil combustible a better option monetary wise. Another unexpected result is that by using this process, the production of ethanol, from the same amount of sample, increases from 5 to 8%.

INHIBITION OF THE FABI ENOYL-ACP REDUCTASE FROM BURKHOLDERIA PSEUDOMALLEI
Minah Kim
Paul D. Schreiber High School, Port Washington, NY

Burkholderia pseudomallei is a multi-drug resistant pathogen that is the causative agent of melioidosis. Triclosan and its class of diphenyl ethers have been shown to inhibit FabI, the enoyl ACP-reductase from B. pseudomallei, and to demonstrate slow-onset binding capabilities. Due to glucuronidation, the hydroxyl group on the A-ring of diphenyl ethers is easily metabolized, so a fluoro group was added to the A-ring to stabilize this metabolic issue. In this project, as a preliminary step in lead optimization, the ability of four fluoro-diphenyl ethers to inhibit FabI of B. pseudomallei (bpFabI) was assessed and compared. A plasmid carrying the bpFabI gene was used to overexpress the protein in Escherichia coli. Subsequently, the E. coli cells were harvested, lysed, and the protein was purified. The molecular weight of the purified protein on SDS-PAGE gel was consistent with the calculated mass of bpFabI. Catalytic activity was determined by measuring initial velocities of the reaction at varying substrate concentrations with trans-2-octenoyl-CoA as the substrate. The kcat, Km, and kcat/Km values of 2273 ± 100 min-1, 181.4 ± 17 µM, and 12.53 ± 5.9 µM-1min-1 respectively were comparable to previous findings. Subsequently, kinetic assays determined the IC50 values for the inhibition of bpFabI by PT400, PT401, PT415 and PT417. The IC50 was found to be 5.7 ± 1.1 µM, 5.9 ± 0.87 µM, 3.1 ± 1.2 µM and 2.1 ± 0.2 µM respectively, and three of the four inhibitors were found to exhibit slow-onset inhibition. PT400, which lacked a substituent at the ortho-position of the B-ring, did not demonstrate slow-onset inhibition. In accordance with previous work, the group on the ortho-position of the B-ring may influence inhibitor efficacy.

Christiana Obeng
Western High School, Baltimore, MD

The purpose of the project was to investigate the effect of nicotine, aspirin, caffeine, alcohol and sleeping pills on the heart rates of Daphnia. The hypothesis of this experiment was that caffeine, nicotine, aspirin, alcohol and sleeping pills will reduce the survival rate of Daphnia.<br><br> This is an observational study examining the survival rate of Daphnia receiving caffeine, aspirin, nicotine, ethanol and sleeping pills. The Daphnia was ordered from a biological supply catalog and kept in the laboratory for 48 hours for them to adjust to their new environment. Caffeine solution was obtained by dissolving six tablets of No-Doz (over-the-counter) in 300ml of water. Eight tablets of aspirin were dissolved in 300ml of water to obtain the aspirin solution. 10ml of denatured alcohol was diluted with water to 300ml for the ethanol solution. Two pieces of chewing tobacco were soaked for eight hours and the resulting solution was filtered to obtain the nicotine solution. The Daphnia were placed in six different Petri dishes and a drop of pond water was placed around each of them. The heart beat of the Daphnia per 10 seconds was recorded with the timer. A drop of each drug was placed respectively in the Petri dishes with one as the control.The heart beat per 10 seconds was recorded again after 30 seconds. The results were tabulated and analyzed graphically.<br><br>It was observed at the end of the experiment that the species on caffeine, nicotine and ethanol had increased heart beats. Whereas, the species on aspirin and sleeping pills had decreased heart beat. Since increase or decrease of heart beat from the baseline heart beat is a health risk, it was concluded that these drugs would reduce the survival rate of Daphnia.

BIOCHEMICAL AND STRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE ICMR-ICMQ COMPLEX, DOTA, AND DOTF OF LEGIONELLA PNEUMOPHILA
Abhishek Chintapalli
Homestead High School, Fort Wayne, IN

Legionella pneumophila (Lp) is a gram-negative bacterium that is the causative agent of Legionnaire’s disease. Once endocytosed by alveolar macrophages, Lp subverts the endosome-lysosome pathway and replicates within the host. Remodeling of the endocytic pathway depends on protein effectors that are translocated into the host cell by a type IVb secretion system. These effectors are involved in increasing the bacteria’s ability to survive inside the host cell by interfering with fusion of the Legionella-containing vacuole with the host’s degradation endosomes. In this study, I examine the properties of four proteins directly involved in the T4bSS: 1) the IcmQ-IcmR complex, 2) the predicted inner membrane protein DotA, and 3) a core translocase component DotF. Crystals of the Qn-Rm interacting domain have been solved previously and recently, I’ve obtained crystals of the entire IcmQ-IcmR complex which diffract x-rays to ~2.6 Å. In order to phase these crystals, several leucine residues were replaced with methionine in both IcmQ and IcmR. This will allow for incorporation of selenomethionine and subsequent phasing by multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD phasing). Crystals of this selenomethionine (SeMet) incorporated IcmQ-IcmR complex have been grown and are now being improved to maximize diffraction. Moreover, the DotF and DotA genes were cloned and purified respectively from the Lp genome and inserted into a pET-24 expression vector. Expression in a specialized E. coli strain was successful and subsequent experiments will be performed to determine the feasibility of cloning and expressing the entire core T4bSS.

USING LASER REFRACTION TO DETERMINE SUGAR CONSUMPTION BY YEAST
Achal James Fernando-Peiris
Mount Vernon High School, Mount Vernon, OH

By incubating yeast cells in vials filled with sugar solutions, their sugar consumption was measured as a function of temperature, time, and availability of oxygen. A special method was developed to measure the sugar concentration involving refraction of two lasers beams (green and red) obeying Snell’s law. The refraction angle changed with the sugar concentration inside water because the index of refraction changed with the amount of sugar dissolved in water. The incubated solution was centrifuged to remove the yeast cells and then poured inside an equilateral prism constructed from epoxying microscopic glass slides. The refraction angle of the solution measured after the incubation told us the amount of sugar remaining inside the solution which when compared with the starting amount told us how much sugar was consumed by yeast. As for the temperature dependent measurements, below 40 °C, yeast cells consumed more sugar as temperature increased. The yeast kept at 40 °C hardly consumed any sugar. The time dependent measurements for aerobic respiration were puzzling because they showed an increase in the sugar concentration after the incubation. Upon analyzing this further, the results indicate that this is probably because of the Crabtree effect, where yeast cells undergo fermentation even if oxygen is available. So the larger refraction of the laser beams in this case is due to the presence of ethyl alcohol even though the sugar concentration has probably gone down. To reach this conclusion, another calibration curve was obtained for various concentrations of ethyl alcohol.

THE EFFICIENCY OF ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS IN FACILITATING THE FERMENTATION OF DENTAL BACTERIA
Heidi Racquel Senst
Central High School, Aberdeen, South Dakota

This experiment was conducted to determine the production of lactic acid by dental bacteria, specifically Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus mutans, when utilizing artificial sweeteners as an energy source. Equal®, Sweet ‘N Low®, and Splenda® were compared against Dextrose to evaluate the difference in lactic acid production between artificial sweeteners and simple sugars. A significant reduction in the production of lactic acid may indicate that artificial sweeteners are a positive substitution for sugar when looking to support oral hygiene. The artificial sweeteners were also compared against each other.<br><br>To perform the experiment, bacterial cultures of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus salivarius were grown in Tryptic Soy Broth overnight. Then one drop of the bacteria was added to test tubes containing solutions of either Equal®, Sweet ‘N Low®, Splenda®, dextrose, or distilled water and nutrient broth. Next the bacteria were incubated for twenty-four hours. The test tubes were then autoclaved and the lactic acid produced was titrated using 0.01 molar sodium hydroxide. Phenolphthalein and a pH meter were used as indicators. The experiment was repeated three times to verify results.<br><br>T-tests and an ANOVA were used to determine the significance of the data. The results showed that it may be possible to improve oral hygiene by substituting artificial sweeteners Equal®, Sweet ‘N Low®, and Splenda® for sugar. Even though there is no significant difference in the production of lactic acid by Streptococcus mutans, without the initial dental decay formed by bacteria such as Streptococcus salivarius it is more difficult to develop dental cavities.<br><br>

EFFECT OF DIETARY SUGARS (GLUCOSE AND FRUCTOSE) ON THE PRODUCTION OF REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES IN FAT CELLS
Yevgen Yuri Sautin
Eastside High School Gainesville Florida, United States

Worldwide epidemic of obesity and associated diseases (type II diabetes, atherosclerosis, and hypertension) are a major medical challenge of 21st century. Fat tissue and its predominant cell type, adipocyte, is not just a passive depot for excessive fat, it is also an important endocrine organ which controls energy homeostasis. Derangements in fat cells play an important role in obesity-related diseases. Recently, it was discovered that oxidative stress plays a key role in obesity-related disorders. Modern diet is rich in carbohydrates, especially carbohydrates containing abnormally high amounts of fructose. We hypothesized that high levels of dietary sugars may lead to oxidative stress in the adipose tissue. In experiments on mouse adipocytes 3T3-L1 I studied the effect of glucose and fructose on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS were measured using fluorescent probe carboxy-H2DCFDA, activity of ROS producing enzyme NAPDH oxidase using lucigenin luminescent assay. I successfully differentiated 3T3-L1 cells into mature adipocytes and confirmed this staining with Oil Red stain. High glucose induced only moderate increase in ROS production, while both high and low amounts of fructose caused a dramatic increase in ROS production, which was blocked by NAC, general antioxidant, MnTMPyP, superoxide scavenger, and apocynin, and inhibitor of NADPH oxidase. Lucigenin assay confirmed activation of NADPH oxides in response to fructose. Thus, abnormal amounts of fructose induces production of ROS by NADPH oxidase in adipocytes, which might lead to oxidative stress and adverse obesity related derangements. Take home message: sweets and soft drinks are harmful to your health!<br><br>

LIFE IS SHORT WHEN SWEET: DIETARY FRUCTOSE DECREASES LIFESPAN AND FERTILITY
Alexandra Andreevna Sourakov
Eastside High School, Gainesville, FL

There is accumulating evidence that increased consumption of added sugars may have a pathogenic role in the development of obesity, diabetes, and cardiorenal disease. Due to increased intake of added sugars, fructose consumption has increased significantly in the last two centuries. Fructose has the same chemical formula as glucose (C6H12O6), but its metabolism differs notably from that of glucose. This study investigated the effects of fructose on the longevity and physiology of the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, and how they differed from those of glucose.<br><br> A longevity assay was conducted, in which the addition of fructose or glucose to the diet of C. elegans significantly reduced lifespan. Fructose reduced lifespan at both low (10mM) and high (40mM) concentrations, while glucose only produced an effect at the higher concentration. Additionally, fructose significantly reduced the total brood size. To determine whether reduced longevity and fertility were associated with oxidative stress in these nematodes, transgenic C. elegans were used to evaluate Pgst-4::GFP levels, as an indicator of oxidative stress. Glucose-fed worms expressed twice the amount of Pgst-4::GFP as the control, whereas fructose-fed showed no significant difference, suggesting that glucose caused oxidative stress while fructose did not and it is not the mechanism underlying fructose-induced reduction in lifespan and fertility. Fructose, at both low and high concentrations, significantly depleted intracellular ATP levels.<br><br> My results indicate that the ingestion of fructose has different physiological consequences than the ingestion of glucose.

THE EFFECT OF METHYL JASMONATE ON CROWN GALL REGRESSION AND PROTEIN PRODUCTION IN LYCOPERSICON ESCULENTUM
Chad Lawrence Harris
Palm Bay High School, Melbourne, FL

The purpose of this experiment is to determine if Methyl Jasmonate (MJ) will induce crown gall regression and protein production in tomato plants. If MJ induces gall regression and protein production, this chemical may be used as an anti-cancer agent, an agricultural disease fighting agent, or used in agriculture to maintain and/or boost immunity against disease. It was hypothesized that higher concentrations of injected MJ would cause a larger increase in protein production and gall regression when compared to the control and spray treatments.<br><br>In order to collect data, tomato plants were infected with Agrobacterium tumefaciens. After 3 weeks of crown gall growth, 2 concentrations of MJ were made. 96 plants were divided into 6 groups. Each group received either MJ spray/injection (low concentration), MJ spray/injection (high concentration), or ethanol spray/injection (control). To determine overall volume of the crown gall, Vernier calipers were used to measure height, width, and thickness. A Bradford protein assay was conducted every day for each individual group to determine if protein concentrations increased.<br><br>In conclusion, the data shows that higher concentrations of MJ caused a smaller decrease in average gall size in injection and mist when compared to low concentrations. Injection of MJ caused a larger decrease in average gall size when compared to mist. Ethanol injection and mist caused no decrease in crown gall size or increase in protein production. Since the control (ethanol) groups caused no gall regression or protein concentration increase, it is clear that MJ is the cause of regression and protein concentration increase.

URIDINE PHOSPHORYLASE SUBSTRATE SPECIFICITY: NEW METHODS AND PROSPECTS
Alexandra N. Zakharova
Moscow Chemical Lyceum #1303, Moscow, Russia

Uridine phosphorylase (UPase) is an enzyme that catalyzes the reversible phosphorolysis of natural nucleoside uridine, as well as a number of synthetic pyrimidine nucleosides, to the free base and ribose-1-phosphate. UPase is involved in important intracellular biochemical processes. Nucleoside analogues are a mainstream in the treatment of many viral infections and are used in medicine as antitumour drugs. That is why UPase is of great scientific and practice interest.<br><br>The main purpose of this investigation was to find out how the substrate specificity of UPase from E. coli depends on the structure of substrate.<br><br>In this project three nucleosides (uridine, 4-thiouridine and 6-methyluridine) were examined as substrates of UPase. Kinetics and equilibrium properties were studied with spectrophotometry and chromatography. <br><br>As a result an alternative spectrophotometric method for determination of UPase activity has been developed. The assay is based on the usage of 4-thiouridine. This substrate has an absorbance maximum at 330 nm on phosphorolysis and, as we have found out, it is as good for UPase as the natural substrate. The proposed method can be used in biological and chemical systems and in medical analyses.<br><br>It has been also discovered that the phosphorolysis is essentially irreversible with 6-methyluridine. It reveals wide prospects for the improvements in methodology of drug enzyme synthesis and for decreasing the costs of such drugs production and development. <br><br>This investigation marks a step toward better understanding of enzyme-substrate complex structure and catalytic mechanism of UPase.<br><br>

PBMCS AS AN IN VITRO MODEL FOR THE IMMUNE RESPONSE
Kenneth Richard Ott
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Alexandria, VA, USA

Human butyrylcholinesterase (HuBChE) is the most suitable future generation antidote for nerve agent poisoning. A dose of 200 mg of HuBChE is envisioned as a prophylactic treatment in humans that can protect from exposure of up to 2 x LD50 of soman. If the protective enzyme would be used more than once, then knowledge of the immunologic consequences, or the lack thereof, is essential. Since it is almost impossible to conduct these studies in vivo, I propose to evaluate and validate an in vitro model that can be predictive of in vivo immunologic response to antigens in humans. Freshly isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are used in this study as the in vitro system. PBMCs were isolated from human blood by centrifugation with Isolymph. The treatment of PBMCs and cytokine ELISA conditions were standardized using phytohemagglutinin (PHA-L), a known immunogen. Isolated cells were cultured overnight in 24 well plates (5 x 10^5 cells/well) and treated with either HuBChE or equine BChE (EqBChE) (5 ng to 10 ug/ml) for 24 hr. The cell supernatants were harvested and analyzed for cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 p40, and TNF-a) using commercially available ELISA kits. Treatment of PBMCs with up to 10 ug/ml HuBChE (a dose 5000 times higher than that proposed for soldiers) did not induce any measurable secretion of the four cytokines examined. Similarly, treatment with 10 ug/ml EqBChE did not result in the secretion of IL-6, Il-12 p40 or TNF-a, but a significant increase in the levels of IL-8 (300 pg/ml) was observed. These results are promising but further studies are required to validate the use of PBMCs as an in vitro model to study immune response.

BIOCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE FIRE RETARDANT PROPERTIES OF MEDICAGO SATIVA (ALFALFA): AN ALTERNATIVE TO AN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
Maria Del Mar Torres-Aviles
De La Salle School Bayamón PR

It is attributed to the plant of alfalfa, Medicago sativa the property of being antipyretic. Tests were made using extracts of alfalfa sprouts to determine possible effect as fire retardant in commercial paintings. Also it was determined the potential of alfalfa to reduce the action of fabric softeners that accelerate the flammability in children’s sleepwear. In combustion tests with known flammables materials the dry alfalfa demonstrated to be non-flammable. In tests of vertical flammability of "film" the paintings with alfalfa additives were more effective in slowing down the ignition compared with commercial paintings without additive. The painting samples with additive were applied on pieces of plycem and wood and placed to test horizontal flammability. In both cases, ignition time of the samples was slower than control. In tests of vertical flammability with fabric softeners, fabrics treated with M. sativa demonstrated 100% fire resistance and non-flammable action versus the tests with fabric softeners alone. Fabric softeners samples do not resist fire having greater char length. The hypotheses were sustained since the data tends to indicate the properties of fire retardant and heat insulator in commercial paintings. Also the data showed that M. sativa reduced fabric softeners accelerating flammability property. Results of biochemical characterization of M. sativa including atomic absorption tests, tends to indicate that chlorine and/or inorganic compounds may be base of the fire retardant property exhibited in tests conducted. In aqueous and ethanol solution of alfalfa a high concentration (1000 ppm) of chloride was found.<br><br>

A FLUORESCENT PROTEIN MARKER WHICH CAN SPECIFICALLY TAG PROTEINS OF YOUR INTEREST-ENGINEERING STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS SORTASE A TO IMPROVE PROTEIN DETECTION AND LOCALIZATION
Erin Kim
Mathematics and Science High School at Clover Hill, Midlothian, VA

Proteins serve as catalysts that maintain metabolic processes in the cell. Because of its important roles, new methods to characterize protein localization and trafficking are required to better understand the many complex regulatory pathways. Current technologies rely heavily upon Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), a bulky fluorescent protein with a propensity to polymerize within a cell, and a chemical coloring method which chemically dyes the proteins. However, these two primary methods have problems: GFP is limited in its utility because of its size, which interferes with proteins’ regular movement or pathways, and the chemical coloring method lacks specificity because it labels all proteins. In this experiment, the researcher alternatively combined a fluorescent substrate with Staphylococcus aureus Sortase A (Srt A) to create a better tool for protein detection and localization. The results showed that Srt A with fluorescent substrate could be used as a protein marker. However, in vitro studies using the preferred fluorescent substrate have verified limited use of Srt A. To increase Srt A’s efficiency, it was put into successful rounds of mutagenesis. Error prone PCR was used to create random mutagenesis and it will allow the researcher to screen for active mutated enzyme with the researcher’s desired specificity and properties. The result from the experiment will provide researchers with a better tool in which to study any protein of interest when tagged with the specificity marker.

THE CYCLIC VOLTAMMETRIC QUANTIFICATION OF TRICYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANTS UTILIZING A PHYSIOLOGICAL ANALYTE AT DIFFERENT PH READINGS
Priscilla Yvette Mendoza
Americas High School, El Paso, TX, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the ideal pH to quantify the tricyclic antidepressant drugs Imipramine, Desipramine, and Trimipramine in a phosphate buffer solution. The working, auxiliary, and reference electrodes were attached to the voltammeter and then were placed in the electrolyte solution. Phosphate buffers 1:4 at a pH of 3.8, pH 7.6, and pH 9.1 were utilized. Four hundred µl of each analyte (antidepressant drugs) were pipetted into each buffer solution for each pH reading. Controls were prepared for each pH reading, and the results were scanned to the voltammograph after the settings were adjusted. <br><br> From the results of this experiment, it can be concluded that the tricyclic antidepressants Desipramine, Imipramine, and Trimipramine were best quantified in a phosphate buffer solution at a pH of 9.1 using cyclic voltammetry techniques. The mode of action for these drugs in alleviating depression and the development of any possible side effects depends upon their concentration in physiological body fluids. Chemical reactions in the human body are very pH specific; therefore, cyclic voltammetry appears to be an efficient, inexpensive, and highly sensitive technique for the quantification of drugs to be used as medications. The specific pH at which optimal quantification is achieved is a very significant factor in determining and calculating precise dosages in order to avoid potential side effects and in determining exactly how much of the medication is actually being delivered to the physiological body fluids based on the specific pH. <br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF ASPARTAME-CONTAINING SWEETENERS ON DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Alexandra Berger Valente
Escola Americana de Campinas, Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil

The purpose of this experiment was to see the effects that Aspartame could cause to the Drosophila Melanogaster (fruit flies). Aspartame is a chemical that sometimes is added to the artificial sweeteners. For a long time there have been several different ideas about the side effects of Aspartame.<br><br> In order to make sure that the results were reliable, the Drosophila’s were divided into three groups, all of them with the same amount of flies. One of the groups was the control, and the other two received different dosages of Aspartame in their diet. Each testing group had 180 flies, although not all of them survived until the end of the experiment. After the flies had their food, they were placed in an Incubator where they stayed for 19 days. During this time period the larvas developed and became flies. After they were flies, they were killed and observations were made such as the size of their thorax and how many larva’s survived. <br><br> After the observations were made, statistical applications were done in order to truly find the effects of the Aspartame on the fly’s metabolism. Most noteworthy, there was a drastic change in the size of the thorax when compared with females of the 1x group and of the Control. The flies that received a higher dosage of Aspartame did not survive the testing, eliminating this third group from the analysis. <br><br>

HOW DO DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE LEVELS AFFECT THE CATALYTIC ACTIVITY OF ENZYME CATALASE? YEAR II OF A STUDY
Paul William Johannes
Fleming Island High School, Orange Park, FL

The purpose of my experiment was to answer the question: “How do different temperature levels affect the catalytic activity of enzyme catalase?” I hypothesized that the catalytic activity of enzyme catalase would be at its greatest at a temperature of 37C, as opposed to the other temperatures, and that the increase in catalytic activity is varies directly with the temperature. I tested each temperature in three test tubes to give my experiment more validity. I also tested a control group at room temperature (20C) with no distilled water. The amount of distilled water, mass of chicken liver, and the location of the experiment were kept constant to maintain control over the experiment. I then determined the elapsed time of the reaction and recorded it for each trial. I then averaged the times according to group. My results showed that on average the catalytic activity was highest in the group tested at 37C. The group tested at 37C had a high rate of reaction as opposed to the slower reaction rates of the groups tested at other temperatures. I concluded that the catalytic activity of enzyme catalase was highest in the group tested at 37C as opposed to the other variable groups. Though some variations in cooling occurred in the temperature I still find my results to be valid. I hypothesized that the catalytic activity of enzyme catalase would be at its greatest at a temperature of 37C, as opposed to the other temperatures, and that the increase in catalytic activity is varies directly with the temperature. My results have led to my confirmation of my hypothesis. Under most conditions the catalytic activity of enzyme catalase varies directly with temperature through 37C; then the catalytic activity decreases rapidly until no reaction occurs.

THE EFFECTS OF FAMILIAL HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY MUTATIONS ON THE POTENTIAL BINDING SITES BETWEEN MYOSIN AND MYOSIN BINDING PROTEIN-C: A COMPUTATIONAL METHOD
Jennifer Julia Zhang
Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science, Denton, TX

Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC), a potentially fatal heart disease in which a patient can suffer from serious arrhythmias, heart failure, and sudden death, is one of the leading causes of sudden death in young adults. It is usually caused by genetic mutations in the myosin and the cardiac isoform of myosin binding protein-C (cMyBP-C) that create complications in myosin-actin interactions and muscle contraction as a whole.<br><br>This study aims to use computational methods such as molecular mechanics and dynamics to simulate the interaction between the subfragment 2 (S2) of the myosin and the cMyBP-C, a heavily debated binding site, to determine whether or not the interaction is favorable.<br><br>Furthermore, two FCM-related mutations (R870H on the S2 and E301Q on the cC2) were applied in this study, and the effects of these mutations on the structure and function of the S2-cC2 complex were analyzed. In conclusion, the R870H seemed to greatly reduce the interaction between the S2 and cC2 while the E301Q mutation did not. From these findings, two suggestions can be made: (1) a binding site for the MyBP-C at the S2 region is a likely possibility and (2) FHC mutations could drastically change this interaction.

Lawrence High School, Cedarhurst New York, USA

A critical shortage of organ donors necessitates scientists to consider xenotransplantation, the art of transplanting organs of other species into humans. Xenotransplantation, however, triggers “hyperacute rejection” in the body, initiated by the complement system. Compstatin, a cyclic 13-amino acid peptide, was created to inhibit the C3 cascade of the complement system, but 152 ìM for 50% inhibition makes use costly.<br><br> This research created an analog of Compstatin by substituting 1-methyltryptophan (1MeW) into position 4 of the peptide, increasing the hydrophobicity just outside the â-turn, the binding site to C3. The seventh-position tryptophan was replaced on the â-turn with 5-fluorotryptophan (5fW) in the hope of increasing binding ability to C3. A second analog only substituted 1MeW into position 4.<br><br> Synthesized analogs were cyclized, cleaved of side chains, purified by HPLC, and molecular masses verified by mass spectroscopy; Enzyme Linked Immunosorbant Assay (ELISA) measured activity. Activity for analog 4(1MeW)7(5fW) was 220x greater than original Compstatin [IC50 of 0.70 ìM (SD 0.060)], while 4(1MeW) was 460x greater [IC50 of 0.34 ìM (SD 0.014)], creating highly effective complement inhibitors.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF AS2O5 ON THE DNA OF EQUUS CABALLUS A SECOND YEAR STUDAY
Jennifer Erin Gutman
Mount de Chantal Visitation Academy, Wheeling, WV USA

The effect of various levels of pentavalent arsenic on the DNA of horses was investigated. Pentavalent arsenic is the form of arsenic in CCA treated lumber (copper, chromium, arsenic). This lumber is used in many outdoor wood projects, such as fencing and barns. Past research demonstrated arsenic leached into soil at high levels and was absorbed into the surrounding grass. This raised concerns about the possible damage caused by the leached arsenic on the DNA of horses. Cheek cells were collected from three horses, divided into five groups for each horse - one control sample, and (four test samples) exposed to 12.5, 25, 50, 100 ppm of arsenic. The cells were embedded in LMAgarose and placed on slides. The slides were incubated in three different buffers that separated the DNA, unwound the DNA, and cleaned and neutralized the slides. The cells were electrophoresed, dried, stained and viewed using a fluorescent microscope. Multiple images were taken of slides of each concentration and analyzed. The results indicated that 100ppm of arsenic shattered an average of 82% of the cell nuclei and then the remaining nuclei were reduced in size by more than 60%. The greatest difference in the cellular nuclei was seen between samples at 25ppm and 50ppm.

Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies are unique. These diseases are contractible genetically, sporadically, or infectiously.

To analyze this organic behavior, dynamic simulation was employed. Molecular dynamics is a form of computer simulation which allows molecules to interact based on approximations of known physics.

Misfolded prions have a high denaturing temperature, more octarepeat regions, and a higher affinity for Cu2+. It is difficult to render the diseased proteins harmless.

This is further evidence that presence of Cu2+ may be a cause of misfolded prions being more easily transferred from animal to animal in the food chain.

A NOVEL APPROACH FOR DETERMINING NUCLEIC ACID STRUCTURE
Alexander Chow Mittal
Greenwich High School, Greenwich, Connecticut, USA

The recent development of nucleic acid analogues has been prompted by the promise of therapeutic applications and uses in biotechnology and nanotechnology. Before these molecules can be implemented effectively, their structures must be established. The novel technique presented here provides a means of determining nucleic acid structure. The method employs AFM (atomic force microscopy) to image a series of double crossover molecule arrays, with each array designed assuming a different number of base pairs per turn in the nucleic acid structure under investigation. Ordered array formation only occurs in the system that assumes the correct helical repeat. To apply the method, a model system was created using a natural and a nonnatural nucleic acid: DNA and PNA (peptide nucleic acid), respectively. With the method, a DNA-DNA duplex was observed to have ~10.5 base pairs per turn, and a PNA-DNA duplex was observed to have ~14 base pairs per turn, with both values closely matching structural data previously obtained using established techniques. The existing methods of structure determination—NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography—can be costly and time-consuming. The method of the current study can be used to determine the number of residues per turn of any Watson-Crick base pairing nucleic acid, providing an additional method for obtaining a better understanding of nucleic acid structure.

DNA REPAIR MECHANISMS: INVESTIGATIONS OF BASE EXCISION REPAIR PATHWAY IN DIFFERENTIATED AND PROLIFERATIVE NEURONAL CAD CELLS
April Pun
Jericho High School, Jericho, NY

Increased oxidative DNA damage in neuronal cells and deficiencies in DNA repair mechanisms are contributing factors to neurological disease development. The base excision repair (BER) pathway primarily corrects oxidative DNA damage hallmark in neurological diseases. Understanding the precise protein interactions and mechanisms of the BER pathway in nuclear (n) and mitochondrial (mt) DNA of differentiated neurons may help elucidate how DNA damage can accumulate to cause disease. Cath.A. Differentiated mouse neuroblastoma cells were used to examine DNA repair characteristics by comparing the degree of DNA protection and repair rate of induced H2O2 oxidative damage in mtDNA and nDNA via PCR. Significantly higher PCR product in DNA of differentiated neurons indicate decreased oxidative damage and faster repair rate than in DNA of proliferative cells, suggesting that newly differentiated neurons initially present more efficient repair mechanisms. mtDNA was found to be less resistant to oxidative damage as seen by the overall decrease of PCR product, possibly due to the lack of efficient repair mechanisms possessed by nDNA. An accumulation of oxidative damage in mtDNA may therefore play an essential role in the progression of neurological diseases. Increased band intensity in activity assays indicate increased FEN1 and DNA ligation activity in newly differentiated cells, demonstrating that LP-BER, rather than SP-BER, may be the chief repair pathway for oxidative DNA damage in differentiated neurons as FEN1 solely functions in LP-BER. Future investigations include analyzing BER protein activity associated with repair mechanisms in aged differentiated cells and in cells of neurological disease patients.<br><br>

THE SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF INNATE IMMUNITY INHIBITORS
Stacy Gail Feinsot
Lawrence High School, Cedarhurst New York, USA

A critical shortage of organ donors necessitates scientists to consider xenotransplantation, the art of transplanting organs of other species into humans. Xenotransplantation, however, triggers “hyperacute rejection” in the body, initiated by the complement system. Compstatin, a cyclic 13-amino acid peptide, was created to inhibit the C3 cascade of the complement system, but 152 ìM for 50% inhibition makes use costly.<br><br> This research created an analog of Compstatin by substituting 1-methyltryptophan (1MeW) into position 4 of the peptide, increasing the hydrophobicity just outside the â-turn, the binding site to C3. The seventh-position tryptophan was replaced on the â-turn with 5-fluorotryptophan (5fW) in the hope of increasing binding ability to C3. A second analog only substituted 1MeW into position 4.<br><br> Synthesized analogs were cyclized, cleaved of side chains, purified by HPLC, and molecular masses verified by mass spectroscopy; Enzyme Linked Immunosorbant Assay (ELISA) measured activity. Activity for analog 4(1MeW)7(5fW) was 220x greater than original Compstatin [IC50 of 0.70 ìM (SD 0.060)], while 4(1MeW) was 460x greater [IC50 of 0.34 ìM (SD 0.014)], creating highly effective complement inhibitors.<br><br>

BRAIN LEUCINE SENSING MODULATES THE RATE OF HEPATIC TRIGLYCERIDE SECRETION IN VIVO
Florence Xavia Kuhl
Ossining High School, Ossining, NY

Hypertriglyceridemia is a critical component of metabolic disorders including diabetes and obesity. This study investigated the regulation of hepatic triglyceride secretion by leucine in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) and examined the biochemical mechanism(s) activated by this amino acid to modulate TG metabolism. Previous results showed that the hypothalamic-sensing of leucine lowers circulating triglyceride (TG) levels. Two potential mechanisms are possible: 1) mTOR pathway activation by leucine, or 2) leucine metabolic flow. Intra-hypothalamic leucine caused a decrease in circulating triglycerides as well as in the rate of VLDL-TG secretion (p-value<0.01). At the same time, leucine caused a decrease in hepatic triglyceride concentrations. Coinfusion of rapamycin with leucine did not prevent the decrease in either plasma TG or the rate of VLDL-TG secretion (p-value=.01). By contrast, the coinfusion of leucine and aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), a potent inhibitor of leucine metabolism, blocked the inhibitory effects of leucine on the rate of triglyceride secretion and on hepatic TG content. Taken together, these results suggest that leucine’s effects on triglyceride metabolism are dependent on its own metabolism in the MBH and do not require mTOR activation. Overall these studies further our understanding of the regulation of triglyceride metabolism by nutrients and allow for further insight into the pathophysiology of dyslipidemia. Furthermore, molecular components of the mechanism delineated above constitute potential targets in the development of drugs for the treatment of dyslipidemia.

THE ROLE OF HSP-27 IN THE PROTECTION OF NA,K-ATPASE DURING SUBLETHAL ISCHEMIC INJURY AND SUBSEQUENT RECOVERY
Emily Frances Cersonsky
Sacred Heart Academy, Hamden, CT, U.S.A.

Sublethal ischemia in the porcine epithelial cells of the proximal tubule causes cytoskeletal damage which disrupts the cells’ crucial polar structure, causing displacement of membrane proteins. One such protein is Na,K-ATPase, an insoluble, active-transport pump which, during ischemia, becomes partially-solubilized in detergent and thus ineffectual as a transporter.<br><br>This experiment explored the hypothesis that human heat-shock protein HSP-27, which has shown protective effects during sublethal ischemia in human epithelial cells, could lessen cytoskeletal disruption and Na,K-ATPase solubilization during and after ischemia when transfected into porcine cells. Three HSP-27-transfected and one vector-transfected (control) cell lines were subjected to ischemia via a respiration-inhibiting injury-medium for two or four hours. Some samples were given injury-medium for two hours and allowed a subsequent recovery period in regular medium. A comparable control-medium was used in a control setup. Cells were harvested in detergent-containing buffer and the supernatants (containing the solubilized Na,K-ATPase) were isolated. After quantification and protein electrophoresis, Western blot analysis showed that in both the injury and recovery setups, there were much lighter bands for Na,K-ATPase in the supernatants of the HSP-27-transfected cell lines than the control cell line. Because HSP-27 was the only variable condition between the cell lines, these results evidenced that HSP-27 was the cause of the lessened solubilized Na,K-ATPase.<br><br>Renal-pathology applications of this research abound. Primarily, if a specific level of HSP-27 is found to be protective in vivo during ischemic injury, the protein may lend valuable assistance to porcine (and perhaps human) epithelial cells during renal-failure-induced ischemia.<br><br>

THE APPLICATION OF FOENICULUM VULGARE, GLYCYRRHIZA GLABRA, MATRICARIA RECUTITA, ULMUS RUBRA, AND ZINGIBER OFFICINALE, WITH RESPECT TO PREVACID AND A NAMED CACO3 IN THE CHEMICAL AMALGAMATION OF AN ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT OF GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE
Tonia Ann Gooden
Algonac High School, Algonac, MI

This experiment in its current structure investigates the creation of a biologically efficient environment through the usage of five different herbs, CaCO3, and Prevacid. The creation of the environment is with respect to pH, CO2 emissions, and pepsin activity, to provide a theoretically effective treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). <br><br> The research was carried out by mixing each substance individually with hydrochloric acid (.02M) and pepsin. Once mixed, the new solution's pH was measured again after 24 hours and compared to its original pH. CO2 emissions were measured to establish the efficiency of the breakdown of each herb. The efficiency of each substance was determined through the ranked combination of average pH change and average CO2 emissions. Contributing to the conclusions was also the known data that pepsin denatures at a pH of six.<br><br> CaCO3 was found to have the highest pHf-pHi and CO2, 3.810 pH and 1634.5 ppm respectively. But because it denatured the pepsin, it was deemed inefficient. Thus the Ulmus rubra provided the most efficient biological environment with an average pHf-pHi of .655 pH and an average CO2 of 1397.3 ppm, which rose above the other substances tested. The herb infused the acid with carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, which in turn produced byproducts of CO2 and H2O. These products helped reduce the acidity of the acid.<br><br> Thus, my data suggests that while CaCO3 is not conducive to a gastrointestinal tract, Ulmus rubra would provide a theoretical treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease.

AN EXAMINATION OF THE MEDICINAL VALUE OF ALOE BARBADENSIS MILLER (ALOE VERA) ON CELL POLIFERATION
Alix Beth Stelly
Catholic High School, New Iberia, LA 70560, USA

This project is an examination of the medicinal value of Aloe barbadensis miller (Aloe Vera) on cell proliferation. The purpose of this project was to determine if the topical application of Aloe Vera to bisected planaria would result in faster regeneration of the lost body part and to determine if the regeneration rate would be affected by increasing the concentration of Aloe Vera applied to the planaria.<br><br> An experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that treating regenerating planaria with Aloe Vera would increase the speed of regeneration. Aloe Vera was extracted directly from the plant leaves and made into solutions of 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% strengths (using spring water). Six planaria were bisected for each group and six for a control group. Each planaria half was placed in a petri dish and treated: 12 halves were placed in 25ml of 5% solution, 12 in 10% solution, 12 in 15% solution, and 12 in 20% solution. The 12 control planaria were placed in 25mL of spring water. The experiment spanned 15 days. The planaria were checked daily for development.<br><br> The results of the experiment supported the hypothesis. The results revealed that planaria treated with 5% solution regenerated 7% faster than the control. Planaria treated with 10% solution regenerated 20% faster, those in a 15% solution regenerated 34% faster, and those in a 20% regenerated 40% faster. A statistical analysis consisting of ANOVA and t-Tests showed the results of the experiment to be significant at p<.001 level. It was concluded that Aloe Vera does have an effect on cell proliferation, and that increasing the concentration caused the planaria to regenerate at a faster rate.<br><br> Aloe barbadensis miller does have medicinal value. Aloe Vera's well-known natural anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial action combined with its nutritional constituents seemed to promote cell growth and therefore healing.

THE MEMBRANE MUTATIONAL EFFECT CLASSIFIER (MMEC): A NOVEL STRUCTURE-BASED APPROACH TO PREDICTING THE FUNCTIONAL EFFECTS OF MUTATIONS IN MEMBRANE PROTEINS
Rebecca Faye Alford
Commack High School, Commack, NY

The study of how proteins fold and function is key to understanding the molecular basis of traits (phenotypes) in various genetic disorders. However, determining the effects of genetic variation on protein function is computationally challenging due to a large possible conformational search space protein structures explore when they fold. Proteins that are bound to the cell membrane are especially difficult to understand, as computational and experimental methods are not yet adapted to account for the membrane environment. Nonetheless, membrane proteins are critical to various cellular processes as well as to understanding the connection between protein structure and the resulting phenotype. This work describes the Membrane Mutational Effects Classifier (MMEC): a new computational method that predicts loss-of-function and silent phenotypes due to mutations in membrane proteins. To make predictions, the user provides a membrane protein structure model and optional list of mutations to classify. Using sequence- and protein structure-based features from the Rosetta Molecular Modeling Software, MMEC uses statistical inference methods to predict the resulting phenotype of a given mutation. Testing against a leave-out set demonstrated that MMEC consistently generates predictions with 93% accuracy at best. Therefore, by providing access to novel and previously difficult-to-obtain predictions, MMEC can further current research by improving understanding of the connection between protein structure, function and disease.

TARGETING LUNG MUTAGENESIS: MYCOSPORINE-LIKE AMINO ACIDS AS SCAVENGERS OF PAH O-QUINONE DERIVED ROS FOR THE REDUCTION OF P53 STRAND SCISSION AND MUTATION IN HUMAN LUNG CANCER
Ailis Clare Dooner
Carmel High School, Carmel, CA

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), potent procarcinogens in human lung cancer, are ubiquitous atmospheric pollutants found in tobacco smoke and incomplete combustion products. The aldo keto reductase-catalyzed activation of PAH generates redox-cycling o-quinones, BPQ, BAQ, and PNQ, and induces mutation in the p53 tumor suppressor gene. p53 is the most frequently mutated gene in lung cancer, and its mutation and inactivation initiate and maintain pulmonary malignancies. This study assesses the capacity of mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) Shinorine (SH) and Porphyra-334 (P-334), metabolites synthesized by macro- and microalgae, to scavenge o-quinone derived reactive oxygen species and reduce p53 mutation and strand scission. In algae, MAAs function as antioxidants by scavenging superoxide radicals and inhibiting lipid peroxidation. The efficacy of SH and P-334 was evaluated with a p53 mutagenesis assay, a yeast transcriptional reporter system; and a gel-electrophoresis strand scission assay. In the p53 mutagenesis assay, a yeast reporter strain was transfected with p53 plasmid treated with mutagen and MAAs in vitro. Wild-type p53 binds to the p21 promoter, activates an adenine reporter, and turns colonies white, while p53 mutated in the binding domain turns colonies red, allowing for quantification of o-quinone mutagenicity. SH and P-334 lowered mutational frequency by 59% with BPQ at 0.5 uM and 24% with BPQ at 0.25 uM, and significantly reduced shearing with o-quinones in the strand scission assay, supporting initial hypotheses. This study develops a novel biomedical application of MAAs in lung cancer pharmacology; based on my results, MAAs could be applied as a critical active ingredient in a pharmacological agent.

THE IDENTIFICATION OF A MYOSTATIN SIGNALING PATHWAY: AN IN VITRO STUDY OF MYOTUBE AND MYOBLAST RESPONSE
Marc Andrew Egerman
Ossining High School, Ossining, New York, United States

Myostatin is a secreted protein that negatively regulates skeletal muscle growth. Blockade of myostatin by genetic inactivation or injection of myostatin antibodies results in a significant increase in muscle mass. The activation of myostatin's receptors on a target cell leads to the phosphorylation and activation of the signaling proteins Smad 2 and 3, which translocate to the nucleus, activating target genes. However, other myostatin signaling components have yet to be discovered. Utilizing murine C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes, we examined gene transcriptional changes induced by myostatin treatment. Cells treated with myostatin for 24 hours at 37 degrees Celsius in 7.5% CO2 were harvested for RNA extraction and microarray transcriptional analysis. Twenty new genes were found to be regulated by myostatin. Among the transcriptional changes produced, myostatin induced a 1.83 fold up-regulation of an inhibitory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), 1.63 fold up-regulation of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and 1.61 fold down-regulation of proliferin 2 (PLF 2). This was of particular interest as PLF2 was previously shown to be up-regulated in IGF-1 induced hypertrophy. While IGF-1 and myostatin have opposite phenotypic effects, we found no evidence of cross-inhibition between the principal pathways activated by either factor; however opposing effects of IGF-I and myostatin were seen in the phosphorylation of Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK). The inhibition of the myostatin signaling pathway by chemically regulating certain genes identified in this study could lead to the development of pharmacological medications against muscle loss.

UNRAVELING THE FUNCTIONAL INTERACTION OF DJ-1, PINK1 AND PARKIN, MUTATED PROTEINS LINKED TO FAMILIAL FORMS OF PARKINSON'S DISEASE AND SET-UP OF A CELLULAR MODEL TO STUDY PINK1 MUTANT TOXICITY
Jessica Marie May
Northport High School, Northport, NY

In recent years mutations in genes, such as DJ-1, PINK1 and Parkin, have been identified that can be linked to neurodegeneration in both sporadic and familial cases of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, further investigation is required to elucidate the exact function of these genes and gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. It has been suggested that these genes play an important role in regulation of mitochondrial activity and that the interaction between PINK1, a mitochondrial kinase, and Parkin, an ubiquitin ligase, produces mitochondrial clustering in SHSY-5Y human neuroblastoma cells. The results from this project demonstrate that this mitochondrial clustering only occurs exclusively from the interaction of PINK1 and Parkin. However, the results also indicate the co-localization of Parkin and DJ-1 and of PINK1 and DJ-1 suggesting a possible interaction between these genes. In parallel to these experiments, the second aim of this project was to establish an in vitro model of familial PD to study how the PINK1 mutations: Dead Kinase, L347P, A217D, T313M and W437X may lead to neuronal death and neuron susceptibility to PD associated environmental toxins. This investigation will further the understanding of these genes’ function and determine if they are linked in a common pathway of PD pathogenesis.

This project was an experimentation of the effect of different stimulants on the growth of algae injected into plastic bubble wrap as a replica of the algae being processed into biofuel to make the earth more environmentally friendly . Algae is one of the fastest growing plants in the world, and about 50% of algae weight is oil. The lipid oil can be used to make biofuel for motor vehicles. The researcher collected data from the algae that was growing from her homemade algae bags also known as Vertigro. The designated supervisor handled a needle and injected the algae into 25 bubbles that the researcher assigned for the algae to be placed in. The algae was left to grow on its own for 10 days. On the 5th day 1ml of the bubble was ejected from each of the 25 bubbles to be looked at under a microscope. After looking at the algae under a microscope and counting the number of algae cells on each slide, she observed that lettuce had the most growth of algae. The remaining algae was left to grow another 5 days before getting the final results by counting the algae cells again. On the 10th day all the algae was observed under the microscope. The data showed that after the 10th day the cow manure produced the most algae.

METAL ION PREVENTION OF INSULIN FIBRIL FORMATION
Frances Loren Hubley
Woods Cross High School, Woods Cross, UT

Insulin stability is critical for diabetics. <br><br>Fiber formation degrades therapeutic insulin. Single insulin molecules are not stable and combine into small sheets that stack into fibers called Fibrils. Zn2+ ions bind insulin molecules together into hexamers of six molecule groups that are more stable. <br><br> <br><br>Because insulin is a folded protein molecule, the size of the ion might be responsible for fitting into the folds to pull the hexamer together. I hypothesized that Co2+ and Ni2+ ions might also provide protection to insulin as they are the same relative size as Zn2+ ions.<br><br> <br><br>I designed an experiment using the same molarity as the proven Zn2+ ion to make solutions of Co2+ and Ni2+ ions. <br><br> <br><br>One problem is that insulin for human use comes in vials with Zn2+ ions to stabilize it.<br><br>I needed to chelate these added Zn2+ ions before I could then determine if Co2+ and Ni2+ ions would also provide protection.<br><br> <br><br>A series of EDTA titrations using Murexide and Eriochrome BlackT, was used to determine the chelation solution strength to “cloak” the vial delivered Zn2+ ions. <br><br>A pH of 3 and an incubation temperature of 68°C for 90 minutes was used to form fibrils. Turbidimetric and fluourometric methods were used to assay fibril formation. Thioflavin T in a 15 molar excess was used to bind to fibrils and show fluorescence.<br><br>The results of my experiment supported my hypothesis:<br><br>Cobalt and Nickel ions prevent insulin fibril formation. <br><br> <br><br>Designing an improved shelf life insulin molecule is a direct application.

ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY OF DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS DETERMINED BY RADICAL SCAVENGING AND CATALASE ACITIVITY
Megan Elizabeth McKay
South Pemiscot, Steele Missouri, USA

Recently, natural foods and food-derived antioxidants such as Selenium, Pycogenol, Green tea, Green tea extract, Grapeseed extract, and Co-Q10 have received attention because they are known to function as chemo-preventive agents against oxidative damage. The purpose of this project was to investigate the effects of antioxidants on the activity of the oxidative enzyme catalase from calf liver peroxisomes and explore antioxidant activity of dietary supplements through radical scavenging. If antioxidants are increased then the activity of the catalase enzyme will increase. The catalase can then breakdown more hydrogen peroxide and prevent cell damage from oxidative stress which trigger the production of reactive compounds that cause cellular damage. This study was designed to measure the enzyme activity with elevated levels of antioxidants. Calf liver was homogenized and used as a source of catalase. Antioxidants were added to the reactants and the activity rate of the enzyme compared for each antioxidant tested. Antioxidant assay using ABTS(2,2’-azino-di-(3-ethybenzthiazoline sulphonate)) was used to determine activity of dietary supplements ability to protect against attack by reactive oxygen. The assay measured the ability of the antioxidants to inhibit the oxidation of ABTS(2,2’-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulphonate)) to ABTS+by HRP(horseradish peroxidase enzyme) and expressed as vitamin C equivalent antioxidant capacities(VCEAC).The antioxidants tested increased the activity of the Catalase enzyme. Selenium increased the activity by 39%, green tea extract by 33% and Co-Q 10 increased the activity by 26%. There was a 0.839 correlation coefficient between antioxidant activity and Catalase increase. The results indicate that catalase oxidative enzyme activity can be increased with selected antioxidants, which reduces the hydrogen peroxide levels in the cells thus protecting the cell against damage from free radicals.

A COMPARISION OF ESCHERICHIA COLI AND SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE AS A FUEL SOURCE FOR A MICROBIAL FUEL CELL
Wesley Randel Hargraves
South Pemiscot High School, Steele, MO, U.S.A.

A (MFC) converts the energy produced by the metabolism of an organism’s food into electrical current. The organisms store electrons as intermediates which will become reduced, and in this state are use to fuel the reactions that provide a cell with energy. The electrons may be diverted by an oxidation-reduction reaction mediator that transports the electrons to an electrode that will become the negative electrode. This circuit can then be completed by adding a positive electrode. When this circuit is complete the cell can produce electricity. The length of time that a biological fuel cell can generate electricity is dependent only on the amount of fuel available to the organisms. The purpose of this project was to create and compare the fuel cells with mixtures of fuel (glucose, sucrose, or levulose); methylene blue, and yeast or Escherichia coli was put in one side of the fuel cell. Separated by a Cation Exchange Membrane, potassium hexacyanoferrate (III) was put in the other side. Two alligator clips are attached to the electrodes and were hooked to a Vernier Logger Pro/Voltage Probe to measure the voltage and graph the results. To compare the capability of E.Coli and yeast to produce energy each was put into the fuel cell with each sugar (glucose, sucrose, or levulose). The results were then graphed and compared. The voltage produced by E.Coli was consistently higher than that produced by yeast. The voltage produced varied from .25 volts to .54 volts. With these results, a usable amount of electricity could be produced by connecting a series of cells together. MFC’s currently represent the most likely technology upon which to base food energy conversions. Many challenges remain to be addressed in the development of the MFC and the ways it is used in technology. <br><br>

Recently, natural foods and food-derived antioxidants such as Selenium, Pycogenol, Green tea, Green tea extract, Grapeseed extract, and Co-Q10 have received attention because they are known to function as chemo-preventive agents against oxidative damage. The purpose of this project was to investigate the effects of antioxidants on the activity of the oxidative enzyme catalase from calf liver peroxisomes and explore antioxidant activity of dietary supplements through radical scavenging. If antioxidants are increased then the activity of the catalase enzyme will increase. The catalase can then breakdown more hydrogen peroxide and prevent cell damage from oxidative stress which trigger the production of reactive compounds that cause cellular damage. This study was designed to measure the enzyme activity with elevated levels of antioxidants. Calf liver was homogenized and used as a source of catalase. Antioxidants were added to the reactants and the activity rate of the enzyme compared for each antioxidant tested. Antioxidant assay using ABTS(2,2’-azino-di-(3-ethybenzthiazoline sulphonate)) was used to determine activity of dietary supplements ability to protect against attack by reactive oxygen. The assay measured the ability of the antioxidants to inhibit the oxidation of ABTS(2,2’-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulphonate)) to ABTS+by HRP(horseradish peroxidase enzyme) and expressed as vitamin C equivalent antioxidant capacities(VCEAC).The antioxidants tested increased the activity of the Catalase enzyme. Selenium increased the activity by 39%, green tea extract by 33% and Co-Q 10 increased the activity by 26%. There was a 0.839 correlation coefficient between antioxidant activity and Catalase increase. The results indicate that catalase oxidative enzyme activity can be increased with selected antioxidants, which reduces the hydrogen peroxide levels in the cells thus protecting the cell against damage from free radicals.

A (MFC) converts the energy produced by the metabolism of an organism’s food into electrical current. The organisms store electrons as intermediates which will become reduced, and in this state are use to fuel the reactions that provide a cell with energy. The electrons may be diverted by an oxidation-reduction reaction mediator that transports the electrons to an electrode that will become the negative electrode. This circuit can then be completed by adding a positive electrode. When this circuit is complete the cell can produce electricity. The length of time that a biological fuel cell can generate electricity is dependent only on the amount of fuel available to the organisms. The purpose of this project was to create and compare the fuel cells with mixtures of fuel (glucose, sucrose, or levulose); methylene blue, and yeast or Escherichia coli was put in one side of the fuel cell. Separated by a Cation Exchange Membrane, potassium hexacyanoferrate (III) was put in the other side. Two alligator clips are attached to the electrodes and were hooked to a Vernier Logger Pro/Voltage Probe to measure the voltage and graph the results. To compare the capability of E.Coli and yeast to produce energy each was put into the fuel cell with each sugar (glucose, sucrose, or levulose). The results were then graphed and compared. The voltage produced by E.Coli was consistently higher than that produced by yeast. The voltage produced varied from .25 volts to .54 volts. With these results, a usable amount of electricity could be produced by connecting a series of cells together. MFC’s currently represent the most likely technology upon which to base food energy conversions. Many challenges remain to be addressed in the development of the MFC and the ways it is used in technology. <br><br>

ASSESSING GLYXIN-13 AS A NEUROPROTECTANT IN ORGANOTYPIC HIPPOCAMPAL CELL CULTURES
Jenny Isabel Aguilar
Sleepy Hollow High School, Sleepy Hollow, NY, USA

The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptor plays a central role in gating influx of Ca2+ into neurons, long-term activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and excitoxicity in the central nervous system. The influx of Ca2+ at differing magnitudes through the NMDA channel is critical for the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD) and many forms of learning. Excessive Ca2+ influx can cause neuronal damage and death—leading to reductions in plasticity and loss of neurons, which could be responsible for the progressive cognitive dysfunction that is a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and other neurodegenerative diseases. <br><br>I examined intact slices of rodent hippocampus that retain in vitro a network of connections and cellular environment similar to the whole animal, testing the ability of Glyxin-13 to protect hippocampal neurons from oxygen-glucose deprivation(OGD)-induced delayed neuronal death. I hypothesized that Glyxin-13, a tetrapeptide (TPPT-amide) that acts as a partial agonist at the glycine site of the NMDA receptor, could effectively support a more physiological balance of Ca2+ influx that is essential for learning and memory, while simultaneously protecting neurons from damage. I found that Glyxin-13 is able to protect neurons from delayed neuronal death induced by OGD, and that this action is dependent on its binding to the NMDA receptor at the glycine site. <br><br>

INVESTIGATION OF FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE THERMOSTABILITY OF ALPHA-AMYLASE
James Nan Zhang
Lexington High School, Lexington, MA

Protein thermostability is important in the study of protein function. The mechanisms that drive the folding and maintenance of the folded structure of polypeptide chains are only generally understood and mostly remain a mystery. Understanding the specific molecular interactions and factors governing protein stability will have a great impact on protein engineering and the development of powerful molecular biology tools and industrial enzymes.<br><br>Homologous proteins from organisms growing in different temperature ranges provide good examples for studying protein thermostability. Proteins from cold, temperate, and hot temperature ranges have very different thermostability. In this study, the inter-atomic distances within each of four homologous alpha-amylases were analyzed to explore their relationship with thermostability. It was hypothesized that protein inter-atomic distances dictate the proteins’ energy and thus are a determining factor of folded structural stability.<br><br>The crystal structural data of these selected proteins was used to conduct these analyses. Atom-atom interactions were categorized into three types: first, the atom-atom interactions within the same amino acid residue for all residues in the protein (‘X-X’ interactions), second, the atom-atom interactions between immediate neighboring residues in the primary structure (‘X-Y’ interactions), third, the remaining interactions (‘A-X’ interactions), which involve atoms between non-neighboring residues. <br><br>It was found that atom-atom distances correlate well with protein thermostability. The A-X atom-atom interactions correlated the best, and X-X interactions also showed significant correlations with thermostability. However, X-Y interactions showed little correlation. The strong A-X and X-X trends demonstrate that atom-atom distances can be used to predict relative thermostability among homologous proteins.

PERCENT CONSERVATION OF THE HUMAN INSULIN SIGNALING PATHWAY VS. CNS DEVELOPMENT IN LOWER ORGANISMS (CONTINUED)
Kathleen Curley Clement
Langley High School, McLean VA, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to study and to better understand the relationship between the evolution of the human insulin signaling pathway and the evolution of the Central Nervous System (CNS). I hypothesized that the percent conservation of the selected peptides in the insulin signaling pathway would model the same gradient-like loss of percent conservation as the average percent conservation of the peptides predominately expressed in the CNS. The revolutionary aspect of this project is that it was all completed online using protein knowledgebases and pair-wise sequence alignment tools. First, I found the human protein sequence and its homologues in the Swiss-prot/TrEMBL protein knowledgebase. Then, I found the percent conservation using LALIGN, an online pairwise sequence alignment tool. I proved my hypothesis valid, because all of the selected insulin signaling peptides favored the gradient-like loss of percent conservation modeled by the CNS-linked peptides except for Akt1-3 and the Insulin Receptor. The peptides AKT1-3 were irregular, but that can easily be explained because AKT 1-3 are necessary for cell survival and it plays a major role in many other signaling pathways that are independent of insulin action. Also I proved that there was a significant difference in the gradient-loss of percent conservation between the non CNS-linked peptides and the CNS-linked peptides. In this experiment I concluded that the insulin signaling pathway did evolve with the Central Nervous System, and the evolution of the insulin signaling cascade might have been a prerequisite for CNS development.

STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THE CYTOSKELETON IN RESPONSE TO MYOSIN INHIBITORS
Cynthia Yin
Westlake High School, Westlake Village, CA

For cancer, diabetes, neurodegeneration, and other diseases, myosin inhibitors offer potential prevention and treatment by blocking cell migration. Myosin inhibitors reduce signaling by non-muscle myosin II (NMII), myosin-light chain kinase (MLCK), and Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK). These signaling pathways play significant roles in disease development.<br><br> Cytoskeletal structure is regulated by NMII, MLCK and ROCK. The inhibitors in my experiment included Blebbistatin, ML-7, and Y-27632. Blebbistatin inhibits NMII and bleb formation by lowering the affinity of myosin with actin, and altering contractile forces that impinge on the cytoskeleton-membrane interface. ML-7 and Y-27632 inhibit MLCK and ROCK, respectively. MLCK and ROCK phosphorylate myosin light chain in order to bind myosin to actin filaments as well as induce muscle contraction. ROCK also maintains central stress fibers.<br><br> Y-27632 was hypothesized to be the most effective in reducing cytoskeletal integrity, because it affects central stress fibers. I also hypothesized that higher drug concentrations would weaken the cytoskeleton the most, because it would increase inhibition of tubulin and actin expression. In my experiments to evaluate the effects of myosin inhibitors on cytoskeletons, vascular endothelial cells (ATCC CRL-1733) were treated with Blebbistatin, ML-7, and Y-27632. Cells were immunostained with antibodies. Thereafter, cytoskeletal integrity was analyzed with fluorescence microscopy.<br><br> My results support my hypothesis that Y-27632 is the most effective in weakening cytoskeletons. However, my hypothesis that high drug concentrations weakened cytoskeletons was partially supported. This indicates that the optimal drug concentration to reduce cytoskeletal integrity may be a combination of drugs.

FOOD DYES
Victoria Thanh Nhan
Taconic High School, Pittsfield, MA

Colorful foods, whether created naturally or synthetically, are attractive to consumers. However inviting, synthetic food dyes may cause health problems in humans such as cancer and ADHD. This experiment compares the physiological effects synthetic food dyes and extracted natural food dyes have on Daphnia magna heart rate. It was thought that synthetic food dyes would increase the heart rate, where as natural food dyes would not. The natural dyes, dissolved in pond water, were extracted from beets, yellow squash, blueberries, and spinach. A spectrophotometer was set to a specific wavelength to analyze the concentrations of synthetic and extracted dyes.<br><br> <br><br> Heart rate was determined by placing Daphnia in specific concentrations of dye for one minute and then counting the beats per minute. The 10% synthetic yellow dye solution produced the highest average heart rate (188 beats/minute). The 1% natural green dye produced the lowest average (160.4 beats/minute), similar to the pond water control (164 beats/ minute). All solutions of synthetic dyes increased the average beats/minute compared to the control and natural dyes.<br><br> <br><br> In a Lethal Dose 50 (LD50) test, Daphnia were placed in beakers of the natural and synthetic food dyes for 24 hours. The Daphnia from the beakers of synthetic dye had 60% to 100% mortality, where as the Daphnia from beakers of the natural food dye had 0% to 30% mortality. The concentrations with the lowest percentages of deaths are the 100%, 10% and 1% natural greens. The concentration with the highest mortality rate of 100%, is the 100% synthetic red.<br><br> To further this study, testing of synthetic versus natural food dyes could be conducted on another type of organism.

THE APPLICATION OF POTENTIOMETRIC RESPONSE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A BIOSENSOR FOR ANTHRAX-CAUSING BACILLUS ANTHRACIS SPORES
Shirin Bajaj
Syosset High School, Syosset, NY

After September 11th 2001 and the Anthrax-attacks later that month, the value of an accurate biosensor able to detect biological and chemical agents has burgeoned. Although biosensors are commercially available today, all are large expensive, or require sophisticated, relatively time-consuming, and often extensive analysis procedures. The experimental goal was to create a biosensor that could potentially detect harmful pathogenic agents by monitoring the interactions between antibody and antigen. By monitoring the change in net charge upon the combination of an antibody and antigen using potentiometric response, a highly effective immunosensor was created for detection purposes. At first, the system was optimized to detect a model antigen (using antibody Chrompure rabbit IgG and antigen Fluorescein Affinipure Goat Anti-Rabbit). The biosensor was able to detect antigen in the system even when the ratio of antibody to antigen concentration was as low as 1:1000. Finally the biosensor was tested and was accurately able to detect both Bacillus Anthracis and closely-related Bacillus Cereus spores. Future research includes optimizing the system to being able to detect smaller concentrations of these spores, and testing the system with various other pathogens. This biosensor has the leading edge over others on the market because when applied to a laboratory, detection is extremely rapid (taking a split second), inexpensive, and highly sensitive.

COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS OF CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE SUBSTRATES IN SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE LEADS TO A NOVEL COMPUTATIONAL IDENTIFICATION MECHANISM
Manjinder Singh Kandola
Queens High School for the Sciences at York College, Jamaica, NY

Understanding the cell cycle is crucial to advances in fields such as cancer therapy, stem cell replication, and embryonic development. The cell cycle is governed by cyclins, which activate cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) and thus guide the cell cycle through proper substrate phosphorylation. Despite their importance, Cdk substrates likely remain unidentified. This study creates novel computational methods for Cdk1 substrate identification in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. First, computational software was used to analyze previously pre-dicted substrates of Cdk1 to determine significant structural patterns. Extensive analysis of data suggested the clustering of potential Cdk1 binding sites found on the surface of a protein. To manipulate this characteristic, an original computer program was written using Perl scripting language to apply all 6736 protein sequences in budding yeast to an algorithm that would score proteins based on consensus motif clustering. Results were validated through comparison with an identically scored mock proteome consisting of randomly generated protein sequences. In addition, when high scoring proteins were aligned across taxa, most clusters were conserved, suggesting a functional mechanism underlying consensus motif clustering. Finally, comparison with previous studies indicated that high scoring proteins are indeed efficient in vitro substrates. This study advances Cdk1 substrate analysis by computationally predicting Cdk1 substrates which can be verified experimentally in the future and indicates broader applications for future substrate prediction.

MAMMALIAN CELL PRODUCTION OF MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES IN SIMULATED MICROGRAVITY
Joia Ramchandani, Greenwich High School
Greenwich CT, U.S.A.

This investigation explored the effects of simulated microgravity (SMG) on mammalian cell production of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Objectives included a) gaining insight into the feasibility of applying SMG to commercial antibody production, and b) addressing the concern that the human immune system, particularly its capacity for antibody production, might be inhibited by the microgravity conditions of space. A rotary cell culture system (RCCS) that simulates microgravity was used to culture hybridoma cells producing Immunoglobulin G (IgG). The RCCS was rotated at three different angles to the gravity vector (0°, 30°, and 90°). At 0° and 90°, the RCCS simulates normal gravity and microgravity, respectively. Each culture was continued for 8 days. <br><br>Cell growth and MAb production were monitored daily via trypan blue cell exclusion and HPLC. Maximum viable cell density reached 4.9, 2.6, and 0.77 x 10^6 cells/mL at 0°, 30°, and 90°respectively. Specific (per cell) MAb production rates averaged 0.80, 0.61, and 1.03 pg/cell-h at 0°, 30°, and 90°. The specific MAb production rate witnessed under SMG was 28% higher than the rate achieved under normal gravity. These results suggest that microgravity has a negative effect on cell growth, but a positive effect on specific antibody production. <br><br>These findings are promising because they show that SMG holds the potential to improve current methods of antibody production. Additionally, findings demonstrate that immune system cell growth could be depressed in the microgravity environment of space, underscoring the need to develop treatments that will strengthen the immune system for extended space travel. <br><br>

MORE THAN A KERNEL OF TRUTH: CORRELATION OF EFFECTS OF TIME AND TEMPERATURE ON STARCH AND SUGAR IN SWEET CORN
Rachel Leigh Siegel
Cedar Crest High School, Lebanon, PA, USA

Quality and freshness of sweet corn is of major concern to consumers and commercial growers, warranting scientific scrutiny. The effects of time and temperature on starch and glucose levels in sweet corn were studied. Further emphasis was placed on the correlation between glucose and starch levels. Conditions were created to simulate storage in exceptionally hot conditions, in refrigerated conditions, and in room temperature conditions. Fresh corn was used as a control to which the three treatments were compared. It was hypothesized that glucose levels would be highest after a longer time in high temperatures while starch levels would be low. In cool temperatures, the starch level would be high, while glucose levels are low. As time goes on at low temperatures, the amount of glucose will increase more slowly than the rapid increase occurring in warmer temperatures. Nevertheless, it was hypothesized that the amount of glucose and the relative amount of starch should be in an inverse relationship, whatever the temperature of storage treatment.<br><br> In general, the experimental data support the hypothesis. The higher the treatment temperature, the lower the amount of starch and the higher amount of glucose were found in the treated sample as compared to the control. ANOVA tests revealed that only oven treatment produces statistically significant data; the other treatment groups do not, regardless of time of treatment. No identifiable numerical correlation was found; one may exist between starch and other corn sugars. Practical applications for the consumer, the commercial grower, and sellers are discussed. <br><br>

QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF PICOGREEN AND HOECHST 33258 BINDING DISCREPANCIES TO ANIMAL, PHAGE AND PLANT DNA
Kristina Yifei Yang
Montgomery Blair High School, Silver Spring MD, USA

With genetically modified crops becoming increasingly important in the worldwide agricultural industry, the need for an accurate method of quantitating plant-based DNA has become apparent. Currently, the dsDNA-binding fluorophores PicoGreen and Hoechst 33258 are frequently used to quantitate DNA samples. PicoGreen uses lambda-phage DNA as a standard, while Hoechst uses calf thymus DNA as a standard. Previous studies have shown that these standards can be used to accurately quantify other animal- and phage-based DNA samples, but the accuracy of these standards in quantitating plant-based DNA is unknown. This study compared the binding strength of PicoGreen and Hoechst 33258 to calf thymus, lambda-phage, corn, and soybean DNA samples. It found that both fluorophores bind up to twice as strongly to calf thymus or phage standard DNA as to corn or soy DNA of similar nucleotide quantity. This indicates that using calf thymus or phage DNA as a standard for fluorophore-based quantitation of plant-based DNA greatly underestimates the amount of DNA in the plant sample, and the development of a new plant-based DNA standard is recommended to ensure the accurate quantitation of plant DNA in the future.

CAFFEINE: WHAT'S IN YOUR DRUGS? AN ANALYSIS OF CAFFEINE CONCENTRATION IN OVER THE COUNTER PAIN RELIEVERS
Jennifer Lee Nagel
Dekalb High School, Auburn IN, United States of America

This experiment is the product of quantitative experimentation regarding the caffeine concentration in over the counter pain relievers. It was designed to explore the probability of correctly determining the amount of caffeine contained in the medications. <br><br> This experiment involves creating a standard curve to compare with unknown concentrations. A solution of caffeine dissolved in methanol (10,000 ppm), diluted into 100, 80, 40, 20, and 10ppm solutions created the standard solutions. One tablet of each sample, with unknown caffeine concentration, is ground and then dissolved in methanol and filtered. Each sample is then brought to a 10ml volume. Running each standard through a GC-MS system accompanied with data analysis software creates a calibration curve. After a calibration curve is formatted, the unknown samples are then run to determine the caffeine concentration. <br><br> The results of this experiment found the caffeine concentration at 24.4ppm per Anacin tablet, 58.2ppm per Excedrin tablets, 34.91ppm per Vanquish tablet, and .5ppm per Tylenol tablet. The Aleve tablet contained no traces of caffeine. The results were different from the concentrations listed by the drug manufacturers. This margin of error has given new possibilities to experiment again with more accurate results. This experiment has created an accurate method of determining caffeine concentration: therefore allowing further experimentation regarding unknown caffeine concentrations and also the possibility studying caffeine’s effect on the body, including possible alterations in genetic structure. <br><br>

WHICH KIND OF YOGURT,COMMERCIAL COW YOGURT, COMMERCIAL GOAT YOGURT, HOMEMADE COW MILK YOGURT, HOMEMADE GOAT MILK YOGURT, OR GOAT MILK YOGURT CONSUMED FROM GOATS DIRECTLY HAS THE BEST SHELF LIFE AND STABILITY ACCORDING TO PROTEOLYSIS AND LIPOLYSIS?
Namrata Sabrina Buxani
Houston County High School, Warner Robins, GA

If I test homemade goat and cow yogurt, commercial cow and goat yogurt, and consumed yogurt from goats, for proteolysis and lipolysis, then the Dannon yogurt will have the best stability, breaking down slower than the other yogurts. <br><br>1)Make yogurt using correct method 2)Calculate Acid Degree value:Place 20mL of yogurt in each Babcock bottle;Add 10mL of BDI reagant and mix;Place bottles in boiling water and mix once;Remove bottles and centrifuge for 1 minute; Add methyl alcohol to bring fat column down;centrifuge again;Place in waterbath;Transfer 1mL of fat from each test bottle to a flask and add fat solvent.Titrate to first color change with KOH solution and make a blank titration;Calculate ADV 3)Babcock test:Adujst sample to right temperature an pipette 17.6mL of sample of milk in a bottle;After active flow has ceased, blow out all drops;Hold the bottle at an angle and add sulfuric acid;Shake on mechanical shaker;Place in centrifuge;Stop and add deionized water until liquid column comes to the top of the scale;Transfer to waterbath;Remove and measure fat column4)Calculate pH5)Do dry and ash matter6)Do texture analyzer 7)WSN: Measure 10gms of sample and add 40ml of water and mix in shaker;Pour into bottle;Place in waterbath;Transfer to centrifuge for 30min;Filter and freeze;Calculate protein breakdown. <br><br>My hypothesis was disproved because of the ADV value results.Dannon and goat broke down easier than the other yogurts.With texture commercial products has a higher firmness but at the end of the project, the firmness of all yogurts equaled out so the commercial products weren't really better.The commercial products had less dry matter meaning they had more water content which is a bad thing.The home yogurts had less ash matter,so less added chemicals which is a good.

DOG GONE POOP
Amber Samantha Marie Harris
Franklin High School, El Paso, TX

The purpose of my experiment is to see which enzymes: anylase, maltase, papain, xylanase, and bromelain, will degrade dog feces the best and fastest, as well as what the end result is in order to create a product that can safely degrade dog feces. The category of my experiment is biological chemistry. The hypothesis of my experiment is that maltase will degrade the dog feces the least. Both papain and bromelain will break down the feces the best with papain being slightly better. Xylanase will come in behind the two enzymes. The digestive enzyme amylase will be least effective, next to maltase. <br><br>I tested my hypothesis by taking feces samples of each of my three different dogs and placing them in water enzyme solutions. After a week I compared the weight of the solution to the original weight and then I burned the solution and compared the burned weight to both the pre-burn and original weight.<br><br>My results both agreed and disagreed with my hypothesis. All the enzymes did degrade the feces, with papain degrading them the most, but anylase wound up degrading the feces the least not maltase. After a week, there was a decrease in weight of the solutions but after they were burned the weight increased, weighing more than they did before being burned, but still weighing less than their original weights. My experiment yielded good results and gave me a base on which to create my feces degrading solution.

DETECTION AND ANALYSIS OF POINT MUTATIONS OF THE OXIDATIVE VARIETY IN THE K-RAS GENE
Charles Preston Blakemore
Academy for Math, Engineering and Science, Salt Lake City, UT

Mutations around codon 12 of the human K-ras gene are linked to forms of epithelial lung and pancreatic cancer. This study analyzed quantification, through standard additions, of mutations in a short section of the K-ras gene, centered around codon 12. It was hypothesized that some mutated portion of a population of DNA could be quantified by comparing binding frequencies of both mutated and wild-type biotinylated DNA-Streptavidin complexes interacting with alpha-hemolysin, a protein pore. A lipid bilayer was created across a glass nanopore (~1000 nm radius). Alpha-hemolysin channels were inserted into this bilayer and DNA-Streptavidin complexes were introduced to the cis side of the protein. Applied potential forced strands of DNA into alpha-hemolysin and the Biotin-Streptavidin anchor immobilized DNA within the pore. Ionic current past the immobilized DNA was measured and displayed different values depending on the identity of the base, either G or Gh, at the w14 position which is a very specific constriction point within the barrel of alpha-hemolysin. Standard additions were then used to analyze the binding behavior of these complexes, with respect to concentration, as well as detect and quantify mutated strands in a population of DNA. Standard additions proved successful in creating very linear calibration curves for use in predicting, through extrapolation, some initial presence of DNA in a system by plotting number of binding events against the residual current through a blocked alpha-hemolysin channel. Initial "unknown" presence of two strands was also determined through extrapolation of separate calibration curves in an experiment with both mutated and wild-type strands. Such a quantification method could be used to diagnose specific cancers or other diseases.

ANTIGEN-BINDING EFFICIENCY IN BOVINE CD1B3: COMPUTATIONAL LIGAND DOCKING OF PLASMODIUM FALCIPARUM GLYCOSYLPHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL FOR MALARIAL INTERVENTION
Rosalie Shinwei Doerksen
Oxford High School, Oxford, MS

Malaria, a devastating disease transmitted to victims through mosquitoes by Plasmodium parasites, runs rampant in tropical regions of the world. The eradication of malaria in England at the end of the nineteenth century can be attributed to the expansion of cattle herding in the country’s fertile pasturelands. Mosquitoes preferentially fed on cattle, but Plasmodium sporozoites were unable to survive the bovine immune system attacks, and this quickly terminated the Plasmodium life cycle.<br><br> This study examined lipid-antigen binding capabilities of the protein CD1B3, a complement antigen-presenting protein present in the immune system, albeit with a different amino acid sequence in cattle versus humans. The differing compositions of bovine CD1b3 and human CD1b3 may explain how cattle defeat the protozoal infection. <br><br> The published crystal structure of boCD1B3 contains the lipid phosphatidylcholine. I removed phosphatidylcholine and in its place docked a lipid antigen produced by P. falciparum with a similar structure to PC, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI). This required drawing its structure into Schrödinger Maestro software, minimization with MacroModel, and docking with Glide software. After running 30 different docking calculations, I was successfully able to position GPI into the C’ terminus of boCD1b3.<br><br> Showing that GPI is able to dock with boCD1b3 proves under the specified computational conditions my hypothesis that a bovine protein is able to detect the presence of malaria-carrying parasites in the bovine body.

CURCUMIN INDUCES APOPTOSIS IN CANCER CELLS BY INHIBITING NF-KB
Anartya Mandal
Boston Latin School, Boston, MA

The purpose of this study is to uncover the cancer-therapeutic potential and molecular mechanism(s) of action of curcumin, a natural, non-toxic, anti-inflammatory compound of an Indian spice, turmeric. Curcumin has been suggested from epidemiological studies to reduce the risk of developing cancer. Curcumin was shown to inhibit the activation of NF-kB, a transcription factor found activated in response to inflammation and in many cancers. Activation of NF-kB drives cancer cell proliferation and resists apoptosis. Mice, deficient in p65 subunit of NF-kB, die at embryonic stage due to massive apoptosis. Therefore, it was hypothesized that curcumin induces apoptosis in cancer cells by inhibiting NF-kB. <br><br>To test this hypothesis in vitro, various established cancer cell lines were simultaneously treated with varying concentrations of curcumin for 24 hours and their nuclei were stained with DAPI, a nuclear stain, to examine curcumin-induced nuclear condensation or fragmentation by fluorescence microscopy. To examine the effect of curcumin on NF-kB activation, endogenous constitutive and lipopolysaccharide-induced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA and protein levels were compared between curcumin or NF-kB-specific inhibitor (PDTC)-treated and untreated cancer and normal cells using RT-PCR, QPCR and immuno-blotting techniques. Interestingly, curcumin and PDTC produced similar results in inducing apoptosis only in cancer cells but not in normal macrophages. Both curcumin and PDTC inhibited constitutive and inducible COX-2 gene expression. <br><br>Therefore, curcumin-induced apoptosis in cancer cells is most likely due to the inhibition of NF-kB activation that awaits further confirmation.

CHARACTERIZATION OF THE ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA PLSP1-1 AND PLSP1-2 LINES: TOC75 SUGGESTS A NOVEL PROTEIN TARGETING PATHWAY
Vinay Tripuraneni
Clovis West High School, Fresno, CA, USA

Toc75 forms the only known protein translocation channel in the chloroplast outer envelope membrane, and is thus crucial to plastid biogenesis. Toc75 is an unusual transmembrane protein in that it has two transit peptides; most membrane targeted proteins have none. A type 1 signal peptidase, Plsp1, is proposed to cleave the second transit peptide. When PLSP1 is disrupted/knocked out with a tDNA insertion in the fourth intron, plants of the line, plsp1-1, exhibit a pale phenotype with underdeveloped chloroplasts. However, when the same gene is disrupted with a tDNA insertion in the first exon, plants of the line, plsp1-2, exhibit a phenotype similar to the wild type plants. The tDNA insertion portion of plsp1-2 was sequenced, and found to be immediately after the first methionine of the Plsp1 sequence. Because the beginning of Plsp1 has more than one methionine, interrupting the first methionine may not cause a knockout of PLSP1. This was examined by reverse-transcriptase mediated PCR, which revealed that the plsp1-2 plants homozygous for the tDNA insertion are transcribing PLSP1. Immunoblotting and chloroplast import in Pisum savitum of Toc75 suggests that Plsp1 is the protease responsible for cleaving the second transit peptide of Toc75. This evidence suggests a novel protein targeting pathway where Toc75 enters the chloroplast and inserts itself into the membrane from the inside of the organelle. This pathway has great ramifications; it may serve as a model for more sensitive tests for genetic illnesses, and may also help with understanding various peroxisomal and mitochondrial biogenesis disorders.

PROTEIN ASSAY ALTERNATIVES
Philippe Alexandre Chlenski
Lincoln Park High School, Chicago, IL

Purpose: Melamine’s ability to falsify results of a standard protein assay was exploited to manipulate quality of milk products with disastrous consequences for public health. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the activity of a milk enzyme, Xanthine Oxidase, can be measured as a more reliable alternative to a standard protein assay.<br><br>Procedure: Xanthine Oxidase activity in milk was measured at different time points to determine optimal conditions of measurement. Different dilutions of milk were probed to determine sensitivity of the assay. Melamine and structurally similar compounds, Glycine, Urea, Pyridine, Pyrimidine and Triazide were added to the diluted milk. Enzyme activity and protein concentration were determined with Xanthine Oxidase and BCA protein assays. Specific activity of Xanthine Oxidase was calculated as a ratio of enzyme activity to protein concentration, determined by BCA assay. All experiments were done in triplicates and evaluated by t-test.<br><br>Data: Xanthine Oxidase activity accurately measured milk dilutions up to tenfold, and was not affected by Melamine and other chemicals. Milk concentrations determined by a standard protein assay were affected by Melamine, but not other nitrogen-rich chemicals. Specific activity of Xanthine Oxidase was dramatically reduced when Melamine was added to milk (1.0 ± 0.23 (Melamine) vs. 3.9 ± 0.26 (Control), P = 0.01).<br><br>Conclusions: Xanthine Oxidase activity measurements were proven accurate and more reliable than protein concentration measurements. A combination of these two methods is recommended for the food industry for most accurate results.

AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE INCREASE AND HIGH ENERGY PHOTON BEAMS ON DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Parijata Desiree Mackey 
Dr Michael M Krop Sr High, Miami, FL, USA

The purpose of this project is to determine the effects of increased temperature (25°C to 29°C) and exposure to X-Rays (999 rads, 4 minutes) on gene expression (observable mutant phenotypes), chromosomal translocation, male-to-female ratio, and viability (number of offspring) of Drosophila melanogaster strains Canton-S and 674. It is hypothesized that both increased temperature and X-Ray radiation will increase chromosomal translocation, alter gene expression, and reduce viability of both Drosophila strains, decreasing the male-to-female ratio, and increasing mutation rate.<br><br> To test the hypothesis, six Drosophila subcultures were prepared, three containing Canton-S, three containing 674. One subculture per strain was placed, for 10-12 days, in a 25°C incubator, a 29°C incubator, and exposed to 999 rads of X-Ray radiation in 4 minutes. The viability, male-to-female ratio, and number of mutants were recorded. Three trials were performed.<br><br> At 25°C (the control), the results were similar for both strains. The male-to-female ratio was 1:1 for both. The mutation rate was 1% for Canton-S, 0% for 674. At 29°C, viability increased for both strains. The male-to-female ratio was 2:3 for Canton-S, and 3:4 for 674. The average mutation rate was 2% for each. The X-ray study resulted in increased viability, and an average male-to-female ratio of 2:3 for Canton-S and 674. The mutation rate was 4% for Canton-S, and 5% for 674. <br><br> The results partially supported the hypothesis; for both strains, increased temperature and X-Ray exposure decreased the male-to-female ratio, increased chromosomal translocation, and altered gene expression. Viability, however, increased with temperature and X-Ray exposure.

THE EFFECTS OF MUTATED HSC20
Falin Bhupendra Patel
Eleanor Roosevelt High School, Greenbelt, MD

This project focused on iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis, the process the body undergoes to produce iron-sulfur clusters. These clusters are vital co-factors needed by the body for various biological processes. The machinery of iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis includes co-chaperone proteins which assist the clusters in moving to the target protein. A particular J-domain co-chaperone protein is Hsc20. In contrast to bacterial and fungal versions, human Hsc20 is characterized by an unusual domain. This domain is classified by two highly conserved twin cysteine motifs. The function of this domain is unknown, but it may in fact have an affect on iron-sulfur cluster machinery.<br><br>In order to further examine this domain, the protein was mutated to create several different versions of Hsc20. These versions of Hsc20 mutated the cysteine to serines because they are bio-chemically similar amino acids. The mutated DNA sequences coding for the proteins were transfected into a stable line of mammalian cells. Analysis from Western Blots and confocal microscopy was taken to study the effects the mutated protein had.<br><br>The results revealed that although the mutants localize within the mitochondria just as the wild type versions do, its expression levels were significantly lowered. This suggested that the once stable protein becomes unstable because of the mutations, indicating that perhaps the domain plays a key role in the stability of the protein.

THE STRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION OF A POSSIBLE 3-COORDINATE INTERMEDIATE DURING COPPER TRANSFER BETWEEN COPPER CHAPERONE (HAH1) AND WILSON DOMAIN FOUR (WD4)
Kush Jay Sharma
Kalamazoo Area Mathematics and Science Center, Kalamazoo, MI

Copper has an integral function within the overall functions of the body. Copper homeostasis is regulated very tightly by a series of proteins that shuttle copper around the cell to be either inserted into proteins or moved to vesicles and excreted. One specific protein involved in copper regulation within the cells is the wilson disease protein (WLN). This protein is important to the removal of excess copper from the cell; improper regulation leads to liver cirrhosis or brain damage eventually leading to a possible case of Alzheimer’s. Specifically, a copper chaperone, human Atx1 (HAH1), acquires the copper in the cytosol and delivers it to a specific domain on the n-terminal sequence (WD4) of the WLN protein; where it finally gets transferred into the appropriate vesicle. The interaction between HAH1 and WD4 involves two specific cysteines on each protein that become bound to the copper. The transfer process requires several coordination states of the copper that ensure proper transfer. The coordination state of interest was a presumed 3-coordinate copper thiolate intermediate that would exist during the shuttling process. The strategy used to “trap” this elusive intermediate was to mutate each of the pertinent cysteines individually to alanine. Titrations were done with both native copper- protein and each mutated apo-protein to construct the proposed 3-coordinate copper thiolate structure. The nature of these newly formed structures was monitored and found by specific increases in the uv-visible and fluorescence spectroscopy indicative of copper thiolate bonds, as well as more definitive evidence from x-ray absorption spectroscopy.

INHIBITION OF HISTONE DEACETYLASES
Neeli Mishra
West Windsor-Plainsboro High School South, Princeton Junction, NJ

Heritable changes in gene expression occurring without alterations in gene sequence are referred to as “epigenetic”, and dysregulation of this signaling underlies several human biological processes. At the center of epigenetic mechanisms are critical chromatin regulatory networks such as DNA methylation and post-translational modifications (PTMs). <br><br>Histone PTMs have been linked to both gene activation and repression depending on the single modification site. Decreased histone acetylation has been linked to various diseases such as cancer. Towards this end, many different small molecule drugs have been developed to inhibit histone deacetylases (HDACs), enzymes responsible for removing the acetylation modifications from histones, and many of these drugs are currently in clinical trials for treating different cancers. Nevertheless, the exact mechanism of action of these inhibitor drugs has not been understood, and the acetylation sites on histones affected by these drugs remain elusive. <br><br>This experiment indicates that a high-throughput quantitative mass spectrometry based platform can be utilized to characterize the kinetics of histone deacetylation patterns to solve part of this research problem. In this work, I have begun to identify which sites are affected by HDAC inhibiting drugs and the rates of this inhibition. <br><br>Cancer is currently considered a disease of both genetic and epigenetic changes. While genetic factors have been correlated with progression of many different types of cancers, epigenetic factors related to histone PTMs remain somewhat unknown. It is believed that comprehension of these epigenetic modification mechanisms at the Histone Code level may lead to enhanced diagnostics or development of epigenetic therapy beneficial for human health.

ANALYSIS OF PHYTOCHEMICALS IN AFRICAN NIGHTSHADE
Sarah Marie Cox
Zane Trace High School, Chillicothe, OH

Phytochemicals are mostly secondary metabolites in plants considered non-essential nutrients regarding human health. There is a need to investigate phytonutrients in African nightshade, particularly glycoalkaloids to better understand their nutritional contribution and potentially negative effect. Glycoalkaloids are a group of phytochemicals accounting for poisoning or even death. The objective was to establish a method to identify phytochemicals in African nightshades, focusing on glycoalkaloids, and quantify. 40 African night shade samples were collected from Kenya, Cameroon, and Tanzania and grown in a test plot in Taiwan. All samples were nutritionally evaluated then freeze-dried and stored at -40C. Three samples were profiled to establish their phytochemical profile. The samples were extracted using a methanol/ethanol extraction method. These samples were extracted further for the quantification of their respective glycoalkaloids, using a methanol-based extraction then solid-phase extraction, also using methanol as the primary solvent. For the profiling, the samples were evaluated through UPLC-MS analysis using A: 0.1% Formic Acid in Water and B: 0.1% Formic Acid in Acetonitrile as solvents in the mobile phase. For the glycoalkaloid analysis, the samples were also evaluated through the UPLC-MS using A:10mM of ammonia acetate in water titrated with formic acid, and B: 20% methanol in water, with an isogradient of 70%A/30%B for 20 minutes. Mass spectroscopy was used to further identify and quantify for profiling and glycoalkaloid analysis. Alkaloids in the potato young shoots and eggplant cultivars were identified, and preliminary data were collected for the nightshade cultivars. Methodology was established, but needs to be improved for better resolution.

A BIOINFORMATIC ANALYSIS OF THE RIBOSOME THROUGH PERL PROGRAMMING

City Honors School, Buffalo, NY

Because the ribosome is a complex and essential organelle, it is unlikely that Horizontal Gene Transfer has affected it since any significant mutations would destroy its functionality and lead to cell death. Therefore, it was proposed that one could illustrate the conservancy of such a complex organelle and align a clear pathway of evolution through the ribosomal proteins.<br><br> My project is an second-year addendum to a project on S14, which makes close interactions with S3 and S10. Further analysis of these proteins shows this interaction maintains conservation and is found in every existing organism. By aligning these proteins from more than 6000 varied species using ExPASy, it is possible to confirm the endosymbiotic theories that Alphaproteobacteria and Cyanobacteria led to mitochondria and chloroplasts (respectively) of Eukaryotes. This data was found by creating regular expressions that could search through 33 million entries in the UniProtKB database, maximizing the number of accurate hits. It was also discovered that cytosolic ribosomal proteins in Eukaryotes have high similarity to Archaeal equivalents in accordance with the Chimeric model of evolution.<br><br> By aligning all members of three protein families, the congruent data is irrefutable: ribosomes are highly conserved and can be used to trace evolution. The idea of aligning every member in a protein family has clear applications that can be seen through the prospects of completing an accurate, rooted tree of life, creating drugs that inhibit the ribosome, and studying every member of a protein family simultaneously.

THE EFFECT OF CARBOHYDRATE COMPOSITION (SUCROSE/HEXOSE RATIO) OF NECTAR ON THE TYPE OF POLLINATORS THAT MIGHT POLLINATE TWO SPECIES OF BRASSICACEAE (B. JUNCEA AND B. RAPA)?
Cassandra Lynn Roy
Cloquet Senior High School, Cloquet, MN

Nectar is a floral reward secreted by plant organs to attract pollinators (Pacini, Nepi, and Vesprini, 2003). The question was what effect does the carbohydrate composition of nectar have on the type of pollinators that might pollinate two species of Brassicaceae (B. juncea and B. rapa)? The hypothesis was if the carbohydrate composition is different, then the types of pollinators that might visit two species of Brassicaceae will be affected. Thirty-six B. juncea and B. rapa (brown mustard) plants were obtained from the local university and tested for carbohydrate composition. The nectar was collected from fifty-five flowers from the thirty-six plants. An Ampliflu Red Glucose Assay was done at a wave length of 560 nanometers, a nanodrop spectrophotometer read each samples absorption level. The differences in absorption between the samples with invertase (CWINV4) added and without CWINV4 were compared, so as to calculate the sucrose/hexose ratio of each sample. The hypothesis was partially supported; there was a significant difference between the sucrose/hexose concentration (ug/ml) and ratio. B. juncea had a significantly higher overall sugar (sucrose and hexose) concentration (142.97 ug/ml) when compared to B. rapa (36.89 ug/ml). B. juncea also had a significantly higher overall sucrose/hexose ratio (.924) when compared to B. rapa (.797), using an ANOVA, p<.032. Even though the ratio was significantly different, according to Baker and Baker (1983), a ratio between .500 to .999 indicates a sucrose rich nectar. Therefore, both plants fall within the sucrose rich range and should have many common pollinators.

A STUDY OF TOTAL PHENOLIC CONTENT AND ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTY OF CAMELLIA SINENSIS
Joo-Hye "Christine" Park
Timber Lake High School, Timber Lake, SD, USA

The purpose of this project was to study the correlation between total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant property in teas derived from Camellia Sinensis, to compare TPC and antioxidant properties of different brands of green tea, and to compare those of green tea and black tea.<br><br>Sample extracts were prepared from four samples: three different brands of green tea and one black tea. Three replicates of each sample were prepared. For the Total Phenolic Content Assay, water, Folin-Denis reagent, and saturated sodium carbonate were added to a vial with each sample extract, and a spectrophotometer was used to note absorbance at 730 nm. The absorbance values were then converted to concentration measured in mg/mL by using a tannic acid standard/calibration curve equation. For the Antioxidant Activity Assay, DPPH solution was added to a vial with each sample extract, and absorbance was noted at 517 nm with the spectrophotometer. Then an antioxidant activity percentage values were obtained using an antioxidant activity equation.<br><br>Data analysis showed that there was a negative correlation between total phenolic content and antioxidant activity. Also, all green tea, although of varying brand, possessed similar TPS concentrations and antioxidant activity percentages. On the other hand, black tea had a significantly lower TPC concentration but yet showed a high antioxidant activity percentage similar to that of green tea. This and the negative correlation between total phenolic content and antioxidant activity indicates that there are other factors in addition to phenolic compounds that contribute to Camellia Sinensis' antioxidant properties.<br><br>

THE IDEAL CONDITIONS FOR CATALASE CATALYSIS: CONTEMPORARY TREATMENT METHODS FOR ACATALASEMIA
Christopher Allen Zimmerman
Muhlenberg Senior High School, Laureldale, PA, USA

The catalase enzyme, which is present in human peroxisomes, is necessary for the maintenance of homeostasis because it decomposes hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a toxic compound that results from many metabolic processes. By performing a bioassay of catalase, the ideal conditions for catalysis were determined; these conditions were then used, in combination with modern medical concepts, to formulate contemporary treatment methods for complications of catalase deficiency, known as acatalasemia.<br><br> By utilizing a specially developed apparatus, termed the enzyme bioassometer, the rate of reaction for catalase catalysis was measured as a function of O2 production; the enzyme was isolated from potato tubers. Enzyme temperature was varied by using a hot plate, whereas pH was altered by supplementing small (~800 picoliters) volumes of buffer, either sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to create a basic solution or hydrochloric acid (HCl) to create an acidic solution. To modify the salt concentration, various amounts of sodium chloride (NaCl) were added. The substrate concentration was tested by changing the concentration (M) of H2O2 used as the reactant.<br><br> Based on experimental data analysis, the ideal conditions for catalase catalysis are 37°C (310K), pH 7.23, 2.36 M NaCl (salt), and 2.94 M H2O2 (substrate). The established ideal conditions for catalysis directly correspond to those of several bodily organs, through which catalase deficiency may be treated. These “hot spots” include the kidneys, liver, and duodenum, where treatment may be possible either via nanotechnology-containing injections to alter catalase production or through small enzyme supplements to treat acatalasemia and prevent further complications.<br><br>

AN INVESTIGATION OF THE REMEDIATION OF BERKELEY PIT WATER USING GENETICALLY MODIFIED EXTREMOPHILIC ORGANISMS:PHASE IV
Alexandra Hope Antonioli
Butte High School, Butte, MT, 58701 USA

This project is an expansion of previous years’ studies of the effects of a non-native transgenic strain of alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Dang, and its’ capability of binding heavy metals found in Berkeley Pit water. The alga was altered with a metallothionein (MT) II gene and results suggested that the alga decreased metal concentration in Berkeley Pit water. However, due to the alga’s slow growth in Berkeley Pit water, a native organism was chosen. The possibility of using this MT-II gene to alter a native organism to increase its’ metal binding capabilities was examined. Pichia anomala Hansen was chosen as a potential genetic system. The purpose of this phase of research was to create a new gene clone containing the mouse MT-II gene. A YEp352 E.coli/S. cerevisiae shuttle vector was selected and mouse MT-II was acquired. Alkaline lysis treatment was used to purify plasmid DNA. YEp352 and MT-II plasmid DNA was then simultaneously digested using EcoRI and KpnI. Samples were then gel purified and the MT-II insert was ligated into YEp352. The new plasmid, which was named YEMT-II, was used to transform DH5á E. coli cells that serve as an experimental model for insertion of the gene clone into the native Berkeley Pit yeast. Mini-plasmid purification procedures were used to screen for colonies with YEMT-II. All colonies screened were positive. Creating this clone has opened new opportunities for the advancement of this research leading to the ultimate goal of the detoxification of municipal and industrial waste streams using genetically modified organisms.<br><br><br>

A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF QUANTUM DOT NANOTECHNOLOGY AND STANDARD FLUOROPHORES
Zane Sami Hatahet
Divine Child High School, Dearborn, Michigan, United States of America

Quantum Dots and standard fluorophores are fluorescent dyes used in subcellular imaging. Photobleaching is the gradual loss of fluorescent signal from fluorophores during imaging, and Quantum Dots, a new nanotechnology, are purported to resist this. The problem pursued through this investigation was: are Quantum Dots more effective than standard fluorophores in fluorescent imaging, in terms of brightness and resistance to photobleaching? In this study, sensory neurons from mouse tissue were dyed with standard fluorophores and Quantum Dots. Next, the slides with the dyed mouse tissue were placed under a confocal laser microscope, and initial images of cell clusters were captured in a scan. After this scan, the clusters were put through a 45-minute z-series scan of a low laser power to capture images at various focal planes. Once completed, a final scan capturing images of the cell clusters was completed. This 3-step process was then repeated, replacing the z-series scan with a 2-minute 100% laser blast scan that focused on single subregions of the cell clusters. Using MetaMorph software, the pixel densities of the initial and post images and image subregions were quantified. The photobleaching percentages and numerical statistics were then calculated in Microsoft Excel and plotted using Prism graphing software. The data indicated that the Quantum Dots were not as bright as the standard fluorophores. In terms of photobleaching, the Quantum Dots outperformed the standard fluorophores in the 2-minute laser blast scans, while they performed similarly to the standard fluorophores in the 45-minute z-series scans.

EFFECTS OF ETHANOL & GLUCOSE ON LIVER ENZYME FUNCTION AS TESTED THROUGH CATALASE OXIDATION OF HYDROGEN PEROXIDE
Katie Joan Nix
Grove High School, Grove, OK

The purpose of this study was to test the effects that varying amounts of glucose and ethanol have on the enzymatic oxidation rate of hydrogen peroxide while using catalase enzyme.<br><br>Catalase solution concentration was adjusted to 0.05 absorbance at 340nm for consistency. 10mL of catalase solution was added to 10mL of 3% hydrogen peroxide. The oxygen output was measured for 10 minutes. <br><br>Ethanol concentrations were mixed into the catalase solutions as follows: 0.05mL/dL, 0.10mL/dL, 0.20mL/dL, 0.30mL/dL & 0.4mL/dL. These concentrations were chosen according to blood alcohol levels. 0.05 being just below legal limit and 0.40 mL/dL as the extreme level of alcohol toxicity.<br><br>Glucose concentrations were mixed in concentrations that correlate with blood glucose levels: 100mg/dL, 200mg/dL, 300mg/dL, 400mg/dL and 500mg/dL. These concentrations were chosen according to normal blood glucose level of 100mg/dL to the dangerously high blood glucose level of 500mg/dL.<br><br>Differing combinations of glucose and ethanol were also used as a third test group. A fourth test group was formed where only 500mg/dL glucose solutions were used with differing amounts of ethanol.<br><br>It was found that all levels of ethanol & glucose lowered the oxygen output of the reaction. When glucose and ethanol were entered into the reaction together, the effect was not as dramatic as either substance alone. In the fourth test with high glucose, all trials produced an increase in oxygen output.

IS ARTIFICIAL BACTERIAL TRANSFORMATION EFFICIENCY AFFECTED BY THE CATION CHARGE IN THE COMPETENCY INDUCTION SOLUTION?
Jessica Rochelle Evans
Mustang High School, Mustang, Oklahoma, United States

Artificial bacterial transformation is a valuable amplification tool used in microbiology, medicine, and taxonomy. Because the mechanisms are still unknown, improvements of efficiency can be made only through experimentation. This experiment serves to decide whether the charge of the cation in the chloride solution used to induce competency significantly effects the transformation efficiency. <br><br> In the experiment three sets of E.coli bacteria were induced into competency with a solution (either potassium chloride, calcium chloride, or a mixed solution of magnesium, rubidium, and calcium chlorides). Half were then introduced to pBR322, a plasmid DNA that contains genes for antibiotic resistance. Cells that were transformed assimilated the DNA and exhibited the phenotypic trait of antibiotic resistance. Half were plated on ampicillin-containing agar and half on plates without ampicillin. Because untransformed E.coli are sensitive to the antibiotic, all growth on ampicillin plates are cells that have been successfully transformed, allowing for the calculation of transformation efficiency for each type of competency inducing solution. (The rest serve as controls.) <br><br> No cells were transformed with either the potassium or the calcium chlorides; no conclusion could be made concerning the capability of either solution. The mixed solution proved very efficient, and cells were transformed in each trial. Thus, a combination of +1 and +2 cations is effective for inducing bacterial transformation.

DETECTION OF TRANSGENIC PEPTIDE CECROPIN B IN A MODEL PLANT ARABIDOPSIS
Sarah Elizabeth Bertrand
St. Joseph's Academy, Baton Rouge LA, United States of America

This experiment was designed to test whether the peptide Cecropin B, when inserted into the genome of an Arabidopsis model plant, would be passed to the offspring of the plant. Futhermore, the experiment tested whether the plant containing the Cecropin peptide exhibited higher levels of pathogen resistance than those plants that did not contain the gene. Many farmers are now using genetic engineering as a method of disease resistance among their crops; therefore, if Cecropin B aids plants in pathogen resistance, it may have a future in agricultural biotechnology. Standard lab procedures were used for this experiment which included seed sterilization, DNA purification procedures, PCR, and Electrophoresis. The genes were, in fact, detected in all Arabidopsis offspring as could be seen after electrophoresis. Because the Cecropin B was detected in all plants during testing, the research hypothesis can be accepted. Furthermore, the plants containing the peptide Cecropin B exhibited improved resistance to the fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum.

This information led me to study the enzyme effect on anaerobic decomposition.<br><br>Wore gloves. Cooked turkey 180 degrees. Added corn, apples, cottage cheese, potatoes. Put ingredients into food processor until materials became granulated. Weighed mixture on gram scale, divided mixture between six containers. Added 12 grams toilet paper to each container. Added gallon of water to each container. Labeled each container, Test 1, Test 2, Test 3, and Control 1, Control 2, Control 3 respectively. Added 2 grams Rid-X to test containers only. Placed lids, valves on containers, filled valves with water. Put all containers in incubator for 21 days. Recorded observations. After 21 days, strained each container’s mixture through fine mesh kitchen strainer, wore face mask. Put container’s material on baking sheet, baked at 170 degrees to remove excess liquid. Let mixture dry further in controlled area for 7 days, weighed each on gram scale.<br><br>Test Container: Mold growth, slight foul smell, particulate size small, looked like wet gravel (BB gun shot size), organic material compacted together, 54 grams ending weight. <br><br>Control: Mold growth, very foul-sour smell, particulate size very large, organic material loose, 55.3 grams ending weight.<br><br>Per observational data: Rid-X worked, particulate size was smaller and smell was better than control which did not have Rid-X added. Proof that enzymes added to model septic tank will increase efficiency of anaerobic decomposition of organic material.<br><br>

DER TEIL UND DAS GANZE : A STUDY ON THE CHARACTER OF ABETA FRAGMENT (9-28)
Ji Hye Kim
Chungnam Science High School, Gongju-si, SOUTH KOREA

Alzheimer's disease is a neuro-degenerative disorder which is a common cause of senile dementia. In the human brain, there's an amyloid precursor protein called APP. If the enzyme, memapsin-2,reacts with APP, APP is changed into an amyloid peptide consisting of alpha-helix. If denaturation occurs, conformation of the amyloid peptide is changed into beta-sheet, which is insoluble in water, instead of alpha-helix. If beta-sheet is formed, amyloid plaques develop in the human brain. Many previous studies focused on aggregation of Abeta alone. However, this study focused on the secondary structure aggregation of 9-28 Abeta fragment, which has a higher concentration of hydrophobic conformation than full peptide. To estimate the secondary structure of the aggregated peptide, circular dichroism spectrometer(CD) was used. The Abeta fragment samples were observed at different temperatures, pH levels and other inhibition factor. <br><br> The conformational change of fresh Abeta fragment were observed at 30, 37 and 45 celsius degree. Following an increase in temperature, the negative peak moved from 197nm to 218nm. The results from CD secondary structure estimation imply that fibril formation is accelerated by increasing temperature. This tendency was very similar with Abeta full peptide. Also, Abeta fragments were observed at pH 5.8 and pH 7.4 The CD data showed secondary structural change is decelerated by increasing pH. This tendency was also very similar with Abeta full peptide.<br><br> Furthermore, this study showed how significant conditions surrounding the Abeta fragment are, in beta-sheet breaker's inhibition mechanism. In this experiment, it was confirmed that following surrounded condition, the efficacy difference of iAbeta5 is the maximum 57% compared with previous study.

PREVENTING THE EFFECTS OF PHOTOACTIVATED TITANIUM DIOXIDE ON CHROMOSOMAL DNA
Matthew Samuel Wieder
SAR High School, Bronx, N.Y. 10471, USA

Many sunscreens contain titanium dioxide (TiO2), because of its ability to reflect and absorb damaging ultraviolet (UV) rays efficiently. However, in the presence of UV rays, TiO2 generates hydroxyl radicals which can themselves damage or destroy DNA, making its safety questionable. The purpose of this study was first, to quantify the extent of DNA damage resulting from exposure to TiO2 and second, to determine if the extent of that damage could be reduced or eliminated by coating the TiO2 with the antioxidant green tea extract.<br><br> Samples of chromosomal and lambda DNA were prepared and observed in order to assess whether damage resulting from exposure to UV rays was greater when the DNA was coated with TiO2, and whether the DNA damage was reduced when the TiO2 was coated with an antioxidant green tea extract. Samples were examined under a confocal microscope and through surface electrophoresis to determine and measure the extent of DNA damage. Results revealed that the combination of TiO2 and UV rays caused the greatest DNA damage, and that the addition of green tea extract reduced this damage significantly. These findings suggest that the hydroxyl radicals generated by TiO2 exposed to UV rays are captured by the antioxidant green tea. By coating the TiO2 with the antioxidant green tea extract, we may therefore reduce or eliminate the damage to DNA caused by the production of hydroxyl radicals and continue to safely utilize TiO2 in sunscreens. <br><br>

A COMPARISON OF THE ENDOCRINE DISRUPTING POTENTIAL EXHIBITED BY ENVIRONMENTALLY RELEVANT DOSES OF BISPHENOL A AND BISPHENOL S IN VITRO IN T-47D BREAST CANCER CELLS
Sarina Mikayla Farb
Ahimsa Homeschool, Lecompton, KS

Bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor (EDC), has been detected leaching from plastics, food cans, and receipts, and exposure to it has been linked with numerous adverse health effects, in particular, breast cancer. Studies suggest that the new replacement compound, bisphenol S (BPS), may also exhibit endocrine disruption, though the effects of low dose exposure have been vastly under researched. This study aimed to compare the effects of environmentally relevant doses of BPA and BPS in vitro in T-47D malignant breast cells with 17B-estradiol (E2), a carcinogen. It was hypothesized that treatments of BPA and BPS would result in similar endocrine disrupting effects. T-47D cells were treated with several environmentally relevant low doses (derived from dermal exposure from touching receipts) of BPA, BPS, and E2, and proliferation and immmunofluorescence analyses were performed to compare the endocrine disruption. Results indicate that low doses of BPA induce endocrine disrupting effects, though not comparable to E2, while low doses of BPS induce greater endocrine disrupting effects than BPA, similar to those induced by E2. These results suggest that BPS may be a more powerful EDC than BPA, and exposure may pose health risks that make BPS a poor replacement to BPA.

Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) is rich in proteins and utilized as media supplement in cell culture, but its extraction is considered expensive and invasive. Milkfish (Chanos chanos Forsskal) sera are rich in proteins that are potential alternative media supplement for FBS. <br><br> The milkfish sera were obtained from the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources and were subjected to protein quantification using Bradford Protein Assay, followed by characterization by 10% reducing SDS-PAGE, and purification by affinity column chromatography of albumin and mannose-binding proteins.<br><br> Using methyl thiazol tetrazolium (MTT) cell proliferation assay the milkfish crude serum, mannose-binding proteins and albumin were evaluated for the growth of A549 (human lung) and HCT 116 (colon) carcinomas compared to FBS at a constant 10% concentration. Results were read in UV spectrophotometer set at 492nm – 630nm.<br><br> Protein content ranged from 70.1 to 86.1µg/µL while silver stained six protein bands have molecular weights of 44.67kDa – 96.73kDa.<br><br> <br><br> Proliferation of cells correlates to high absorbance values: A549 grows well in milkfish crude serum (0.325), mannose-binding proteins (0.296), and albumin (0.241) better than FBS (0.242) and no serum (0.171). HCT 116 grows well in FBS (0.552) comparable to mannose-binding proteins (0.523) and milkfish crude serum (0.491) and least in albumin (0.344) and no serum (0.205). Consistently, cell adhesion and conversion of yellow MTT dye to light brown confirmed the results.<br><br> Milkfish crude serum containing mannose-binding proteins and albumin is a potential alternative media supplement for FBS in the cell proliferation of human lung and colon carcinomas.

The purpose of this experiment is to discover the DNA sequences of seven plant species native to Eastern Oklahoma that are food sources for the Cherokee American Indian tribe and to use those sequences to determine the relationship among the native plants and the relationship between the native plants and plants that are widely used as major food sources today.<br><br>DNA was extracted from the leaves of the seven native plants using a handheld homogenizer. The DNA was then suspended in double distilled water and combined with oligonucleotide primers. It was put in a thermocycler in order to complete polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to replicate the DNA sequences of the plants. A gel electrophoresis device was used to test the amplification of the PCR reactions. <br><br>When a strand of more than 200 base pairs was found, the PCR reaction was reproduced and purified using a PCR cleanup system and then re-suspended in a buffer. The solutions were then sequenced by a DNA sequencing apparatus. <br><br>The DNA sequences of the indigenous plants as well as the sequences of plants that are commonly used today were organized into a cladogram to show their genetic relationships.

IS THERE A GENETIC SIMILARITY BETWEEN MUTATIONS THAT CAUSE CURLY HAIR IN DOGS AND IN HUMANS?
Sarah Elizabeth Thompson
Hempfield High School, Landisville, PA

The central dogma of molecular biology explains how proteins are produced from DNA. Mutations in DNA can spread throughout the entire process of information flow, causing changes in the proteins. Because proteins determine the characteristics of organisms, changes in proteins can alter their traits. Mutations in genes that create hair protein can cause different types of hair. Specifically, a gene that has recently been identified to be a main factor in determining different hair types in dogs is Fibroblast Growth Factor-5 (FGF5). Recent studies have found another gene that may be linked to curly hair in humans. However, more research needs to be done to understand the genetics of curly hair in humans. In this study, DNA samples were collected from curly haired volunteers and a straight haired negative control. The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was used to amplify a section of the human FGF5 gene where the anticipated mutation in humans would be. The amplified DNA was purified and analyzed using DNA sequencing. The expected mutation that is seen in the FGF5 gene in curly haired dogs was not seen in the FGF5 gene in the human samples, rejecting the hypothesis. The gene(s) controlling curly hair in humans is different from those genes in dogs.

SEASONAL VARIATIONS IN ASSOCIATED POLLEN PROTEINS FROM LOCAL BEE (APIS MELLIFERA) HONEY.
Cody J Falgoust
St. James High School, St. James, LA, USA

Earlier research suggests local honey can reduce allergic symptoms due to local pollen. Protein in honey and pollen grains was analyzed using gel electrophoreses and UV-Vis spectrophotometry. Pollen samples were collected directly from local honey bees and flowers using cloth swabs and/or agitation. Honey samples were collected from honey bee hives raised for honey production by the high school agriculture department. Previous research indicated that highly concentrated protein solutions were needed for employing the analytical technique used in this study. Analyses were supervised and conducted at Nicholls State University in the Department of Physical Sciences. Electrophoreses findings indicate similar proteins found in local honey produced during different seasons of the year. A difference in banding was noted between the major bands of local and non-local honey. Similar banding of proteins showed up between bee pollen and honey, regardless of the season it was produced. Similar banding also showed up between honey (spring '05), bee pollen, and pisolette (less than 25 kDa). Findings indicated some proteins were of high molecular weight (greater than 225 kDa). A hypothesis has been developed during research. The high molecular weight proteins in honey may not be the same proteins found in flower pollen, but may be Immunoglobulins (antibodies) from bee saliva, which may be a reason for the scientifically unconfirmed claim of seasonal allergy relief obtained from consumption of local honey. Experimental procedures are being researched to investigate the validity of the new hypothesis.

Non-viral gene therapy research has not developed an effective delivery mechanism for the localization of therapeutic genes. The purpose of this experimentation was to ascertain if cationic lipid-DNA complexes using DC-chol:DOPE and DOTAP:DOPE were efficient gene delivery systems. Secondary objectives were to determine the optimal dosage and compare intravenous with intraarterial administration. <br><br> Fisher rats, previously implanted by a qualified scientist at the university with rat glioblastoma (RG2) cells, served as the test subjects. The two DNA-lipid complexes, which contain the reporter gene interleukin-12 (IL-12), were then injected i.a. into the carotid artery and i.v. into the tail vein for comparison. The amount of reporter gene product was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The level of gene expression in the tissues investigated was too low to stimulate a therapeutic antitumor response; however, the spleen tissue exhibited the most IL-12 expression. Cationic lipid DOTAP did not form a stable lipoplex, and it is likely that DNA supercoiling was not sufficient. Although localization of gene expression was not achieved in the target tissue, both cationic lipids indicated some transfection, therefore demonstrating that either the means of administration or dosages resulted in the low expression.<br><br>

INTRACELLULAR SIGNALING OF FOXO1 IN THE PI3K/AKT PATHWAY: PATHOGENESIS OF SKELETAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY
Saad Ahmed Khan
Lane Technical College Prep High School, Chicago, IL

Purpose<br><br>Muscle atrophy is a debilitating consequence in multiple clinical settings: diabetes mellitus, heart failure, renal failure, cancer, inactivity, and AIDS, which affect approximately 500 million people worldwide. The purpose of this experiment was to determine the role of FoxO1, a transcriptional factor, in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/ protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway, which is involved in the pathogenesis of muscle atrophy.<br><br>Procedure<br><br>The tibialis anterior and soleus muscle were obtained from wildtype, FoxO1 transgenic, atrogin-1 knockout, transgenic/knockout, and insulin-induced mice. The sizes (cross-sectional area) of type 1 (highly oxidative), type 2a (moderately fast-twitch and oxidative), and 2b (fast-twitch and glycolytic) muscle fibers were determined by immunohistochemistry. After gel electrophoresis, western blots were performed to determine the concentrations of proteins in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. <br><br>Conclusion<br><br>Overexpression of FoxO1 decreased the type 1, 2a, and 2b muscle fiber sizes and the muscle mass in transgenic mice when compared to the wildtype mice because FoxO1 stimulated atrogin-1 which was responsible for the degradation of proteins through the ubiquitin proteasome signaling pathway. The knockout mice showed augmented levels of muscle mass and fiber size. In the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, levels of phosphorylated S6K, a synthase that promotes protein synthesis, increased and there was a decrease in the concentrations of 4EBP-1, a DNA-binding protein, and REDD-1, a negative regulator of transcription, in the insulin induced mice. Levels of phosphorylated FoxO1 had increased promoting a decrease in muscle atrophy through the inhibition of atrogin-1 and other downstream mechanism like muscle ring finger-1 (MuRF-1).

ETHANOL PRODUCTION: AMYLASE VS. CELLULASE
Ka Man Lee
Central High School, Aberdeen, SD

This project is designed to compare the efficiency of two enzymatic ethanol production methods using amylase and cellulase. Analysis was done to determine which enzyme has a higher sugar conversion efficiency rate.<br><br> Ethanol was produced by mixing crushed oatmeal with a pH 6.0 solution made from hydrochloric acid. Alpha-amylase and gluco-amylase enzymes were added to convert starch into glucose and then yeast was added to begin fermentation. The slurry mixture was fermented for 24 hours. The mixture was then filtered. The final filtrate was collected and the volume of each sample was recorded. <br><br> A similar procedure was used for the cellulase experiment. The only alterations were that a pH 5.0 solution was used and cellulase was used to convert cellulose to glucose. <br><br> Ethanol samples were then analyzed using gas chromatography. A standard ethanol concentration curve was created from standard ethanol solutions. The ethanol concentration of each sample was determined and then the volume of ethanol produced was calculated. <br><br> Based on the data collected, statistical analysis showed that there was a significant difference between the two enzymatic ethanol production methods because the p-value was less than 0.05 (p-value = 0.0419). This rejected the initial null hypothesis and suggested that amylase does yield more ethanol when compared to cellulase in oatmeal. The average sugar conversion efficiency rate was 55 milliliter of ethanol per kilogram of insoluble fiber while the average sugar conversion rate for amylase was found to be 39 milliliter of ethanol per kilogram of starch.

FUNGAL ENZYMES FOR BIO-ETHANOL
Julia Cavrell Garcez
American School of Campinas, Campinas, Sao Paulo, BRASIL

The world shows a series of crucial features to understand the importance of biofuels. The increasing concern with oil supply and the negative impact of fossil fuels in the environment, particularly greenhouse gases, have put pressure on society to find alternative renewable fuels.The second generation of alcohol occurs by using the remaining bagasse of the cane and leading it to either enzymatic or acid hydrolysis which will produce hexodes and pentodes, such as glucose and xylose. The question of this project is what is the most efficient “cocktail of enzymes”, when reacting with the sugarcane bagasse, in relation to the cocktails’ efficiency of which one releases the most products? The hypothesis for this experiment is that if the “cocktail of enzymes” is completely able to break down the bagasse’s cell wall and therefore be able to act on it and produce reducing sugars, then there will be a boost in the combustion economy, for no more money or time will be lost from breaking down each component of the bagasse separately. Different cocktails containing the enzymes xylanase, pectinase and lignanase were reacted with different types of bagasse (brute, no pectin, and no pectin and lignin). The best trial was the reaction between the bagasse with no pectin and lignin and the enzymes xylanase and pectinase. This experiment concludes that the hydrolysis that takes place with a cocktail of enzymes is much more efficient, in relation to time and amount of sugar produced, than a hydrolysis that takes place with one enzyme at a time.

AN INVESTIGATION OF THE INHIBITION MECHANISM OF A SCUTELLARIA BAICALENSIS COMPONENT
Harrison Phu Nguyen
Detroit Catholic Central, Novi, MI, United States of America

In this work, a theoretical study was conducted to determine the unique binding site of a Scutellaria Baicalensis (common name Baikal Skullcap) component on the cancer cell. Ever since the discovery of its anticancer capabilities, Scutellaria Baicalensis has been a popular subject of scientific research. Results have shown that the compounds from the extract have a broad spectrum of anticancer activities for various cancers, including breast, colon, liver, and squamous cell carcinoma. This project focused on a component known as SBX, which has shown particular growth inhibition of squamous cancer cells. In order to produce the optimal pharmaceutical agent to combat the cancer, the inhibition mechanism had to be fully understood. Determining the specific binding site of SBX in the cell body was one of the key steps in understanding its mechanism. <br><br>To do this, a non-invasive method was developed in which a computer program, ArgusLab, was used to simulate the SBX binding to potential proteins. ArgusLab is comprised of two search engines: the ShapeDock and the Genetic Algorithm Dock. Both provide an energy reading; a higher magnitude of energy correlates to a more suitable binding site. SBX was found to bind to the enzyme AKT/PKB, which occurs on the cell pathway leading to apoptosis. With the unique binding site found, it can be used to determine if and how SBX should be used in rational chemotherapeutic combination with other agents. Also, to verify the results, a biological test should be conducted. The development of a potent, pharmacognosic drug to combat squamous cell carcinoma is imminent.

GENE-INDUCED BIOSYNTHESIS OF A CANCER THERAPEUTIC DERIVED FROM THE P53 AMINO TERMINUS ELICITS SELECTIVE APOPTOTIC DEATH OF HUMAN PANCREATIC CANCER CELLS
Michael Vishnevetsky
Midwood High School at Brooklyn College, Brooklyn, NY 11210

The p53-MDM2 interaction is a potential target in cancer therapy. Designed to perturb this complex to thereby induce apoptosis, PNC-28 is a peptide derived from AA 17-26 of p53’s binding domain to MDM2. Linked to the transmembrane transport protein penetratin to allow transport into cells, PNC-28 caused selective tumor cell necrosis. To develop a less financially onerous but effective PNC-28-based therapeutic, a mammalian gene expression system was utilized to induce constitutive biosynthesis of PNC-28 for the first time in human pancreatic cancer MIA-PaCa-2 and in untransformed pancreatic BMRPA1 cells. Peptide expression was monitored using Green Fluoresce-nce Protein (GFP) transcribed in tandem with PNC-28, examined by UV Confocal Microscopy, and by immunoblotting (IB) cell lysates for the gene products. Both analyses confirmed the expression of GFP in MIA-PaCa-2 and BMRPA1, and thus the transcription of the newly inserted genes. While PNC-28 was clearly present in MIA-PaCa-2, BMRPA1 cells did not show any measurable amounts of PNC-28. IB showed a rapid and significant rise of endogenous p53 in both cell lines subsequent to transfection with PNC-28 as well as with the PNC-28-negative vector. While p53 fell back to within pre-transfection levels in the PNC-28-negative transfects by 66h, p53 remained high in the PNC-28 transfects of both cell lines. Expression of PNC-28 resulted in the death of 60-80% PNC-28-MIAPaCa-2 transfects within 66h. In contrast, only 20% of the untransformed BMRPA1 died after PNC-28 vector transfection which is similar to the percent of dead BMRPA1 cells upon PNC-28-negative vector transfection. Annexin V-staining of PNC-28-transfected MIA-PaCa-2, but not of BMRPA1 cells strongly implicates apoptosis as the selective mechanism of death in the tumor cells. The study presents evidence highlighting the potential of PNC-28-based gene therapy as a safe and effective cancer therapy.

A NOVEL FUNCTION OF TSTXK-BETA NEUROTOXIN IN THE TITYUS SERRULATUS SCORPION VENOM
Nayrob Pereira
Escola Estadual Alberto Torres, Sao Paulo, BRASIL

Scorpion venoms are complex mixtures composed of several proteins. In recent years, many antimicrobial peptides have been found in the venom of scorpions. Antimicrobial peptides are small, cationic molecules that form the innate defense mechanism of many organisms. The AMPs appear as an ideal alternative to a fast and efficient defense against microbes. The objective of this study was to identify new antimicrobial peptides in the venom of the scorpion Tityus serrulatus. The venom was obtained from 56 animals by electrical stimulation, and then dissolved with water, centrifuged, and the soluble part was dried by vacuum centrifugation and reconstituted in 1 ml of acidified water (TFA 0.05%). The soluble fraction was applied in RP-HPLC on a column semi preparative Jupiter C18. Elution was performed using a linear gradient from 0-80% of acetonitrile in 60 min at a flow rate of 1.5mL/min. The antimicrobial activities were determined by liquid growth inhibition assays against Gram-negative bacteria Echerichia coli SBS363, Gram-positive bacteria Micrococcus luteus A270 and yeast Candida albicans. In this study I identified nine fractions with antimicrobial activity. I analyzed only one fraction that showed molecular mass of 6887.4Da. This molecule was reduced, alkylated and tripsinized and showed similarity with a neurotoxin of Tityus serrulatus venom: TsTXK-beta. This molecule was active against M. luteus and C. albicans and it has no hemolytic activity. My future plans are to finish the characterization of this molecule, and I intend to make a better evaluation of its use, as antibiotics.

FINDING THE STRUCTURE OF A PROTEIN: TESTING A NEW PARAMAGNETIC TAG ON THE E. COLI PROTEIN GB1 BY SOLUTION NMR
Manjari Randeria
Upper Arlington High School, Columbus, OH

The goal of this project was to test a new protein tag to determine the distances between the amino acid residues of GB1, a protein found in E. coli, using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The new tag containing a Cu2+ paramagnetic ion was attached to a mutated residue on the protein. This tag interacted with the amino acids on the protein which were labeled with 15N. Using solution NMR, the coupling of the tag to nuclear spins on the amino acid residues was measured from the heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra of the two nuclei in the 15N-1H bond. Chemical shift and relaxation rate measurements were used to determine the distances of the residues from the tag. The experimental tag was more rigid than EDTA control tag, and thus had the potential of leading to more accurate determination of distances. This experimental tag was useful to determine the distances of residues which are further away; however, it coupled too strongly to nearby residues to obtain detectable relaxation signals. These results have implications for understanding disorders, such as Alzheimer’s and prion diseases, caused by protein mis-folding.

HARNESSING ELECTRICAL ENERGY IN BIOFUEL CELLS BY IMMOBILIZED GLUCOSE DEHYDROGENASE ENZYMES USING ACER SACCHARUM
Elizabeth D. Zerr
St. Charles West, St. Charles, MO, USA

The oxidation-reduction of NADP+ to NADPH and glucose to glucono-lactone by dehydrogenase enzymes on poly (methylene-green) modified electrodes provides promising results for enzymatic biofuel cells. To increase power and lifetime of fuel cell, enzymes were immobilized in a tetrabutylammonium bromide/Nafion membrane on the electrode’s surface. A sucrose solution was tested in comparison to a solution with the sap of Acer saccharum (Sugar Maple). Open circuit potentials ranging from 0.44 to 0.69V were produced from a 2% sucrose solution, whereas the 2% sucrose dilution of Maple syrup produced open circuit potentials of .37V to .60V.

TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION OF BASE EXCISION REPAIR GENES IN ESCHERICHIA COLI

Because of its nature as the most important molecule of the body, DNA is protected with a variety of enzymes and proteins in the cell. Even with these, free radicals sometimes damage the genome. The repair of DNA is left up to several repair enzymes that fix specific mutations in DNA. The purpose of these experiments was to determine the importance of each of these enzymes and their interdependence among one another.<br><br> The four genes I worked with were mut M, mut Y, endonuclease III, and endonuclease VIII. I regulated the transcription of each enzyme by genetically knocking out successive enzymes and a transcription factor, arcA, in the bacteria E. coli. By plating the colonies on an antibiotic, rifampicin, I could measure how each gene played a part in the mutation rate.<br><br> I found that that each enzyme seemed to have a varying importance in the cell. Endonuclease III, for instance, did not play a huge role in fixing mutations by itself, but when dually knocked out with mut M or endonuclease VIII, I saw a vast increase in the mutation rate. Each enzyme, either with the help of another enzyme or not, played some role in base excision repair. <br><br> Because the genes in E. coli are synonymous with those in humans, this research is crucial in the area of cancer research. By understanding which genes may play a role in creating cancer, we may be able to prevent the disease.

ALTERING SEQUENCE-SPECIFIC MOTIONS GUIDING PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS
Sean Michael Hendricks
Marian High School, Mishawaka, IN

Protein-protein interactions are often facilitated by small docking domains. These domains frequently have flexible docking loops that recognize and bind the target proteins. Examples are WW domains, a family of docking domains recruited by numerous signaling proteins. The binding specificity of WW domains have been linked to the amino acid sequences of their docking loops. Understanding just how these sequences encode binding specificity is essential for understanding the molecular basis of cell signaling. Recent studies of the WW domain from Pin1 show that a new property, sequence-specific dynamics of docking loops, affects binding specificity (Peng et al.). Pin1 regulates cell growth and understanding how its WW domain recognizes other proteins can boost the molecular understanding of cancer.<br><br>This project investigates, “How does loop mobility and binding preference change upon mutation of loop amino acid sequence?” To answer this question, a loop mutant for the Pin1 WW domain was generated, and the consequences were observed by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The mutation was a single-site substitution to increase steric bulk without changing the number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. It was hypothesized this mutation would preserve the wild-type hydrogen bond network. However, the NMR results did show a change in the loop hydrogen bond network. Thus, the results emphasize how apparently conservative changes in loop sequence can lead to unexpected effects, and shed new light on how loop sequence encodes the inter-residue contacts influencing loop mobility and substrate binding.

THE EFFECTS OF NUTRIENT DEFICIENCY ON THE EXPRESSION OF (DELTA) ENDOTOXIN PROTEINS OF BACILLUS THURGINGIENSIS IN TRANSGENIC COTTON, GOSSYPIUM HIRSUTUM
Jack Elba Teague
Nettleton Junior High School, Jonesboro, Arkansas, U.S.A.

An experiment was done to measure the effects of nutrient deficiency on the expression of the endotoxin proteins of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) in transgenic cotton(Gossypium hirsutum). Nitrogen deficient plants will have much less expression of the entoxin, thus having less effective resistance against insects than cotton that is nitrogen rich. <br><br>On Jan. 6, 2003, two hundred Bt cotton plants (Variety FM 989) were planted in Metro-mix 366 potting media in a Todd flat in a greenhouse. These were watered every day until Feb. 1, when 72 plants were transplanted into 10.16cm pots. Three treatments of 6 plants each and 4 repetitions, equaling 24 plants per treatment were used. The 3 treatments were plants 1) grown in sand, 2) plants grown in sand with fertilizer, and 3) plants grown in potting media with fertilizer. Every day after transplanting plants were given water in the morning and water or fertilizer in the evening, depending on the treatment. A feeding bioassay with neonate (newly hatched) bollworms (Heliocoverpa zea) was performed. Larvae were examined 3 days after exposure, and % mortality was determined. Endotoxin levels were determined for leaf samples using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).<br><br>Unexpectedly, larval mortality from feeding on nutrient deficient plants was higher than the caterpillars feeding on nutrient rich plants. Other factors besides Bt levels affected mortality. Results from this study indicate that although different nutrient levels affected Bt levels, it was insignificant in affecting pest caterpillar control.<br><br>

RESTRICTING NEUROTRANSMITTER DOPAMINE IN TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA: IDENTIFYING ANTAGONISTS FOR DOPAMINE D2 AND D3 RECEPTORS
Olivia Luige
Hugo Treffner Gymnasium, Tartu, ESTONIA

Schizophrenia is one of the most burdensome mental diseases. Although it has been a research subject for over hundred years, scientists have not fully resolved the puzzle yet. Nevertheless, treatment exists and is mostly based on blocking neurotransmitter dopamine. The aim of this research paper was to characterise the binding of two unknown compounds on dopamine D2 and D3 receptors using a classic method of radioligand competitive binding assay and, in addition, nucleotide GTPgammaS to reveal their potency of blocking dopamine.<br><br>Two dopamine receptor subtypes, D2 and D3 receptors, were characterised in the human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293). Experiments with well-known compounds, such as dopamine, 7-OH-PIPAT, NGB2904 and sulpiride, proved the presence of G-proteins on membranes that expressed D2 receptors and the absence of it on the membranes expressing D3 receptors. Therefore, with this method agonists and antagonists could have been selected on D2 receptors only.<br><br>Previous conclusions allowed further testing in order to characterise new compounds (the 3-azabicyclo[3.2.0]heptane derivatives, abbreviated herein as TK12 and TK27). TK12 had four times better affinity for both receptors and its binding characteristics were similar to those of a well-known antagonist, while TK27 had very low affinity and behaved more like an agonist.<br><br>The main conclusions are that the chosen method is reliable on D2 receptors, for some reason effects do not appear on D3 receptors, and further testing of TK12 using more sensitive methods would be advisable.

MOLECULAR COMPUTATION BASED ON DNA
Philip Babcock
Schottengymnasium, Vienna, Austria

This project evaluates the feasibility of a biomolecular computer utilizing nucleic acids in vitro as a data processing and storage medium and biochemical techniques of DNA manipulation as Boolean operators. <br><br>Although DNA and RNA exceed conventional computers in terms of computation speed and energy efficiency, input and output still require considerable time. The project assessed exactness and speed of PCR and electrophoresis and introduced combinatorial fluid control as a possibility of higher efficiency. Resulting chemical parameters gained from a series of testing experiments were applied to a new model for DNA computation based on combinatorial ligation of oligonucleotides followed by controlled annealing of Cy5-modified test oligos, the fluorescence detection of which served as an output. <br><br>The DNA computer tested was able to solve a 3-var SAT problem at a computation rate of teraoperations per second. In comparison to prior DNA computation models, the input/output rate could be cut down to half the time needed due to complete reliance on Watson-Crick base pairing. Moreover, energy consumption was reduced significantly by discarding restriction enzyme digestion, which was commonly proposed in the literature analysed. <br><br>The project contributed to science by designing a DNA computation model based solely on fluid control and base pairing, which can be applied to lab-on-a-chip technology on a future biochip processing unit. <br><br>

Michelle Deanna Nemetchek
Big Sky High School, Missoula, MT

Bacopa monnieri is an Ayurvedic medicinal plant widely used in India for its antiallergic, antistress, and memory-enhancing properties. Such a popular form of medicine in the East has now begun to be tested by Western medicine. This project tested the antimicrobial properties of Bacopa against the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the fungi Candida albicans, and Candida tropicales. Each microbe grew normally, showing B. monnieri’s lack of inhibition power towards microbes. This plant was also tested for enzyme inhibition of the Caspase-1, Caspase-3, and MMP-3 enzymes. Some extracts of B. monnieri inhibited Casp-1 signal transduction up to 98%. Extracts inhibited signal transduction of Casp-3 up to 93%, and signal transduction of MMP-3 as high as 93% as well. Solid-liquid chromatographic extractions of CHCl3-MeOH inhibited Casp-1 signal transduction up to 98%. MMP-3 up to 77%. Solid-liquid chromatographic extractions of CHCl3 inhibited Casp-1 signal transduction as much as 100%, MMP-3 up to 96%, and Casp-3 up to 75%. B. monnieri, therefore, may be useful for controlling inflammation of the heart, arthritis, and programmed cell death.

NOVEL BIOSENSOR UTILIZING A QUINONE MONOLAYER IN CONJUNCTION WITH CYCLIC VOLTAMMETRY
Joy Elisabeth Lee
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Alexandria, VA

A new, user-friendly biosensor capable of detecting target biomolecules was successfully developed and tested. To create the biosensor, quinone molecules were first immobilized onto a gold wire electrode and were reacted with thiolated ssDNA molecules to form a second layer. This biosensor was tested through exposure to target treatment molecules and non-target control molecules. By analyzing the resulting shifts in the peak potentials of the cyclic voltammograms, the changes in the electrochemical characteristics of the biosensors during the testing process were observed. These changes were the result of hybridization reactions between the biosensor and the DNA segments in solution, and indicated the detection of these target molecules by the biosensor. Statistical analysis of the results indicates that the difference between the mean shifts of the treatment and control trials is significant. One major advantage of this biosensor is the brevity of time required for detection. Possible applications include detection of potential bioterrorism agents. Future research with different molecules is suggested to increase the range of target molecules.

USING ABSORBANCE DIFFERENCE SPECTROSCOPY TO STUDY INTERACTIONS OF SELECTED INHIBITORS ON BREAST CANCER MOLECULAR TARGET CYTOCHROME P450 AROMATASE
Jonathan Lloyd Priester
William B. Murrah High School, Jackson, Mississippi, USA

Research into the initiation and progression of breast cancer has led to breakthroughs in fighting this dreaded illness. The identification of several molecular targets has resulted from this research. One molecular target is Cytochrome P450. Cytochrome P450 Aromatase is a member of the Cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. These enzymes are involved in a number of important cellular processes such as xenobiotic metabolism and the synthesis and metabolism of endogenous compounds. A common feature of the Cytochrome P450s is the presence of a covalently bound heme moiety at the enzyme active site. This allows the Cytochrome P450s to bind molecular oxygen and modulate its reactivity through a series of controlled electron transfers and typically results in the insertion of one atom of molecular oxygen into the substrate. Cytochrome P450 aromatase utilizes these features to convert androgens into estrogens via a complex three-step mechanism. <br><br> Breast cancer treatment regimens for post-menopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer consist of tamoxifen in conjunction with a cytochrome P450 aromatase inhibitor. Tamoxifen blocks hormone binding to the estrogen receptor while inhibition of aromatase results in decreased production of estrogens. This approach has been the most successful breast cancer treatment regimen in use today. The goal of my investigation was to characterize the binding of Aromatase inhibitors to Aromatase. I estimated the binding affinities by measuring the changes in the spin-state of the heme-iron moiety at the Aromatase active site using absorbance difference spectroscopy. The results indicate that the second-generation steroidal inactivator Formestane binds tightly to aromatase but not as tightly as a natural substrate (Androstenedione). These results will be incorporated into a molecular model for Aromatase.

THE ROLE OF VEGF-R2 REGULATION IN VEGF'S VASCULAR EFFECTS IN THE STATUS EPILEPTICUS MODEL
Maite Angela Antola
Ossining High School, Ossining, NY

After seizures, blood-brain barrier breakdown has been observed in the brain; which can result in changes in vascularization. These factors have been hypothesized to contribute to epileptogenesis. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) plays a role in the process of angiogenesis in the brain. The vascular effects of VEGF are proposed to be detrimental to the brain post seizure. One of the primary receptors for VEGF is VEGF-R2. To determine the potential role of this receptor in post-seizure vasculature, brain sections from rats that received the VEGF-R2 preferential, inhibitor SU5416 or anti-VEGF-R2 were stained for vasculature. We quantified vascular density when VEGF is administered immediately after a seizure to better understand vasculature after seizures. Stereological analysis of vascular parameters was conducted to determine the effects of VEGF-R2 inhibition on vascular density. Interestingly, there was a pattern seen in the correlation of vascular and neuronal density when inhibited with SU5416, demonstrating a negative relationship between the densities (p=0.6989).There was a significant difference of vascular density between the antibody and the control (F (1, 8) = 6.890, p<0.031). In after-seizure VEGF treatment, a significant negative relationship is demonstrated between neuronal and vascular density (r = -.89, p < .04).VEGF-R2 may be responsible for modulating vasculature after seizures and may also have an important role in neuronal damage. This research will help towards comprehending the detrimental vascular effects mediated by VEGF-R2. Drug therapies can be created to protect neuron, and the human brain from the potentially damaging properties of after seizure angiogenesis.

NOVEL BIOSENSOR UTILIZING A QUINONE MONOLAYER IN CONJUNCTION WITH CYCLIC VOLTAMMETRY
Joy Elisabeth Lee
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Alexandria, VA

A new, user-friendly biosensor capable of detecting target biomolecules was successfully developed and tested. To create the biosensor, quinone molecules were first immobilized onto a gold wire electrode and were reacted with thiolated ssDNA molecules to form a second layer. This biosensor was tested through exposure to target treatment molecules and non-target control molecules. By analyzing the resulting shifts in the peak potentials of the cyclic voltammograms, the changes in the electrochemical characteristics of the biosensors during the testing process were observed. These changes were the result of hybridization reactions between the biosensor and the DNA segments in solution, and indicated the detection of these target molecules by the biosensor. Statistical analysis of the results indicates that the difference between the mean shifts of the treatment and control trials is significant. One major advantage of this biosensor is the brevity of time required for detection. Possible applications include detection of potential bioterrorism agents. Future research with different molecules is suggested to increase the range of target molecules.

PHYSIOLOGIC EFFECTS OF HBOC-201 IN A HYPERTONIC SALINE CARRIER
Amanda Jane Lu
Jasper High School, Plano, TX, USA

Hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) have emerged as promising alternatives to blood transfusions. However, the side effects of HBOCs include vasoconstriction and increases in blood pressure. The resuscitation fluid hypertonic saline solution has been shown to attenuate several of these effects. Therefore, the purpose of this experiment is to test the effects of HBOC-201 in a hypertonic saline carrier on levels of nitric oxide, endothelin-1, and vascular permeability. <br><br> 7.5%, 5%, and 3% concentrations of HBOC-201 were suspended in hypertonic saline solutions (HT-HBOC) and added to whole blood in 10% concentrations. The samples were then tested for total nitric oxide (a vasoconstrictor) and endothelin-1 (a vasorelaxant) concentrations using ELISA analysis. In addition, permeability tests on human lung endothelial, lung epithelial, and umbilical vascular endothelial cells were conducted.<br><br> While total nitric oxide (NO) levels measured were elevated in the HBOC samples, HBOC-201 in the saline carrier significantly decreased levels of NO compared to HBOC-201 alone. Similarly, the levels of endothelin-1 were increased in the HBOC samples. However, HT-HBOC decreased concentrations of endothelin-1. HBOC-201 also decreased the vascular permeability of cells, and the addition of a saline carrier attenuated the vasoconstrictive effects of HBOC.<br><br> HBOC-201 may possess potentially harmful side effects, but these may be mitigated through a hypertonic saline carrier. With the modulation of harmful side effects of HBOCs through future research, they are a promising alternative in scenarios where stored red blood cells are unavailable. Future studies could include testing the effects of HT-HBOC on other the immunomodulatory side effects of HBOCs.

EVALUATION OF THE TRANSMETALLATION OF GD DTPA BMA AND GD HPDO3A IN THE PRESENCE OF ZINC CITRATE
Jacob Troy Gibby
Springville High School, Springville, UT

To increase the efficiency of MRIs, contrast agents are used to brighten various areas of the body, such as tumors. Gadolinium is in every contrast agent used today because of its unique ability to affect the local magnetic field, but it is also toxic. To prevent harming patients, chelates are bound to the gadolinium to keep it from reacting with the body. <br><br> There have been reports of a deadly disease known as Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis caused by gadolinium-based contrast agents that were formerly declared safe. After significant research, I found that manufacturers creating these contrast agents tested them in an isolated environment. However, the body is a changing environment.<br><br> My project consisted of analyzing two of the five contrast agents on the market, Gd DTPA BMA and GD HPDO3A, by injecting equimolar concentrations of a contrast agent and zinc citrate into an HPLC machine. This allowed me to determine the thermodynamic and kinetic stability, and the half-life of the contrast agents in the presence of zinc citrate. <br><br> I found that Gd DTPA BMA broke apart at an average of 110 minutes in the presence of zinc citrate. Gd HPDO3A broke apart at a much slower rate. Gd DTPA BMA has the potential to cause major problems the longer it is within the body. This experiment also shows a simple and inexpensive way that pharmaceutical companies can accurately test the stability of their contrast agent in a body-like environment, and therefore choose the safest agent for human use.

ARE RED DRINKS SAFE FOR CHILDREN? DETERMINATION OF ALLURA RED (FD&C RED 40) IN BEVERAGES AND PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF CYTOTOXICITY
Delaney Leigh Thompson
Hellgate High School, Missoula, MT

Allura Red (AR; FD&C Red 40, Food Red 17) is a controversial additive used to colorize foods. Although it adds no nutritional value and consumption has been associated with ADHD and hyperactivity in children use of AR remains high in US. However, it is not easy to restrict consumption of AR because beverage labels do not indicate the amount. Moreover, there is little to no data comparing the amount of AR in drinks targeted for small children versus beverages aimed at adults. This study determined the presence and relative amount of AR in four beverages marketed for adults, young adults/teenagers and small children. Thin layer chromatography was first used to show that AR is present in ICE Black Raspberry, Gatorade Fruit Punch, and Tum-E Yummies Fruitabulous Punch, but not in Neuro-sonic. Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy validated the presence of AR in these three drinks and a standard curve was used to determine the quantities of AR in Gatorade at 0.75 mg/oz, ICE at 3.07 mg/oz, and Tum-E Yummies at 1.03 mg/oz. AR was found to be cytotoxic to a brain tumor cell line at concentrations above 0.2 mM suggesting a disruption in cellular metabolism and function. Future work is aimed at measuring the presence of AR in other red food products, and evaluating a possible biochemical connection between AR and hyperexcitability.

NOVEL STRATEGIES FOR THE PET IMAGING OF COLORECTAL CANCER USING THE A33 ANTIBODY
Priya Mohindra
Yorktown High School, Yorktown Heights, NY

Positron emission tomography (PET) is a highly sensitive, non-invasive technology that is widely used in the diagnosis and treatment planning of cancer. Current PET tracers, however, often target tumor metabolism rather than specific tumor cell biomarkers. To this end, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) labeled with radionuclides have emerged as useful devices in PET imaging of cancer cells because mAbs are known to bind to their antigen targets with high specificity. This research explored the synthesis of an imaging agent using the A33 antibody, which targets the A33 antigen expressed on colon cancer cells, and the positron-emitting radionuclide 89Zr (half-life of 78 hours). The A33 antibody was successfully radiolabeled with radioactive 89Zr using a chelator called desferrioxamine (DFO). Further tests meant to characterize this radiolabeled compound demonstrated that it is stable in a physiological environment (37°C) for up to seven days, and an immunoreactivity assay showed that the initial chelator modification of the antibody did not significantly compromise the ability of the A33-DFO-89Zr compound to bind to its antigen on colon cancer cells. In addition, an imaging study of the A33-DFO-89Zr imaging compound in mice bearing SW1222 A33-antigen expressing colorectal cancer xenografts indicated high specific uptake and localization of the compound in tumors as well as good tumor-to-background activity ratios. A subsequent biodistribution study confirmed these findings, showing that the tumor maintained high uptake of the imaging compound during the imaging period. The results from these experiments demonstrate the radiolabeled A33-DFO-89Zr compound holds promise in the field of cancer diagnostics.

SYNTHETIC ANALOGS OF IGF-1 RECEPTOR JUXTAMEMBRANE DOMAIN: POTENT INHIBITORS OF CANCER CELL GROWTH
Liv Helena Johannessen
Governor Thomas Johnson High School, Frederick, MD

The insulin-like growth factor receptor type one (IGF-1R) belongs to a large class of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and plays a key role in the growth and metastasis of tumor cells, making it a promising target for cancer treatment. Significant effort has been made by pharmaceutical industry towards development of small molecule inhibitors and antibodies targeting the receptor. Unfortunately, most small molecule IGF-1R inhibitors also inhibit closely related Insulin Receptor, resulting in unwanted side-effects. Juxtamembrane (JM) regions of RTKs have been shown to play a crucial autoinhibitory role in the function of receptors. I have used this property along with the unique primary structure of the IGF-1R JM to construct cell-permeable synthetic analogs of the JM. Structure optimization studies allowed generation of compounds that potently inhibited growth of cancer cells. Cell toxicity was determined by calorimetric (MTT) assay on MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The shortest active inhibitor obtained is a palmytoilated 12 amino acid residues long peptide that inhibits growth of breast cancer cells with GI50 of 70 nM . Circular Dichriosm spectroscopy shows that peptides adopt a beta-type conformation in aqueous solution. The retro-inverso all D-amino acid versions of peptides showed even higher activity and a higher degree of folding. Palmitylation has proven important for activity and efficient folding of the inhibitors. Successful targeting of IGF-1R pathway in cancer cells was confirmed by inhibition of IGF1-dependent cell growth and AKT activation. Structural analogs of IGF-1R juxtamembrane region are promising drug candidates for the treatment of many tumor types.

A NEW REGULATORY PATHWAY FOR TUMOR SUPPRESSOR P53 ACTIVITY IN CANCER CELLS
Monika Laszkowska
St. Francis Preparatory School, Fresh Meadows, New York, USA

The exact mechanisms by which the p53 gene regulates various target genes in tumor suppression are not fully understood. Acetylation is one p53 regulatory pathway that enhances p53 transactivational activity. Using a reporter gene system and acetylation mutant forms of the p53 gene, this research examined the effect of acetylation on p53-mediated transcriptional activation. The p53K-Q mutant (which mimics fully acetylated p53) induced a 100% increase in transactivational activity compared to wild type p53 and the p53K-R mutant (which cannot be acetylated). This was further confirmed using drug treatment analysis on endogenous p53 target genes in cancer cells. Finally, a new approach to regulation of p53 activity via acetylation was explored. A new technique called RNA interference (RNAi) was used to down-regulate Sir2, a deacetylase of p53, thus inducing high levels of acetylated p53. This research not only provided novel and significant confirmation of the fundamental regulatory mechanisms of p53, but also developed a new method to activate p53 by down regulating Sir2 using RNAi. These findings provide a new weapon in future cancer research and in a genetic approach to cancer therapy.

LIPODYSTROPHY PROTEIN SEIPIN FUNCTIONS IN LIPID DROPLET BIOGENESIS AND MORPHOLOGY
Anita Sanjay Chandrahas
Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science, Denton, TX

The objective of this study was to elucidate the role of seipin, a protein that plays a role in human lipodystrophy, but whose function is entirely unknown. Lipodystrophy is a disorder characterized by an absence of normal adipose tissue. Individuals with this disease often have higher rates of circulating triglycerides, fatty livers, and other complications similar to those found in patients with diabetes or obesity. Thus, the results are applicable to other metabolism related diseases.<br><br> This investigation specifically focuses on the role of seipin in lipid droplet biogenesis and cell physiology. Lipid droplets (LDs) are the main cellular organelles within adipose tissue and are often absent or abnormal in lipodystrophy and in a variety of other metabolic disorders. Using genomic and plasmid transformations in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, proteins in the LD pathway were tagged with fluorescence and viewed under a fluorescent microscope. Data was then quantified by scoring cells for colocalization.<br><br> The results showed that seipin does colocalize to specific LD proteins and an absence of seipin affects LD-organelle interactions. In carbon-free media, an absence of seipin leads to increased cell death as compared to wild-type cells. <br><br> In conclusion, this research helps identify where the protein seipin fits in the LD biogenesis pathway. Knowing where seipin fits in the pathway of LD biogenesis will promote understanding of lipodystrophy as well as other metabolism-related diseases for future drug development. The work also suggests that seipin may have much broader functions in cell regulation, leading to applications in aging and cancer research.

A RAPID IMMUNOASSAY FOR DENATURED B-LACTOGLOBULIN, AN INDICATOR FOR THE QUALITY CONTROL OF PROCESSED MILK
TZU YT PENG
National Hsinchu Girls' Senior High School, Hsinchu City, Taiwan (R.O.C.) 

It is always questionable whether there is a nutritional difference between raw milk and processed milk. Recent findings indicate that b-lactoglobulin, one of the major milk proteins that can be directly absorbed in the gastro-intestinal system, may function as an agent for lowering serum cholesterol and as a free radical scavenger. In this study, I found that lactoglobulin was substantially denatured in processed milk and then developed a rapid method for distinguishing raw milk and all other processed milks by using a monoclonal antibody specific to denatured lactoglobulin. The method is utilizing a sanded-tip of glass rods with procedures involves binding of milk proteins, blocking, reaction with a peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibody, and color development. The procedure can be completed within eight minutes and is highly specific. It enables us to monitor the denaturing process of b-lactoglobulin in raw milk heated at different temperature for different durations. Moreover, I found that the level of denatured b-lactoglobulin was inversely correlated with the antioxidant activity in market-available milk products, including fresh, ultra-heated, and dry milks. In summary, I developed a rapid and simple monoclonal antibody-based method for identifying denatured b-lactoglobulin, which was inversely correlated with the antioxidant activity that may be deemed to be one of the indicators on the overall quality of various milk products.

PRODUCTION OF ETHANOL BY VACUUM PROCESS
Jessica Lynn Laviolette
Brandon High School, Ortonville Michigan, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine if, through the use of a scientific vacuum and a selectively permeable membrane, ethanol can be produced more efficiently and in a higher concentration. To determine this, ethanol-producing yeast was put into a vacuum chamber and then a scientific vacuum created a perfect vacuum in its chamber. Nitrogen gas was then allowed back into the chamber via a gas inlet valve. The yeast was forced to produce ethanol through alcoholic fermentation because the yeast's final electron acceptor, oxygen, was not present. To determine the amount of ethanol produced, the ethanol, water, glucose, and fructose solution produced after fementation (125.0 ml) was distilled. By determining the density of the solution collected from the final distillation (25.0 ml) and plugging in the temperature in degress Celsius at which the density of the solution was determined into an online equation for distillers, it was determined that the final 25.0 ml solution collected was 93.3% ethanol, which means that 23.3 ml of the 25.0 ml from the final distillation was ethanol. I then divided the 23.3 ml by 125.0 ml (the original amount of solution collected before distillation) to determine the ethanol concentration before distillation, which was 18.6% ethanol.

HOW DOES THE EBOLA MATRIX PROTEIN, VP40, FORM VIRIONS AT THE LIPID MEMBRANE?
Michael David Hunckler
Marian High School, Mishawaka, IN

Viruses are commonly known to be the cause of many diseases, some known to be quite fatal. Fatal viruses, such as the Ebola virus, have no antiviral therapy to eradicate them. The pathogenesis of these viruses depends on infection, replication, and generation of new virions. There is a paucity of knowledge regarding how the viral proteins interact with the lipid membrane and bud to form virions to infect other cells. The circumstances involved with viral budding were investigated with three procedures. The VP40 matrix protein from Ebola was used because it has been shown to induce impressive membrane curvature changes. The first procedure measured the amount of VP40 that bonded and deformed various lipid vesicles. This showed that VP40 binds and interacts the most with phosphatidylserine (PS). The second procedure measured lipid monolayer penetration by VP40. Again, the VP40 matrix protein revealed a high PS lipid affinity. The third procedure comprised of scans of fluorescently tagged viral proteins budding, interacting with, and exiting HEK 293 cells. From this data, it can be concluded that the VP40 matrix protein binds and interacts with the lipid membrane. In addition to interaction with the lipid membrane, the VP40 matrix protein induces lipid membrane curvature changes. This knowledge of the matrix protein and lipid membrane interactions is the prerequisite to antiviral therapy for the virus.

COMPARING MITOCHONDRIAL DNA THROUGH ELECTROPHORESIS AND DNA TERMINATOR SEQUENCING
Isaac Michael Ketcham
Farmington High School, Farmington NM, USA

This research experiment compared a 440 base pair (BP) segment, (known as the non-coding region) of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of four generations of an extended family, tracing back to a great-great-great-grandmother. If mtDNA is always passed maternally, then all members in this maternal family line should have the same mtDNA sequence. <br><br> Eighteen subjects of this family, and one control subject, provided oral epithelium samples by swishing and spitting a 0.9% NaCl solution. The mtDNA was isolated through a process of cell lysis and centrifugation. The non-coding region was amplified (copied millions of times) by a process of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). MtDNA amplification was confirmed by electrophoresis. The sequence of this mtDNA segment was determined by terminator sequencing. <br><br> The control sample had many (15-25) conflicting BP with the family samples. Among the family samples, there were two identical pairs (but different from each other by 4 BP). Cousins were compared with each other at multiple generational levels. Comparison among the 3rd generation 1st cousins, and the 5th generation 3rd cousins, yielded an average of 8-9 conflicting BP. There was no clear pattern of inheritance of these BP variations. <br><br> The hypothesis that mtDNA is passed maternally was not fully supported. This study showed variability in the mtDNA throughout the family being studied. In addition, there is a trend toward increasing BP variations with the age of the subject. Potential explanation include: spontaneous point mutations, heteroplasmy with variable distribution of mitochondria with cell division, and sequencing error.<br><br>

Gene analysis for Multiple Sclerosis on 12p12 in a large North American pedigree was conducted, focusing on the localization of a gene(s) in the previously identified locus found to be in linkage with MS in the studied family. Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were carried out using DNA (isolated from whole blood of individuals in the pedigree examined) and primers to amplify exonic regions of the DNA, which were to be analyzed separately. The products were then purified and sequencing reactions were then set up for analysis on a genetic analysis and sequencing system. C1R, known to be a complement component 1, was analyzed because it fell in the genomic region of interest, located between the flanking markers D12S1715 and GATA63D01 on chromosome 12p12. Subsequently, the output for each exonic region was aligned with the known complement component 1, r subcomponent (C1R) sequence in order to find regions containing a possible mutation. Sequencing graphs were consulted to check for polymorphisms and mutations also. DNA samples of two patients were analyzed. No mutations were found thus far.

ANODIC STRIPPING VOLTAMMETRY FOR MERCURY IN VARIOUS FISH SAMPLES
Jason G Leung
Homestead High School, Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA

Government reports published in early 2004 identified Noble County of Indiana as the single worst concentration of mercury contamination in the nation. Indiana has twenty-three coal-fired power plants, fourth most in the nation, which contribute mercury emissions into the air. These emissions are eventually deposited into water bodies through precipitation, causing environmental problems in local lakes and rivers. State health officials have issued advisories warning women to limit fish consumption during pregnancy to avoid exposing their unborn children to unsafe levels of methylmercury.<br><br>Current mercury detection procedures require the use of slow, expensive, and complicated testing, usually by atomic absorption and plasma atomic emission spectroscopic methods. This project explores the use of anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) with an unmodified carbon paste electrode (CPE) as alternative means to the quantification of mercury in water and fish tissues. Analysis using two different quantification techniques was performed on water samples from several lakes and well water in Northeastern Indiana, as well as liquefied fish tissues purchased locally. Results from the research show that local lakes and locally-caught fish are indeed contaminated with various levels of mercury. This method offers an alternate and safe technique to quantify mercury, allowing the expansion of testing facilities to smaller local towns or colleges. By further refining and conducting research on anodic stripping voltammetry, it has the potential for greater commercial and educational use and helps bring attention to Indiana’s mercury contamination problem. <br><br>

CHARACTERIZING THE COPPER BRIDGED INTERMEDIATE OF THE COPPER TRANSFER REACTION
Kush Jayesh Sharma
Kalamazoo Area Mathematics and Science Center, Kalamazoo, MI

Copper has an integral function within the overall homeostasis of the body. Copper is regulated very tightly by a series of proteins that shuttle copper around the cell to be either inserted into proteins or moved to vesicles and excreted. One specific protein involved in copper regulation within the cells is the wilson disease protein (WLN). This protein is important to the removal of excess copper from the cell; improper regulation leads to liver cirrhosis or brain damage leading to a possible cause of Alzheimer's. Specifically, a copper chaperone, (HAH1), acquires the copper in the cytosol and delivers it to a specific domain on the n-terminal sequence (WD4) of the WLN protein; where it is finally gets transferred into the appropriate vesicle. The interaction between HAH1 and WD4 involves two specific cysteines on each protein that become bound to the copper. The transfer process requires several coordination states of the copper that ensure proper transfer. The coordination state of interest was a presumed 3-coordinate copper thiolate intermediate that would exist during the shuttling process. The strategy used to "trap" this elusive intermediate was to mutate each of the pertinent cysteines to an alanine. Titrations were done with native copper-protein (low and high concentrations) and each mutated apo-protein to construct the proposed 3-coordinate copper thiolate structure. The recombinant protein was grown in a prokaryote for this study. The nature of these newly formed structures was monitored and found by specific increases in uv-visible light and fluorescence spectroscopy indicative of copper thiolate bonds, as well as more definitive evidence from EXAFS and NMR. Lower and higher concentrations of copper were seen to give positive data as well as the preliminary data for the WD4-WD1 copper 3-coordinate copper thiolate structure. Future work includes confirming this 3-coordinate coordination state at different places in the copper transfer process at the wilson disease protein as well as the current WD4-WD1 copper interaction.

DEVELOPMENT OF A SURFACE PLASMON RESONANCE BIOASSAY: IMMOBILIZATION OF MEMBRANES CONTAINING THE HIV-1 CORECEPTOR CCR5
Evan Alex Karlik
Montgomery Blair High School, Silver Spring, Maryland, United States

The CCR5 transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor has been shown to facilitate infection by macrophage-tropic HIV-1; its CC chemokine ligands have implications in delaying the progression of the virus. Receptor-ligand interactions can be simultaneously orchestrated and studied with high sensitivity using the optical technique of surface plasmon resonance (SPR); an SPR bioassay was developed for the study of binding between the CCR5 receptor and its chemokine ligands. Self-assembled alkanethiol monolayers incorporating terminal biotin moieties were formed on gold films and modified with streptavidin, biotinylated secondary antibodies, and primary antibodies to immobilize membranes containing CCR5 receptors outfitted with the carboxyl-terminal nine amino acid rho 1D4 epitope from bovine opsin. A mixed monolayer of HS(CH ) -O(CH CH O) -CH and HS(CH ) -(OCH CH ) -NHCO(CH ) -biotin was found to be the most effective at facilitating avidin binding to surface biotin moieties and resisting nonspecific bovine serum albumin and fibrinogen adsorption. Following membrane immobilization via the use of rho 1D4 as the primary antibody, specific binding of rho 1D4 out of solution and the lack of nonspecific rho 4D2 adsorption indicate the presence of CCR5 on the surface. The results of this work can be applied in the continued development of SPR bioassays for CCR5 and other transmembrane proteins, useful for basic biochemistry research and for the screening of drug candidates. <br><br>Keywords: CCR5, CC chemokines, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), alkanethiol self-assembled monolayer (SAM), membrane immobilization, transmembrane proteins<br><br>

FOXO1 SIGNALING/AKT-MEDIATED PHOSPHORYLATION AND NOVEL MORPHOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF MUSCLE FIBERS IN SKELETAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY
Saad Ahmed Khan
Lane Technical High School, Chicago, IL

Skeletal muscular atrophy is a muscle debilitating consequence in multiple clinical conditions: cancer, diabetes mellitus, AIDS, heart and renal failure, stroke, and aging (sarcopenia), affecting over 500 million patients worldwide. Nearly $4.5 billion are spent annually in the U.S. for rehabilitation costs; the geriatric population is also expected to grow to be 19% of the current population by 2030, increasing the prevalence of muscle atrophy. The purpose of this experiment is to determine the role of FoxO1, a transcriptional factor and forkhead-box gene, in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathway, which is involved in the pathogenesis of muscle atrophy. <br><br>Tissues of wildtype, FoxO1 transgenic, atrogin-1 knockout, and transgenic/knockout mice were tested. Through immunohistochemistry and novel morphometric analysis, the myosin heavy chain type 2a muscle fiber size decreased by 450 µm² (p=0.048) and by 1800 µm² (p=0.017) in the 2b muscle fibers of the tibialis anterior muscles from the wildtype to FoxO1 transgenic mice. The type 1 muscle fibers decreased by 400 µm² (p=0.009) and by 600 µm² (p=0.036) in the 2a muscle fibers of the soleus muscles in the same comparison. Immunoblots were used to identify the proteins of the PI3K/AKT pathway. <br><br>Overexpression of FoxO1 decreased the type 1, 2a, and 2b muscle fiber sizes in transgenic mice. Furthermore, Muscle-RING finger-1 and other atrogenes played a role in protein degradation, not just atrogin-1 as originally hypothesized. In the PI3K/AKT pathway, FoxO1 allosterically inhibited the upstream effects of insulin and insulin-like growth factors, a very novel finding. The future directives are to explore treatment methods that can directly inhibit FoxO transcriptional factors to cure muscle atrophy.<br><br>

LEADS FOR DRUG DISCOVERY USING CHINESE TRADITIONAL MEDICINE AND A YEAST CELL BASED BIOASSAY
Kinsey Taylor Morrison
Saint Francis School, Louisville, KY

The estrogen receptor mediated pathway is activated when naturally occurring female sex hormones, or a variety of chemically diverse compounds that mimic estrogen, bind to the ER protein. I focused on identifying phytoestrogens, plant-derived estrogen mimics. My project’s purpose was to develop a yeast cell-based bioassay to test extracts of herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine, Yi Mu Cao (Leonurue heterophyllus) and Yin Yang Huo (Herba epimedii), for estrogenic mimicry. Both treat reproductive issues, so they were promising phytoestrogen candidates. Engineered yeast cells (BJ3505) were constructed using recombinant DNA technology to introduce a plasmid encoding hERa (YEpE12) and a separate reporter plasmid (YRG2) containing an ERE sequence fused to a ß-galactosidase reporter gene. When yeast cells are induced with copper sulfate and then treated with a naturally occurring estrogen or mimic, they produce ß-galactosidase. The activity level of the enzyme is directly related to the action of the candidate agent or extract. The intensity of the yellow colored product, o-nitrophenyl, may be determined from readings at OD420 nm of the reactions, which reflect the level of ß-galactosidase produced. My experiments were unable to detect significant estrogenic activities in either Yi Mu Cao (Leonurue heterophyllus) or Wedelia trilobata Asteraceae under the limited conditions of my assay. However, my results clearly and reproducibly showed extracts of YYH plants had significant estrogenic activity (65% of the 10 nM estrone control) in the yeast cell-based bioassay, and its response appeared to be dose dependent. My observation appears to be original and is an exciting lead for identifying the active compound(s) in this plant after fractionation and testing in mammals.

NOVEL INHIBITORS OF CYTOKINES SIGNALING: DRUG CANDIDATES FOR THE TREATMENT OF CANCER AND INFLAMMATION
Joanna Ray-Jia Yeh
Urbana High School, Ijamsville, MD

The goal of the study was to explore different approaches of inhibiting cytokine signaling. There are currently no specific inhibitors of any cytokine, though they play important roles in cancer and inflammation. I focused on interferon gamma (IFNgamma) and interleukin 10 (IL10) signaling since both are important molecular targets. Because of the similarities between IFNgamma and IL10 receptor complexes and signaling mechanisms, I decided to develop inhibitors of IFNgamma and IL10 in parallel. Comparison of the cytoplasmic domains of the receptors sequences from different organisms allowed for the identification of regions that were highly conserved during evolution. I speculated that those regions are involved in essential interactions for the receptors’ function; thus compounds mimicking them may interfere with signaling. I synthesized lipopeptides derived from these regions, because lipidation was shown previously to make peptides cell-permeable and stabilize their secondary structures, and tested their ability to interfere with growth promoting effects of IFNgamma and IL10. <br><br> I identified several lead dominant negative inhibitors of IL10 and IFNgamma signaling, and have conducted exploratory structural optimization. These compounds are powerful tools in the investigation of molecular mechanisms and biological roles of IFNgamma and IL10 signaling. Further optimization of compounds is likely to result in development of new therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases. This method of mimicking conserved regions of cytokines and their receptors has proven to be a productive approach in identifying inhibitors of cytokines signaling, and is likely to be applicable to other cytokines.

A POTENTIAL NEW APPROACH TO CHEMOTHERAPY IN BRAIN TUMORS: DISRUPTION OF CONNEXIN 43 PARTICLE ARRANGEMENT TO INDUCE APOPTOSIS IN MALIGNANT
Yale Stern Michaels
Grant Park High School, WInnipeg Manitoba, Canada

The purpose of this project was to evaluate the importance of Gap junctions, specifically those formed by Connexin 43 (Cx43), in the survival of malignant glioma cells. The Experiment was designed to determine the effect of the level of Cx43 expression on rates of apoptosis in cancer cells either treated or untreated with the chemotherapeutic agent Temozolomide. <br><br> Two cell lines were used in experimentation; c6 glioma wild type cells expressing very low levels of Cx43 and c6-13 glioma expressing very high levels of Cx43. Cells from both cell types were either treated or untreated with 2.5 mM Temozolomide, a dose established in a dose response trial. Following treatment, apoptosis, or programmed cell death, was measured using both Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorting and Acridine Orange Analysis. Results showed much higher rates of cell death in both treated and untreated c6 wild type cells compared to c6-13 cells. <br><br> Because a decrease in Cx43 expression had such a significant affect on apoptosis, Gap junction inhibitors were tested as a potential means of killing c6 glioma cells. A small concentration (50 uM) of the gap junction inhibitor 18 Beta Glycyrrhetinic Acid (18-âGA) was highly effective at increasing the level of apoptosis in both cell types, treated or untreated with Temozolomide.<br><br> Gap junction inhibition using small doses of 18-âGA was four times more effective at causing apoptosis than chemotherapy alone. Gap junction inhibitors and chemotherapy combined caused apoptosis in more than 80% of the Glioma cells. Gap junction inhibition shows great promise in cancer treatment. <br><br>

FROM MODELS TO MEDICATIONS: IDENTIFICATION OF MEDICATION LEADS FOR TREATING METHAMPHETAMINE ADDICTION
Yamini T. Naidu
Valley Catholic High School, Beaverton, OR

Methamphetamine (METH) is an addictive psychostimulant that interferes with dopamine signaling in the brain. In vitro METH activates human Trace Amine-Associated Receptor 1 (hTAAR1), a recently cloned G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). METH-activated TAAR1-mediated signaling contributes to the drug’s addiction liability, making this receptor a novel target for medications designed to prolong abstinence from METH abuse. <br><br> My approach to exploring the thesis that hTAAR1 plays a role in human METH abuse led to my formulation of three null hypotheses: (a) three binding sites will not be identified in more than one hTAAR1 model; (b) mutating key amino acids will have no effect on ligand-receptor interactions; and (c) top compounds will not be identified by more than one hTAAR1 model. <br><br> In the course of my experimentation, I discovered two novel, potential allosteric sites, which I call Sites II and III and determined their key amino acids. This observation led me to predict that Site II and Site III-preferring compounds bind to their respective allosteric sites, thereby altering hTAAR1’s conformation and the release of METH bound to Site I, currently proposed by researchers to be the main site of where METH binds. <br><br> Guided by the 3D structures of Sites II and III, I designed novel compounds that have promising potential based on in silico experimentation. My long-range goal is to synthesize my compounds. These findings should be helpful in the rational drug design of a novel anti-METH medication lead and can potentially be applied to other diseases and the environment.

GEOMETRIC AND AMINO ACID COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS PROTEINS
Jane Fomina
Westfield High School, Westfield, MA

The chief objective in conducting this experiment is to determine the region of bonding between the Epithelial Na+ Channel (ENaC) and the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) proteins. To accurately establish the respective combining regions, it is necessary to identify the conserved domains of the amino acid sequences and determine the strongest force field regions of the structural models. <br><br>The geometric structures of the CFTR and ENaC proteins are studied through the synthesis of information from the Protein Data Bank and the Deep View Swiss-Pdb Viewer of the Expert Protein Analysis System (ExPASy). The developed three dimensional models of the proteins are used to determine each amino acid’s accessibility for interaction, polarity, acidity, hydrogen bonding, bond angles, influence of van der Waal forces, influence of electrostatic forces, and the strength of force field energies. The analysis of the gathered data isolates the most probable residues of interaction in both proteins. <br><br>The proteins are also studied by their amino acid sequences. The BLAST database is used to find closely resembling proteins in other species while the multiple sequence alignment program T-COFFEE allows for the comparing of the studied protein to the sequences of the distantly related species. <br><br>Combining the data of structurally accessible residues with the data of conserved amino acid sequences proves that CFTR’s most probable region of interaction is between amino acids Ser631 and Lys643 while ENaC’s most probable region of interaction is between amino acids Thr498 and Pro614.

BASE LESION FORMATION BY GLYCIDAMIDE ON DNA SUBSTRATES - A CARCINOGENIC PATHWAY
Lindsey Marie Hubley
Woods Cross High School, Woods Cross, Utah, United States of America

The Maillard “browning reaction” when starchy foods are cooked produces acrylamide (AA). AA levels in a single serving of fried potato exceed the EPA limit by five hundred fold. The liver CYP2E1 enzyme metabolizes AA to glycidamide (GA). GA is very reactive with DNA.<br><br>- The objective of this work: Determine the stage of transcription that DNA is most susceptible to damage from glycidamide. Single strand DNA was used to simulate the single strand “bubble” created during transcription.<br><br>- Research elsewhere has focused on GA treatment of tissue, serum and whole cells, not oligonucleotides as used in this experiment.<br><br>- An internal control was created by treating individual bases A, T, G & C with GA. The treated samples were run on HPLC to characterize the base and adduct peaks. <br><br>- A single strand tetramer, ATGC, was treated and cleaved into nucleosides and nucleoside adducts with Snake Venom Phosphodiesterase and Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase. HPLC and mass spectrometry followed to determine and quantify damage. <br><br>- A 18mer oligo was treated in 3 configurations: primary strand, complementary strand, and duplex. The bases initial mass in the 2 single strands equaled the initial mass of bases in the duplex. Additional peaks shown through HPLC graphs for the single strands, proved that more adducts were formed with the single strands than the duplex.<br><br>- Validation of results proceeded with treatment of a 30mer double strand oligo containing a 6mer bubble.<br><br>This work provides insight into the genotoxic mechanism of glycidamide. Avoiding fried starchy foods is good prevention.<br><br>

DETERMINING THE CAUSE FOR THE EVOLUTIONARY PHENOMENON OF ADP-GLUCOSE PYROPHOSPHORYLASE'S SUBUNITS
Nancy Mylan Dong
Sarasota High School, Sarasota FL, U.S.A.

Found in almost every plant, eaten by almost every person and animal; starch is a major component of our lives. Vital to the synthesis of starch, ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), consists of two identical large and two identical small subunits, encoded in maize endosperm as shrunken-2 and brittle-2, respectively. AGPase catalyzes the reaction which produces the precursors for the synthesis of starch. It has been found that the small subunit of the enzyme is more conserved. To explain the different sequence divergence between the two subunits, it was hypothesized that the small subunit interacts with several large subunits. Therefore the small subunit cannot tolerate mutations due to risk of a dysfunctional complex with the various large subunits. To test this hypothesis, Bt2 mutant was expressed into E.coli with the large subunits by electro-transformation. Then the colonies were analyzed by a spectrophotometer for glycogen production as representative of enzyme activity.<br><br>One third of the mutants tested showed significant differences in enzyme activity between the two large subunits. Supporting the hypothesis, results show that the effect of the mutations in the small subunit on AGPase activity depends on the identity of the large subunit. This gives reason to the conserved nature of the small subunit. Ultimately, with more understanding of the enzyme leads to the ability of genetic manipulation to control starch production.<br><br>

DEVELOPING AN INDUCIBLE, NEURAL CELL MODEL OF POLYGLUTAMINE AGGREGATION AND TOXICITY
Jeremy Gordon Price
Jericho High School, Jericho, NY, USA

The polyglutamine (polyQ) neurodegenerative diseases comprise at least nine disorders caused by expanded CAG (glutamine) repeats in the disease proteins. The polyQ diseases are characterized by abnormal protein conformation and cell death. In this study, the objective was to create an inducible, neuronal cell model of polyQ disease, focusing on Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3.<br><br>Neuronal cell lines are created that inducibly express the c-terminal fragment of ataxin-3 with either a normal or an expanded polyQ domain. The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the relevant c-terminal region of normal or expanded ataxin-3. After amplification, the resultant product was digested at the appropriate restriction sites and subcloned into the tetracycline-inducible, eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA5-TO. The plasmids were then transfected into a neuronal cell line of PC6-3-TR cells that permit tetracycline-inducible expression of the plasmid. The cells were exposed to tetracycline and the ataxin-3 constructs were expressed. Stably transfected cell lines are being expanded for analysis.<br><br>Preliminary results of stably transfected cells have shown that normal and expanded ataxin-3 constructs are expressed. Moreover, as anticipated, mutant ataxin-3 fragments, but not normal ataxin-3 fragments, form intranuclear aggregates in these cells. Further studies will be needed to confirm tetracycline inducibility and to assess whether mutant ataxin-3 fragments cause cell death in an aggregation dependent manner. These neuronal cell lines should prove useful in ongoing laboratory studies to identify polyQ-mediated changes in gene and protein expression and to screen for possible suppressors of polyQ toxicity.

MUTX: MICROENVIRONMENT INDUCTION AFFECTING CELLULAR ARCHITECTURE, MIGRATION, AND CELL DIFFERENTIATION
Beatriz Alexandra Salvesen Von Essen
Academia del Perpetuo Socorro San Juan, Puerto Rico

C6 tumor brain cell line was used in this investigation. Purpose: Establish MuTX by light spectroscopy; compare development growth; and establish diffrences in the cellular architecture, migration, and differentiation. Methods: MuTX, a sea cucumber mucous secretion, is extracted from the Holothurian mexicana Ludwig by epidermal tissue stimulation. Cell were grown in 2.5ml of media and 1.5ml of treatment or saline as a control. Placed at 37C, the cells were observed every 24 hours for four days to make cell counts in previously established cell sites. Results: Experimental groups were blocked in a specific cell cycle growth stage and their count declained by observation site. Conclusion: (1) Experimental groups, with a reduction in growth the MuTX may have blocked the oscillator genes causing the cell to decline its rate factor and pausing before entering S-phase making the cell enter a prolonged rest period and ultimately die. (2) The MuTX, apparently, also blocked or changed the arrangement of Cyclin and Kinase into the cell thereby blocking the protein and not letting the cell go in or out of the stage into the next mitosis phase. By not doing so the cell maintains an immature physical appearance, just like the one seen in the experimental growth, and soon dies. Two possible explanations can be for the experimental microenvironment treatment cells effect. The two cell division events that need to be controlled are the entry into the S-phase when DNA is replicated, and the entry into M-phase when mitosis occurs (Phillip McClean, 1997) this is why the main inductions of the experimentation are in mitosis and in the cells S-phase.

SIZE-DEPENDENT CYTOKINE RELEASE FROM MURINE MACROPHAGES BY GLYCOPEPTIDE-COATED GOLD NANOPARTICLES
Quentin Kai Aknin
Punahou School, Honolulu, HI

Tumor cells have many carbohydrates on them which are much different than those found on normal cells. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have previously been used in medical studies as carriers of tumor associated carbohydrate antigens. Different sized AuNPs have their own specific properties, thus we have produced three different sized citrate-stabilized AuNPs (16nm, 25nm and 40nm), coated them with various ligands and studied their ability to elicit cytokine production in murine macrophages. AuNPs were prepared displaying 1) a peptide sequence from mucin 4 (MUC4), a mucin upregulated in certain tumors, 2) or several MUC4 peptides glycosylated with the Thomsen-Friedenreich disacchride, a tumor-associated carbohydrate expressed on many tumor mucins. Details of the synthesis of each particle along with results from cytokine release experiments will be presented.

APIS MELLIFERA'S HONEY AS A VACCINATION AND PREVENTION METHOD AGAINST ZUCCHINI YELLOW MOSAIC VIRUS (ZYMV) AND PAPAYA RINGSPOT VIRUS(PRSV) AFFECTING CUCURBITA MAXIMA DUCH CROPS IN PUERTO RICO
Caroline Lopez
Brigida Alvarez Rodriguez, Vega Baja, PUERTO RICO

This investigation was done for the purpose of finding a vaccination and prevention method against the Papaya ring spot virus (PRPV) and the Zucchini Yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV) in the Curcubita maxima duch crops in Puerto Rico. The hypothesis was, the seeds submerged in Apis mellifera’s honey will be resistant to the viruses. The study represents the first and only successful vaccination made out of Apis mellifera’s honey, and also the only vaccination against Papaya ring spot virus (PRPV) and the Zucchini Yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV) naturally treated. Several important studies reveal Curcubita is in danger of virus contaminants that reduce its production. The seeds were submerged in honey and then were planted. After germination the first 2 leaves of the young plant were mechanically inoculated with the virus. Data evidenced that submerging the seeds of Cucurbita maxima Duch in Apis mellifera’s honey before the plant gets in contact with the viruses will create resistance to the virus. Plants exposed without this protection could not survive the virus. The plants treated survived and developed resistance to both viruses. This study also evidenced that this process accelerates germination. Apis mellifera’s honey is an antiseptic, an anti-virus in human and a germination accelerator in plants. It acts as an anti-virus and as a preventive method to these viruses infection. The results were clear; since the plants of treated seeds are still alive showing no symptoms it leads to conclude that the Apis mellifera’s honey is a vaccination and prevention method against virus.

IN PLANTA GENETIC MODIFICATION OF ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA BY AGROBACTERIUM TUMEFACIENS WITH THE GENE OF INTEREST BZO2H2
Albert Walter Souza Mülli
Escola Americana de Campinas, Campinas-São Paulo, Brazil

The objective targeted by this laboratory experiment was to effectively genetically modify seedling samples of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana with the gene Bzo2h2 from the bZIP transcription factor family, under the influence of the selection marker gene gus, through the in planta use of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The purpose of reaching this objective is to verify the efficiency of the Agrobacterium process and in order to determine where in a germinating plant would the gene be present and the implications of these results. <br><br> In order to complete this experimental procedure, vectors for plant transformation (pCAMBIA 2300) were manipulated and constructed through various processes of enzymatic digestion of original Arabidopsis thaliana sequences (for the acquirement of the Bzoh2h2 gene) and the progenitor plasmid pBI 121 (for the acquirement of the gus selection marker gene). The constructed vectors were then placed within Agrobacterium. The transformed bacteria were then sprayed onto flowering sprouts of A. thaliana plants, thus allowing the bacteria to infect the seeds of the plants and integrate the genome of the seeds of the flowering plant. The plants were then selected under a culture of antibiotic according to the surviving plants, which plants had been successfully transformed and which weren’t. <br><br> In the case of this specific experiment, the results showed that the roots of the plantlets became blue after a test with the X-Gluc acid, which in contact with the GUS protein causes the secretion of a blue pigment, which proves the success of the transformation.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF ZINC TOXICITY ON ZN CONCENTRATIONS, GROWTH, AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS OF BRASSICA OLERACEA
Leah Ruth Samuels
Benjamin Franklin High School, New Orleans, LA

The purpose of this experiment was to better understand the effects of Zinc toxicity in plants through studying the growth, chlorophyll, and Zn bio-concentration factors (BCF) of Brassica oleracea when exposed to various levels of Zn. It was hypothesized that as the amount of Zn in soil rises, chlorophyll, height, and dry weight of B.oleracea plants will decrease, but Zn levels in the leaves will increase. It was further hypothesized that Zn concentrations in B.oleracea leaves will exceed human dietary limitations in plants grown in soil contaminated with 200mg/kg ZnSO4 solutions but will not display visible phytotoxicity symptoms, while plants grown in soil contaminated with 300, 400, and 500mg/kg ZnSO4 solutions will exhibit visible phytotoxicity symptoms and will exceed Zn human dietary limitations in edible portions of the plant. Fifteen B.oleracea seedlings were split into five groups of three- the first group was the control, the second group received 200mg/kg ZnSO4, the third group received 300mg/kg, the fourth group received 400mg/kg, and the fifth group received 500mg/kg ZnSO4. Over a period of 40 days, chlorophyll readings were taken, plant heights were recorded, and the number of leaves was documented weekly. After about 40 days, the plants were harvested and soil and leaf samples were obtained from each plant to be analyzed for Zn using an ICP-AES. Using this data, BCFs and relative yield were calculated for each group of plants. The data indicated a decrease in chlorophyll levels, height, dry weight, and relative yield as soil Zn levels rose. There was no relationship between Zn and number of leaves. All contaminated plants exhibited visible phytotoxicity symptoms and the Zn concentrations in all contaminated plant leaves exceeded human dietary limitations.

USE OF HOMOLOGY MODELING AND MOLECULAR DOCKING TO MAP RETINOID BINDING SITES ON PROTEIN KINASE C
Jijun Chow
The Bronx High School of Science, Bronx, NY, USA

Retinol plays a pivotal role in nearly all genera. It is essential in vision, growth, reproduction, and cell differentiation. Some of its biologically active metabolites include retinoic acid, 14-hydroxy-retro-retinol, 13, 14-dihydroxy-retinol, and anhydroretinol. Retinoids are found to augment redox activation of the signaling molecule protein kinase C. Binding sites are associated with the cysteine-rich regions of the proteins. Observations for high binding affinity raise questions about where the substrates bind specifically to those regions. Knowing the precise shape and location of binding pockets on diverse PKCs, potential drug targets can be designed for novel therapies of cancer by employing a wide range of beneficial properties of retinoids. This study constructs three-dimensional models of the Cys-rich regions of ten PKC isoforms (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, eta, mu, theta, iota, zeta) through homology modeling, and predicts retinol and anhydroretinol binding sites through molecular docking. Docking trials of retinol binding to PKC alpha are then validated experimentally by fluorescence enhancement measurements using bacterially-expressed proteins provided by the laboratory. Results indicate that the Cys-rich regions conform to the same structural parameter. Additionally, two binding sites within each binding pocket of some isoforms are conjectured. Binding sites are located either near the termini or towards the middle of the regions. Predicted contact amino acid residues that interact with retinoids at each active site are then highlighted. Lastly, results obtained from the experiment are consistent with that from the computational study, proving the significance of some listed contact residues derived from the generated models. <br><br> <br><br>

COMPUTATIONAL MODELING OF THE QUANTUM MECHANICAL EXCITATIONS IN A LIGHT HARVESTING COMPLEX IN PURPLE BACTERIA
Michael Kaplan
The Bronx High School of Science, Bronx, NY

The energy harvesting mechanism in the light harvesting complexes in purple bacteria transfers energy with 99% efficiency. Intracomplex energy transfer is accomplished by Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). The purpose of this experiment was to show what effect disorder has on energy transfer. A C++ program was constructed to solve a Frenkel exciton Hamiltonian and simulate disorder. This was an important step in modeling single molecular spectroscopy which allows one to observe disorder in molecular systems. The ensemble line shapes of the gap distributions which were produced agree well with experimental data. Based on the ensemble line shapes it was determined that relatively small disorder in the system increases the efficiency of transfer by increasing the probability that Förster Resonance Energy Transfer will occur. This disproves a preconception from our knowledge of inorganic systems is that if there is disorder, it will create a sink that will trap energy and reduce energy harvesting. Insights gained from the study of the energy harvesting mechanism in purple bacteria eventually may be implemented in the design of more efficient inorganic energy harvesting technology.

ALDEHYDE DEHYDROGENASE 7A1 AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO PYRIDOXINE DEPENDENT EPILEPSY
Conor David Freeland
Minerva High School, Minerva, OH

The purpose of this project is to determine the location and sequence of the mutation affecting the family of a patient with PDE. Common mutations associated with this disorder have been found on exons 6, 10, and 14 of the ALDH7a1 gene in other families, therefore these exons were first investigated in the study family. Genomic DNA mouthwash samples were taken from the patient, her mother, and her father. These samples were amplified using oligonucleotide primers targeted to these three exons. The resulting segments of DNA were run on agarose gels to check for mutations that noticeably alter the length of the amplified product. These fragments were then eluted from the gel. Constructs were created using a plasmid vector and the eluted DNA fragments. These constructs were used to transform competent E. coli cells, and transformed cells were grown on ampicillin plates. Cloned DNA inserts will then be sequenced to determine any changes in exon sequence. The agarose gels indicate possible mutations of exon 10 in the family, because genomic DNA from control subjects gave consistent results, whereas exon 10 from the affected family did not amplify. Exon 10 also produced amplicons of two different sizes from the control subject, further suggesting that this exon is a site of heterogeneity. Exon 14 is successfully cloned, with no visible heterogeneity among the subjects. As the work continues, DNA sequencing will reveal whether the family has nonfunctioning gene variants involving these exons, and which exons are more likely to exhibit heterozygosity.

The purpose of this experiment was to better understand the effects of Zinc toxicity in plants through studying the growth, chlorophyll, and Zn bio-concentration factors (BCF) of Brassica oleracea when exposed to various levels of Zn. It was hypothesized that as the amount of Zn in soil rises, chlorophyll, height, and dry weight of B.oleracea plants will decrease, but Zn levels in the leaves will increase. It was further hypothesized that Zn concentrations in B.oleracea leaves will exceed human dietary limitations in plants grown in soil contaminated with 200mg/kg ZnSO4 solutions but will not display visible phytotoxicity symptoms, while plants grown in soil contaminated with 300, 400, and 500mg/kg ZnSO4 solutions will exhibit visible phytotoxicity symptoms and will exceed Zn human dietary limitations in edible portions of the plant. Fifteen B.oleracea seedlings were split into five groups of three- the first group was the control, the second group received 200mg/kg ZnSO4, the third group received 300mg/kg, the fourth group received 400mg/kg, and the fifth group received 500mg/kg ZnSO4.

Using this data, BCFs and relative yield were calculated for each group of plants. The data indicated a decrease in chlorophyll levels, height, dry weight, and relative yield as soil Zn levels rose. There was no relationship between Zn and number of leaves. All contaminated plants exhibited visible phytotoxicity symptoms and the Zn concentrations in all contaminated plant leaves exceeded human dietary limitations.

THE DISCOVERY OF MECHANISM OF ACTION OF A SMALL ANTI-HIV COMPOUND ADS-J1
Angi Guo
Stuyvesant High School, New York, NY

Entry inhibitors targeting the HIV envelope protein gp41 are major anti-HIV drugs. Recently, a small molecule anti-HIV-1 compound, ADS-J1, has been identified as an HIV entry inhibitor, but its mechanism of action remains unknown. The present study was aimed to explore the action mechanism of this compound. Surface plasma resonance assay was used to characterize the kinetic interaction of ADS-J1 with the polypeptide IQN17 which represents the hydrophobic pocket of gp41. Circular dichroism spectroscopy was used to examine the effect of ADS-J1 on the structure of IQN17. ELISA and native-gel electrophoresis were used to examine the effect of ADS-J1 on six-helix bundle formation between gp41 NHR and CHR peptides. I found that ADS-J1 bound to the polypeptide IQN17 with high affinity and that it induced conformational change in IQN17. Furthermore, ADS-J1 interfered with the six-helix bundle formation between the NHR and CHR peptides. These results suggest a novel mechanism of action of ADS-J1, i.e., it binds to the deep hydrophobic pocket in the gp41 coiled-coil domain, induces the conformational change of gp41 and blocks the association between the viral gp41 NHR and CHR regions to form the fusion-active gp41 core, thereby inhibiting HIV-1 fusion with the target cell membrane, and thus entry into the target cell. My discovery provides important information for design of small-molecule HIV fusion inhibitor as a novel anti-HIV drug. Discovery of the action mechanism of ADS-J1 has also opened new avenues for screening other anti-HIV drugs and development of antiviral compounds against other envelope viruses.

BIOCHEMICAL EVOLUTION OF THE BREAST CANCER-INHIBITING PROTEIN, BRCA-1, OVER HALF A BILLION YEARS.
Meaghan Alexandra Figge
Albany Academy for Girls, Albany, NY, United States of America

Inherited mutations in the tumor suppressor protein, BRCA-1, predispose to breast and ovarian cancer. Missense mutations frequently perturb strongly hydrophobic amino acids conserved among mammals in the C-terminal BRCT domain of BRCA-1. This domain binds to BACH-1, a transcriptional regulator, and is important for tumor suppression. It was hypothesized that conserved, strongly hydrophobic amino acids might cluster internally to stabilize the three-dimensional BRCT structure. Alternatively, strongly hydrophobic residues on the BRCT surface might interact with the ligand, BACH-1. <br><br> Primary sequences of mammalian BRCT domains (human, chimpanzee, bovine, dog, rat, mouse) were compared to identify conserved, strongly hydrophobic positions. The human x-ray crystal structure was analyzed to identify those conserved, strongly hydrophobic amino acids that form an internal cluster. Three-dimensional homology models were developed for the mammalian species and three primitive species (chicken, frog, C. elegans). Models were evaluated for a hydrophobic internal cluster. Conserved surface amino acids that interact with BACH-1 were similarly analyzed in all species.<br><br> Internal hydrophobic clusters were found in all models, demonstrating a strongly conserved feature throughout 500 million years of evolution. It can be inferred that the hydrophobic core is critical to stabilize the BRCT domain. A BRCT-BACH1 binding domain contains a conserved hydrophobic pocket in the mammals, chicken and frog, with a partial conservation in C. elegans. Therefore, hydrophobic residues are crucial for both stabilization of the BRCT structure and the binding to BACH1. Missense mutations that destabilize the hydrophobic core and/or the BACH1 binding site may predispose to breast and ovarian cancer.<br><br>

STRUCTURAL HOMOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL COMPLEMENTATION OF E. COLI AND Y. PESTIS SSRA-SMPB
Andrew Chang
Jericho High School, Jericho NY, USA

SsrA RNA is a tRNA-mRNA hybrid that rescues stalled ribosomes and tags truncated proteins for degradation. The molecule is functionally conserved throughout eubacteria, making it an ideal antimicrobial target. An alignment and comparison of significant regions in E. coli and Y. pestis SsrA indicate a potentially significant divergence in the two homologous molecules. However, E. coli and Y.pestis SmpB are predicted to have a high degree of similarity in structural conformation. The implications of these predictions were to be compared to the results of a complementation experiment. Subcloning the Y. pestis SsrA-SmpB gene into an expression vector presented many difficulties and has not yet been accomplished. Yet, one of the incorrect SsrA-SmpB clones did further confirm the general vicinity of the SsrA binding site of SmpB and SmpB binding site of SsrA.

CHARACTERIZATION OF A MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY AGAINST MARBURG VLP'S
Dipika Jairam Gopal
Mira Loma High School, Sacramento, California, United States of America

Marburg Virus, a level A pathogen, is the cause of a deadly hemorrhagic fever for which no vaccine is yet available. The damage and health concerns that arise from Marburg virus indicate a necessity for developing an antibody for the Marburg Virus. In treatment, the monoclonal antibody could be the sole contributor to curing the disease. To accomplish this, can a monoclonal antibody be developed for treatment against the Marburg virus and be specific to that virus only? The objective of this study was to purify and characterize an already existing monoclonal antibody (MAb) against the Marburg Virus-like Particle (VLP). Purification was conducted by Protein G chromatography and the antibody was tested for its concentration, cross reactivity, and titer to qualitatively asses the strength and efficacy of the monoclonal antibody. The tests showed a low concentration of the antibody; however specificity to the Marburg antigens was demonstrated as opposed to antigens of its close relative, Ebola. The specificity of the MAb to Marburg antigens only is important in this study because of its potential uses in diagnosis or clinical treatment. Antibodies that are not specific to an antigen may not entirely treat the virus, let alone recognize the virus inside the infected body.

THE USE OF ALAMARBLUE ASSAY FOR QUANTITATIVE IN VITRO ASSESSMENT OF OXIDATION-REDUCTION POTENTIAL (ORP) OF CAMELLIA SINESIS' EPIGALLOCATECHIN-GALLATE (EGCG) AFFECT ON MESENCHYMAL STEM CELLS OF R6/2 TRANSGENIC MICE IN A CELL CULTURE MODEL OF HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE
Nolan Ezekiel Ford
Saginaw Arts & Sciences Academy, Saginaw, MI

Due to previous study it has been found that a possible way to treat Huntington disease would be to reverse the effects it has on cell degeneration. The way to do this would be by reducing the oxidative stress that may be the cause of the disease’s degeneration. Currently, it has been found that green tea has an affect on the growth of cells taken from the femurs of a R6/2 mouse. This study showed that green tea possesses antioxidant, antitumorgenic, and antibacterial qualities. In the present study, cultured mesenchymal stem cells (derived from the femurs of R6/2 mice) will be used. In the experiment both WT and HD cells where used to compare the growth and oxidation reduction potential of several different EGCG concentrations. Both the WT and HD cells where plated in a 96 cell well plate using 48 cell wells each. The fluorescence is used to measure the oxidation reduction potential and the fluorescence given off by each cell in the cell wells. The fluorescence of each cell well in the presence of alamarBlue was measured using spectrophotometry. The primary focus of this experiment was to further determine whether powerful antioxidants such as Camellia Sinesis’ ECGC could potentially be a treatment for HD by counteracting the degeneration process and reducing the oxidative stress, which causes free radical destruction in this devastating disease. The results from this experiment evidently demonstrates that EGCG is a definite treatment and a possible cure for Huntington’s disease.

NOVEL SULF-OXYMB CRYSTALLIZATION FOR STRUCTURE DETERMINATION
Efrain Rodriguez-Ocasio
CROEM, Mayaguez, PUERTO RICO

To study the sulfhemoglobinemia condition and hemeprotein reactivity with Hydrogen sulfide, Sulf-oxyMyoglobin was synthetized and crystalized for further X-Ray Diffraction. The hypothesis was that Precipitant Agent 1 (Table 2) would produce better crystals at 20mg/mL. The protein was prepared with myoglobin from equine skeletal muscle prepared at 100mg/mL. Sodium hydrosulfite was used to change the myoglobin’s oxidation state to Ferrous [Fe(II)] and Sodium sulfide was used to obtain the Hydrogen sulfide. The Ultraviolet-Visible Spectroscopy was used to monitor the reaction for the formation of the protein studied. After synthetized, a crystallization screening varying precipitant agent and precipitant agent concentration was conducted using the MicroBatch under Oil Technique. Four precipitant agents were tested in this experiment, these were: 30% MDP, 0.1M Sodium acetate pH 4.6, 0.02M Calcium chloride; 0.4M Potassium sodium tartrate; 0.1M Sodium acetate, 0.1M Imidazole pH 6.5 and 0.2M Magnesium formate. Three of these precipitant agents crystallized the protein distributed into six conditions. The Magnesium formate precipitated the protein very fast, consequently it did not crystallize. The optimal crystallization conditions for Sulf-oxyMb were determined. The 30%MDP, 0.1M Acetic acid pH 4.6, 0.02M Calcium chloride at a concentration of 20mg/mL was selected as the ideal condition. The precipitant agent concentration proved to be the determining factor. Further X-Ray Diffraction studies are needed to establish the protein structure. This novel structure should help to have a better understanding on Hydrogen sulfide and its bonding to hemeproteins which will also help develop better treatments for sulfhemoglobinemia without the necessity of blood transfusions.

THE EFFECT OF LOCATION OF A DNA BASE MISMATCH ON THE STABILITY OF A HYBRIDIZED DNA DUPLEX
Charles Preston Blakemore
Academy for Math, Engineering and Science, Salt Lake City, UT

It has been shown that a DNA base mismatch adversely affects duplex stability and therefore its unzipping time. This study compared and analyzed binding kinetics, based on location, for various DNA duplexes, where short matched or mismatched probes were allowed to anneal with a longer DNA strand. It was hypothesized that moving a mismatch (G:A) closer to the ends of the short DNA probe would result in a lowered translocation time (or unzipping) as both the dynamic ends of the duplex and the area of lower stability around the mismatch would decrease the overall stability of the duplex. A protein pore (a-HL) was inserted into a lipid bilayer, which was suspended over a glass nanopore membrane. DNA duplexes were electrically forced through this protein pore, which caused the short strand to unzip from the long strand. Translocation rates were determined by analyzing blocking times for ionic current passing through a-HL pore. Duplexes with a G:A mismatch exhibited lower average translocation times than those without, even when the location of the short strand was changed. Also, when a single mismatch was placed closer to 3’ end of the 12mer complementary strand, the percent decrease in unzipping, as compared to the matched duplex, was greater than the percent decrease when a single mismatch was placed closer to the 5’ end of 12mer complementary strand. Directionality of unzipping could be studied with the same method. Perfection and continued analysis of the nanopore method could ultimately lead to single-base resolution sequencing.

COMPARING CIRCULAR AND LINEAR DNA IN CELLULAR TRANSFECTION EFFICIENCY
Savannah May Bowman
McKinley Senior High School, Canton, OH

This project compares the cellular transfection efficiency between circular and linear DNA using non-viral nanoparticles as delivery vectors. Cellular transfection occurs when the gene of interest enters target cells through the cell membrane, where the nanoparticle degrades, releasing the DNA. The DNA then enters cells’ nuclei. My hypothesis was that linear DNA would be more successful in transfecting cells because linear DNA is smaller than circular pDNA in overall size, allowing it to enter the nucleus more readily. The bacterial enzyme β-galactosidase (gene LacZ) was used to determine successfully transfected cells because it can be easily located with a LacZ stain using the artificial substrate X-gal, which turns blue when it is cleaved with β-galactosidase. Chinese hamster ovary cells were exposed to linear or circular LacZ pDNA not encapsulated in nanoparticles for three days. Additional CHO cells were treated with linear or circular LacZ pDNA encapsulated in nanoparticles for six days. After incubation, the cells were fixed and stained with X-gal. The plate was imaged and analyzed comparing the number of transfected cells versus the total number of cells. Results showed higher transfection efficiency in CHO cells treated with nanoparticles that contained the circular pDNA, however, when the pDNA was applied without being encapsulated within nanoparticles, the linear DNA produced increased numbers of transfected cells. In conclusion, the results suggest that linear DNA can more easily penetrate the cell and nuclear membranes, increasing cellular transfection rate. However, during the process of encapsulating the pDNA within the nanoparticle, linear DNA may be more susceptible to damage than circular pDNA, therefore, decreasing the cellular transfection rate.

William G. Enloe High School, Raleigh, NC

Purpose: This year it is expected the 569,490 people will die from cancer, with more than 1,500 dying each day from cancer. The purpose of this research is to develop a new technique in treating cancer. As of now current chemotherapies allow for cellular resistance which makes the drug regimen less effective. By finding a drug that directly activates procaspase-3, we will eliminate drug resistance and make a more effective therapy for the treatment of several types of cancer.<br><br>Methods: The procedures that were used to conduct this research were protein purification, to extract the required protein, docking, to test how well each of the molecules will work, and crystallography, to study the crystal structure of the protein.<br><br>Results: After these experiments were run and the results were collected, it was found that 3 of the 1,364 molecules tested resulted in higher procaspase-3 activation. The best compound had a Mean Velocity score of 13,722 RFUs, a fold increase of 477.1, and a docking score of -9.2. <br><br>Conclusions: The conclusions that were drawn were that if the enzyme activity increased in the presence of a small molecule then the molecule could be developed into an effective drug. Since the docking scores for the molecules did not correlate to the experimental results docking or computational prediction may not be an effective way to find small molecule drug candidates for procaspase-3.

INHIBITION OF DIMERIZATION: FUNCTIONAL STUDIES OF HIV CO RECEPTOR CCR5
Julian Terrell Otis
Walter Payton College Preparatory High School, Chicago, IL, United States

Purpose: HIV co receptor CCR5 must be able to bind to gp120 for the entry and replication of virus. Falcon et al. (2004) showed that mutant CCR5 with two mutations (I52V & V150A) were unable to form dimers. The examination of the expression and functional responses of CCR5 receptors that were mutated at these specific residues was studied.<br><br><br> Methods: Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells were transfected with DNA which express wild type, CCR5 mutated at either I52V or V150A, and doubly mutated CCR5 (CCR5/I52V/V150A). CCR5 surface expression was quantified using flow cytometry. Western blotting was conducted on MIP-1â stimulated CHO cells to test for CCR5 induced activation of the MAP kinases. <br><br><br> Results: Results obtained by flow Cytometry showed that CCR5 mutants were found to be expressed at the cell surface. ERK1/2 signals were detected in CHO cells expressing wildtype CCR5, however the single mutant CCR5 proteins showed decreased activation of ERK, and double mutant CCR5 did not show upregulation of ERK. <br><br><br> Conclusions: These experiments show that dimerization mutants of CCR5 are expressed in the outer membrane. However, a lack of activation of ERK by the dimerization deficient double mutant suggests that dimerization is necessary for CCR5 to function.<br><br>

ENHANCED PRODUCTION OF ARTEMISININ, AN ANTIMALARIAL/ANTICANCER COMPOUND, FROM ARTEMISIA ANNUA PLANT CULTURES
Yun Song
Herschel V. Jenkins High School, Savannah, Georgia, USA

Artemisinin, produced by the annual herb Artemisia annua, is especially effective against both cancer and malaria, but is unavailable globally and expensive compared to other treatments. Although organic synthesis of artemisinin has been attempted, it has proven to be even more economically burdensome than natural extraction. The purpose of this research is to develop an economically feasible method of artemisinin extraction with limited loss in plant viability to allow for repeated extractions from the same batch of A. annua cultures, thus increasing production. The extraction method utilizes the process of destabilizing and restabilizing cell membranes using permeabilizing agents. Callus cultures from A. annua leaf explants were obtained on Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 2.5 uM 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. Several cell membrane destabilization methods were tested: heating calli to 42 degrees C for 20 or 30 minutes and exposing calli to various concentrations (30.0 mM to 100.0 mM) of ammonium sulfate for 30 or 60 minutes. Since artemisinin is nonpolar, the cells were also immersed in ethanol solutions to allow for complete extraction. Exposing the cells to 60.0 mM ammonium sulfate for 60 minutes and 25% ethanol for 5 minutes produced the best combination of cell viability and artemisinin concentration results. The amount of artemisinin extracted by 60.0 mM ammonium sulfate is comparable to those obtained by destructive methods used in other researches. The extraction method used in this research also yielded high amounts of artemisitene, an artemisinin analog that also has antimalarial and anticancer properties.

THE EFFECTS OF SQUALENE AND PRAVACHOL ON TOTAL CHOLESTEROL LEVELS IN MUS MUSCULUS
Zachary James VanWinkle
East Noble Highschool, Kendallville, IN

The medication of choice for lowering cholesterol is a statin. Statins work by limiting the liver’s ability to produce CoQ10. CoQ10 is the start of biosynthesis of cholesterol. Squalene is produced naturally in the body during the biosynthesis of cholesterol. (When Squalene is introduced into a body a negative feedback cycle results, reducing cholesterol amounts.) <br><br> The experiment was preformed on 20 Swiss Webster mice, 6-8 weeks old. The mice were divided into 4 groups. The group’s diets were as follows: group one- purified basal diet with 60% energy from fat; group two- high lipid diet and 17% Pravachol and water solution; the third group- 30% mixture of the high lipid diet and Squalene; the fourth group- Pravachol solution and Squalene mixture. At the end of the experiment the animals were put under anesthesia and blood was obtained via retro orbital bleeding. The blood was centrifuged and tested for total cholesterol levels in a RXL Chem analyzer. <br><br> The control group had a mean cholesterol level was 222. The second group had a mean of 218 with a P-value of .848. The third group had a mean of 192 with a P-value of .232. The fourth group had a mean of 198 with a P-value of .343. Although the results are not statistically significant, there is a trend that with further testing could reveal statistically sound results. <br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF THE TRANSFORMATION PROCESS ON THE ETHANOL PRODUCTION OF ENTERIC BACTERIA
Kallie Ann Kappes
Elko High School, Elko, NV

This experiment was conducted to determine if the effects of the transformation process will affect the amount of ethyl alcohol produced. The transformation process increased ethanol production with Enterobacter aerogenes, but didn’t affect Serratia liquefaciens positively or negatively. <br><br>The initial reason for the project was to see if there was an easier way to produce ethanol. The easier and cost efficient way to produce ethanol would be beneficial to the planet and consumers. The bacterium Enterobacter aerogenes (E. aerogenes) was used in this experiment and is alcohol fermenting bacterium found in the human gastrointestinal tract. It is an enteric bacterium similar to Escherichia coli (E.coli). E. coli can be transformed and it accepts the gene being transferred into it and displays the new characteristics of the gene. The reason that this project didn’t use E. coli was because E. coli doesn’t alcohol ferment unlike E. aerogenes. Serratia liquefaciens is also similar and ferments alcohol. <br><br>I predicted that the affect of the transformation process would increase the amount of ethanol produced. After performing the transformation, the transformed E. aerogenes tested positive for the presence of ethanol as where the control untransformed didn’t. There wasn’t enough in either sample to distill into a measurable amount, but the positive results for the presence of ethanol suffice. Serraita liquefaciens didn’t test negative as there was a slight positive outcome, but it was completely positive. There was only a miniscule amount of ethanol detected, compared to Enterobacter aerogenes which had a noticeable amount observed.

INVESTIGATION OF DIFFERENT PRETREATMENTS FOR BIOETHANOL FROM GRASS CLIPPINGS
Bovey Yang Rao
Hillcrest High School, Midvale, UT

Fossil fuel prices have increased significantly due to current energy demands. Therefore, it is crucial to identify and pursue alternative forms of energy. Pretreatments in ethanol production serve as a method to increase the overall yield of the fermentation process. This project investigated different pretreatment methods on Kentucky bluegrass clippings and their effect on ethanol yield. Sugar content which predicts the level of ethanol conversion was first analyzed with the dilute acid method. Two main forms of sugar compounds: glucose and fructose were quantified by using HPLC. Furthermore, other pretreatments applied to the grass clippings were hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) with photolysis, sonication, and the combination of H2O2 and sonication. After each type of pretreatment was applied, the grass was dried and fermented with K1-V1116 yeast (S. Cerevisiae) in an YPG nutrient broth for 48 hours, and then the ethanol yield was analyzed by a Headspace GC/MS. Different H2O2 concentrations (0.5 – 2.5 ml in 50 mL water) and photolysis durations (0.5-8 hours) were tested as well as sonication durations (0.25-8 hours). The H2O2 and photolysis pretreatment had the best results with 9.6% ethanol yield when 2.5 ml of H2O2 was applied with 8 hours of photolysis, while sonication for 1 hour yielded the best results for the method at 7.6% ethanol. The combination method of 0.5 ml H2O2 and sonication of 15 minutes has achieved an even higher conversion of 11.2% ethanol yield. The results indicate that H2O2 and sonication are efficient forms of pretreatment on grass clippings for ethanol production.

The purpose of this experiment is to determine if nicotine affects the developmental rate of chick embryos. First the eggs will be randomly assigned to three different groups. Then the eggs will be incubated at 37 ͦC for five days. On the fifth day, Howard’s Ringer Solution will be put into one of the groups; .1 ml of nicotine and ringers solution with 25µl of nicotine in it will be put into a different group; and .1ml of nicotine and ringers solution with 50µl of nicotine in it will be put into another group. The ringers and nicotine solutions will be put into the eggs by first candling the egg to find the embryo. Then cleaning the area where the ringers or nicotine solution will be put into the egg. Then a small hole will be poked in the egg with a sterile probe. After that, the ringers or nicotine will be put in the egg, and then the hole will be taped over. The eggs will then be incubated again at 37 ͦC for eight days. After eight days, the eggs will be staged, and the data, recorded. The conclusion of this experiment is that the nicotine did affect the developmental rate of the chick embryos.

PHYLLOSTACHYS AUREA LEAVES EXTRACT AS NATURAL FUNGICIDE
Elsa Raquel Dandridge-Mulero
Jose Campeche, San Lorenzo, PUERTO RICO

Studies have demonstrated that many fungi are dangerous to human health and could cause death. Until now, the only way to eliminate fungus was using hazardous chemicals that affect health and contaminate the environment. The hypothesis for this research was that it is possible to create a natural fungicide with Phyllostachys aurea leaves extract that eliminate and/or inhibit the growth of different lichens found on a cement wall and a roof, of nail fungus and the mold that grows on a wet shirt. To test the effectiveness of this natural, chemical free fungicide, four tests were made. The lichens were put in test tubes with Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) and were incubated, to later eliminate them with the extract. The extract eliminated 100% of the reproduced lichens. A mixture of TSB and nails fungus was inoculated into a Potato Dextrose Agar Plate and 3 mL of the extract were added. The extract inhibited 100% growth of the nail fungus in the plate. To demonstrate that it eliminates the mold caused by humidity on clothes, the extract was applied to molds on a shirt. It eliminated 62% of the mold in the shirt in 5 minutes. The efficiency of the plant leaves extract vs. three chemical agents used as cleansers was compared on a lichen affected roof. The extract satisfactory eliminated the lichen as the other three cleaners did. These results led to conclude that Phyllostachys aurea leaves extract works as a natural fungicide and is as effective as chemical cleaners.

REGULATION OF NITRIC OXIDE EXPRESSION AS A FORM OF NEUROTRANSMITTER PLASTICITY
Vaishnavi Lakshminarasimha Rao
Canyon Crest Academy, San Diego, CA

Neurotransmitter respecification is a recently discovered form of neuronal plasticity with enormous applications to neurodegenerative disorders including stroke, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. While respecification behavior of classical neurotransmitters is well understood, plasticity of nitric oxide (NO), a gaseous neurotransmitter that regulates various physiological functions, is yet to be established. Therefore my objective was to determine whether NO expression could be respecified when electrical activity was altered through over-expression of potassium (K+) and sodium (Na+) ion channels. I hypothesized that over-expression of K+ channels would decrease NO expression while over-expression of Na+ channels would display opposite effects. Larvae of the vertebrate Xenopus Laevis were used for experimentation and nitric oxide synthase (NOS), the enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of NO, was used as marker of NO expression. Expression of serotonin via tryptophan hydroxylase was used as reference for validation of NO results. Fixed larvae tissues expressing Kir and Nav were obtained. I dissected the brains of the samples, immunostained them with fluorescently tagged anti-NOS antibody and imaged using confocal microscope. In brains obtained from K+ channel over-expressing larvae, I observed that NOS expression was downregulated compared to control. Brains with enhanced Na+ channels exhibited upregulation of NOS. Interestingly, under decreased electrical activity, TPH and NOS were coexpressed, suggesting phenotype respecification in the embryonic brain. This study is the first to suggest that electrical activity can modulate and thus induce plasticity of nitric oxide. Applications include novel therapies targeting NO abnormality in neurodegenerative disorders.

Directed evolution was carried out on an alkB gene from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A P.putida plasmid was transformed into a Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain of bacteria after screening of 29 known hydrocarbon utilizers for activity on alkanes isolated it as the most effective. After making a library of mutant alkB gene's by error prone PCR, the products were purified using QIAquick DNA Purification Kit and then cloned into E.Coli with a TOPO Cloning Kit from Invitrogen. The TOPO and pUC 28T vectors were digested with EcoRI and HindIII and the ~1400bp fragment from TOPO was gel-purified and ligated into the pUC vector and transformed into P.putida.<br><br><br>A high throughput, reproducible plate-based assay using zones of clearing was developed to screen for hydrocarbon degrading activity. Of the 29 strains selected, 12 had significant (>0.5cm/24h at 37C) activity on C20. Primers for the PCR were designed using NCBI nucleotide data for Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and BLAST of Alkane Monooxygenase, the first enzyme in the hydroxylation pathway. The upstream primer used was 5'GGCACCCGAAGCTTCCGTTTCC3' and the downstream primer was 5'GTCTGAGAATTCTCCTCCC3'.

ISOLATION AND EXPRESSION OF AN EPINEPHRINE-SYNTHESIZING ENZYME (PNMT) FROM ENTAMOEBA PARASITES
David Alexander Gottesman, 38 Arbor Road, Roslyn Heights, NY 11577 
Roslyn High School, Roslyn Heights, NY, USA

Entamoeba histolytica is a protozoan parasite known to cause infectious colitis and amoebic dysentery in humans. Its life cycle consists of two parts: the infectious cyst stage and the multiplying trophozoite stage. <br><br>Epinephrine is released by the trophozoites during the process of cyst formation. An understanding of the molecular intricacies of epinephrine-induced encystation may allow for pharmacological manipulation of epinephrine metabolism to control cyst formation in vitro. Drugs that either prevent cyst formation or induce it before a large amoebic population is present would result in the release of fewer cyst forms of the parasite, reducing parasite transmission from person to person. <br><br>Although trophozoites release epinephrine, it is not known if E. histolytica synthesizes epinephrine or extracts it from the growth medium. Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) is the enzyme that catalyzes production of epinephrine from norepinephrine. This study aims to determine the source of epinephrine by determining if E. histolytica contains a PNMT-type enzyme. <br><br>PNMT amino acid sequences from several higher organisms were compared to identify conserved regions of the enzyme. These conserved amino acid sequences were then used to search for similar sequences in a database containing the recently sequenced amoeba genome. A PNMT-like gene was found in the E. histolytica database and cloned in bacteria. Yeast cells containing the cloned E. histolytica PNMT gene expressed PNMT enzyme activity. This suggests that E. histolytica produces its own epinephrine, and is the most evolutionarily ancient eukaryote shown to do so. <br><br>

CORRECTION OF F508DEL-CFTR BY THE SMALL MOLECULE C18 AND ITS SYNERGY WITH OTHER CORRECTOR COMPOUNDS
Mu Xuan Zhang
Bayview Secondary School, Richmond Hill, Ontario, CANADA

Cystic fibrosis, the most common fatal genetic disease among Caucasians, is caused by the deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (F508del) within the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. The folding and trafficking defects conferred by F508del on CFTR can be partially overcome by certain small molecules, known as correctors. In this study, through assays of biosynthetic processing and function, the unpublished small molecule C18 was shown to be the most potent corrector of F508del-CFTR observed to date in an academic laboratory. C18 was found to promote a more compact, degradation-resistant fold in CFTR, assessed as a reduction in accessibility of cysteine residues to modification. In silico studies also provided an atomic-scale model of C18's mechanism of action, in which it acts as a molecular scaffold by binding at a crucial interdomain interface. Finally, for the first time in cystic fibrosis academic literature, computational studies were used to suggest synergy between two small molecules, C18 and Compound C, an effect which was then observed biochemically. The relative levels of rescue between the compounds alone and the combination treatment, taken with the in silico studies, implied a correction mechanism by which the initial binding of C18 allowed for the further rescue of F508del-CFTR by Compound C. These findings provide a basis for the potency of C18, supporting future rational structure-based drug design. In addition, they identify potential target binding sites for CFTR modulators and suggest combinations of molecular therapies as an avenue of treatment for cystic fibrosis disease.

OZONATION AS A NOVEL CANCER THERAPEUTIC AGENT: RESULTS OF A PILOT STUDY ON AML-14.3D10 (ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA) CELL VIABILITY, IN VITRO
Elena Kurtz Ovaitt
West Platte High School, Weston, Missouri, United States

Scientists commonly acknowledge that human health thrives on the abundance of oxygen and dies on a deficiency of it. The use of ozone, an allotropic form of oxygen, is a non-conventional form of medicine that has been used successfully in various medical treatments, including cancer treatments. Despite this, little is known about the immediate effects of ozone on cancer cell viability.<br><br> In previous studies performed, ozone was shown to inhibit Caco2 (colon cancer) cell proliferation. This current pilot study was designed to assess the immediate effects of ozonation on cell viability. The research evaluated the effects of ozonation on AML-14.3D10 (acute myeloid leukemia) cell viability, in vitro. In the study, varying amounts of ozone were applied to AML-14.3D10 cells; ambient air was replaced with a continuous flow of medical grade ozone supplied to the cell suspension to better expose the cells. A viable cell count was immediately evaluated using trypan blue exclusion. The data of the experiment indicates that ozone is cytotoxic to AML-14.3D10 (acute myeloid leukemia) cells. At all time increments, ozone showed cytotoxicity on AML-14.3D10 cells, of which the cell number was lower than the initial cell number.<br><br> The statistics applied to the data indicate ozone does have an immediate effect on cellular viability when applied to AML-14.3D10 cells. This suggestion, previously unexplored, may lead to insight on how ozone induces cell death. Overall, this preliminary study shows promise and should lead to further research of ozonation in complementary and alternative cancer treatment practices. <br><br>

CREATION OF MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES FOR UT-A AND UT-B
Katie I Reese
Fernley High School, Fernley NV, United States

This research projects creates a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) for the purpose of detecting urea transporters in ruminant animals, mainly cattle. MoAb’s are created by fusing tumorous Sp2 cells with antibody producing B-cells. This fusion is done by a hybridoma procedure and results are tested using a spectrophotometer. The reason for detecting the presence of MoAb’s is to find out whether or not animals manage their own nitrogen levels. My research is the first successful creation of MoAb’s specified for UT-A/-B that I could find record of. This research is the first step in further study of urea transporters. Understanding urea transporters will allow us to asses the use of nitrogen supplements with potential financial savings by reducing the need for those supplements.<br><br>

Lincoln Park High School, Chicago, IL

Dysregulation of mitochondrial calcium has been implicated in many diseases. Our ability to monitor mitochondrial calcium in living cells is essential to our understanding of the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in diabetes. The purpose of this experiment is to use a virus to transfect living cells with a novel mitochondrially-targeted biosensor and establish the root of spatial and temporal coupling of cellular calcium signals in pancreatic beta cells. <br><br> In this research cells were transfected with the biosensor 4mtD3cpv by means of a plasmid, in a separate trial cells were transfected by a virus. 4mtD3cpv was colocalized to the mitochondria using DsRedmt. Mitochondrial and cytosolic calcium signals were measured simultaneously in living cells using 4mtD3cpv and Fura-2, respectively. CGP-37157, glucose, tetraethylammonium and KCl were used to further assess coupling of cellular calcium signals. <br><br> By using an adenovirus, transfection efficiency was improved. This is the first report to use CGP-37157 to implicate the mitochondrial sodium calcium exchanger as a major component in the formation of mitochondrial and cytosolic calcium oscillations in beta cells. As calcium is implicit in a vast array of cellular signaling pathways, including those that lead to the secretion of insulin, this research may serve to establish and explain the relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and diabetes thereby providing a new avenue for treatment.

A STATISTICAL COMPARISON OF THE ENZYME ACTIVITY OF BRAND NAME VERSUS GENERIC PANCREATIC ENZYME SUPPLEMENTS
Tiffany Marie Osburn
MOISD Math/Science/Technology Center, Big Rapids, MI, United States of America

The purpose of this research is to determine the differences, if any, of the protease, amylase, and lipase activities of brand name versus generic pancreatic enzyme supplements. The hypothesis is that if protease, amylase, and lipase activity is related to brand name pancreatic enzyme supplements, then brand name pancreatic enzyme supplements will produce higher enzyme activity than generic enzyme supplements. <br><br> Enzyme assays were used to determine the protease, amylase, and lipase activity of each enzyme supplement in two different conditions: the normal conditions of the assay and in simulated gastric fluid conditions. The results of each brand name supplement were then compared to its generic equivalent to see which supplement had higher enzyme activity.<br><br> Generally, the hypothesis was supported by the protease and amylase assays because in the results, the brand name enzyme supplement had higher enzyme activity than their generic equivalents, although not all of the differences were significant. The hypothesis was generally not supported in the lipase assay, as in all of the results but one, the normal condition assay, the generic supplement had higher lipase activity than its brand name supplement.<br><br>

The purpose of this experiment was to find out what the effects of Methyl Guanidine-Acetic Acid are on invertebrate organisms. The researcher conducted his experiment by using Eudrillus Eugenia and Drosophila Melanogaster. The amount of Methyl Guanidine-Acetic Acid for the Eudrillus Eugenia differed from zero, two and four tablespoons of the Methyl Guanidine-Acetic Acid. The results showed that the growth of the Eudrillus Eugenia increased more when using the Methyl Guanidine-Acetic Acid.<br><br>The factor that could have affected my experiment was that there could have been dirt or urine on the Eudrillus Eugenia.<br><br> The researcher calculated the amount of mass of the Eudrillus Eugenia. The Eudrillus Eugenia that used half gained about 3.1 milligrams per Eudrillus Eugenia. The Eudrillus Eugenia that used the full strength of Methyl Guanidine-Acetic Acid grew 3.2 milligrams per Eudrillus Eugenia. The Eudrillus Eugenia not using Methyl Guanidine-Acetic Acid grew half of a milligram per Eudrillus Eugenia.<br><br> The Drosophila Melanogaster that did not use the Methyl Guanidine-Acetic Acid grew about 1 millimeter per Drosophila Melanogaster. The Drosophila Melanogaster died when they were given the dosages of Methyl Guanidine-Acetic Acid. <br><br> The researcher plans on conducting this experiment on the Drosophila Melanogaster using a quarter and an eighth of a tablespoon of Methyl Guanidine-Acetic Acid on the Drosophila Melanogaster to determine if it is the amount being used or the substance being used that is killing the Drosophila Melanogaster.<br><br> The researcher recommends conducting this experiment on humans to determine the long term effects of Methyl Guanidine-Acetic Acid.<br><br>

DEVELOPMENT OF LIPOPHILIC INHIBITORS OF 1-DEOXY-D-XYLULOSE-5-PHOSPHATE REDUCTO-ISOMERASE (DXR) FROM MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS (MTB)
Camille Merit Titzell
School Without Walls Senior High School, Washington, DC

Tuberculosis is a disease that affects every country in the world. Current treatment options leave much to be desired due to decreased efficacy, reliability, and affordability. Drug resistance tuberculosis complicates existing treatment options. One avenue of research is looking at inhibiting the enzyme 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (Dxr) which is involved in the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway. The known inhibitors of Dxr, fosmidomycin and FR90098, are too polar to penetrate the cell wall and, thus, are rendered ineffective as treatment. In this project, lipophilic analogs were synthesized, purified, analyzed, biologically tested for their capabilities against TB, and assessed for their stability. Six compounds were synthesized through a variety of reactions in efforts to, one, de-protect, and, two, create a carboxylic acid/carboxylate. Purifications were preformed through manual column chromatography, Isolera Flash purification system, and recrystallization. Using NMR and LCMS, the compounds were analyzed for confirmation of molecular structure and purity. Compounds were shipped to other facilities to be tested against tuberculosis. A stability test was conducted to discover how well representative compounds withstood aqueous conditions over two weeks as measured by LCMS. Whole cell biological tests showed the compounds to be active against Mtb. The MIC99 data showed improved values compared to the more polar, phosphonate analogs. The stability test showed the lipophilic compound was quicker to degrade. Because this compound represents a prodrug which should be cleaved, the degradation could be beneficial. Enzyme testing will be required to see if the compound is active against Tb for targeting Dxr.

ANALYSIS OF THE PANCREATIC CANCER-SPECIFIC 3C4-AG USING A NOVEL DIRECTLY LABELED MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY 3C4 (FITC-MAB3C4)
Ghulam Dastgir
Midwood High School, Brooklyn, NY, U.S.A.

Pancreatic cancer (PaCa) is the fourth leading cause of all cancer-related deaths in the United States. Monoclonal antibody 3C4 (mAb3C4)is specific for the 3C4 Antigen (3C4-Ag) present exclusively on PaCa cells. This study was performed to assess the possibility of using mAb3C4 in diagnosis and therapeutic treatment of PaCa patients. MAb3C4 was purified and labeled with a fluorescent probe (FITC) for qualitative and quantitative studies with the 3C4-Ag. The specificity of mAb3C4 binding to the 3C4-Ag was demonstrated by epifluorescence microscopy and competition studies utilizing fluorescence activated cell sorter analysis. The number of 3C4-Ag sites was determined on selected rodent and human PaCa cells. Interestingly, the largest number of sites was present on human PaCa cells. The sensitivity of the 3C4-Ag to proteolysis and its recovery was assessed in PaCa cells in a controlled time-course study using a protein synthesis inhibitor and FITC-mAb3C4. It was observed that even a minute concentration of the inhibitor resulted in potent inhibition of the re-expression of the 3C4-ag. These results strengthen the possibility of mAb3C4 serving as a useful diagnostic and therapeutic tool for PaCa patients in the future.

INHIBITION OF THE ATPASE ACTIVITY OF THE HEPATITIS C VIRUS NS3 PROTEIN BY HUMAN LACTOFERRIN
Sabrina Bouchard
Seminaire de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, Quebec, CANADA

The Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects over 170 million individuals worldwide. Moreover, the most common bitherapy prescribed involves many side effects, curing only 50% of patients. The objective of these experiments was to evaluate the human lactoferrin (HLf) anti-HCV activity. HLf is a glycoprotein with a mechanism of action which still remains unresolved. Through experimentation, Non-Structural 3 (NS3), a protein responsible for the RNA helicase activity in HCV, was targeted. Over 50% inhibition of the NS3 ATPase in vitro activity was observed at 1 µM, with complete inhibition at 50 µM HLf. It was hypothesized that the mechanism of the HLf was to inhibit the ATPase activity of NS3 by interacting directly with the helicase and consequently altering its tertiary structure. A large number of kinetic and molecular assays were performed to support the initial hypothesis, excluding various factors that could have provoked an indirect inhibition by HLf: sequestration of ATP, chelation of Mg²+ and pH alteration. The NS3 ATPase activity was evaluated through a Michaelis-Menten model and further mathematically transformed into a Lineweaver-Burk template to confirm the non-competitive HLf mechanism of inhibition. This demonstrated that HLf binds to an allosteric site on NS3. Furthermore, the effects of HLf were assessed using cell-based assays, where HCV replicon replication underwent a decrease of 50% at 3 µM HLf over 48 hours. These innovative results demonstrate the mechanism by which HLf inhibits the replication of HCV, and shows promise for the development of a potent anti-HCV therapy.

RADIATION SHIELD: USING BIOLOGICAL MOLECULES TO PREVENT OR REPAIR DNA DAMAGE CAUSED BY RADIATION IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Parijata Desiree Mackey

The purpose of this project was to determine the effect of biological molecules kinetin (N6-Furfuryladenine) and lectin (from Phytolacca americana) on development and DNA protection and repair in Drosophila melanogaster exposed to Ultraviolet-C and High Energy Photon Beam radiation (999 rads, in X-ray form). It was hypothesized that DNA damage would be reduced in Drosophila treated with kinetin and lectin when compared to a control. To test the hypothesis, the development of a wild-type strain of Drosophila in kinetin, lectin, or untreated media was monitored from egg to adult The wild-type strain of Drosophila melanogaster was also split into 12 groups and treated with: nothing (control), photon beams (x-ray), ultraviolet-C, 25ppm-Kinetin, 100ppm-Kinetin, 25ppm-Lectin, x-ray with 25ppm-Kinetin, UV/25ppm-Kinetin, x-ray/100ppm-Kinetin, UV/100ppm-Kinetin, x-ray/25ppm-Lectin, and UV/25ppm-Lectin. The Drosophila developed and after 14 days the adults were counted, and the male-to-female ratio, mutation rates and types were recorded. Triplicates were performed.<br><br> The results repeatedly supported the hypothesis: the addition of 25ppm-Kinetin to x-ray treated flies, and 25ppm-Kinetin and 25ppm-Lectin to UV treated flies, decreased each radiation trial’s mutation rate by about 11% (from 12% (photon beams) or 13% (UV-C) to approximately 1.5%), and brought the abnormal 1:2 male-to-female ratios to the healthy 1:1. The viability was also normal in comparison to the control, indicating natural survival rates. The data suggests that 25ppm kinetin and 25ppm lectin are capable of protecting or repairing the DNA of irradiated Drosophila melanogaster when administered to their media. In conclusion, 25ppm kinetin and lectin served as effective treatments against radiation damage as observed through male-to-female ratios, mutation rates, and viability when compared to a control.<br><br>

HEAT STRESS REVEALS HEXOSE TRANSPORT RATES IN SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE
Stanley Palasek
Sonoran Science Academy, Tucson, AZ

The overall rate of hexose metabolism may be highly dependent on the rate at which a hexose is transported across the plasma membrane. A correlation between these processes would suggest, in an evolutionary context, the structural aspects of a carbohydrate that maximize the rate of metabolism. This knowledge would make it possible to compile these optimal properties into a synthetic molecule. This molecule could be genetically engineered into livestock and crops for both general nutrition and treatment of metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity. In this study, heat stress was utilized to disrupt plasma membrane integrity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cultures. The amount of metabolism that took place was represented by the amount of carbon dioxide in the system, measured by means of infrared absorption. Algebraic characterization and manipulation of the amount of metabolism in stressed and non-stressed cells and high and low activity hexoses yielded the metabolic activity due to increased transport rate for hexoses of various metabolic activities. The result, strongly suggesting a strong correlation between the activity of these two cellular processes, was confirmed using graphical and statistical analysis.

UNDERSTANDING THE PATHOGENESIS OF ACID-RESISTANT E. COLI: COMPUTATIONAL MODELING OF PH-DEPENDENT CONFORMATIONAL CHANGES IN GADB
Hannah Schaefer Kenagy
Half Hollow Hills High School East, Dix Hills, NY

The source of toxic acid-resistant E. coli in our food system has been attributed to the concentrated animal feeding operations of today's industrial agriculture system where cattle are fed a diet of grain. The Gad system is the most potent of the known mechanisms of acid-resistance in E. coli. GadB, a protein that initiates the function of the Gad system, undergoes a conformational change into its active state when the intracellular pH decreases. Although the crystal structure of GadB has been solved at two pH values, little is known about the mechanism of its conformational change. This project aimed to determine the influence of altered residue protonation states on the GadB structure. Using the crystal structures determined at low and neutral pH values as starting structures, four molecular dynamics simulations were run, each with a different combination of starting structure and residue protonation states. Potential energy analysis indicated positional stability during the trajectory. Numerous root mean square deviation calculations were run to compare the various structures. Although the altered protonation states did cause some conformational changes, the GadB protein did not exhibit a complete conformational change from the neutral-pH structure to the low-pH structure, or vice-versa. It is likely that some of the simulations reached an intermediate state, and that another factor, in addition to the altered protonation states, plays a role in the conformational change. This knowledge, along with further knowledge of the pH-driven conformational change in GadB, could allow for the development of a small molecule that stabilizes the neutral-pH conformation. This would block the effectiveness of the Gad system and thereby combat E. coli acid-resistance.

CHARACTERIZATION OF MICE FIBROBLAST CELL ADHESION TO OSTEOPONTIN
Olive W. Tang
Boston Latin School, Boston, MA

Osteopontin(OPN) has been implicated in several biological processes including wound healing and tissue remodeling. Many cellular interactions with osteopontin are via integrins. Previous studies suggest two major structural domains in OPN are critical for integrin-binding, namely the RGD and SVVYGLR domains. The latter is exposed with thrombin cleavage. Both cleaved and uncleaved forms exist in vivo.<br><br>The purpose of this study is to characterize the adhesion of integrins to OPN by examining phosphorylation and binding sites. Calcein-labeled murine fibroblasts were used in adhesion assays.<br><br>The first objective was to determine if highly-phosphorylated OPN has a different binding capability for fibroblasts (via integrins), as compared to less phosphorylated forms. Varying degrees of OPN phosphorylation exist in vivo and possibly reflect a mode of regulation. It was hypothesized that phosphorylation could be a down-regulator of OPN. Results indicate significantly less fibroblast adhesion to highly-phosphorylated milk OPN as compared to less phosphorylated forms, which suggest that phosphorylation is a negative-feedback regulator of OPN- integrin interaction.<br><br>The second objective was to examine whether the RGD or SVVYGLR domain is the preferred binding site. To study this, peptides were added to compete for fibroblast integrins. It was hypothesized that both sites would be equally used. The RGD peptide, but not the SVVYGLR peptide, significantly decreased fibroblast adhesion to both cleaved and uncleaved OPN.<br><br>In summary, significant OPN phosphorylation decreases integrin-binding, and the RGD domain is the preferred site for integrin-binding. These results, which carry therapeutic implications, are important in better understanding biological functions of OPN.

THE ROLE OF RETINOID RECEPTORS IN SUPPRESSING MITOGEN ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE (MAPK) SIGNALING IN SKIN CANCER
Insun Chong
Caddo Parish Magnet High School, Shreveport, LA

Non-melanoma skin cancer is the most prevalent form of cancer in the U.S. with more than 1,200,000 cases of the two major forms, basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), expected annually. Retinoids have been used with limited success for treating SCC due to hypervitaminosis A. A better understanding of the action of retinoids is necessary to more effectively use them for cancer treatment and prevention. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) suppresses tumor formation in a mouse skin chemical carcinogenesis model. ATRA suppresses the Raf/Mek/Erk cellular signaling pathway in this model by blocking phosphorylation (activation) of these proteins by the tumor promoter TPA. In this project, cultured F9 embryonal carcinoma cells were used that are knocked out for the expression of retinoid receptor proteins (F9KO) to determine whether the receptors are necessary for ATRA suppression of TPA-induced phosphorylation. Immunohistochemistry of mouse skin sections with antibodies for Raf, Mek, and Erk revealed that the activities of these kinases increased with TPA and decreased when cotreated with ATRA. Western blotting using antibodies specific to phosphorylated B-Raf (pB-Raf), B-Raf, pMek1/2, Mek1/2, pErk1/2, and Erk1/2 revealed that B-Raf and Erk1/2 regulation is receptor dependent but Mek1/2 regulation is receptor independent. This knowledge can be used to more effectively and efficiently use retinoids or to design ligand-based drugs that do not induce harmful side effects for use in cancer treatment and prevention.

CHARACTERIZING THE PRION PROPERTIES OF A TRANSLATIONAL REGULATOR EXPRESSED IN BRAIN
Yin Li
Stuyvesant High School, New York, New York, United States of America

Neurons in the central nervous system exchange information with each other via synapses. Local synthesis of proteins at specific synapses is crucial for sustained enhancement of synaptic efficacy, the molecular correlate of learning and memory. This local protein synthesis is mediated by cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding proteins (CPEBs), translational regulators, which are activated by kinases. Phosphorylation provides only a short lasting activation, yet ongoing protein synthesis is needed to maintain synaptic enhancement. A distinct mechanism must be involved in this maintenance of local protein synthesis. A possible clue to such mechanism came from studies of a well-known class of yeast proteins that can undergo heritable and contagious conformational changes that are self-sustaining—the yeast prions. Here it is shown, by using several assays developed to characterize the classical yeast prions, that the mouse CPEB-3 has prion-like properties in yeast and in mammalian cells, including an amino-terminus enriched in glutamine and asparagine, the tendency to form aggregates, the ability to exist in multiple functional states, and the capacity for its N-terminal region to impart prion-like characteristics onto a protein fused to the N-terminal region, but which is otherwise normal. The first evidence that mCPEB-3 is capable of regulating translation as a conventional CPEB is also provided. Altogether, these data indicate the exciting possibility of a novel prion-based mechanism for maintaining ongoing CPEB activity and establishing long-term memory storage.

THE SEARCH FOR VITAMIN B12: IDENTIFYING EFFECTIVE BACTERIAL INOCULATORS FOR FERMENTED VEGETABLES
Larissa Ngan-Trang Nguyen Pham
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland, OR

Vitamin B12 is an essential nutrient, containing cobalt, that is only produced by microorganisms (bacteria). Humans do not synthesize this vitamin and must obtain it from outside sources; as vitamin B12 is only available in meat products, vegans, vegetarians and people in developing countries run the risk of vitamin B12 deficiency. Previous research by has shown that fermenting vegetables with bacterial inoculants leads to an increase or creation of vitamin B12; more so if protein is added to the mix. Containers of cabbage were inoculated with either Lactobacillus plantarum, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, or a combination of the two, and along with controls of non-inoculated cabbage, fermented for four weeks. Protein was also added to select containers of cabbage for additional comparison. Cobalt was measured using ICP-MS and vitamin B12 was measured in selected samples using a competitive immunoassay. Raw cabbage contained ten times the amount of Co present in the fermented samples, yet B12 was only found in samples previously inoculated with Lactobacillus; this indicates that Lactobacillus plantarum is able to synthesize vitamin B12. However, further research is necessary to verify this conclusion.

ANALYSIS ON THE SPECIFICITY OF RNA INTERFERENCE
Vaibhav Amin
William L. Dickinson High School, Jersey City, NJ, USA

This research attempts to determine the effect of RNA Interference (RNAi: suppression of specific genes) on a particular connexin and its effect on other connexins. The cell line that was used for this experiment was the mouse Sertoli cells. Connexin 43 (target gene) is the most abundant protein found in the connexon channels connecting the Sertoli cells and germ cells. The other connexins that were examined are connexin 33 and connexin 40. To silence protein synthesis dsRNA must be transfected in a cell colony. Ambion kit was used to produce a dsRNA that was specific to a particular gene. Consequently, the dsRNA was transfected into four plates (connexin 43 variable, GAPDH + control, no transfection – control, no RNA transfection –control). After the RNA was extracted from the transfected cells, RT-PCR was performed on it. The resulting sample was amplified on an Agarose gel. The results showed a decrease in the production of the connexin 43 in the experimental group when compared to the negative control group. While the production of connexin 43 was silenced, the production of the other connexins was unaffected. This shows that RNA Interference is specific and will not induce any unwanted response on the host cell. This posttranscriptional gene silencing method can be used to map the human genome at a time efficient rate. It can also be used in studies of diseases that are caused by "renegade" genes such as cancer, malaria and various other liver diseases.

Eggshells are green natural resources of calcium for human being. Acidic fruit juices have the ability to combine with calcium. Fruit juices also contain some components that can promote the absorption of calcium.<br><br>We calcinate eggshells into powder of which the calcium content is about 97%. Then we react the eggshell powder with acidic fruit juices and acquire "fruit juice calciums" such as "lemon juice calcium", "orange juice calcium" and "Lugan orange juice calcium". These products have high water solubility, high calcium content and no alkaline irritability. In the meantime, essential elements in eggshells such as magnesium and iron and beneficial ingredients in fruit juices such as organic acids, vitamin C, fructose and amino acids are mostly preserved in these products.<br><br>In this way, the wasted eggshells are changed into valuables, and a new value added method is found for fruits processing, as we know, eggshells and fruits are very abundant in China. The materials and techniques we adopt are natural and green, so the final products shall not be chemically polluted, and environmental pollutions are also prevented. These products also have the advantage of low cost.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF THE APIS MELLIFERA’S HONEY ON THE LEAVES OF THE WEED BRACHIARIA PURPURASCENS
Caroline Lopez
Brigida Alvarez Rodriguez, Vega Baja, PUERTO RICO

This investigation was created to find a natural way to control weed. The hypothesis was that Apis mellifera’s honey is an effective solution to weed control. There were three plants of the weed Brachiaria purpurascens. Plant #1 was sprayed with water. Plant #2 was sprayed with a solution of 30 mL of Apis mellifera’s honey and 30 mL of water. Plant #3 was sprayed with a solution of 15 mL of concentrated herbicide and 450 mL of water. Plants were put in an open area. Changes on plants were observed and recorded for seven days. Weed plant # 1 sprayed with water, continued growing during the seven days of investigation. Weed plant #2, treated with the solution of bee’s honey and water, began to die on the third day of treatment and died completely by the seventh day. Weed plant # 3, sprayed with a solution of concentrated herbicide and water, began to die on the third day of treatment but at the seventh day of the application it still had three dry leaves left. Weed plant #2 sprayed with the solution of bee’s honey and water was completely dead by the seventh day. After the data analysis, it was evidenced that the Apis mellifera’s honey acts as a natural herbicide. It was also evidenced that Apis mellifera’s honey is more effective than the concentrated herbicide. In conclusion, the Apis mellifera’s honey is an effective herbicide on the weed Brachiaria purpurascens. The hypothesis was accepted.

BISPHENOL A AND C. ELEGANS: ACCUMULATION AND LARVAL RECOVERY
Kathryn Marie Merkling
East Noble High School, Kendallville, IN

The objective is to see what concentration of Bisphenol A (BPA) is absorbed by C. elegans, and if larval counts will return to normal when BPA is removed from the environment. It was hypothesized that if C. elegans are exposed to BPA then it will be present in them, and if BPA exposure is eliminated then the C. elegans larval counts will return to normal. Nematode Growth Agar and BPA dosages of 1000 ppm, 500 ppm, 100 ppm, 50 ppm, 100 ppb, 50 ppb, and 0 ppb were created. 1 mm by 1 mm agar squares from stock culture were transferred to 1st Generation plates and cultured for 5 days to allow C.elegans to mature. On day five, they were transferred from 1st Generation to 2nd Generation. On day six, the 1st Generation plates were rinsed with distilled water and the rinse was stored to analyze with the GC/MS. For 4th through 6th Generation BPA free dishes where utilized and the plate washes were used to evaluate the number of C. elegans at each larval stage. The data showed BPA accumulates in concentrations levels ranging from 0.4 - 22.4 ppm per plate. It also showed when all dosages of BPA are removed from the C. elegans’ environment then they will return to normal larval cycle counts through the course of a couple generations. So, it can be concluded that BPA could potentially get into human systems, but if exposure of BPA ceases the effects will be eliminated.

FOUR CARDIAC HORMONES ARE NOVEL POTENT INHIBITORS OF THE CANONICAL WNT/BETA-CATENIN SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION PATHWAY IN HUMAN PANCREATIC, COLORECTAL, AND RENAL CANCERS
Michelle Nadine Skelton
C. Leon King Senior High School, Tampa, FL

The purpose of the experiment is to determine if and at what concentrations four endogenous cardiac peptide hormones, namely Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP), vessel dilator, kaliuretic peptide, and Long-Acting Natriuretic Peptide (LANP), can inhibit the canonical Wnt/Beta-catenin signal transduction pathway, which is activated in cancer cells. This will be determined by testing human pancreatic carcinoma cells, human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells, and human renal adenocarcinoma cells. My hypothesis is that the four cardiac hormones will inhibit both Wnt as well as Beta-catenin levels in the cancer cells when treated with the cardiac hormones as compared to when they are untreated.<br><br> <br><br>After subculturing the cancer cells for 24 hours, approximately 5,000 cells of each line in 50 L of their respective media were seeded in 96-well plates with 50 micro Liters of media containing 10 micro Molar, 1 micro Molar, 100 nM, 10 nM, 1 nM, and 100 pM concentrations of each of the four cardiac hormones. The results were measured using an ELISA (Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) read at a 540 nM wavelength using a microplate reader. <br><br> <br><br>The data showed that vessel dilator, kaliuretic peptide, ANP, and LANP were shown to inhibit the levels of beta-catenin by 46-83% in human colorectal cancer cells, 44-88% in human pancreatic carcinoma cells, and 32-73% in human renal cancer cells. In addition, vessel dilator, kaliuretic peptide, ANP, and LANP were shown to inhibit the levels of Wnt-3a by 49-53% in human colorectal cancer cells, 62-68% in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells, and 38-44% in human renal cancer cells. <br><br> <br><br>In conclusion, the four cardiac hormones have been demonstrated to significantly inhibit multiple steps of the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signal transduction pathway, suggesting that they have anticancer mechanisms of action.

DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL DNA COMPUTER SYSTEM FOR ADVANCED GENETIC ANALYSIS
Adrian Veres
College Jean-de-Brebeuf, Montreal, Canada

Modification of genetic expression patterns causing cancerous tumors or increased resistance to antibiotic drugs in pathogens affect millions of people around the globe every year. Important improvements for clinical care could result from the ability to analyze complex gene expression patterns in a time- and cost- efficient manner. The main objective of this project is to design and implement a novel DNA based reprogrammable computation system able to assay elaborate gene expression profiles. The proof of concept is to be realized by creating a computer adapted to diagnose clinically important profiles related to both cancer and antibiotic resistance.<br><br> The proposed DNA computer is divided into three intercommunicating modules (the input, the computation and the output) that combine DNA oligonucleotides and restriction enzymes to produce a useful diagnostic system. An intricate competitive hybridization reaction is used to compare the genetic expression levels of a target and a control gene and create a specific â€œvariableâ€ DNA strand representing the result. Molecular implementations of the basic logic operators assay the validity of a certain string of variables using the enzymatic cleavage of hairpin DNA loops. Lastly, a fluorescent signal is produced by a molecular beacon system. <br><br> Microfluidic integration of the system in a â€œlab-on-a-chipâ€ device can enhance speed, reaction effectiveness and sensibility to create an efficient genetic expression analysis tool for the clinical setting. Both theoretical and experimental procedures aiming to demonstrate the proof of concept have been successfully completed and the main processes behind every module have been efficiently implemented.

INHIBITORS MODULATE E-CADHERIN N-GLYCOSYLATION: STRUCTURE-FUNCTION RELATIONSHIPS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR ANTIMETASTASIS
Xiaoyun Nong
Miami Palmetto Senior High, Pinecrest, Fl, U.S.A.

The cell adhesion protein E-cadherin is often down-regulated in epithelial tumors. This effect is thought to play an important role in cancer invasion and metastasis. Recent studies have shown that tumors cells typically exhibit elevated levels of E-cadherin N-glycosylation, whereas healthy cells display hypoglycosylated E-cadherin. The restoration of E-cadherin function, therefore, may be dependent on decreasing the level of E-cadherin N-glycosylation. <br><br> <br><br> This study examined the effects of E-cadherin N-glycosylation inhibitors on cell-cell adhesion and metastatic potential. A253 cell lines were incubated for 24 h with selected inhibitors and Western blot analysis showed that wortmannin and FTI-277 lowered the amount of E-cadherin N-glycosylation. Cell aggregation assays indicated that FTI-277 stimulated cell aggregation and induced strong cell-cell contact in vitro. Cell proliferation assays, which measured the areal density of the cells after 24 h of incubation, showed that wortmannin treatment markedly reduced tumor cell growth and that FTI-277 treatment moderately slowed tumor cell growth, compared with control counterparts. <br><br> These data demonstrate that inhibitors that lower the level of N-glycosylation can restore E-cadherin-mediated adhesion, which is associated with suppression of cell metastasis. This novel approach to restoring E-cadherin function provides a new pathway for the characterization of therapeutic agents for anti-metastatic treatments.<br><br>

ASTHMATIC INHIBITION: CO LOCALIZATION AND INTERACTION OF BIOMOLECULES RGS13 AND CREB
Lecia Ashanna Moya Brown
Suncoast High School, Riviera Beach, Florida, USA

Cyclic-AMP Response Element Binding Protein (CREB) is a transcription factor regulating gene expression involved in cell proliferation, and survival. RGS13, a member of the Regulator of G Protein Signaling (RGS) family, inhibits CREB transcriptional activity induced by activated forms of Gaq as well as Gas-evoked cAMP formation. Subsequently, RGS13 inhibits CREB-dependent transcription by acting on one or more targets downstream of receptors and G proteins. Therefore, the goal is to determine whether RGS13 is co localized with CREB in the nucleus to uncover the mechanism of RGS13-mediated inhibition of CREB-dependent gene transcription. These experiments were to show co-localization of endogenous RGS13 and CREB using a human B lymphocyte cell line, Ramos, as a model system. GFP-RGS13 localized predominantly in the cytoplasm of live 293T cells by fluorescence microscopy. When co-expressed with PKA, RGS13 was detected mainly in the nucleus, as determined by co localization with DAPI.By immunoblotting, endogenous RGS13 from Ramos cells was detected in the cytosolic fraction in unstimulated cells. RGS13 was present in the nuclear fraction only after stimulation of B-cell receptor (BCR) with anti-IGM by Western Blot. Immunofluorescence revealed that in unstimulated cells endogenous RGS13 was present in the cytosol of Ramos cells. However, in contrast to Western Blot results, immunofluorescence revealed that RGS13 localized at the cell membrane after anti-IGM stimulation. RGS13 localized in the cytosol in resting B cells. After BCR stimulation, RGS13 appears to translocate to both nuclear and membrane fractions. The molecular mechanism by which RGS13 shifts its cellular localization is unknown.

PROSTATE CARCINOGENESIS AS ASSESSED BY THE COMET ASSAY AND IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY
Michelle Asha Khare
Caddo Parish Magnet High School, Shreveport, LA

More than thirty thousand American men are affected by prostate cancer every year. Our knowledge of the prostate cancer tumorigenesis is limited. Ki-67 is currently understood as a cell proliferation marker protein. This project is a continuation. In previous research, the comet assay was utilized to assess the percent of DNA left in the nucleus (“head”) after cells were exposed to an oxidizing agent, hydrogen peroxide; the same cell lines treated with Hank’s Balanced Salts Solution served as controls. The results from this research showed a higher percent migration to the tail (DNA damage) in prostate tumorigenic cell lines as opposed to nontumorigenic cell lines. In the current project, immunohistochemistry (performed by a pathologist) using the Ki-67 antibody was performed on malignant and benign prostate tumor slides. A secondary part of this experiment (performed by the student) included statistical analysis on the differences in the Comet Tail Assay results on nontumorigenic and tumorigenic cell lines and the differences in Ki-67 expression between benign and malignant prostate glands. Ki-67-positive cells were universally absent in benign prostate glands, showing 0% presence in all cases. However, Ki-67 was expressed in all carcinogenic cases, appearing in 1%-8% of the cells. Statistical analysis on this data and the quantified Comet Assay research both proved to be statistically significant (p<0.05). Statistical analyses from the comet assay results suggest that the DNA of the mutated cell line (tumorigenic) is more susceptible to oxidative damage from H2O2 than the DNA of the normal cells used in this study. Furthermore, elevated Ki-67 expression by prostate carcinoma suggests that damaged DNA might lead to an acceleration of cell replication and tumorigenesis.

CANCER METASTASIS BY EXOSOMES: DO THEY HAVE A SPECIAL LIPID SIGNATURE?
Sung-Hyun Kim
duPont Manual High School, Louisville, KY

Exosomes are vesicles excreted by cells and are believed to be intercellular messengers that may transfer different signals depending on their source. Exosomes are recently being considered as a potential mechanism by which cancer spreads. A549 cells, exosomes from A549 cells, exosomes from patients with cancer, and exosomes from non-patients who doesn’t have cancer were analyzed for phospholipid composition. It was hypothesized that A549 exosomes would display a unique lipid signature and a decrease in phosphatidylcholine would be observed. All the exosomes were analyzed by FT-IC-MS via direct infusion by Nanospray. A drastic decrease in phosphatidylcholine was observed from non-patient exosomes and A549 cells to A549 exosomes. Phosphatidylethanolamine and sphingomyelin was enriched in A549 exosomes compared to non-patient exosomes. This was partially reflected by the patient exosomes which was enriched in spingomyelin but only minimally in phosphatidylethanolamine. The results demonstrate a special lipid signature for cancerous exosomes. This phenomenon can be used to imply that exosomes are specialized bodies, different from all the other cell membrane ‘dandruff’. <br><br>The results also support the idea that cancerous exosomes contain lipid markers that makes them unique compared to exosomes derived from healthy cells.

A NOVEL ANTI-CANCER DRUG
Preeti - Singhal
Arlington High School, Arlington, TX

Cancer, which is the group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells, is the second leading cause of death after heart disease. After doing literature search, I found that in order to treat cancer, oncologists extensively use chemotherapeutic drugs such as Doxorubicin and Cisplatin, which have a lot of harmful side effects. My goal in this project was to find an inexpensive and effective treatment against cancer that would not have a significant effect on normal cells.<br><br> Prior to the experiments, we grew several types of malignant cell lines such as lung, colon, prostate, pancreas, ovarian, and breast cancer, as well as Human Aorta and Human Umbilical as the control cells. We chose to work with RLIP, Ral-Interacting protein, which is known to be a stress-responsive, active drug transporter of chemotherapeutic drugs. We first measured the level of RLIP in the cells by Western blot and Immuno-histo chemistry, and then checked the cytotoxicity of the RLIP antibody by MTT Assay, DNA laddering, and TUNEL apoptosis assay. <br><br> Our results show that the RLIP protein expression was significantly greater in malignant cells than in normal cells. Treatment with RLIP antibody caused RLIP depletion, which led to cell apoptosis in malignant cells. We found that RLIP is essential for cancer cells to function properly but not necessary for normal cell survival. Taken together, our results show that RLIP is a rational and promising target for cancer therapy that has a potential to affect the history of medicine and save the lives of multitudes.

THE EXTRACT OF THE ANNONA MURICATA LEAVES (SOURSOP) CONTAINS POSSIBLE INHIBITORS OF CANCER CELLS GROWTH
Joshua Damian Ruiz-Perez
Antonio Lucchetti Vocational High School, Arecibo, PUERTO RICO

The Annona muricata (soursop) stem and leaves has shown an active toxicity to cancer cells. This research is intended to find out the organic compounds in the leaf extract of Annona muricata (soursop) that act as possible inhibitors of cancer cells growth. It is for this reason that the postulated hypothesis indicates that Anonna muricata leaves extract contain organic compounds that are possible inhibitors of cancer cells growth. A series of processes to test the hypothesis were made and among them was the durability of the Annona muricata leaves to determine for how long the researcher can keep them before experimentation. Paper chromatography of the extract of soursop leaves was also done to study the pigmentation so that researcher can better recognize the peaks in the mass spectrometer. Thin layer chromatography of the Annona muricata leaves was also done to determine how polar or nonpolar the organic compounds from the leaf were and to determine the solvent to be used for the extraction process. Masspec analysis was done to determine the specific compounds in the leaves extract that act as possible inhibitors. In conclusion the organic compounds that are possible inhibitors were found using the masspec analysis. A variety of peaks were observed and one of them, according to literature review, is annonacin which is a possible inhibitor of cancer cells growth. This indicates that the hypothesis can be accepted.

INHIBITION OF XANTHINE OXIDASE ACTIVITY BY XANTHINE ANALOGUE CAFFEINE
Alan Flores
Weslaco East High School, Weslaco, TX

The purpose of the project was to determine if xanthine oxidase, the enzyme that produces uric acid, could be inhibited by caffeine. Caffeine is an analogue of xanthine, which is the substrate of xanthine oxidase. Inhibiting xanthine oxidase reduces uric acid production and, in the human body, would reduce the amount and intensity of chronic gout attacks. Xanthine oxidase was isolated from bovine liver. An assay was performed using a spectrophotometer to measure the change in absorbance levels after xanthine oxidase enzyme was added to a mixture of potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.5 and xanthine. Absorbance levels increased with the addition of xanthine oxidase, indicating that a reaction occurred. To verify that the increase in absorbance was caused by reaction of the enzyme-substrate complex, absorbance levels of buffer solution, buffer solution with xanthine, and buffer solution with xanthine oxidase were compared. The absorbance levels were identical, proving that the enzyme was successfully isolated. Then absorbance levels were measured for a mixture of buffer, xanthine and caffeine. Xanthine oxidase enzyme was added, causing absorbance levels to increase half as much as in the assay, verifying that caffeine successfully inhibited xanthine oxidase.

KASTLE-MEYER TEST: CRIME SCENE CLEANUP
Kassie Jean Henry
Southeastern High School, Augusta, IL

Purpose: The purpose of this investigation was to determine if hemoglobin, detected by the Kastle-Meyer test, could be removed or masked using a variety of household cleaners. Interstitial beef fluid was applied to surfaces, and Kastle-Meyer swab and spray tests were conducted to detect the presence of hemoglobin before and after application of cleaning products, as compared to the control with no cleaning application. <br><br> <br><br>Procedure: Drywall, carpet, and denim surfaces were divided into four testing areas and labeled for a control and three cleaners. Interstitial beef fluid was applied to areas. Kastle-Meyer swab tests were conducted on each area to detect the presence of hemoglobin. Cleaning products were applied and each area was scrubbed, except the control. Kastle-Meyer swab tests were repeated on each area. Kastle-Meyer spray tests were repeated on areas producing negative swab results after cleaning. Twelve trials were conducted, averaged, and graphed.<br><br> <br><br>Conclusion: Overall the scientist’s hypothesis was correct. It was predicted that surfaces scrubbed with bleach cleaner would produce negative Kastle-Meyer swab results; this was proven to be true on carpet and denim. It was also hypothesized that Kastle-Meyer spray tests would produce positive results on all surfaces, including the negative swab tests after cleaning. This was proven to be true in 143 out of 144 tests. It was determined that hemoglobin cannot be removed or masked.

A COMPARATIVE ANATOMY OF THE EFFECT OF PERMETHRIN CONCENTRATIONS ON LUMBRICUS SP USING PHOTOMICROGRAPHY
Ryan Michael Wisnoski
Crescent City Jr/Sr High School, Crescent City, FL, United States of America

This project anatomically compared the nervous system of the Lumbricus treated with varying permethrin solutions; and, the relationship of permethrin, dopamine, and Parkinson's disease was inferred.<br><br> Different permethrin concentrations were formulated. Lumbricus were divided into Control and treatment groups. They were either sprayed or injected using strong and weak solutions. Afterwards, Lumbricus were dissected for anatomical comparison. A chemical structural analysis was utilized to correlate permethrin, dopamine production, and Parkinson's disease.<br><br> Observations and results showed permethrin concentrations significantly affected the anatomy of the nervous system as verified by photomicrographs. It is likewise inferred, based on spasmodic reactions that permethrin has a direct effect on nerve ganglia, and subsequently, on dopamine production.<br><br> Permethrin is a chemical insecticide used in ferneries found to be effective in killing armyworms by ganglion disintegration. Vertebrate nervous systems produce dopamine. Since permethrin affected the simpler brain systems of invertebrates, it is inferred that it may influence the nervous systems of higher vertebrates, particularly in dopamine production. Structural analysis indicted that permethrin attaches itself to reactive sites of dopamine. A decrease in dopamine leads to the neurological degenerative disease Parkinson's and brains of people afflicted with Parkinson’s have little to no dopamine. The highest occurrences of Parkinson’s disease occur in agricultural areas. It can be inferred that this is due to the leaching of toxic insecticides, such as permethrin. The short-term exposure to these insecticides is not as harmful, but for those who live in areas exposed over extended periods of time, Parkinson's disease is more prevalent.<br><br>

ACTIVITY BASED PROTEOMIC PROFILING OF LYSOPHOSPHATIDIC ACID TREATED CANCER CELLS
Aryeh Benjamin Hillman
Francis W. Parker School; San Diego, CA; USA

Ovarian cancer is a debilitating disease lacking effective treatments. A key feature of the disease is elevated levels of the mitogenic lipid lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) found in the ascities fluid surrounding tumors. LPA evokes a wide array of pro-tumorgenic effects in cells and was recently described to stimulate the expression of a cancer associated protease, urokinase type plasminogen activator (uPA). To discern whether LPA treatment resulted in elevated uPA activity I applied a novel proteomic technique, activity-based protein profiling (ABPP), that specifically monitors the amount of protein activity rather than abundance. I utilized ABPP to examine the effect of the bioactive lipid LPA on uPA activity in a human ovarian cancer cell line SKOV-3. To achieve this, I first developed a new strategy for analysis of secreted proteins and then determined that treatment of SKOV-3 cells with LPA does indeed result in increases of active uPA. In addition to this finding, I also detected elevated uPA activity upon treatment of structurally distinct forms of LPA that vary in acyl chain length. This finding has not previously been reported and demonstrates the power of ABPP to identify changes in activity of low abundance proteins.

WHAT TYPES OF BIOMASS HAVE THE GREATEST GLUCOSE YIELD THROUGH ENZYMATIC HYDROLYSIS?
Erin Marie Rosswurm
Columbus East High School, Columbus Indiana, USA

The United States faces an increased demand for energy and ever more stringent emission requirements. Ethanol is a renewable energy source that can be produced by converting cellulosic materials to fermentable sugars. This project examines the conversion efficiency of cellulose contained in biomass. My hypothesis was that the concentration of cellulose in different types of biomass would play the largest role in the amount of glucose converted. <br><br> A glucose meter was calibrated and used to determine the glucose concentration during the experiments. The biomass samples were dried, ground, and added to a buffer solution. Trichoderma reasei cellulase was added to begin saccrification. <br><br> Results showed a glucose level of over 600 mg/dL from the microcystalline cellulose sample and lower amounts in the sawdust, corn stalks and corn leaves (mid 200mg/dL). Wheat straw, grass, and corn cobs attained a glucose level in the mid hundreds of mg/dL. Maple leaves started and ended with an abnormally high glucose level. With the exception of maple leaves, there was a natural logarithmic curve for the glucose reaction rate for all biomass material.<br><br> In conclusion, the percent yield of glucose was inversely related to the concentration of lignin in the sample. The rate of hydrolysis decreased through time due to the reduction of the cellulose and feedback inhibition. Further experimentation will be done with maple leaves to determine the apparent lack of a cellulose-to-glucose reaction. Research will also be performed to determine the effects that enzyme and substrate loading have on the hydrolysis reaction rates. <br><br>

EXAMINING THE EVOLUTION OF THE INFLUENZA VIRUS
Sanjay Vasudev Saraf
Alfred M. Barbe High School, Lake Charles, LA, United States

The purpose of my study was to see if the human H1N1 flu could evolve into a potentially pandemic flu. To do this, I determined whether or not the virus sequence acquired differences over time, and whether or not it acquired more differences over more distant regions. I compared the viruses of today with viruses that have caused or have the danger of causing pandemics, including the H5N1 avian flu. I also looked at structure data for hemagglutinin, the protein on influenza that binds to the cell membrane and allows the virus to enter a cell. <br><br>I conducted my experiments by using the virus databases made available to me from the Science Buddies site, and compared them using the Biology Workbench, an online tool from the University of Illinois for sequence comparisons. Doing this, I created distance matrices on the relationships between different strains of influenza virus. With these, I created graphs of trends with respect to time and distance. To make sure I didn't get any odd sequence, I used many sequences for each experiment. I used a program called Cn3d from the National Center for Biotechnology Information to do the structure comparisons with the protein sequence. <br><br>I saw that distance didn’t seem to have an effect on mutation, but I also saw that there was an upward trend when comparing time and mutations. I observed a 30% difference between the common flu and the flu pandemic of 1918, but observed a 50% difference between the common flu and the avian flu. It is known that the 1918 flu developed into our common flu, and this explains why the two were so similar. Because of the large differences between the common flu and the avian flu, I conclude that it is not quite possible for the human flu to naturally mutate into a pandemic flu in the near future. I also conclude that a different mechanism should exist in the creation of a pandemic virus.<br><br>

A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE PROTEINS IN DIFFERENT TYPES OF BEANS AND IN CHICKEN
Meghna P. Singh
Classen School of Advanced Studies, Oklahoma City, OK

This project was chosen because it is often said that since vegetarians do not eat meat, they do not receive an adequate amount of protein, yet others say vegetarians get plenty of protein from beans. The purpose of this project was to analyze and compare how the protein in chicken, kidney beans, black chick peas, garbanzo beans, and mung beans differ. Proteins are highly complex substances present in all living organisms and are essential for life. It was hypothesized that if chicken, kidney beans, black chick peas, garbanzo beans, and mung beans were tested for their amount of protein, then chicken meat would have the most protein because meat is mainly composed of muscle, which is protein dense. Five grams of each sample were thoroughly cooked and homogenized in 12 ml of phosphate saline buffer. Each sample was then filtered and assayed with a Thermo Scientific BCA protein assay kit and a spectrophotometer. Mung beans had the highest amount of protein (4.54 ± 0.36 mg/ml), followed by chicken (4.24 ± 0.23 mg/ml), kidney beans (3.07 ± 0.32 mg/ml), garbanzo beans (2.62 ± 0.15 mg/ml), and black chick peas (1.55 ± 0.12 mg/ml). In conclusion, the hypothesis was not supported by the data because mung beans (4.54 mg/ml) had approximately seven percent more protein than chicken (4.24 mg/ml).

MAGNETORECEPTION: THE ROLE OF MAGNETITE AND THE PIEZOELECTRIC EFFECT.
Christopher Cody Notz
Tuscarawas Valley High School, Zoarville OH, United States

Magnetoreception is the ability of migratory animals to detect and use the earth’s magnetic field to migrate. Although the use of magnetoreception for directional information in migratory animals is well established experimentally, it is not known by which biophysical mechanism magnetoreception is achieved. The purpose of this project involves investigation into the role of magnetite and the piezoelectric effect in magnetoreception.<br><br> The theory behind this investigation is that magnetite, a ferromagnetic substance present in organisms, will react to the earth’s magnetic field. These particles on or near the cell membrane of the cell will apply pressure to the membrane when it is affected by the magnetic field. This pressure upon the phospholipids of the cell membrane sparks the piezoelectric effect, which is the ability of substances to create an electrical current when mechanical pressure is applied. This electrical current is then sent to the brain telling the animal if it is going in the correct direction. <br><br> The first step of the project was to show that the phospholipids of the cell membrane would allow the magnetite to move (disorient the phospholipids) when it was placed in a magnetic field. The second step was to test these phospholipids for any signs of piezoelectricity. <br><br> The results showed that the magnetite demonstrated the ability to disorient the phospholipids while in a magnetic field. Also, pressure applied to the phospholipids did result in differences in electrical conductivity directly proportional to the pressure differences. The results of the experiments support the theory on magnetoreception.<br><br>

SYNTHESIS, PURIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF LNA OLIGONUCLEOTIDES.
Lise Goltermann
Niels Steensens School, Copenhagen, Denmark

My project focuses on the chemical synthesis of LNA (Locked Nucleic Acid) oligonucleotides which are DNA analogs. I have synthesized two DNA oligonucleotides each containing LNA monomers. <br><br>Nucleotide 1: 5’-gcT agT ATc ctg-3’ <br><br>Nucleotide 2: 5’-AQ-t5-gcT agT ATc ctg-3’ <br><br>The synthesis utilizes the knowledge of organic reaction types such as nucleophilic substitution. The general idea was to synthesize two different LNA oligonucleotides which then should be purified and characterized with the intension of determining the purity and yield of this synthesis. <br><br>The nucleotides were synthesized using a DNA synthesizer and specific functional groups were by use of the synthesizer or by hand either added to or removed from the nucleotide to achieve the desired product. Purification was achieved by using RP-HPLC and anion exchange HPLC and manual collection of the desired fragments of the sample served as a more accurate method to obtain high purity in preference to automatic collection. The difference between the retention times of the two nucleotides helped determine which nucleotide contained the more polar functional groups. <br><br>Using Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation Mass Spectrometry and Optical Density measurements the molar mass of each nucleotide was determined. And by conducting yet another RP-HPLC measurement the purity of nucleotides could easily be calculated. Although the yield ranged from only 2%-25% of the theoretical yield, the purity of the final products was as high as between 88% and above 90%. The conducted measurements were carefully selected based on the evaluation of the solubility, polarity and volatility of the synthesized molecules.<br><br>

In my experiment I characterized alleles for multiple SSR markers that could possibly have an association with aphid resistance or maturity groups. Creating an aphid resistant line of soybeans that can fully develop in South Dakota, would eliminate the need to spray fields or introduce biological control factors in South Dakota.<br><br>Crosses were made among four lines to produce two three-way crosses among three families. The parent lines included two Round-up ready South Dakota lines, a plant introduction line, and the aphid resistance line Dowling. Plants from these crosses that showed antibiosis and non-preference characteristics were selected for the caged aphid trial this last summer. I used aphid counts from this trial to determine if certain markers had an association with aphid resistance or maturity groups. <br><br>PCR and electrophoresis were used to characterize markers.<br><br>In 2006 I characterized Satt245 using different plant samples. <br><br>This year, markers examined included Satt245, Satt540, Satt435, Satt463, Satt536, and Satt250. All are on chromosome M. It is already known that Satt435 and Satt463 are the closes to and flanking the aphid resistance gene Rag. Satt245 and Satt540 were chosen to be characterized because of their closeness to Rag and their allele sizes differed significantly among parents. Satt245 showed a significant association with aphid resistance among all the families with p<.0001. Satt540 along with resistance from Satt245 showed the best aphid resistance among the first family with p<.001. Satt435 will be used in the third family as an alternative. Satt250 showed no significance for maturity groups. <br><br>

RATIONALLY DESIGNED BETA-CATENIN INHIBITORS AS ANTI-TUMOR AGENTS
Samuel Wye Pritt
Home School, Walkersville, MD

Beta-catenin is a critical component of the Wnt signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in embryonic development. In adults, the pathway activity is reduced in most tissues by a tightly controlled regulation of beta-catenin levels. A destruction complex composed of proteins axin, GSK-3 and APC targets beta-catenin for proteosomal degradation by phosphorylation. A mutation in any of these proteins can cause increased levels of oncogenic beta-catenin leading to overexpression of Wnt-related genes and tumor development. Prior work has focused on targeting the beta-catenin destruction complex using small-molecule inhibitors, but with limited success and often major safety concerns. This project adopts a different approach, using rationally designed synthetic dominant-negative inhibitors of beta-catenin. Inhibitors are structured as mimetics of the highly conserved helix C region of beta-catenin, modified by attachment of fatty acids to increase cell permeability and facilitate correct folding. Structural optimization resulted in compounds that inhibit the growth of Wnt pathway-dependent cancer cells with IC50 in submicromolar range. Confocal laser scanning microscopy imaging of lung cancer cells expressing GFP-tagged beta-catenin uncovered dramatic changes in protein localization and proteosome-mediated degradation of beta-catenin upon exposure to the inhibitors. Microscale thermophoresis experiments revealed that the inhibitors bind to beta-catenin directly. The compounds represent a new class of Wnt pathway inhibitors that act by facilitating beta-catenin degradation. They are promising drug candidates for the treatment of many tumor types.

ENZYMATIC HYDROGEN PRODUCTION USING PYROCOCCUS FURIOSUS: A VIABLE SOLUTION FOR RENEWABLE, CLEAN ENERGY, PHASE II
Joseph Robert Stunzi
Clarke Central High School, Athens, GA

Establishing a sustainable energy future is one of the most pressing tasks that mankind faces today. Enzymatic biohydrogen production presents a viable solution. Pyrococcus furiosus is a hyperthermophilic archaeon that contains highly stable and catalytically active hydrogen producing enzymes, called hydrogenases. This research has demonstrated that hydrogen can be efficiently produced using such enzymes.<br><br> In order to modify and design an efficient hydrogenase protein, Escherichia coli was chosen for expression due to the lack of a genetic system for the native organism. To address the need of the chaperone proteins for protein folding, in vitro reconstitution was completed using recombinantly expressed and purified proteins in addition to supplementary additives as well as the chaperone proteins. Via such means, a protein complex capable of producing hydrogen was obtained using proteins purified from both small-scale growths as well as large-scale fermentations. Results were measured and quantified via gas chromatography analysis.<br><br> In order to increase efficiency, transgenetic mutation of genetically modified E. coli strains was conducted. A minimal media growth condition was found that enabled genetic selection for hydrogen production within E. coli. Using this growth condition in combination with four plasmid vectors containing the hydrogenase proteins and their associated chaperone proteins, it was possible to mutate E. coli to produce hydrogen natively. The increased efficiency of enzymatic hydrogen production could potentially revolutionize the generation of clean energy, as we know it today. As a result of this, dependency on foreign oil could be significantly reduced as well as green house gas emissions.

MULTIPLE HUMAN UDP-GLUCURONOSYLTRANSFERASES CATALYZE THE DETOXIFICATION OF ACETAMINOPHEN: A FOURTH YEAR STUDY
Marissa Rachel Kessler
Mills E. Godwin High School, Richmond, VA, USA

Overdose with the analgesic drug acetaminophen (Tylenol ) is one of the leading causes of liver failure, resulting in 600 liver transplants and 100 deaths yearly in the United States. Recent bulletins from the Food and Drug Administration have lowered the recommended safe dosage for acetaminophen (APAP). UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), a Phase 2 drug-metabolizing enzyme found in the liver, are responsible for converting chemical toxins into water-soluble compounds that the body can excrete easily, thereby preventing subsequent organ damage. To assess the contribution of individual UGT1A isoforms to the breakdown and elimination of APAP, human UGT1A expressing-Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) membrane fractions were treated with acetaminophen and sampled over a 72-hour period. HPLC analysis of supernatants from HEK control reactions and UGT1A4 membrane fractions showed no glucuronide formation even after 72 hours. In contrast, as early as 15 minutes after incubating APAP with UGT1A6-HEK membrane fractions, glucuronide formation was detected. UGT1A1 (540 pmol), 1A6 (2577 pmol), and 1A9 (433 pmol) expressing-HEK membrane fractions all resulted in APAP-glucuronides with maximum formation occurring after 48 hours. Additionally, when the inactive isoform UGT1A4 was combined in a reaction with the most active isoform (UGT1A6) glucuronide formation increased more than 2-fold over UGT1A6 alone (5274 pmol vs. 2577 pmol). These data are the first evidence that UGT1A4/1A6 dimerization may occur and that enzyme function is possibly impacted by dimer formation. In conclusion, this study reveals that multiply human liver UGT isoforms are responsible for detoxifying acetaminophen, which may result in new therapies being developed.

PEPPER SPECIES OF CAPSICUM ANNUM AS A BIOLOGICAL CONTROL FOR HYPOTHENEMUS HAMPEI (COFFEE BROCA)
Veronica Burgos Villodas
Petra Mercado Bougart High School, Humacao, PUERTO RICO

There are many risks involved in the healthy production of crops. One of the most common risks are plagues. Coffee plantations can be destroyed by Hypothenemus hampei, also known as coffee broca plague. Most of the available pesticides are expensive and harmful for the environment. Therefore, the creation of an organic pesticide would be helpful and friendly for both agriculture and the environment. The question is if it is possible to develop an organic pesticide that can be used as biological control for Hypothenemus hampei. The hypothesis for this investigation was that the extracts of different pepper species of Capsicum annum can be used as organic pesticides to control Hypothenemus hampei. Extracts from each of five different pepper species of Capsicum annum were prepared using a 1:1 solution of the solvents CH2Cl2 and CH3OH. One pepper was put in a ceramic mortar and was macerated as the solution was added to it. This substance was filtrated by gravity and then was placed in a rotavap machine. The Artemia salina Bioassay was done to detect the insecticidal activity of each extract. All extracts were positive but had different insecticidal activity. The results were presented in LC50 (Lethal Concentration 50) graphics. The five extracts were added to some twenty Hypothenemus hampei larvae and adults together. Results evidenced that yellow chile pepper extract was the most effective one since it exterminated all Hypothenemus hampei larvae and adults. The hypothesis was accepted. Thin layer chromatography tests were done to each extract for further study.

STABILIZING PHOSPHOTRIESTERASE USING PYROSETTA FOR NEUROTOXIN DEGRADATION
Michelle Zhang
Stuyvesant High School, New York City

Pesticides are poisonous chemicals that are annually released into the soil, the air, and the water upon use, becoming potential environmental and health hazards. Phosphotriesterase (PTE), an enzyme from the soil bacterium Pseudomonas diminuta, was discovered to hydrolyze the class of pesticides called organophosphates (OPs). Previous studies have yielded thermo-stabilized mutants with an increase in expression rate. Here we attempt to design a temporally stabilized mutant. Using PyRosetta, a python interface to the Rosetta protein modeling suite, we reengineered the homodimer interface of the enzyme using an expanded amino acid toolbox that included fluorinated amino acids such as parafluorophenylalanine (pFF). The enzyme was systematically probed for destabilizing positions, yielding a set of mutant sequences. A key mutant (SBM) encoded additional hydrogen bonds across the dimer interface and had a higher binding energy measured by Rosetta energy units when compared to that of the previously stabilized mutant. Designed to remain active for longer periods of time, the mutant has the potential of degrading more toxins when used for bioremediation in organophosphate devastated areas.

CONSISTENCY OF PHYLOGENETIC RELATIONSHIPS: PROTEINS FROM VARIOUS SPECIES
Sanjay Vasudev Saraf
Barbe High School, Lake Charles, LA, USA

The purpose of the my experimentation is to find whether phylogenetic relationships are the same when comparing different proteins with various sets of animals. I hypothesized that the phylogenetic trees would not be consistent because each animal’s DNA programs proteins slightly differently.<br><br> For my experiments, I used two well-known proteins, myoglobin and hemoglobin, and three subject groups, general, primates, and rodents. I compared the sequences and used interpreting tools to generate phylogenetic trees of the results. <br><br> I found that my hypothesis was true, phylogenetic trees are not consistent when comparing different proteins. This was especially seen in my primate experiments. So, put simply, a human may be more closely related to a chimp than a gorilla for one protein, and vice versa for a different protein. This has significance in many medical and scientific purposes, such as selecting a test animal for a medicine, or transplant surgeries with animal parts. <br><br>

THE ROLE OF CDC55-DEPENDENT PP2A IN THE REGULATION OF CLN2
Annie Priyanka Ashok
Central High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America

Phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis are important regulatory processes in eukaryotes. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a major serine/threonine phosphatase. Cdc55, a B regulatory subunit of PP2A, regulates what the complex dephosphorylates. The SCF complex is a ubiquitin ligase which ubiquitinates phosphorylated substrates. Grr1, an F-box protein of SCF, provides substrate specificity. <br><br> Previous studies have shown that the instability of the G1 cyclin Cln2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is essential for normal progression through the cell cycle. The degradation of Cln2 is phosphorylation-dependent and is mediated by SCF. It has also been found that functional Grr1 is required for the viability of S. cerevisiae lacking CDC55 and that cdc55 mutants accumulate less Cln2 than WT cells, which suggests that Cdc55 may dephosphorylate Cln2.<br><br> Cdc55 expressing pGAL-CLN2-4T3S accumulates Cln2 that cannot be phosphorylated and is inviable. To investigate possible reasons for inviability, pGAL-GRR1 was transformed into cdc55 and WT with mutant CLN2 and WT CLN2. It was found that overexpression of Grr1 repressed inviability of cdc55 expressing mutant CLN2. This suggests that inviability results from overaccumulation of Cln2 due to the lack of sufficient Grr1. <br><br> To determine whether competitive inhibition of the SCF complex, leading to accumulation of the SCF target protein Sic1 caused inviability, the CLN2 plasmids will be transformed into sic1 , cdc55 sic1 and grr1 sic1 . <br><br> Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis has been studied in the clinical breast cancer field. Understanding these pathways and the role of PP2A and SCF in cell cycle regulation can provide information in the areas of prognostics and treatment of breast cancer.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF LEAD IN LIPSTICK TO HUMAN HEALTH
Robert Perez-Ossers
Centro Residencial de Oportunidades Educativas de Mayaguez, Mayaguez, PUERTO RICO

Cosmetics such as lipstick have become a major necessity to humans in today’s society. Lipstick contains a specific quantity of lead and it is a chemical element that is a carcinogen and in the case of exposure to the chemical, causes major health problems. The problem was what quantities of lead are present among the examined lipstick brands and how different quantities of lead affect human health. The hypothesis was that lipsticks have a considerable amount of lead, sufficient enough to affect human health. There were two tests to perform, the thin-layer chromatography test and the gold ring test. For the thin-layer chromatography test, 8 strips of filter paper were dipped into a solution with the lipstick samples for two days and then analyzed. For the gold ring test 8 strips of filter paper were set on a flat surface with the samples applied. A 14 karat gold ring was rubbed on top of the samples until there were visible traces of lead. Then these lipstick samples were observed under a microscope, using ultraviolet light. The presence of brilliant spots indicated that the samples contained lead. The tests confirmed the established hypothesis by showing that all of the lipstick samples on both tests contained lead. The scientific literature proved that the quantities of lead that are present in lipstick are significantly high and can effectively harm human health.

PRODUCTION OF RIBOFLAVIN BY FERMENTATION AND FOLLOWING CHEMICAL PURIFICATION
Julie Svalo Jensen
Holstebro Tekniske Gymnasium, Holstebro, Denmark

The purpose of this project was to produce the vitamin riboflavin by fermentation. And afterwards make a purification of the growth media. Because there was no published literature, I was forced to compile an experimentation instruction by myself. I had to discover whether the production of riboflavin, was largest under aerob or anaerob conditions. The used bacteria were Bacillus Megaterium, supplied by DMZE in Germany. <br><br> I performed several experiments in order to find the best chemical purification method. I found that chemical precipitation, filtration, ion exchanging and complex binding gave the best result.<br><br> I observed by visual studies (colour) that there had been a production of riboflavin. The vitamin was also detected in a spectrophotometric analysis. According to this analysis the anaerob production was at an amount of 0.01768g/L and the aerob was at 0.082068g/L. This shows that the best circumstances for the production of riboflavin is under aerob conditions. <br><br> I was able to find a purification method that worked in the testing period using a substitute for my own growth media. But in the purified riboflavin was there a rest of silver, added under the complex binding. Therefore the product could not be used as a vitamin supplement. It would be possible to reduce the amount of silver by adding more ammonium to the substance. Hereby the balance would be displaced and more of the silver-ammonium complex would be created including riboflavin. <br><br> Instead of medical purpose this method can be used by both chemistry- and biotechnology students.<br><br>

Cep.93340-140, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.

The microbial treatment of industrial or domestic waste is called bioremediation. This is an ecological and economic method. This project is about the microbial degradation of feathers waste in poultry industry residues.<br><br>The justification of this project is that in Brazil the quantity of residual feather is 10 thousand tons and in USA come is about 76 thousand tons monthly. These residues are composed of keratin. It’s a fibrous and insoluble protein resistant to the majority proteolitic enzymes. Feather meal is commonly used in food to livestock, but the Brazilian animal raising society doesn't advice this use, because in animals organism the keratin isn’t digested and the accumulated part can causes sickness. The problem is: How to reduce the accumulation of feather residues in the environment, transforming them in a new product?<br><br>The hypothesis is that microorganisms from the environment that rapidly degrade keratin could be used in industrial scale. It’s also possible to use the degraded material for an animal food supplement.<br><br>To confirm this hypothesis some microorganisms were isolated from a hen house soil samples, which were spread in plates of feather flour agar.<br><br>Concluding, this work can contribute to reduce the environment pollution caused by the industry residues. And, the originated of this transforming process could be used in the animal alimentation.<br><br>

ROLE OF TOXIC N-ACETYL ASPARTATE ON OLIGODENDROGLIAL CELL DEVELOPMENT IN CANAVAN DISEASE
Gazelle Meriam Zerafati
The Baldwin School, Bryn Mawr, PA

Canavan Disease (CD) is a childhood neurodegenerative disorder characterized by developmental regression, macrocephaly, and severe spastic paralysis. CD is caused by mutations in the gene coding for aspartoacylase (ASPA), which normally catalyses N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) in neurons. In CD, NAA accumulates in the brain and a degenerative process characterized by the loss of myelin ensues. Myelin is produced by oligodendroglial (oligo) cells, which are presumed to evolve from the Neural Stem Cells through the intermediary Glial Progenitor Cells (GPC).<br><br>We aimed to study the effects of elevated NAA levels, the major biochemical disturbance in CD, on the maturation of the GPC's into oligo's. We created an in-vitro model of CD by exposing rat GPC's to increasing concentrations of NAA (zero, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, and 5.0 mM) and monitored their ability to survive and differentiate into various cells. Immuno-staining was performed for antigens of interest representing oligo's, astrocytes, and neurons. We estimated the number of each cell type using a digital imaging software. The results were compiled on Microsoft Excel and compared using t-test analysis.<br><br>Although exposure to a high concentration of NAA was not toxic to glial cell viability, it significantly reduced GPC maturation into oligo's and increased their differentiation into astrocytes. These results support a toxic role of NAA in CD during oligo development. We conclude that high NAA causes oligo toxicity in CD, which in turn contributes to demyelination. The notion of cell therapy using GPC's for demyelinating diseases is a promising one and should be the subject of future studies.

AGAIN WITH THAT DOG GONE POOP, A SECOND YEAR STUDY
Amber Samantha Harris
Franklin High School, El Paso, TX

The purpose of this project was to test the effects of five different enzyme- containing substances – meat tenderizer containing Papain, yeast for its maltase, bromelain digestive supplements, shiitake mushrooms for their xylanase, and amylase on the breakdown of dog feces. These substances were also combined with mold-inhibiting and odor eliminating substances - vinegar, copper (II) sulfate, activated carbon, and sand.<br><br>It was hypothesized that mushroom alone and the combination of mushroom and activated carbon (CM) would breakdown the feces at the same rate and eliminate more odor in comparison to any other substance combination. Air-dried feces samples of three different dogs were gathered and placed in 10% m/v solutions of each substance and exposed to air through holes in the lids. The feces breakdown was measured as a weight loss comparison. The second experiment used only one dog’s feces. The best performing substances from experiment one, tenderizer and mushroom, degraded the feces the most and had the least odor. The worst performing substance, yeast, had the least degradation and the most odor. These three substances were tested with the afore mentioned mold and odor inhibitors. Similar degrading and drying procedures were followed and all weight losses, odors, and breakdown rates were compared. The results supported and rejected the hypothesis. The CM solution eliminated the most odor but had the lowest percentage of weight loss. Adding odor-eliminators decreased the percentage of weight loss when compared to experiment one weight loss percentages. The experiment yielded good results for creating a feces-degrading solution.

ETHANOL PRODUCTION IN BLUESTEM GRASS
Allison Ruth Wilson
West Central Valley High School, Stuart, Iowa, United States

With the rising cost and limited supply of nonrenewable energy sources, there is a great need to find an alternative source of energy. A promising area is the use of biomass to create ethanol. The purpose of this project is to find the best procedure for producing ethanol using Bluestem grass. Different variables looked at included percent sulfuric acid and cook time in the pretreatment stage, and enzymes and yeasts in the fermentation stage. It was hypothesized that the higher acid, higher cook time, Multifect A40 in combination with Multifect Xylanase, and the addition of a pichia yeast would produce the highest yield. First the grass was harvested and blended it into fine material. In an Erlenmeyer flask, the grass, distilled water, and acid were mixed. The material was cooked in a pressure cooker and the pH was then balanced to 5.7. Peptone, yeast extract, yeast and enzyme were added. The samples were analyzed for ethanol yield. In conclusion, the hypothesis was partially supported. The higher acid and lower cook time had the highest ethanol production with an average of 38.8 gallons/ acre. The GC 220/ Multifect Xylanase created the highest ethanol yield of 68.8 gallons/ acre. The addition of pichia yeast raised the yield by 7.4%. Future experiments include determining which harvesting stages are the most effective. Because the chemical mechanisms of ethanol production are not completely understood, this project helps to establish a more efficient method. With this knowledge, we will be able to make ethanol more competitive.

TRACING THE MISTAKES OF NATURE: MODEL STUDY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A STRATEGY TO PROHIBIT BETA-AMYLOID AGGREGATION
Yarim Lee
Townsend Harris High School, Flushing, NY

Alzheimer’s disease is one of the most devastating diseases in the world affecting 80 million patients world-wide. Researchers suggest that one of causes for Alzheimer’s is aggregation of misfolded beta-amyloid. There is no effective treatment for Alzheimer’s yet, this research promotes the pathway in finding a way to stop the progression of this dementia. <br><br>It was hypothesized that pi-stacking is the reason behind aggregation. A strategic approach was used to combat pi-stacking against pi-stacking. A mediator in literature, beta-amyloid 15-20 (lead compound), was used to disrupt the pi-stacking amongst beta amyloids 1-42 in the aggregation. <br><br>The goal in this research is to improve pi-stacking power between the mediator and beta-amyloid 1-42 in order to stop aggregation. A model peptide was used as the mediator and modified with various groups. However, an increase of pi-stacking power by the fluorine group caused a problem of stronger self-aggregation of mediators. Yet, this problem was tackled by using an electron-rich phototrigger, p-hydroxy phenacyl. Then, the mediator was successfully released by light. This mediator possesses stronger pi-stacking ability than the mediator in literature under clinical test.<br><br>This model study will be repeated with the actual beta amyloid 15-20 mediator with the modification of the fluorine groups on the two phenyl rings. If all is successful, this mediator will be tested in vitro. Hopefully this research can lead to help studies in Alzheimer’s disease and eventually stop the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.

ROLE OF CYTOCHROME P450 1B1 IN THE RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM
Jonathan Louie Lin
Germantown High School, Germantown, TN

It has been shown that angiotensin II (Ang II) and arachidonic acid (AA) induced migration, proliferation and hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is mediated by oxygen radicals . The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between CYP1B1, AA and NADPH oxidase in the generation of oxygen radicals in rat vascular smooth muscle cells. Ang II (200 nM) and AA (10 μM) increased 1.4- and 1.7-fold ROS production respectively, was measured using dihydroethidium. First, there was treatment of VSMCs with 2,4,3’,5’-tetramethoxy-stilbene (TMS) (100 nM), a CYP1B1 inhibitor. Then there was transduction of VSMCs with adenovirus CYP1B1 shRNA but along with its scrambled control which reduced CYP1B1 activity (measured using P450 GLOTM assay kit), and decreased Ang II- and AA-induced oxygen radical production and NAD(P)H oxidase activity measured by chemiluminescence. Ang II- and AA-induced NOX1 expression was attenuated by TMS and NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin; the latter agent decreased ROS production but did not alter CYP1B1 activity in VSMCs. 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoicacid,an analog of AA, decreased Ang II- and AA-induced NADPH oxidaseactivity and expression of NOX1. These data suggest that Ang II-induced ROS production by NAD(P)H oxidase is mediated via AA release and its metabolism by CYP1B1 in VSMCs.

NEW POTATO CULTIVARS AND POTENTIAL ACRYLAMIDE REDUCTION: HYDROLYZED GLUCOSE MINIMIZATION UNDER THERMAL DEGRADATION AND STORAGE
Carmina Mirandilla Escalante
Clarke Central High School, Athens, GA

This year's project is Phase 3 of my ongoing research on the different facets of starch hydrolysis into certain monosaccharides that influence the production of acrylamide in french fries. Phase 3 focuses on the cultivar effect on the desired minimization of hydrolized levels of glucose, a monosaccharide identified as among the major precursors of acrylamide accumulation in carbohydrate-rich foods baked or fried at high temperatures. The cultivar effect is analyzed using the starch hydrolysis factors considered in Phase 2 that cover two extreme temperature settings: thermal degradation under high baking temperature settings and the low temperature sweetening effect arising from storage conditions.

This project is the result of the experimentation to determine future fuel cell applications. The main intention of this project is to find how Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be used as a biorenewable energy source in a standard Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC). Thus, the problem statement of the experiment is, “Can Saccharomyces cerevisiae based Microbial Fuel Cells be used in Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)?” The current issue with the Implanted Pulse Generator (IPG) is that it requires repeated surgeries to replace the battery, so an alternate biorenewable energy source is beneficial. The initial purpose was to see if such a fuel cell could replace the IPG used for DBS. The hypothesis was that if the yeast based fuel cell could produce a voltage greater than 200 mV, then it could be used in place of the IPG. This is based on current voltage productions of approximately 150 mV in standard MFCs. <br><br> <br><br>The process of the testing was done in three steps. First, an experiment was conducted to see how electricity can be produced from a standard two-chamber MFC using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Next, numerous experimental parameters were altered to improve the voltage production. Finally, the last step was to see whether the voltage is generated consistently. <br><br>By observing the results from this experiment, it can be seen that this technology could be implemented in biomedical devices in the near future.

NEW POTATO CULTIVARS AND POTENTIAL ACRYLAMIDE REDUCTION: HYDROLYZED GLUCOSE MINIMIZATION UNDER THERMAL DEGRADATION AND STORAGE
Carmina Mirandilla Escalante
Clarke Central High School, Athens, GA

This year's project is Phase 3 of my ongoing research on the different facets of starch hydrolysis into certain monosaccharides that influence the production of acrylamide in french fries. Phase 3 focuses on the cultivar effect on the desired minimization of hydrolized levels of glucose, a monosaccharide identified as among the major precursors of acrylamide accumulation in carbohydrate-rich foods baked or fried at high temperatures. The cultivar effect is analyzed using the starch hydrolysis factors considered in Phase 2 that cover two extreme temperature settings: thermal degradation under high baking temperature settings and the low temperature sweetening effect arising from storage conditions. The cultivars used in this year's project are the Premier Russet and Defender varieties developed by the Northwest Potato Variety Development Program, a tri-state research project of scientists from Idaho, Oregon and Washington.<br><br>The separate capabilities of these 2 new cultivars to minimize the production of hydrolyzed glucose are compared with the same tendency of the ordinary Russet potatoes popularly used for french fries production.

DESIGN AND SYNTHESIS OF A GFP-BASED MOLECULAR SWITCH FOR THE DETECTION OF PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS
Ahmed Hussein Badran
Tucson High Magnet School, Tucson, AZ, U.S.A.

Since it was discovered by Osamu Shimomura in 1962, the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) has become an invaluable research tool in contemporary cell biology. Throughout this period of time, GFP has been utilized in a variety of methods, one of which is the detection of protein-protein interactions through the refolding of fragmented GFP. This paper describes a novel method for the detection of protein-protein interactions through the use of non-fragmented, properly folded GFP. This approach combines the ability of heterodimerization of coiled coils with the dependence of GFP fluorescence on proper folding of the protein to shield the fluorophore and maintain fluorescence. This project demonstrates the design and synthesis of a molecular switch in which one of a pair of coiled coils is incorporated into GFP, where fluorescence is abolished upon binding of the two coiled coils. This research can possibly be applied to the detection other proteins, either in vivo or in vitro, through the disruption of the coiled coil binding in the molecular switch.

THE QUANTITY OF STARCH IN DIFFERENT TUBERCLES
Angel A. Valdez-Zabala
Antonio Valero de Bernabe School, Fajardo, Puerto Rico

This investigation consisted of finding out which of the most consumed tubercles in the Puerto Rican diet contain the greatest amount of starch. It is commented that the ageing persons are healthy because they use to eat tubercles. But it is known that a high content of starch in some tubercles become simple sugars in the body. This have the effect of increasing the blood sugar levels of the diabetics. The tubercles selected for this study were: Solanum tuberosum (potato), Ipomoea batatas (Sweet potato), Manihot esculenta (Yuca) and the Colocasia escuelta (“Yautía” an edible tropical root). The hypothesis established that The “Yautía” was going to have the highest amount of starch .All the tubercles were grinded and the same mass of each one was measured.Each amount of the grinded tubercles was dissolved, separately, in 25 mL of distilled water. Then each of the solutions was filtered and all were left to dry in the sun . The starch obtained was measured in grams. The amount of starch in the “Yautía” was 3.0 grams, in the Yucca was 2.3 grams, the sweet potato was 0.8 g and the potato was 0.3.g The results demonstrated that, as established in the hypothesis, the “Yautía” was the tubercle with the highest amount of starch. These results bring a great preoccupation because the “Yautía” will increase the blood sugar levels of diabetic persons and it is highly consumed in the Puerto Rican diet.

BIOLUMINESCENCE OF DINOFLAGELLATES
Austin Andrew Chick
Hanford High School, Richland Washington, United States

Last year, my objective was to develop a way to consistently measure amounts of light energy produced by the single celled dinoflagellate species, pyrocystis fusiformis, during mechanical stimulus. I tested the amount of light energy produced at different times in their circadian cycles and found that they produce the most in the middle of the night. <br><br>This year, I found that a colony needs 5-7 days to recover to produce a maximum amount of light energy. This is about the length of the p. fusiformis lifespan. I hypothesized that the cells can only bioluminesce once. To test this, I isolated and stimulated a countable number of cells in beakers. After 2 days, only a couple of the cells glowed. This means that in the 2 days, only 1 or 2 cells divided to produce new, light producing cells. The others in the beaker couldn’t because they had already glowed. This shows that they can only glow once in their lives. By exposing the dinoflagellates to different spectrums and intensities of light, I found that they do best with low level florescence. I also did testing on the oxygen retention capabilities of cells in an oxygen deficient environment. I want to find out if they can retain oxygen, and if they would use oxygen produced by their chloroplasts for the bioluminescent reaction.<br><br>

THE MECHANISMS AND ACTIONS OF PARTHENOLIDE ON PLATELET 5-HT SECRETION IN VITRO: INDICATING A POSSIBLE PATHOGENESIS OF THE MIGRAINE
Sarah Elizabeth Guthrie
Boulder High School, Boulder, CO

Extracts of the medicinal herb feverfew and its active compound, parthenolide, have been determined to have anti-inflammatory, anti-migraine, and anti-cancerous effects, though the biochemical pathways involved have not been fully characterized. Both inhibit human platelet aggregation and serotonin (5-HT) secretion and are hypothesized to inhibit the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. PKC mediates the phosphorylation of the 5-HT transporter in platelets and induces 5-HT secretion when activated. A platelet-based model was used to mimic the behavior of 5-HT neurons, and PKC activation was measured by the amount of 5-HT secreted. 5-HT secretion was measured using a comparison between 5-HT concentrations in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and platelet-poor plasma (PPP): if PKC was inactivated and the treated platelets retained 5-HT, then PRP had a greater amount of 5-HT then PPP, if PKC was activated and 5-HT was secreted, then PRP and PPP had similar 5-HT concentrations. This study, using this model, indicates that platelets retain 5-HT when unclotted and release 5-HT when aggregated, thereby verifying the model appropriate for measuring platelet 5-HT secretion. This model also indicates that phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) induces platelet 5-HT secretion. Because aggregation of platelets and treatment with PMA have been correlated very strongly to PKC activation, this model is shown to be an accurate in-vitro model of PKC activation. This model suggests that parthenolide inhibits the PKC pathway, preventing 5-HT secretion; therefore PKC may be overactive in inflammatory diseases, certain cancers, and migraines, and drugs treating these diseases should target the PKC pathway.

THE EFFECT OF SOY ISOFLAVONES ON HUMAN DRUG METABOLIZING ENZYMES
Priyadarshani Sarkar
Henrico High School, Henrico, VA

Flavones present in grapefruit juice inhibit the hepatic drug metabolizing enzyme, cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Soy contains isoflavones, which are compounds that are structurally similar to flavones, and therefore may also inhibit CYP3A4. This may result in increased drug levels, leading to toxicity. In addition, this poses a problem because soy is consumed widely because of its health benefits. The purpose of this project was to determine the effect of varying amounts of the soy isoflavones on the CYP3A4. The hypothesis was that if the highest concentration of genistein and daidzein (isoflavones) was tested, then the inhibition of the CYP3A4 enzyme would be the greatest. An assay kit containing human recombinant enzyme was purchased commercially. The substrate used was chemically blocked fluorescein such that fluorescence would result only after being metabolized by CYP3A4. Genistein (0, 5, 25 and 50uM) and daidzein (0, 3, 10 and 30uM) were used. Enzyme, substrate and cofactors (NADP+) were added to a 96-well microplate and fluorescence results were recorded (n=3 repeated trials). The decrease in fluorescence with increased concentrations of the isoflavones and the change in the Vmax, with minimal changes in Km in the presence of genistein and daidzein, suggested a non-competitive inhibition. Genistein was more potent with 72% inhibition at the highest concentration. The results using recombinant enzyme need to be further validated in an intact liver system. Due to the potential of soy isoflavones to inhibit an important liver enzyme, FDA should release a cautionary statement against taking soy with medications.

PROBING GAP JUNCTION DYNAMICS IN CELLS
Ching Zhu
Academic Magnet High School, North Charleston, South Carolina, U.S.A

The gap junction (GJ) is an aggregate of intercellular channels that links the cytoplasm of neighboring cells and allows small molecules such as ions to pass between these cells. Within the mammalian heart, the distribution of connexin43 (Cx43)-containing gap junctions is essential to facilitating the coordinated spread of electrical activation throughout the cardiac muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) and allowing the heart to contract properly. Disruptions in GJ distribution patterns in the adult heart are thought to be linked directly to cardiac disease and arrhythmia. <br><br> Recently, the protein zonula-occludens-1 (ZO-1) has been suggested to have an important role in the organization of GJs between cardiomyocytes in development and disease. However, the underlying mechanism by which ZO-1 affects GJ organization remains undetermined. In this study, the interaction between Cx43 (the major cardiac GJ protein) and ZO-1 in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes and HeLa cells was inhibited by a peptide designed to disrupt the binding of Cx43 and ZO-1. Images of the Cx43 GJs and ZO-1 in treated and control cultures were collected by confocal microscopy and quantitatively analyzed. The resulting data indicate a significant increase in Cx43 aggregate size and a shift in Cx43 distribution to the cell membrane accompanying a decrease in Cx43-ZO-1 binding mediated by the peptide in both myocytes and HeLa cells. These results suggest that ZO-1 may be important in regulating the extent of Cx43 GJ aggregates and provide insight into the presently unknown role of ZO-1 interaction with gap junction sub-unit proteins. At present, we are validating the degree to which the inhibitory peptide causes decoupling of direct protein-protein interaction between Cx43 and ZO-1 at molecular level using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy. <br><br>

GENETIC AND GENOMIC ANALYSIS OF TOR1 SIGNALING IN INITIATION OF CELL QUIESCENCE
Lev Omelchenko
Stuyvesant High School, New York, NY

Cancer is a disease that is caused by a variety of mutations which causes the cell to bypass mechanisms for detecting and repairing damaged DNA. A major factor that contributes to cancer is angiogenesis – the ability for cells to make its own growth signals to recruit blood vessels to promote growth, and attack other parts of the body. Disruption of mTOR, a central regulator of cell growth leads to tumor formation and angiogenesis. However, the specificity of the signals that are perceived by the mTOR-signaling pathway that leads to angiogenesis is poorly understood. This study examined the effects of nutrient starvation on the TOR1 pathway, the evolutionarily conserved protein kinase in yeast. Cell viability and gene expression of cells in which TOR1 has been deleted (knockout) were compared to wild type cells during the non-dividing phase of cell cycle. Results show that while cell viability of the knockout in carbon and phosphate nutrient limiting media is identical to that of the wildtype, cell viability of the knockout in nitrogen decreases rapidly. By studying global gene expression using DNA microarrays, it was found that failure of the knockout strain to induce genes normally activated under nitrogen starvation is the likely reason for cell death. This study shows that TOR1 is a specific sensor of nitrogen availability that regulates cell growth and quiescence in response to external environmental levels. These insights into TOR1 function suggest nitrogen sensing by cancer cells may play a role in mTOR's promotion of angiogenesis in human tumors.

USE OF TITANIUM DIOXIDE NANOPARTICLES AS A NOVEL, INEXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVE TO CURRENT THERAPIES FOR LEISHMANIA INFECTION
Brian Patrick Lei
Arlington High School, LaGrangeville, NY

Leishmaniasis, a disease prevalent in third-world countries, is caused by the parasite Leishmania. The parasite, which attacks the immune system’s defense cells, namely the macrophages, is developing resistance to current drugs. Currently, silver oxide nanoparticles are being investigated as a possible cure, but the metal poses obstacles due to cytotoxicity. I hypothesized that nanoparticles of titanium dioxide (TiO2) and zinc oxide (ZnO) may be effective as anti-leishmanial agents because they generate lethal free radicals and are well-known anti-bacterial agents and may be safer than silver. Free radical generation, which is partly responsible for the nanoparticles’ cytotoxic properties, was measured using D&C Red No. 28 dye degradation and DNA gel electrophoresis. It was found that ZnO was very toxic to even healthy cells at concentrations greater than 0.02 mg/mL and actually increased infectivity of Leishmania by about 50%. TiO2 was not toxic to uninfected cells at concentrations below 0.4 mg/mL. It increased infection rate, but significantly decreased the number of parasites alive per infected macrophage, showing that it prevented their proliferation once inside the cell. Additional testing was undertaken using Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, which are normally phagocytosed, to see if macrophage immune function was compromised by the TiO2 nanoparticles. Results showed that phagocytosis decreased by about 30% and the cells became more prone to bacterial infection. Gold nanoparticles, which are inert, were studied to determine how much of the effect of TiO2 nanoparticles on parasitic infection was due to free radical generation. This study demonstrated the feasibility of using TiO2 as a novel, inexpensive alternative to current therapies for Leishmania infection.

GLYCEMIC INDEX AND SOLUABLE STARCH IN FOODS
Mashkur Fahmi Husain
Northern High School, 9026 Woodward, Detroit, MI-48202

The current idea in medicine is that weight gain is influenced more by eating high-glycemic-index foods than by fat consumption or caloric intake. High-glycemic foods produce a quick rise in blood sugar after you eat them. They usually contain a lot of glucose or soluble, short-chain starch units that can be converted to glucose.<br><br>I want to determine whether or not cooking method influences the amount of soluble starches and glucose in the cooked food. I also want to see if there is a relationship between the glycemic index of starch foods and amount of soluble starch produced when cooking the food in the normal way.<br><br>My hypothesis: Cooking starchy foods causes a lot of glycemic substances to come out into the cooking water. This varies according to the types of foods. High glycemic foods should produce more soluble starch when cooked.<br><br>The procedure is to cook standard amounts of various foods until they are “done”. Then I pour off the cooking water and strain and filter out the particles. Next, I evaporate the water until the soluble starch can be recovered as a solid. I am comparing foods to see how the amount of soluble starch recovered compares to the glycemic index of the food. I am finding a correlation between the soluble starch released during cooking and glycemic index.<br><br>This has applications in planning a healthy diet. It would also be relevant for the food preparation and processing industry because they could eliminate soluble, high-glycemic substances by using the proper processing.<br><br>

THE ROLE OF APOCYNIN DERIVED COMPOUNDS IN CANCER TREATMENT
Zachary David Lauria
Burnt Hills-Ballston Lake Senior High, Burnt Hills, NY, United States

Two trademarks of tumors are their ability to metastasize to other sites in the body and divide uncontrollably. Pairing a migratory assay and an adhesion assay, I characterized the abilities of two apocynin derived compounds that are believed to inhibit migration at sub-lethal doses. It is hypothesized that Apocynin compounds interfere with Rac activation, which is recognized to play a role in the creation of Actin stress fibers which are integral in migration and adhesion. Actin was also observed, through a microscopy assay, inside treated and untreated cells in order to determine the amount of rearrangement or impedance of the Actin cytoskeleton. The goal of this research is to observe and pinpoint signaling pathways within cancer cells, specifically those dealing with cell proliferation. The ability to interfere with these signaling pathways utilizing these Apocynin compounds appears to be a useful advantage in the treatment of cancer.

EVOLUTION OF ASP-6 ASPARTYL PROTEASE IN NEMATODES
Daphne Ezer
Waksman Institute, Piscataway, NJ, USA

My research focused on mapping the evolution of an aspartyl protease gene cluster in three species of closely related roundworms: Caenorhabditis elegans, Caenorhabditis remanei, and Caenorhabditis briggsae. The goal of the study was to determine the order of duplication and inversion events that gave rise to the aspartyl protease gene cluster organization. Such events lead to multiple copies of a gene, or paralogs, which then evolve independently with time. By studying the differences in the present-day paralogs, it is possible to estimate the order of the events that generated them. Mapping the origin of gene families will help scientists identify the first genes to have developed in the earliest forms of life. <br><br> I compared the paralogs using public access multiple sequence alignment tools and used the output data to construct Neighbor Joining Trees representing similarities between genes. I compared the locations of splice sites in all paralogs in order to correct for possible error resulting from variable evolutionary rates.<br><br> I determined that the first gene underwent an inversion event. Then, each resulting paralog underwent an independent duplication event. These events happened prior to the divergence of the three species of roundworms. After the divergence of the three species, one of the aspartyl protease paralogs in C. elegans split into two separately transcribed genes.<br><br> Unlike most previous evolutionary studies, my work has integrated both comparative genomics techniques and splice site conservation analysis. My research demonstrates that such an approach would allow for the construction of more detailed evolutionary models. <br><br>

EFFECTS OF FLUORINATED ALCOHOLS ON LIPID BILAYERS
Mike Zhang
Bronx High School of Science, Bronx, NY

Fluorinated alcohols are unique alcohols that, while sharing a common overall structure with "normal" alcohols, have fluorines bonded to the carbons instead of the familiar hydrogens. The high electronegativity of fluorine shifts the charge distribution in the molecules, which changes their pK and together the larger bulk of fluorine relative to hydrogen alters their physico-chemical properties. Fluorinated alcohols are extensively used as organic solvents for solubilizing polymers and proteins especially in organic synthesis and NMR studies. In addition, the fluorinated form of 2-propanol (hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP)) is used in Alzheimer's disease research to solubilize the amyloid-beta peptide. The fluorinated alcohols modify the function of various membrane proteins and are known to interact with lipid bilayers, altering bilayer properties, structure and stability. Additionally, HFIP has been shown to increase the conductance of planar lipid bilayers. The question then becomes to what extent do the fluorinated alcohols alter bilayer properties and at what concentrations? The membrane-modifying potential of the fluorinated alcohols: trifluoroethanol (TFE), HFIP, and nonafluoro-tert-butyl alcohol (PFTB) was probed using a gramicidin-based fluorescence assay. All the fluorinated alcohols tested alter bilayer properties in the low (PFTB) to high (TFE) mM range. Not surprisingly, the largest alcohol, PFTB, is the most potent and the smallest, TFE, the least. In addition, above their bilayer modifying concentration PFTB and HFIP break down lipid bilayer structures and solubilize lipid vesicles.

TARGETING MITOCHONDRIAL TOPOISOMERASE I (TOP1MT) TO TRIGGER A NOVEL PATHWAY FOR ANTI-TUMOR DRUGS
Swetha Pasala
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Alexandria, VA

Mitochondrial Topoisomerase I (TOP1mt), known to relieve helical tension in DNA, has been suspected to be a part of the p53 apoptotic pathway triggered by etoposide, an anti-tumor drug. Indirectly, the drug is known to produce single or double DNA strand breaks within the mitochondria of the cell, through a series of interactions with the mitochondrion and the electron transport chain (ETC). The drug enters the mitochondrial membrane and binds to the complexes on the ETC -the prime location of respiration within the cell and inhibits the activity of complexes I and II within the chain. This causes the ETC to lose its efficiency and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are free radicals that result in DNA damage and lesions. The appearance of these lesions in mtDNA is known to trigger a cascade of proteins and result in apoptosis. It is known that a certain phosphorylation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) takes place as a result ROS generation, but the enzyme, which links these two processes, is unknown. This study shows that TOP1mt is a part of this pathway, phosphorylating the protein ataxia telangiectasia mutated and acting as the link between the damaged DNA and ATM phosphorylation. It was also found that higher levels of TOP1mt causes etoposide-treated cells to move towards apoptosis at a faster rate, thereby increasing the drug's anti-tumor efficiency.

THE DECOMPOSITION OF HYDROGEN PEROXIDE BY VARIOUS CATALYSTS AND ITS AFFECT ON AGING
Iman Mahoui
Eman Schools, Fishers, IN

Hydrogen Peroxide is constantly decomposing. The decomposition rate at room temperature is immeasurably small, but it can be significantly increased by the addition of a catalyst. The catalysts I used were the transition metals manganese dioxide, iron chloride and an enzyme called catalase. The human body creates its own natural hydrogen peroxide to kill of bacteria and other harmful microorganisms through a process called oxidative damage. However, this may lead to the formation of free radicals through a process called oxidative stress. Free radicals are harmful normal healthy cells as well. The catalase in the body will inhibit and neutralize the hydrogen peroxide and the free radicals rendering them harmless to the human body. According to the free radical theory of aging the formation of free radicals and the damage they cause to your body are what causes aging. The purpose of my experiment is to determine which substances most effectively catalyze the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, better understanding which substances most effectively neutralize the free radicals in our body. My hypothesis was that the transition metal, Iron (III) Chloride, will catalyze the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) the best. When I tested the reaction between hydrogen peroxide and the transition metals I observed that for the inorganic catalysts, the better catalyzer was the manganese dioxide for the organic catalysts the better catalyzer was the avocado extract as they both had the greatest increase in temperature, the shortest reaction time, and the largest amount of gas produced.

TESTING THE EFFECTS OF PEACILOMYCES LILACINUS AND FRENCH MARIGOLDS (TAGETES PATULA) TEA EXTRACT ON THE PECAN ROOT-KNOT NEMATODE (MELOIDOGYNE PARTITYLA).
Eric Ragnarson Malmquist
Westside High School, Macon, Georgia, United States

Since the year 2000 there has been a noticeable decline in nut production and general tree health in several commercial pecan orchards in Georgia. These trees were infested with the nematode Meloidogyne partityla. I added a tea made from French marigold roots (Tagetes patula) to infected Curtis pecan seedlings (Carya illinoensis) to see if M. partityla is affected by the natural toxin terthienyl produced by the marigolds. This process known as allelopathy is when plants emit natural toxins to keep other plants and/or animals away from them. I was able to add a test group using the fungus Peacilomyces lilacinus. This unique fungus discovered in 1999 gets its' nutrients by “attacking” the nematodes' egg masses. After the five additions of the tea/fungus, I took down the plants and gathered data. After calculating the average number of Meloidogyne partityla per gram of root mass, I was able to determine the effectiveness of the treatments on the tests groups. The 100% group (Group A) had the fewest nematodes (70.743), while the Peacilomyces lilacinus (Group Pl) was just as effective with an average of 76.037. Groups B (50%) and C (25%) had little effect on the nematodes. My hypothesis was proven, however more research would need to be done to determine the most economical methods of application in the field. At this time, due to the stunting effect of the marigold extract on the test seedlings, I see the Peacilomyces lilacinus as a more efficient way to treat commercial pecan orchards.

AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE FOLDING OF BETA STRUCTURES IN A CLASS OF PATHOLOGICALLY-RELEVANT PROTEINS: COMPUTATIONAL PREDICTION OF SECONDARY AND SUPER-SECONDARY STRUCTURE FROM PRIMARY AMINO ACID SEQUENCE
Nitish Lakhanpal
University High School, Irvine, CA

We present an algorithm for predicting beta structure in proteins from primary amino acid sequence. It has long been recognized that the diverse functions of proteins – be they in physiological or pathological roles – are closely related to the specific shapes that they adopt, and therefore great effort has been expended in the arduous task of experimentally determining protein structure. <br><br> In light of this experimental difficulty that is frequently extreme, there is wide interest in computationally predicting protein structure. It is to this endeavor that we contribute an algorithm that assigns beta structure to regions of submitted sequence based on their similarity to certain statistical properties of known beta structures: the “solo” distribution of amino acids, and the “duo” distribution of bonds between amino acids in interactions relatively common to beta structure. <br><br> We propose and implement an extension of the ‘propensity’ concept that effectively merges the single-amino-acid level of analysis with the possibility of long-distance interactions, combined with a Monte Carlo-like method for determining the optimum partitioning of the sequence into beta and non-beta segments, that compares favorably to existing algorithms created for the same purpose. In particular, our algorithm yields good results on two test sets of sequences related to pathologically-relevant proteins, the amyloids and the autotransporters. The optimization of certain parameters gives us deeper insight into the relative importance of various aspects of protein folding, and our method’s success on both sets indicates a general applicability.

BETA-AMYLOID PRECURSOR PROTEIN – 1: LINKING PROTEIN REPLACEMENT THERAPY AS TREATMENT FOR ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE AND MELANOMA – A 3 YEAR STUDY
Melanie Paige Kabinoff
Park Vista High School, Lake Worth, Florida, U.S.A

The purpose of this year’s study was to determine if over expressed Monocyte Chemotactic Protein-1/CCL2 found in Beta-Amyloid Precursor Protein – 1 were transferred from the C. elegans to Lumbricus terrestris, whose skin cells had been artificially aged to represent damaged cells found in humans suffering from Alzheimer’s Disease, would be a viable treatment of the disease as it did in last year’s treatment of Stage 2 and 3 melanoma.<br><br> The study involved exposing 135 Lumbricus terrestris to doses of UV-B radiation from a tungsten-halogen light (unfiltered) while another 135 Lumbricus terrestris were not exposed to act as a control. The Lumbricus terrestris skin cells were then analyzed to determine the damage caused by the exposure through a number of qualitative and quantitative tests. The researcher then proceeded to classify the Lumbricus terrestris in eighteen sub-groups based on exposure and treatment.<br><br> C. elegans were immersed in green/black tea extract in order for them to over express MCP-1/CCL2 found in Beta-APP-1. After various intervals the proteins produced by the C. elegans were removed by the use of a pneumatic press and separated through electrophoresis. The various sub-groups of Lumbricus terrestris were then treated with Beta-APP-1 through immersion and infusion. <br><br> After ten weeks of treatment the results were graphed and analyzed. The treatments provided conclusive results. The groups that were treated with the Beta-APP-1, through both immersion and infusion, showed various degrees of cells damage reversal along with improved stimulus/response reaction. These results were then forwarded to numerous organizations currently performing parallel studies.<br><br>

QUANTIFICATION OF INFLAMMATORY MARKERS CRP AND HA: INVESTIGATING IN VIVO INTERVERTEBRAL DISC REGENERATION WITH OP-1 FOLLOWING C-ABC CHEMONUCLEOLYSIS
Remi Paul Korenblit
Lincoln Park High School, Chicago, IL, USA

The purpose of this experiment is to determine the effect of injecting lactose, C-ABC, OP-1 and a combination of C-ABC and OP-1 into intervertebral disc of rabbits on the serum levels CRP and HA. The objective is to investigate the cartilage tissue’s metabolic responses in terms of inflammatory markers to a possible chemonucleolysis combination treatment of C-ABC and OP-1 for annular tear.<br><br>For a parent study, 24 rabbits in 4 groups had lactose (control), C-ABC, OP-1, and a combination of C-ABC and OP-1 injected into the nucleus pulposus of three intervertebral disc. Blood was drawn before the injection, at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after the injection. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays with antibodies specific to CRP and HA were performed on the blood samples. All procedures were done at Rush University Medical Center, under tutelage of Professor Thonar. Procedures involving direct work with the rabbits were performed by trained professionals.<br><br>Control rabbits injected with lactose had little change from baseline CRP and HA readings. C-ABC injections did not affect the CRP levels, though did increase HA serum levels, indicating local inflammation and tissue dissolution. OP-1 injections did not affect the CRP levels, though did initially increase the HA levels, followed by a decrease. The combination injection produced lower levels of HA than C-ABC alone indicating tissue repair, but had significant increases of CRP, suggesting systemic inflammatory response possibly hindering tissue repair. Results show combination treatment of C-ABC and OP-1 for annular tear effectively dissolves and regrows nucleus pulposus, but also uncovers potential negative complications.<br><br>

IDENTIFYING NICKEL-INDEPENDENT MUTANTS OF THE NICKEL-DEPENDENT REPRESSOR PROTEIN NIKR IN ESCHERICHIA COLI
Colin Lydon Park
Wentzville Holt High School, Wentzville, MO

The Escherichia coli nik operon is negatively regulated by the repressor protein NikR. NikR is a nickel-dependent protein that only inhibits nikABCDE synthesis when nickel is bound to the tetramer and then bound to the nik operator. In order to understand how NikR functions in the cell, researchers must determine how nickel binding affects the affinity for DNA binding. A nickel-independent mutant could possibly provide the answer. Site-directed mutagenesis of the E. coli gene, plasmid pNIK103, was used to change key conserved residues. NikR function was assayed using a nik promoter-lacZ fusion, plasmid pPC181. Mutants with unusually low lacZ activity such as Q75A and L86A were indicative of “gain-of-function mutations". The nickel dependence of the mutants was tested in a strain lacking a nickel transporter and found to still be nickel-dependent, although to varying degrees. The lacZ assay data suggests the Q75A and L86A mutations affect NikR function by different mechanisms.

THE NUTRITIONAL LOSS IN FOODS DUE TO NON-ENZYMATIC BROWNING
Joshua Jayme Nubla
East Syracuse-Minoa Central Highschool, East Syracuse, NY

In food processing, the organoleptic properties (taste, texture, appearance) and nutritional value of food product are essential quality parameters. One undesirable change that occurs in foods is a browning phenomenon, which diminishes the overall quality of the food product. Browning can occur via an enzyme-catalyzed mechanism involving polyphenol oxidase (PPO) that oxidizes polyphenolic compounds into brown-colored pigments, or via non-enzymatic pathways, as in caramelization and the Maillard ("sugar-amine") Reaction. Maillard browning occurs when a reducing agent and an amine group react leading to a cascade of reactions that result in a brown color and volatile compounds of a 'cooked' flavor. In most food matrices, the reaction occurs between a reducing sugar and a protein.<br><br> In order to investigate the Maillard reaction, a series of amino acids were combined with sugars and the degree of browning was quantified using a spectrophotometer, under varying conditions, i.e. by manipulating the pH, concentration, residence time, and reaction temperature. To demonstrate browning control, a formulation for vanilla fudge was modified by reducing milk from 375 mL to 250 mL of milk. With reduced concentration and cooking time, the new recipe resulted in minimal browning. Additional formulations were investigated to determine the significance of the Maillard Reaction in confectionery applications. Knowing the processes involved in the Maillard Reaction and the properties that depend on it, it is possible to control the amount of browning in select foods. By manipulating the speed of the Maillard Reaction it is possible to manage both flavor and nutritional value.

A FASTER RUBISCO FOR CARBON SEQUESTRATION
Justin Krish Williams
Henry W Grady High School, Atlanta, GA

Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (RuBisCO) is a highly abundant and well-characterized enzyme that catalyzes the first step of the Calvin Cycle. Using magnesium [Mg(II)] as a cofactor, RuBisCO ‘fixes’ carbon dioxide (CO2) by covalently linking it to the 5-carbon sugar, Ribulose Bisphosphate, which decomposes to produce two smaller 3-carbon sugars. RuBisCO has the potential to be used to sequester CO2, and to combat global warming. However, RuBisCO is known as a 'slothful' enzyme because of its inefficiency (low kcat/Km). I propose that RuBisCO can be made more efficient by using conditions similar to those in which it first evolved. Early earth had an abundance of soluble Fe(II), a reduced form of iron, a lack of oxygen and very little available Mg(II). While Fe(II) is soluble in water, Fe(III) is not. After about 1.5 billion years of life, ‘the great oxidation’ slowly removed soluble Fe(II) from the biosphere depositing it in ‘Banded Iron Formations’ as insoluble Fe(III). I measured RuBisCO activity in the presence of oxygen and Mg(II) and in the absence of oxygen and presence of Fe(II). There is precedence in the literature for increasing enzymatic activity by switching Mg(II) to Fe(II). I used both thin-layer chromatography as well as a spectroscopic method for measuring RuBisCO activity, as well mass spectrometry to quantitate products. After analyzing the structure and age of RuBisCO, I propose that its ‘slothful’ nature may be due to its unsuitability to working with Mg(II) and thus may be a possible candidate for increased activity with Fe(II) ion.

THE ROLE OF JAGGED1 IN NEUROGENESIS WITHIN THE MAMMALIAN OLFACTORY EPITHELIUM
Zena Maria Cardman
Bruton High School, Williamsburg, Virginia, USA

Using the olfactory epithelium of E14 Mus musculus as a model, this research explored the role of Jagged1, a potential ligand for the Notch receptor protein, in activation of the Notch pathway, which serves to inhibit neural cell differentiation. This was carried out most effectively using RNA in situ hybridization techniques. The most distinct neurogenic phenotypes were observed with RNA probes marking expression of neural cells. An average 140% increase of all apically misexpressed neural cells per section (marked by SCG10) was observed in the mutant, while a noteworthy increase in expressed odorant receptors (60% for the SR1 probe and 25% for P3) was also observed. Interestingly, OR78 – expressed in zone 1 of the olfactory epithelium, where Jagged1 expression is also differentially expressed – exhibited not only an increased expression in the mutant, but also misexpression in zone 1 through to zone 4. Preliminary TUNEL staining also showed a sizable increase in mutant cell death. This experiment provides the first in vivo evidence that Jagged1 plays a role in inhibiting neural cell differentiation and is a ligand for the receptor Notch2. Additionally, an unexpected expression pattern suggests that Jagged1 may play a more fundamental role in the organizational process of neurogenesis. Since the Notch Pathway is present in all metazoans, is connected to many processes – including development, stem cell maintenance, and memory – and has been linked with such conditions as Alzheimer’s Disease, schizophrenia, and Alagille Syndrome, research into associated Notch genes has boundless applications.

THE EFFECT OF ETHANOL CONCENTRATION ON AN ADH-CATALYZED REACTION
Joanne Livaditis
Dallastown Area High School, Dallastown, PA

The oxidation of ethanol as catalyzed by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) was studied. This reaction is a critical step in the human body’s process of metabolism: ethanol and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) yield acetaldehyde, NADH, and H+. This experiment determined the amount of time the reaction takes depending on various ethanol concentrations. It was hypothesized that the rate of the reaction will increase as the ethanol concentration is increased and then reach a plateau where it no longer increases as the ethanol concentration increases. <br><br> The reaction was coupled with another reaction involving phenazine methosulfate, dichloroindophenol, and NAD+ that emitted wavelengths in the visible light spectrum so the ethanol oxidation could be monitored using a spectrophotometer. Zero Order, First Order, and Michaelis-Menten kinetics were used in the analysis of the data. The results supported the hypothesis; ethanol concentrations of 0.016 M, 0.033 M, 0.067 M, 0.1 M, and 0.3 M were tested, and the reaction rate decreased as the concentrations increased. The reaction rate plateaued after approximately 3.11 minutes at 0.4 M ethanol. Multiple trials and a 95% confidence interval validated the results. <br><br> Variables such as light, oxygen, pH of the enzyme and solutions, and temperature at which the experiment was performed could have affected the results. In future investigations, performing the experiment in complete darkness and at the pH of the human body (7.35 to 7.45) would better simulate actual body conditions. By limiting these variables, one can measure their effect on the rate of ethanol consumption and equate the results to the process that occurs in the human body during metabolism.

This was the control baseline. <br><br> APAL1 cut the DNA into large similar size segments making measurement impossible. A second trial with HINDIII produced smaller varied segments allowing measurement. <br><br>A 10 kilo base DNA ladder confirmed digestion of the Lambda DNA. <br><br> Acrylamide inoculation levels started at .0005 mg/ml. Samples incubated at 37 degrees C for 3 to 30 hours simulating acrylamide contact with digestive system DNA.<br><br> Analysis revealed the most highly treated bands of Lambda DNA (compared to control) moved closer to the positive terminal. The human DNA was greatly fragmented and pulled through and off the gel. <br><br> Acrylamide caused significant DNA damage. Also, simpler bacteria DNA was less fragmented than human DNA. <br><br> Since slight somatic mutations cause disease, ingestion of acrylamide creates risk. High levels of acrylamide cause DNA damage.

EXPRESSION AND LOCALIZATION OF 3BETA-HYDROXYSTEROID DEHYDROGENASE-1 IN HUMAN BREAST CANCER CELLS
Madhuchanda Bose
Eastside High School, Gainesville, FL

This project studied the expression and localization of 3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1(3bHSD1)protein and the associated protein complexes in human breast cancer(MCF-7)cells. The 3bHSD1 protein was over expressed in MCF-7 cells and was at least tenfold greater in transfected cells than non-transfected cells, with nearly no expression of 3bHSD1 protein in the monkey kidney (COS-1)cells.<br><br> Protein expression was tested in the MCF-7 and COS-1 cells using Western blotting, after transfection of MCF-7 and COS-1 cells with plasmid DNA isolated from E.coli competent cells transformed with 3bHSD1 cDNA subcloned in pCMV vector. The finding that 3bHSD1 was over expressed in transfected MCF-7 cells, more so than nontransfected MCF-7 cells, and minimally expressed in transfected and non-transfected COS-1 cells led to the localization of 3bHSD1 protein in mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), by incubation of radioactive translated 3bHSD1 protein with mitochondria and ER isolated from pig adrenal glands, and testing of import by tracing radioactive protein. It was found that the protein was imported into and associated with both mitochondria and ER. Mitochondria and ER were then isolated from MCF-7 cells, by differential centrifugation, and 3bHSD1 associated protein complexes were identified by probing PVDF membrane, with protein transferred from Native-PAGE gel, with 3bHSD1 primary and secondary antibodies. Mass spectrometry was used to identify the associated protein complexes found, by matching the peaks generated to those protein peaks documented in the Matrix Science (UK) database. Inhibiting any of the proteins in the complexes found could inhibit overexpression of 3bHSD1 and oversynthesis of progesterone in breast cancer cells, stopping tumor growth.

ZINC FINGER OF HDNMT1 IS ESSENTIAL FOR ENZYMATIC ACTIVITY AND PARTICIPATES IN TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPRESSION
Mihika Pradhan
Hamilton-Wenham Regional High School, South Hamilton, MA, U.S.A. 

DNA methylation is an enzymatic chemical modification of human genome. Human DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferase 1 (hDNMT1) attaches methyl groups to cytosine residues on control segments of genes, in the newly synthesized daughter strands during cell division. Therefore, a normal gene veers off its intended course of activity. In cancer cells, DNMT1 aberrantly hypermethylates the tumor suppressor genes and silences them. Inhibitors of DNMT1 have been successful in reactivating the silenced genes in cancer treatment, but have serious side effects.<br><br> Here, the zinc finger domain was identified (ZnF) of hDNMT1 as the crucial element required for unmethylated DNA binding in vitro. Mutation/(s) of the cysteine residues in the ZnF abolished its DNA binding function. Mutant enzymes retained localization on the replication sites and nuclear DNA, when expressed by mammalian cells. However, the amount of mutant enzymes on the newly synthesized DNA decreased, suggesting impairment of DNA methylation. Mutant enzymes also displayed reduced activity in vitro as compared to the wild type, confirming that the ZnF domain is crucial for activity. The Survivin oncogene was transcriptionally repressed by the wild type enzyme and to a lesser extent with mutant enzyme, possibly due to poor enzyme-DNA interactions.<br><br> In summary, the significance of the ZnF of hDNMT1 was demonstrated in enzymatic activity, and a new method of DNMT1 inhibition is proposed via ZnF-binding small unmethylated DNA molecules in cancer therapy. <br><br>

MEDICINAL PROFILING OF COLLETOTRICHUM BONINENSE, A FUNGAL ENDOPHYTE DERIVED FROM CLERMONTIA PARVIFLORA, AN ENDEMIC HAWAIIAN PLANT
Shalila Shek de Bourmont
Hilo High School, Hilo, HI

Endophytic fungi, organisms residing within plants, have recently been considered as a possible new source of pharmaceuticals. In fact, anti-cancer and antimicrobial properties originally attributed to medicinally active host plants may actually originate in the fungal endophytes. <br><br><br>In a previous study, Clermontia parviflora (an endemic native Hawaiian plant) was found to harbor two endophyte species exhibiting anti-cancer activity. One of them, Colletotrichum boninense, is the subject of the present study. Methanol, hexane, butanol, and ethyl acetate extracts were obtained and tested for antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity. The mycelium-derived methanol extract was further separated through MPLC and TLC into three pure compounds, two of which exhibited mild antimicrobial activity against both S. aureus and E. coli. The butanol extract showed activity against E. coli comparable to that of the positive control nitrofurantoine. Both butanol and hexane extracts exhibited antimicrobial activity against S. aureus. No extracts showed cytotoxic activity toward LnCap prostate cancer cells. Cytotoxicity towards LU-1 lung cancer cells was very reduced in all extracts suggesting that cytotoxicity is a trait highly dependent on the environment and, due to disuse, the trait seems to be diluted and almost absent throughout subsequent generations. Further studies are needed to fully understand C. boninense’s medicinal properties.

ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES OF C. LONGA: A STUDY AND COMPARISON
Archana Vamanrao
Hopkinton High School, Hopkinton, Massachusetts, United States

The purpose of this project was to compare the antioxidant ability of turmeric to other spices (oregano, cinnamon, and clove). An effective antioxidant spice would lend itself to use as a natural preservative, especially in foods containing lipids (as these antioxidants would help prevent lipid peroxidation and increase shelf life of foods). <br><br>The oxidation levels of an oil sample over time were found using a Petri dish system in which boiled linseed oil (containing varying amounts of the spices tested) was allowed to oxidize and release volatiles. These volatiles then reacted with un-polymerized amines on a polyamide TLC plate, causing it to fluoresce under an ultra-violet light. A higher intensity of fluorescence represented a more oxidized oil. The results were graphed and linear regression best fit lines were found to model the sample’s oxidation over time. Effectiveness as an antioxidant was determined by comparing the oxidation rate for a sample treated with a certain concentration of a spice to that of an untreated sample (the control). T-tests performed on the data showed there was a significant decrease in oxidation rate as concentration of turmeric in the boiled linseed oil increased, suggesting that turmeric is an effective antioxidant. The data suggested that turmeric was more effective in inhibiting the oxidation of the oil than cinnamon and oregano (p < 0.01 for both) but that clove was significantly more effective than turmeric (p < 0.02). <br><br>

DOES 2-DEOXY-D-GLUCOSE KILL MULTIPLE MYELOMA CELLS BY INHIBITING GLYCOLYSIS OR GLYCOSYLATION?
Martin Joseph Gutman
Dr. Michael M. Krop Senior High School, Miami, FL

Multiple Myeloma (MM), an essentially incurable hematologic malignancy, is one of the most prevalent in America and stems from terminally differentiated plasma cells. Bortezomib, a selective inhibitor of the 26S proteasome, effectively kills MM cells and has also been approved for the healing of refractory relapse disease. Proteins in MM cells naturally misfold and in order to maintain survival, they undergo a phenomenon known as the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), regulated by proteasomes. UPR is activated for survival but under prolonged stress kills cells through Endoplasmic Reticulum(ER) stress-induced apoptosis. Another strategy inducing ER stress is to inhibit the glycosylation of proteins. Glycosylation can be inhibited with 2-Deoxyglucose (2-DG), and similarly to glucose, is easily up taken by tumors to inhibit glycolysis or glycosylation. Glycolysis is one main source of cellular energy in tumors. Therefore we determined if MM cells could be treated with 2-DG and if so how they died. MM1.s cells were not sensitive to 2-DG alone while 8226 cells died when 2-DG was added. To determine if this was due to glycolysis the experiment was done under conditions of low oxygen (hypoxia) where cells must use glycolysis to survive. Under these conditions both cell types died when 2-DG was added. Therefore both cells use glycolysis when under anaerobic conditions. However the 8226 died equally whether oxygen was present or not so we checked if 2-DG altered glycosylation by looking for a marker of the UPR. When treated with 2-DG these cell lines did not express one of the first genes associated with the UPR (ATF3). Because UPR genes were not expressed, it was concluded that the inhibition of glycolysis by 2-DG was responsible for cell death.

STUDYING THE NUCLEOSOME ASSEMBLY PROTEIN: IS THE C-DOMAIN RESPONSIBLE FOR HISTONE INTERACTION?
Aleksandr Gorin
Children's Creative and Performing Arts Academy, San Diego, CA, United States

The NAP1 protein is the protein that assembles nucleosomes and organizes DNA inside the nucleus of cells. The aim of this experiment is to determine whether the GST-Y10 protein has the ability to bind histones. The experiment will consist of two major steps; creating the GST-Y10 protein and a pull down assay using the produced protein and histones.<br><br>The Y10 protein is a fragment of the NAP1 protein that codes for the C-Domain. The C-domain is believed to do most of the work that the protein carries out with respect to histone binding. This Y10 protein is obtained from yeast cells, whose NAP1 protein is very similar to that of humans.<br><br>The GST-Y10 protein is made by binding the Y10 and GST protein together. This is done using common DNA restriction enzyme digests and ligations. Once the correct DNA plasmid is created it will be grown up inside E Coli bacteria and the protein will be expressed.<br><br>After the protein is created a test will be run to see if it interacts with histones. The test will be a pull down assay. The results of the pull down assay will show whether the GST-Y10 protein can interact with histones and give the final answer to the experiment.<br><br>The results of this experiment showed that the histones do interact with the GST-Y10 protein. <br><br>

WHICH BEVERAGES WILL PROVIDE HIGH LEVELS OF ANTIOXIDANTS?
Asanka Thimothy Nanayakkara
Oxford High School, Oxford, MS 38655 USA

This experiment was performed to compare the antioxidant activity of different beverages. Most people around the world drink either tea or coffee daily. Currently, more people are drinking tea than ten years ago due to health benefits. Tea is commonly known to contain antioxidants. <br><br>Since all teas except herbal teas come from the same plant, Camellia sinensis, varying only by way of processing, the amount of antioxidants in the tea should vary according to the way the tea is processed and prepared by the manufacturer. Antioxidant activity may also vary according to the region in which the tea is grown. The same should be true of coffee. Some herbal teas such as chamomile tea come from the flowers of the chamomile plant. <br><br>Several varieties of tea and two different kinds of coffee were prepared as suggested by the manufacturer, and their antioxidant activity was compared. These beverages were of different flavors and forms, and the manufacturers processed them in different ways. <br><br>In this project, the amount of antioxidants in these beverages was evaluated by titration with DPPH, a stable free radical. The number of constituents that have antioxidant activity was also determined by the TLC method as well as the HPLC method. From this experiment, it was found that green-white tea contained the most antioxidants and that coffee contains more antioxidants than pekoe teas. The decaffeinated beverages had fewer antioxidants than the caffeinated beverages. The manner of preparation also had an effect on the amount of antioxidants in the tea. <br><br><br> <br><br>

USING ZEBRAFISH AS A MODEL TO IDENTIFY THE CAUSES OF MECHANOSENSORY HAIR CELL DEATH AND HEARING LOSS IN HUMANS
Meghal Sheth
Camas High School, Camas, WA

According to the World Health Organization, over 275 million people in the world suffer from deafness and other hearing impairments. It affects people of all ages, ranging from newborns to the elderly. Hearing loss is often caused by the loss of hair cells, which are mechanosensory cells that transform sound stimuli and transfer it to the brain via auditory nerve. The human body produces about 15,000 cells and once lost, hair cells cannot be replaced. 90% of all cases of senso-neural hearing loss are caused by damage to these hair cells. The loss of hair cells can be caused by certain types of aminoglycoside antibiotics, environmental toxins, aging, and prolonged noise exposure. In order to actually visualize the viability of these hair cells, researchers use Zebrafish as a model to label and study the toxicity of certain chemicals and medications in vivo. The lateral line along the body of the embryonic tissue contains hair cell bearing organs called neuromasts that serve as an accurate way to identify the affected hair cells in an experiment. In my research, I have tested for the ototoxic effects of Bisphenol A, a common monomer used in the production of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins, and have compared these results with a common aminoglycoside antibiotic, neomycin, on 10 neuromasts along the embryonic head tissue. I have concluded that acute exposure to Bisphenol A has some effect on hair cell death, however, 24 hours and chronic exposure along with slightly higher concentrations of Bisphenol A do have measurable ototoxic effects that may lead to hearing loss in humans.

IMAGING THE APOPTOTIC EFFECT OF TUNICAMYCIN IN MDA-MB-231 HUMAN BREAST CANCER CELLS LINE
Karla Patricia Ramos
University Gardens High School, San Juan, PUERTO RICO

Breast cancer is a most common cancer among women. There are different types of breast cancer and the most aggressive one is known as triple negative (HER2/ER/PR). MDA-MB-231 is a triple negative human breast cancer cell line. Tunicamycin is a glucosamine-containing pyrimidine nucleoside and in antibiotic that competitively inhibits N-linked protein glycosylation and breast tumor angiogenesis by inducing apoptosis. This investigation proposes to identify if Tunicamycin would induce apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. To verify the hypothesis MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in two separate culturing flasks. One flask was the experimental group which was treated with Tunicamycin. The second flask was the control group and was not treated. Both groups of cells were then stained with Hoechst dye, and observed under a fluorescence microscope to determine the status of the cell nucleus. Image evaluation confirmed that the hypothesis was correct. Image from Tunicamycin treated breast cancer cells showed apoptotic characteristics which include, a fragmented nucleus and condensed chromatin. Control cells remained unaltered. These results suggested that Tunicamycin induces apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell lines. This is most likely due to a quantitative inhibition of the Lipid-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis and increasing the endoplasmic reticulum stress. As a result, the glycoprotein including growth factor receptor can’t conform itself correctly and activates unfolded protein response mediated apoptosis. In conclusion, the treatment with Tunicamycin in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells caused cellular death through apoptosis. Future investigation will target specific pathways to understand the mechanism of Tunicamycin-induced breast cancer cell death.

ENDOGENOUS ESTROGEN AMPLIFICATION THROUGH INTERACTION WITH P450 ENZYMES: NOVEL MECHANISMS FOR XENOESTROGENICITY
Lalit Ramesh Patel, California Academy of Mathematics and Science
Carson, California, United States of America

For five decades, considerable data has supported claims that human reproductive health has deteriorated with the environment. Such findings support reports characterizing xenobiotic chemicals and persistent pollutants as endocrine disruptors and endocrine disruption sources in environmental samples and the endocrine disruption hypothesis, a claim that exposure to environmental xenoestrogens degrades human and wildlife health.<br><br> The endocrine disruption hypothesis’s molecular model serves as a basis for this study. The model currently limits means of disruption to xenoestrogens’ receptor agonistic behavior, causing disparities between unreasonably low theoretical xenoestrogen potencies and their observed estrogenic capacities. This study attempts to incorporate a novel mechanism of xenoestrogenicity through endogenous estrogen amplification caused by potent unmetabolized natural estrogens accumulating within an organism into the molecular model and tests the possibility of substration and inhibition of estrogen-metabolizing enzyme CYP1A as a means of such amplification.<br><br> Using DDT and DDE as xenoestrogens, enzyme substration kinetic assays and carbon monoxide binding difference spectra were used to determine the extent, mode, and reversibility of xenoestrogens’ inhibition of CYP1A. Kinetic assays show that DDT and DDE competitively inhibit CYP1A’s catalytic activity at high and low concentrations. Difference spectra show that such substration is irreversible and permanently denatures the CYP1A enzyme. Endogenous estrogen amplification by xenoestrogens through metabolic enzyme substration is thereby shown as a viable mechanism for their disruptive behavior. Without verifying the significance of CYP1A substration as an endogenous estrogen amplification pathway, however, the study is unable to expand the molecular model. Accordingly, further experimentation is necessary.<br><br>

PROLIFERATION AND DIFFERENTIATION OF ADULT RAT BONE MARROW STEM CELLS WHEN CO-CULTURED WITH RAT HEPATOCYTES
Joanne Ming-Li Ho
Raffles Junior College, Singapore

With the development of liver tissue engineering to treat acute liver failure, the process of deriving hepatocytes is becoming more important. The differentiation of mesenchymal bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) can serve as a source for hepatocytes in the future. However, the mechanism remains unclear. In this project, the aim was to determine if differentiation was induced by some soluble factors secreted by the hepatocytes, or whether it was direct cell-cell contact that stimulated the differentiation. BMSCs were induced to proliferate and differentiate by co-culturing them with hepatocytes, some with direct contact between the two groups of cells and others without any form of direct contact. This was achieved via the creation of partially supported or fully supported collagen-coated cover slips, which were seeded with BMSCs, and then placed over a hepatocyte monolayer. The degree of differentiation was determined by the extent of phenotypic and functional changes. In particular, the degree of differentiation was shown via the P450 cytochrome oxidase enzyme activity assay. It was found that the BMSCs in both types of co-culture set-ups successfully differentiated into hepatocytes. Since the BMSCs seeded onto the fully supported cover slips, which did not allow any form of direct cell-cell contact, had differentiated into hepatocytes, it implies that the causative agent that had induced differentiation was some soluble factor secreted by hepatocytes. Direct cell-cell contact is not a pre-requisite for the differentiation of BMSCs into hepatocytes to occur. This has significant applications in liver tissue engineering and treatments for liver failure, as well as potential widespread applications in the studies of the differentiation mechanisms of progenitor cells.

GASTRO MICROBIAL FUEL CELL: A NOVEL IMPLEMENTATION OF A GMFC IN CAPSULAR NANOROBOTICS
Raja Selvakumar
Milton High School, Milton, GA

This project is based on the integration of capsular nanobots into in vivo models. The purpose of this project is to find alternative power sources to use in such bots. Current lithium-ion technology in these robots limits optimum functionality. Possible applications of this robots in human models include the treatment of Crohn's and Menetrier's disease, so implementation is key to a better future. The novel use of a microbial fuel cell to replace current battery technology is tested in this experiment. The hypothesis is that if this gastro microbial fuel call can produce a consistent voltage of 400 mV, then it can be used in capsular nano robots in the near future.<br><br>Experimentation was completed in three essential steps. First the anode assembly was created using a carbon pad and cloth design. Then the cathode was assembled using similar materials but also incorporating Styrofoam as the GDL to diffuse oxygen. Finally, the electrolyte consisting of HCl, KCl, NaCl, and natural yogurt was added to the container. The chlorides simulate the actual stomach acid composition while the yogurt harbors microbial growth. <br><br>The data was collected over a 11 day period and the results were promising. A consistent trend of voltage readings greater than 400 mV was observed, thus proving the hypothesis. As 3/8 of all American diseases are gastrointestinal, the GMFC can be implemented in capsular nanorobotics, and power in vivo for nano robotic devices used in surgical and therapeutic devices that would be superior to current battery options.

THE REGULATION OF LENGTH-DEPENDENT MYOSIN LIGHT CHAIN PHOSPHORYLATION IN BLADDER SMOOTH MUSCLE
Alec Kaipo Takeshi Matsumoto
Kamehameha Schools Kapalama High School, Honolulu, HI

This investigation examined myosin light chain phosphorylation and the pathways involved in its regulation in response to changes in rabbit bladder smooth muscle tissue length. It was hypothesized that as the length of the bladder smooth muscle increased, there would be a general pattern of increased myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation as well as an increase in Thr850 myosin phosphatase target (MYPT) subunit phosphorylation levels. Bladder smooth muscle strips were stretched to various lengths ranging from slack (no passive force) to 1.5Lo (1.5 times optimal length). Protein lysates from these tissues were used to measure phosphorylation levels of Ser19 MLC and Thr850 MYPT by Western blot. The results suggest that an increase in tissue length from slack to 1.5 Lo causes a decrease in Ser19 MLC phosphorylation while causing an increase in Thr850 MYPT phosphorylation. This suggests that there is an alternative mechanism that decreases MLC phosphorylation as length increases, and that this pathway has a stronger effect in the regulation of MLC phosphorylation than the effect of Thr850 MYPT phosphorylation.

ROLE OF INTEGRIN-LINKED KINASE SIGNALING IN VASCULAR SMOOTH MUSCLE CELL MIGRATION
Mark Anthony Menn
Murphy High School, Mobile, Alabama, USA

Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration in response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a key event in several vascular pathologies including atherosclerosis and restenosis. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) has been identified as a key regulator of migration associated with cancer, but its role in the vasculature is undefined. It was hypothesized that ILK is a key regulator of VSMC migration. To verify the model system, experimentation confirmed that VSMCs migrated in a dose-dependent fashion following PDGF stimulation. Transfection of VSMCs with siRNA to decrease the expression of ILK allowed for analysis of ILK associated pathways. Decreasing ILK levels caused a reduction in VSMCs migration; thus implicating ILK as a mediator of PDGF-induced VSMC migration. Akt is a known target of ILK, and these studies indicated that lowering ILK expression reduced Akt activation assessed by phosphorylation of Akt on ser473. A chemical inhibitor of Akt dose-dependently blocked PDGF-induced migration confirming that Akt is a downstream regulator of VSMC migration. For full activation of Akt is phosphorylated at two residues. 3-phosphoinositide dependent kinase (PDK1) is a well known regulator of Akt phosphorylation at threonine 308. To test if PDK1 was also involved in PDGF-induced VSMC migration in the model, VSMCs were transfected with siRNA targeting PDK1. This treatment attenuated both PDGF-induced migration and phosphorylation of Akt thr308. Thus, PDK1 is another vital factor in PDGF-induced migration. Ultimately, these studies suggest that Akt may be a central mediator of PDGF-induced VSMC migration resulting from its activation by both ILK and PDK1.

DEVELOPING A PURIFICATION STRATEGY TO AID STRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE S1P1 RECEPTOR
Ryan Christopher Meingasner
Seminole Ridge Community High School, Loxahatchee, FL

The goal of this research project was to purify 3xFLAG tagged S1P1 receptor from a stable pool of HEK cells. A cell line that stably expressed the S1P1 receptor was in place in the mentor’s lab. Purification protocols which used detergents compatible with HDXMS were tested to ensure both that the receptor yield was adequate and that the compatible purification strategies were as effective as standard strategies.<br><br>After cells were lysed, they were washed across M2 affinity beads to wash off unwanted cellular proteins. The sample was filtered in a molecular weight cutoff filter to ensure particle size was under 10kDA. The flag peptides used in the receptor elution step were removed from the protein solution. At this point the sample was introduced to a mass spectrometer to assess the sequence coverage of the protein.<br><br>The sequence coverage was too low for HDXMS, but it was believed that this was due to the high concentration of detergent and low concentration of receptor used in the purification strategy. To test this, detergents were separated on a gel and bands associated with the S1P1 receptor were cut out. Peptides digested from these bands were analyzed by mass spectrometry to assess sequence coverage. In conclusion, purification of the S1P1 receptor was confirmed using Western analysis, and further optimization of the purification strategy is underway to move forward with HDXMS studies.<br><br>The potential of this project will allow researchers to test the efficacy of potential drugs which would be used to treat multiple sclerosis.

CHEMICAL COMPARISON OF THE CHEIRANTHUS CHEIRI PLANT WITH COMMERCIAL PESTICIDES
Lester J Rosario
Jose Rojas Cortes High School, Orocovis, PUERTO RICO

The problem under study in this research was: Are the leaves’ extract of Cheiranthus cheiri plant chemically similar to a commercial pesticide? The hypothesis was: The leaves’ extract of Cheiranthus cheiri plant are chemically similar to a commercial pesticide with insecticide and fungicide functions. To test the hypothesis, the following procedure was carried out: The leaf of the Cheiranthus cheiri plant was weighed with a cent-o-gram balance. This leaf was macerated, and 5 mL of distilled water were added to obtain an extract. Afterwards, a drop of this extract was placed in the prism of the ATR. A transmittance reading of the spectrophotometric infrared area was done with a plain background. Four commercial pesticides were labeled, according to their uses, as follows: “Insecticide”, “Insecticide and Fungicide”, “Insecticide and Bactericide”, and “Fungicide, Insecticide and Miticide”. A drop of each of the pesticides was obtained from each recipient. The same spectrophotometric reading mentioned above was also done to these samples of pesticides. Using the computer, each of the pesticides’ spectrums was superimposed to the Cheiranthus cheiri’s extract spectrum to compare the equivalent absorptions of functional groups. All this procedure was done two times. In conclusion, the hypothesis was accepted. It was noticed that the plant’s extract spectrum had approximately the same functional groups of the pesticide labeled as: “Insecticide and Fungicide”.

IDENTIFICATION OF CONSERVED PLATELET-ACTIVATING FACTOR BINDING SITES BY MUTAGENESIS
Emily Clegg
Bountiful High School, Bountiful, Utah, United States of America

Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a naturally occurring phospholipid, that promotes inflammation. Two proteins that bind and deactivate PAF are plasma PAF acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) and intracellular PAF acetylhydrolase. PAF receptor is a membrane protein responsible for binding PAF and then mediating intracellular communication. These three proteins share a very specific homologous four amino-acid sequence. This project investigated that conserved domain as a possible binding site for PAF. <br><br> To study the conserved region, mutant species of plasma PAF-AH were generated and relative PAF binding affinity determined. Six mutants were produced by polymerase chain reaction using a cDNA template. Mutation sites included each amino acid in the conserved site, plus the preceding and following amino acids. The mutant DNA was ligated to vector pcDNA 3.1- and transformed into competent bacterial cells. Following colonization, plasmids were obtained, identified, and transfected into mammalian cells. The protein produced by the transfectants was assessed for total concentration, mutant quantity, and binding affinity. <br><br> Results demonstrated that transfected cells produced the desired protein. Specific activity of PAF binding and inhibition curves revealed one mutant (serine 319) to have a greater affinity for binding PAF than the wild type PAF-AH. In competition reactions, remaining mutants were shown to be incapable of binding PAF.<br><br> This project determined that the conserved site is important in PAF binding. Further study of the characteristics of PAF and PAF-associated proteins may lead to better understanding of the genesis and control of inflammation.<br><br>

CLASSIFYING MALONIC ACID AS A COMPETITIVE OR NON-COMPETITIVE INHIBITOR THROUGH ISOLATION OF THE SIXTH STEP OF THE KREBS CYCLE
Christian Johann Camargo
Homer Hanna High School, Brownsville, TX, USA

This experiment is classifying malonic acid as a competitive or non-competitive inhibitor in the oxidation of succinic acid to fumaric acid by catalyzation by succinic dehydrogenase. In knowing that succinate to fumarate, a step of the Citric Acid cycle, is coupled to FAD -> FADH2, this experiment was set up. Methylene Blue was used as an indicator. In this project, by isolating the reaction of succinic acid to fumaric acid through catalyzaion by succinic dehydrogenase, and introduction of enzyme inhibitor malonic acid all in a test tube, malonic acid can be classified as competitive or non-competitive by the reaction (or lack thereof) caused in the test tube at varying concentrations of the various components. If all ingredients needed for a visible reaction, succinic acid, succinic dehydrogenase (in from of extract from mitochondria of a calf heart), water, and methylene blue are included in a tube, we can compare this reaction to a tube where the inhibitor is introduced. If when the inhibitor is introduced a change in the concentration of the substrate, succinic acid, causes a reaction where otherwise there was none, malonic acid is a competitive inhibitor. If no reaction takes place no matter the level of succinic acid, it is non-competitive.

MODELING THE EFFECT OF INTESTINAL TRANSIT VELOCITY OF MILK ON LACTOSE HYDROLYSIS
Arhana Chattopadhyay
Clark High School, Plano, Texas

Lactose malabsorption results from the reduced activity of the ß-galactosidase enzyme which hydrolyzes lactose. The goal was to study the relationship between intestinal transit velocity of milk and lactose hydrolysis in vitro. It was hypothesized that transit velocity and lactose hydrolysis could not be correlated well.<br><br>A mechanical model was created using 10’ long channels. ONPG, a chromogenic substrate of ß-galactosidase, was substituted for lactose. The substrate was pumped through the lower channel at varying velocities. Buffers and a heater maintained pH 7.0 and body temperature. The ß-galactosidase was “secreted” by dripping through an upper channel. A calibrated spectrophotometer read the absorbance of each solution, which was translated into ONP concentration. <br><br>From the experiment, three mathematical models were derived to describe the relationship between substrate velocity and ONP concentration: the power, hyperbolic and exponential models. R2 tests and F-tests were used to determine that the negative power function best modeled the data: Concentration of ONP = (0.017) velocity^ - 0.84. The null hypothesis was rejected because such a correlation was found. <br><br>This study has enormous impacts. The physiological model of the intestine can be applied in other studies of the digestive system as an alternative to expensive, complicated in vivo analysis. The mathematical model derived in this study can also be modified to include the factors of inhibition, enzyme degradation, and severity of condition. Since increased fat content in milk slows flow rate, high fat milk could help mild to moderate lactose malabsorbers digest milk or experience fewer symptoms. <br><br>

GENETIC CONTROL OF THE EYE: QUANTITATIVE GENETIC MODULATION OF PHOTORECEPTOR DENSITY IN THE MOUSE
Congcong Guo
White Station High, Memphis TN, United States

Night blindness is dependent on a variety of factors, including genetics and are common in modern human populations, but given the variety of factors that influence the problem, is extremely difficult to study in human populations. Here a mouse model was used to investigate the genetic influences on the density of rods—photoreceptor cells in the retina that respond to light and detect the difference between light and dark. Rod density was measured in 46 recombinant inbred strains of mice (BXD RIs) derived from C57BL/6J and DBA/2J parent strains. Retinas of about 200 mice (around 5 mice per strain) were mounted and rods for representative areas were counted. <br><br> The rod densities for the recombinant inbred strains ranged from 349,000 to 515,000 rods /mm2 which ranged far above and below the parental strains, evident of transgression. In order to locate genes responsible for this variation, a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was completed, which performs a simple regression for each of 3700 markers across the genome to find the markers most closely associated with the phenotype. A QTL region was discovered on chromosome (chr) 6, from 40 to 100 megabases (Mb), (P<0.0003) and is significant (p<0.05) when corrected for genome-wide testing, and contains a retinoic acid receptor responder gene (Rarres2) and a gene possibly associated with intracellular junctions between photoreceptors (Mpp6) which are strong candidates for the effect of this QTL. <br><br>

SYNTHESIS OF TRIMETHYLGUANOSINE CAP ANALOGUES WITH THE POTENTIAL USE IN GENE THERAPY

XXXIII Liceum Ogolnoksztalcace Dwujezyczne im. Mikolaja Kopernika, Warsaw, mazowieckie, POLAND

RNA cap is a unique structure present on the 5’ end of some ribonucleic acids and plays important roles in the process of gene expression. There are several variants of cap structure present in various organisms. One of them is TMG cap (trimethylguanosine cap) which is involved in intranuclear transport of some types of RNA (eg. snRNA). It is indicated that TMG cap analogs could serve as a signal for therapeutics which act inside the nucleus. Such strategy of drug targeting provides new possibilities for treatments of diseases, which originate in the nucleus (eg. wrong transcription or pre mRNA splicing). One of them is Duchenne’s Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), which is a result of incorrect splicing of pre mRNA encoding protein called dystrophin. <br><br>This research work is focused on a synthesis method of one of such analogues, which contains an imidophosphate modification within the triphosphate bridge. The modification is expected to increase the resistance of the intranuclear transport signaling molecule against enzymatic degradation inside the cell due to the presence of a stable P-N-P bond substituting a natural pyrophosphate bond. An 8-step synthesis of dinucleotide TMG cap analog containing imidodiphosphate moiety has been performed. The structure and purity of final compound have been confirmed using mass spectrometry (MS), nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry (NMR spectrometry) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The obtained chemical compound is believed to be of high potential value to new treatment methods as a nuclear import identification signal for the so-called molecular patches or Antisense Oligonucleotides. It has to be thoroughly biochemically and biophysically tested, however, to determine its utility in vivo.

THE EFFECT OF HEAVY METALS ON PORPHYRIN RING COMPOUNDS, PART THREE: LEACHED MERCURY INTO THE BASE OF THE FOOD CHAIN NEAR COAL COMBUSTION WASTE DISPOSAL SITES
Arina Ghosh
Alabama School of Fine Arts, Birmingham, AL

In the last decade, there has been almost a threefold increase in coal combustion waste disposal sites that have caused toxic metal contamination to ground and surface water in nearby environments. The purpose of this year’s study was to see if a detectable concentration of mercury has leached out of coal combustion waste sites and into the soil and vegetation of residents in proximity to the landfills. <br><br> Lettuce and Brussels sprouts were grown in soil obtained from areas surrounding Perry County Arrowhead landfill. Each plant was allowed to grow for two weeks. While plants were growing, collected soil samples were washed with 10 mL of ethanol and filtered. The filtrates were then used in a mercury test, in which 2 drops of filtrate, 1.0% Potassium hexacyanoferrate(III), and 0.1% SDHA were combined in a well plate and heated at 70˚C overnight. A color change from yellow to blue-green indicated the presence of mercury. At the end of two weeks, plants were separated by leaves and stem/root. Plant sections were blended, washed with 10mL of ethanol, and filtered. They were then subjected to the same mercury test as described above. <br><br> There was a color change in all samples tested, signifying a presence of mercury in both the plants and the soil. The results from this study indicate that residents living near the Perry County Arrowhead landfill are at risk of mercury contamination and porphyrin ring related health effects.

METASTASIS AND TUMOR SUPPRESSORS: EFFECTS OF TRANSFERENCE OF THE RAF KINASE INHIBITOR PROTEIN (RKIP) ON SUPPRESSION OF MELANOMA THROUGH THE ERK-1 PATHWAYS, A FOUR YEAR STUDY
Melanie Paige Kabinoff
Park Vista Community High School, Lake Worth, FL

The purpose of this year’s study was to determine if over-expressed Raf Kinase Inhibitor Protein (RKIP) and Cyclin Dependent Kinase Inhibitor-2 (CDKN2) Protein produced in the C. elegans could be used to suppress both metastasis and tumor Melanoma in Lumbricus terrestris.<br><br> This multi-tiered, gene therapy experiment involved the production and expression of RKIP and CDKN2 Protein in C. elegans and then transfer of these proteins to Lumbricus terrestris. To accomplish this the C. elegans were immersed in a glucose-enriched extract in order for them to over-express RKIP and CDKN2 Protein. The proteins were separated through the use of a pneumatic press and electrophoresis and then stored in a serum bank. <br><br> Concurrently 480 Lumbricus terrestris, separated into eighteen sub-groups, were being infused three times weekly with RKIP, CDKN2, and a combination of both proteins. After three weeks of protein transfer treatment, 470 Lumbricus terrestris were exposed to doses of UV-B radiation from a tungsten-halogen light (unfiltered). The remaining 10 were used as a control. Lesions were removed from 10 sub-groups at the end of week four. A biopsy confirmed the presence of melanoma-like tumors on the Lubricus terrestris. <br><br> Ten sub-groups continued gene therapy for an additional 7 weeks, half for tumor suppression, half for metastasis suppression. The observations were charted, graphed and analyzed. The treatments provided conclusive results. The groups that were treated with the RKIP showed significant containment and suppression of both tumor and metastasis melanoma then the other groups. These results were forwarded to organizations studying melanoma suppressors.

TESTING FERMENTED PEPSTATIN-A ON THE INHIBITION OF RENIN IN YEAST CELLS
Erika Michelle Giblin
Palm Bay Senior High School, Melbourne, FL

The purpose of this project was to determine the efficiency of fermenting the protease inhibitor, Pepstatin-A, on the obstruction of renin production in yeast cells, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It was hypothesized that the yeast exposed to Pepstatin-A would show as greater inhibition of renin than those exposed only to saline solution; and that the cultures exposed to fermented Pepstatin-A would yield a greater renin inhibition than those exposed to unfermented Pepstatin-A.<br><br> Yeast were cultured using S. cerevisiae slants swabbed onto nutrient plates and incubated at 29 degrees Celsius for 72 hours. A sterile saline solution was added to the cultures to catalyze the production of renin. Protein gel electrophoresis was used to test for the presence of renin. A solution of 10mg Pepstatin-A and 4mL methanol was created. Half of this solution was fermented for ten minutes. The Pepstatin-A solutions were exposed to two thirds of the yeast cultures (half fermented and half not). A second electrophoresis gel was run. Cell counts and osmotic pressures of the cultures were determined to use for analysis of the effect of Pepstatin-A on the cultures. The entire experiment was repeated for a total of five trials.<br><br> In conclusion, hypotheses 1 and 2 were supported by the data and accepted. The cultures exposed to Pepstatin-A had a greater reduction in renin production than those exposed only to saline solution; and the cultures exposed to the fermented Pepstatin-A had a greater reduction in renin production than those exposed to unfermented Pepstatin-A.

THE ROLE OF THE PI3 KINASE/AKT/GSK3 SIGNALING PATHWAY ON THE INITIATION OF MEIOSIS THROUGH REGULATION OF GSK3BETA ACTIVITY
Samuel Lo Chen
California Academy of Mathematics and Science, Carson, California, USA

This project investigates GSK3beta, a gene hypothesized to regulate induction of mammalian meiosis. The objective is to identify the pathway GSK3beta goes through to initiate the cell division process, producing sperm cells in males and egg cells in females. The PI3 Kinase/AKT/GSK3 pathway known to promote cell growth in non-testicular cells, is the primary candidate pathway. Using conventional immunohistochemistry to stain cells based upon identification and binding of specific antibodies, the experiment aims to demonstrate that the phosphorylated (inhibited) form of GSK3beta, the form present in the pathway, and AKT1 are both to be expressed in the non-meiotic cells (Sertoli cells) in the mouse testis, identified through specific antibodies. The results show that phosphorylated-Ser9 GSK3beta and AKT1 antibodies both displayed expression of their respective proteins in the Sertoli cells, suggesting that this pathway is likely to control GSK3beta in meiosis. Western blotting analysis was also performed and shows the purity and functionality of the antibodies utilized in the immunohistochemistry proteins. Discovery of what controls the initiation of meiosis will have significant applications in treatment of male infertility, future production of novel hormonal-based contraceptives, and cancer-related studies in the male gonads.

To substitute cherries as a chocolate filling, using nopal cactus surplus. <br><br>I propose two alternatives:<br><br>Crystallized and fermented nopal and the nopal marmalade.<br><br>The nopal is used because in the months of April and May is the strong season of the production. <br><br>The fruit crystallization process, basically involves a slow pregnation with a syrup, until the sugar concentration in the tissue is strong enough for its antimicrobial preservation.<br><br>The preservation is due to the slow delivery of water through diffusion towards a concentrated solution of sugar.<br><br>The osmotic pression is also involved, that the concentrated solution (syrup) exercises on the fruit tissue, which favors the water salinity. The art of the process consists in allowing the process diffusion to be done slowly to prevent the wrinkling of the fruit, that is why is important to use a syrup that shows a progressive increase in the sugar concentration in order to avoid variation in the texture.<br><br>The main problems that I faced with the handling of nopal cactus for its production or elaboration are the peeling and the elimination of the mucilage.<br><br>The technique to obtain the crystallized nopals is to clean them, wash them and peel them. And later, cook them and cut the nopals. The next step is obtain a syrup with 60º Brix, mixing it with the nopals until obtain the crystallized product. To preparate the marmalade is necessary to liquefy the nopal (previously clean and pre cooked) with sugar, and cook them into a copper saucepan.<br><br>

KINASE PATHWAYS INVOLVED IN TNF-ALPHA UPREGULATION OF CHEMOTACTIC SIGNAL RESPONSE
Anand Chandranayan Baxi
White Station High School, Memphis TN 38117, United States of America

A549 lung epithelial cells, the main type of lung cells, are often susceptible to exterior substances. When this occurs, the invader and a cytokine, TNF-ALPHA, activate a transcription factor, NF-KAPPAB; NF-KAPPAB is usually bound and kept in the cytoplasm by its inhibitor IKAPPAB. However, TNF-ALPHA and the infection release NF-KAPPAB and allow it to go into the nucleus, where it produces a multitude of chemokines. These chemokines serve as proteins to fight the infection. Occasionally, once the infection has been eliminated, the upregulation of the chemotactic signal response remains, causing an imbalance of chemokines in this area. In essence, the body is generating an immune system response to a nonexistent invader; this could potentially escalate into an autoimmune disease. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to administer a synthetic cannabinoid, KM-233, to these cells and observe a downregulation in NF-KAPPAB and chemotactic activity; in addition, a purpose of this study is to find which pathway KM-233 travels through. SEAP Assays and a Multiple Cytokine Detection test were conducted. Results from the SEAP Assays show that NF-KAPPAB levels are lowered with the addition of KM-233 through p38 MAP Kinase pathway. The Multiple Cytokine Detection test also showed a downstream decrease in chemokines production but the chemokines reduction did not seem to be affected through p38 MAP Kinase. Thus, it can be concluded from this study that KM-233 causes a downregulation in the TNF-ALPHA induced chemotactic signal response through p38 MAP Kinase and another unknown kinase pathway.

THE EFFECTS OF THE HUMAN DIET ON OMEGA FATTY ACID LEVELS
Hannah Kim
Parkland High School, Allentown, PA

Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is a widespread analytical method that can be used to quantify omega fatty acids in human saliva. In today’s society, many have heard of omega fatty acids, but the majority of people are unaware of their true meaning and effects. This study delved into the effects of an adolescent’s diet on his/her levels of omega fatty acids, specifically omega-3 and omega-6. A healthy diet should include a sufficient amount of omega-3. Therefore, it was predicted that if the human subject’s diet satisfied the USDA’s nutrition guidelines, his/her ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 would be lower than the ratios of those that were not sufficient.<br><br> To determine this, participants recorded their diets on USDA’s MyPyramid.gov to establish their diets’ sufficiency. Fatty acids were extracted from the saliva using various instruments and chemicals. The sample was tested through GC/MS and analyzed using analysis software. From this, the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 was calculated and correlated to the subject’s diet.<br><br> It was determined that the previous hypothesis was supported. Subjects whose diets satisfied nutrition guidelines possessed a lower ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 than those whose diets lacked. Although omega-3 was not detected in all samples, 50% who possessed satisfactory diets had omega-3 identified. In addition, subjects who had insufficient meat intake had high, if not higher, levels of omega-9 than omega-6. This study concludes that a healthy diet satisfying the USDA nutrition guidelines will be more likely to include higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids.

EFFECT OF ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS ON NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDERS: USING PC12 NEURONAL CELLS AS A MODEL
Abhilasha Gokulan
Little Rock Central High School, Little Rock, AR

Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. While there is no known cause for the disease, one has been linked to the consumption of artificial sweeteners. This study tested the effects of artificial sweeteners, namely aspartame, saccharin, and sucralose, on the prevalence of neurodegenerative disorders, like Parkinson’s disease. Four types of experiments were conducted modeling human consumption of artificial sweeteners (developing vs. developed neuronal system, infrequent vs. frequent consumption.) Morphological changes were visualized, cytotoxicity assays were conducted, and protein docking was done. The results of all four experiments showed that sucralose was the most toxic compound to the PC12 cells, as it killed most of the cells, and prohibited the growth of dendritic formations and caused abnormalities in other cells. Following sucralose, saccharin was the most toxic. Saccharin had a significant number of differentiated cells, though several became vacuolated or elongated during the experiment. The least toxic sweetener was aspartame, in which the cells differentiated nicely, their only inhibition being that they formed slower than sucrose. The cytotoxicity assay duplicated these results by showing the greatest amounts of dead cells were in sucralose. Furthermore, the Scanning Electron Microscopy displayed the adverse effects that sucralose has on PC12 cells. The protein modeled structure showed that sucralose bonded with less interaction, as compared to saccharin and aspartame. This study concludes that artificial sweeteners do have an effect on neurodegenerative disorders, inhibiting the growth of PC12 cells. Sucralose was the most toxic, followed by saccharin, and then aspartame.

DIGEST THIS! HOW FOOD AFFECTS THE PH OF THE GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM
Michael Christian Green
The South Carolina Association of Independent Home Schools, Cayce, SC, USA

The purpose of this project was to discover how different foods affect the pH of the gastrointestinal tract. I predicted that proteins and fats would change the gastrointestinal pH more significantly than carbohydrates, fruits, and vegetables. To test my hypothesis, I simulated the digestive process by creating solutions with pH levels similar to those of the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. When testing a sample, I added each of these solutions to the sample after the approximate amount of time that food would normally spend in each area of the gastrointestinal tract. I measured the pH of the sample after adding each solution and repeated this test three times for each food. I also tested a control group, consisting of the five solutions and no food sample. <br><br> When comparing the food samples to the control group, I considered a net pH change of more than three to be significant. I found that 81.8% of the proteins and fats tested had significant change in pH when compared to the control group. Of the carbohydrates, fruits, and vegetables tested, only 28.6% had significant pH change. These results indicate that proteins and fats affect the gastrointestinal tract’s pH more than carbohydrates, fruits, and vegetables. This confirms my hypothesis.<br><br>

TARGETING SURVIVIN AS A POTENTIAL CANCER THERAPEUTIC
Kelsey Mackenzie Barter
University High School, Tucson, AZ

Survivin is a protein that prevents programmed cell death (apoptosis), promoting survival of cancer cells. Levels of survivin are high in cancer cells, and high levels of survivin correlate with poor clinical outcome. Therefore it is hypothesized that small-molecule modulation of survivin is a viable method for cancer treatment. This project aims to identify small-molecule binders to survivin, which can be biochemically tested and chemically refined to develop a verified inhibitor of survivin, with potential to become a cancer therapeutic.<br><br> In this experiment the survivin gene was cloned into DH5a E. coli cells following a ligation independent cloning strategy and the survivin protein was expressed in BL21-AI and BL21(DE3) E. coli cells. Amber mutations were inserted directly into the survivin coding sequence, replacing the existing codon at one of four positions. Suppression of the amber mutations was tested first with tyrosine, a canonical amino acid, then with varying concentrations of p-azidiomethylphenylalanine (pAzMeF), a non-canonical amino acid. Both tyrosine and pAzMeF were successfully incorporated to express full-length survivin. pAzMeF incorporation was optimized by testing multiple tRNA synthetases and pAzMeF concentrations. pAzMeF, which has a bio-orthogonal chemical handle, was incorporated to facilitate fluorescent labeling in preparation for screening of small-molecule survivin binders.<br><br> In the future, survivin containing pAzMeF will be purified, fluorescently labeled, and screened against a library of small molecules. Once unique small molecule binders to survivin are identified, they will be verified to generate leads, which will be evaluated as cancer therapeutics that disable survivin’s ability to inhibit apoptosis.

THE EFFECT OF HEAVY METALS ON PORPHYRIN RING COMPOUNDS PART TWO: HG AND PB UPTAKE AT THE BASE OF THE FOOD CHAIN NEAR TOXIC WASTE DISPOSAL SITES
Arina Ghosh
Alabama School of Fine Arts, Birmingham, AL

Across the nation, communities are possibly being exposed to hazardous material. Agencies are dumping this hazardous waste into waterways and landfills near communities, thus contaminating crops. The purpose of this study was to see if heavy metals can be taken up into the roots of plants, and consequently enter the bottom of the food chain. This study is a continuation of my project from last year which investigated the effect of heavy metals on porphyrin ring compounds. It was found that the heavy metals hindered the performance of the enzyme, catalase. This would parallel the situation in hemoglobin, a porphyrin ring compound similar to catalase. In this study, basil and pepper plants were grown and watered with 0.025M Hg(NO3)2 and Pb(NO3)2 solutions and H2O. The entire plant was added to water and then ground up in a blender. A NaCl solution was added to check for a precipitate. Precipitates resulted in all of the plants treated with heavy metal solutions whereas none appeared in the control, plants watered with H20. It was concluded that plants can absorb heavy metals into their roots, consequently entering and affecting the food chain. Populations living near landfills can ingest these heavy metals while eating the chemically saturated autotrophs and later face serious health complications because of the inefficiency of oxygen transportation by hemoglobin.

A WILD HAIR
Laci Sharee Lawrence
Andrews High School, Andrews, TX

"A Wild Hair" explores the effects human hair and epidermal keratin have on planarian regeneration and growth of common bacteria. I used five colors of sterilized human hiar and placed it in 30 containers (six/hair color) of water with cut planaria. When compared to the same number of control minus hair, this procedure should show if human hair affects the regrowth process. In another process, keratin solution was placed in water of planaria to see if actual hair or keratin works best in regeneration. For practical applications, I put sterilized hair and keratin solution separately on 20 Staphylococcus epidermis and 20 Escherichia coli bacterial dishes, using aseptic method. I looked for bacterial death/growth in areas of hair or keratin. Overall data showed hair increased planaria population 1.59 times more than control, with keratin increasing only 0.4. FUll-bodied planaria increased 2.25 times faster in hair and 1.19 times faster in keratin over control. The hair killed 62% in E. coli bacteria and 50% in Staph bacteria averaged trials. The keratin solution showed 100% bacteria present. These results open another question. Based upon this experimentation, if human hair kills 50% or more of the two bacteria and prompts faster regeneration in planaria, could this idea have later possibilities for uses with humans and healing?

IRON-STORAGE PROTEIN FERRITIN PROTECTS AGAINST OXIDATIVE STRESS
Coby Meyers Price
Sky View High School, Smithfield, Utah, United States of America

It is not known if iron can be released from the iron-storage protein ferritin for use in things like the synthesis of hemoglobin. Within the ferritin molecule, there are three possible channels through which iron could be released: hydrophilic channels, hydrophobic channels, and alpha helix bundle channels. I propose that the latter may be the channel through which iron can be released from ferritin. I produced a recombinant human ferritin variant to test the hypothesis that iron can be removed through the alpha helix bundle channel, the same channel through which iron is loaded into ferritin, which only exists in the H-chain of ferritin. Ferritin Heteromers were separated and purified to obtain a ferritin with a high ratio of L to H subunits, in which the L-chain was changed to include an alpha helix bundle. This recombinant human ferritin was loaded with iron and the rate of iron release was essentially identical to the rate or iron release from the H-chain homomer of ferritin. The results indicate that iron is released through the alpha helix bundle channel of the H subunit.

ISOLATION OF THE PRIMARY AGENT OF HYDROGEN GAS PRODUCTION THROUGH THE FERMENTATION OF CARBOHYDRATE-BASED MATERIALS
Jonathan Daniel Rittle
Conrad Wesier High School, Robesonia PA, United States of America

Hydrogen gas has been presented as a tempting alternative to petroleum based energy sources. Cleanly generating hydrogen gas is costly and currently has a lack of infrastructure in the United States. Industrial and agricultural waste products contain a large amount of potential chemical energy but accumulate in landfills. Various species of Clostridium contain enzymes that can degrade a variety of carbohydrate-based waste materials to produce large quantities of hydrogen gas. The ability of different species of Clostridium to generate hydrogen gas through fermentation of a simple carbohydrate was examined. Products of metabolism were analyzed by measuring rate of gas production and quantifying components of gas evolved. Individual species of Clostridium generated higher quantities of hydrogen gas than heat-treated soil mixtures. Gas produced by heat-treated soil mixtures produced 39% hydrogen gas, whereas an isolate of Clostridium generated up to 66% hydrogen gas. Hydrogen gas yields dropped towards the end of bacterial growth and may have been caused by several factors. A sophisticated bioreactor system must be developed in order to generate substantial amounts of hydrogen gas on an industrial scale.

Studies have shown that Sour Sop, Annona Muricata, and Sour Orange, Citrus Aurantium, contain cyanogenic chemicals, have sedative effects through chemical make up, and contain a chemical that causes Atypical Parkinson’s in some individuals. Also, a correlation has been drawn between the deaths of babies and the ingestion of Sour Sop bush tea in the West Indies.<br><br> The purpose of the experiment was to test if Annona Muricata, Citrus Aurantium, or Cymbopogan Citratus contains Phenobarbital, Amphetamines, Opiates, Cocaine, Cannabinoids, or Benzodiazepine. To see if these substances could be the reason for deaths and disease linked to the bush teas of one or more of these plants.<br><br> The design set up was to make tea using the leaves of these plants in a similar fashion to how West Indians would make tea. Then the teas were run through an Abuscreen OnLine Automated Assays for Drug Abuse machine, where results were then analyzed. Two trials were done because the first trial yielded negative results, so the methods were altered and more variations of tea were introduced and the teas were tested again. The design set up was done to parallel how West Indians make tea because the formal studies used for research were done using chemicals and extraction methods, which may have an impact on the results and if those results clearly state a harm to the West Indian consumers.<br><br> The results show that yes, some of the teas contain those substances, with the exception of Amphetamines. However, they do not contain substantial enough amounts of the substances to state a positive harmfulness to the consumers of the teas. This conflict between formal studies suggesting the teas are harmful and contain fatal substances and this experiment show that perhaps the methods and way the teas are consumed yield a safe outcome for the individuals.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF SINGLE AMINO ACID MUTATIONS, IDENTIFIED BY THE POPMUSIC ALGORITHM, ON ENGINEERING THERMALLY STABLE ENZYMES FOR BIOETHANOL PRODUCTION
Sanjna Ghanshani
University High School, Irvine, CA

The development of alternative energy technologies is critically important because of the rising price of crude oil, security issues related to world oil supplies, and environmental concerns about global warming. Conversion of plant biomass into biofuel has considerable advantages over other alternative energy strategies because biomass is the most abundant and renewable biomaterial on our planet. However, there are a few major bottlenecks with the current production of biofuels; one being, there is a lack of biocatalysts that can work efficiently and inexpensively at high temperatures used in the bioconversion of biomass into bioethanol. Several enzymes are involved in the bioconversion process, one of which is β-glucosidase. This enzyme is involved in the last step of breaking down cellulose into glucose, which is the preferred source of sugar for microbial fermentation, the enzymatic reaction that produces ethanol. In an attempt to increase the thermal stability of native β-glucosidase from Paenibacillus polymyxa using a rational protein engineering approach, several mutations were identified by an algorithm (PoPMuSiC) designed to predict single-site mutations that confer increased protein stability. Native β-glucosidase gene was first PCR-amplified from genomic DNA and cloned into an expression vector. Following confirmation of expression of wild-type β-glucosidase in E. coli, the top six mutations identified by PoPMuSiC were individually incorporated into the gene. Five mutants were successfully expressed and purified and their enzymatic activity evaluated with respect to wild-type β-glucosidase at optimal as well as elevated temperatures. Two mutants revealed enhanced thermal stability compared to WT enzyme, one of which was more stable by as much as 5°C.

DETERMINATION OF ALLELOPATHY IN KUDZU (PEURARIA MONTANA), PART II
Suranjana Dey
W.P. Davidson High School, Mobile, AL

This experiment is a continuation of one which initially sought to find if the invasive kudzu (Peuraria montana) species possesses allelopathic properties, which result in reduced speed of germination, produced by soluble phenolic compounds in concentrations >100ppm. The results from this experiment, indicating the kudzu is indeed allelopathic, lead to the present experiment which aimed to determine which kudzu organ most contributes to its allelopathic nature. The results from this experiment would assist those who face the invasive properties of kudzu and those studying the effects kudzu has on its environment. If kudzu (Peuraria montana) is observed to suppress growth of vegetation in its surrounding environment and kudzu leaves are the organ which most easily decompose, then the highest concentration of soluble phenolics will be in the kudzu leaves. <br><br> The analysis of the kudzu organ extracts to determine the soluble phenolic content as gallic acid equivalent in each organ was performed with a UV-vis spectrophotometer following the Folin-Ciocalteu method.<br><br> The hypothesis that if kudzu (Peuraria montana) is observed to suppress growth of vegetation in its surrounding environment and kudzu leaves are the organ which most easily decompose, then the highest concentration of soluble phenolics will be in the kudzu leaves was correct. The mean level of soluble phenolics was 214.38 in kudzu leaves. This concentration was higher than the 140.07 ppm and 73.31 ppm concentrations for kudzu roots and stems respectively. Indeed, the concentration of soluble phenolics in the stem is below the 100 ppm threshold which contributes to allelopathy.

DETERMINING THE EFFECTS OF CITRAL AND DIETHYLAMINOBENZALDEHYDE (DEAB) IN CELL DIVISION DURING GUT REGENERATION IN THE SEA CUCUMBER, HOLOTHURIA GLABERRIMA
Sofia Carolina Olivera-Rodriguez
Academia del Perpetuo Socorro, San Juan, PUERTO RICO

Echinoderms belong to the deuterostome group, which have the most striking capacity to regenerate lost body parts. Holothurians are able to regenerate most of their internal organs after eviscerating. The regeneration of lost body parts is well developed in most echinoderms. Moreover, retinoic acid (RA) has been associated with various cellular processes during regeneration and its basic machinery has been identified within protostome and deuterostome. Nevertheless the regenerative process is not yet fully understood. To determine if RA synthesis is associated with cell division, the principal investigator inhibited its synthesis with citral and DEAB. Then the investigator compared the regenerated cells within the experimental and control groups employing immunofluorescence. <br><br>The sea cucumbers, Holothuria glaberrima were eviscerated and put into tanks containing the different inhibitors of RA and controls. After six days of post evisceration the tissue was processed and examined in the microscope to compare the amount of dividing cells found in the blastema. The results showed that the inhibitors of RA synthesis caused a reduction in cell division. This result let the investigator know that retinoic acid is completely necessary for the gastrointestinal regeneration of the sea cucumber, Holothuria glaberrima. <br><br>Since human beings are evolutionarily associated with sea cucumbers, we can infer that RA is also needed for human organ regeneration and for embryo development, since without it, cell division will hardly to occur.

DETERMINING THE PRESENCE OF HETEROPLASMY THROUGH AND ANALYSIS OF THE HYPERVARIAB REGION OF MITOCHONDRIAL DNA
Charles Adaolph Jantzen
Latta High School, Ada OK, US

This experiment was conducted to determine the presence of heteroplasmy in Human Mitochondrial DNA in multiple populations through an analysis of the Hypervariable Region. The null hypothesis states that an analysis of the sequences of human mitochondrial DNA collected from different sites from the body will show no difference in the mtDNA within individuals. The Research Hypothesis states that older individuals will have more accumulated mtDNA single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) than younger individuals and will bear evidence of heteroplasmy. Also, person who have undergone radiation treatment, chemotherapy, or have been excessively exposed to UVA radiation will have higher amounts of accumulated mtDNA polymorphisms.<br><br>Hair samples were collected from a wide variety of individuals to receive samples that theoretically have higher amounts of mtDNA SNPs. MtDNA was isolated and amplified through PCR. Samples were electrophoresed to verify amplification. Samples were treated to remove extra primer, and sent out for sequencing. DNA sequences were received through Internet database and loaded to an Internet sequence server for individual comparisons. Sequences from each individual were compared cumulatively to search for SNPs. Higher SNP totals were found in older individuals and certain samples that were received from radiation, chemotherapy and UVA exposed individuals. Arm hair samples were found to be noticeably different than head, leg, and eyebrow hairs. It was evident that heteroplasmy does occur and is found more frequently in special populations and older individuals. The Null Hypothesis was rejected and the Research Hypothesis was supported by the results found.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF INCREASED GRAVITATIONAL FORCES ON THE CRYSTALLIZATION OF THE AMINO ACID GLYCINE, YEAR THREE
Kirk John Henf
Sebastian River High School, Sebastian, FL

The purpose of this experiment was to test the effects of increased gravity on the crystallization of glycine. In order to test this, a home-built centrifuge, which spun the test tubes containing a glycine:water solution in a 1:3 ratio, was used. The gravity exerted on the experimental group was three times the normal forces. Each group contained 4 test-tubes, and was run 6 times (24 test-tubes per test group). After running each trial for 10 hour, the mass of the crystals was determined, the number of crystals was counted, and the mass of the largest crystal per trial was also taken. An XRD test was also conducted for several crystals per group. The amount of dissolved glycine that crystallized (on average, out of 1.25 grams) was 1.116 grams in the experimental group and only 0.860 grams in the control group, an increase of nearly 30% in the experimental group. The mass of the largest crystal per trial was taken post-growth, and the average for the experimental group was 0.535 grams, compared to only 0.345 grams in the control group. Through XRD testing, it was found that the crystals in the experimental group crystallized in the alpha-form of glycine, and the crystals in the control group crystallized in the gamma-form of glycine. TEM imagery helped support these results. The centrifuge helped decrease the required nucleation time. This resulted in seed crystals forming much quicker and in various locations throughout the test tubes in the experimental group.

THE EFFECT OF GREEN TEA EGCG ON THE ABILITY OF P25-ACTIVATED CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE 5 (CDK5) TO INDUCE CELL DEATH IN COS-7 KIDNEY CELLS: IMPLICATIONS FOR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
Shivani Brinda Agarwal
Spring Valley High School, Columbia, South Carolina, United States

Recently, it has been shown that Japan’s elderly had a lower risk of developing Alzheimer’s than those in Western Europe and the United States (Green tea may protect the aging brain, 2006) and other researchers found that certain concentrations of EGCG protected neurons from BETA-amyloid-induced death (Bastianetto, 2006). The purpose of the current study was to determine whether EGCG was neuroprotective in its interaction with the toxic p25-cdk5 pathway that is linked to the amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease. The timing of EGCG application was also studied in order to determine when it would be most beneficial to the cos-7 kidney cells, and at what concentration of EGCG cell survival would be the highest. First, the concentration at which p25-cdk5 was most toxic and at what time the pathway would induce cell death were tested. Next, the effects of the concentration of and time at which EGCG was applied on the ability of p25-activated cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5) to induce cell death were studied. It was hypothesized that EGCG, when applied at 10 ìM at the time of transfection, would be most neuroprotective to the cos-7 cells, meaning that fewer cells would demonstrate cell death. Multiple chi-quared tests for independence showed that the p25-cdk5 pathway was extremely harmful to the cells and is possibly a cause factor of Alzheimer’s. Furthermore, the concentration of EGCG was shown to determine the health of cells with the highest concentration, 10 ìM, allowing the cells to have the highest survival rate.

PURIFICATION OF PLANT HEXOKINASES THAT RESPOND TO ANAEROBIC STRESS
Saad Abdul Sami Mir, Crestview Senior High School
Crestview, Florida, 32539, USA

Flooding has been estimated to reduce yields by up to 20% annually. Unlike many crop plants, Echinochloa phyllopogon can germinate and grow anaerobically for significant periods of time. The goal of this experiment was to begin to characterize the role of hexokinases in conferring flood tolerance in Echinochloa phyllopogon. The expression of hexokinase enzymes is strongly up-regulated in response to anaerobic conditions and regulates the flow of carbon in glycolysis. An important part of this characterization is to ascertain the number of isozymes (alternate forms of the enzyme) that are present in Echinochloa phyllopogon. I hypothesized that specific isozymes are important for regulating carbon metabolism during flooding. My approach utilized standard ammonium sulfate/ethanol precipitation and anion exchange chromatography to purify hexokinase isozymes from the shoots of Echinochloa seedlings. Spectrophotometry was used to quantify protein levels and enzyme activities. Sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophesis was used to monitor the purification process. Results indicated the presence five major hexokinase isozymes in Echinochloa phyllopogon, two of which appear to respond specifically to anaerobic stress. The isozymes were purified 25 fold to a specific activity of approximately 20 units per milligram of protein (1 unit = conversion of 1 mole glucose to glucose-6-phosphate per minute at 25 degrees Celsius). These results will allow further experimentation to generate molecular probes that can be used to determine whether hexokinase inhibits or promotes gene expression at the mRNA and protein levels in Echinochloa phyllopogon. These genes can then be manipulated in order to better suit the agricultural world.

THE IDENTIFICATION AND ANALYSIS OF MUTATIONS IN THE RP1 GENE FOR THE CREATION OF THE RP MICROARRAY CHIP
Ruonan Cheng
Yorktown High School, Yorktown Heights NY, USA

Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is one of the most commonly inherited retinal diseases found throughout America. RP can be caused by many possible mutations, making it extremely difficult for a scientist to determine the genetic cause of one particular case with just a clinical test. This research project focused on the creation of a RP microarray chip (containing all known RP genetic variants) as a solution to this problem. The project involved analyzing the underlying molecular genetics of RP within 36 human patients. By identifying/ verifying the mutations within the RP1 gene (which causes over 10% of adRP) using the current methods of dHPLC analysis and sequencing, the compiled results are then incorporated into the creation of the chip. The analysis of amplicons from the 36 DNAs revealed 39 mutations; most of the mutations resided in exon 4 of the RP1 gene, with a significant mutation cluster at the 442- nucleotide segment.

ROLE OF HUMAN CELLULAR APOPTOSIS SUSCEPTIBILITY PROTEIN (HCAS) IN PANCREATIC CANCER
Samra Kazim
Tampa Bay Technical High School, Tampa, FL

a) Purpose of the experiment: The purpose of the experiment is to investigate the role of human cellular apoptosis susceptibility protein (hCAS) in pancreatic cancer. <br><br>b) Procedure: Normal immortalized human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells HPNE and human pancreatic cancer cell line MiaPaCa-2 were grown in standard M3F base and DMEM culture media with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Mia PaCa-2 cells were transfected with hCAS SiRNA or control scrambled SiRNA, harvested after 48 h, counted using trypan blue dye, assayed for cell proliferation (MTT) and malignant transformation (soft agar colony formation), apoptosis and cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry. Proteins (40 µg) were used for electrophoresis. Protein bands on nitrocellulose membranes were treated with primary antibodies (hCAS, PARP-1, and beta-actin) followed by secondary HRP conjugated antibody. Membranes were treated with luminol and hydrogen peroxide, exposed to film and developed. <br><br>c) Data: The data show that hCAS protein expression was very high in human pancreatic MiaPaCa-2 cancer cells compared to normal HPNE cells. hCAS knock down using hCAS siRNA in MiaPaCa-2 cells resulted in inhibition of anchorage-dependent (MTT) and independent (soft agar colony formation) cell growth, G2 cell cycle arrest and induction of cell death (Trypan blue and PARP-1 cleavage) compared to control siRNA treatment. <br><br>d) Conclusions: The study concluded that hCAS protein is over expressed in pancreatic cancer cells and may be used as diagnostic cancer biomarker. Inhibition of hCAS seems to be a potential therapeutic target in advanced human pancreatic cancer.

DISRUPTION OF CONNEXIN43 AND ZO-1 INTERACTION RESULTS IN INCREASED GAP JUNCTION SIZE IN RAT NEONATAL CARDIOMYOCYTES
Ching Zhu
Academic Magnet High School, North Charleston, SC, USA

The gap junction (GJ) is an aggregate of intercellular channels that links the cytoplasm of neighboring cells and allows small molecules such as ions to pass between these cells. Within the mammalian heart, the distribution of connexin43 (Cx43)-containing gap junctions is essential to facilitating the coordinated spread of electrical activation throughout the cardiac muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) and allowing the heart to contract properly. Disruptions in GJ distribution patterns in the adult heart are thought to be linked directly to cardiac disease and arrhythmia. <br><br> Recently, the protein zonula-occludens-1 (ZO-1) has been suggested to have an important role in the organization of GJs between cardiomyocytes in development and disease. However, the underlying mechanism by which ZO-1 affects GJ organization remains undetermined. In this study, the interaction between Cx43 (the major cardiac GJ protein) and ZO-1 in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes was inhibited by a peptide designed to disrupt the binding of Cx43 and ZO-1. Images of the Cx43 GJs and ZO-1 in treated and control cultures of myocytes were collected by confocal microscopy and quantitatively analyzed. The resulting data indicate a significant increase in Cx43 aggregate size accompanying a decrease in Cx43-ZO-1 binding mediated by the peptide. These results suggest that ZO-1 may be important in regulating the extent of Cx43 GJ aggregates and provide insight into the presently unknown role of ZO-1 interaction with gap junction sub-unit proteins. <br><br>

CURCUMIN INHIBITS A6B4 INTEGRIN-DEPENDENT BREAST CARCINOMA CELL MOTILITY
Huang Huang
Caddo Parish Magnet High School, Shreveport, LA, USA

Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a polyphenol natural product isolated from the rhizome of the plant Curcuma longa, is appearing in early clinical trials as an anticancer agent. However, the mechanism by which curcumin inhibits cancer cell functions such as cell growth, proliferation, and motility is largely unknown. In this study, we focused on curcumin's impact on the function of a well-known tumor antigen called a6B4 integrin. We postulated that a6B4 mediates survival and motility of breast cancer cells in part through its downstream Akt signaling pathway. Overexpression of a6B4 has been documented in breast carcinoma progression.<br><br> Here we show that curcumin inhibits a6B4 integrin-dependent migration of breast carcinoma cells (MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231) in a concentration-dependent manner, using Transwell assays. Significant inhibition of cell motility was observed starting at 5 µM. To further define the molecular mechanism by which curcumin blocks migration, we showed the impact of curcumin treatment on Akt, one of the major downstream protein kinases of the a6B4 integrin that mediates cancer metastasis. While overexpression of a6B4 integrin in MDA-435 parental cells dramatically increased cell motility and Akt phosphorylation, curcumin treatment effectively blocked these processes. Furthermore, a combination of 5 µM curcumin and 25 µM Akt inhibitor synergistically suppressed Akt activity and cell migration. Under these experimental conditions, curcumin inhibition of cell motility was not due to curcumin's cytotoxicity, as demonstrated by the apoptosis assays. The results indicate that curcumin inhibits a6B4 integrin-dependent breast carcinoma cell motility at least partially by targeting the Akt pathway.<br><br>

INTRANASAL ADMINISTRATION OF NEUROPEPTIDE-Y INFLUENCES DEVELOPMENT OF PTSD-LIKE SYMPTOMS
Sheida Takmil
Ossining High School, Ossining, NY

Studies show that neurotransmitter neuropeptide-Y (NPY) is associated with resilience from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. However, central administration of NPY has been found to cause hypertensive effects. This research evaluated the alternative, less-intrusive method of intranasal NPY administration in rats subject to the single-prolonged stress (SPS) model, which has shown to effectively reproduce PTSD-like symptoms. In a pretreatment experiment performed by the supervising scientist, NPY was intranasally administered to an experimental rat group before SPS; changes in protein c-Fos levels in brain tissue were analyzed by the student researcher. Pre-treatment results demonstrate that NPY may ultimately advance anxiety-like behavior, as the treatment may have influenced higher locus coeruleus activity and upregulation of noradrenaline synthesis, a change seen in PTSD patients. In a post-treatment experiment, rats were intranasally treated with NPY following SPS (performed by the supervising scientist), and explored an Elevated Plus Maze from which anxiety-like behaviors were analyzed by the student researcher through videotape. Post-treatment results show no significant difference between groups in risk assessment frequency (p=0.7361) or duration (p= 0.1950), or open arm duration (p=0.1372) but do show significant differences in open arm entry frequency (p=0.0297), closed arm entry frequency (p=0.0177) and duration (p=0.001); post-treated NPY rats therefore demonstrate stronger avoidance behavior and anxiety index (p=0.0361). This research suggests that neither intranasal pre- or post-administration of NPY may be effective in providing resilience and may actually induce anxiety, through results antithetical to previous findings. The findings of this study can ultimately contribute to efforts toward treatment for PTSD patients, such as individuals who have witnessed a death or veterans of war.

MINIMUM INHIBITORY CONCENTRATIONS IN BACTERIOSTATIC AND BACTERICIDAL HERBS: A TWO YEAR STUDY
Ekta Ashok Solanki
Lake Brantley High School, Longwood, FL, USA

This research investigated the lowest concentration of the herbal agent needed to completely inhibit visible growth on agar plates containing the strain to be tested, either Bacillus Cereus or Escherichia Coli. <br><br> Serial dilutions of 1:1, 1:4, 1:16, and 1:64 were done on each herb being tested (Oregano, Cloves, Rosemary, Parsley, Basil, Mustard Seed, Sage, Cilantro, Cloves and Cinnamon). Nutrient agar plates were swabbed with either type of bacteria: Bacillus cereus and Escherichia Coli. Once nutrient agar plates are swabbed, a sterile filter paper disk will be dipped into the diluted herbal agent. The disk was then placed in the center of the nutrient agar and pressed down lightly to secure it. After 18 hours of incubation the zones of inhibition were measured in millimeters. This process was repeated four times. To validate results, liquid minimum inhibitory concentrations were prepared in three series: Series one contained the diluted substance; Series two contained the positive control; Series three contained the negative control, each containing the organism to be tested. After 18 hours of incubation, the tubes were observed to record whether bacterial inhibition occurred.<br><br> After completion of these tests the following conclusions were formulated. There are growth inhibitors present in most of the diluted agents in either organism. However, the higher dilutions tend to inhibit less bacterial growth. The minimum inhibitory concentration is the 1:4 concentration. Therefore, it can be concluded that, if the certain dilution, which has proved to be most inhibitory, is extracted from the herbal agent, bacterial inhibition will take place. To better improve my research, more dilutions could have been used and different organisms could have been tested for resistance.<br><br>

WHY ASPIRIN NEEDS ENTERIC COATING
Quinton Jon Sistare
WMST, Washington, DC, United States

The purpose of this project was to determine which Brand of 81mg enteric coated aspirin caused the least amount of stomach irritation by discovering which coating lasted the longest in the conditions of the stomach and lasted the least in the conditions of the small intestine. <br><br>The procedures followed the following steps:<br><br>Step 1: Five beakers were filled with 100mL of various pH solutions to simulate the different conditions of the stomach and small intestine.Step 2: The base of the foot bath was filled 1-2 quarts of heated water.Step 3: Five beakers were placed in the foot bath and set the bath to its maximum vibration, bubble producing, and heat setting.Step 4: Five brands of aspirin were placed in the beakers and the stopwatch was started.Step 5: The tablets were monitored and notes were recorded on the progress of individual tablets.<br><br>The major results were: <br><br>In trail 1 all the brands tablets withstood the simulation with the exception of CVS's Brand.In trail 2 all brands were able to withstand the simulation.In trail 3 all brands dissolved at very rapid rates.<br><br>It was concluded that the Costco’s Kirkland Brand of aspirin was the best. The Kirkland Brand only cost $0.0148 per tablet making it the cheapest of all of the aspirin brands. Kirkland’s brand of aspirin was also able to withstand the harsh simulations of the stomach. Lastly, Kirkland’s brand was the second brand to fully dissolve in the high pH solution to simulate the small intestine. If the aspirin is unable to time release at the right moment like the CVS brand it’s a risk to your health. However if the aspirin is able to time release like the Kirkland brand, then the effects of the aspirin will be quick but not harmful.<br><br>

LIGAND BINDING PROPERTIES OF THE BREAST CANCER MOLECULAR TARGET AROMATASE (A TWO YEAR STUDY)
Jonathan Lloyd Priester
William B. Murrah High School, Jackson, Mississippi, United States of America

The goals of my investigations are to better understand the features that govern the binding interactions of selected substrates and inhibitors to cytochrome P450 aromatase. In year one of my research I characterized the binding of formestane to aromatase and compared it to that of the natural substrate androstenedione. In my current study, I characterized the binding features of the aromatase inhibitor exemestane. The Ks of exemestane was 112 nM. Compared to the Ks of formestane (233 nM), exemestane exhibited higher binding affinity. However, both exemestane and formestane had lower affinities than the natural substrate androstenedione (Ks = 63 nM). The mechanisms of binding by exemestane and formestane were also similar. In addition, I investigated the effects binding of the inhibitors had on the spectroscopic features of the aromatase heme environment. I allowed aromatase to proceed through the catalytic cycle in the presence of substrate and/or inhibitors. I then reduced the samples, added the probe ligand (CO), and performed wavelength scans to identify spectral features. The ferrous carbonmonoxy peak at 450 nM, which is indicative of functional cytochrome P450, disappeared in all cases. The 420 nM peak indicating locally misfolded aromatase was present with natural substrate included but not when formestane (inhibitor) was present. This suggests the possibility of differential stabilization of aromatase by the substrates and inhibitors. Therefore, the activity and functional studies performed in year 2 validated the catalytic binding analysis of year 1, and provided a new understanding of the various properties of aromatase based hormonal Breast Cancer Treatment.

OPTIMIZATION OF BOVINE CD1B3 3D STRUCTURE: EXPLORING A LIPID ANTIGEN-BINDING COMPLEMENT GLYCOPROTEIN FOR POTENTIAL MALARIAL INTERVENTION
Rosalie Shinwei Doerksen
Oxford High School, Oxford, MS

Malaria is carried from human to mosquito to human by deadly Plasmodium parasites in a never-ending cycle. The disappearance of malarial parasites from England at the end of the nineteenth century can be attributed to the expansion of cattle herding. Mosquitoes preferentially bit cattle rather than humans. Plasmodium sporozoites, unable to survive against the bovine immune system, died out completely.<br><br>Within the immune system of both humans and cattle, the complement antigen-binding protein CD1b is present; however, there are several differences in their CD1b protein sequence. Those differences may explain how cattle defeat the protozoal invasion.<br><br>Computational methods can be used to study the effects of this protein on the protozoan, but overcoming errors in the crystal structure is a necessary preliminary step. In this project the published X-ray crystal structure of bovine Cd1b3 protein was analyzed for possible errors, using Schrödinger’s Maestro and Prime software. Several missing amino acid side chains, overlapping atom pairs, a chain break and invalid atom types were detected. Once all corrections were made and the termini capped, the structure was minimized using the OPLS_2005 force field method. The resulting structure seemed reasonable according to the Ramachandran plot. Lipid-antigen binding pockets could then be further studied.<br><br>This work has revealed the errors in the boCd1b3 crystal structure, preparing for further study of the antigen-binding protein.

HISTOLOGICAL EVIDENCE OF TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR NINE AMELIORATION OF AMYLOID PATHOLOGY IN A TGSWDI MOUSE MODEL
Charlotte Sophia Herber
Fox Lane High School, Bedford, NY

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common and costly neurodegenerative disease today and will become increasingly prevalent. This study developed an emerging method of passive immunization to prevent and break apart the amyloid plaques that cause AD without adverse side effects. By stimulating a nonspecific, nontoxic immune response via toll-like receptor nine (TLR9) using type B cytosine-guanine DNA oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODNs), we hoped to eliminate the neurotoxicity and cerebral microhemorrhage observed in previous vaccination studies. Previously investigated in Tg2576 and 3xTg mouse models of AD, these compounds were histologically assessed for efficacy and toxicity after being injected by my mentor into two TgSwDI age cohorts. This murine model expresses vascular amyloid, or congophilic amyloid angiopathy (CAA) that is of concern because of its prevalence in AD and tendency to increase hemorrhage risk. Preliminary data from novel object recognition tests performed by other team members and histological analysis of stained brain sections in two age groups indicated that CpG ODNs significantly improved cognitive function and reduced vascular amyloid burden by 30% without associated neuroinflammatory gliosis or hemorrhage. This suggests that TLR9 stimulation with CpG ODNs could constitute a safer method to successfully prevent and ameliorate amyloid-beta AD pathology.

INVESTIGATING THE ROLE OF PTEN IN THE INSULIN SIGNALING PATHWAY TO TREAT TYPE 2 DIABETES
Meredith Regan Spadaccia
Yorktown High School, Yorktown Heights, NY, USA

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus accounts for 90-95% of all diabetes cases, increasing at 6% per year and potentially reaching a total of 200-300 million cases by 2010. Research for the last 20 years has focused on characterizing the associated insulin-resistance or continual obstruction of the insulin signaling cascade. Normally, upon binding to its receptor on the plasma membrane, insulin initiates a series of phosphorylation events of various cytosolic proteins, which ultimately result in increased glucose transport into the cell. Insulin specifically activates one glucose transport protein, GLUT4. When GLUT4 is activated, it translocates from its position around the nucleus to the plasma membrane and allows glucose to enter the cell. In a condition of insulin resistance, the insulin cascade is blocked, and GLUT4 is not fully activated. With reduced GLUT4 activation, less glucose enters the cell for use in vital cell processes and insulin is ineffective. PIP3, and intracellular lipid, is a key intermediate regulator of the insulin signaling pathway. Phosphatase and Tensin homolog deleted on chromosome TEN (PTEN) is a lipid phosphatase that acts on PIP3, and may, by modifying PIP3, regulate the insulin signaling pathway. This research determined the exact effects of PTEN on PIP3 in adipose tissue, as well as if the phosphatase increased insulin sensitivity and consequent glucose uptake. Inhibition of PTEN in adipocytes resulted in a dramatic increase in insulin sensitivity. PTEN can now be targeted pharmaceutically for the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes.

GENETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY TO PROSTATE CANCER: THE TOBAGO STUDY
Shantanu Kadir Gaur, Bethel Park High School
Bethel Park, PA, USA

The male Afro-Caribbean population on the island of Tobago possesses an abnormally high rate for prostate cancer. Preliminary prostate cancer screening has shown high serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. An examination of polymorphisms in the PSA gene using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), restriction digest, and gel electrophoresis revealed that a substitution (of the A nucleotide) mutation (G/A or A/A) is prevalent in the population and can be a factor contributing to an elevated risk for prostate cancer. A p-value of .01 indicates that the A substitution is statistically significant in enhancing the biological aggressiveness of prostate cancer in Tobago males. Further study done on PSA regulatory genes will clarify the specific cellular significance of mutations in the PSA gene and its role in regulating signal transduction pathways.

AN IN DEPTH STUDY OF A STANDARD NITRATE ASSAY PROCEDURE
Garret Terry Fox
American Fork High School, American Fork Utah, 84003

For my science project I have intensely studied a standard nitrate procedure. I began by running a standard nitrate assay procedure. By using the enzyme nitrate reductase to reduce nitrate to nitrite, I was able to react the nitrite with two color reagents to form a colored solution. I then used a Beckman DB Spectrophotometer to read the concentration of the colored solution. This works because the original nitrate level is directly related to the amount of nitrite reduced. After successfully completing this nitrate assay, I decided to determine the rate of the color reaction that was happening between the color reagents (NeDD and Sulf) and the nitrite. <br><br>This was done by testing several different concentrations of each chemical while holding the others constant. I found the rate law of the color reaction to be .64 times the concentrations of Nitrite and Sulfanilamide. This turned out to be an accurate assay to measure unknown nitrite concentrations. I then obtained my own nitrate reductase from enriched ground oat juice. I have used two different methods to obtain this. I have used a blender and centrifuge and liquid nitrogen and centrifuge. Both methods work, but I am trying to determine which best preserves the enzyme activity. I have now started trying to get results from other plants as well, such as wheat and rye. These may be faster to grow or have a more stable reductase enzyme. I am also trying to determine the rate of enzyme decay from my extractions.

THE EFFECTS OF HYDROGEN PEROXIDE ON HIF-1 ALPHA EXPRESSION IN ASTROCYTES
Jessica Lea Meier-Peterson
Nicolet High School, Glendale, WI, United States of America 

The primary objective of this study is to determine the effects of hydrogen peroxide on the accumulation of the HIF-1 complex in astrocyte cultures. The hypothesis for this experiment is that the addition of hydrogen peroxide will deactivate the proline (which is oxygen dependent) on the 27-aa segment of HIF-1a. When proline deactivation occurs, the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor no longer targets HIF-1a for destruction, thus allowing for an accumulation of HIF-1a and accordingly, the increase in HIF-1 protein expression. As such, the expected response is an increase in the expression of the HIF-1 protein after exposure to hydrogen peroxide. <br><br><br>In order to test this hypothesis, the astrocytes are split into groups that test their response to .09% and .9% hydrogen peroxide under both normoxia and hypoxia. After all of the groups are treated, the protein amounts are standardized and tested using a western blot. The results of this preliminary study indicate that hydrogen peroxide may induce HIF-1a expression in both hypoxia and normoxia.<br><br><br>Though similar studies relating to HIF-1a expression have been conducted, their results have been varied and controversial, and thus inconclusive. This study attempts to resolve the conflict and to gain knowledge that will be useful in later studies relating to a cure for the damage caused by such ischemic diseases as stroke and cardiopulmonary disease.<br><br>

DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL BIOSENSOR FOR THE EFFICIENT DETECTION OF INFECTIOUS PATHOGENS AND ENVIRONMENTAL INVADERS
Adrian Veres
Jean-De-Brébeuf College, Montréal, Québec, Canada

Infectious diseases affect, every year, millions of people all around the globe. Drastic improvements in quality of life could result from the ability to diagnose these types of diseases efficiently, in a time- and cost-efficient manner. The main objective of the project is to propose and demonstrate a novel biosensor design, using electrical-based methods, able to detect micro-organisms in fluids such as pathogens in blood samples. The proof of concept will be realized by screening for the four main pathogens causing septicemic conditions in humans. More specifically, the system is designed to be sensible, rapid, cost-efficient and simple to use.<br><br>The biosensor proposed in this project is divided into three intercommunicating modules (the transduction, the detection and the recuperation modules) combining biochemistry and electrochemistry. They are integrated into a microfluidic platform that automates the entire analysis procedure. The presence of the pathogen is firstly amplified by a PCR, whose resulting amplicon is attached to a glucose-oxidase coated magnetic bead. By a DNA hybridization even, the bead is localized between a specific pair of electrodes. Upon localization, the glucose oxidase is activated and produces hydrogen peroxide, which increases the conductibility of the solution around the electrodes. This change can be picked up with an amperometric measurement. Finally, the amplicons are cleaved off the magnetic beads, which can now be recycled for further uses. By integrating this entire system on a microfluidic device, it can answer the defined objectives of speed, sensibility, efficiency and simplicity.<br><br>

THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL GENE KNOCK-OUT TECHNIQUE UTILIZING RNA-INTERFERENCE
Jason Chao Zhang
Yorktown High School, Yorktown Heights N.Y., United States of America

Gene knock-out has become vital in the development of drug-based pharmaceuticals, with many institutions focused solely on the application of related methodologies. However, current knock-out technology is limited and consists of crude deletion techniques and nonspecific pathways. RNA-interference, with high specificity and variability, offers an alternative for genetic manipulation. Integration of miRNA and siRNA interference pathways allows for optimized processing and the possibility of multiple knock-out while maintaining a consistent and flexible gene silencing at the DNA level. In this investigation, mutant let-7a-3 miRNA constructs and Renilla-Luciferase-mRNA coding target were transfected into P19 cell cultures.<br><br> Transfected cells were analyzed with two luminescent markers: Renilla-Luciferase (targeted-gene expression) and Firefly-Luciferase (relative transcription of targeted-gene containing plasmid). The target sequence of the let-7a-3 miRNA was fused with the Renilla-Luciferase gene to generate a viable RNAi target and Renilla-Luciferase expression levels were normalized by Fire-Luciferase expression. Resulting levels of gene silencing were variable but consistent, the highest being around 70%, validating a potential DNA vector-based miRNA knock-out technology. Future introduction of recombinase sites or effector switches will allow for conditional knock-out.<br><br> Using the data derived from the present study, RNAi can be utilized to provide a better approach to gene regulation. Further optimization of this system is clearly essential.<br><br>

TRIBUTYLTIN DISRUPTS ADIPOCYTE METABOLISM
Emily Taylor Hayes
Walter Payton College Preparatory High School, Chicago, IL

The quickly growing rate of obesity has led to the hypothesis that synthetic chemicals are a potential causative factor of obesity. One chemical of interest is tributyltin (TBT), an environmental pollutant that enhances adipocyte differentiation through the activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma), a transcription factor controlling many adipocyte genes. TBT is believed to stimulate the same pathways as the pharmacological PPAR-gamma agonist troglitazone. This project explores the effects of TBT on adipocyte differentiation. Luciferase assays were performed to determine the concentration of TBT that causes the same amount of PPAR-gamma activation as 2.5 micromolar troglitazone. After cell culture of 3T3-L1 cells with treatments of varying concentrations of TBT and/or troglitazone, quantitative real-time PCR was performed to measure gene expression, and immunoblotting was conducted to measure protein expression. While troglitazone significantly increased expression of all experimental genes and proteins compared, TBT exposure resulted in a different pattern of expression at equivalent PPAR-gamma activation. This project shows that TBT and troglitazone do not have identical behavior in altering adipocyte differentiation. These results may improve our understanding of the mechanisms by which TBT disrupts adipocyte differentiation, which will lead to strategies for treatment and prevention of chemically-enhanced obesity.

DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL BIOSENSOR FOR THE EFFICIENT DETECTION OF INFECTIOUS PATHOGENS AND ENVIRONMENTAL INVADERS
Adrian Veres
Jean-De-Brébeuf College, Montréal, Québec, Canada

Infectious diseases affect, every year, millions of people all around the globe. Drastic improvements in quality of life could result from the ability to diagnose these types of diseases efficiently, in a time- and cost-efficient manner. The main objective of the project is to propose and demonstrate a novel biosensor design, using electrical-based methods, able to detect micro-organisms in fluids such as pathogens in blood samples. The proof of concept will be realized by screening for the four main pathogens causing septicemic conditions in humans. More specifically, the system is designed to be sensible, rapid, cost-efficient and simple to use.<br><br>The biosensor proposed in this project is divided into three intercommunicating modules (the transduction, the detection and the recuperation modules) combining biochemistry and electrochemistry. They are integrated into a microfluidic platform that automates the entire analysis procedure. The presence of the pathogen is firstly amplified by a PCR, whose resulting amplicon is attached to a glucose-oxidase coated magnetic bead. By a DNA hybridization even, the bead is localized between a specific pair of electrodes. Upon localization, the glucose oxidase is activated and produces hydrogen peroxide, which increases the conductibility of the solution around the electrodes. This change can be picked up with an amperometric measurement. Finally, the amplicons are cleaved off the magnetic beads, which can now be recycled for further uses. By integrating this entire system on a microfluidic device, it can answer the defined objectives of speed, sensibility, efficiency and simplicity.<br><br>

AUDIO PERCEPTION: PLOTTING THE PATHWAY OF THE BK CHANNEL
Sophia Paulina Mae Sokolowski
Academy at the Lakes, Land O' Lakes, FL

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health designated the study of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) a research priority for the 21st century. Noise-induced hearing loss has increased largely through the use of portable listening devices and, more recently, because of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In fact, hearing loss is the most prevalent diagnosis for U.S. soldiers returning from these wars due to exposure from small arms fire, artillery fire, and improvised explosive devices.<br><br> The purpose of this study was to investigate the BK ion channel, a pore-forming protein in the membrane of sensory and nerve cells of the inner ear that allows the efflux of potassium ions from the cell. The BK channel increases hearing sensitivity and also plays a role in noise-induced hearing loss. However, very little is known about how this channel is regulated. The present study examined two candidate protein partners of the BK channel in the mouse cochlea: the enzyme methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) and the Ras-related protein, Rab11b. To determine these protein-protein interactions, I used reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation, immunolocalization, and Rab11b over expression and silencing. <br><br> Reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation showed that both MTAP and Rab11b interact with BK. Rab11b is highly expressed in the sensory cells of the cochlea. Moreover, Rab11b, cloned from the cochlea, increased BK expression, whereas Rab11b silencing decreased BK. I conclude that these two proteins interact with the BK channel, and Rab11b can regulate BK expression. These interactions may strongly influence the BK channel during noise-induced hearing loss.

NUCLEOTIDE SUBSTITUTION IN DROSOPHILA AND ITS IMPACT ON THE NEUTRAL THEORY
Aaron Tuc-Lon Cheung
South Carolina Governor's School for Science and Mathematics, Hartsville, SC, US

<br><br>Nucleotide substitution, or point mutation, is a major catalyst of evolution. The primary goal of this research is to correlate the rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions from Drosophila Melanogaster to Drosophila Erecta. Nucleotide substitutions were detected by sequencing the genome of Drosophila Erecta. DNA from these flies was extracted, refined through a rigorous course of protocols, and entered into a sequencing machine. The rate of nucleotide substitution was found to vary greatly among the twenty successfully sequenced genes. The observed variance in nonsynonymous mutations can be explained by natural selection. If a nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution changed an amino acid in a crucial protein, the resulting protein might no longer function. Such a lethal mutation would not be transmitted to future generations while a less lethal mutation on a trivial protein might survive many generations. As a result, crucial genes had fewer nonsynonymous substitutions than trivial ones. Synonymous substitutions, however, synthesize the same amino acid, and thus should not be affected by selection. The observed strong variance in rates of synonymous nucleotide substitutions could not be explained by the widely accepted Neutral Theory, which states that synonymous single-nucleotide differences are selectively neutral. Instead, this study found that 40% of all codon-groups showed bias towards a specific synonymous codon. This evidence raised the possibility of an unknown evolutionary force underlying the phenomenon such that if a certain gene carried more codon-biased amino acid sets, it would tend to remain stable and mutate less causing a lower rate of synonymous substitutions.

THE EFFECT OF COLLOIDAL SILVER AND BROMELAIN ON VIABILITY OF PC12 CELLS
Marcelina Puc
Lane Technical College Preparatory High School, Chicago, IL

Purpose:<br><br>The nature of this experiment is to explore undiscovered cancer treatments (using colloidal silver and bromelain)on pheochromocytoma cells (PC12) without the use of chemotherapy.<br><br>Procedure:<br><br>Varying concentrations of colloidal silver(ppm)and bromelain (g/mL)will be tested against pheochromocytoma cells(PC12).Cell viability(cell survival)will be the tested using color-metric methods, using the KC Junior program. A DNA extraction will also be done for determination of apoptosis or necrosis. <br><br>Conclusion:<br><br>Pheochromocytoma cells show the least signs of cell viability with the introduction of 0.1 ppm colloidal silver and 0.1 g/mL bromelain, supporting the original hypothesis. Bromelain is a known protease enzyme and colloidal silver could be tied to silver nano particles;both of these reagents have been studied in medicine but never really studied against cancer, but after mathematical calculations and DNA extractions it is understood that this treatment is an alternative to chemotherapy.

CHITOSAN NANOPARTICLE UPTAKE FOR CANCER THERAPY
Andy Tran
Michael E. DeBakey High School for Health Professions, Houston, TX

Nanoparticles can be harnessed to radically change cancer therapy by serving as customizable, targeted drug delivery vectors. They are capable of dispensing therapeutic agents or genes specifically into malignant cells while sparing healthy cells. siRNA-Chitosan Nanoparticles(CH-NPs) are designed and synthesized for the purpose of inhibiting tumorigenesis by RNA interference. In order to improve therapeutic efficacy, one of the main concerns are how effectively these nanoparticles are internalized into the cells. Since many types of nanoparticles are intended for intravenous administration, understanding how these siRNA Chitosan nanoparticles are affected by blood and serum components are of paramount importance. <br><br> To investigate this issue, a cellular uptake study on HepG2 (Hepatocellular carcinoma) cells was conducted. After applying the CH-NPs to the HepG2 cells, the samples were incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes at varying fetal bovine serum concentrations— 20%, 50% and 80%. Intracellular accumulation of CH-NPs in HepG2 cells in the respective serum concentrations was visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Moreover, Fluorescent Activated Cell sorting was used to quantify the amount of CH-NPs internalized in HepG2 cells, by measuring fluorescence emission from the Cy5.5 fluorescently labeled CH-NPs, in the respective serum concentrations.<br><br> In conclusion, cells incubated in higher concentrations of serum were found to have lower cellular uptake efficiency of CH-NPs. This elucidates that serum proteins have an inhibitory effect on cellular uptake. CH-NPs will have to be improved to achieve therapeutic efficacy in the blood stream. Designs in limiting serum interaction by nanoparticles will be an invaluable asset to further improve uptake of NPs.

ANALYSIS OF THE ANTIBIOTIC PROPERTIES OF THE EPIDERMAL MUCUS OF THE ATLANTIC STINGRAY, DASYATIS SABINA, CONFERRED BY ASSOCIATED BACTERIAL SYMBIONTS
Benjamin Colby Powell
Sarasota High School, Sarasota, FL, USA

To survive in contaminated environments and in microflora-rich seas, estuaries, and riverine systems, elasmobranch fishes have had to evolve efficient host defense mechanisms. Although the capacity of mucus to act as mechanical protection, hydrodynamic lubrication, an anti-parasitic agent, and in osmotic regulation is well established, its potential as a source of novel antibiotic compounds is virtually unexplored. To investigate the role of epidermal mucus in protection against environmental pathogens, samples of mucus from three individuals from a freshwater population of Atlantic stingray, Dasyatis sabina, were obtained and antibiotic properties of mucus-associated bacterial symbionts were examined. This was accomplished through the culture of bacterial symbionts to allow antibiotic producers to effuse their antibiotics. A set of tester strain bacteria were then grown on top of the first cultures, and four zones of inhibition were observed. Growth inhibition was shown to be strongest against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 43300 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 10471. Sixteen symbionts believed to be unique to freshwater Atlantic stingray were selected for identification. Three of these are believed to produce antibiotics. DNA extractions and PCR amplifications of 16S rRNA genes were successful on bacterial symbionts. Phylogentetic placement of bacterial species by means of GenBank BLAST searches against known 16S rRNA genes is currently on going. Results of preliminary searches show the presence of bacteria belonging to genera Shewanella, Flectobacillus, and Staphylococcus.

TO DIGEST OR NOT TO DIGEST?
Karien NaKawn Dixon
Noxubee County High School, Macon, MS

Since many people suffer from indigestion, I wanted to find an inexpensive natural remedy that would alleviate indigestion. I also wanted to discover which anti-acid truly relieves indigestion and find the best way to tell my school population of my findings.<br><br>My first step was to perform a digestion experiment to use for comparison. My results showed that sugar is broken down to form simple sugar and fats when digested from fatty acids, and proteins become amino acids when fully digested.<br><br>My results also showed that when a person is experiencing indigestion, various over the counter remedies can prove effective. Just like enzymes are designed to facilitate the digestion of specific subtrates, these common remedies seem to only assist in relieving indigestion when matched with certain substances. <br><br>According to the experiment, Prevacid changed starch to a simple sugar after overnight contact. This was conducted because the results were similar to amylase when compared to the control. Yogurt appears to have changed starch to a simpler sugar when compared to the control and the results of other substances. Pepto Bismol may have changed the protein to an amino acid. Pepto Bismol may have changed the carbohydrates to a simpler sugar.

CAN LIFE BE EXTENDED?
Geoffrey Clark Thomas
Dixie Middle School, St. George UT, USA

I tested several nutritional supplements that are purported to have beneficial life extending capabilities, on cultures of bakers yeast. Separate yeast cultures were grown in which the medium was enriched with the following compounds: Red wine extract (resveratrol), a liquid multi-vitamin supplement, L-Carnitine, Alpha Lipoic Acid, a combination of Carnitine and Alpha Lipoic Acid, Vitamin E, Vitamin C, Green Tea, and Red wine extract--high dose. The individual cultures were placed in bottles with latex balloons affixed atop. The cultures were observed to first enter a phase of balloon inflation, presumably anaerobic metabolism (Krebs cycle), and then the balloons would deflate and become drawn into the flask with negative pressure as the cultures entered aerobic metabolism. The number of cycles each culture completed was recorded. The results showed a dramatic difference versus control of the Green Tea and the L-Carnitine enriched cultures. A lesser effect was seen with Red wine extract and Vitamin C. A modest effect was noted with Alpha Lipoic Acid and the combination with Carnitine. Interestingly, the Vitamin E culture consumed the least sugar… the culture never went aerobic. At the end of the experiment the vitality of cultures was assess by feeding each culture one additional time and observing the anaerobic growth rate. Three cultures were seen as clearly superior: Green Tea, L-Carnitine, and Vitamin E. <br><br>

THE RECOMBINATION OF RNA BY AZOARCUS RIBOZYME IN A COMPARTMENTALIZED SYSTEM AN ORIGIN-OF-LIFE STUDY
Sergio-Francis Mellejor Zenisek
Oregon Episcopal, Portland, OR, US

Compartmentalization is considered a requirement for life, and has been theorized as playing a crucial role in the origin of biological compounds from abiotic processes. Recently the recombination of RNA molecules has been put forward as a possible mechanism for such a transition to occur, and was demonstrated in a non-compartmentalized system. The goal of this experiment was to demonstrate the recombination of RNA molecules, via the ribozyme Azoarcus, in a water-in-oil emulsion as a compartmentalized system. Emulsions were created by the vortexing of an aqueous solution in heavy mineral oil phase. Various combinations of both unreacted and reacted RNA's were encapsulated in various distributions, were reacted, and then analyzed on 7% polyacrylamide gels. Results supported the conclusion that spontaneous non-fusion content mixing of vesicles occurred, as well as the success of the recombination half-reaction in the compartmentalized system. Possible sources of error include the possible presence of a non-compartmentalized aqueous layer in the emulsion. Degradation of the ribozyme prevented the presence of the product of a complete recombination from being either confirmed or denied.

CANCAARS: A NOVEL THERAPEUTIC TARGET FOR MELANOMA TUMORIGENESIS
Robert Mohamed Bacchus, Jr.
Lincoln Park Academy, Fort Pierce, FL

Melanoma, the malignant growth of melanocytes, is the deadliest and most aggressive form of skin cancer; a lethal reputation that is largely due to its resistance to current anticancer treatments, such as inhibitors of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), the protein regulating melanocyte production. This study presents a new therapeutic target for melanoma by showing, for the first time, the etiological role of lysyl-tRNA synthetases (LysRS) in melanocyte tumorigenesis. As an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS), LysRS’s activity outside of its canonical role in protein synthesis is poorly known. LysRS’s known interaction with MITF, however, presents pathophysiological implications regarding its noncanonical activity. These implications are here elucidated to defend the hypothesis that LysRS is a major regulator of melanoma. X-Ray crystallography was first used to show that phosphorylated LysRS undergoes a structural conformation that enables it to interact with MITF. In a melanoma tumor cell panel, the endogenous levels of MITF and LysRS were determined by immunoblotting. Cells were then transfected with phosphorylated forms of LysRS, and immunocytochemistry was used to confirm that they interacted with MITF. This interaction was observed in real-time using a novel Luciferase-based bioluminescence assay. The binding affinity for phosphorylated LysRS versus wild-type LysRS was then quantified using isothermal titration calorimetry. Suppression of the LysRS-MITF complex resulted in decreased tumor proliferation, confirming that LysRS is a critical regulator of melanocyte tumorigenesis. Future work will develop medical leads targeting LysRS at its phosphorylating site, promising a pharmacologically potent and toxicologically safer treatment for melanoma.

STRUCTURE-FUCTION STUDIES ON HUMAN TELOMERASE
Nitya Kalyani Viswanathan
Acad for the Adv of Sci and Tech, Hackensack NJ, United States

To prevent the loss of important genetic information from one generation to the next, the chromosome ends are capped with regions of non-informational genetic material called telomeres. During the chromosome replication process, DNA polymerase cannot completely copy both ends of the parent strand. Thus, the length of the telomeres is shortened after each round of replication. The cell needs a way of restoring telomere length so it can continue to replicate without losing genetic information. The most common way cells accomplish this is through the activation of the telomerase enzyme complex, which extends the telomeres.<br><br>This project examines the importance of the Motif E region of the telomerase protein, as well as the RNA subunit of the enzyme complex, to enzyme function. To accomplish this, selected amino acids in the Motif E or nucleotides in the RNA subunit were mutated and these mutants were analyzed in functional assays. The Motif E mutations led to enzymes with decreased processivity and in most cases decreased activity. Because Motif E in HIV-1-RT, another reverse transcriptase, acts as a primer grip, we can hypothesize that it may have a similar function in telomerase. The RNA template region mutants had significant differences in stalling patterns, processivity and activity, indicating that this region has considerable influence in the behavior of the enzyme. Mutations in this region may affect the way the template and primer line up, leading to the differences in stalling patterns. Thus these studies have allowed functional roles to be assigned to specific elements of the enzyme complex.<br><br>

ANTIOXIDANT PROTECTION AGAINST VASCULAR CHOLESTEROL-INDUCED INJURY TO VASCULAR CELLS
Christina Josefa van Lier
Hathaway Brown School, Shaker Heights OH, USA

Apoptosis, programmed cell death, consists of multiple pathways that a cell can go through to die by apoptosis and is prominent in arteriosclerosis lesions. Arteriosclerosis is a progressive vascular disease characterized by the accumulation, in the innermost layer of a large artery, of low-density lipoproteins (LDL), oxidized lipids, increased fibrous elements, smooth muscle cells, and macrophages. When low-density lipoprotein becomes oxidized by free-radical oxygen species, the lipid and protein oxidation products change cell behavior from normal to pathological.<br><br>Inhibition of apoptosis initiated by an oxidative stress through the use of a naturally occurring selenoprotein antioxidant known as phospholipids hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx) and the protection provided by the mitochondrial verses the non-mitochondrial isoform of PHGPx was examined.<br><br>Apoptosis was induced using 7-ketocholesterol, a major component of oxLDL, and the effects were assessed by ELISA Activity Assay, DNA laddering, and Caspase 3 Activity Assay. The purpose of this project was to test the hypothesis that enhanced mitochondrial or non-mitochondrial PHGPx could inhibit apoptosis in macrophages exposed to the prominent oxLDL toxin, 7-ketocholesterol.<br><br>Results consistently showed that both the mitochondrial and the non-mitochondrial isoforms of PHGPx equally inhibited 7-ketocholesterol induced apoptosis in U937 cells.

FRA-1 TARGET GENES FOR CANCER INTERVENTION
Brian Jeffrey Pepper
Middletown High School, Middletown, MD, USA

Fra-1 (Fos-related antigen 1) is a member of the AP-1 family of transcription factors. It has been implicated in several types of cancer, notably lung cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer, and has been shown to play a significant role in tumorigenesis. It is activated through the MAPK (mitogen activated protein kinase) pathway. This project explores the role of Fra-1 and its target genes in three colorectal cancer cell lines: HCT-116, SW-480, and RKO. Through the use of luciferase assays, Western blots, and microarrays, the activity of Fra-1 is probed and its potential targets are identified. Fra-1 is found to be constitutively active in RKO cells, while in SW-480 cells, it requires ERK activation to be stabilized. Once ERK is activated by TPA treatment, however, AP-1 target genes become much more active in SW-480s and HCT-116s. In the RKOs, possibly because Fra-1 appears to be constitutively activated, a significant increase in AP-1 activity was not observed. Characterization of Fra-1 activation and its target genes could ultimately aid the development of new cancer drugs and therapies.

THE ROLE OF TESTOSTERONE IN HEPATOCYTE APOPTOSIS IN HIGH FAT DIET-INDUCED NON-ALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE
Kenneth Young-Hoon Lee
Palos Verdes Peninsula High School, Rolling Hills Estates, CA

The goal of this project is to study the role of hepatocyte apoptosis in high fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis and testosterone’s action in the rat HFD-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) model. In the past 20 years, the Western world has been subject to a dramatic increase in obesity. One common manifestation of obesity is NAFLD. Hepatic steatosis (basis of NAFLD) and testosterone deficiency have been shown to be significant risk factors in developing type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. It has been reported that testosterone replacement drastically reduces fat accumulation within the liver. However, the mechanism of testosterone’s protective effect in fatty liver has not been well studied. Apoptosis levels were determined via Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and Western blot.<br><br>For a previous study, male rats were randomly placed into four groups: castrated rats on HFD, castrated rats with T replacement on HFD, intact rats on HFD, and intact rats on regular chow diet (RCD). They were fed for 15 weeks, sacrificed, and liver tissue was collected for apoptosis detection in this study. TUNEL assay directly stained apoptotic cells brown. Western blot evaluated concentrations of cleaved PARP (89 kDa), a common marker for cell apoptosis. <br><br>The results showed that HFD increased hepatocyte apoptosis in intact rats, while testosterone replacement reduced HFD-induced hepatocyte apoptosis in castrated rats. <br><br>It was concluded that testosterone reduces HFD-induced hepatocyte apoptosis in the liver, and this study may forge a path toward developing methods to eventually attenuate NAFLD.

EXAMINING INHIBITION OF VITAMIN ABSORPTION TO ANALYZE DIFFERING RATES OF NUTRIENT TRANSPORT
Cynthia Rita Torma
Oxford High School, Oxford, MS

Affected by certain factors in molecular structure and chemical composition (most notably the presence of functional groups such as the methyl and hydroxyl groups), the water solubility of a given vitamin determines the pathway employed by the body to most effectively absorb, utilize, and, in the case of fat-soluble vitamins, store the vitamin. Cystic Fibrosis, amid other various diseases, causes an inhibition of the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins into the lumen of the small intestine, due to a denser mucin layer lining the organ. In this study, the diffusion rate of both water – soluble and fat – soluble vitamins was tested in differing concentrations of collagen, emulating the progress of the vitamins in the mucin layer in order to establish if, and to what extent, the difference in concentration of mucin would cause a contrast in rates of absorption of fat – soluble vitamins and water – soluble compounds in affected versus unaffected individuals. Using a curve fitting program to best fit initial values of the sigmoidal function to the program’s exponential function, it was determined that the change in the rate constant, k, displayed a significant difference in diffusion rate of water – soluble vitamins between concentrations, establishing a distinctive inhibition of these compounds through higher concentrations of the layer and demonstrating the disruptive nature of higher concentrations of the layer on essential compounds of various biochemical behaviors.

THE HYPE ON HYPERTENSION!

Angiotensin II (AngII) is a potent vasoconstrictor that stimulates cell contractility by upregulating contractile proteins. To induce cell contractility, AngII should affect vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC)–extracellular matrix (ECM) interaction. This interaction is mainly mediated through integrin cell adhesion receptors, alpha8 integrin being one of them. Alpha8 integrin is involved in vascular smooth muscle cells’ contractile state. Therefore, it was hypothesized that AngII-induced contractile state in VSMCs might be mediated by alpha8 integrin. <br><br> siRNA was used to knockdown alpha8 integrin. VSMCs were cultured in separate wells with AngII stimulation, siRNA, AngII and siRNA, and media solution (controls). The cells were harvested after incubation. The Western Blot Analysis was performed. Through the addition of antibodies, the presence of calponin, being a contractile marker was measured by determining the band intensity resulting from the gel electrophoresis. The average band intensity of the cell extracts stimulated with AngII was 2.71 times more than the controls while the average band intensity of those stimulated solely with siRNA-alpha8 integrin was 3.04 times less than the controls, and the combination of AngII and siRNA-alpha8 integrin resulted in an average band intensity 1.37 times less than the controls. In conclusion the results demonstrated that AngII-induced upregulation of calponin was impaired in the absence of alpha8 integrin. While the hindrance of AngII signaling is a therapeutic goal in hypertension treatment, the acquired data suggests that alpha8 integrin gene silencing might be a novel target to reduce vascular tension.<br><br>

EXAMINING INHIBITION OF VITAMIN ABSORPTION TO ANALYZE DIFFERING RATES OF NUTRIENT TRANSPORT
Cynthia Rita Torma
Oxford High School, Oxford, MS

Affected by certain factors in molecular structure and chemical composition (most notably the presence of functional groups such as the methyl and hydroxyl groups), the water solubility of a given vitamin determines the pathway employed by the body to most effectively absorb, utilize, and, in the case of fat-soluble vitamins, store the vitamin. Cystic Fibrosis, amid other various diseases, causes an inhibition of the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins into the lumen of the small intestine, due to a denser mucin layer lining the organ. In this study, the diffusion rate of both water – soluble and fat – soluble vitamins was tested in differing concentrations of collagen, emulating the progress of the vitamins in the mucin layer in order to establish if, and to what extent, the difference in concentration of mucin would cause a contrast in rates of absorption of fat – soluble vitamins and water – soluble compounds in affected versus unaffected individuals. Using a curve fitting program to best fit initial values of the sigmoidal function to the program’s exponential function, it was determined that the change in the rate constant, k, displayed a significant difference in diffusion rate of water – soluble vitamins between concentrations, establishing a distinctive inhibition of these compounds through higher concentrations of the layer and demonstrating the disruptive nature of higher concentrations of the layer on essential compounds of various biochemical behaviors.

FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS OF YEAST GENE NOP14: PHASE II
Elizabeth Germino, Immaculata High School
Somerville, New Jersey, USA

The object of this year’s research was to determine the molecular basis of the temperature-sensitive phenotype for the mutant NOP14 constructed last year, as well as that of the high-copy suppressor, to provide insight into NOP14’s essential functions (including ribosome biogenesis, a role determined for Nop14 by Liu and Thiele [2001]). To test if the ts Nop14 had an altered localization at the nonpermissive temperature, ts Nop14 was fused to EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) and the location of Nop14 examined. Unexpectedly, cells expressing the NOP14-EGFP construct failed to display any green fluorescence, although those containing a control construct did. This suggests that the fused protein is either poorly expressed or rapidly degraded. A study by Gavin, et al.(2002), indicated that Nop14 is found in a multimeric protein complex. To explore whether the temperature-sensitive mutation affected Nop14’s interaction with this protein complex, both wt and ts Nop14 were fused with a modified TAP (tandem affinity purification) gene. These tagged proteins were purified by affinity column chromatography. The first sets of purification were uninformative due to extensive proteolysis, and so repeat experiments using different conditions are underway. Preliminary experiments to have both Nop14 and Ypr144c, the isolated high-copy suppressor, tagged in the same cells are also being pursued with a novel tag using strepTactin. This should reveal what binds to Ypr144c independently of Nop14, giving a better understanding of the role of Ypr144c in the formation of the 40S ribosome subunit.

USING THE INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF ATP ANALOGS TO REGULATE MRNA PROCESSING: YEAR II
Carol Yoon Joo Suh
Palos Verdes Peninsula High School; Rancho Palos Verdes, CA; United States

Overexpression of genes is a common characteristic of many cancers. For example, studies have shown that overexpression of the Brain and Acute Leukemia, cytoplasmic (BAALC) gene contributes to Acute Myeloid Leukemia. mRNA processing is a key regulatory event for gene expression. An enzyme involved in mRNA processing, polyadenylate polymerase, has been found to be overexpressed in a variety of tumor cells, mainly in breast cancer. Finding a way to regulate this overexpression could reduce the viability of the tumor. In order to understand the regulation of mRNA processing, a highly efficient in vitro coupled processing system has recently been created in our lab. During the development of this system, it was suspected that Cordycepin triphosphate (3dATP), an ATP analog, inhibited cleavage and polyadenylation of the RNA. This inhibitory effect implied that ATP might play an important role in regulating mRNA processing. <br><br> To assess the role of ATP in mRNA processing, ATP analogs 3dATP and Ara-ATP were inserted into both coupled and uncoupled processing systems. It was found that inhibition of processing was specific to ATP analogs. 3dATP inhibited processing up to 25uM, and Ara-ATP decreased processing efficiency by 43.5%. <br><br> Results suggested that ATP analogs bind at an allosteric site, thereby inducing a nonfunctional conformation that prevents processing. Therefore, ATP plays an important role in mRNA processing by interacting with proteins on the processing apparatus. Using ATP analogs to inhibit cleavage and polyadenylation and in turn repress protein translation may regulate the overexpression of proteins involved in cancer.<br><br>

Jeannette Sanchez
Andrews High School, Andrews, TX

This project is examining the effects of coffee consumption of humans beta amyloid plasma levels and short-term memory.The test subjects were categorized in two groups coffee drinker and a control group of non-coffee drinkers ages ranging from 35-60, the coffee drinkers have consumed 3-5 cups of coffee a day for at least 15 years.<br><br> Observing the data using IBL-America Human beta amyloid (1-x) "total amyloid" there was no significant difference between coffee drinkers and non-coffee drinkers beta amyloid plasma levels. However,using the Mann-Whitney Test to compare coffee drinkers and non-coffee drinkers the results are reported as z=.09 and is approaching significance.<br><br> Using a CERAD-Neurological Assessment Battery, short term memory differences of coffee drinkers and non coffee drinkers was shown not to be significant.<br><br> In conclusion, the hypothesis that coffee drinkers will have higher beta amyloid levels in the plasma, indicating improved short term memory and reducing the risk of dementia and Alzheimer was not supported by this data ,although further research is warranted with a larger test group.

MEXICAN LIQUORS
Aneli Chavez Sanchez
Franco English School, Mexico D.F.

This project is the result of a study of the losses in the production of fruit crops in Mexico. These losses have been enormous due to many and different reasons, that caused fruits lack of the quality necessary for exportations. As important then to look for a form to diminish these losses. At the beginning it was thought that the best option was to obtain the prime matter or spoiled fruit that was considered a waste and turn it into a more durable product. This would be a fruit liquor, because the conditions and resources were available to us. It was done an analysis in the process of fermentation to assure the stability in the quality of product.<br><br>The tests done were:<br><br>1.-Elaboration of the liquor with corn syrup and common sugar, which got to be the best for this process.<br><br>2.-This process of fermentation could be apply to all fruit, so it was made with citric fruits, grains, berries, and fruit of thin peel.<br><br>The general results were:<br><br>*A right consistency or body.<br><br>*And an agreeable color.<br><br>An advantage is that you can control the degrees in the amount of alcohol you put in each kind of liquor.<br><br>3.-We did a marketing study and as a result, I found out that my product could compete abroad with the same quality. This product can be manufactured with a very simple infrastructure.

CHARACTERIZATION OF MUS81/MMS4'S ROLE IN HOMOLOGOUS DNA REPAIR DURING S-PHASE MITOTIC CELLULAR DIVISION
Shamsher Singh Samra
Clovis West High School, Fresno, California, United States

The Mus81/Mms4 heterodimer is a highly conserved member of the XPF endonuclease superfamily and part of the Rad52 epistasis group, which is known to serve a large role in recombinational DNA repair. Previous extraction of Mus81/Mms4 for in vitro experimentation has varied based on the protein host and has differed in conclusions about the proteins' function. The direct isolation of the Mus81/Mms4 heterodimer, along with its respective mutant, from a native eukaryotic host, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, provides the fundamental tool necessary for understanding the Rad52 epistasis group of proteins as well as a better understanding of DNA repair synthesis. <br><br> Mus81/Mms4 nuclease assays, using sequenced protein complemented to the wild type, reveal the structure specific endonuclease displays a penchant for cleaving the 3’ Flap of ssDNA-dsDNA junctions. The findings suggest Mus81/Mms4 serves to maintain stability in stressed replication fork elongation, and not to resolve the four-way Holliday Junction resulting from homologous DNA fork repair, as is suggested by the current model of DNA repair synthesis.<br><br> Understanding Mus81/Mms4's in vivo substrate preference assists in developing a strong understanding of the structure-specific endonuclease’s role and biochemical interactions during S-Phase cellular division. The fact that cells lacking the Mus81/Mms4 heterodimer are highly sensitive to carcinogens, suggests the possibility of a homologous understanding of failures in cancer averting mechanisms. By better comprehending the components and processes of DNA repair synthesis during cellular division, we may be in a better position to pinpoint the failed mechanisms attributed to tumor formation and cancer development.<br><br>

TUMOR SUPPRESSOR GENE DBC2 PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN PROTEIN TRANSPORT
Faith Kan Chang
Syosset High School, Syosset, New York, USA

DBC2 (Deleted in Breast Cancer 2) is a novel tumor suppressor gene capable of killing breast cancer cells. A better understanding of DBC2 function would provide new insight into future modalities. Previous studies imply that DBC2 is involved in cell-cycle regulation, apoptotic pathways, cytoskeleton assembly and membrane trafficking. DBC2’s role in membrane trafficking was elucidated by monitoring the reporter protein Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Glycoprotein (VSVG) tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) in live cells. Disabling the DBC2 protein hindered protein transport from the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) to Golgi apparatus. It was discovered that DBC2 transportation is disrupted when microtubules are depolymerized by nocodazole. The findings indicate that DBC2 plays a role in connecting vesicles to microtubule motor systems, a process which warrants further investigation.

EFFECTS OF FATTY ACIDS ON SKELETAL MUSCLE PROLIFERATION AND DEVELOPMENT
Anji Li
Pioneer High School, Ann Arbor, MI

Studies show fatty acids have important roles in the human body, aiding cognitive development and other human functions. I investigate how fatty acids affect skeletal muscle proliferation and muscle fiber formation, namely in the C2C12 cell line. This is important not only for athletes, but also for the elderly who tend to lose muscle with age. I treated C2C12 cells with three different fatty acids: docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), oleic acid, and palmitic acid. I hypothesize that DHA, an essential fatty acid with many positive effects on the human body, will promote the greatest muscle prolferation and development. I first examined cell proliferation by treating C2C12 cells for 24 hours with a 100 micro-molar concentration of each fatty acid and 10% FBS growth medium. Using a hemocytometer, the oleic acid consistently proved to yield the highest cell count. From this, I conclude that oleic acid promotes the greatest muscle proliferation. Next, I examined muscle fiber development by treating the cells for one week with a 50 micro-molar concentration of each fatty acid and 2% horse serum growth medium, which is known to promote muscle fiber formation. I took pictures under the microscope and found that the DHA formed the most massive muscle fibers. More quantitative results were obtained by examining relative myosin heavy chain gene expression through qPCR. Results show that the palmitic acid yielded the highest MHC expression while the DHA yielded the lowest. I conclude that DHA promotes muscle mass while palmitic acid promotes the formation of muscle fibers.

CAN BIOSENSORS DETECT PESTICIDES AND HERBICIDE RESIDUES IN OUR TRIBAL PONDS?
Anna Lopez
Coolidge High School, Collidge, AZ, USA

Can Daphnia and lettuce seed bioassays be used to test tribal riparian water systems for pesticide and herbicide residues? Most healthy ponds in the United States have Daphnia living in them. Since Daphnia are very small crustaceans they are a major food source for both young and adult freshwater fish. Literature on Daphnia states that they are extremely sensitive to metal ions like copper and zinc, pesticides, detergents, bleaches and other dissolved toxins. <br><br>Lettuce seed is also referenced as being very sensitive to herbicides. With this information, a hypothesis was developed stating that lettuce seeds and daphnia organisms will be effective biosensors in determining toxicity from pesticide and herbicide residues in water samples. <br><br>Water samples were collected from four tribal ponds and placed in four one-gallon glass jars, a total of 16 samples for each test. Twenty Daphnia were added to each jar. After 4 weeks each sample was counted. Lettuce seed was divided into 16 Petri dishes with 25 seeds in each dish. Each pond sample had four Petri dishes with a total of 100 seed. To each dish 2 ml of pond water was added and placed in a small indoor greenhouse. Germination was counted in each dish after five days. <br><br>Daphnia died in water samples from three out of four ponds. In samples from the fourth pond the Daphnia population grew rapidly. The germination study did not show any evidence of herbicide residue. Additional tests would be needed for more accurate data. <br><br>

EFFECT OF NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC SUBSTANCES ON TRANFORMATION OF DUMP INTO DTMP
Oksana A Sergeeva
Torrey Pines High School, San Diego, California, USA

Thymidylate synthase (TS) is the enzyme that catalyzes the transformation of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) into deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP) in cells. In cancer cells, TS is overexpressed. While usual drugs treat cancer by inhibiting TS, the New-Biotics' drug is a substrate of TS that produces toxic products upon TS activation. Inside the cells the drug is transformed into bromovinyl deoxyuridine monophosphate (BVdUMP), a substrate for TS. Both dUMP and BVdUMP reactions require certain thiols, although other thiols inactivate TS, as researched in previous project. The natural reaction requires methylene-tetrahydrofolate (CH2-THF), but the BVdUMP reaction does not. The effect of different natural and synthetic compounds on TS was studied to mimic its intracellular BVdUMP activation during chemotherapy. To do this, different concentrations of CH2-THF were used while changing the concentrations of BVdUMP and dUMP. It was found that BVdUMP and dUMP are competitive substrates, so BVdUMP appears to act as an inhibitor for the natural reaction. It was also discovered that the higher the concentration of CH2-THF, the less the effect of the BVdUMP on the dUMP reaction. It was concluded that at higher CH2-THF concentration, BVdUMP is bound less tightly to the enzyme, meaning that they have mutually exclusive binding sites on the enzyme. The irreversibility of TS inactivation by BVdUMP was also studied, and it was discovered that for the first 30 minutes the inactivation is reversible and does not harm the enzyme. The inactivation of TS by BVdUMP becomes irreversible over time. When CH2-THF is present the irreversible inactivation of TS by BVdUMP is not as extreme as in its absence. In this way, CH2-THF also acts as a protector against irreversible inactivation of TS by BVdUMP. This research helps reveal the optimal conditions for the drug inside the body. The results have been submitted for a publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

THE EFFECT OF BIOENHANCERS ON THE RATE OF BIODEGRADATION OF CRUDE OIL
Osvaldo Andres Cossio
Parkview Arts and Science Magnet High School, Little Rock, AR

Various methods can be used to clean-up the oil that is spilled into the ocean surface such methods include chemical, physical, and biological. In this particular research the biological method known as Bioremediation was used. In this study, the relationship between NPK bioenhancers concentration and the rate of biodegradation of crude oil was evaluated based on the change in mass of crude oil. The gravimetric analysis technique was utilized to calculate the percent degradation of crude oil. Both an analytical balance and rotary evaporator were required to obtain the data. It was found that the increase concentration of the NPK bioenhancer correspond with an increase percentage of biodegradation; therefore, corresponding with an increase in the rate of biodegradation of crude oil. The results also suggest that the phosphorus and nitrogen component of the fertilizer applied are more significant to the bacteria than the potassium nutrient since this resulted in a higher percent degradation of crude oil, thus suggesting that phosphorus and nitrogen are critical for bacterial growth.

3D STRUCTURAL PHYSIOLOGY OF IMMUNE SYNAPSES AS DETERMINED BY ELECTRON TOMOGRAPHY AND COMPUTATIONAL IMAGE ANALYSIS
David Aaron Germain
Winston Churchill High School, Potomac, Maryland, USA

Information about infectious agents is transmitted in the immune system through a region of specialized cell contact termed an “immune synapse” [IS]. One type of IS forms when T lymphocyte antigen receptors recognize foreign peptides presented on a dendritic cell [DC]. Synapse generation entails remodeling of opposing cell membranes, changes in surface protein distribution, and relocalization of cytoskeletal components such as actin. These events have been studied primarily by light microscopy [>100 nm resolution] and many molecules involved in IS formation have been analyzed by x-ray crystallography [0.2 nm resolution]. This leaves an information gap that prevents direct linkage of molecular structure with biological function. To provide a more detailed mechanistic understanding of the IS, this project uses emerging methods of electron tomography to analyze T-DC interactions at mesoscale (2 – 100 nm) resolution. Improved methods of manual and semi-automated computational image analysis [segmentation] were developed to aid in data interpretation. Thin sections of chemically fixed CD4+ T cell - DC conjugates yielded tomograms showing opposed plasma membranes with variable spacing, possibly representing microclusters of plasma membrane proteins with distinct heights. Collections of F-actin-like filaments were present in some regions of the IS. New methods of high-pressure freezing and freeze-substitution have been employed to better preserve IS architecture and provide material suitable for higher resolution, serial section data collection for 3D reconstruction of entire synapses. These results are being integrated with functional studies and confocal imaging data to produce a multiscale understanding of the structural physiology of immune cell communication.

INVESTIGATING THE ROLE OF NUP98/96 IN DROSOPHILA SPERMATOGENESIS
Yuting Patrick Chiang
The Wheatley School, Old Westbury, New York, United States

Adult stem cells are relatively unspecialized cells that divide mitotically throughout the lifetime of an organism to produce both new stem cells as well as highly specialized cells of the respective tissue. Despite the importance of stem cell divisions, little is known about the mechanisms and molecules that regulate and implement this highly important cell-biological process. I investigated this process by studying Drosophila male germ line stem cells that were mutant for the nup96/98 locus and that failed to undergo proper mitotic divisions. The nup98/96 locus encodes two nucleopore proteins: Nup98 and Nup96. The molecular evidence I collected suggests that the defects seen in the mutant are due to a lack of the Nup96 protein. Genetic and molecular analyses suggest that the Nup96 protein may play a role in nuclear envelope breakdown. I observed that nup98/96 mutant cells were irregularly shaped, displayed uneven tubulin-distribution, formed abnormal mitotic spindles, and exhibited cytoplasmic and nuclear budding. Most importantly, the nuclei of nup98/96 mutant cells that failed to divide were still intact during the abnormal cell divisions.

THE IDENTIFICATION OF MOLECULAR MARKERS LINKED TO MORPHOLOGICAL MARKER GENES IN SEVERAL VARIETIES OF BARLEY
Megan M Wolf, Mandan High School
Mandan, North Dakota USA

There are more than 1000 morphological marker genes identified in barley and less than half have been located to a chromosome. Only a small portion of that half has been mapped to a specific chromosome site.<br><br>This study was conducted to determine whether morphological markers in barley were linked to specific molecular markers in barley. If linkage was found, it was then possible to map the linkage on the coordinating chromosome.<br><br>The first step was to score F2 plants segregating for morphological marker traits. To obtain the molecular markers, DNA was extracted from each F2 plant. The DNA was then used as a PCR template for the molecular markers. Once the PCR was complete, samples were separated using gel electrophoresis. Pictures were taken so the molecular markers could be scored and compared with the morphological markers.<br><br>Linkage was found with three populations: cer-ym, dsp.ba and pyr.ai. Cer-ym is located within 17 cM of Bmag0353 on chromosome 4H, dsp.ba is located with in 15.4 cM of Bmac0067 on chromosome 3H, and pyr.ai is located within 11.2 cM of Bmac0067. None of these morphological genes had been previously mapped in barley chromosomes. This information will to be helpful to geneticists as they manipulate genes to develop barley with improved agronomic and quality traits.<br><br>

NOVEL ALGORITHMS FOR SURFACE PLASMON RESONANCE DATA PROCESSING IN A PARALLEL MULTITASK ENVIRONMENT
Lauren Joyce Cohen
Montgomery Blair High School, Silver Spring, MD, US

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) allows for the real-time study of the structure and function of biological molecules at surfaces. Novel computational methods were developed to improve the speed and accuracy of an SPR multi-channel imaging technique. Two algorithms for finding minima of SPR reflectivity curves and the corresponding change in thickness of an observed biolayer – a fitting of the curve to a polynomial and a mathematical function of a differential ratio between two integrals of the curve – were programmed, used to analyze sets of simulated data, and compared with theoretical results. The polynomial algorithm was found to be more accurate for changes of less than 100 Å, while the integral algorithm was more accurate for larger shifts. The integral method was also up to 250 times more precise and displayed an almost eightfold increase in speed over the polynomial method. Differences between the theoretical kinetic curve and that produced by the polynomial method were attributed to the design of the simulation. Both are to be further tested under actual experimental conditions.

THE EFFECT OF TNF-ALPHA CONCENTRATION ON CANCER CELL PATHWAYS
Jessica Li Tse
Somerville High School, Somerville, MA, USA

The purpose of this project was to determine whether the concentration of TNF-alpha would affect which pathway a cell would undergo, specifically survival and apoptotis pathways. The idea came from the dual functions of TNF-alpha. The hypothesis for this project was that increasing concentrations of TNF-alpha would increase the cleavage of Procaspase-8, a protein associated with apoptosis.<br><br> Lewis Lung carcinoma cells and B16-F10 melanoma cells (all murine) were cultured in dishes and subjected to TNF-alpha treatments with concentrations: 1ng/mL, 10ng/mL, and 100ng/mL, with RPMI media as the control. Afterwards, the cells were quantified using a viability assay (Trypan Blue exclusion assay) and an apoptosis assay (DAPI staining). The cells were later lysed, which allowed access to intracellular proteins. <br><br>To detect the presence of target proteins, the SDS PAGE gel and Western Blot were used. The SDS PAGE gel is the preliminary step to Western blotting, which transfers the protein samples onto the gel based on the size. The proteins on the gel were transferred onto the nitrocellulose membranes and were blocked with primary antibody for the target proteins. The target proteins were phosphorylated-AKT (associated with cell survival), caspase-8 (associated with apoptosis), and B-tubulin (positive control). The membranes were later blocked with secondary antibody, which will be treated with horseradish peroxidase, an enzyme that breaks down a certain substrate. The secondary antibodies attached to the primary antibodies, the substrate then reacted with the enzyme and chemiluminescence occurred, allowing for detection of proteins once the film was developed. The Western blot and viability and apoptosis assays showed the cells entering different pathways based on the TNF-alpha dosages.<br><br>

ISOCHORE ANALYSIS OF ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA CHROMOSOMES
Jennifer Yin Yee Kwan
Vincent Massey Secondary School, Windsor, Ontario, Canada

This project entails the identification of high gene density locations within the five chromosomes of the model biological plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. Attention has been focused on the GC-isochore (region within a genome sequence occupied dominantly by guanine (G) and cytosine (C) bases) of a chromosome, since G+C content is known to have positive correlation with gene density. Thus, by determining the boundaries of the GC-isochores and their sub-regions, gene locations are likely to emerge. Challenges exist in the analysis of a genome sequence due to its noise. In this project, wavelet analysis is adopted for denoising the genome sequences of Arabidopsis thaliana. Through wavelet analysis plots, displaying the G+C content of the plant chromosomes, the boundaries of the GC-isochores can be better defined than techniques without wavelet denoising. In addition, enlargements of wavelet denoised GC-isochores can reveal clear boundaries among its sub-regions, thereby indicating different levels of G+C content within each isochore. By identifying the sub-regions with a higher G+C content, the search for major gene locations could be narrowed. This wavelet technique, which has been used on the Arabidopsis thaliana plant for determining the boundaries of the sub-regions within the GC-isochores of the chromosomes, could be extended to AT-isochores, centromere-isochores, and unassigned regions to find other noteworthy gene locations within the genome. This is an emerging technique which has never been applied to the Arabidopsis thaliana plant and could be used to reveal new genes of potential interest in other species in future research.

SYNERGISTIC CYTOTOXIC EFFICIENCY OF NOVEL AND TRADITIONAL ANTI-CANCER DRUGS IN A PARALLEL/CROSSOVER MODEL
Mukund Raguram
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland, OR

The purpose of this experiment is to test for potential synergy between novel and traditional anti-cancer drugs. Docetaxel, a traditional anti-cancer drug, was used as a comparison. Aspirin is known to have anti-inflammatory properties, and curcumin has anti-mitotic properties, but all three drugs influence the pro-apoptotic NF-KappaB gene in cancerous cells. Aspirin and curcumin share influence of various oncogene pathways, while docetaxel acts as a tubular poison and Bcl-2 inhibitor. Combinations of drugs should increase efficiency and reduce the likelihood of acquired chemoresistance.<br><br>Solutions at the MIC and twice the MIC for each compound were prepared and 10 µL of each solution in combinations according to the checkerboard method were introduced to colon cancer cells. Three trials of each combination and a control were performed. After incubation for 48 hours, cells were split and counted with an automatic counter.<br><br>Results were positive. Aspirin/docetaxel displayed synergy at all concentrations. Curcumin/docetaxel and aspirin/curcumin displayed synergy only at twice the MIC. This could be due to either cooperative influence or compounded effects based on signaling pathways affected by each drug in a parallel/crossover model.<br><br>Future applications include targeted liposomal drug delivery of synergistically efficacious compounds. Potential implications this project are improved efficiency, lowered costs, and reduced toxic effects of chemotherapy.

LOCATING VP1 STRUCTURAL PROTEIN IN ADENO-ASSOCIATED VIRUS SEROTYPE 2/8’S MOSAIC CAPSID
Chelsea Lousie Rence
Sarasota High School, Sarasota, Florida, United States

Adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotypes currently under development for use in gene therapy are highly dependent upon the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) function of their VP1 capsid protein for infectivity. Adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (AAV2) displays the most effective PLA2 and by incorporating its VP1 unique region into a mosaic virus, an improved rate of infectivity can be observed. Despite the fact that 3D structures are available for several AAV capsids, the location of the essential VP1 unique region that contains the PLA2 domain is still unknown. <br><br>In this research mosaic adeno-associated virus serotype 2/8 (AAV2/8) viral capsids were purified from infected Sf9 insect cells. Characterization was performed using SDS-PAGE, phast gel, western, and electron microscopy. Structural analysis was performed by x-ray diffraction and a difference map to locate the VP1 protein and therefore the possible domain of PLA2 within the capsid. This research resulted in the accumulation some of the first data on AAV2/8’s capsid and the first ever clinical crystallization of AAV2/8, which gives insight on its optimal crystallization conditions. The difference map resulted in some AAV2/8 electron densities not matching the standard structure of AAV8 giving evidence as to a possible location of VP1 within AAV2/8’s mosaic capsid. Further research is needed to find optimal crystallization conditions and to obtain a higher resolution difference map.<br><br>

COMPARISON OF THE ELECTROLYTIC CONDUCTIVITY OF NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL SOFT DRINKS
Ambika Murali
Leone High School, Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA

Electrolytes are minerals needed for the normal functioning of human body. The purpose was to compare electrolytic conductivity (EC) of drinks used in American Samoa to know the mineral levels. The question was which juice used in American Samoa had the highest EC? I hypothesized that artificial orange juice had higher EC since it was highly citric. Two experiments were conducted, first with a voltmeter and second with an EC meter. First experiment was to determine EC of artificial drinks, including artificial orange juice. A controlled test was performed using distilled water. Each drink was tested ten times using a voltmeter and average current (I) in amperes was determined and converted to conductance (G) in Siemens using equation, G = I/V. Artificial orange juice had the highest EC, with an average of 7.4 mS/cm. Second experiment was conducted on juices including natural apple, orange, lemon and coconut juices using an EC meter that gave results directly in mS/cm. Natural coconut juice had the highest average EC of 7.554 mS/cm and purified water had 0 mS/cm. An experimented on coconut samples from different locations showed a highest average of 8.40 mS/cm for a particular variety of coconut juice. First test’s hypothesis that orange juice will have highest EC proved correct. The same hypothesis for the second test where coconut juice also was included proved to be wrong establishing that coconut juice had highest EC. Research indicated that coconut juice as the best replacement for the electrolytes that human body loses.

SMARTGEN SIRNA LIBRARIES: BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN RNAI TECHNOLOGY AND HUMAN GENE THERAPY
Josh M Silverman
North Shore High School, Glen Head, NY USA

Currently, there is a lack of a safe, specific and effective method for the inhibition of gene expression. However, a promising new process called RNA interference has been identified which operates at a 1 in 1,073,741,824 (4^15) specificity. It acts through the incorporation of 21 nt short interfering RNA (siRNA) into a protein complex called RISC which enables the siRNAs to guide the annihilation of complementary mRNAs, thus inducing gene silencing. Recent studies in mice have showed more than 90% in vivo knockdown of brain cancer. The process shows extreme promise towards the treatment of many other fatal diseases such as Lou Gehrig’s, Diabetes, AIDS, Hepatitis as well as in improving organ transplant procedures and human metabolism. The two problems separating RNAi technology and it’s application are a lack of delivery system and poor design methods, that is, synthetic siRNAs generally don't bind to their target well enough to be useful in gene therapy. <br><br> This project describes a combinatorial approach utilizing a system of subsequent restriction enzyme digests which results in the formation of hundreds of silencing length nucleic acid sequences. The fragments are then ligated into miRNA precursors suitable for inclusion in inducible expression systems. Essentially, the project solves the long-standing problem of siRNA design and more importantly, opens up the application of RNAi based gene silencing in the treatment of human genetic disease.

Riverdale High School, Jefferson, LA, 70121, USA.

The purpose of this project was to find out if the eyestalks of crab control the activity of stress enzymes. The hypothesis was if the eyestalks of this crab were removed then glycolysis is impaired. As a compensatory mechanism gluconeogeneis takes place. Then the activity of the two key enzymes GOT and GPT increase. Crabs are maintained for 7 days and divided into five groups of 12 each. Group’s I, II, III and IV were 3, 5 and 7-day eyestalk ablated (removed) animals. In GroupV the 7 day ablated animals were injected with 2 eyestalk extracts. 5% tissue homogenate of muscle and hepatopancreas of each animal was subjected to the following procedure: For GOT add 1.0 ml sigma prepared substrate (for GPT 1.0 ml of alanine Alpha KG substrate) then add 0.2ml supernatant from muscle or hepatopancreas. Shake gently, leave in a waterbath for 1 hour (GPT 30 mts). 20 mts later add 1.0 ml sigma color reagent followed by 10 ml of 0.4 N NaOH. Leave for 5mts and read the absorbance at 500 nm against blank. Prepare a calibration curve where a known amount of enzyme activity is tested. The activity of GPT and GOT in muscle and hepatopancreas in Groups I, II, III and IV increased significantly (ANOVA p<0.05) and returned back to normal in Group V. The conclusion was in the absence of eyestalks GOT and GPT activity increased. Hence the eyestalks in this crab must contain a hormone that controls their activity thus controlling gluconeogenesis.

Theoretical and experimental designs combining biotechnology and computational sciences have demonstrated new methods of analyzing and computing information by using organic molecules. Multiple designs of such systems have been applied to the resolution of large scale combinatory problems such as the famous Hamilton Path problem. This project focuses on the development of a new type of DNA computer for biological applications and the demonstration of the concept by applying it to resolve the antibiotic resistance genotype of pathogenic fungi Candida albicans (C.A.). For instance C.A. resistance to azole treatment relies on two genes: the CDR1/2 (Candida Drug Resistance) complex and the MDR1 (Multiple Drug Resistance). In a normal cell only CDR1 is expressed at a basal level. Expression of either of the two genes leads to specific types of antibiotic resistance.<br><br>This system, like all computers, is comprised of three intercommunicating modules. The input, which transforms the presence or absence of target mRNA in presence or absence of DNA strands the computation module can interpret, is based on competitive hybridization. The computation module combines the information from multiple input modules into one data by the formation and restriction of hairpin molecules. Lastly, the output module, using Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer, provides a response dependent on the data received from the computation module. This design is generic; the sequence of the computer’s oligonucleotides is independent of that of the analysed genes. This system, if combined with a micro-fluidic platform, could provide a high throughput, cost-efficient assay to screen for specific genotypes.<br><br>

THE NEUROPROTECTIVE EFFECT OF MORPHINE ON PESTICIDE INDUCED CELLULAR MODELS OF PARKINSON'S DISEASE
Suraj Hitendra Rambhia
Jericho High School, Jericho, NY

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic, neurodegenerative disorder that affects approximately one million people in the United States. Scientists believe that it is caused through a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Surprisingly, laboratory rats suffer from symptoms that mimic those of PD when exposed to the widely used pesticide rotenone. Rotenone induces neuronal apoptosis by stimulating H2O2 production, which significantly alters mitochondrial membrane potential. For these experiments, human neuroblastoma cells were exposed to rotenone (30nM), in vitro, for 48 hours to simulate PD. Experiments involved observing the effects of morphine, a neuroprotective opiate alkaloid, against rotenone. Literature indicates that morphine was shown to significantly increase cell viability during heavy metal oxidative stress. Current experiments show that morphine does enhance cellular viability significantly in a dose dependent manner. After exposure to rotenone, 45% of cells were viable. Pretreatment of cells for 20 minutes with 1uM and 5uM morphine produced no increases in cellular viability after exposure to rotenone. However, cells that were pretreated with morphine for 24 hours before administration of rotenone did, have a significant increase in cell viability (p < 0.010). Cells treated with 1uM morphine retained 65% viable cells, whereas cells treated with 5uM morphine retained 75% viable cells, after 48 hours. Gene expression studies show increased levels of expression of the MOR and NMDAR1 receptors during 24-hour pretreatment with 5uM morphine and subsequent administration of 30nM rotenone. As these results indicate, further tests need to be carried out to fully understand morphine neuroprotection.

IDENTIFICATION OF A GUARD CELL ENHANCER TRAP LINE OF ARABIDOPSIS
Laura Lee Wayne
Skaneateles High School, Skaneateles NY, USA

Guard cells play an important role in regulating water use efficiency. The importance of guard cells is to maintain the balance between carbon dioxide intake and water loss. The objective was to isolate a line showing reporter gene expression specifically in guard cells and identify this sequence of DNA involved in stomatal function of Arabidopsis thaliana. Seven thousand two hundred enhancer trap tagged A. thaliana lines were screened for reporter gene activity. Using the GenomeWalker™ Kit, DNA libraries were constructed and analyzed by PCR methods. A guard-cell-associated (GCA) line was isolated and sequenced upstream from the enhancer trap vector. Isolating a GCA line will aid in the understanding of stomatal physiology. <br><br>

THE BEST OVER THE COUNTER MEDICINE AGAISNT HEARTBURN
Zelwyn Zadiel Figueroa-Bravo
S.U. Epifanio Estrada Aguada, Puerto Rico

The objective of this investigation is to find out the best medicine against the heartburn caused by an uncomfortable feeling of burning up toward the neck or due to gastro esophageal reflux disease. This project is the result of chemical experimentation with a change in acidity from the addition of different antacids to a white vinegar medium. The first stage of the experiment was to determine which medium compared, in its acidic property, with the gastric acids of the stomach. Then, determine the antacid that had a higher rate change in pH value in comparison with the initial lecture of the acid vinegar. <br><br> Acidity is measured by the pH scale ranges from 0 to 14. Substances with a pH between 0 and less than 7 are acids. Substances with a pH greater than 7 and up to 14 are bases. In the middle, at pH = 7, are neutral substances. The pH meter was used to determine the value of the solutions tested. <br><br> By adding different over the counter antacids, (tablets, liquids and chewables) the difference in the pH value of the solution was determined to evaluate the best regarding the decrease on the acidity (or increase in the number given by the pH meter). The higher difference in the pH result determined the effectiveness of the antacids. Also the time in which the antacid changed the pH was used as an effectiveness measurement. The final result in the investigation revealed that Antacid D is the best medicine against heartburn.<br><br>

REGULATION OF TELOMERE LENGTHS DURING STEM CELL DIFFERENTIATION
Anneke Ellen Schwob
Boston Latin School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA

Telomeres are sequences on the ends of chromosomes that act as protective mechanisms during cell division. It was previously shown that in the brain, telomeres were longest in areas containing primarily fully differentiated (non-dividing) neurons, suggesting that telomere length regenerates after neurons stop dividing. Telomere regulation was then examined as neural differentiation was actually occuring by using a stem cell line (P19s) in vitro. It was hypothesized that the longest telomeres would be found after differentiation was complete. <br><br>P19s were induced to differentiate into neurons with retinoic acid and genomic DNA was isolated at different stages of differentiation. A real-time PCR assay was used to amplify telomeres and compare them to a single copy gene to find how relative telomere length changed. Next, telomerase activity was measured using a PCR-based TRAP(telomere repeat amplication protocol) assay. <br><br>Average telomere length decreased by 15-fold during differentiation, but increased once differentiation was completed. Telomerase activity remained constant throughout differentiation. The results indicate that neurons regulate telomere length during differentiation and maintain both telomeres and telomerase activity afterwards. This suggests that in neurons, telomeres and telomerase may have functions other than their conventional roles of protecting chromosomes during cell division.

SCREENING OF NOVEL DRUGS FOR THE TREATMENT OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
Annika Mulaney
International Baccalaureate School at Bartow High School, Bartow, FL

Alzheimer’s disease is a degenerative neural disorder and the most common form of dementia. Alzheimer’s disease usually occurs in one of two ways: when the protein beta-amyloid builds up and acetylcholine is destroyed, or when the protein tau builds up abnormally and forms neurofibrillary tangles. <br><br>This project was designed to test 10 drug extracts on cells using the drug screening process to look for a reduction in the buildup of tau. <br><br>C3 cells infused with tau were treated for 24 hours with 10 undisclosed drug extracts or a vehicle control. Samples were harvested and protein estimation was performed. Polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the samples and they were loaded onto a gel. The Western blot technique was used for transferring protein bands from the gel to two membranes. A milk solution was used to block the membranes and primary tau antibody was applied. After overnight incubation, the membranes were washed three times with Tris-Buffered Saline and Triton (TBST), and the secondary antibody containing Horseradish peroxidase enzyme was added. The membranes were washed again with TBST. An enhanced chemiluminescence reagent was used to develop signals from a film.<br><br>Drugs B8, C1, C2 and C3 showed reductions in the tau level, drug D5 showed no change, and drugs B6, C9, and D1 showed a slight increase compared to the control. In order make reasonable conclusions on the effects of various drugs on tau level in human cells in vitro, repeat experiments are needed. So far 10 drugs have been screened; hundreds more remain.

STUDY OF THE E-COLI AND FECAL COLIFORMS PARAMETERS IN THE COASTAL WATER OF YABUCOA
Juan Yomar Abreu-Velazquez
S.U. Jesus Sanabria Cruz, Yabucoa, Puerto Rico

The purpose of this study was to determine how the concentration of Escherichia Coli and Fecal Coliforms affected the quality of the coastal waters of Yabucoa.<br><br> Research about the E-Coli and Fecal Coliforms has demonstrated that water quality is affected by these contamination agents. The hypothesis for this research was that a concentration of E-Coli and Fecal Coliforms higher than two colonies per milliliter (2 cl/mL) of water, decrease the water quality of the coastal zone of Yabucoa.<br><br> For this research the coast of Yabucoa was divided in approximately three equal parts: “Playa Guayanes”-(Y1) “Playa Lucía ”-(YII) and “Playa El Cocal (la Posita)”-(YIII). Five consecutive samples taken every fifteen minutes, were collected at each sampling point. Coliscan Easygel Solution was used to detect the presence of E-Coli colonies and Fecal Coliforms. Five mL of Coliscan Easygel were mixed with one mL of the sample water for each of the fifteen samples. From this mixture, one mL was placed in each of the 15 petri dishes with an agar medium. After 48 hours in the incubator, the pink and purple colonies in each of the petri dishes were counted.<br><br> The compiled and analyzed data reflected a high concentration of E-Coli and Fecal Coliforms colonies in the coastal zone of Yabucoa. The E-Coli and Fecal Coliforms concentration exceeded the established standard of the Environmental Quality Board of Puerto Rico which was 2cl/1mL (200 colonies/100 mL). The water quality was not acceptable for a beach. The hypothesis was accepted.<br><br><br>

A NEW WAY TO SEND DNA
Jenna Rae Parisien
Turtle Mountain Community High School, Belcourt, ND USA

Sending DNA to other places requires expensive and detailed protocols. Sending DNA for research, pre-clinical, clinical and commercial applications can cost companies up to one hundred dollars per shipment. High cost is sometimes caused by the dry ice that is needed to keep the DNA cold and the extra care that needs to be taken because of shipping DNA.<br><br> The purpose of my project was to find a cheaper, more cost effective way to send DNA from one place to another. The method I proposed to use was to run the DNA through an ink-jet printer, print the DNA on paper and then send the DNA using regular mail.<br><br> My procedure involved draining an ink jet cartridge of all its ink, mixing DNA of various dilutions with the ink, adding the ink back into the cartridge, then printing the DNA with the ink on a piece of paper. After the DNA is sent through the mail, the DNA is then transformed off the paper. Through my experimentation, I found that the DNA can survive the process of being added to ink, being printed and being sent through the mail.<br><br> My conclusion is that by adding DNA to ink from an ink-jet printer and printing the DNA on paper, you can send DNA through the mail, thus providing a new method to send DNA that is much more cost effective.

INFLUENCE OF THE GREEN TEA POLYPHENOL EGCG ON MACROPHAGE INFLAMMATORY FUNCTION
Iddoshe Haile Hirpa
duPont Manual Magnet High School, Louisville, KY, United States of America

Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is the most biochemically active polyphenol of green tea. Green tea has been used for thousands of years in traditional Asian medicine. This study addressed EGCG’s effect on the production of inflammatory proteins, specifically those produced during the CD154 ligand-CD40 receptor interaction. This interaction is characteristic of autoimmune responses. <br><br> In one autoimmune disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), these inflammatory proteins can lead to inflammations in the brain called scleroses. These scleroses lead to the degeneration of the central nervous system and contribute to the debilitating symptoms of MS. These inflammatory proteins also influence the development of other inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease. <br><br> It was hypothesized that EGCG would reduce the production of the inflammatory proteins. In order to produce these proteins, viable murine macrophages (100,000/well) were plated with CD154 expressing Chinese Hamster Ovary cells (100,000/well). The cells were incubated for 24 hours with EGCG at concentrations of 50, 25, 12.5 and 0µM. Cell supernatants were collected and then assayed for inflammatory protein production using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. <br><br> The data supported the hypothesis. EGCG significantly reduced inflammatory protein production. At the 50µM level, the EGCG reduced MCP-1 production by 72% and IL-6 production by 87%. At the same concentration, it reduced TNF-alpha production by 85%, IFN-gamma by 89%, and IL-12 by 97%. These findings indicate that EGCG may be helpful to sufferers of multiple sclerosis and other chronic inflammatory diseases. <br><br>

CONTROLLING GENE EXPRESSION THROUGH RNAI GENE THERAPY
Matthew John Woloszyn, Oak Ridge High School
Conroe, TX (USA)

The essence of this project is to test the theory of RNAi (RNA Interference) to inhibit the expression of desired genes in e.coli. This was achieved by utilizing synthetic dsRNA fragments to silence gene activity responsible for allowing the bacteria to proliferate on lactose and galactose mediums.<br><br> This was achieved through a series of complex laboratory protocols and delicately designed parameters: The project involved growing and isolating plasmid DNA from e.coli cultures, using restriction digests and ligation procedures to insert custom designed dsRNA "mock" oligonucleotides into plasmids, transformation of products onto growth medium and staining procedures, the use of gel electrophoresis and various analytical tools to evaluate the progress of the research, and delivery of final triumphant results.<br><br> The success of this project was not contingent upon perfect results, but proving a vital theory for the progression of gene therapy and cancer research. The RNAi gene inhibition theory successfully suppresses gene function in bacteria, and will soon revolutionize biotechnology as the protocol becomes available for eukaryotic cells to have the same results. RNAi effectively, and secretly performs gene inhibition without the subsequent apoptosis of the cell, and does so more elegantly than any procedure thus devised. This research, in more advanced prospects, presents both a very profitable concept to biotech and biomedical firms, and an invaluable asset to society as the death and suffering under the shadows of cancer, AIDS, and mental disabilities will eventually be eradicated with the same principles presented in this project.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF OPEN GRAZING ON BOS TAURUS LACTATION
Douglas Gilchrist-Scott
Hoover High School, North Canton, Ohio, USA

Found in two forms, Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) offers an abundance of possible positive side effects. There are two, however, that are viewed as the most consistent and well investigated. Cis-9 Trans-11 CLA has been shown to have anticarcinogenic effects, particularly in mammary tissue, while Trans-10 Cis-12 CLA reduces overall body mass. The only known natural sources of these fatty acids are ruminant animal products. They are formed by symbiotic bacteria living in the digestive tract (Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and Megasphaera elsdenii) during the saturation of linolenic and linoleic acids.<br><br> The purpose of this study was to investigate correlations between fresh pasture diets and their effect on CLA levels in milk. Two Holstein dairy cows were selected from a local herd and milk samples were taken during each step of a dietary progression from all hay and silage to simply fresh pasture and back. The milk samples were then taken to the OARDC where the milk fat was methylated and run through an HP gas chromatograph, and, using the areas under the peeks, a percentage distribution of fatty acids was calculated for each sample.<br><br> After analyzing the data, it was found that increased time on pasture increased both forms of CLA and unsaturated fatty acid levels, while it decreased saturated fat amounts. T-tests were performed comparing each experimental condition to the control and a one-way standard analysis of variance was run within each experimental condition between the cows. According to this analysis, all the changes seen were shown to be significant and there was no significant difference between the cows. Thus the research completed suggests that the consumption of unskimmed, or partially skimmed, milk from freshly grazed cattle yields the greatest health benefits. For further research, investigation of other types of dairy cattle could result in greater CLA augmentation.<br><br>

THE SEARCH FOR PF-9 RECOMBINATION MAPPING OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Namita Bisaria
Webb School of Knoxville, TN, USA

This project was a culmination of the strategic crossing of Drosophila melanogaster, or fruit flies, to locate a region on chromosome three where the nondisjunctional mutation, Pf-9, resides. This experiment uses the fact that during meiosis, chromosomes take part in crossing over. Crossing over is a function of a gene’s distance from the centromere; this function was used to create the first chromosome maps. With this knowledge the location of pf-9 can be found.<br><br> The main obstacle in this experiment is that a chromosome is an incredibly large area when thought of by gene. To overcome this, intervals of the chromosome were created using phenotypic markers. Fourteen different phenotypes were chosen. The overall goals of this procedure was to create flies that had the mutation, a variety of recombinants, and a balancer to keep further crossing-over from occurring. The end of this crossing scheme produced a “count” of the number of flies that had nondisjunction compared to the flies that did not for each phenotype. <br><br> After looking at the data or "count" of the experiment and comparing the regions denoted by the phenotype markers, the conclusion was that the mutation was in the vicinity of the marker curled, right outside the hetero-chromatin. However, there was the added complication that five of the phenotypes turned out to be lethal, meaning there is a meiotic mutant either close to or connected with pf-9. These results also gave light to a theory that the candidate gene of pf-9 could be rad-21, a gene that causes non-cohesion and is also located in the hetero-chromatin.<br><br>

IMPROVING THE ORAL ABSORPTION OF CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC DRUGS THROUGH THE USE OF NOVEL NANOPARTICLES
Priyanka Rajasree Narayan
Wayzata High School, Plymouth, MN

Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, and currently <br><br>treatment requires patients to receive chemotherapeutic drugs intravenously, which is <br><br>both inconvenient and expensive. Oral administration of chemotherapeutic drugs, like <br><br>doxorubicin, would be convenient, but cannot be easily done, due to poor absorption of <br><br>the drug by the human gastrointestinal tract. I hypothesized that encapsulating <br><br>doxorubicin in sodium alginate-AOT nanoparticles may increase the permeability of <br><br>doxorubicin through the gastrointestinal tract. In order to test this, nanoparticles were <br><br>synthesized, loading and release studies were conducted, and finally, tests on the <br><br>permeability of the nanoparticles containing doxorubicin versus the free doxorubicin over <br><br>MDCK cells were completed. <br><br>The results of this experiment showed that nanoparticles containing doxorubicin <br><br>were able to permeate across the MDCK cell monolayer two times more efficiently than <br><br>the free drug alone. With further in vivo studies, nanoparticle-encapsulated doxorubicin <br><br>could be delivered orally to patients, which would be extremely useful for the medical <br><br>industry in terms of cost as well as efficiency.

THE EFFECT OF PLANT POLYPHENOLS AMELIORATING OXIDATIVE STRESS IN NGF-BETA DIFFERENTIATED PC-12 CELLS
Daniel Tse
David H. Hickman High School, Columbia MO, USA

Strong evidence exists for the role of oxidative damage in the cytopathology of Alzheimer’s disease, a leading cause of death for people over the age of 65. Nerve Growth Factor (NFG)–differentiated Pheochromocytoma-12 (PC-12) cells were used to (1) study cell death processes after treatment with oxidative stressors H2O2 and menadione and (2) the ability of curcumin and resveratrol to ameliorate the cell death process induced by oxidative stress. Plant polyphenols where able to ameliorate oxidative stress placed on NGF-differentiated PC-12 cells. This study was successful in applying the use of the lactate dehydrogenase-assay, dichlorofluerencain-Elisa assay, and morphological observation to assess oxidative damage to cells and demonstrated therapeutic and preventative qualities of resveratrol and curcumin for protecting cell injuries in disease involving oxidative stress.

THE EFFECT OF ALOE VERA AND SPATHODEA CAMPANULATA (AFRICAN TULIP) EXTRACTS USED AS PESTICIDES ON NASUTITERMES COSTALIS(TREE TERMITES).
Danelvis Paredes
University Gardens High School, SanJuan, PR

This research investigates which concentration of Aloe vera and Spathodea campanulata(African Tulip) would be more effective as a natural pesticide on Nasutitermes costalis (tree termites). This research provides a natural alternative to using toxic pesticides. It was expected that the application of a 100% concentration of Spathodea campanulata extract would be more effective than Aloe vera extract as a treatment to exterminate Nasutitermes costalis. Three treatments were made in this experiment. There were four samples for each treatment, except in treatment A. A 100% concentration of commercial termite exterminating pesticide was applied to treatment A to compare it with the effectiveness of the natural treatments. Each sample had 20 live termites in a Petri dish. Different concentrations of Aloe vera were added to each sample: 100% concentration to sample 1B, 75% concentration to sample 2B, 50% concentration to sample 3B and a 25% concentration to sample 4B. Treatment C was worked in the same way, but using a Spathodea campanulata extract. Samples were classified as 1C, 2C, 3C, and 4C. Treatment A with commercial pesticide had the most dead termites, but a difference between that sample and sample 1B with Aloe vera was minimal. On treatment C a lesser quantity of dead termites resulted in each sample. The hypothesis was not proven because an application of 100%concentration of Aloe vera produced more dead termites than treatment with Spathodea campanulata extract. Nevertheless the investigation proved that, Aloe vera can be used as a natural alternative to using toxic pesticide.

THE LIGANDS SLIT2, SLITL2, AND THEIR PUTATIVE RECEPTORS ROBO1 AND ROBO4 ARE SELECTIVELY EXPRESSED IN HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELLS
Stephanie Jinyu Yaung
Leland High School, San Jose, CA, USA

For continual blood cell replacement in adults, a small number of hematopoietic, or blood-forming, stem cells (HSC) migrate between the bone marrow and circulating blood. Although a vital process, little is known about these movements and only a handful of factors have been identified. Recent research has shown that the Slit protein family and their receptors Roundabout (Robo) have similar effects as repellants or inhibitors of migration in various cell types. The study investigated whether Slit/Robo interaction would also have an effect on HSC migration.<br><br>Experiments involved the secreted proteins Slit1, Slit2, and Slit3, the membrane-bound protein Slit-like2 (SlitL2), and the receptors Robo1 and Robo4. Quantitative real-time PCR runs detected selective expression of Slit2, SlitL2, Robo1, and Robo4 in HSC. Most notably, Robo1 and Robo4 were differentially expressed at several-fold greater levels in HSC than in other hematopoietic populations, indicating that Slits may indeed play a larger role in HSC migration. Therefore, migration assays were performed to determine Slits’ effects on HSC migration. In transwell plates, live cells were placed in the upper chamber and allowed to migrate through the membrane and into the lower chamber containing the protein of interest. Cells were collected from the bottom chambers and analyzed on a FACS machine. The data suggested that while Slits alone had no noticeable effect on hematopoietic cell migration, Slit2 did inhibit HSC migration towards stromal cell-derived factor-1ALPHA (SDF-1ALPHA) by 50%, a clinically important finding for bone marrow transplantations because SDF-1ALPHA is a chemoattractant in HSC mobilization and homing.

MICROARRAY ANALYSIS REVEALS GLUCOCORTICOID-REGULATED SURVIVAL GENES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH INHIBITION OF CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED APOPTOSIS IN BREAST EPITHELIAL CELLS
Shamita Chaudhuri
Lincoln Park High School, Chicago, Illinois, USA

Activation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) results in diverse physiological effects depending on cell type. For example, glucocorticoids (GC) cause apoptosis in lymphocytes but can rescue mammary epithelial cells (MECs) from growth factor withdrawal-induced death. However, the molecular mechanisms of GR-mediated survival remain poorly understood. In this study, a large-scale oligonucleotide screen of GR-regulated genes was performed. Several of the genes that were found to be induced 30 minutes following GR activation encode proteins that function in cell survival signaling pathways. I also demonstrated that dexamethasone pre-treatment of breast cancer cell lines inhibits chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in a GR-dependent manner and is associated with the transcriptional induction of at least two genes identified in this screen: serum and glucocorticoid-inducible protein knase-1 (SGK-1) and MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1). Furthermore, GC treatment alone or GC treatment followed by chemotherapy increases both SGK-1 and MKP-1 steady-state protein levels. In the absence of GC treatment, ectopic expression of SGK-1 or MKP-1 inhibits chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, suggesting a possible role for these proteins in GR-mediated survival. Moreover, specific inhibition of SGK-1 or MKP-1 induction by introduction of SGK-1- or MKP-1-siRNA reversed the antiapoptotic effects of glucocorticoid treatment. Taken together, these data suggest that GR activation in breast cancer cells regulates survival signaling through direct transactivation of genes encoding proteins that decrease susceptibility to apoptosis. Given the widespread clinical administration of dexamethasone prior to chemotherapy, understanding GR-induced survival mechanisms is essential for achieving optimal therapeutic responses.

INTERFERON-ALPHA 2B: TARGETING THE STAT1 PATHWAY AND MINIMIZING BREAST CANCER AND LEUKEMIA CELL PROLIFERATION
Andrea Shao-yin Li
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Alexandria, VA

Among numerous treatments that have been adopted in an attempt to treat cancer, interferons are significantly and uniquely advantageous by targeting progenitor cells, sometimes even curatively resulting in sustained remission. Interferon has been approved to treat leukemia but not breast cancer. The purpose of the first phase of this project was to determine the role of interferon-alpha in MCF7 breast cancer and HL60 leukemia cell proliferation. After a 72-hour incubation period and an XTT cell proliferation assay, the results indicated that higher interferon concentrations significantly decreased breast cancer proliferation; according to this data, interferon treatment on breast cancer was even more effective than on leukemia. Surprisingly, the leukemia cell data resembled a parabolic curve, with the cell proliferation increasing after a certain concentration threshold. These findings indicate that a unique and optimal concentration of interferon treatment exists for distinct types of cancer, above which concentration, treatment efficacy may decrease. Taking this project a step further, the effect of interferon on the expression of the anti-proliferative STAT1 pathway was examined. An ELISA detecting phospho-STAT1 (Tyr701) activated by interferon, and total STAT1, demonstrated that this negative feedback pathway may be desensitized at high interferon levels, resulting in decreased efficacy of treatments above the concentration threshold. This experiment provides compelling support for the use of interferon in breast cancer treatment and seeks to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in this anti-proliferative response. On a larger scale, interferon treatments, both current and novel, for other cancers should be examined and optimized in the future.

USING DROSOPHILA GENE TRAPS TO EXPLORE THE GENOME
Nahathai Srivali
Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, Baltimore, Maryland, USA

I studied Drosophila (fruit fly) gene regulation, using a novel method that simplifies this normally difficult task. Future breakthroughs in the fields of biology and medicine require knowledge of what genes do, not just their DNA sequences. Studying gene regulation –the tissues and situations in which genes become active– provides critically important clues. Recently, a method called the protein trap strategy has been developed at the Carnegie Institution to speed up this task. By attaching a gene encoding a fluorescent marker called green fluorescent protein (GFP) to a mobile gene transposon and inserting it at random into the fly genome, the activity of a single tagged gene into which it inserts becomes visible. This strategy can be applied to thousands of genes simply by doing genetic crosses. I carried out two projects to help optimize this technique.<br><br> However, my major interest was observing gene expression in real time. I recognized that Drosophila larvae are translucent, and thus, one could observe gene expression in the internal organs of a living animal. To begin, I recorded where more than 200 different genes are expressed. This required photographing Drosophila larvae under a fluorescent dissecting scope, dissecting, and identifying the labeled tissues. I studied three particularly interesting lines to determine if their marked genes respond to changes in the environment. One of these, Ferritin, increased in amount in response to environmental iron. This preliminary data encourages us to believe that cheap and easy-to-use environmental sensing devices might someday be based on gene traps.

THE EFFECTS OF DIABETES ON CD4+ T-LYMPHOCYTES
Deepa Mokshagundam
duPont Manual High School, Louisville, Kentucky, USA

Over 18 million people in the United States alone suffer from Diabetes Mellitus and suffer from a variety of diabetes related complications. Abnormalities in T-lymphocytes, a subset of white blood cells, have been implicated in several diabetes related complications. <br><br> It was hypothesized that as the glucose level increased, proliferation of the lymphocyte cell would also increase. However, when the cells are introduced to increased amounts of glucose, they will also become sensitized to dangerous substances, resulting in greater cell death. It was also hypothesized that high glucose would result in changes in Interleukin-2 (IL-2), a protein that regulates the proliferation of T-Lymphocytes.<br><br> Jurkat cells were cultured for 24 hours in increasing concentration of glucose. Viable cells were counted using a Trypan Blue assay. The effect of sensitizing T-lymphocytes with increasing concentrations of glucose was studied by first growing Jurkat cells in different concentrations of glucose for 24 hours followed by addition of either tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and phytohemagglutnin (PHA) for 6 hours. Again viable cells were counted. Interleukin-2 secretion was measured at different concentrations of glucose, with and without PHA. <br><br> The results showed that lymphocyte proliferation was maximum at 25 mM glucose concentration. At this concentration there was decrease in viable cells after exposure to PHA and TNF alpha, suggesting activation induced cell death. There was a decrease in IL-2 secretion from 11 mM to 33 mM glucose concentrations. This suggests at role for glucose in affecting T-lymphocyte function and merits further study.<br><br>

Problem Statement<br><br>Is it possible to induce quorum sensing upon a sample of dinoflagellates through the introduction of chemical substances?<br><br>Hypothesis<br><br>I predict that I can induce a glow, not only through mechanical stimulation (as was demonstrated in my 2010, 2011 experiments), but through the introduction of chemical substances as well.<br><br>Conclusion<br><br> <br><br>Was my hypothesis correct?<br><br>Yes, my hypothesis was correct. Dinoflagellates do react to the introduction of certain chemistries. The isototocin and sea water had the least effect on the sample of dinoflagellates. The acetic acid and the isopropanol alcohol had the greatest effect on the sample, however, the alcohol also destroyed the cell walls killing all the organisms in the sample. The hydrogen peroxide did not have much of an effect either and the carbonated water only had a slight effect on the dinoflagellates.<br><br> <br><br>How would I improve this experiment in the future?<br><br>In the future, I would like to expose the dinoflagellates to other substances with a focus on sugars and amino acids. These substances did not damage the cells.

KINASE PATHWAYS INVOLVED IN CANNABINOID INHIBITION OF NF-KB
Anand Baxi
White Station High School, Memphis TN, USA

Kinase pathways involved in cannabinoid Km-II-43’s inhibition of NF-kB were studied. Cannabinoids are chemical compounds that are known to have various medical uses such as anti-inflammatory, pain relief, and treatment of AIDS. NF-kB is a transcription factor found in the cytoplasm of a normal animal cell; NF-kB is bound to its inhibitor IkB. However, when bacteria and various other injurious stimuli enter the cell, NF-kB is released from its inhibitor, allowing it to travel into the nucleus. Inside of the nucleus, NF-kB up-regulates pro-inflammatory mediators such as COX-2. But when cannabinoids are used to treat the cells, the level of NF-kB is lowered, in turn, lowering the level of inflammation. <br><br> The cells used throughout the duration of this project were A549 lung epithelial cells. One of the most common diseases is pneumonia. Pneumonia is defined as the inflammation of the lungs. Cannabinoids could be one of the keys to finding a cure for pneumonia, for cannabinoids lower inflammation. <br><br> Though the effect of cannbinoids is known, the mechanism of the cannabinoids is unknown. There are various kinase pathways through which the cannbinoids could travel. Two major kinase pathways were tested in this experiment: MEK1/ERK and p38 MAP kinase. Two compounds, PD98059 and SB203580, were used to block MEK1/ERK and p38 MAP kinase, respectively. <br><br> The results show when SB203580 is added into the cells alongside with Km-II-43, the level of NF-kB rises back up to its normal level (without Km-II-43). This shows that SB203580 blocks the pathway of Km-II-43, p38 MAP kinase. <br><br>

James F. Byrnes, Duncan, South Carolina, United States

The purpose of this experiment is to determine which catalyst will speed up the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide the fastest. Cut each catalyst (carrot, banana, russet potato, red potato, turnip, red apple, stew beef, and calves' liver)into one centimeter cubes. Measure 250ml of 3% hydrogen peroxide and pour into 270ml baby bottle. Measure the mass of hydrogen peroxide with the baby bottle and nipple using a balance scale. Measurements were 281grams; with each trial this measurement must be kept the same. Drop cubed catalyst into prepared bottle of hydrogen peroxide and close tight with lid, containing its nipple. Submerge upside down into a 12ounce glass jar filled with water. Time experiment one hour. Remove catalyst, use balance scale to measure the mass of remaining hydrogen peroxide contained in the bottle. To find mass of gases subtract the remaining amount of hydrogen peroxide from the beginning amount (281grams). Do procedure 4 times each on each of the catalyst food products. Test hydrogen peroxide in baby bottle (281grams) turned upside down with nipple submerged in 12ounce glass jar of water without using a catalyst. (control group) Record data. The experiment showed the calves' liver accelerated the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen the fastest: with an average mass of gases of 225.860grams. The calves' liver proved to be the strongest catalyst out of the food products tested.

A novel method for creating randomized control sequences for genomic analysis in bioinformatics is presented here. Current controls such as nth-order standard Markov models are based upon the properties of the entire genome, which is not necessarily reflective of the original genomic complexities. In order to provide a more precise basis for comparison, an algorithm is introduced which bases the random sequence on a sliding window which transverses the genome. This preserves some regional genomic characteristics while maintaining a degree of random variation. <br><br>Frequencies of homopolymeric runs in the C. elegans genome produced by this Guided Localized Method (GLoM) are demonstrated to be a closer fit to the original genome than a random sequence or a standard Markov model. At the same time, the analysis provides support for experimental work regarding the preferential repression of long A/T runs (greater than or equal to 8nt) as compared to C/G runs in the genome. It is envisioned that GLoM will provide a simpler, less computationally intensive method of creating control sequences for holistic and localized genome analysis.

Anthocyanins are strongly associated with reducing the incidence and progression of many chronic diseases including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and prostate cancer. Most plants carry all the genes required for the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway, but they are expressed mainly in young leaves and flowers. <br><br>Amongst citrus, only blood red oranges are rich in anthocyanins. The mature fruits become dark red if the weather turns cold. To understand the basis of color development, expression of 12 genes in two pigment biosynthetic pathways was studied. Fruits of eleven important horticultural citrus varieties with blood red, pink, orange and white flesh colors were collected at four time points from October to February and their anthocyanin levels were measured. Relative expression levels of 12 genes from two pigment biosynthetic pathways were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction using Agilent and ABI machines. Gene expression levels in different samples were analyzed using the delta Ct method and the change in expression over time measured by the delta delta Ct method. <br><br>Development of red color was associated with a rapid rise in expression levels of four genes from the anthocyanin pathway. Orange and pink fruits showed increased levels of expression of certain carotenoid genes while white fruits showed very little change in expression of all 12 genes studied during maturity. <br><br>Understanding the molecular basis of color development would be a vital first step to engineer nutritionally beneficial anthocyanins in our daily food. The future goal of this project is to bioengineer anthocyanin rich citrus fruits.

THE GLUCOSE DEPENDENCE OF CD4+ T-LYMPHOCYTES
Rebecca Joy Vitale
duPont Manual High School, Louisville, Kentucky, United States

T-lymphocytes sometimes attack necessary body cells, causing autoimmune disease. This study investigates whether restricting glucose can affect T cell survival. It was hypothesized that T cells could be controlled by withholding glucose. The spleens of two mice were provided: both had been exposed to an antigen and one had been treated with an adjuvant. Treatment with antigen + adjuvant models a normal immune response, while treatment with antigen alone models an abortive T cell response. 106 cells/well were plated on a 96-well plate. The cells were treated with equal amounts of 30 µM 2-NBDG (a fluorescing analog of the non-metabolizable glucose poison 2-deoxyglucose, or 2-DOG) at different time points up to four hours. Adjuvant-treated cells took up significantly more glucose than the antigen-only-treated cells. This shows that adjuvant-treated cells take up more glucose.<br><br>To test glucose dependence, cells were treated with increasing concentrations of 2-DOG up to 100µM. These experiments showed that, while 2-DOG does have a negative effect on all cells, the adjuvant-treated cells survived at a significantly higher rate than those exposed only to the antigen. The resting (non-activated) cells maintained a consistent viability regardless of 2-DOG concentration. <br><br>In the third experiment, purified T cells were treated with increasing concentrations of glucose to 11 mM. The experiment showed that antigen + adjuvant treated cells survive significantly better on lower concentrations of glucose than antigen-only treated cells. It was concluded that cells in an immune response are glucose dependent, but less so than those in an abortive immune response. Glucose poisoning could be explored in the future as a mechanism for T cell inhibition in autoimmune disease.

THE EFFECTS OF CAFFEINE ON SHORT TERM AUDITORY MEMORY
Natasha Lee Hoover
Aiken High School, Aiken SC, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine what effects, if any, caffeine has on short term auditory memory. This experiment was prompted by curiosity about the effects of caffeine on memory. It was hypothesized that a moderate dose of caffeine would enhance short term auditory memory within an hour of ingestion.<br><br> Each student listened to the a set of words, using headphones so that other students could not hear the words. Immediately after listening to them, the student was asked to write down all the words he/she remembered. The student was then given 12 oz of Diet Mountain Dew to drink. After 30 minutes the student was tested again, using different words, and once again asked to write down the words he/she remembered. This process occurred at 45 minutes after the caffeine was given, and again after an hour had passed. All of the students tested listened to the word sets in a different order. This helped to eliminate the possibility of students remembering more words after an hour because the words were easier.<br><br> Results supported the hypothesis. Only one student had a personal best number of words remembered before drinking the Diet Mountain Dew. Eight students had a personal best number of words remembered during trial two. If caffeine had no effect, there should have been approximately equivalent numbers of students with a personal best for each trial. This and other data indicates that caffeine does improve short term auditory memory within an hour of ingestion.

COMPUTATIONAL EXPLORATION OF PROTEIN FUNCTION
Anugraha Mahalakshmi Raman
Dover-Sherborn High School, Dover, Massachusetts, US

Rather than using in vitro or in vivo biochemical techniques this research systematically developed enhancements to existing in silico bioinformatic techniques in order to analyze and predict with increased accuracy those parts of proteins most important for its function. The key contribution of this research is the increased accuracy in identifying important functional locations in the proteins. For the twelve proteins that were studied more than 75% of their important functional locations (domains) could be determined accurately using the proposed functional pre-bias approach.<br><br>Using manually curated proteins in the Swissprot protein knowledgebase via the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics ExPASy proteomics server, this research examined one set of seventeen control group organisms and, a subset of five organisms selected via biological function pre-bias (in addition to phylogenetic distance considerations.) The research proved that for each of the proteins, greater than 75% of their important functional locations are determined accurately using the proposed approach. For the specific sets studied, a 60-100% increase in accuracy level was observed. Validation was done using 3-D analysis of the protein structure (NCBI Cn3D tool) and the PROSITE database of protein families and domains. <br><br>The composition of the control group organism sets determined the degree of accuracy of the conserved regions across the multiple species. The method developed was more accurate than predictions using just the pair-wise alignment or uniform phylogenetic distribution-based approaches. This research contributes a systematic repeatable methodology that can be automated in the future to provide upwards of possibly 95% accuracy.

MUTAGENIC BYPASS PATHWAY INVOLVED IN THE EUKARYOTIC CELLULAR RESPONSE TO ANTICANCER DRUG RESISTANCE
Jeffrey Zhaoke Fei
Ward Melville, Setauket, NY, USA

Cancer cells are becoming increasingly resistant to chemotherapeutic drug treatments partially through their ability to reverse the effects of DNA-damaging agents. In this study, the alkylating agents mechlorethamine (MEC) and its mono-functional complement 2-chloroethylamine (CEA) were applied to isogenic derivatives of Saccharomyces cervisiae strains compromised in different DNA damage-repairing pathways to assess in vivo processing of DNA adducts. Assays for nitrogen mustard-induced cytotoxicity gave surprising results. As expected, compromising the pathways for nucleotide excision repair (NER) and recombination repair (RR) severely impaired cell survival. However, in contrast to current theories on DNA repair pathways, compromising the repair pathway translesion synthesis (TLS) contributes significantly to cell survival ratio. Multiple cytotoxicity assays show that the TLS-compromised cells actually have a significantly higher survival rate then their corresponding wildtype cells (WT) when exposed to high concentrations of CEA. Furthermore, measurements of forward mutation frequencies suggest the inhibition of the TLS pathway reduces the mutation rate, compared with the WT. These results are not seen with exposure to MEC, the more commonly used anticancer drug, however, the concentrations of MEC used were lower than CEA, and the survival rate plateaued at 10%. Cells exposed to CEA showed similar results at low concentrations but at high concentrations an almost 50-fold difference between the TLS-compromised and WT survival rates were seen. These data suggest that the TLS pathway may be important for the development of stronger and more effective anticancer drugs.

USE OF ALPHA AND BETA CRYSTALLIN IN ERROR PRONE PCR MUTAGENESIS TESTING
Galen Isadore Lieberman Brown
John Adams High School, South Bend, IN

Alpha-crystallins are proteins responsible for helping to maintain the structure and clarity of the lens of the eye, and are responsible for chaperoning other crystallin proteins. They normally last around 40 years before becoming denatured, so determining how to make more resilient crystallins would be desirable. The goal of this project was to produce a new form of human alpha-A-crystallin with increased resistance to oxidative stress by using directed evolution. Initially, plasmids containing the gene for wild type alpha-A-crystallin and beta-A3-crystallin were inserted into E. coli. The E. coli successfully synthesized both crystallin proteins, and the proteins’ identities were confirmed by denaturing SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis. Beta-A3-crystallin was then purified by nickel-NTA affinity chromatography. Wild type alpha-A-crystallin gene was mutated with error-prone polymerase chain reaction. The alpha-A-crystallin gene was digested but ligation to a known mutant autotransporter gene was unsuccessful, possibly due to the host bacteria that were used or the ligation procedure. The end goal of was to produce E. coli cells which express mutant forms of alpha-A-crystallin fused to the autotransporter, effectively causing the protein to be expressed on the cell’s surfaces. These cells could then be treated with an oxidizing agent, hydrogen peroxide, and then tested for their ability to bind to beta-A3-crystallin. Those able to retain their binding abilities at high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide would then be cultured and sequenced to determine the causal mutation.

THE EFFECTS OF AMPHIPATHIC ESTERS OF TICRYNAFEN ON INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE
Ishani Sud
The North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, Durham, North Carolina, US

<br><br>Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases caused by damage to the optic nerve due to high intraocular pressure (IOP.) Individuals at high risk include African-Americans, individuals over the age of 60, and individuals with a family history of the disease. Treatment comes in two forms eye drops and surgery. Ticrynafen is a potent diuretic that was used to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure in the 1970s. It was withdrawn from the market due to hepatotoxicity. In a study on monkeys, they found that when injected into the eye, ticrynafen has been successful in reducing IOP. To consider the drug as a potential treatment a more convenient form of administration must be found. The objective of research was to create soluble esters of ticrynafen capable of passing through the cornea to be cleaved by endogenous esterases. First, ticrynafen was synthesized using patented methods. Six esters of ticrynafen were then synthesized (glycerol, sorbitol, isopropyl, ribitol, galactitol, and sorbitan) and tested for solubility is several potential vehicles (dH2O, cornoil, micelles) for transporting the drug into the eye. The ribitol ester successfully reduced IOP by 20.7% at a statistically significant level of 98.86%.

MICROENCAPSULATED ENZYME SYSTEMS ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY AND BIOREMEDIATION
Vladislav Igorevich Lavrovsky
Queen Elizabeth High School, Calgary, Alberta, Canada

The oil industry is dependant on chemical/mechanical methods for oil recovery, biological methods have unique capabilities allowing exploitation of previously inaccessible resources. The limitations of bacteria in-situ have prompted the proposal of direct application of immobilized enzymes. Lignin Peroxidase(LP) and Alcohol Dehydrogenase(AD) undergo testing in this study. A supplementary Gas Chromatograph method was developed, by using gradual ramping rates and low initial temperature, peak separation improved and peak-drift was reduced. Dichloromethane replaced n-Pentane, reducing solvent loss by evaporation. These adjustments greatly improved GC data accuracy. AD was found to be inactivated by the presence of oil. LP has a substantial impact on the overall oil composition, most effectively on extracted bitumen; in oil sand, LP has minor effect, as substrate molecules are unavailable. Encapsulation was studied by testing the capacity of Sephadex, PDGD and 7%(50Å) polyacrylamide beads to intake oil; solvents and emulsifiers were used to facilitate osmosis. Molecular weight exclusion limits exceeding 2000 Daltons resulted in rapid absorption of substrate oil; however, no absorption of asphaltenes was detected. Catalase was found to inhibit acrylamide polymerization, explaining rapid oil-absorption in some beads. Use of cyanide to inhibit catalase was moderately effective, but resulted in lengthy polymerization time. Incompletely polymerized beads are effective at extending enzyme activity. Evaluation of Athabasca oil-sand microbial content was completed by culturing under aerobic/anaerobic conditions, colony formation confirmed the presence of microbes and thus the necessity of immobilization. Oil osmosis into encapsulation beads was demonstrated to occur, making encapsulation a considerable technique for in-situ enzyme catalyses.

DIFFERENTIAL GENE EXPRESSIONS UPON REMOVAL OF ZINC TRANSPORTERS
Ilda Bajraktari
Massachusetts Academy of Math and Science, Worcester MA, USA

P1B-type heavy metal ATPases are essential in the mechanisms of heavy metal absorption, distribution, and homeostasis. Arabidopsis thaliana has eight of these proteins (HMA1-HMA8) that have different metal specificities. HMA2 is a Zn/Cd ATPase that is localized in the plasma membrane. It has been shown that a mutation in HMA2 in A. thaliana results in a generation of plants that are visibly indistinguishable from the wild type (WT) A. thaliana plants. However, mutant hma2 plants accumulate significant amounts of Zn2+ and Cd2+. In this study to understand the homeostasis of other genes in Zn2+ and Cd2+, the mRNA expression levels of other P1B-ATPases in both WT and mutant hma2 seedlings were analyzed. In addition, the transcript levels of A. thaliana phytochelatin synthetase (PC) and metallothionein (MT) genes shown to be involved in the maintenance of heavy metal homeostasis were also monitored. Transcript levels of HMA3, HMA4, AtPCS1, AtPCS2, MT1A, MT2A, and MT2B all showed amplification in an attempt to maintain Zn2+ and Cd2+ homeostasis.<br><br><br><br>

"LIPASE YOUR FAT AWAY: TAKE 2"
Katie Ann DeClerck
Taylorville High School, Taylorville, IL, USA

The purpose of this project, "Lipase Your Fat Away: Take 2" was to determine, through running a comparison assay, which butter-like solid spread product is more easily digested by the human body. The more the product oxidized, the more lipase activity it had, and the easier it is for the consumer's body to digest. The following products were tested: Prairie Farms butter, Brummel and Brown spread, Great Value shortening, and Blue Bonnet margarine.<br><br>Sodium phosphate buffer (mono and dibasic forms) were added to lipase powder. This simulated the natural conditions of a human's small intestines, where lipid digestion occurs. A lipase mixture was added to all experimental butter-like solid products. Controls were set up with the butter-like solid product mixtures without the lipase enzyme. The mixtures were incubated in a vortex mixer at 35 degrees Celsius for 90 minutes. This enabled the mixtures to emulsify and increase the amount of digestion lipase would have on the mixtures.<br><br>After the 90 minutes, an extraction solvent was added to each of the flasks to stop all lipase activity. Phenolphthalein was added to each of the flasks, and a 1 molar solution of NaOH was titrated into each of the flasks until the mixtures came to their endpoint. After doing calculations, the data concluded that butter had the most lipase activity, followed by the margarine, the spread and the shortening.

NEW SPECTRAL PROPERTIES OF THE CHELIRUBINE AND ITS POSSIBILITY OF THE USE AS THE DNA PROBE
Martin Palkovsky
Grammar School of Jakub Skoda, Prerov, CZECH REPUBLIC

Fluorescent probes have a wide use in analytical sciences and research. Chelirubine belongs to the group of plant alkaloids. In this project, the use of chelirubine for fluorescent quantification of DNA is studied. Chelirubine is used for the first time for this purpose.<br><br>Chelirubine fluorescent properties are investigated: a) in free form without DNA and b) in complexes with various double-stranded DNA dodecamers; both in buffered solutions. I found two emission maxima significantly depending on the form of chelirubine – 420 nm band (blue light) for the free form and 620 nm band (red light) for the form intercalated to double-stranded DNA. Calculations indicate that detection limits for double-stranded DNA are located in the range of nanograms per milliliter. I discovered the lowest detection limit (6 ng∙mL-1) is related to dodecamer of Dickerson DNA. <br><br>The association constants of the chelirubine-DNA complexes are in the range of 5,44 ± 0,04 for (GC)6 and 5,83 ± 0,08 for Dickerson DNA dodecamers. The most probable stoichiometry of chelirubin and DNA base-pairs are estimated to be 6:1. No specific selectivity towards to DNA base-pairs was detected, it results in highly sensitive DNA detection based on chelirubine, and more sensitive than it is the case with the majority of present fluorescent probes.<br><br>The main contribution of the project is the comprehensive characterization of the chelirubine spectral properties, which corroborate that it is appropriate for more sensitive DNA quantification. Chelirubine intercalates to double-stranded DNA uniformly and it associate ratios are approximately constant.

ISOLATING REGIONS OF AMINO ACIDS IN PROTEINS WITH SIGNIFICANT STRUCTURAL BACKBONE FLEXIBILITY
Tarak Jagdish Upadhyaya
Southside High School, Greenville, South Carolina, United States of America

Research involving protein backbone flexibility has just recently caught the interest of molecular biologists. It is quickly becoming apparent that this information can form the foundations to solve another, more universal problem: protein-protein docking. Although some proteins do not change conformations from bound to unbound states, the majority of proteins do flex or bend at certain regions to bind to substrates or other proteins. Isolating regions of structural backbone flexibility can decrease the search space and increase the accuracy algorithms that are used to figure how a substrates might bind to a protein, or in the case of Rosetta (JJ Gray et al J. Mol Biol, 2003), how two proteins dock with one another.<br><br>A feed-forward neural network can be trained on structural flexibility data from the Database of Macromolecular Movements. It is possible to use PDB files for the same protein in both the unbound and bound structures to determine change in phi and psi angles. A single value can be obtained by calculating the magnitude of a vector defined by the delta phi and delta psi angles. Normalizing this data creates a viable training set. The network inputs are binary input vectors, using the traditional BIN20 encoding, in addition to weighted values for localized electrostatic forces, van der Waals forces, and hydrogen bonding forces. Average prediction accuracy was 60%, including penalties for incorrectly predicted regions.

IDENTIFICATION OF PROMOTER ELEMENTS REQUIRED FOR TRANSCRIPTIONAL INDUCTION OF MOTILITY RELATED GENES
Tyler Thomas Rosensteel
Brophy College Preparatory, Phoenix, Arizona, United States of America

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive of all primary brain tumors. The median survival of a person diagnosed with GBM ranges form nine to twelve months because GBM is non-responsive to current treatments. cDNA microarray studies addressing glioma invasion show differences between the gene expression profiles of invasive cells compared to that of non-migrating cells residing in the tumor core from the same patient. Transcriptional regulation of invasion related genes is likely to involve common promoter elements or transcription factor binding sites. This study focuses on the identification of promoter elements that may facilitate transcription of invasion related genes in GBM. Promoter fragments were cloned into an enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter vector (pEGFP) in order to visualize promoter activity. These reporter constructs were transfected into glioma cell lines, which were induced to migrate in a two-dimensional model system with Lysophosphatidic acid. mRNA quantification by QRT-PCR showed a significant up-regulation of motility related genes(p<.01)thus validating the model system. So far, in the model system, reporter constructs have relayed data showing the activation of specific genes’ promoters during motility induction. Once researched more fully, the glioma invasion specific promoter elements could be used to activate expression of a potential suicide gene aimed specifically at invading tumor cells, the cell population responsible for this tumor's poor prognosis(Eg. Herpes simplex virus type 1 tymide kinase; ganciclovir).

NMR STUDY OF THE BINDING OF VANCOMYCIN TO THE CELL WALL OF STAPH. AUREUS
Katherine Michelle Byrd
Renaissance High School, Detroit, MI, USA

Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterium that is normally located in the nasal passages and the skin of humans and other warm-blooded animals. S. aureus is a gram-positive bacterium that is becoming resistant to almost all antibiotics. As a last resort the antibiotic vancomycin has been prescribed. NMR spectroscopy was used to study vanocmycin. These studies have led to the discovery of the “vancomycin-binding pocket.” This pocket is considered to be the main place where vanocmycin binds to the peptidoglycan unit. The purpose of the present work is to use 1H and 13C NMR to prove the binding of vancomycin to a S. aureus peptidoglycan unit with the following sequence: N-acetyl-muramic acid-D-Lac-L-Ala-G-Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala. This study should show a more detailed view of how vancomycin binds to the cell wall than previous studies have shown. By understanding how vancomycin works scientist hope to gain information that will be useful in the discovery of a more powerful antibiotic that is effecient enough to destroy many multi-drug resistant strand of bacteria.

THE POTENTIAL USE OF NATURAL CHEMICALS IN TREATING CANCER
Quintisha Marie Walker
Saginaw Arts & Sciences Academy, Saginaw, MI USA

Resveratrol, quercetin, and ellagic acid are all natural chemicals. Research shows that the three compounds inhibits the growth of and induces apoptosis in many cancer cell types. This research studied their apoptotic and inhibitory effects on neuroblastoma, endometrial, and human leukemia cells. Neuroblastoma is an aggressive childhood cancer with limited treatment options. Endometrial cancer is a disease in which malignant cells form in the tissues of the endometrium. Leukemia is a cancer that occurs in the blood cells. <br><br> To test the effects of the chemicals on neuroblastoma cells, the neuroblastoma cell lines SKNAS, SY5Y, and NGP were treated with concentrations ranging from 10uM- 200uM of resveratro, quercetin, and ellagic acid. The endometrial cell line, ECC-1, was treated with concentrations ranging from 10uM- 200uM resveratrol, quercetin and ellagic acid. The Human Leukemia cell line, MOLT-4, concentrations ranging from 25uM - 200uM resveratrol. Cells were analyzed for cell viability by a manual cell counting method and by using the CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay. Apoptosis was measured by morphology and the activation of degradative enzymes caspase 3/7 and 9. <br><br> Resveratrol, quercetin and ellagic acid was found to induce apoptosis and inhibit the growth of Neuroblastoma, Endometrial, and Human Leukemia cancer cells. The inhibitory effects of resveratrol were dose dependent and these effects of resveratrol were associated with the induction of apoptosis. An increased number of apoptotic cells were observed which coincided with increased caspase activity in a time-course and concentration dependent manner. The effects were more pronounced at higher concentrations, and with longer time of drug exposure. The inhibitory effects of quercetin and ellagic acid were more pronounced at lower concentrations over a longer time period (it depended on the different cell line).

THE EFFECTS OF OXIDATIVE DAMAGE ON PROTEIN TRANSLATION EFFICIENCY
Steven Siyi Hao
Silver Creek High School, San Jose, CA, USA

The effects of free radical damage from reactive oxygen species have been implied in human aging and in a variety of diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Currently, research has shown that extensive exposure to reactive oxygen species results in the structural modification of DNA, proteins, and lipid, causing them to lose function. However, there has been no investigation in the past into whether free radical damage also affects components of protein translation, especially tRNA and rRNA. In this project, tests were conducted by treating total RNA and retic lysate with the free radical releasing compound, hydrogen peroxide, to determine whether protein translation is indeed affected.<br><br>The results show that some RNA degradation occurs, although enough still remained intact at all concentrations. More interestingly however, there was a significant drop in the amount of protein produced by retic lysate as the concentration of hydrogen peroxide increased. This demonstrates that damage to the protein synthesis apparatus does indeed occur, and as a result, protein synthesis is hindered. Thus in the future, it may be important to consider damage to the cellular protein synthesis apparatus when investigating the mechanism of aging and of certain degenerative diseases.

PROTEIN INTERACTIONS USING NANO-METALLIC BARCODES
Zachary Philip Rice
The Academy of Science & Technology, Conroe, TX 77385, United States of America

When looking at cell function on the molecular level, numerous different protein interactions are seen. One of the main goals of the Human Proteome Project is to determine what each protein does and with which other proteins it engages. The purpose of this experimentation is to design a basis for which many numerous protein-protein interactions can be observed.<br><br>Vaccinia virus proteins VP39 and VP55 were attached to Nanobarcodes and interaction between the proteins was observed by using optical microscopy. Barcodes can be designed using different lengths, widths, metals, and lastly, by changing the striping pattern of the particles. Numerous controls were prepared to ensure that clumping of barcodes and protein interactions were only visible when both proteins were attached to their respective barcodes.<br><br>From the results collected, only the trial interactions that consisted of VP39 and VP55 were seen in clumps, with fewer and more sporadic barcodes surrounding these clusters. These results yield enough evidence to continue conducting multiplexing experiments using other known protein interactions of vaccinia virus. By identifying unknown protein interactions, it becomes possible to track proteins throughout organisms and help to better understand the purpose of each individual protein.<br><br>If these protein interactions were disrupted, it becomes possible to fight certain viruses with new drug techniques. What makes this barcode tagging so important is the amount of screening that can be conducted at one time. These findings should prove useful to future medical research, facilitating the process of designing drugs that are patient-specific.

DNA ANALYSIS
Laura Ashley Zimmerman
The Good Hope School, Frederiksted, Virgin Islands

Since DNA is unique to all individuals, excluding identical twins, it is very helpful to forensic scientists in their search for answers to crimes because approximately 99.5% of the DNA code is the same for all people. Forensic scientists use the 0.5% of DNA that is unique to the individual (except identical twins). Being able to analyze the 0.5% helps forensic experts link suspects to crimes and prosecute them.<br><br> The purpose of the experiment is to analyze the DNA of two families: one with a pair of identical twins, and one with two non-identical siblings. The application is to see if there is a correlation between the sibling and twin in comparison to a correlation between the two non-identical siblings.<br><br> The experimental design was to swab for buccal cells, extract the DNA, and run Gel Electrophoresis to determine the presence of DNA. Then PCR was performed on the extracted DNA for later analysis. A second Gel was run on known ‘cut’ DNA to compare with the first Gel that was run using ‘uncut’ DNA. This comparison shows the smear caused by ‘uncut’ DNA and banding patterns caused by ‘cut’ DNA.<br><br> The results show that the allele sharing between the two siblings in family two is greater than the allele sharing between the sibling and twins in family one by 8.67%. A further study is to perform the same experiment with more individuals to verify the results more accurately.

A NOVEL ROLE FOR TELOMERASE IN STEM CELL DIFFERENTIATION
Anneke Ellen Schwob
Boston Latin School, Boston Massachusetts, United States

Telomeres are repeating DNA sequences that protect chromosome ends during cell division. With each division, telomeres shorten: once they become too short, cells enter senescence and die. Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase that helps maintain telomere ends. In stem cell models average telomere length decreases rapidly and significantly during differentiation, but increases once neuronal differentiation is completed. In spite of this, telomerase activity remains constant suggesting that telomerase may need to be sequestered away from telomeres for differentiation to proceed normally.<br><br> Based on these patterns of telomere and telomerase regulation, the effect of over-expressing telomerase on the outcomes of neuronal differentiation was examined using a stem cell model (P19 embryonal carcinoma cells). I predicted that neuronal differentiation would be inhibited. The mouse telomerase gene, mTERT was cloned into a pBABE puromycin retrovirus vector and used to infect undifferentiated P19 cells. Three independent cell lines that over-expressed mTERT and two control lines that expressed vector alone were isolated. Neurectodermal differentiation was induced with retinoic acid and quantitated following immunocytochemistry using markers of neuronal differentiation. In each of the mTERT-expressing lines differentiation was initiated normally, but did not proceed to completion. The mTERT infected clones continued dividing and acquired markers of neurepithelium, but not of mature neurons. Moreover they did not undergo the apoptosis that accompanies terminal neuronal differentiation. The results show that over-expression of telomerase can be used to expand a population of dividing neuronal progenitors, and are of potential significance for the control of differentiation in stem cell therapy.<br><br>

AN EVALUATION OF SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS (SNPS) WITHIN GENE EP300 OF HUMAN CHROMOSOME 22Q TO ASSESS THEIR ROLE IN PEDIATRIC BRAIN TUMORS
Samantha Leigh Schneider
Jericho Senior High School, Jericho NY, United States of America

Studies have shown significant loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the gene EP300, located on chromosome 22q, in several different cancers, including colon, breast and ovarian. Mutations in EP300 have been found in colorectal cell lines, but not in astrocytic gliomas. This study set out to show whether or not mutations occurred in EP300 in a variety of pediatric brain tumors. In order to do this, genomic DNA was extracted from brain tumor tissue as well as normal blood as a control. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed to amplify regions of EP300 gene, which was believed to contain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The PCR products were analyzed by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) to detect any mutations. The results were then confirmed by sequencing. There were no SNPs found in either the experimental or control groups, suggesting, in agreement with previous studies, that EP300 does not behave as a classic tumor suppressor gene. However, other mutations in EP300 such as truncation and LOH may play a role in disease.

THE EFFECT OF OPIOIDS ON CHEMOKINE PRODUCTION IN U937 MONOCYTES
Julian Terrell Otis
Walter Payton College Preparatory School, Chicago Illinois, United States

Opioids modulate the immune response by altering cytokine and chemokine production. TNF-alpha is a cytokine that can alter a variety of opioid peptides and their receptors. It has been shown that TNF-alpha can increase the transciption of the Mu opioid receptor (MOR) in U937 cell monocytes as well as in other cell lines. These studies will show that DAMGO, a chemical compound that selectively binds and activates the Mu opioid receptor, can increase the production of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in TNF-alpha stimulated U937 cells.<br><br> To measure the increase of MCP-1 production, Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) were performed on U937 cell monocytes treated with TNF-alpha at various concentrations, followed by a 24 hour DAMGO treatment. MCP-1 levels increased significantly in DAMGO/TNF-alpha treated cells when compared to the untreated control cells. In order to check for the expression of MOR mRNA, mRNA was isolated from TNF-alpha treated U937 cells and reverse transcribed into cDNA. The cDNA was used as a template for Real Time PCR. Both gel electrophoresis and Real Time analysis did not detect MOR mRNA levels in these samples using the designed primers.<br><br> TNF-alpha and DAMGO treated cells significantly increased the amount of MCP-1 compared to control samples, suggesting that MOR was expressed and can be activated in these cells. This research implicates that there is a role for opioids in the effectiveness of the immune response in monocytes as well as validates the exploration of the effect of opioids in other immune effector cells.<br><br>

INVESTIGATING A NOVEL LIFESPAN GENE IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Richard Hsu
Alhambra High School, Alhambra, CA. United States

Aging is a universal process among living organisms in which homeostasis decreases and chance of death increases with age. Trying to understand aging in a simpler organism, such as Drosophila, is a possible intermediate step in understanding aging in humans. A screen for lifespan extension was performed using a driver line and a collection of EP lines. A driver line has a P-element which expresses the yeast transcriptional activator, gal4, while an EP line has a complimentary P-element which contains the DNA binding sequence of gal4. When a driver is crossed to an EP, the region downstream of the EP will be overexpressed. The mutant EP3306 was identified and found to have a reproducible lifespan extension. The EP3306 insertion site was found, and the putative gene overexpressed appeared to be an uncharacterized gene, CG7900. A genomic transgenic was constructed to verify that overexpression of CG7900 extends lifespan in an independent line. A recombinant was made between EP3306 and the daughterless-gal4 driver to look at interactions with other long-lived lines in the lab. Results show that CG7900 is the cause of increased lifespan and the gene itself seems to play a vital role in metabolism. In conclusion, the EP is located 300 base pairs upstream of the CG7900 gene, which has a high sequence similarity to a human protein. Hence, the understanding of how overexpression of CG7900 extends lifespan could be important to not only the understanding of fly aging, but also the aging process in humans.

PERCENT CONSERVATION OF THE HUMAN INSULIN MOLECULE VS. CNS DEVELOPMENT IN LOWER ORGANISMS
Kathleen Curley Clement
Langley High School, McLean, Virginia, USA

The purpose of my science fair project is to understand how the development of one aspect of the endocrine system, the protein insulin, can effect the development of one aspect of the nervous system, specifically the central nervous system. Using a computer with internet access, I searched the protein knowledgebase, Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL, to find the insulin sequence in humans, and in a variety of other organisms. Using T-Coffee, an online multiple sequence alignment tool, I compared the sequences found between different organisms. I determined the percent conservation of the insulin molecule in lower organisms compared to the human insulin molecule. Finally, I determined each organism’s CNS development level using a system based on my research. As the CNS development level increased, the percent conservation of the human insulin molecule did not consistently increase. However, as CNS development increased, the percent conservation of human insulin receptor substrates increased.<br><br>The evolution of the insulin molecule does not appear to be associated with CNS development . Rather, it appears the evolution of insulin receptor substrates are associated with CNS development. This is so pertinent because the data from this science project demonstrates that as the system of glucose uptake evolved, so did the central nervous system; therefore reaffirming the very important evolutionary connection between the development of the endocrine and nervous systems. <br><br>

A NEW SPIN ON WOUND HEALING SCAFFOLDS: PHYSICAL AND MOLECULAR OPTIMIZATION
Amardeep Singh Grewal
Detroit Country Day School, Beverly Hills, MI, United States

Each year three to five million Americans suffer from chronic wounds. These wounds often lead to permanent tissue damage, infection and disease. For these reasons, it is of utmost importance to find a cure to heal these possibly fatal wounds. Recently, a first generation hydrogel matrix had been designed to support dermal fibroblast migration on a crosslinked thiol-modified hyaluronic acid base. This hydrogel contained Fibronectin functional domains, C, H, and HV, that were resistant to the proteolytic environment of the chronic wound and attracted fibroblasts into the matrix of the hydrogel. This study strives to further optimize this matrix molecularly and physically. It has been shown that Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) further accentuates fibroblast migration in vivo. For this reason, in this study I have demonstrated that it is possible for the functional domains of Fibronectin to actively bind to PDGF molecules and enhance dermal fibroblast migration, an important step in the formation of granulation tissue. Along with biologically optimizing the hydrogel matrix, I was able to physically and structurally optimize the FNfd hydrogel by transforming it into the three dimensional, porous and fibrous morphology of the natural extracellular matrix through the process of electrospinning. This electrospun scaffold has been shown to support fibroblast attachment and migration and resist hydrolytic degradation. In these ways, this study comprehensively optimizes the Hyaluronic Acid matrix biologically and structurally.

INDUCIBLE EXPRESSION OF BRAIN-DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR IN TISSUE CULTURES
Osarimabo Idemudia Imoisili
Centennial High School, Ellicott City, Maryland, Howard

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is part of a family of trophic factors known as neurotrophins. It is highly implicated in neuronal plasticity, a process that assists in the normal function of the human brain, specifically cognitive functions such as learning and memory. Based on a single base pair alteration in the 66th codon of the BDNF gene, the generally expressed valine amino acid is substituted by the amino acid methionine. While this alteration does not affect the structure and function of the protein, it does affect the regions and volume in which the protein is expressed. The allele that codes for methionine causes a decrease in the volume of BDNF expressed and hinders neuronal plasticity. In order to study this biological phenomenon, the BDNF must first be expressed in cell cultures and induced. <br><br> Genes for BDNF-Val and BDNF-Met were cloned into plasmids as well as a gene for Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP). These plasmids were then transfected into Neo-2a cells. A plasmid containing the genes for neuron-specific enolase and tetracycline transactivator was transfected into one of the two wells containing a given BDNF gene (val allele or met allele) in order to facilitate induction in the absence of tetracycline. After incubation, the cells were evaluated for protein expression via ultraviolet photography. Additionally, the protein was extracted from the Neo-2a cells and evaluated via gel electrophoresis.<br><br> The BDNF was successfully expressed and induced in Neo-2a cells, as demonstrated via electrophoresis and ultraviolet photography. <br><br>

A SILK OF COLOR
Don Lawrence Plattner
Webb School of Knoxville, Knoxville, TN, USA

The aim of this project was to internally dye a silworm's cocoon through its food. Dye was mixed in the silkworm's food in hope that the dye would pass through the internal membrane of the silkworm and chemically combine with the silk protein, forming colored silk. Around one thousand silkworm eggs were ordered through the internet and hatched in an incubator. The larvae were fed until they were big enough to be moved into their own containers. The worms were divided into groups of twenty-five. Each group represented a type of dye, and amount of dye used. Each type of dye had three different amounts and eight different dyes were used, resulting in twenty-five groups due to the need for a control group. Of the eight dyes used, three were synthetic dyes and five were natural dyes. After four weeks, starting at the day of hatching, the first worms began to cocoon. None of the natural dyes formed cocoons with an alteration in color. The synthetic dyes, however, produced pink cocoons from the Eosin Y dyes, and two blue cocoons from the Toluidine blue dyes. The conclusion was the natural dyes were not small enough in molecular size to penetrate the silkworm membrane. The synthetic dyes were small emough, but some were toxic in the high dosages. Thus, the dyes needed to have a specified amount that would not kill the worms but would turn the cocoons the color needed.

THE ROLE OF BRASSINOSTEROIDS IN ROOT-CELL DIFFERENTIATION IN ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA
Edith Adriana Pierre-Jerome
Mount Miguel High School, Spring Valley, CA

This project in its present form is a result of several experiments conducted on the mustard plant Arabidopsis thaliana examining the role of the growth hormones brassinosteroids on cell differentiation in the root. Brassinosteroids (BRs) had previously been found to increase the expression of the WEREWOLF protein, a key factor in cell specification, which led to the hypothesis that brassinosteroids also play role in cell fate.<br><br> Homozygous werewolf seedlings were obtained and grown on five different levels of brassinolide (BL). After a week the hypocotyls of the mutants were measured and compared to those of wild type (control). Two BR-mutants: DWF4OX, which over produces BRs internally; and det2, which is internally deficient; were then grown and compared to wild type on plates containing either 1 mM of BL( the most active BR) or no BL. Measurements were taken of the meristematic zones, root hair length and average root hair count and compared between the two plates. This experiment was then attempted using werewolf mutants.<br><br> The comparison of the hypocotyl lengths between werewolf and wild type showed that the mutant was less sensitive to the hormone at higher concentrations. These results suggested that WEREWOLF is necessary for a normal BR-response. The data collected from the BR-mutants showed that the addition of brassinolide significantly decreased meristematic zone length, root hair length, and root hair count. This experiment could not be repeated on werewolf due to the discovery that the homozygous werewolf allele was seedling lethal preventing any of the plants from reaching adulthood to set seed. <br><br> This project has two major contributions. First, a strong biological connection between brassinosteroids and WEREWOLF was established. Secondly, it was found that brassinosteroids play a key role in cell differentiation in the root.<br><br>

EFFECTS OF ENHANCED MUSCLE GROWTH ON FATTY ACID UPTAKE IN THE SKELETAL MUSCLE
Gitasree Devi Borthakur
Iolani School, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA

The aim of this investigation is to determine if enhanced muscle growth increases fatty acid uptake in the skeletal muscle. There is an inverse relationship between the skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. The skeletal muscle is responsible for insulin-mediated glucose utilization, whereas the adipose tissue stores excess energy in the form of lipids. Obesity occurs when diet overloads the adipose tissue with nutrients. Increased fat intake interferes with glucose utilization in the skeletal muscle, inducing insulin resistance. Muscle growth can be enhanced by inhibiting the negative regulator, myostatin. It has been shown in our laboratory that transgenic mice whose myostatin expression was prevented by overexpression of its prodomain transgene displayed increased skeletal muscle mass. In addition, when fed a high-fat diet, transgenic mice displayed normal adipose tissue weight. It is hypothesized that these transgenic mice will exhibit elevated levels of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), a key enzyme in lipid catabolism, in the skeletal muscle. Tissue samples from transgenic and wild-type mice fed on both high-fat and normal diets were analyzed for the expression of LPL by Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Our results showed lower levels of LPL expression in the muscle tissue of transgenic mice compared to that of the wild-type mice. These results suggest that the extra dietary fat was not stored in the adipose tissue and did not enter the skeletal muscle. Further investigations are necessary to determine alternate pathways for the extra dietary fat in the transgenic mice.

EFFECTS OF REUSED EDIBLE OIL ON HUMAN HEALTH
Fatima Shami
Islamabad Convent School, Islamabad, Pakistan

In South Asia 1.5 billion people use fried food. “Pakoras”, “samosas”, etc are common fried foods in South Asia mostly cooked in reused edible oil.<br><br>The effects of reused edible oil on human health were analyzed. In order to substantiate the study a survey of eating habits of students aging between 12 to 16 years was conducted. Several samples of reused oil for frying were collected from various food points in Pakistan and analyzed for their free fatty acid contents.<br><br>It was found that almost all students eat fried food though frequency varies. The analysis of reused oil revealed 100% abuse of oil. With the degree of usage the colour of the oil changes from light yellow to blackish brown. The viscosity of the oil also increases. Heat causes oxidation, polymerization and hydrolysis in reused oil. With usage a corresponding increase in free fatty acid contents from 0.12% to 1.00% was observed.<br><br>The enhanced level of free fatty acids presents a major health hazard. The smoke of oil contains carcinogenic fumes. The products produced during excessive heating of oil cause blood pressure, coronary and cardiac diseases, increase in cholesterol, problem of nervous system, diarrhea, vomiting and even cancer. A substantial proportion of students were unaware of the effects of fried foods. Thus the health of 1.5 billion people is at stake. The Government need to develop this awareness among the youth and public at large and pass legislation to check the abuse of oil by shops and restaurants.<br><br><br>

R-COGNIN MEDIATES AGGREGATION VIA FREE CELL SURFACE SULFHYDRYLS
Shantanu Kadir Gaur
Bethel Park High School, Bethel Park, PA, USA

Retina cognin (R-Cognin) is a tissue specific, 50-KDa protein that mediates the aggregation of retinal cells in chick embryos. R-Cognin is related to protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and is thought to regulate signalling between retinal cells via thioreductase activity. R-Cognin's cell surface receptor has yet to be identified. To elucidate the structure of R-Cognin's receptor and to define R-Cognin's binding mechanism, the disulfide exchange inhibitor 5-5'-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)(DTNB) was used. It was determined here that the addition of DTNB to trypsinized cells blocked R-Cognin binding, demonstrating that R-cognin requires free sulfhydryls on the cell surface to bind effectively. Through multiple assays, it was also determined that DTNB binds irreversibly to the cell surface and is able to block aggregation in an in vitro system. The characterization made of R-Cognin’s receptor is the first of its kind and has narrowed the list of candidate receptors to three—avidin, CD81, and HB-EGF—all of which contain free sulfhydryls. The study of R-Cognin’s receptor could possibly aid in promoting R-Cognin like activity in those suffering from subtle pathologies such as macular degeneration and glaucoma.<br><br>

THE ROLE OF KINESIN II IN ENDOMEMBRANE TRAFFICKING IN RABBIT LACRIMAL ACINI
Jiamin Hu
Alhambra High School, Alhambra, CA, USA

Kinesin II is a motor protein that drives the plus-end transport of membrane organelles along microtubules. This study explored kinesin II’s role in lacrimal acinar membrane trafficking. Cultured primary rabbit lacrimal acinar cells were treated with 100 uM carbachol (CCH) for 15 min. Confocal microscopy of resting acini revealed kinesin II immunofluorescence label in a punctate pattern beneath the apical membrane and throughout the cytoplasm with colocalization with rab6 (Golgi), rab11 (recycling endosome), VAMP2 (secretory vesicle) and p150Glued (dynactin sidearm). CCH stimulation increased the intensity of kinesin II beneath the apical membrane and its colocalization with rab6, rab11, VAMP2 and p150Glued. Analysis of kinesin II distribution on membranes isolated over sorbitol density gradients revealed enrichment in fractions 6-10, showing overlaps with rab6 and gamma-adaptin (trans-Golgi network/Golgi). CCH induced a shift of kinesin II to fractions 5-8 as well as an increase in rab6 and gamma-adaptin distributions. Microtubule capture assay showed that kinesin II increases its binding activity with microtubules due to CCH stimulation. This study concludes that kinesin II is involved in the retrieval and recycling of secretory vesicle membrane internalized into apical endosomes, as well as the transport of membrane organelles from the endoplasmic reticulum, towards microtubule plus-ends to the trans-Golgi network and Golgi.

DESATURASE GENE EXPRESSION IN THE HUMAN MEIBOMIAN GLAND: IMPLICATIONS FOR OCULAR SURFACE DISEASE
Eric William Prouty
Central Bucks High School West, Doylestown, PA, USA

The lipid component of tears is important for normal function of the ocular surface, where one of its roles is prevention of tear film evaporation. Altered lipids and evaporation are associated with ocular surface diseases such as blepharitis (inflammation of the eyelid) and dry eye. The source of tear film lipids is the meibomian gland, a modified sebaceous gland (no hair follicle) located in the eyelid margins. The level of oleic acid, a lipid made by the enzyme Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase (SCD), is altered in ocular surface diseases where ocular fluid is thick and pasty (decreased) or thin and runny (increased). This finding, along with the lack of meibomian glands in the SCD1-deficient mouse, suggested that SCD is the desaturase expressed in human meibomian glands. To test this hypothesis, four samples of adult human eyelid containing meibomian glands were analyzed using in situ hybridization. Following construction, validation, and application of the cRNA probes, results showed that SCD is highly expressed in the meibomian glands of all four samples. In contrast, SCD is weakly expressed in sebaceous glands of the eyelid. A related desaturase, Fatty Acid Desaturase 2 (FADS2), is expressed in an opposite way: high in sebaceous glands and low in meibomian glands. The pattern of SCD/FADS2 expression in meibomian and sebaceous glands correlates with the major differences in the fatty acids of meibum and sebum. Controlling SCD gene expression or enzyme activity may be useful for treating ocular surface diseases involving tear film lipids such as blepharitis and dry eye.

CAN RNAI BE USED TO DOWN REGULATE THE EXPRESSION OF SPECIFIC P53 ALLELES? ABSTRACT
Simrin Kaur Cheema
Mira Loma High School, Sacramento, California, USA

Cancer is a malignant growth that is caused by an abnormal or uncontrolled cell division. A possible explanation to this may be the deletion or mutation of the p53 gene on chromosome 17 that acts as a type of “emergency brake” on cell division, protecting the body from a tumor. The p53 gene is especially important in prostate cancer (CaP) because it may lead to androgen independent cancer, which is currently untreatable. <br><br> RNA interference technology, (sihybrids), was used to down-regulate the expression of mutated p53 in prostate cancer cells (LNCaP). Five plates of LNCaP received a control hybrid, while the second five received the hybrid that is designed to specifically bind to p53 mRNA. RNA extractions were then done on the plates, and reverse transcriptase was used to convert the RNA into cDNA. PCR then amplified the cDNA specific for p53. A visual test was done deciphering the amount of mRNA (transcript) present. If the p53 specific sihybrid works, i.e. has down-regulated the expression of p53, then the band will be less bright. The final piece of data illustrated that the p53 sihybrid succeeded in down-regulating the expression of p53. The significance of this is that if the expression of the mutated p53 can be deleted in the cell culture, this knowledge may aid in the future to invent a method by which to either delete the mutant p53, or prevent cells from further amplifying the mutant p53 and creating more cancerous cells. <br><br>

INVESTIGATING THE NATURAL SELECTION PATHWAYS IN TEN REGIONS OF THE HUMAN GENOME
Jennifer Jing Huang
Oak Grove High School, Hattiesburg, MS, United States

Throughout history, well-adapted variations of the genome have been preserved for many generations while less favored mutations continue to evolve. This phenomenon, called natural selection, is thought to occur in certain regions of the human genome. Confirmation of natural selection and identification of the underlying functional variant under selection may pave the way for further research on the advantages of certain mutations, the effects of mutations on biological functions, and ultimately the tailoring of individualized medical treatments based on genetic characteristics. Ten regions of the human genome, encompassing eight chromosomes, will be sequenced in three human populations: the African, Asian, and European. The haplotypes of these populations will be compared to each other and that of a gorilla and analyzed for signs of high prevalence and low heterozygosity. A long haplotype that is common to all the human populations and is old is a clear sign of positive natural selection since it has been exposed to recombination and mutation for a longer time and is expected to only have short regions of homogeneity. Additionally, the observed number of mutations will be compared to the expected number of mutations, calculated from the estimation of recombination rate and spontaneous mutations. A sharp contrast between a low observed rate and a high expected rate heavily suggests natural selection. The ten regions in my study showed fewer than 10 mutations when hundreds were expected. Thus, it is highly likely that natural selection was a factor in the development of these regions.

REPRESSION OF OLIGODENDROCYTE GENE EXPRESSION: ROLE OF INTERFERON-GAMMA AND MOLECULAR MECHANISMS
Ann Kathryn Kennedy
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Alexandria, VA, USA

In multiple sclerosis, the myelin sheaths which surround axons are destroyed in an autoimmune response, and new oligodendrocytes progenitor cells (OPCs) must differentiate into oligodendrocytes to repair them. This new myelin sheath is often smaller than the original, and remyelination grows progressively worse with repeated attacks. The cause of failure is unknown, but could involve the failure of OPCs to differentiate completely. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), a cytokine released by T-cells during the autoimmune response, could inhibit OPC differentiation by interfering with one or more of the transcription factors involved in the differentiation process. Several transcription factors involved in OPC differentiation have been identified, but the pathway connecting them is unclear.<br><br>IFN-gamma-treated primary rat OPCs analyzed by RT-PCR showed downregulation of transcription factor Sox10, necessary for terminal oligodendrocyte differentiation, and of myelin marker myelin basic protein (MBP). In co-transfections of fibroblast cells, Sox10 was shown to stimulate promoter activities of both MBP and another myelin gene, cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (CNP), and downregulate glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a gene expressed by astrocytes (another cell fate of OPCs). Neither Sox10 nor the two myelin genes were upregulated by the early OPC-specific transcription factors Olig1 and Olig2, suggesting that additional factors or intermediaries are necessary for the Oligs to induce terminal differentiation. Oligs were also shown to decrease MBP upregulation by Sox10, suggesting that their presence interferes with terminal differentiation. These results clarified interactions of OPC transcription factors and myelin genes, and showed that IFN-gamma can inhibit transcription of genes needed for terminal differentiation.

THE EFFECTS OF CREATINE MONOHYDRATE ON MERIONES UNGUICULATUS
Christopher Ryan Massey
Kingston High School, Cadet, Missouri

A widely accepted bodybuilding supplement among athletes and bodybuilders is creatine, a protein made from amino acids. The powder form of creatine is called creatine monohydrate. The purpose of this exploratory study was to study the effects of creatine monohydrate on the energy level and the reproduction rate of gerbils. Creatine has been proven to build muscle mass, but there have been no studies to prove that creatine increases the energy level of users. There are many proven side effects of creatine, but there is one that users have claimed to have noticed while using creatine. That is that creatine has either slowed down or has completely stopped their sex drive. Gerbils are small rodents that are native to Africa and Asia. The Scientific name for gerbils is Meriones unguiculatus. My hypotheses are creatine monohydrate will increase the energy level, creatine monohydrate will increase the weight change, and decrease the reproduction rate of Meriones unguiculatus. All three of these hypotheses were supported by both the raw data collected and it is also statistically significant.<br><br>

IS JAK2 THE UNKNOWN KINASE THAT PASSES THE SIGNAL FROM LEPTIN TO STAT3 TO STOP FOOD CONSUMPTION?
Katherine Yuan Fang
Pioneer High School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA

<br><br>The purpose of this project was to see if JAK2 is in between leptin and STAT3 in a signal pathway. Leptin is a hormone that controls the amount of food consumption, which is a factor of obesity. <br><br> <br><br>Hypothalamus neurons from the cell line NPY-LRb were used. I treated the cell samples with different concentrations of AG490 (a JAK2 inhibitor), Genestein (an unspecific phospholation inhibitor), and leptin. To test if JAK2 lowers the amount of phospholated STAT3, a western blot was done using anti-phospholated STAT3 antibodies, which recognize activated STAT3. To see if leptin activated JAK2, an immunoprecipitation and a western blot were done. I used anti-phospholated JAK2 antibodies which bind to activated JAK2. <br><br> <br><br>The sample treated with leptin but without an inhibitor showed the strongest band of phospholated STAT3. The samples with JAK2 inhibitor had weak bands. Moreover, the higher the concentration of JAK2 inhibitor, the weaker the phospholated STAT3 band was. The JAK2 experiment showed that with leptin, the JAK2 bands were present. Without leptin, no phospholated JAK2 band were seen.<br><br> <br><br>Based on my experiment, I have concluded that in hypothalamus neurons, leptin activates (phospholates) JAK2, which then phospholates STAT3. JAK2 is in between leptin and STAT3 in the signal pathway of leptin controlling food consumption.<br><br>

CORRELATION BETWEEN NK-3 RECEPTOR EXPRESSION AND A RAT MODEL FOR TARDIVE DYSKINESIA
Rahul Guha
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology

Tardive dyskinesia is a disorder which causes facial tics and oral movements, originally called vacuous chewing movements (VCM), in humans who have been using drugs to treat mental conditions. NK-1 receptors allow a chemical known as substance P to regulate cholinergic neurons in the brain. These neurons are involved in movement and other behavior functions. The neurokinin terminals could potentially be synapsing on NK-3 receptors. NK3 mRNA was measured in slides containing slices from brains of male Long-Evans rats that were treated chemically with either Haloperidol (28.5 mg/ml/kg, at 3 week intervals; n=43) or vehicle (sesame oil; n=20) for 24 weeks. Hybridization was carried out according to the method described by W.S.Young. The results were analyzed at the level of autoradiogram, using the program NIH Image(Rasband, NIH).There was a positive correlation between the amount of mRNA present for NK-3 receptors in the substantia nigra/ ventral tegmental area region of a rat’s brain and VCM that are caused by chronic Haloperidol exposure (p<.01).Other interesting findings include that in control rats there was a statistically significant correlation between NK-3 receptor expression and NK-1 receptors in cerebral cortex (p<.001) and nucleus accumbens (p<.015). In rats treated with Haloperidol, the correlation is lost (p<.949). In vehicle rats, there is a positive correlation between NK-3 and Tyrosine Hydroxylase (p<.058), but not in drug treated rats (p<.310). In drug treated rats, Nk-3 and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) are positively correlated(p<.030), but the correlation disappears in vehicle rats (p<.367). This experiment established the precedent for studies involving NK-3 receptor mRNA, using DNA oligonucleotide probes. The results also elucidate the role of NK-3 receptors in the development of Tardive dyskinesia. Future studies include the analysis of NK-3 in other regions of the drug treated rat brains.<br><br>

TRAIL-INDUCED APOPTOSIS IN BREAST CANCER CELLS: ROLE OF XAF-1 EXPRESSION
Christopher S Rogers
Caddo Parish Magnet High School, Shreveport, LA, USA

XAF-1 (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis associated factor 1) is a protein that indirectly promotes cellular apoptosis. Cancerous cells typically have extremely low amounts of XAF--1 compared to non-cancerous cells, partially explaining their resistance to apoptosis. The possible restoration of normal apoptotic function to epithelial cancer cells, through increased expression of XAF-1, as a means of inhibiting tumor growth is understandably of great clinical interest.<br><br> I performed experiments on two human breast cancer cells cell lines: MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. The cells were treated with clinically-achievable concentrations of interferon (an inducer of XAF-1 expression), followed by treatment with TRAIL, a potent inducer of apoptosis, and measured for apoptotic response. The induction of XAF-1 expression by interferon treatment was tested using RT-PCR (Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction).<br><br> Both cell lines showed an increase in sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis following interferon treatment, the MCF-7 cells exhibiting greater sensitivity. RT-PCR confirmed that interferon treatment caused XAF-1 expression to increase in both cell lines dose-dependently.<br><br> These results show that interferon treatment caused an increase in XAF-1 expression and that this increase correlated with an increase in sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in both cell lines. The broad implications of this research are that interferon and TRAIL could be used as a combinant therapy for the treatment and possible reduction of breast cancer tumors and other epithelial cancers.

CHARACTERIZATION OF FUNCTIONAL DOMAINS OF ADENYLATE CYCLASE IN SCHIZOSACCHAROMYCES POMBE
Delbert Andre' Green II
The Louisiana School for Math, Science, and the Arts, Natchitoches, LA USA

The gene fbp1, which encodes fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, is transcriptionally regulated by an overabundance of glucose. Ten git genes are known to be required for this repression. One, git2, encodes adenylate cyclase and, therefore, plays a crucial role in the cAMP pathway. This study sought to characterize the functional domains of git2, specifically with respect to three regions identified by mutant alleles that display intragenic complementation within adenylate cyclase (the git2-7 domain, the catalytic domain, and the CAP (cyclase associated protein)-binding domain). It is demonstrated that overexpression of the wild type or mutant git2-7 domain does affect cell growth but not through fbp1. Furthermore, it is shown that certain git mutants reduce an interaction between the CAP-binding domain and the catalytic domain as shown by two-hybrid assay. Discussed is preliminary research into the mechanisms by which git2-7 alters transcription of fbp1. Data and structure anlysis supports the collection of git2 alleles into domains that dictate the CAP-binding–catalytic interaction. With further elucidation of the git2 domains, substantial information can be<br><br>gathered regarding adenylate cyclase activation/function and cAMP signaling, and, therefore, can be applied to general cellular signaling and transduction.

The induction of XAF-1 expression by interferon treatment was tested using RT-PCR (Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction).<br><br> Both cell lines showed an increase in sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis following interferon treatment, the MCF-7 cells exhibiting greater sensitivity. RT-PCR confirmed that interferon treatment caused XAF-1 expression to increase in both cell lines dose-dependently.<br><br> These results show that interferon treatment caused an increase in XAF-1 expression and that this increase correlated with an increase in sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in both cell lines. The broad implications of this research are that interferon and TRAIL could be used as a combinant therapy for the treatment and possible reduction of breast cancer tumors and other epithelial cancers.

X-RAY CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC INVESTIGATION OF RNA PSEUDOKNOTS AS A MECHANISM FOR DEVELOPING NEW ANTI-VIRAL AGENTS
Natalie Yang-Yang Zhang
North London Collegiate School, Canons, Edgware, Middlesex, England HA8 7RJ

This investigation examines the concept of ‘frameshifting’ in viral replication, using X-ray crystallography to understand the structure of RNA pseudoknots. Structural analysis of RNA pseudoknots will yield information on the molecular mechanism of frameshifting leading to the development of novel anti-viral agents for viruses like SARS and HIV.<br><br>Viruses utilise a wide range of mechanisms to regulate gene expression, for example, programmed ‘-1’ ribosomal frameshifting where ribosomes ‘slip back’ a reading frame for a set percentage of translation events. This allows viruses to express two genes at a defined ratio which is vital for viral propagation. Frameshifting is generally associated with an RNA secondary structure known as a ‘pseudoknot’. It is believed that an interaction between a ribosome and pseudoknot directs the frameshift, although the exact mechanism is unknown. <br><br>Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) RNA with a pseudoknot frameshift efficiency of around 50% was used (much higher than other frameshifting viruses) as it was felt that these high levels might exaggerate important features in its structure. A DNA construct containing the IBV pseudoknot was cloned into plasmids from which the RNA for crystallisation was transcribed. Crystals were grown under a range of test conditions and some reached sufficient size to test for diffraction. <br><br>X-Ray diffraction images confirmed that the crystals were RNA. Subsequent NMR and UV data indicated that the pseudoknotted RNA contained a stem loop. Results from this study have provided information about the structure of RNA pseudoknots, thus enhancing the potential for the development of new drugs. <br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF A CRD-DHHC PROTEIN ON VACUOLE MORPHOLOGY IN SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE
Arundathi Gururajan
Leigh High School, San Jose, California, USA

Palmitoyl Acyl Transferases (PATs) are enzymes mediating palmitoylation often characterized by a cysteine rich domain (CRD) with a conserved asp-hys-hys-cys (DHHC) motif. The first objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the novel protein identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome, YNL155W, is a member of the CRD-DHHC protein family. The second objective was to find the definite cellular role of the YNL155W protein.<br><br> Bioinformatics programs were used to classify YNL155W. Protein database searches were done using BLAST and multiple sequences were aligned using ClustalW. A family tree was constructed and transmembrane analysis was done using Kyte-Dolittle hydrophobicity plots. Experimentally, The deletion strain of YNL155W was compared to the wild type strain for response to osmotic sodium chloride shock and changes in vacuole morphology were determined by florescence microscopy.<br><br> Results showed that YNL155W is a novel member of the CRD-DHHC protein family that lacks a transmembrane domain. Similar proteins were also identified in other organisms including humans, showing that YNL155W function is conserved across species. Osmotic stress experiments showed that YNL155W is required for normal vacuole function. The wildtype vacuoles responded normally by fragmenting, while the deletion strain did not show any fragmentation. <br><br> The significance of this project was that a protein of unknown function was unequivocally classified as a member of the palmitoyl acyl transferase family and its role in vacuole morphology was pinpointed for the first time. The knowledge of YNL155W and other related proteins could lead to a better understanding of the cause and treatment of human diseases linked with PATs like Huntington’s and lysosomal storage diseases.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

PRESYNAPTIC LOCALIZATION OF METABTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR 7
Tabassum Ahamad Khan
Chamblee Charter High School, Chamblee, GA, United States

Metabotropic glutamate receptors, or mGluRs, are G-protein coupled receptors that play an important role in excitatory neurotransmission. mGluR7 is a member of the Group III mGluRs and is primarily localized in nerve terminals where it functions as an autoreceptor in controlling glutamate release by inhibiting voltage-gated calcium channels. Results from previous experiments indicate that mGluR7 is localized in numerous groups that could be pre- or postsynaptic elements in hippocampal neurons in culture. The goal of the current project was to determine the extent to which mGluR7 is presynaptically localized in these neurons and to examine colocalization of mGluR7 with Synaptic Vesicle Protein 2 (SV2). Double-labeling experiments with antibodies against mGluR7 as well as antibodies against SV2, a protein that marks nerve terminals, showed that mGluR7 is highly concentrated but not exclusively localized in presynaptic regions. These results suggest that mGluR7 has both pre- and postsynaptic functions in the hippocampus, which broadens our current understanding of how these receptors may be involved in diseases related to glutametergic transmission such as epilepsy. In addition to this, these findings provide new insight into how drugs targeting these receptors may be effective in modulating neural signals via voltage-gated ion channels.

EFFECTS OF HORMONES ON CARBOHYDRATE USE
Catherine Faye Sherman
Mansfield High School, Mansfield, Missouri, U.S.A.

Plant hormones help plants adapt to their environment. Gibberellins are used commercially to break dormancy of "difficult" seeds. Abscisic acid promotes seed dormancy by inhibiting all growth. It is also involved in opening and closing of stomata as leaves wilt.<br><br> Forty petri dishes were prepared with a starch agar solution, and placed in a refrigerator for the weekend. Weak solutions of gibberellic acid, abscisic acid, and a solution of gibberellic and abscisic acid mixed were prepared. 30 seeds were left to soak in each of the 3 different acids, along with a control of water, overnight. The seeds were then cut in half, placed on the starch agar solution (4 halves to a plate, 10 plates in each set), and left to germinate. Pictures were taken at 24 hours, and 72 hours. After 192 hours (8 days), Lugol's iodine solution was sprayed over each dish, which bonded with the remaining seed halves', in each of the 10 dishes for each set of solutions.<br><br> The mixture of the gibberellic acid and the abscisic acid caused the greatest area of absorption in the starch agar. The individual acids had about the same area of absorption as the control seeds soaked in water.<br><br>

BISPHENOL A LEACHING NEAR YOU
Linh Chuc Tran
Jefferson County International Baccalaureate School, Irondale, Alabama, USA

Bisphenol A (BPA) is used in the synthesis of plastics made from polycarbonates and epoxy resins. However, BPA is also considered to be an estrogen-like compound which may influence breast cancer within the human body. The exposure of epoxy resin to canned goods causes BPA extraction. Therefore, when water and oil are exposed to epoxy resin for a period of three days, does the duration of exposure effect the amount of BPA extracted from the lining of the cans?<br><br>By taking aliquots of water and oil from tin cans at zero time, 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours, and running them with liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry, concentrations of BPA were be detected. Though the data did not support the hypothesis that the longer the exposure to the epoxy resin would cause an increase in BPA concentration, the data did show water to have very low concentrations (mean concentration of 0.397), olive oil doubling the BPA the concentration in water, and extra virgin olive oil quadrupling the BPA concentration found in water.<br><br>

HUMAN CYP2A6 AND UGT2B7 POLYMORPHISMS AND THE METABOLISM OF TOBACCO XENOBIOTICS
Casey Marie Combs
Honaker High School, Honaker, Virginia, USA

The purpose of this project is to search for previously undiscovered SNP’s by sequencing exon 8 of the CYP2A6 gene and exon 2 of the UGT2B7 gene. Next, determine amino acid sequence changes resulting from any SNP’s discovered and explain how that associates with conformational changes to the translated proteins. Then, inferences are made to explain how SNP’s, amino acid and conformational changes to the translated proteins relate to the interindividual variability in enzyme function, which to date has only been partially explained by genetic variation. Genotypes were determined by direct nucleotide sequencing. Then, the sequences were compared to a reference sequence to the respective exons of each gene. The amino acid sequences were analyzed to identify any amino acid sequence variation. In Exon 8 of the CYP2A6 gene there was a T to A transversion at amino acid 392, which results in a Phenylalanine to Tyrosine substitution. Five SNP’s were found in the UGT2B7 fragment I sequenced, with three found in Exon 2. The discovery of these SNP’s may lead to a better understanding of the variability in the development of various types of cancer in smokers and smokeless tobacco users. It is likely these SNP’s alter the function of the UGT2B7 enzymes by changing the rate of glucuronidation of NNAL, a major carcinogenic metabolite of tobacco products. Individuals with a less functional form of the UGT2B7 enzyme would be more susceptible to the tumorigenic effects of NNAL, mainly because of the increased retention time within human tissues. This data may have considerable implications for a better understanding of the role of genetics in the cancer risks of tobacco users.

HOW DOES THE LEVEL OF WHITE BLOOD CELLS AFFECT THE DNA PROFILE OF A MIXED BLOOD SAMPLE
Kathleen Rae Emrich
Rio Rancho High School, Rio Rancho, New Mexico, USA

DNA is the prosecutor of many, as it can identify an individual with a one in a trillion probability. Bloodstains and other bodily fluids are tested for DNA analysis in an attempt to convict or exonerate a suspect. DNA is widely trusted and relied on throughout the scientific world, but can often be misleading, due to a lack of knowledge on the interpreter’s or jury’s part. The purpose of this experiment is to delve deeper into the interpretation of DNA profiles concerning mixed blood samples (a common crime scene occurrence), observing the amount of DNA contributed by two different donors in concordance with the level of white blood cells present. With the knowledge that only the white blood cells contain DNA, two different mixed blood samples were created. First, a mixture with equal amounts of blood from two donors is mixed to make Mix 1. From mix 2, the white blood cell level from one of the blood samples was artificially decreased prior to making the mixture with equal amounts of blood. A Coulter Blood Counter was used to count the white blood cells before and after their removal. The DNA of each mixture was then extracted and analyzed, revealing the affect of the white blood cell count on the resulting DNA profile. Although the same volume of blood from each donor was contributed to each mixture, the altered mixture presented a lower amount of DNA contributed by the donor, due to the lower number of white blood cells. Therefore, the amount of DNA contributed in a mixed blood sample is dependent on the white blood cell count of the sample.

A STUDY OF THE EXPRESSION AND DELETION OF THE SCHLAFEN8 GENE
Boris Zinshteyn
Central High School, Philadelphia, PA, USA

The Schlafen gene family is involved with growth and immune response in mammals. Expression of Schlafen1 has been shown to alter development of thymocytes and fibroblasts. Schlafen8 homologues may affect blood cell differentiation. Schlafen8 is deleted in the DDK mouse strain, which has shown many genetic anomalies including the DDK syndrome, a semi-lethality phenotype that results only from crossing a DDK female with a non-DDK male. The gene responsible has been traced to a region on chromosome 11; the same region contains the Schlafen8 gene.<br><br> The objective of this investigation is to determine which mouse strains share the Schlafen8 deletion and in which organs Schlafen8 is expressed in normal mice. It was hypothesized that expression of Schlafen8 would be greatest in the spleen and thymus, and that MOLC and PERC would share the deletion with DDK. To test these hypotheses, a probe for Schlafen8 was designed. This probe was then hybridized to northern and southern blot membranes, one containing RNA from various mouse tissues and one containing DNA from numerous strains. Expression was shown by presence of a band and deletion by the absence of one.<br><br> The results showed the greatest expression of Schlafen8 in liver, spleen and thymus; consistent with the hypothesis and the idea that Schlafen8 plays a role in immune response. The results showed that Schlafen8 is deleted in MOLC, SPRETUS and DDK, partially supporting the stated hypothesis. The same blot yielded an unexpected result; the Tirano and Zalende mouse strains may have two copies of Schlafen8.<br><br>

IMPROVING THE STABILITY OF NOVEL CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEINS
Lev A. Shaket
Chamblee Charter High School, Chamblee, GA, USA

Ca(II) binding is essential to the proper biological functioning of Ca(II)-binding proteins by increasing their stability and facilitating signal-relaying conformational change. The purpose of this research is to understand the contribution of charged ligand residues to the stability of Ca(II)-binding proteins and to determine parameters that confer the greatest stability upon designed Ca(II)-binding proteins. Several Ca(II)-binding sites of different net charge were previously designed in domain 1 of the protein Cluster of Differentiation 2 (CD2.d1). Designed proteins and CD2.d1 were then expressed in E. coli BL21 cells and purified. After secondary structure was verified, the thermal stabilities of designed proteins and CD2.d1 were analyzed in the presence and absence of Ca(II) using far UV Circular Dichroism. Results support the hypothesis that net charge has a twofold effect on stability. Magnitude of net charge was found to be negatively correlated with stability in the absence of Ca(II) due to repulsion between negative ligands and positively correlated with Ca(II)-conferred stability due to attraction between Ca(II) and negative ligands. Furthermore, results suggest that ligand length is positively correlated with stability. These findings in increasing the stability of designed Ca(II)-binding proteins by optimizing net charge and ligand length facilitate the development of novel Ca(II)-binding proteins with extensive applications. Potentially, designed calcium-binding proteins with increased stability may be used as diagnostic tools and therapeutic agents in diseases associated with altered Ca(II) signaling, such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, lens cataract formation, and various cancers and cardiomyopathies.

DETECTION OF POTENTIALLY DEADLY PATHOGENS BY FLUORESCENT RNA
Jennifer Jing Huang
Oak Grove High School, Hattiesburg, MS, USA

Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a major health concern, causing numerous deaths and hospitalizations yearly. It is a priority to identify the pathogen quickly and correctly. <br><br> Current methods of detecting O157:H7 have limited sensitivity, reliability, or efficiency. Innovative techniques are needed to overcome these issues. This project explores new methods of O157:H7 toxin gene detection with the use of fluorescence. Toxin genes of O157:H7 are amplified by PCR and transcribed to fluorescent dye-labeled RNAs. Complementary biotinylated DNA probes are then used to capture fluorescent RNAs for signal detection. Fluorescence detection is highly sensitive, accurate, and simple. Best yet, a large number of samples can be tested at one time by microarray technology with unmatched reliability. <br><br> Three different experiments were performed based on the similar principle. The first used streptavidin-coated microtitter plates to capture biotinylated DNA probes and fluorescent target RNAs. It did not give good results due to the sensitivity of the detection instrumentation (phosphorimaging). The second experiment employed DNA probe-coated microscope slides to capture fluorescent RNAs. Similar limitations of phosphorimaging led to variable signals. In the third experiment, biotin-DNA probes were incubated with fluorescent RNAs, which were then fractionated by streptavidin-induced gel shift assay. Fluorescence from the gel provided reliable detection of specific RNA targets. <br><br> The experiments have demonstrated that fluorescent RNA-based gene detection is sensitive and reliable. If combined with the state-of-the-art microarray technologies, this fluorescent RNA-based method can provide fast detection and quantitation of a large number of target genes with great sensitivity, accuracy, and speed.<br><br>

BIOINFORMATICS DISCOVERY OF NOVEL STEM CELL REGULATORY MECHANISMS
Michael Segal
Central High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA

Understanding the mechanisms that regulate stem cell development and differentiation is critical to their study and application. Furthermore, there is great demand for effective in silico(bioinformatics) methods of investigating these mechanisms. In this study, murine genes were first grouped according to high degrees of similarity in gene expression during several stages of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) development, as well as expression in embryonic and neural stem cells, using a hierarchical clustering algorithm. For each of four categories of stem cells (fetal liver HSC, adult bone marrow HSC, embryonic and neural SC), groups of genes thought to be important to each stem cell type and having highly correlated gene expressions were selected, under the argument that genes with similar gene expression are more likely to share a common mechanism. 1000 base pair upstream sequences for genes in each group were extracted from the ENSEMBL database and searched for transcription factor (TF) binding sites using TRANSFAC matrices. Results were then sorted according to matrix match presence within multiple sequences in each group. A background model for TF specificity was created and used to filter out false positive matches, resulting in a final list of 112 highly significant candidates, 80 of which were unique to one gene group. At least 40 of these matrices encoded transcription factors that had previously been proven to be stem cell related using experimental methods, suggesting that the remaining candidates contain among them previously unknown stem cell regulatory factors.<br><br>

UNWRAPPING MYELINATION: MYELINATION REGULATION IN TM-NRG1+/- TRANSGENIC MICE
Lev A. Shaket
Chamblee Charter High School, Chamblee, GA, USA

Neuregulin-1 Type III (NRG1 III) is a neuronal protein believed to regulate myelination by mediating juxtacrine signaling from axons to myelinating glia. However, specific signaling mechanisms are unknown. This project was undertaken to broaden the current understanding of neuregulin biology by determining if the NRG1 III cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domain are required for normal myelination. <br><br> TM-NRG1+/- transgenic mice, heterozygous for a targeted mutation that eliminates the cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domain of NRG1 isoforms, were dissected, and sciatic nerve sections were imaged via transmission electron microscopy. Images were then analyzed for myelin quantity and axon number (using the NIH ImageJ program) and for ensheathment of unmyelinated axons.<br><br> It was hypothesized that the cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domain would be unnecessary for myelination, since Wang et al (2001) showed these regions were unnecessary for NRG1 III cell surface localization. However, results demonstrated that average myelin sheath thickness was significantly less in TM-NRG1+/- nerves than in nerves of wild-type littermates (P<0.05). The neuregulin-1 cytoplasmic tail and/or transmembrane domain, therefore, are essential to myelination of peripheral axons. Results also provided evidence that the cytoplasmic tail and/or transmembrane domain are necessary for sensory axon survival and proper ensheathment of unmyelinated axons.<br><br> These novel findings suggest that due to its lack of the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail, soluble NRG1, a drug currently being considered for multiple sclerosis treatment, will not be successful in remyelinating axons. Gene therapy, aimed at overexpressing NRG1 III in axons, may prove to be a more successful alternative. <br><br>

THE KINETIC CHARACTERIZATION OF INOSINE-5'-MONOPHOSPHATE DEHYDROGENASE
Taylor Currie Stevenson
The Louisiana School for Math, Science, and the Arts, Natchitoches, LA, USA

In the de novo production of the purine nucleotide guanine-5-monophosphate (GMP), rate controlling enzyme is inosine-5’-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), which catalyzes the NAD+ dependent conversion of IMP to xanthosine-5’-monophosphate. As some form of IMPDH is required for cell viability, there are many isozymes of IMPDH. The aim of this project is to kinetically characterize human type 2 and wild type E.coli IMPDH, and screen for competitive inhibitors. The kinetic data will then be applied to a structural analysis of both isozymes in order to determine the interactions causing high affinity in low Ki inhibitors. After performing the kinetic analysis, the best tested inhibitors for human type 2 and wild type E.coli MIPDH were 2,4-diChloro-benzyl-2-thio, 1,N6-etheno adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and 4-thio-benzacetyl-2-thio,1,N6-etheno, deoxyribose AMP respectively.

INHIBITION OF BROWNING BY PUPAL EXTRACT
Allison Marie Burns
Notre Dame Academy, Park Hills, KY, United States of America

The purpose of this experiment was to study whether Tenebrio molitor pupal extract will inhibit the browning reaction. Pupae were placed in phosphate buffer of pH 6 and ground in a blender. The mixture was then filtered through cheesecloth and the filtrate frozen until use as “extract.” Extract was added to buffered mixtures of catechol and catechol oxidase. Absorbance was monitored using two colorimeters and LoggerPro software. Increase in absorbance was evidence that the browning reaction was occurring. The experiment showed that the extract did inhibit the reaction up to 50%. Degree of inhibition did not correlate closely with concentration of extract present. Results indicate that an effective inhibitor is present in the pupae of Tenebrio molitor.

COMPARISION OF PHYTOCHEMICALS IN FUNCTIONAL AND TRADITIONAL FOODS
Kali Anne Shephard
Valley High School, Hoople ND, USA

The purpose of this project was to determine if the phytochemcials, Genistein and Daidzein, were found in functional and traditional foods. Does the form of the food affect whether these phytochemicals can be separated? The functional foods tested were soybeans, red clover, alfalfa sprouts, and flax seed. The traditional foods were milk, yogurt, cheese, broccoli, and spinach. The treatment methods used were extraction, heat treated, and ground. The method of testing was thin layer chromatography. First, the solvents were equalized in a developing chamber. The solvents used were, dimethyl sulfoxide, ethyl acetate, acetone, and methanol. The TLC plates were spotted with the different solutions. Daidzein and Genistein were used as a control, and were tested eight times in each solvent and the foods were tested four times in each solvent. The TLC plates were placed into developing chambers. When the solvent had been completely drawn up through capillary action, the plates were removed, air dried, and read under a UV light. The separated substances that appeared were marked and measured from the origin.<br><br>The conclusions of this project were yogurt and milk produced the highest concentration of Genistein and Daidzein. Foods that were heat treated had the greatest amount of separated substances. Individual solvents showed greater variation between foods and within tests of the same foods. Acetone and ethyl acetate were the most successful solvents for separating phytochemicals. Types of solvents had a major effect on the ability to separate the phytochemicals in a particular food. Individual foods had a wide variety of results in various solvents and forms.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF GATA-1 ON VITAMIN D RECEPTOR PROMOTER ACTIVITY
Deepa Iyer
Mills E. Godwin HS, Richmond, VA, U.S.A.

Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) is a specific binding protein for 1,25(OH)2D3 (the active form of vitamin D) at the level of target cells nuclei (Bajwa and Beckman, 2002). The enzyme CYP1a catalyzes the production of 1,25(OH)2D3 in proximal tubule cells. It has been established that VDR regulation in the kidney is linked to CYP1a, but the molecules that determine VDR down regulation in the proximal tubule are unclear. The effects of calcium and parathyroid hormone levels on VDR and CYP1a gene expression in the presence of GATA-1 were studied. It was hypothesized that if proximal kidney cells are exposed to low extracellular calcium levels and high parathyroid hormone levels, then the over-expression of GATA-1 would down regulate VDR expression. The procedure involved two different approaches, a Real Time RT-PCR analysis and a VDR and CYP1a promoter luciferase assay analysis. The first approach produced unreliable results; however, the second approach produced compelling results. It was found that GATA-1 powerfully down regulated both VDR and CYP1a. The presence of the parathyroid hormone seemed to down regulate VDR and up regulate CYP1a. A major aspect of the Vitamin D endocrine system has been deciphered- the down regulatory mechanism of VDR. This study has proven that GATA-1 is responsible for this phenomenon. Future studies will concentrate on the three GATA-1 binding sites on the VDR promoter to work towards determining which binding site(s) are utilized in the Vitamin D down regulation process.

A STUDY OF POSSIBLE INTERACTIONS AMONG REV1, REV3, AND REV7 PROTEINS FROM SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE
John Cong Zhou
Detroit Country Day Schools, Beverly Hills, MI, 

Replicating damaged genes by low fidelity DNA polymerases constitutes a necessary mechanism of cell survival in a process called translesion synthesis (TLS). This ostensibly beneficial method, however, sometimes leads to widespread mutagenesis, which may lead to cancer. Polymerase Zeta (consists of Rev3 and Rev7 proteins) and Rev1p are two error-prone TLS DNA polymerases that have been proven to augment mutagenesis rates in the presence of mutagens. Understanding interactions between Rev1, Rev3, and Rev7 proteins in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is critical to better understanding the TLS polymerases in higher-level organisms such as humans. To check for a yRev7 binding motif on yRev3 and yRev1, yRev1 (100 a.a. C-terminus) and yRev3 (50 a.a.) were cloned, expressed, and purified to form GST fusion proteins, and a binding assay was prepared. Experimental results suggest that yRev7 do not interact with yRev1 and yRev3 in the specified binding region. It is then possible that yRev7 does not interact with yRev1 at all. Results suggest a lower than expected homology and greater diversity of functions between the Rev genes of yeast and those of other organisms. Results may additionally suggest that Rev1 binds to the proliferating cell nuclear antigen accessory protein (PCNA). yRev3, on the other hand, probably interacts with yRev7 in a different binding region (the domain investigated in this study has been in a sense “pigeon-holed”). This experiment has provided a small piece of a large puzzle to understanding TLS polymerases, which may be significant in the long road towards cancer prevention.

ALKALINE ACTIVE AMYLASES FROM THE ALKALIPHILIC BACILLUS HALOURANS ISOLATE LBK 34
Maria U. Forsberg
Olympiaskolan, Helsingborg, Sweden

The purpose of the experiment was to investigate whether it is possible to decrease the amount of Isopropyl Thiogalactoside (IPTG) used when inducing recombinant E .coli cells containing the T7lac promoter and a cloned gene from the alkaliphilic Bacillus Halourans in order to produce the amylase which the gene encodes. The recombinant bacteria were grown in flasks which were induced with 0.0, 0.5 and 1.0 mM IPTG. Samples were taken from the flasks at certain hours and analysed. The growth was monitored in connection with the sampling. The contents with respect to proteins in the bacterial samples were determined by using a colour-changing reagent. The activity of the amylase was examined by mixing samples with starch, the substrate of the amylase. The amount of sugar produced by the amylase was determined by using the Dinitro Salicylic Acid assay. Apparatuses used during the experiment are spectrophotometers, incubators, water bathes, centrifuges, vortex machines and sonicators. The data obtained show that the optical density and the total protein contents are lower in the induced flasks than in the un-induced reference. The activity of the amylase, however, was higher in the induced flasks. All the analyses show that the differences between the induced flasks were minimal. The conclusion is that IPTG inhibits bacterial growth but is essential to the expression of the gene and that the productivity is not negatively affected by a reduction of the concentration from 1.0 to 0.5 mM. <br><br>

NOVEL ALGORITHMS FOR AUTOMATED SNP GENOTYPING
Albert David Shieh
Chaparral High School, Scottsdale, AZ, USA

High-density nucleotide microarrays have revolutionized our ability to identify the genetic underpinnings of human disease. The first generation of these high-density nucleotide microarrays, designed to measure gene expression, generated an unprecedented amount of highly complex data. New analysis tools were developed and those tools spurred a new field of medical diagnostics. Within the past year, high-density nucleotide microarrays have been developed that can resequence the vast majority of genetic variability between individuals by genotyping between 10,000-500,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). This technology holds the promise of allowing us to find the genetic basis for a number of Mendelian inherited and complex diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, autism, and bipolar disorder. Additionally, this technology has and will generate a vast amount of data for analysis. Bioinformatics and computer science challenges have only partially been met. I have developed a computational tool that increases the accuracy and genotyping capabilities of the most widely used microarray-based genotyping platform, the Affymetrix array-based GeneChip® Mapping 10K Array. The correct calling of poor performing SNPs may prove to be key in future linkage studies performed on the 10K GeneChip. It would prove particularly invaluable for those diseases that map to chromosome 19, known to contain a high proportion of poorly performing SNPs.

FASTER THAN A SPEEDING PROTON... THE ENZYME, SUPER CATALYST!
Margaret Janice Meehan
Catholic High School, Alabama, United States

This project compares the catalytic ability of HCl and the enzyme invertase. Polarimetry was used to follow the concentration of sucrose as a function of time, as it hydrolyzed into glucose and fructose. Uncatalized, the sucrose showed no reaction over a ten day period, and both the HCl and the invertase were shown to be effective catalysts. Acid hydrolysis was studied in three separate experiments, runs three, four, and five. The second order rate constant for acid hydrolysis was determined to be 3.73 X 10 per molar, per second. In two enzyme catalyzed runs, runs three and five, the first order rate constant was determined to be 1.31 X 10 per second. The first and second order rate constants can not be directly compared. The proper comparison of the HCl and the invertase is the second order rate constant multplied by the concentration of sucrose and the first order rate constant. This comparison shows that on a Molar basis the enzyme is 272,000 times more effective than the acid.

PROTEIN ANALYSIS OF PRIMARY AND RECURRENT HUMAN MALIGNANT GLIOMAS
Michael R. Mitchell
Brophy College Preparatory, Phoenix, AZ, USA

Malignant gliomas are typically treated with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. In spite of available treatments, recurrence is common and median survival following diagnosis remains approximately one year. It is thought that recurrent tumors may arise, in part, from a subpopulation of cells present in the primary tumor that possess genetic and/or epigenetic attributes that confer resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. Many studies have been carried out investigating changes in DNA and RNA leading to therapy resistance; however, few studies have investigated global protein changes that occur between the primary tumor and recurrence following therapy. An understanding of these changes may point to additional targets for the design of novel therapies. We have used 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to analyze proteins isolated from cells from primary/recurrent tumor pairs with and without in vitro selection for drug resistance. To date we have analyzed total protein samples from three tumor pairs prior to and following selection for resistance to 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) – a total of 12 cell lines. Sixteen protein spots found to be differentially expressed have been identified by MALDI-TOF analysis of tryptic digests. The analyses of additional cell and tissue samples from primary and recurrent tumors are in progress. Global proteomic analysis of primary and recurrent malignant gliomas will corroborate previously published evidence implicating specific genes in tumor recurrence and therapy resistance and will lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets and markers for treatment of recurrent tumors.

Have you ever eaten a piece of chocolate and then another one right after that and noticed how the second one melts much faster? I asked myself questions like these before I started my experiment to spark interest and determination for my project. My purpose for this experiment is to see if food flavors affect body temperature and which one does the most.<br><br>My procedure involved sterilizing my equipment as of the utmost importance when moving from subject to subject. Then, I would go to my subject and take their temperature to start it out. After that, I would give them an article of food to ingest and then allow me to measure their body temperature again after it. Foods involved were something from each portion of the tongues sensors, including sour, sweet, salty, spicy and bitter. I added two things to this for a wider range of testing my experiment. They were spicy and bitter. After they had ingested the material and taken their temperature, I gave them 18 ounces of cool water to restore, or come back down close to what their starting temperature was. This would allow for a more accurate readout of the fluctuations of the body temperature. Starting out with Sweet, Bitter, Salty, Spicy and Favorite. My data was registered in degrees Fahrenheit and kept to the most accurate standards possible.<br><br>In conclusion, I found that my hypothesis was correct in dealing that the sour foods have the biggest impact on the human body temperature and that food flavors affect body temperature.<br><br>

UNDERSTANDING THE MOLECULAR CAUSES OF CANCER: THE ROLE OF MMSET IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF MULTIPLE MYELOMA
Kristie Mercedes Charoen
Yorktown High School, Yorktown Heights, New York, United States

Multiple Myeloma Su(var)3-9, Enhancer of Zeste, Trithorax (MMSET) is a protein that is overexpressed in Multiple Myeloma (MM). The translocation t(4;14) (p16;q32) is found in 20% of MM patients and causes the overexpression of MMSET as well as Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3). The SET domain of MMSET influences gene expression through methylation of histones. MMSET has also been found to interact with corepressor proteins including Zinc finger proteins. Two luciferase assays were done to determine the effect of MMSET on gene expression. Specifically, the influence of the SET domain and the influence of MMSET’s interaction with corepressor proteins on transcription was determined. MMSET at lower levels, as in a normal cell, showed relatively little effect of the SET domain. The repressive effect seen at lower levels was a result of MMSET’s interaction with corepressor proteins. At higher levels, as in a myeloma cell, the SET domain had a greater effect. MMSET is a repressor that represses at lower levels and at higher levels, binds repressor proteins and draws them away from the DNA, disrupting normal gene expression. The low and high levels of MMSET used in the luciferase assay mimic the conditions found in normal and myeloma cells.

STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF OVEREXPRESSED NEURAL LAZARILLO IN TRANSGENIC DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Derek Wai Tam
Alhambra High School, Alhambra CA, USA

This project is aimed at discovering the effects of the overexpression of Neural lazarillo (NLaz) in Drosophila. Overexpression results in additional proteins of a certain gene being present in the organism. Previous research with a close homolog, Glial lazarillo, have led my lab to hypothesize that overexpression will increase lifespan and resistance to environmental stress. The human homolog of the two genes is Apolipoprotein D (ApoD). Its function is unknown, but it is upregulated in brain pathologies. I want to determine whether Nlaz can help slow aging in fruit flies or prevent neurodegenerative diseases, and gain a better understanding of ApoD in humans. I began by acquiring samples of Nlaz cDNA in plasmids, or bacterial vectors. Then the plasmids were amplified through polymerase chain reaction and then extracted by Miniprep. TOPO Gateway technology allowed for the insertion of the NLaz cDNA fragment into an entry vector. After verifying with a gel, a Gateway reaction was performed and cDNA was separated from the entry vectorand cloned into the plasmid pUAST, which allows conditional expression in Drosophila. Once the final plasmid was constructed, it was injected into Drosophila embryos. After careful selection flies carrying the pUAST-NLaz transgene in their genome were obtained. These are crossed to drivers to trigger the expression of NLaz with spatio-temporal control. I will test the progeny for increased lifespan and resistance to stresses (e.g. heat, hyperoxia). Results from this project will help us understand the role of ApoD in human aging and neurodegeneration.

ELUCIDATING THE PROTON-TRANSFER MECHANISM OF HUMAN MANGANESE SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE IN COMPLEX WITH TAURINE
Sara Nikhil Shah
Lecanto High School, Lecanto, Florida, USA

Manganese superoxde dismutase (MnSOD) is a primary antioxidant enzyme, capable of protecting cells against toxic oxygen metabolites, that performs that dismutation of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen. Recent research has suggested that the overexpression of MnSOD inhibits tumorigenicity of cancer and other degenerative diseases, therefore supporting studies, which indicate that tumor suppressing activity of this enzyme. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine the binding sites of the exogenous compound, taurine (2-Flouroethlyamine), which affects the rate of superoxide dismutation by MnSOD in order to better understand its enzymatic mechanism. An Escheria Coli cell line QC774 was overexpressed and purified for MnSOD, from which crystals were grown using the vapor diffusion method. The R AXIS IV ++ image plate system then collected structural data, through X-ray diffraction, to be used in elucidating the proton transfer mechanism of this enzyme which indicated a crystal with space group P 2(1)2(1)2 and unit cell dimensions: a=66.519 A, b=75.651 A, and c=77.172 A. This data was unable to be processed because the resolution was not high enough, therefore the crystals were sent to Cornell University and X-ray diffraction collection structural data once again. This data was merged with Denzo and Scalepack and structural determination was carried out using molecular replacement with the program package, CNS, the resulting structure concluded that the amino acid did in fact kinetically bind to the enzyme; however it was unable to be viewed visually.

IDENTIFICATION OF BACTERIAL ADHESION ANTAGONISTS FOR CONTACT LENS AND INTRAOCULAR LENS
Fan Yang
Davis Senior High School, Davis, CA, USA

Adherence of bacteria to the surfaces of contact lens and intraocular lens (IOL) and subsequent biofilm formation play an important role in lens intolerance, acute red eyes, corneal infection and post surgery endophthalmitis. The primary prevention of lens related infection is targeted at the control of bacterial adhesion. The objective of this study is to develop the strategies and to identify anti-adhesion compounds using combinatorial chemistry approach. The inhibition of bacterial adhesion by compound-library was assessed by (I) 3-day incubation of fluorescent labeled S. epidermidis, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa with one-bead one-compound library; anti-adhesion compound-beads were picked up and re-incubated with mixed S. epidermidis, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa again for 3 days; (II) decoding of the anti-adhesion compound-beads by Procise 494 Protein Sequencer; (III) evaluation of anti-adhesion properties of the compounds on TentaGel lenses; (IV) re-synthesis of anti-adhesion compounds in soluble form to evaluate the toxicities of the compounds. Three compounds have been identified possessing anti-adhesion properties on TentaGel lenses for at least six days and they have no toxicity to bacteria and human blood cells. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility for compound-grafting-biomaterial to prevent the bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation. Long-lasting anti-adhesion compound grafting lenses may be developed in the future to fight lens related infection. One-bead one-compound library for anti-adhesion concept and novel screening assays developed in this study can also be applied to detect anti-adhesion compounds for the prevention of medical device related infections.

SNPS AND THEIR CORRELATION WITH ALZHEIMER’S
Amy Rachelle Shipley, Andrea Trader
San Lorenzo Valley High School , Felton, California, United States

The purpose of this experiment is to show that it is possible to screen for Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) that could be associated with Alzheimer’s disease. We are investigating a successful protocol to screen DNA for SNPs. We chose two SNPS of interest using the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser and then applying our protocol to analyze their correlation with Alzheimer’s. Our belief is that it is possible to screen for SNPs and research suggests that certain SNPs do contribute to the chance of developing Alzheimer’s. We will be using ZR Genomic DNA II Kit™ and using resources in the UCSC labs to analyze the DNA. Our procedures include collecting the DNA from the human subjects by having them swish Saline Solution in their mouths for 30 seconds and then spitting the solution back in a test tube. We will continue by following the Rinse Method for Buccal Cell extraction. After we have isolated the DNA, we will design a PCR (Polymerase chain reaction) to amplify the DNA. If we successfully amplify the DNA, we will add restriction enzymes to cut the DNA at the SNP sites of interest. Finally, we will analyze DNA for SNPs using electrophoresis and see if results correlate with the genetic history of each sample.

ANALYSIS OF PROTEINS SECRETED FROM MITOGEN STIMULATED IN VITRO CULTURES OF NURSE SHARK, GINGLYMOSTOMA CIRRATUM, PERIPHERAL BLOOD LEUKOCYTES (PBL).
Christian Taylor Gilliland, Katie Powell
Sarasota High School, Sarasota, FL, USA

Compared to other lower vertebrate animal systems, relatively little functional information is available regarding the cells and tissues which comprise the elasmobranch immune system. In this study, proteins from mitogen stimulated in vitro cultures of peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) from the nurse shark, Ginglymostoma cirratum, were characterized. PBL were isolated by repeated slow speed centrifugation and cultured at a concentration of 2.5x10^6 cells/mL. PBL were stimulated with standard dilutions of mitogens: lipopolysaccharide (LPS), concanavalin A (ConA), phytohemagglutinin (PHA), while an unstimulated group was left as a control. Cell culture media from PBL (conditioned media (CM)) was dialyzed, lyophilized, and massed. An interleukin-1 sensitive A375.S2 tumor cell line was incubated with aliquots of CM and growth inhibition was measured. The Bradford Assay was used to determine CM protein concentration and SDS-PAGE was used to characterize protein molecular weight. Nurse shark conditioned media (CM) was not shown to significantly inhibit the growth of the A375.S2 tumor cell line.  When protein concentrations of CM were compared with those of unstimulated media to create a Stimulation Index (SI), both PHA and ConA stimulation resulted in increased protein excretion: LPS: 1.11 + 0.073, ConA: 1.84 + 0.200, PHA: 1.72 + 0.680.  SDS-PAGE revealed unique individual protein bands at 30.6 + 0.9 kD and 17.5 kD after stimulation with ConA, and 33.5 + 0.5 kD after stimulation with PHA. PHA and ConA stimulation significantly increases protein production by nurse shark PBL. CM had no reproducible effect on the growth of the interleukin-1 sensitive A375.S2 tumor cell line. Mitogenic stimulation of PBL results in the secretion of new proteins into the culture medium.

THE BIOCHEMICAL DENATURING OF ASPARTYL PHENYLALANINE METHYL ESTER
Julie Ann Liang, Meghan Malia Higgins
Vero Beach High School, Vero Beach, FL

The purpose of this experiment was to determine, without bias, whether the chemical breakdown of aspartame using hydrochloric acid could yield substantial levels of formaldehyde. Some companies have claimed that their product containing aspartame, does not produce the toxic poison. Aspartyl phenylalanine methyl ester, also known as Aspartame, is the active ingredient in artificial sweeteners. The dangers of aspartame ingestion have been debated by interest groups and artificial sweetener production companies such as NutraSweet and Equal. The hypothesis was that the formaldehyde formed would be at a detectable level comparable to that of harmful quantities. <br><br> In this test, both artificial sweeteners containing aspartame and those that do not, were denatured using hydrochloric acid. The optimum conditions for testing were found through the use of time course tests, temperature tests, and concentration tests. These were tested on the active alochol in aspartame, methanol. Once the optimum conditions were found, each of the five artificial sweeteners were treated in this environment of denaturization. The five artificial sweeteners used were NutraSweet, Sweet ‘n Low, Splenda, Equal, and Sucralose. After the biochemical denaturization of the artificial sweeteners were rendered, a formaldehyde test was performed.<br><br> In conclusion, the tests results showed that when metabolized through digestion in hydrochloric acid, aspartame produces formaldehyde in detectable levels. In comparison with the companies’ claims only two of the five samples were found to contain various amounts of aspartame that produce harmful levels of formaldehyde.The NutraSweet and Equal brands both produced significant percentanges.<br><br>

WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF UV RADIATION ON NORMAL PLASMID DNA PROTECTED BY DIFFERING AMOUNTS OF PROTECTING AGENT?
Scott Cameron Fligor, Ansh Grover, 
The Bolles School, Jacksonville, FL

Skin cancer is rapidly becoming a prevalent issue in society. Millions of people are directly affected by this problem. Excessive UV exposure has been linked to increased cancer incidence. Cancer is caused by mutations in the DNA sequences which lead to a rapid increase in cell division, alack of density dependant inhibition, and a lack of anchorage dependant inhibition. Sunscreen protects against the harmful effects of UV radiation. This experiment was designed in order to test the effectiveness of sunscreen with different Sun Protection Factors (SPF) with respect to increasing amounts of UV radiation. <br><br>In this study, plasmid DNA was exposed to increasing amounts of UV radiation. This DNA was protected by sunscreen with varying SPFs. The negative control was DNA unexposed to UV radiation, while the positive control was unprotected, exposed DNA. Three strengths of sunscreen were tested: 15 SPF, 30 SPF, and 60 SPF. The DNA was subsequently run through 1% Agarose gels. The gels were stained with Carolina Blue dye and then read on a computer.<br><br>This study concluded that increasing amounts of UV exposure coupled with decreasing amounts of protecting agent results in increased plasmid DNA damage. This shows that stronger sunscreen is more effective at protecting against DNA damage caused by UV radiation than less powerful sunscreen.

EVIDENCE INDICATING THE RAS/ERK AND RHOA/ROCK SIGNALING PATHWAYS PLAY DISTINCT ROLES IN BREAST CANCER TUMOR DEVELOPMENT
Kyle Russell Carlson, Danielle Elizabeth Rastedt
Perham High School, Perham, MN, United States

The sodium/hydrogen exchanger (NHE) is a membrane protein which functions to exchange intracellular acid for extracellular sodium, maintaining cellular pH levels. Numerous studies have indicated that a continual activation of NHE will lead to a decrease in extracellular pH, a permissive step in cell growth and tumorgenesis. Studies in numerous cell lines have indicated that the Ras/ERK and RhoA/Rock pathways have functioned to activate NHE. It has also been supported that lysophosphaltidic acid (LPA) can act as a mitogen by stimulating cellular pathways involved in activating NHE. However, research regarding NHE activation has not been documented in breast cancer cell lines. As a result, the MDA-MB-231 aggressive human breast cancer cell line was used to research NHE activation through the Ras/ERK and RhoA/Rock pathways, as well as with the stimulation of LPA. Experiments were conducted using biochemical inhibitors to block the activity of Ras/ERK (PD 98059), RhoA/Rock (Y-27632), and NHE (ethylisopropylamiloride). Specific hypotheses about NHE activation using these inhibitors alone and with the addition of LPA were made. Immunoblotting was conducted to investigate extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. Intracellular pH changes were measured using spectroscopy of fluorescent intensity after subjection to a pH sensitive dye (2’,7’-bis-carboxylethyl-5-(6-)carboxyfluorescem). Cell growth was calculated using a wound healing assay, and stress fiber formation was measured by staining actin filaments using fluorescein conjugated phalloidin. Results indicated that the Ras/ERK pathway plays a critical role in NHE activation and the RhoA/Rock pathway is vital for stress fiber formation in the breast cancer cell line.

THE EFFECT OF GOT2B MOUSSE ON HAIR TENSILE STRENGTH OVER TIME
Jimmy Le, Aniket Shah
Berkmar High School , Lilburn , Georgia, United States of America

<br><br> The purpose of this experiment is to determine the effect of Got2b hair styling mousse on hair tensile strength at specified periods of time. It was hypothesized that the hair tensile strength would decrease over time due to the polyquaternium-77 and polyquaternium-55, which are considered to be irritating and toxic. The first step of the procedure is to apply mousse to all the hair strands. Then, put all the hair strands into a zip-lock bag. After eight hours, take out the hair strands and continue by hanging weights on each strand until they tear. After the measured weight for each hair strand is acquired, record and analyze this data on a chart to make observations. It has been concluded that the negative effect on the hair tensile strength was due to the toxic chemicals in the Got2b mousse such as the wheat proteins, polyquaternium-55, and polyquaternium-77. <br><br>

CATALYZING ACETALDEHYDE OXIDATION USING CURCUMIN
Ashwin Kumar Malynur, Daivik Orth, 
Beaverton High School, Beaverton, OR

The goal of this experiment was to determine whether or not the indian spice turmeric could inhibit the harmful nucleophilic reactions between acetaldehyde and proteins. Acetaldehyde, a carcinogenic and mutagenic byproduct of alcohol metabolism is a known nucleophile. Acetaldehyde, in alcohol metabolism and in our experiment, is further oxidized to acetic acid. Curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric is also nucleophilic. We predicted that, due to the nucleophilic dominance of curcumin, the acetaldehyde would react with the curcumin rather than the important proteins. We simulated this by putting acetaldehyde into egg white, which is primarily composed of the protein ovalbumin. We measured over the course of four hours pH to see the extent to which acetaldehyde reacted nucleophilically with the amino acid sequence to produce acetic acid. We then introduced turmeric to the solution to determine if the pH more rapidly decreased than without the turmeric. We observed that the pH with the turmeric had a greater pH change than without the turmeric by a factor of 10 demonstrating that reactions between acetaldehyde and turmeric took place, supporting our hypothesis. We can infer from this that turmeric inhibits acetaldehyde-ovalbumin protein modifications. The health implications of this are vast. Proteins, when modified by foreign substances, usually become disfunctional. The fact that turmeric can inhibit these protein modifications is evidence for possible remedies for various diseases.

THE POSSIBLE STRESS-INDUCED VARIATION OF THE CIRCADIAN CORTISOL CYCLE
Alexandra Berger Valente, Mariana Hymans Sanchez Netto, 
Escola Americana de Campinas, Campinas, Sao Paulo, BRASIL

A person’s stress level can be induced by several factors, one of those being tests and deadlines. In this research the stress level is quantified by the concentration of salivary cortisol. Cortisol is a steroid that is produced in the Hypothalamus, and stimulated by the concentration of Glucocorticoids in the blood stream, eventually it will attach to the Glucocorticoids and cause several metabolic variations in the functioning of the body. The normal cortisol concentration cycle follows an initial exponential growth followed by a decay (which coincides with waking up and going to bed). With this experiment the expected variation would be either a plateau after the exponential growth or several peaks both followed by a decay.<br><br> The subjects of the research were 10th grade (15-16 years old) students and high school teachers. Subjects sampled their saliva several times throughout the day. The times of the sampling were at waking up, 30 minutes after, before and after their tests, another one at noon, and the last sample being at six pm. The teachers followed the same routine, sampling their saliva six times, just as the students. Besides sampling their saliva, all subjects had to fill out a stress questionnaire, in order to serve as a comparison with the saliva results. <br><br> The data was analyzed and the conclusion taken was that exams affect, but insignificantly the normal Cortisol production in the body. Therefore the hypothesis was rejected.

IMPROVING THE LIFE CONSERVATION: NEW PURPOSES TO SEPARATE LACTOBIONIC ACID AND SORBITOL
Juliana Hoch, Eduardo Thadeu Rodrigues,

Brazil is the second country that makes organ transplant surgeries in the world, trailing only the United States. Nowadays, has one of the largest programs of organ and tissue transplants in the world, which is based in the Spanish system, considered the most developed of the planet. However, a number of factors act directly on the infrastructure of this system, indicating a drop of more than 70% of all organs that can be transplanted. An important factor is the preservation of these organs, which is made through liquids that retain the cellular structure of tissues. These liquiss have lactobionic acid in large quantities in their composition. This organic acid is produced from the enzymatic oxidation of lactose, was obtained in solution with equimolar quantity of sorbitol. Today, the separation process of these compounds is effected by electrodialysis, a complex separation process that adds a high cost in the amount of the reagent. With this in mind we sought an alternative separation of these two compounds using two different methods. One of these methods is based on the chemical principle, where the separation is made from chemical reactions. The other method uses the action of microorganisms that are capable of degrading only one compound of the blend. Both methods aim at reducing the price of the reagent, reducing the cost of lactobionic acid, giving a greater hope for those people in the queue waiting for an organ transplant.

AN INVESTIGATION OF MOLECULAR EVIDENCE OF DROUGHT RESISTANCE IN ORYZAE SATIVA
Rebecca Mary Huebsch, Whitney Carow, 
Perham High School, Perham, MN

Rice (Oryzae sativa) provides more than one fifth of the calories consumed worldwide by humans. Though this plant is native to Asia and southeastern Africa, it is considered a staple around the world, especially in the East, South, and Southeast Asia. Rice is the major food group in third world countries. Some species of rice are believed to possess a drought resistant gene, allowing the plant to survive harsher conditions. If it were possible to find this gene and transfer it to other species of rice it would be possible to increase rice production exponentially. In this study, we investigated the genome rice searching using bioinformatics for evidence of a drought resistant gene. Polymerase chain reaction was then used to determine if any of the tested varieties contained the gene. In some varieties we were able to prove that there is not a drought resistant gene, and in others, the data suggests that the gene is present.

TESTING THE RESILIN FROM VARIOUS INSECTS TO DETERMINE THE MOST EFFICIENT SUBSTITUTE FOR HUMAN ELASTIN
Christopher Thomas Giblin, Erika Michelle Giblin
Palm Bay High, Melbourne, Florida, USA

The purpose of this project is to derive a compatible substitute for human elastin from the super-resilient insect protein resilin, to replace damaged elastin in cases such as arthritis. The researchers hypothesized that resilin derived from the wing base of the fruit fly will most resemble human elastin.<br><br> Four different insect species were cultured for testing: house cricket, fruit fly, American cockroach, and adult mealworms. Each insect was anesthetized, and their appropriate appendage for testing removed; either the tegmina (wing used for flight) or T3 (hind leg). The appendages were set in separate culture dishes and frozen until designated plates were made. To prepare the plates, a 5 mm layer of nutrient agar was poured onto the bottom of each of 20 petri dishes. The agar was hardened over night and the appendages placed on their appropriate plate. 1 mL of Escherichia coli was applied to the plates the following day and incubated at 37¢ªC over night. After 48 hours, 2 mL of 0.5g/1L isopropyl-¥â-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was sprayed over the cultures of E. coli, driving the bacteria to replicate the existing resilin while in incubation for another 24 hours. The cultures, cleaned with distilled water, were placed into 20 small cuvettes per specie and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes, producing a small pellet containing resilin. The cuvettes were decanted and the pellets analyzed utilizing the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis technique, all of which was repeated for five consecutive trials.<br><br> In conclusion, the results supported the hypothesis. Resilin derived from the fruit fly produced the closest relation to human elastin.<br><br>

TEMPERATURE INDUCED STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL CHANGES IN HUMAN SECRETED PHOSPHOLIPASE A2
Gennifer Reid Rubin, Audrey C. Leasure, 
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, FL

Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is a large family of enzymes that cleaves the sn-2 ester bond of the membrane phospholipids, releasing a free fatty acid and a lysophospholipid. One of the products is arachidonic acid, which is a potent mediator of inflammation and allergies. PLA2 activity substantially increases upon binding to the surface of phospholipids membrane, an effect known as interfacial activation. It has been previously proposed that structural changes in the protein may contribute to interfacial activation. Human groups of secreted PLA2s, IIA and IB, require millimolar concentrations of calcium chloride for catalytic activity. <br><br> The effects of temperature transitions and the structural conformation of phospholipid membranes on the activation of human secreted PLA2 are examined in this experiment. The focus of this work is to investigate the structure and function relations of the enzyme Phospholipase A2 group IIA, as determined by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy techniques. These results were compared to previously obtained results from group 1B to discover the unknown advantages of IB’s isoform, IIA. <br><br> It was found that the optimal temperature is around 40 degrees Celsius. As the temperature reaches this point, the a-helices of the protein begin to loosen for membrane insertion. This event is not present in IB’s membrane insertion, which makes IIA potentially more active. The data show that the optimal temperature for activity is around 40°C and the mode of membrane binding adapts for preeminent activity. Further studies on this topic will target exactly how this increased activity of PLA2 IIA will help in medical advantages towards neurodegenerative diseases, allergies, and other commonly known illnesses.

NANOSCALE VIP (VERY IMPORTANT PROTEINS) TRANSPORT
Fabian Ferdinand Oehler, Simon Weisemann
Gymnasium am Markt, Bunde, GERMANY

In modern biochemical research, sample quantities of chemical substances are becoming smaller and smaller and separation processes have to become more accurate. Moreover high-potency drugs for cancer-therapy are developed and have to be delivered to closely defined regions in the human body. <br><br>We designed special Fe3O4@SiO2 core-shell nanoparticles with a diameter of about 100 nm. On the surface we attached chemically activated carboxyl functional groups to bind nearly every polypeptide. Thus it is possible to make use of the magnetic character of the core and of the specific biological qualities of the particular polypeptide. Those two features can now be used for instance to carry cytostatic agents like Mitomycin C to cancer cells only with the help of a magnetic field. Another application is the magnetic separation. As an example, we coupled the lectine Concanavalin A which makes it possible to part a racemate of D-Glucoses by extracting the alpha-enantiomer.<br><br>It was very important for the technical implementation of this 3-step synthesis to check the success of each synthesis step before continuing. To assess the necessary quantities of the chemicals, a uniform particle size distribution was relevant. Various measurement series were needed to optimize the synthesis of the core-shell particles. The success of our biofunctionalization was checked by infrared spectroscopy (IR-ATR).<br><br>The very useful achievements of this project are twofold. First, our nanocomposites are atoxic and can be introduced into the human body. Secondly, the very small size of the particles combined with the hypersensitivity of the linked polypeptides establishes a new degree of accuracy in biochemical analytics.

EVALUATION OF IN VITRO EFFECT OF SELECTED FOOD ITEMS ON PLATELET AGGREGATION
Nikhil M Thatte , Samhita Rao A
IES VN Sule Guruji English Medium Secondary School, Dadar, Mumbai - 400 014

The search for a drug that inhibits platelet aggregation without upsetting its primary physiological role of haemostasis continues. We conceived this study to evaluate whether common food items like orange, sweet lime, cucumber and lemon have anti-platelet effects. We obtained Institutional Ethics Committee permission and written informed consent from 16 healthy male volunteers who satisfied all inclusion criteria. Twenty ml blood was collected and processed to obtain working platelet rich plasma (WPRP) containing 2x1,00,000 platelets/ml. In Phase I, WPRP was incubated with varying dilutions of cucumber, orange, lemon, sweet limejuice to assess whether they affected platelet viability. Those dilutions that did not affect platelet viability were selected for Phase II where platelet aggregation was studied using an automated platelet aggregocorder. Maximum percentage aggregation induced by 5 microM ADP in presence of distilled water, Aspirin (50 microM) or various dilutions of the test agents was recorded and percentage inhibition of aggregation was calculated. Student's 't' test was used for statistical analysis. All the test agents inhibited platelet aggregation to varying degrees. The percentage inhibition produced by undiluted cucumber juice (39.15±4.86) was comparable to that produced by aspirin (35.05±2.93). Ongoing studies indicate that undiluted cucumber juice may enhance the effect of aspirin, and this is now being confirmed. We are also testing dose related response with these juices. Flavonoids or Vitamin E - documented to have anti-platelet aggregation effects could be the cause of the anti-platelet aggregation effects produced by the food items as these are reported to be present in the food items. We would like to identify and isolate the active constituents in these food items.

HOW TEMPERATURE AFFECTS CIRCULATING CONCENTRATIONS OF THE CARBOHYDRATES TREHALOSE AND GLUCOSE IN THE HEMOLYMPH OF TANNER CRABS (CHIONOECETES BAIRDI)
Sally Paul, Erin Gaffaney, 
Juneau-Douglas High School, Juneau, AK

To determine how temperature affects the concentration of carbohydrates in Tanner crab (Chionoecetes bairdi), we exposed 15 Tanner crabs to three different temperature treatments of approximately 4ºC (ambient), approx. 10ºC, and approx. 17ºC. They spent one week at the two lower temperatures, but due to the extremity of the 17˚C and its effect on their health, they were maintained at this temperature for only 18 hours. After each temperature treatment, approximately 0.7 mL of hemolymph was sampled from each crab from which we determined the concentrations of glucose and trehalose.<br><br> Our results showed significant differences (P<0.05) in both the glucose and trehalose levels when crabs were held at different temperatures, with the lowest glucose level at 10ºC and the lowest trehalose level at 17ºC.<br><br> We also compared our data to Dungeness crab (Metacarcinus magister) and Bering Sea snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) data. We found a significant difference (P<0.05) in the glucose levels of the species. When comparing trehalose, our data was not completely different with an overall P>0.05. However, we ran a post-hoc analysis to uncover specific differences, and found a significant difference (P<0.05) between the trehalose levels of Dungeness and snow crab.<br><br> Our results are important because trehalose is becoming an important carbohydrate in diabetic research, cryogenics, and organ transplants. Understanding how trehalose works in species that use it as a primary blood sugar helps us better understand its significance to humans.

RECYCLING COFFEE GROUNDS: A SUSTENTABLE AND ENVIROMENTAL FRIENDLY BIOREMEDIATION FOR "SOLENOPSIS INVICTA".
Maria del Mar Vera, Alejandro de la Villa
Colegio De La Salle, Bayamon, Puerto Rico

Commercial insecticides have proven to be harmful to human health and enviroment. The insecticides of vegetable origin are not necessarily innocuous. A material considered to be rubbish like the coffee grounds to control ants "Solenopsis invicta" was studied. If coffee grounds in a solid state conserve aromatic properties and in a solution contain active ingredients with toxic properties, then the coffee grounds could act as repellent and could be an insecticide. For each case, the investigation was conducted in-vitro with the creation of microcosm of ants and in-situ with ants in the enviroment. Bioassay were also conducted to determined toxicity, repellence and insecticide activity. Also, the solution was tested for pH. In-vitro, the coffee grounds and the solution tends to act as repellent. In-situ experimentation, the repellent activity was proven to be an effective catalyst in the ant migration. In the bioassay using "Phaseolus vulgaris" the toxicity of the solution was determined. The bioassay with brine shrimps to determined citotoxic activity was more effective with concentrated solution, as the concemtration increase the count of living organisms decreases. It is concluded that the solid coffee grounds and its solution tends to act as a repellent. At a greater concentration of the solution insecticide activity can be present. That datum tends to indicate possible bioremediative characteristics of the coffee grounds in the control of "Solenopsis invicta". In order to determine if caffeine is the component that demonstrates insecticide activity, a chemical analysis of the solution was proposed.

THE USE OF CLICK-CHEMISTRY AND THE TETRAZINE-NORBORNENE COMPLEX TO SYNTHESIZE HERCEPTIN RADIOLABELLED TO ZR-89 AND GA-67
Gabriel Isaac Weissmann, Priya Mohindra, 
Horace Greeley High School, Chappaqua, NY

Antibodies labeled with radioactive nuclides have emerged as simple devices that are very suitable for use in imaging cancer cells. However, the method by which these devices are constructed is intricate and inefficient. The antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) was successfully radiolabeled with 89Zr and 67Ga, using copper free click chemistry. Using the tetrazine-norbornene complex to attach our radionuclide to the antibody we demonstrated that a) tetrazine joined to the radioactive metal, b) norbornene attached to the Herceptin and c) the norbornene and tetrazine “clicked” in order to form the entire complex. We further discovered an alternative way for combining the radionuclides to the Herceptin. In this method, the tetrazine was not bound to the radionuclide but to the norbornene and Herceptin. Then, the radionuclide was successfully added to the tetrazine-norbornene-herceptin complex. This shows the efficiency and versatility of this synthesis process, which can enable scientists to use a variety of radionuclides coupled with different antibodies to target different types of cancer.

EFFECT OF ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS ON TANSHINONE CONTENT AND RELATED SYNTHESIS GENE EXPRESSION OF SALVIA MILTIORRHIZA BUNGE
Xinyan Yang, Junjun Wu, Wenqi Lu
No. 7 High School of Chengdu City, Chengdu, Sichuan, CHINA

Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge) had been classified its natures as stopping pain, promoting blood circulation and so on. In this study, danshen was put in different conditions (illumination time, temperature and moisture) for 30 days. Total RNA was extracted from its root, stem and leaf separately. Then, acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (AACT), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGS), l-Deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR), farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS) which involved in tanshinone IIA metabolic pathway were cloned by semi-quantitative reverse transcription and PCR. Meanwhile, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to test the content of tanshinone IIA . The FPPS transcription level was significant different in various organs and was positively correlated with the content of tanshinone IIA . The results suggested that illumination time was the most significant environmental factor which affect the content of tanshinone IIA . FPPS was the key rate-limiting enzyme in tanshinone IIA biosynthesis pathway in the Salvia miltiorrhiza. The best conditions for tanshinone IIA synthesis were: 20 degree centigrade, 8 h/D illumination time and the soil water holding capacity of the largest 100 percent. This research may provide a possibility to study tanshinone IIA biosynthesis pathway.<br><br>Key words: tanshinone IIA , semi-quantitative reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction, transcription level, the best condition

HOW PH AFFECTS INITIAL BIOLUMINESCENCE AND RECOVERY OF BIOLUMINESCENCE THE DINOFLAGELLATE PYROCYSTIS FUSIFORMIS
Patrick Alexander Hoke, Devon Daniel Smith Kibby
Juneau Douglas High School, Juneau, AK, United States 

The project objective was to evaluate how changes in pH affect bioluminescence in dinoflagellates. Dinoflagellates are single-celled algae found in marine waters throughout the world. Bioluminescence can be used for survival purposes; a common theory is that the dinoflagellates glow like a "burglar alarm" when predators try to feed on them.<br><br> For our experiments we obtained and grew a stock supply of dinoflagellate Pyrocystis fusiformis and allowed the cultures to adapt to a 12:12 hour light: dark cycle for four weeks. During the dark cycle pH was adjusted in 200 mL cultures, and the bioluminescence was recorded on a 0-12 scale by agreement of two people. To determine recovery of bioluminescence, mechanical swirling was required for stimulation. We could not measure the bioluminescence output of the cells (estimated at < .019 µmoles photons/m^2/s) with the light meters available, therefore the 0-12 rating scale was established.<br><br> When the acidity was increased, the cells started to bioluminesce requiring no mechanical stimulation. Below a threshold of 6.9 there was a significant negative linear trend between pH and bioluminescence. For pH of 6.9 and above no bioluminescence was recorded without mechanical stimulation. Of note, lowering pH stimulated the bioluminescence for up to a minute, whereas mechanical stimulation lasted <1 second.<br><br> The general luciferin-luciferase reaction is very efficient at producing light and could have potential applications as a low energy light source. A more pragmatic application of bioluminescence is as an indication of cancerous cells. When attached the bioluminescence reaction would identify cancerous cells.<br><br>

DETECTION OF CREATINE PHOSPHOKINASE USING POLYANILINE NYLON-6 FILM
Aashish Shah, Anastasia Efthymiou
Half Hollow Hills High School West, Dix Hills, New York, United States

Polyanilne Nylon-6 film can be used as a biosensor to detect various proteins and DNA in a sample. However, it has not yet been used to detect a specific enzyme in a solution. The purpose of this experiment was to detect the specific enzyme creatine phosphokinase (CPK) using polyaniline Nylon-6 film. In order for this to occur, the Nylon-6 films were made conductive by combining them with the positive polymer polyaniline. Polymerization of polyaniline was achieved through the use of hydrochloric acid, aniline, and ammonium persulfate. This conductive film was then used to test for the presence of bovine CPK in a solution of distilled water. A change in potentiometric response was observed, indicating that the film was able to detect the presence of the enzyme bovine CPK. After obtaining these results CK-BB (an isoenzyme of CPK found primarily in the brain) was also tested on the polyaniline Nylon-6 film. The enzyme was tested alone in distilled water first as a control to ensure that CK-BB could not be detected by the film. It was then tested on a film that had been deposited with the substrate adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The readings indicated that CK-BB could indeed be detected by the film which was deposited with the ATP. The experiment was successful, which suggests a possibility of detecting human creatine kinase. Elevated concentrations may also act as early indicators for several different health problems, especially concerning the brain.

Abstract<br><br>Abstract<br><br>This project was initially designed to test how well algae could reproduce while being spiked with different concentrations of lead and nickel. During the experiment it was decided to change it to, how the concentrations affected the growth. This was because it was easier to tell the algae were growing but not necessarily reproducing. Experimentation lead to the conclusion that algae infected with lead or nickel at any concentration will be harmful to the algae. For the experiment two experiments at each concentration were done and there were three control groups. The concentrations for this experiment were 3 ppm, 10 ppm, 20 ppm, and 30 ppm for each algae. After nine days most algae lost between 30% and 60% of their initial weight. One of the algae even lost about 65% of their initial body weight. All of the controls gained weight except for one and that one only lost about .2 g of its weight. After the second day the algae started to change color. By the third day the higher concentrations made the algae change from their healthy green color to an unhealthy brown and gray color. The controls stayed the healthy green color for the experiment and did not die. However, even though the algae died after nine days (some died sooner) the experiment was still a success. Because the algae were unable to grow normally and were unable to withstand against even the lowest concentrations, the MMSD limits should be lowered to protect aquatic life.

<br><br>This project was initially designed to test how well algae could reproduce while being spiked with different concentrations of lead and nickel. During the experiment it was decided to have a different approach, so it was decided to be changed to how nickel and lead effect chlorophyta growth. This was changed because with the human eye, one could see what was happening to the chlorophyta which is important because this project is meant to relate to a persons life. Experimentation led to the conclusion that algae infected with lead or nickel at any concentration will be harmful to the algae. For the experiment three experiments at each concentration were done and there were six control groups. The concentrations for this experiment were 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 20, and 30 ppm for each algae. After nine days most algae lost between 30% and 60% of their initial weight. One of the algae even lost about 65% of their initial body weight. Most of the controls gained weight except for two and those only did not lose much. After the second day the algae started to change color. By the third day the higher concentrations made the algae change from their healthy green color to an unhealthy brown and gray color. The controls stayed the healthy green color for the experiment and did not die. However, even though the algae died after nine days (some died sooner) the experiment was still a success.

The goal of the experiment is to identify the behavior of antioxidants in order to determine if temperature relates to the antioxidants’ functionality. <br><br>In this case the “functionality” of the antioxidant can be defined as its ability to oxidize free radicals. This would be the case if the S (measure of entropy and the slope) in the equation: ∆H = G + ∆S has a significant value. <br><br>Previous research on antioxidants has been done at room temperature. In order to determine if the temperature addresses functionality, we would need to find the entropy of selected antioxidants by plotting a pH vs. temperature graph. <br><br>With knowledge that temperature could affect behavior, this would determine how to conduct accurate and valid tests of antioxidants in conditions that would be more accurate to the fluctuations in temperature of the human body.

THE EFFECTS OF POTENTIAL ANESTHETICS ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF HUMPY SHRIMP (PANDALUS GONIURUS)
Ariana Gross, Amalia Tamone, 
Juneau-Douglas High School, Juneau, AK

To determine how potential anesthetics affect the nervous system of the Humpy shrimp, Pandalus goniurus, five diverse chemicals were tested (lidocaine, ice, ethanol, MS-222, and clove oil) and compared to a seawater control. Shrimp were immersed into beakers containing specific solutions for 14 minutes. Heart rates were counted every two minutes for six seconds by looking through the shrimp carapace at the heart using a dissecting microscope. That number was multiplied by ten to determine the heart beats per minute. Shrimp were returned to seawater for 15 minutes to determine recovery time. A separate group of shrimp was also immersed in individual treatments and their response to stimulation was determined using a tail-flip index. After 15 minutes of recovery in seawater, the tail flip index was measured again. The data was analyzed using an ANOVA and a post-hoc Bonferoni test to test for significance. This study rejects the null hypothesis that none of the treatments would affect the nervous system of P. goniurus. Clove oil and MS-222 were the best anesthetics because both of these treatments reduced heart rate and reaction to a stimulus. However, clove oil is potentially carcinogenic so it should only be used if the specimen isn’t intended for consumption. Because of the molecular diversity of these chemicals, some chemicals released in wastewater could be molecularly similar to some of these chemicals and thus have the same effects.

EVALUATION OF FUSAROCHROMANONE 101A: A NOVEL FUNGUS-DERIVED ANTI-CANCER DRUG
Yoon Jee Kim, Daniel Felty, 
Caddo Parish Magnet High School, Shreveport, LA

The overall goal of this project is two-fold. The first is to identify the molecular target(s) of Fusarochromanone, or FC101a, a mycotoxin produced by Fusarium equiseti, a symbiotic fungus of several cereal plants. Another goal was to test the hypothesis that FC101a suppresses tumor growth through induction of programmed cell death (apoptosis). The first goal was met using a powerful Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast genetics screening system. A ‘library’ of mutant S. cerevisiae strains, each with a different single non-essential gene deletion, was tested for sensitivity or resistance to FC101a, in order to identify genes that could play a role in FC101a activity. Yeast lacking expression of a caspase-like protein called Yca1 (yeast caspase 1), encoded by the YCA1 gene, was more sensitive to inhibition of proliferation by FC101a than the parent yeast strain, thereby identifying Yca1 as a possible target for FC101a action. Next, the detailed effects of FC101a on proliferation and apoptosis (programmed cell death) on a panel of different human tumor cell types (skin SCC, breast, prostate, bladder) were determined. It was shown that FC101a induces apoptosis had has effects on the cell cycle that are consistent with a suppression of proliferation. Interestingly, these effects were greatest for the most rapidly dividing cells. The data presented here shows that FC101a has the potential to be an effective cancer therapeutic drug. Its ability to suppress the viability of several different cancer cell types suggests that it could be beneficial for multiple cancers.

THE EFFECTS OF PEPPER JUICE (CAPSAICIN) AS A DAILY SUPPLEMENT ON HUMAN HEALTH
Heather Lynne Nielsen, Alex Keeler, Savannah Shaw
The Villages High School, The Villages, FL

The purpose of this project is to see if there are any human health benefits to taking a daily supplement of Pepper Juice (capsaicin). The researchers hypothesized that taking a daily dosage of one ounce of Pepper juice twice daily for three months should show some health benefits.<br><br> The procedure involved 20 human subjects, male and female, aged 18-78. They first were evaluated by a doctor to make sure they were in good enough health to participate. Once a doctor’s permission to participate was presented the subjects were required to have an initial blood sample drawn and tested for the baseline comparison. Then they began the study by taking a daily dosage of pepper juice (1/2 ounce twice a day a.m. and p.m.).The participants were to log their changes in sleep patterns, energy levels, appetite, bowel movements daily as well as record any health issues in their daily log book. Their blood samples were taken every four weeks for three months and their blood pressure was taken every two weeks at The Villages Clinical Laboratories. Results were sent to the researchers and doctor in charge. The blood tests tracked their standings in blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, LDL, glucose, and iron.<br><br> Results were tabulated, analyzed and graphed to show if any changes occurred. After three months, 60% of test subjects increased in energy levels, blood pressure was lowered in 75% of subjects, cholesterol was reduced in 45%, all subjects with constipation concerns were alleviated, patients with sleep issues were dissolved by 60% .In conclusion the researchers were able to support their hypothesis, a daily dosage of Pepper Juice does show benefits in human health. The Pepper Juice, as a natural substance did not show any ill side effects other than taste to 30 % of the subjects. 60 % of subjects said they would continue taking their dosage after testing because they believed that the Pepper Juice was better to take as a natural ingredient rather than any other type of commercially made substance.

Sohan Venkat Mikkilineni, Shravani Mikkilineni
Detroit Country Day School, Beverly Hills Michigan, United States

The purpose of the experiment was to determine if commonly consumed or used pesticides were harmful to health, especially that of growing organisms. The test solutions were made by capturing pesticides from various fruits, possible pesticides, and food preservatives, mixing the pesticide solution with a rearing solution and a mold inhibitor to make a solution in which the fertilized eggs were placed. These eggs were observed daily to find any incongruities with the stages created by Iwamatsu in 1994, and were frozen after 10 days. Over 200 photographs were painstakingly analyzed for any defect, even the slightest, like an enlarged spleen. A 2-proportion z-test was used to condense the data by determining the statistical significance of the numbers, and it revealed that the most harmful test solutions were the sodium metabisulfite (a preservative in wine) and the aluminum. The applications of this project are significant, with alarming statistics pointing to threats posed by many chemicals to the health of developing humans, like toddlers or unborn fetuses. The endocrine and neurological systems in developing humans are extremely vulnerable to ultra-low doses of toxins, and can have long-term effects that have never been identified by any government regulated tests. This breakthrough experiment has never been conducted by FDA-government research, as it explores the synergistic effects of a combination of pesticides in a real-world scenario.

TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF BIOLOGICAL SEED DRESSING ON THE GROWTH AND YEILD OF CROP
Zeeshan Ali Sayed, Vrishi Kumar Mahavir Patil
Shreerang Vidyalaya English Medium, Thane, Maharashtra, India

In India about 33% of agricultural produce are damaged by pests. Most of this damage occurs during the early stages of crop growth. Different methods are used to tackle this problem. Seed-dressing, considered an effective method, involves the use of dry or wet formulation applied directly to seeds. Prevalent seed-dressing treatments use chemicals that may cause health and environmental problems and are very costly.<br><br> <br><br>This project aimed to find out natural and cost-effective substitutes for harmful chemicals in seed-dressing. Based on earlier studies, leaves and seeds of neem (Azardirachata indica), custard apple (Annona squamosa)seeds and Aloe vera (Aloe vera L.) sap were chosen as seed-dressing alternatives. The crops Hibiscus esculantus and Dolicos lablab were selected for the study and their seeds were dressed with suitably prepared powders of the above biological materials. Eleven treatments of varying concentrations and combinations using the above materials were tried. Sample sizes for each treatment was 60 plants or more. The treated seeds were sown and the effects of treatment were monitored using six visible traits of the crop.<br><br> <br><br>Results of the experiments show that treated seeds were resistant to pest attack during the first 25 days. Plants from treated seeds also show enhanced growth and yield. The effects of biological seed-dressings are seen to be comparable with chemical seed-dressing. <br><br>This cost-effective dressing treatment can be easily formulated locally by farmers. Thus biological seed-dressing can be a potential alternative to the current methods of seed-dressing.<br><br>

BIOCHEMISTRY ACTION OF THE SPIDER WEB OF NEPHILA CLAVIPES IN THE HAEMOSTASIA PROCESS OF LUMBRICUS TERRESTRIS
Alex Antonio Sanchez-Claudio, Betsaira Sanabria-Rivera, 
Aurea E. Quiles Claudio High School, Guanica, PUERTO RICO

The purpose of this investigation was to detect if the spider web of Nephila clavipes acts as a natural coagulant when it comes in contact with the blood of the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris. The problem was: What is the effect of the spider web of Nephila clavipes in the blood coagulation of Lumbricus terrestris. The hypothesis formulated was that there are significant differences in the blood coagulation time of Lumbricus terrestris when the spider web is applied to it. The spider web was collected, weighed and processed into two samples: one in solid state and the other one processed with distilled water. Twenty seven earthworms were collected and divided into dissection trays. Earthworms in dissection tray “A” were treated with the spider web in distilled water, earthworms in dissection tray “B” were treated with the spider web in solid state and the ones in dissection tray “C” received no treatment. A vertical cut was performed to each earthworm and blood coagulation time was measured when a change of earthworm’s color was observed. Tissue regeneration process was verified after 24 hours of study. Chromatography demonstrated that the components of the spider web are related to proteins. Data analysis evidenced that the coagulation time and the tissue regeneration process were more effective when the spider web was used. It demonstrated that the spider web acts as a natural coagulant and repairs the blood vessels. The projection for this investigation is to perform coagulation tests with human blood samples using the spider web.

MICROARRAY ANALYSIS OF GENE EXPRESSION IN IN VITRO MODELS OF INDUCED MUSCULAR HYPERTROPHY AND ATROPHY
Ami Rebecca Amini, Ashley Ali Amini
Yorktown High School, Yorktown Heights, NY, USA

Skeletal muscle mass is determined by the balance between protein degradation and protein synthesis. Hypertrophy and atrophy refer to the abnormal increase or decrease in the diameter of muscle cells, and are caused by protein synthesis or degradation, respectively. Dexamethasone (DEX), a glucocorticoid, and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), an anabolic growth factor, have been proven to induce skeletal muscle atrophy and hypertrophy, respectively. Both are relatively small, lipid-soluble molecules that stimulate cells by binding to their receptors. The interaction between the hormone-receptor complex will trigger a cascade of events that will result in the interaction between a downstream effector and a specific receptor site on the nuclear DNA. As a consequence, up-regulation or down-regulation of certain genes will occur, which, in turn, will either activate or repress transcription of mRNA molecules, coded for specific proteins. However, the knowledge of which genes are specifically up-regulated or down-regulated has largely been limited due to the lack of technology. In this experiment, DNA microarrays make possible the rapid and thorough assessment of the transcriptional activity of hypertrophy-induced, or atrophy-induced C2C12 myotube models. Hundreds of genes were found to be significantly regulated in skeletal muscle hypertrophy and atrophy. More importantly, metallothionein-1, metallothionein-2, proliferin, and proliferin-3 were significantly and inversely regulated in both processes. These studies have identified promising targets for new potential pharmaceutical intervention.

THE ROLE OF PERSPIRATION CONSTITUENTS IN THE ATTRACTION OF CULEX PIPIENS TO HUMANS
Ruchi Jayesh Shah, Garima Yadav, 
Sachem High School North, Lake Ronkonkoma, NY

It is well known that the common mosquito species Culex pipiens transmits communicable diseases, such as dengue and malaria, which greatly impacts global human populations. Many studies indicate that carbon dioxide is a universal C. pipiens attractant, though other factors such as sweat, lactic acid, and odors produced by microflora on the skin may also have an effect. The purpose of our study was to determine which constituents in artificial perspiration were most attractive. C. pipiens were released into a custom-built and designed tank containing four cotton balls saturated with water, artificial perspiration, urea, and ammonia, respectively. It was hypothesized that, in competition with artificial perspiration and water, the high concentrations of ammonia and urea, which are nitrogen based compounds, would attract the most C. pipiens. Our data indicates that C. pipiens have a preference for ammonia and urea, suggesting that nitrogen plays a role in mosquito attraction. Further research using other nitrogen based compounds, CO2, lactic acid, and heat will increase our understanding of mosquito behavior as would analysis of human sweat samples to find the most attractive ratios. Ultimately, our goal is to create a globally marketable attractant that would be safer and more effective than current repellants. This knowledge would assist both the medical and scientific communities in reducing worldwide illnesses and deaths that are caused by mosquito borne diseases.

A KINETIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC STUDY OF HIV-1 SUBTYPE C I50L AND HIV-1 SUBTYPE B I50V PROTEASES
William Wilford Heise IV, Brian Covello, 
Canterbury School, Fort Myers, FL

Millions of people die because there are only protease inhibitors for HIV-1 subtype B. This research determined that some of these protease inhibitors can be used to treat other subtypes of HIV-1. The mutation of isoluthine to luthine on position 50 was recreated and tested. The mutated DNA was replicated using a PCR. Then it was introduced to the bacteria. This bacteria was incubated. The proteins were expressed and the cells were lysed with a French press. The proteins were isolated using a centrifuge. The results from this project come in the form of Ki values and inhibitor bound protease structures. Two of the inhibitors had a higher binding affinity with subtype C ritonavir and nelfinavir. Of the two inhibitors, Ritonavir bound better. This research team also focused on the specific naturally occurring polymorphism, I50V, which occurs when amprenavir and atazavir are utilized. The results of kinetic analysis tests and x-ray crystallography indicate that the protease inhibitors, nelfinavir and lopinavir, bound better when the I50V polymorphism occurs. This means that inhibitors not originally intended for certain HIV-1 subtypes can treat these subtypes. Treatment for various subtypes and mutations may already be developed and available on the market, saving many lives.

Low solubility drugs, especially those belonging to Class II according to the Biopharmaceutics Classification System, represent a major challenge to the pharmaceutical manufacturing and, therefore, the use of capable resources to promote a greater drug solubilization represents a quite feasible alternative. The aim of this study was to investigate a low solubility drug through the evaluation of the possible challenges faced by pharmacotechnicians in the production of medicines containing a low solubility drug and propose strategies to ensure the appropriate release of the active ingredient to its site of action. The drug chosen by us for this study was nimesulide (NMS), which is practically insoluble in water (10 µg/mL). We evaluated the physico-chemical properties of the NMS through ultraviolet-visible and infrared spectrophotometry and Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). We also evaluated the solubility of the drug and of marketed pharmaceutical products. In vitro NMS release was carried out as a function of pH and surfactant concentration of the medium. We developed a delivery system with polymers. Poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL) and chitosan microparticles were prepared as a carrier for NMS through the emulsion and solvent evaporation method. The characterization of the delivery systems developed showed that the particles have micrometric size. In vitro dissolution profiles demonstrate that microparticulate system can be employed such as a modified release. PCL microparticles obtained are a promising delivery system to encapsulate NMS for anti-inflamatory therapy and can be used to other low solubility drugs.

ANALYZING PROTEIN CONTENT IN COMMON VEGETARIAN MEAT SUBSTITUTES
Marie Elizabeth Gotti, Nicole Emanuel, 
Polaris K-12 School, Anchorage, AK

The problem concerning vegetarian diets and whether they can obtain the recommended daily amount of protein has become a pressing issue as vegetarianism continues to gain in popularity. In this study, we determined if typical plant-based protein sources consumed as meat substitutes in a vegetarian diet provide the daily amount of protein needed in an average person’s diet. Additionally, we compared the diversity of proteins in various vegetarian meat substitutes and in meat. The protein sources we studied were chicken breast, salmon, garbanzo beans, lentils, peanuts, pinto beans, and soy beans (edamame). We used SDS-PAGE to determine the diversity of proteins in each sample, while the Lowery method was used to determine the quantity of proteins in each sample. The results obtained show that the samples taken from animal tissue had denser proteins than the samples taken from plant tissue. In addition, the plant samples lacked in some of the diversity that the meat samples exhibited. However, the results did show that a proper vegetarian diet can obtain the same quantity of proteins as a non-vegetarian diet. Through an analysis of our samples that took protein diversity and quantity into account, lentil was found to be the best protein source and meat substitute. These findings demonstrate that by consuming a large variety of proteins, the body can function to the best of its ability, resulting in a long and healthy life.

APPLICATION OF T4 BACTERIOPHAGES IN REAL-LIFE SCENARIOS
Casey Estelle Hicks, Leah Powers
Vista Ridge High School, Cedar Park, TX

This topic was chosen because of the researchers’ previous interest in bacteria and the increasing need for an alternative in dealing with antibiotic resistant bacteria. If E. coli bacteria on produce and biofilms are exposed to high temperature or high UV radiation, then the amount of bacteria will decrease and the bacteriophage will be more effective in eliminating the bacteria. For the experiment, E. coli bacteria was swabbed onto the produce and allowed to grow for one day, then T4 bacteriophage was applied onto the produce. Another batch of fruit sat without treatment to act as a control group. A diluted batch of E. coli B was placed in a sterile tube with a grooved plastic slide until a biofilm was formed, then the bacteriophage with Lysozyme added was applied onto the biofilm, also a control group of biofilms with coliphage infection but no enzyme, was created. After growth was allowed, the biofilms were plated and the total number of colonies was recorded for comparison. Upon looking at plates taken from produce with just bacteria and then also after the produce had been infected with virus, the plates taken from the produce after it had been exposed to the bacteriophage virus were between 53% and 76% less dense. Biofilms with the virus were 52% and those with virus and enzyme were 68% less dense.

AN INTEGRATED SMART CHIP FOR THE EARLY DIAGNOSIS OF CANCER: A NEW TAKE ON SURFACE MOLECULAR IMPRINTING
JinJu Yi, Vijay Jain
Plainview-Old Bethpage John F Kennedy High School, Plainview, New York, USA

High sensitivity detection of biological molecules has always been a topic of much interest since it has numerous clinical applications. Recently, renewed interest has been sparked by concerns regarding the proliferation of biological warfare agents. In the latter case, it is also important that the sensor provides a rapid response and requires very small amounts of sample. Here we show that these requirements can easily be met by combining the techniques of molecular imprinting with the production of self-assembled monolayers of hydroxyl alkanethiolate molecules on gold surfaces, where the sensing element and the transducer are integrated into a smart chip. We show that these sensors can detect, in nanogram quantities, the cancer marker carcinoembryonic antigen, cathepsin-B, cathepsin-D, and the picorna-type poliovirus. The detection yielded a sensitivity of 10-11 mol/L, detection ability to parts per trillion, and application detection contingent to molecular structure. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of our detector for the selective in vitro sensing of cancerous tissue in cell media without the interference of the ambient proteins. Hence, this technology can also be potentially implanted in vivo and monitored externally.

LIPOIC ACID INHIBITS CREB GENE EXPRESSION IN REGENERATING HYDRA
Ashley Deane Kepping, Joanne Hsieh
Northport High School, Northport, NY 11768

The nerve cell differentiation, observed within the first 4 hours of regeneration in hydra, relies on the stimulating effect of Head Activator (an endogenous neuropeptide) on the cAMP signal transduction pathway. The result of this activation can be measured as an increase in cAMP, followed by elevation in levels of a transcription factor, cAMP Response Element Binding protein (CREB). Lipoic acid inhibits regeneration in hydra, but only when administered during this critical 4 hour 'window' immediately after 'decapitation'. This suggested to us that lipoic acid might interfere with cAMP signal transduction pathway. We tested this hypothesis using RTPCR to assay regenerating hydra for expression of CREB mRNA. We chose to use paired comparisons after 3 hours of regeneration rather than a full time-course since in a previous experiment we were unable to obtain enough RNA to do RTPCR for each time point of the assay. The results of this experiment show that lipoic acid does inhibit CREB gene expression in regenerating hydra. In the course of this experiment an unexpected result was obtained. We report the discovery of an intron in the 3' region of the gene that differs in molecular weight in Hydra viridissima and Hydra vulgaris. Finally, our primers detect isoforms of CREB gene expression in both regenerating and non-regenerating hydra.

LEVODOPA'S EFFECT ON ENDOGENOUS MORPHINE PRODUCTION AND THE MU3 OPIATE RECEPTOR IN SHSY5Y CELLS
Kamalakar Atluri, Dhruv Vasishtha
Herricks Senior High School, New Hyde Park, NY, USA

Morphine, an alkaloid from the Papaver somniferum (opium poppy plant), is a powerful analgesic and the drug of choice for the rapid pain relief of patients, though it is highly addictive. Numerous studies have shown low levels of morphine in animal and human tissues; until recently, these minute amounts of morphine were thought to be of dietary origin (exogenous). However, irrefutable evidence of endogenous morphine, morphine that is produced naturally within the cell, was presented in a mass spectrometry experiment using isotopic oxygen that was shown to be incorporated in the morphine molecule. Endogenous morphine is produced via a biosynthetic pathway that features chemical precursors like reticuline, norlaudanosoline, and levodopa (L-Dopa). This novel project shows that SH-SY5Y (neuroblastoma) cells treated with known amounts of L-Dopa produced morphine endogenously, as quantitatively measured by Radioimmunoassay (RIA), after solid-phase extraction. Furthermore, the expression of the MƒÝ3 Opiate Receptor (MOR) was upregulated in SH-SY5Y cells treated with L-Dopa, as evaluated by RT-PCR. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that a morphine precursor like L-Dopa leads to the biosynthesis and production of morphine in animal tissue. Moreover, these results suggest the exciting possibility that a morphine precursor may be administered for palliative care, instead of morphine.

SYSTEMATIC PROBING REVEALS REQUIREMENT OF PI(3)K/AKT/MTOR PATHWAY IN GENETIC SIGNATURE OF MUSCLE HYPERTROPHY
Ashley Ali Amini, Ami Rebecca Amini
Yorktown High School, Yorktown Heights, New York, USA

Muscle atrophy is observed in conditions such as aging, sepsis, food deprivation, cancer cachexia, and prolonged bedrest. Although ways to induce both skeletal muscle atrophy and hypertrophy have been demonstrated, it is still unclear which genes and cell signaling pathways are sufficient to regulate these inverse processes. In this experiment, we conduct genetic analyses of skeletal muscle atrophy and hypertrophy. Hundreds of genes are significantly regulated in atrophy and hypertrophy, but we isolate six genes that are both significantly and inversely regulated in these opposing processes. These inversely-regulated genes are thus potential novel genetic markers of atrophy and hypertrophy. Moreover, we demonstrate that the PI(3)K/Akt/mTOR pathway is necessary and sufficient to mediate genetic expression changes during hypertrophy. From these findings, new anti-atrophy treatments may be found by targeting genes that promote hypertrophy and block atrophy. <br><br>

HOW TO OBTAIN THE HIGHEST YIELDS OF DIGLYCIDYL TEREPHTHALATE AND DIGLYCIDYL SUCCINATE USED FOR BUILDING BIODEGRADABLE SCAFFOLDS FOR TISSUE REGENERATION
Priscila Elena Llaverias, Le Hien Phan, Gray Barnett
Chamblee Charter High School, Chamblee, GA

In this project we manipulated the independent variable time to maximize the yields of diglycidyl succinate and diglycidyl terephthalate which can be used to build scaffolds for tissue regeneration. By maximizing the yields, the process of building biodegradable scaffolds becomes more efficient which in turn will aid in the field of tissue engineering. We performed this experiment by running three trials of two separate reactions lasting eight hours in which one yielded diglycidyl terephthalate, and the other yielded diglycidyl succinate. For the DGT reaction we used stoichiometric calculations to find the amount of each reactant we would use, ran the reaction and took an aliquot sample out at each hour, and then distilled, fractionated, and purified our product to calculate the percent yield. For the DS reaction one of the only differences was that we took an aliquot sample out every hour starting with the fourth hour after starting the reaction. After a week and a half long process of distillation, fraternization, and purification of our products for each trial, we found that the highest yield of DS was 53.4% at the sixth hour and 93.96% for DGT at the fourth hour of the reaction. Thus, we concluded that based on the percent yields we found for each product at each hour, the highest yield of DS occurs somewhere between the fifth and the sixth hour of the reaction while the highest yield of DGT occurs somewhere between the third and fourth hour.

A NEW SPIN ON GREEN ENERGY: INCREASING HYDROGEN EVOLUTION IN A SPIRULINA DERIVED PHOTOBIOLOGICAL SYSTEM
Megan M Kurohara, Hannah Rojeski, 
Hilo High School, Hilo, HI

Our project explores a 100% renewable way to generate hydrogen. In our project we replicated a self-organizing photobiological system to produce hydrogen in vitro, and we tested the effect affordable catalysts had on the systems hydrogen evolution. We hypothesized that using a nonmetallic catalyst would increase the rate of hydrogen evolution.<br><br> To test our hypothesis we first isolated the photosystem of cyanobacteria Spirulina, to form a crude lysate, which was later combined with electron carrier cytochrome-c6, to form a self-assembling hydrogen producing system. We conducted trials by adding different catalysts to our system, and recording the change in pH of the system over 2 light/dark cycles. Each individual cycle spanned 2 hours, for a total of 8 hours per trial. The catalysts we tested were: FeSO4, ZnSO4, and Cu2O. As a control, we conducted a trial using no catalyst.<br><br> We observed that during the light cycles, hydrogen evolution peaked, and during the dark cycles, hydrogen evolution dropped. Also, hydrogen evolution peaked higher during the second light cycle when compared to the first. Each catalyst followed the same trend; however they each differed in their degrees of change.<br><br> Based on the change in pH, we were able to calculate the mols of hydrogen produced throughout our experiment. Our hypothesis was supported, because there was a significant increase in hydrogen production when a catalyst was present. We were able to additionally conclude that the best catalyst tested was FeSO4.<br><br> For future experimentation, we hope to genetically modify Spirulina to produce hydrogen as a living-system, once we gain a more comprehensive understanding of how the system works and the effect different variables have on it.

A tumor-specific marker for pancreatic carcinoma (PaCa) could help save the lives of >30,000 people. PaCa-Ag1, identified by mAb3C4, is a novel PaCa-specific antigen that is a potential candidate for the development of therapeutic and diagnostic tools. This study further characterized the antigen by its response to immunological (antibody interaction) and biochemical (enzyme treatment) attack. More specifically, the aims were: 1) to determine, through immuno-electron microscopy, the location of PaCa-Ag1 on PaCa cells, 2) to define the fate of PaCa-Ag1, through confocal microscopy, after binding to its specific monoclonal antibody, and 3) to examine the effect of various proteases on PaCa-Ag1 using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry.<br><br> Immuno-electron microscopy revealed the presence of PaCa-Ag1 on the cell surface in both rodent and human PaCa cells. After allowing the cells to begin endocytosis, internalization of PaCa-Ag1 into the endosomal compartment of PaCa cells was observed through confocal microscopy. This occurrence proposes the possibility of developing toxin-linked immunotherapeutics targeting PaCa cells. <br><br> Protease treatment suggested that PaCa-Ag1 is trypsin and chymotrypsin sensitive and further experimentation showed the re-expression of the antigen. The removal of PaCa-Ag1 by these enzymes indicates the possibility of PaCa-Ag1’s presence in extracellular fluid, therefore allowing for the development of an early diagnostic assay for PaCa. Carboxypeptidase B and elastase treatment surprisingly changed PaCa-Ag1’s distribution on the cell membrane into “caps”, altering the cells’ shape into a migratory cellular morphology. This can be seen as a novel phenomenon partly explaining the early and widespread metastasis of pancreatic cancer cells. <br><br>

AN INTEGRATED SMART CHIP FOR THE EARLY DIAGNOSIS OF CANCER: A NEW TAKE ON SURFACE MOLECULAR IMPRINTING
JinJu Yi, Vijay Jain
Plainview Old-Bethpage John F. Kennedy High School

High sensitivity detection of biological molecules has always been a topic of much interest since it has numerous clinical applications. Recently, renewed interest has been sparked by concerns regarding the proliferation of biological warfare agents. In the latter case, it is also important that the sensor provides a rapid response and requires very small amounts of sample. Here we show that these requirements can easily be met by combining the techniques of molecular imprinting with the production of self-assembled monolayers of hydroxyl alkanethiolate molecules on gold surfaces, where the sensing element and the transducer are integrated into a smart chip. We show that these sensors can detect, in nanogram quantities, the cancer marker carcinoembryonic antigen, cathepsin-B, cathepsin-D, and the picorna-type poliovirus. The detection yielded a sensitivity of 10-11 mol/L, detection ability to parts per trillion, and application detection contingent to molecular structure. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of our detector for the selective in vitro sensing of cancerous tissue in cell media without the interference of the ambient proteins. Hence, this technology can also be potentially implanted in vivo and monitored externally.

INHIBITION OF HUMAN P450 2E1: A POSSIBLE ANTI-CARCINOGENIC ROLE FOR ISOTHIOCYANATES
Arthi Sridar, Malati Vadapalli
Novi High School, Novi, Michigan, United States

Current studies presume that the greatest factor that causes lung cancer is the long-term exposure to carcinogens and pro-carcinogens, the most lethal cancer of all cancers. Research has also shown that inhaling second hand smoke may be a cause of lung cancer in some individuals. Pro-carcinogens are relatively harmless unless they are metabolized into the cancer-causing chemicals. In the human lung, the cytochrome P450 2E1 plays an important role in metabolizing pro-carcinogens and other components found in tobacco into reactive intermediates that may lead to lung cancer. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether two naturally occurring compounds found in cruciferous vegetables were able to inhibit P450 2E1 and thereby prevent the metabolism of pro-carcinogens. In this study, human P450 2E1 was expressed and purified. The purified enzyme was inactivated by benzyl- and phenethyl isothiocyanate in a reconstituted system with cytochrome P450, NADPH, reductase, and cytochrome b5. This study demonstrated that components from cruciferous vegetables were able to inactivate human cytochrome P450 2E1. The data suggests that administration of certain isothiocyanates, whether consumed in the diet or given as a supplement, could potentially prevent the development and possibly the progression of lung cancer in individuals.

THE EFFECTS OF EXERCISE: CHANGES IN CARBON DIOXIDE OUTPUT
Kathryn Elise Armstrong, Elise Thornton, 
St. Joseph Catholic High School, Pine Bluff, AR

People exercise all the time, but did you know it can benefit breathing? The levels of your oxygen and carbon dioxide change in exercise. So what happens to your carbon dioxide output? This project examines what happens to your carbon dioxide output when at rest and after exercise. The carbon dioxide output was found by using a homemade respirometer, and testing carbon dioxide output by exhaling into the respirometer at rest, after exercising moderately, and at rest again. Then we recorded the times it took for the respirometer to change to yellow, or our target color. Our hypothesis was that the exercise would cause the carbon dioxide output to grow. The results supported our hypothesis by showing that when we tested the carbon dioxide output after exercising moderately three times, then averaged the times, or seconds, it took for the respirometer to change, it showed that the carbon dioxide output after exercising took less to change color. Since the respirometer took less time to change color after exercising moderately, this means that there more carbon dioxide in the breath.

EFFECT OF AN E. COLI TOPA66 MUTATION ON SOS AND ANTIBIOTIC RESPONSE
Jenny Han Yang, Jessica Li, 
Briarcliff Manor High School, Briarcliff Manor, NY

The adaptive force of bacterial mutagenesis is what allows microbes to dodge even the most advanced methods of bactericide. The current antimicrobial warfare strategy is not promising, especially with increasing amounts of multi-drug resistant bacteria and escalating health care costs. The fervent use of antibiotics effectively spurs bacterial mutagenesis, resulting in bacterial resistance as well as drug impotence. Thus, the objective of this research was to explore the effects of stifling mutagenesis (SOS response) in E. coli. Microdilutions comparing growth of wild type and topA66 mutant to antibiotics found that a mutation in the topA66 gene leads to increased sensitivity. Since topoisomerases are vital components of SOS transcription, a luciferase assay was performed to confirm the decreased SOS response levels in the topA66 mutant. Colony counts determined a decreased mutation rate for the topA66 mutant verses wild type strain after norfloxacin treatment indicating that decreased SOS response levels may result in lower inclinations to develop multi-drug resistance. This study, dealing with a novel topA mutation, supports previous research and shows that topoisomerase I has the potential to be a target for antibiotics.

MIGRAINE TREATMENT WITH CYBER BEE PHEROMONE MASK
Esen Duhan, Emel Ezerce, 
KTSO Computer Technical High School, Edirne, Edirne, TURKEY

One of the our time’s most important health problems is headache or migraine types. And the most drugs are consumed for this. Use of these drugs are often realized without physician control, with word of mouth knowledge, by obtaining drugs from drug stores. In order to reveal and feel the existence of this pheromone special glass hives were made. Bees’ lives were monitored during the night and day. By breathing the smell spread in these hives by the bees, regular sessions were realized by making the bees approach to our body and experiments are made. Then, to make applications with specially designed cyber bee pheromone mask, twenty four subjects with migraine were found, and it was tried on them for six months. In twenty three subjects, the result is perfect, and no complete solution is obtained in one subject. This project covers a six-month period with subjects suffering from migraine, and in total one year. Our main purpose is to research how and in which dimensions communication between the bees in the hive are realized, and project was initiated, and upon the discovery of another world of bees, project purpose shifted to a different area. But in unawareness, many other projects were created from the project. World of the bees is full of mysteries. By chance we discovered that the bees not only produce honey and pollen, but also they spread a great pheromone with effects on human. Structure of these pheromones secreted by the glands in the mother bee’s chin consists of 32 components, and it was then learnt that only 15 of them have been determined. For this bee pheromone with direct effect on human health, a specially designed bee cage was placed in specially designed mask. This mask was used to make the subject perceive bee pheromone the best manner possible. In cybernetic bee pheromone mask, a bee cage with three different components was applied. It is applied on the subjects in three cages, with intervals of two minutes in five-minute periods. Treatment period is totally 15 minutes. Treatment shows its maximum effect in 30 minutes, and kills the pain.

GENIPIN - A NOVEL DYE FOR PROTEIN FIBER
Yangtian Wen, Li Chen, Shengshuang Zhu
Chengdu No.7 High School, Chengdu, Sichuan, CHINA

Most of the commercially available hair dyes contain phenylenediamines or dihydroxyhenzenes, both of which may cause cancers or other abnormal and mutational diseases. In this study, genipin isolated from the fruit of Gardenia jasminoides Ellis was reacted with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and protein fibers (white hair and silk) to find the optimal dyeing conditions. SDS-PAGE was used to analyze the dyeing mechanism during this research. The reaction products were added to alkaline solutions for fourteen days to test their stability. The results showed that genipin could react with protein fibers under a mild condition ( 35 degree centigrade, pH 7.5-8.0 ), for a short time (about 30 min) and with low dosages (10% (w/w) of fiber). The UV-spectrometer scan showed that the compounds of genipin and BSA had a maximun absorption peak at 586 nm. The blue-black color reaction products were stable. The results from SDS-PAGE showed that ginipin had cross-link with protein fibers . Therefore, it was distinct from most traditional dyes (natural or synthesized). Genipin, a novel kind of potential natural reactive dyestuff, can be applied to leathers, furs, silks, and wools and is also a promising safe and environmentally friendly hair-dye.

FRANKENFOODS

“Frankenfoods” investigates the presence of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in our food supply. This presence is determined through laboratory tests. The test employed in this experiment uses a polymerase chain reaction to amplify sequences of DNA that are present only in GMOs. These identifying sequences are the most common promoters and terminators used in genetic engineering (the CaMV 35S promoter and the NOS terminator) to allow genetic sequences to be expressed in many different organisms. One or both of these sequences of DNA are present in approximately 85% of approved GMOs. The amplified products are analyzed using gel electrophoresis. The resulting bands determine whether the product contains GMOs. Eleven cereals, seven types of corn chips, four products containing meat substitutes, two corn-containing baking mixes, and fresh corn were tested. A positive test for GMO DNA required a positive test using three types of primers. A plant primer identified a sequence of DNA involved in photosynthesis was used to ensure that DNA had been successfully extracted from the samples. The other primers were used to detect the presence of the GMO specific sequences of DNA. Based on the ingredients in each sample that tested positive, it can be concluded that the corn in the corn chips, corn chex, cornmeal mix, and white corn tortilla chips and the soy in the health cereal, meatballs, sausage, and beef patties were genetically modified (GM) crops.

POLYMORPHISMS IN DNA: A COMPARISON OF CANINE DNA STUDY YEAR 2
Kelsey Anne Shields, Carly Miles
Riverton High School, Riverton, UT, United States of America

Because of the differences in the variety of breeds of dogs that carry canine hip dysplasia (CHD)we decided to further investigate by testing the DNA in these different breeds for canine hip dysplasia adn prove gender by DNA. In our experiment we ran PCR products from ten different breeds and ran them through horizontal gel electrophoresis adn analyzed the results. The data reveals that it is possible to differentiate between gender and possible CHD amongst dogs by using PCR products. For further investigation it would be beneficial to test more specific primers and expand subject range.

A NOVEL APPROACH TO ATTENUATE ASTHMA DRUG ALBUTEROL’S SIDE EFFECTS: A STUDY USING ZEBRAFISH MODEL
Ayush Kumar, Raashed Raziuddin
Advanced Math and Science Academy Charter School, Marlboro, MA

Albuterol, a common bronchodilator, is often administered to the 14.8 million people diagnosed with asthma. Although albuterol assists in asthma therapy, its side effects in cardiovascular and nervous system has been reported. The goal of this project was to determine the cytotoxic effects of albuterol in an in-vivo model of zebrafish, and to find a dietary additive such as vitamin E to counter them. Zebrafish embryos 24 or 48 hpf were exposed to different concentration of albuterol and were inspected for changes in morphology and heart rate. Further, the cytotoxic effects of albuterol were analyzed by measuring the superoxide anion, nitric oxide (NO), glutathione (GSH), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the homogenate of treated-zebrafish embryos. Interestingly, it was found that albuterol treatment caused morphological changes/cytotoxic effect in a biphasic manner. <br><br>Of significance, pericardial edema, yolk sac edema, and mortality of embryos were detected prominently at 1.0 mM concentration of albuterol. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) production after albuterol treatment caused the elevation of the cytotoxic markers such as superoxide anion and nitric oxide analyzed by 2,7 dichlorofluoroscein (DCF) and Griess assay respectively.<br><br>Clearly, the albuterol treatment showed enhanced activity of LDH activity, a marker of cytotoxicity, whereas in presence of alpha-tocopherol, the LDH activity decreased. A decreased level of GSH, an antioxidant in cells, in treated embryos indicated cellular damage due to the effect of ROS. However, albuterol treatment in presence of alpha-tocopherol showed protective effects by increased level of GSH.

THE EFFECT OF PHYTOCHEMICALS ON THE EXPRESSION OF CANCER METABOLIZING ENZYMES
Tabassum Ahamad Khan, Payal Kenia
Chamblee Charter High School, Chamblee, GA, United States of America

The purpose of this project is to determine the effect of certain phytochemicals found in common fruits and vegetables on the expression of cancer metabolizing enzymes in colon cancer cells. The phytochemicals that will be tested are allyl disulfide, benzyl isothiocyanate, butyrate, curcumin, dimethyl fumarate, and lycopene. The cells will be treated with different dosage levels, ranging from 1 to 100 micromolar or 5 millimolar for the butyrate. Following incubation, the cells will be harvested and their total RNA will be isolated. The mRNA will be translated into cDNA and then amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers that are specific for quinone reductase (NQ01) and cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1). The relative amounts of mRNA for these enzymes will be determined using the processes of gel electrophoresis and RealTime PCR to compare their expression levels. It is hypothesized that expression of the detoxification enzyme (NQ01) will increase or the activating enzyme (CYP1A1) will decrease, which would inhibit carcinogenesis. <br><br>Research shows that lycopene and curcumin are the most beneficial phytochemicals, increasing NQ01 while decreasing CYP1A1, whereas dimethyl fumarate, allyl disulfide, and benzyl isothiocyanate increased both. Butyrate caused dramatic increases in CYP1A1 while not raising the NQ01 expression by significant amounts. Results also show that phytochemicals that caused a decrease in redox potential of glutathione also caused an increase in NQ01, which leads to the conclusion that these two processes are related. Further research must be done, especially concerning benzyl isothiocyanate and butyrate.<br><br>

SCREENING OF HIGH TITER SYN-A AND SYN-B IN ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION
Aaron Chris Bullock, Ryan Young, 
Rockdale County High School, Conyers, GA

This report presents the possibility of determining a blood titer cut off ratio for organ transplantation. Every year thousands of organ transplants are performed; in kidney transplants alone the risks of serious complications are one in fifty. To counter this potential for rejection this project attempted to discover a way to rule out donors from a specific recipient based on the titer in their blood. The purpose of this study was to create a standardized hemagglutination-based assay on an automated instrument platform using reference A and B erythrocytes produced in the lab. The erythrocytes were then subjected to different variables and reaction scores were assigned using a Galileo blood testing machine. From the data obtained a cut off ratio of titer was calculated. <br><br>The ratio of 1:64 was determined to be the optimal concentration between all temperatures. So 1:128 was chose as the cut off ratio because it had the least amount of detectable antigens on the cell. Potentially this would be a cutoff for reactivity because if a higher reaction with the donor at this concentration (i.e., 2+) were to occur; then they would need to be removed from the donor list. These results show that there is a possibility of ruling out donors from a donor list using their blood’s natural titer. However, this was not supported because the blood of potential donors was not tested. Possible future research could be to investigate a point inbetween 1:64 and 1:128.

This report presents the creation of type A and B erythrocyets using synthetic antigens. The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of attaching antigens to erythrocyte membranes in different conditions. The research hypothesis used was there will be a statistically significant difference in the effectiveness of erythrocyte type change due to different concetrations of synthetic erythrocyte, incubation time, and incubation temperature. This project was completed by a series of two different experiments: Different amounts of Albumin and time on transformation of blood types and concetration of KODE solution and time on transformation of blood types.<br><br>These experiments were set up by first washing the erythrocytes to seperate them from the plasma. Then the differing amounts of SYN-A and SYN-B were added, depending on the experiment. The cells were then incubated for a set period of time and then tested for hemagglutination. Data from this experiment points that the ideal conditions for creating erythrocytes are at stable body conditions, over a period of four hours. Results were analyzed statistically using the Kruskal Walllis analysis of variance. The null hypothesis "There will not be a sttistically significant differentce in the effectiveness of erythrocyte type change between the incubation times of 0 hours, .5 hours, 1 hour, 2 hours, and 4 hours" was accepted, at the .01 level of signifiacnce. However the two other variables, protien amount and concentration were not significant, according to the Kruskal Wallis analysis; however their mean ranks showed major differences.

Little Rock Central High School, Little Rock, AR

This project was designed to investigate the effects of monosodium glutamate (MSG) and nicotine on the embryonic chick retina. Because MSG and nicotine are known to activate the receptors for two common excitatory neurotransmitters in the brain, the hypothesis of this experiment was that MSG and nicotine would excite the neurons in the retina. However, since different neurotransmitters have different effects, it was also hypothesized that MSG and nicotine would have different effects on retinal neurons. In this project, the effects of MSG and nicotine were studied by monitoring the intracellular Ca2+ concentration the retinal ganglion cell layer. Retinas were dissected from chick embryos and loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+-sensitive dye, Fura 2-AM. They were then placed in a recording chamber under a fluorescence microscope for Ca2+ imaging. Effects of MSG and nicotine, which were applied to the perfusion solution, were studied. The changes in fluorescence intensity, which were proportional to the changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, were compared between MSG and nicotine. The relative number of cells affected by the two drugs were also analyzed and compared. The results showed that MSG is a potent activator of intracellular Ca2+ in nearly all ganglion cells tested, producing a sustained increase in Fura 2-AM fluorescence intensity. Nicotine also had an excitatory effect, although the effect was more transient. Moreover, nicotine’s effect was observed in a limited number of cells, suggesting it has a selective effect on a small subtype of ganglion cells.

The widely accepted prion hypothesis states: prion diseases (i.e. mad cow) are caused by infectious protein particles. The structure of this infectious (BETA-Sheet) form of protein is unknown. The objective of this research is to gather structural data about this protein with site directed tryptophan (Trp) fluorescence.<br><br> To begin, existing Trp codons were removed from the parental prion protein (PrP) gene with site directed mutagenesis. This allowed a specific location to be tagged with Trp and the local environment of the Trp to be examined.<br><br> The next step was analog incorporation using Trp auxotrophic cells. Analogs would give stronger fluorescence signals and more accurate data about PrP. Analog incorporation was unsuccessful; however, preliminary fluorescence was performed using natural Trp.<br><br> A portion of an existing sample of PrP with a Trp at position 99, expressed from E. coli cells in the non infectious (ALPHA-helical) form, was converted to the BETA-sheet form by unfolding and refolding in urea buffers of decreasing concentration.<br><br> In studying the local environment of Trp, spectral data from the ALPHA-helical and BETA-sheet forms were compared. The first comparison was between CD spectra of both protein forms to ensure the conversion process worked. Fluorescence spectroscopy was then performed on both samples. The data indicated a change in the local environment of Trp at position 99 to a more hydrophilic environment; however, the nature of these structural changes has yet to be elucidated. Incorporation of analogs into PrP and the fluorescent tagging of different locations will provide more conclusive data.<br><br>

All living creatures contain DNA, but the question is whether or not we can verify differences in DNA mapping of tetracycline resistant and non-resistant E-coli. We grew E-coli and extracted DNA from each culture, and by using electrophoresis, we hoped to find differences in their DNA bands, therefore showing the difference between the cultures.<br><br> We established growth of E-coli bacteria on 10 Petri dishes. After establishing growth, we took colonies from each Petri dish and transferred them to a luria broth, allowing them to establish growth in the broth. After growth was established, a liquid detergent was then added to each and placed in a hot water bath for 20 minutes at 60 degrees Celsius. Meat tenderizer was then added and again placed in the same hot water bath for 10 minutes. Ethyl Alcohol was then added to the mixture so that the DNA could float into the alcohol layer. The DNA was collected using micropipettes, and then was placed into the electrophoresis chamber and covered with running buffer. Power was then supplied, and allowed to run for approximately 45 minutes. After removing the gel from the chamber it was first stained for 15 minutes and then de-stained until the bands were visible. Meanwhile, antibiotic disks of tetracycline were placed on our Petri dishes of bacteria to determine if any were non-resistant. There were no non-resistant strains found. <br><br> Being negative, the DNA moved toward the positive electrode, migrating a distance of 18.5 millimeters to 19.3 millimeters.<br><br>

Escola Estadual Manoel Antonio de Souza, Mateus Leme, MG, BRASIL

The Amazonian specie Arrabidaea chica (known as Pariri) is a tropical forest native plant and is characterized by being a creeper with pink or purple flowers arranged on pyramidal panicles. It is used in popular medicine as an anti-inflammatory, cicatrizing and antianaemic drug and it also assists in cancer treatment. This study aimed to understand the chemical and pharmacological properties of A. chica leaf extract (ethanol, ethyl acetate, hexane and chloroform) and to check the extract antimicrobial potential on bacterial cultures. We also created herbal products like soap, lip balm, body lotion and scarring cicatrizing ointment. We conducted chemical prospecting techniques to determine the secondary plant metabolites presence, and as a result we found triterpenes, steroids, saponins, phenols, tannins and flavonoids. We performed antimicrobial tests using Salmonella, Shigella, Escherichia and Lactobacillus strains to determine the A. chica extract dose that causes growth inhibition and the results showed that the minimum inhibitory concentrations are 15.62, 15.62, 62.5 and 31.25 mg.ml-1, respectively. These results demonstrate the A. chica antimicrobial potential, confirm the active anti-inflammatory components presence and show the herbal products viability.

HYDROXYUREA AND N-ACETYLCYSTEINE: THE EFFECT ON THE SICKLE ERYTHROCYTE PROTEOME
Stephanie Anne Stoughton, Michael Yenting Wu
Shepton High School, Plano, Texas, United States 

Recent research has sequenced the normal human and sickle erythrocyte proteome in an attempt to better understand the molecular workings of sickle cell anemia. This project aims to determine the impact of the drugs hydroxyurea (HU) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on the sickle cell proteome, which has not yet been studied. Knowing the molecular mechanics of these drugs will allow for a deeper understanding of their workings, as well as lead to improved treatment. <br><br> Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used to separate the membrane proteins. The first dimension sorted proteins by their isoelectric points, while the second dimension further sorted them by size. Changes in the quantity of each protein were determined, and those proteins with significant changes were identified using tandem mass spectrometry. Proteins of interest were categorized into three functional groups: 1) membrane structure, 2) repair/prevention of oxidative damage, and 3) unrelated to treatment of disease. <br><br> Only one protein in the repair/prevention of oxidative damage group, Coproporphyrinogen Oxidase, changed in the NAC-treated samples. However, HU induced a total of nine protein changes in all groups. Oxidative-damage related proteins changed in both drugs, showing their importance in treating sickle cell disease. However in HU, unrelated protein changes were also found. These may be associated with the side effects observed in HU-treated patients. Since sickle cell patients show natural increases in most proteins, the drugs decrease the quantity of many proteins, causing the sickle proteome to become closer to that of a normal person. <br><br>

MIR17-92 CLUSTER IN AXONS PROMOTES AXONAL OUTGROWTH
Guangning An, Yu Tang
International Academy, Troy, MI

Axons extended from neurons in the central nervous system travel extensive distances to form synapses that built neuronal circuitry. Axonal regeneration in the adult CNS is limited after injury. Molecular mechanisms underlying axonal regeneration have not been fully investigated. Using embryonic cortical neurons cultured in a microfluidic chamber that segregates axons from neuronal cell bodies, we found that compared to neuronal somas, axons had relatively abundant levels of miRNA 17-92 cluster measured by real-time RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. Time-lapse microscopic analysis showed overexpression of miR17-92 cluster in the cortical neurons substantially increased axonal outgrowth compared to neurons transfected with an empty vector. In contrast, attenuation of endogenous miR-19a, but not miR-18a, both are members of miR17-92 cluster, by miRNA hairpin inhibitors significantly suppressed axonal outgrowth compared to scramble inhibitors. Western blot analysis revealed that overexpression of miR17-92 cluster considerably reduced PTEN, a predicted miR-19a target, and increased mTOR proteins, whereas blockage of endogenous miR-19a elevated PTEN and decreased mTOR. In addition, immunocytochemistry in combination with fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis showed that miR-19a levels in axons were inversely associated PTEN immunoreactivity. Furthermore, immunostaining showed presence of Dicer and Ago2 proteins in axons, both of them regulate miRNA biogenesis. Collectively, the present study suggests that miR-19a localized to axons regulates axonal outgrowth via modulating the PTEN/mTOR signaling pathway. Our findings provide a molecular mechanism underlying axonal outgrowth, which can potentially lead to a new therapeutic target for enhancement of axonal outgrowth.

SUNSCREEN: A CATCH 22- BLOCKING OF THE PHOTOCATALYTIC ACTIVITY OF TITANIUM DIOXIDE NANOPARTICLES BY POLYMER COATING
Samantha B. Larsen, Cole J. Blum, 
Long Beach High School, Lido Beach, NY

Titanium dioxide (TiO2) particles are major components of sunscreens essential for broad spectrum ultraviolet (UV) light protection. However, these particles are known photocatalysts: photons from UV light excite TiO2 particles to produce free radicals, which are highly reactive molecules that can oxidize biomolecules. The nanoparticles are also damaging to human skin and are possibly carcinogenic. One novel approach to this problem is to enclose the surface of photoactive nanoparticles with a polymer to prevent them from infiltrating skin cells and to block the free radicals from reaching other molecules. TiO2 microparticles and two sizes of nanoparticles were tested for their photocatalytic activity. The particles were coated with a polymer called polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate (pHEMA). Mixtures of uncoated TiO2 particles with guanosine triphosphate (GTP), and mixtures of polymer-coated TiO2 particles with GTP were exposed to 300-nm UV light for two hours. Samples were removed after time intervals to measure GTP concentration over the time period. A decrease in concentration indicated that GTP was destroyed by free radicals. To assess cytotoxicity, human dermal fibroblasts were incubated with the coated and uncoated nanoparticles.<br><br> The smallest nanoparticles (less than 25-nm in diameter) caused the greatest GTP oxidation due to their larger surface area for photocatalysis. The polymer coating successfully blocked the free radicals from destroying GTP for all photoactive particles. The polymer also reduced cytotoxicity to skin cells. Photocatalytic activity was greatest in an acidic environment. Polymer coating was concluded to be a practical method for reducing the detrimental effects of titanium dioxide nanoparticles.

The birdseed Phalaris canariensis L. is a plant of the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the Mediterranean, but it is grown commercially in some parts of the world its primary use is for domestic birds (Villaseñor & Espinosa, 1998). It has exceptional nutritional characteristics, because it contains a high concentration of nutrients, but currently its main use lies in the songbird feeding.<br><br>Studies at the Universidad Autónoma de México (UNAM) found that it contains an enzyme called lipase, which acts on adipose tissue preventing fat accumulation. It contains relatively higher levels of protein and oil compared to other cereals (Putnam et al., 1996, Holt, 1988). It has an excellent antioxidant activity and its main antioxidant compounds some sterols, triterpenes and caffeic acid esters (Takagi & Lida, 1980).<br><br>ALPIMIX. This project aims to harness the birdseed developing 3 food products, cookies, snacks and popsicles. The snack by the presence of fiber facilitates the digestive processes. The popsicles is made of bird seed extract, which contains an enzyme called lipase that is very effective to purify harmful fats in the veins, arteries, or just fat deposits. The obtained extract passes through a microfiltration process aimed at the retention of bacteria, thus avoiding the application to the end of the treatment would eliminate the enzyme. Finally the cookie also has the function to facilitating the digestive processes, due to the presence of birdseed fiber <br><br>Its process includes cleaning, washing, and conditioning, preparation of raw materials, frying and sealing.

Substance dependence is a chronic and repetitive disorder which may appear by using certain substances (alcohol or other addictive substances) in repetitive doses. Effects of cocaine appear and vanish in a short while.<br><br> The epileptic seizures were observed in 3–8% of cocaine users. In treatment studies, an important amount of investment have been made in order to create immunotherapy options by creating antibodies which can stop the cocaine during blood circulation before it reaches the central nervous system. However, elongated drug use causes increasing damages in the body. <br><br> Because of difficulties in the studies performed with blood, the existence of cocaine in water environment was examined. For the determination of cocaine, an addictive chemical, first a monomer solution was prepared in order to prepared molecular imprinting based polymeric poly (EDMAH) which would provide selective recognition. The prepared monomer solution was polymerized on the quartz crystal microbalance chips. Cocaine solution with 1 mg/ml concentration prepared with pH: 7.4 phosphate buffer was given to the QCM system. According to the obtained frequency shift and mass change data, the system successfully performed the determination of cocaine in the water environment with 1microgr/ml concentration. In this study, we prepared quartz crystal microbalance based sensor prepared in order to determine the cocaine, one of the addictive substances, from body liquids. So, we reduced the expense of the cocaine determination and we also made the time shorter.

THE CHEMISTRY OF HEARTBURN: A STUDY OF STOMACH ACID REDUCERS YEAR II
Danielle Paige Alley, Simona Tarnutzer, 
Isabel High School, Isabel, SD

The purpose of our project is to understand how various over the counter (OTC) and/or prescription acid reducers interact with each other. We hypothesized we would be able to observe significant interactions between medications being tested in our project. We obtained the prescription acid reducers from a licensed medical professional and purchased OTC medications. To test the medications, we used a solution of HCL, NaCl, and KCl to simulate stomach acid. We added the recommended dosage of each medication to the solution. When testing prescription medications, we added the prescription medication followed by the OTC medication. We allowed the medication to remain in the test containers and checked the pH 15 min, 30 min, and 1 hour later. As the experiment continued and the pH levels began to rebound we added the recommended dosage of either the prescription or OTC medication. We then observed the reaction. We continued adding the different medication another 3 times after it has met its tolerance level. We then checked the pH levels again after 15 min, 30 min, and 1 hour prior to adding the different medication. We were able to observe positive synergistic effects in when several of the OTC medication were combined with the prescription medications. However, in other cases your positive combined effect could be observed. The information gained from our project can help individuals and healthcare providers better understand the interactions of acid reducing medications, thus increasing the effectiveness of treatment plans.

The goal of this experiment was to determine which concentration of citric acid, if any, most effectively reduces the browning rate of Red Delicious apples. In research gathered prior to experimentation, the prevailing scientific opinion appeared to be that this browning is caused by oxidation of apple cells after being damaged by the slicing of the apple.<br><br>Nine similar apples and nine various citric acid solutions ranging from 0.00 M to 2.71 M (the maximum concentration), increasing by increments of 0.338 M, were used in this experiment. Each apple was cored, sliced, and then cut into six cylindrical pieces with roughly the same exposed surface area. These pieces were submerged into the citric acid solutions for 45.00 seconds. Digital photographs were taken of each piece under identical lighting conditions at 0 minutes (before being dipped), at 45 minutes, 60 minutes, and 75 minutes after being immersed in the citric acid solution.<br><br>The amplitude of red, green, and blue reflected light in a selected area of each digital photograph of the apple pieces, as well as the brightness difference between 0 and 75 minutes, were determined and compared using a software program.<br><br>It was concluded that different concentrations of citric acid make a difference in the browning rate of Red Delicious apples and, further, that the solution 1.02 M is the most desirable for preserving the apples' appearance because this concentration significantly reduced the discoloration, while higher concentrations provided no additional reduction in discoloration.

Lysozyme protein crystallization is beneficial because it is used to produced medicine to kill disease-causing bacteria. This protein is the first known enzyme that lyses cells. The purpose of this investigation is to find out in which concentration of NaCl, crystals will grow bigger. Larger crystals can be used to modify protein's molecular structure so that it can be used to produce new medicine. The hypothesis is that the solution with less concentration of NaCl is better for better crystal growth.<br><br>In order to carry out this investigation, a 4.6 pH buffer solution was made with sodium acetate, distilled white vinegar and distilled water. Solutions of Lysozyme and increasing concentration from 2.5% to 6.0% of NaCl were made with 10ml of the buffer solution and placed each one on tubes to complete eight tubes on an array rack. The tube were kept at room temperature and observed for a month. Five of the eight tubes had the biggest crystals(about imm long); two of them had crystals about 0.5mm long and one tube showed no crystal growth. The biggest crystals were obtained at 2.5% concentration of NaCl: ten crystals 1.5mm long; but at 6.0% the crystals were less than 0.5mm long. In conclusion, the hypothesis was correct, the crystals in solutions with less concentration of NaCl grew larger than the ones with higher contrations. A future investigation will find out how different pH levels and temperatures affect protein crystal growth.

TESTING KIT TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN ARTIFICIALLY AND NATURALLY RIPENED FRUITS
Ishani Goomer, Khanak Bhargava
Amity International School,Mayur Vihar, New Delhi, INDIA

Our project is based on developing a simple testing tool to differentiate between natural and artificially ripened fruits. Calcium carbide is a chemical compound used in artificial ripening of seasonal fruits. This is harmful for both those who consume it as well as who handle it. It is used as a source of acetylene gas, which is a ripening agent. Traders and fruit vendors want to make quick money by bringing in artificially ripened fruits before the naturally ripened fruits enter the market. Calcium carbide is unfavorable to the human body because after ingestion, acetylene produces free radicals which initiate detrimental effects on various organs. They play a major role in the aging process as well as in the onset of cancer, heart disease, stroke etc. Calcium Carbide reacts with water to give out calcium hydroxide and acetylene gas and leave traces of heavy metals like arsenic and non-metals like phosphorus. <br><br>Bananas in India that are treated with calcium carbide have been compared with naturally ripened bananas by applying tools from biodynamic farming principles (Biodynamic Chromatography),supported with chemical tests such as pH, Bradford Test for Protein, Fehling's test for sugars. This has enabled us to develop a kit which would be of immense use to a consumer.<br><br>We have therefore, developed a consumer friendly low cost testing tool to differentiate between artificially and naturally ripened fruits to enable people to identify and buy naturally ripened fruitsfor their consumption.

The use of irradiation for sterilization has been criticized for its potential introduction into food of carcinogenic radiolytic byproducts. The purpose of this experiment was to determine the mutagenicity of any byproducts produced during the irradiation of poultry fat and packaging material. It was predicted that while the organic nature of the fat tissue would allow it to resist modification by radiation, the synthetic packaging material would show evidence of mutagenicity. <br><br> The Ames fluctuation test was used to test for mutagenicity. Samples of organic and irradiated test material were obtained from the same supplier. Each sample was dissolved and added to a suspension of histidine-auxotrophic S. typhimurium. If the substance added was mutagenic, it would cause a bacterial reversion to histidine prototrophy, which would cause a bromocresol purple indicator to turn yellow. Each sample was divided into 96-well microplates and incubated for five days. Sterility, negative, and positive controls were used. Plates were scored according to the proportion of yellow wells in comparison to the proportion of spontaneous revertants. <br><br> Both irradiated fat and the irradiated packaging material showed an increase in revertants significant at the 1% level. Organic fat and unprocessed packaging showed no evidence of increased mutagenicity over the negative control. Most importantly, the results of a two-proportion z-test showed strong evidence at the 1% level that irradiation was associated with increased mutagenicity in both poultry fat and packaging.<br><br> While the results suggest that irradiation introduced mutagenic and possibly carcinogenic materials into the test materials, these results are best interpreted as a strong indication that further testing of irradiated materials is needed to ensure public health.<br><br>

ENZYMATIC ADDITION OF PALMITIC ACID TO THE NEURONAL PROTEIN SNAP-25
Christina S, Izatt, Elizabeth C. Flores
Timpview High School, Provo UT, United States

This year we studied palmitoylation of the neuronal protein SNAP-25 which is involved in neurotransmitter (NT) release. This protein is found in three forms in the body; reduced, oxidized and palimtoylated. Palmitoylation is when fatty-acids are attached to cysteine on SNAP-25. In order to palmitoylate the protein in vitro (inside a test tube), Palmitoyl-CoA (Pal-CoA), a source of palmitic acid, was added. These fatty-acids are later used to target and anchor SNAP-25 to the cell membrane during neurotransmitter release. In order to attach the palmitic acid to SNAP-25, the enzyme HIP-14 (Huntinin-Interacting protein) is used. In the palmitoylating procedure we incubated SNAP-25 at 4°C, body temperature (37°C) and room temperature (21°C). In order to know if the protein had been palmitoylated we added an oxidizing agent, K3FeCN6. We then ran the solutions in an electrophoresis gel which shows if SNAP-25 was palmitoylated or not. SNAP-25 has never been palmitoylated in vitro. To validate our results, we used PICA, a chemical that binds to palmitoylated SNAP-25, is added to the samples which makes SNAP-25 “glow” when placed in a dark room. With a computer we measured the density of the light and drew the conclusions that SNAP-25 is able to be palmitoylated at 4°C, and in 37°C, but not at 21°C. This result was expected because both HIP-14 and SNAP-25 are naturally found in the body. Our conclusions are helpful to the community because with our results more research can be done on mind disorders such as ADHD and schizophrenia.

A good warning system for heart diseases is the presence of high blood cholesterol in the system. Nearly 100 million Americans have cholesterol above normal level, and nearly 34.5 Americans have high cholesterol. Reading over this, we wanted to test to see if apple cider vinegar lowers high cholesterol. We hypothesized that apple cider vinegar will lower cholesterol, because there are many trace elements and minerals found in apple cider vinegar, it also contains pectin and pectin can be used to help lower cholesterol. We had to use a lab with a spectrophotometer. We also needed different types of cholesterol serums; low, standard, and a high. First we measured each cholesterol serum, and wrote down our results. Then, with the high cholesterol, we added one drop of apple cider vinegar and measured it. Then we added three, then seven, and finally we added ten drops of apple cider vinegar. We figured out that the apple cider vinegar did lower the high cholesterol level. We concluded that the more apple cider vinegar added to the high cholesterol the lower the high cholesterol would be. Implication for further study is to test apple cider vinegar on different age groups. Study has been shown that rats when fed acetic acid, their cholesterol levels became lower; a future implication is to study and test the effect of apple cider vinegar on rats. This project has real life applications as every person must be concerned about their cholesterol levels.

A. VULGARE: A THREE YEAR STUDY FINDING A SOLVENT FOR THE EXTRACTION OF THE AGGREGATION PHEROMONE
Clara Grace Watson, Cailyn Estey
Grenada High School, Grenada, Mississippi, United States

The purpose of this project is to isolate the pheromone that causes Armadillidium vulgare to aggregate. The aggregation pheromone is found in the fecal matter of A. vulgare. Previous studies have indicated that there could be variances between pheromones in male and female A. vulgare. It is hypothesized that at least two separate pheromones will be detected. Male and female A. vulgare were sexed and separated. After collecting fecal matter from the males and females, the fecal matter was crushed. Several organic solvents were used to dissolve the crystalline shaped fecal matter. Hexane, ether, and acetone were used as solvents to dissolve the fecal material. Each sex was tested separately. Gas chromatography was used to determine if there were traces of a volatile component in the solvent. In addition, a reflux technique was also employed to further purify samples, and an additional 99% pure acetone solvent was also used. Data charts and graphical printouts from the gas chromatography instrument indicate that there are volatile compounds in the female fecal matter.

COMPUTATIONAL METHODS FOR EXONIC PREDICTION WITHIN INTRONIC DATA AND MODELED INTRONIC DIVERGENCE THROUGH GENETIC ANALYSIS BETWEEN THE HUMAN AND MOUSE GENOMES
Eric Walter Jeske, Nelson Chan Ray
Mira Loma High School, Carmichael CA, USA

A comparative analysis between the intronic sequences of two different species facilitates the discovery of new genes and the distribution of supposedly random mutations. Novel, undiscovered exons may exist within intronic data which would be denoted through highly conserved regions. However, highly conserved regions indicate a non-random mutation pattern, which cannot be modeled through stochastic processes. <br><br>An examination of the aligned human-mouse sequences thought to be intronic may uncover undiscovered exons. More conserved regions within the comparison represent likely candidates for new exons. There does not exist a purely computational method of discovering new exons, so new exons must be experimentally verified. However, certain features of a DNA sequence indicate the possibility of an exon. Two hundred sequences were examined in depth as likely candidates. Areas with large degrees of conservation were analyzed for open reading frame length in conjunction with splice sites common to exons. An experimental verification of nine sequences returned three previously undiscovered alternative forms of genes. <br><br>Mathematical formulas that model the distribution of conserved areas in semi-conserved human and mouse intronic sequences have had little accuracy. Simulations were set up (to act as a control) and designed to stochastically “mutate” sequences, and align the original and mutant sequences. Poisson models were used to calculate expected amounts of conserved regions. Analyses were used to test the accuracy of these models, proving a slight error within the simulated data. When the model was applied with error correction figures, a statistically slight, yet significant, deviation was discovered. <br><br>

DEVELOPING A FLUORESCAMINE ASSAY TO PROBE CARDIAC PROTEIN STRUCTURE
Virginia Anne Dines, Siddharth Damania
Breck School, Minneapolis MN, USA

This study attempted to determine the structure of pentameric phospholamban (PLB), a 52-amino acid protein found in cardiac muscle cells that inhibits calcium flow. To analyze the structure of PLB, unbound electrons called spin-labels are attached to the primary amine of the lysine residue on PLB and then monitored using electron paramagnetic resonance. In this study, an assay was developed to quantify spin-labeled PLB. In this assay, fluorescamine was bound to lysine, and the fluorescent intensity was measured using fluorescence spectroscopy. Results showed a linear relationship between fluorescent intensity and primary amine concentration of PLB. Results also suggested that fluorescent intensity emitted by fluorescamine increased over time, and, due to this variable, the next step is to control time when measuring fluorescence. Once the variable of time is eliminated, the fluorescamine assay may be an effective procedure to determine efficiency of spin-labeling proteins for structural analysis of pentameric PLB.<br><br>

Soraya Sasungnoen, Chaowalit Chitwichan, Ratsami Khumchanthuek
Sukhui Sawatphadung Wittaya School, Sukhui, Nokhonratchasima, Thailand

The purpose of this project was to develop a method to detect the bleaching agent used in bean sprouts. Six local plants namely Java plum, Terrestrial orchid flower, shoeflower or China rose, seed of Malabor spinach, butterfly pea flower, and mangosteen peel were extracted for color using water at the ratio of 1:10 (w/v). The change in color intensity of the extract solution was measured under daylight lamp after adding 10 drops of 5% bleaching solution into 10 ml extract. The result showed that the extract solution from Java plum had the highest change in intensity of 181 Lux. The Java plum was then extracted by ethanol at various concentration (0-40%), temperature (10-45 degree Celcius), and time (5-25 minutes). It was found that the extract from 16% ethanol at 25 degree Celcius for 5 minutes showed the highest change in intensity. And for the purpose of convenience to apply the method, a 1x3 cm chromatography paper was soaked in the extract solution and then sun-dried. Various concentrations of bleaching agent (0.0005 – 5%) was dropped onto the paper. Time to change the color on the paper was recorded. The results showed that it could detect the 5-0.05% bleaching agent within 10 seconds, while the 0.005% and 0.0005% solution took 30 seconds and 4 minutes to change the color on the chromatography paper.

CAN ALLELOCHEMICALS BE EXTRACTED FROM BLACK WALNUT SEEDS THROUGH BOILING AND DISTILLATION?
Nabila Rahim, Kaetlynd Vance
Oakleaf High School, Orange Park, FL

For this experiment, we are testing to see whether or not it is possible to extract allelochemicals from allelopathic seeds through boiling and distillation. Allelochemicals can be found in allelopathic plants and are toxins that plants release into the soil, volatilize or leach through their leaves, and through decomposition. If this proves to be an effective method, it will open doors to learning to control and concentrate this toxin on specific areas and plants, like invasive species. If we boiled black walnut seeds in water, then the toxin will be released into the water and therefore allow us to distill it out because, the boiling of the seeds will contaminate the water and then the distillation of the water will remove everything but the toxin.<br><br> We divided up the trials having each trial with a different quantity of seeds. We boiled the seeds for about 30 minutes and allowed to cool before measuring the amount of contaminated water. We distilled that contaminated water until all pure water was removed. We measured the amount of toxin in ounces after the liquid cooled and repeated these steps for four trials each with three sets of seeds.<br><br> We did not expect to find that the seeds, after boiling, were just as hard as they were before boiling. We plan to continue this project, but instead take a step further and turn the toxin into a natural herbicide and test its efficiency on weeds.

EFFECT OF THE PLANT GRAPTOPHYLLUM PICTUM ON THE HAEMOSTASIA PROCESS OF LUMBRICUS TERRESTRIS
William Pagan -Palermo, Stephanie N. Rivera-Santiago, 
Blanca Malaret, Sabana Grande, PUERTO RICO

The problem under study was: What is the effect of different dilutions of the plant Graptophyllum pictum on the coagulation time and the regeneration capacity of the Lumbricus terrestris (earthworm). The hypothesis formulated was that there are significant differences between the coagulation time and regeneration capacity of Lumbricus terrestris (earthworm) when the dilutions of this plant are applied to it. To test the hypothesis, the plant was mashed and filtered and different distilled water dilutions were prepared. Thirty six earthworms were collected and separated into different dissection trays. Earthworms in dissection tray “A” received no treatment. Earthworms in dissection tray “B” were treated with a dilution of 5 grams of the plant and 10 mL of distilled water. Earthworms in dissection tray “C” were treated with a dilution of 10 grams of the plant and 20 mL of distilled water and the ones on dissection tray “D” were treated with a dilution of 15 grams of the plant and 30 mL of distilled water. A vertical incision was performed to the earthworms and the coagulation time was measured when blood color changed. Regeneration capacity of each earthworm was observed after 24 hours of study. Data analysis evidenced that the coagulation time was reduced and the regeneration capacity was more effective for high concentration dilutions of the plant. It demonstrated that the plant acts as a natural coagulant and helps the regeneration process of tissues. The projection of this investigation is to perform coagulation tests using human blood samples.

EFFECTIVENESS OF PLECTRANTHUS AMBOINICUS (INDIAN BORAGE), SALVIA OFFICINALIS (SAGE) AND OCIMUM BASILICUM (BASIL) PLANT’S LEAVES EXTRACTS TO ELIMINATE THE SOLENOPSIS INVICTA (RED FIRE ANT).
Jackeline Torres-Questell, Jamarys Torres Diaz, 
Elvira M. Colon Negron, Santa Isabel, PUERTO RICO

The purpose of this research is to eradicate the Solenopsis invicta (Red Fire Ant) using the leaves extract of Plectranthus amboinicus (Indian Borage), Salvia officinalis (Sage) and Ocimum basilicum (Basil) as a natural insecticide. The hypothesis was that leaves extracts of Plectranthus amboinicus (Indian Borage), Salvia officinalis (Sage) and Ocimum basilicum (Basil) are effective to eliminate Solenopsis invicta (red fire ant). <br><br>The extracts were tested before using them on the ants. The results of the pH test of the extracts were: Plectranthus amboinicus 5.09, Salvia officinalis 6.12, Ocimum basilicum 6.55 and the mixture of the three extracts was 6.07. The saponins test was positive in all plants’ leaves extracts including the mixture of the extracts. The flavonoids test was positive for Salvia officinalis and Ocimum basilicum; negative for Plectranthus amboinicus and positive for the extracts mixture. The paper chromatography test for Plectranthus amboinicus was green (Chlorophyll a and b), for Salvia officinalis and Ocimum basilicum was orange and the mixture was green (Chlorophyll a and b) and orange (Carotene). The bioassay test indicated that the plant’s leaves extracts in different concentrations caused 100% mortality of Artemia salina (brine shrimp). All these plants have allelopathic properties. Each of the different extracts was sprayed to groups of ten ants each. <br><br>The natural extracts of Plectranthus amboinicus, Salvia officinalis and Ocimum basilicum are successful eradicating the ants. The Salvia officinalis extract was effective but the extracts mixture was the most effective eradicating the Solenopsis invicta (ants). The hypothesis was accepted.

ARE WE IDENTICAL?
Megan A. Faulkner, Jessica R. Faulkner
A.J. Dimond High School, Anchorage, AK, USA

Our conjecture that we are identical twins was written into this hypothesis: We are more likely identical rather than fraternal twins. To test this hypothesis we used VNTR analysis. This (Variable Number of Tandem Repeats) analysis looks for length differences in amplified sections of DNA from specific loci that are linearly repeated in the genome of individuals. These length differences are highly variable in the general population, but for identical twins (with exactly identical genomes) there should be no differences in the repeated sections of DNA. Using PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) amplification followed by agarose gel electrophoresis of the PCR products, no difference in the migration pattern of the tandem repeats measured on the gel was observed in the first experiment. This result led to the conclusion that there is a high probability that the tandem repeats analyzed in the experiment came from identical rather than fraternal twins. We will need to do more experiments, probably immunological, to clarify our results.

THE FLOWERS PAPAVER RHOEAS, ALLAMANDA CATHARTICA AND DYANTHUS CARYOPHYLLUS AS NATURAL LARVICIDES AGAINST FARVAE FROM THE AEDES AEGYPTI MOSQUITO
Juan Gabriel Medina - Izquierdo, Eduardo Breijo Baullosa, 
University Gardends High School, San Juan, PUERTO RICO

The objective of this investigation is to determine if the flowers Poppy “Papaver rhoeas”, Yellow bell “Allamanda cathartica”, and Carnation “Dianthus caryophyllus” can serve as natural larvicides against “Aedes aegypti” mosquito larvae, which transmit the Dengue virus. It is expected that the flowers will work as natural larvicides and that the Carnation will be the most effective one in the extermination of the “Aedes aegypti” mosquito larvae. This investigation proposes a possible natural larvicide which will not be harmful to the environment or hazardous to health. Twenty five (25) larvae were placed in each container together with two chopped flower petals, utilizing a total of six containers. Two additional containers with 25 larvae each were designated as the control group to observe the effectiveness of the flowers when compared to the experimental group. The experiment had a duration of 5 days and a daily account of the larvae that died was kept. The results demonstrated that the flowers were effective in the reduction of larvae since in the experimental group there was a mortality of 37 while the control group had a mortality of 2 larvae. The Carnation proved to be the most effective flower. Probably this can be attributed to the fact that this flower contains a chemical known as saponin which is believed to affect the “Aedes aegypti” mosquito larvae. Future projections include the development of a natural product based on the extract of this flower that would work as a natural larvicide against “Aedes aegypti” mosquito larvae.

Jorge Adolfo Piedra-Navarro, Jose Pablo Corrales Villalobos, 
Colegio Cientifico de Costa Rica, Sede San Carlos, Santa Clara de San Carlos, Alajuela, COSTA RICA

Vanilla is one of the most industrialized plants in the world. Vanillin is responsible for giving the peculiar taste and smell to products made from vanilla. The extraction of natural vanillin is an expensive process, so it is currently industrialized as synthetic vanillin, which is made from products such as lignin and guaiacol. <br><br>This study intends to extract vanillin from the callus that comes out of a radical meristem vanilla plant. Compared to other processes this biotechnology process makes the extraction quickly and cost-effectively.<br><br>The callus was produced and placed in a solid MS medium supplemented with 2,4-D in order to induce callus production. Then, it was placed in a MS liquid medium in constant agitation for 15 days. The cell suspension was sieved through three different mesh screens in order to assess which one allows a greater number of cells to pass. Subsequently, four treatments were applied (ethylene, carbon dioxide, heat and a blank) distributed in 3 replicates. The cell suspensions were centrifuged, and then isoamyl alcohol and hot water were added to separate vanillin from other cellular components. Chromatography was used to assess which of the 4 treatments, mentioned above, induced a higher production of vanillin. The best results were obtained with the use of ethylene.

A SCREEN FOR MUTANTS IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER WHICH AFFECTS TRIGLYCERIDE LEVELS
Ryan Wai Tam, Daniel Yeh
Alhambra High School, Alhambra, CA, United States

The success of Drosophila Melanogaster as a model organism has largely been due to its ability to carry out large-scale genetic screens in identifying the genes involved in a biological process. Although most genes are based on a loss-of-function phenotype, our gene is based on a gain-of-function phenotype, or overexpressed genes. In our project, we overexpress the progeny of our Ryan-Daniel (aptly named after ourselves) fly line cross using a UAS-GAL4 system and test them for high or low triglyceride levels which deviate from the calculated average value. We will isolate the progeny with notable deviation because if the lines of the overexpressed gene show an increase in triglyceride level, it means that the genes regulate the triglyceride levels. We want to isolate new genes that change the triglyceride levels of the fly, and we predict that we will find lines causing both an increase and decrease of triglyceride levels in the fly. For our methods, we used various grinded flies, triglyceride reagents and a microplate reader to determine our results. We found that line 5 of our cross had the highest deviation and thus had the most reproducible phenotype. Through this project, we want to understand fat regulation and find out what role high triglyceride levels play in causing disease in humans.

KADOK (PIPER SARMENTOSUM) AS AN ANTI-ULCEROGENIC AGENT
Syahrina Hafiza Ahmad Salim, Nur Farawahidah Mohd Yusof, Fadhlina Abdul Bashir
Tunku Kurshiah College, Seremban, Negeri Sembilan, MALAYSIA

Ulcer is an open eroded sore of skin or mucous membrane. Ulcer disease is the main cause of morbidity and health care costs to about 10,000 people per year in Malaysia. Ulcer disease results from an imbalance of aggressive factors and the ability of the gastroduodenal mucosal to protect itself. Consumption of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and Helicobactor pylori infection cause the majority of stomach ulcers from 90-95 percent that leads to ulcer disease. In our research, Piper sarmentosum or the famous ‘kadok’ plant is used to demonstrate its ability to prevent stomach ulcer. Hence, the prevention tests were done by using kadok extract. The kadok was extracted and structural elucidation of the compound was established through spectroscopic methods: UV, IR and preparative column chromatography. The active compounds from kadok are known as isoasarone and 2,4,6-trimethoxybenzaldehyde (L3). Different concentration of kadok active compounds and 3 synthetic compounds which are the isomer of isoasarone were tested by a qualified scientist. Low dose of 62.5 mg/kg kadok isoasarone indicated 99.12% inhibition of stomach ulcer and pH value of 5.55 while kadok L3 indicated 97.38%, pH 3.02. High dose of 250.0 mg/kg kadok isoasarone compound indicated 100% inhibition and pH value of 4.60 while kadok L3 showed 97.70%, pH 3.33. The reference drugs, Cimetidine which are prescribed by doctors showed only 88.74% inhibition. Isoasarone and L3 shows the best compound to prevent stomach ulcer. The effects of kadok L3 is 100% harmless to the consumers. Anti-ulcerogenic activity of Kadok L3 on healing stomach ulcer is conducted by a qualified scientist.The encouraging results prove impressive anti-ulcerogenic activity of kadok L3 both on preventing and healing. Thus, kadok L3 is an excellent natural remedy to prevent and heal stomach ulcers that cause ulcer disease. This also signifies the ability of kadok as an alternative to replace drugs in the medical field as an excellent anti-ulcerogenic agent in preventing and fasten the healing of stomach ulcer.

SCREENING, ISOLATION, AND CHARACTERIZATION OF FLUORESCENT PROTEINS FROM NUDIBRANCHS
Ivy Razel Bernardo Ventura, Mara Elaine Dator Villaverde, Janine Cindy Mendoza Santiago
Philippine Science High School-Main,Agham Road,Diliman,Quezon City,Philipppines

Fluorescent proteins are important molecules used in the biochemical and medical research fields. However, the Philippines doesn’t have a local source of fluorescent proteins, and thus imports from abroad. This work presents the isolation and characterization of fluorescent proteins from a potential local source—nudibranchs. Nudibranchs are known for their spectacular color patterns due to special pigment cells in their skin. The nudibranchs’ skin pigmentation was used as the fluorescent protein source. Protein extracts from the seven species collected from Batangas were run through Reversed-Phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC). The absorbance graphs of the extracts showed which had the most aromatic amino acids, the main component of fluorescent proteins. The extract with the most number of peaks at 280 nm was re-run through RP-HPLC for collection of fractions. The 28 fractions were examined through fluorescence microscopy using filters with three excitation ranges: 395-410 nm, 490-505 nm, and 560-580 nm. The proteins which fluoresce at these wavelengths were the only molecules visualized. The results showed that fluorescent proteins are present in the fractions, mostly in Fractions 1 and 8. Based on observation, proteins which emit at the wavelengths of red and green are generally most abundant. For the advanced continuation of the study, genes coding for the isolated proteins must be determined, isolated, and cloned. The discovery of nudibranchs as a local source of fluorescent proteins would eventually provide local researchers with accessible and relatively affordable fluorescent proteins for their projects.

THE EFFECT OF SOFT DRINKS UPON DIGESTION
Sara Eutrice Benjamin, Deion Gillis
Mergenthaler High School #410, Baltimore Maryland USA

It was hypothesized that soda would negatively impact digestion. It was also hypothesized that the ground beef would be most difficult to digest. Approximately 0.5 g samples of ground turkey, beef, pork, pineapple, apple, zucchini, and brussels sprouts were tested in 10 ml distilled water, soda, or fruit punch with 10 ml of simulated stomach juice. Digestion produces gases, so the samples were weighed at the beginning of the experiment and after 1, 2, and 5 days in the stomach juice at the two temperature levels. Control samples with no food were included.<br><br>The data showed that the food samples in fruit juice and water had higher mass change than those in the soda at both temperature levels. Also the ground beef samples took longer to digest and had the lowest mass change. This suggests that soda had a negative impact on the rate of digestion and that beef was the toughest meat to digest. Because of the exaggerated effects of soda upon the food samples it can be inferred that soda slows down digestion. We suspect that the high level of fructose, caffeine, and acid in the soda could be the reason for negative effect upon digestion. Overall, the refrigerated samples did not digest as well as the body temperature samples. This can be due to the fact that the process of digestion works best at body temperature, as we found in our research. It was concluded that the hypothesis was correct.<br><br>

MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF TEM AND SHV-TYPE EXTENDED-SPECTRUM BETA-LACTAMASES USING BIOINFORMATICS
William Truong, Wallace Truong
Campbell Collegiate Institute, Regina, SK, Canada

ESBLs are becoming a major therapeutic problem because they are capable of hydrolyzing beta-lactam ring antibiotics, which include most of the antibiotics commonly used today. Nucleotide sequencing remains the gold standard for determining specific BETA-lactamase genes present in strains, however it is labour-intensive and can be technically challenging. This project attempted to characterize the TEM and SHV-type enzymes expressed in several Escherichia coli isolates using automated DNA sequencing and bioinformatic tools. E. coli strains were collected from patients in 4 regional health authorities across Saskatchewan. The isolates were then confirmed for ESBL production. DNA was then extracted, PCR amplified and sequenced. Multiple sequence alignments were performed with known sequences from NCBI and <www.lahey.org/studies> using DNAssist 2.0 and DNAsis 3.7. The process was then implemented with computer software (TEMSHVanalysis) and database (TEMSHVdb) designed in the project. Of the 6 isolates successfully characterized for ESBLs, it was determined that antibiotic resistance was conferred by the SHV-2B and SHV-12 genes. It was found that TEMSHVanalysis and TEMSHVdb provided a rapid and accurate method for characterizing the TEM and SHV-type genes sequenced. The investigation demonstrated that by using automated sequencing techniques and automated software characterization methods, the characterization of ESBLs can be made less labour intensive, less time consuming and less technically challenging. Since ESBL genotyping is becoming more routine, it is expected that the protocol presented here, which is built on the gold standard method of characterizing ESBLs, will significantly facilitate clinical laboratories in the future.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF APPLYING A NOVEL SILICA NANOPARTICLE COMPOUND MEDICATION TO EFFECTIVELY ERADICATE MALARIA
Hassan Nezar Khdary, Khaled Alkozman
Manarat Al-Riyadh School, Riyadh, SAUDI ARABIA

Malaria kills 1 to 2 million people annually according to WHO reports. The problem is that the malaria parasite resists most medicines used to kill it because there are 12 hours in which the parasite mutates and resists the drug. The current project aims at producing a novel compound of medication using silica nanoparticles to effectively eradicate malaria in an expedient timeframe. The procedure starts with producing silica nanoparticles with 100 nanometer diameter. Next, the surface of the particles is functionalized with the Di-amine. Then, the silica nanoparticles are linked with 2 active malaria drugs. Then the 4 compounds undergo IR test to decide if the compounds have linked with the silica nanoparticles or not. Finally, the effectiveness of the new compound is tested by comparison with the medicines without silica nanoparticles. It takes 15 minutes to kill parasites with 50 mg of current medicine. On the other hand nanoparticles could be linked with 2 drugs will decrease the time to few second it takes one tenth the time that drugs without silica nanoparticles take. Laboratory experiments proved the effectiveness of silica nanoparticles in eradicating malaria. Using silica nanoparticles in treating malaria will contribute to eliminating malaria. This new method will open new prospects to eliminating other diseases caused by parasites.

Nowadays, the whey obtained of the elaboration of cheese is considered as a residue. It is a by product known as “sweet whey” which is spilled into the rivers or it is used to feed pigs. However, it is an important product or mixture of proteins that has a wide range of chemical, physical and functional properties. Also, it can help us to keep our health as well as to avoid certain diseases. For these reasons, we decided to obtain sweet whey powder to apply it to nutritive products for taking advantage about its properties. Hence, our product obtained is mainly for children who are more vulnerable to suffer of undernourishment problems.<br><br>For the development of the project it was carried out a bibliographic research. It was selected the dried method as well as it passed through a Spray drying process. Besides, the formulas of the products of sueramix malteada and sueramix atole were carried out and they were sensorial evaluated until it was obtained a standardized product. Moreover, physicochemical and microbiological determinations and a final sensorial evaluation were carried out to evaluate the final product. Finally, the data was analyzed and we conclude with our experimental process.<br><br>So, the use of sueramix prepared for milkshakes, atole and frozen milky desserts could help to obtain products with a better flavor, color, substance and texture for giving nutritive benefits.

SPONTANEOUS FIBRILLOGENESIS ON CHARGED POLYMER SURFACES
Michelle Simpser, Rikki Frenkel
Stella K. Abraham High School for Girls, Hewlett, NY, USA

In order to study their structure, proteins are routinely crystallized in solution. These crystals, though, have no resemblance to the actual structure of these proteins when they are secreted by cells and self-assemble into an extracellular matrix. We have found that spontaneous protein self-organization can be induced on polymer surfaces when the charge of the polymer is comparable to that of the cell membrane. Furthermore, using rat cardiac fibroblasts we demonstrated that the fibrillogenesis observed using purified Fibronectin (Fn) is indeed the physiological form that is produced by actual cells on these charged synthetic surfaces. We therefore proposed to use these charged polymer surfaces to study the effects of compounds known to be involved in the aging and disease process. We found that substances that bind to Fn, such as trivalent ions and heparin, inhibit lattice growth. When glucose is added, the fibrils that are formed take on a geometric shape. Furthermore, the fibrils formed are more rigid and we found that their elastic modulus increases in direct proportion to the excess glucose concentration in the media. These findings are in good agreement with the decreased elasticity found in the tissues of diabetics and the elderly.

This project was the result of the recent fuel price hike, worldwide. The main idea was to find a suitable renewable source to produce ethanol.Ethanol can be produced from any substances that are high in carbohydrates via biochemical approach, known as fermentation process.<br><br> Banana was chosen for this project because it is available abundantly through out the year, in tropical countries. The banana was mashed, diluted and fermented with yeast to break down the carbohydrates to monosaccharides and then converted into ethanol. Repeated distillation process was carried out to separate the ethanol from water in the resulting liquid.<br><br> <br><br> The ethanol was mixed with gasoline at 1:9 ratio to produce biofuel. Several tests were done to analyze the biofuel properties such as heat of combustion, energy content, and specific gravity. The results show that the combustion properties of the mixed biofuel are almost similar to the conventional gasoline.<br><br> <br><br> The contribution of this project is to reduce the fuel cost thus will greatly bring positive impact towards the nation’s economy. Secondly, the benefits of using biofuel are not just economical but also cleaner and reliable compared to limited fossil fuel.<br><br>

Brassica rapa (B. rapa), a variation of the mustard plant, has a short germination period and distinct phenotype, making it ideal for genetic studies in the classroom. The aims of the study were to evaluate the changes in height in response to variations in light intensities, and to determine alterations in circadian rhythm to different light cycles in the wild type B.rapa compared to the Elongated Internode (EIN) mutant seedlings (Line 40, Line 9 and Line 194). The results of the experiments showed that the Line 9 mutated B.rapa had similar height as the wild type B. rapa in low light conditions however, Line 194 and Line 40 mutant B.rapa were significantly taller than the wild type B.rapa in both low and higher light intensities. Time-lapse photography under 12-hour and 24-hour light cycles was used to show changes in the circadian rhythm and document movement of the cotyledons in wild type and mutant B. rapa seedlings. There were no alterations in the movement of all seedlings when exposed to the 12-hour cycle. When exposed to the 24-hour light cycle, the circadian rhythm was irregular in all groups for a 36-hour period, but returned to the regular cycle, albeit with a shorter range of cotyledon motion than before. These findings suggest that changes in genetic make-up can influence phenotypic response in B.rapa plants which will be useful in the teaching of genetics in the classroom.

Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) affect over 1 in 88 individuals and the microdeletions of two chromosomal regions, 15q24 and 16q21, have been correlated with autistic phenotypes in humans. A gene in region 15q24 codes for the Semaphorin7A (Sema7A) protein, an axon guidance molecule; while a gene in region 16q21 codes for the Cadherin-8 (Cdh8) protein, a cell adhesion molecule. We investigated the roles of both proteins in brain regions previously implicated in ASDs. Immunohistochemistry and Western Blots were performed on Wild type (WT) and Sema7A Knockout (KO) mice brain tissue and sections and blots were imaged and analyzed to create a developmental timecourse of expression and localization of Sema7A. In situ hybridization, Immunohistochemistry and Western Blots were carried out on WT brain tissue to profile localization and temporal variation of Cdh8. Results showed Sema7A expression peaking during a developmental time period in the thalamus and cortex to influence the early connectivity of these regions. Abnormalities in the anatomy and dendritic orientation of Sema7A KO mice indicated that Sema7A is crucial for proper somatosensory circuitry. Cdh8 was verified to be a synaptic protein in the striatum, localized to the pre- and post-synaptic membranes. Cdh8 mRNA expression peaked during a crucial developmental period in the striatum and prefrontal cortex, two brain regions implicated in the development of autistic behaviors. This study explored the roles of Sema7A and Cdh8 in the underlying mechanisms governing the etiology of ASDs and provided a deeper understanding of this wide range of disorders in the Autism Spectrum.

THE EFFECT OF GROWTH FACTORS ON THE PROLIFERATION OF BETA CELLS

Type 1 Diabetes is a growing problem in America and current treatments have been proven ineffective. Islet Transplantation is one such ineffective treatment and in order to increase the supply of beta cells for the surgery, we introduced growth factors. By increasing the amount of beta cells with growth factors for Islet Transplantation the procedure will be more cost efficacious. In order to test whether or not the growth factors--IGF-1 and IGF-2--increased the amount of proliferation we utilized two assays, the BrdU and Edu Detection Assays. The BrdU detection assay quantified the amount of cell growth by measuring the amount of luminescence created by incorporating an analog into the newly replicated DNA strand. As a result of both of the assays, it was found that IGF-2 by itself demonstrated the most amount of cell proliferation; however, the mixture of IGF-1 and IGF-2 dud exhibit a great amount of potential as it did better than IGF-1 by itself. Since the mixture was an even split of IGF-1 and IGF-2 than a future area of improvement would be to change the concentration of the mixture to allow IGF-2 to take a more forward role while still allowing IGF-1 to act upon the cells but in a lesser manner. Thus from the project it was found that growth factors exhibited a strong possibility for improving the efficiency of Islet Transplantation by increasing the supply of beta cell which are notoriously slow at replicating.
