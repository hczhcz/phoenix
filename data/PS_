VITAMINS AFFECT ON THE METABOLIC PROCESS OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS
Branden Lee Anglin
J.W. Mitchell High School, New Port Richey Florida, United States of America

In observing whether or not the addition of vitamins to chloroplasts undergoing photosynthesis would increase the efficiency of the chloroplasts, it is intended to determine whether or not a vitamin could be solely responsible for increasing the rate of photosynthesis. However, no vitamin was able to significantly increase the amount of DPIP reduced simply by chloroplasts undergoing photosynthesis.<br><br> To determine whether or not vitamins would affect chloroplasts undergoing photosynthesis, cuvettes were prepared which contained a phosphate buffer, DPIP, distilled water and a vitamin solution consisting of dissolved vitamins (Vitamins B12, C and B6). Fresh chloroplasts were then added to the cuvettes and kept under a constant light; they were measured every five minutes for 25 minutes using a spectrophotometer. At the 25 minute mark, the results were recorded.<br><br> In all the trials, the effect the vitamin had on the chloroplasts was minimal, and in some cases, the vitamins actually decreased the efficiency of the vitamins. In trial two, vitamin B12 was added and produced only a 70% transmittance compared to the 76% transmittance produced by the cuvette containing no vitamins. In trial one, however, the cuvette with vitamin B12 produced an 87% transmittance while the cuvette containing no vitamins produced only an 85% transmittance.<br><br> The experiment showed that vitamins had little to no significant effect on chloroplasts undergoing photosynthesis. Due to how varied the results were, it is unable to be said whether or not vitamins increase the efficiency of photosynthesis.

Ashley Elizabeth Foerst
Lake Brantley, Altamonte Springs, Fl, USA

The At1g79700 gene in Arabidopsis thaliana, amember of the AP2 subfamily, may have a significant affect in the development of Arabidopsis thaliana. The affect of the mutant protein At1g79700 will be studied on Columbia Arabidopsis thaliana plants; including its stomatal and phenotypical effects. The Null Hypothesis states that there is no statistically significant difference between Columbia Arabidopsis thaliana and the mutant At1g79700 in leaf development, root growth, and stomatal density. <br><br>The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was repeatedly completed using a combination of different primers, in order to identify the homozygous T-DNA mutants. Individually, 10 of each T-DNA mutant were planted along with 12 Columbia plants (control). Also, sterile agar plates were prepared in order to grow mutant and Columbia plants (used for root growth measurements). Also, cotyledons were removed from 10 At1g79700 plants, and 10 Columbia plants. They were observed under the microscope in order to calculate average stomatal density. Also, plant height and number of siliques were observed.<br><br>Results included a significant difference between root length in Columbia plants and root length in At1g79700 plants. At1g79700 plants showed shorter root lengths. Also, a significant difference was found in the length of leaf 3, the width of leaf 3, the length of leaf 1 and 2, and the width of leaf 1 and 2; At1g79700 plants showed less developed leaves. Also, At1g79700 plants exhibited a shorted height and a smaller number of siliques. Finally, there was not a significant difference in stomatal density in Columbia and At1g79700 plants.<br><br>

CHARACTERIZATION OF PHOTORECEPTOR GENES REGULATING APOTHECIAL MORPHOGENESIS OF SCLEROTINIA SCLEROTIORUM
Kelly Michelle Chacon
American Heritage School, Plantation, Florida, USA

Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is one of the most nonspecific and ubiquitous plant pathogens to plague the agricultural community. White mold (Sclerotinia stem rot) has caused crop losses exceeding over 20%, with some individual field losses totaling 65%. The primary survival mechanism of this filamentous fungus lies in the formation of the sclerotial and apothecial structures that sustain its UV-A light-dependent life cycle, or photomorphogenic growth and development. The aim of this study was to characterize and functionally analyze the photoreceptor genes regulating the growth and development (photomorphogenesis) of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. It was hypothesized that Cryptochrome (cry1) is the gene encoding for one such photoreceptor. <br><br>This study used an in vitro mutagenesis (reverse genetics) approach to characterize cry1, in which the cry1 gene was identified and replaced with an enzyme digest/ligation-engineered hygromycin phosphotransferase (hph) gene construct. Southern hybridization analysis confirmed the appropriate genomic integration of the gene construct into Sclerotinia protoplasts and identified cry1 knockout and ectopic strains. The mutant strains were phenotypically characterized (mycelial growth rates and sclerotial development patterns) against a wildtype strain (control) in complete dark, white light, UV-A, and full spectrum light treatments. The observations indicated significant phenotypic abnormalities in the delayed growth rates and development patterns of the mutant (knockout) strains in UV-A present light treatments, and no significant differences between mutant strains and ectopic/wildtype strains in UV-A absent light treatments, as indicated in a univariate ANOVA (p<.001). This data supports the hypothesis that cry1 is a primary photoreceptor gene regulating normal UV-A light-dependent growth and development (photomorphogenesis). <br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF STAGONOSPORA NODORUM ON AGS2000 WHEAT BACKCROSSES
Alison Leigh Youmans
Spalding High School, Griffin, Georgia USA

The purpose of the project was to identify backcrosses of AGS2000 wheat that were Resistant or Moderately Resistant to the Stagonospora nodorum fungus. Vernalized seedlings of 43 backcrosses were grown in a greenhouse, yielding approximately 500 plants, and the grown plants were divided into 2 sets to be 2 project replications. The Stagonospora cultures were grown and made into inoculum to spray onto the wheat plants via spray bottle. The plants were placed in cages covered with trash bags to retain moisture and darkness for 2 days, allowing the disease to successfully activate. The plants were then placed back under sunlight. Over a period of 4 observation dates, each individual plant within a backcross set was rated based on a percentage scale of disease progression. The backcrosses had all of their ratings averaged, showing which backcrosses fell into each category. Backcrosses that had a final average below 5 received the Resistant rating. Those below 10 were called Moderately Resistant, those below 20 were Susceptible, and those above 20 were called Highly Susceptible. The information on resistant crosses gained from the experiment could potentially aid the wheat industry by introducing varieties of wheat that can withstand harmful diseases like Stagonospora nodorum.

SUFFRIN' SOYBEANS: A STUDY OF NUTRIENT DEFICIENT SOIL ON GLYCINE MAX
Hannah Ruth Cox
Zane Trace High School, Chillicothe, Ohio, United States of America

Soil nutrients affect Glycine max plant root growth and bean reproduction differently. The purpose of this project was to determine how soil pH and nutrients deficiencies affect plant growth, leaf composition, root nodulation, and bean reproduction. The hypotheses were that acidic pH, potassium and phosphorus deficient soils will negatively affect plant growth, but boron, magnesium, or zinc specific deficiencies will not affect plant growth; the leaf cuttings chemical composition will show a reduced proportional nutrient amount; the no nutrient supplemented soil root nodules will not have rhizobium attached and the soybeans will reproduce at a lower yield. The most chemically deficient soil was utilized and all nutrients were increased to soybean optimum levels with the following experimental cases: nutrient deficient (control 1), phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, boron, zinc deficient, and soybean optimum (control 2). The soils were accurately tested for chemical composition. Organic soybeans were used and grown for 80 days. Plant growth was recorded and leaf cuttings were taken. The soybean leaf chemical composition was determined by the Nitric/Perchloric Wet Ashing Open Vessel Method using gas chromatography. Soybean root nodulation was observed under a microscope to determine size and quantity of nodules. The results show that plant growth was not negatively affected by acidic, phosphorus or potassium nutrient deficiencies soils. Plant growth was stunted when either boron or all nutrients were deficient. The leaf chemical composition analysis showed a reduced amount of copper, potassium, and phosphorus. Root nodulation was negatively affected, when either boron or all nutrients were deficient.

HYBRIDIZATION OF EDIBLE DIPLOID EUMUSA VARIETIES AND WILD RHODOCHLAMYS MUSA SPECIES
Gabriel Lewis Sachter-Smith
Nederland Middle Senior High School, Nederland, Colorado, USA

Almost all modern edible bananas (some 1,200 varieties) come from the same linage and are rather similar in growth habits. This study investigated the possibility of cross breeding edible diploid Eumusa banana varieties with wild Rhodochlamys Musa species in order to derive edible bananas from a new gene pool and produce new growing traits. Pollen from Musa ‘Rose’ was used to pollinate Musa laterita as the seed-bearing mother. After 144 days, 119 seeds total were harvested. 15 of 45 ripe seeds were examined and found to have 80% embryo presence. Seed formation was a success and it was found that this type of cross was possible to aid in the breeding of new banana varieties.

IS IT RIPE YET? PHASE 3
Allen Joesph Bordelon
St. James High - SMA, Vacherie LA, USA

Continuing my project of the last two years, I am attempting to determine a fruit’s ripeness without harming the fruit. From research conducted during the first year, I decided on using the concentration of flavonoids in the fruit’s skin as measured by UV absorption. During the second year, I began to develop a device that could take accurate readings using a scanner that I designed. Testing showed a slight difference in the fruits, with a higher UV absorption as the fruit ripened. <br><br>I began using a fiber-optic UV light source and spectrometer. I also sampled 3 flavanoids that appear in most fruits: Rutin, Quercetin, and Hesperidin. I ran these samples at different concentrations to determine what wavelengths were absorbed. UV absorption appeared at 100ppm individually and 40ppm when mixed in a solution at approximately 280 and 350 nm.<br><br>I selected several bananas and oranges and ran them through the spectrometer. Several people sampled the fruits and gave their subjective opinion of ripeness. I created graphs with the data collected from the spectrometer and compared them to the average ripeness values that the samplers gave. <br><br>Although more testing needs to be done, I obtained results for bananas with varying ripeness. From the results, a scale was developed to indicate the ripeness of any particular banana. With regard to the oranges, it has been seasonally difficult to obtain under-ripe specimens. However, using the results obtained by testing oranges that were slightly under-ripe, a prediction of the absorption rate of oranges with varying ripeness could be made. <br><br>

IT'S ALIVE !!!
Steve Anthony Morgan, Jr.
H. L. Bourgeois High School, Gray, LA, United States

Avicennia germinans, the black mangrove, is a tree that can grow in either fresh or salt water. Black mangroves may protect levees from storm surge and provide a nursery for small organisms with its roots. Since black mangrove seeds and seedlings may be killed by freezing temperatures, the purpose is to see if we can store black mangrove seeds over the winter months.<br><br> We looked at the influence of aeration, different salinity levels, and pericarp removal on seed survival.<br><br> My hypothesis is that seeds at low salinity levels with aeration will be healthier seeds. I think this because aeration will provide more oxygen than still water and salt will harm the seed. <br><br> We set up 48 containers with 3 treatments (salinity, aeration, pericarp removal) and a control (All done in 3 replicates). We used 4 salinity levels (0, 2.5, 5, and 10 parts per thousand). Pre and post experimentation, absorbance and pH in each container was measured. <br><br> The overall look of the seeds was healthier in texture and color in the aerated containers with healthiest seeds in the higher salinity containers. Fungus grew in the containers that had no aeration with pericarps adding acid to the container. <br><br> In conclusion, my hypothesis was rejected, the more salinity added to the containers the healthier the seeds were. Aeration kept the pH neutral and water clear. <br><br>

SEARCH FOR DESICCATION TOLERANCE GENES IN SMILAX BONA-NOX L.
David Antonio Shepard
Canterbury School, Fort Myers, Florida, U.S.A.

The goal of the project is to discover a desiccation tolerance gene in the plant Smilax bona-nox L. (Greenbrier). The discovery of such a gene and its introduction to crops is hypothesized to improve agricultural production in harsh climates.<br><br> In order to isolate the gene, the DNA of the plant was isolated through DNA extraction. The successful detection of the gene depended on the extraction technique used and purity of the isolated DNA. After the DNA extraction occurred successfully, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was used to clone the segment of DNA that was expected to be the desiccation tolerance gene. PCR works by denaturing the DNA segments, attaching primers, and doubling the number of DNA segments at the end of each cycle. Continued repetitions of this process over several hours yielded large numbers of the DNA segment of interest. The DNA segment was then isolated and its existence verified using gel electrophoresis. The DNA segment was cloned into plasmid vector and introduced into bacteria. This process yields large numbers of the DNA segment and makes it easy to use it. Cornell University then sequenced the DNA segment with positive results. The DNA segment has been identified as a desiccation tolerance gene fragment, making this the first time this gene has been found in Greenbrier.<br><br>

ELICITATION OF GENE EXPRESSION IN PINUS TAEDA AFTER CHALLENGE BY DENDROCTONUS FRONTALIS - ASSOCIATED FUNGI AS DETECTED BY RT-PCR
Katie Elizabeth Termer
Clay High School, Green Cove Springs Florida, United States

This is a third year continuation project to determine if Pinus taeda (Loblolly Pine) can produce gene expression in response to fungi associated with the Southern Pine Beetle, especially the mycangial fungi Entomocorticium species A, and Ophiostoma ranaculosus.<br><br>There are seven basic steps to the procedure: Inoculate pine stems with either a PDA control, Entomocorticium species A, Ophiostoma minus, Ophiostoma ranaculosus, or Fusarium circinatum, harvest challenged stem sections, extract RNA, DNase treat the RNA, reverse transcribe RNA (convert RNA to cDNA), use the Real-Time PCR to quantify expression of selected genes, and analyze the data. Each of these steps had a specific purpose to getting the final results of the experimentation.<br><br>The data shows that the different genes tested have a different response to the fungi associated with the Southern Pine Beetles. The first gene, Class III peroxidase, showed that Ophiostoma minus and Entomocorticium species A were significantly up-regulated (or "induced"; alpha<.05, t-test). The second gene, ACC synthase, was significantly down-regulated (or "repressed"; alpha<.05, t-test) in response to Ophiostoma minus and Ophiostoma ranaculosus.<br><br>I conclude that the two genes chosen for testing react differently to the mycangial fungi, suggesting that the Loblolly Pine may perceive the mycangial fungi through distinct mechanisms. If the tree can detect the fungi it may be possible to breed for resistance, and it may be possible for future testing to find if resistant trees respond more strongly than susceptible trees. The genes tested here, since their expression changes in response to the mycangial fungi, are candidate markers for resistance.

THE EFFECT OF VARIOUS PH ON THE ALLELOPATHIC INHIBITION OF LETTUCE GERMINATION BY OIL EXTRACT OF FENNEL SEEDS
Yi Yang
West Lafayette High School, West Lafayette IN, United States of America

Allelopathy states the chemical effect of plant species on the growth of one another in close proximity. Fenchone, a chemical in fennel essential oil, had been found to exhibit allelopathic effects on the germination of lettuce seeds. Lettuce seed germination assays were conducted to observe the effect of various pH on the inhibition of lettuce seeds. The germination percentage and root length were recorded in each experiment. The optimal concentration of fennel oil extract with 13 ml of pH 6 buffer solution was first assayed. Fennel oil was extracted by the process of distillation. Zero to 1.0 ml of fennel oil was each mixed with 50 lettuce seeds on top of 9 cm (diameter) filter papers. The germination was monitored for 8 days with full light. 0.2 ml of fennel oil was observed to inhibit 73% germination while 0ml and 0.4 ml inhibited 7% and 98%, respectively. Lettuce seeds were then assayed with 13 ml of pH 4-9 buffers with 0.2 ml fennel oil. The lettuce root growth peaked at pH 6 with 6.4 mm while inhibition increased towards pH 4 and 10 with 5.7 mm and 5.2 mm root growth, respectively. However, the change in pH had little effect on the germination percentage and root growth when compared relatively to the control with no fennel oil. The study also illustrated that even small concentrations of fennel oil can greatly inhibits the germination of lettuce seeds.

THE EFFECTS OF AN INCREASE IN WATER TEMPERATURE IN A HYDROPONICS SYSTEM ON THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF LACTUCA SATIVA LONGIFOLIA
Kevin Makana Kim
Henry Perrine Baldwin High School, Wailuku, Hawaii, USA

My experiment was to study the effects of an increase of water temperature in a hydroponic system on the growth of Lactuca sativa longifolia (Romaine lettuce). This project shows whether heating the water in a hydroponic system is beneficial by yielding more lettuce. To test this, one row of lettuce in a hydroponic system had heated water running though while another row had unheated water. I compared the lettuce of the two rows by diameter, height, and weight. The heated lettuce had an average end diameter 0.12 inches greater than the unheated lettuce and an average height of 1.27 inches taller than the unheated lettuce. Heated lettuce had an average head weight 69.35 grams heavier than that of the unheated lettuce and an average root weight 1.26 grams lighter than that of the unheated lettuce. The head to root ratio of the heated lettuce was approximately 7.9 to 1 while the unheated lettuce had a head to root ratio of 5.7 to 1. This large head to root ratio is preferable because it indicates that more of the plant’s resources were used in growing leaves rather than roots. All data is consistent with my hypothesis that the heads of the heated lettuce would be larger than that of the unheated lettuce and the head to root ratio would be larger in the heated lettuce. This experiment shows that heating the water in a hydroponic system yields more lettuce than unheated water and thus may be beneficial to farms using hydroponics.

THE COMPARISON OF ALUMINUM TOLERANCE IN DIFFERENT TRITICUM AESTIVUM L. VARIETIES PHASE III
Stacey Lee Vosters
North Daviess High School, Elnora Indiana, United States

This project was used to determine which Triticum aestivum L. varieties from the 1800s to the present-day are tolerant to aluminum ions found in the soil. Aluminum toxicity is the most common growth-limiting factor for wheat in acidic soils. Aluminum is naturally occurring, but amounts can be increased by farming practices and pollution. <br><br> The Hematoxylin Staining Method was used to determine the tolerance to aluminum. The 92 varieties were germinated for 24 hours before being placed into a nutrient solution. After 32 hours, the seedlings where moved into an aluminum solution with a concentration of .0027grams/mL or [.1 m] of aluminum. After 17 hours, the seedlings where stained using a hematoxylin stain which bound with the aluminum ions. The seedlings were placed back into the nutrient solution to re-grow. At the conclusion of 25 hours, the amount of re-growth was measured to determine tolerance. <br><br> The results of this experiment supported my hypothesis, which stated that the older varieties would be more tolerant to the aluminum than the newer varieties. Two controls were used in the experiment Atlas 66 which had an average re-growth of 7.583cm and Florida 302 with a re-growth of 7.846cm. Each of the 92 varieties being tested against the control varieties demonstrated little tolerance. PARKER had 1.909cm of re-growth, the greatest. TAM W-101 had .91cm of re-growth, the least. These results demonstrate that the varieties used in this experiment had little tolerance to aluminum, and farmers planting these varieties in acidic soil may experience significant yield reductions. <br><br>

NODULATION “STRATEGO,” RHIZOBIA EDITION: THE RELATIVE FITNESS OF SYMBIOTIC RHIZOBIA IN LEGUME NODULES
Kyra Gene Underbakke
Maranatha Christian Academy, Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, USA

Rhizobia in root nodules benefit their host by fixing atmospheric nitrogen; in return, they receive carbon to reproduce and store energy in the lipid polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). Species of legume form either determinate or indeterminate nodules. All rhizobia inhabiting determinate nodules are viable, fix nitrogen, and store PHB. In indeterminate nodules, a minority of the population remains viable and stores PHB, while the rest become specialized to fix nitrogen. Which type of nodule results in higher rhizobial fitness?<br><br> Since only a portion of the indeterminate nodule’s rhizobia store PHB, I hypothesize (H1) they accumulate PHB more quickly than rhizobia in determinate nodules. Because the N-fixing rhizobia in indeterminate nodules are terminally differentiated, I hypothesize (H2) that indeterminate nodules will contain fewer viable rhizobia. Thus, I hypothesize that there is a tradeoff between PHB accumulation and viable rhizobia population size.<br><br> Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) was chosen as the determinate species, and alfalfa (Medicago sativa) as the indeterminate. Nodules from a single cohort were harvested weekly for one month. Rhizobial fitness was estimated by determining viable rhizobial population size and mean PHB accumulation for each nodule via flow cytometry.<br><br> Rhizobia in indeterminate nodules had a smaller population, supporting (H2). However, the two types of nodules had similar amounts of PHB; thus (H1) was not supported. No evidence for a tradeoff between viable population size and PHB accumulation was detected; rhizobia in determinate nodules were found to possess a significant fitness advantage over rhizobia forming indeterminate nodules.<br><br>

COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE USED OF THE ANNELID LUMBRICUS TERRESTRIS VERSUS COMMON SOLUTIONS TO OPTIMIZE THE PROCESSES OF GERMINATION, GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF P. VULGARIS
Kevin N Pimentel
Colegio Maria Auxiliadora, Carolina, Puerto Rico

<br><br> Farmers look for ways to improve crops’ quality by making the soil<br><br> more fertile. Some methods are not healthy for the soil. The <br><br>question is: Which method will optimize germination, growth, and <br><br>development of Phaseolus vulgaris without harming the <br><br>environment?<br><br> Solutions of acetaminophen, aspirin and commercial fertilizer<br><br>were prepared by mixing 10g of each solid with 100mL of distilled <br><br>water. The solutions were placed in plastic bottles and kept <br><br>refrigerated. Before using the solutions, they were taken out of the<br><br> refrigerator and kept at room temperature.<br><br> Six aluminum pans were identified with letters: A (control :<br><br> received 20mL of distilled water), B (3 earthworms were added), C<br><br> (7 earthworms were added),D (received 20mL of acetaminophen<br><br> solution), E (received 20 mL of aspirin solution), and F<br><br>(received 20 mL of commercial fertilizer solution).<br><br> 500g of soil were placed inside each pan. Before planting the <br><br>seeds, the pH and soil temperature were measured. Containers A, <br><br>B, and C received 20mL of distilled water in alternated days, and <br><br>containers D, E, and F received 20mL of the indicated solutions in the <br><br>same period of time. Every seven days the pH and the soil <br><br>temperature were measured. Plants that germinated were measured; <br><br>the quantity of leaves in each container was counted and the color <br><br>and texture of the leaves were observed.<br><br> Results showed that Lumbricus terrestris improved the <br><br>germination, growth, and development processes of Phaseolus <br><br>vulgaris by enriching the soil with fecal deposits, maintaining the pH <br><br>levels almost neutral, and improving the air circulation due the <br><br>galleries they built. Plants growth bigger, the number of leaves was <br><br>higher per pan, and the quality of the leaves was better in the pans <br><br>that contain earthworms.<br><br>

ALOE - A BITTER PILL FOR TICKS TO SWALLOW
Tanja Kellerman
Citrusdal High, Citrusdal, Western-Cape, South Africa

Aloe ferox bitter extract was tested for its effectiveness in controlling ticks when administered orally to sheep.<br><br>The effect on tick numbers during the dry and rainy season were determined. Since bitter aloe powder is better soluble in apolar solvents than in water, liquid paraffin was compared with water to determine if it leads to improved bioavailability. <br><br>Sheep were given 10 ml single doses containing 1 gram bitter powder orally. Control groups received no dosage. Counts of ticks were recorded before and at intervals after the dosage. <br><br>Reduction in tick numbers were recorded. <br><br>In the treated group dosing in dry season (when tick numbers were low) it resulted in a 100% reduction, whereas in the rainy season (when tick numbers peaked), it resulted in a 90% reduction. In control groups there were an increase in tick numbers. The use of liquid paraffin instead of water had no effect.<br><br>The results of experiments show a significant drop in tick numbers giving strong evidence in support of the hypothesis that Aloe ferox bitter extract effectively controls ticks. <br><br>It has not been determined which ingredient is responsible for controlling external parasites like ticks. Aloïen’s bitter taste is so intense that it might be responsible for ticks not sucking on animals dosed with aloe. Ticks are therefore forced to revert to their natural prey such as hares, which leads to the limiting of their numbers.<br><br>Optimal dose levels and development of a commercial product for parasite control should be focused on in future studies. <br><br>

MEDIUM OPTIMIZATION FOR ACER PALMATUM IN VITRO
Michael James Bernert
West Linn High School, West Linn OR, USA

Plant research, genetic engineering, and propagation are increasingly dependent on in vitro culture techniques. However, effective in vitro culture of many species has not yet been achieved. This project addressed the difficulties encountered culturing Acer palmatum by establishing an improved model for the development of in vitro culture procedures. This model was executed in five steps. The first step involved securing a year-round, low-contamination supply of tissue for in vitro initiation. These tissue samples, called explants, were produced by an original forced flushing method. In the second step, the explants were established in vitro on media suggested by literature. These media experiments suggested possible sources of nutrient stress on cultures. In the traditional approach, media experiments continue until a superior medium is determined. This project transcended traditional experimentation by using ICP spectrometry to quantify the chemical intensity of the nutrient stress (step three) and using a novel ArcGIS application to quantify the visual intensity of nutrient stress (step four). Final experimentation (step five) tested media developed through the integration of step two experiments with chemical analysis (step three) and visual analysis (step four) against the medium recommenced by traditional experimentation. A medium developed through the new integrated model promoted significantly (P<.03) more leaf proliferation than the treatment suggested by traditional media experimentation. This project stated color and chemical analysis procedures and demonstrated that integrating these novel procedures with traditional media experimentation results in a more effective model for in vitro media research.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF NITRAPYRIN AND NITROGEN-BASED FERTILIZERS ON MICROBIAL ACTIVITY AND RUNOFF CONTAMINATION BY NITRATE
Dharti Bhulabhai Bhakta
Elko High School, Elko, Nevada, United States

The intent of experimentation was to clarify disputes concerning nitrification inhibitor applications and fertilizer use that may address reformed soil management techniques. Combinations of the nitrification inhibitor, nitrapyrin, and fertilizers of ammonium sulfate and organic materials created eight separate soil mixtures. The soils served to determine effects of dissolved nitrapyrin in water and acetone and fertilizer use on microbial activity and runoff contamination by nitrate under a simulated leaching system. It was hypothesized that organic fertilizer and nitrapyrin would provide sufficient microbial action and reduce nitrate leaching for ideal soil health. During a 46-day period, runoff contamination was measured by a Nitrate Ion-Selective Electrode probe. The activity of nitrifying bacteria was monitored through ammonium and nitrite concentrations using the Lamott Freshwater Kit. Overall microbial activity was determined by a soil respiration test. Results obtained from the experiment have not accepted the hypothesis as a whole. It was apparent that the application of nitrapyrin negatively affected alfalfa growth and microbial activity regardless of fertilizer use. Nitrapyrin may have eradicated seeds during the germination period. However, nitrapyrin did reduce runoff contamination with an average of 147 ppm nitrate concentration compared to the 439 ppm average collected by the fertilizers groups. In essence, natural soil without any fertilizers and chemicals exhibited preferable soil health with 133 ppm of average leached nitrate and 30.3 lbs. CO2-C/ac/day released during the soil respiration test.

A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF ENDOPHYTE TRANSMITTANCE VS. ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCE IN LEAFY SPURGE AND THEIR ANTIMICROBIAL PROPERTIES
Angela Roberta Tomsheck
North Toole County High School, Sunburst, MT, United States of America

Euphorbia esula (leafy spurge) is a very invasive, noxious weed, which releases allelopathic chemicals inhibitory to other plants. How do such plants produce allelopathic chemicals? Are they by-products produced by plant cells or by endophytes living within the plant tissues?<br><br> The first objective of this study served to determine if leafy spurge harbors endophytes and whether or not they are transferred to new annual plant growth. Second was to determine the effects of these endophytes on soil microbes.<br><br> I plated surface-sterilized leafy spurge tissues and isolated endophytes which grew from the tissue samples. Endophytes were isolated from plants that matured in their natural environment, from plants that matured from environmentally influenced roots in controlled laboratory settings (laboratory plants), and from plants that matured from environmentally influenced seeds in controlled laboratory settings. I then introduced isolated endophytes to plates inoculated with pathogenic test fungi (Fusarium pseudograminearum (Fpg), Pythium ultimum (Pu), Rhizoctonia solani (Rso), and Rhizopus stolonifer (Rst)). <br><br> Endophytes were compared from the different plant groups. T-tests revealed that plants maturing in their natural environment harbored significantly more endophytes than laboratory plants; roots harbored significantly more endophytes than other organs; Fpg was significantly inhibited by 44% of test endophytes, Rso by 50%, and Rst by 60%. Complete and partial inhibition occurred, with 20% tested endophytes significantly inhibiting three of three test fungi. The presence of endophytes in tissues grown in controlled laboratory settings indicates that leafy spurge transfers endophytes to new annual plant growth via roots and seeds.<br><br>

WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF VARIABLE DISSOLVED OXYGEN LEVELS AND PHOSPHATE LOADING ON THE ALGAE CLADOPHORA SP. IN A SIMULATED LAKE ERIE NEAR SHORE ENVIRONMENT VERSUS A CONTROL?
Stephanie Michelle Andrus
Beaumont School, Cleveland Heights, Ohio. United States of America 

There were three hypothesis: <br><br>1: In the containers with normal oxygen levels, the Cladphora sp. will grow throughout the test period. The container with 25 ppm phosphate added will grow rapidly. <br><br>2: In the containers with oxygen depletion, the Cladophora sp. will grow slowly and the container with the 25 ppm phosphate added will show signs of eutrophication. <br><br>3: In the containers with ozone added the Cladophora sp. will grow rapidly at first and then show signs of eutrophication due to lack of nutrient uptake.<br><br> <br><br>Hypothesis 1: was correct, as the algae grew throughout the test period under normal oxygen (6-8 ppm) levels. The added nutrient container (25 ppm phosphate) displayed no signs of eutrophication and the final algae tissue analysis had a phosphate content of 0.363%. <br><br>Hypothesis 2: was correct as the containers exposed to low dissolved oxygen levels (0-4 ppm) displayed signs of eutrophication after 15 days of exposure. A final algae tissue analysis displayed an algae phosphate tissue content of 0.005%. <br><br>Hypothesis 3: was incorrect, as the algae containers exposed to elevated dissolved oxygen levels (10-12 ppm) remained healthy throughout the test period. The algae was fragmented and browning below the water surface but no eutrophication was observed. The container with the added nutrient (25 ppm phosphate) had a final algae phosphate tissue level of 0.282%. <br><br>

THE ASSESSMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL GROWTH FACTORS ON ZEA MAYS L. PHASE V
Brandon David Wilson
West Central Valley High School, Stuart, Iowa, USA

Corn is planted at various population densities. It is being questioned whether the amount of nitrogen that producers apply is applied according to the target yield, or if producers apply nitrogen according to the population. <br><br>Phosphorus is also an important element to the production of corn. Research shows that 60% of phosphorus taken in by a corn plant is through the brace roots. <br><br>The purpose of this project is to determine the effect of the various factors have on yield and nutrient levels.<br><br>It’s hypothesized that the corn yield will be increased when you add nitrogen and decrease when you take away phosphorus. It’s also hypothesized that the starch will vary directly with the growth factors especially nitrogen.<br><br>Form 4 factor groups within populations. Use the populations of 25000, 33500, and 44000. The factor groups are; a control, a nitrogen group that only received 50 pounds of nitrogen, brace roots cut group, and a group with both brace roots cut and nitrogen applied. <br><br>The hypothesis was supported. The group that only had nitrogen applied, performed better than the other groups. The group with the brace roots cut and added nitrogen applied yielded second best, followed by the control group then the group with their brace roots cut. The population group with 33500 had the best yield, followed by 44000, then 25000.<br><br>The nutrient hypothesis was partially supported, in that the starch, and protein content showed direct correlation to the growth factors, it didn’t however show correlation to the population density. <br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF AUXIN AMIDES ON ROOTING IN HYBRID ASPEN
Rishika Chauhan
Snider High School, Fort Wayne, IN, United States

The purpose of my experiment was to compare the effectiveness of auxin amides, specifically indole acetamide (IAM) and naphthalene acetamide (NAM) and free auxins for root induction in tissue culture. Both short-exposure and continuous-exposure treatments were evaluated. For the short exposure treatment, leaf samples from hybrid aspen were cultured on media with free auxin; indole acetic acid (IAA), naphthalene acetic acid (NAA), or indole butyric acid (IBA), or auxin amide (IAM, NAM). Each growth regulator was evaluated two concentrations, ranging from 3-300 uM The leaves were transferred to hormone-free media after 30, 90, and 180 hours and evaluated for rooting after 3-4 wks For the continuous exposure treatment, the samples were left on the media continuously and a greater range of auxin concentrations (0.1-100 uM) were evaluated. Three replications of each experiment were completed and data was collected at the 3-4 week point. <br><br> For the short exposure treatment, the frequency of root formation and root yields were higher for the auxins (IAA, IBA, NAA) than the auxin amides (IAM, NAM). For the continuous exposure treatment, NAA is the strongest promoter of root formation. IAA did not promote much root growth and was weaker than the rest of the growth regulators, presumably because enzymes quickly break it down. Also, auxin amides produced more roots when left on the media continuously than when it was transferred to hormone-free media. The auxin amides were much more potent for the continuous exposure treatment than the short exposure treatments. <br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF RIBAVIRIN AND THERMOTHERAPY ON THE CLONING OF THE MERISTEM OF THE SOLANUM TUBEROSUM INOCULATED WITH POTATO VIRUS S, YEAR II
Neela Devi Thangada
Keystone School, San Antonio, Texas, USA

Potato Virus S (PVS) destroys 20 % of potato yields annually worldwide. A more damaging scenario occurs when PVS and other viruses, PVX and PVY, are in the plant simultaneously. The response is synergistic, resulting in greater yield losses. Today, researchers are looking at chemical and thermal techniques for eradicating virus from infected Solanum tuberosum plants. <br><br>This study was directed towards determining the ideal method of eradicating PVS from the potato, as well as distinguishing the treatment group with the highest survival rate. It was predicted that the combination of the antiviral drug, Ribavirin, and Thermotherapy would present the most virus- negative clones, and that the Ribavirin-Only treatment would have the highest survival at end of experimentation. <br><br>Fifty potato explants were excised at the internodal stage and cloned on an LS medium supplemented with Ribavirin. Fifty explants were cloned on regular LS media. After four weeks of observation, clones were moved into a heat chamber. The four- hour cyclic heat chamber alternated between 27 and 35 degrees Celsius. After four weeks of heat stress, clones were removed from heat chamber, excised, and tested using DAS ELISA to determine if virus eradication had occurred. <br><br>The results indicated 95% virus eradication in Ribavirin and Thermotherapy combined treatment group. Highest survival rate was seen in the control group with 81% survival. <br><br>Experimentation with virus eradication not only will result in economic success for growers, but will help suppress starvation and world hunger in developing countries<br><br>

HYDROGEN GAS PRODUCTION FROM IMMOBILIZED CHLAMYDOMONAS REINHARDTTI
John Wyatt Walls
South Pemiscot, Steele Missouri, USA

Hydrogen gas is considered a potential candidate for a future energy economy. Many microorganisms are able to produce hydrogen gas including photosynthetic organisms that use light as their energy source. These organisms are good sources for the photobiological production of hydrogen gas. Green algae can split water during photosynthesis and release hydrogen gas under certain conditions. The production of hydrogen by Chlamydomonas algae was investigated in this project. Research has shown that algae contain an enzyme, hydrogenase which will produce hydrogen when the algae are stressed by being deprived of sulfur and oxygen. The hypothesis of this project states that if algae is immobilized in a gel and deprived of sulfur and oxygen then the algae will produce more hydrogen than normal algae in a liquid suspension. The algae were grown in 2 liter bottles in spring water until a large number of cultures could be obtained. The algae were centrifuged to collect as pellets and the chlorophyll content was analyzed by extracting the chlorophyll and determining the amount of chlorophyll with a spectrophotometer. The algae was extracted from the water and immobilized in a sodium alginate gel. The algae balls were then placed in air tight chamber attached to an air pump which circulated air through a flow meter and through a Qubit hydrogen and oxygen sensor attached to a Vernier Lab Pro interfaced to a computer. As the container became anaerobic more hydrogen was produced. The hydrogen production was compared to algae grown in suspension and to the immobilized algae. There was an increase in hydrogen gas production using immobilized algae compared to the control algae in liquid suspension.<br><br><br>

THE EFFECT OF THERMAL PRETREATMENTS ON THE AMYLASE CONTENT OF BEAN SEEDS
Suzanne Marie Maloney
Beaumont School, Cleveland Heights, Ohio, USA

This experiment determined the effect of thermal pretreatments on the germination rates and percentages of Blue Lake 274 Bush Bean (Phaeselous vulgaris) seeds. Germination rates were studied by measuring amylase levels four days after imbibition and by observing emergence of the radicles. Maximum amylase levels generated after each pretreatment were determined eleven days after imbibition. Finally, length and mass measurements determined differences in root formation.<br><br> This experiment was based on two previous projects. Data from 2004 suggested possible germination rate enhancement with extended cooling pretreatments, and in 2005, amylase content measurements plotted its level throughout the germination process.<br><br> This experiment showed that thermal pretreatments have an important effect on the germination of bean seeds. Although extended cooling pretreatments did not enhance germination rates or increase the maximum amylase levels, the chilled seeds exhibited more extensive root growth than untreated seeds, suggesting they could have an improved drought resistance. While heating pretreatments could reduce bacteria levels on seed coats and the seeds had similar maximum amylase levels, the germination rates were reduced and the root development decreased with increasing temperature.<br><br> The imbibition process had a very significant effect on the germination rate. Three-hour imbibitions cut the germination time in half. Therefore, optimization of the imbibition is an excellent method to enhance germination rate, and a faster germination rate would shorten the time that the seeds are exposed to environmental hazards such as being eaten by animals, washed away by rainwater, or infected by molds and diseases.

BIOINFORMATIC AND EXPERIMENTAL ASSESSMENT OF THE TRANSLATIONAL CONTROL VIA UORF
Min-Chun Wu
Taipei Municipal Jianguo High School, Taipei, Taiwan

Protein kinases play pivotal roles in the growth and development of eukaryotic cells. Yak1-related protein kinase is a kinase family present in plants and is conserved through evolution. Defect of this kinase causes the minibrain syndrome in fruit fly and the Down syndrome in human. Interestingly, bioinformatic search indicates that upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in genes encoding Yak1-related protein kinase are evolutionarily conserved. Since uORF functions in the regulation of translational control, I studied whether the uORFs of Arabidopsis thaliana Yak1-related protein kinase, AtYAK1, can regulate its translation. My results showed that mutation of the four uORFs increased translation of downstream main ORF. To further evaluate the possible impact of uORFs in translational control, I performed bioinformatic search of uORFs in the whole genomes of Arabidopsis and yeast. The results showed the existence of uORFs predominates in genes encoding protein kinases, indicating a general translational control for regulating the expression of kinases. Possible molecular mechanisms for uORFs-mediated translational control will be discussed.

ALLELOPATHIC IMPACT OF MEDICAGO SATIVA LEACHATE ON ROOT NODULE DEVELOPMENT AND ELONGATION IN TRIFOLIUM REPENS
Sierra Dawn Gray 
Latta High School, Ada, Oklahoma, U.S.

The purpose of this project was to determine to what degree allelopathic chemicals excreted by Medicago sativa inhibit biomass, height, root, and nodule development in Trifolium repens grown with the addition of innoculants.<br><br> It was hypothesized that when allelopathic chemicals excreted by alfalfa seedlings are present, fewer root nodules would develop on the white clover, and those which do develop would be smaller, clover roots would have reduced thickness, and total plant height and biomass would be reduced. It was also hypothesized that the innoculant addition would promote increased numbers of root nodules.<br><br> One hundred eighty white clover plants were grown for 25 days using six different treatment methods. Alfalfa extract was applied at full strength and half strength in combination with innoculant. Total plant length from root tip to shoot tip was measured. Using a microscope, root nodules were counted and roots were photographed to determine relative root diameter. Finally, plants were dried and massed to find total plant biomass. <br><br> It was found that the alfalfa extract treatment caused the total plant length to be diminished. It also caused the root nodules and the total plant biomass to be slightly higher than the control. The extract caused the total root diameter to be decreased as compared to the control. It was also found that the innoculant addition caused the total plant length to decrease and cause the plant biomass to increase. The innoculant treated plant also caused a significant number of nodules to be produced. <br><br>

ANALYSIS OF THE ARABIDOPSIS FUSED ORTHOLOG: IS IT REQUIRED FOR CELL DIVISION?
Scott Michael Peters
John F. Kennedy High School, Bellmore, New York, United States

Mutations in the OPEN HOUSE (OPN) gene cause defects in cytokinesis, the process of daughter cell separation following nuclear division. The opn-12-15 allele contains a lesion in the predicted gene At1g50230, however, no lesions in At1g50230 were found in the opn-OX10 allele. A phylogenetic analysis determined that At1g50230 is the ortholog of FUSED-type protein kinases of animals. Based on homology to animal FUSED genes, it was hypothesized that the neighboring predicted genes At1g50230 and At1g50240 together form the OPN transcription unit. In support of this view, the DNA of opn-OX10 seedlings was found to contain a lesion in At1g50240, which results in a non-conservative substitution of amino acids. This mutation partially inactivates the OPN protein, as the opn-OX10 mutation is temperature sensitive and results in a stronger mutant phenotype at 27°C compared to 16°C. Since animal FUSED-type kinases interact with kinesins and mutations in the Arabidopsis kinesin radially swollen root 7 (rsw7) cause similar defects in cytokinesis as mutations in the Arabidopsis FUSED ortholog OPN, it was hypothesized that the opn-OX10 might interact with rsw7. However, no synergistic interactions between weak alleles of rsw7 and opn-OX10 were observed, suggesting that the two genes likely act independently.

STOMATA: HOW DO POLLUTANTS AFFECT PELARGONIUM HOTORUM?
Marco Antonio Alvarez
Gladys Porter High School, Brownsville, Texas, United States

Stoma in Greek means “mouth,” which states that the plants mouths are called stomata. Like humans, plants have a mouth which creates oxygen, which enables living things to breath. The stomata of a plant does not only help plants breath but also helps us breath healthy air. When stomata are opened they lose H2O but convert CO2 to oxygen at the same time. When stomata are exposed to pollutants they cannot function correctly. This experiment will allow us to observe how pollutants affect plants. If Pelargonium hotorum is exposed to a variety of pollutants such as gasoline, smoke, and contaminated water the stomata reaction towards the smoke pollutant will not function properly.<br><br> Use four boxes covered with paper and make holes in them. Put a plant in each box with a different kind of pollutant. Expose the plant for a desired amount of time. When working with gasoline and smoke work in a ventilated area. Make sure that these two pollutants are not exposed to each other. Cut a piece of leaf and expose epidermis until it is clear. Put the clear epidermis into a slide and observe the stomata through a microscope.<br><br> My hypothesis was partially correct. When Pelargonium hotorum is exposed to smoke it had a strong effect on it but not like it did with the gasoline. The contaminated water also had an effect on it, but not as strong as the other two. <br><br>

The purpose of may research is to determine the alicina’s activity in the garlic (Allium sativum) like an antimycotic principle about Botrytis cinerea and Pleurotus. Our region has high increasing supported with the exportation of wine. Each vineyard produces grapes of good quality. Nevertheless the grey rot caused by Botrytis is one of the main fit sanitary problems that affect the vine from the 3rd region to 7 th region of Chile. By the way, the white rot caused from the Pleurotus in woody trees, like Pinus radiata (pine insigne), reduced the biomass in trees.<br><br>Essays were made in vitro using extract of garlic on Botrytis and Pleurotus being compared with a commercial pesticide and negative control with distilled water. The presence of alicina was quantified and identified trough chromatography in thin layer chromatography using an hexane: ethyl acetate (60:40) recognizing under U.V. and liquid chromatography of high pressure (HPLC) using a movable phase methanol: water (1:1), at 240 nm.<br><br>The results show an inhibition in the growing of Botrytis an Pleurotus the essays in vitro, the effectiveness was higher in Botrytis than Pleurotus, in this last case of similar action to the commercial pesticide that was used.<br><br>By chromatographic quantification was got 8,8 ml/g of dry weight in accordance with the bibliography, which indicates values between 8,2 and 17,4 ml/g considering the humidity of 64 %.<br><br>The contribution of may investigation is to promote the using of alicina like an organic antimycotic which would benefit the development of organic agriculture in vineyard, forest and others. This initiative promotes the working and economic development for our region which has lots of vineyards and forest activity.<br><br>

THE POTENTIAL FERTILIZER EFFECT OF THE DETROIT RIVER
Zeinab Abbas Hachem
Dearborn Center for Math, Science, and Technology, Dearborn Heights, MI, US

This experiment tested the Detroit River’s potential fertilizer effect on plants. The hypothesis stated: Detroit River water would enhance the growth of plants more than tap water. Since most of Southeastern Michigan gets tap water from the Detroit River, the experiment will observe unfiltered water (Detroit River) versus filtered water (tap). Nitrate and phosphate tests were conducted on the water because they play an important role in the growth of plants. Distilled water was used as a control for the water analysis and to stay consistent was used to water the plants. Two trials were conducted. The first contained 3 groups of 18 Pansy Plants watered with each water sample (Detroit River water, tap water, and distilled water). The growth of the plants was measured in terms of height (cm) from two stems in each plant cell for 31 days. The data confirmed the Detroit River plants had a p-value of 0.1315 indicating there was no significant difference in the use of Detroit River water. The second trial involved Wisconsin Fast Plants and the use of a wick system. There were 18 plants for each water sample. The growth of the plants was measured in terms of height (cm) in each plant cell for 31 days. The data confirmed the Detroit River plants had a p-value of 0.7418 indicating there was no significant difference in the use of Detroit River water. The Detroit River water did not make a significant difference in the growth of the plants in either experiment.

RAIN INDUCED DIFFUSION OF MONOTERPENES FROM BASIN BIG SAGEBRUSH
Preston Kenneth Spaulding
Weber High School, Pleasant View, UT

The distinct fragrance of sagebrush is due to a group of volatile oils called monoterpenes. The oil’s fragrance is attributed to medicinal benefits including a feeling of exhilaration. The purpose of this project was to create a mathematical model that predicts the best time of the year to experience that fragrance. Three variables were identified that affect the diffusion rate of monoterpenes from the inner leaf to the atmosphere. These are species (concentration of monoterpenes in leaf), temperature, and water (rain). Experiments were performed on Basin Big Sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. tridentata), which generally populate the western United States desert ranges. Sprigs of sagebrush were soaked in water at three controlled temperatures. The amount of monoterpenes, extracted by the water, was measured periodically. The diffusion rate of monoterpenes from the leaves to the water was determined by using linear regression. A best fit curve was then generated for the diffusion rate versus temperature. This polynomial equation was then applied to the weather patterns of the north western desert ranges of the state of Utah. The results predict that the best time to experience the fragrance of sagebrush in Utah is during the month of May. This is important because it furthers understanding of chemical communication in an ecosystem.

HOW WILL THE LACK OF DIFFERENT MINERALS IN THE FERTILISER AFFECT THE GROWTH OF THE TOMATO PLANT AND THE TASTE OF THE FRUIT?
Astri Soiland
International School of Stavanger, Stavanger, Norway

In this experiment I looked at how the lack of essential minerals in the fertilizer affects the growth of tomato plants and the taste of the fruit. To find out this I grew 25 plants for my experiment and made ten different solutions to fertilize them, one solution containing all the minerals and the rest lacking one each. Four of the plants grew in soil and I gave them fertilizer from a shop – this was my control group. Three plants got all the minerals, leaving two plants for each mineral lacking. Every week I inspected and measured them and in the end I compared the taste of their fruits. I found that every mineral gave different deficiency symptoms, some affecting the mature leaves first, some the growth point. The plants not getting nitrogen, phosphorus or boron were all short plant without flowers or fruits. The plants not getting the other minerals did not show deficiency until they had flowers and their fruits started to develop. The plants in soil grew much quicker and had larger and more fruit than any of the other plants. The best tasting fruits were also the tomatoes from the plants in soil; however, the tomatoes from the plants not getting iron where the nicest looking with very shiny appearance and sweet taste.

DO BIOTECH CROPS MEASURE UP? COMPARISON OF GERMINATION AND GROWTH IN GENETICALLY MODIFIED SEEDS VS. NON-MODIFED SEEDS.
Lindsay M. Stewart
Grove High School, Grove, Oklahoma, USA

<br><br><br> The use of genetically altered crops can help reduce the pollution due to the use of harmful pesticides and insecticides. Certain crops can be genetically altered so that they have an insecticide or pesticide already built into them. These plants will deter insects and resists fungus with minimum use of chemicals. The decision about whether to plant genetically modified crops is complex and varies from farmer to farmer, but ultimately it rests upon perceived economic benefits.<br><br> The purpose of this research is to determine the germination and growth rate of genetically modified seeds and non-modified seeds.<br><br> It was hypothesized that the genetically modified seeds will have the higher average germination and growth rate as compared to the non-modified seeds.<br><br> Various germination tests and a hydroponic growth test were performed to determine the germination and growth rate of the seeds.<br><br> In most tests the non-modified soybeans out performed the genetically modified soybeans. The non-modified soybeans always germinated sooner, had longer epicotyls and greater growth rate. The genetically modified corn only slightly out performed the non-modified corn in all three germination tests, but did far better than the non-modified corn in the epicotyl length and hydroponic growth rate test.<br><br> These specific genetically modified soybean seeds would probably work best in areas with a longer growing season. I would conclude that the genetically modified corn is a good choice for any farmer.<br><br>

CAN WE PUT GREENHOUSES ON THE MOON?
Terrence Louis George
Lincoln Park High School, Chicago, Illinois, USA

<br><br> The purpose of this experiment is to determine how well flora can grow in closed hypobaria and high plant-generated humidity. This project could be used to address two obstacles, the lack of a self sustaining food source and sufficient amounts of breathable oxygen, which render lunar colonization improbable.<br><br> Two co-experiments were conducted. In the first one 320 plants were separated into 4 groups: the control group (ambient pressure), 92 KPa, 52 KPa and 32 KPa. The three experimental groups were all placed in hypobaric chambers pressurized to their respective KPa measurement. In total there were 8 trials 4 of which used a dehumidifier. The second used potometers to measure the transpiration of 80 plants. <br><br> The ambient pressure and 92 KPa group plants had the highest survival rate followed by the 52 KPa and 32 KPa group plants. On average, the death rates of the dehumidified tests were lower than their non-dehumidified counterpart. Plant transpiration increased steadily with declining pressures. A possible explanation for these results is that the lower the atmospheric pressure the more rapid a plant transpires. While in the confines of the vacuum chamber the overly excited transpiration led to an excess of humidity which stifled the Carbon dioxide inflow rate and killed the plants, (Smith, Donahue, 1991). <br><br>

USE OF SATELLITE IMAGERY FOR PREDICTING VEGETATION PRODUCTIVITY AND RODENT-BORNE DISEASE
Raphael Ignacio Perea
Cibola High School, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA

This project describes how Landstat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite imagery was used to evaluate biomass data and predict a correlation between vegetation abundance and the high risk of rodent-borne disease. It is assumed that more vegetation will result in more rodents and, consequently, in more rodent-borne disease. Previous analysis of TM images from past years had predicted a low risk of disease in drought seasons and a high risk in monsoon seasons, thus confirming the usefullness of satellite images in identifying the location and extent of areas with high risk of rodent-borne disease.<br><br> Landstat 5 TM imagery was used to study the biomass in the Valles Caldera area in Jemez Springs, New Mexico during the spring/summer/fall of 2006. That year was an unusually abundant summer monsoon which resulted in increased vegetation. The area studied was divided into sections of low, medium, and high biomass abundance, estimated by cutting, drying and weighing vegetation samples. These biomass predictions were compared with normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) worked out for each section from satellite imagery data. These NDVI correlations were strongly in agreement with the biomass estimates.<br><br> Satellite imagery identified two factors that support the use of TM imagery in forecasting disease outbreaks. First, the recognition of environmental changes that could affect the patterns and outcome of rodent-borne disease, and second, the use of TM data as an early warning system to identify biological features that correlate NDVI and biomass.

PHYSICAL PARAMETERS RELATED TO SEED SELECTION FOR THE COMMERCIAL CULTURE OF THE PAPAYA TREE (CARICA PAPAYA)
Abdiel Jose Ortiz
Colegio Radians, Cayey (Puerto Rico), United States

Papaya is an important agricultural product around the world due to its extensive traditional and commercial use. A limiting factor for the growers is the relatively long germination period combined to the possibility that after waiting from 6 to 10 months for the trees to bloom, part of the cultivar turns out to be masculine unproductive plants. The driving question for this research is whether there are a set of characteristics in the seeds that would allow growers to anticipate their reproductive success as determined by its germination rate, its post-germination growth rate and the sex ratios. To address this question, papaya fruits were choose at random, split and each seed on its were mapped using a grid. Seeds were randomly taken representing different sectors of the fruit and were taken to the lab to determine its volume, mass, density and diameter. All seeds were planted under the same conditions and followed in its growth up to the present. The results showed that the mean diameter of the seeds was 6.63 mm (+/- 0.80), the mean volume was 1.36 cc (+/- 0.50), the mean density was 0.15 gm/cc (+/- 0.04), and the mean mass was 0.2 gm (+/- 0.06). The mean germination span was 21 days (+/- 1.84), and the mean post germination rate was 0.77 cm/day (+/- 0.16). No statistically significant correlations were found but a strong pattern were observed between seed volume and germination span (t = 0.66; p >.05), between seed mass and post germination growth rate (t = 0.44; p >.05) and between seed density and post germination growth rate (t = 0.84; p >.05). It is recommended that growers screen their seeds for the ones having less volume to get shorter germination spans and for the ones with greater mass or density to get faster post germination growth rates.

COMPARISON OF ANTI-TUMOR EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT SPECIES OF MISTLETOE
Andrew David Robatcek
Henley High School, Klamath Falls, Oregon, United States

GOAL: My project compared 4 different mistletoe samples in respect to their possible anti-cancer effects in the laboratory.<br><br>BACKGROUND: European and Korean mistletoe species are used in cancer treatement. Powder form is available online, but the injection is only practiced in Europe. In the Klamath area, we have several species of mistletoe. I wanted to know if these local species also have anti-cancer effects, and whether each local species differ from each other. I hoped that the mistletoe extracts would kill or stop growth of the tumor cells.<br><br>PLANT MATERIALS: I tested four mistletoe samples for different effects on a tumor cell line, K562. I bought a sample of dried European mistletoe online from a producer. I collected mistletoe from oak trees from Medford, Oregon and mistletoe from juniper trees from Tulelake, California. The juniper species seemed to have a different type on the same branch that looked almost comparable to the oak mistletoe. I harvested this as a separate sample and compared it to the other samples.<br><br>METHODS: I initially compared 9 extraction methods by gel electrophoresis, and used the best 3 for futher testing on K562: 1)water/boiling, 2) water/room temperature, 3)ethanol/room temperature. I ran gel electrophoresis to compare the molecular band pattern of each. I tested these extracts on K562 with respect to growth, death, and mitochondrial function.<br><br>RESULTS/CONCLUSION: I found that the water extracts of local mistletoe blocked mitochondrial funtion in K562 at least as well as European mistletoe, and induced programmed cell death.

Maria Cristina Esmeralda Stang
Polimodal No. 1, Dr.Tognon, Cte. Luis Piedra Buena, ARGENTINA

This proposal of research aims to modify the traditional way of hydroponic cultivation of vegetables in the Patagonia Argentina. Consists in an intent for the preservation of water as a critical natural resource. Hydroponic production is a very valuable way to obtain nutritive food all over the year due to the stressing soil and climatic conditions of this region. As it is practiced actually requires of periodical replacement of the growing solution in about 25 days cycles. <br><br>The composition of the nutritive solution used included SO4 (NH4)2, K2SO4, Ca3(PO4)2, MgSO4, Fe2(SO4)3 and the vegetables gown were Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) and Parsley (Petroselinum drispum L.). After the first cycle the residual solution was analyzed, detecting a reduction in the concentration of nitrogen, potassium and calcium that was corrected to the original values. The solution reaction was stabilized to pH 5. The microbiological study did not detect pathogenic organisms. <br><br>The recycling equipment priories the use of low cost materials and consists of a filter with sand and activated carbon of local availability, a control chamber in regard of failures in the filter and a second chamber for disinfection with NaClO (active Cl2: 1mg/L). The solution circulation was controlled by a 1000 rpm electrical pump.<br><br>The production of lettuce and parsley obtained trough the second cycle of use in the corrected solution was equivalent to that of the first cycle and no deficiency or pathogenic symptoms were observed.<br><br>

GLYPHOSATE EFFCIENCY: DETERMINING THE RIGHT RATE FOR THE RIGHT WEED HEIGHT.
Sarah Katherine Redenius
Southeastern High School, Augusta, Illinois, United States

The purpose of this project is to relate the importance of using the right rate of glyphosate for the right weed height so that weed species will not survive treatments and produce more tolerant or resistant offspring. Uncontrolled outbreaks of glyphosate resistant waterhemp and lambsquarter could cost U.S. producers nearly $500 million a year and needs to be studied (Scott, 2006). The hypothesis of this project is that when glyphosate is applied to waterhemp and lambsquarter, the survival rate will be inversely proportionate to the amount of glyphosate used. <br><br>Waterhemp and Lambsquarter seeds were planted 10 days apart to produce plants of various heights. Group 1 had an average height of 5 to 10 centimeters. Group 2 had an average height of 15 to 20 centimeters. Group 3 had average height of 25 to 30 centimeters. These groups were placed into sub groups that were sprayed at different rates. Plants were observed daily and data was recorded on survival rates. Analysis of herbicide damage was recorded using a rank scale of 1 to 5. <br><br>It was found that the plants sprayed with greater rates of glyphosate faced a quicker and more efficient death. The percentage of dead plants was also directly proportional to the amount of herbicide sprayed. <br><br>Glyphosate Resistance is formed through natural selection. By applying glyphosate year after year this process is accelerated. Therefore, dead weeds cannot be allowed to survive and produce tolerant or resistant offspring. Killing weeds slows down the natural selection process. <br><br>

Megan Marie Meyer
Hankinson High School, Hankinson, ND United States of America

PURPOSE: To determine if tea extracts could be used as an environmentally friendly pesticide. Secondly, to observe whether the tea extracts would have any adverse affects on the growth of wheat. Finally, to compare the chemical content of the teas.<br><br>PROCEDURES: Collected 3 teas (black, green, and white), and prepared solutions by blending 10 grams of tea with 200mls of distilled water. (20:1) For the chemicals; used the field application rates.<br><br>INSECT STUDY: Performed two tests checking the solutions’ effects on both nuisance and beneficial insects. Examined the fatality rate of bothersome insects (Two field insects and three storage grain insects) and tested the migratory characteristics of beneficial ladybeetles.<br><br>PATHOGEN STUDY: Tested tea extracts for their inhibitory properties on the growth of pathogenic and beneficial bacteria. Furthermore, analyzed the solutions ability to fend off the growth of bacteria, when applied directly onto wheat.<br><br>Plant Study: Compared four wheat seeds for root and shoot growth, and germination percentage, while using tea as a growth promotant.<br><br>CHEMICAL ANALYSIS: Determined the amount of tannic acid, caffeine, and pH of the teas.<br><br>CONCLUSION: Insect Study: The teas were found to have slower fatality rates than the insecticide, though they did not harm the lady beetles as compared to the insecticide. Pathogen Study: The teas outperformed the bactericide using both pathogenic and beneficial bacteria strains. Plant Study: Concluded that the teas actually promoted the growth of wheat. Overall: I feel that tea does show potential as a safe and effective alternative to commercial pesticides.<br><br>

REPELLING INSECTS
Victoria Lynn Koupal
Avon Public School, Avon, SD, United States

Hedge apples are fruit produced by the Osage-orange (Maclura pomifera) tree. Although these fruits are inedible, last year our small town grocery store sold over 100 of them because of their legendary ability to rid houses of insects and spiders. I therefore designed an experiment to test the efficacy of hedge balls as an insect repellant.<br><br>A hedge apple was placed at one end of a clear plastic tube. Twenty crickets (Acheta domesticus) were then sealed in the tube. After four hours, I counted the number of crickets that passed the halfway point.<br><br>The hedge apple was then placed on the opposite side of the tube and the experiment was repeated. After twenty trials, virtually all of the crickets moved to the end without the hedge apple. Since some remained on the side with the hedge apple, I checked my results against the binomial distribution and found the results to be statistically significant. For a control, the experiment was conducted with no hedge apple in the tube. In these trials the crickets split approximately even between the half with the hedge apple and the half without the hedge apple. <br><br>The benefit of this research is hedge apples may contain natural insecticidal properties. This could lead to inexpensive, safe, and effective insect repellents. Research is ongoing to test its effectiveness against other orders of insects as well as comparing it to commercially available insect repellents such as deet.<br><br>

SEXUAL VERSUS ASEXUAL PROPAGATION USING HYBRIDS AND NON-HYBRIDS OF ORCHIDS, WHICH IS MORE EFFECTIVE?
Jonathan Ore Ibasco
Samoana High School, Pago Pago, American Samoa

The project conducted dealt with the experimentation of two methods used to mass produce orchids; sexual (seed culture) and asexual (tissue culture/clone) propagation. These methods were used to determine which would mass produce orchids more effectively. The sexual propagation method dealt with two experiments; a hybrid (combination of two different but related species) and a non-hybrid (self pollinated). The sexual propagation method had a control, to show the effectiveness of moving the orchid to fresh medium. The asexual propagation method or tissue culture dealt with growing points or buds of the hybrid and non-hybrid orchid experimented on.<br><br> Three different media were used; CS (charcoal and sugar), CIS (charcoal, IBA and sugar) and K+ (Knudsons). The CS medium facilitates the seed to germinate. The CIS medium promotes a balanced growth. The Knudsons medium was used to promote cell division. The CS and CIS media were used for sexual propagation and the K+ medium was used for asexual propagation. Initially, the seeds for sexual propagation were grown in the CS medium and were transferred to the CIS medium after a month to balance growth of the plantlets. <br><br> Data collection was a monthly basis; using centimeters to measure the approximate plant growth. Seeds grew progressively on the medium for seed culture. Buds or protocorms formed and multiplied from the tissue culture. Plant production showed positive result for the seed culture, showing that sexual propagation or seed culture is the most effective way for orchid mass production.<br><br>

DETERMINING HYBRIDS FROM THE DNA OF INTERSPECIFIC CROSSES BETWEEN CORNUS KOUSA AND CORNUS FLORIDA
Ashley Marie Gann
Jefferson County High School, Dandridge, Tn, USA

Cultivars of Cornus kousa and C. florida were crossed by hand pollination. The purpose of this research was to determine if hybridization had occurred between any of the crosses. There were a total of 48 potential hybrid samples (not including the parent samples). The hybrids were determined by using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples. Genomic DNA samples from the potential hybrid crosses were isolated using Qiagene and were amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Primer selection was critical in identifying the hybrids. Primers that successfully identified hybrids included A11 and A108. Gel electrophoresis followed to determine if the monomorphic bands of the potential hybrids match the bands of the parental DNA.

A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH: CHARACTERIZATION OF A SALT-INDUCIBLE LIPASE GENE FROM ARABIDOPSIS SUGGESTS A LINK BETWEEN PROGRAMMED CELL DEATH AND SALT STRESS
David Andrew Levary
Parkway Central High School, St. Louis MO, USA

Soil salinity is a major abiotic stress in plant agriculture that severely limits crop yield worldwide. Here I identify a novel, salt-inducible lipase gene (Slip1) from Arabidopsis that is localized to the root cortex and endodermis. I have isolated and am currently pursuing characterization of a T-DNA insertion in the promoter of Slip1 that results in a decrease of Slip1 expression in response to salt stress. Computer modeling suggests Slip1 is targeted to mitochondria and could cleave fatty acids from membrane phospholipids in an sn-1 specific manner. By integrating my results with a variety of published data, a model was generated in which programmed cell death of root cortical cells during salt stress decreases sodium content in xylem fluid. This mechanism of salt-stress response could be widely distributed across crop plants as homologues to the genes implicated in this process (including Slip1) have been identified in several such plant species. Indeed, targeted manipulation of programmed cell death in the root cortex may one day provide the current generation of salt-tolerant crop plants with the increased level of growth necessary to become a key element of the world’s food supply.

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ECOLOGICAL NICHE OF PLANTS AND THE FACTORS AFFECTING THE GERMINATION OF THEIR SEEDS
Benjamin Fitzroy Hughes
Shore School, North Sydney , New South Wales, Australia

In this project it was hypothesised that the conditions which stimulate the germination of seeds will vary according to, and be consistent with, the ecological niche of the parent plant. It was expected that there would be substantial differences in the triggers to germination between dry sclerophyll and rainforest plants in adjoining dune ecosystems at Blueys Beach in NSW Australia.<br><br>The experiment is relevant to the revegetation of eroded and disturbed costal dunes as the results can be used to aid in the revegetation process.<br><br>Two dry sclerophyll species, Acacia sophorae and Banksia integrifolia, and two rainforest species, Alphitonia excelsa and Syzygium leuhmannii, were selected. Possible germination triggers tested were: short-term exposure to heat, with and without exposure to smoke chemicals; medium-term exposure to heat; exposure to smoke chemicals alone; scarification; and soaking in acid.<br><br>Germination of the dry sclerophyll plants was either advantaged or not disadvantaged by short-term exposure to heat and/or smoke chemicals. The Acacia also responded to scarification but had a delayed and low germination rate without treatment. Erosion of the Acacia seed coat by wind blown sand in the dune environment was also suggested as a germination trigger.<br><br>Exposure to heat had a substantial adverse impact on the germination of the rainforest plants, while exposure to acid aided germination of the fleshy-fruited Syzygium leuhmannii. Significantly, exposure to smoke chemicals substantially inhibited, but did not prevent, the germination of two Syzygium species.<br><br>These results are consistent with, but not sufficient to conclusively prove, the experimental hypothesis.<br><br>

FUNGICIDAL PROPERTIES OF CLAUSENA EXCAVATA
Genesis Serrano-Rodriguez
Timoteo Delgado School, Hatillo, Puerto Rico

The extracts of Clausena excavata were studied as potential biological fungicide for Fusarium oxysporum and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. The hypothesis established that the extracts of Clausena excavata could have fungicidal properties for Fusarium oxysporum and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. Different parts of Clausena excavata were collected to prepare the extracts. Each part was crushed in a mixer in a proportion of 1:2 with distilled water. These solutions were heated to 100°C and filtered. The cultures were prepared using Potato Dextrose Agar. The plates were inoculated with the fungi and were placed in an incubator at 28°C for 4 days. Two wells of 0.2 mL volume were made at the edge of the fungal colony and were filled with the extract. The plates were incubated for 5 days at 28°C. The halo around the extract was measured to know the effect of the treatments on fungal growth. The average halo width for Fusarium oxysporum was 0.0 mm in all the treatments with the exception of the fungicide control, which was 14.6 mm. In the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides there were more noticeable effects: root extract 11.5 mm, immature fruit extract 10.1 mm, leaf extract 9.6 mm, mature fruit extract 9.2 mm, bark extract 9.0 mm, water 6.2 mm and the fungicide 19.7 mm. For Fusarium oxysporum the extracts were ineffective; in the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides they showed greater effect, especially the root extract, although none surpassed the fungicide control. These results proved that only the root of the plant, was effective against, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides.<br><br>

MAGNETIZED WATER AND FERRTILIZER: EFECTS ON GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF PHASEOLUS VULGARIS AND ORYZA SATIVA
Raul Alejandro Gonzalez
San German Interamerican High School, San German, Puerto Rico

Researchers have found that magnetism affects photosynthesis, roots and amylose activity in plants. In this research, water and a diluted fertilizer were magnetized to study its possible effects on plants. These were put in metal pots with magnets for 72 and 96 hours. Tap water and fertilizer were used as the control. Plants were treated daily using different combinations of these solutions. Fertilizer treatments were applied weekly. The 96 hours magnetized water had the highest pH. With the fertilizer, pH increased with magnetization time. Water and fertilizer conductivity was lower than that of the control. On Phaseolus vulgaris, 96 hour magnetized water and fertilizer combinations resulted in longer roots than the control in Petri dishes. Treatment with non magnetized water and 72 hours magnetized fertilizer resulted in taller plants. The number of flowers increased with the 96 hour magnetized for water and fertilizer. Water and 96 hour magnetized fertilizer treatments produced twice the amount of flowers than the control. Three combinations, all including 96 hour treatments of water and fertilizer, increased the amount of pods. In Oryza sativa, the average root length, using 72 hours magnetized water with non magnetized fertilizer treatment, surpassed the length of the control. On all combinations of 96 hours magnetization treatments, average height of plants was longer than the control. Three treatments of 96 hour magnetized water and fertilizer, resulted on more panicles than the control. The most effective treatments were different combinations of 96 hours magnetized water and fertilizer.

A NEW METHOD IN MAKING DOMESTIC ORGANIC WASTE PRODUCTS USEFUL TO AGRICULTURE
Yasemin Elgun
Isparta Suleyman Demirel Science High School, Isparta, Turkey 

The aim of this project is to prevent the pollution of air, water and soil by decreasing artificial fertilizers and agricultural chemicals, to prevent these chemicals from inhabiting food products, to decrease the loss of flora and fauna, to prevent erosion, to reclaim organic waste products and to use an unprecedented method in our country to promote organic agriculture by converting domestic organic waste products into composite.<br><br> In this project, organic fertilizers were produced by using domestic organic waste products. The obtained organic fertilizers were converted into tablets after the dry sterilization process. Following this, holes were made on the tablets and then the seeds of Phaseolus vulgaris were placed in these holes. We composed a test group of flower pots by putting organic tablets in each pot. For the control group, the obtained organic fertilizer and seeds were mixed with the soil. In both groups soil which hadn’t been used for agriculture before was used.<br><br> At the end of the experiment, it was observed that the Phaseolus vulgaris seeds placed in tablets grew faster, developed better, the number of leaves and their coloration compared with those of the control group were superior.<br><br> We have developed a new agricultural method not used in our country before by obtaining composites from organic waste products and organic tablets from composites. Thus both the producer’s efforts and the plants resistance have been greatly improved and productivity has been increased. In addition, the advantages of a healthy and non-chemical diet have been produced for the consumer. Also, this project aims to enable farmers to be optimally self-sufficient, economize on time, and minimize external inputs.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT LIGHT WAVELENGTHS ON A PLANT'S PRODUCTION OF STARCH
Alexandra Berger Valente
Escola Americana de Campinas, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil

Plants acquire electron donors and receivers from the sun, which enable them to make ATP and NADPH. The electron transport chain will then be used to reduce carbon dioxide into starch and sucrose, which will remain in the stroma until required by the plant.<br><br> Each plant requires a specific quantum which is inversely proportional to the electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths provided by light, the shorter wavelength provides more energy (joules) to the plant. The quantum should be exactly the same as the amount of photons required by the plant to carry out the electron transport chain. On the radiation scale, the solar wavelength is between the Ultraviolet and Infrared, meaning that violet provides more photons than the red, making yellow and green in between the two poles.<br><br> By varying the quantum that each leaf receives by covering each one with cellophane paper, the leaf should not be able to carry out the electron transport chain at its full capacity. The plant should function better with the blue cellophane paper, followed by the red, yellow, green and black. The consequence of this manipulation was observed by the amount of starch produced and stored in the stroma by soaking the leaf in Lugol and drying it on a paper towel. It was possible conclude that the manipulation of the photons provided to the plant does interfere with its production of starch according to hypothesized. <br><br>

a) Purpose/ Questions: Did Aceria malherbae over winter in the root system of Convolvulus arvensis? <br><br>Does following spring data support Phase Two conclusion?<br><br>b) Procedure: Submit governmental documents for approval. Take initial data on land plots. Rate plots on suppression rubric. Take data on variables. Take Final data, record variables, evaluate and record new mite movement. <br><br>c) Data summary: 1) The mites had already exhibited galling effects to the plants inside the designated plot area. 2) 63% less stems on plants infested with mites. 12% difference from growing season 2005 compared to 2006. 3) The infested bindweed stem length measurement is non- conclusive as a physical initial and final measurement could not be obtained due to gall effect exhibited by the Bindweed Gall Mite. 4) 97.2% reduction, average amount of seeds produced per plant annually.5) An 88% reduction of plant count- initial. 100% suppression by fall of 2006.<br><br>d) Conclusions: There was evidence that my hypothesis was supported. The mites returned for the growing season 2006. They galled any Field Bindweed plants that were not suppressed the previous year early, thus limiting their growth and photosynthesis ability. Data was taken from the surrounding plot where newly infested plants were showing early signs of mite presence. The data was compared to phase two data to conclude on the effectiveness of the mite. I conclude that Aceria malherbae will be an effective option for Biological control for Convolvulus arvensis for the state of Colorado.<br><br>

TINT SEEDS PRESENT THE BIG PICTURE FOR EVERGLADES RESTORATION
Nia Kirsten Brisbane
Felix Varela Senior High School, Miami, Florida, United States

The explosive population of south Florida and development has altered the quality, quantity and distribution of water flowing through the Everglades. It is well documented that these changes impact natural communities within the Everglades. This experiment examines the effects of environmental stressors on Cladium in the following hypotheses:<br><br>1. Seed morphology will vary in response to environmental stress.<br><br>2. Seeds size will decrease as nutrients increase.<br><br>3. Seeds will be smaller in areas where annual water level is low.<br><br>4. Seeds will increase in size as salinity increases. <br><br>Soil cores were collected along the Everglades estuarine ecotone and analyzed for a variety of soil and water characteristics. Soil analysis also included collecting sawgrass seeds for use in morphometric analyses for seed length and width under 30X magnification. <br><br>ANOVA indicates that seeds vary in morphology across regions and between sites with varying environmental conditions. Seeds found in drier Cladium marshes are significantly smaller than those found in an adjacent deep water sloughs. An opposite response was found when observing changes in salinity and increased significantly in size as salinity increased. <br><br>A linear regression alnalysis reveals that nutrient concentration demonstrates a trend opposite to the prediction. Increasing phosphorus concentrations lead to an increase in seed length. It is possible that plants at this site may have done so in response to a salinity stress introduced by Shark River Slough. However, a decrease in morphological dimensions can be found when comparing the proportion of seed length to width and phosphorus level.<br><br>

PHOTOTROPISM: THE EFFECT OF 3-METHYLENEOXINDOLE ON SUNFLOWER CURVATURE
Lauren Marie Maloney
Plymouth North High School; Plymouth, MA; USA

The exact physiological causes of phototropism, or stem curvature, are unknown. One theory is that a growth inhibiting substance is synthesized in the unilaterally irradiated side of the plant. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), a plant growth hormone, is responsible for the elongation of cells and may be the precursor of 3-methyleneoxindole (MOI), a potential growth inhibitor. <br><br> It was hypothesized that (1) if IAA is photo-oxidized, then the reaction will yield MOI; (2) if the hypocotyl is capped, then a phototropic response will be eliminated; (3) if MOI is applied to an illuminated stem, then curvature similar to the phototropic response will develop; (4) if MOI is applied to an unilluminated stem, then curvature similar to the phototropic response will develop; (5) if MOI is applied to the stem and the direction of light is changed to the opposite side, then the plant will exhibit a less significant phototropic response.<br><br> In the first part, IAA was dissolved in pH 5.5 buffer, ethanol, and FAD, and then exposed to light. The reaction mixture was analyzed for MOI formation by HPLC at several time intervals. In the second part, sunflower plants were grown hydroponically for eighteen days. Solutions of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), and MOI dissolved in DMSO were applied to various locations on the stems of plants which were either illuminated or unilluminated. <br><br> Upon analysis, the data suggest that all hypotheses were supported with the exception of the fourth. This supports that MOI is a growth inhibitor and may be responsible for the phototropic effect.<br><br>

HOST-BACTERIAL SPECIFICITY DURING LEGUME-RHIZOBIUM SYMBIOSES
Sushant Sundaresh
The Harker School, San Jose, CA, USA

The research examined the control sequence between host plants and nitrogen fixing bacteria and determined whether such bacteria were screened at successive host-regulated checkpoints during the nodulation process. The researcher hypothesized that while host-bacterial symbioses had multiple control doors, Nod factor signaling was the most important checkpoint during legume-Rhizobium symbiosis. <br><br> Over the course of the research, both Rhizobium meliloti, specific to Alfalfa, and NGR 234, specific to Macroptilium, were utilized because of their non-overlapping host-specificity. The researcher empirically mapped the control sequence for nodulation by cross testing all possible combinations of host plants and bacteria and statistically analyzing the nodulation results. <br><br> Each host plant evinced specificity to the Nod factors of its bacteria in naturally occurring symbioses. For example, Alfalfa rejected NGR 234, only allowing R. meliloti to infect its root hairs and nodulate. However, when bacteria were injected directly into the host, the plant’s control system failed to regulate the invading bacteria and allowed nodulation to occur. <br><br> During artificially instigated symbioses, the Nod factor control door was bypassed, disproving the hypothesis that Nod factors determine specificity. By demonstrating that nitrogen fixing bacteria are less host-specific than previously assumed, this research opens up the possibility for a clean, natural nitrogen source for crops that could reduce fertilizer usage and greenhouse gas emissions simultaneously. <br><br>

Batu Lintang Secondary School, Kuching, Sarawak, Malaysia

Compost has been recommended as an alternative fertilizer to increase soil fertility and crop production. This project aims to compare the effect of different compost treatments with chemical fertilizer on growth and yield of Brassica sp. as well as on soil properties. <br><br>The experiments were carried out using containers with loamy soil in 3 replications. The treatments were A (1% of chemical fertilizer), B (10% of household compost +5% Soya waste), C (10% of household compost) and (D 10% household compost + daily watering with compost tea of pepper waste ). The compost was incorporated into the soil prior to planting. Mineral contents of compost tea and samples of soil before and after planting were analyzed. The physical properties of soil samples, the rate of growth as well as the vegetables harvested were recorded and analyzed using one-way ANOVA test. <br><br>The results showed that treatment D not only produced best yield, 227% better yield in terms of total fresh weight harvested per m2 as compared with treatment A, but it also sustained the soil fertility. Treatment B also significantly increased vegetables yield by 139% as compared to treatment A. The soil analysis showed that compost enhances soil pH, organic matter, aerations and mineral contents. Soil fertilized with chemical fertilizer showed a decrease in almost all the macro nutrients, whereas compost maintained most of the soil minerals and still produce good yields. <br><br>The results suggested that innovative application of compost can be an alternate source for chemical fertilizer and long term utilization of compost with compost tea brewed from pepper waste can increase sustainability of soil fertility. <br><br>

AN APPROACH TO CLEAN THE ENVIRONMENT USING ARUNDO DONAX L.
Shireen Dhir
Houston County High School Warner Robins, Georgia, USA

Phytoremediation is a technique used by certain plants to clean up soil and water contaminated with metals and/or organic contaminants such as crude oil and solvents. It is clean, efficient, inexpensive and environmentally non-disruptive; as opposed to processes that require excavation of soil. Giant reed (Arundo donax L.) is a tall, erect, non-food, woody, perennial crop plant. Recently, this plant has been considered for its use in phyto-remediation in particular for Phosphorus uptake. Based on these findings, a laboratory study was conducted with the primary objective of determining the metal uptake capability of this plant. With this objective in mind, I initiated in-vitro tissue regeneration studies using immature inflorescence tissues (as an explant) excised from mature plants growing in the field. Embroygenic calli were exposed on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with 1.5 mg/l of 2,4-Dichorphenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) for 3 weeks in dark. Regular sub culturing of callus was done. Mature somatic embryos were transferred on MS medium for germination into plantlets. In a separate experiment, to investigate the effect of Nickel (Ni) and Phosphorus (P) on tissue growth in Arundo donax, the callus and in-vitro regenerated plantlets as described above were cultured on MS medium containing various levels of Nickel and Phosphorus (1-25 mg/l) for 3 weeks. Both types of tissue eventually tolerated at least 15 mg of Ni and P for more that 3 weeks. I observed plant morphology (plant height, color, leaf segments) and growth (root length and callus fresh weight). Parameters has been optimized to insert Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) DNA into embrogenic calli using microprojectile bomardment for genetic modification purpose. The growth and good adaptability of Arundo donax plant in contaminated soil suggests its great potential in the near future in the area of remediation of polluted soils. <br><br>

This research project is focused of the landscape of the Czech Republic and its ability to absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2)and on possible long-term accumulation in terrestrial ecosystems, hence mitigating the process of global warming. This projet support implementation of Kyoto Protocol in the Czech Republic.<br><br> The experiment was realized at four different experimental ecosystem sites. Forest stand and grassland sites are located in the mountains. Agro-ecosystem and wetland are located in flat area. Eddy - covariance method performs direct measurement of CO2, water vapor concentration and temperature over the vegetation and at the same time the calculation of instantaneous fluxes of CO2 and water vapor. Moreover, soil and stem CO2 efflux measurements were realized gasometric automatic system. Data was collected during the growing season 2006.<br><br> The highest values of Gross Primary Production(GPP)per year has the forest stand (19.2 t C ha-1), then agro-ecosystem (17.2 t C ha-1), grassland ecosystem (16.3 t C ha-1) and wetland (14.1 C ha-1). Net ecosystem production is the result of asimilation and respiration loss. Each ecosystem has different ability to absorb atmospheric caarbon dioxide. The most productive ecosystem was forest stand (absorbed up to 5.3 t C ha-1 per year). Wetland absorb 1.9 t C ha-1 per year. The agro - ecosystem absorbed up to 5.1 t C ha-1 per year, but some part of its production was used in food chain. Grassland had nearly balanced level between asimilation and respiration loss (0.4 t C ha-1 per year).

Today’s society is focused on health and quick fixes. One such quick fix is the highly nutritional superfood, a food packed with high concentrations of vitamins and minerals to help the body fight disease and aging. Determining the best methods to induce nutrition production in plants can help create new and more effective superfoods. This project is meant to increase scientific knowledge of nutrition production and the methods necessary to increase this content in common fruits and vegetables.<br><br> This experiment measured the antioxidant production in spinach under different photoperiod conditions. Plants were germinated under consistent conditions and separated into three different photoperiod groups of twelve, eighteen, and twenty-four hours after three weeks of growth. After two weeks under the different photoperiods, samples were obtained from each plant in each photoperiod, placed in small beakers with distilled water and labeled. Each beaker was placed in a water bath for twenty minutes, cooled, and placed in a centrifuge for one minute. Next, each sample was placed in an individually labeled cuvette and tested with a colorimeter. Data was collected in LoggerPro, compiled, and analyzed.<br><br> This experiment revealed that photoperiod does have an effect on antioxidant production, which supported the hypothesis. A discernable difference between photoperiods was discovered, with twelve hours of light per day allowing for the highest level of antioxidant production with the twenty-four hour group producing the least. This proves that a moderate amount of light and dark per day produces the most antioxidant-rich plants.<br><br>

AN ANALYSIS OF ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS INFLUENCING ANNUAL TREE GROWTH
Richard Daniel Allen, Brady John Clark
Union County High School, Lake Butler, Florida, USA

The purpose of this research was to determine the correlation between the average growth rate of 50 random slash pine trees and the average annual rainfall and groundwater levels in Union County, Florida. The years 1986-2005 were considered. Core samples were taken from random slash pine trees in Union County using an increment borer. Rainfall data was taken from a local rainfall collection site. Ground water data was collected from the Suwannee River Water Management District's groundwater records. It was hypothesized that a correlation level of at least 0.5 would be found indicating a significant correlation. The correlation results varied according to the type of statistical evaluation. The standard correlation between rainfall and annual tree growth indicated a 0.37 coefficient. The Pearson method indicated a 0.16 coefficient. When correlation data was delayed one year, a coefficient of 0.32 was found. Using a three year moving average analysis, a coefficient of 0.46 was found. Using a weighted three-year moving average, the correlation was 0.48. Groundwater correlations were not as high.the standard correlation was 0.298 with a three-year moving average of 0.1. Therefore, results indicate a stronger correlation between precipitation quantities and annual growth than with groundwater levels. The original hypothesis was rejected. It was determined that many other environmental factors outside of rainfall and groundwater levels will affect tree growth. Future studies will seek to correlate growth to competition from nearby trees.

A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE AND CHLOROPHYLL DENSITY OF THE DKG-1 AND WILD TYPE CERATOPTERIS RICHARDII
Sofya V Kalantarova, Natalie Alberman
Forest Hills High School, Forest Hills, New York, USA

Ceratopteris richardii is a model plant belonging to the Parkeriaceae family which is widely used in the research. Wild type and dkg-1 strains of C- Fern are often used in comparisons when studying agricultural photosynthetic capacities. The dkg-1 mutation results in inverse growth patterns compared to the wild type, which is caused by the reduction of needed light for germination. A correlation between the two strains can be made by studying the amount of light needed for adequate growth and germination as well as the duration of growth stages. When chlorophyll densities are analyzed, it can be concluded that the dkg-1 mutant has higher tolerance when exposed to environmental stresses, such as a lack of white light needed to induce germination. Methods such as spectrophotometry and chlorophyll fluorescence are used to determine photosynthetic growth patterns as well as the amount of chlorophyll present. Ultimately, it was determined that the dkg-1 mutant had higher chlorophyll production as exhibited in spectrophotometric and fluorescence readings. This is consistent with the stated hypothesis. In addition the dkg-1 showed significantly more advanced growth than that of the wild type. These findings may lead to further investigations which aid in plant production and mass distribution in agricultural industries.

A STUDY OF PSBA GENE CLONING AND EXPRESSION IN THE LEAVES OF GINKGO SEEDLINGS
Wei Du, Chen-Chen Zhou, Dian Zhang
No.7 High School of Chengdu City, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, P. R. China

Ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba L.), one of the oldest living tree species, is the only living member of the gymnosperms division Ginkgophyta. It is considered a "living fossil", unchanged since the time of the dinosaurs, and seen as one of the wonders of the world. Due to such unique characteristics, it has attracted worldwide interest in biomedical and botanic research. However, there have been limited investigations of Ginkgo biloba at the molecular level. <br><br>The objective of this project is to understand how the chloroplast-encoded photosynthesis genes are expressed in the leaves of Ginkgo seedlings, and whether the nuclei and chloroplast genetic systems participate in a concerted manner in the early phases of Ginkgo biloba seedling growth. For the first time, we applied RT-PCR and 3'- RACE methods to clone a cDNA fragment of the psbA gene, which encodes the protein D1 of photochemical reaction center, from Ginkgo biloba. Protein sequence showed that the Ginkgo D1 protein is identical to D1 protein found in many other plants. Both Western blot and Northern blot were used to analyze the levels of protein and mRNA of psbA and cab genes. Our project results suggest that the thylakoid membrane goes through constant changes and chlorophyll synthesis speeds up during the early phases of leaf growth. The structural and functional status of chloroplast may influence the expression of photosystem II subunits during ginkgo seedling development.<br><br>

INSECTICIDAL ACTIVITY OF OLEANDER LEAF EXTRACT AGAINST DIAMONDBACK MOTH AND IDENTIFICATION OF ITS ACTIVE CONSTITUENT
Liqing Yang, Yuzhou Gu, Zhaoxin Wang
Luwan Senior High School, Shanghai, China

The study is to investigate a common plant in China, oleander, and its effect on diamondback moth(P. Xyloslella). Excessive chem-pesticides spraying leads to pests' insecticide resistance and human's health problems. Our study aims at identification, isolation and purification of insecticidal constituent of oleander leaf and discuss its possibility to be bio-pesticides. In our research, we focused on evident differences in biological activities of the two species of oleanders existed in Shanghai, Nerium indicum Mill(red flowers) and Nerium indicum cv.Paihua(white flowers), to isolate the active component. The insecticidal activity of ethanol extract from the 2 kinds of oleanders against the moth was tested. Our results indicated only Nerium indicum Mill. leaf extract has potent repellent and contact-kill activity. Then, the ethanol extract was separated via various solvents. The active constituent was found dissolved in ethyl acetate. Thin-layer chromatography (silica gel TLC), via a comparison for the 2 species oleanders' results, shown the component located at zone of Rf= 0.75, which was fluorescent under UV. We utilized high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to further purify the active component. The LC combined mass spectrometry (LC-MS) determined constituent's molecular weight is 576D. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) demonstrated the molecular formula is C32H48O9. The mechanisms related to neurotoxic effect were also evaluated via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of AchE. Finally the research institution evaluated its toxicity to mice, indicated it safe to vertebrate under the efficient pest-killing concentration of 94.2µg/10g.The result shows the active component of oleander leaves has a potential of becoming a novel class of bio-pesticides which is propitious to environmental protection. Future studies will focus on its long-term effect on eco-system, and its killing activity for other pests such as cabbage caterpillars.

DOES SALINITY MATTER?
Tina Natasha Alisa Wattley, Zahra Imani Jackson
The Good Hope School, Frederiksted, St. Croix, United States Virgin Islands

Mangroves species are native plants on St. Croix and many of them have been wiped out because of natural, but hazardous hurricanes. This project will be comparing the distance from shore and the salinity of the soil of mangroves (commencing at shore) to see what amount of salt will be needed to healthily restore dying mangroves. The hypothesis for this project is: the closer to shore a mangrove is, the more salt the soil around its roots would contain. Those mangroves close to shore will be more flourishing. This hypothesis is based on the continual flow of salt water located at the roots where mangroves take root. There is also a possibility that there would be more salinity present farther away from shore due to water evaporation and settled salt. The results for this experiment are that the salinity of mangroves tends to drop as the distance form the shore increases. The species of mangroves farther away from shore have adapted and survive better with less salt around their roots. Given the reason that mangroves have adapted to extract fresh water from salt water, further studies would be to construct an experiment testing to see if all types of mangroves can survive in water where they don’t have to extract fresh water.

AN ANALYSIS OF PLANTS USED BY AMERICAN INDIANS FOR ANTIMICROBIAL EFFECTIVENESS, A SECOND YEAR STUDY
Shana Marie Wolff, Elizabeth J. Cochran
Cheyenne Central High School, Cheyenne, Wyoming, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to examine the effectiveness in the laboratory of Plains American Indian plant remedies traditionally used as topical antiseptics to prevent or treat infections of the skin. Our hypothesis is that some of these plants will display significant antimicrobial activity in the laboratory, in vitro.<br><br> In this study we used 32 different medicinal plants that Plains American Indians used as antiseptics found growing in Cheyenne, Wyoming in fall of 2005 and spring of 2006. We extracted each of these plant juices and filter sterilized each using a 0.22 um Millipore filter to remove contaminating bacteria. The plant extracts were tested against 9 different bacteria and 1 yeast. After incubation, the plates were examined and any zones of bacterial inhibition we observed were measured. These zones of inhibition would indicate antimicrobial activity of the plant extracts. The chemical nature of the effective plant extract was determined to be a protein in some plants, and an oily resin in other plants. Additionally, a study examining the effectiveness of yucca root as a soap was conducted.<br><br> From this series of experiments we concluded that 47% of the native plants isolated from Cheyenne, Wyoming that were historically used by Plains American Indians did exhibit some antimicrobial properties in vitro. We can assume most of the plants would kill or inhibit bacteria just as effectively in vivo, and would prevent and treat infections of the skin and mucous membranes. <br><br>

PHYTOREMEDIATION
Annicka Kae Carter, Ellie Antonia Vawdrey
Hillcrest High School, Midvale, Utah, United States

Phytoremediation is the unassisted hyper-accumulation that absorbs and degrades organic contaminants.<br><br> We took four species, Blue Oat Grass, Chrysanthemum, Coreopsis, and Lavender, to find which would best hyper-accumulate the contaminants from the Gardner Village pond water naturally, without having its growth impaired? Gardner Village has had a problem with plant health, due to their source of water. Gardner Village for many years has used an irrigation system that originates from an underground spring. We believed that the Coreopsis would hyper accumulate the elements the most affectively because of its capabilities to handle dry climates/soils. To test our problem, we took 64 plants that were watered and observed for one month. Before and after we began growing the plants we had them tested to find the element amounts that were in the biomass of each plant.<br><br> The first set of data we produced was the plants health/vigor. The second set of information produced, were the graphs of individual graphs and how each plant reacted in terms of hyper-accumulation.<br><br> We found that the elements in our plants were at very high levels. Every nutrient that was measured in our plants was over the optimal level thus making them harmful to the plants. <br><br> After analyzing our graphs, we concluded that overall the Blue Oat Grass most efficiently hyper-accumulated the elements while still staying healthy. However, absorption rates were not significant enough for hyper-accumulation to completely justify the results. Alternate methods of Phytoremediation were found that more accurately described the data that we received from our tests.<br><br>

Escola Secundária de Odemira, Odemira, Portugal

Cork tree (Quercus suber) and holm oak (Quercus rotundifolia) stands are a unique and precious ecosystem.They are an indispensable economic resource. A disease called the decline of cork tree and holm oak stands has been threatening these ecosystems. However, the reason why these trees dry out is yet to be explained. Although some researchers have put forward a hypothesis that relates this disease to the presence of a fungus, Phytophthora cinnamomi; others still refute it.<br><br> In lab, we cultivated the fungus, which was isolated from sick trees. Then we infested soil with P.cinnamomi and had 120 cork tree seeds and 120 holm oak seeds germinating there. We compared them with the same number of seeds germinating in desinfested soil under the same environmental conditions. Seeds in infested soil showed lower velocity and germination rate, and the young plant root condition was also clearly worst from the control plants. <br><br> Then we inoculated healthy cork trees and holm oaks with the fungus too. Under controlled conditions we compared the development of these trees with others which were growing under the same conditions, but hadn’t been infested. The roots and the crown of the plants were periodically assessed and the isolation procedure of P. cinnamomi is made from the roots of all lots trees. P.cinnamomi causes “root rot” of cork tree and holm oak and symptoms of decline in crown of this trees. This results are independent of environmental conditions, like water regimen.<br><br> So, it seems that P.cinnamomi really causes the decline of cork tree and holm oak stands. <br><br>

STAY AWAY FROM MY TERRITORY!!! THE EFFECT OF EUCALYPTUS LEUCOXYLON 'ROSEA' ON THE GROWTH OF RADISHES
Elaine Quinne Trinh, Hong Huynh
Silver Creek High School, San Jose, California

Eucalyptus is a prolific litter producer, prone to dropping leaves and barks, and Eucalyptus trees rarely have an understory. If allelochemicals are released from Eucalyptus litter, their accumulation in the soil could result in poor vegetation by other flora even after the trees have been removed for restoration projects. Since Eucalyptus spp. shed bark, leaves, and pods it is hypothesized that all of these plant parts will inhibit plant germination and growth. <br><br> To investigate this question, both pulverized powder and water extracts of Eucalyptus leucoxylon were used to investigate their effects on germination and seedling growth of Raphanus sativus. Samples of leaves, bark, pods, and soil from under the canopy were gathered from local Eucalyptus trees. Dried plant samples were extracted by soaking (24 hours) at R.T., boiling (5 minutes) or pulverized into fine powder. Pots were filled with potting soil (52.52g each) and one radish seed. For the first experiment, we compared leaves and bark prepared three different ways with five pots per experimental group. The experiment was repeated with the second batch of components: soil, pods, and a mixture of all four components. Everyday the plants were kept in an incubator, exposed to light for 8 hours, and watered with 10ml of extracted sample or pulverized powder.<br><br> All plant extracts and soil delayed germination and had an inhibiting effect on radish plant height. The greatest effect was seen with bark: followed by the mixture, soil, pods, and leaves with decreasing effect. The trials on average showed that crushed bark and soil were the most effective inhibitors relative to the control. This outcome is reasonable knowing the trait of Eucalyptus to excessively shed bark. It is reasonable to conclude from the data that Eucalyptus extracts in their natural form (pulverized) were most effective and that the effective agent(s) is water soluble.<br><br>

CULTURE OF LICHEN-FORMING FUNGI ISOLATED FROM KOREAN LICHENS
Hwayeong Mun, Kim Namhun
Chonnam Science Highschool, Naju city, Chollanamdo, South Korea

Lichen is the organism which is a combination of alga and fungus. It has been used in many countries as traditional folk medicines. Lichenized fungi are well known to contain several unique substances which are of potential for antibiotic and anticancer therapy. It is worthy of developing lichen substances as novel drugs to solve the current problems of antibiotics such as multi-drug resistance. <br><br> However there are many problems to extract these useful substances from lichen thalli. Unlike higher plants and mushroom, lichen grows very slowly in nature and cannot be cultivated under controlled environments until now. Instead of lichen thalli, culture of lichenized fungi have a great advantage for the purpose. In this study, we attempted to isolate lichen-forming fungi from lichen thalli and cultivate them to produce lichen substances in a large scale for practical use. <br><br> We tried to isolate lichen-forming fungus and symbiotic algae from lichen thalli by tissue culture method. To confirm lichen-forming fungi among the isolates obtained, we analyzed and compared ITS DNA sequences of the isolates with those of the original lichenized fungi. We investigated optimal cultural conditions of the lichen-forming fungi such as pH, carbon source and nitrogen source, which can fundamentally influence the growth rate and lichen substances produced by them.<br><br> We successfully isolated 6 different lichen-forming fungi and 8 symbiotic algae (mostly Trebouxia genus) from 9 lichen species. These separated fungi have been well preserved and cultivated in the laboratory conditions for a long term. For a large scale cultivation, appropriate pH was found to be 6 and the isolate were well grown in the malt-yeast-extract medium with Ribitol 1% as an additional carbon source. This results suggested that it could be possible to produce the lichen substance having a great potential of novel drugs in a large scale by culturing lichen-forming fungi under the controlled environments.<br><br>

COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE AVERAGE HEIGHT OF PINUS CARIBAEA VAR. HONDURENSIS IN CAYEY, PR., AND OTHER ADJACENT TOWNS
Krystal M. Santiago-Ramirez, Paolis Miranda-Centeno
Dr. Ramon Emeterio Betances School , Cayey, Puerto Rico

The purpose of this research was to compare the height of Pinus caribaea var. hondurensis in Cayey,PR., with the same kind of pine trees in adjacent towns. Honduras pine tree is the best wood producer over a wide range of sites below 2700ft (818 m) and was planted in Puerto Rico in the early 1960´s. Some observations in Carite Forest led to suspect that these pine trees grow taller in Cayey than in other towns, such as Aibonito, Caguas, Cidra and Guayama. To prove this hypothesis, it was necessary to find the average height of an aleatory sample of 25 pine trees per town.<br><br> The height of each tree was determined by a mathematical method using a clinometer, a compass, a metric ribbon and a GPS. The height was measured by an observer using a clinometer and finding a 45º angle from her eye to the tree crown. Measuring the distance from the observer to the tree and the observer’s height, it was possible to determine the tree height.<br><br> It was found that in the town of Guayama, the average height of the pine trees was greater than that of the pine trees of the other towns. A t–test for α=0.6 showed that there were no significant differences between the height of Cayey and Guayama trees, but there were significant differences between Cayey and Guayama trees and those of the other towns. A correlation study between the tree height and the sea level proved to be negative. <br><br>

HOW DOES SMOKE AFFECT SEED GERMINATION?
Leslie Van Gerpen, Hilary Van Gerpen
Avon Public School, Avon, SD, United States

Fire has always played an important ecological role in maintaining natural prairies. However, in recent years several studies have shown smoke generated by the burning plant material may release compounds that can promote seed germination. Our project applies this knowledge to agriculture in the Great Plains of North America.<br><br><br> Since prairie plants may have evolved in response to prairie fires, we first obtained four species of native grass seeds from a supply source: Big Bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), Little Bluestem (Schizachyrium scorparium), Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), and Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). Smoke was generated by burning grass hay containing intermediate wheat grass. Seeds were treated with both smoke and a mixture of smoke water. The number of seeds that germinated out of 100 was counted over a two-week period. Three of the four grass species outperformed their control groups according to the binomial distribution and one grass species was highly significant, namely switchgrass. Since these prairie grasses are monocots, we repeated the experiment on cultivated monocots: wheat, corn, and oats. No difference was found in the germination of these seeds. <br><br><br> Recently, President Bush announced a goal for 30% of our transportation fuels to come from cellulosic ethanol by 2030. Switchgrass is being investigated as a possible source of this cellulose. Increasing the rates and amount of germination in switchgrass might allow it to replace corn as a raw material for ethanol. Research is ongoing to see if we can apply the results of this experiment into practical solutions for farmers. <br><br>

A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE GENETIC VARIATION BETWEEN GLOBALLY DISTRIBUTED POPULATIONS OF THE GENUS RAPHANUS (RADISH)
Laurie Frances Kenyon, Briana Marie Tucker
Kalamazoo Area Mathematics and Science Center, Kalamazoo, Michigan, U.S.A.

Through the study of the genus Raphanus, commonly known as radishes, patterns of gene flow and genetic variation can be discussed. There are two different species within the genus, raphanistrum and sativus. Within R. raphanistrum, the weedy radish species, there are three different subspecies: raphanistrum, landra, and maritimus. The investigation included these subspecies as well as R. sativus.<br><br> In order to determine the genetic variation between the four different groups in question, it was required for the FST values to be calculated. The experiment used ninety-six different samples among the populations. At presumptively neutral loci, the extracted DNA was duplicated through a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) utilizing eight microsatellite markers. Through electrophoresis, the genetic markers allowed the specific DNA sites to be located on a scan of the acrylamide gel. We were able to determine the FST values for the samples and from this, discuss any genetic variation and gene flow. <br><br> From the results, it can be determined that those populations among the R. r. raphanistrum had very little differentiation, while the other subspecies and species had much greater variation. This suggests that although the populations are located over three continents, there was little adaptation, and distance does not have a significant impact on gene flow within this genus.<br><br>

THE SECRET IN MIMOSA'S LEAF FOLDING PATTERN
Natnaree Siriwon, Korawich Niyomsatian, Nathaphon Supokaivanich
Triam Udom Suksa, Bangkok, Thailand

Our research has presented the idea of multi patterns of Mimosa’s (Mimosa pudica L.) leaf movement when excited by particular mechanical stimuli: touch, wound and heat. To stimulate with touch, we used starch droplets (2.5 g starch/ 100 ml water) as a mechanical stimulus and controlled the force by varying height at which starch droplets were released. Volume and mass of the droplets were controlled by a plastic tube containing starch solution. The experiments were carried out between 2:00-4:00 pm in a laboratory. We measured the velocity of leaf movement and found that it folded faster when the force is increasing. The speed was fastest when stimulated at tip of leaf. Leaf folding, stimulated by wounding and heating, was faster than the folding, caused by touch, and took longer time for the recovery. Wounding and heating caused sequential folding of leaflets outwardly from stimulated point. In contrast, touch caused two patterns of leaf folding: sequential and simultaneous folding of leaflets. Sequential pattern happens when stimulate Mimosa with low magnitude of force, and simultaneous pattern happens when stimulate Mimosa with high magnitude of force. As an extension, we studied the possibility of using Mimosa as an earthquake sensor, to sense the magnitude of earthquake and direction of epicenter.<br><br>

ASCORBIC ACIDS' ROLE IN PROTECTING SPINACIA OLERACEA CHLOROPLASTS FROM SULFURIC ACID
Branden Lee Anglin
James W. Mitchell High School, New Port Richey, FL

This project was conducted in order to determine whether or not ascorbic acid could successfully create a buffer system within the chloroplasts of plant cells, thus protecting them from the harmful affects of acid rain. Evidence was collected which supported the unlikely claim that a weak acid could protect a chloroplast from the harmful affects of a strong acid.<br><br>To determine this, chloroplasts were exposed to varying molar solutions of ascorbic acid, and then blended into a chloroplast suspension solution. This suspension was then exposed to a .1 M solution of sulfuric acid. These chloroplasts were then added to a cuvette filled with distilled water, a phosphate buffer and the chemical DPIP. The consequent change in the percent transmittance was then measured over a period of fifteen minutes.<br><br>Overall, it was determined that ascorbic acid was able to successfully protect these chloroplasts from the sulfuric acid solution. In some cases, however, the ascorbic acid reacted with the DPIP, thus leading to an extremely high percent transmittance on all trials. Even with the high percent transmittance, there was still evidence of a greater rate of photosynthesis in those chloroplasts exposed to ascorbic acid than in those which were present in the control.<br><br>This experiment proves that there may be more to protecting plants than just reducing the amount of pollution. Mainly, this experiment demonstrates how plants may be more resourceful than originally thought, and warrants further experimentation on the subject of plant immunity.

THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION ON THE GROWTH OF CARROTS
Jonathan Edward Searle
Shore School, Sydney, NSW, AUSTRALIA

This experiment aimed to provide evidence for the hypothesis that exposure to some types of electromagnetic radiation would increase the growth of carrots. Length, mass and the rate of germination were the dependant variables measured. There was one control group and five groups treated with Gamma Rays, Microwaves, Infrared Rays, Ultraviolet Rays and X-Rays respectively. Over an eight week testing period, the plants exposed to Ultraviolet Radiation germinated at the highest rate and increased most in both mass and length. At the end of the experiment, the plants from seeds exposed to Ultraviolet radiation were on average 34% heavier, 33% longer and produced an extra seedling compared to the control group. The results, based on a limited sample, provide some evidence to support the hypothesis and suggest that a more significant experiment using a much larger sample size might be warranted. Overall there was a general trend in growth of the carrots according to the increasing energy (or frequency) of the radiation. In addition, the initial experiment demonstrated that the characteristics of Microwaves and Infrared (possibly heat) stunted and also stopped some seeds from germinating.

EXAMINATION OF DEFENSIVE ODOURS OF SOME MINT FAMILY PLANTS
Marton Spohn
Fazekas Mihaly Secondary Grammar School, Budapest, HUNGARY

In a Biologist Camp in summer 2006, I took notice of a plant, common motherwort (Leonurus cardiaca) to emit a very offensive odour when teared off. Beneath the obvious conclusion that this is a defense against pests - insects, ect. - I was interested about how it works. I browsed relevant scientific articles and found that despite of being such a distinctive defense response, only the chemicals indirectly responsible - premarrubiin and related diterpenoids - were identified, and the mechanism how they take effect remained uncleared. I aimed my project to discover the biochemical background of this phenomenon.<br><br><br>Through experiments, I first isolated and identified premarrubiin and its derivates. Then to simulate general wounding caused plant stress conditions - as appearance of acidic stress factors -, I exposed samples to a drop in environment pH. I evaluated the experiments by thin layer chromatography and UV-spectrophotometry. After discovering a loss of observed compounds in a simple conversion, I made molecule modell calculations to find an alternative conversion product. I found a new reaction pathway, trough which the heavy and chemically inactive premarrubiin is converted to a novel product - identified as isomarrubiin - which can enter into general cleavage enzyme pathways leading to smaller, easily evaporable compounds that form the defensive odour.<br><br><br>I compared my results to scientific information about diterpenoid production of plants, and set up a theory that can explain how defensive compounds are slowly accumulated, but relased rapidly in case of an attack. By discovering more details, environment-friendly pesticides may be developed.

Gymnazium F.X.Saldy, Liberec 11, CZECH REPUBLIC

I focused my work on fungus Entoloma clypeatum because, as Hungarian mycologist have shown, it helps fruit trees to have greener foliage, higher yields and less tree decay. <br><br>The mycelium of Entoloma clypeatum was cultivated in media with different concentration of tested components or pH. Then the diameter of the colony was measured and compared. <br><br>A chemically definable medium has been developed.<br><br>Concerning humic acids Entoloma clypeatum grew best on the media with fulvic acids. Among vitamins thiamine doesn´t stimulate the fungus while riboflavine does. As for sugars the fungus created the biggest quantity of biomass on the medium containing cellobiose, the mycelium formed the largest colonies on the medium containing sucrose.<br><br>The fungicides take very different effects on Entoloma clypeatum. Benomyl and Ridomil plus hamper it strongly, Fundazol less and Karben Flo and Sumilex 50WP don´t hamper it at all. The fungus benefits from a moderate concentration of NaCl (10 mM and 30 mM), however, excessive concentration of NaCl (300 mM) makes it impossible. For Entoloma clypeatum weakly acid medium is optimal. The fungus is not able to inhibit the growth of Agrobacterium. <br><br>Effects of matters important for nutrition, NaCl, fungicides, Agrobacterium and pH were explored.

The Villages Charter High School, The Villages, FL

My purpose for this project is to see if the plant Spinacea oleracea absorbs the bacteria Escherichia coli and to determine if a UV- germicidal lamp will elminate the bacteria in the Spinacea oleracea leaves and stems.<br><br>For test 1, first, collect seeds needed for the project and plant 3 sets of 3 seeds in sterile soil (groups A-C) and 3 seeds into E. coli 25922 contaminated soil (group D). Next, water groups A & D with sterile water and groups B & C with E. coli 25922 contaminated water. Place in a biohazard safe environment and continue watering for approximately 30 days. After 30 days, harvest the leaves and stems of each group. Treat half of group D with a UV-germicidal lamp. Next, macerate leaves until very fine in seperate sterile tissue grinders. For each group, inoculate two plates (blood agar & MacConkey agar) with a 1 µL loop. Place plates into a 37ºC incubator for 48 hrs. Read plates and determine if any bacteria are E. coli; perform a gram stain and/or identification. For test 2, collect mature spinach leaves and stems. Wash thoroughly with a 2% bleach solution. Next, fill two sterile specimen cups with sterile water; add E. coli 25922 to one of the cups. Soak spinach leaves and stems in these solutions for 24 hrs. Next, clean spinach from both containers with a 2% bleach solution. Macerate leaves in sterile tissue grinders. Inoculate two agar plates with a 1 µL loop. Place plates into a 37ºC incubator for 48 hrs. REad plates and determine if any bacteria are E. coli, perform a gram stain and/or identification.<br><br>The group that absorbed the most bacteria was watered with E. coli contaminated water on both the leaves and soil, but there was no E. coli recovered from the culture. In test 2, the spinach did take up the E. coli into the leaves and stems. Also, a bacterium known as Pantoea agglomerans was found on all of the agar plates, including the control groups. The conclusion for this project is that the Spinacea oleracea does absorb the Escherichia coli into its xylem and leavse but not until it is a mature plant. And the UV light did decrease the number of bacteria.

CHARACTERIZATION OF ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA GENE AT4G28560
Joanne Chou
Lake Brantley High School, Altamonte Springs, FL

Arabidopsis Thaliana is a small, flowering plant that is primarily used as a model organism in plant biology due to its rapid life cycle, small genome sequence, and numerous mutant lines available for research. The purpose of this project was to classify the Gene AT4G28560 phenotypically and genotypically in Arabidopsis Thaliana. Prior to experimentation, it was hypothesized that the gene would alter the plant’s phenotype resulting in characteristic differences in the plant’s height, shape, or stomatal pattern, which would also lead to genotypical differences. <br><br> <br><br>Three types of seeds were used: Columbia GL1, tmm-1, and the mutant AT4G28560. The GL1 and AT4G28560 were planted in plant dishes to compare root growth. All three seeds were grown in soil to then compare the mature plant’s phenotypical differences. The mutant plant containing the AT4G28560 gene was then double breeded and ran through PCR to amplify the DNA. It could then be put through electrophoresis to compare genotypical traits with TMM and Columbia GL1.<br><br>As a result, there were distinct differences among the mutant plants phenotypical and genotypical characteristics. Not only did AT4G28560 have lengthier and healthier roots than the Columbia wild type, but it also exhibited stomatal clusters (similar to TMM), a faster growth rate, and a similar genotype to that of TMM. This project can further the understanding of genetics and molecular biology in today’s society.

PRODUCING GENETICALLY ENGINEERED GRAPEVINES HARBORING MULTIPLE TRANSGENES
Bradley Charles Clement
Lake Brantley High School, Altamonte Springs, FL

The purpose of the experiment was to determine if inserting multiple transgenes into grapevine using co-transformation is as effective as, or comparably preferable to, inserting a single transgene. The implication of the project is incorporating four transgenes into a plant to give it a higher disease/weather resistance to create a more ideal plant. The two constructs used were pLC 403e (eGFP plus HPT II) and pBI 434 (GUS/NPTII fusion gene), with GFP and GUS acting as marker genes. The experiment started with co-cultivation of somatic embryogenic cultures using argobacterium as a vector for the co-transformation of the constructs. After washing the somatic embryos (SE) with antibiotics to kill the argobacterium after 3 days, the SE were transferred to DMcck medium to culture for 30 days. Recorded number of SE lines produced and ones that express GFP fluorescence. Then transferred to X6cck medium for SE development, after sufficient embryogenic cultures generated for each SE line, tested SE for GUS expression and recorded amount. Once SE lines had matured enough for stable expression to take place, molecular analysis was conducted by PCR to confirm the presence of the transgenes. While the transformation frequency between the two, 8.84% for co-transformation compared to 15.19% for single transformation, is visibly different, the statistical analysis (p-value of 0.020) clearly shows that the frequency of somatic embryos that were co-transformed was no less effective when using the mark of a 6% mean to be labeled as being effective. The P-value verifies the statistical significance of the co-transformation results, as any P-value under 0.05 meets this designation.

NO PLACE TO HIDE: MIXED NODULES MAY NOT BE A REFUGE FOR NON-FIXING BRADYRHIZOBIUM MUTANTS
Kyra Gene Underbakke
Maranatha Christian Academy, Brooklyn Park, MN

In rhizobium-legume symbiosis, rhizobia cooperate with the legume by fixing nitrogen for the plant’s use. Fixing nitrogen is energetically costly, and non-fixing (cheating) mutants use this energy selfishly, gaining a fitness advantage relative to nitrogen-fixing cooperators. Host sanctions reduce the flow of energy to nodules containing only cheaters, benefiting cooperators. However, if both cooperators and cheaters inhabit a single nodule, cheaters may receive energy without triggering sanctions. I aim to determine if mixed nodules are a refuge for cheating rhizobia. I hypothesize that cheating rhizobia obtain more resources than cooperators inside a mixed nodule, facilitating greater reproduction and survival in the rhizosphere after nodule senescence.<br><br> Host plants were inoculated with a high nitrogen-fixing rhizobium genotype and a non-fixing mutant. High- and low-frequencies of mixed nodules were experimentally induced. After four weeks, nodules were harvested, and separate pots of soil were inoculated with rhizobia from each plant. These pots were incubated for six weeks to allow rhizobia to use stored energy for growth. To determine strain frequencies in the soil, another generation of host plants was planted. Nodule occupancy was determined by antibiotic resistance. The ratio of cooperator to cheater strains inside the nodules was used as a proxy for the ratio of these strains in the soil.<br><br> In contrast to widely-held expectations, when mixed nodules were frequent cheating rhizobia occupied a significantly smaller fraction of the rhizosphere (21%) than when mixed nodules were rare (72%). Mixed nodules alone may not explain the evolutionary persistence of cheating rhizobia.

MONITORING AND PREVENTING PLANT INVASIONS IN AN URBAN ECOSYSTEM: A CASE STUDY OF ZHYTOMYR, UKRAINE
Daria O. Chaika
Secondary School No. 28, Zhytomyr, Zhytomyr Region, UKRAINE

Invasions of alien species are global threats to biodiversity and human well-being. This issue is important for Ukraine, the second largest European country. I used Zhytomyr (130 km SW of Kiev) as a model city for analysis of most important invasive species, initial immigration zones, and migration corridors. Limited data on distribution of invasive plants and their participation in natural and altered plant communities in many regions of Ukraine do not allow their effective control. In this situation the role of students can be important, especially in revealing initial stages of invasions (which are often overlooked), mapping, and transmission of data to professionals (conservation, agriculture, forestry etc.).<br><br>I analyzed 24 species of alien plants, discovered many new localities in Zhytomyr (most important specimens submitted to KW National Herbarium), mapped populations by GPS, described plant communities, vital strategies and degree of naturalization, and evaluated harmfulness. I conclude that cities are among main pathways for plant invasions, and how in Zhytomyr the most invasive are species of North American origin (71% of species investigated), including Ambrosia artemisiifolia, Cuscuta campestris, and Sicyos angulatus. Other American species are also important due to their high naturalization ability and participation in fen communities: Symphyotrichum (Aster) lanceolatum, S. novae-angliae etc. Obtained data were disseminated in Zhytomyr schools, Environmental Department, Phytosanitary Inspection, and mass media. My research can become a model for similar student projects throughout Ukraine and adjacent countries, which will help professionals in monitoring and combating plant invasions.

NATURAL REAGENTS

In daily life we use artificial and chemical dyes to stain cells and to distinguish between them. These dyes are harmful to many cells thus leading to false results. <br><br> Therefore our goal was to extract dyes from commonly used plants such as Henna, Hibiscus, Turmeric and Roses to replace harmful chemical dyes.<br><br> The dyes were prepared by soaking the plants in hot water for 30 minutes, filtrated by Whatman® filter; then the filtrate was lyophilized and reconstituted with distilled water in 1g/ml concentration. Dialysis was carried out against PBS buffer to provide isotonicity to the dye. The samples were labeled and stored in the freezer. <br><br> Viability test has been made on mammalian cells cultured in vitro to distinguish dead from viable cells, and we replaced commonly used Trypan Blue dye with Henna and Hibiscus dye, which gave very close results. Cells counted immediately after dying with Trypan Blue were found 168, whereas the cells dyed with Henna were 159. After 15 minutes the cells were recounted and the first samples had decreased by 45, the other samples by 15 cells only.<br><br> Another test was carried out on bacteria cells (gram positive and negative) by staining heat fixed slides with Henna, Hibiscus, and Roses dyes for 20 minutes. Natural dyes give similar results to methylene blue dye (positive control) and distinguish the outer morphology of the cells. <br><br>Therefore the following could be observed:<br><br>1) Natural dyes can be used safely instead of commonly used dyes, Henna extract can be used instead of Trypan Blue dye.<br><br>2) It can be used on cells, bacteria and sperm cells with less negative effect.

INCREASING LIGHT UTILIZATION EFFICIENCY WITH CHLAMYDOMONAS REINHARDTII (TLA1) TRANSFORMANT
John Wyatt Walls
South Pemiscot High School, Steele, MO

Hydrogen gas has been considered a serious alternative fuel source with the recent rise in oil prices. Discoveries of microorganisms with the ability to produce this hydrogen gas have shed new light on possible ways to solve the energy crisis. Green algae are one of these microorganisms with the ability to produce hydrogen when sulfur and oxygen are depleted in the media. The species of green algae known as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been genetically modified (Melis) to increase efficiency of hydrogen production. The modified strain, cc4169 and cc4170 of algae, known as tla1, has a truncated light-harvesting chlorophyll antenna size, allowing light to pass deeper into the culture and the energy to be better utilized in the cell. Using the modified strain the hydrogen and oxygen production was compared to that of the wild type, cc125. The liquid cultures were grown in photobioreactors at 22°C under continuous fluorescent light. Cells were grown in TAP solution (Tris-acetate-Phosphate; Harris 1989)until the cultures reached the appropriate cell density. Cultures were grown in TAP solution with sulfur and without sulfur. Previous research has shown that this algae contains hydrogenase which activates when the algae is deprived of sulfur and oxygen. Chlorophyll a/b was measured with a spectrophotometer (Porra). The photosynthetic activity was measured by the degree of reduction of DCPIP (Dichlorophenol indophenol) dye determined by measuring the change in absorbance of light. Oxygen and hydrogen production in mass cultures was measured with Vernier and Qubit sensors. The results indicate the smaller chlorophyll antenna size of the tla1 mutant had higher photosynthetic productivity than the wild type. The mutant also showed a higher light intensity for the saturation of photosynthesis and higher light conversion efficiency.

WILL AVAIL PREVAIL?
Scott Lane Aden
Eustis-Farnam High School, Eustis, NE

The purpose of this experiment was to determine if Avail increased yield in corn economically. After research on phosphorus and its properties in the soil, it was hypothesized that Avail would increase yield in corn economically.<br><br>The researcher planted 86 acres of Pioneer 34N43 corn at a rate of 30,000 seeds per acre. Forty-three acres were fertilized with Avail at a rate of .08 Liters per acre. The other forty-three acres were not fertilized with Avail. Both plots were in the same field and therefore followed the same irrigation schedule, were sprayed with the same pesticides, and received equal amounts of fertilizer at planting time and throughout the year. At harvest time a yield monitor in the combine calculated the yield of each plot.<br><br>After harvest the yield from the combine monitor was recorded and a graph was made. Plot one, where the Avail was applied, yielded 207 bushels per acre. Plot 2 contained no Avail and yielded 193 bushels per acre.<br><br>Plot 1, which contained the Avail, yielded more per acre than the control (plot 2). Plot 1 yielded 14 more bushels per acre than plot 2. This was a total of 602 bushels difference. The average corn price during this experiment was $3.25 per bushel. The price for the Avail was $9 per acre. Therefore a profit of $36.50 more per acre was made on plot one. It was concluded that Avail does increase yield in corn economically.

TISSUE CULTURE OF HAWAIIAN TARO (COLOCASIA ESCULENTA) INCLUDING EVALUATION FOR DSMV (DASHEEN MOSAIC VIRUS)
Chad Masaharu Higa
Waiakea High School, Hilo, HI

Scientific reports have suggested that DsMV does in fact reduce corm size in Hawaiian Taro (Colocasia esculenta) and as a result, impacts agricultural production numbers. Reducing the adverse effects of DsMV by analyzing viral resistance in specific varieties can increase agricultural production and revenue. In the first year study, an ELISA was performed to verify the presence of DsMV within the specimens. In the second year study, an in-vitro tissue culturing process involving Murashige and Skoog (MS) media was conducted on C. esculenta samples. Tissue samples were taken from the petiole/meristem of each original specimen and were monitored for growth and contamination. An analysis between the ELISA and the in-vitro tissue culture were made to investigate the following factors: 1.) Validate viral resistance of different varieties of C. esculenta; 2.) Identify certain varieties of C. esculenta which thrive in culture; 3). Investigate the use of previously known infected samples for culturing and its effect on new growth patterns; 4). To determine the feasibility of utilizing tissue culturing as a means to purify the specimen from DsMV. The Mana and Lauloa Groups were observed to have a degree of resistance to DsMV. Certain varieties were shown to culture better, even in the presence of extremely high concentrations of DsMV from the original specimen. This was observed in the Piko and Eleele Groups. The detrimental factors of DsMV toward culturing are still under observation. Culturing to eliminate DsMV from the specimens proved to be difficult, and was not shown to be effective in this study.

COLD CORN AND BITTER RAIN: THE PH FACTOR
Elizabeth Marie Smoake
Socorro High School, Socorro, NM

The purpose of this experiment is to determine whether the pH of the water used to germinate seeds will affect the rate of germination in a cool environment.<br><br> To complete the experimental phase, determine the pH of the local ground water. Create water with different pHs – three above and three below. Place paper towels and 25 seeds in the bottom of 14 boxes. Add one pH to two boxes and mark the pH of the water used. Repeat until all 14 boxes are watered, with two boxes of each pH. Place one set of germination boxes in a room with temperatures of 50-55 degrees and the other set in a room with the temperatures of 60-65 degrees. <br><br> Record temperatures daily and check for germination in each box. A seed is germinated when a root has sprouted. Record data for 15 days.<br><br> Although I began this experiment with the intention of collecting data on the percentage of germination with differed pHs, there were definitely more things that were of interest. In regard to percent germination, the basic water allowed a higher overall percent of germination than the acidic water. On a totally different note, even though the seeds at the higher temperature germinated with greater speed, the seeds at the lower temperature still had a high percent of germination. Another thing that caught my attention was that the unchanged ground water seemed to have the one of the slowest rates of germination, which would make the seeds more vulnerable to fungi.

THE SEARCH FOR GENETIC LINKS TO ALUMINUM TOLERANCE IN VARIOUS VARIETIES OF TRITICUM AESTIVUM L. BY USE OF THE HEMATOXLYIN STAINING METHOD, A FOUR YEAR STUDY
Stacey Lee Vosters
North Daviess High School, Elnora, IN

This project in its present form tests 103 varieties of Triticum aestivum for their tolerance to Al+3 by use of the hematoxlyin staining method. Aluminum toxicity is the most common growth-limiting and yield reducing factor for wheat in acidic soils. Aluminum is naturally occurring, but amounts can be increased by farming practices and pollution. <br><br> The hematoxylin staining method was used to determine the tolerance to aluminum. The 103 varieties were germinated for 49 hours before being placed into a nutrient solution. After 55 hours, the seedlings where moved into an aluminum solution with a concentration of .0027grams/mL or [.1 m] of aluminum. After 17 hours, the seedlings where stained using a hematoxylin stain which bound with the aluminum ions. The seedlings were placed back into the nutrient solution to re-grow. At the conclusion of 25 hours, the amount of re-growth was measured to determine tolerance. <br><br> My hypothesis, which stated that by selecting varieties of wheat based on the conditions under which a variety was developed such as soil pH and aluminum concentration in the soil would produce a variety which would be more tolerant to aluminum, was partially supported. I was unable to determine if one particular area produced more tolerant lines than others; however, I did find many varieties which have the potential to be used in other breeding programs to enhance their breeding lines such as FRONTANA, FRONTERIA, and EMPRAPA 16. By improving wheat’s tolerance to aluminum either by conventional or engineering practices wheat yield could be increased by up to 70% in extreme cases. By implementing research similar to this project, increased food supply can become a reality.

DEVELOPMENT OF PLANT RESOURCES FOR K12 TO UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION IN GENETICS
Re-I Chin
Walter Johnson High School, Bethesda, MD

Many classrooms utilize Wisconsin Fast Plants (WFP) as a teaching model for organismal growth and development due to its rapid life cycle, compact growth habit, and minimal inputs for propagation. However, WFP has limited applications in genetic education due to its self-infertility and self-incompatibility. The goal of this project is to develop mutant lines using a related strain of Brassica rapa, B3, bred specifically for self-compatibility and self-fertility. <br><br> B3 seeds were exposed to the chemical mutagen ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) and grown to generate Mutant Generation 1 (M1) plants. Flowering M1’s were self-pollinated to create Mutant Generation 2 (M2) seed families, which were subsequently screened for mutant phenotypes. Fertile mutant transplants were self-crossed to propagate mutant alleles and backcrossed to initiate genetic analysis. Complementation tests were conducted using mutants that exhibited similar mutant phenotypes.<br><br> Among 384 M2 families, fifteen produced at least one mutant segregant. Mutant phenotypes observed included plants with pale green leaves, albinos, dwarves, and light petal colors. Two Petal Color Mutant (PCM) lines were selected for further genetic analysis. Results from self-crosses, backcrosses and intercrosses suggested that the respective PCM phenotypes in parental mutant lines were due to heritable, recessive lesions at the same locus in the B. rapa genome. <br><br> The collection of mutant B. rapa lines will permit K12 and undergraduate students to perform inquiry-based, hands-on exercises to explore principles of non-Mendelian genetics, evolution, and developmental processes. Furthermore, these resources will stimulate critical thinking and enhance the learning experience for students and teachers alike.

THE IMPACT OF INTENSIVE GRAZING ON HORDEUM JUBATUM: VEGETATIVE PRODUCTION, SEED PRODUCTION, SEED GERMINATION RATE, AND SEED VIABILITY
Katrina Marie Eller
Fairfield Public School, Fairfield, MT

The purpose of this study was twofold: a) to examine the potential for intensive sheep grazing to control Hordeum jubatum, and b) to examine the potential for grazed Hordeum jubatum to recover after a rest period. After 60 days of exposure to grazing, samples collected from an exclosure and from six grazed plots allowed evaluation of the impact of grazing on: (a) total vegetative production; (b) Hordeum jubatum vegetative production; and (c) Hordeum jubatum seed weight, seed numbers, seed germination rate, and seed viability. The six grazed plots were re-sampled after 70 days of rest in order to determine the potential for Hordeum jubatum to recover from grazing and become a late season source of seed.<br><br>Data show that plots grazed for 60 days had significantly reduced vegetative production, seed weight, and seed numbers when compared to the exclosure plot. Data show that grazed plots, re-sampled after 70 days of rest, produced significantly less vegetation, seed weight, and seed numbers than the plots sampled immediately after 60 days of grazing. Data show that differences between both the seed germination rate and seed viability of the exclosure plot and the plots grazed for 60 days are not significant; however, the differences between the plots sampled at 60 days and 130 days are significant.

PROMOTING GFP: A STUDY ON THE STRENGTH OF DIFFERENT PROMOTERS ON GFP (GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN) EXPRESSION
Hannah Ruth Cox
Zane Trace High School, Chillicothe, OH

GFP is a marker gene derived from the jellyfish (Aequorea Victoria), used in DNA transfer and gene expression studies. This project studied the strength of promoters in soybean tissue by measuring the intensity of GFP expression. The purpose of this project was to evaluate the strength of three different promoters fused to GFP in transgenic soybeans and determine the differences in expression levels through photographs and image analysis. One control line, Jack (non-transformed) was used and three different promoter constructs were evaluated: Gmubi, Actin, and 35s. The hypothesis was that the GFP would be expressed at the highest level in plants containing the Gmubi promoter and least effective in plants containing the Actin promoter. Eight seeds of each variety were germinated for five days vertically in moistened paper towels. Microscopic images were collected under high intensity blue light of roots, cotyledons, cross-sections of roots, hypocotyls, and plumules of each transgenic event. The fluorescence intensity of the images was used to compare the strengths of the promoters. Gmubi was the strongest promoter because it had the brightest fluorescence. The 35s containing plants showed less GFP intensity but still were brighter than the actin containing plants. The actin GFP was brightest in the root, but still had overall the lowest expression. The hypothesis was partially correct because the Gmubi gave the strongest GFP expression, but the 35s promoter had a stronger GFP expression than actin. The hypothesis was partially disproved because the 35s promoter showed stronger GFP expression than the actin promoter.

USING ARUGULA TO MANAGE THE NORTHERN ROOT-KNOT NEMATODE IN DIFFERENT SOIL TYPES
Helen Yang
Troy High School, Troy, MI

Plant-parasitic nematodes cause billions of dollars worth of damage to the agricultural industry worldwide, and root-knot (Meloidogyne) nematodes are among the most significant pests. Because synthetic nematicides are often costly and environmentally damaging, ecologically and economically feasible alternatives are needed. Previous studies have indicated the arugula (Eruca sativa)'s trapping mechanism against root-knot nematodes and thus the crop's potential as an environmentally safe alternative to nematicide use. This project examined the effects of soil types on the arugula's growth and its M. hapla trapping mechanism.<br><br>Tests were performed with arugula and tomato, a highly vulnerable plant, infected with M. hapla under greenhouse conditions. Sandy, sandy loam and muck soils were collected from selected Michigan nursery and vegetable production fields. Nematodes were inoculated at 2000 eggs per plant. Four weeks later, plant growth and nematode developmental stages were measured.<br><br>Both plants had grown significantly more in muck soil than in sandy and sandy loam soil, whereas nematode population densities were greater in sandy loam soil than in sandy and muck soil combined. Nematodes infected tomato four times more than they did arugula. <br><br>Overall, this study indicates that arugula can trap nematodes in all soils but is most efficient at optimal plant growth. With a more comprehensive understanding of arugula's trapping mechanism, agriculture moves one step closer to using a powerful biofumigant and nematode-controlling agent on a large scale.

THIRSTY COTTON
Coleman Pierce Perry
Colquitt County High School, Moultrie, GA

This project was performed to determine if one can conserve water by watering cotton more at a certain time period and less in the other time periods. In 2007, farmers in the Southeast experienced one of the worst droughts in the past 100 years. This project can help farmers conserve water and essentially money.<br><br>The watering periods were split up into two terms, early and late. Three Fibermax B2R cotton seeds were planted into 12 pots. The pots were watered different amounts at different time periods. The results were determined by weighing the bolls, roots, stems, and leaves.<br><br>After gathering all the results for this project it was determined that it is more efficient to water cotton more late in the season than early in the season. The cotton watered late in the season had a seed cotton weight of 159.6g compared to the 125.6g of seed cotton from the cotton watered early in the season.<br><br>The results of this project are beneficial to any cotton farmer. The results conclude that one can conserve water and still have a good yield if you water more late in the cotton growing season.

A BIOTECHNOLOGY REVOLUTION: AN ANALYSIS OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED DNA
Suzanna Fay Cure
Wray High School, Wray, CO

The purpose of this project was to analyze how the amount of modified DNA varies between seed, plant and product of genetically modified corn. Two types of seed were used; Roundup ready seed corn and conventional seed corn. Roundup ready seed is modified corn that allows the farmers to spray herbicide (roundup) on their field to control weeds, without damaging the crop. The gene in modified crops is thought to diminish over several generations, this investigation will determine if the amount of genetically modified DNA reduces in one generation. The amount of GM genes will be analyzed and measured in the corn seed, corn plant, and corn product. The researcher hypothesizes that in one generation the amount of genetically modified corn will reduce between seed and plant. The percentage will also change among products based on how the product was made. First corn must be grown in order to test the leaf tissue. Then corn seed must be crushed in a coffee grinder for later use. Next, DNA must be extracted from the seed, plant and each product. After this the samples will then be placed in a thermal cycler to amplify DNA. A gel electrophoresis test will be able to tell whether or not genetically modified DNA is present. However, an error occurred during this process and results were inconclusive. Further research, using a real-time PCR would reveal percentages of the modified DNA. The data could conclude whether or not the amount of modified DNA is reduced or not.

POWER OF A BIOLOGICAL CONTROL AGENT: BIOLOGICAL COMPENSATION SUPPRESSION OF CONVOLVULUS ARVENSIS IMPLEMENTING HOST-SPECIFIC ACERIA MALHERBAE: PHASE IV
Kaitlyn Jeanne Lingus
Branson High School, Branson, CO

The purpose of this experiment was to conclude on the Host- Specific nature of the Bindweed Gall Mite when infested on Field Bindweed, while mapping the location of the mites to extrapolate migration location for future years. This project was also preformed to test the effect of the Bindweed Gall Mite on cultivated land that contained consumable vegetation.<br><br> I utilized two rangeland land plots that were separated by a mile in distance while maintaining the same topography features and two land plots located on cultivated sites. I infested these sites with the Bindweed Gall Mite taking data on stem count, length, seed count, and plant concentration count. I also documented and mapped the migration of the mites while creating a rating system to gauge the stage of infestation. I then compared data from three consecutive years, making sure there weren’t any mutations within the mites. I compared all data against non- infested Bindweed (Control). <br><br> My rangeland plots had an almost complete suppression of Bindweed plants by September 2007, calculating in late germination of seedlings. The mites traveled an average of 300 meters over a three year migration period, and there was no evidence of mutations.<br><br>My Cultivated Land Plots had success in infestation. The mites remained Host- specific to Convolvulus arvensis and did not migrate on to surrounding consumable vegetation. <br><br> Aceria malherbae remained host- specific, maintaining large suppression rates. The mites successfully over wintered in the location of infestation for two years, proving to be an effective method of control.

PROTECTING OUR CROPS: THE SEARCH FOR AN ORGANIC METHOD TO PREVENT ULTRA-VIOLET (UV) DAMAGE
Lissi Lisbet Welton
Buena High School, Sierra Vista, AZ

Our crops are being destroyed by excessive amounts of the suns harmful Ultra-Violet (UV) rays. This damage is costing our nation alone billions of dollars each year. There are several commercial compounds as well as waxes/coatings currently used to help to refract this UV radiation. However, the exact effects of these products on the human body is unknown. As well, these products inhibit photosynthesis and crop growth so that our crops do not reach their full potential. EGCG and Sulforophane are two compounds known to prevent and repair cell damage in humans caused by UV light. It is hypothesized that the use of EGCG and Sulforophane can protect crop plants from damage caused by UV-light. Two types Arabidopsis plants, wild-type and HY5 mutants, were started as seeds and watered with three different compounds: water, EGCG, and Sulforophane. Each group consisted of 18 wild-type and 18 mutant seeds. After 6 weeks, plants in water group were the only ones that grow. Mature Tomato, Pepper, and Brussel Sprouts were purchased and split into four groups: Control, UV-Control, EGCG, and Sulforophane. Plants in the UV-Control, EGCG and Sulforophane group were exposed to 80 mJ of UV light for a period of 20 days to simulate overexposure of UV light. At the end of 20 days, notable differences were seen between the various plant groups. EGCG and Sulforophane appear to have increased photosynthesis by producing a greener, healthier plant. As well, pepper plants watered with EGCG and Sulforophane produced peppers that were distinguishable different in size and shape from the UV-control plant. Peppers in the EGCG and Sulforophane group were larger in weight and length then peppers in the UV-control group. It is concluded that EGCG and Sulforophane are natural products that may be potentially helpful in preventing crop damage caused by UV light.

EFFECTIVE CONTROL OF LICHENS ON TEA TREES IN YUNNAN, CHINA
Jue Wang
Kunming 8th Middle School, Kunming, Yunnan, CHINA

During a taxonomic survey of tea trees in Yunnan 23 genera and 41 species of lichen were identified. They were found to affect the growth of the tree and quality of the tea leaves in the following ways: 1. Acidic substances formed during the growth of the lichens can damage vascular tissues of the trunk and cause premature aging of the tea tree. 2. Lichens near the tips of stems can affect shoot growth, reducing the quality and quantity of leaves produced. 3. Proliferation of lichens created a microhabitat favorable to insect pests and microbial pathogens potentially harmful to tea plants. Several combinations of fungicides and a series of chemical and physical experiments showed the spraying of liquid agents to be an effective control approach. One combination caused lichens to fragment and die, with no apparent harm to the tea tree. This method is a virus-free and inexpensive approach that could potentially increase tea production by 15-20%.

MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR RESPONSES UNDER HYPOXIC STRESS IN RICE CULTIVARS WITH DIFFERENT FLOODING TOLERANCE
Sonya Di-Chiao Juang
Kaohsiung Municipal Girl's Senior High School, Kaohsiung, CHINESE TAIPEI

Global warming increases the frequency of flooding, which drastically reduces the growth and survival of plants. Although rice (Oryza sativa) appears well-adapted to flooding of roots as it is often farmed in paddies, problems arise when the whole plant is submerged in water. To elucidate the mechanisms that underlying flood tolerance, differential responses to submergence were performed on Indica rice FR13A and IR64, which are respectively regarded as flood-tolerant and intolerant cultivars. <br><br>Major responses to submergence of plants include aerenchyma formation and switching to anaerobic metabolism. In this study, I monitored the effects of submergence on growth rate, aerenchyma formation, and expression of fermentative and glycolytic genes in FR13A and IR64 seedlings. FR13A showed severe coleoptile retardation but sustained aerenchyma formation; in contrast, the growth of IR64 was unaffected but aerenchyma formation was significantly hampered. Microarrays together with real time RT-PCR analysis showed that genes involved in sucrose degradation, glycolysis and fermentation are differentially regulated in these two cultivars. Microarray data indicated that sucrose synthetase remained unchanged in both cultivars, invertase was up-regulated in FR13A but down-regulated in IR64 while lactate dehydrogenase behaved in an opposite manner. However, phosphofructose kinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, and alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) were significantly up-regulated in both cultivars. With regard to the Adh family, Adh-1 was prominently induced in FR13A but Adh-2 was the predominant inducible form in IR64. The activity levels of these ADH isozymes were further monitored by in-gel staining.<br><br>Taken together, the results demonstrate that rice cultivars respond to flooding with different adaptive strategies and these findings may facilitate future molecular breeding of this important trait.

ANTI-AGING EFFECT AND ITS MECHANISMS OF THE EXTRACT OF CELASTRUS ORBICULATUS
Xuefei Bai
NO.2 High School Attached to East China Normal University, Shanghai, Shanghai, CHINA

Oriental Bittersweet (Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb.) , a resourceful plant in China and US, is used as traditional Chinese herb for building up the elderly’s health. The hypothesis is that Celastrus orbiculatus would have the effect to delay senescence. This project focused on its anti-aging effect, mechanisms of action, active constituents and safety for future use.<br><br> Fruitfly and yeast were employed as experimental models to study the life-span after the extract treatment. The average life-span of the treated fruitfly was significantly extended. Sexual vitality, resistance to high temperature and physical ability of the treated fruitfly were all enhanced. The extract also extended chronological life-span of yeast and increased the budding rate of yeast. <br><br> The longevity effects on human diploid fibroblast were tested. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and anti-superoxide anion radical activities were significantly increased, Malondialdehyde (MDA) content was reduced in the treated cells. Gene P16, P21, P53 expressions were strongly inhibited by the extract, which may contribute to its mechanisms of anti-aging effect.<br><br> The active constituents were found dissolved in ethyl acetate. After isolation and purification, the Liquid Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) determined the molecular weights are 606D, 442D, 565D, 585D and 569D. The component weighting 606D was isolated from this genus for the first time. The molecular structure identification is in process.<br><br> Furthermore, the extract was safe to mice even at the dosage up to 500 µg/ml (200-fold cell concentration). <br><br> The results indicate Celastrus orbiculatus has a potential of becoming a novel anti-aging agent.

WHAT FACTORS INFLUENCE SEED IMBIBITION?
Nicole Rae DeJong
Avon High School 4-1, Avon, SD

Soybeans are used in a wide variety of important products. For soybeans to grow, they first need to take up water, or imbibe. Initially, water penetrates the seed coat. Any damage such as cracks or scratches to the seed coat could logically affect imbibition. The water’s pH could also damage the coat. Once the coat is penetrated, the movement of water is controlled by osmosis. Temperature can also determine the direction of water flow and so can conductivity, which is a measure of dissolved solids. To determine which of these factors most influence seed imbibition I prepared water baths of differing temperatures, conductivities, and pH. Whole seeds were placed within them for differing amounts of time. In addition, another set of seeds had their coats scratched with an iron file and were treated in the same manner. The seeds were weighed before and after immersion to determine the amount of water absorbed. They were then planted to observe the effects of imbibition on germination. <br><br>The data to this point indicates a strong positive correlation between temperature and seed imbibition and a weak negative correlation between conductivity and imbibition. Although initial scratching improved imbibition, additional scratching provided no further benefit. There was no correlation between pH and seed imbibition. These results could be used to find the optimal conditions for seeds to imbibe water. Since imbibition affects germination this project may be used to find the best planting conditions for farmers.

RISK ASSESSMENT OF BT TRANSGENIC BRASSICA: EFFECT ON TARGET AND NONTARGET INSECTS AND USE OF SSR MOLECULAR MARKERS TO ASSESS CROSS-COMPATIBILITY AND OUTCROSSING POTENTIAL OF BRASSICA ACCESSIONS
Hemali Chandramohan Batra
Central Campus, Des Moines, IA

The concerns of the international community regarding bioengineered plants necessitate risk assessments of Bt transgenic Brassica, in which I combined entomology and molecular genetics to research their impact on flora and fauna of surrounding environments. Due to the weakening or premature death of Plutella xylostella larvae from ingestion of Bt crystal toxin proteins, they cannot serve as viable pupal hosts for the development of Diadromus collaris endoparasitoid eggs, resulting in a decreased rate of percent parasitism. Because prevailing studies on the impact of Bt toxin ingestion by target insects on non-target insects have been largely inconclusive, this result of effectively controlled nontarget pest populations with fewer female offspring to sustain future endoparasitoid populations is significant. Because the likelihood that Plutella xylostella can develop resistance to multiple toxin proteins in a gene-pyramided transgenic plant is minimal, Bt crops present a long-term solution for pest management. In addition, I used microsatellite, or simple sequence repeat (SSR), molecular markers to formulate a dendrogram depicting genetic relationships among thirty-two Brassica accessions. Determining the outcrossing potential and cross-compatibility of accessions is integral in the risk assessment of Bt transgenic Brassica because the international community is wary of the possible consequence of transgene escape through hybridization resulting from the release of transgenic plants into the environment. Knowledge of accessions’ outcrossing potential will define future risk assessments involving experimental crosses of accessions. If accessions are not reproductively compatible in nature, the concerns of the international community regarding the threat of transgene escape to biodiversity can be alleviated.

CAN THEY TAKE THE HEAT? THE EFFECTS OF HEAT SHOCK ON ONION ROOT MITOSIS
Robyn Sabrina Toy
Niles North High School, Skokie, IL

The purpose of this experiment was to test the effects of heat shock on onion root mitosis. The hypothesis was that if onions are heat shocked at various temperatures, then the rate of mitosis in the onion root tips will decrease with the increase in hte temperature of the heat shock.<br><br> Twelve white pearl onions where grown for two days at 19°C in Styrofoam cups with 130 mL of water. They were randomly divided into six groups. Each group except the control were heat shocked for 30 minutes at either 22°C, 25°C, 28°C, 31°C, or 34°C. One root tip was cut off each onion to make slides. Slides were viewed under a microscope at 400x. Pictures of ten fields of vision were taken of each slide using Motic Images Plus 2.0. The numbers of total and mitotic cells were counted in each field. Percentages of mitotic and non-mitotic cells were calculated for each field. The average percentages were taken for each onion. Percentages for onions in same groups were combined for the average percentages of the whole experimental group.<br><br> There was an observed inverse correlation between mitosis rate and heat shock temperature. The x² statistic was used to confirm the deviation didn’t occur by chance and was a result of heat shock temperatures. The only heat shock group to not have a significant deviation was 22°C. The higher heat shock groups had distorted cells. The hypothesis was supported.

SOY SOLUTION: PRE-IMBIBITIONAL MOISTURE EFFECTS ON THE INJURY RESISTANCE OF SOYBEANS
Joshua Kurt Segeren
John McGregor Secondary School, Chatham, Ontario, CANADA

Soybean seed is most susceptible to injury from exposure to environmental stresses during the early stages of seed germination, when the membrane lipids of plant embryonic cells reorganize from the dry state to the metabolically active state, through the imbibition of water. Injury can occur as a result of chilling or dehydration, exhibiting symptoms of decreased germination, increased leakage of cytoplasmic solutes, slower growth rates, and inhibited seedling vigour. This experiment determined the effect of pre-imbibitional moisture levels on the ability of soybean seeds to resist imbibitional chilling and/or dehydration injury. Observations were taken in two separate phases using soybeans at 8, 10, 12, and 14 percent moistures. During the first phase, all seeds were grown in vitro, and quantitative observations regarding germination and electrolyte leakage were made in growing environments designed to simulate ideal conditions and those likely to result in injury. A third evaluation assessed seed respiration in ideal growing conditions. During the second phase of experimentation, soybeans of the four moisture groups were planted in field test plots under temperatures conducive to chilling injury. Germination and yield measurements were taken. Seeds of 12 and 14 percent initial moistures demonstrated the lowest sensitivity to environmental stresses and high viability when germinated in ideal conditions. Those at 14 percent yielded an average of approximately 25% higher than their counterparts of eight percent. These results would have significant applications for agriculturalists plus benefits to consumers since they present a low-cost and easily integrative means of substantially increasing soybean yields.

CYDIA POMONELLA COMPARISON IN APPLE VARIETIES
Peter Kajiwara Atkins
Bayfield High School, Bayfield, WI

The purpose of this research was to determine whether the infestation level of codling moth differs between apple varieties while the fruit matures. The null hypothesis stated that the infestation level of coddling moth does not differ between apple varieties during maturation of fruit. Four apple trees of different variety were selected. Whitney Crab, McIntosh, Wealthy, and Dutchess. Every week up to 100 of the fallen fruit from each variety was inspected for codling moth damage. The corresponding percentages were recorded in tables and graphs to be analyzed. After analyzing data and performing Z-Tests, three of the four apple varieties showed infestation levels of codling moth that were statistically the same as the fruit matured except on two dates. The levels of codling moth in the Wealthy, Whitney, and McIntosh all increased dramatically as the fruit matured. Only the Dutchess apples had significantly different data with levels of codling moth decreasing as the fruit matured. The data showed the ideal time periods for each variety to control codling moth by picking up the dropped apples in a low spray/no spray orchard. It would be most efficient to pick up the fallen Dutchess apples early in the summer, and to pick up the fallen Wealthy, McIntosh, and Whitney apples later in the summer.

SUSTAINABLE AQUACULTURE THROUGH UTILIZATION OF DUCKWEED
Jane Madelyn Luceno
Yorktown High School, Yorktown Heights, NY

Aquaculture is the cultivation of fish/marine creatures in a controlled environment and has been implemented in some developing nations. Traditionally commercial feeds have been used in these systems. To increase the sustainability, plant life has been incorporated to ease use of expensive conventional feeds often difficult to obtain in developing nations. Duckweed is a small flowering plant high in protein, providing a potential feed for fish. By removing potentially harmful substances (nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium) plant tissue becomes high in protein. Fertilizers increase plant growth and provide nutrients. Optimal conditions must be achieved to harness substantial amounts of protein. Phase 1 of experimenting used chicken and cow manure. 57 grams of fertilizer was administered to each tank (not control). Over the 4 week period photos were taken weekly to assess growth. Increased growth was achieved in fertilized tanks; chicken manure fertilization was most successful. To further support these findings a second phase begun. In Phase 2 three fertilizers were utilized, chicken and goat manure and mature compost. 30 grams of fertilizer were administered to 6-gallon tanks (each received different fertilizer) containing equal amounts of duckweed (not control). Growth period was 16 days, approximately every two days a photo of was taken of each tank. Chicken manure provided the greatest duckweed growth, supporting trial 1. This research proved fertilizers improve duckweed growth, this is essential to producing large amounts of duckweed. In the future this research will be incorporated into a fish system and the affects of fertilizing on water quality/ dissolved oxygen will be evaluated. The overall potential of duckweed as a feed must be found in order to incorporate it into a successful system.

TOWARDS NITROGEN-FIXING SYMBIOSES WITHOUT MUTUAL CONSENT: THE IMPACT OF CARBON LIMITATION ON ENDOPHYTIC INFECTION OF MAIZE
Sushant Sundaresh
The Harker School, San Jose, CA

Chemical fertilizers disrupt natural nitrogen cycles, contributing directly to global warming, ozone depletion, and marine and terrestrial ecosystem failure. Some crops (i.e. legumes) circumvent the need for chemically fixed nitrogen by interacting with specific nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Such symbiotic nitrogen fixation has the potential to restore balance to global nitrogen cycles, but its applicability is limited by the host-bacterial specificity born of the plant locus of control. <br><br> Cereal crops like maize cannot establish effective symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. It was hypothesized that carbon availability was the limiting environmental factor in planta. Bacterial regulation of carbon abundance in the maize-Azorhizobium interaction was simulated. The impact of this bacterial locus of control on non-specific symbiotic nitrogen fixation was evaluated.<br><br> Growth conditions of A. caulinodans ORS571 were manipulated to induce synthesis of the carbon storage polymer PHB to assess the impact of carbon limitation on microbial infection and nitrogen fixation. ORS571 strains with both constitutive lacZ population markers and translational nifH-lacZ nitrogen-fixation markers were utilized to track microbial activity. Vacuum infiltration procedures were optimized to homogenously inoculate maize plants. Bacterial population density (validated through standard colony counts) and transcriptional activity were quantified through both pixel- and object- oriented image analysis of stained root sections. <br><br> Bacteria with higher carbon stores exhibited significantly increased viability in the host vasculature relative to their low-carbon counterparts. Differential transcriptional intensities indicated that carbon limitation significantly repressed nitrogen fixation gene expression in Azorhizobium. Bacterial regulation of carbon availability served to stimulate nitrogen-fixing activity during non-specific interactions with maize.

FIRE IN THE WATER: THE EFFECTS OF DISSOLVED OXYGEN LEVELS ON THE BIOLUMINESCENCE OF DINOFLAGELLATES (PYROCYSTIS FUSIFORMIS)
Zander Kyle Holbrook Hoke
Juneau Douglas High School, Juneau, AK

The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the effects of dissolved oxygen levels in seawater on the bioluminescence of Pyrocystis fusiformis. In 15 test cycles, a flask containing fusiformis was placed into a light-proof box. A long exposure photograph captured the bioluminescent flash of my dinoflagellates. I measured the oxygen saturation in the flask; then I bubbled air into the flask to raise the dissolved oxygen level. A second photograph and another oxygen measurement completed the cycle. I allowed 35 minutes of rest before each photograph to permit my dinoflagellates to recover their chemical capacity to bioluminesce. I used the histogram function of Adobe Photoshop to measure the light output of each photograph.<br><br> My experiment showed that at dissolved oxygen levels of 91%, total bioluminescent output (i.e. average light level per pixel times total pixels in the photograph) was about 2,000,000 (undimensioned) units. At oxygen levels of 99%, light output averaged 500,000 units. My hypothesis, that light output increases with increasing oxygen levels, was not supported by my experiment.<br><br> The R2 confidence measure of my data’s trend lines, which show that light output decreased with increasing oxygen, averaged 54%. Though this low R2 value and the unsuitability of my oxygen meter leave me doubting the validity of my findings, this experiment helps to identify improved procedures for future research. <br><br> Bioluminescence research portends exciting potential uses in mapping accurate cancer surgery, tracing pathogens in food processing, accurate mixing of nutrients in bioreactors, and studying marine fluid flow characteristics.

QUANTITATIVE PROTEOMIC PROFILING OF THE METHYL JASMONATE RESPONSIVE REDOX SYSTEM IN ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA
Gordon Hirsch Wilson
Spruce Creek High School, Port Orange, FL

Glucosinolates are induced by Methyl Jasmonate (MeJA), a signaling molecule in plant tissue. Due to the fact that MeJA also induces greater levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within plants, it was proposed that Methyl Jasmonate uses the process of redox regulation to induce higher levels of Glucosinolates within Arabidopsis thaliana, and that thiol redox regulation possibly plays other important roles in Methyl Jasmonate signaling in plant cells. <br><br> A proteomic approach was used in experimentation, starting with seedling growth of a control and a MeJA treatment. Protein extraction from leaf tissue and monobromobiamane labeling of redox regulated proteins in order to differentiate between total protein expression and redox regulated proteins then followed. The proteins were separated through two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, image analysis was performed in order to differentiate protein intensities between samples, and proteins were lastly identified through Mass Spectrometry. <br><br> Fourteen spots of significant change were located, and six exceptional protein spots were cut and identified. It was concluded that MeJA deactivates proteins involved in ROS detoxification through redox regulation, and the accumulated ROS can then trigger other proteins involved with defense responses. This result was unexpected because no proteins directly involved with Glucosinolate metabolism were identified.

STAGE SPECIFIC EXPRESSION OF PEROXIDASE ENZYMES IN WOUND HEALING POTATO TUBERS
Royce Alexander Hoffner

Suberization is the MOST important part of our world...well, the potato world, that is. Suberization is the healing process of a potato, without it, there is no potato. Think for a while on all of the things you enjoy eating. How a bout a nice BLT with some salted potato chips? Or a bucket of KFC chicken with that great potato salad? Without suberization you would be left with a dry old sandwich or some cold chicken. Suberization is one of the most crucial parts of storing potatoes.<br><br>The hypothesis was that different cultivars would take different amounts of time to suberize. To find this, the following procedures were completed.<br><br>Potatoes were cut into 8 pieces and then left at specified heat and humidity for specified times. RNA was isolated using a Phenol:Chloroform method. Then First Strand was synthesized using a thermo cycler. Then genes were expressed using PCR and then run on an agarose gel and electrophoresed for one hour and a half; a picture was then taken.<br><br>From the data collected the hypothesis was supported in that the cultivars suberized in the following order: Purple Majesty, Canela Russet, Colorado Rose, and Yukon Gold. Therefore the conclusion is that different potatoes do, in fact, suberize at different times. <br><br>So the next time you eat some kind of potato product, be thankful that it has suberin. <br><br>

THE ALLELOPATHIC PHENOMENON OF SWEET POTATOES (IPOMOEA BATATAS)
Mason Cole McFarland
Jefferson County International Baccalaureate School, Birmingham, AL

Allelopathy is the influence of a chemical released by one plant on the growth of another plant. “How do the allelopathic chemicals found in sweet potatoes affect other plants?” The primary objectives are to examine the allelopathic effects of sweet potatoes on kudzu, radish and millet. The hypothesis for this research is that the allelopathic chemicals found in sweet potatoes will suppress plant growth and prohibit seed germination. If sweet potatoes secrete these allelopathic chemicals, then it could be possible to not only stop the rapid growth of kudzu, but it could also be used as an effective method of weed control around food producing crops. <br><br>Two control groups were planted, one with sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) and another with kudzu (Pueraria montana), and one experimental group with sweet potatoes and kudzu growing together. There was a control group of millet (Panicum milliaceum) with an experimental group of sweet potatoes and millet. There was a control group of radish (Raphanus sativus) with an experimental group of sweet potatoes and radish. To eliminate as many variables as possible, adequate water and sunlight were provided to promote equalized plant growth.<br><br>In less than ninety days the data collected from this experiment was supportive of the hypothesis. Sweet potatoes greatly reduced the growth of kudzu when the two species were grown together. Additionally, sweet potatoes significantly decreased the seed germination rate of both the millet and radish seeds. The allelopathic potential of sweet potatoes may someday be a natural alternative to synthetic herbicides.

Hankinson High School, Hankinson, ND

PURPOSE: To determine if tea extracts could be used as an environmentally friendly pesticide. Also, to observe whether the tea extracts would have adverse or positive effects on the growth of wheat. <br><br>PROCEDURES: Collected 3 teas (black, green, and white) along with two chemicals. The teas were at a 20:1 ratio and the chemicals were applied using field application rates.<br><br>TEST PLOT: Measured a 30x60 foot wheat test plot area and applied solutions onto the wheat crop. Wheat was then allowed a three-month growing period. After harvest, wheat seeds were analyzed and milled into flour for baking. Following baking, the loave’s physical appearances were analyzed.<br><br>PATHOGEN STUDY: Tested tea extracts for their inhibitory properties on the growth of pathogenic and beneficial microbes. Furthermore, analyzed the solutions ability to fend off pathogens when applied directly on wheat.<br><br>INSECT STUDY: Examined the fatality of detrimental insects through both fumigation and ingestion of impregnated wheat germ. Also, tested the migratory characteristics of beneficial Convergent Ladybugs.<br><br>CONCLUSION: From the test plot, I found that two of the teas promoted the growth of wheat. In the insect study, the teas were found to have slower fatality rates than the insecticide, though they did not harm the lady beetles. For the pathogen study, the teas had larger inhibition zones dealing with the pathogens, but did not harm beneficial bacteria as much as the bactericide/fungicide. Overall, I feel that green tea does show potential to be used as a biopesticide.

IN VITRO CONSERVATION OF SCUTELLARIA BARBATA: A SYNSEED TECHNOLOGY
Johnny Fells
Northside High School, Warner Robins, GA

The project was “In Vitro Conservation of Scutellaria barbata a Synseed Technology”. The problem was finding the best conservation and multiplication methods for Scutellaria barbata. The purpose was to find the treatment with the highest biomass and shoot counts and to find the best duration for conservation. The hypothesis was that the S.barbata explants in Murashige and Skoog Medium with 6-benzylamionpurine inside bioreactor vessels would be best for multiplication; also 2 weeks would be best for conservation. The experiment occurred in two parts. First, S.barbata multiplied using two control treatments, Murashige and Skoog Medium (MS) and Gamborg B5 Medium (B5), and two treatments treated with hormones (MS1B and B51B). After 69 days, the explants were weighed for fresh weights and dry weights. Second, explants were made into synthetic seeds. In two week intervals for six weeks, the synseeds were taken out for survival rates. The results were that MS1B S.barbata explants in the bioreactor vessels yielded the highest biomass and shoot counts; also the 4 week duration had the highest survival rate in conservation. The conclusion was that S.barbata cultured in MS1B inside bioreactor vessels was the best multiplication method; also 4 weeks was the best duration for conservation.

DEVELOPING A SYSTEM FOR THE EFFECTIVE BIOSYNTHESIS OF PHARMACEUTICALS: A NOVEL, PLANT-BASED APPROACH VIA THE TRICHOMES
Allan Jer-Yu Hsiao
duPont Manual Magnet High School, Louisville, KY

Glandular trichomes, specialized epithelial cells present on the surfaces of many plants, are known to be the sites of chemical production. The promoter of interest, the Δ9-myristyl-ACP fatty acid desaturase gene promoter of the Geranium plant (Pelargonium x hortorum), was hypothesized to be trichome-specific based on its associated products. This specificity serves as the basis for the proposed system, in which pharmaceuticals can potentially be produced in the trichomes with the benefits of high product output and purity, and increased ease of extraction. The promoter was isolated using a PCR-based Genome Walker approach and the sequence was analyzed. Using VectorNTI Contig construction software, 2112 b.p. of consensus sequence were obtained. The translation start site was found at the 1552nd base pair. A CpG Island of length 268 b.p., indicative of a highly-expressed promoter, was found near the start site. A number of possible cis-acting DNA regulatory elements, primarily transcription factor binding sites, were located as well. Upon alignment with known cDNA sequence of the promoter (Schultz, 1996), an intron of length 656 b.p. was found—increasing the likelihood for the exclusion of certain distal elements within the isolated promoter sequence. Sterile tobacco leaf discs were then transformed, via Agrobacterium Tumefaciens, with the promoter sequence and a ligated reporter gene (Green Fluorescent Protein), to determine the trichome-specificity and the expression strength of the promoter.

A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF TWO MISTLETOES, DENDROPEMON BICOLOR AND DENDROPEMON CARIBAEUS IN TWO HOSTS: WHITE CEDAR (TABEBUIA HETEROPHYLLA) AND FIDDLEWOOD (CYTHAREXYLUM FRUTICOSUM)
Omar Andre Rivera-Pellot

Mistletoes are hemi-parasitic plants that obtain nutrients from their host through a modified root called haustorium. <br><br>In the Camuy area in Puerto Rico Dendropemon bicolor is a parasite of white cedar tree (Tabebuia heterophylla) while Dendropemon caribaeus is a parasite of fiddlewood tree (Cytharexylum frutisosum). Since these hosts are common for the two species of mistletoes in other areas of Puerto Rico, the problem presented was: will these mistletoes adapt to a change in host? Will the change affect the height of the hemi-parasites, the size and the amount of their leaves? <br><br>The hypothesis was that both species were going to develop in the new host but their best development would be in their original host where they would grow taller and have more and bigger leaves.<br><br>One hundred seeds of each of the mistletoes were collected in the Camuy area. These were taken to a botanical garden. Seeds from each mistletoe were planted in each of 36 white cedar trees and in each of 36 fiddlewood trees. Seeds of both mistletoes germinated in both hosts. Data about the plants was recorded. <br><br>After analyzing the data it can be concluded that the hypothesis was supported by the findings since D. bicolor had a better development in white cedar tree and D. caribaeus had a better development in fiddlewood tree. This demonstrated that the same development pattern of the mistletoes in Camuy was observed in the botanical garden although it is very far away from the Camuy area.

SOIL DISINFECTION BY VARIOUS METHODS: MICROWAVE IRRADIATION VS. HOT WATER TREATMENT
BaoTran Trannguyen
North Quincy High School, Quincy, MA

The purpose of this project is to determine the best method of soil disinfection using microwave irradiation and hot water treatment. It was hypothesized that the hot water would work better because it would not have to overcome the physico-chemical shielding effects of the soil. <br><br><br>The control variables in this project were the amount of soil in each sample, the amount of water, and the amount of artificial sunlight. To test microwave irradiation, transformed E. coli B was introduced into previously sterilized samples and then exposed to radiation in a 1000W microwave for 0.0 to 96.0s. Three lettuce seeds were then planted into each sample, covered with plastic wrap, and let grow under the lamps. With the hot water treatment, a similar procedure was followed, but heated distilled water of temperatures between 93°C and 111°C was applied, using 23°C (room temperature) as the control. <br><br><br>The microwave irradiation was more effective than hot water treatment in inhibiting bacterial growth, especially at longer microwave exposure times. The lettuce plants grown from microwaved soil samples grew better also. The radiation treatment might have worked better because the heat applied to the samples dissipated more slowly than that of the water. <br><br><br>Presently, the unidentifiable bacterial growth and the lack of plant growth in select hot water treatment trials are being studied. Also, the nutrient content of the soil will be measured before and after each treatment to determine whether any depletion occurs.

NATURAL COLOR FROM IXORA FLOWERS
Lavanya Giriraj
Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Mandya, Karnataka, INDIA

Extraction of color from Ixora coccinea flowers and demonstration of different use of color in food, fabric dye, and paint. As the awareness level of people about the deleterious effects of synthetic colors increases, the demand of natural colorants for foods, drugs, cosmetics,textiles, etc is expected to increase enormously. This project suggests that food, paint and fabric color can be produced from dry as well as fresh extract obtained from Ixora flower petals. Fresh petals of Ixora are soaked in distilled water, ground to paste, squeezed and filtered to obtain aqueous extract. Methanol extraction was also carried out. Ice cream and milk were prepared using the dry powder of Ixora (red and pink) which imparted a light pink color. Jam was made with Ixora flower, which was red in color. Ixora extract was used to dye fabric, cotton and silk threads. Water color and oil paint were also prepared. The colours of paint and fabric dye obtained are red and did not fade in the fastness test. There is ample scope for using the extract of Ixora flowers for obtaining different colours for food, paint and fabric. The T.L.C test, done at an independent laboratory, shows significant presence of coloring pigments. Hence food, paint and fabric color from Ixora may be a good substitute for artificial dyes. The exact colouring pigment needs to be identified, separated and compared with colours in current use. Ixora is available in several species with different colors. Hence different colors may be obtained from different species of the same plant. The color is obtained from the flowers of the plant without harming the plant itself. The plant has flowers throughout the year and hence a continuous supply of flowers is assured.

THE EFFECTS OF FLASH FLOODING ON ANT-PLANT INTERACTIONS: A STUDY ON LAPORTEA CANADENSIS (URTICACEAE)
Grace Ella Harper
Wentzville Holt High School, Wentzville, MO

Several nettles have ant-plant symbiotic relationships. To see if a relationship existed between the wood nettle and ants, an ant-exclusion experiment was performed. 90 plants were numbered and randomly assigned either treatment or control. The treatment plants were treated with a sticky resin, Tanglefoot®, and nearby plants that could serve as vegetative bridges were trimmed. Each week for a total of three, the number of galls was counted. Ant censuses were conducted as well. In the middle of the experiment, the site was flooded, submerging half of the plants. No research has been done to investigate the effects of flooding on ant-plant interactions. Taking advantage of this rare situation, the effect of flooding on the ant population was studied. The ants provided a marginally significant protection against herbivores. Flooding created a decrease in ant abundance at first, but the ants are resilient and their population went back to normal within a few days.

AN ANALYSIS OF ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS INFLUENCING ANNUAL TREE GROWTH
Richard Daniel Allen, Brady Clark, Zachary Sweat
Union County High School, Lake Butler, FL

A variety of environmental factors are responsible for healthy tree growth. The availability of water from both precipitation and groundwater, nutrients and sunlight are examples of such factors. This project is a continued study of the importance environmental factors play on the annual growth rate of trees. Previously, precipitation and groundwater data was correlated to annual growth data resulting in correlation values much lower than expected. It was hypothesized that competition from nearby trees would result in less available sunlight and nutrients. Therefore, the correlation between growth and competition from neighboring trees should be significant (>0.5). In this experiment, competition from neighboring trees was correlated to annual growth data and DBH (Diameter Breast Height) values. Annual growth rate was determined by analyzing core samples bored from 50 slash pine trees in a forest of pines located in our local community. Using the same forest of pines, competition between adjacent trees was calculated. In order to determine the competition variable, 30 trees were identified as test subjects for competition. For each of the 30 trees, the 3 closest trees were identified. The distance between the 3 closest trees and each test subject tree was measured. A total of 90 measurements were taken. The average distance between each test subject tree and its 3 nearest competitors was determined. The DBH of each of the 30 test trees was measured. Competition values derived from the 3 closest tree averages were correlated to DBH values and annual growth data. Competition values correlated to DBH values yielded a 0.24 correlation coefficient. This value was lower than hypothesized. It is concluded that no single environmental factor influences tree growth significantly, but that all environmental factors taken collectively have the greatest influence on annual tree growth.

Pensacola High School, Pensacola, FL

“Evoked Potentials In Plants” was used to test if plants can feel pain or other stimuli that humans feel, such as hot or cold temperatures and or bright, flashing light. The hypothesis of the experiment was that if plants were exposed to stressful conditions, then they would show the responses to stimuli on the EEG machine such as a human would. <br><br>In the experiment, group A was the control group. Ice was placed into group B to determine the effect of cold temperature on plants. Water was heated to 190 degrees Fahrenheit then applied to group C. A UV strobe light flashing ten times per second was tested on group D. <br><br>The conclusion stated that the only independent variable that affected the plant was when the ice was applied to group B.<br><br>After the results were concluded the experiment was retested but this time measuring each individual plant for two minutes. The results shown indicated that the ice group had the most effect on the plants and unlike the first group of results the ice group brought the plants activity down, and when retested we found our first group of results where wrong and instead of dropping activty in the plants activity went up. This ulitamtley showed that a plant is most unhappy, when exposed to cold.

DEVELOPMENT OF A RAPID ASSAY TEST TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL SOURCES OF SALT TOLERANCE IN WILD OREGON STRAWBERRY (FRAGARIA SP.) POPULATIONS
Elliott Chad Finn, Rob Livesay, Hanna Lorenz
Elliott Chad Finn, Corvallis, OR

Strawberries (Fragaria ×ananassa) are increasingly grown in soils with high salt levels or with salty irrigation water. Developing cultivars with tolerance will be increasingly important. This study evaluated Oregon F. virginiana and F. chiloensis for salt tolerance and developed a rapid assay to do this efficiently and economically. Populations were collected from eight sites representing the coastal dunes, the Coast Range, and the Willamette Valley. Runners from nine genotypes per population were established in the greenhouse for 35 days. Plants were watered with increasingly saltier solutions; 100 meq NaCl initially, increasing every 10 d by 100 meq. Simultaneously, a detached leaf assay was established. Containers were filled with a 200 meq NaCl solution. Leaves were cut from stock plants of the same genotypes as in the whole plant assay and their petioles submerged in the solution. Plants and leaves were scored every two days for changes in plant vigor/leaf health on a 1-9 scale (1=dead, 9=excellent vigor, green healthy). In both experiments, there were significant differences between but not within populations, suggesting future collection should sample more populations rather than more genotypes/population. The populations from the coastal dunes had higher vigor and plant health scores than other populations. Glenedon Beach was intermediate between the coastal and inland populations in the whole plant assay but not in the detached leaf assay. Whole plant and detached leaf assay scores were well correlated (r=0.65) suggesting that the detached leaf assay would be an economical and rapid approach to screening for salt tolerance.

THE STERILIZATION OF RUBUS DISCOLOR IN VITRO
Ann Christine Bernert, Haley Epperly, 
West Linn High School, West Linn, OR

The Himalayan blackberry, Rubus discolor, is a noxious weed in Oregon’s Willamette Valley. Blackberry Rust, Phragmidium violaceum, was found infecting Oregon R. discolor species in 2005. P. violaceum has proved capable of biologically controlling R. discolor in Australia, Chile, and New Zealand. Since P. violaceum is a biotrophic fungus, it needs a living host in order to survive. In vitro blackberry tissue cultures could provide a sterile, yearlong and controlled host for this fungus. This project explored the sterilization of R. discolor explants in preparation for tissue culture. <br><br> R. discolor explants were initiated on sterile media under a flow hood. A preliminary experiment compared incubation against non-incubation on bringing cultures out of dormancy. Experiments one and two were performed to maximize growth and minimize contamination. In both experiments, explants were sterilized using different bleach concentrations, and or various bleach duration times. Contamination rate, leaf count and culture death were observed. Experiment one revealed that longer bleach duration delayed the onset of culture contamination. Experiment two showed that lower bleach concentrations allowed for more leaf growth.<br><br>Every culture eventually became contaminated. To eliminate sample contamination, other methods to sterilize R. discolor explants should be developed. Once there is a sterile source, R. discolor can be contaminated by P. violaceum inside a controlled environment, thus providing a reliable source of P. violaceum for experimentation.

THE WATER EXTRACT OF ALLIGATOR WEED LEAVES DID AFFECT ON THE SEED GERMINATION, SEEDLING GROWTH AND GENE EXPRESSION OF RICE
Wei-Xi Xiong, Jin-Ming Yang, 
No.7 High School of Chengdu City, Chengdu City, Sichuan Province, CHINA

Biological invasions have become one of the greatest-impact, most seriously harmful and hard-to-prevent ecological problems. Alligator weed (Alternanthera philoxcroides G.) is an invasive malignant weed which is of great harm to China's agro-ecosystems. Many researches concentrate in its biology and ecology characteristics, yet little is known of its allelopathy to the crops. We studied the germination percentage as well as the length of seedling, analyzed certain coercion related isozyme pattern by the active electrophoresis and analyzed the protein expression level and the mRNA transcription level of cab with the aid of Western blot and RT-PCR. The result indicated that: the water extract of alligator weed has an obviously inhibitory effect on the rice seed germination, and restrains the rice seedlings to grow, along with density increases, the inhibitory effect enhances; The water extract also affects the relative activity of certain isozyme in the rice seedling leaves, and obviously reduces the cab gene expression both in the protein level and the mRNA level. Chemical reaction experiment suggests that the allelochemical may be flavonoid. The above results preliminarily prove the alligator weed has an obvious allelopathy to the rice, and the allelochemical is flavonoid.

PINE BEETLE OUTBREAKS: SPATIAL ANALYSIS AND PHEROMONE POPULATION CONTROL
Anika Rose Petach, Tanya Nicole Petach, 
Fairview High School, Boulder, CO

The mountain pine bark beetle epidemic has infected over 5 million acres of forest in Colorado. Remote sensing techniques were used to determine geographic features that correlate with susceptibility to beetle infection. Following the identification of high susceptibility regions, beetle populations were controlled through the use of the anti-aggregation pheromone, verbenone. <br><br> A quantitative algorithm was developed to distinguish beetle-infected (“red-attack”) trees from live trees using the attributes associated with each pixel in a satellite image. Once tree status was determined for each pixel, the status was correlated with geographic characteristics (e.g., aspect, elevation, slope). Based on these correlations, geographic regions were identified as high or low susceptibility to mountain pine bark beetle attack in Grand County, Colorado. The most susceptible regions in the study sites were ridge top elevations, steep slopes (30% slope), and south facing aspects. <br><br> Two distinct forest regions were selected for the pheromone study; one highly susceptible and one less susceptible to pine beetle attack, based on the remote sensing results. Verbenone pheromone was applied in the two forest study sites (Site 1: 9000 foot elevation, north facing aspect; and Site 2: 10,000 foot elevation, south facing aspect). As compared to equivalent control sites, verbenone pheromone decreased one-year beetle infection rates in high susceptibility regions from 16% to 6%. The susceptibility of geographic regions to beetle attack may influence the expected outcome of beetle control methods.

THE ROLE OF CALCIUM-SODIUM INTERACTIONS IN PROMOTING SALT-TOLERANCE IN CERATOPTERIS RICHARDII WILD-TYPE AND STL2 MUTANT
Elizabeth Mary Whitman, Christina Xiong, 
Benjamin N. Cardozo High School, Bayside, NY

Salt tolerant plants have ecological, economical and biological significance. This research focuses on the relationship between salt tolerance and calcium uptake in the model organism, Ceratopteris richardii. A mutant strain of Ceratopteris richardii, stl2, was used due to its ability to grow in the presence of 150 mM of sodium salts. It was thought that a reduction of calcium in the nutrient medium could improve salt tolerance in stl2. The role of sodium-calcium exchangers indicated that a decreased number of calcium ions would result in less sodium ions entering the cell. However, the results provided contradicting evidence, supporting the idea that increasing calcium can improve salt tolerance. Experimental groups exposed to higher concentrations of calcium in varying amounts of sodium expressed increased growth in the form of larger antheridia and hermaphrodites. The morphological results were supported by protein gel electrophoresis. The increased number of bands and intensity of the banding patterns in the Ceratopteris richardii that had been exposed to higher levels of calcium indicated higher protein synthesis. This suggests that the groups grown in higher concentrations of calcium were less affected by salt. Calcium’s role in activating the SOS signal transduction pathway, one that deals with salt stress, can provide an explanation for this phenomenon. Salt tolerance is a complex, multifaceted problem that involves signaling pathways in plants and multiple ion channels. The complete picture of salt tolerance and the functioning of stl2 may involve a combination of any of these processes.

DETERMINATION OF THE EFFICIENCY OF SYMBIOTIC NITROGEN FIXATION BETWEEN MEDICAGO SATIVA AND RHIZOBIUM LEGUMINOSARUM AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NITROGENOUS FERTILIZERS
Cole Julian Blum, Michelle Leonetti, 
Long Beach High School, Long Beach, NY

This project, in its present form, measures the efficiency of the relationship that exists between Medicago sativa (alfalfa) plants and Rhizobium leguminosarum bacteria in which symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) occurs. Nitrogenous fertilizers have been found to contaminate ground water supply and decrease SNF efficiency; therefore, bacterial inoculants must be used throughout the world to prevent a food shortage. Given, the addition of nitrogen-fixing bacteria to M. sativa seeds would provide a greater amount of nitrogenous compounds for the plants. Control groups were created with sterile alfalfa seeds, dry apply inoculant groups with a mixture of seeds and dry inoculant, and wet apply groups with a slurry of the inoculant, seeds and distilled water. Plant growth was quantified by measuring the mean length of the 5 tallest stalks for each replicate and plant fresh mass at the completion of growth. Ammonia, nitrate and nitrite levels of the runoff water were measured using water testing analysis. When in contact with each other, the bacteria and alfalfa plants were found to form nodules at the roots at which SNF occurs. Bacterial inoculation was found to have a highly significantly positive effect on plant growth in the dry apply groups and also a significantly positive increase with the wet apply method. Comparison of the control group with nitrogen fertilizer to the dry apply inoculant group showed no significant difference. This supports that dry apply inoculation is an adequate alternative to nitrogenous fertilizers, but at the same time does not have the same environmentally harmful effects. It is now necessary to research the actual commercial and economic feasibility of a gradual integration of bacterial inoculants into the world’s agricultural industry through replacement of nitrogenous fertilizers.

EFFECT OF RHIZOBIUM INOCULUM ON NITROGEN FIXATION OF SNAPBEANS
Casey Eugene Hunewill, Tyler Elliott, 
Smith Valley High School, Smith, NV

In Rural communities, like the one we live in, farmers are always on the lookout for better ways to grow their market crops. Our project deals with a legume, Blue Lake Snap Beans, and the effects that the bacteria Rhizobium has on its roots. Another very popular agricultural crop that utilizes nitrogen fixation is alfalfa. Untreated snap beans were placed into pots of soil that had been subject to two different variables in numerous crosses. The crosses consisted of sterilized vs. non-sterilized soil and whether or not Rhizobium had been added to it. Each variable was replicated fifteen times for accuracy. Our null hypothesis was that the plants with normal soil Rhizobium would produce the most desirable growth. All the Rhizobium soils with plant growth exhibited 100% nodule growth. Unlike the soil without the Rhizobium, these plant roots when observed had 0% nodule growth. The nodules on legumes change atmospheric nitrogen into other compounds of nitrogen, which are beneficial to cellular growth of plant tissues. The symbiotic relationship between root development, soil properties, and the remaining plant growth were directly affected by the inoculated bacteria. Agricultural production of food crops need to be more efficient than ever, we have less land but more people to feed.

INFLUENCE OF TROPICAL SODA APPLE MOSAIC VIRUS ON THE BIOLOGY AND FEEDING BEHAVIOR OF GRATIANA BOLIVIANA
Eloise Jayne Cave, Melody Santana, 
St Lucie West Centennial High School, Port St Lucie, FL

Tropical soda apple (TSA), Solanum viarum, is an exotic plant in pastures in the southeastern United States. A host specific plant virus, tropical soda apple mosaic virus (TSAMV), and a leaf beetle, Gratiana boliviana, are used as biological control agents of this invasive weed. We questioned whether or not the presence of TSAMV in the plant influenced development time, survivorship, leaf consumption by fifth instars, and adult weight of G. boliviana. <br><br> Fourteen Tropical Soda Apple plants were obtained. Seven of them had been previously inoculated with the TSAMV by a scientist at the research institution. We then observed the plants for two weeks for virus symptoms. All seven showed signs of infection and the experiment was initiated. <br><br> First instars of G. boliviana were placed on 7 virus-infected and 7 virus-free TSA plants. Plants were checked twice weekly and the number of larvae and pupae found was recorded. Adults were weighed after emerging from the pupa. <br><br> One fifth instar G. boliviana was placed on each of 10 virus-infected and 10 virus-free TSA leaf disks in Petri dishes. Larvae were removed from the disks 24 hours later. The leaf area consumed by each beetle was measured using Image J software. <br><br> The survival of larvae and pupae to adulthood was greater on virus-free plants (40%) compared to virus-infected plants (25.7%), but these proportions are not statistically different. Development time (~34.5 days) and adult weight (~20.5 mg) were similar between treatments. The leaf area consumed by G. boliviana was three times greater when feeding on virus-free leaves (1.04 sq cm) compared to virus-infected leaves (0.34 sq cm). We conclude that TSAMV does not affect the biology and survivorship of G. boliviana, but the virus does significantly influence the beetle’s feeding behavior by reducing the amount of leaf tissue consumed.

ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI IN SOUTHEAST ALASKA MUSKEGS
Caleb John McGraw, Joshua Vo, 
Mount Edgecumbe High School, Sitka, AK

A variety of muskeg plants located near Sitka, Alaska was surveyed to determine their arbuscular mycorrhizal status. Mycorrhizae can improve plant nutrition so that photosynthesis and carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) sequestration is enhanced. Based on work done on a similar peatland in Canada, our hypothesis is that arbuscular mycorrhizae fungi (AMF) would not be significantly represented in the majority of muskeg plants. Several methods were used to assess the mycorrhizal status of muskeg plants: including root staining, bioassays, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Structures consistent with AMF, including vesicles and arbuscules, were found in 8 of 15 of plants. Bioassays, done by other lab members, showed a very low number of AMF propogules in the soil; AMF spores were found only in the hummock samples. PCR amplification was positive for AMF for 8 of the plants tested. This work indicates that the studied muskeg is different from the peatland in southern boreal Alberta, Canada despite the similar flora. As far as we are aware, this is the first data collected on muskeg AMF in Southeast Alaska.

North Park Collegiate and Vocational School, Brantford, Ontario, CANADA

Flavonoids are newly discovered nutrients, naturally occurring within plants, and thought to have several health benefits for humans. This project examined the effects of Flavonoid enhancement on developing plants (when compared to fertilizer enhanced plants and “control” plants (no addition)), to see whether the addition of Flavonoids in soil could lead to both a more abundant and environmentally friendly harvest.<br><br> Morning Glories, Cracker Jack Marigolds, Bean Bush and Disco Mix Marigolds were chosen based on previous research determining their average germination rate. Using seeds and individual peat pucks, the plants were grown in an enclosed plastic greenhouse, using light energy from a nearby window. The first group of peat pucks contained 250mg of powdered Flavonoid, the second had 1mg of fertilizer, and the “control” group had nothing added. Daily photographic and written observations were made.<br><br> Approximately 75% of the Flavonoid-enhanced plants sprouted first, while the other 25% of the plants had a germination rate equal to the fertilizer-enhanced plant. The Flavonoid-enhanced plants had 100% of the plants grow, compared to fertilizers’ 75% growth and the control plants 50% growth. The Flavonoid-enhanced plant had a much less deficiency rate compared to fertilizers many deficiencies.<br><br> Plants grown with Flavonoids had an increased germination and growth rate. With a quicker germination rate, the addition of Flavonoids would increase crop production, greatly benefiting the agricultural industry. Replacing chemicals with Flavonoids would create a healthier environment while also improving crop quality and would significantly improve crop production worldwide.

NOVEL STOICHIOMETRIC METHOD FOR ANALYSIS OF LEAD ACCUMULATION IN CROPS AND TURF GRASS
Breana Marquette Hashman, Alexandra Huddell, Nicole Thompson
Unionville High School, Kennet Square, PA

We developed a novel method to determine the extent to which fescue grass, rye grass, and dark raven zucchini absorb lead II nitrate (LN). We examined how the presence of LN affects plant development, chlorophyll production, and also quantitatively measured how much LN the plants absorbed.<br><br> <br><br> We began by growing the grasses and zucchini in identical conditions. We exposed the plants to LN in two ways. First, we made .04, .03, .02, .01, and 0 M solutions of LN solutions, and watered our designated plants with the treated solution each weekday. Then second, we mixed the LN in with the soil at concentrations of 100,000, 10,000, 1,000, 100, and 0 ppm of LN. Grasses were planted in replicated groups (n=6 for each treatment) and grown as above. At all concentrations LN reduced germination %, stalk height and standing biomass. We also extracted chlorophyll and other photosynthetic pigments from the grasses and ran samples through a colorimeter to measure absorbance. LN treatment resulted in inhibition of chlorophyll production. <br><br> <br><br> We used sodium sulfide to determine the amount of LN accumulated in the plants. We crushed the plants while adding an acid digest, releasing the lead from its organically-bound state. We then filtered the plant fibers, and added a sodium sulfide solution. In the presence of LN, sodium sulfide forms a dark green precipitate--PbS. We collected and weighed the precipitate. We then used stoichiometry to quantify the absorbed lead. This method allowed us to conclude that lead nitrate accumulates in plants, diminishes plant development, and may have a negative effect on molecules needed for photosynthesis.

OSMOTIC PRIMING AND PH
Geoffrey Nathaniel Bodily, Alexa Crawford, Spencer McDonald
American Fork High School, American Fork, UT

The purpose of this experiment was to establish the effect that osmotic priming has on the germination rates of seeds grown in environments of varying pH levels. The pH of the environment in which a seed is planted can affect its growth by influencing the availability of nutrients to the seed. Certain nutrients, such as potassium and nitrogen, are available to the seed only when the soil of the environment is within a certain range, typically in slightly alkaline environments.<br><br>Osmotic priming is the process of immersing seeds in a solution of chemicals to lower the seed’s osmotic potential. Osmotic potential of a solution is proportional to the concentration of a solute, with greater concentrations of solute resulting in a lower osmotic potential. By lowering the seed’s osmotic potential, the water inside the seed when it is planted is less likely to be lost to its surroundings through osmosis. <br><br>In this experiment, wheat seeds (Tricicum aestivum) were primed in a 5% solution of Polyethylene Glycol 3350 and then planted in environments with a pH of 5, 7.65 (distilled water), or 9. Acidic solutions were created using a serial dilution of Hydrochloric Acid. Alkaline solutions were created by the serial dilution of Sodium Hydroxide, and neutral solution was simply distilled water. After being placed in their environments, which consisted of coffee filters treated with the solution of variable pH and then placed in sealed plastic bags, the specimens were observed daily to determine the rate of germination.<br><br>It was observed that seeds that had been primed had a higher probability of germinating than those that had not been primed in both alkaline and acidic environments, with 3 out of 9 primed seeds vs. 1 of 9 unprimed seeds germinating in the environment with a pH of 5 and 5 out of 9 primed seeds vs. 4 of 9 unprimed seeds germinating in the environment with a pH of 9. No significant impact was observed in seeds planted in an environment of pure distilled water, with both the primed and unprimed samples yielding 8 out of 9 seeds germinating.

Our project is to make Eco-friendly Ink for Color Pens by extracting coloring pigments from various plant species. Color extracts of 150 plant species and its products were tested under sunlight for fading. Out of these, 15 plants like Butea monosperma (Flame of the forest), Beta vulgaris (Beetroot), Basella alba v. rubra (Indian spinach), Curcuma longa (Turmeric), Azardirachta indica (neem), Coffea arabica (coffee), Opuntia ficus indica, Hibiscus rosa-sinensis, Bixa orellana, Indigofera tinctoria (Indigo), Tagetes erecta (Marigold), Trigonella foenum-graecum (Fenugreek), Lawsonia inermis (Henna), and Spinacia oleracea (Spinach) that had not faded in sunlight were selected. <br><br><br>These plants were dried in an oven, dissolved in a proper solvent like water and ethanol, filtered and dried again to get the color pigment like Anthocyanins, Curcumin, Betacyanin and Chlorophyll. Apart from plant extracts, caramel from sugar was also tried as a coloring agent.<br><br>This dried pigment was crushed to powder and diluted to use as ink. Colors like Yellow, Pink, Magenta, Green, Blue, Orange and Coffee were obtained. The ink was refilled in color pens like sketch pens, marker pens, board markers, micro tips and fountain pens. Physical tests like fading in sunlight, writing length and heating effect, showed the aptness to be used as ink. Microbial contamination rate was found negligible and heavy metals were absent. Our research shows the pigment-based ink as an eco-friendly, biodegradable and with results, that compare very well with some of the commercially available pens.

UNFOLDING THE MYSTERY OF TANGLEHEAD GRASS AWN’S TWISTING ABILITY
Chaya Nimchinda, Pradtana Chunhakham, Alisara Srinilta
Triam Udom Suksa School, Bangkok, THAILAND

The seed of tanglehead grass (Heteropogon contortus (L.) P. Beauv.ex Roem. & Schult.) has a hair or bristle like appendage called awn. The awn has an ability to create a twisting motion when exposed to humidity change. We observed that the awn can twist either clockwise or counterclockwise (from the top view) depending on the difference between its moisture level and the atmospheric humidity. If its moisture level is lower than the atmospheric humidity, the awn twists clockwise, as it absorbs moisture from the atmosphere. In contrast, if its moisture level is higher, the awn twists counterclockwise. Our results suggest that this mechanism may be caused by cell wall expansion and contraction. We also investigated the speed of twist by using a circular protractor to measure the angular displacement and calculate the angular velocity. When the awn is exposed to water, it first twists clockwise with an increasing velocity until the velocity reaches its maximum value, then the velocity decreases until the twisting stop. After that as the awn loses moisture it twists counterclockwise with the same velocity behavior. This twisting ability allows awns and seeds to be separated from their inflorescences and spread over the ground for reproduction. We consider the possibility of developing the tanglehead grass awns as a humidity measuring device.

TRANSFORMING IPOMEA BATATAS VIA DIRECT INOCULATION WITH AGROBACTERIUM RHIZOGENES
Leslie Marie Young, Randy Ray, 
Wentville Holt High School, Wentville, MO

The current method for creating transgenic plants is tissue culture, which is difficult and highly labor intensive, requiring approximately nine months to create a transgenic plant.<br><br>The need for a faster, more efficient method can be met by using a technique involving direct inoculation of plant cuttings in rock wool. Ipomoea batatas (sweet potato) cuttings were inoculated with an Agrobacterium rhizogenes construct containing GFP and Gus and placed in rock wool in order to generate transgenic plants. The cuttings were placed in high light and low light growth chambers. The plants developed roots, were replanted in a soilless mix and allowed to grow another six weeks. The plants were then analyzed for development of transgenic roots using fluorescence microscopy for the detection of GFP. Transgenic plants were potted in soil and moved to the greenhouse to develop tubers for later Gus staining. Any tubers resulting from a transgenic root are able to produce an entire transgenic plant. The initial results from GFP analysis demonstrated a rate of efficiency equal to or better than current tissue culture methods, yet the transformation was accomplished in a fraction of the time with a great deal less effort.

MULCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING?
Caylin Faith Drews
McArthur High School, Hollywood, FL

Mulch is used widely today by homeowners and farmers throughout various climates with multiple functions. Today, with going green being so important, and many places having water restrictions, a mulch that will retain moisture would help the environment and people greatly, with the possibility of using recycled materials as mulch. The purpose of this experiment was to determine the ideal mulch for different climates and uses. The independent variables in this experiment are the type of mulch and the bead size (representing various soil particles). The dependent variables are the soil’s temperature and moisture content, the beads’ and mulches’ porosity, and the percentage of germination and root/shoot lengths of the barley. The control has no mulch bed covering.<br><br> Using the ANOVA statistical test, the researcher does not reject the null hypotheses 6 and 7, regarding the porosity of the beads. For the 3mm beads, since fs= 0.2104133334< f05= 2.31, do not reject null, and there is no significant difference between the porosity of the mulches and the control of no mulch. For the 5mm beads, since fs= 0.1105293775< f05= 2.31, do not reject null, and there is no significant difference. For the 8mm beads, since fs= 26.42226975> f05= 2.31, reject null, and there is a significant difference in the porosity. The graphs show Rubber works best in keeping the soil warm, having the highest recorded temperatures. Finally, to have little or no weed or plant growth, Eucalyptus should be used, having a percentage of germination of 0.

COMPARISON OF OPTIMAL PHOTOSYNTHETIC CONDITIONS FOR SUCCESSFUL YIELDS OF BOTRYOCOCCUS BRAUNII AND MONOCHRYSIS LUTHER II
Sarah Elizabeth Sarnoski
Vero Beach High School, Vero Beach, FL

Purpose: determine which algae type Botryococcus braunii or Monochrysis luther ii will produce a greater change in cell count when exposed to various amounts of light. Hypothesis: the algae strand B. braunii when exposed to 24 hours of light will show the greatest increase in cell count.<br><br>Acquire algae, and appropriate types of water. B. braunii requires freshwater and M. luther ii requires saltwater. Using a microscope and a hemocytometer, measure cell count of algae everyday. Perform this with 6, 12, and 24 hours of light exposure per day. Use the data collected to perform the following equation for each test tube of algae. Final algae count minus initial algae count, multiplied by percent lipid content, divided by number of days algae grew. Analyze which algae/light combination showed greatest productivity rate.<br><br>Based on the data the hypothesis is partially accepted. The B.braunii had the greatest productivity when exposed to 24 hours of light. The M. luther ii had the greater productivity when exposed to 6 and 12 hours of light. When exposed to 24 hours of light the M. luther ii had the lowest productivity rate because it exceeded the carrying capacity of its environment. The null hypothesis can be rejected because the amount of light does have a significant effect on the productivity rate of the different algae species.

EVALUATION OF GRAPE DNA SEQUENCE AS BINARY BORDERS FOR AGROBACTERIUM MEDIATED PLANT TRANSFORMATION
Bradley Charles Clement
Lake Brantley High School, Altamonte Springs, FL

The purpose of the experiment was to determine if grape DNA can be used as functional border elements to support insertion of foreign genes into plants and be as effective as bacterial borders in Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The implication of the project is incorporating a plant’s own domestic DNA for genetic engineering instead of using any foreign DNA, which causes great protest to consuming any genetically modified organisms (GMOs). With no more opposition to GMOs, the door will finally be opened to the marketplace for genetically engineered products. The experiment started with cultivation of somatic embryogenic cultures and small tobacco leaves being transformed using both grape borders (GB) and Agrobacterium-borders (AB). After the somatic embryos (SE) were washed with antibiotics for 3 days, and the small tobacco leaves (explants) were washed for 2 days in the dark, the SE were transformed to DMcck medium to culture for 30 days, while the explants were placed on MST medium to be cultured in the light for 3 to 5 weeks. After growth to maturity, record number of both stable tobacco explants and stable callus lines exhibiting GFP fluorescence. After this data had been recorded, PCR was conducted to confirm the physical presence of the transgene expression. The P-value gathered from the 2-proportion z-test of 0.019182 verifies the statistical significance of the somatic embryo results, as any P-value under 0.05 meets this designation. No statistical analysis was needed for the tobacco explants to accept the null hypothesis as both the AB and GB groups had a 100% effective rate.

PLANT COMMUNITIES IN RESPONSE TO ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCE REGIMES ON ARTHROPOD COMMUNITIES: YEAR III
Logan Allan Kostroun
C.H. Yoe High School, Cameron, TX

The purpose of this research was to determine and characterize the effects of plant communities, in response to anthropogenic disturbance regimes, on arthropod communities within a Central Texas Post Oak Savannah ecosystem. The null hypothesis for this research stated that a plant community's diversity, abundance, and species richness would have no effect on an arthropod community’s diversity, abundance, and species richness as a result of different anthropogenic disturbance regimes. When relationships of transect line counts were examined through two stage least squares regression analysis, the data indicated statistically significant relationships among many of the independent and dependent variables with regime sites as statistical instruments, thus the null hypothesis was not supported. <br><br> In the analysis of plant diversity relationships, arthropod diversity and species richness had no relationship, but arthropod abundance exhibited an inverse relationship with a coefficients: -12.335. In the analysis of plant abundance relationships, arthropod species richness had no correlation, but arthropod abundance and diversity exhibited coefficients: .3447 and -.015 respectively. In the analysis of plant richness relationships, arthropod richness had no correlation, but arthropod diversity and abundance exhibited coefficients: .314 and -7.8 respectively.<br><br> In summary and in contrast to typical results, anthropogenic disturbance regimes of tilling and seeding and annual harvesting result in the specialization of the plant species Panicum virgatum, and the arthropod orders, isopoda and hymenoptera. Through this research, an improved knowledge of the Post Oak Savannah ecosystem will lead to better management and protection of the vast rangelands of the world.

AGROECONOMICS: IMPACT OF AGED SUMAC LEAVES ON AGRONOMIC SEED GERMINATION
Elaine Marie Ayers
Winona Senior High School, Winona, MN

In agronomic crops, composting can dramatically increase the crop yield rate, but there is a need for an environmentally friendly compost. Sumac (Rhus spp.) is an easily obtainable hardy shrub that can be found growing in much of the Midwest. In this continuation study the use of Sumac as a compost substrate was examined, specifically determining the optimal age of Sumac leaves at various dilutions tested on the agronomic seeds barley, lettuce, alfalfa, and mustard. Older (red) and newer (green) sumac leaves were collected in Winona, MN, and weighed out into 20 g. samples. These 20 g. of leaf matter were diluted with water into 100%, 50%, 25%, 5%, and 0% (a control containing only water) and allowed to soak. After 1 week, the varying dilutions were added to Petri dishes containing the agronomic seeds and allowed to germinate while covered in aluminum foil. After germination, seeds were counted to determine germination rates. After analyzing rates, it was determined that germination rates were significantly higher when seeds had been in the presence of older Sumac leaves at higher dilutions. This can be explained by the higher amount of pigments in the Sumac solutions, providing a richer environment for seed germination.

VITAMIN C CERTAINTY !
Barnes Christopher Wilken
Middelburg High School, Middelburg E.C., Eastern Cape, SOUTH AFRICA

The purpose of this line of research is to determine whether the amount of Vitamin C increases or decreases following the harvesting of oranges. Different storage types are compared. <br><br>15 oranges are stored at room temperature, 15 oranges in the refrigerator and 15 oranges are left on the tree to compare their Vitamin C levels. The Vitamin C content will be measured from 3 oranges of each storage type on day 1 (harvesting), 2, 4, 8, 14. The technique that will be used is called titration (iodine titration solution).<br><br>An average will be calculated for the 3 oranges of each storage type on the days when tests are done. By using a proportion the amount of Vitamin C will be determine. All results will be recorded in both tabulated and in graphical manner.<br><br>I observed that the Vitamin C content of the oranges stored in the refrigerator increased. Extremely cold weather conditions occurred between day 8 and day 14. The Vitamin C content in the oranges on the tree once again increased. This can be attributed to the low temperatures. The Vitamin C content in the oranges stored at room temperature however gradually decreased. FINAL CONCLUSION: The colder the temperature, the more Vitamin C an orange produces!<br><br>Further research show that there are Amino Acids that are being activated when the peal of the orange is exposed to low temperatures. This causes the production of Vitamin C in the oranges.<br><br>THEREFORE, STORE YOUR ORANGES AT A LOW TEMPERATURE (REFRIGERATOR).

DEVELOPMENT OF POST HARVEST PROPHYLACTIC MICROBIAL WASH TO BE USED ON SOLANUM LYCOPERSICUM
Kelly Howard
The Villages Charter High School, The Villages, FL

The purpose is to develop a post-harvest prophylactic microbial wash that can be used on tomatoes by harvesters to eliminate the pathogenic bacteria, Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. The hypothesis for this project is that an anti-microbial wash can be developed to eliminate pathogenic bacteria on tomatoes post-harvest using d-Limonene Citrus Essential Oil derivative or Citric Acid to eliminate the bacteria, Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp.<br><br> During phase one, disk diffusion and tube cultures were performed using various dilutions of the substances in the study on 0.5 McFarland suspensions of Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. For phase two, tomatoes from roadside vendor were used. Each tomato was labeled and inoculated with one species of bacteria and allowed to air dry. Once dry, the tomatoes were placed into each wash substance dilution for 2 & 5 minutes. Then, each tomato was transferred into a labeled bag containing 100 mL D/E Neutralizing buffer and massaged for 30 seconds. Petrifilms were inoculated with this buffer to obtain colony counts of the remaining viable bacteria.<br><br> The conclusion for this project is that a post-harvest antimicrobial wash for tomatoes can be developed using a more eco-friendly product than Sodium hypochlorite, (the current industry practice). Cold Pressed Valencia Orange Oil and Citric Acid demonstrated the most effective antimicrobial properties against Escherichia coli ATCC25922 and Salmonella spp. The wash developed can be used at any stage in post-harvest, either at the harvester’s farm or packing plant, thus ensuring safe tomato supply.

EISENIA FETIDA VS. EUDRILUS EUGENIAE
Kiyokuni Yamada
Glynn Academy, Brunswick, GA

The researcher wanted to find out a way to efficiently use worms to make fertile soil in addition with recycling food. Thus the researcher bought two different worms, Eisenia fetida, and Eudrilus eugeniae and hypothesized if Eudrilus eugeniae had better, fertile feces than Eisenia fetida’s, then the soil composted with Eudrilus eugeniae would increase the nutrients more than Eisenia fetida. So he got two plastic containers, had put the same amount of beddings and top soil in each container, and dumped 1 lb. of each different worm separately in two containers. Plus, he added about the same amount of food to each container every 3-4 days, and set the containers outside until it got colder. After the researcher added food and renewed the beddings for 2 months, he sent soils of the original top soil, Eisenia fetida’s soil, and Eudrilus eugeniae’s soil to a laboratory that checks soil samples. After another month, he sent the soil samples again to make another result. It showed that in Eudrilus eugeniae’s soil, it had 75 lbs. of P, 868 lbs/Acre of K, 5348 lbs/Acre of Ca, 334.5 lbs/Acre of Mg, 16 lbs/Acre of Zn, and 25 lbs/Acre of Mn whereas in Eisenia fetida’s soil, it had 70.5 lbs/Acre of P, 779.5 lbs/Acre 5028 lbs/Acre of Ca, and 292 lbs/Acre of Mg, and 10 lbs/Acre of Zn, and 10 lbs/Acre of Mn. Therefore ultimately, Eudrilus eugeniae’s soil had more nutrients than Eisenia fetida’s.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE INSECTICIDE USING THE CHEMICAL EXTRACTS OF COMMON YARD PLANTS AND WEEDS
Raymond Tin-Hou La
South Fork High School, Stuart, FL

The purpose of this experiment was to develop an environmentally safe insecticide by using common yard plants and weeds. It was proposed that if chemical extracts found in the Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, Convolvulaceae, Lamiaceae, and Solanaceae families could be used as an insecticide for negative insects, such as Diaprepes abbreviatus (Diaprepes root weevil), Toxoptera citricida (Brown citrus aphid), Bemisia tabaci Biotype B (Silverleaf whitefly), and Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Asian citrus psyllid), without harming the beneficial Hippodamia convergens (Convergent lady beetle) and the host plant Citrus sinensis (orange tree). <br><br>Five insecticide solutions were made, one for each plant family. 10% of the solution was grinded plant material in acetone which helped extract the chemicals. The chemical extracts included alkaloids, tannins, terpenoid, and solanine. The four negative insects, the beneficial insect, and the host plant were sprayed with the five insecticide solutions and an acetone control. The insects were stored in cages and were monitored for a four day period after being sprayed. <br><br>The insecticide solutions did successfully kill all four types of the negative insects. Also, two of the five insecticide solutions did not harm the beneficial H. convergens, and all of the insecticide solutions did not harm the C. sinensis host plant. The D. abbreviatus survived the acetone control demonstrating that the chemical extracts solely killed the insects. The B. tabaci Biotype B, T. citricida, and D. citri may or may not have been killed solely by the chemical extracts because the acetone control was also able to kill the insects.

HOW SMART IS THE COMMON BEAN?: ASSESSING BEAN PLANTS ABLILITY TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN A MODERATE NITROGEN FIXER AND AN IDEAL NITROGEN FIXER
Tiffanie Faye Stone
Academy for Science and Agriculture, Vadnais Heights, MN

Legumes are a good source of plant-based protein for the world. Nodules form a symbiotic relationship with legumes by fixing nitrogen which is essential for plant growth. Nodules that don’t produce any nitrogen for the plant get sanctioned, or cut off from the plants resources. My purpose was to see if Phaseolus vulgaris (common bean) selectively chooses an ideal nitrogen fixer (SAM100) over a fat hoarding nitrogen fixer (CE3). <br><br>It was hypothesized that the bean plants will give more of its resources to the SAM100 strain because it will store up no PHB (nodule fat) and thus produce more nitrogen for the plants. In conjunction, the CE3 strain will be sanctioned, because it will be competing with a strain far superior in fixing nitrogen than itself.<br><br>Testing was done with bean plants in split pouches: half inoculated with Ce3, the other half Ce3 on one side and SAM100 on the other. About 800 nodules were identified using antibiotic plates. PHB was verified using flow cytometery on ten random nodules from each side of each plant. If they couldn’t be identified, PCR was used to identify the strain. <br><br>The fat hoarding rhizobia were 46.89 percent worse off when competing with the ideal strain. Plant weight also increased when the ideal strain was present, supporting my hypothesis. This supports evidence that plants have partial sanctions. Phaseolus vulgaris can monitor the different degrees of nitrogen they are receiving from individual nodules. Understanding this symbiotic relationship can help manipulate it; thus increasing plant yields.

USING YEAST TWO HYBRID SYSTEM TO IDENTIFY THE PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTION BETWEEN RXO1 AND XOC-AVRRXO1
Tian Zhou
Blacksburg High School, Blacksburg, VA

Maize Rxo1 encodes a nucleotide binding site (NBS)-leucine rich repeat (LRR) resistance protein and recognizes Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc), which carries an avirulence gene Xoc-avrRxo1, triggering a hypersensitive response(HR). In this study, yeast two-hybrid system (Y2H) was employed to determine whether Rxo1 directly or indirectly interacts with Xoc-AvrRxo1. To this end, Rxo1 and Xoc-avrRxo1 and their different fragments as well as their putative interactor genes were cloned into Y2H prey and bait vectors, respectively, by LR reactions. The twenty clones were confirmed by colony PCR and restriction enzymes. The resulting constructs were co-transformed into yeast AH109 cells by chemical method and screened on selective plates. The eighteen positive co-transformants were employed for mating testing using beta-galactosidase assay. The results showed that Rxo1 physically interacts with Xoc-AvrRxo1 at the NBS domain but not the LRR domain. Xoc-AvrRxo1 directly interacts with its chaperone ORF2 at the C-terminal. Furthermore, a putative rice transcription factor B116 directly interacts with Rxo1 in Y2H, indicating that it may play a role in rice disease resistance mediated by Rxo1. The results also showed that an ORF2 structure-like protein in Nicotiana benthamiana Nb-Ain1 physically interacts with Xoc-AvrRxo1, indicating that it may function in the pathogenesis of Xoc. These findings will help understand the action mechanism of Rxo1/Xoc-avrRxo1 and explain why this system functions in monocots and dicots and how Xoc-avrRxo1 suppresses plant basal defense system. Rxo1/avrRxo1 system can also be applied in generating transgenic plants to control tomato bacterial spot, watermelon fruit blotch and sorghum stripe diseases that pathogens carry Xoc-avrRxo1 homologs.

USING BACILLUS SUBTILIS TO CONTROL SEPTORIA AND BLOSSOM DROP
John Jacob Register
Austin High School, Austin, MN

There are no known resistant indeterminate Solanum lycopersicum varieties to the foliar disease Septoria. This disease defoliates plants leading to economic loss from reduced yields, and damaged fruit. To date, diagnosis of this disease has been limited to the visual observance of black fruiting spores on the leaves found shortly after first fruits set. Blossom drop is a condition caused by stress, heat, insects etc.<br><br>In this continuation experiment, an indeterminate variety of Solanum lycopersicum was studied. Twenty control trials were compared to twenty trials that were sprayed weekly with an ultra violet stabile strain of Bacillus subtilis, a naturally occurring bacterium. Applications began June first. Ten clusters per trial were marked with corresponding thread and observed, counting both blossom numbers per cluster and fruit set. The control trials showed disease damage three months before the B. subtilis trials. Early samples were sent to two laboratories to be tested. No other diseases or nutrient deficiencies were found. All ripe fruit was harvest, weighed, and recorded by date and trial number.<br><br>T scores showed significant differences between the B. subtilis trials and the control trials. Blossoms produced and fruit set were the most notable, proving septoria attacks the blossoms early in the season, before stem and leaf damage become visible. Blossom drop was also significantly reduced. T tests for fruit numbers and weight were also performed and found to be statistically significant proving again that this strain of B. subtilis will control the damage caused by septoria.

MARINE MICROALGAE AS A NEW RESOURCE FOR BIODIESEL PRODUCTION
Yu Gao
Xiamen No.1 High School of Fujian, Xiamen, Fujian, CHINA

Biodiesel is a kind of renewable energy resource with great potential. Marine microalgae have significant advantages for biodiesel production such as having rich resource and high oil content. In the present study, 13 species of marine diatom were isolated and their growth, lipid content and fatty acid were determined. The result shows that all of the 13 diatom species have high lipid content, the highest value is 36.2% in Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Aiming on high biofuel production, four species of red tide diatoms with high growth rate and high content of lipid and saturated fatty acid were finally selected. They are Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Thalassiosira pseudonana, Chaetoceros curvisetus and Skeletonema tropicum. Biodiesel was successfully produced by lipid extraction and esterification using the 4 diatoms with the production rate up to 19.4%. The calorific value of the biodiesel was 35.8MJ/kg and its Pb content is 3.41 mg/kg which is not out of the standard value. This study shows the great feasibility and potential of using marine microalgae, especially the red-tide species and mud diatoms, as a new resource for producing biodiesel, and the advantage of turning mass red tide diatom into biodiesel, as well as its obvious economic benefit and application prospects.

HOW DO SOIL MICROORGANISMS AFFECT PLANT GROWTH?
Marcus Amiel Ynalvez
J.B. Alexander High School, Laredo, TX

Soil microorganisms have a prominent effect on plant growth mainly due to their dominant presence in soil. The problem is that such effects can be both detrimental and beneficial to plants. This study aims to determine whether these microorganisms have a more tendency to have a positive or negative effect on plant growth.<br><br>In the performed experiment a control experiment was used: CP/N- the control group with soil microorganisms; CP/S- the experimental group without the presence of soil microorganisms. Soil samples in both setups were obtained from the same site. In order to eliminate the microorganisms for CP/S the soil was placed in an autoclave. The experimental plants were Cow Pea beans. CP/N consisted of three identical pots with two Cow Pea beans in each pot, in three repetitions. Setup 2 consisted of similar materials and repetitions. <br><br>Throughout the duration of 18 days, plant heights and leaf size were measured at the same time and observations of the plant's physical health were documented. It was previously hypothesized that the elimination of soil microorganisms would yield healthier and faster growing Cow Pea plants, the reason being that pathogens were killed in the autoclave. Based on the experimental data, the average heights of the plants in CP/N (with soil microorganism) had higher growth rates (average height= 13.024 cm as opposed to Setup 2’s average= 10.828 cm). Furthermore the leaves of CP/N were larger than that of CP/S. Throughout this study, possible human errors and other factors that could have led to inaccuracies in the results were limited by having three sets in each setup and a repetition of 3.

THE EFFECT OF TRACE ELEMENTS ON POINSETTIA GROWTH
Carson Elizabeth Holstein
Batesburg-Leesville High School, Batesburg-Leesville, SC

Poinsettias are grown in greenhouses as potted plants for the Christmas holiday season. The leaf bracts are prized for their red or colored pigment for ornamental purposes. This change of color occurs during the short day lengths of fall and winter. Growers apply soluble fertilizer containing Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K) through the watering system to ensure optimum vegetative growth of the plants. This experiment compared the vegetative growth of plants grown with N-P-K fertilizer alone and with N-P-K fertilizer including micronutrients Molybdenum (Mo) and Zinc (Zn).<br><br> Three cuttings per pot were grown in a greenhouse where the temperature was maintained between 70 degrees F and 80 degrees F. Plants received water only for 10 days after transplanting. Each treatment will be applied to 5 pots and replicated 3 times for a total of 45 pots of poinsettia cuttings. Plants received fertilizer treatments every 3 days. Measurements indicated plants were taller and had larger bract diameters when fertilized with N-P-K plus Mo and Zn. Internode length or the distance between leaves however was the shortest for plants fertilized with N-P-K plus Mo and Zn and longest for plants receiving N-P-K fertilizer alone.<br><br> Poinsettias are priced and valued by consumers based on plant height and the size of the red bracts. This experiment showed that growth was improved with the addition of Molybdenum and Zinc to the fertilizer program.

EXPRESSION OF FLORAL MADS-BOX GENES IN THE ARISTOLOCHIACEAE FAMILY
Jennifer Beth Fasman
Mamaroneck High School, Mamaroneck, NY

The ABC Model of floral development divides the genes for floral growth and differentiation into three categories, A, B, and C. The majority of these genes are members of the MADS-box gene family. The ABC Model was based on studies of Arabidopsis thaliana and Antirrhinum majus, which evolved relatively recently, and may not apply to earlier plant groups such as the basal angiosperms. My study created gene expression profiles of FUL, PI, SEP3, and AP3 MADS-box genes for three species of Aristolochiaceae, a family of basal angiosperms. Expression profiles were created using RNA extraction from individual floral organs, followed by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reactions. PCR products were run through gel electrophoresis, soaked in ethidium bromide, and photographed under UV light. The resulting photographs were analyzed by hand for the presence of bright bands indicating gene expression. The expression profiles confirmed that expression of MADS-box genes in Aristolochiaceae was mostly in accordance with the ABC Model.

TO CULTIVATE SUGAR CANE EVALUATION
Rhael Fernandes
Escola Dr. Dante Pazanezze, Formoso do Araguaia - Tocantins, BRASIL

This project has the objective of defining varieties of sugarcane with more productivity and content of total soluble solids (content of sugar in the plant). These varieties must be adapted to conditions of climate and soil of the south of Tocantins state. In this region there are low income farmers who need to develop new technologies of animal feeding during the drought periods (from May to October) in order to prevent the cattle from loosing weight and die. Farmers from that region need also to select a certain variety of sugarcane that better attends the sugarcane industry.<br><br>Consequently, the selection of the best sugarcane varieties deserves special attention from the farmers because these varieties should be able to generate green mass rich in sugar that will work appropriately with the cattle feeding and the sugarcane industries. <br><br>The lack of data on sugarcane productivity in that region motivated this project which analyzed seven varieties of sugarcane on the Canuanã School. During the process of development of the plants the following items were analyzed: number of plants per area, stalks height and width, production of green mass per area, tillering dynamics, blooming and content of sugar.<br><br>At the end of the project it was possible to observe the varieties which better adapted and presented better results in terms of productivity. The variety IAC 862210 had the best productivity per hectare with 113888 kg/ha and content of sugar of 23o Brix.

Academia del Perpetuo Socorro, San Juan, PUERTO RICO

The purpose of my project was to observe the percentage of surviving plants after asexually propagating the Bastardiopsis eggersii. This process will complete the first step in taking it off the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service list of extinct plants. The hypothesis claimed that if the Bastardiopsis eggersii was successfully asexually propagated, there would be enough specimens to sexually reproduce the plant with plants from other islands, and have the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reevaluate its status as an extinct plant. The method for propagation employed is called air layering. Air layering allows the new plant to grow roots while still on its original rootstock. The constant and controls in my project were: the growth hormones, Indole-3-Butryric Acid- 8% concentration, placed on the cut section of the branch, the black plastic bags, the promix and water (250mL). The dependent variable in my experiment was the growth of new roots to asexually propagate the plants. The independent variable is the growth hormones, Indole-3-Butryric Acid- 8% concentration, placed on the cut section of the branch. The results of this experiment were completely positive. 38 of the 42 roots grew, and 38 of 38 plants survived when planted. The results of the hypothesis should be recognized since 38 plants can be used to sexually reproduce with plants that could be found in other islands in the Caribbean. A future continuation of this experiment could involve sexually reproducing the plants with specimens found in other Eastern Caribbean islands in order to change its extinct status.

THE EFFECTS OF SEAWATER PH ON KELP (SACCHARINA LATISSIMA) SPORE GERMINATION
Colin Zheng
Juneau-Douglas High School, Juneau, AK

As we release more CO2 into our atmosphere, our oceans are becoming more acidic. This drop in pH may cause a decline or increase in the population of organisms, which could indirectly affect us. To see the effect of this change in ocean acidity, I studied how seawater pH affects a certain algae, Saccharina latissima (formerly called Laminaria saccharina). <br><br> Spores of one fertile alga plant were released into well plates filled with seawater. Spore germination percent and lengths of spores were measured through pictures taken from under a microscope. The seawater was replaced often. While growing, the sporelings were kept in an incubator with a constant temperature and lighting. The data collected was used to determine the growth rates and germination percentages. <br><br> The results supported part of my hypotheses: there was a decrease in the percentage of spores germinating with an increase in acidity. The pH with the highest germination percentage was pH 7 (67.4%), followed by pH 8 (67.2%), pH 6(37.1%), and pH 5 (19.1%). The standard deviation from the regression line was small, and a single factor (pH) ANOVA test resulted in a p-value of <0.05. <br><br> My data did not support the other part of my hypotheses: the pH level does not affect the growth rate. The growth rates of each pH level were extremely close together and there was no pattern between the growth rate and the pH. This conclusion was further backed up with a two factor (time and pH) ANOVA test with replication (p-value>0.05).

HOW DO SUPERMARKET TOMATOES COMPARE IN LYCOPENE? A THREE YEAR STUDY
Taylor Kade Runyan
Atoka High School, Atoka, OK

Most people are aware of the effects of UV light though painful sunburns, but more important is that repeated sunburns can lead to skin cancer. Human and plants have built in protection against UV radiation. Red tomatoes contain lycopene, a pigment that helps prevent cell damage and skin cancer. In previous years I measured lycopene in supermarket tomatoes and found that lycopene was highest in the grape and cherry types. This year, I determined that synthetic lycopene and lycopene in tomatoes blocks UV light. I tested synthetic lycopene and natural lycopene to see which blocks UV light more affectively. Sunscreen prevents the direct DNA damage, which causes sunburn. Some sunscreen lotions include compounds such as titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, and avobenzone, which helps protect against UVA rays. UVA, UVB, and UVC can damage collagen fibers and accelerate aging of the skin. I wanted to determine if lycopene is simply a physical barrier to ultraviolet radiation or if it alters genetic response to radiation. To test the ability of lycopene to protect against UV energy, I performed a test with UV sensitive paper and showed that both synthetic and natural sources of lycopene blocks UV energy. Synthetic lycopene was easier to use and was more concentrated. I then fractionated the various fraction of ground tomato (i.e.- juice, lycopene, cellular debris) and demonstrated that the UV blocking was best in the lycopene fraction. The ability for lycopene to protect at the genetic level will be tested next year.

THE IDENTIFICATION OF ENZYMES USED IN SALVIA DIVINORUM TO PRODUCE SALVINORIN A
Angela Marie Schlegel
Tucson High Magnet School, Tucson, AZ

Salvia divinorum (Labiateae) is a sage found in Oaxaca, Mexico where it has been used by the Mazatec Indians to treat such ailments as headaches, rheumatism, coughs, and digestive issues. The main compound it produces is the diterpenoid salvinorin A, a potent and exclusive Kappa-opioid (KOP) receptor agonist. KOP receptor antagonists could represent treatments for a variety of diseases, including diseases where hallucinations are prominent, certain dementias with hallucinogenic aspects, and various drug addictions. Previous research indicates that salvinorin A is produced through the MEP/DOXP pathway and a biosynthetic pathway for salvinorin A and its analogs has been proposed, although most of the enzymes involved have not been fully identified and characterized. This study attempts to elucidate the remaining sequences of each enzyme and characterize those enzymes by utilizing 5’ and 3’ RACE and nested RACE or Genome Walking to amplify unknown portions of each gene, cloning and sequencing the resulting amplicons, constructing full-length genes from the resulting data, and amplifying, expressing, and testing the full-length enzymes for substrate specificity. RACE and nested RACE have produced products of the expected size for three genes; of those, two acetyltransferases revealed incomplete 5’ ends and one dehydrogenase showed a complete 3’ end.

SONORA SOLAR SOLUTION
Ebaa Al-Obeidi
Canyon Del Oro High School, Oro Valley, AZ

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are biomimetic photovoltaics that offer many intriguing possibilities and present a novel approach to renewable energy. This project focused on determining whether there is a uniquely heat-resistant and highly efficient pigment in the flora of the Sonoran Desert that can outperform the synthetic dyes currently used in photovoltaics. <br><br> Pigments were extracted from a variety of cacti leaves and fruits and used to paint the TiO2 film of the DSSCs. Using a multimeter, the voltage and current of the subsequent solar cells were measured. The absorption spectrum of each extract was produced using a standard spectrophotometer, and the characteristic absorption peaks was correlated with voltage and current performance. The thermal durability of the cells was tested by exposing them to 50˚C for a total of two hours, and periodically assessing the voltage and current they could still produce. <br><br> It was found that absorption peaks in the blue-green region of the visible light spectrum directly corresponded to relatively high voltage and current production. Also, the pink prickly pear-derived solar cell appeared to maintain constant performance despite heating, while the blackberry cell’s performance degraded. Thus, pigments derived from local xerophytes hold great potential for the generation of renewable energy in Arizona and across the world.

GENETIC TRANSFORMATION OF A BIOMASS ENERGY PLANT - ARUNDO DONAX L
Shireen Dhir
Houston County High School, Warner Robins, GA

Arundo donax L. (Giant reed) is a non-food, perennial grass that resembles bamboo. Arundo donax is a valuable source of cellulose for rayon and paper pulp. Recently, this plant has been used in phyto-remediation, in particular, for Phosphorus, Cadmium and Nickel uptake potential and biomass production for energy purposes in contaminated sites. Traditional large-scale propagation requires a significant amount of time and effort to successfully establish the plants. Also, this technique provides limited opportunity for genetic manipulation as in the case of seeds; there is no genetic control of the resulting progeny. An optimized bombardment protocol to introduce DNA in embryogenic cells was developed. Optimization of the physical and biological parameters on transient gene expression was carried out under the following conditions: helium pressure, distance from the macrocarrier to stopping screen, and from stopping screen to target tissue, and vacuum pressure together with other factors such as gold microparticles size, and the number of bombardments, on affecting the delivery and expression of ß-glucuronidase (GUS) and Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) genes in embryogenic cells. The highest transient GUS and GFP genes expression was obtained when cells were bombarded twice at 1100 psi, 9cm target distance, 24 mmHg pressure, 1 mm gold particle size, 1.5 mg DNA per bombardment, three days preculture prior to bombardment and six days post bombardment. This is the first report of optimization of particle bombardment (physical and biological parameters) which allowed high-efficiency of DNA delivery combined with minimum damage to target giant reed tissues.

LEAF IT TO PLANTS: THE HYPERACCUMULATION OF HEAVY METALS INTO PLANT BIOMASS THROUGH PHYTOREMDIATION
Jared Christopher Saunders
Weber High School, Pleasant View, UT

Phytoremediation is a technique that uses plant biomass to remove heavy metals from contaminated soil. Several plants have been identified that will hyperaccumulate heavy metals, but few of these have been identified as plants that are commonly available to the public. This research was conducted to evaluate several plants common to local gardens. Sunflowers (Helianthus annus), ivies (Hedera helix), cosmos (Cosmos bipinnatus), and petunias (Petunia x hybridia) were purposely grown in soil contaminated with known quantities of copper and zinc. The plants were grown in the contaminated media for a period three and six weeks. A portion of the plant was harvested, dried, and analyzed using x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy to determine the quantity of copper and zinc that had been transferred from the soil to the plant biomass. Results indicated sunflower, cosmos, and ivy exhibited some phytoremediation characteristics as indicated by the amount, as high as 150 µg/g of heavy metals in the leaves and stems. Petunias had a much lower amount of accumulation of the contaminants with results barely observed above the detection capability of the technique. Sunflowers performed the best at hyperaccumulating the chosen contaminants. The data supported that common plants can be used to remove heavy metal contaminants from polluted areas as three out of the four subjects evaluated demonstrated phytoremediating qualities that may prove beneficial.

THE EFFECTS OF PHARMACEUTICAL WATER CONTAMINATION ON PHASEOLUS VULGARIS
Cassandra LeAnne Carlisi
Northridge High School, Layton, UT

The concern of effluent water from treatment facilities containing pharmaceuticals is growing. Recent scientific studies have found trace amounts of pharmaceuticals, such as analgesics, hormones, and psychotropic drugs building in our water systems. This contamination has also been found in ground water, lakes, rivers, and drinking water as well. The purpose of this experiment is to determine the effect of over the counter pharmaceuticals on Phaseolus Vulgaris. This experiment explored the effect of salicylic acid, dyphenhydramine, ranitidine, and ibuprofen on P.Vulgaris, a bean. It was conducted in four separate trials. Each of four different medications was dissolved in distilled water in two concentrations, 300ppm and 600ppm. Control plants received distilled water only. Each of the experimental plants received water solution containing one of four medications, and in one of two concentrations. The plants were monitored for growth rate, height, leaf size, deformities, and spotting. Control plants averaged 55.8cm height and salicylic acid exposed plants averaged 57cm in height. Plants exposed to dyphenhydramine averaged 26.7cm height, ranitidine exposed plants averaged 32.8cm, and ibuprofen exposed plants averaged 5.2cm. All solutions, with the exception of salicylic acid, were detrimental to plant health on three or more of the plant health indicators which were monitored. Salicylic acid, a naturally occurring plant compound, appeared to have a positive effect on plant growth. Farms are often irrigated by the effluent from treatment plants, or from ground, or river waters. Accumulation of medications in water systems may have long term detrimental effects, as we all live downstream.

ALIENS IN OUR MIDST: A STUDY OF EMERALD ASH BORER ACTIVITY IN DELAWARE COUNTY, OHIO
Miriam Tabak Gibbs
Rutherford B. Hayes High School, Delaware, OH

This project was developed to survey Emerald Ash Borer (EAB) activity in Delaware County, Ohio, and was created around the question of how the EAB is spreading throughout the county. It was hypothesized that the closer the site was to the first EAB detection site on US Route 23, the more infested that site would be, and that the infestations would decrease in severity as they progressively moved outwards from the US Route 23 corridor. To test this hypothesis, 50 mature trees with a DBH (Diameter at Breast Height) higher than 5 centimeters from each of eight wooded sites in Delaware County and one in Franklin County were surveyed for evidence of EAB presence. EAB exit holes, woodpecker damage, other ash-boring insect exit holes, epicormic sprouts, and bark splitting, were measured. The percentage of trees at each site with individual symptoms was then calculated. The relationship between the evidence of symptoms at each site and the distance from both the originally detected EAB positive site in Delaware County and the US Route 23 corridor was then examined. The resulting graph showed that the farther away from the originally detected infestation site in Delaware County and the US Route 23 corridor the sites were, the higher the overall infestation rate of the trees was. The negative correlation was very weak, leaving the hypothesis vaguely supported. The distribution may be due to random spreading of the EAB by firewood or vehicular transportation, or undetected EAB infestations inside and outside of Delaware County.

PHYLOGENY OF THE TAXACEAE INFERRED FROM PHYTOCHROME SEQUENCES
Mark Adrian Chonofsky
Lexington High School, Lexington, MA

Taxaceae phylogeny, now increasingly important as some species are identified for anti-cancer medication, has long been in doubt. With the advent of molecular systematics, knowing the exact phylogeny of these groups has also become necessary.<br><br> PHYP, PHYN1, and PHYN2 genes were sequenced for eleven Taxad species, and Bayesian, maximum likelihood, and maximum parsimony methods were used to infer phylogeny. Strong support was found for a monophyletic clade of Taxaceae and Cephalotaxaceae and for three lineages within it: Torreya and Amentotaxus (Torreyeae Janchen); Taxus, Austrotaxus, and Pseudotaxus (Taxeae Janchen); and Cephalotaxus. Most importantly, strong support was found (p = 0.95 using Bayesian inference, parsimony bootstrap 0.94) for the Cephalotaxus lineage as the most basal lineage.<br><br> Software was developed to perform an SOWH test in order to check the maximum likelihood analyses. The test rejects the null hypothesis that Cephalotaxus and the Torreyeae are more closely related than the Torreyeae and the Taxeae (p < 0.01). <br><br> BEAST was used to estimate divergence times, and the analysis found that the common ancestor of Cephalotaxus is more recent than the common ancestors of the Taxeae and Torreyeae. Sciadopitys dates to the Devonian. <br><br> Finally, maximum likelihood inference of types of selection indicates differences in the type of selection occurring on each exon in PHYN1.<br><br> The conclusions are twofold. First, the Cephalotaxaceae and the Taxaceae are clearly shown to be monophyletic for the first time. Second, the data have implications for the ancestral range and type of selection occurring on the plants and genes involved.

HOW DOES STORAGE TEMPERATURE AFFECT SEED GERMINATION AND GROWTH?
Cali Jane Warner
Dartmouth High School, Dartmouth, MA

During a seed’s dormancy or storage, it may be exposed to extreme temperatures, such as a fallen acorn enduring a New England winter. This research was conducted to determine the relationship between the temperature under which seeds are stored and their subsequent germination and growth rates. It was hypothesized that there would be no growth at -85ºC and the best growth at -17ºC to 1ºC.<br><br> Three hundred and twenty Black Oak, English Oak, Blue Lake Beans and Sunflower seeds were stored at four temperatures, -85ºC, -17ºC, 1ºC and 38ºC, for four weeks. Afterwards, the samples were removed and germinated at 18ºC. After germination, the seedlings were planted and the growth observed and measured. Growth was defined as stem height from the surface of the soil to the base of the first true leaves. <br><br> Neither species of Oak grew to the first true leaves stage; only one sample germinated. The majority of both the beans and Sunflowers successfully germinated and grew. Beans stored in the 38ºC environment had a significantly lower percent germination rate; however, growth was not significantly hindered. The tallest bean seedlings were from -85ºC, -17ºC, 38ºC, then 1ºC. The Sunflower seedlings’ average heights were greatest when stored at 38º C, then -85ºC, 1ºC, and lastly -17ºC. <br><br> The results show that the storage temperature did in fact have a significant impact on the later stages of the seed’s life. Therefore results obtained from this experiment can be considered when planning to store seeds for an extended period of time.

ALGAE GROWTH
Mallory Anne Eitel
La Plata R-II, La Plata, MO

Algae are non-vascular plants that grow in all ponds. They are extremely important, being a major source of oxygen and food for animals living in the pond. Oil from chlorella algae can be turned into a biofuel that can be used as an alternative fuel source. Algae is the fastest growing plant, and an acre of chlorella algae can produce 10,000 gallons of fuel a year compared to 50 gallons from an acre of soy beans. Chlorella algae is also one of the healthiest plants for people to consume as it is filled with nutrients and is an excellent immune system builder. <br><br>Purpose: To determine the effect of different amounts of plant fertilizer on algae growth. <br><br>Procedure: Fill six jars with 300.0 ml of distilled water and 10.0 ml of algae; put two half peas in Jars 1-5. Add fertilizer (2.5 ml, 5.0 ml, 7.5 ml, and 10.0 ml) to Jars 1-4. Use Jar 5 & 6 as baseline and post-control. Measure suspended solids in Jar 6 for baseline algae population. Take dissolved oxygen readings (DO) bi-weekly; conclude experiment when DO levels drop. Measure suspended solids in Jars 1-5. <br><br>Data: The algae grew in all of the samples, ranging from 200% to 858%; but the fertilizer stunted the algae’s natural growth. The control sample had the greatest growth (i.e., 858%); and as the concentration of fertilizer increased, the growth rate decreased. <br><br>Conclusions: Miracle Gro plant fertilizer stunts algae growth. Additional research is needed to identify a non-toxic fertilizer.

THE EFFECTS OF PLASTIC STORAGE BAGS ON APPLES
Lynnae Osher Garner
Pine Bluff High School, Pine Bluff, AR

The purpose of this project was to compare green bags and foodhandler bags which are like a store-brand bag. I was trying to determine which bag type would keep red apples fresher the longest. I hypothesized that the green bags would keep apples fresher and also sweeter the longest. I bought sixty-three red apples, ten green bags, and ten foodhandler bags. I put holes in five of the green bags and five of the foodhandler bags and then put three apples into each of the bags for a total of thirty apples. I left three apples out of the bags to see how they would compare to the apples that were stored in bags.<br><br> I monitored the starting weight, sugar, color and pressure of the apples. Then, each Monday, for a four week period, I took data to see if anything had changed. Weight was measured using a Mettler Toledo Balance. Sugar content was measured using the Palm Abbe Digital Refractometer MISCO. I took the color by using the Pocketspec. I took pressure by using the Qualitest HPE. From the results of my four weeks of research, I have concluded that the green bags by Debbie Meyer are a better type of storage bag for red apples than the Foodhandler Bags.

This project is the cultivation of edible mushrooms as a safe source for nutraceuticals. The outcome of the project is to determine the naturally produced amounts of enzyme inhibitors, lipid peroxide inhibitors, and the active components in mushrooms and the positive effects they provide. The success of the results suggests that consumption of Black Poplar, Shiitake and Oyster mushrooms are very beneficial to health.<br><br>The mycelium extracts and multiple generic medicines were tested with multiple In Vitro inhibitory tests to reveal the Cyclooxygenase (COX) I and II percent inhibition and the lipid peroxidation (LPO) inhibition. These tests resulted in multiple data sets showing that the mycelium extracts produce high levels of inhibition for both COX isoenzymes and the LPO. <br><br>The ethyl acetate fractions from the mycelium extracts were then purified further and tested for their fatty acid components. The purification of the acetate fractions yielded: Linoleic acid, ergosterol, ergosterol peroxide and sphingolipids.<br><br>The consumption of these mushrooms has many medicinal qualities and can be beneficial to health. The active components in the tested mushrooms can potentially ascribe to be Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) based on this research and previous tests.

Grove High School, Grove, OK

Which pungent botanical is most toxic to mosquito larva, lumbriculus (segmented worms) and flour beetles? The flowers and leaves of the following pungent botanicals are being tested: marigold, lantana, chrysanthemum, daisy and geranium. <br><br> It is hypothesized that all solutions will be more toxic to each organism than the control of spring water. It is further hypothesized that the chrysanthemum and daisy solutions with be the most toxic.<br><br> A toxicity test was performed on mosquito larva and lumbriculus with three strengths of solutions; 2mg/mL, 1mg/mL and .5mg/mL. Flour beetles had one concentration; .5 grams of flower or leaf powder with one gram of all-purpose flour. <br><br>Lantana flowers had the highest toxicity to mosquito larva, followed by daisy leaves. Daisy leaves were the most toxic to the flour beetles, and lantana leaves had the highest lethality to lumbriculus variegates. <br><br> Although the hypotheses are not fully supported, the results may lead to a natural insecticide that is easily used.

THE EFFECT OF SELECTED WEEDS EXTRACTS ON THE IMMUNITY OF PINTO BEANS USING A TOBACCO MOSAIC VIRUS ASSAY
Misha Ann Kearns
North Toole County High School-Sunburst, Sunburst, MT

The primary purpose of this experiment was to determine the effects of selected weed extracts on the immunity of pinto beans using a Tobacco Mosaic Virus assays. The secondary purpose was to test the effects on the plant’s growth and development, including plant germination rates, percentages of flowering stalks, and plant heights. My methods include collecting weed samples, growing and water plants with assigned extracts, inoculating bean plants with TMV virus, counting lesions, and gathering other data in relation to the plants maturity. <br><br> <br><br>I hypothesized that the extracts would produce a significant difference in the growth and development of the plant and that the growth of plants would be hindered by the weed extracts because weeds are known to interfere with crop growth. On the other hand, weeds are known survivors and grow under adverse conditions. It was also expected that the weed extracts would inhibit the expression of the Tobacco Mosaic Virus on the bean plants. I discovered that the group watered with Kochia and Leafy Spurge extracts had significantly less lesions. For plant heights, the Sage and Canadian Thistle groups were significantly taller then any of the other groups. After analyzing my data, I rejected my expected hypothesis in reference to plant height; some of the weed extracts enhanced the growth of the bean plants. I rejected the expected hypothesis because there was not a significant difference in germination of the plants and the production of flowering stalks when an adverse effect was actually expected.

USE OF CLEISTANTHUS COLLINUS AND AZADIRACHTA INDICA TO CONTROL THE GERMINATION OF PARTHENIUM IN WHEAT FIELDS
Shireen Chandraprakash Jaiswal
Centre Point School, Nagpur, Maharashtra, INDIA

Parthenium hysterophorous (Parthenium) is a fast growing weed that poses a major threat to crop plants. Further, Parthenium also causes harm to cattle and humans due to its allergic properties. Like any other weed, Parthenium reduces the yield of crop thus adversely affecting the economy. Although commercial herbicides are available in market but they often present a threat to environment. Thus, there is a strong need to find an eco-friendly herbicide against Parthenium. In my project I have conducted a study to to assess the potential of two plants Cleistanthus collinus (Garadi) and Azadirachta indica (Neem) as herbicides to control Parthenium. Though the poisonous nature of the Garadi plant has been documented in Indian traditional knowledge there is very little scientific study on the use of Garadi especially as a herbicide. Neem is a common plant in India, widely studied and known for its medicinal properties. The extract of the leaves of these plants was used to treat the seeds of Parthenium (a weed) and Wheat (a crop plant). The effect of various doses of the extract was studied on germination of seeds, seedling height, root/shoot ratio, vigour index and germination rapidity. Initially a hydroponic study was carried out to determine the most effective dose of the extract. The final experiments were carried out in pots for study the overall effect of the extracts. In addition to this, the effect of leaf residue was also studied. It was found that combination of Garadi and Neem extract was most effective in suppressing the germination of parthenium seeds with simultaneous growth promoting activity on wheat

ATTACK OF THE NATIVE: EVALUATING HOW THE EXPANDING SMILAX ROTUNDIFOLIA AFFECTS A GRASSLAND MICROBIAL SOIL COMMUNITY AS MEASURED BY THE GROWTH OF SCHIZACHYRIUM SCOPARIUM
Rachel Elizabeth Newmiller
Upper Dublin High School, Fort Washington, PA

Plants can change the characteristics of the soil in which they grow, including the structure and function of the soil microbial community. A greenhouse experiment was performed to determine if the expanding native plant species, Smilax rotundifolia, commonly called greenbriar, has altered the soil microbial communities of an Eastern serpentine grassland in such a way as to impact the growth of native grasses, preventing grasses from re-colonizing areas overtaken by greenbriar. <br><br> The experiment examined how Schizachyrium scoparium (little bluestem, LBS) growth was affected by different microbial fractions from soil collected in the grassland or in greenbriar thickets. Seedlings were grown in whole field soil or sterilized soil from each location with some microbial fraction extracted from whole field soil added back. Seedlings grown in sterilized soil received an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) fraction, a fraction containing small microbes (bacteria and other fungi), a combination of both fractions, or neither. Total aboveground biomass was measured as a means of quantifying the soil treatments on plant growth. <br><br> The results show significant variation in growth depending upon both type of microbial fraction and soil location. LBS grew larger in whole field soil collected in greenbriar thickets than in whole field soil from the grassland. Seedlings growing in any treatment with AMF were much larger than those in treatments without. The grassland AMF fraction resulted in the greatest aboveground biomass in the entire experiment. The grassland small microbes fraction reduced aboveground biomass, while the greenbriar small microbe fraction did not.

USING A GENETIC SCREEN, HOMOZYGOUS KNOCKOUTS, AND AN AUXIN CONCENTRATION CURVE TO EXPLORE THE ROLE OF GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS IN THE MORPHOLOGY AND SIGNALING PATHWAYS OF ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA
April S. Lee
Stuyvesant High School, New York, NY

Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) are a major group of neuroreceptors in the mammalian brain. In this study, we explored the iGluR genes of Arabidopsis thaliana, a model plant organism, which are highly similar to mammalian iGluR genes, to understand the roles of iGluRs in plants.<br><br>We first performed a genetic screen using BMAA, an iGluR competitor that elongates the hypocotyls or “young stems” of seedlings, to identify new BMAA insensitive mutants (bim). We then examined single iGluR gene knockout plants on BMAA to observe the morphological effects of the genes. To investigate the possibility of interaction between plant iGluRs and auxin signaling pathways, we grew the mutant bim409 on an auxin concentration curve with BMAA. Both bim409 and auxin, a major plant hormone in plant growth, affects the ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic pathway, a protein degradation pathway. <br><br>With the genetic screen, we discovered a possible BMAA hypersensitive mutant, bim2020A-bim2020D. Our gene knockouts displayed no morphological differences from the wildtype (control), indicating that other iGluR genes compensated for the knocked-out gene. We are now knocking out two iGluR genes at a time. Our auxin experiment showed that there is a possibility of interaction between the auxin and iGluR signaling pathways. <br><br>Further exploration of the bim2020s and the relationship between auxin and iGluRs would help scientists figure out the roles of iGluRs in plant signaling. Finding out the effects of iGluR genes in plant morphology would aid in the better understanding of the importance of iGluRs in plant signaling.

THE EFFECT OF FOREST FIRE ON TREE GROWTH
Lipi Gupta
Crescent Valley High School, Corvallis, OR

The purpose of this study was to characterize the effect of forest fire on tree growth. Forest fires are naturally occurring phenomena, and play an important role in forest ecology by maintaining forest health. In this study, tree growth was quantified by measuring annual ring widths. For this study, 277 tree cores from Ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir and grand fir trees were studied. The cores were collected from the Metolius Watershed, which experienced large fires in 2002-2003. The tree cores were analyzed using the computer program WinDENDRO, and then the ring width measurements were converted into growth index values. The values display positive or negative percent post-fire growth, compared to pre-fire growth. In order to analyze this data set standard error bars were used to evaluate the significance of data from one year to the next, and whether data was significantly different from zero. The data suggest that after moderate severity fire, growth for Douglas-fir increased; growth for Ponderosa pine decreased; but growth for grand fir showed no apparent increase or decrease. The data for low severity fire suggest Douglas-fir had increased growth; Ponderosa pine had decreased growth and grand fir had no apparent increase or decrease. Information on immediate post-fire growth rates in mixed conifer forests is important for proper forest management. Knowing how the trees will respond to underburn fire, similar to prescribed fires, could help forest management agencies administer necessary fires to reduce fuel build up, but avoid causing changes in competition or other environment conditions.

Monisha Chandrahas
Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Mandya dist., Karnataka, INDIA

To meet the ever increasing global demand, for food grains and vegetables various innovations in the field of agriculture are required. To improve the quantity and quality of agricultural output, germination of seeds is a very important factor. To meet this challenge, my work proposes a novel solution of inoculating rhizobium obtained from Mimosa Pudica into the seeds, thereby, resulting in faster germination and better yield.<br><br>The germination rate was observed by administering the rhizobium of Mimosa Pudica on monocots like paddy, wheat, maize and dicots like, okra (lady’s finger), green peppers (chilly), egg plant (brinjal)<br><br>10g root nodules of Mimosa pudica was collected and sterilized. Further it was ground to paste and mixed with 50ml of distilled water. Two sets of 200 seeds of both Monocots and Dicots were taken, of which, one set was treated with the rhizobium extract for 3 hours. It was observed that the seeds treated with root nodule extract of Mimosa pudica exhibited better germination and faster growth than compared to the untreated seeds.<br><br>Comparative study revealed that the seeds treated with Mimosa Pudica showed 14% faster germination in paddy, 20% faster germination in wheat, 36% faster germination in maize, 42% faster germination in chilly, 32% faster germination in brinjal, and 30% faster germination in lady’s finger than the untreated seeds. There was 21% faster growth in the chilly plant and 20% faster growth in egg plant (brinjal) which was treated with the Mimosa pudica root nodule extract than the control plant.

Logan James Metzen
Hankinson High School, Hankinson, ND

Purpose: To grow a plot of soybeans and extract the oil from the soybeans. Secondly, to chemically analyze the biodiesel and compare it to its various blends. Finally, to use soybean meal as a feed supplement on the growth rate and egg production of chickens.<br><br>Procedures: Prepared and planted a 1 acre plot of soybeans, then harvested the soybeans. The oil was then extracted from the soybeans with a screw press.<br><br>Preparation of Biodiesel: Prepared 20 gallons of biodiesel by adding the proper quantities of soybean oil, methanol, and potassium hydroxide. <br><br>Biodiesel Analysis: Blended the biodiesel with #2 diesel fuel into three other blends including B50, B20, B2. Tested the different fuels for Kinematic Viscosity, Moisture Content, Acid Value, Cold Soak Filtration, Cloud Point, and Oxidative Stability. <br><br>Fuel Efficiency and Heat Output: Measured the heat output and fuel efficiency of biodiesel, diesel and various blends. <br><br>Feed Supplement Study: Compared the growth of chickens fed soybean supplemented feed to chickens fed traditional feed.<br><br>Egg Analysis: Collected eggs from each group and calculated the percentage of mass for yolks, whites, and shells.<br><br>Conclusion: In the biodiesel analysis, I found that the B100 met all of the specifications for the ASTM standards for biodiesel, except OSI. In the heat output test, all of the fuel blends burned at a similar temperature and B100 was the most efficient fuel. In the feed supplement study, the two groups had virtually identical growth rates. From the egg analysis, I found that the soybean group produced more eggs as well as the most nutritional eggs.

THE EFFECT OF GATHERING BARK FROM WIIGWAASI-MITIG (PAPER BIRCH)
Joseph L. DePerry
Bayfield High School, Bayfield, WI

Native Americans have been gathering and using birch bark for many years because of its flexible and durable properties. The purpose of this research was to determine whether gathering bark from Wiigwaasi-mitig (Betula papyrifera or paper birch) affects the growth of the tree. Birch trees from three locations on Red Cliff tribal land were studied. There were a considerable number of dead birch trees in the sample areas. A survey indicated a significantly higher percentage of dead stripped than dead non-stripped birch trees (p < 0.05). Core samples were taken from living paper birch trees that had been stripped of segments of their bark and also from trees that had not been stripped. The core samples were stained with phloroglucinol and the width of the annual rings was measured. Analysis of the data indicated that stripping the bark from paper birch trees does not affect the growth of the tree (p > 0.05). Data from this study indicate that trees stripped of the bark are less likely to survive. It is possible these trees are more susceptible to insect infestation and disease. However, the growth rate of stripped trees that survive is comparable to non-stripped trees.

LATITUDINAL COMPARISON OF FOREST PLANT TRAITS IN WISCONSIN
Samuel Martin Greene
Madison West High School, Madison, WI

Forests around the world face increasingly variable environmental conditions due to climate change. The viability of forests in the future is dependent on the ability of individual species to change either their growth patterns or their ranges. We compared plant traits of Acer saccharum, Galium triflorum, Maianthemum canadense, and Quercus rubra between northern (N) and southern (S) forests of Wisconsin (WI) and used their extent of variability as an indicator of their ability to adapt to a changing climate. Herbaceous and woody species showed equal amounts of latitudinal variability. Specific leaf area (SLA), or leaf area per unit of dry mass, was higher in S WI for A. saccharum and G. triflorum, the two species with higher overall SLA. Both of those species also generally had tougher leaves in N WI (as indicated by leaf tearer tests) and more plant trait correlations with the number of frost days. This indicates that plants in N WI need tougher, more robust leaves to survive cold weather. For several traits (twig dry matter content, leaf toughness, and stem specific density), one herbaceous species showed higher values in N WI while the other showed lower values in N WI. These traits cannot be used as indicators of how all species will react to climate change. The amount of plant trait variability in the species studied indicates that many will be forced to change their range, not their growth, if they are to adjust to climate change.

THE PHYTOCHEMICAL ACTIVITY OF CAMELLIA SINENSIS ON WHEAT
Megan Marie Meyer
Hankinson High School, Hankinson, ND

PURPOSE: To determine the effects of biological agents such as antioxidants and tea as natural pesticides on wheat. Furthermore, to observe the effects they will produce on the quality of wheat.<br><br>PROCEDURES: Collected 3 tea-related solutions: green tea, antioxidants (phytochemicals in tea), and EGCG (main phytochemical in tea) along with two commercial chemicals: Warrior Insecticide and Tilt Bactericide/Fungicide. The tea solutions were used at a 20:1 ratio and the chemicals at their field application rates.<br><br>TEST PLOT: Planted two replications of two cultivars at a rate of 160 lbs per acre in a total of 24, 10×3.5 foot rows (Plots were 3 feet apart between solutions and 3 feet apart between seed trials). Applied 2,000 mls of one of the treatments per row after four weeks. Allowed a three month growing period, then harvested using a Gleaner combine. After harvest, wheat seeds were analyzed and milled into flour for baking. Following baking, the loaves were evaluated for baking quality.<br><br>MICROBIAL STUDY: Tested organic solutions for their inhibitory properties on the growth of pathogenic microorganisms and beneficial bacteria. Furthermore, analyzed the solutions ability to fend off pathogens when applied directly on wheat.<br><br>INSECT STUDY: Examined the fatality rate of detrimental insects (black cutworm, fall armyworm, Hessian fly, and Russian wheat aphid) through direct contact. <br><br>CONCLUSION: From the Test Plot Study, the top solutions were EGCG and Warrior Insecticide. From the Microbial Study, green tea was the most productive in inhibiting the growth of pathogenic bacteria and fungus. For the Insect Study, Warrior Insecticide had the fastest fatality rate on the insects; where as the best natural solution was Antioxidants. Overall, I feel the EGCG has the potential to be used as a biopesticide.

THE COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY OF ZEA MAYS VAR. JAPONICA
Preston J Gilderhus
Maddock Public School, Maddock, ND

The purpose of this project was to find the physiological differences between the ornamental varieties and marketing factors for ornamental corn. The problem I wanted to solve was to figure out which variety of Ornamental Corn would have the greatest physiological differences compared to the Control. I hypothesized the Mixed variety would have the greatest physiological differences. <br><br>After measuring an average Zea Mays plant from each variety once/week, I picked 20 cobs of each variety. Then, I measured the length, circumference, and mass of 10 random cobs per variety. Next, I shelled the kernels and performed the moisture test, Pericarp Damage test, and TZ test, Clorox Soak test with appropriate number of kernels. Finally, I did trials of the Conductivity test and analyzed the results.<br><br>Based on the determining factors for the physiological differences, (in order from least to most differences) length- Mixed, Red, Blue, Yellow, White; circumference- Blue, Yellow, White, Mixed, Red; mass- Mixed, White, Yellow, Blue, Red; kernels- Red, Blue, Mixed, Yellow, White; moisture test- White, Red, Blue, Yellow, Mixed; Pericarp test- Mixed, White, Yellow, Blue, Red; and Clorox Soak test- Mixed, Blue, Yellow, White, Red. Despite my hypothesis, the variety with the most differences was Red. The growing season contributors that affected these results were low quality soil, shortage of rain during the growing days, and reduction of crop through uncontrolled wildlife grazing.<br><br>Based on these seven physiological factors, I found the Red variety had the most differences.

INVESTIGATING SOYBEAN TRAITS AND HOW THEY RELATE TO THE YIELD
Jackson Henry Troxel
LaCrosse High School, LaCrosse, IN

The purpose of my experiment was to find out how certain soybean varieties produce the yield that they do and to also discover if any correlation existed between certain soybean traits and the yield.<br><br> To go about my research, I received permission to obtain soybean samples from a local Purdue University research farm called Pinney Purdue. In my research, I took samples of thirty soybean plants from thirty different test plot varieties. After collecting the samples, I counted the number of pods per node on each plant and then researched the number of soybeans in each pod of the entire variety by counting the total number of pods with one, two, three, and four soybeans. To find the average size of the soybeans, I cracked open the soybean pods and then removed and weighed the beans. The average size was determined by dividing the number of beans by the weight of the sample.<br><br> While collecting the samples from the research farm, I measured the row width and length that the thirty plants took up. From that information, the total number of plants per acre can be calculated. Using the weight and area of the sample, the yield was calculated. I used the yield data supplied by Purdue Research Farm to compare to my calculated yield data.<br><br> By using my data, I can explain what traits are creating the yield differences between different varieties. I discovered the three most significant parameters to soybeans are plant population, bushiness, and seed size.

ARE THE SEEDS OF THE FEDERALLY ENDANGERED SMALL'S MILKPEA (GALACTIA SMALLII), CANDIDATES FOR FROZEN STORAGE?
Victor Manuel Moas
Christopher Columbus High School, Miami, FL

The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether the seeds of Galactia smallii (Small’s Milkpea) are candidates for long-term frozen storage in seed banks. The hypothesis was that if the seeds were dried then frozen, then they could later be thawed and germinated. <br><br> From September 18, 2008 to September 21, 2008 one hundred seeds from Galactia smallii were desiccated in an airtight container. For the next week, the dried seeds were frozen at -13°C. From September 25, 2008 to September 28, 2008 another hundred seeds were desiccated. On September 28, 2008 each freeze-dried and dried seed was nicked with a straight-edged razor and set in a Petri dish filled with standard potting sand. Another hundred fresh seeds were also nicked and sown. These were the control. Each dish held ten seeds, receiving equal water and light. The number of germinations for each set was recorded daily for eleven days. All germination ended after the tenth day of observation. The set of fresh seeds used as the control had a germination rate of 82%. The seed set which received only the desiccation treatment had a germination rate of 86%. The set that was desiccated and frozen achieved a germination rate of 95%. <br><br> Because the seeds of Small’s Milkpea survived desiccation and freezing temperatures, this experiment proves that these seeds are orthodox germinators and candidates for long term storage; therefore, the hypothesis was correct. With this information, botanists can preserve the seeds of this plant at sub-zero temperatures in a seed bank.

THE MICROPROPAGATION OF CELASTRUS THROUGH TISSUE CULTURE
Rachael Claire Arkfeld
Lourdes Central Catholic School, Nebraska City, NE

Specialty forest crops such as Celastrus (bitter sweet) have become very popular in the floral industry. Celatrus is a monacious plant; it has both a male and a female plant. Since only the female produces berries, I wanted to find a way to multiply only the female plants.<br><br>My hypothesis was that it is possible to force Celastrus; the solution with the highest amount of 8-hydroxyquinoline citrate (C9H7NOC6H8O7) would prove the best. I believe it possible to tissue culture new growth. My procedure consisted of forcing 120 stems in select solutions. These solutions were each 150 mL. They included 200 ppm C9H7NOC6H8O7 and 2% sucrose, 150 ppm C9H7NOC6H8O7 and 2% sucrose, 100 ppm C9H7NOC6H8O7 and 2% sucrose, 50 ppm C9H7NOC6H8O7 and 2% sucrose, Gatorade, distilled water and 2% sucrose, and distilled water.<br><br>The solutions were changed every four days and changes were noted. There were two different specimen groups taken, one earlier in the dormancy period and one later. Samples were taken in the dormant stage; the berry shells were needed to identify the female plants. The plants were forced out of dormancy and grown for suitable material, new plant material was tissue cultured.<br><br>I found that I could force the stems with the control working the best. I also found that the new growth could be tissue cultured. Three of the medias that I developed worked. My hypothesis was proven partially correct and partially incorrect; the distilled water worked the best, I hypothesized that the 200 ppm C9H7NOC6H8O7 and 2% sucrose, would.

THE EVIDENCE AND POTENTIAL ROLES OF ALLELOPATHIC AGENTS PRESENT IN SWEET POTATOES (IPOMOEA BATATAS)
Mason Cole McFarland
Jefferson County International Baccalaureate School, Birmingham, AL

The sweet potato is a very versatile plant and an even better weed killer. The sweet potato has been known to produce chemicals that when exuded are capable of killing other plants around it. This process is called allelopathy. <br><br> Allelopathy is a promising new field of study that deals with natural reactions between plants to aid in weed control. Kudzu is an invasive weed and even grows back after repeated applications of synthetic herbicides. These herbicides harm the environment and cause the area to become unusable and barren except for the kudzu. This weed is out of control and won’t be stopped unless a new type of herbicide is formed. That is were the sweet potato comes in. If the specific allelochemical that is causing other plants to die were to be extracted then it could be used as a potential solution for the kudzu problem. Not only would it eliminate the kudzu but it would also serve as a natural herbicide which would not harm the environment. This way the kudzu dies and the land is usable and productive. <br><br> The allelochemicals are located throughout all of the sweet potato but are most concentrated in the periderm tissue. By testing this tissue one could determine what organic compounds are in the skin, and from there test each compound and determine which one would have the greatest potential for controlling the kudzu problem.

EFFECT OF CARBON ON TANACETUM VULGARE ALLELOCHEMICALS
Tyler Scott Wilson
Basalt High School, Basalt, CO

The common tansy (Tanacetum vulgare) is a plant species native to Europe, but grows commonly in North America. In Colorado, the common tansy is a Class B Noxious Weed. Allelochemicals are chemicals produced by certain species to limit the growth of organisms around them. The purpose of this experiment was to find if Tanacetum vulgare produces allelochemicals, and if it does, if adding carbon to the soil can reduce the effects of those allelochemicals. The hypothesis for this experiment was that the common tansy does produce allelochemicals and the addition of carbon to the soil would nullify the effects of the allelochemicals.<br><br> The first step in this experiment was to dig up rhizomes from a thriving colony of Tanacetum vulgare and replant them in nine, one-gallon containers. Next, eighteen radishes were germinated in four-inch by four-inch containers with soil and 100ml of carbon for every liter of soil. Eighteen radishes were also germinated in soil without carbon. After germination, two thirds of each of the germinated radishes from both the carbon soil and no carbon soil were placed in arrays with the common tansy. These plants were then watered by pouring water on the tansies and letting the water run down into a shared water tray. The other one third of the radishes were set up in an array without tansies as a control to prove that the carbon did not effect the growth of the radishes. After five weeks of growth (once all the radishes had two true leaves), the radishes were cut at the soil and dried, then they were weighed to obtain an above ground biomass. The results of this experiment showed that there was no significant change (p=0.05) in the plants with carbon and without carbon, using a T-test. This was true for the radishes with the tansies and the control plants. This shows that carbon in the soil does not effect the growth of radishes, and that if allelochemicals are produced they do not affect plants that are already germinated. The production of allelochemicals was not proven or disproven with this experiment. A follow up experiment is currently underway to determine if the common tansy produces allelochemicals that effect seed germination.

USING X-RAY FLUORESCENCE ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF LICHENS FROM DEAD AND LIVING TREES IN RELATIONSHIP TO TARDIGRADE PROLIFERATION
Kristen Paige Kirkland
Eastern High School, Pekin, IN

Previous research projects conducted by this researcher concluded that tardigrades did not habitat lichens collected from dead trees. This unique discovery lead to the inevitable question, “Why?” The purpose of this project was to identify the chemical composition of lichens from dead and living trees to determine its potential role in tardigrade proliferation. It was hypothesized that there would be a distinct difference in the chemical compositions of lichens taken from dead and living trees. Three samples of foliose lichens (and their attached bark) were collected from each of three dead maple trees and three living maple trees. The lichen samples were meticulously separated from their attached bark for individual testing. The four samples (lichen/living, bark/living, lichen/dead, and bark/dead) were analyzed using a Niton X-ray Fluorescence Analyzer to determine the chemical composition. Each test was conducted three times. Energy from the x-rays ejected inner-shell electrons from their orbits and electrons from the outer shell took their place. This energy resulted in fluorescent x-rays, each of which was characteristic of a specific element. The fluorescent x-rays were detected and elements present in parts per million were identified. F-tests and Student’s t-Tests were conducted on eight different elements for each of the four samples and their averages to determine the statistical significance. Not only were the elements with obvious differences in larger quantities analyzed, so were the elements in minute quantities with large ratio difference.. These tests showed that Iron, Strontium, Manganese, Copper, Calcium, Potassium, and Zinc were all statistically significant at the 0.05 level.

INTERPRETING THE HYDROLOGICAL HISTORY OF THE EVERGLADES THROUGH MICROSCOPIC CHARACTERIZATION OF PHYTOLITHS
Christopher Allen Sanchez
Felix Varela Senior High School, Miami, FL

A key to making future management decisions in Everglades restoration is understanding how the wetland responds to environmental changes and climate driven fluctuations in hydrology. In order to reconstruct these historical changes, scientist use biological proxies such as sedimented pollen, fossilized seeds, and siliceous microfossils. Soils containing an abundance of siliceous phytoliths indicate the existence of shallow wetland conditions and can be used to determine changes in precipitation, conductivity, and plant species composition. <br><br> The use of phytoliths can be tedious and they have not been previously identified in Everglades soils. As a result, this experiment is the first of two parts. The objective of this experiment is to determine if phytoliths have been preserved and if a sufficient concentration is available for analysis. Specifically, this expermient tests the hypothesis that if samples from a soil core in the Everglades are oxidized and decanted, then subsequent microscopic analysis will reveal the presence of siliceous phytoliths of key Everglades vegetation. <br><br> In this experiment, a single soil core was oxidized with acid, neutralized, and then examined, under the microscope, for the presence of siliceous microfossils. Preliminary results reveal the presence of a variety phytoliths, diatoms, sclerids, and sponge spicules at all depths throughout the core. The next phase of this experiment will examine a series of soil cores taken along the Everglades estuarine-wetland ecotone to reconstruct historical changes in Everglades hydrology and hydropattern.

The purpose of this experiment was to show how pollution that causes acid rain might affect plants. It was hypothesized that higher acidity would slow growth in height and number of leaves.<br><br>Solutions were made with a pH of 4, 5, 6, and 7. The height of each plant was measured and the leaves were counted. All of the plants were placed in the same area, sprayed 10 times and watered with 150mL of the right solutions every day. Each week, the plants were measured and the leaves were counted. <br><br>On average, plants watered with a pH of 4 grew 16cm and lost 2 leaves, plants with a pH of 5 grew 21cm and gained 15 leaves, plants with a pH of 6 grew 19cm and gained 23 leaves, and plants with a pH of 7 grew 20cm and gained 76 leaves.<br><br>The results of this experiment show that the acidity of rain has an effect on plant growth. Although there was no significant difference in height after 5 weeks, there was a difference in the amount of leaves. As the water became more acidic, there were less new leaves and some plants lost leaves. The hypothesis was partially supported. There was not a significant difference in plant height, but there was in the number of leaves. Based on the findings, the project will be continued using sulfuric acid and testing chlorophyll and nitrate levels in addition to growth and number of leaves.

Our research entitled: “Microponic technology in propagation, transportation and distribution of plant species” is carried out in order to overcome the drawbacks of traditional propagation, transportation and distribution methods. Applied microponic with new substrate can help propagate pathogen-free plants, save space and transporting expenses as well as enhance or facilitate the plant production and exporting activities.<br><br>In this method, we applied or used new substrate in microponic system (flower-arranging substrate, nylon film); Solanum tuberosum, Chrysanthemum sp and Torenia fournieri L. were used as materials. The number of roots, fresh weight, and plant height are compared with those of traditional methods, respectively. <br><br>Results indicated that using new substrate allows advantages in plant propagation, transportation and distribution. The effects of substrate thicknesses on plants growth and development are also gathered. The results obtained in this research showed that 3 kinds of plants were rooted well in flower-arranging substrate. Different thicknesses of substrate lead to different rooting ability. Plant growth and development were optimal in 1 cm-substrate culture system. This new microponic system also showed advantages in saving space and energy, transportation compared with traditional methods. <br><br>This research is our first investigation on a new set-up microponic system, in which, suitable species and different optimal conditions were established to overcome the drawbacks in propagation, distribution and production as in traditional methods. Our research also offered a new method for plant growth with commercial purposes.

EVOKED POTENTIALS IN PLANTS AND ANALGESIC CURES FOR TMV
Bryan Kwame Agadzi, Nathaniel Edwards, Thomas Schmidt
Pensacola High School, Pensacola, FL

The experiment “Evoked Potentials in Plants and Analgesic Cures for TMV” was designed to further investigate ways to cure plants from disease. <br><br> Many crops are destroyed yearly due to droughts and generally harsh conditions in the United States, as well as the world. Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) is one of the most prevalent plant viruses worldwide. Despite TMV disseminating millions of dollars of crops yearly, there is currently no cure for tobacco mosaic virus. The team's research has found a way to successfully eliminate/halt progression of the disease in plants. This is done by a similar mechanism as vaccinations are performed in humans. Inoculating the plant with a vaccine type of chemical called Methyl Salicylate. This chemical is found naturally in winter-green trees, which secrete it into the surrounding air. Other plants in the area, incapable of producing this chemical, absorb it, and use it as an "immune booster" which aids the plant in fighting off diseases.<br><br> The design of the experiment was to purchase 30 Snapdragons, and measure their electrical impulses via Electroencephalogram. An EEG (Electroencephalogram) machine is used to record the electrical firing rate of cells, which in turn can be used to determine status of health. <br><br> In all, this breakthrough idea, of increasing the health of plants using Methyl Salicylate, can greatly increase the crop yield of farmers and big industries not just in the United States but worldwide. The research in this project will also allow for different plants to be grown in harsher, less-favorable environments, with minimal environmental affects. As a result of the use of Methyl Salicylate, there will be an overall reduction in the use of pesticides in farming, leading to an overall benefit to the environment as a whole.

Beijing 101 Middle School, Beijing, CHINA

Crop residue is rich in China. However, crop residues are not properly utilized in the northern arid and semiarid areas where soil degradation is a serious problem. In this study, the effects of no-tillage (NT) mulched with crop residues on the growth of broccoli and soil ecological characteristics were investigated in typical brown soil at Beijing 101 Middle School greenhouse. <br><br>The major method in this study is field experiment with lab analysis.<br><br>The results show that compared with conventional tillage (CT) without crop straw mulching, the yield of broccoli increased by over 20% in NT treatments. The nutritional quality of broccoli also improved significantly in non-tillage system. The water retention and aeration in non-tillage soil greatly improved due to the formation of soil aggregates. Water stable aggregates increased from 60.74% to 90.18% and those sized over 5mm in diameter increased from 26.68% to 40.24%. The activities of urease, catalase and invertase in soil increased by 62.8%, 65.9% and 39.1%, respectively. Viable bacteria number of microorganism and microbial biomass carbon in soil increased by 94.88% and 24.16%, respectively. The organic matter, total N, P and K in soil respectively increased by 58.07%, 75.38%, 19.44% and 7.40%.<br><br>The study indicates that crop productivity, soil structure, soil fertility and soil microbial activity have improved in non-tillage system with crushed crop stalks mulched over soil, which is of importance for no-till popularization and sustainable agricultural development in rural areas of northern China.

The purpose of our experiment was to see if the flow rate of nutrient water will affect the growth of tomato plants that are grown in a hydroponic environment. We hypothesized that the nutrient water moving the slowest would make the plants grow the most because we felt that the roots would have more time to take out the nutrients in the water. Procedure:<br><br>1. First we had to research how to make the design of how we were going to construct our hydroponics machine. <br><br>2. Next, we went to the store to purchase the items we needed which include the gutter, pump, tubes, valves and more. <br><br>3. Then we went home and started to put our project together with the help of and adult. <br><br>4. The machine is built and we went to the nursery to get the chemicals to make the nutrient water and bought our tomatoes. <br><br>5.

Dolores Senior High School, Dolores, CO

The main purpose of this experiment was to determine if carnations are capable of transporting water that has been infused with human scent. The initial project was designed to use a trained search and rescue dog to determine if the scent would travel from water to the plant.<br><br> The carnations capability of transporting substances through the xylem tubes was determined by letting the flowers soak in the test solution for a period of time. Following this, the plants were placed in scent tubes, the tubes were hidden, and the dogs attempted to ascertain their location. This experiment used Dianthus caryophyllus, simple carnations, Canis lupus familiaris, trained K-9 Search and Rescue dogs, specifically German Shepard Dogs. Scent samples were gauze pads that were soaked in water and then placed in direct contact with soil recovered from beneath a cadaver. Blood samples were assessed by placing the blood in an aqueous solution that held the stem of a fresh cut Dianthus caryophyllus. <br><br> The results were determined by counting the hits and misses that the K-9 dogs made on the scent tubes containing the flowers. Search dogs are professionally trained to locate only items that had human scent on them. <br><br> The contributions of this project are that 66% of the flowers soaked in human scent for a 48 hour period were located by the dogs. Secondly, those that were exposed for one week were located 50% of the time. The benefits of understanding the potential for scent location by German Shepard Dogs could increase effectiveness of the dogs success in locating lost individuals.

FIRE RESISTANCE OF DOUGLAS-FIR AND TANOAK: IS IT TANNIN RELATED?
Lily A Miller, Chanda Denton, 
Gold Beach High School, Gold Beach, OR

Douglas-fir and Tanoak are two of the most common species of trees here on the Southwestern Oregon Coast. The area here has a fire return interval of 80 to 110 years. Some people believe that bark tannin has something to do with the fire resistance of Tanoak. In order to test this we took the measurements of maximum and minimum char height of both Douglas-fir and Tanoak trees that were in a stand that was burned in the 2002 Biscuit Fire. Next we extracted bark tannin using acetone and used a UV Spectrophotometer set at 280nm to determine the tannin concentration. We found that the maximum bark char height on the Tanoak is significantly lower (p<0.0001) than on the Douglas-fir. For the tannin conent, we discovered that there is a positive relationship between the tannin concentration and the maximum bark char height of Tanoak (p=0.0043, r2=0.95), but for the Douglas-fir r2=0.48 and p=0.1951. In the future we plan on adding tannin to Douglas-fir bark samples to see if it will reduce the bark flammability.

In 2006-2007 planthopper disaster overspreaded to a large area of China and drew our much concern and curiosity. Thus, we carried out a series of experiments to try to find out how the insects imperil rice and hopefully to find solution to the problem. Our results are summarized as follows: 1. By making sections and SEM observation of leaves, we found that planthoppers imperil rice mainly by sucking the nutrient from its phloem; 2. Our in vitro experiments confirmed that the insects indeed need sugar as food and can sense where is the sugar in plants; 3. Among 8 selected cultivars, by careful quantitative-controlled insect-intrusion test and statistic analysis, we finally confirmed a hybrid rice,WH66, that has strong ability to repel palnthopper; 4. Both microscopic observation and histochemical investigation revealed that WH66 could soon response to insect attack by producing a large quantity of proteins at sieve-tube cells to block the transduction of nutrient. Thus, prevent plants from deep injury by the insect sucking. After the insects were gone, the protein soon digested and normal function of sieve tubes was recovered. Such interesting mechanism of plant response to insect invasion has been never reported yet. Our finding offers a novel clue for the production and confirmation of new hybrids of anti-planthopper rice in the future.

In the project, CaFe Flora, concentrations of Calcium and Iron were tested in corn, beans, and peas to determine whether either nutrient was helpful to the plant growth. After it was determined that these nutrients were helpful to the growth, it was then asked how helpful were they?<br><br><br> To begin the experiment, 10 seeds were placed in each plastic container of regular potting soil. A 5% solution of Iron was made by mixing 5 grams of iron sulfate in distilled water to make 1 liter of solution. Ten grams were then added to a one liter solution to make a 10% solution. A 5% and a 10% solution of Calcium oxide was also made by mixing 5 grams and 10 grams respectively to one liter of solution. One container each of corn, peas, and beans were watered with each solution, as well as a control group of each watered with distilled water. Plants were watered every two to three days a week. Each group was given 330 mL of water per watering.<br><br><br> After the project was over, it was concluded that there was no significant increase from the added concentrations of Calcium and Iron, and in some cases, the nutrients were harmful to the plants. By looking at the results, nothing can be determined. In conclusion, it can be said by adding Calcium and Iron to the soil, no positive affects are shown.

THE EFFECTS OF PULSATING SUB-LETHAL LEVELS OF ELECTRIC SHOCK ON THE BIOSYNTHESIS OF PISATIN(+) IN PISUM SATIVUM L.
Taryn Leigh Wassmer, Jonathan Gillis, 
Manhasset High School, Manhasset, NY

Constant antibiotic usage has resulted in multiresistant bacterial and fungal strains. A large group of low molecular weight compounds exhibiting antimicrobial activity have been isolated from plants known as secondary metabolites and are produced in large quantities in response to elicitors, such as electric shock. Therefore the purpose of this experiment was to view the effects of pulsating sub-lethal levels of electric shock on the production of antifungal metabolites in pea. The alternate hypothesis was: groups treated with pulsating levels of sub-lethal electric current would express higher elicitation and inhibition. Pisum sativum was cultivated in hydroponics tanks. A pulse simulator was attached to copper electrodes at the base of the plant. Following elicitation, plants underwent alcoholic extractions and metabolites were qualitatively analyzed using an anti-fungal sensitivity test. The greatest concentration of pisatin was achieved with a constant current, with a zone of inhibition measuring 20mm(+ 1.3) in diameter. Plants experiencing 2, 5, and 10 second pulse square waves displayed successively higher levels of inhibition: 10mm(+1.6), 12mm(+1.9), and 15mm(+1.2), respectively. These data suggest that pulsation is less effective than constant stimulation to increase the production of metabolites.

INOCULATION OF RUBUS ARMENIACUS CULTURES IN VITRO, YEAR TWO
Haley Kae Epperly, Ann Bernert, 
West Linn High School, West Linn, OR

Himalayan Blackberry, Rubus armeniacus, is a "B" designated, quarantined noxious weed in Oregon. One biological control option for this invasive weed is Blackberry rust, Phragmidium violaceum. P. violaceum is a biotrophic urdenial used as a successful biological control agent in three countries. In 2005, the fungus was found in Oregon. To most effectively study P. violaceum and its potential as a biocontrol for Oregon, a controlled source must be developed. <br><br>This project developed novel procedures to create a controlled source of P. violaceum via inoculated in vitro R. armeniacus cultures. Three preliminary experiments from August to January worked on improving inoculation methods to infect intact R. laciniatus leaf clusters. Urediniospores produced from these intact plants were collected and used to inoculate in vitro R. armeniacus cultures. Cultures were randomly assigned to three groups; Control, non-sterilized spores, sterilized spores. The later two groups received inoculation. Both techniques for inoculating in vitro plants proved successful. <br><br>To our knowledge, this is the first instance of in vitro stage I cultures being successfully infected with P. violaceum. The establishment of a controlled, in vitro source of P. violaceum is an important advance in the study of biocontrol agents for R. armeniacus. This advance makes an environmentally sustainable and natural biological control regimen for R. armeniacus increasingly realistic.

BARCODING PLANTS USING THE RUBISCO GENE
Hannah Grace Chmura, Katherine Flores, 
Hamilton-Wenham Regional High School, Hamilton, MA

For years, scientists have been collaborating on the Barcode of Life Initiative. They are testing to see if all biological species can be identified by using a short gene sequence in a standardized position in the entire genome. The purpose of this study is to examine whether the RuBisCO gene can be useful for barcoding and identifying plants.<br><br>First, DNA was extracted from the chloroplasts of plant cells. After using PCR technology and gel electrophoresis to isolate the gene, the positive samples were purified and prepared to go to New England Biolabs’ DNA sequencing facility. Once sequenced, the results were compared to the same gene from the corresponding plants on a database (BLAST).<br><br>Of the eleven plants tested, sequences were obtained for three: Tobacco, Salt Marsh Hay, and Spider Plant. For each of these, our sequences matched the RuBisCO sequences online by a majority of the nucleotides. This verified that the RuBisCO gene can be used to correctly identify plants and that our methods provided us with accurate sequences. <br><br>In conclusion, the RuBisCO gene does work for identifying plants but may not be the best gene to barcode for BOLI. Future research should be focused on testing if this gene is specific enough to differentiate between very closely related plants. However, if the gene is found to be ideal for barcoding, more experimentation must be done to synthesize primers that hybridize more accurately on the RuBisCO gene, providing more consistent results.

OSMOTIC PRIMING
Spencer Dean McDonald, Mike Porter, Kaitlin Wimmer
American Fork High School, American Fork, UT

Osmotic priming is the process of controlled seed hydration. Osmotic priming has been proven to increase seed germination in adverse soil conditions including saline soils and varying pH. Because Utah has saline soil, osmotic priming allows for increased germination of crops. The purpose of this research was to find the most effective priming agent in varying saline environments based on the germination rate as well as radicle and cotyledon length. To perform this test, oats (Avena sativa), corn (Zea mays), barley (Hordeum vulgare), and grass (Poa pratensis) were primed for 24 hours in 5% solutions of D-Mannitol, Glycerol, Polyethylene Glycol (3350), and water, and allowed to dry. The seeds from each priming agent were planted in increasing salinity conditions (2g/L to 20g/L), and the germination rate was recorded for six days. To test the effects of the priming agents on the radicles and cotyledons of seeds, corn seeds were soaked in solutions of each priming agent for 4 days, 3 days, 2 days, and 1 day. After soaking, the radicle and cotyledon were then measured using a micrometer. By statistical analysis, it was determined that the most effective priming agent depended on the type of seed being tested. For example, Polyethylene Glycol and Mannitol worked the best for corn. It was also found that osmotic priming increases the radicle and cotyledon length.

WEED 'EM AND REAP: THE EFFECTS OF HYDROPONIC AND AEROPONIC METHODS ON PLANT GROWTH
Rohit G. Vadvadgi, Vaibhav Sharma, 
R.C. Clark High School, Plano, TX

This project in its present form is the result of hydroponic and aeroponic experimentation to determine the most efficient method of growing plants without soil. Further research on the fusion of hydroponic and aeroponic techniques led to the creation of a more successful method of aero-hydroponics. In the experiment, 5 sets of plants were tested through 5 different techniques of soil-less plant growth over a testing period of 4 weeks. <br><br>Successful growth was determined statistically. The innovative Aero-Hydroponic technique was the most successful of the five methods, also including the Static Aerated technique (control group), the Ebb and Flow technique, The Deep Flow technique, and the Root-Mist technique (Aeroponics). The results were highly accurate when comparing the success of Aero-Hydroponics to the other techniques, as the rejection of the null hypothesis was backed by confidence levels of 99.9% when compared to the other techniques.<br><br>The Aero-Hydroponic technique resulted in growing 38% more than the Static Aerated hydroponic technique. The Root-Mist technique had the second best results with 30% growth increase. Next was Deep Flow technique with 6% increase and Ebb and Flow resulted in a decrease with a growth of negative 3% compared to the control group.<br><br>The Aero-Hydroponic technique proved the most efficient, thus supporting the hypothesis. The experiment is an important contribution to the hydroponic and aeroponic fields of plant growth in that the fusion of these two techniques have created a successful and original method of growing plants faster. In the future, the Aero-Hydroponic technique can be easily put to use in desert environments by making it easier to recycle and reuse water.

TRANSFORMING IPOMOEA BATATAS VIA DIRECT INOCULATION WITH AGROBACTERIUM RHIZOGENES: A CONTINUATION
Randall Scott Ray, Leslie Young, 
Wentzville Holt High School, Wentzville, MO

There is currently no efficient method of genetic transformaation of sweet potato. The need for a fast, efficient method can be met by using a technique involving direct inoculation of plant cuttings in rock wool. Sweet potato cuttings were inoculated with Agrobacterium rhizogenes containing a construct with GUS and GFP transcription factors and placed in the rock wool to generate transgenic root tissue. The resultant roots were screened for GFP expression using florescence microscopy. Plants with transgenic roots were potted in soil to develop tubers. Tubers were harvested and screened for GUS expression using the 'GUS staining’ process in which transgenic tissues display a blue color. The transgenic tubers were replanted in soil where new, entirely transgenic plants were grown. The leaves of these plants were screened for GUS also. These experiments demonstrated a greater rate of efficiency than the current methods, yet the transformation was accomplished with less effort and time. This method offers a means of genetic transformation in which scorable markers (GFP and GUS) can be screened for in future generations, a novel accomplishment with the sweet potato. This methodology also allows for the future insertion of a wide variety of potentially useful genes via A. rhizogenes.

ORGANIC VS. INORGANIC: IMPACT OF FERTILIZER TYPE ON BEAN PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
Megan Leigh Hatfield, Samuel David Miner, 
Winona Senior High School, Winona, MN

The purpose of this project was to see if organic, inorganic, or no fertilizer would impact the growth, leaf, flower, bean count, and biomass of the pinto bean plant.<br><br>It was hypothesized that over a shorter period of time, inorganic fertilizer would benefit the bean plant’s development the most due to the rapid-release chemical components involved. Over a longer period of time, it was hypothesized that organic fertilizer would be more beneficial to plant development due to the slow-release nitrogen.<br><br>Soil with no fertilizer was added to 10 pots for each test group (organic, inorganic, and no fertilizer). Potted plants were placed in a growth chamber and were watered every other day with water for the organic and control plants (the organic fertilizer was mixed into the soil) and an inorganic fertilizer-water solution for the inorganic plants. Plants were then dried and biomass was taken for each test group.<br><br>At the end of the testing period, 0 control, 2 inorganic, and 6 organic plants had died. The control group’s biomass was 21% larger than inorganic biomass and 79% larger than organic biomass. Control was thought to be most beneficial as a result of the biomass and the substantially larger flower count.<br><br>Future plans that are being executed now include more soil per plant, open air growth area with support structure, and testing different concentrations of the organic fertilizer.

The project in its present form was done to see if the addition of Eisenia castings would improve the physical characteristics of soilless growing medium. As well as how effective it will be as a rooting promoter for plant cuttings and as a seed germination medium.<br><br>Initially tests were done using castings both wet and dried. These were added to potting soils and used to start seeds. Also the castings were placed in propagation flats to be used with cuttings of Geraniums and Night Blooming Sirrus to promote root growth. The castings did improve both the root formation on the cuttings and sped up the time it took for seeds to germinate. <br><br>For the next phase of the project we chose to use materials that are traditionally found in soilless growing media such as perlite, vermiculite, and Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss; plus worm castings. We added the castings to see if we could create a new soilless growing medium that would be light weight, have readily available nutrients, strong Cation Exchange Capacity, good bulk density, adequate drainage, desirable pH, and the ability to be useful in the growth of plants started by seeds. The results of the tests showed that Eisenia castings did improve the overall physical characteristics of the potting soils.<br><br>The soilless growing media was put into a field trial. Varying amounts of castings were mixed with peat moss and vermiculite or perlite at predetermined ratios. Pots were labeled and radish and lettuce seeds were started. Radish pots were put outside for germination and growth. The lettuce was started inside under grow lights as recommended on the seed packet, due to hot temperatures. Data on the germination and growth of the plants was recorded on a continuous basis. At the culmination of the experiment, nutrient tests were run on the soilless mixes, as well as plant tissue test which were done to test for micronutrients in the plants. This test showed the amount of nutrients the plant was able to use. <br><br>In conclusion, we found that the addition of worm castings to soilless mixes does improve the physical characteristics of soilless growing medium and has a positive effect on plant growth both from seed and cutting propagation.

TOTAL POLYPHENOLIC CONTENTS IN RELATION TO ITS CHEMOPREVENTIVE PROPERTIES IN TURMERIC RHIZOMES
Hamza Arshad, Intisar Islam, 
Little Rock Central High, Little Rock, AR

Current research shows that some plants exhibit higher amounts of total polyphenols than the other spectrum of flora. In this experiment, the total phenolic content, antioxidant activity, and antimutagenic activity were observed within six random samples of turmeric (Curcuma longa) rhizomes. The total phenolic content ranged from 13.18g/100g DM to 16.55g/100g DM. The sample labeled V5 had the highest amount of polyphenols, while the sample V3 had the lowest. The scavenging activity (RSA) ranged from 0.29 to 0.39 µmole Trolox/mg (IC50). In the case of RSA, the sample V5 showed highest activity (0.39 µmole Trolox equivalence/mg DM) and the sample V3 was the lowest (0.29 µmole Trolox equivalence/mg DM). The significant positive correlation between the radical scavenging activity and the amount of total phenolics (r=0.85) indicates that phenolic compounds play a major role in the antioxidant components of turmeric rhizomes. The antimutagenicity array showed that turmeric had a higher antimutagenicity by effectively reversing mutation induced by Trp-P-1 on Salmonella typhimurium TA 98. According to the P-value found (< 0.001), the null hypothesis was rejected. As a result, the total amount phenolics found within the turmeric rhizomes exhibit potential chemopreventive properties.

THE EFFECTS OF NERIUM OLEANDER ON MUTANT AND WILD-TYPE DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER
Sheilalyn Espiritu Solis, Darline Seu, 
Silver Creek High School, San Jose, CA

Purpose: To test which part of the toxic plant Nerium Oleander (flowers, leaves, or bark) can most effectively be used to create an organic biodegradable insect pesticide safe for our environment yet still efficiently powerful to work as a natural pesticide towards common pests, wild-type and mutant. <br><br>Methods of research: We extracted liquids from the leaves, bark, and flowers of the plant with ethanol, centrifuged it, and created a 10% dilution. Seventy mutant white eye and seventy wild-type fruit flies were both tested with 10 flies per tube. A positive control (distilled water with fruit fly medium) and negative control (10% ethanol with fruit fly medium) were created. Fruit fly reactions to the pesticide were observed two hours after initiation of the trial and almost everyday after for two weeks.<br><br>Data/Results: The day after exposure to the pesticide most of the flies died, but no flies died in the control tubes. The mutant flies showed higher mortality than the wild-type flies one day after exposure, particularly in the red flower and bark exposure tubes. Observations continued for another week and in this period the flies in both the positive and negative controls had reproduced.<br><br>Conclusion: We concluded that all parts of Nerium Oleander work as an effective and natural insect pesticide. The higher mortality in the mutant flies probably resulted from higher genetics susceptibility to the toxin. The toxins from Nerium Oleander are effective and strong enough to be used as an organic pesticide for agriculturists and gardeners to use in the future. Therefore, producing a biodegradable pesticide from Nerium Oleander will be highly marketable in the future because of the widespread availability of the poisonous plant and the cheap production costs to create this pesticide. <br><br>

WHAT'S YOUR FLAVONOID?
Brianna Leilani Bourgeois
Lutcher High School, Lutcher, LA

I am continuing to develop a non-distructive ripeness indicator for fruits and vegetables. The indicator uses a spectrophotometer to detect the absorbance of UV light on oranges. This year I started by testing different concetrations of the flavonoids hesperidin and rutin. I chose to use those two flavonoids because they are the two main flavonoids in oranges. Through research I have found that the average concentration for hesperidin is 324 ppm and 1.9 ppm for rutin. Knowing this, I tested the absorbancy of those measurements, half those measurements, a quarter of those measurements, and double those measurements. I used the graphs of these to compare with my last year's graphs of oranges' absobancy.

IDENTIFICATION OF A SUPER HYBRID RICE VARIETY, GUANGZHAN 635/1128, USING SIMPLE SEQUENCE REPEAT MOLECULAR MARKERS
Tiffanie Faye Stone
Academy for Science and Agriculture, Vadnais Heights, MN

Rice is an important staple food crop throughout the world. In China, rice constitutes approximately 40% of calories consumed. Increased population along with a decrease in tillable land has made hybrid rice, which increases rice yields a hot topic worldwide.<br><br>At the China National Hybrid Rice Research and Development Center (CNHRRDC) where I conducted my experiment, new hybrid rice varieties are created. The purpose of my experiment was to distinguish a new hybrid from its parents and other varieties. <br><br>My experiment used simple sequence repeat primers to show the polymorphism of Guangzhan 635/1128, a new and promising super hybrid rice variety. Seed purity is vital to ensure optimum yield. Easy rice variety identification helps to keep the cost of seed purity testing low, making it accessible to even the small rice farmers. <br><br>The CNHRRDC is very concerned about the theft of their new hybrid varieties. Identification allows for patenting which keeps them funded and able to continue their research. In the first trial I used 96 different primers to find the ones with potential of identifying the hybrid. I did the next two trials on the primers that showed potential. <br><br>My result was successful. I found 4 primers that showed the polymorphism of Guangzhan 635/1128. RM110 and RM276 had consistent, clear results for all trials. They can be used to test the identity and seed purity of this hybrid variety. The technique I implemented can also be used for all the new and improved hybrid varieties to come.

ANALYSIS OF PLANT PROMOTER EXPRESSION ABILITIES AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO VIRAL PROMOTERS IN TRANSGENIC PRODUCE
Stephen Taylor Bethel
Lake Brantley High School, Altamonte Springs, FL

Mainstream use of viral promoters in transgenic plants has caused unnecessary fear of consumption of these products. The purpose of my research was to evaluate constitutive and tissue specific plant promoters as potential alternatives to currently used viral promoters. It was hypothesized that the 2S Albumin Core promoter (pLCA4) would be the most efficient plant promoter.<br><br>Five constructs selected for study were transformed into tobacco seedlings using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. After transformation, stable gene expression in leaf explants was quantified by counting fluorescent shoots, glowing under blue light due to the Green Fluorescent Protein gene (GFP) that has been incorporated in the constructs. When the constructs were evaluated under a beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter system 53.85% of explants with Cauliflower Mosaic Virus promoter (CaMV35S) expressed GUS at a mean activity level of 7.22 pmol MU/mg/min compared to 47.62% with Cassava Vein Mosaic promoter at 2.39 pmol MU/mg/min, 47.06% with pLCA4 at 3.18 pmol MU/mg/min, 38.71% with the Experimental Grape promoter at .59 pmol MU/mg/min, and 37.50% with 2S Albumin Core promoter (pLCA1) at 1.1 pmol MU/mg/min. The data suggest that, although the viral promoter CaMV35S outperformed the other constructs, pLCA4 (plant promoter) has promising results for further experimentation. It can also be suggested that pLCA1 is inferior to pLCA4, possibly due to extraneous code in the full length promoter. If pLCA4 can be further refined for practical use, the fear of consumption of transgenic produce due to viral promoters will be eased.

OPTIMIZING ROOT GROWTH IN ARABIDOPSIS BY ROOT COMPETITION AND PHOSPHATE DEFICIENCY
Brigitte Mercedes Wittmer
Episcopal High School of Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL

Phosphate is a non-renewable resource in ample supply all over the world. However, finding a new method of growth with phosphate deficiency and root competition among paired, non-kin plants may help maximize root growth when phosphate reserves become deficient in this century. Maximum root growth could provide maximum crop yields in root vegetables. The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effects of root competition and phosphate deficiency on the root growth of Arabidopsis. Arabidopsis was grown in an agar medium in Petri plates. 48 Petri plates contained 100µM adequate phosphate. 50 plates contained 20µM deficient in phosphate. Within each concentration of phosphate were five groups of seeds: C, L, CL, CC, and LL. CL was the 1 to 1 non-kin pairing of Landsberg and Columbia ecotypes while CC and LL were the 1 to 1 kin pairing of themselves. C and L were solitarily-planted conditions as the controls. The plants were harvested after 32 days of growth. Each plant's total plant, shoot, and root masses were determined. Based on t-tests and trends, root competition did not overcome phosphate deficiency. Thus, root competition and phosphate deficiency did not maximize root growth. No null hypotheses were rejected due to insignificant differences between most groups. Seeing as Landsberg grew significantly different than Columbia within phosphate concentrations, an interaction may occur between the genetic expressions of plants and environmental stress. So if farmers want to continue high crop production when phosphate becomes strained, apical meristems and root competition among plants of different families will need to be further studied.

Set up cloning reactions. Once complete, pick approximately ten white or light blue colonies for analysis. Culture 10 colonies in LB medium containing kanamycin. Isolate plasmid DNA. Analyze the plasmid by restriction. At select parts, restriction enzyme digestion is used to determine the genus of a bacterium. Data collected includes 13 morphologies of bacteria found in alfalfa seedlings from cow pies and also PCR, sequencing, & identification results. When sequenced, Enterobactor, Pseudomonas and Pantoea. The significance of results is to establish & be a reference to future research. Data collected showed that there are coliforms present inside alfalfa seedlings. It was also observed that coliforms were also found in bulk of the cow pie. This can prove that coliforms found in plants were first in bulk of cow pie and as alfalfa plant developed and took up nutrients, it also absorbed the coliforms.

THE CROSS POLLINATION OF AN EDIBLE PUMPKIN WITH A POWDERY-MILDEW RESISTANT PUMPKIN TO CREATE AN EDIBLE POWDERY-MILDEW RESISTANT PUMPKIN
Jacob Donald Ness
New Milford High School, New Milford, CT

The purpose of the experiment is to create an edible powdery mildew resistant pumpkin. This plant would be beneficial to farmers, saving time and money, as the plant is less likely to die from powdery mildew. Chemicals also would not be needed, and the crop could be marketed as “natural” or “organic” if chemicals weren’t used. Furthermore, chemicals used to prevent powdery mildew are not introduced into the environment.<br><br>It was hypothesized that if a powdery mildew resistant “charisma” pumpkin is crossed with an edible “baby bear” pumpkin, then an edible, powdery mildew resistant f1 generation will be created, because the powdery mildew resistance genes and the “edible” genes will be present in the f1 generation. <br><br>For the procedure, an edible and powdery mildew resistant pumpkin were cross-pollinated, forming an f1 generation. The f1 generation’s dried seeds were planted and tested against control pumpkins for susceptibility to powdery mildew.<br><br>The first trial found the f1 generation to have resistance to powdery mildew, lasting 19 days before contracting the mildew. The second trial found the f1 generation to resist for 21 days. It was also found that the flesh of the f1 generation pumpkin was hard and compact, similar to the edible “baby bear” pumpkin. <br><br>Based upon the data, the “edible” and powdery mildew resistance genes of the parental generation pumpkins were transferred to the f1 generation.<br><br>For further experimentation, one could perform a cross using different parental pumpkins to see if different resistance patterns would be present in f1 generations.

PLANT TISSUE CULTURE: SCREENING OF BLUEBERRIES' VULNERABILITY TO BACTERIAL LEAF SCORCH DISEASE
Lauren Marie Cook
Spalding High School, Griffin, GA

Xylella fastidiosa is a bacteria that creates the disease of Bacterial Leaf Scorch in many plant types, particularly the blueberry. The growth margin of blueberry sales has sky-rocketed, but due to the threat of Xylella fastidiosa, growers are now looking to scientists to save their crops.<br><br> To isolate the bacteria and treat each plant is the ultimate goal for many scientists, but the goal for this experiment was to create a more efficient, more effective method for screening the blueberries for Bacterial Leaf Scorch Disease.<br><br> The steps of the experiment were to make agar, sterilize cutting of blueberry shoots, propogate the plants, inject the shoots with Xylella fastidiosa, chop and streak, run the ELISA test, and record the results. <br><br> When the data was recorded, the result of the experiment showed that the contending factor of reliability was reported in the comparison graphs of the agar tests versus the ELISA tests. Concluding that with only the cutting and streaking method, one would have a 40.9% margin of error with the CS20 agar, and a 34.1% margin of error with the PW agar. However, the test did show the differences in the plants susepibility. Compared with the ELISA results the cutting and streaking method is conclusive because when combined, the tests would provide the information that was needed. <br><br> The cutting and streaking portion of the test when analyzed with the results of the ELISA test can be considered an efficient and effective method of testing. This test will allow scientists to show farmers which blueberry types are more resistant to the bacteria. In essence, scientists will be able to give farmers the information for a safer, and more stable crop.

ALGAE--THE GREEN FUEL: OPTIMIZING GROWTH AND LIPID COMPOSITION IN ALGAE THROUGH ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS
Wenxi Li
Thomas Chilton Jasper High School, Plano, TX

Algae fuel, the 3rd generation of biofuel, is the future of renewable transportation fuel. Exploring methods of increasing the quantity of lipid will bring great potentials in algae-diesel productivity. Optimizing growth and lipid composition through three types of environmental stress, nitrogen, light, and CO2 deficiency were studied in saltwater with algae strain, Nannochloropsis. <br><br>For the nitrogen experiment, algae were cultured in normal conditions until standard growth was reached, centrifuged to rid of the nutrients, and re-suspended under 3 different levels of nitrogen for 5 days: nitrogen sufficient, ½ nitrogen, and nitrogen free. The light experiment had 3 different amounts of light: low light (10 fc), medium light (40 fc) and high light (70 fc). For the CO2 experiment, the speed of aeration was adjusted to provide 3 different amounts of CO2: High, Low, and No CO2 (airtight). Algae from all experiments were then harvested for lipid extraction through the hexane-solvent method. <br><br>The results show that nitrogen free had the highest percentage of lipids out of dry weight (11.11%), followed by ½ nitrogen (3.05%), then nitrogen sufficient (1.74%). For the light experiment, medium light had the highest percentage (6.38%), followed by High light (5.75%), and Low light (3.77%). No additional CO2 had the highest percentage (12.12%), followed by Low CO2 (10.39%), then High CO2 (9.80%). <br><br>The experiment indicates that environmental stress increased lipid percentage, but growth and total mass of lipids should also be considered. This could be used to cost-effectively produce biofuels and applied to both open and closed-culture systems.

IMPATIENS SHIMIANENSIS SP. NOV (BALSAMINACEAE): A NEW SPECIES FROM SOUTHWEST CHINA BASED ON MORPHOLOGICAL AND MOLECULAR EVIDENCE
Gechen Zhang
Rockwood Summit High School, Fenton, MO

Impatiens shimianensis, a new species in the balsam family (Balsaminaceae), is discovered, described, and illustrated. This new species is morphologically most similar to I. delavayi. However, the two species differ in that the upper portion of the lower sepal of I. shimianensis is yellow and the lower portion of the lower sepal has brown stripes, while the whole lower sepal of I. delavayi is dark purple or pink. Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) and other molecular methods were used to sequence the selected genes of this new species for comparison with gene sequences of other species in the genus in GenBank available online. The two selected genes were internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and the chloroplast atpB-rbcL intergenic spacer in consideration of their relatively fast-evolving rates. Phylogenetic analyses based on DNA sequences of the ITS and atpB-rbcL showed that the species discovered formed a well-supported clade with I. barbata, I. corchorifolia, I. delavayi, and I. poculifer. In addition to these genetically related species, a few other morphologically related but molecularly un-sampled species were also compared with the species newly discovered. Impatiens shimianensis can easily be distinguished from all these species by having yellowish white flowers, dark red spur tips, and purple abaxial leaf surface. In addition, the muri located on the pollen grains of the new species are much flatter than that of its relatives. Lastly, Impatiens shimianensis differs from its closest relative in 49 combined ITS and atpB-rbcL sequences. Therefore, the identity of Impatiens shimianensis as new is confirmed.

THE CHAMPION OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS OR WHEN 3 = 4 ARE THE PHOTOSYNTHESIS PATHWAYS FOR C3 AND C4 PLANTS ALL THEY ARE CRACKED UP TO BE WHEN EXPOSED TO VARYING AMOUNTS OF LIGHT?
Loida Garcia Guajardo
Park Christian School, Moorhead, MN

This experiment attempts to determine which carbon fixation plant, C3 or C4, is more affected by the amount of light exposure. The C3 plant, the common string bean, and the C4 plant, maize, were used. These crop plants are widely grown to provide food for people and livestock. <br><br>The hypothesis states that C4 plants growing in full exposure to light will have a greater amount of chloroplasts and perform photosynthesis more efficiently than their C3 counterparts. <br><br>When light exposure decreases so will the ability for C4 plants to photosynthesis. When the light increases, so does the productiveness of C4 plants. C3 plants’ productivity doesn’t change when light decreases because they might have reached the top of their range of photosynthesis. When this range is reached, productivity doesn’t increase with continual exposure to light. C3 plants can only photosynthesize to a certain point. If sunlight doesn’t drop before the point of highest productivity, the C3 plant’s photosynthesis will function normally while the C4 plant’s will lessen as exposure to light decreases.<br><br>The part of hypothesis rejected is that the amount of chloroplasts in corn will rise when exposed to low light (LL). The efficiency of the chloroplasts was the same in both levels of lights in C3 and C4 plants, and not affected by the levels of light. The amount of Chlorophyll A and B drop dramatically in C4 plants, as hypothesized. C3 plants didn’t have drastic changes between the plants in high light (HL) and those in LL.

IS THERE GENE FLOW FROM GENETICALLY MODIFIED GLYCINE MAX TO OTHER ORGANISMS?
Benjamin Eliott Lewis
Jackson High School, Jackson, OH

The purpose of this project is to have a clear conclusion on whether Marestail (Conyza canadensis) has become resistant to Roundup naturally or if the Roundup Ready soybeans (Glycine max) caused this resistance. With Roundup Ready soybeans you can apply the Roundup after the soybeans have been planted. The problem is that Roundup does not kill many new resistant forms of Marestail. Farmers would need to apply a different herbicide to their field before planting soybeans to keep the Marestail from growing and that is exactly what they were trying to avoid, a second herbicide. The hypothesis states: if Marestail has become resistant because of gene transfer from Roundup Ready soybeans it will contain the CP4 form of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) gene, the “roundup resistance” gene, found in Roundup Ready soybeans. DNA from both the soybeans and Marestail were extracted, the primers were made to the 35S promoter that drives the EPSPS gene in the Roundup Ready soybeans, the DNA was amplified by using polymerase chain reaction and finally gel electrophoresis was run to obtain the results. The data in this experiment showed that the EPSPS gene was present in the Roundup Ready soybeans, but not the Marestail. It was concluded that the hypothesis was disproved.

AQUEOUS EXTRACT OF LEMON LEAVES AS A NOVEL POWERFUL INSECTICIDE AGAINST TRIALEURODES VAPORARIORUM (WHITEFLY)
Xiangbo Meng
Beijing 101 Middle School, Beijing, CHINA

Trialeurodes Vaporariorum, commonly known as the glasshouse or greenhouse whitefly, is a primary species of insect pest of many fruit, vegetable and ornamental plants that constitutes a serious problem to agriculture and horticulture worldwide. Currently in China, chemical insecticides are commonly used to control Trialeurodes Vaporariorum. The chemical control, however, is associated with low effectiveness, drug resistance, residual and environmental pollution. In this study, we sought to explore the insecticidal potential of lemon leaves against Trialeurodes Vaporariorum. The results demonstrated that a 10%~13% aqueous extract of lemon leaves or eucalyptol solution (1:2000, v/v) was able to completely kill Trialeurodes Vaporariorum. This aqueous extract of lemon leaves contained more than 50 types of volatile components as revealed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses, among which eucalyptol, limonene and cis-geraniol were the major constitutes. In conclusion, aqueous extract of lemon leaves possesses a powerful insecticidal activity against Trialeurodes Vaporariorum and thereby offers a novel and environmental pollution-free agent to control Trialeurodes Vaporariorum.

A PRELIMINARY STUDY ON THE ROLE OF AUXIN DISTRIBUTION IN STRESS AVOIDANCE OF PLANT ROOTS
Yilin Fan
The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China, Beijing, CHINA

The present study estabilished an experimental system for observing effects of stresses on Arabidopsis root growth. DR5::GUS and pH-GFP transgenic Arabidopsis plants were used to observe the effects of stresses on root growth and auxin/pH in root tips. Overall, the roots of plant seedlings grew normally on complete control media while on media with half containing NaCl or mannitol, some roots somehow grew in avoidance of the stresses, with either a curvature or an inhibition of gravitropism. To understand the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon, auxin distrution and pH dynamics in root tips during root growth were measured. Using GUS staining microscopy, we observed that the roots with a curvature differed from the control roots in auxin distribution and content. The auxin concentrated at apical meristem and root cap of the control roots but was also distributed in the vascular tissue of the roots with a curvature. This indicates that auxin may play an important role in stress avoidance of Arabidopsis roots. In addition, we observed no obvious difference between the control roots and the roots with a curvature in terms of pH in root tip cells, via laser scanning confocal microscopy using pH-GFP transgenic Arabidopsis plants. This result implicates that pH in root tip cells would not play a significant role in stress avoidance of plant roots. The observation on stress avoidance of plant roots may provide a clue to further understanding the mechanisms of plant behavior.

FERTILIZER INFLUENCE IN GERMINATION AND SEEDLINGS PRODUCTION OF A BRAZILIAN ATLANTIC RAINFOREST SPECIES, SCHINUS TEREBENTHIFOLIUS
Daiane Fraga Dias
Colegio Fundacao Bradesco Gravatai, Gravatai, BRASIL

The Schinus terebenthifolius is a shrub-type vegetal species very typical at the Brazilian Rainforest Biome. The increase of human interference in natural areas is causing a remarkable decrease in the area of the Biome. This situation makes necessary to product seedlings of species from this Biome, in order to restitute them, later, to still preserved environments. The objectives of the research were to test and to confront the germination of seeds and the production of seedlings from this species, utilizing two types of fertilizers: NPK and the manure produced by the residuals from routine activities of the school. The research work was developed in the school’s vivarium, where were placed two trays with, each one, 204 tubets of polipropilen. One of the trays (BI) received NPK (04-14-08), 8g/kg, and the other tray (BII) received the same quantity of manure. Each tubet received, on average, three seeds. The germination period was adequated to the bibliographic references (between 10 and 15 days). The results show thet the number of germinated vegetables (total number seeds/tray) in BI was 291 (47,55%) and in BII was 130 (21,24%). Observations demonstrate that the sewed samples in tubets with manure, if presented a precocious germination (starting at the 17th day), had a minor production of seedlings. The ones with NPK started to germinate at the 13th day, but has a major productivity. The seedlings engendered during the experiment will be planted in an forest area near Gravataí River, and their development will be followed by the researchers.

ANTIMICROBIAL EFFECT OF CUMINUM CYMINUM FRUIT EXTRACT AND ISOLATION OF ITS ACTIVE COMPONENTS
Fangzhou Xiao
No. 2 Secondary School Attached to East China Normal University, Shanghai, CHINA

Cumin (Cuminum cyminum) fruit is a common condiment in food with a long history and used widely in traditional medicine. This study focused on the isolation of its antimicrobial components and exploration of their antimicrobial features.<br><br> Firstly, antimicrobial effects of cumin fruit extracts from different solvents were tested. Petroleum ether (PE) extract was found to be the strongest against S. aureus and S.cerevisiae, which was also stronger than potassium sorbate (PS) and sodium benzoate (SB), two common chemical food preservatives.<br><br> Secondly, active components in PE extract were isolated with silica gel chromatography. Two compounds, cuminaldehyde and cumic acid were obtained and their structures were assigned by spectra of GC/MS and NMR.<br><br> Then, Cuminaldehyde and cumic acid were tested against common food spoilage microorganisms, S.aureus, E.coli, S.cerevisiae and A.niger, and they inhibited the growth of all tested microorganisms at 250mg/L and 1g/L respectively, more strongly than PS and SB. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cuminaldehyde and cumic acid against E.coli were 150mg/L and 1g/L respectively.<br><br> Furthermore, E.coli was employed as a model to study the antimicrobial effect at different pH levels and its persistence. Cuminaldehyde was equally effective at a wider pH range (pH 5-9) than that of PS and SB, and the effect of cumic acid was stronger in acidic conditions. Cuminaldehyde (150mg/L) also inhibited E.coli growth completely throughout the 7d observation, while E.coli grew back in a PS or SB treatment.<br><br> Finally, cuminaldehyde and cumic acid was safe to mice at MIC dosages.<br><br> In all, this study indicates cumin extract and its active components showed potential application in food industry as natural food preservatives.

A COMPARISON OF THE EFFICACY OF STANDARD COMMERCIAL MOUTHWASH VS. HERBAL-BASED MOUTHWASH ON THE CONTROL OF ORAL PLAQUE FORMATION
Kaitlin Elizabeth Larkin
Wentzville Holt High School, Wentzville, MO

Some herbs have the natural ability to inhibit biofilm formation, such as those created in the mouth by plaque. Good oral health depends on one’s ability to remove harmful plaque. This can be done in a multitude of ways; brushing, flossing, or using mouthwash. Certain commercial mouthwashes, particularly Listerine, contain alcohol. Alcohol decreases production of saliva. A decrease in saliva creates drying of the gums, which can lead to serious oral health problems. Natural herbal mouthwashes typically do not contain alcohol. Using strong herbs (commonly used in the dental industry) such as peppermint (known for its ability to relieve toothaches) to create herbal mouthwashes, it is hypothesized that these should be just as effective at oral plaque control as Listerine due to the plants natural defenses to bacteria in the wild.

THE VERY VARIABLE SHIN OAK
Nathan Caleb Taylor
Taylor Home School, Lamesa, TX

The tough little trees known as shin oak (Quercus harvardii) are interesting little shrubs. Their height is usually lower than knee high, they provide shelter for the endangered sand dune lizard and the declining lesser prairie chicken, and the plant itself, can vary considerably. My project was to determine how 5 variations in a 25 acre research area related to the other oak species. Not all the shin oaks are just shin oak variations. There are many distinct characteristics that suggest that they are something different. At first I did not know what to make of this. But with observation, photo documentation, and research, I came to the conclusion that 3 or 4 of the variations are through hybridization, 1 may be through natural selection, and 1 is a natural variation. Although there is little documentation on the shin oak at this time, this is just the beginning of my research. I plan to learn as much as possible about this species and to continue to educate people about this fascinating plant.

THE EFFECTS OF ALLIUM SATIVUM ON THE GERMINATION AND SEEDLING GROWTH OF ORYZA SATIVA
Austin Blake Pierce
South Pemiscot High School, Steele, MO

Do volatiles from crushed garlic material inhibit seed germination and subsequent seedling growth of rice? If garlic volatiles are added to the rice seedlings then the germination of the growth of Oryza sativa (rice) seedlings will be inhibited. Oryza sativa (rice) was obtained from Pierce Seed Inc. Allium sativum (garlic) and commercial products were obtained from the local grocery store. The plant material was crushed with a garlic hand press and 1.0 gram samples and placed in an aluminum foil boat. The crushed plant material was placed in petri dish containing the Oryza sativa (rice) seedling with 3 ml of water. The dish was sealed with masking tape and incubated for three days at 30 degrees Celsius. Controls were set up as described above but without the garlic. Germination rates were recorded and total seedling length were measured and recorded fafter 5 days. Commercial products were tested in the rice seed bioassay. Crushed garlic and potting soil were mixed with 25 seeds on the surface and covered with potting soil. Germination and seedling growth were measured as above. Results indicate that fresh garlic inhibits rice seed germination and growth more than the commercial products and the control. Garlic incorporated into the soil inhibited the germination and growth of the rice seedlings. In conclusion the hypothesis was accepted. Garlic did inhibit the germination and growth of rice seedlings.

HOW MUCH NITROGEN DOES GLYCINE MAX ADD TO THE SOIL?
Matthew S. Gerdes
Franklin Public School, Franklin, NE

Nitrogen is essential for all plant life and increases the yield of crops. Costs to fertilize keep increasing. Keeping these two concepts in mind, I planned to investigate using soybeans to naturally raise the nitrogen levels of the soil. Soybeans are one of the most common legume crop grown in Nebraska. They can add 10 to 50 pounds of nitrogen per acre. Thus, when grown in rotation with corn, grain sorghum, or wheat, they could reduce the need for nitrogen fertilizer. <br><br> I first researched how soybeans produced nitrogen and fertilized the soil. Legume nitrogen fixation starts with the formation of a nodule. The soil bacterium, Rhizobiu, invades the root and multiplies within the cortex cells. The plant supplies all the necessary nutrients and energy for the bacteria. When nodules are young and not yet fixing nitrogen, they are usually white or gray inside. As they grow, they gradually turn pink in color, indicating nitrogen fixation has started. The pink or red color is caused by leghemoglobin that controls oxygen flow to the bacteria. <br><br> The purpose of my project is to test the amount of nitrogen soybeans actually put into the soil. I hypothesize that higher yield soybeans will add more nitrogen. To test this hypothesis, I took soil samples of different soybean test plots and chart the nitrogen levels. I then compared the nitrogen levels with the bushel yield to see if the nitrogen levels are higher with a greater yield. <br><br> One test plot was sprayed with kickstand manganese and yielded 84.2 bushels per acre. This plot returned 23 lbs. of nitrogen per acre. The control plot yielded 65.5 bushels per acre but only released 7 lbs of nitrogen per acre. My hypothesis was correct. The higher yielding soybeans released the most nitrogen.

PHYTOREMEDIATION: DOES AGE MAKE A DIFFERENCE?
Kaylene Jay Ramos
Box Elder High School, Box Elder, MT

Sunflowers have known remediation abilities by their use to remove uranium from the areas surrounding Chernobyl, Russia. This experiment examined the effects of age on a sunflower’s remediation capabilities in an environment contaminated with heavy metals generally found around mine sites. Sunflowers were grown in individual pots and introduced into soils containing: ferric nitrate, cupric nitrate, lead nitrate, zinc nitrate, mercurous nitrate, and silver nitrate at two week intervals; plants were grown in contaminated soil for a period of two weeks, removed and frozen in preparation for metal assays. Metal assays were performed using the ICP (Inductively Coupled Plasma Spectrophotometer) and the CVAA (Cold Vapor Atomic Absorption) machines. The experimental hypothesis was proven incorrect, as there was not a directly proportional relationship between the age of the plant and its ability to remediate metals. Instead, it was determined that the sunflowers were most effective at ages five weeks to seven weeks, as shown by their uptake of zinc, copper, mercury and lead.

THE EFFECTS OF SEAWATER PH ON KELP (SACCHARINA LATISSIMA AND AGARUM CLATHRATUM) EGG DEVELOPMENT
Colin Zheng
Juneau-Douglas High School, Juneau, AK

Kelp forests are vital to many animals. To determine whether ocean acidification influences kelp, I examined the effects of environmental pH levels on kelp egg development. I hypothesized that the optimal pH for development would be 8.1 due to the fact that the current oceanic pH level is at 8.1.<br><br> In the experiment, two species of kelp (Saccharina latissima and Agarum clathratum) were studied. Gametophytes from the two species were cultivated for test subjects. They were then homogenized and grown in artificial seawater with PESI solution added. The pH levels were adjusted to 7.5, 7.7, 7.9, and 8.1, in an incubator controlling temperature (50ºF), daylight time (14:10hr; light:dark), and light intensity (13-22 µmoles of photons/m^2/s). At various times, growth, cell count, egg formation, and blade formation (indicates fertilization) were taken. <br><br> Growths for Saccharina latissima between the pH levels 7.5-8.1 ranged between 4.1-4.5 cells/day, egg formations ranged between 11.00-5.54 eggs/female, and blade formations ranged between 1.00-5.00 blades/female. Growths for Agarum clathratum between the pH levels of 7.5-8.1 ranged between 4.8-5.7 cells/day and egg formations ranged between 2.79-1.21 eggs/female. Growths, egg formations, and blade formations were compared over time and no clear trends regarding growths and egg/blade formations as a function of pH appeared. ANOVA’s also confirmed that the measured values among the pH treatments were not statistically significant. <br><br> In conclusion, the data does not support my hypothesis and supports the null hypothesis, which states that between the pH levels of 7.5-8.1, there are no effects on kelp egg development.

THE EFFECTS OF SELECTED ISOMERS AND HEAVY METALS ON THE CHEMICAL KINETICS OF POLYPHENOL OXIDASE
Laura Jessica Chesnut
Miami High School, Miami, OK

Northeast Oklahoma is a former center for lead and zinc mining. Research suggests that high levels of heavy metals in the body can affect the blood stream, nervous system, and kidneys. The purpose of this project is to test heavy metals and selected isomers on enzyme function through the study of kinetics. Enzymes are proteins that catalyze specific reactions. The project will evaluate the Polyphenol oxidase (PPO)- Catechol system which produces a product called Benzoquinone, which turns burnt orange. This experiment will test substrate specificity and the rate of reaction of isomer competitors. Additionally, Catechol and PPO will be tested in the presence of Heavy Metals. Enzyme activity is determined by a change in color as measured by absorbance using a spectrophotometer connected to a Logger- Pro™. The rate of reaction was determined by measuring the slope of the first 200 seconds of each reaction as compared to the control. The hypothesis is that isomers of the substrate Catechol will inhibit enzyme function and that the heavy metals tested: Zinc, Copper, Manganese, Cadmium, and Lead will decrease the rate of reaction significantly. The null hypothesis states that there will be no differences between the activity of the control PPO and the experimental groups. The results support the hypothesis that isomers of catechol do inhibit enzyme function. The hypothesis that heavy metals decrease enzyme function has also been supported; although, copper has a positive slope associated with function. This is because copper is the cofactor for this reaction. And although the enzyme functioned in the presence of excess copper (1.704E-4: Reaction rate), the reaction of that was still not as highly functioning as that of the control (3.333E-4: Reaction rate).

UTILIZING SOLAR ENERGY AND MAGNETISM TO ACCELERATE PLANT GROWTH AND SEED GERMINATION & ENRICHING SAND OR INFERTILE SOIL WITH ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF PLANTS, TO OBTAIN FERTILE LANDS IDEAL FOR AGRICULTURE
Zeina Hani Khalaji
Modern Montessori School, Amman, JORDAN

This project tries to solve the problem of hindered agricultural development due to the unavailability of fertile soil and enough fresh water to complement a long growth period, in various places all around the world.<br><br>Several experiments were carried out to determine the ideal conditions under which the organic soil would be fabricated. As to the second part of my project, I aimed at trying to determine the ideal position and strength of the magnetic field which would accelerate the rates of seed germination and plant growth the most. Furthermore, it was investigated whether a magnetic or electromagnetic field (for applicability) would affect the rates of seed germination, plant growth or both. Moreover, after establishing that a magnetic field affects both the rates of seed germination and plant growth, I investigated whether the effect of a magnetic field is species specific, and so I tested nursery plants and not wheat, which are more profitable, and the end result was very promising, as electromagnetic fields generated by relatively weak currents (1.20 A), tend to almost double the rates of plant growth and seed germination.<br><br>The final system consists primarily of two parts, one of which is composed of a solar panel and an insulated incubator, which would aerobically decompose the food wastes utilizing heat energy from the sun, at temperature 50°C and pH 5.0, which were determined during the experiments. The second part of the design would consist of a solar panel, a boiling chamber in which vacuum and sea water are pumped, a turbine, a generator and a battery in which the generated electrical energy is stored. The purpose of the second part is to accelerate plant growth by inducing an electromagnetic field from the current generated.

UNDER THE RAINBOW - PHASE 3: HOW DIFFERENT COLORED LIGHT AFFECTS VEGETABLE PLANTS
Katharine Nicole Beason
James Madsion High School, San Antonio, TX

The purpose of Phase 3 was to measure filtered sunlight’s effect with two separate experiments to see if colored light could optimize plant growth and transpiration. Part 1 would validate earlier results while determining that red light positively affected leaf size, plant mass, leaf mass and in addition if green light positively affected root length. Forty-eight young cabbage plants were divided into groups of 12 under PVC pipe cages covered with either red, green, blue, or for the Control Group, no plastic in Part 1. Height and leaf number were measured every two days for 36 days; other measurements were collected Day 36. Statistically significant outcomes resulted. The Green Group grew taller than Red and Control Groups. The Blue Group had longer and wider leaves, total plant mass, and total leaf mass than Red Group. The Red Group had more leaves than Blue Group plants. <br><br>In Part 2, four potometers were constructed to measure filtered sunlight’s effect on plant transpiration. Thirty-two tomato plants were divided into four groups of 8 plants each. Eight trials were run, each consisting of one potometer under one of the three colors of plastic and a control potometer with no plastic filter. Total transpiration was measured every five minutes for 45 minutes. Statistically significant outcomes resulted. The Red Group had a greater transpiration rate and the Green Group had a lower transpiration rate than the Control Group. <br><br>In conclusion, Blue Group plants most efficiently yielded plant mass and transpired the same as the Control Group.

THE EFFECTS OF KOCHIA EXTRACTS ON THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF SOLANUM TUBEROSUM TO POTATO VIRUS Y (PVY)
Misha Ann Kearns
North Toole County/ Sunburst High School, Sunburst, MT

The primary purpose of this study is to determine the effects of Kochia extracts on the susceptibility of crops to Potato Virus Y (PVY). Through information I learned from last year’s project, I tested whether Kochia extracts from the roots, stems, and leaves, improved the crops’ reaction to the virus. The tests used include an arbitrary scale assessing the severity of symptoms of individual potato plants, the heights of varying groups, and the numbers of flowering stalks. <br><br> It was hypothesized that the extracts would produce a significant difference in the growth and development of the plants by decreasing the viability of PVY. I tested Kochia because weeds are known survivors and grow under a variety of adverse conditions. It was therefore expected that the Kochia extract would inhibit the expression of the Potato Virus Y on the potato plants. <br><br> The experiment consisted of collecting Kochia weed, separating the Kochia weed into three groups (roots, stems, and leaves), preparing an extract, and watering plants with a dilution of assigned extract daily. After an acceptable exposure to the extract, the key part of the experiment consisted of inoculating each plant with PVY, rating each plant on a scale of severity of symptoms, and conducting t-tests to determine statistical significance. <br><br> Interestingly enough, after testing the difference in plant height, flower production, and plant severity of infectivity, the group watered with extracts made from Kochia stems experienced significantly less infectivity then the control group.

BIODIESEL FROM SUNFLOWERS PHASE III - AN ANALYSIS OF PLANTING DATES, SOIL TEMPERATURE, AND OIL CONTENT
Jordan T. Lestina
Dove Creek High School, Dove Creek, CO

This project was designed to determine if planting date or soil temperature had an influence on the oil content of sunflowers grown for bio-diesel production.<br><br>I predicted that planting date would affect the oil content of sunflowers more than the soil temperature at time of planting. Those sunflowers planted earlier would produce a higher oil content than those planted later.<br><br>The experiment took place on 5 fields with 4 different planting dates on each. Planting was done in one week intervals during a one month period. Soil temperature was recorded at time of each planting. Soil samples were also taken every two weeks throughout the growing season and analyzed for moisture content. When the sunflowers were ready for harvest, seed samples were taken from each plot and sent to a laboratory for oil content testing.<br><br>An analysis of the data collected revealed none of the relationships I expected to find between any of the variables. As planting dates progressed from earlier to later, soil temperatures did not get warmer as I thought they would. Oil content did not exhibit any correlation between planting date, soil temperature or soil moisture either.<br><br>The results of my project did not support my hypothesis. Sunflowers that were planted earlier than others did not produce sunflowers with a higher oil content. All other planting dates were analyzed also and no relationship to oil content was found. Soil temperature was also analyzed, but no relation was found to oil content here either.

EFFECT OF METAL HALIDE AND FLUORESCENT LIGHTING ON THE OVERALL HEALTH OF PHASEOLUS VULGARIS
Jarek Alan VanOrder
Mecosta Osceola Math, Science & Technology Center, Big Rapids, MI

The researcher was interested in the way different types of supplemental lighting affects the growth of greenhouse plants. The problem proposed in the experiment was what supplemental lighting would be more beneficial, Fluorescent or Metal Halide, for the Phaseolus vulgaris (bush bean plant). To test the question three tubs of 10 bush bean plants per tub were planted and placed in a standard greenhouse. Two of the tubs received 10 hours of supplemental lighting. One received supplemental light from a Fluorescent grow light and another tub received supplemental lighting from a Metal Halide light. The plants grew for 6 weeks. At the end of the 6 weeks the individual plant height was taken and the fresh weight was taken by plant tub. The Metal Halide Group tub had the heaviest fresh weight and the tallest (average) plants. The Fluorescent had the second heaviest fresh weight and second tallest (average) plants. It was determined that Metal Halide lights are more beneficial for bush bean plants than Fluorescent lights in a greenhouse environment.

SUSTAINED ALGAE GROWTH IN AN ENCLOSED AGITATED ENVIRONMENT
Kaylee Shandale Glenn
Weber High School, Pleasant View, UT

Algae has been found to be a viable resource in the production of bio-fuels, but growth limitations exist for fuel production. This study investigates the effect of agitation, in an enclosed photobioreactor, on the growth of the green alga, Neochloris oleoabundans. Past methods have involved algae being “naturally” agitated as opposed to manually agitated and grown in an enclosed environment. By growing algae in a photobioreactor, many problems are eliminated including the loss of water through evaporation, loss of CO2, and the problems with extreme temperatures. <br><br>It is hypothesized that the fast-propeller agitator will produce a higher culture density and/or growth rate than the other three agitators and the non-agitated control. An array of five photobioreactors was designed to test each agitator: fast-propeller, slow-propeller, Orbital Shaker, and water pump. In each photobioreactor, the light intensity, media, temperature, and pH were the same so the only experimental variable was the type of agitation.<br><br>Samples from each environment were placed into a spectrophotometer, to determine culture density. Results of the first two replicate photobioreactors show that the orbital shaker had the highest culture density, though in the concluding test, the non-agitated control maintained the highest density, indicating that agitation isn’t a vital factor in producing algae. <br><br>Algae holds a significant promise as a way for converting solar energy into liquid fuel, such as biodiesel, but it is critical to understand optimum methods for growing algae in order to reach potential productivity.

DETERMINING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT CREATED BY THE REPLACEMENT OF INDIGINOUS WETLAND SPECIES (SPECIFICALLY TYPHA LATIFOLIA) BY THE INVASIVE SPECIES PHRAGMITES AUSTRALIS
Chase Wyatt Bourgeous
Syracuse High School, Syracuse, UT

The invasive species Phragmites australis has recently replaced large populations of indigenous flora (studies dealt specifically with Typha latifolia, or cattails) in wetlands. <br><br>The purpose of this project was to collect qualitative and quantitative data to discern and numerically represent the ecological impact on wetlands that is created by phragmites replacing cattails. The study was in three parts: 1. Water testing (pH variations in water caused by Phragmites and cattails) 2. phytoremediative capabilities of the two plants, specifically their hyperaccumulation of lead nitrate (PbNO3) ,and 3. circulation of usable nitrogen by microbial action. <br><br>1: Water pH levels were taken from T. latifolia and P. australis stands in several locations. Stands being directly compared to one another had similar size and the same influent water source. <br><br>2: Seed heads were germinated in a greenhouse. The sprouts were then transplanted, and then 1200 ppm PbNO3 was added to the soil. <br><br>3: Root systems and complete stalks of the two species were collected and the two plants and parts were blended separately and put into static fluid where the supernatant was used to streak specialized agar plates to ascertain whether nitrogen fixing bacteria were present in either species. <br><br>The data indicated that cattails have very high higher hyperaccumulation of lead from soil, maintain healthy pH in water systems, and contain bacteria which facilitate the circulation of usable nitrogen particulates. These sets of data demonstrate the ramifications of indigenous flora replacement and provide conclusive evidence that favors the eradication of invasive phragmites.

CONSERVATION OF AN ENDANGERED PLANT, NYMPHOIDES INDICA, BY A SIMPLE AND NOVEL METHOD
Noriaki Namba
Niigata Prifectural Kashiwazaki Shoyo Secondary Education School, Kashiwazaki-shi, Niigata, JAPAN

Water snow flake,an aquatic Nymphoides indica (Lin.) Kuntze is a perennial plant and is mainly distributed in Asia. This endangered plant faces extinction in Japan because of urbanization which has reduced their habitats and has made the environment worse. N. indica proliferates by vegetative propagules as well as sexual reproduction. The former is the main mechanism in this species.<br><br>As I found that adventitious buds were formed from a leaf fragment in natural condition, I tried to use this phenomenon for the conservation of N. indica. <br><br>I analyzed the mechanism in detail. When a leaf was cut through veins perpendicularly and put on a sheet of wet paper, callus were formed around the veins always facing the proximal but not the distal side, and then buds and roots (i.e., plantlets) were regenerated there. This polarity was always observed in formation of plantlets.<br><br>It was reported that plant hormones (ex. auxins, cytokinins) are involved in plantlet regeneration of N. indica under aseptic culture condition. While the same results were obtained in my experiments, I have developed new method without using plant hormones and aseptic procedures to produce the plantlets. Thus, anybody can produce the plantlets just by cutting the leaf, and this method could be useful to conserve N.indica. One important factor is the size of leaflet, because nutrients required for plantlet development must be at a high enough level. This method may also apply in the conservation of aquatic plants.

HYBRID FITNESS AMONG MEMBERS OF WILD AND CULTIVATED RUBUS L. (BLACKBERRY AND RASPBERRY)
Jared Bryce Weaver
Southern Utah Center for Computer, Engineering, and Science Students, Cedar City, UT

Hybridization plays an important role in crop production and plant speciation. The purpose of our experiment was to investigate hybridization in members of Rubus. We hypothesized that when cultivars and wild relatives undergo hybridization, hybrids have greater fitness, i.e., increased germination and fruit and seed production. <br><br>Cultivars of blackberry and raspberry, as well as wild raspberry (R. ideaus), seed donors were cross-pollinated within each group and also hybridized with Himalayan blackberry pollen (R. discolor). Seed donor anthers were removed and artificial pollination techniques moved donor pollen to receptive stigmas. Manipulative controls moved neighbor plant pollen of the same species and unmanipulative controls pollinated naturally. Seeds were harvested from fruit and artificial pollination efficacy, fruit/seed production and biomass recorded. Individual pots containing seeds were placed in potting soil at 4ºC for 12 weeks and then moved to 24-hour lighting to complete germination; seed emergence was recorded daily. <br><br>ANCOVA and regression investigated observed differences among groups (SPSS). Significant differences in seed production and biomass occurred between wild species and cultivars, but increased hybrid fitness was observed only in wild raspberry. Wild species produced fewer seeds per fruit and wild raspberry produced the fewest seeds and least total seed biomass overall. No significant effect from artificial pollination was observed. Germination data remain to be calculated and those results may lend further support for our measures of fitness. Our results show Rubus cultivars have greater seed production and biomass than wild species and suggest cultivation in the genus has contributed to increased cultivar fitness.

DOES AZADIRACHTA INDICA AFFECT THE MOTILITY AND LIFE CYCLE OF MELOIDOGYNE INCONITA?
Swetha Krishna Doppalapudi
Morgantown High School, Morgantown, WV

Meloidogyne incognita (root-knot nematode) is a devastating crop pest and environmentally friendly controls for it are needed. Azadirachta indica (Neem) extracts repels various agricultural pests without adverse environmental impacts. Neem is nematicidal but its mode of action is unknown. I tested the hypotheses that Neem affects motility, host finding ability, and life cycle of root-knot nematodes. Pots with three treatments were established; control, soil layer, and drench. The soil layer and drench treatments both had a soil layer containing Neem above nematode inoculum. Controls had a soil layer without neem. Tomato seedlings were transplanted into steamed soil above a screen separating the upper and lower root systems. The drench treatment received weekly Neem drenches. After 6, 13, 21, and 34 days, roots were bleached and stained. The effect of neem on nematode movement was assessed by counting nematodes in upper and lower portions of the root systems. In the soil treatment more nematodes were found in the upper portion of the soil than the lower, however, the opposite occurred with the drench treatment. The number of mature females did not differ among Neem treatments. In an in vitro experiment nematodes were suspended in dilute neem oil. At higher Neem concentrations, nematodes moved more slowly than nematodes in distilled water. Nematodes remained alive for at least three days. I conclude that Neem reduces motility of nematodes, but is not directly toxic nor does it affect the development of nematodes, as it does in insects. Testing other modes of action is necessary.

THE CRANBERRY EFFECT, YEAR V: THE QUANTIFICATION OF TRANS-RESVERATROL IN VACCINIUM MACROCARPON VS. VITACEAE SPECIES FOR ECONOMICAL EXTRACTION BENEFITS
Erin Renae Brasser
South O'Brien Community School District, Paullina, IA

The purpose of this research was to verify and quantify the amount of trans-Resveratrol in Vaccinium macrocarpon (cranberries) and various Vitaceae (grape) species to determine if cranberries would be an economical extraction commodity for consumer health supplements. <br><br> The procedure used a gas chromatograph with a mass-spectrometer as the detector (GCMS). Cranberry and grape epicarp were processed using an 80:20 ethanol/water solvent with a high speed blender, heated at 60 degrees C for 30 minutes, then filtered. The samples were derivitized using a BSTFA 1%TMCS pyridine reagent, heated, nitrogen gas infiltrated, dehydrated, and concentrated in order to convert the trans-Resveratrol molecule (m.w. 228) into a trans-Resveratrol tri-methyl silyl molecule (m.w. 444.19). This process enabled precise readings of elution times and composition peaks on the GCMS.<br><br> After multiple GCMS samplings, trans-Resveratrol existence was verified using similar elution times of a pure standard compared with the cranberry extract at 20.34 minutes and similar composition readings of the derivitized molecule at 444.19 m/z. The Scarlotta grapes showed relatively high trans-Resveratrol peak areas of 293.84 square units, with cranberries eluting a peak of 16.04 square units. The results pertaining to the other grape species fell somewhere in-between.<br><br> Results show that cranberries contain relatively low amounts of trans-Resveratrol in comparison to various Vitaceae species. The hypothesis of higher trans-Resveratrol content in cranberries compared to Vitaceae species was rejected. However, mathematical analyses indicate that cranberries can compete with grapes for economical trans-Resveratrol extraction if wholesale prices of both fruits are low or if wholesale grape prices are high.

DEPENDENCE OF LEAF LITTER DECOMPOSITION ON SPECIES AND TEMPERATURE
Vincent Huang Lin
Falmouth High School, Falmouth, MA

Global temperature increases due to climate change may affect biomass decomposition, which is a major component of the carbon cycle. This research investigated how leaf decomposition differed among four tree species at different temperatures, which could potentially affect CO2 output.<br><br> Leaves of maple (Acer saccharum), white oak (Quercus alba), black oak (Quercus velutina) and American beech trees (Fagus grandifolia) were collected, dried, weighed, bagged, and placed indoors and outdoors to simulate different temperatures. Samples were removed, dried, and weighed five times over a 60-day period to determine loss of weight as a result of decomposition.<br><br> Maple decomposed the fastest, followed by white oak, black oak, and beech. In 60 days, the indoor sample of maple decomposed 17.15%, while the indoor sample of beech decomposed just 6.27%. Leaf samples decomposed faster at higher rather than lower temperatures, with maple being the most sensitive to temperature increase and black oak the least. Rate of maple leaf decomposition indoors at 18.3°C was 0.33% weight loss per day, which was 4.34 times the rate of maple leaf decomposition at the average outdoor temperature of -0.59°C. In comparison, black oak leaves had an indoor decomposition rate of 0.072% weight loss per day, 2.4 times the rate of outdoor black oak leaf decomposition.<br><br> A pattern of temperature-dependent decomposition was observed in all four species, suggesting that increased rates of biomass decomposition as a result of rising global temperatures may increase atmospheric CO2 concentrations, further contributing to climate change.

OPTIMIZING NOVEL PHRAGMIDIUM VIOLACEUM IN VITRO INOCULATIONS FOR ADVANCING RUBUS ARMENIACUS BIOLOGICAL CONTROL (YEAR III)
Ann Christine Bernert
West Linn High School, West Linn, OR

In western Oregon, Rubus armeniacus is the most widespread and economically influential invasive species. Current control methods are ineffective, laborious and environmentally insensitive. Phragmidium violaceum, a biotrophic rust fungi, is a promising control agent. However, due to its biotrophic nature, P. violaceum cannot be conventionally cultured. This research completed a novel method to produce and better research this economically, ecologically, and agriculturally important fungus by growing it on in vitro Rubus cultures. The long-term goal is the development of an effective and environmentally-friendly control program for R. armeniacus.<br><br>Teliospores are the overwintering life stage of rusts and little is known about imperative aspects of the teliospores of P. violaceum. This study completed the novel culturing method by optimizing in vitro inoculations protocol for the teliospores of P. violaceum. Successful inoculations were defined as a P. violaceum infected R. armeniacus culture without contamination. Different methods of teliospore preparation and in vitro inoculation were compared and developed. <br><br>This is the first instance of growing P. violaceum through teliospore inoculations. By maintaining biotrophic fungi with this innovative in vitro protocol, many research opportunities become possible. The optimization and completion of this original method directly advances the possibility of developing an effective and environmentally-friendly control for noxious R. armeniacus.

THE POTENTIAL ALLELOPATHIC SUPPRESSION OF KUDZU (PUERARIA MONTANA)
Mason Cole McFarland
Jefferson County International Baccalaureate School, Birmingham, AL

The sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) is a versatile plant and potential weed killer. The sweet potato has been known to produce chemicals that when exuded are toxic to other nearby plants. This process is called allelopathy. <br><br> Allelopathy is a promising field of study that deals with natural reactions between plants to aid in weed control. Kudzu (Pueraria montana) is an invasive weed and grows back after applications of synthetic herbicides. These herbicides harm the environment and cause the area to become unusable and barren except for the kudzu. By using the allelopathic chemicals present in sweet potatoes it may be possible to develop a natural herbicide. For example in this experiment sweet potato periderm tissue was applied to not only the kudzu plants but also to kudzu seeds to examine the suppressive effects of the allelochemicals. If the specific allelochemical could be found it might be used to suppress the growth of kudzu and provide an<br><br>eco-friendly alternative to harmful herbicides. <br><br> The allelochemicals are located throughout all of the sweet potato but are concentrated in the periderm tissue. By manipulating this tissue one may be able to prevent not only the growth of kudzu but also the germination of seeds. The project uses periderm tissue in the root weight, field, sweet potato skin, seedling root weight, germination, and air experiments. Testing this tissue could determine what organic compounds are in the skin. Each compound found, could be tested to determine which would have the greatest suppressive effect on kudzu.

IDENTIFYING THE FUNGAL ROOT ASSOCIATES OF PLATANTHERA ORBICULATA
Willaby Helen Shuster
Mount Edgecumbe High School, Sitka, AK

The relationships between the orchid Platanthera orbiculata and its fungal associates inhabiting the temperate rainforest biome of Southeastern Alaska are under studied. P. orbiculata has been ranked secure globally but imperiled within Alaska and placed on the USDA Region 10 Sensitive Plant List. The presence of mycorrhizal fungi may be a significant factor limiting the distribution of this forest orchid. Using molecular techniques to investigate the fungal-plant interactions may contribute to the understanding of habitat requirements and functional ecosystem roles and ultimately in the preservation of Platanthera orbiculata. I hypothesize that mycorrhizal fungi growing in the roots of P. orbiculata belong to the Tulasnella genus in the Phylum Basidomycetes. Samples were obtained from the Thorne Bay Ranger district on Prince of Wales Island. After DNA extraction, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification was done to isolate targeted DNA fragments. Results were visualized by gel electrophoresis and products were cloned and sequenced. Preliminary analysis identifies the fungal DNA as uncultured Leotiomycetes, a type of Ascomycete. As the samples were not surface sterilized, it is inconclusive whether DNA was extracted from inside the roots or their surface. Completion of this study involves cloning, sequencing, and a Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism assessment to profile and comparison of P. obtusata, P. dilatata, and P. stricta with P. orbiculata.

MOLECULAR TAXONOMY OF INDIGENOUS HAWAIIAN FERNS
Amelia Harvey
Kamehameha High School-Kapalama, Honolulu, HI

This project evaluates the level of genetic similarities between two fern samples from ferns in the genus Cibotium that are native to Hawaii. These samples are from C. nealiae and one sample that was identified as a potential hybrid between two of the species (C. menziesii x ?). Both of these samples were collected from Kauai (Alakai Swamp Trail). The different samples were compared using AFLP (Amplified Fragment-Length Polymorphism). DNA was first extracted and then selectively amplified using 33 different primer combinations selected based on previous research. Additionally, these samples were compared to samples from the other three species in the genus Cibotium that are native to Hawaii. These samples were collected on Oahu and analyzed in the previous year's research. For the purposes of comparison, ROX size standards were included with each analyzed sample. Additionally, each sample was run in duplicate. Thus far, the patterns of peaks produced show no differentiation between samples. This shows that these species are very similar genetically, which is corroborated by the lack of morphological differences between the studied species.

LOSS OF TURGOR PRESSURE: THROUGH PHOTOTROPISM OR PHOTOSYNTHESIS?
Sarah Victoria Warkander
Rutherford High School, Panama City, FL

Plants exposed to intense light lose leaf turgidity; leaves then hang more vertically. I tested whether this was negative phototropism or a byproduct of photosynthesis's water use. I grew soybeans and Wisconsin fast-growing plants and tested soybeans (higher germination rate) in three groups of seven plants. Each plant was individually bagged. Bags contained one of exhaled air (approximately 4% CO2), room air (0.03% CO2), or room air plus barium hydroxide lime to remove the CO2. Light intensity was increased stepwise, reaching 26600 lumens after 2.5 hours. On each plant three leaf-stem angles and the range of leaf-to-horizontal angles were measured hourly; the leaf-light angle was calculated. Each set of plants was exposed to each condition on different days. Measurements of leaf-stem angle for all plants after 0.5 hours of light averaged 41.2°, standard deviation (sd) 14.1°. After the 6.75 hour testing day, leaf-stem angles reached: for plants receiving added CO2, 53°, sd 11.4°; for those receiving room air, 41 °, sd 10.9°; and for those without CO2, no change (fluctuation ±5° throughout the day). The leaf-to-light angles averaged 96° after 0.5 hours. After 6.75 hours, angles in leaves receiving added CO2 and those in room air reached 132°; those without CO2 remained unchanged (±7°). This supported the alternative hypothesis: shutting down photosynthesis prevented loss of turgidity. The trend of the leaf-light angle over time was a curve; constancy in maples had indicated a possible phototropism. In these soybeans, loss of turgidity was caused by rapid photosynthesis due to intense light.

EFFECTS OF SGB LIQUIDS ON TRITICUM AESTIVUM
Kaysha Michaele Ousley
Mansfield High School, Mansfield, MO

Wheat is the main food grain grown in the United States, as rice is the common grain grown in other parts of the world. Previous research has looked at the beneficial effects of steviol glycosides blending liquid (SBL) on seeding growth and development in upland rice. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of SBL on the growth and germination of winter wheat.<br><br>To conduct the study, four groups of five Petri dishes with 20 seeds in each dish were counted out. In the control group, each dish had 10ml of spring water. In Group 2, each dish had 10ml of the 10mg/kg SBL solution. In Group 3, each dish had 10ml of the 100mg/kg SBL solution. In Group 4, each dish had 10ml of SBL 1000mg/kg solution. Initial dry weight was recorded. Then each day for 168 hours, imbibition and germination rate was recorded. After 168 hours, three seeds from each Petri dish were picked at random (each group then had 15 seeds). Next, the roots and shoots were cut off, weighed, measured, and then placed in an oven for 6 hours, taken out, left to dry for three days, and weighed again for the dry weights.<br><br>Using a student t-test, no statistically significant differences were found in comparisons of the experimental groups to the control group when analyzing imbibition. However, there was a significant difference (p=0.023264) when comparing the germinations of the control group and the 100mg/kg group.

GROWTH FORM IN INTERTIDAL LICHEN ZONATION
Luizetta Vadimovna Navrazhnykh
Florida Atlantic University High School, Boca Raton, FL

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of wave action on foliose and crustose lichens using the structural exposure index that compares the tenacity and the maximum force acting on an organism. It was hypothesized that the foliose lichens would have the higher structural exposure index, signifying that they are less suited for the wave swept environment. This prediction was based on the zonation of lichens in various intertidal habitats where foliose lichens did not appear in highly exposed areas. To calculate the structural exposure index, the drag coeficient and the lift coeficient where determined using measurements in a self constructed flow tank. This information was combined with the planform area, cross sectional areas and the tenacity of each lichen. As a result, the foliose and the crustose structural exposure indexes were shown to be significantly different (p=0.014) due to variation in tenacity (p=7.9e-5), not in thallus shape that would minimize drag or lift. Thus the hypothesis was supported. These data can be used to further examine the effects of wave forces on lichen zonation and to help explain the zonation patterns in Washington, Hog Kong and Anglesey. The application of the structural exposure index provides a tool in quantifying the effects of wave force as a potential limiting factor in the intertidal environment.

THE EFFECTS OF PH LEVEL ON SEED GERMINATION AND PLANT GROWTH
Tyler Madison Gaines
Beaufort Academy, Beaufort, SC

The purpose of this experiment is to determine how different pH levels affect seed germination, and then how different soil pH levels affect vegetable plant growth.<br><br>In this experiment, lima beans and crimson radishes are germinated in a water solution with a specific pH level of 11 through 1. Then, the germinated seeds are grown in a soil with a specific pH level of 5 through 9.<br><br>The data shows that the most germinated seeds are produced in a solution with a pH of 7 for both beans and radishes. The healthiest lima bean plants were produced in a soil with a pH of 7. Within the soil with a pH of 7, the highest dry weight was produced from seeds that were germinated in a solution with a pH of 5. The healthiest radish plants were produced in the soil with a pH of 8. Within the soil that has a pH of 8, the highest average dry weight was produced from radish seeds that were germinated in a solution with a pH of 9.<br><br>In conclusion, lima beans are best germinated in a water solution with a pH of 7 and grown in soil with a pH of 7. Crimson radishes are best germinated in a water solution with a pH of 7 and grown in a soil with a pH of 8. This information can benefit society because specific pH levels for germination and plant growth can prevent plant disease and optimize plant growth and vegetable production.

LEAF EXTRACTS OF EUPHORBIACEAE CAN ERADICATE THE FIELD CRAB, SOMANNIATHELPHUSA SEXPUCNTATA
Malinee Meeta
Phanomsarakam Phanomadunwitthaya, Chachoengsao, Chachoengsao, THAILAND

Field crabs ate and damaged rice plants resulting in lower yields. The Crabs are normally eradicated by using chemicals, the method which had high cost with negative impact on the environment and ecology. This study aimed at finding biological pesticide which can eliminate the field crabs without contaminating the environment with hazadous chemicals or causing ecological imbalance. Identifications of field crabs caught in the area of Phanomsarakham District, Chachoengsao province and zones overlapping with nearby districts, only Somanniathelphusa sexpunctata was found in Phanomsarakham.Its appearance was white claw clasp, different from other species. Local fruits which the crabs also feed on were tested for their ability to attract field crabs and ripen palmyra was most effective.To study the effect of the leaf extracts of Euphorbiaceae plants on eradication of field crabs, ripen palmyra pulp was mixed with each leaf extracts. and fed to caught field crabs. Experiments were carried out both in the laboratory and in the field. Among 5 types of Euphorbiaceae plants used, cassava leaf extract was found to give highest mortality of field crab. Therefore, cassava is potential for use as biological pesticide in the rice fields. Using the cassava leaf in eliminating the crabs from rice field , not only allow avoiding the use of chemicals , but also adds value to the cassava leaves which normally left rotting. This method will allow elimination of the crabs while allowing ecological balance.

THE SUSCEPTIBILITY DEGREES OF THE VARIETY OF COFFEA ARABICA SPECIE TO THE COFFEE BERRY BORER (HYPOTHENEMUS HAMPEI)
Genesis Maldonado
Colegio Congregacion Mita, San Juan, PUERTO RICO

The borer (Hypothenemus hampei) is the insect that has had the most negative effect in the production of coffee. The purpose of the study was to test the susceptibility of three varieties of Coffea arabica: Catuai, Caturra and Limani to the coffee berry beetle. The hypothesis was that there are differences in susceptibility degrees among different varieties of Coffea arabica to the coffee berry borer. To do this research 20 insect infected seeds from each of the 9 coffee plants of Coffea arabica species were collected. Each seed was dissected. The insects obtained from the seeds were counted. Then the seeds were analyzed according to three positions of the insects inside them. The positions were: the A position in which the borer is inside the seed but near the entrance at the bottom of it, the B position in which the insect is around the middle of the seed, and the C position in which the coffee berry borer has reached the other end of the seed. An analysis was done of variance (ANOVA) and a measurement test of Tukey at a 5% significance utilizing the Infostat program. There were no significant differences in the susceptibility degree for each of the varieties of Coffea arabica (p = 0.98). Furthermore, no significant difference was noted in the distribution of the positions of the coffee berry borer for the 3 varieties of Coffea Arabica. However, a difference was noted regarding the positioning of the borer in each seed evaluated (p = 0.001).

THE EFFECT OF ANTI-OXIDANTS ON PLANT DYNAMICS THROUGH FERTILIZER USE EFFICIENCY
Supritha Nilam
Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School, St. Catharines, Ontario, CANADA

Anti- oxidants are known to boost human health; plants are a major source of these antioxidants. For the last two years, I have been investigating the relationship between anti-oxidants and plants and have found that anti-oxidants can boost the general growth of plants across several species. I have been studying the effects of anti-oxidants in improving plant dynamics through fertilizer use efficiency, the study focused on tomatoes and cucumbers. Various proportions of antioxidants and fertilizers were evaluated to see the impact on plant growth and the environment. Samples of the leaves were tested for ascorbic acid (a standard assay used to indicate the presence of anti-oxidants) and tissue analysis (to indicate any changes in nutrient levels within the plant leaves). Leachate analysis, in both the tomatoes and cucumbers, was used to determine whether the health of the plant is sustained while the amount of fertilizer is reduced, as well as an indicator of leachate release. Protein analysis in SDS-PAGE was conducted in order to determine genotypic changes in the plants. Results show that with a full dosage of 20-8-20 fertilizer and 15% concentrated anti-oxidant mixture, the amount of leachate released into the environment was significantly decreased while the growth and crop size of the plants increased. This means that less leachate will release into the environment, decreasing environmentally detrimental situations such as algae blooms which are induced by fertilizers leachate. There is also a commercial benefit to using the fertilizer and the anti-oxidant together. It is cost efficient for the greenhouse industry to purchase the anti-oxidants in addition to the fertilizer because of the large yield produced, increasing the potential of the greenhouse industry.

ALGAE GROWTH, YEAR TWO
Mallory Anne Eitel
La Plata R-II High School, La Plata, MO

BACKGROUND: Algae, non-vascular plants that grow in all ponds, are essential to a healthy pond and may be a viable alternative fuel source. Researchers have discovered that oil from Chlorella algae can be turned into a biofuel. Algae is the fastest growing plant in the world. An acre of Chlorella can produce 10,000 gallons of fuel/year compared to 50 gallons from an acre of soy beans. In 2009 tests, the addition of Miracle Gro 15-30-15 (nitrogen-phosphate-potash) resulted in lower algae growth rates than control.<br><br>PURPOSE: 1) To determine if Miracle Gro 24-8-16 plant food will increase Chlorella's population. 2) To determine if Spirogyra will grow as well under the same conditions. <br><br>METHODS: Fill six jars with 300.0 ml of wastewater effluent and 10.0 ml of Chlorella; put two half peas in Jars 1-5. Mix ¼ teaspoon of Miracle Gro 24-8-16 granular plant food into one gallon water. Add fertilizer (0.5 ml, 1.0 ml, 1.5 ml, and 2.0 ml) to Jars 1-4. Use Jar 5 & 6 as baseline and post-control. Measure suspended solids in Jar 6 for baseline algae population. Take dissolved oxygen readings (DO) 2-3x/week. Conclude experiment after two weeks. Measure suspended solids in Jars 1-5. Repeat procedure for Spirogyra. Analyze data using t-test.<br><br>DATA: The Chlorella growth rates ranged from 10.71 times (control) to 38.14 times (1.0 ml). The 0.5 ml, 1.0 ml, and 2.0 ml Chlorella growth rates were significantly different than the control (p<.05). Spirogyra growth rates ranged from 3.0 times (0.5 ml) to 4.03 times (2.0 ml). No Spirogyra sample was significantly different than the control rate (3.36 times).<br><br>CONCLUSION: Using a plant food with a higher level of nitrogen and lower level of phosphate resulted in better Chlorella growth rates but did not have the same effect on Spirogyra growth rates.

THE PESTICIDAL EFFECTS OF THE ANTIOXIDANT LUTEIN ON AGRICULTURE
Alyson Denae Hubrig
Hankinson High School, Hankinson, ND

PURPOSE: To investigate the pesticidal properties of the antioxidant Lutein on the growth of corn. Secondly, to analyze the flower extracts of Tagetes for other agricultural benefits. <br><br>PROCEDURES: Collect three marigold antioxidant products (Crackerjack Marigold flower, Petite Marigold flower, and Lutein), and two commercial pesticides. Prepare marigold solutions. (10:1) Prepare pesticides at a field application rate. <br><br>TEST PLOT STUDY: Measured and prepared a 50x20 foot corn test plot area and after a 4 week growing period applied 2000 mls of solution onto the corn crop. After a 3 month growing period, the corn was harvested by hand. The corn was then analyzed for plant height, seed count, cob length and circumference, moisture, starch, protein, oil, test weight, bushels/acre. <br><br>INSECT STUDY: Drop Method: Used actual contact of the solutions on corn earworms, European corn borers, western & southern corn rootworms to determine their fatality rate. <br><br>PATHOGEN STUDY: Kirby Bauer: Tested 3 natural solutions and one pesticide for their inhibiting properties on a corn pathogen. <br><br>SOIL TESTING: To observe the effects of the products on the nutrient level of soil. <br><br>CONCLUSION: From the Test Plot Study, I found that Crackerjack and Lutein were the most beneficial to the corn. In the Insect Study, Asana XL and Petite had the fastest killing times on the insects. In the Pathogen Study, I found that Crackerjack and Lutein created the largest inhibition zone. In the Environmental Study, I found that Lutein increased the nutrient level of the soil the most. The overall best solution was the Crackerjack flower extract. Overall, I feel that Lutein shows the potential to be a natural pesticide in the agricultural industry.

DIVERSITY OF FOLIAR FUNGAL ENDOPHYTES IN WILD AND CULTURED METROSIDEROS POLYMORPHA INFERRED FROM ENVIRONMENTAL PCR AND ITS SEQUENCE DATA
Mali'o Wanda Kodis
Waiakea High School, Hilo, HI

All plant species sampled to date have been shown to harbor diverse communities of endophytic fungi, yet there have been no molecular studies on native Hawaiian flora. With application toward conservation, the diversity of fungal endophytic communities within Metrosideros polymorpha (ohi‘a lehua) leaves were compared between elevational variables and wild versus cultivated environments. Communities were analyzed using environmental PCR and ITS sequence data. Sequences were compared using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST), and phylogenies were constructed using maximum likelihood and pairwise distance analyses. From this data, it can be inferred that fungal endophytic communities within M. polymorpha are dependant upon elevational phenotype of their host, and independent of locality (wild versus cultivated). This study elucidates the factors that shape the endophytic communities of this species, and infers that an evolutionary correlation exists between fungal endophytes and their host.

SOIL ABSORPTION VS. PLANT GROWTH
Jami Renee Delgadillo
Americas High School, El Paso, TX

The problem I was trying to solve was to determine how soil absorption affects plant growth. My hypothesis was that if a certain soil absorbs more it does not necessarily mean it will yield the best growth for a plant being that it is more susceptible to absorb pollutants. I also wanted to find out how the density and pH affected soil absorption as well. First I collected three various polypedons, or soils, then measured and recorded their densities, rate of absorbency, capacity of absorbency, and pH levels. I also prepared and acidic and basic group of each soil, and took the same measurements as previously stated. Next I planted and grew both peas and beans for twenty days and recorded their growth daily; the two plants were chosen as a precaution to verify that it wasn’t just a certain plant’s soil preference that was producing the growth. After twenty days of observation I found that the clay from the earth proved to be the most effective soil producing the best and only growth in the acidic group for both plants. The clay was able to separate the pollutants from the water, this was observed buy a build of the acidic solution around the clay, this observation supported my hypothesis. There was absolutely no growth in the basic group being that a base acts as a hydrogen acceptor, and forms hydrogen bonds with water which therefore makes water “wetter,” and had the effect of over watering the plants.

ASPEN IN A STATE OF SADNESS: A STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE DECLINE OF POPULUS TREMULOIDES, PHASE II
Nikki Taylor Buhrdorf
Hotchkiss High School, Hotchkiss, CO

The purpose of this project was to determine the effect of Sudden Aspen Decline (SAD) on the South flank of Grand Mesa. This study was conducted to determine the extent of SAD by studying the severity of secondary invaders and extent of regeneration with respect to elevation. Twenty Aspen stands, in twenty different locations, were studied. The areas were randomly selected for intensity of secondary invaders namely the Poplar Borer (Saperda calcarta) and Cytospora canker (Cytospora chrysosperma) and Aspen regeneration in these areas.<br><br> One year’s data indicates that SAD is no longer confined to the lowest elevation of Aspen stands, as found by other researchers. The results indicate Poplar Borer and Cytospora canker are now prevalent in the mid-range elevations of Aspen stands. Aspen regrowth is also declining in these mid-ranges, as well as in the lower ranges.<br><br> As indicated by intensity of Poplar Borer and Cytospora canker and lack of Aspen regeneration, it appears that SAD is increasing in areas to include the mid-elevations of Aspen ranges. SAD is quite possibly moving into the higher ranges.

Last year we determined that a faster flow rate yields better growth in tomato plants when using hydroponics. This year we wanted to determine the cost efficiency of using fertilizer versus using unfertilized Mississippi River water and unfiltered faucet water. We believed that the Mississippi River water should have produced similar results to using fertilized water because Mississippi River water contains vast quantities of fertilizer from run-off waters in the mid-section of the United States, since this part of the country contains most of our farmlands. Heights and masses of plants were used to compare the amount of growth. The acidity of the different types of water was also recorded for future reference. Data is still being analyzed to cross check validity.

THE EFFECTS OF SODIUM BENZOATE ON BRASSICA RAPA’S GROWTH RATE, MATURITY RATE, AND FECUNDITY
Claudia Nicole Dennler, Samantha Rose Dennler, 
Pershing County High School, Lovelock, NV

We wondered how people were affected by the use of the preservative sodium benzoate found in many consumable products from soda to mouthwash. Since we couldn’t test humans, we decided to see how it would affect plants. Using Fast Plants Standard Seed Brassica Rapa, we set up growth chambers and reservoir systems for a controlled environment. Three trials were observed using different concentrations of sodium benzoate dissolved in water: #1) from 0 to 30%, #2) serial dilution from .1% to .00001%, and #3) only .0001%. The third trial confirmed results from trial 2 of unusual phenotypic expression in the .0001% container. The majority of the germinated plants exhibited the same phenotypic expression of growth, maturity, and fecundity. A null hypothesis student “t” test conducted confirmed that the differences measured are significant. Based on further research, we believe that the cause is probably linked to ethylene inhibition. The sodium benzoate has to build up in concentration in order for this to occur. At the .0001%, we think that it travels across the osmotic barrier undetected, and between days 12-14, like a virus, suddenly has an impact, thus the extreme phenotypic expression. It would be interesting to confirm this through further investigation. Extending this research to agriculture is also of high interest. To increase crop yields while decreasing production time is a necessity for regions with shorter growing seasons. This can also be applied to the production of bio-fuel resources. Trial 1 also caused worries relating to toxicity, as salt gardens grew.

PHYTOCHEMISTRY AND ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY OF GUNNERA TINCTORIA STEM
Sharon Priscila Castro Perez, Diego Ignacio Baeza Perez, 
Instituto Cristiano Gracia y Paz, Valdivia, De los Rios, CHILE

Gunnera tinctoria (nalca) grows in the center and southern areas of Chile; its stem is used as food, while the external part is removed and eliminated. This plant is used as antidiarrheal medication in Mapuche medicine. Diverse authors point out the chemical composition of the stem, yet there is no information regarding the composition of its separate parts. The research was focused on the principal secondary metabolites of both parts as well as determining antioxidant activity of the fractions obtained from a methanolic extract.<br><br>The presence of secondary metabolites was determined by general phytochemical reactions and thin layer chromatography. The antioxidant activity was determined measuring the DPPH quenching activity of the fractions.<br><br>The results demonstrate the presence of carbohydrates, tannins, and steroids in both parts of the stem, and flavonoids and anthraquinones while flavonoids and anthraquinones are only found in the non-edible part. All fragments obtained from the stem of the plant demonstrated antioxidant activity in the different concentrations evaluated, making emphasis on the dichloromethane fragment obtained from the external part of the stem.<br><br>The presence of tannins in the stem justifies the use of this plant as antidiarrheal medication in Mapuche medicine. The presence of active principles in the external part of the plant leads us to search for its proper use. The fractions with greater antioxidant capacity could be used for the treatment of diverse pathologies in which free-radicals are involved.

FINDING A TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR IN EUCALYPTUS GRANDIS THAT REGULATES WOOD FORMATION
Jason Ye, Rebekah Bau, 
Cedar Shoals High School, Athens, GA

Eucalyptus trees are the world’s most-planted hardwood because of their valuable traits. Primarily used in papermaking, its domestication process has progressed slowly due to its slow maturation rate. An alternative to this is genetic engineering, given that we understand the functions of its genes. <br><br>This project’s aim was to find regulatory genes, such as transcription factors, that regulate wood formation in Eucalyptus trees. Wood is primarily composed of secondary cell wall, and the ability for plants to make this began occurring millions of years ago. We hypothesized that the regulatory genes responsible for secondary cell wall synthesis in both Eucalyptus and Arabidopsis had been conserved and remain similar over the evolutionary period. <br><br>The transcription factor regulating secondary cell wall synthesis in Arabidopsis plants was already known. We compared this DNA sequence to the Eucalyptus genome to find a similar DNA sequence, EgNAC1, which we engineered into an expression vector. We then found that the proteins made from EgNAC1 activated the secondary cell wall synthesis gene promoters, using the GUS reporter gene in Arabidopsis protoplasts. From this, we conclude that EgNAC1 is a transcription factor that likely regulates secondary cell wall biosynthesis in Eucalyptus trees.<br><br>Finding this gene has important implications in tree biotechnology. It could be used to increase wood production, creating a higher yield of wood per plant. This increased biomass could provide more material for papermaking and bio-fuel production without increasing the land and resources used in cultivation.

Bodindecha (Sing Singhaseni) School, Wangthonglang, Bangkok, THAILAND

This study examined the effect of external/internal characteristics and physical structures of the Tabebuia rosea seeds on their vertical and horizontal movement. It was found that features resembling two wings attached to seeds on opposite sides were very light, white, translucent tissue. Although average seed mass was 0.032 grams, these wings were sufficiently strong to retain their winged shape while enduring air resistance. Microscopic study revealed pores within the wing cells, creating a light mass. The cells were connected lengthwise along the wings’ length, preventing them from breaking or crumbling while falling thereby allowing seeds to travel further and longer. In addition, starch and fat were not found along the cell wall which may result in long period of seed storage without deterioration.Comparative study under vacuum and normal atmospheric conditions revealed that seeds did not whirl and drop vertically in the vacuum whilst they whirled and dispersed away from a vertical axis under normal atmospheric conditions with their Micro Pyle sides always turning downward.The highest spinning rate, resulting in the furthest distance travelled, was 19 Hz measured by stroboscope. On studying the effect of wing and blade angle, it was observed that the seeds took longest time to fall at wing angles of 132 – 136 degrees. The blade angle of 40-degree produced the highest spinning rate, resulting in the longest distance traveled. The special characteristics of the Tabebuia rosea seeds observed could be applied in the development of air-resistant material and designs that could prolong falling rates of an object.

MODIFICATION OF BREEDING RICE GRAINS THROUGH ARTIFICIAL COLORS, FLAVOR AND SMELL USED IN PREVENTION OF GRAIN-CONSUMING BIRDS
Saifon Nopnipa, Aphitchaya Nopphalert, 
Phanomsarakham "Phanomadunwitthaya" School, Phanomsarakham, Chachoengsao, THAILAND

Thai farmers have had difficulty in plantation and production of rice as a result of lower quantity per acre, lower price of products with higher costs of breeding rice grains, hazardous pesticide and, especially, the breeding grains eaten or destroyed by a large number of birds including pigeons and tree sparrows, subsequently causing a much lower amount or rice production. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine whether the modified grains would prevent the birds from destroying the breeding rice grains. There were three major findings. First, the birds tended to least eat rice grains coated by orange- red, bitter taste, kaffir lime smell. Second, the ratio of sprouting rice gains coated by colors was equivalent to that of the rice grains unmodified. Also, the grains coated by bitter flavor resulted in the same ratio of sprouting rice gains unmodified. However, the grains coated by any smell resulted in the same ratio of sprouting rice gains unmodified. Third, in actual rice plantation during the first week, the rice grains coated by kaffir lime smell were hardly eaten, indicating that this type of modified grains could be used to prevent birds from eating/destroying the breeding grains. During the second week, the birds hardly consumed the grains coated by bitter flavor. The findings suggest that the modification of rice grains coated by artificial colors, flavor and smell can be of use to Thai farmers to prevent their breeding rice grains from those birds.

STEAM STERILIZATION TO REPLACE FIELD BURNING
Bradly Jarred Hamburger, Joel Hamburger, 
Tillamook High School, Tillamook, OR

The Oregon Legislature this year signed legislation banning field burning. Field burning is a critical tool used by grass seed framers in the Willamette Valley to sterilize their fields of invasive spices and plant disease. Since the ban on field burning took effect, grass seed farmers have been trying to come up with ways that effectively sterilize their fields before planting. One of these ideas is steam sterilization. Our project?s objective is to see if steam sterilization is an effective option to replace field burning. First we steamed packets of 50 seeds for five minutes in auto clave and pressure cooker. Then we planted seeds in plastic containers and waited for germination. After seeds germinated we counted seeds and germinated seeds and determined germination rates. Then we made seed packets out of metal screening and steamed on the steam relief valve of a high pressure boiler at a local lumber mill. After completing theses steps we have proved that steam sterilization will not work to replace field burning.

Environmental pollution and waste of energy have become a major problem. Efficiency will be gained by greenhouses, by protection from diseases, minimization of manpower, economization by ensuring energy efficiency depending on the sensitivity of the plants. SERA-2020 offers fundamental, lasting solutions about that.<br><br>SERA-2020 will control temperature and humidity, which are active parameters of a growing plant in greenhouses, in desired value without the need for greenhouse; at the same time, it’ll detect and ensure the requirements of species like red spider which leads to a danger by means of observing the color changes of the leaves. The most notable point in SERA-2020 is that of providing the minimal margin of error of the robotic arm programmed with PIC which is described as Microprocessor that is integrated with automated system in the creation of color detection process. <br><br>Plant seeds, produced by GMO, have been widely used all around the world. Such conditions are provided, plant will grow faster, more efficient and durable. In our system, total increase of efficiency without need for seeds with GMO, has been aimed in our studies.<br><br>We acquired energy save by a tracking systemed solar panels which are set up by producing electricity from sunlight, providing the electronic system work during the whole night.<br><br>As a result, by providing all the requirements the plants need to grow automatically without manpower, SERA- 2020 makes the plant grow in less time, by spending less energy but being effective and healthy without the need for GMO, pesticides, hormones.

POO TO NEW

In the world of agriculture, everyday counts and everyday is unpredictable. When people think agriculture, they think farmers and animals. Agriculture is so much more than that. Everything is agriculture, or has something in some form or way that is. The world of agriculture advances everyday, continuing to find ways to make our world better, or to find ways to help produce things in new ways. With our project, we have set an example of this. Farmers these past few years have had a hard time with the crop production because of the unpredictable weather. This is not a good thing for them, and is also not a good thing for Americans. Without enough crops, the prices of food will increase, as you can already begin to see. Another factor in the decrease of crop production is the continuation of construction and cities expanding. With everything being built, there is less ground for crops to grow on. Is there a way that can help our problem? What would we do if there were not enough grounds left to produce enough crops? What would we do if the weather continues to become more and more unpredictable? We decided to follow through with this project hoping to find an answer for theses questions. As everyone should know plants need certain nutrients to grow. In fertilizers there are three main factors: K (Potassium), P (Phosphorus), and N (Nitrogen). We decided to fertilize our plants with the main element Nitrogen. “Fish Poo”, if you didn’t already know, has a lot of nitrogen in it. We placed our plants in pea gravel on a gutter, and let water that contained “Fish Poo” filter through giving the plants the nitrogen. We compared this growing method with a more traditional method to see if the plants would grow just as well or even better.

IMPROVING ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS TOLERANCE: THE GENETIC ENGINEERING OF THE ORYZA SATIVA PLANT CARRYING THE ESCHERICHIA COLI GENES PRODUCING TREHALOSE (YEAR TWO)
Andrew Michael Joseph
Episcopal High School of Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL

Rice is a globally important cereal crop, accounting for significant caloric intake of more than three billion humans. With the increase in the world population, the demand for rice will grow substantially. There are already many challenges to achieving higher rice production and quality, one of which is global warming. Trehalose is a disaccharide present in Escherichia coli (E. coli), which increases markedly in response to heat shock and osmotic stress. In such environments, E. coli produces this sugar to help stabilize dehydrated enzymes, proteins, and lipid membranes efficiently. Therefore, the objective of this research is to increase the abiotic stress tolerance of rice by genetically engineering the E. coli trehalose biosynthetic genes (otsA and otsB) into rice. <br><br>The otsA and otsB genes were amplified from E. coli using PCR and cloned into the vector pSC. These genes were then sub-cloned into the binary vector pCmHU for rice transformation. This vector is compatible with E. coli, Agrobacterium, and Oryza Sativa (rice). Agrobacterium-mediated rice transformation was conducted using the resulting constructs. <br><br>Some of the transformed calli are growing well on the selective media containing antibiotics, strongly suggesting that they carry otsA or otsB since the antibiotic resistant gene is linked to the trehalose producing genes. <br><br>The transgenic and non-transgenic rice plants will be compared in their ability to produce trehalose and increase plant growth and rice production under various environmental stresses such as photo-oxidative damage in drought, and high and low temperatures.

EFFICACY OF CHLORINE ON SALMONELLA TYPHIMURIUM LT2 IN IRRIGATION WATER ON PRODUCE ITEMS
Kelly Nicole Howard
The Villages Charter High School, The Villages, FL

The goal was to determine the dilutions of chlorine that eliminate Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 agree with dilutions of chlorine that won’t burn the plants. Obtain PPE. TEST 1: Transfer tomatoes/lettuce into containers. Keep plants in sheltered location. Water with small quantities at regular intervals. Groups: 3 tomatoes and 1 lettuce tray. Group 2: 500 µL chlorine, group 3: 3000 µL, group 4: 4000 µL, group 5: 5000 µL of chlorine, & group 1: constant. Repeat once a week until results are evident. TEST 2: Label TSA & XLD agar plates (2/ agar/dilution/ time period/ppm of chlorine). Set up 5-1 L beakers with labels (0ppm, 10ppm, 50ppm, 100pm, 200ppm). Add 1 L collected/filtered lake water to beakers. Add prepared inoculum of Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 to beakers. Add correct dilution of chlorine to first container. 0ppm-0mL, 10ppm-0.334mL, 50ppm-1.834mL, 100ppm-2.667mL, 200ppm-3.5mL. Pipette 1mL out of beaker and into dilution tube. Pipette 1mL from tube into next tube. Continue until desired dilution is acquired. Plate dilutions (100 μL inoculum) on XLD & TSA plates, 2/dilution. Spread inoculum around plate, let dry. Repeat plating of inoculum at 10min, 30min, 1hr, 2hrs, & 4hrs. incubate plates for 24 hrs, 32°C. If irrigation water is treated for 30 minutes with a 50 ppm solution of chlorine, and chlorine can eliminate the Salmonella, the rest of foodborne pathogens found in water can be eliminated. The data helps indicate whether regulations made by FDA towards farmers are reasonable for farmers to carry out and productive at eliminating bacteria. The 50 ppm solution did not prove to show any sorts of burning on either the tomato or lettuce plants. This data can be extrapolated to eggplants, romaine, head lettuce, peppers, and other produce with similar characteristics.

RUBUS ENDOPHYTES: APPLICATION AND IMPLICATION FOR BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
Ann C. Bernert
West Linn High School, West Linn, OR

Rubus armeniacus is an invasive and noxious weed and current control methods are laborious and inefficient. Biological control can be more environmentally-friendly and effective. Phragmidium violaceum is an agent used in multiple countries with success. <br><br>The purpose of this research was to address the two major roadblocks preventing biological control of R. armeniacus. These roadblocks, inconsistent infections in the target weed and risk to commercial breeds, may be overcome by the exploration and application of Rubus endophytes. Endophytes are microorganisms colonizing in plants and can have significant influences on their host.<br><br>Foliar endophytes were isolated from R. armeniacus samples and maintained on Potato Dextrose Agar. Cultures appearing to inhibit the growth of other endophytes during the stages of isolation were marked and used in an antagonism test. This test shows if endophytes colonizing in R. armeniacus influence their host and surroundings by preventing the growth of other fungi. The Antagonism Index was determined by measuring radial growth towards and away from the antagonist. <br><br>Results showed that fungal growth inhibited by the antagonist was significant (p-value<.05). The null hypothesis of endophytes having no influence can be rejected and the hypothesis that they have potential to hold significant influence can be accepted. This suggests that endophytes have potential to address the roadblocks preventing biological control; both by explaining inconsistent infection rates and also by protecting commercial breeds.<br><br>To date, no other research has been conducted on the R. armeniacus endophytes.

EVALUATION OF UBIQUITIN PROMOTER EXPRESSION ABILITIES FOR POTENTIAL USE IN TRANSGENIC GRAPE VINE (VITIS VINIFERA)
Stephen Taylor Bethel
Lake Brantley High School, Altamonte Springs, FL

The use of viral promoters in transgenic produce has caused unfounded fear and objection in society. Some have tried to solve this problem by substituting such promoters with plant promoters, however, plant promoters are known for their weak expression abilities. Currently, there is no effective promoter native to the grape plant that can be used in transgenic procedures. My research evaluates the promoter that regulates for ubiquitin production for potential use in transgenic procedures targeting grape vine. Ubiquitin is a protein found “ubiquitously” throughout all cells. Therefore, logic infers that the promoter which codes for the production of ubiquitin should be efficient.<br><br> <br><br>To test the ubiquitin promoter’s expression strength, two analyses were performed. These were the anthocyanin color histogram analysis and the beta-glucuronidase assay. The transformation vectors containing all the promoters tested were incorporated into the grape embryos through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Through quantifying the amount of reporter gene product present, the efficiency for each promoter was correlated. The industry standard and positive control viral promoter expectedly performed the best in all analyses used. However, a particular plant promoter, Ubiquitin-5 1 kilo base pair (Ubi-5), had no significant statistical difference in expression ability when compared to the positive control (p = 0.0866, 0.0948, 0.18). If Ubi-5 continues to demonstrate this trend of superb expression abilities, it could be nominated as a potential alternative to viral promoters in transgenic grape vine. This would allow efficient, consumer friendly, native DNA, cisgenic grapes to be mass produced for public distribution.

IDENTIFICATION OF THE SOURCE OF INDETERMINATE DNA IN FLUORESCENCE ASSAYS OF STERILE SEED CORN (ZEA MAYS)
Kaitlin Elizabeth Larkin
Wentzville Holt High School, Wentzville, MO

To reduce cost and time detasseling corn, breeders have taken advantage of naturally-occurring mutations that block viable pollen production. Companies test bags of corn to ensure proper percentages. PCR reactions are used in conjunction with fluorescent probes which attach to genes that cause the pollen mutation. A computer program graphs the results of fluorescence. The program has picked up a cloud of results that is indeterminable. The probe is thus attaching to indeterminate DNA which is tainting results. In this experiment the DNA is identified by isolation, amplification, and sequencing. The probe will be changed accordingly so that results are pure.

RESEARCH OF TRILOBANA WEDELIA EFFECTS IN PREVENTION AND CURE OF CUSCUTA JAPONICA
Anan Qiu
Shenzhen Senior High School, Shenzhen, Guangdong, CHINA

In recent years, exogenous invading herbs constitute threats and destruction on the botanical diversity of the region, and research on the allelopathy between plants is becoming active. It is found through experiment that, Trilobana Wedelia has weak alleolopahty on woody plants such as Duranta Repens Linn, and etc, but has strong alleolopathy on herbs such as Cuscuta Japonica, and etc. Making use of the characteristics, this experiment, utilizing the extracting fluid of Trilobana Wedelia and by way of root pouring, tries to cause alleolopathy on Cuscuta Japonica parasiting on Duranta Repens Linn. <br><br> The results show that: <br><br> i. Allelopathic effect on herbaceous plants by extract fluid from different part of Trilobana wedelia assumes a basic law of leaf > whole plant > stem > root. <br><br> ii. The 8% Trilobana wedelia extracting fluid witnesses better preventive and curing effect on Cuscuta Japonica. <br><br> iii. Both the root absorptivity and external transpiration of Duranta Repens Linn can impact on the Trilobana Wedelia's preventive and curing effect on Cuscuta Japonica; <br><br> iv. The alleolopathic substances in Trilobana wedelia destroys oxidizing equilibrium in vivo Cuscuta Japonica, resulting in death of Cuscuta Japonica; <br><br> v. The 8% concentration extract fluid of Trilobana wedelia witnesses better field insemination in combating Cuscuta Japonica.

TROUBLED TOMATOES: HOW DOES ACETAMINOPHEN AND AN ACETAMINOPHEN+H2O2 MIXTURE AFFECT THE GROWTH AND INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF TOMATOES?
Haley Rose Matteson
William J. Palmer High School, Colorado Springs, CO

One of the results of last year's project was the severe stunting of tomato plants (10cm tall) watered with an Acetaminophen+H2O2 solution. This year's project was to attempt to reproduce and identify the causes of the stunting. <br><br>Constants were: Tomato Type, soil, temperature and light. <br><br>Independent Variables were: Acetaminophen, Chlorine, and H2O2 mixtures. <br><br>Dependent Variables were: plant height and internal structure. <br><br>I hypothesized that: <br><br>1. Tomato Plants watered with the same Acetaminophen+H2O2 solution will produce stunted growth.<br><br>2. That visible damage should be evident in the cross-sections of the stems and roots. <br><br>3. When watering with the Acetaminophen+H2O2 solution is replaced with distilled water, the plants will recover and start growing again. <br><br>The stunted growth was reproduced. My slides seem to indicate that the results of the long-term exposure to Hydroquinone, an intermediate oxidation byproduct of Acetaminophen in the presence of H2O2, are a poorly developed xylem, restricted circulation and stunted growth. When the Acetaminophen+H2O2 watering solution was stopped, the plants repaired their internal structure (the xylem returned to its normal position within the vascular bundle) over a period of months and growth resumed.

AN ECOLOGICAL COMPARISON OF COLLUVIAL AND ALLUVIAL FORESTS IN THE GOLD CREEK WATERSHED
Corwin Daniel Kelly
Thunder Mountain High School, Juneau, AK

This project investigated differences in primary succession between alluvial and colluvial forests in the Gold Creek watershed in southeastern Alaska. I hypothesized no difference in species composition or size of trees. Using ArcGIS, I randomly selected two polygons on the colluvial site and three on the alluvial site. The colluvial site was deforested by a 1901 landslide and the alluvial site by hydraulic mining at about the same time. Each colluvial polygon contained six plots while one alluvial polygon contained six, and the other two three plots; plots were 10x10 m2 and 10 m apart. For each plot, I determined slope, counted trees by species, measured the height and diameter of all trees, and cored the largest conifer. I entered data into Stand Visualization System (SVS) software to produce a visual image, conducted one-way ANOVAs, and counted growth rings on tree cores. ANOVA showed no significant effect of site on number of trees by species or on conifer age. The only significant effects were on height of Sitka spruce, Picea sitchensis, and Sitka alder, Alnus crispa. Thus, I accepted my null hypothesis. Visual examination of SVS plots suggested investigating within-site variability. ANOVA showed significantly more spruce in steeper plots (averaging 27% slope) and fewer, taller spruce and taller alder in more gradual plots (averaging 15% slope). Within alluvial plots, ANOVA showed significantly more alder in upstream than downstream plots. I suggest that floods affected only upstream plots, killed any spruce trying to grow there, and created ideal conditions for alder.

THE EFFECT OF INTRASPECIFIC COOPERATION IN SIBLING PLANTS DESCENDED FROM THE SAME PARENTAL TYPE ON THE AMOUNT OF BIOMASS PRODUCED
Kelsi Samantha Faley
Heritage High School, Leesburg, VA

Evolutionary botanists are finding new evidence about cooperation between plants of the same species having the same resource needs in a niche. The results of this experiment demonstrate that plants of the same species, which descend from the same parent, produce 50% more biomass than non-familial plants when grown within a 2 cm radius. The approach to this experiment was to determine if sibling plants from the same F1 parent planted together would have greater biomass produced than non-sibling plants from different F1 parents. Wisconsin Fast Plants (Brassica rapa) F1 Standard (S) and Non-Purple, Hairless (NPH) were planted and grown separately. F1 seeds were collected and grown for each of three separate F2 groups: (IV) Group A: 2 S seeds and Group B: 2 NPH seeds, and Group C, combinations of 2 seeds from A and B. Biomass measurements (DV) using height, fresh root and top mass, and leaf surface area for F2 (A:C and B:C) statistically refuted the null hypothesis that planting seeds of similar and dissimilar F1 types would result in the same F2 biomass. The results support current research, challenging fundamental concepts of a niche and the mechanisms comparing plant growth through competition and cooperation. These results are relevant because they show that competition and cooperation can be measured in the genus Brassica, a group of plants valuable to humans and animals as a source of food and economic value as biodiesel. This knowledge could have an enormous impact on the efficiency of agricultural production.

THE USE OF SODIUM POLYACRYLATE TO INCREASE CROP PRODUCTION IN DRY-LAND FARMING
Kira Elizabeth Powell
Odessa High School, Odessa, WA

Sodium polyacrylate (C3H3NaO2), originally developed by the Dow Chemical Company, is a polymer that is a mix of sodium acrylate and acrylic acid. Commonly found in baby diapers, it can absorb 500 times its mass in water. This polymer has potential as a soil additive. The hypothesis was if sodium polyacrylate was applied to farmable soil then the yield in the experimental sections will be higher than the control section. This should be reflected by an increase in wheat crop growth and water retention. Three plots were planted for the full scale test, the Control Plot, the Experimental Plot 1 with a 2.5 % sodium polyacrylate mixture and the Experimental Plot 2 with a 5.0 % sodium polyacrylate mixture. Multiple data collections took place throughout the test including plant height, plant count, water present and yield. The Control Plot resulted in 26.8 bushels per acre, the Experimental Plot 1 with 32.8 bushels per acre and the Experimental Plot 2 with 34.1 bushels per acre. The hypothesis was accepted because both Experimental Plots had a statistically higher average plant height and yield then the Control Plot.

EVERLASTING FLOWERS
Zeina Yousef Qaisieh
Modern Systems Schools, Amman, Middle East, JORDAN

Flowers are one of God’s best gifts to mankind, which fill our lives with deep joy and color. Flowers are the nature’s messengers of emotions, happiness and beauty, but they are very vulnerable, they wither easily and die out quickly, more quickly than we want, this has made me think of a way to keep flowers fresh for a long time, double the time they usually take. After a long time of thinking, the procedure that was followed involved adding a special organic herbal mix to the flowers directly or spraying the flowers by it. The special mix of the herbs could extend the duration of the flowers’ vase lives with a very low cost.

THE USE OF ALGAE IN REDUCING THE IMPACT OF EUTROPHICATION IN WASTE WATER, IN ADDITION TO PRODUCING SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS OF ALGAE FOR THE USE OF BIOFUEL PRODUCTIONS
Kaylee Shandale Glenn
Weber High School, Pleasant View, UT

Due to the excessive amounts of nutrients in waste water, eutrophication has become a growing problem as effluents of treatment plants enter our waterways. This project investigates whether the growth of algae, after primary clarification, can reduce the impact of eutrophication in addition to producing a sufficient amount of algae for the use of biofuels.<br><br>It is hypothesized that waste water will be able to support the growth of algae and in turn eliminate the excess nitrites and nitrates.<br><br>With waste water collected from the bio-tower influent, measurements were made to determine the total amounts of nutrients present and the growth rates of algae in the environments on each test day. This was done via test strips and turbidity. Experiments were concluded by collecting and calculating the dry weight or Total Suspended Solids (TSS) of the environments. <br><br>The data and results from these tests support the hypothesis, in that growing algae can reduce or even eliminate the excess nutrients and in turn the waste water is able to support the growth of naturally occurring waste water algae. <br><br>These results, if implemented, could allow waste water treatment plants to avoid the use of chemicals, and their cost, in order to reduce excess nutrients, like nitrites and nitrates. By avoiding synthetic methods of elimination, the environment would also benefit. Due to the versatility of algal use, the algae can then be harvested and used for the production of biofuels.

ABSCISIC ACID EFFECTS ON YUCCA FILAMENTOSA UNDER COLD STRESS AS MEASURED BY PROLINE ASSAY: A STUDY OF BOTANICAL EXPRESSION OF PROLINE UNDER ABIOTIC STRESS
Frances Loren Hubley
Woods Cross High School, Woods Cross, UT

Temperature is the greatest risk to agriculture limiting what can be grown where and yield. <br><br>To cope with cold stress, plants produce the compatible solute amino acid proline that restores osmotic balance and protects cell walls. The hypothesis was: Abscisic acid will “signal” the in vivo process that produces the most proline compared to signal chemicals Ca2+ ions, ascorbic acid and hormone salicylic acid. <br><br>This hypothesis was tested with a three part experiment:<br><br>Leaf extracts were collected and assayed from 6 species at -5° C to determine Yucca filamentosa produced the most proline under cold stress. <br><br>After -7° C, 0° C, 4° C, and 10° C cold treatments, Yucca proline content was found maximized at 4° C. <br><br>Ca2+ ions, ascorbic acid, abscisic acid, and salicylic acid were applied to Yucca followed by 4° C cold treatments. Each reaction set included extract treated with the chelator EDTA which removed cytosolic Ca2+ already present. These 5 samples plus a control were analyzed by a proline assay via ninhyrin reactions quantified with spectrometry.<br><br>Abscisic acid (ABA) treatment produced 12% more proline than Ca2+ ions did. Notably, EDTA-treated extract had 50% less proline than the control validating calcium ion signaling of proline production. Although ABA treatment was 12% more effective in this lab study, field application of calcium would provide greater payback. ABA is 100x more expensive than calcium. <br><br>Treatment of crops extends the growing season providing local crops longer reducing shipping and fuel costs. Crops could also be grown many miles farther north.

REDUCTION OF FERTILIZER RATES BY CARBON SEQUESTRATION OF BIOCHAR
Rena Dorothy Weis
New Prague Senior High School, New Prague, MN

The purpose of my experiment was to achieve yields of Zea Mays equal to those of when full fertilizer rates are used by utilizing carbon sequestration of biochar in addition to half of the common local fertilizer rate. Biochar is pure carbon that is composed of biomass that has undergone a heating process called pyrolysis, which produces charcoal that can be used as fertilizer. The use of biochar is carbon negative and a form of carbon sequestration. For my experiment, I had six plots, each with an area of 10m2. The six plots had different concentrations of soil additives. One plot had no soil additives, one had 1kg/m2 of biochar, one had 5kg/m2 of biochar, one had 1kg/m2 of biochar and half of the common local fertilizer rate, one had 5kg/m2 of biochar and half of the common local fertilizer rate and one had full common fertilizer rates applied. I measured the yield produced by each plot. I found that the two plots that had half fertilizer combined with biochar achieved very similar yields to that of the full fertilizer plot, and that yield increased with greater levels of biochar. In conclusion, using biochar as a soil additive enhanced the growth and yield of Zea Mays to the point that only half of the typical amount of fertilizer that is used locally was needed to achieve equal results to that of full fertilizer rates.

THE EFFECTS OF PHTHALATES ON BRASSICA RAPA
Antonio Joseph Morsette
Box Elder High School, Box Elder, MT

This experiment tested the effects of phthalates in plastic water bottles on the Brassica rapa. If found correct, phthalates in plastic water bottles can prove to be harmful to plants such as the Brassica rapa. Thirty-two plants were planted for each test group and grown in a Classroom Plant Growth Chamber. Four water concentrations were used, which included: control (0% concentration of phthalate in water), 25% concentration of phthalate in water, 50% concentration of phthalate in water, 75% concentration of phthalate in water, and 100% concentration of phthalate in water (water was continuously delivered to plants using watering system). Once a week plant heights were measured in mm, number of leaves were counted, pictures were taken, and photosynthetic rates were measured using CO2 and Oxygen gas probes over a 24hour period of time.<br><br>Actual phthalate concentrations in water solutions and plants were determined using Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry. According to the results of the Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry test, a directly proportional relationship between the concentration of microwaved water and phthalate concentration was not observed. There seemed to be no pattern in the phthalate results, though a proportional relationship was observed between the amount of microwaved water and the concentration of adapate, the by-product of phthalate degradation. It is possible that the water was microwaved too long, and because phthalates degrade when exposed to heat UV radiation, it could have decomposed in the microwave or in the GCMS extraction process.

TINY ALLIES: THE EFFECT OF COPROPHILOUS BEETLES ON BRASSICA RAPA AND LOLIUM PERENNE GROWTH AND BIOMASS
Rachel Joy Rounds
MOISD Math Science Technology Center in conjunction with Evart High School, Big Rapids, MI

Coprophilous beetles have an important role in the pasture ecosystem and can contribute to nutrient cycling through dung burial. But how do these beetles benefit plant growth and biomass? This question was addressed by constructing an experiment using three types of coprophilous beetles collected at the Michigan State University Lake City Experiment Station: Onthophagus taurus, Onthophagus nuchicornis and Sphaeridium scarabaeoides. It was hypothesized that Onthophagus taurus would have the greatest effect on the plant’s growth and biomass. To test this hypothesis, six different treatments were prepared using coprophilous beetles, chemical fertilizer, dung only and a control (no dung, beetles or fertilizer). After ten days, the surface dung was removed, the beetles released and the two species of plants were planted into the treatment soils. Brassica rapa was included to study the effect coprophilous beetles have on a rapid life cycle plant. Lolium perenne was used to study the impact on grass grown in the pasture. Results showed that the Onthiophagus nuchicornis treatments appeared to have some effect on the Lolium perenne’s dry weight. The researcher’s discovery of the Onthophagus taurus was the first recorded in Michigan, which demonstrated how much farther north these beetles have spread then previously thought by entomologists.

THE INTENSITY OF ANTHOCYANIN CONCENTRATION VERSUS THE GROWTH OF PLANTS
Skye Kirstyn Willard
Bonneville High School, Ogden, UT

Each year, millions of weed control substances are used; distributing harmful chemicals into our ecosystem. These chemicals have been proven harmful to the environment and all organisms therein. Anthocyanin, a type of Allelochemical, is a natural chemical found in plants that deters the growth of other plant species. <br><br>Six ‘extracts’ were made from leaves of Prunus cerasifera. These extracts were then used to water alfalfa seed under controlled conditions. Five tests were performed with differing extracts ranging from 10/g per 500 mLs of distilled H2O to 100/g per 500 mLs of distilled H2O. Testing was done on extracts by means of a mass spectrometer, in addition to a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).<br><br>Four measures were used to determine the effectiveness of the Anthocyanin in weed control: blade count of the alfalfa (ex. Control 190 blades:Anthocyanin 20 blades) , phenotypic changes to the plant (the 20 blades were wilted and were not green), the ratio of anthocyanin in relationship to the extract, and the isolation of anthocyanin in regrowth.<br><br>Data suggests that Anthocyanins are preventive against growth rate of alfalfa, and increase kill rate. This data is principal for the substitution of harmful chemicals by means of natural chemicals (Anthocyanins). Data shows the use of Allelochemicals lead to better ways to protect the environment by replacing harmful chemicals.

CHARACTERIZATION OF THE SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SINORHIZOBIUM MELILOTI AND ALFALFA PLANTS
Fatima Nadeem Mirza
Kalamazoo Area Mathematics and Science Center, Kalamazoo, MI

Rhizobium, a genus of nitrogen-fixing bacteria, serves a fundamental role in the environment by inducing the formation of root nodules. These bacteria colonize the plant in a symbiotic relationship of nitrogen fixation and carbohydrate exchange. This relationship serves as the cornerstone of all ecological processes. Due to the importance of this phenomenon and the impending organic nitrogen deficit, a deeper understanding of this pathway is necessary. The purpose of this study is to further characterize the symbiotic relationship between Sinorhizobium meliloti and alfalfa. Through a three part-study, including a myo-inositol growth study, a bacterial nodulation study, and a nitrogen nodulation study, this researcher hopes to explore the myo-inositol catabolism pathway and the symbiotic relationship between the bacteria and the plant. This scientist hopes to examine prior research as well as determine a concentration of nitrogen and bacteria at which nodulation is induced or inhibited. Results suggest that the iolA gene is required for growth of S. meliloti with myo-inositol as the sole carbon source whereas fbaB is not. It may also suggest that the iolA gene plays a positive role and the fbaB gene plays a regulatory role in myo-inositol catabolism. This suggests a deeper understanding of the myo-inositol catabolism pathway, which is important as this carbon source is most efficient in promoting bacterial growth. Additionally, the nodulation studies established a bacterial threshold of a -8 dilution factor of an original culture with 306,000,000 CFUs for nodulation and a 5 mM nitrogen threshold for nodulation inhibition. Additional research may be used to further understand the nitrogen-fixing process and the symbiotic relationship of bacteria and their host plants.

ENZYME-MEDIATED DNA METHYLATION IN ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA: THE EFFECT OF ABIOTIC STRESS ON MET1, DRM2, AND CMT3 GENE EXPRESSION
Afia Zarrin Khan
Spring Valley High School, Columbia, SC

Imminent climate change is expected to have effects on both population structures and individual organisms, resulting in a pressing need for scientists to understand molecular and genetic mechanisms involved in stress responses. Plants, as they are stationary, are especially susceptible to environmental stress, and information concerning underlying mechanisms behind their phenotypic plasticity may help design stress-resistant plants, predict the effects of climate change, and improve crop productivity. Recent studies have revealed a new importance of epigenetics in such responses, including DNA methylation alterations. This research aims to determine the effect of abiotic stress on Arabidopsis thalania expression of three genes encoding enzymes involved in the methylation of DNA: DNA methyltransferase 1 (MET1) and chromomethyltransferase 3 (CMT3), which maintain pre-existing methylation patterns following DNA replication, and domains rearranged methyltransferase 2 (DRM2), which functions in de novo methylation. Plants were grown in medium for 16 days, after which salt, cold, and heat stress were administered on time intervals of 16 and 24 hours. Salt stress involved transplanting to 250mM NaCl plates, while heat and cold stresses were administered at 37 degrees C and 4 degrees C respectively. RNA isolation, cDNA production, semi-quantitative RT-PCR, gel electrophoresis, and imaging software were used to measure gene expression. It was found that DRM2 expression alone was significantly greater in all stressed tissue samples than in the control(p<0.025), supporting the premise that new changes in plant DNA methylation patterns may occur as a result of abiotic stress.

MEASURED VOLTAGES PRODUCED BY TREES: A COMPARATIVE STUDY AMONG TWELVE SPECIES
Todd Michael Seiss
Catoctin High School, Thurmont, MD

The voltage difference between trees and soil is a known phenomenon governed by the Nernst equation. The goal of this project was to determine if different tree species produce different voltages, a study that has not been previously conducted.<br><br> The experimental design controlled for many variables, including tree size, soil composition, weather, and location, which facilitated the sampling of twelve trees in nature, each typical of its species. The negative probe of the voltmeter was attached to galvanized steel nails hammered 5cm into the tree, 50cm above the ground. To control for soil pH from tree to tree, the positive probe of the voltmeter was placed in a pH4 buffer solution, and the circuit was completed via an agarose gel salt bridge to the ground. The voltages of each tree were measured consistently for nine days.<br><br> Many tree species produced voltages that were statistically different. The Eastern White Pine had the highest average voltage (624mV), while the Red Maple had the lowest average voltage (414mV). The three Hickory species voltages were not statistically different from each other. Temperature did not have any significant effect on voltage, likely because of the small range (11.6-27.0oC).<br><br> The variation in voltages could be due to differences in species. Because of the low voltage and high internal resistance of the tree, little current is generated (<.1µA). This significantly limits the tree as a power source. However, low-voltage devices, such as thermometers or smoke detectors, could have practical applications in research or forest fire detection.

TRIFORINE SENSITIVITY IN LETTUCE
Aradhana Sinha
Salinas High School, Salinas, CA

The objective of this experiment is to determine if the mutation controlling triforine sensitivity in primitive romaine lettuce (PI491224) is in the same or similar location as the mutation that causes triforine sensitivity in modern romaine lettuce (cv. Valmaine). This will allow future research/breeding to occur on a larger faster scale.<br><br>In the first phase of the experiment I determined sensitivity to triforine in the inbred F4 filial that originated from a cross between insensitive cv. Iceberg and sensitive lettuce PI491224. I tested this by spraying the two-week-old plants with a diluted triforine solution, which killed the sensitive plants. In the second phase of the experiment I wanted to locate the gene for triforine sensitivity. I accomplished this by checking the parent plants (cv. Iceberg and PI491224) of tested population for polymorphism in four molecular markers located next to the triforine sensitivity gene previously mapped in cv. Valmaine. Using the markers that showed polymorphism between cv. Iceberg and PI491224, I tested their offspring (population from phase 1) to see if these alleles were linked to triforine sensitivity. In Phase 3, sequencing was done on DNA amplified with Marker 4.<br><br>In Phase 1 of the experiment, I found that the F4 filial matched the phenotypes predicted by Mendelian distribution. In phase 2, by discovering that the gene BAIS was linked to triforine sensitivity, I determined that the triforine sensitivity gene was located in a similar location in Valmaine and Romaine. In Phase 3, Single Nucleotide Variations were found at bp38 and bp76, and an Insertion/Deletion (InDel) from bp121 to bp150. In the future, I can differentiate alleles using Gel Electrophoresis with a smaller Primer that brackets the InDel.

THE EFFECT OF KNOCKING OUT THE PHENULALANINE AMMONIALYASE (PAL) GENE IN PETUNIA HYBRIDA
Feodor V. Orlov
West Lafayette Junior Senior High School, West Lafayette, IN

Petunia hybrida gives off volatile compounds during the night because it is pollinated by the hawkmoth, a nocturnal insect. All volatile compounds from the Petunia hybrida are derived from the amino acid phenylalanine. The PAL enzyme makes phenylalnine into trans-cinnamic acid by taking away an amino group from phenylalanine. The PAL gene was blocked by the RNAi method. These transgenic PAL knock-out plants were used to find the role of PAL in production volatile compounds in the Petunia hybrida. If phenylalanine ammonia lyase was blocked then the volatile compounds directly made from phenylalanine will increase in amount whereas all other volatile compounds made from trans-cinnamic acid will diminish. Volatile compounds were collected from transgenic and non-transgenic Petunia hybrida plants and analyzed use of a GC-MS. The amount of phenylacetalaldehyde and phenylethanol, which are directly made from phenylalanine doubled in the transgenic plants, and all other compounds made from trans-cinnamic acid decreased in the transgenic plant. An application for this could be seeing how scent attracts pollinators. Blocking PAL is needed to make a scentless Petunia hybrida, where PAL and the enzyme responsible for making phenylacetalaldehyde are blocked, because it is only theorized that the hawkmoths are more attracted to scent that to the color of the P. hybrida. Also trans-cinnamic acid is a building block for lignin. If PAL was blocked in some cells, then it would be possible to get easier biofeuls and revert the extra phenylalanine to make medicines.

NATURE'S NURTURE
Warner A. Ward
Moore Haven Jr-Sr High School, Moore Haven, FL

My project investigates the potential of mycorrhizal infusions as a farming innovation in southwest Florida. Mycorrhizae form a symbiotic mutualistic relationship with the roots of plants. In this relationship the plant provides the fungus with necessary carbohydrates to live, while the fungus allows for a higher nutrient uptake by the plants. Mycorrhizae are most commonly known for their associations with orchids and their role in nutrient poor tropical soil. However, this relationship which is beneficial to both the fungus, and the plant, is not just exclusive with orchids. That’s right, mycorrhizae can be found in varies types of plants. In my study this year I plan on truly utilizing these mycorrhizae to see just how effective they are to some of the crops we grow in southwest Florida.

However there exists plants with unknown food properties by much of the population and its advantage is restricted to a small group of people whose knowledge of these properties have been handed down from father to son.<br><br>This has happened with the elm, which produces a type of invasive root, which destroys sidewalks and has been widely rejected by the local community not knowing that in sixteen of the citiy´s neighborhoods the elm fruits (samaras) were eaten. Thanks to the research carried out during the 2010 Science Fair, some of its properties have become known and a growing interest for this product has arisen amongst the population.<br><br>With the object of knowing its nutritional value and identifying its different compounds elm seeds collected in the city´s Northern Neighbourhood were studied.<br><br>Different data was collected, amongst them pH; nutritional analysis; the introduction of samara rations to monogastric and poligastric animals with an end to determine the acceptance and palatability; dehydration and drying to see its conservation.<br><br>The results have shown that its nutritional value is comparable to that of other seeds turning it into a non conventional food source apt for animal and human consumption.

BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF MELOIDOGYNE CHITWOODI: HOST STATUS AND PAECILOMYCES LILACINUS FUNGAL PARASITIZATION
Heidi Marie Wade
Crescent Valley High School, Corvallis, OR

The root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne chitwoodi, is a major pest on potatoes in the Pacific Northwest, causing significant economic losses in this region where over half of the U.S. crop is produced. Consumer demand for produce grown with reduced chemicals and the environmental damage from pesticides used to control this nematode make alternative methods of control desirable. Two alternative biological control methods, rotation of crops resistant to the pest and control by a natural parasite, were evaluated. Four field corn cultivars and two pea cultivars were assessed for their suitability as M. chitwoodi resistant rotation crops between potato plantings. Nematode eggs extracted from their roots 55 days after inoculation to the soil were counted and a reproductive index (R=final population/initial population) was calculated. Field corn cultivars 35K02, 34A15, 37Y12, and 31G70 were found to be non-hosts (R = 0.09, 0.03, 0.02 and 0.04 respectively), with > 99% reduction in M. chitwoodi reproduction compared to the positive control, Steven’s wheat (R = 10.1). Pea cv. Serge was a good host (R = 1.4) and pea Survivor was a poor host (R= 0.7), with 87% and 91% less M. chitwoodi reproduction respectively, than wheat (P = 0.001). Planted in a potato rotation, these corn cultivars and pea cv. Serge would be expected to help reduce the M. chitwoodi population proliferating on previous potato crops. The fungus Paecilomyces lilacinus, shown to reduce populations of other species of root-knot nematodes by parasitizing the egg stage of development did not significantly reduce reproduction of M. chitwoodi.

MOLECULAR IDENTIFICATION OF DAGGER NEMATODES FROM AGRICULTURAL SOILS
Alice Yung-Mei Hwang
Greenwood Laboratory School, Springfield, MO

Nematodes are abundant in most environments; a variety of species can be present in a single field soil sample. As virus vectors, nematodes are plant parasites that can severely damage plants and crops. Accurate identification of plant parasitic nematode species can often be difficult and requires highly trained personnel. The purpose of this experiment is to use molecular tools to distinguish between the nematode species of Xiphinema index and Xiphinema americanum. Using prepared nematode DNA, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to amplify the samples for analysis. PCR uses a process of heating and cooling in cycles to provide hundreds to millions of copies of the particular target DNA. The PCR method required the use of two primers ITS-Forward and ITS-Reverse, 1 DNA template, deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP), the enzyme Taq polymerase, buffer, MaCl2, and water. After preparing the samples with the appropriate mix, the 16 samples were placed in a PCR machine where denaturation, annealing, and extension were performed on the DNA fragment. The PCR products were then placed in an electrophoresis gel for the separation of molecules based on size and charge. Gel electrophoresis uses an electric field to move molecules through an agarose gel to visualize the bands under UV lights. My results showed the presence of the nematode species of Xiphinema index and Xiphinema americanum according to the size of the gel bands.

A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF PHYTOLITH-OCCLUDED CARBON SEQUESTRATION RATES
Steven Kaichi Okada
Henry Perrine Baldwin High School, Wailuku, HI

This experiment was carried out to investigate the phytolith-occluded carbon sequestration rates (POCSR) of locally-grown cultivars of sugar cane and napier grass. Phytoliths are microscopic silica bodies that form throughout the epidermis of plants during their lifetimes and have recently been shown to play an important role in terrestrial carbon sequestration. As phytoliths form, they trap carbon and because of their durability and inorganic nature, effectively sequester carbon dioxide for thousands of years. Studies demonstrate that different types of plants possess disparate POCSR. Thus it is important to know the POCSR of cultivars to make informed crop choices with the aims of sequestering as much carbon dioxide as possible.<br><br> In the experiment, an acid digestion and centrifuge method was utilized to isolate the phytoliths from dried samples of the different cultivars. Phytolith weight was recorded and isolates were analyzed for carbon. Based on the percentages of the carbon analysis, POCSR was derived and determined for samples and averaged out for each cultivar. <br><br> The data showed that cultivar 98-3989 demonstrated the highest POCSR, ~2.2t/e- CO2 ha/yr, and that cultivar PxD possessed the lowest POCSR, ~0.3t/e- CO2 ha/yr ,thus proving that a farmer’s crop choice can and does play a major role in POCSR and can serve as an environmental incentive for farmers to grow crops with high POCSR over cultivars with a low POCSR. A local sugar cane company, HC&S, could use these results to make an agronomic key to select and grow sugar cane cultivars that sequester more carbon dioxide.

Lindsey Marie Stein
Hankinson High School, Hankinson, ND

Purpose: To compare the effects of commercial bactericides on the growth and production of garden beans. Secondly, to compare the inhibitory properties of the bactericides on the growth of pathogenic bacteria.<br><br>Procedure: Collected three different types of natural commercial bactericides, along with two chemical commercial bactericides. Prepared solutions according to their application rates.<br><br>Test Plot Study: This procedure was done to see how each of the solutions effected the growth of the bean plant. Planted four replications of one cultivar in a total of 24 ten foot rows. Applied 2000 mls of one of the treatments per row after four weeks of growth. Allowed another four weeks of growth, then harvested the beans by hand. I then measured and massed the beans. Repeated this process for two more pickings. Analyzed samples of green beans for their Copper and Iron content.<br><br>Pathogen Study: Tested 5 bactericides for their inhibitory properties on the growth of bean pathogens. Furthermore, analyzed the solutions ability to fend off the growth of bacteria when applied directly to the bean plant.<br><br>Conclusion: In the Test Plot Study, Neem Oil showed the most beneficial properties toward green beans, while Control had the least valuable contributions. In the Pathogen Study, Neem Oil was the most effective at inhibiting the growth of bacteria, while Acme was the least effective. Throughout the research study, Neem Oil proved to be the overall solution. Based upon this research, I believe natural bactericides, such as Neem Oil, proved to be a very beneficial asset in green bean production.

Tanner John Coppin
Hankinson High School, Hankinson, ND

PURPOSE: To determine if Curlycup Gumweed extract could potentially be used as an environmentally friendly pesticide. Secondly, to observe whether the weed extract would have any adverse or beneficial effects on the growth and quality of barley. PROCEDURE: Collected two cultivars of barley, one weed (Curlycup Gumweed), and four chemical pesticides. Prepared a weed solution consisting of 10 grams of Curlycup Gumweed with 200 mLs of water (20:1). Field application rates used for chemicals. TEST PLOT: Planted three replications of the two barley cultivars in a total of 36, 10-foot rows in length, 50 grams of seeds per row (Rows were 1 foot apart between solutions and 2 feet apart between seed trials). Applied 2,000 mLs of one of the treatments per row after four weeks. Allowed a three month growing period, then measured the plant height and harvest the barley heads by hand. After harvest, extracted the seeds from the heads. Stored seeds for further analysis (Percent protein, starch, and fiber along with moisture content, bushels per acre and test weight). INSECT STUDY: Drop Method: Used actual contact of the Curlycup Gumweed extract or insecticides on Fall Armyworms, Black Cutworms and Russian Wheat Aphids to determine their fatality rate. Ingestion: Determined the killing effects of the extracts by impregnating a growth medium with the Curlycup Gumweed extract or insecticide. Ladybug Migration: Observed the effects of the products on the beneficial Ladybug. MICROBIAL STUDY: Kirby Bauer: Determined the inhibitory effects of the products on fungal pathogens of barley. Barley Straw Algae Test: Observed the effects of the products on retarding the growth of Ulothrix algae. CONCLUSION: Overall, I feel that Curlycup Gumweed has the potential be used as an environmentally friendly insecticide. Furthermore, I believe that Curlycup Gumweed will become a major asset to the agricultural community.

THE EFFICIENCY OF DUCKWEED AS A WATER FILTER, YEAR TWO
Sharjeel Ahmed Syed
John Jay Science and Engineering Academy, San Antonio, TX

Water filtration is one of societies’ most essential requirements to sustain life. One of the newest methods used is bio-filtration, the treating of water through biological organisms. In this year’s study, Duckweed’s capabilities as a bio-filter were tested. The range of this plant’s filtering range was expanded by testing its effects on additional chemicals. This year, varying volumed tanks were utilized to test efficiency of Duckweed's filtration of the chemicals tested last year as well as those added this year, and how these condiitons affect the process. It was hypothesized that the Duckweed would quickly and efficiently lower chemical concentrations to a level below EPA regulation. Duckweed was also hypothesized to grow better in the water with the higher concentrations of the chemicals. It was further hypothesized that both processes would be more efficient in lower volumes of water.<br><br> To test hypothesis 1, water containing high concentrations of the chemicals tested was monitored in two different sets of tanks, with and without Duckweed. To test the second hypothesis, another set of tanks was filled with tap water, containing 0ppm of all chemicals, in which Duckweed growth was compared with the Duckweed growth in the first set. Since each set contained three tanks of varying volumes, the third hypothesis was tested amongst the individual tanks in each set.<br><br> Duckweed was very efficient in filtering all the chemicals tested and grew better in the chemically enriched water, thus supporting the first two hypotheses. However, both processes were more efficient in higher volumes of water, not lower as was hypothesized. Due to Duckweed’s environmental friendliness and its proven efficiency, it has high potential for being the “green” of future water treatment.

PLANT GRAFTING III
Taylor Rae Lawson
The Academy of Science and Technology, The Woodlands, TX

This project evaluated the compatibility and success rate of individual grafting techniques through demonstration of the asexual process of plant propagation. The grafting techniques of bud, cleft, and whip were utilized on calendula, pansy and snapdragon plants. The success rate of the graft was measured by the outcome of fusion between each of the system's vascular cambium tissues. Various combinations of plant species and grafting techniques were used and compared. Data suggested that the pansy plant and the bud technique had the highest individual success. In terms of combination and compatibility snapdragon and pansy were found to be the best. The highest successful compatibility rates were produced by the combined bud technique and pansy plant.<br><br>The findings from this project provide the agricultural and floricultural industries with beneficial grafting compatibility rates that will contribute to increased productivity of their root stocks and scions. The findings also give precedence to genetic alterations and resistance to disease in the various combinations of plant grafting.

WHEN SUGAR ISN'T SO SWEET: A STUDY COMPARING INCINERATION METHODS OF SACCHARUM OFFICINARUM FOLIAGE ON THE DECOMPOSITION OF PESTICIDAL/HERBICIDAL CHEMICALS
Brianna Leilani Bourgeois, Katie Ann Chiasson, 
Lutcher High School, Lutcher, LA

Sugarcane is found all over South Louisiana, and most farmers burn the unneeded leafy material when harvesting the sugarcane. Many people have increased allergic symptoms when sugarcane is being burned. However, it is important that farmers burn the leafy material because it is currently the only logical way to get rid of it. There are three different ways to burn sugarcane: standing up straight, pushed over horizontally, and cut up in the middle of the rows. We wanted to find out the incineration method that would release the least amount of pesticides and herbicides by taking the temperature of the different incineration methods of sugarcane. The higher temperatures would cause the pesticides and herbicides to burn more thoroughly. We tested the three different methods of burning sugarcane by recreating a sugarcane field on a smaller scale. We first tested sugarcane standing straight up by standing the sugarcane up in the ground in an area of 0.09m2. For the horizontal position, we laid cane over two aluminum frames simulating rows in a sugarcane field. We also kept it in an area of 0.09m2. For the sugarcane on the ground, we placed cut sugarcane and leafy material in a 0.09m2 area. We repeated these steps for an area of 0.36m2 and 1.00m2. When burning each of these, we used an infrared thermometer to get a maximum and average temperature for each burn. When burning the sugarcane for areas of 0.09m2, 0.36m2, and 1.00m2, we found that average temperatures of the burns were 382, 454, and 499 degrees Celsius, respectively for vertical burns; 499, 416, and 566 degrees Celsius, respectively for horizontal burns; and 521, 216, and 371 degrees Celsius, respectively for ground burns. From our data, we concluded that the least effective method of burning sugarcane was lying on the ground. This was the highest temperature for the 0.09m2 trial. However, we believe it was caused by the easy flow of oxygen to the fire since it was on such a small scale. Our graphs show that the temperature continued to decrease as the area increased. This is why we have concluded this method to be least effective. Also, the smoke seen with ground burning sugarcane illustrates that the sugarcane is not being burned completely.

THE "T. TREE," TEST: NATURAL BOTANICAL REMEDY, YES OR NO?!
Lachonda Marie Lacey, Breanne Wiiliams, 
South Sumter High School, Bushnell, FL

The purpose of the project is to test tea tree oil alone and when combined with three other natural remedies (Garlic, Echinacea, Acai) against staphylococcus aureus to see if the tea tree oil efficiency can be enhanced. The hypothesis was the tea tree oil would work more efficient alone when compared to its combination with the other remedies.<br><br>The procedures are as follows, first you label all centrifuge tubes and plates in a corresponding order. The tea tree oil will be used as the control then will be mixed with the garlic, Echinacea, and acai using the vortex. The discs you get by punching holes in the bibulous paper will be used to soak up the mixtures and be plated. After spreading the staphylococcus aureus on the agar plate place the discs in the places they are labeled, seal plates up and place them in the 35 degree incubator. After 24 hours take the plates and measure the diameter of the area of inhibition record results, do the same after 48 hours.<br><br>The outcome of the project was the growth after 24 hours was complete so the measurements were the same for 48 hours. Plate 1 the highest growth was tea tree/acai with a measure of 36mm area of inhibition, for plate two it was tea tree oil36mm. The highest average overall was tea tree with 35mm, following was tea/acai with 33mm, then tea/garlic with 25.3mm, and tea/Echinacea with 21.5mm. So our conclusion is that the hypothesis was proven correct.

Colegio Cientifico-sede San Carlos, Santa Clara, Alajuela, COSTA RICA

This research determined the basic parameters for the isolation and electrofusion of protoplasts in four species of Araceae, sensitive and tolerant to different fungi, bacteria and parasites known as “Mal Seco”, an essential process towards procuring resistance to the disease by somatic hybrids. In Costa Rica, cocoyam constitute one of the main demand controllers due to their continuous changes in value; in like manner, outside our borders, cocoyam yield approximately US$5,32 millions per year in profits.<br><br>As regards to the methodology, the protoplast isolation and electrofusion was conducted starting from mesophyll taken from leaves of in vitro plants of Xanthosoma sagittifolium (L.) Schott, X. violaceum Schott, X. caracu and greenhouse plants of Colocasia esculenta var. antiquorum. The explants were submerged in an osmotic solution and subjected, at the same time to a mechanical rupture, to induce cell plasmolysis.<br><br>Four enzymatic combinations were tested: the highest outputs were 1,62x10^7 and 1,71x10^7 protoplasts/gram of tissue, obtained respectively from the X. sagittifolium and X. violaceum species, with the enzymatic combination of 0,5 % Cellulase R10 and 0,1% Pectinase, for a 30-60 minute period of time.<br><br>A washing solution and a flotation solution were used for the separation and purifying of protoplasts. In the electrofusion process between X. sagittifolium, X. violaceum and C. esculenta protoplasts, the optimum parameters were adjusted, in a first and second alignment phases, to 8 V during 90 s each, and an intermediate phase of two 45 µs pulses (170 V), to induce the fusion of protoplasts through physical means.

EVALUATION OF BIO-FUNGUS PREPARATIONS TRICHODERMA SPP. IN TOMATO SEED
Karen Margarita Viloria, Yeiner David Mendoza, 
Institucion Educativa San Pedro de Uraba, San Pedro de Uraba, Antioquia, COLOMBIA

Different species of the Trichoderma fungus favor plant nutrient acquisition through specialized absorption structures present in the soil. This will produce more vigorous plants with greater root development, which allow them to face stressful situations in a successfully way. Besides it has been showed that these species of fungus are good antagonists for phytopathogenic fungus that attack vegetable crops, causing wilt of plants and fruit rot. In the current work we report the activity of Trichoderma fungus as control biological agent in tomato seedbeds from a traditional bio-prepared and a commercial bio-based made out of Trichoderma spp (Esculentum Lycopersicum species) against sp phytopathogen in San Pedro de Uraba municipality of Antioquia, Colombia. These two treatments in relation to the control, showed an average rate of 22.62% more in height, 32.5% greater stem diameter, 8.075% and 33.71% of the area of true leaves and root development, respectively, on the other hand, were more effective and with lower prevalence of the disease. Therefore we may conclude that the Trichoderma spp application and in this case the commercial and handcraft bio-prepared in the first development stages of the tomato seedlings gives a considerable raising to the aerial part as the root part giving them greater vigor and protection towards pathogenic fungus. In conclusion this work evidence the biological effectiveness and the potential bio-controller activity of a traditional bio-prepared made of Trichoderma spp.

INVESTIGATION OF A NOVEL HERBAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AGENT: LIQUIDAMBAR FORMOSANA HANCE EXUDATE, BORNYL CINNAMATE
Justine Li, Serife Uzun, 
Jericho High School, Jericho, NY

Natural remedies for inflammation are of importance because non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and coxib pharmaceuticals used for temporary pain relief by patients with diseases ranging from rheumatoid arthritis to multiple sclerosis have deleterious effects. Extracts from the East Asia-indigenous Liquidambar formosana (LF) Hance have been incorporated in traditional medicines, thus identification of a natural anti-inflammatory remedy in the form of bornyl cinnamate (BC), isolated from extracted essential oils of LF analyzed at NCHU’s Hui-Sun Forest Plantation, Taiwan, was the focus of this study. BC concentrations ranging from 1 to 100ug/mL were tested against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced inflammation on 264.7 macrophage cells. Negative, positive, and curcumin (10ug/mL) samples served as controls. An MTT cytotoxicity assay, Griess/nitric oxide assay, Prostaglandin E2 production analysis, and COX-2, iNOS, IKK, IKB, NF-kB protein expression analysis was conducted to assess the efficacy of BC, and to determine inhibitory effects on the COX-2 pathway of inflammation. Only BC concentrations of 50 and 100ug/mL instigated over 50% cytotoxic effect. Decreased NO and PGE2 production from 38 to 17uM NO and 575 to 260pg/mL PGE2 with increased concentrations of BC (1 to 20ug/mL) and 55% decrease from the +LPS control was noted via ELISA. Spectroscopy, Immunoblot, and Chemi-Smart 3000 protein expression image acquisition showed a dose-dependent decrease of expression of proteins analyzed, indicating decreased inflammation. Enhancements made to this study will examine BC’s effect on the COX-1 pathway along with BC utilization in systematic treatment of inflammation, thus presenting BC as a promising novel constituent for inflammation-related disease treatment.

A SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL ANALYSIS OF PHYTOPLANKTON ASSEMBLAGES IN CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI
Vineet Aggarwal, Ria Goel, 
St. Andrew's Episcopal School, Ridgeland, MS

The phytoplankton assemblages in central Mississippi have been greatly under-researched. In an effort to expand our understanding of algae, this project examines the effect environment and time have on the algal assemblages in three different lakes, Lake Sherwood, Middle Lake, and AJs Lake, all of which are in close proximity. Environmental factors that were measured concurrently with the collection of algae demonstrated that the three lakes were similar in size, water, and depth, where the major input of water was runoff from rainfall. A Zeiss inverted microscope was used to identify and count the phytoplankton species at a magnification of 400X. We found that Lake Sherwood was characterized by low species diversity and was dominated by a single phytoplankton species on each date. In contrast, Middle Lake and AJs Lake had more diverse phytoplankton assemblages and typically several species were abundant. The most abundant taxa were species of dinoflagellates, cyanobacteria, and euglenoids while diatoms, green algae, and golden-brown algae were usually present in low abundance. A statistical technique similar to a blocked ANOVA showed that the lakes’ phytoplankton assemblages were statistically different both in space and time as their respective values, p=0.036 and p=0.041, were less than p=0.05, and an ordination technique revealed that Lake Sherwood phytoplankton were unique out of the three lakes. Despite their close proximity, similar size and nutrient status, the resident phytoplankton species composition and abundance in the three lakes varied spatially and temporally.

Philippine Science High School- Eastern Visayas Campus, Palo, Leyte, PHILIPPINES

Spodoptera litura, a significant polyphagous agricultural pest in Southeast Asia, causes large infestations and massive damage to economic crops. The enhancement of biological pesticides to exterminate S. litura became necessary since the pest has developed resistance to many synthetic pesticides. This study tested the efficacy of Jatropha curcas bark extract as a bio-pesticide against S. litura. <br><br> <br><br>A group of first instar larvae was collected and mass reared under laboratory conditions. J. curcas bark was extracted with methanol and concentrated in vacuo. Two mL each of 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% J. curcas methanol extract, distilled water, and the synthetic pesticide, were sprayed on each of the petri dishes containing five larvae. All treatments were observed for 23 hours from the time of application, every hour for the first three hours, and every two hours onwards. Larvae behavior was determined by their live response to probing with a fine-tipped brush.<br><br>Results revealed that all J. curcas methanol extracts exhibited highly effective larvaecidal effects on S. litura than the synthetic pesticide. Statistical analyses indicated that the most effective treatment is 100% J. curcas extract killing all larvae after 11 hours. <br><br>The J. curcas oil containing sterols and terpene alcohols was reported to have insecticidal activity (Adebowale et. al, 2006). The larvaecidal activity of the extracts against S. litura may be due to the presence of these bio-active compounds. If developed, Jatropha curcas can be a potent pesticide against other agricultural pests.

HOW VENUS FLYTRAP MEMORIZES WEAK STIMULI FOR AN ACTION POTENTIAL?
Yuji Amano, Kosuke Kusano, Ryota Eguchi
Omiya High School, Saitama, Saitama, JAPAN

Rapid movement of Venus flytraps has attracted many researchers including Charles Darwin. It’s known touching trigger hairs on a lobe twice induces trap lobe closure. But the exact mechanism is still unknown. Because the sensitivity of hairs is too high to analyze the effect of mechanical stimulus.<br><br>Volkov et al. (2007) applied electrical stimuli between midrib and lobe, and found electrical stimuli could close lobe without touching hairs and that electrical stimuli weaker than threshold for trap closing were effective if applied repeatedly. Based on these results, they proposed existence of accumulative memory called “Electrical Memory”. Trap closure without touching hairs was also induced with mechanical stimuli to lobe or midrib by our colleague (Kamiya 2008, unpublished), enabling us to investigate relationship between strength of mechanical stimuli and trap closure.<br><br>Firstly, we tested whether mechanical stimuli were accumulative using a special device (called G-sochi) for applying constant mechanical stimuli to midrib. Using G-sochi, we found that consecutive stimuli closed trap more effectively than two stimuli, suggesting the memory is accumulative similar to Volkov's results.<br><br>Next, we measured electrical potentials induced by trigger hair touching a hand-made Ag/AgCl external electrode. We confirmed trap closure was induced as soon as second potential change (probably action potential) occurred. Finally we tested relationship between mechanical stimuli and action potentials combining the two our systems.<br><br>Here we report conditions necessary for trap closure and propose a stepwise memory system in Venus flytraps.

THE EFFECTS OF TRIFOLITOXIN ON THE ELIMINATION OF CITRUS GREENING
Alex Keeler
South Sumter High School, Bushnell, FL

The purpose of this project is to find an inexpensive alternative to eliminate Citrus Greening, as well as culturing a bacterial strain closest to the Liberibacter family in order to create a baseline for testing of antibiotics as well a starting point for discovering the medium used to culture Liberibacter Asiaticus. This scientist believes that antibiotic in question, Trifolitoxin, will be an effective inhibitor vs. Liberiabcter Asiaticus as well as the Babaco strain discovered. The Babaco strain is hypothesized to be both culturable and similar to the Liberbacter species. Experimentation involved the purification of Tfx from growing Rhisobium PTFX6 using a filtration method involving C18 beads and a methanol rinss (80% & 20%). Once purified, , it was tested for effectiveness vs. Ecoli and a susceptible Rhisobium strain. The scientist then mapped, described, and plated the Babaco for optimal growth. Comparison of the metabolic pathways of Babaco and Liberibacter Asiaticus was then conducted, as well as a 16s test, and a similarity percentage of 95% was found. Tfx was then used in zone of inhibition plating vs. Babaco, in preperation for use in the field. Tfx will then be directly injected into infected citrus trees as well as Rhisobium PTFX6 fed to carrier psyllids, essentially changing the vector of the diesease to the vector of the cure. In conclusion, if tfx is proven effective against Liberibacter Asiaticus, then a cure for a multi-million dollar issue in the citrus industry will be solved. If not, moer antibiotics will be tested vs. Liberibacter Asiaticus using Babaco as a baseline for potential effectiveness.

THE EFFECTS OF PHEROMONES ON DIAPREPES ROOT WEEVILS
Evan Cliff MacKay
Vero Beach High School, Vero Beach, FL

Citrus is a major industry, especially in Indian River County, but the trees are very susceptible to pests and disease including the Diaprepes root weevil. This exotic pest came from Puerto Rico in 1964 and has no natural predator here. Adults feed on the citrus leaves, but the real damage occurs in the larval stage; larvae eat the citrus roots. The current method to combat Diaprepes, pesticides, is unattractive because of toxicity, resistance, and difficulty delivering the poison to the roots where the larvae are feeding. Using pheromones has been helpful combatting many other insect species. Pheromones can be used for mating disruption, traps, or measurements about insect activity. Chemical analysis using an insect antenna preparation and a mass spectrometer has suggested that male Diaprepes secrete a pheromone in their feces (frass) that attracts females. For this project, males and females were separated and allowed to feed and excrete feces upon citrus leaves. Then tests were done to see if these leaves attracted male or female Diaprepes weevils. This study demonstrated that females greatly prefer leaves that had been fed upon by males (G test confidence of 99.96%), presumably because of the deposited feces. Male Diaprepes showed no preferences for male or female leaves. In a comparison between fresh leaves and simulated fed upon leaves, females preferred the fresh leaves, suggesting leaf odors or physical disruption of the leaf was not the attractant (confidence 99.91%). Further study comparing male feces to an empty cage showed the females numerically favored the side with male feces (confidence 88.9%). This project could have a major application, because once the pheromone can be isolated and synthesized, traps could be made and distributed in groves to capture reproducing female Diaprepes, protecting our trees and our way of life.

IMPROVING THE ORYZA SATIVA'S ABIOTIC STRESS TOLERANCE BASED ON THE GENETIC ENGINEERING OF THE OSMOREGULATED TREHALOSE SYNTHASE A GENE, YEAR THREE
Andrew Michael Joseph
Episcopal School of Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL

The Oryza Sativa plant (rice) is one of the world’s most dependent food crops. Producing new rice cultivars with enhanced abiotic stress tolerance (AST) would have an enormous impact not only on global food production, but also on the uneven food distribution due to the lack of arable land in some countries. The regulated overexpression of Escherichia coli trehalose biosynthetic genes: Osmoregulated Treahlose Synthesis (otsA and otsB) into rice was used to increase its AST. This requires engineering of both genes into a separate line of rice followed by their pollination to produce offspring that could carry both genes; this method is very complex and time consuming. To date, there is limited knowledge regarding the specific functions of the trehalose biosynthetic genes. The purpose of this experiment was to genetically engineer the gene that produces all of the material, otsA, into rice to potentially produce the trehalose, and grow rice in a wider range of environments. <br><br>The otsA gene was inserted into the pCmHU plasmid, and Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation was performed so that the target gene could be engineered into the rice embryos.<br><br>To date, there are rice embryos growing calli on the selection media, which strongly suggests that the embryos have been successfully genetically engineered since the desired and the antibiotic resistant genes are linked in the plasmid.<br><br>Ultimately, the successfully grown transgenic rice plants, carrying otsA, will be compared to the wild-type rice plants in their ability to produce trehalose, and increase plant yield under various environmental stresses.

CASTOR: NODES AND PGR'S
Megan Courtney Mears
North Marion High School, Citra, FL

This experiment was conducted to see if the plant growth regulator Pix would decrease the inter-node lengths of the plant Ricinus communis, or castor. Six plots of castor were planted. These plots had 6 rows with 50 plants planted per row. The Pix sprayed plots were hypothesized to have inter-node lengths 50 cm shorter than the total plots that were not sprayed with Pix. This hypothesis was disproved, as there was only a 60 mm difference in the lengths of the inter-nodes. The Pix sprayed nodes were 60 mm greater in length than the nodes from the control plots. The total number of nodes was not decreased in the plots sprayed with Pix. The difference in node length varied greatest in the average sum of all the nodes. However, in individual node numbers, nodes 9 through 19 had the most variation between the treatments. Ten plants per plot were measured for their inter-node lengths using an electronic digital caliper. A total of 60 plants were measured, and the data was averaged into 5 different categories. The data was averaged per plant, then per plot, and finally per treatment. This allowed for the plots sprayed with Pix to be directly compared with the plots that were not sprayed with the regulator.

BIOCONTROL OBTENTION FROM VEGETABLES EXTRACTS WITH INSECTICIDE POTENTIAL
Allison Daniel Fernandes Coelho Souza
Colegio Santa Luzia, Imperatriz, Maranhao, BRASIL

For the effective pest control with low environmental impact are needed alternative substances, derived from the plant secondary metabolism, providing safety, biodegradability, economic feasibility and applicability. This project was first developed in 2009, where I did a literature research about the insecticide potential existing in the leaves of Ocimum basilicum and Mentha arvensis. In 2010, the second year of the project, I did preliminary analyzes of applications in insect species Oecophylla longinoda, and identified two classes of organic compounds with insecticide activity in vegetables extracts. This year's project, I confirmed the insecticide potential of extracts from the efficacy analysis of the extracts with different solvents, and the construction of an insecticide prototype that releases organic compounds in the form of volatilization, establishing an alternative harmless to the environment, contributing to achieving of biocontrol in crops. The experiments were made from the analysis of insecticide activity of the extracts as well as the prototype with secondary metabolites acting in synergy. Some of these metabolites were identified in phytochemical screening. For the last test of the extracts were used six samples of plants infested by insects of the species Acromyrmex spp, and Metopolophium dirhodum, were: Fragaria vesca, Raphis excelsa, Lycopersicon esculentum, Lactuca sativa, Hibiscus sabdariffa and Malpighia glabra. After the trial period, it was found that the two extracts in the concentrations studied, Showed effectiveness, without presenting any pathogenic effects to the plant and the handler. The insecticide was effective, considering the reduced level of plant insects and effectiveness testing of the prototype.

REUSE OF PLASTIC BOTTLES IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF A SUBSURFACE IRRIGATION SYSTEM
Ana Luisa Lopes Marques Coutinho
Colegio Paraiso, Juazeiro do Norte, Ceara, BRASIL

The high cost of the irrigation equipment and the limited availability of water in some regions limit the use of irrigation by small farmers in arid and semiarid regions of the planet. In order to reverse this situation, it was designed an irrigation project to meet the prerequisites for high efficiency of water application, low power consumption, low cost of deployment and easy handling by the producer. After analyzing the various systems of irrigation, subirrigation was chosen because it greatly reduces water evaporation, avoiding its waste and soil salinization and preventing soil erosion. The alternative to high cost of the materials found in trade was the idea of reuse PET bottles as the basic material for the construction of the water conducting system, and microtubules polyethylene used in chairs for the making of issuers. To prove the viability, field tests were performed that allowed the calculation of the flow. The system was subjected to a pressure of 2.0 meters of water column (mwc), and in this condition, it was obtained a flow of 11. 11.0 l / hour per linear foot, measured from five issuers, spaced 20 inches. This flow rate allowed the formation of a wet track along the bottles buried at 10 cm from the surface, location of the rows. Thus, the system achieves environmental and economic advantages such as reuse of polluting materials, reducing waste of water, soil conservation, energy saving, low cost of manufacture and maintenance of the system and a greater supply of food.

INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PIRIFORMOSPORA INDICA AND GLOMUS INTRARADICES ON MAIZE
Michael Allen Mann
Westwood High School, Austin, TX

Increasing food production yields are necessary; one underutilized solution is the use of soil microbes. Experiments were completed to test if two soil fungi, Piriformospora indica and Glomus intraradices could increase the yield of Zea mays. In the first experiment, corn grown in a sterilized mix of sand and potting soil were inoculated with either Glomus intradices (“AMF”), P. indica (“Pin”), and each fungus (“Both”), or no fungi (“Control”). After four weeks of growth, there was no significant differences in biomass or correlation between percent fungal colonization. The second experiment used a randomized complete block design using non-sterilized soil, including increased fungal additions dosage treatments, Pin x3 and AMF x3, to ensure the concentration was not limiting colonization. Plants inoculated with Pin x3 had a trend towards greater shoot biomass and a significant increase of root biomass compared to the Both, AMF x3 and Control. In a final experiment, I used living Texas farm soil. Plants were grown with reduced water for 7 weeks. Root biomass was increased with Pin X3 but to a lesser extent than in experiment two. Differences in colonization by AMF fungi and Pin in the Both treatment demonstrated that there is competition for root colonization with AMF being colonization limited by Pin. This is the first research to show that P. indica and G. intraradices can simultaneously colonize plants, and P. indica is more likely to colonize with other natural fungi present, which may make plants more resilient to environmental stress.

THE DISTRIBUTION OF GLUCOSE AND INVERTASE ENZYME ACTIVITY IN YELLOW PEAR TOMATO PLANTS
Lilly Felicia Chiou
Carlsbad High School, Carlsbad, NM

This project is to locate glucose and invertase activity in Yellow Pear tomato plant and to see if there is any correlation between them. My results show that fruits contain the highest concentration of glucose, 4 times more than stems, 10 times more than roots. Almost no glucose was found in leaves. Green and yellow fruits have similar amounts of glucose. There is no significant difference of the glucose concentration between different sized green tomatoes, but the glucose content per tomato increases as the size increases. Insoluble acid invertase was found in all plant parts with yellow fruits showing the greatest activity,12 times more than green fruits. This indicates that it has potentially important roles in the ripe fruits. Soluble acid invertase activity was found mainly in leaves and yellow fruits. Soluble alkaline invertase activity was generally low and found mainly in leaves. There is no significant difference in all enzyme activity among different sized green fruits. Insoluble acid invertase is unlikely involved in the development of unripe fruits since its activity is constant among them. When comparing glucose level and invertase activity, roots and stems have low glucose and also low enzyme activity; leaves have very low glucose but medium enzyme activity; green fruits have high glucose but medium enzyme activity; yellow fruits have both high glucose and enzyme activity. Glucose content should be the net result between the production and consumption of glucose, so there is no direct correlation between the net glucose content and the invertase activity.

TRIFORINE SENSITIVITY IN LETTUCE, YEAR TWO
Aradhana Sinha
Salinas High School, Salinas, CA

The objective of this experiment is to more precisely define the location of the gene for triforine sensitivity (Tr) based on the segregation of alleles in the F4 filial of a cross between PI491224 and Iceberg. In addition I tested whether Tr is in the same or similar location in different accessions, and whether marker BAIS can be used to predict responses to triforine in different lettuces. <br><br> In the first phase, I developed a primer pair that amplifies an InDel on marker BAIS. PCR amplification and analysis of the BAIS marker segregation was used to find the location of Tr more precisely in the PI 491224 × Iceberg mapping population. Next, I grew different accessions of lettuce and determined whether they were sensitive to triforine by spraying them with a diluted triforine solution. Finally, I tested the primers developed in Phase 1 on these accessions to determine whether Tr is linked to BAIS in these cultivars, and if the BAIS marker can be used to predict reactions to triforine.<br><br> I am 90% confident that the true recombination rate between BAIS and Tr is between 0.87 and 14.57cM. Association mapping indicates a strong linkage between BAIS and Tr gene in all, but romaine cultivars. Alleles of BAIS can be used to predict reaction to the triforine in all but romaine cultivars. In addition, reaction to the triforine may be used as a marker to distinguish self-crossed offspring in breeding programs.

PHYTOREMEDIATION: A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF SELENIUM METABOLISM IN CONJUNCTION WITH ATP SULFURYLASE ACTIVITY IN ORGANIC AND TRANSGENIC CROPS YEAR III
Michelle Man-Si Chin
West Shore Junior/Senior High School, Melbourne, FL

Phytoremediation is an effective, inexpensive and non-intrusive means of in situ reduction and removal of environmental contaminants. Data from in vivo studies indicates high concentrations of selenium are carcinogenic, mutagenic and teratogenic to humans. The objective of this study is to examine the difference in selenium metabolism between organic and transgenic Glycine max (soybean). The researcher hypothesized that transgenic crops will phytoremediate selenium more effectively than organic crops due to genetic engineering.<br><br>The researcher extracted the DNA of organic and transgenic crops and utilized a thermal cycler to amplify the DNA samples. Bands were analyzed for genetic markers, 35S promoter sequence (35SP) and nopaline synthase terminator (NOST) via gel electrophoresis. The researcher conducted a protein assay (ATP Sulfurylase) and utilized spectrophotometry to quantify enzymatic activity, as measured by the pyrophosphate release. Results indicated a significantly higher organic enzymatic activity than that of transgenic soybeans. <br><br>Soybean plants in 100 µM and 200µM sodium selenite were grown for fourteen days (control plants received no selenite treatment). Excised leaves were quantified using ICP-MS according to the EPA 6020 protocol. Two-sample t-tests indicate that there is not statistically significant evidence that selenium accumulation of transgenic soybeans is greater than that of organic. Although the researcher’s hypothesis was not supported, she found a direct correlation between enzymatic activity and selenium accumulation; organic soybeans produced a higher enzymatic activity and accumulated more selenium than did transgenic soybeans. This suggests that an overexpression of ATP Sulfurylase or other enzymes involved in the selenium pathway would result in a greater amount of selenium accumulation.

AN EXAMINATION OF OKLAHOMA PLANT STOMATAL RESPONSE TO CHANGING ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS
Mishana Rachelle Ellison
Latta High School, Ada, OK

Plants and animals are affected by the environment and develop adaptations to enhance their survival. Within the city limits of Ada, Oklahoma is a cement producing plant which releases additional amounts of carbon dioxide. The purpose of this project was to examine whether increasing atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide have affected the development of stomata in leaves. <br><br> The null hypothesis was that there would be no differences in the mean numbers of leaf stomata throughout the 20th century and no differences would be found in the number of stomata in leaves from the Ada area versus outside of Ada and Pontotoc County. The research hypothesis was that plants from more recent years, where carbon dioxide levels have been higher, would have fewer stomata than leaves from older plants where less carbon dioxide was present in the atmosphere. It was also hypothesized that plants near Ada would have fewer stomata as a result of the higher CO2 emissions produced by the cement plant. <br><br> To conduct this investigation, leaf impressions were made of the upper and lower epidermis of dried leaf samples of Quercus, Ulmus, and Taraxacum housed in a local college’s herbarium. Photos of three regions from each upper and lower epidermis were taken with a digital microscope and the stomata were counted. The hypothesis was supported as data showed a slight decrease over time as carbon dioxide levels increased during the past century. However, little difference was found between the stomata means from leaves collected inside and outside Ada.

ELECTRIC ALGAE PROLIFERATION
Wayne Walter Vigil Jr
Grants High School, Grants, NM

Viable, alternative energy sources are important to the survival of our species. The benefit involved with finding new energy sources is to sustain our planet’s biomass; if we as a species can potentially utilize that biomass for energy then it benefits not only our species but the earth as a whole. The purpose of this project is to utilize photosynthetic algae as the basis of an organic photovoltaic cell prototype to see if energy production is feasible. The null hypothesis for this experiment is that the electricity produced will be insignificant, if at all. The algae were placed in Knop’s solution in 8.5x4x4cm cell culture flasks that were filled with 13mL of agarose gel made with the solution. Electrodes were then placed in the agar to conduct any electricity. The algae were then grown and readings were taken periodically. Once the algae reached a stage of proliferation the cells were producing a significant amount of voltage consistently. With the use of a designated cathode the electricity gathered increased 806%. This enabled the cells to be wired into a circuit to increase voltage. Once the cells reached that stage of growth the cells acted not only as a photovoltaic unit, but as a battery unit as well. Not only did the cells produce energy but they were self-sustaining units as well. This means the cells acted as an energy source and storage unit, vastly increasing its efficiency. This leads the research to usage in larger, industrial settings.

FRUIT HYBRIDS ASSOCIATED WITH POSITIVE EFFECTS TO HUMAN HEALTH
Petr Pokora
Gymnazium, Brno-Reckovice, Brno, Bohemia, CZECH REPUBLIC

Nowadays, insufficient fruit consumption is often indicated in the society. Moreover, the positive effects of fruit consumption decrease due to its lower genetic quality. Hence, number of people affected by various civilization diseases like heart attacks, cancer, diabetes or depressions increases.<br><br> <br><br>In this project, detailed analysis of 243 apricot hybrids is carried out to determine hybrids with maximum positive effects to human health. Motivation is to monitor quantity of antioxidants given by their activity in the apricot content. It was completed photometrically using different activity tests – DPPH, TEAC, FRAP, DMPD and the total polyphenolic compound test.<br><br> <br><br>Analyzed results were statistically processed via specifically designed method. Based on the latter, hybrids with the average maximum antioxidant activity were selected as those with maximum benefit to human health. Winning apricot hybrid, which maximizes benefit to human health, is the hybrid called Betty.<br><br> <br><br>General method, how to determine positive effects of fruit was proposed. By this way, it is possible to analyze another fruit species even by the application implemented in cell phones. It is based on sensing photos of the fruit bar code. Based on completed analysis outcome, the application determines the “health score” of selected fruit to search for an optimum healthy fruit hybrid. It helps to serve in prevention of civilization diseases with a potential to reduce cost needed for healthcare and diseases treating.

TRAMPLING SEAGRASS
Rebecca Marie Weible
James B. Castle High School, Kaneohe, HI

I wanted to do an experiment on trampling of seagrass so I could prove humans influence them. My hypotheses that human trampling uproots seagrass and recovery rate is slow were correct. My experiment entailed the setup of twelve lanes in a seagrass meadow and trampling on six of them. I used a quadrat to randomly count blade pair densities and percent cover three times within each lane. Two weeks after trampling fifteen times on each lane, I took counts again to see if the seagrass had recovered at all. I found that trampling affects seagrass greatly. Six weeks later the meadow had not recovered half way. While I was trampling, I could see many fragments of seagrass floating on the water from being uprooted. The reason I trampled fifteen times was because I once saw fifteen kayakers race to the beach where the experiment was conducted and I wanted the experiment to resemble a real life situation. Before the trampling, the percent cover for all treatment lanes were on average 94%, but after trampling it dropped to 50% cover. Even the blade pair densities significantly dropped. Before trampling treatment lanes were on average 1600 blade pairs, but after trampling the count went down to 524 pairs. The two weeks recovery count showed the percent covers remained the same and the blade pairs went up to 557 blade pairs for the treatment lanes. The harms of humans on seagrass, as well as on other creatures, are great.

EFFECTS OF DILUTION ON CARNIVOROUS PITCHER PLANT DIGESTIVE ENZYME CONCENTRATION
Garrett Kenneth Soiland
Jewett Academy, Petaluma, CA

The goal of the project was to determine whether carnivorous pitcher plants will respond to the dilution of the digestive fluid in their pitchers by producing extra digestive enzymes in order to maintain a certain concentration of those enzymes in their digestive fluid.<br><br>23 pitchers of Nepenthes ventricosa were covered with plastic bags before opening. Pitchers covered in October and whose digestive fluid was diluted with distilled water in December were termed “old” pitchers. The other group of pitchers was covered in December and diluted when they opened; these were the “new” pitchers. Controls measured normal enzyme levels in digestive fluid. Samples were taken immediately before and after dilution, and also at several day intervals after dilution for several weeks to track the rate at which plants secreted more digestive enzymes. <br><br>Data varied greatly but in general indicated that older pitchers did not react to dilution, but younger pitchers did secrete more enzymes after dilution. This also occurred in the young controls, indicating that the rise in enzyme levels following dilution was not a result of the dilution, but instead age. Younger pitchers might still have been in the process of secreting the enzymes they were to use throughout their lifetimes when dilution was carried out.<br><br>To test that explanation, the experiment was modified and conducted a second time. In this second stage of the project, only young pitchers were tested, more controls were designated, and greater precautions against prey contamination were taken, among other changes. Results from the second stage indicated that there was no continuous rise in enzyme levels in young pitchers, disproving the explanation for behavior of young pitchers in stage 1. However, diluted pitchers in stage 2 exhibited no significant rise in enzyme levels, in contrast to their behavior in stage 1. This could be explained by different plant behavior at different times of the year, stage 2 of the experiment not being long enough to observe a rise in enzyme levels, or the fact that in stage 2 all diluted pitchers were diluted by the complete replacement of their digestive fluid with distilled water, whereas in stage 1 almost all pitchers were diluted only by half. No matter the case, the original hypothesis is refuted by the preponderance of the data.

THE EFFECT OF DIFFERING RATIOS OF VERMICOMPOST TO SOIL ON THE NUTRIENT CONTENT OF LETTUCE (L. SATIVA)
Zachary Robert Nason
Briar Academy, Prairie Village, KS

As researchers investigate new ways to increase nutrient content in crops, a viable solution presents itself. When added to soil, compost (a mixture of dead plant matter accompanied by certain bacteria or worms) can be used to increase the nutrient content of the soil, which can then be utilized by the plant. This study looks at the effect of differing ratios of compost and soil on the nutrient content of lettuce, specifically P, Ca, and K. After a review of the literature, a hypothesis was formed. This hypothesis states that if lettuce plants are grown in differing ratios of compost to topsoil mixtures, which are three parts compost to one part topsoil (group A), one part compost to one part topsoil (group B), and one part compost to three parts topsoil (group C), then the plants grown in the one part compost to three parts topsoil mixture will have the greatest amount of P, Ca, and K. To carry out the experiment, 120 lettuce seeds were randomly assigned to four groups (including a control using 100% topsoil, referred to as group D). Eight growing chambers were constructed and filled with the appropriate ratio of compost to soil. Two chambers were used for each group. Half of each group (fifteen plants) was planted in each chamber. The plants were grown for six weeks, and then were tested for the aforementioned nutrients, using an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) test. <br><br>The data collected was statistically tested using a one-tailed Student’s t-test at a=0.05. This test showed that group C was only statistically higher than group D (control) for K (potassium). Thus the hypothesis was rejected, except for the control for K, where it was accepted.

HOW DO DROUGHT AND SALINITY AFFECT LEMON TREES IN SOUTH TEXAS?
Elizabeth Sigala
Weslaco High School, Weslaco, TX

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effects of drought and salt stress on lemon trees (Citrus limon) in south Texas during a drought. The hypothesis was that if lemon trees were exposed to drought and salinity stress, then decreased levels of physiological parameters, including chlorophyll content, photosynthesis, and stomatal conductance, would result. Three treatments were applied to two-year-old lemon trees: control, drought stress, and drought stress plus salinity. On four consecutive Saturdays, these physiological effects of drought and salinity were determined. At the end of the experiment, the plants were terminated and the dry weight of their leaves, stems, and roots was measured. To study the plants' tolerance levels, cell solute content was measured using an osmometer, and water potential was determined using a Scholander chamber. Drought stress negatively affected plant growth, whereas salt stress was not as detrimental to the lemon trees. Plants stressed by drought showed decreased levels of chlorophyll content, photosynthesis, and stomatal conductance compared to plants stressed by drought plus salinity, and to the control. Results indicated that lemon trees have an osmotic adjustment strategy that allows them to tolerate high salinity levels.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL SODIUM POLYACRYLATE SEED TREATMENT
Kira Elizabeth Powell
Odessa High School, Odessa, WA

Seed treatments have been traditionally used in a preventive capacity against pre-planting and early stage afflictions but now are being regarded as a tool to increase both the quantity and quality of yields. Previous research was done with a polymer, sodium polyacrylate, which showed potential as a soil additive. Sodium polyacrylate (C3H3NaO2)n is a mixture of sodium acrylate and acrylic acid. Commonly found in baby diapers and household cleaners, it can absorb up to 500 times its weight in water. Last year’s results indicated the addition of the sodium polyacrylate to the soil resulted in increased crop growth, at least a 20% increase in yield. An adhesive had to be developed to attach the sodium polyacrylate to the wheat kernel prior to planting. The experimental adhesive comprised of 53.1% water, 8.4% pectin (C6H10O7)n, 21.3% glycol (C3H8O3) and 17.3% 1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH). The average amount of sodium polyacrylate adhered to an individual kernel was 6.0 mg, the average amount of glue coating each seed was 11.0 mg and the average kernel mass was 38.0 mg. Since the results from this test were promising, the adhesive was used to adhere the chemical in specific applications, 2.5% and 5.0%. Wheat kernels were coated and then planted in a simulated drought environment and monitored for height and water retention. The preliminary results from the data collection indicated the plants coated with the seed treatment are growing along a similar trend compared to last year’s crop shown by the exponential trend curve.

LET'S GROW SOME TATERS
Christopher Abbott Carver
Blytheville High School, Blytheville, AR

Is water the best hydration for a plant? What about tea, or even an alcoholic drink? I think about alcohol’s benefits in cleansing wounds and killing bacteria. Also, how earlier American settlers drank alcohol instead of water, for the alcohol would not have bacteria. Could the alcohol play a positive role in the growth of the plants by limiting any outside bacteria that may affect the growth? <br><br>I began by planting potato slices with a minimum of 3 eyes in pots filled with fertilized potting soil. A total of 12 pots were planted as I would use 3 for each of the 4 liquids used in the project. The liquids I chose were wine, beer, water and tea. <br><br>Once all the potatoes were planted and hydrated, an electric grow light was used to ensure enough light was present for growth. I had concerns as this project was done in the winter.<br><br>Each week ¼ cup of liquid was added to each plant and growth was measured. <br><br>While it took weeks for any growth to be seen, the plants with water were the first to show, followed by tea and beer. Plants with wine showed only an insignificant amount of growth. Further testing would be needed to determine if the alcohol content, wine vs. beer, played a role in the growth of the plants.<br><br>The conclusion is that hydrating plants with any liquid containing alcohol does not enhance the growth of the plant.

RICE FOR RIPENING
Han Ngoc Bui
Dutchtown High School, Hampton, GA

As the killer frost creeps near, the vines still hold tomatoes of a stubbornly green color. These tomatoes must be taken inside for warmth and ethylene to operate on. Otherwise, they are left outside to die, never reaching their red, ripe, and juicy stage. Many different factors take part in the fruit ripening process, but ethylene initially starts the process. Does rice enhance the power of ethylene? If fruits take too long to ripen, they will eventually spoil before being ready to eat. The purpose of this project was to see if rice accelerates the ripening process of tomatoes. The experiment was tested with mature green tomatoes in two groups- plastic containers and paper bags. The independent variable was the presence of rice. After ten days of experimentation, data was analyzed. The presence of rice caused tomatoes to ripen faster. Therefore, the results supported the hypothesis, which stated that the presence of rice will increase ripening rate. A second experiment was conducted to see if rice absorbs ethylene. The theory behind this was that by absorbing the gas, rice kept ethylene around the tomatoes, and therefore, caused the tomatoes to increase ethylene production and ripen faster. Yellow bananas were cut up and put in plastic bottles. Five bottles contained rice and five bottles did not contain rice. Balloons were placed above each bottle. After four days, data clearly showed that bottles without rice held balloons with more volume. In conclusion, rice absorbed ethylene.

EXTRACTION OF PROTEIN FROM MICROALGAE
Carolina Silva e Lopes
American School of Campinas, Campinas, Sao Paulo, BRASIL

Many studies conducted all over the world in the last fifth years are showing that microalgae can be the alternative to human and animal feed. This project will study two green, fresh water microalgae, obtained in the nature in the fresh water in the lakes and rivers of the Brazilian territory. Both species were selected and supplied by the Botanical Department of the University of Sao Carlos (UFSCAR), in the Sao Paulo state. The culture and growth of the microalgae were made in the laboratories of UFSCAR, following the cares, controls of handling and exposure of light to get the photosynthesis process. The whole process used 37 days. Nutrient solution named WC-Gillard and the CO2 bubbling to speed up the growth were also used. The growth of cells was measured by using accounting in microscope and Fuchs Rosental Chamber showing that the two species have different speed of growth (Chlorella is faster) and cell shapes. The extraction and determination of protein and lipids was made at Nucleo de Pesquisas Aplicadas Ltda (NPA) in Jabuticabal, Sao Paulo state. After the culturing and growth, the dry mass for both was 1,297 grams of Scenedesmus Ecornis and 1,124 of Chlorella Vulgaris. Results showed that Chlorella Vulgaris can produce up to 25% more protein than Scenedesmus Ecornis. Both produced more than 30% of their dry weight in proteins and lipids, that shows how these microalgae can be useful for human and animal feed. Due to lack of resources and timing it was not possible to produce animal feed mixture using protein from both microalgae studied. The size of the production of microalgae need to be much bigger than the one used in the laboratories for this study.

The effect of higher magnetic fields on photosynthesis is a research in the area of plants science and exobiology. The experiment consists in increasing the normal magnetic field of the earth using 3 coils that surround the plants in a star configuration (at 4 volts, 1 amp what makes a field of 0,3 mT), and measuring the amount of glucose in 500mg of leafs (Chaerophyllum procumbens) with same size and age, after 4 morning sun hours exposition near a window to determine the photosynthesis. For the measurement of photosynthetic activity exist methods that are too expensive or imprecise; one of those methods was used in the first part of the project and it didn’t work. However, it was successful when a diabetic glucometer was used to measure the photosynthesis directly from his final product: Glucose (this method does not appear in the literature). The measurement period lasts 12 weeks. Average values of glucose production of the plant in normal (terrestrial) and higher magnetic fields (60 times higher) were calculated to see changes. It was concluded that a higher magnetic field can decrease the photosynthetic activity of plants. It was also evidenced that the use of the glucometer is a magnificent facilitator to measure the photosynthesis precisely; this method could be an easy, accessible and cheap option for many people who want to research in the field of the photosynthesis.

UNDERSTANDING THE EVOLUTIONARY CONSEQUENCES OF GENETIC DUPLICATION AND DIVERGENCE: A FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE APETALA1/FRUITFULL HOMOLOGS IN PAPAVERACEAE
Amelia Lyn Clements
Ossining High School, Ossining, NY

The transcription factors APETALA1 and FRUITFULL are responsible for the specification of the floral meristem and the regulation of sepal, petal, and fruit development in the core eudicot model species Arabidopsis thaliana. Due to the duplication and divergence events that characterize the evolutionary history of these important regulatory proteins, the function of the AP1/FUL genes, called FUL-like, may not be conserved in the earlier diverging basal eudicots. In this study, Virus Induced Gene Silencing was used to assess the function of the FUL-like genes (EcFL1 and EcFL2) in Eschscholzia californica, a member of the economically important Papaveraceae family. In specimens in which the FUL-like genes were down-regulated, sepals were converted into bracts, the number of branches was significantly higher (p<0.05), and premature fruit rupture occurred, indicating that in this species, the FUL-like genes play a different role from their homologs in A. thaliana. In further, the FUL-like genes from seventeen species from the five Papaveraceae subfamilies were cloned, and phylogenetic analyses were conducted in order to identify points of genetic duplication and divergence. For most Papaveraceae species screened, multiple paralogs were identified; during phylogenetic analyses, one copy fell into the FUL1 clade and the other into the FUL2 clade, suggesting that a duplication event occurred prior to Papaveraceae diversification. The findings of this study have helped to clarify the evolutionary relationships between the AP1/FUL homologs, and can be used to elucidate the function of other Papaveraceae FUL-like proteins. These data can also be used in conjunction with practical artificial selection methods for application to the production of more desirable agricultural plants.

OPTIMIZING ALGAE GROWTH
MaryAnn Gloria Bulawa
Rome Free Academy, Rome, NY

My hypothesis was that the algae sample that if algae cells where exposed to periods of light of zero, six, twelve, and twenty-four hours, the samples that received twenty-four hours of light would result in the densest and fattiest alga. This is optimal for bio-fuel use, fertilizer, water purification, animal feed, and human food This would occur because of the fact that algae cells would have the ability to carry out photosynthesis for a longer amount of time. The glucose that the algae produces could then be transferred into lipids which is what is desired for the many uses alga can perform.<br><br> I created an apparatus that consisted of a cylinder rack that had ten two inch diameter holes cut through it. This is where I placed clear PVC pipe tubes that also consisted of a metal piece opening located on the bottom where a bubbler could be hooked up providing a source of carbon dioxide to the algae cells. Located in the center were to florescent full spectrum lights that where equidistant from all of the ten tubes. I could easily turn off the light to change the period of energy the algae samples received in a day and was able to keep all other outside variables controlled.<br><br> When setting up my experiment I placed 100cc of an algae sample into each of the tubes, with 10cc of algae growth serum, and 1 liter of spring water. I placed my system in a closet and performed each light period of the experiment for 15 days, and then repeated again. <br><br> When finishing I discovered that 18 hours in fact created the best algae sample for it,s many uses. After doing research I discovered this was because algae, like all photosynthetic plants, require a rest period where the cells can release special chemicals required for further growth and development.

DNA-BINDING PROTEIN IN XCV BACTERIA MANIPULATES PLANT BHLH GENE TO PROMOTE PATHOGEN GROWTH DURING INFECTION: A GENETIC STUDY
Moniyka Sachar
Irvington High School, Fremont, CA

Xanthomonas, the causal agent of Bacterial Spot Disease in plants, releases 30 effector proteins, including XopD, into the plant host cell during infection. This research is aimed at elucidating the genetic role of pathogen-released DNA-Binding protein XopD in promoting bacteria growth during tomato plant pathogenesis.<br><br> Initially, a DNA microarray assaying over 22,800 tomato plant genes was conducted to identify gene levels most affected by XopD. bHLH levels were unusually high, indicating that this gene may be critical in promoting the growth of Xanthomonas bacteria. Then, Arabidopsis model plants were engineered with the inserted bHLH gene using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and the floral dipping method. Both engineered and wildtype plants were inoculated with Xanthomonas and bacterial growth was recorded to determine the function of bHLH in pathogenesis. I observed that 70% more bacterial colonies grew in engineered plants than in wildtype plants. A 2-sample statistical T-test showed that 97.8% of the time, the higher bacteria colony counts in plants with bHLH compared to plants without bHLH was due to the effect of the gene alone. <br><br> The results conclude that XopD protein promotes pathogen growth by stimulating the overexpression of a critical bHLH gene in tomato plants. In the future, scientists can engineer plants without the bHLH gene to develop resistant crop varieties. There are currently no effective bactericides or agricultural practices to control Bacterial Spot Disease, a disease which costs the U.S. 480 million dollars per year – a number that can easily decrease if such transgenic resistant crop varieties are successful.

AEROPONICS VS. SOIL-BASED GROWING
Luke Henry Beaulieu
Taunton High School, Taunton, MA

The purpose of this experiment was to discover whether aeroponicly grown lettuce, Lactuca sativa, would grow better than traditionally grown, soil-based lettuce. The aeroponic method of agriculture was pioneered by an undisclosed group of scientists and government agencies during the early 1980’s. In Aeroponics the plant roots are suspended in an enclosed container, and the roots are misted with a nutrient solution. In this experiment a ten gallon fish tank was used.<br><br> Results from this study showed that most soil based plants sprouted the fifth day or later, with the exception of a few soil based plants that sprouted the second and third day. The tallest aeroponic plant was forty-one centimeters (cm) tall, and the shortest plant was twenty-six cm tall. The tallest soil-based plant was thirty-two cm tall and the shortest was eleven cm. In comparison, most aeroponic plants sprouted on the fourth day which is sooner than their soil-based counterparts. The aeroponic plants were, on average, ten cm taller than the soil-based plants. The aeroponic plants also were more consistent in size. For example, the range of the aeroponically grown plants for trial one was fifteen cm. In comparison, the range of the traditionally grown plants was twenty-one cm. This difference was attributed to the inconsistency in the minerals available to the plant because the nutrients were not constantly mixing.<br><br> In conclusion, the hypothesis that aeroponicly grown plants, if put in the same growing environment as traditionally grown plants, will grow faster has been supported by the data.

THE USE OF MOUNTAIN MICROORGANISMS AS BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF DOWNY MILDEW (PERONOSPORA SP.) IN PUMPKIN CROPS (CUCURBITA MAXIMA)
Maria Alexandra Obando-Garita
Colegio Tecnico Profesional de Pacayas, Cartago, COSTA RICA

The Mildew fungus represents a big problem for local farmers, causing decreased production and increased expenditures in fungicides. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Mountain Microorganisms (MM) as biological control in the reduction of the incidence and severity of the Mildew fungus in pumpkin plants.<br><br>An experiment with two procedures - Control and Treatment - was carried out to determine the effectiveness of the microorganisms. The Treatment consisted of assessing the inoculation of experimental plants with the plant pathogen Peronospora sp. in order to ensure the presence of the disease. Plants were treated with equal doses of MM five to seven days after being infected. The evaluation was based on qualitative parameters by applying an instrumental scale.<br><br>On the third and fourth evaluation by observation, a reduction of 75% was determined in the severity of the fungi on the treated plants as well as a reduction in the level of incidence. In conclusion, MM fight fungi reducing them, both in the number of plants affected as in the amount of foliar area covered. Through a laboratory, quality analysis performed on the studied microorganisms the results show that there is a suppression effect of the fungus with the application of MM since they induce systemic resistance in the plant.<br><br>The MM could become an option in the field of biological control or bio-protection, to reduce production costs and soil contamination by chemicals, for the farmers in the region.<br><br>

FEASIBILITY OF CREATING QUALITY SILAGE IN SMALL QUANTITIES
Ruth Hazel Johnston
Tillamook High School, Tillamook, OR

In many third-world countries with growing populations, such as Rwanda, grazing is restricted. A typical farm may be half a hectare (about 1.24 acres) in size and committed to growing crops for human consumption. Currently some farmers harvest small quantities of grass on a daily basis to feed livestock. Cows are often malnourished and slow growing during the dry season and well-fed during the wet season. If farmers were to begin creating silage from their grass cuttings, it would allow their livestock access to nutritious feed year round. They would also be able to store enough feed for the dry season when no grass grows. <br><br>Through my research I produced high quality feed in small quantities. When compared to silage made with machinery on a large scale, the small batch silage tested as high or higher in nutrient value. <br><br>My research showed that high quality silage can be produced in small quantities. My process would allow the backyard farmer in the U.S. to feasibly raise an animal. It also is a possible method to use in third world countries such as Rwanda where there's no machinery to process hay and no feed available during the dry season.

TESTING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EIGHT DIFFERENT BOTANICAL EXTRACTS AS REPELLENTS AGAINST AMBLYOMMA AMERICANNUM, THE LONE STAR TICK
Sara Lynn Nix
Grove High School, Grove, OK

The purpose of this project is to find a botanical that can effectively repel the lone star tick. The flowers and leaves of four different plants were tested along side three commercial products. Marigold, lantana, daisy and chrysanthemum were the botanicals used. <br><br> With supporting research it was hypothesized that the daisy leaves would be the most effective of the botanical in repelling the ticks.<br><br> Extractions were made using a blender, distilled water, an incubator and a centrifuge. Blotting paper was then soaked in the solutions and dried. The paper was then taped to the top, sides and bottom of a Petri dish with a grid on the bottom. Five ticks were then placed into the Petri dish and sealed. The lateral movement of ticks from the strip was observed and recorded at different time intervals. Data was collected, line graphs were created showing tick movement over time and the data was statistically analyzed using a one-way ANOVA to compare all botanical groups. Then a two-way ANOVA was done comparing the repellent properties of flowers verses leaves.<br><br> The hypothesis was accepted. The daisy leaves were the most effective botanical at repelling the ticks. Overall flowers were more repellent then the leaves. Only the daisy flowers and leaves were comparable to the commercial repellents. The commercial products used contained DEET at 25%, Picaridin at 10% and Picaridin at 20%. A notable observation was that DEET and Picaridin at 20% were both fatal to the ticks.

MENDEL'S LENTILS: IDENTIFICATION AND ANALYSIS OF THE ZERO-TANNIN GENE IN LENTIL
Rui Song
Walter Murray Collegiate Institute, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, CANADA

Lentils are an important global pulse crop, known especially for their high protein content. However, the condensed tannins (CT) responsible for seed coat pigmentation also bind to proteins. A ‘zero-tannin’ (ZT) lentil variety with clear seed coats is available and may be less anti-nutritional. But, it is also susceptible to disease and has poor yield, possibly due to its lack of CT which is associated with disease resistance. This susceptibility has severely limited the seed’s commercial potential. The answer to improving ZT lentil lies in its more resistant relative; the commercial clear-seeded pea. This project analyzed the ZT lentil gene and determined differences in gene expression in the polyphenolic biosynthetic pathway between ZT and pigmented pea and lentil. First, primers were designed around single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the lentil homologue of the pea A-gene and used to screen a lentil line segregating for the ZT trait with KASP SNP genotyping. Secondly, gene expression levels downstream of the A-gene were evaluated in tissues from ZT and pigmented lentils and peas using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The SNP primer seemed to segregate for the ZT trait in the lentil line, increasing the likelihood that the same gene controls lentil and pea ZT traits. The gene expression studies suggest lentil and pea differ, particularly for leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase and Banyuls expression in pods, roots and seeds. A genetic understanding of the ZT trait will help improve ZT lentil, providing producers with new markets and consumers with more nutritional benefits.

PROBING THE ROLE OF NUTRIENT ACTIVITY IN MAGNETICALLY INDUCED PLANT GROWTH
Lilia Tchavdarova Popova
Ann Arbor-Huron High School, Ann Arbor, MI

Magnetism is one of the many factors shown to elicit changes in plant growth. There has been no conclusive evidence why or how magnetic fields affect plants. Static magnetic fields are a form of extremely low frequency non-ionizing radiation. This project developed and tested a theory of why magnetic fields induce changes in plant growth. The experiment used control groups to compare variations in data presented under magnetic fields of varying strengths with and without the addition of fertilizer. Three trials were done with a total sample size of 360 seeds. Magnetic field strength was measured with a gauss meter made using a hall probe and voltmeter. The traits examined in this morphometric analysis included plant, root, and shoot length, fresh and dry mass, germination period, rate of growth, yield, and morbidity. Soil analysis (NPK and pH) was done before and after experimentation to show changes in nutrient availability and concentration. It was found that plants of the medium magnetic field (500 Gauss) had the highest rates of growth of the control groups while plants of the low magnetic field (250 Gauss) and fertilizer had the best growth rates of the experimental groups. Growth was inhibited by the high magnetic field control (1000 Gauss) and by both the medium and high magnetic fields with fertilizer (experimental groups). This data, combined with soil analysis results, supported the theory presented that static magnetic fields result in increased nutrient absorption in plants. This information has many applications in the development of sustainable agriculture, advancement of horticulture, understanding the effects of changes in Earth's magnetic field (geomagnetic storms, magnetic reversals, etc.), and plant (Corn, Soybean) and algae biofuel production.

CONVENTIONAL VS. AQUAPONICS VS. HYDROPONICS (A THIRD YEAR STUDY)
Taylor Lorraine Kennedy
Keystone Heights High School, Keystone Heights, FL

The title of this project is conventional versus aquaponics versus hydroponics. The purpose of this project is to compare conventional plant growing methods to the aquaponics and hydroponics methods. THis will be tested over an eight week period, along with the conventional method being watered everyday using Miracle Grow. And the hydroponics method will receive fish food everday to feed the fish, and the pH will also be tested weekly to maintain a clean and healthy environment for the fish. Overall there are many aspects to the aquaponics system. The two cycles that keep the system running are photosynthesis and the nitrogen cycle. It is also imperative to keep the pH maintained.

EFFECT OF PRIMARY LIGHT ON PHOTOSYNTHETIC PIGMENTS, ABSORPTION, AND REPRODUCTION OF ANABAENA, AFTER BEING RETURNED TO WHITE LIGHT FOR MULTIPLE GENERATIONS
Jacob Norman Pardee
Carter County High School, Ekalaka, MT

Phototrophs absorb limited ranges of light, making them less efficient than is theoretically possible. If these organisms adapted to utilize a larger light range, they may become more successful.<br><br>Anabaena were placed in one of three primary light colors for one week. Then, half of the Anabaena were removed and placed in white light (modified treatment group) for one week. The modified treatment group should have increased growth, reproductive success and absorption of light.<br><br>The Anabaena from the light treatment groups were analyzed to determine reproductive success and absorption of the three primary light waves. Reproductive success was significantly different (p< 0.001). The absorption of the three primary light colors was also different (p< 0.001). A post hoc Tukey HSD test showed that the modified green/white treatment group was significantly better than all but a few treatment groups in light absorption and reproduction. Both of these supported the hypothesis that the light treatment group would have an impact on the overall success of Anabaena.<br><br>The results of this experiment show that, over generations, green light treatment is an effective means of increasing performance of phototrophs through artificial selection, especially after placing the organisms back into a control environment, white light.

ALGAE BIODIESEL

Engines can run on Algae biodiesel instead of diesel or gasoline. Algae can also be used to produce environmentally friendly fuel, since they reduce pollution. During the photosynthesis process algae eat nutrients and carbon dioxide, and produce oxygen. Algae are a renewable source of energy, because algae can be re-grown. In addition, they do not compete with food crops like corn based fuel. Due to my interest in renewable energy, I decided to prove that algae could be used for fuel production and that algae can get all needed nutrients for their growth from urine. I grew algae in three different media (Urine, Nitrogen with Phosphate; and Nitrogen without Phosphate). I showed that algae grew better in Urine media than in the other two due to urine being high in nutrients needed for algae growth. In addition, I sampled equal amounts of algae from each media, then I dried the algae samples, crushed them into a powder, and extracted oil from each powder sample by the use of Methanol, Sulfuric Acid, and Hexane. Then I converted the algae oil samples to biodiesel. I tested each of the samples for biodiesel properties in a Gas Chromatograph and proved that they met biodiesel standards.

USE OF CYANOBACTERIA AS AN ALTERNATIVE NITRATE SOURCE IN THE HYDROPONIC GROWTH OF ZEA MAYS V. INDENTATA
Mary Margaret Penniman
Woodstock High School, Woodstock, GA

This research project focuses on using four different species of cyanobacteria as an alternative nitrogenous fertilizer in commercial hydroponic systems. The researcher’s hypothesis is: if cyanobacterial species are used as alternative nitrate sources in hydroponic systems, then one will prove to be the best alternative to the leading commercial hydroponic fertilizer. This was tested by growing Z. mays in these cultures, and then comparing the growth rates. Eight plants were in each box, and each species had two boxes for a total of 16 plants per cyanobacteria treatment. A control box of pure distilled water and a Miracle-Gro© box were also set up. The nitrate levels, turbidity levels, and individual plant heights were recorded each day for fourteen days. Based upon average growth, the results from ANOVA, and two sample T-tests it was concluded that two species of cyanobacteria, Gloeotrichia and Lyngbya, were statistically the same as Miracle-Gro©. Because the p-value was much higher in the t-test between Gloeotrichia and Miracle-Gro© (0.337) than in the t-test between Lyngbya and Miracle-Gro© (0.171), it can also be concluded that Gloeotrichia would be the better substitute, but they could both work. This data supports the conclusion that cyanobacteria could be used as alternatives to the leading nitrogenous fertilizer and also supports the hypothesis that one species would be seen to be the best.

SYNTHETIC WATER ABSORBING POLYMER FOR THE FUTURE OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE: USE OF HYDROPHILIC POLYMER (SODIUM POLY-ACRYLATE) TO IMPROVE WATER RETENTION OF SOIL AND SAND AND IMPROVE PLANT GROWTH UNDER VARIOUS IRRIGATION TREATMENTS 
Sachin Aggarwal
Lake Central High School, St John, IN

Sodium polyacrylate is a cross linked hydrophilic polymer than can hold water up to 1000 times its own dry weight. This water-loving polymer can be used as an additive to soil in water deficient (desert) areas to increase crop production and decrease watering frequency. The ability of sodium polyacrylate to hold water in soil, its effect on plant length, maturity, and water deficit stress was compared for barley plants grown in soil only (control) and barley plants grown in soil mixed with sodium polyacrylate (variable).<br><br>After the untreated barley plants were sown and watered on the first day of the experiment, they were assigned to one of the 4 irrigation treatment groups. The irrigation groups were: Daily, Every 3rd day, Every 7th day, and once at the beginning of the experiment. The plants were only watered 5mL during each watering. Sand and Soil were the potting medias tested.<br><br>Result-There was a considerable increase in the water retention capacity of soil. On an overall comparison, the potting media with the “polymer” mixture in all of the irrigation treatment groups except for "daily" had statistically significantly positive effect on all the parameters of plant growth including plant length and the maturity Index. The addition of gel also significantly delayed any signs of water deficit stress over the two weeks of the experiment. Maturity Index- in soil, most plants remained in stage 1 of development;in the group with added gel, most of the plants achieved the fully mature stage (stage 3). Water deficit stress index- a index based on signs of any water deficit stress; on a scale of 0-4. 0 indicated healthy plants, and 4 indicated severe signs of water deficit stress. the addition of the polymer significantly delayed water stress in the barley plants.

ROOT NUTRIENT FORAGING: A MORPHOMETRIC APPROACH TO QUANTIFYING THE DEVELOPMENTAL PLASTICITY SPACE OF ARABIDOPSIS ECOTYPES IN LABORATORY AND NATURAL ENVIRONMENTS
Huihui Fan
Stuyvesant High School, New York City, NY

The root systems of plants are highly plastic in their development and can initiate lateral meristems postembryonically. This developmental plasticity enables plants to explore the soil in response to changing nutrient environments, correcting for their sessile nature. Through an integrated study of response to external nitrogen signals (nitrate) and internal hormone signals of auxin and cytokinin, the natural variation across Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes was explored to discover the genes that underlie root phenotypic plasticity using a Systems Biology approach. The natural variation in root architecture was quantified comparatively using a Morphometric Analysis software program (AAM Toolbox) combined with Principle Component Analysis (PCA), allowing for the contextualization of such studies with natural soil nitrogen concentrations. Genes underlying plastic response to nitrogen and auxin were discovered using a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). The candidate genes were analyzed through Gene Block template matching, gene expression correlation, and gene-list intersection analysis performed using the Virtual Plant (www.virtualplant.org) software platform. Such work reveals the gene SUR1-like to be a key player in the natural variation of root plasticity, which may be a potential target for modification for the creation of transgenic crop plants. These plants would be able to recreate fertile soil phenotypes in nutrient-deficient environments, which has implications for the development of sustainable agriculture. The generalized approach to genetic identification also has larger applications to a variety of other problems in agronomy.

DETERMINING NATURAL TISSUE DEVELOPMENT OF EDIBLE PLANTS USING ELECTRICAL IMPEDANCE MEASUREMENTS
Sarah Mohamed Marie
Altarbiah Alislamiah School, Riyadh, Central, SAUDI ARABIA

Currently, many farmers in the world use chemical hormones and incentives to simulate their crop growth and provide additional attractiveness. In 1998, 5 to 6% of plant species contained a high amount of chemical incentives and in 2010, 200 new diseases were discovered that related to plants containing these problematic elements. The current research is aimed at eliminating this harmful growth method by using another non-invasive alternative process called the Cole-Cole model, as this electrical circuit is optimal for representing plants' tissue. Output voltage was measured for 15 natural growth specimens, and then used in solving fractional calculus equations to determine the resistance and capacitance values for each specimen. Then, the recoded results of 15 simulated growth specimens was examined to test the effect of using both methods on the crops. In the simulated growth case, the electrical elements values were decreased by 34.8%. These results were compared to another 15 specimens, which were infected by a nematode virus. Both the virus and hormone hold the same effect on the tissue and the values in the infected viral case decreased by 42.8%, which is similar in nature to the simulated case. By applying this experiment, all farmers can supply healthy food to the world, because they will be able to differentiate between the natural growth and the simulated growth fruits and vegetables. Farmers will also be able to diagnose crop diseases prior to symptom onset and control them rapidly and effectively.

GENETIC ENGINEERING: A POTENTIAL PROTECTION FOR ALLELOPATHY CREATED BY THE GIANT RAGWEED
Jenna Christine Jordan
Northwestern High School, Kokomo, IN

The purpose is to determine if genetically modified organisms (GMO) can affect the allelopathic effects in giant ragweed. The hypothesis is if the crops are genetically modified, then they will be resistant to the allelopathic effects of giant ragweed. There were three groups of experimental data. In group A, the giant ragweed was added to the soil at the same time the soybeans were planted. In group B, the giant ragweed was added five days after the soybeans were planted. In group C, the giant ragweed was added ten days after the soybeans were planted. The control soybean plants were a healthy darker green; the variable non GMO soybean plants were lighter green. Leaves withered, died, and fell off on the non GMO variable soybeans; the ragweed grew twice as fast in the non GMO variable pots. Almost 83 % of the data in group B2 was highly significant (t=7.73 > t.05 =2.306). Approximately 64% of the data in group A2 was significant (t=2.97> t.05 =2.306). Nearly 9% of the data in group C2 was significant (t=7.73> t.05 =2.306). These significant results support the hypothesis.

OXYGEN PRODUCTION OF GREEN AND BROWN SEAWEEDS ASCOPHYLLUM NODOSUM AND FUCUS VESICULOSUS UNDER DIFFERENT COLORED LIGHT
Meagan Elizabeth Currie
Greely High School, Cumberland, ME

The demand for seaweed is increasing globally, and species are being used for an array of purposes. These experiments tested whether two differently pigmented seaweed species (Ascophyllum nodosum and Fucus vesiculosus) differed photosynthetically under different light wavelengths. Light wavelengths (colors) filter out at different depths underwater. By testing two differently pigmented seaweeds under different light colors, one could determine how the different pigments affect photosynthesis at different depths. <br><br>Because oxygen is a byproduct of photosynthesis, the dissolved oxygen in 350 mL of water was measured with a Vernier oxygen probe every two hours per six hour trial. The seaweeds were tested under white, red, green, and violet light.<br><br> After running five trials of both green (Ascophyllum nodosum ) and brown (Fucus vesiculosus) seaweeds, the average dissolved oxygen levels were determined. Once the trials were averaged, it was concluded that the plants photosynthesize differently under each light color. Ascophyllum nodosum, on average, photosynthesized most efficiently in all but green light. However, after dividing the oxygen levels by the plant’s mass to find dissolved oxygen per gram, the brown proved more efficient. A t-test showed that the difference between each seaweed’s average oxygen production under each color was significant. The probability that the two would be subsets of one another were 0.23 (violet light), 0.01 (white light) and 0.00 (red, and green light).<br><br> The affect of pigment on photosynthesis, as well as the link between light color and water depth, can help people understand how depth affects photosynthesis of differently pigmented seaweeds.

UTILIZING ASSORTED MONOSACCHARIDES FROM FOLIAR APPLICATION FOR GLYCOSIDE LINKAGE TO ENHANCE TRITICUM AESTIVUM YIELDS
Jordan Ray Cadle
Paoli Junior/Senior High School, Paoli, IN

This project explores an organically friendly way to help lower the rates of world hunger by the use of substances rather easily located by farmers in third world countries. The supreme concept uses a possible way of increasing wheat yields by the use of simple sugars applied by foliar application. The use of galactose and fructose were applied on the wheat at weak and strong concentrations during the reproductive stages three times. These applications were spaced two weeks apart in a randomized Latin square plot. These sugars are then used in glycoside linkage for conversion into complex starches in the seed. The increase in starches formed equaled the increase in yield in terms of volume and test weight. The strong milk application and weak applications of milk, honey, and corn syrup were statistically significant over the control with an average increase of 6.47%. Based on the world’s predicted wheat yield for the 2012 growing year, this would provide enough protein for an additional 643,236,507 people to consume 600 calories a day for a year. <br><br>From this test, farmers can lower world hunger by applying simple sugars by foliar means to increase wheat yields. However, along with the increase of yields comes a higher input cost, but the products are accessible in underdeveloped and emerging nations. The strong application of galactose and weak applications of both galactose and fructose were the best suited solutions to this current global issue.

THE EFFECTS OF THE ASTER FAMILY ON SUGAR BEET PRODUCTION
Grady Adam Mauch
Hankinson High School, Hankinson, ND

PURPOSE: To compare the pesticidal effects of natural extracts, obtained from weed flowers, against known farm pesticides that are associated with sugar beets. <br><br>PROCEDURES: Collected two different types of weed flowers (Missouri Goldenrod and Perennial Sowthistle) and two chemicals. Prepared 20:1 dilutions of natural products and used field application rates for the pesticides. TEST PLOT STUDY: Sugar Beet Test Plot: Planted four replications of the two sugar beet cultivars in a total of 40, 10-foot rows in length. Apply 2000 mLs of one of the treatments per row after 4 weeks. Allowed a four month growing period then harvested the sugar beets by hand and calculated the tons per acre and percent sugar. KIRBY BAUER: Tested the inhibitory properties of natural and commercial fungicides on the growth of two sugar beet fungal pathogens and two beneficial bacteria found in soil. INSECT DROP METHOD: Used actual contact of the extracts on Black Cutworms and Fall Armyworms to determine their fatality rate. pH: Determined the acidic or basic reading of each natural product and pesticide. CONCLUSION: In the Test Plot Study, I found that the sugar beets applied with Missouri Goldenrod yielded the highest tons per acre. In the Sugar Content test, I found that sugar beets sprayed with Perennial Sowthistle had the highest percentage of sugar. From Kirby Bauer, Missouri Goldenrod inhibited the growth of pathogenic fungi the best. In the Beneficial Bacteria Study, I found that Perennial Sowthistle had the smallest inhibition zone. From the Insect Drop Method, Asana XL had the fastest fatality rate on insects. Overall, I feel that natural products do show the potential to be a major asset to the sugar beet industry.

IMPACT OF ALLELIC DIVERSITY OF WX AND ALK GENES ON THE NUTRITIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF RICE AND THE EVALUATION OF RICE STARCH BIOSYNTHESIS IN THE HYBRID Y58S MALE STERILE BREEDING LINE
Pavane Lakshmi Gorrepati
Rivermont Collegiate, Bettendorf, IA

Rice (Oryza sativa) is the world’s most important cereal crop for human consumption. Hybrid rice, characterized by high yield, has made great contributions to safeguarding food security around the world. However, hybrid rice shows poorer grain quality in comparison to conventional rice. With the development of improved living standards of people all around the world, a better understanding is needed of the factors that contribute to the grain quality and nutrition of hybrid rice. In this study, a molecular marker-based genetic analysis looked at the three main determinants of rice eating and cooking quality (ECQ) – amylose content (AC), gel consistency (GC) and gelatinization temperature (GT) – in conjunction with allelic variants of two genes, Wx and ALK, known to play a role in ECQ. The outcome confirms that the AC is controlled mainly by Wx locus, and also indicates that GC is controlled by Wx gene or by one locus tightly linked to this gene. Similarly, the ALK locus was shown to play a major role in regulating GT. I also reported the successful introgression of the elite Wx gene into the key male sterile line, Y58S. The improved line should immediately improve nutritional status for countries around the world.

DOES THE AMOUNT OF CHLORINE IN WATER AFFECT THE RATE OF GRASSES COMMONLY GROWN IN FLORIDA SEED GERMINATIONS? (YEAR THREE)
Milli Lynne Jones
Hardee Senior High School, Wauchula, FL

This project is an example of the relationship between chlorinated water and its effect on seed germination. The formulated hypothesis is that the chlorinated water will affect the seed germinations. At three different times, three different grasses were grown with the same percentage variations and with the same variables. Ten petri dishes of each percentage ranging from 0.01% to 0.10% chlorine were added to distilled water as the test. For each seed variety there were ten additional samples using the same procedure with no chlorine added as a control. Seed samples were kept in a dark drawer to maintain consistency. Daily observation of the seed was evaluated and data collected from each sample. The data from this experiment shows that on average 62% of the Panicum miliacium seeds germinated without chlorine, 54% of the Cynodon dactylon germinated without chlorine, while 76% of the Lolium multiflorum seeds germinated without chlorine. On average 23% of the Panicum miliacium seeds germinated with chlorine in the water, 11.2% of the Cynodon dactylon germinated with chlorine in the water, and an average of 84% of the Lolium multiflorum seeds germinated with the chlorinated water. Based on the data from this experiment, the hypothesis was accepted showing that chlorine does have an effect on seed germination rate.<br><br>

NOVEL GENES AND MUTATIONS IN ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA
Ashley Marie Bianco
River Springs Charter School, Temecula, CA

In contribution to its evolutionary success, angiosperms have obtained tightly regulated floral determinacy to ensure proper floral organ development. Within the floral meristems of Arabidopsis thaliana, there are two genes, AGAMOUS (AG) and WUSCHEL (WUS), that terminate stem cell production after the correct number of floral organs are produced. However, additional unidentified genes are likely involved due to the complexity of floral determination. Using a weak allele of AG, I screened for mutants that enhanced the floral indeterminacy phenotype. From this mutagenesis screen a mutant was identified, AB125. Here a genetic analysis of this mutant, which exhibits an enhanced indeterminacy phenotype, indicative of a mis-regulation of floral stem cells, reveals that AB125 is a stronger PINHEAD allele due to a second linked mutation generated in the EMS mutagenesis. In this project, I will study the relationship between AB125 and known players involved in floral determinacy as well as understanding the functionality and characterization of the novel mutation itself and in the pathway between AGAMOUS and WUSCHEL. Furthermore, mutant plants will be screened to look for additional players involved in floral determinacy.

HPLC EXTRACTION OF NONI (MORINDA CITRIFOLIA) COMPOUNDS AND ITS INHIBITION OF E. COLI
Peter Huang Leng
Father Duenas Memorial School, Chalan Pago, Guam, GUAM

Noni Juice (Morinda citrifolia) has been used as a traditional folk medicine for over 2000 years by the islanders of the Western Pacific. This study evaluates traditional Chamorro (native Guamanians) juice preparations in treating E.Coli infections and attempts to identify and purify these anti-bacterial compounds using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Noni juice was prepared by freeze-thawing and filtering the resulting liquid, and then tested for the ability to inhibit the growth of non-pathogenic E.Coli (ATCC-2252) under different local preparation methods (boiling, filtration, and storage conditions) and concentrations using a high-throughput 96-well plate spectrophotometirc assay. The results show that noni juice, when boiled as the locals do, is most effective against bacteria. Furthermore, sonication, as well as removing sediments via centrifugation and/or commensal bacteria via .22um filtration do little to change efficacy of Guam juice. However, when the juice is removed and only the centrifugation pellet is tested, the noni juice fails to show signs of growth inhibition, suggesting that the inhibitory compound can be found within the juice itself, rather than residing in commensal bacteria. Comparisons of HPLC traces from manipulations suggest that boiling causes chemical changes in the juice that shift both retention times and peak abundances, suggesting that boiling is an important step in the efficacy of Chamorro noni juice remedies.

BORON UPTAKE IN BIRCHES
Katerina Rodiouchkina
Lulea Gymnasieskola, Lulea, SWEDEN

Boron (B) is a micronutrient in plants that is essential for plants growth but in high concentrations it becomes toxic to the plants. Soils in many areas of the world are suffering from B deficiency requiring addition of B in order to improve harvests. Optimized fertilization relies upon knowledge on dynamic of B uptake by plants which is relatively scarce. The purpose of this study was to gain better understanding of the B uptake process. This was achieved by in situ isotope spike experiment using enriched boron (>97% 10B) solution mixed with rhenium (Re, rare element non-essential for plant development) added to four different birches in the beginning of leaf growing season. <br><br>With two week intervals during period from May to September leaf samples were taken from the four spiked birches and a reference birch and concentrations of B and Re as well as B isotopic composition was measured by mass spectrometry. The use of isotope-labeled B allows assessment of B accumulation dynamic in birch leaves and comparison of those of non-essential element. This information combined with leave’s biomass data aids evaluation of spike uptake efficiency for B and Re and therefore optimization of B fertilization.

THE FUNGICIDAL EFFECTS OF THE FRUIT EXTRACTS OF THE INDIAN MULBERRY, MORINDA CITRIFOLIA (NONU), ON THE PLANT PATHOGENS LASIODIPLODIA THEOBROMAE AND PESTALOTIOPSIS SP.
Mee Jin Park
Pacific Horizons School, Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA

The Indian mulberry, Morinda citrifolia, also known as nonu in American Samoa, is a shrub or small tree that is common in several habitats of the American Samoa Island. The nonu plant is probably the most popular of all the medicinal plants in the Samoan culture. The fruit extracts, in particular, are credited of having some therapeutic properties in the treatment of such serious diseases as cancer. However, these extracts have not yet been tested for fungicidal activity against plant pathogenic fungi. In order to find an eco-friendly, biological alternative to pesticides, an experiment was conducted to determine whether fruit extracts of M. citrifolia could be used as a fungicide against the plant pathogens Lasiodiplodia theobromae and Pestalotiopsis sp. The results showed that the extracts had no fungicidal activity on the two fungi. Instead, the growth of both fungi was stimulated in the presence of the extracts, suggesting the nonu plant could well be a good host for these pathogens. Additional studies are needed to investigate the antimicrobial effects of the fruit extracts of M. citrifolia on other plant and animal pathogens.

THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT SOURCES OF LIGHT ON FERN
Luis Angel Ramos
Colegio Radians, Cayey, PUERTO RICO

Can different types of light sources produce the same or similar effect of sunlight on the transpiration process of fern? The hypothesis stated that different sources of light would not be able to imitate the effects of sunlight on the transpiration process of fern. To prove the hypothesis, ¼ of a cup of water was added to 12 fern plants while two gallon bottles were cut in half. After each plant was placed in the bottom part of the bottle, another gallon’s bottom part was used to seal the top with tape. Then each fern was labeled with their corresponding light source: Ultraviolet Light, Yellow Light, White Light, and Sunlight. Afterwards, the plants were exposed to the light sources for a period of 24 hours, while the weight of a sheet of paper towel was calculated with a triple beam balance, which weighted 2g. Next, each plant’s top was removed, and with a paper towel sheet, the transpired water was collected in all plants and weighted once more, and by subtracting the mass of the sheet, the mass of the transpired water was obtained. Sunlight presented the highest amount of water transpired with 4.3g, 5.1g and 3.8g, Ultraviolet Light, obtained 0.2g, 0.5g, and 0.3g of water. Yellow Light produced 1g, 0.8g, and 1.2g of water and finally, White Light transpired 0.6g, 0.7g, and 1.1g of water. Based on the obtained results, the hypothesis is accepted, since no light could imitate the effects of sunlight on fern plants. Understanding how organisms respond to environmental changes, it’s important for refining projections of changing atmospheric conditions, this way assuring the production of water for future use.

BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF DIFFUSE KNAPWEED: ANALYZING TWO NATURAL INSECT ENEMIES
Nakayla Anne Lestina
Dove Creek High School, Dove Creek, CO

My experiment was designed to answer 3 questions: which insect, the lesser knapweed flower weevil or the knapweed root weevil, would attack the most plants, would have the furthest spread, and would provide the best control.<br><br> I predicted that there would be no significant difference between the insects in the number of plants that they attacked, that the flower weevil would spread farther afield than the root weevil and that the root weevil would provide the best control. <br><br> After locating a large stand of Diffuse knapweed for the experiment I placed three enclosures and also set up two 105 foot intersecting transects in the stand. I released both insects into two of the enclosures and at the intersection of the two transects. At the end of the growing season I analyzed the plants in the enclosures and along the transects, recording how many plants were attacked by each insect, the extent of insect activity along the transects and plant mortality.<br><br> The two enclosures had a total of 54 plants in them. The flower weevil attacked 29.6% of all available plants and the root weevil accounted for 27.8%. As for the spread, there was no meaningful difference between the two insects. Even though the flower weevil attacked the most plants it caused no plant mortality, however, damage from the root weevil lead to more plant mortality due to internal mining of the root.

PRESENCE OF LUCIFERASE IN GRASS PROLONGS PHOTOSYNTHESIS PROCESS
Muhammad Danial Bin Ahmad Helmi
Maktab Rendah Sains MARA Beseri, Perlis, MALAYSIA

Presence of luciferase in grass prolongs photosynthesis process is a project of conserving mother nature. It is a project that uses an extracted gene which is “luciferase gene” that comes from a firefly. To get the gene extracted, first we must undergo DNA extraction [Miller et 1988] .The DNA is then tested by using electrophoresis technique using marker size 10 bp. Gene is then purified and isolated to get a clean strand of DNA. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) which can create million copies of a single gene or any specific of DNA in mini PCR is done. PCR technique does not replace gene cloning, which is still used whenever a large quantity of gene or protein is needed. Hence, the DNA extracted from 11 fireflies produces and amount of 5 microliter of the DNA. The PCR process produces approximately 0.5 milliliter of luciferase gene with the size of 3412 bp that had been extracted from 11 fireflies. After the gene undergoes PCR process, to insert the DNA, a proper technique is used which is tissue culturing using propagation technique. After the specimen is inserted fully, the grass is let out under the sun. The average photo intensity recorded using Lux Meter is 1.06(lx). At night, the grass will glow and will undergo a low rate of photosynthesis using the presence. Having this project done, it’ll produce better air quality to prevent an increase thus has the possibility to reduce in global warming. Hypothesis is accepted.

A “three sisters” garden is one that intercrops corn, beans and squash after the manner of the American Indian tribes. The purpose of this experiment was to determine the best corn, bean, and squash varieties suitable for our local climate that would also mature in time for students to harvest before the end of the spring semester. The hypothesis tested was that varieties of corn, beans and squash originating from Northern American Indian tribes are best suited for a three sisters garden intended to be grown by schools in our area.<br><br>Eleven varieties of corn, ten varieties of beans, and eleven varieties of squash and melons were selected; some originating among the Northern tribes, some of Southeastern and Southwestern origin, and some modern varieties. Two 12’ x 20’ raised beds were used; each variety was planted in a single ten-foot row. Rows were spaced two feet apart with the spacing between plants such that ten corn, eight bean, and four squash plants remained after thinning. Plants were observed twice a week and heights and growth stages recorded.<br><br>In conclusion, the hypothesis was partially supported by the data: Festivity, the corn variety that combined the best traits of rapid growth and suitable height at maturity is of recent origin. Three Mandan Indian varieties also performed well. Of the two best-performing squash varieties, Algonquin Pumpkin is of New England tribal origin and Yellow Crookneck is of undetermined provenance. The best-performing bean, Lena’s Bean, is an old Canadian variety also of unknown provenance.

THE SELECTION OF SUBMERGENCE-TOLERANT GERMPLASMS AND EXPRESSION ANALYSIS OF THE RELATED GENES UNDER SUBMERGENCE STRESS AT THE SEED GERMINATION IN RICE
Hang Gao, Keren Luo, Luyu Zhang
Hubei Wuchang Experimental High School, Wuhan, Hubei, CHINA

[Objective]The submergence-tolerant genetic germplasms and the key genes were determined for submergence at seed germination in rice. [Method] The influence of different depths and durations of submergence on survival rate of the germinating seeds were investigated for the evaluation conditions, and then many rice lines were screened under the submergence treatment at the seed germination. The expression patterns of the related genes were surveyed by RT-PCR analysis for the submergence-tolerant genotype and submergence-intolerant genotype at the germination under the conditions of submergence and non-submergence. [Result] The growth of roots was stimulated under 1 d submergence, but inhibited under submergence treatment for more than 4 d. Seedling survival of the germinating seeds from all tested genotypes was apparently reduced when they were submerged with more 5cm water depth for 7d by using submergence treatment. Seven submergence-tolerant rice lines were screened from 102 rice lines under the submergence treatment at the seed germination with more 5cm water depth for 7 days. OsRAmy3D, OsSus1 and OsSus2 were expressed at high levels in embryo of submerged IR64, whereas they were either not or weakly expressed in embryo of submerged FR13A.[Conclusion] Seven submergence-tolerant germplasms were obtained under submergence stress at the seed germination in rice, and high expression levels of OsRAmy3D, OsSus1 and OsSus2 that make the submergence-tolerant genotype use efficiently in hydrolysis and utilization of starch and sucrose may be crucial for seed germination and seedling growth under submergence in rice, which will provide helpful clues for the genetic and molecular investigations of the submergence tolerance at seed germination in rice.

DO CLOCKS IN DIFFERENT ARABIDOPSIS TISSUES COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER?
Chia-Rung Hsu, Pin-Han Wang, 
Taipei First Girls High School, Taipei City, CHINESE TAIPEI

It is already known that LIGHT-REGULATED WD 1 (LWD1) and LWD2 are two clock proteins, and when Arabidopsis lacks LWD1 and LWD2 proteins, the period length of the clock in the double mutant is shortened from 24 hours to 18 hours. Since LWD1 and LWD2 promoters are more active in the vascular tissue than in other plant tissues, and the mechanism of vascular clock is still unclear, we are interested in studying if the tissue-specific expression of LWD1 or LWD2 could rescue the double mutant clock defect.<br><br>Therefore, we fused the promoter of SUC2, which only expresses in the vascular tissue, whereas promoter of RBCS2B expresses in mesophyll cells, with LWD1 or LWD2 gene, and transferred them into lwd1 lwd2 double mutant plants. By observing the period length of two circadian reporter genes, CCA1 and PRR9, we could know whether tissue-specific expressed-LWD1 or -LWD2 rescues the clock defect in lwd1 lwd2 or not.<br><br>The results suggested that clocks in different plant tissues could not communicate with each other very effectively. Although LWD1/2 promoters are more active in the vascular tissue, additional expression in mesophyll cells apparently is also required for their complete functions in circadian clock. No matter where gene LWD1 or LWD2 is expressed, in the vascular tissue or mesophyll cells, it could both affect the circadian clock of the Arabidopsis.

UNRAVELING THE GIBBERELLIN SIGNALING PATHWAY IN PANICUM VIRGATUM
Kathryn Elsa Hochberg, Daphne Superville, 
George W. Hewlett High School, Hewlett, NY

Panicum virgatum or switchgrass is currently being developed as feedstock for the production of cellulosic ethanol. Although extensive studies have been conducted on saccharification and fermentation of the lignocellulosic component of its biomass, few molecular studies have been conducted on decreasing its period of seed dormancy (2-4 years). In this study, it was demonstrated that the phytohormone gibberellin (GA) significantly increases the rate of germination of seeds, hypocotyl elongation, chlorophyll and anthocyanin synthesis in seedlings<br><br>of switchgrass (cv-Alamo). Screening the publically available Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) Library, several fragments of DELLA genes were identified. Using various sequence alignment programs, two putative full-length DELLA genes (PvDELLA1 and PvDELLA2) were assembled with open reading frames encoding polypeptides of 617 and 621 amino acid residues. Using RT-PCR, the complete coding regions of these genes were amplified, confirming the assembly of these genes. Phylogenetic analysis showed a recent gene duplication event of the DELLA gene in switchgrass. Moreover, significant sequence diversification of the N-terminal has occurred and has been positively selected. In silico analyses revealed that PvDELLA1 and PvDELLA2 proteins contain all of the essential and highly conserved motifs required for DELLA function. In the presence of exogenously applied GA, the transcripts of these genes are down-regulated in<br><br>seeds, suggesting a conservation of function of the DELLA protein as a repressor of germination and development. Expression profile showed the DELLA genes are spatially expressed in the roots, late flowering buds, early floral buds, apex and stem, and in the etiolated seedling tissues of Panicum virgatum.

Today a classification system for medicinal plants is nonexistent, and the information is in different areas or difficult to find, even for those who work in traditional health fields and homeopathy. The development of a medicinal plant classification will greatly facilitate health care workers using herbal medicine and complementary disease-treatment with natural plants. This will also facilitate everyday use of alternative medicine, assuring easy access to information for the Costa Rican people.<br><br>The medicinal properties and location of the plants were taken into consideration for such a classification (including only those found in Costa Rica). Also, criteria such as the plant family, the diseases treated, its active properties, ways to prepare it for medical use and the body system benefited from its use were used in the analysis of the data.<br><br>Two hundred twenty medicinal plants were taken into consideration to start the classification. After applying the classification criteria, 102 medicinal plants were placed on the Medicinal Plants Table. From those species, 35 were found to have contraindications for their use under specific conditions. It is worth noting that 100% of the classified medicinal plants are readily available to Costa Ricans.<br><br>Once the criteria are researched and categorized, the objective was to create a classification table that can be used easily on a daily basis by professionals and laymen. <br><br>By disseminating the curative properties, diseases treatable and doses, on a medicinal plant table, through printed media and a website, the entire population will have more access to natural medicine information.

The need for water in agricultural lands varies greatly among different crops. Monitoring soil need for irrigation consumes labor and is often accompanied with waste of water.<br><br>The innovative system will supply soil with needed amounts of water automatically depending on the percentage of soil moisture and the plants need without any need for interference from the farmer. As a result; the ideal soil moisture leads to increase the productivity of crops.<br><br>The environmentally friendly system uses solar cells as a source of electric energy. The system consists of two electrical circuits: the first contains two carbon electrodes placed inside the soil and measures the difference in voltage between the two electrodes which affects the amount of resistance according to which the circuits opens and irrigates or remains open with no further action. The difference in voltage leading to the opening of the circuit -programmed in the device- is dependent upon the ideal moisture level for each plant. The second circuit, linked to a water tank, contains a sound alarm system which alerts the farmer when tank water levels decrease beyond a set minimum level for each plant.<br><br>This system has the potential to be further developed and used in the production of organic fertilizers as it controls moisture which is a vital factor in the production process.

This project was designed to determine what household and pharmaceutical products are harmful to plants when found in the water supply, and to quantify the effects of the contamination. In addition, the project was designed to determine if all-natural products are less harmful than their synthetic counterparts.<br><br> The effects of eleven common household and pharmaceutical contaminants were tested on sugar snap peas against an uncontaminated control system. After germination and an initial growth period, experimental systems were watered consistently with a 5% contaminant solution. For six weeks, the growth and health of the plants were recorded. At the conclusion of the project, carbohydrate levels and dry weights were measured to quantify plant health.<br><br> Analysis showed that 80% of tested household products and 75% of tested pharmaceuticals cause a noticeable change in plant growth curves. Most contaminants also cause a decrease in overall health, though specific adverse effects vary by contaminant. In addition, contaminants also cause poor terminal measurements: 71.4% of tested carbohydrate levels and 72.7% of dry weights were less than those of the control.<br><br> Both household goods and pharmaceuticals are harmful as contaminants in the water supply, though not all products are equally detrimental. In addition, natural products are significantly less harmful to plants than their synthetic counterparts. The importance of this research is multi-tiered. Now that the specific effects of contaminants are known, scientists and growers can develop remedial treatments. In addition, it is now clear exactly which contaminants need to be directly filtered from the water supply.

FIRST BRYOPHTE CLASSIFICATION AT QUEBRADILLAS, PUERTO RICO
Juan G. Vives, Carlos A Ramos, 
Colegio San Rafael, Quebradillas, PUERTO RICO

Studies of mosses from the last end of eighteen century to our recent century, comprise mosses of about 284 taxa (Sastre, 1993) distributed in 121 genera and hepatics and hornwort of about 237 species with 92 genera according to Rob Gradstein.Our study of bryophytes was in Quebradillas, in the northwestern region of Puerto Rico, with an average area of 30 square miles, which represent about 1 % of the whole area of the island. The local weather station in our town reveals a gradient of annual rainfall from 30 inches in the coast, (100 feet high) to 80 inches in the most southern area, (925 feet average high). We try to prove that the distribution of bryophytes species increases from a dry zone to a moist zone in a small area like our town and that this pattern is similar to that of the whole island. The study area was divided in three zones from dry to moist that is, from low altitudes near the coast to higher places in the southern zone. Species were collected in the three zones. The data collected revealed about 25 moss species, 22 genera, 9 hepatic species with 9 genera and one hornwort species. The number of species goes from one near the coast to 13 species shared by two close areas in the southern part of the town (Charcas and Guajataca). Using the distribution table of mosses in Puerto Rico we found similarities with the distribution of our data. This confirms our hypothesis.

ACID RAIN ON GERMINATING GRAIN
Desirae LeeAnn Courkamp, Larcyn Lemuel Carter, 
Liberal High School, Liberal, KS

Farmers depend on rain for the growth of their crops. If the rain the crops are receiving is too acidic, the crops may suffer. When pollutants in the air mix with the water in the atmosphere and come down as precipitation, acid rain occurs. One major air pollutant is sulfur dioxide, which is emitted by industrial processes. Acid rain can negatively affect the environment. The growth of plants can be stifled, for example, which is a problem for farmers. Acid rain was simulated with sulfuric acid to determine the effects of acid rain on germinating wheat. Seeds were soaked in solutions made to pH levels of 3.0, 4.3, 5.0, and 6.5 (6.5 was used as the control). Then, the wheat seeds were allowed to germinate for six days. The percent of seeds germinated for the different pH solutions they were soaked in was as follows: 10.75% for 3.0 pH, 12.25% for 4.3 pH, 22.00% for 5.0 pH, and 10.00% for 6.5 pH. After a 95% confidence two-sample t-test was conducted on the results of the germinated seeds, it was concluded that the pH 5.0 seeds had a significantly higher germination percentage compared to the rest of the pH seeds tested. The results did not support the hypothesis because although lower pH levels hindered the germination of the wheat, so did the 6.5 pH. The seeds soaked in the 5.0 pH solution germinated at a significantly higher percentage.

PAPER PRODUCTION FROM THE LEAF FIBERS OF YUCCA ANGUSTISSIMA (NAVAJO NAME -TSÁ'ÁSZI'TS'ÓÓZ ENGLISH TRANSLATION - NARROWLEAF YUCCA)
Kimberly Ann Begay, N/A, 
Newcomb High School, Newcomb, NM

The purpose of this research is to determine whether or not the fibers from Yucca angustissima can be made into a suitable eco friendly paper replacement for conventional writing paper. After doing more research about paper making and testing, yucca leaves were cut into 10 cm strips and boiled at 100°C for 20 hrs. After the boiling, the leaves were put in a blender for five minutes. Afterwards, the pulp was sifted and left in a sieve to dry. Different containers were also used in the drying process to see what kind of paper could be created. Once dried, the paper was tested for quality, texture and ink compatibility. The quality test consisted of measuring the thickness and strength. The different types of paper made were tested in four different trials. To test the thickness and strength of each paper, a caliper and four different weights were used in the testing. To test the strength of each paper a 20g, 50g, 100g and 200g weights were used by hanging them on a sample for 60 s. The texture test consisted of comparing the surface of the paper to other types of paper surfaces. The ink compatibility test consisted of writing on the paper with different writing materials. The conclusion is that it is possible to make an ecofriendly paper that can be made from the leaves of Yucca angustissima. The results demonstrated that it is possible to make an ecofriendly, biodegradable paper that is a suitable replacement for writing paper.

THE EFFECTS OF GROWING MICROALGAE CHLAMYDOMONAS REINHARDTII IN MUNICIPAL SECONDARY EFFLUENT WASTEWATER ON BIOMASS YIELD FOR BIOFUEL PRODUCTION
Sumedha Ravishankar, Sirtaj Bir Singh, 
Empire High School, Tucson, AZ

The energy crisis and a lack of clean water have become prominent issues facing today’s society. Alternate sources of green fuel are being developed in order to meet the global demand in a way that is environmentally friendly. Microalgae have been identified as a model organism for biofuel production because of its high lipid content. For this study, the main objective was to identify the viability of growing Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in municipal secondary effluent wastewater, with and without supplemental N and P. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was grown autophototrophically with 5% CO2 in three different conditions: wastewater, fortified wastewater, and HSM (control), for 144 hours. It was hypothesized that the wastewater would contain the necessary trace elements for microalgal growth, when combined with supplemental nutrients. Chlorophyll readings were taken daily to estimate biomass production. Statistical analysis of the data in the form of a t-test showed that the nutrients in wastewater alone were unable to produce a significant amount of mircoalgal biomass, whereas both HSM and fortified wastewater yielded optimal levels of biomass concentrations. In addition, the microalgae were grown in fertilizer (N and P source) and wastewater to create an economically practical design. These results indicate that wastewater, when supplemented with nitrogen and phosphorus, can be used to grow microalgae at the commercial level for biofuel production. However, using water soluble, ammonia based fertilizer rather than lab-grade chemicals in conjunction with wastewater is more economically feasible. Using wastewater can preserve the dwindling drinking water resources around the world, and can make biofuel production more economically practical due to reduced costs.

DORSIVENTRAL DIFFERENTIATION OF MARCHANTIA POLYMORPHA L.: WHEN AND HOW DOES A GEMMA DECIDE ITS FRONT AND BACK?
Toshikazu Tatematsu, Maiko Suzuki, Masaharu Suzuki
Koyo Senior High School, Nagoya, Aichi, JAPAN

Gemmae of Marchantia polymorpha L. are propagules raised in gemma-cups on the thallus. When spread to the ground by rainfall, all gammae differentiate to thalli with air chamber holes on their upper side and rhizoids underneath, suggesting that the front and back of the gemma is not decided by birth. We hypothesized that gemmae differentiate their front and back by environmental factors, such as gravity, light, water and/or touch. <br><br> Disk-shaped gemmae were asceptically put on the surface of agar plate either horizontally or perpendicularly and were cultured under different sets of environmental factors. When gemmae were put horizontally on the agar surface and set right side up or upside down with white light from the above, all rhizoids grew downward irrespective of agar position, indicating the involvement of light and/or gravity, but not water and touch, for the differentiation. When gemmae were put perpendicularly on the agar surface, rhizoids grew horizontally from the gemmae, suggesting weak involvement of gravity. Taken together, the front and back of gemmae is not decided by birth, but may be decided by light. Hence, gemmae were put horizontally or perpendicularly on the agar surface and set upside down with blue or red light from underneath or horizontally, respectively. The gemmae developed to thalli with air chamber holes on the side shed with blue light but not with red light. In summary, the front and back of M. polymorpha gemma is not decided by birth but controlled by the direction of blue light irradiation.

Gemali Toledano Lozado, Adriana Jaqueline Maximiliano Palma, 
Colegio Alzate, Ozumba, Estado de Mexico, MEXICO

The purpose of the present study was to make an ethnobotanical record of medicinal plants which are distributed in the municipal Ozumba de Alzate’s marketplace, Mexico State, Mexico, as well as to make a catalog with the herbalisted plants and another electronic one. With this investigation we hope to obtain a contribution of medicinal plants not registered by Linares and Bye (2010). To achieve such purposes the Ozumba’s marketplace was visited during the months of March to May and from October to December 2011, to collect commercialized samples from these places, which were herbalisted for their botanic settling. 100 surveys were applied to vendors of these plants, and then we analyzed the data in a quantitative way using the Informant Consensus Factor (ICF) and the Office Excel 2010 program as well. We also elaborated catalogs with the herbalisted samples and an electronic catalog with ethnobotanical information. In total, 90 species of medicinal plant were registered, and 48 were reported as not registered by Linares and Bye, this proves that this region has a great diversity of this kind of flora. Most of the interviewed people prefer the use of medicinal plants to treat their health complaints, being this flora a good alternative of health for the inhabitants of this region. Interviewed people tend to agree with the medicinal use given to most of the plants they mentioned in the interviews. Finally, the ethnobotanical registration was spread with diptychs, a conference and on the College’s web site.

POTTING SOIL TRIAL STUDY FOR THE NURSERY PRODUCTION OF CAPSICUM ANNUUM TRANSPLANTS
John Austin Ham
DeRidder High School, DeRidder, LA

This study was conducted to determine which commercial potting soil would produce the best Capsicum annuum transplants because it is difficult to evaluate the performance of a potting mix without a side by side trial. <br><br>The hypothesis was Pro Mix would produce the best Capsicum annuum transplants. <br><br>Five commercial potting soils were selected: Happi Gro, Vortex, Fafard Complete, Miracle Gro Complete, and Metro Mix 902. Pro Mix was created by mixing Metro Mix 902 with 3 fertilizers. A Capsicum annuum seedling was planted in each of the soils and allowed to grow 6 weeks. Seedling height was measured weekly. Seedling height, fresh weight, and dry weight were determined at the experiment's end, and soil and tissue analysis was performed. Data was averaged to make comparisons for plant growth, soil fertility, and tissue nutrient content. <br><br>Soil performance was ranked (1=best and 6=worst): (1)Pro Mix, (2)Miracle Gro, (3)Metro Mix, (4)Fafard, (5)Vortex, and (6)Happi Gro. <br><br>Pro Mix produced the best Capsicum annuum transplants. Seedlings had the greatest height growth, fresh weight, and dry weight, and seedlings continued to grow while the growth of the others slowed or stopped. Tissue from Pro Mix seedlings was in or near normal range for most elements. Soil analysis did not predict which potting soil would perform the best but did predict which would perform the worst. Soil analysis alone should not be used to determine which soils are best for the nursery production of Capsicum annuum transplants.

DNA BARCODE AND PHYLOGENY OF THE JUNCACEAE ASSESSED USING A NEW SET OF MOLECULAR MARKERS
Do Hoang Diep
Gymnazium pod Svatou Horou in Pribram, Pribram, CZECH REPUBLIC

Species identification through morphological data might not be sufficient nowadays; therefore searching for new, more sophisticated and precise methods are important. DNA barcoding is a key for cheap, easy and relatively quick species identification. This project should prove the universality of chosen molecular markers (rpoC1, rpoB, psbA-trnH, psbK-psbI and atpF-atpH loci), which could be used as an identification system for the Juncaceae based on sequence polymorphism. Second part of my study is focused on phylogeny of the Juncaceae based on a sequence data.<br><br>I have used standard methods of molecular biology, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for amplification, agarose horizontal electrophoresis and UV transluminator for visualization of PCR products, only successful products have been sequenced. Alignment of DNA sequences according to their homological position was made by BioEdit. PAUP and Winclada were used for construction of phylogenetic and neighbour-joining trees.<br><br>According to the data, I can verify the monophyly of genus Luzula and paraphyly of genus Juncus. The group Oreojuncus is separated as a sister group of Juncus and Luzula. The barcoding potential of the set of molecular markers is efficient to distinguish taxa at the genus level. The combination of non-coding spacer (psbA-trnH) and gene (rpoC1) is able to discriminate taxa at the species level. The success of amplification was well even the herbarium samples were used. That fact supports the suitability of the markers as a DNA Barcoding tool.

THE EFFECTS OF IRON, MANGANESE, AND BORON ON THE RHIZOBIA INOCULATION OF GLYCINE MAX AND VIGNA UNGUICULATA GROWTH, A THIRD YEAR STUDY
Sarah Elizabeth Craig
Crestview High School, Crestview, FL

This project was performed to determine if adding the micronutrients Iron (Fe), Manganese (Mn), and Boron (B), positively affect the rhizobia's nitrifying ability in the inoculation of Glycine max and Vigna unguiculata during plant growth. Nitrogen, enhanced by rhizobia inoculation, is the most commonly deficient plant nutrient in many soils around the world. Iron (Fe), Manganese (Mn), and Boron (B) are the next most supplemented nutrients in plants after nitrogen. I want to determine if applying these micronutrients, along with the nitrogen fixing bacteria rhizobia provided to plants, positively affects the important role of nitrogen in the production of legumes. If a connection is found, legume producers may choose to intervene with measures to apply or not to apply the micronutrients due to their effect on the rhizobia.<br><br>A brief procedure is as follows: inoculate treated seeds only, plant all seeds, water 10 plants rhizobia treated and not treated with Iron (Fe), Manganese (Mn), or Boron(B) of each type of legume. Observe and record data, dispose of plants properly.<br><br>The results showed that the hypothesis was supported. The rhizobia were not harmed by the micronutrients. When the legumes were inoculated with the rhizobia and treated with Iron (Fe), Manganese (Mn), or Boron (B) they were potentiated in growth. The conclusion is that gardeners and farmers can spend the extra time to inoculate legumes with rhizobia and supplement plants with Iron (Fe), Manganese (Mn), or Boron (B), if needed, and in return get faster growing and healthier plants.

BUILDING NEW AGROBACTERIUM STRAINS FOR HIGH EFFICIENCY TRANSFORMATION OF PLANTS
Aditi Das
Roseville Area High School, Roseville, MN

The soil bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens causes ‘Crown Gall’ tumor disease on plants. The bacterium incites disease through the transfer and stable integration of a piece of its plasmid DNA into the plant nuclear genome. Genes within the transferred DNA are expressed in a transformed plant. The DNA transfer property of Agrobacterium has been successfully exploited to introduce foreign genes into plants. DNA transfer requires the virulence (vir) genes that code for over twenty proteins. Not all plants could be transformed with wild type Agrobacterium. Some plants could only be transformed with modified Agrobacterium strains that contain extra copies of the vir genes. I postulated that a subset of the vir genes is sufficient for the increase in transformation efficiency. I studied the transforming property of four Agrobacterium strains containing different sets of vir genes on several plant species. I found that additional vir genes did not affect transformation of Kalanchoë daigremontiana. Carrot and potato were best transformed with the wild type strain and additional vir gene copies were detrimental to transformation. My studies showed that beet is very difficult to transform with wild type Agrobacterium. Transformation was greatly enhanced by adding more copies of the vir genes. I demonstrated that extra copies of vir genes are not always beneficial for transformation, and a small subset of vir genes is sufficient for improved transformation of at least one plant that is difficult to transform with wild type bacteria.

CIRCADIAN AND PHOTOMORPHOGENIC RESPONSE IN ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA
Savannah Elizabeth Est
Emil E. Holt Senior High School, Wentzville, MO

As the urgency for improved efficiency and sustainability in crop production becomes increasingly important due to a growing world population, circadian plant research offers a promising method of production enhancement. The 24 hour circadian oscillation rhythm of a plant contributes to its overall production quality and quantity by controlling growth, development, and flowering in plants. The eventual goal of circadian research is to be able to manipulate the circadian clock to enable plants to flower multiple times per life cycle, however knowledge of these processes is limited. Although the role of the circadian clock in this is widely unknown, one of the most essential aspects of plant growth and development is a plant’s intake and utilization of light. The goal of this experiment is to design a process in order to observe and identify circadian and photomorphogenic responses to various wavelengths, angles, and rotations of light and their relationship to the circadian clock. In conclusion, a successful method of observation and experimentation was designed, and it was determined that there is a relationship between photomorphogenesis and the circadian flowering mechanism. By providing evidence for this relationship, circadian researchers can now focus on the specific genes involved in photomorphogenesis in the future to aid in a successful flowering manipulation.

Reid Toshio Kealii Akana
Kamehameha Schools Kapalama High School, Hawaii, HI

Melissa officinalis, or “Lemon Balm”, as it is commonly known, is an herb in the mint family. This study was undertaken to determine if an ethanolic extract from this plant would exhibit any cytotoxic properties. An extract was created and then was separated into 3 different fractions using thin layer chromatography. SKOV3 and K562 cells were treated with the three different fractions, and a whole leaf extract, to determine if any cytotoxic effects were observed. The whole leaf extract, and the first fraction (Rf=0.58) exhibited cytotoxic properties. In addition to thin layer chromatography column chromatography was employed, and a total of ten different fractions were obtained. Four chemical tests were run on the plant extract fractions. A Tollen’s test confirmed the presence of aldehydes in the last four fractions, and a bromine acetic acid test confirmed the presence of aromatic ethers in fractions 2, and fractions 6 through 10.

Use of commercial fungicides in controlling the growth of fungal pathogens can harm other living things in the environment. Alternative fungicides are needed. This study was conducted to test the potential of Impatiens balsamina (Kamantigue) leaf extract in controlling Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense Tropical race 4 (Foc TR4) causing Fusarium wilt of banana. This study also compared the efficacy of I. balsamina leaf extract with commercial treatment – Benzalkonium chloride.<br><br>A Complete Randomized Design was followed using these five treatments: T0- Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA), T1- 25% I. balsamina leaf extract solution, T2- 50% I. balsamina leaf extract solution, T3- 75% I. balsamina leaf extract solution and T4-Benzalkonium Chloride, with three replicates per treatment. The experimental phase using Poisoned Food Technique was observed for seven days. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s test were used to analyze the data for radial growth, percent of inhibition and number of days before occurrence of Foc TR4.<br><br>The results showed that I. balsamina leaf extract is an effective organic-based fungicide against the radial growth of Foc TR4. 25% and 50% concentrations significantly decreased radial growth but 75% concentration of I. balsamina leaf extract yielded the most effective treatment.<br><br>The study indicates that I. balsamina leaf extract could be a promising organic-based fungicide because the results of the experiment demonstrated antifungal activity against the growth of Foc TR4.<br><br>Keywords: Impatiens balsamina, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense, banana

SUGARBEET IMMUNIZATIONS: DOES IT WORK WITH RHIZOCTONIA? PHASE TWO: PROOF IN THE FIELD
Amy Kaitlyn Anfinrud
Park Christian School, Moorhead, MN

Since 2009, sugarbeet growers ranked Rhizoctonia solani the most serious disease impacting sugarbeet production. Once Rhizoctonia infects a root, the disease spreads causing rot, loss of yield, quality and storability. Seed treatments (immunizations) to protect sugarbeets from Rhizoctonia were recently developed and are now commercially available (2012). The two fungicides developed are Metconazole and Azoxystrobin.<br><br>The purpose of this project was to study effectiveness of fungicides, differences between fungicides, and if there was a statistically significant difference in root damage.<br><br>In phase one, the two fungicides were tested in a greenhouse by inoculating plants in potting soil and monitoring plant death.<br><br>Phase Two took place in a sugarbeet field. Three treatments were randomized in a six replicate split plot design. Treatments were Metconazole, Azoxystrobin, and a control. The two row plots were split into subplots comparing an inoculated row with a non- inoculated row.<br><br>Stand counts were taken three weeks after planting. Four weeks later ten plants were inoculated with Rhizoctonia incubated barley seeds per inoculated row. These plants were identified and monitored weekly for disease incidence. After eight weeks, 1084 sugarbeets were hand harvested, weighed, and scored using a Rhizoctonia rating scale.<br><br>Results showed the Metconazole treated plants had significantly less Rhizoctonia disease than Azoxystrobin and the control. Metconazole resulted in fewer deaths during the growing season, and less root disease at harvest. The untreated inoculated beets suffered a $1354 loss in revenue per hectare, while the Metconazole treatment had losses of $648 per hectare.<br><br>Metconazole reduced Rhizoctonia losses.

THE CORRELATION OF ENERGY OUTPUT OF PINE SPECIES AND THEIR RESIN CONTENT, YEAR FOUR
Holly Linn Tucker
Union County High School, Lake Butler, FL

The purpose of this experiment is to determine if high resin content in biomass feedstock will correlate to a higher energy output. Seven different species were selected from the Eastern United States which include eastern white, Pinus strobus; loblolly, P. taeda; virginia, P. virginiana; slash, P. elliottii; shortleaf, P. echinata; red, P. resinosa; pitch, P. rigida, and “lighter wood”. These species were selected by identifying areas of the United States with existing biomass resources. Using maps and other resources provided by my state forestry service, along with identifying natural ranges of common pine species, the seven species mentioned above were chosen. Once determined, emails and letters were sent out to foresters in the areas identified. The response received was overwhelming. Samples were received from thirty locations ranging from Florida to Northern New York. Once samples were collected, resin was extracted from the plant samples using acetone, and a bomb calorimeter was located at a local university laboratory for the purpose of burning the feedstock samples. Over forty feedstock samples have been tested. After analyzing the data collected, a trend can be seen which supports my hypothesis. However, this cannot be statistically supported with the existing tests because in addition to resin content other variables may be factors affecting energy output including genetics and age of the plant samples. This research is a continuation of a four-year study on biomass feedstock. Additional samples are still being collected and analyzed. To date, virginia and loblolly pine are showing the greatest correlation between pre and post resin extraction and energy output.

STUDY ON THE NEMATICIDAL ACTIVE COMPONENTS FROM THE SEEDS OF ANTIARIS TOXICARIA
Yong Chen
Hainan Middle School, Haikou, CHINA

Antiaris toxicaria, belonging to the family Moraceae, is highly toxic because of a rich source of cardenolide glycosides. It would be a scientific and environment-friendly method that the dart poision of A. Toxicaria was used as killing the agroforestry “cancer” - plant nematode. This paper reported that the ethanol extract from the seeds of A. Toxicaria showed toxicity against Panagrellus redivivus by nematicidal activity-screening in vitro. Furthermore, bioassay-guided fractionation and chemical analysis of natural products led to the isolation of two nematode activity compouds from the seeds of A. toxicaria, which were identified as strophalloside and glucostrophalloside. Further studies showed that glucostrophalloside had significant toxicity against P. redivivus, and the rate of death after 72 h was 53.34%. The results confirmed that A. toxicaria had nematode activity, and provided the scientific basis for development of low toxicity and residue, highly selective biological pesticide,thus protecting the environment can take advantage of bio-pesticides,the benefit of mankind.

GENETIC ENGINEERING: IMPROVING DROUGHT RESISTANCE BY IDENTIFYING THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS OF MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 4 AND ITS INTERACTION WITH SUBSTRATE MKS1 IN BRASSICA NAPUS
Michelle Man-si Chin
West Shore Junior/Senior High School, Melbourne, FL

Plants have developed many mechanisms to adapt to biotic and abiotic environmental stress. Mitogen-activated protein kinases play an active role in regulating stress-induced guard cell signaling by causing stomates to close in response to drought. While the protein pathway has already been identified, the precise underlying molecular mechanisms that cause this intracellular response are unknown. The researcher proposed a novel approach to characterize MKS1 as a target protein of MPK4 in Brassica napus via gene isolation, bacterial transformation, protein verification and an in vitro kinase assay. The researcher hypothesized that MKS1 is a target protein of MPK4 in B.napus due to its similar functionality to close relative Arabidopsis thaliana, in which MKS1 is a substrate of MPK4. Also, B.napus will express an enhanced drought-resistant phenotype when MKS1 is overexpressed in its genome. <br><br> BnMKS1 was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli with recombination technology. Data from tandem mass spectrometry and western blotting provided final verification of MKS1 expression. An in-solution kinase assay showed the phosphorylation of BnMKS1 by BnMPK4, indicating the interaction of the two proteins in vitro. Therefore, the researcher’s hypothesis was supported that MKS1 is a substrate of MPK4 in B.napus. Characterization and upregulation of additional substrates of the MPK4 pathway can lead to the development of enhanced drought-resistant crops. This novel approach can be used to identify additional target proteins in the guard cell pathway as well. The researcher's future goal is to create a transgenic crop by overexpressing MKS1 and compare the phenotypic differences to wild-type B.napus.

Lu Zhang
Affiliated High School of Peking University, Beijing, CHINA

Invasive species and their invasion have brought tremendous ecological and economical problems all over the world and it is one of the most intractable environmental problems in this century. Studies on invasive species are mainly focused on the famous or notorious star or target species, few studies have been conducted on those potential invasive species. The best and most economical way to control the invasive species is to find ways beforehand to prevent its explosive invasion. The biological traits, habitat and distribution, and dispersal ability of Euphorbia dentata Michx., an alien species just settled in the Botanical Garden at Xiangshan of Beijing is investigated in this study. The potential distribution of this American native weed in China is postulated by ecological modeling methods. Results showed that Euphorbia dentata is a dangerous invasive species in China. Methods to prevent its expansion based on the biological characters are suggested. This study presents an example for controlling invasive species at its early stage.

THE EFFECTS OF HYPERGRAVITY ON PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
Lillith Chun Yue Bulawa
Rome Free Academy, Rome, NY

Space is the next great are of exploration. Just as in explorations and adventures of the past, much planning and preparation must go into future long term space journeys. It is recognized that humans face problems in space due to conditions of microgravity and are required to spend hours each day doing resistance exercises to avoid loss of muscle and bone mass loss. A less well known phenomenon is the problem of gravity resistance in plants. Plants develop on earth under conditions of normal gravity. When grown in the absence of gravity their cell walls are weak. This problem must be solved so that strong healthy plants can be grown to support future long term space missions.<br><br> One solution to the problem of gravity resistance is to provide plants a way to grow under the influence of a force other then gravity. I wanted to see how plants would be effected when grown under conditions of hypergravity.<br><br> In order to provide gravity resistance to plants I compared plants grown in hypergravity conditions to plants exposed to normal gravity. The experimental plants were grown on a large centrifuge which exposed them to a centripetal force. The thickness, height, and angle of stalk growth were compared to controls. I was able to show that plants grown under conditions of hypergravity showed a statistical difference in the rate of growth of their length, angle of growth and diameter.<br><br> The data I have obtained may be used to develop strong and healthy plants for use in future long term space missions.

HOW "MULCH" DOES IT MATTER?
Mariah Ann Walker
South Terrebonne High School, Bourg, LA

When picking out mulch for a garden, do people think one type of mulch will help plants grow more than the other mulches? <br><br> I believe that the black mulch will improve plant growth the most because black is a dark color that absorbs more heat from the sun. I believe that the other mulch colors will improve the plant’s growth, but will not have as great of an effect as the black mulch.<br><br> For this experiment, I first filled twelve 6 X 10 pots and filled them with 2.8 liters of potting soil. I placed two Derby (Bush) bean seeds three centimeters deep in each pot. After, I placed all pots together where they could all have an equal amount of sunlight. Once a day I watered each plant with 200mL of water and measured each plant. When the plants began to sprout, I added 6cm of potting soil. Over a period of fourteen days, I observed and recorded which color of mulch had the greatest effect on the growth of the plants.<br><br> On the last day I observed that the plants with the red mulch grew the tallest. In close second, was the brown mulch, with black mulch trailing behind, and finally was the control with just potting soil.<br><br> According to my results, my hypothesis was incorrect. Research helped me to make my educated guess that the black mulch would have the greatest effect but my experiment proved that the red mulch had the greatest effect on the growth rate of a plant.

INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF ELF ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS ON GERMINATION AND GROWTH OF GLYCINE MAX
Alanna Megan Bram
John Marshall High School, Rochester, MN

Our environment is filled with ever increasing amounts of electromagnetic (EM) exposure due to the widespread utilization of electricity and expanding use of personal electronic devices. It is not yet clear what the effects of these exposures may be on the environmental health and well being of living organisms, however there is concern that these may be detrimental. Glycine max (the soybean plant) is one of the most important sources of food. Factors that would impair the efficiency of soybean production would have a major impact because of the large scale of its use around the world. I hypothesized that EM fields at certain extremely low frequencies (ELF) would interfere with Glycine max biology. To test this hypothesis, I designed and constructed several variable EM field generators. A metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) on a custom designed printed circuit board, was used to drive the EM field-generating coil, under the control of a digital microprocessor. The microprocessor was programmed to allow variable activation of the electromagnetic coil at rates from 1 to 500,000 cycles per second (Hz). Plant seeds were exposed to EM fields at different frequencies and assessed for germination rate in vitro, and shoot growth after planting. I found that EMF frequencies at 30 Hz had a significantly detrimental effect on shoot length, reducing growth by up to 50%. These results supported my main hypothesis.

GROWING MORE WHEAT AND CONSERVING WATER IN ARID LANDS
Muhammad Khan Nizamani
Ennis High School, Ennis, MT

Pakistan is an arid land. The Sindh Province rarely gets more than six inches of rain a year. At the same time, Pakistan depends on wheat production to feed its population. Significant population growth is reducing water supplies for agriculture while increasing the need for wheat production.<br><br>Ninety five percent of wheat farmers in Sindh Province use flood irrigation to water their fields. Flood irrigation is the most inefficient irrigation system and is not well suited to arid lands. Drip irrigation is a far more efficient form of irrigation. <br><br>This project began with the idea that drip irrigation can be of great advantage to wheat farmers. I grew four separate beds of wheat. Two with home designed drip systems and two with simple flooding. The results of these experiments indicated that germination rates, growth rates of wheat and water conservation are significantly greater with drip irrigation than with flood irrigation. <br><br> During the course of this project I learned that there are great advantages to drip irrigation. It saves water and helps wheat grow faster. I learned there are many problems in changing from flood to drip irrigation, including costs. Additionally, drip irrigation can be used more easily with row crops like vegetables, etc. than with field crops.<br><br>The project needs to be expanded to a more traditional wheat farm condition. This experiment should be conducted by comparing zero tillage which may give greater opportunities for use of drip irrigation using pipes or tubes placed six inches underground with field crops.

I'M LICHEN' IT: ANTIBACTERIAL PROPERTIES OF LICHEN METABOLITE (+)-USNIC ACID TOWARDS THE PLANT PATHOGEN RHODOCOCCUS FASCIANS
Camille Kassidy Collier
West Linn High School, West Linn, OR

The lichen metabolite (+)-usnic acid is shown to be the most effective antibiotic of the two existing usnic acid antipodes. Research upon its inhibitory and antiproliferative effects is considerable, yet it seldom concerns itself with application to plant disease and plant pathology. This study attempts to determine if (+)-usnic acid is an effective agent against the bacterial plant pathogen Rhodococus fascians.<br><br>It was expected that a usnic acid concentration of 32 μg/ml would inhibit bacterial growth up to 90%. To approach goals, usnic acid was dissolved in DMSO (from Sigma Aaldrich), diluted, and distributed into several sample tubes containing R. fascians (cultures obtained from OSU). The samples were then incubated and afterwards plated so that CFU quantities could be collected. The result of the methodology was a successful inhbition of bacterial growth in response to usnic acid in a concentration of 16 µg/ml, but growth was only reduced by 9%. A concentration of 32 µg/ml only inhibitied growth by 2.08%. Because of this low rate, the original hypothesis was refuted.<br><br>Although these percentages are minimal, (+)-usnic acid should still be considered a promising antimicrobial that can act towards R. fascians effectively given the correct concentration and methodology. Further research can potentially lead to the creation of an antibiotic protecting against R. fascians or a deepened understanding of the usnic acid-plant interaction.

HYBRIDS IN THE BRAZILIAN MANGROVE
Alexandre Garcia Dias
Escola Americana de Campinas, Campinas, BRASIL

Throughout the past years there has been massive deforestation of the mangroves in Brazil because of the need for roads that cross through their areas of for the wood. For example, in Pará, half a mangrove has been blighted because of a highway that was built through its area, now because of the reduced area the plants were basically forced to result to self-pollination or to reproduce with different species forming hybrids. That is the most accepted theory in the appearance of Rhizopora harrisonii in the mangroves of Brazil, that it is a hybrid of Rhizopora racemosa and Rhizopora mangle. The greatest problem and most intriguing characteristic of the supposed hybrid is the fact that it is less fertile than its parent species, but hybrids usually cannot reproduce. This is why its microsatellite and allele structure must be examined and compared to the supposed parent species to determine if it is or not a hybrid. <br><br> A microsatellite is a repeating pattern in nucleotides in the DNA sequence of the plant and most of these microsatellites represent certain species, which means they are unique to a certain group of plants. The observed results of the genotyping of the microsatellite of the Rhizopora harrisonii show that it contains some alleles that are exclusive to Rhizopora mangle and some that are exclusive to Rhizopora racemosa. These results confirm the fact that Rhizopora harrisonii is a hybrid of the the two previously mentioned species. This result brings us knowledge of the specie, of the biodiversity of the mangrove, of the Brazilian biodiversity, and of the reproduction of these species and knowledge, for the sake of knowledge is always necessary.

THE EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURES ABOVE 29.5 DEGREES CELSIUS ON THREE DIFFERENT BRASSICA RAPA SPECIES
Brittany Michelle Gallahan
Central Virginia Governor's School/ Rustburg High School, Lynchburg, VA

The purpose of this experiment was to see if temperatures above 29.5 degrees Celsius will impact the growth patterns of three different types of Brassica rapa. Three different types of B. rapa were used: Rosetta Dwarf, Standard, and Purple Stem Hairy. Each experimental group had a total of fourteen plants with seven plants grown in controlled heated box, and seven in room temperatures. After 15 days the width of the three leaves from each plant was measured, and a total flower and seed count were recorded. A two-sample T-test, using an alpha level of 0.05, resulted in p-values of 0.00134 (Rosetta Dwarf), 0.00016 (Standard), and 0.21424 (Purple Stem Hairy). The null hypothesis (mean of ideal leaves = to mean of leaves in high temperatures) was retained for Purple Stem Hairy B. rapa and rejected for both Rosetta Dwarf and Standard B. rapa. The hypothesis, “if the temperatures are greater than 29.5 degrees Celsius then leaf width would decrease along with the number of flowers and seeds produced," was supported by the data that Rosetta Dwarf and Standard B. rapa produced, but was not supported by Purple Stem Hairy B. rapa. Based on the data Purple Stem Hairy B. rapa plants were best suited to thrive in warmer temperatures and Standard and Rosetta Dwarf B. rapa should be further tested to see the exact temperature limitation.

STEM GROWTH AND REPRODUCTION IN MINT PLANTS
Hannah Marie Dahl
Saint David High School, Saint David, AZ

The purpose of this experiment was to assess the different factors that affect stem growth and regulation in chocolate mint plants. Because the stem controls many of the plant's vital functions, the factors that affect whether or not a stem is able to grow back is very important. I hypothesized that the plants that had a growth hormone added to their stems would grow back faster. The methods used were to gather 15 chocolate mint plants with separate root systems and divide them into 5 groups of 3. One group would be kept alone as the control, and the remaining 4 groups would be experimented on. The first group had all lateral stems removed, the second group had all lateral stems removed and apical stems removed to the top of the first node; the third group had all stems removed to the beginning of the roots. The fourth group also had its lateral stems removed and the apical stem removed to the first node, but immediately after cutting the apical stem the tip of the first node was dipped in a growth hormone, auxin. Each plant was set in a jar of water and placed on a windowsill for 10 days. I kept a journal of my observations the whole time. I found that the plants with the least amount of stems removed were able to grow new stems back the fastest, and the new stems grew back where the old stems had previously been. I learned that time is the most significant factor to consider in stem growth and reproduction. This is important in agricultural production because if bugs or other animals eat too much of the plant, it won't be able to reproduce stems again, cutting the crop yield in half.

TESTING FOR GMO MARKERS IN PROCESSED FOODS AND LOCALLY-FARMED PRODUCE: CAN YOU TRUST THE LABEL? A LOOK INTO THE REALITY OF OUR FOOD LABELING SYSTEM AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE AMERICAN CONSUMER
Sydney Moriah Giacalone
Albemarle High School, Charlottesville, VA

The U.S. is one of few first-world countries that have yet to make a law requiring the labeling of genetically modified food. There are many producers who voluntarily use “non-GMO” labels, but this label is backed by no authority other than the producer. My research purpose was to evaluate the ability of a consumer in today’s US food system to trust the accuracy of “non-GMO” label claims.<br><br>I used PCR testing to identify the absence or presence of the CaMV 35S promoter and the NOS terminator, two gene sequences used in 85% of genetically engineered materials. My first round of testing used 22 different food products: 11 vegetable samples from a local farm, and 11 processed products from Kroger and Whole Foods. The processed products contained labeling claims such as “made with no GMO ingredients.” I used 3% agarose gels for Round One, and 10% polyacrylamide gels for Round Two. All controls were accurate and I followed a strict procedure to eliminate any chance of sample cross-contamination. <br><br>My results show that the current regulations concerning GMO labeling are insufficient to provide consumers with "GMO free" assurance. Of the five products that claimed to be "GMO free" in Round One, two tested positive for GMO markers. In Round Two, four of five "GMO free" labeled products testing positive for GMO markers. The impact of my research is immense when considered in the realm of the current US political debate over labeling genetically modified food. Without mandated GMO testing and labeling, guarantees of “GMO free” simply cannot be made. While the issue is highly controversial and viciously protested by many powerful American corporations, the consumer has the power to decide the outcome of this debate, and consumers are speaking up.

FLAX SEED BIODIESEL, PHASE III: PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC EVALUATION
Taylor John Schroeder
Fairfield Public School District #21, Fairfield, MT

The agricultural industry grows through development of new crops and/or development of new ways to gain value from old crops. Flax historically has been sold as seed; however, it has potential to gain additional value when further processed and marketed as three separate products: biodiesel fuel, soap, and pellets. This study, now in Phase III, examines the preliminary economic feasibility of flax as a value-added crop. It evaluates the costs of field production, crushing of seed into oil, conversion of oil into biodiesel, conversion of glycerol into biodiesel soap, and pressing of pellets. The research demonstrates that all three value-added products can be manufactured and sold at a profit. Profits depend on land costs and on whether the ground is irrigated or dry land. On irrigated ground, potential profits range from $117 to $457 per acre. Potential profits on dry land range from $39 to $157 per acre. Further research will examine the potential of two additional value-added products: omega 3 oil and linen.

COMPARATIVE ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY IN THE LEAVES OF BAUHINIA SPECIES
Yeshwanth Mahesh
Citizens High School, Bangalore, INDIA

The aim of this study is to compare the antibacterial activity of leaves of four species of Bauhinia viz. B. purpurea, B. galpini, B. roxburghii and B.vahli. Healthy leaves were collected and extracted in methanol, acetone and distilled water. The antibacterial activity of these extracts were tested on five pathogenic bacteria Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae following disc diffusion method. Different concentrations of leaf extracts of Bauhinia were tested against individual test bacterial strains. Inhibition zone appearing on nutrient agar plates surrounding the filter paper disc were measured in mm. Results show that the leaf extracts of all four species of Bauhinia species show antibacterial activity against at least one test bacterium even at the lowest concentration tested (100 μg/ml). When compared it was found that B. purpurea and B. galpini were inhibitory towards Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa while, B. galpini and B. roxburghii showed antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Neither aqueous nor acetone extracts of Bauhinia leaves showed positive responses against any of the test bacterial strains. The antibacterial efficacy of methanolic extracts of leaves of four Bauhinia species towards Micrococcus luteus and Pseudomonas aeroginosa was found to be higher than standard antibiotics. An attempt was also made to purify the antibacterial compounds present in leaf extracts of Bauhinia species following thin layer chromatography. This study shall further lead to the identification of possible antibacterial compounds present in the leaves of Bauhinia.

COMPARING PROTEIN CONTENT OF MAIZE BY ELECTROPHORESIS & CHROMATOGRAPHY TO I.D. AMINO ACIDS WITHIN
Brandon Joseph Martinez
Grants High School, Grants, NM

Maize was first cultivated thousands of years ago, and has since been one of the main staples of diets worldwide, especially in developing countries. The purpose of this project was to test for nutritional value of different heirloom (open pollinated) varieties of maize. The hypothesis was that the variety with the greatest amount of amino acids will prove the most nutritional. Through these experiments, lives worldwide could potentially be improved as those that rely on maize may lack certain amino acids, resulting in a nitrogen deficiency. In these experiments, the kernels from five varieties were ground with TCA, proteins extracted and prepared with B- mercaptoethanol for Agarose SDS Electrophoresis. Measurements of proteins separated were taken for the distance migrated to determine the ~ molecular weight, in order to calculate the ~number of amino acid residues present, and calculate the number of DNA base pairs coding for proteins isolated. Electrophoresis results show Bloody Butcher contained the heaviest proteins, two separations (45,000 Daltons & 31,500 Daltons) closely followed by Mosby’s Prolific which also had two separations (39,500 Daltons & 31, 000 Daltons) the other samples produced only one protein separation. Later paper chromatography was used to separate digested proteins from each variety of maize in 1D and 2D chromatography, using Butanol and Ethanol solutions to identify specific amino acids compared to control samples of eight of the essential amino acids. These results confirmed that Blood Butcher and Mosby’s Prolific each contained eight of the nine essential amino acids, 89% while the other varieties of corn only contained five of the nine or 56%. This supports the hypothesis that the variety of maize with the most protein would also contain a higher number of amino acids and be the most nutritional leading to a healthier diet.

STUDYING THE EFFECTS OF GLIADIN PROTEIN LEVELS IN HYBRID WHEATS ON THE SEGMENT REGENERATION IN LUMBRICULUS
Emma Kay Scholz
Sterling High School, Sterling, CO

The purpose of this experiment was to study the effects of gliadin protein levels in hybrid wheat on the segment regeneration in Lumbiculus. The researcher hypothesized that the different types of hybrid wheat will cause a significant change in the segmentation regeneration of the black worms, and that the wheat seeds with the least amount of gliadin will have the best resulting regeneration. First four different types of wheat seeds were obtained; non-modified wheat, NU-Grain wheat, Denali wheat, and Brawl; all common types of wheat seed. Hybrid wheat flour, Snowmass, was also obtained. Slurries were made out of each type of seed and flour type and exposed to California black worms. The seeds and flour were also tested using a gluten assay test to indicate the amount of gliadin/gluten in each type of seed. The worms were cut and exposed to the slurries, and regeneration was recorded. The results of regeneration were then compared to the levels of gliadin in each different type of hybrid wheat. It was found that the three types of wheat with the highest amounts of gluten (Snowmass, Non-Modified, and Nu-Grain) had the lowest growth percentage and the three types of wheat that had the lowest amount of gliadin (Brawl, Denali, and the control) had the highest growth percentages. From this study, the researcher can conclude that the higher the amount of gliadin, the lower the growth percentages would be. This research suggests that high amounts of gluten found in particular types of wheat could decrease the growth and proliferation of cells in the digestive tract, specifically the small intestine.

SURVIVORSHIP & REPRODUCTION OF MELON APHID, APHIS GOSSYPII GLOVER, ON TWO VARIETIES OF CUCUMBER, CUCUMIS SATIVUS, FED WITH TURMERIC, CURCUMA LONGA, RHIZOME EXTRACT
Marcella Anne Fitisone
Tafuna High School, Pago Pago, AMERICAN SAMOA

The melon aphid, Aphis gossypii, is the most serious insect pest of cucumbers in American Samoa. Cucumber, Cucumis sativus, are an important crop in the local community; therefore, a two part study was designed and conducted to determine whether or not there was a potential differential in the population of melon aphids on two varieties of cucumbers, and whether or not the use of a medicinal plant, Curcuma longa (turmeric) would solve the issue that Am. Samoa is facing concerning melon aphids. <br><br>The first experimental procedure was done in order to assess the suitability of two varieties of cucumber commonly cultivated in American Samoa (“Delight Green” and “Green Bowl”) for A. gossypii. Laboratory maintained melon aphids were placed on 15-day old cucumber seedlings. The adult and nymphal numbers (population of nymphs) were recorded for a period of ten days and compared for the two varieties. The results show that both varieties supported rapid population growth. The aphid populations amongst the two varieties were not significantly different. From the results of the first experiment, the second component of this study was developed. <br><br>Curcuma longa, more commonly known as the turmeric plant, is known for its medicinal properties as well as its hormetic occurrence. Due to these properties, the rhizome extract was used to evaluate possible effects on the growth of one variety of C. sativus, because analysis shows that the varieties are not statistically different in their tolerance for aphid population growth. In addition to this, its suitability as a biological control for melon aphids was investigated. The soil used to cultivate the cucumber plants introduced with aphids was treated with the C. longa extract. Plant growth rates and aphid adult survivorship were monitored during the experimental time period. The data acquired from the experiment was statistically analyzed, and results show that the turmeric extract did enhance the plant growth and eliminated the melon aphids as well.

CAN NATIVE BEES REPLACE HONEYBEES IN COMMERCIAL APPLE PRODUCTION?
Catherine Grace Schlueter
Mountain View High School, Lawrenceville, GA

Honeybees (Apis mellifera) are the major pollinators of fruits and vegetables in the world. However, worldwide agriculture is in jeopardy, due to declines in honeybees due to colony collapse disorder (CCD). The decline of honeybees has increased the expense of renting honeybee hives, which farmers need to pollinate their crops. <br><br>In this study, native bees were examined to see if they could successfully pollinate apple trees as well as honeybees. At Mountain-View Orchards (McCaysville, GA), ten apple trees (Malus domestica) were selected. On each tree, two similar branches (e.g. similar buds and length) were identified. A netting enclosure, which excluded honeybee-size and larger bees, was place over one of the selected branches (experimental) in May. The other branch (control) was left uncovered. The apples of the first set of five trees were examined in mid-June. In August, mature apples of the second set of five trees were examined. The apples were weighed, their circumferences measured, and their seeds counted. T-tests compared apple weight (t =1.305, p= 0.2038), circumference (t=1.243, p=0.2253) and seed number (t=1.482, p= 0.1507) between control and experimental apples. Statistical analyses indicated that there were no differences between the control and experimental groups. The most common native bees captured within the netting enclosure were Andrena crataegi (72%) and Andrena carlini (15%). Andrena crataegi was identified as the “apple bee” in Georgia. Therefore, native bees are effective pollinators in commercial apple production and can provide a natural and sustainable agricultural alternative to the declining honeybee.

DOES OVERCROWDING AFFECT PLANT GROWTH?
Latravian Kentral Hayes
Humphreys County High School, Belzoni, MS

The title of my project is “Does Overcrowding Affect Plant Growth”. The purpose of my project is to determine if overcrowding plants effect their overall growth. <br><br>1. For this experiment, the independent variable is whether or not more than one seed is placed in the soil. The dependent variable is the height of the plants after10 days. This is determined by using a ruler to measure the height of the plants in each pot and calculating their average height. The constants (control variables) are the environment the plants are kept in (temperature, humidity, light, etc), the size of the pot, the type of plants (namely, cabbage seeds and squash seeds) and the type of soil.<br><br>2. The pots are labeled by the amount of seeds placed in the pot .The plants are inspected and height averaged out. The same amount of soil is filled into each pot. Place cabbage and squash seeds in each of the 8 pots according to the markings on the pot.<br><br>3. The plants are watered once a day with the same amount of water and placed where they can get enough sunlight to grow.<br><br> <br><br>I collected the progress of growth of each of the seeds as they sprouted and grew. I monitored and compared to determine if the presence of more plants are a negative effect on their growth. I discovered that it is true that the presences of more plants are negative for plant growth. My hypothesis was accepted that more plants are unbeneficial; to the growth of plants.

THE ROLE OF FATTY ACID AND RETINOL BINDING PROTEINS (FARS) DURING HOST PARASITISM BY RKN MELOIDOGYNE JAVANICA
Kalia Deborah Firester
Hunter College High School, New York, NY

Nematodes are devastating parasitic pests to agriculture, responsible for ~14% of global crop losses, or $100 billion annually (Mitkowski and Abawi, 2003). Historically used fumigants are being banned for broad environmental toxicity, ozone depletion, and danger to human health.<br><br>Nematodes have sophisticated mechanisms for targeting hosts, subverting their defenses, and altering their cells to produce nutrients. Previous research (Firester, 2011) helped identify host chemical pathways induced by nematodes to disable plant defenses. This research investigates the nematode’s secretions – specifically fatty acid and retinol binding proteins (FARs) – used to interfere with hosts’ biochemical processes, to better understand where FARs are used in the parasite life cycle.<br><br>Transgenic tomato plant lines were created: (1) heterologous lines that express Mj-FAR-1 normally secreted by M. javanica nematodes, and (2) RNA interference lines that break down Mj-FAR-1, suppressing its effect. <br><br>Attraction tests determined that infective nematodes differentially sense root exudates and approach and/or enter the different plant lines. While nematodes approached all the roots, a significantly lower percentage entered the heterologous lines. A development test showed that 14 days after inoculation with juvenile nematodes, the heterologous lines contained far more reproductive nematodes than the controls, and the RNA Interference lines had far fewer.<br><br>These results show that external expression/suppression of specific FARs affects the host-entry behavior and development of M. javanica nematodes. This opens up paths to development of safer, natural means of controlling nematodes by leveraging plants’ own defenses, without creating broad or unintended environmental harm.

THE EFFECT OF LOW POWER MICROWAVES ON PLANT GROWTH
Jonathan Rui Xu
Cherry Creek High School, Greenwood Village, CO

Objectives: to determine if microwaves have an effect on plants. Methods: mung beans were soaked for different lengths of time ranging from 0 to 24 hours before being exposed to low power microwaves in periods ranging from 0.5 minutes to 2.5 minutes. The treated mung beans were put on wet paper towels at room temperature to study the treatment effect on germination and early growth. All groups had spent the same three days in water. Germination rates were calculated and compared across soak time and microwave exposure time. Lengths of stems and roots were measured and were fit with a linear model as a function of soak time and microwave exposure time. Observations: The beans suffered a general decrease in stem length, but root length was not affected. Many of the beans that were not soaked in water prior to the experiment suffered deformation after treatment.

MEETING THE FUTURE DEMANDS OF WORLD CROP CONSUMPTION: A NOVEL CONSTRUCTION METHOD FOR THE GENERATION OF DTALE CONSTRUCTS FOR GENOME ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS
Abdullah Hassan Bu Khamsin
Dhahran Ahliyya School, Dammam, SAUDI ARABIA

Statistics show that by 2050, the food production capacity needs to be doubled to meet the rising demands. Genome engineering can be used as a platform for increasing crop yields to meet future demands by inducing stress-tolerant crops. Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) are unique proteins that can be used as customizable DNA binding modules which bind to any user-defined sequences. TALE proteins have been used to generate transcriptional activators and chimeric nucleases for transcriptional modulation or genome editing applications. While the construction of tailored TALEs is vital for many biotechnological applications, assembling TALEs remains difficult due to the complex nature of their nearly identical tandem-repeats. Thus, this project utilizes a straight-forward sequential restriction-ligation step which has been tested in vivo to evaluate its efficiency for tailoring TALE transcription factors (TALE-TFs). This was done by relying on a construction library that contains all of the possible combinations of Repeat Variable Di-Residues (RVDs) in pUCMCS vectors. Five type II restriction enzymes and T4 ligase were then used to convert the tailored construct coupled with the scaffold (dHax3) in an expression vector. This resulted in concentrations of the RVD fragments which ranged from 815 Ng/μl to 7.8 Ng/μl. More importantly, designer TALEs (dTALEs) construction was facilitated in 9.5 hours and was validated using the functional testing findings through the transient expression assays of uidA gene in tobacco leaves. This will pave the way for the implementation of TALEs in genome engineering for a variety of applications in crops.

THE EFFECT OF CYCLIC GUANOSINE-MONOPHOSPATE ON STOMATAL MOVEMENTS
Yara Mohammad Anwar Jan
Manarat Al-Riyadh School, Al-Riyadh, SAUDI ARABIA

Plants are the main source of carbon for humans; they absorb carbon dioxide (Co2) and release oxygen (O2) through stomata pores. In this research it was assumed that when the stomata are exposed to Abscisic acid (ABA) they will close and that the possibility of an interaction between ABA and Cyclic Guanosine-Monophosphate (cGMP) exists. This project investigated the stomatal aperture under four different conditions; Salt solution as a control, ABA as a positive control, cGMP and the combination of cGMP and ABA. The stomatal apertures under the four conditions were measured for four hours each. The experiment met the objective where it showed that the cGMP's effect on the stomatal aperture alone was not significant; t(56)=0.119, p=0.906. The hypothesis was supported by finding a significant difference in the two conditions; t(56)=7.82. p=0 for the ABA condition, t(56)=13.239, p=0 for the combination of cGMP and ABA and cGMP was found to accelerate the effect of ABA on the stomatal aperture, t(58)=11.255, p=0. The results for the interaction between cGMP and ABA in this study will lead to the development of new genes and targets that can be manipulated using modern plant biotechnologies. In the future, engineering of new varieties of these plants will be introduced so that they can thrive even when affected by abiotic stresses, such as salinity and sodicity conditions.

A THIRD YEAR STUDY OF AUDIOTROPISM: USING DESCRIPTIVE AND INFERENTIAL STATISTICAL ANALYSIS IN DATA QUANTIFYING THE PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES IN PHASEOLUS VULGARIS EXPOSED TO AUDIO FREQUENCIES
Angelique Nichole Noles
Port Charlotte High School, Port Charlotte, FL

The experiment tests frequencies in their ability to instigate physiological responses among germinating Phaseolus vulgaris, specifically in height, roots, photosynthesis, and the production of O2 and CO2. To find a frequency that creates this effect would reshape the agricultural industry and pose an alternative to forms of genetic modification.<br><br> Inside a sound-proofed box, for 84-hour trials, the Phaseolus vulgaris were grown over in a hydroponic (with a 1-3-1 nutrient solution) and traditional system, exposed to varying frequencies from no frequency, 100 Hz, 200 Hz, 800 Hz, 900Hz, and 1000 Hz. 16 plants per trial for a total of 24 trials, (totaling 384 plants) has been conducted this year. To test another factor, light was added at 72 hours. O2 and CO2 production was used to ensure the consistency of the experiments trials. Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis was used in examining and solidifying the experimental data.<br><br> Comparing the control groups, 200 Hz caused the sharpest decrease in O2 production, whereas 900 Hz increased CO2 production in the hydroponic and traditional systems. The trials exposed to 800 Hz displayed the most evident negative audiotropic response, increasing the growth of the traditionally grown seeds. However, once 800 Hz was combined with light, only 6.25% of the plants germinated in both systems.<br><br> Consequently this set of frequencies caused an overall negative audiotropic response, with the exception of the traditional system in the 800 Hz trial without light. Evidently the light plays a key role in plants exposed to 800 Hz, opening more room for future research. Audiotropism was present, but in a form opposite of what was hypothesized.

FROM THE POTATO BELT IN PERU TO THE CORN AND SOYBEAN FIELDS OF IOWA: ANALYZING AND USING ORGANIC MATTER AND CARBON CONTENT AS A TOOL FOR EVALUATING FARMING PRACTICES AND THEIR EFFECTS ON GLOBAL WARMING
Sarah Ann Kunch
Holy Trinity Catholic High School, Fort Madison, IA

Soil represents one of the most important storehouses for carbon on earth and accounts for fifteen percent of carbon emissions related to greenhouse gasses. Soil carbon levels vary dependent on the type of agricultural and land use systems. There are wide variations in the levels and stability of carbon stored in the soil, depending on land use, type of crop, climate, precipitation, and elevation. Agriculture techniques also respond to the amount of carbon being released into the air from the soil. For my internship at the International Potato Center in Lima, Peru, I was given tasks to compliment a sector of a research project involving tracking the amount of carbon released from carbon stocks in soil at different altitudes in the Andes Mountain Range in southern Peru. When I came home from my internship, I wanted to create a project similar to work done at CIP and observe organic matter and carbon in soil of corn and soybean fields in Iowa and see the effect of current farming practices on global warming. The purpose of my research is to look at the Soil Organic Matter (SOM) differences between till versus no-till fields of both soybeans and corn in Lee County, Iowa. I will also look for differences in amount of carbon at different altitude heights throughout the county. My hypotheses include that soybean fields will contain more SOM than corn fields, that no-till fields will contain more SOM than tilled fields, that SOM levels are greater at lower altitude levels. Samples were gathered from random fields throughout Lee County, Iowa. Tests were completed on 21 different sites in Lee County, Iowa including tilled and no tilled fields of both corn and soybeans. A total of 153 samples were analyzed for % SOM and for % organic carbon. My first two hypotheses were upheld by my research - soybean fields have a higher percentage of SOM than corn fields and non-tilled fields have greater SOM than tilled fields. Although my research supports both of these hypotheses, I feel that more testing with greater amount of samples as well as varied testing periods throughout the year before during and after planting would give me better results and a more accurate picture of what is happening with the carbon content in the soil. My third hypothesis was not upheld. There was no pattern to the amount of SOM or organic carbon as the altitude level dropped.

THE THRESHOLD OF CO2 FERTILIZATION EFFECT ON THE GROWTH OF TRITICUM AESTIVUM
Jessica Chen Xu
High Technology High School, Lincroft, NJ

This experiment studied the impacts of elevated CO2 concentrations on Triticum aestivum and, specifically, the threshold of CO2 fertilization effect on plant growth. Plants were grown in five separate growth chambers of varying CO2 concentrations (400, 600, 800, 1000, or 1200 parts per million). After 31 days, the biomass, plant height, leaf length and width, stomata density and length, and gas exchange measurements were collected. After data analysis, the plotted biomass curve was fitted with a quadratic model and the optimal CO2 concentration with the maximum biomass was calculated (886 ppm) to determine the threshold of CO2 fertilization effect. Plant heights and leaf lengths weren't significantly affected by CO2, but CO2 significantly affected leaf width (p<0.05). Increasing CO2 concentrations generally decreased stomatal density on both the adaxial and abaxial leaf sides. A distinct bell-shaped relationship exists between stomatal length and CO2, peaking at 865 ppm and 863 ppm on the adaxial and abaxial sides, respectively. <br><br>Leaf net photosynthetic rate increased by 111.8% from 400 ppm to 800 ppm and decreased after its peak of 967.8 ppm. Leaf dark respiration generally decreased linearly with increase of CO2. However, stomatal conductance decreased non-linearly with the increase of CO2 concentration, following a quadratic relationship. <br><br>The maximum carboxlyation rate (Vcmax) and the ratio of Vcmax to the maximum electron transport rate (Jmax) peaked at 895.9 ppm and 824.5 ppm, respectively. The Jmax curve is more complicated. A minimum value of Jmax was near 550 ppm, yet a maximum occurred at about 1000 ppm. The results indicated that both stomatal behavior and biochemical processes may be involved in determining the threshold of the CO2 fertilization effect.

PURPOSE: To determine the effects of natural extracts and agricultural fungicides on the growth and aggregate quality of soybeans. Secondly, to compare fungicidal attributes of natural extracts to those of agricultural fungicides. <br><br>PROCEDURES: Collected two types of weed flowers (Curly Cup Gumweed and Missouri Goldenrod) and three chemical fungicides (Headline, Stratego and Quadris). Prepared 20:1 dilutions of natural extracts and utilized field application rates for the fungicides. TEST PLOT STUDY: Soybean Test Plot: Observed the effect of the two natural extracts and three commercial fungicides on the growth and development of soybeans. KIRBY BAUER: Ascertained the inhibitory properties of the natural extracts and commercial fungicides on the growth of two soybean fungal pathogens 100 times for each fungus. FUNGAL APPLICATION TEST: Sought the solutions’ inhibitory properties on white mold placed on the soybean plant. WORM DIRECT CONTACT: To observe the effects of the products on a beneficial annelid (nightcrawler). pH: Determined the acidic or basic reading of each natural extract and fungicide. <br><br>CONCLUSION: In the Test Plot Study, Curly Cup Gumweed was found to be most beneficial to soybeans. From Kirby Bauer, Curly Cup Gumweed most effectively inhibited the growth of pathogenic fungi. In the Fungal Application Test, Curly Cup Gumweed inhibited the growth of the mold the best. In Worm Direct Contact, I found that Headline garnered the most active worms. Overall, I feel that natural extracts, especially Curly Cup Gumweed, could potentially have a revolutionary impact on the soybean industry.

Dre Erik Howard Steinwehr
Hankinson High School, Hankinson, ND

PURPOSE: To compare the effects of polyphenol and commercial insecticides on a Zea mays cultivar. Secondly, to examine the effects of the solutions on the yield and efficiency of ethanol production.<br><br>PROCEDURE: Collect two natural insecticides (Green Tea and Grape Seed) along with two commonly used agricultural insecticides. A Test Plot Study was performed to see how the insecticides affected the corn plant in its natural field setting. ECB pheromone Trapping was executed to determine if European Corn Borer incidences existed in Southeast North Dakota. The Insect Drop Method was performed to test the fatality rates of the biopesticides on three corn insects. Mycotoxin Quantitative Test was utilized to determine if the insecticide applications could reduce the amount of toxin-producing fungi on the corn. An Ethanol Production Analysis was conducted to observe the direct effects of the biopesticides on the yield and efficiency of corn fermentation for the purpose of ethanol creation.<br><br>RESULTS: In the Test Plot Study, Green Tea showed the most beneficial properties toward the corn. In the ECB Pheromone Trapping, an incidence of European Corn Borers in Southeast North Dakota was identified. From the Drop Method, Spinosad proved to be the most lethal to the three types of harmful insects. In the Ethanol Study, Green Tea was found to have beneficial properties toward mycotoxin levels and ethanol production.<br><br>CONCLUSION: After analyzing all aspects of this research, I found that Green Tea was the superior solution. Overall, I feel that polyphenol extracts, such as Green Tea, can be used as promotants for Zea mays, in addition to harboring vast potential for the agricultural community.

DROUGHT RINGS
Sherlauna Lee Ann Hancock
Silver High School, Silver City, NM

The purpose for my project was to detect if there was evidence of drought in the last ten to twenty years according to the tree ring thickness around Silver City, New Mexico, USA. Drought is mainly lack of precipitation, however temperature rises, typography and many other factors also contribute. This makes it hard to correlate any one variable to the size of the tee rings, because it is a combination of a large number of variables. The procedure was conducted as follows: I took core samples from fifty Ponderosa pines in various locations outside of Silver City, sanded them, examined them under a microscope, and averaged my findings going back fifty years. Reading the tree rings is not always clear; there are false rings and faint rings that are not measured correctly due to human and technological error. Despite the false and overlooked rings in the samples I collected it is shown in the data that the last twenty years have smaller rings on average, which shows that drought, according to the tree ring sizes can be noticed in the Silver City area.

ANALYSIS OF CRT1 PROTEIN FAMILY DIMERIZATION IN PLANT IMMUNE RESPONSES
Chamath Sameera Dharmasiri
Wimberley High School, Wimberley, TX

In order to combat pathogenic attacks, plants have evolved mechanisms to recognize certain effectors secreted by pathogens. This recognition in turn induces effector-triggered immune responses that are critical for plant survival. Literary research showed that a genetic screen of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants displaying compromised resistance to the turnip crinkle virus (TCV) via defective effector-triggered immune responses identified CRT1 (compromised for the recognition of the turnip crinkle virus). Similarly, literature also showed that crh6, another gene in the CRT1 gene family, was identified as a critical component in epigenetic silencing which is also critical for anti-viral resistance in plants. These observations rose the possibility that CRT1 family proteins may function together in plant immunity perhaps via dimerization. In Arabidopsis, the CRT1 family consists of 7 genes. This study examined which CRT1 family members dimerize with each other, by using the yeast 2-hybrid technique, a popular assay for protein-protein interactions. Additionally, the study also aimed to identify the region of the CRT1 protein essential for dimerization, by serially truncating the potential dimerization region. Interestingly, the results reveal that CRT1 formed a dimer with CRT1 as well as CRH6. Furthermore, we also found a coiled coil domain in the area that is required for the dimerization. Note that the coiled-coil motif is historically the first dimerization domain identified. It can be concluded that together, these data support the possibility that the CRT1 family proteins function as a dimer that plays a critical role in plant resistance to pathogens.

IT'S TEA TIME: LIGHT-INDUCED ANTIOXIDANT PRODUCTION IN TEA (CAMELLIA SINENSIS)
Matthew Ken Sueda
Waiakea High School, Hilo, HI

The relationship between light treatment and subsequent pigment production and stress-related gene expression in tea (Camellia sinensis) was analyzed. A developing tea industry in Hawai‘i has enormous potential for success in the high-end sector of the market, and being able to understand the effects of light treatment on tea will allow local farmers to adjust their growing practices and produce better quality crops. The expression of four genes—phytoene synthase (PSY), light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding (Lhcb), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione S-transferase (GST)—was measured under high light and low light conditions via RT-qPCR and gel electrophoresis. Higher levels of PSY and APX gene expression were seen in shaded plants; fluctuations in Lhcb gene expression indicate a complex relationship between light and shade; and GST RT-qPCR was not optimized so data could not be used. Pigment content was obtained through spectrophotometry, which revealed higher levels of chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments in shaded plants. Findings suggest that shade treatment of tea potentially maximizes antioxidant content, resulting in a product of higher quality that can benefit both consumers and Hawai‘i tea growers alike.

REPROCESSING COMPONENTS OF MILK FROM FOLIAR APPLICATION TO AUGMENT PROTEIN SYNTHESIS IN TRITICUM AESTIVUM
Jordan Ray Cadle
Paoli Junior/Senior High School, Paoli, IN

This project explores an organically friendly way to help lower the rates of world hunger by the use of milk. The supreme concepts behind the idea use milk to induce the reproduction of wheat earlier in the growing season, decrease the amount of work to produce starch chains, and provide extra energy to the plant during the reproductive phase. Milk was applied to the wheat at various concentrations following pollination in a Latin square plot. The yield, protein, calories, and test weight increased with the more milk applied. Not always statistically significant at the 90% confidence interval, the quadratic curves fitted to the data had coefficients of determination above 0.99. The equation for the yield increase is y = 4E-07x2 + 2E-05x - 0.074 where x is the treatment rate of milk per hectare and y is the percent change. Based on the United States predicted acreage for the 2013 growing year, an application rate of 500 liters per hectare with a current yield at 4.8 metric tons would provide enough energy for an additional 50,000 people that consume 600 calories per day for a year.<br><br> From this test, farmers can lower world hunger by applying milk through foliar means to increase wheat yields. However, along with the increase of yields comes a higher input cost that must be considered with current market conditions. The milk is accessible in underdeveloped and emerging nations. The more milk applied, the better the outcome to suit the solution to the current global issue.

THE ACCLIMATION OF SPARTINA ALTERNIFLORA TO VARIOUS SALINE CONCENTRATIONS: A CONTINUATION
Grace Marie Ragland, Anna Maxwell
Saint Joseph's Academy, Baton Rouge, LA

Spartina alterniflora is a common marsh grass that grows along coastlines in fresh ans salt water. The researchers were interested in growing Spartina alterniflora in salt water and fresh water to determine overall growth and height of the plants. The purpose of the third experiment, conducted this school year, was to determine which of the seven breeding lines of Spartina alterniflora grew best in a 35 parts per thousand salt water. The researchers also had the seven breeding lines growing in a control fresh water as well. The result of the experiment was that the Vermillion group, which was used as a control, did in fact grow better than the other breeding lines, as predicted. Although, the other breeding lines did grow very well and withstand the 35 parts per thousand salt water as well.

Jaqueline Campos Costa, Cristopher Carvalho, Julia Ferreira
Escola Estadual Manoel Antonio de Sousa, Mateus Leme, BRASIL

The plant Arrabidaea chica (Bonpl.) B. Verl., Bignoniaceae, is commonly used in the Amazon region as anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and antianaemic. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of A. chica extracts in hematological parameters in Swiss mice, and also to determine the growing, botanical and histochemical characteristics of A. chica in order to provide information of the biological activity, cultivation, taxonomical identification and quality control of this medicinal plant. Leaves of A. chica were extracted with two distinct solvents, ethanol and water. The phytochemical analysis of the extracts in the infrared region of the spectrum indicated different classes of secondary metabolites. Ethanol and aqueous extracts increased significantly (p<0.05) the concentration of erythrocyte, haematocrit, haemoglobin and white blood cells in the mice after 45 days of oral treatment. The growth test of A. chica under different shading percentages (0% (full sunlight), 20, 50 and 70%) demonstrated that plants under 70% of shading had the higher growth, accumulated biomass and total chlorophyll concentration after 300 days of treatment. The botanical analyses demonstrated that the leaves are trifoliate and have claspers, the cuticle is striated, and the stomata are anisocytic. The stem presents a parenchymal and sclerenchymatous structure, together with the conductive tissue. The histochemical tests showed the presence of triterpenes, phenols, tannins and alkaloids mainly localized in the leaves. This study confirmed the potential of A. chica as an antianemic agent and as an assistant in cancer treatment confirming its use in traditional popular medicine.

Liceo de Cariari, Pococi, COSTA RICA

The purpose of this research is to carry out an inventory, classification, and georeferentiation of the macrofungi in the area of La Argentina, in Cariari, Limon. This research studies the importance of these fungi, their properties and their functions, known to our ancestors but quite unknown today, regarding their potential for ecological, medical, alimentary, and agro-industrial applications, among others. The influence of abiotic factors upon macrofungi abundance and diversity was compared with the data obtained in a previous research, performed in September 2011 (rainy season). Our current sample consisted of 34 individuals collected in March 2012 (dry season), over a 52,978 m2 area, and a comparison between the resulting data of both seasons. The research methodology started with the collection of macrofungi across the riverbank area, followed by the georeferentiation, numbering, labeling, and photographic recording of each sample. Once the material was identified through bibliographic references, it was sent for confirmation to INBio, CeNAT, and UCR experts. In order to estimate the existing abundance and diversity of macrofungi, several statistical analyses were conducted based on the following tests: Cochran’s Q test and the Indices of Diversity of Menhinick, Margalef, and Gleason. The analyses showed that there is no significant difference in macrofungi abundance and diversity in that area, during the dry and rainy seasons. Thirty-four macrofungi were finally obtained, belonging to the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota phyla, and differing greatly in shape, color, substratum, size, and applications, some of the latter still undefined.

GROWTH OF TRITICUM AESTIVUM IN RESPONSE TO ZNO NANOPARTICLES IN SOIL
Tommy Fang, Jean-Luc Watson
Logan High School, Logan, UT

The deficiency of Zn in soils is a global concern. Our project evaluates the growth of common wheat, Triticum aestivum, in response to ZnO nanoparticles so as to understand how Zn is used by the plant. The ZnO nanoparticles have a negative effect on root length for plants grown seven days in sand, confirming previous literature, but increased microbranching. In an agricultural soil, the ZnO nanoparticles increased root length in addition to microbranching. Using atomic absorbance spectroscopy, the shoots grown with ZnO nanoparticles were shown to have significantly higher amounts of zinc in both sand and soil i.e. the zinc in the ZnO nanoparticles was bioavailable. Humic acid is a complex organic material found in soils that could modify the nanoparticle responses. Thus, to simulate the conditions found in soil, sand was amended with humic acid at three levels, equivalent to that extracted from soil, four-fold higher and four-fold lower. The humic acid additions with the nanoparticles caused the plants to grow without a negative effect on root length, although root microbranching was maintained. Our project shows the use of ZnO nanoparticles helped plants grow better in soil and provided a long-term source of Zn. This material could replace the current method of using Zn salts as fertilizer. A ZnO nanoparticle product is relatively cheap and easily accessible and transportable, providing the potential to change the lives’ of the 2.5 billion people dependent on wheat as a staple source of food.

COUNTERACTING THE CONIFEROUS CATASTROPHE: INVESTIGATING PREVENTATIVE THERAPIES FOR PINE WILT DISEASE
Elizabeth Le, Megan Rolke
Soutmoore High School, Moore, OK

Pine Wilt Disease (PWD) has been devastating forests, lumber industries, and landscaping for decades without a reasonable treatment. The main solution today involves burning an affected tree to stop the disease from dispersing. The purpose of this project is to efficiently treat the disease without harming the tree. The Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (pine wood nematode) is the primary factor of PWD. Solutions of cinnamon, garlic, pumpkin, copper sulfate, and arsenic were tested at various molarities to determine the effect on the nematodes to evaluate how powerful the substance must be in order to have the mortality rate of at least 50%. The molarities of the solutions tested against the nematodes were 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5. Copper sulfate had the strongest effect towards the nematodes because at every molarity the heavy metal demonstrated that there was a 100% mortality rate at 0.25 M. As we assumed that arsenic would have the highest mortality rate at the lowest molarity, yet our results showed that at the highest molarity arsenic was nearly 50%. Garlic reached the mortality rate at 0.5. Cinnamon reached the 50% death rate at 1.0. Pumpkin had little affect on the nematodes at every molarity tested. The solution’s results were further evaluated on infected and uninfected trees. The results indicated that the infection process worked properly, but there were other factors that go beyond what was experimented on. Therefore,this research indicated that further studies are necessary.

THE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE LPS-INDUCED HYPERSENSITIVE RESPONSE IN CERATOPTERIS RICHARDII
Samantha Hayley DiSalvo, Ryan Kenny, Amy Vitha
George W. Hewlett High School, Hewlett, NY

Pathogenic phytobacteria often have devastating impacts on agricultural production. Thus, understanding the mechanisms by which plants respond to and resist the virulence of bacterial infection is critical. The Hypersensitive Response (HR) is a plant defense strategy that involves a programmed cell death in tissues surrounding the infection site. This process has been extensively characterized at the physiological level but poorly understood at the molecular level. In this study, the gametophytes of Ceratopteris richardii were explored as a model to study the HR. Using lipopolysaccharides(LPS) isolated from the opportunistic plant pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, it was demonstrated that a dosage of 0.5mg/ml is sufficient to stimulate the HR in developing gametophytes. Basal cells, containing rhizoids, and peripheral cells of the prothalli were first cells to display induced cell death by LPS. In addition, a thickening of the cell walls can be observed between dead and viable cells. Premature senescence and lack of fertilization of gametophytes prevented sporophyte development. Moreover, pretreatment of dry spores with LPS before light induction resulted in delayed germination of spores and decreased cell division in prothalli. Using RT-PCR, it was demonstrated that these physiological responses to LPS are accompanied by an initial increase of orthologues of a Group I WRKY Transcription Factor and a Pathogenesis Related Protein-1, identified from the EST library of Ceratopteris richardii. These genes are up-regulated within the first 24 hours of LPS exposure; however, the levels decreased as tissues degenerated. Incubation of sterilized dry spores with siRNA of CrWRKY resulted in gametophytes with reduced cell death when exposed to LPS.

EVALUATING THE PRESENCE OF PERONOSPORA IN THE SALINAS VALLEY AND ANALYZING THE DNA SEQUENCE SIMILARITY IN DOWNY MILDEW PATHOGENS AFFECTING SPINACH AND BEET IN CALIFORNIA
Aradhana Sinha, Kapil Sinha
Salinas High School, Salinas, CA

Downy mildew, caused by the plant pathogen Peronospora effusa, is one of the most destructive plant pathogens across the globe, and a major production constraint on spinach in California and Arizona. Peronospora effusa infects spinach, but P. farinosa f. sp. betae and P. farinosa f. sp. cicla do not. Rather, P. farinosa f. sp. betae and f. sp. cicla cause downy mildew on beet and Swiss chard. Morphologically, however, the spinach pathogen and the beet and Swiss chard pathogens are indistinguishable. We have repeatedly found filaments and oospores of Peronospora spp. on commercial seed as well as on plants in the valley. Fungicides cannot control the pathogen unless it is detected early. At the same time application of fungicides are costly, time-consuming, and may stain leaves--rendering even healthy plants unmarketable. There is a need to be able to quickly and accurately distinguish the pathogen that causes the disease on spinach from the ones that cannot infect spinach, so that seeds and plants alike may be screened. We address this need by sequencing an internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, and finding genetic variations between the two species. Markers or High-Resolution Melting Analysis may be used to easily distinguish these species. Next, a phylogenetic tree was created to better understand how the species are related. Peronospora farinosa f.sp. betae and f.sp. cicla have the exact same ITS sequence. Interestingly they are both more closely related to the P. effusa than to other P. farinosa that attack the Chenopodiaceae family of plants. Further research should be done to determine whether these two groups should also be considered a separate species. Additional research is also necessary to determine whether the Peronospora spp. on spinach seed is viable.

EXAMINING VITAMIN-ENRICHED TAGETES TENUIFOLIA DEVELOPMENT
Dillon Gregory Sienko, Patrick Monette
Westfield High School, Westfield, MA

The purpose of this project was to determine the effect of organic vitamin supplements on the growth and development of Tagetes tenuifolia, an annual marigold plant. It may be possible to use these vitamins in place of synthetic or organic chemicals and compounds to produce more effective and efficient growth in plants. Each of 33 planter’s pods was filled with equal amounts of potting soil and three seeds. Each of ten vitamins (A, B1, B3, B6, B7, B12, C, D, E, and F) was separately added to each of three pods. The remaining three pods represented the control group and had no vitamins added. Each<br><br>pod was watered daily with 20 ml of tap water and watered twice a week with the corresponding vitamin solution. At weekly intervals the health of the plants was determined by measuring growth rate, number of leaves, stem and leaf color, flower diameter and the number of petals.<br><br>Vitamins B1 and B3 were found to have the most beneficial effects on the health and development of the plants. These vitamins produced plants that were fast growing (1.417 and 1.518 cm/day, respectively), full (140.9 and 108 average leaves per plant, respectively), vibrant,<br><br>and healthy in all data considered. In an era where ”green” methods and eco-friendly growth techniques are becoming increasingly important, these results could mean commercial success and long term sustainability, as well as potential health benefits to the humans consuming these improved vitamin enriched crops.

Americas High School, El Paso, TX

The purpose of our project is to find out how electromagnetic radiation and the ionization of air affect the plant growth and seed germination. If the flowers are exposed to electromagnetic radiation and ionized air (ozone), will it have the same effect from the previous set of plants that were tested, and will the second generation of bean plants inherit its parent’s traits.<br><br>To begin testing, heat up a metal rod and puncture a hole on the bottom of each plastic cup. Plant one two sets of ten flowering plants with one seed in each. Plant the second-generation seeds in individual cups (three seeds in each). Place each set of plants in an individual plastic tray. Build the project enclosure needed to experiment with the tesla coil which is then grounded to the enclosure. Place the one set of plants inside the enclosure. While the plants are in the enclosure, the tesla coil will be operating for two hour intervals. The other set of ten will be kept as the away from radiation and be used to compare after twenty days with the radiated plants. During this period, keep documentation of measurements (cm) for both sets of plants and the second-generation bean plants.<br><br>After a month of experimentation, the flowering plants were documented and compared. We discovered that when exposed to electromagnetic radiation, they exhibited similar results to previous tests. However, they became entirely miniature. The second-generation bean plants inherited the parent’s genome but grew larger than if radiated full-time.

The workpaper investigated the impact of environmental quality indexes, the meteorological and optical phenomena on the growth, distress and recovery rate of the test plants. It was examined the mechanism of photosynthesis and transpiration in the chlorophyll parts of plants, under normal ambient temperature, under the influence of wind, humidity, the UV, V and IR radiation spectrum. It was monitored the dynamics of the recovery process of test plants after having been exposed to stress.<br><br>The environmental factors, in general, and the electromagnetic waves from a wide range of wavelengths, in particular, influence the dynamics or processes that occur at the molecular level. The Optical, ionized radiation, and the wind activates the stomata's opening, through the terminal cells of leaves, affecting upward the rate of plants transpiration.<br><br>Upon the monitoring of the growth, transpiration and recovery phenomena, the amount of the water consumed by the plant in a certain time interval was recorded. The absorption bands related to the light molecules of the atmosphere on the leaf surface and the examination of the vibrational structure in plants of different age, were investigated through FTIR spectroscopy and FL. Photoluminescence excitation was performed with He-Ne laser radiation .<br><br>The reflection spectra at 30 incident was raised in the wave number range from 7800 cm-1 to 200 cm-1 of the test plant leaves aged from 26 to 60 days. Spectra R (Y) contain simultaneous vibration and rotation of molecules of H2O, CO, Co2 and OH bonds of minerals and those that are influenced by certain environmental factors.

Punta Las Cucharas Natural Reserve is located in the Las Canas sector in Ponce, Puerto Rico. This area was declared a Natural Reserve on August 9, 2008 by the government of Puerto Rico. The hypothesis for this research was: Punta Las Cucharas Natural Reserve in Ponce, Puerto Rico will have a more abundant and diverse marine flora compared to that of a nearby tourist coastal area. For this study, six transects were marked from west to east in the shore at intervals of 25 meters each and at intervals of one meter up to 50 meters offshore. Each transect was studied to find out the marine flora that was present in every square meter through it. Furthermore, phytoplankton samples were collected to identify the organisms that were present. The data obtained evidences that the marine flora of the reserve proved to have a more diverse and abundant marine flora than the one of the tourist beach in the nearby area. Four different species of seagrass, 24 species of algae, and more than 32 species of phytoplankton were identified. Educational workshops and educational materials such as a video and a brochure were produced for the general public to let them know about this natural reserve and its marine flora. A comparison of the results of the pre and posttests offered during the workshops evidenced a high percentage of educational achievement in all questions. An abundant marine flora can have positive impacts on ecological, economical, touristic and educational aspects in that area.

SELF WATERING POTTED HOME GARDEN

The purpose of this investigation was to design a self-watering home garden using the physical characteristics of capillary action. The established hypothesis was: if we use capillary action between water and soil, a home garden can be mantained for approximately 7 days without the need to water the plants. This way a high quality harvest will be obtained since the plants will absorb the necessary water amount. Another goal was to learn more about the physical properties of capillary action, and how it can be applied to daily life. To mantain a developing home garden plastic boxes used for general storage of items were used. These boxes had two divisions where the water was on the bottom, and the soil on top. Between the two sides, there was a wick that connected these sections of the self-watering home garden. The process of capillary action occured in this wick in order for the water to be absorbed by the soil. After the plants were transplanted, it was noted that the self-watering container mantained the level of water at all moments in conjunction with the water from rain during the observation period. The control group which was watered manually didn't sustain a healthy state. Those later died and another control had to be planted. It was concluded that the self-watering container is self-sufficient and can mantain high quality crops for 14 days. This system could be developed so homes can have their own home garden in a short period of time, with minimal attention, and manteinance.

FACTORS AFFECTING THE RESPONSE OF VENUS FLYTRAP

Venus flytraps (Dionaea muscipula), a well-known carnivorous plant, can snap their trap-like leaves to catch and digest insects. Since inhabiting infertile area, the success of their catches is critical for their survival. Their snapping are initiated by stimulation of trigger hairs lying on upper epidermal surface of the leaves. However, their detailed snapping behavior has rarely been investigated in Thai agricultural sites. Our objective is therefore to study the effect of various stimuli on Venus flytrap snapping behavior. Those potential stimuli include the air humidity, the numbers of trigger hairs stimulated, and the amount of touching forces. According to our experiments, the angle between lobes is affected by varying degree of humidity. In addition, the snapping angular velocity was affected by varying numbers of trigger hairs stimulated. Moreover, we investigate minimal intensities of touching forces applied to the trigger hairs to initiate the snapping mechanism. From these results, we could further understand the snapping behavior of Venus flytraps and find their proper plantation in botanical and agricultural fields. This may also indicate the strategy to obtain nutrients from prey with optimal energy spent for snapping.

EFFECTS OF DROUGHT ON KANSAS TURF GRASSES
Steven Callahan Aker, Hayley Disney
Northeast Magnet High School, Bel Aire, KS

This study investigated effects of drought on three species of turf grasses commonly grown in Kansas. Tall fescue is a “cool season” grass, known to require abundant water. In contrast, buffalo grass is a “warm season” grass known to be highly tolerant of drought. Bermuda grass is another “warm season” grass commonly planted in lawns and golf courses. All three species were subjected to three watering treatments: (i) well watered, (ii) normal watering, and (iii) drought. Weekly tests were completed on turf quality, leaf chlorophyll content, photosynthesis, and water potential. There was variation in drought tolerance between species. Tall fescue was most sensitive to decreasing water, as plants had decreased turf quality, chlorophyll, and photosynthesis in the drought treatment. In contrast, buffalo and Bermuda grass had higher drought tolerance. Turf quality was not reduced by drought, and chlorophyll and photosynthesis rates were less sensitive to drought compared to tall fescue. Superior drought tolerance of buffalo grass might come from its low water potential. Buffalo grass had low water potential in all treatments, whereas tall fescue and Bermuda grass only lowered water potential in drought treatments. In dry climates, a green lawn of buffalo grass would be possible with half the water input required to maintain a green lawn of tall fescue. Results of this study might lead to reduction of water use, slower depletion of natural resources, less polluted runoff, more attractive turf with less maintenance, and a more holistically sustainable future for Kansas and other drought-affected areas.

Duc Thanh Nguyen, Hoang Tran
Nguyen Hue High School, Hanoi, VIETNAM

The plant Baeckea frutescens L. grows abundantly on heathland and is widely distributed in Australia, China, and Southeast Asia (including Vietnam). B. frutescens is traditionally used as a cure for various symptoms such as headache, fever, catarrh and rheumatism, while the B. frutescens stem is utilized for fence making and the leaves are usually left out. This study presents valuable insect-repelling property of the essential oil extracted from B. frutescens leaves. GC-MS analysis of the essential oil revealed no harmful substances, while several substances with recorded insect repelling property were found. Comparative experiments with flies, mosquitoes, ants, and maize weevils indicated a great insect-repelling effect of the essential oil. Ants were prevented from entering places previously applied with the oil for up to 22 hours. The oil was moderately effective against Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with a complete protection time of approximately 16 minutes and a general protection time of 1 hour. Noticeably, B. frutescens oil repelled nearly 100% of the Musca domestica flies in the experiment box. Finally, the oil was able to repel 60% of the Sitophilus zeamais maize weevils existed in corn seeds and powder. Various test products such as incense and candles were made in order to compensate for the fast evaporation rate of the essential oil and showed considerable lasting effect.<br><br>Keywords: Baeckea frutescens L., insect repellent, essential oil, ants, mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti, flies, Musca domestica, maize weevils, Sitophilus zeamais

In our project we tested the effects of fertilizer on algal growth in diverse habitats. We hypothesized that if the saltwater kills the algae then the Miracle-Gro pond water would allow the algae to grow substantially. To do so we purchased one hundred sterile, air tight containers that could contain a volume of 4.5 ounces. We acquired six vials of Mougetia algae and researched four commonly used fertilizers that farmers use today, which consisted of, organic compost, organic Miracle-Gro, cow manure, and a mix of the compost and Miracle-Gro. Then for our diverse habitats we obtained water from a local pond and distilled water purchased from a local grocery store. Then we also collected water from the faucet (tap water), finally we created our own salt water solution and estuary solution using correct ratios. Soon after, we measured equal amounts of the liquid solutions, fertilizer amounts, and Mougetia algae into each container. For each type of marine habitat we had four trials each, with one control. We then measured the weight of each container every day for a four week period. Each day for every type of fertilizer we averaged out the weights while subtracting the weight of the sterilized containers and the weight of the amount of added fertilizer and algae.
