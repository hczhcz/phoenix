SQUEEZING OUT HEAVY METALS FROM LIVING SPONGES
Kendra Roseann Mackett
Satellite High School, Satellite Beach, FL, United States

Lead poisoning is an ongoing medical problem that affects people of all ages. Although the government banned lead based paint in 1978, it continues to pose a danger to those who live in houses built before that year. Even deteriorated paint results in harmful lead dust. There are currently 890,000 children ages 1-5 that have blood levels above what is deemed safe. Chelation therapy is commonly used to treat serious lead poisoning, however it has many drawbacks. Chelation therapy is very lengthy, expensive, and often very painful for the patient. In addition to removing lead, it depletes the body of its essential minerals. <br><br>The first part of this project is to find an organic acid to serve as an effective chelating agent for lead poisoning. Once identified, the agent will then be used to decrease heavy metal toxins from live spongilla. The nature in which spongilla accommodate for filtering large amounts of water through their bodies is similar to the way the human blood capillary system utilizes gas exchange between blood and tissues.<br><br>The organic acids tested include lactic, citric, acetic, and ascorbic acid. With the use of an Inductively Coupled Argon Plasma Spectrometer (ICAP), the effect of the acids was calculated. After analyzing the testing, acetic acid proved most successful in removing lead. The acetic acid’s performance with the live specimens, fresh water spongilla, as determined with the ICAP machine also proved effective.<br><br>

STRUCTURAL STUDIES ON THE O-ANTIGEN OF CITROBACTER YOUNGAE O9
Olga Gennadievna Ovchinnikova
Moscow Chemical Lyceum, Moscow, Russia

Bacteria Citrobacter are non-pathogenic normal inhabitants of the intestinal tract. Strains of Citrobacter are serologically heterogeneous owing to the structural diversity of the cell-wall lipopolysaccharide. Aiming at creation of the molecular basis for classification of Citrobacter, we investigate the O-specific polysaccharide chains (O-antigens) of the lipopolysaccharides of various serogroups. Now we report the structure of the O-antigen of Citrobacter youngae O9.<br><br> The lipopolysaccharide of C. youngae O9, strain PCM 1538, was isolated by extraction of killed, non-viable cells provided by Prof. A. Gamian (Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, Wroclaw, Poland). The lipopolysaccharide was degraded with dilute acetic acid under mild conditions, and the resultant polysaccharides were isolated by gel-permeation chromatography and studied by sugar and methylation analyses along with 1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopy, including 2D 1H,1H COSY, TOCSY, NOESY, and 1H, 13C HSQC experiments. It was found that the O-antigen consists of two structurally different polysaccharides. One of them is an a-1->2-linked homopolymer of 2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-D-mannose (N-acetyl-perosamine) and the other is composed of regularly alternating a- and b-1->3-linked N?acetyl-perosamine residues and thus consists of disaccharide repeating units. The former is identical to one of two polysaccharides found earlier in C. gillenii PCM 1537 from the same serogroup O9, whereas the latter is different. These data and serological studies in the Prof. A. Gamian's laboratory show the expediency of division of serogroup O9 to two subgroups.<br><br>

PALLADIUM AND PLATINUM CATALYZED HYDROSELENATION OF ALKYNES
Denis Alexandrovich Malyshev
Moscow Chemical Lyceum, Moscow, Russia

Nowadays selenium compounds are of interest because of their wide application in such fields as material science (as precursors of semi-conducting and advanced optical materials), medicine and organic synthesis. The development of appropriate methodology for the preparation of these compounds in technology optimized and non-toxic way is of great importance in modern chemistry.<br><br> This work is focused on transition metal catalyzed phenylselenol addition to alkynes. This methodology allows to perform chemical transformations with 100% atom efficiency because all selenium atoms become bonded to carbon-carbon network with no waste materials formed. Therefore, all the synthetic procedures developed meet modern requirements of green chemistry.<br><br> Catalysis with transition metal complexes facilitates highly regio- and stereoselective chemical transformations, which allow to obtain the desired products in good yields under mild conditions. We have studied platinum and palladium catalyzed chemical reactions using zerovalent metal complexes as catalysts – Pt(PPh3)4 and Pd(PPh3)4. We discovered that phenylselonol underwent the oxidative addition to the metal center to form the intermediate [H-Pt-SePh] complex detected by NMR spectroscopy. In reaction with alkynes the latter complex gives vinylselonol derivatives with high selectivity. Detailed mechanistic study has been undertaken using modern two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy as well as other physical methods (MS, X-ray).<br><br> The present work has demonstrated the efficiency of addition reactions combined with high selectivity of catalytic transformations, which provides reliable method for preparation of selenium-containing organic compounds.<br><br>

RATIONAL DESIGN OF A GENERAL OPTICAL SENSOR FOR BIOLOGICAL AGENTS
Gregory Ignatius Gellene, Frenship High School
Wolfforth, TX, USA 79382

Electronic structure calculations (B3LYP/6-31G*) are performed to develop new optical sensors for biological agents following the receptor-reporter strategy. DNA oligimers are envisioned as being the receptor and they are modeled by a consideration of the single base, guanine. Simple cyanine dyes are chosen as the reporter. The sensors are constructed with the receptor and the reporter covalently bound to each other so that one of the terminal nitrogen of the cyanine dye is also a nitrogen of guanine that participates in base-pair recognition hydrogen bonding with cytosine. Graphical representation allows the occupied pi-orbitals dominantly located on the cyanine to be identified and their calculated energies are used in a novel hybrid free electron/ab initio model to predict the maximum absorption wavelength of the sensor molecule. This model maps the occupied pi-orbital energies onto the allowed energy levels of a one-dimensional finite well potential through a least-squares optimization of the depth and width parameters defining the well. A particular sensor is evaluated by comparing results obtained for the sensor alone, the sensor hydrogen bonded to water, and the sensor hydrogen bonded to cytosine. The results show that sensor efficiency increases with the length of the cyanine reporter and that useful absorption maximum shifts are predicted only when water hydrogen bonding is replaced with complementary base-pair hydrogen bonding. This second observation suggests that the "reporter base" should be incorporated in the sensor oligimer at a position where it is exposed to water in the absence of analyte binding.

WHAT'S INSIDE AN EGG?
Christopher Hayden Seman
Golden Meadow Middle School, Golden Meadow, LA, U.S.A.

The purpose of this project was to find out the approximate percentage of egg whites versus egg yolks in a grade A large egg by weight and to compare the results of the percentage by weight to the percentage by volume. Since the cholesterol and fat of an egg is in the yolk, people who are watching their cholesterol and diet can still enjoy real eggs. They can change cooking recipes by using 30% of a healthier ingredient, such as fat free milk, or using more egg whites. In my hypothesis, I think the results will not be the same when measuring the egg whites and yolks by volume versus weight and there will be 60% white and 40% yolk when measured by weight.<br><br>In the experiment, I separated the white from the yolk, using an egg separator, onto a scale. I then measured the egg whites in grams and then the egg yolks in grams. I compared the wieght and percentages of the six egg whites and yolks and charted the results.<br><br>The results of the experiment are both written and graphed. The written results show the actual measurements and the rounded measurements of the six egg whites and yolks. The white bar of the graph illustrates the egg white's results and the yellow bar illustrates the egg yolk's results.<br><br>In conclusion, my hypothesis was correct in that the results would not be the same when measuring the egg whites and egg yolks by volume versus weight, but my prediction on percentages was incorrect. After completing the experiments, I discovered that there was 74% egg white and 26% egg yolk.

RE-DOX ACTIVATED NUCLEOPHILIP ADDITION TO BIS-VINILIDENE MANGANESE COMPLEXES
Evgeny V. Kremer
Chemical Lyceum #1303, Moscow, Russia

Abstract has Special Characters. Hard copy on file, pdf will not accept characters. JI 03/27/03 One of the dominant task of modern organometalic chemistry is developing methods of selective formation C-C and C-X bonds (X = O, N, S, halogens etc.). Nucleophilic addition to ligands in transitional metal complexes is the reaction which is widely used to achieve this aim. There many examples of such transformation known for mononuclear transition metal complexes with vinilidene (2,2-dialkyl-1-ethenylidene) ligands. At the same time, before this work no nucleophilic addition processes were known for binuclear complexes with bridge bis-vinilidene ligand (1,3-butadiene-1,4-diylidene ligands). Nucleophilic addition usually proceeds quite better for compounds having positive charge. So, the original idea was to transform initial neutral complexes into positively charged cations and cation-radicals via electron detachment. These particles are far more reactive then neutral complexes. We have studied oxidatively induced nucleophilic addition of water and hydroxide ion to two structurally similar manganese bis-vinilidene complexes [(h5-C5R5)(CO)2Mn=C=CPh]2 (R=H, Me). We discovered that these compounds in the presence of oxidative agent (such as AgBF4•3dioxane and [(ç5-C5H5)2Fe]BF4) undergo nucleophilic addition of water and hydroxide ion forming unusual cyclic complexes with bridge ì2-2,3-diphenyl-dihydrofuran-1,4-diylidene ligand with good yields. The progress of reactions prosecuted was monitored with IR spectroscopy. Detailed mechanistic study has been undertaken using cyclic voltammetry. Structure of all synthesized compounds was proved with X-ray, MS and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. In the present work a new method for preparation O-containing heterocyclic ligands has been demonstrated. These results can also be expanded for obtaining N and S-containing heterocycles.

BUGS AWAY! PHASE II
Kegan K Crouch
Mason High School, Mason, Texas, USA

The project of discussion is a two-year study. In the first year, cedar shavings were tested as an insect repellent incorporated in the production of paper. <br><br>This year I tested cedar paper incorporated into the liner of feed sacks. I used the liners of feed sacks to make paper with and without cedar granules. Although still smaller than a regular feed sack, I did increase the size in order to replicate more closely to the actual size. Two sheets of cedar paper were placed in the liner of one feed sack and two sheets of regular paper in the liner of another feed sack. I poured powdered feed in each of the feed sacks and stacked them with our other feed sacks. I stored the feed sacks for five weeks and counted the weevils each week. The cedar paper placed in the feed sacks repelled the insects the best. The cedar feed sacks were more of a repellent against insects because of the natural repellent, cedar. Because of the oil in the cedar, it is a great repellent.<br><br>

INVESTIGATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF SUPPRESSION ZINC ANODE SELF-DISCHARGE IN GALVANIC ELEMENT WITHOUT MERCURY ADDITION
Zugrya Gumerovna Davydova
Gymnazium #1, Astrakhan, Russia

For suppression self-discharge in chemical sources of current which production in the world is enormous, mercuric compositions are used. Run down batteries are not utilized. it’s a very dangerous source of mercury environment pollution.<br><br> The work is aimed to exclude usage of mercuric compositions from electrolytes for batteries with zinc anode. Working hypothesis is to substitute mercury in electrolyte by zinc corrosion inhibitor, not toxic and acquiring small changes in battery production. With methods of polarized and electrocapillary curves it was defined that when using and storing batteries, zinc surface has negative discharge organic inhibitors of cation and molecular type adsorbing on negatively charged electrode surface were chosen. Corroding tests carried out on the basic of gravimetric and capacity measurings, showed that the most effective additions suppressing zinc corrosion may be hynolin derivatives and their mixtures with other organic compositions. Zinc protection rate with these inhibitors, braking mostly corrosion cathode reaction and slightly influencing anode current-generating process in batteries, reaches 99% and move, exceeding, mercuric inhibitor.<br><br> It is established when measuring electric capacity of galvanic elements with zinc anode that when adding and mercuric inhibitors into electrolyte capacity decreases much more less than without additions. Mercuric and hynolinic inhibitors lead practically to one and the same capacity loss.<br><br> Thus mercury substitution by hynolinic inhibitors of zinc corrosion, doesn’t decrease working battery characteristiñs, but substantially decreases their ecological danger.

ORGANIC CHEMISTRY WITHOUT SOLVENTS
Amber Victoria Irish Hess
Stevenson School, Pebble Beach, California, USA

Organic chemicals are traditionally combined with a solvent before they are able to react with one another. Unfortunately, this process frequently leaves hazardous by-products and contaminated solvents that cannot be re-used, creating problems of disposal. Aldol condensation reactions are one of many commercially important chemical reactions that create by-products that are difficult to eradicate. The purpose of this experiment is to investigate "solvent-free" aldol condensations.<br><br> Solid Veratraldehyde and 1-Indanone were ground together in a mortar and pestle with solid NaOH, a base catalyst. Samples of the mixture were taken at specific time intervals and tested with thin-layer chromatography (TLC). Upon discovering that the TLC spots for the reaction product overlapped those of Veratraldehyde, I developed an innovative and widely applicable technique for digitally enhancing the faint color of the reaction product, making it easy to distinguish the spots and track the reaction.<br><br> The enhanced color TLC slides show that the reaction appears to go to completion, forming a single product. NMR spectroscopy confirms that the aldol condensation took place with very high completion.<br><br> This experiment shows that a solvent-free aldol condensation reaction is possible. Solvent-free reactions would reduce manufacturing costs and put less stress on the environment because there are fewer steps and fewer dangerous by-products than a reaction with solvents. If solvent-free or reduced solvent methods work for other chemicals, it may be the start of a revolution in organic synthesis. <br><br>

EFFECT OF VARYING ELECTRICAL POTENTIAL ON LIESEGANG RINGS GROWTH
Adam Robert Brungardt
Brush High School, Brush, Colorado, United States

Crystals can be formed in the shape of rings. These rings are called Liesegang rings. Liesegang rings are formed in a gel by using two electrolytes. One is placed in the gel and the other is placed on top. The Liesegang phenomenon was first observed by German chemist R.E. Liesegang in 1896. He used a petri dish with a silica gel containing potassium chromate and placed a crystal of silver nitrate in the middle of the dish. Over the next few days, he noticed concentric rings had formed in the petri dish around the central point where the silver nitrate crystal was added. Two doctors later used silica gel containing sodium chromate in their experiments. By then varying the electrolyte placed on top, the color of bands could be changed. <br><br>The purpose of this research project is, (1) to determine if Liesegang rings are more efficiently formed in gelatin compared with silica gels, and (2) to determine the effects on rate of formation, ring formation, depth of rings, and average spacing between rings by varying voltage within the gel. The researcher concludes that: (1) through experimentation gelatin is a faster medium to form Liesegang rings, than silica gels; (2) Liesegang rings form faster with 3.0 volts applied, but the quality of rings is better with 1.0 volts applied; the total depth increased with 3.0 volts applied; but, with higher voltages applied, average spacing between rings decreased.

PLASMA ENHANCED CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION
Brandon Emerson Powers
Christian Academy of Louisville, Louisville KY, United States

The experimentation process of this project tested the effects of plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) of high and low index coatings on a substrate for optical purposes. Coatings that reduce glare or increase scratch resistance have been obtained, but difficulty remains in producing coatings that meet optical standards.<br><br>Coatings were deposited in a microwave plasma reactor through a process of etching, evaporation, and deposition. Hexamethyldisiloxane (a silica solution that increases transparency) and Titanium Isopropoxide (a reflective gold that decreases transparency) were injected into the plasma reactor. The plasma evaporated the chemical and deposited a thin film on the silicon or glass substrate. Observing the patterns of the coatings tested the uniformity of the plasma. The highest quality coating process took place when the substrate was exposed to the plasma in an etching process for 3 seconds, and the 0.005 cc chemical was deposited for another 3 seconds. A longer coating cycle resulted in a white powdery deposit that wiped off.<br><br>The circular structure of the reactor increases the uniformity of the generated plasma, thus improving coatings. Film deposition also relies heavily on vacuum. Pressures over 1 torr evaporate the precursor and deposited a useless film. A higher vacuum, under 400 millitorr, is necessary for thinner, useful films.<br><br>The overall results help explain the possibility of using PECVD for high quality optical tasks. The major benefit is the ability to deposit extremely thin layers of a chemical. Thin coatings decrease contamination possibilities and lower rejection percentages in optic laboratories.

PHOTOCHEMICAL AND ALKALINE DECOMPOSITION OF PIGMENT YELLOW 74, THE PRIMARY CHEMICAL INGREDIENT IN YELLOW TATTOOS
Andrew Paul Spann
Arkansas School for Mathematics and Sciences, Hot Springs, Arkansas

Tattoos have gained increasing popularity in society and culture. Although considerable effort has been focused on proper hygiene during tattoo application, very little has been published concerning tattoo ink chemistry and photochemistry. The chemicals used in tattoos have transitioned in the last several decades from inorganic to organic pigments. Little is known about these organic pigments and their photochemistry and metabolism. This project identified the organic compound pigment yellow 74 (PY74) as being present in multiple yellow tattoo inks. Solutions of PY74 in several compatible solvents were exposed to simulated solar light generated by a 6.5 kWatt xenon arc lamp. The stability of PY74 in an alkaline solution was also investigated. High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) chromatograms showed that when PY74 was exposed to simulated solar light, the height of the peak corresponding to PY74 decreased and new HPLC peaks, corresponding to new products, were detected. An HPLC chromatogram of the alkaline solution showed no peak where PY74 should be and a series of new peaks eluting earlier. These alkaline hydrolysis products were isolated by diverting HPLC outflow at appropriate times over repeated HPLC runs. The toxicity of these foreign products formed from the decomposition of PY74 is unknown. It is possible that sunlight or the body’s immune system could replicate the conditions under which PY74 decomposes. This work suggests the use of PY74 as a tattoo chemical should be questioned and that its decomposition to smaller molecules has implications of unnecessary exposure of those with tattoos to unknown chemicals.

CARBON NANOTUBES (CNT) – A NEW FRONTIER IN NANO-TECHNOLOGY THEIR PRODUCTION FROM VEGETABLE OILS AND STUDYING THEIR APPLICATIONS
Bhushan Prakash Mahadik
Fr. Agnel Junior College, Vashi, Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra State-400703 India

Currently, Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are produced from fossilized precursors like Benzene, Xylene, etc. These being derived from petroleum sources, are bound to get depleted one day. Therefore, an alternative source for the production of CNTs has to be found out. The purpose of the experiment therefore is to find out whether CNTs can be produced from “Vegetable Oils” and if the quality of CNTs produced is at par with the ones produced from fossilized precursors. The Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) method was used to obtain soot of carbon. This soot was appropriately treated with Nitric acid to get rid of unwanted material. The final soot contained nanotubes with other nanomaterial. Experiments were carried out on the Capacitance and Hydrogen storage capacity of the CNTs produced. Also, experiments were conducted to see whether these CNTs in presence of light could control the growth of cancerous cells and Pathogenic bacteria. TEM images of the soot obtained showed the presence of CNTs in many samples. The average diameter of the CNTs was found to be between 20 to 80 nm (Multi Walled) Also, the capacitance of a few soots calculated before activation agreed with the values obtained for CNTs from fossilized precursors. The maximum capacitance was obtained for Linseed oil (34.5 F/gm) Samples of Cotton Seed oil and Mustard oil showed evidence of Hydrogen storage in them. The sample of Linseed oil was found to control the growth of Cancerous cells to a large extent. Long, exquisite Nano-fibers were obtained from the soot produced from Anacardium seeds. From the TEM images, it can be inferred that production of CNTs from vegetable oils was possible. Also, their capacitance and Hydrogen storing capacity was at par with CNTs from fossilized precursors. Preliminary experiments show that CNTs can control the growth of cancerous cells. Thus these CNTs produced can be good Super Capacitors or drugs to cure Skin cancer.

EVALUATION OF THREE DIFFERENT EXTRACTION TECHNIQUES IN THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF BENZODIAZEPINES IN POSTMORTEM WHOLE BLOOD
NICOLE MARIE HENNESSY
NORTH MIAMI BEACH SENIOR HIGH 1247 NE 167 ST MIAMI FLORIDA 33162

Benzodiazepines, a class of drugs of forensic interest widely prescribed today, presented many difficulties in their analysis. The forensic toxicology laboratory analyzed benzodiazepines in postmortem whole blood using a one step liquid-liquid extraction technique for isolation of the drugs, followed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with diode-array detection to achieve their separation, identification and quantitation. This method isolated fatty acids and other unspecified artifacts from the specimen. These artifacts were injected into the chromatographic column contaminating the sorbent. This affected the efficiency of the column by raising working pressures, shifting retention times, and deforming the chromatographic peak shapes; factors that are essential in the identification and quantitation of the drugs. Solid phase extraction technologies were explored as alternative extraction methods. These take advantage of the non-polar, polar ion exchange properties of the drugs to interact with a bonded silica sorbent to yield clean extraction. <br><br> This experiment compared three different extraction techniques for their ability to exclusively isolate benzodiazepines from whole blood. Other characteristics studied included limit of detection, precision, percent recovery, and linear range. A liquid-liquid with acid back extractions and two separate solid phase extraction techniques were used to find the method which provided cleaner extracts. The best method of extraction was a solid phase procedure using a mixed bed silica sorbent made of polar and non-polar character. A batch of case specimens was run with the selected extraction technique to substantiate the new methodology. This new technique has eliminated the original chromatographic problems.

UNCOVERING A METHOD TO CONVERT BORATE GLASS TO HYDROXYAPATITE AND IMPROVING APPLICATIONS
Rachael Yvonne Nestor, De Soto High School
De Soto, MO, USA

Five different borate glasses, based on the composition 5Li2O, 5Na2O, and varying molar percents of CaO and B2O3, were batched, melted, grinded, and transformed into a glass/ ethanol paste.  The paste was attached onto a titanium base and then placed in a pH 7 buffer solution at 37°C until it transmuted into Hydroxyapatite (HAp).   HAp, calcium phosphate salt, is used for bone implants and dental materials, but holds low mechanical properties.  The titanium possesses excellent mechanical properties, but is unable to bond with the bone; it rubs against the bone harming the implant and shortening its lifetime.  The borate glass under the exposure of the pH 7 buffer solution acquires the same formation of hydroxyapatite and when attached to a metal base the implants can bond with the bone, but will not remain attached for a long period of time.  To improve the bond’s strength, a CABAL-17 (50CaO, 20Al2O3 and 30 B2O3) glass layer was added between the titanium and borate glass to create a double bond.  The glass samples with the CABAL-17 remained attached to the titanium longer than the samples without it and the borate glasses with the higher molar percent of CaO converted to HAp more rapidly than the glasses with a lower molar percent.   With these results, scientists could one day create a bone implant that would possess the same strength and relevance as hydroxyapatite is intended.  The implant would be stronger, longer lasting, and less harmful to the actual bone than Hydroxyapatite samples of today. <br><br>

SINGLE MOLECULE MAGNETS: SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF NEW MANGANESE CLUSTERS WITH SALICYLIC ACID
Brian Andrew Sparling
Blanche Ely High School, Pompano Beach, FL, USA

Formulas incomplete - see hard copy. Single-molecule magnets (SMM’s) are oxo-metallic complexes that act as magnets at low temperatures. SMM’s can be used in digital data storage and quantum computing. The purpose of this project was to create new SMM’s by reacting salicylic acid with manganese clusters to form new structures with salicylate ligation. These clusters may exhibit increased magnetic spin or higher functional temperatures than other, previously synthesized SMM’s.<br><br> Most experiments involved [Mn O (O CMe) (H O) ] and (Bu N)[Mn O (O CPh) (H O)], and the objective was to replace acetate or phenyl ligands by reacting the complexes with different stoichiometrical equivalents of salicylic acid in acetonitrile solutions. Other reaction formats involved derivations of these complexes and modeling upon other reactions in with similar ligand structures. After overnight mixing periods, experimental solutions were evaporated in vacuo. IR spectroscopy and dissolution in methylene chloride of the residues were methods to distinguish successful reactions. All starting chemicals were not considerably soluble in methylene chloride. Crystallization procedures included layering, slow evaporation, and slow vapor diffusion.<br><br> Crystallization only occurred in [Mn O (O CMe) (H O) ] reactions, and no traces of salicylic-like ligation were found in IR analyses. However, light microscopy revealed unusual crystal structure among the crystals of [Mn O (O CMe) (H O) ], albeit too small and impossible to separate to get an IR. IR spectra of most reactions indicate successful salicylate bonding, but crystal growth was not seen. This may be caused by many variations in salicylic acid bonding, creating various cluster species, inhibiting crystallization. <br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF PECTINASE ANALOGS AND OAK CHIPS ON COLOR PIGMENTATION OF CABERNET FRANC
Denise Michelle Gardner, Conrad Weiser High School
Robesonia, PA, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to enhance and retain the red color of young Cabernet Franc wine. Viniculturists spend hundreds of dollars for color enhancing products. Two analogous pectolytic enzymes and oak chips were evaluated in this experiment. The various treatments were tested for color intensity, hue, and color pigment concentrations to determine how the added substances affected the color.<br><br> Pigment levels did vary slightly. The pigment levels in the enzyme and oak chip samples were lower than either the control or the samples containing just an enzyme. This result was unexpected. It is possible that a competitive inhibition process could be taking place in those samples containing oak chips and enzymes.<br><br> All treated samples showed differences in the hue of the wine when compared to the control. The control was the brownest of all samples, showing that the enzymes and oak chips reduced the hue. Hue is used to evaluate the color stability of the wine. The oak chips sample was the only treatment with a definite change in color intensity and hue in relation to the control.<br><br> The results of this project could help a winemaker determine if the use of enzymes and oak chips is cost effective for improving the red color development of a young wine. <br><br>

SELF-ASSEMBLING NANOSTRUCTURES USING CONDUCTIVE DNA: A NEW APPROACH TO POST-SILICON COMPUTER PROCESSOR TECHNOLOGY
John Paul Sadowski
North Shore High School, Glen Head, NY USA

The silicon-based technology that is the basis for today’s microprocessors will soon reach fundamental limits. One candidate for post-silicon electronics is the field of molecular electronics, which seeks to make the processor’s individual components out of single molecules that will self-assemble chemically. Currently, there is no way to connect these components into the complex, non-random patterns needed for circuitry. However, a form of DNA, called M-DNA, has been developed that can conduct electricity. DNA would be a superb molecule to use as a molecular wire because of its ability to self-assemble into complex patterns.<br><br> Here, the synthesis and characterization of periodic DNA arrays made out of conductive M-DNA are reported. Data derived from gel electrophoresis and atomic force microscopy studies demonstrate that M-DNA arrays have indeed been created, but new procedures for performing M-DNA gel electrophoresis had to be developed in order to obtain useful data, due to the lack of previously published information on this procedure for M-DNA conditions. This is the first ever reported example of the creation of branched DNA structures and junction-based motifs using M-DNA. The results of this work can serve as the first step towards the design and construction of self-assembling nanoelectronic devices.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF HEATING ELEMENTS ON THE PRODUCTION AND RESIDUE BUILD-UP OF ACRYLAMIDE
Emily Michele Kraft
Signature School, Evansville, IN. USA

Current research indicates that a reaction between glucose and asparagine produces acrylamide: a 2B probable carcinogen in humans thought to be causing roughly 200,000 cancers per year in the United States (FDA). By proving that build-up occurs and by determining if heating methods increase production of acrylamide, the food industry would be able to alter cooking methods to reduce the amount of acrylamide formed.<br><br> The objective of this study was to determine if a correlation exists between acrylamide production and residue build-up in oil to direct and indirect heating methods in order to prove that a build-up of acrylamide occurs during the cooking process, and that heating methods can impact the concentration produced.<br><br> It was hypothesized that a coil type heating method would produce a greater amount of acrylamide in the region directly surrounding the coil due to the direct intense heat emitted. In both methods, a build-up of acrylamide in the oil was predicted, resulting in increased concentrations for later cooks.<br><br> With both mantle and coil systems, a three-cook method was used. Each sample was heated to optimal temperature; then, equal molar samples of glucose and asparagine were added. After filtering the solids from the oil, a water-based extraction method was used. Reusing the oil up to three times simulated restaurant use. An HPLC was used to analyze the quantity of acrylamide produced.<br><br> Preliminary results indicate that a coil system produces greater concentrations of acrylamide, and a build-up of acrylamide develops in the oil resulting in increased concentrations. <br><br>

WHICH OIL PRODUCES THE MOST BIODIESEL?
Benjamin James Van Treeck
Kohler High School, Kohler, WI, USA

This project focuses on which vegetable oil produces the most biodiesel. My idea was to test vegetable oils to determine which oil produced the greatest amount of biodiesel. I tested the following oils: soybean, canola, corn, safflower, olive, and peanut. <br><br> I started my experimentation by neutralizing the fatty acids. To do this I used one milliliter of the vegetable oil I am testing and ten milliliters of isopropyl alcohol. Next I mixed one gram of sodium hydroxide into one liter of water. Then I added the water/sodium hydroxide solution one milliliter at a time to the vegetable oil/isopropyl alcohol solution. I used this procedure to figure the amount of sodium hydroxide I needed. The next step involved measuring out the methanol. After I measured out the methanol and sodium hydroxide, I mixed them together to form sodium methoxide. Then I added this chemical to the 285 milliliters of vegetable oil. I heated and stirred the reaction for an hour and I let it settle in a graduated cylinder. The next day I revisited the cylinder and measured the amount of biodiesel that is tenuous on top of the by-product which is glycerol. I continued this process several times for each oil and averaged the results together. This allowed for more comprehensive results. <br><br> I conclude that the higher percentage of triglycerides in vegetable oils increase the amount of biodiesel that is produced. My results demonstrated that the corn oil produced the most biodiesel, and the olive oil produced the least.<br><br>

SOLID HYDROGEN STORAGE UTILIZING CRYSTALLINE SOLIDS: PHASE 2
Bryan William Christian
Collins Hill High School, 50 Taylor Rd., Suwanee, GA 30024, USA

Today’s society demands very flexible transportation options for individuals. The personal automobile has become an indispensable asset to most individuals. However, the increased use of automobiles has contributed to air pollution, and there is a need for safer, cleaner vehicles. Hydrogen-powered vehicles are one possible answer to this problem. This project explores the storage of Hydrogen utilizing crystalline solids. In the previous year’s research, Hydrogen was stored in the form of Uranium(III) trihydride(UH3), a solid and stable compound capable of storing large amounts of Hydrogen at atmospheric pressure and room temperature. Experimentally, 1.0 moles of Hydrogen could be stored in 10.75mL (204.5g) of UH3. Phase two of this research focused on making solid Hydrogen storage more feasible for application in the transportation industry. Other metals with similar Hydrogen storage characteristics, but of smaller density, were investigated. These were chosen with the developed Metal Hydride Dehydrogenation Coefficient. Initially Magnesium hydride, with a density 1.45g/mL, was selected to demonstrate improved Hydrogen storage and release; however, kinetic reaction rates resulted in the need to evaluate an alternative. Lithium hydride(LiH) was chosen with a density of 0.78g/mL using the method of hydration to release the hydrogen gas. LiH was shown to be a more efficient storage medium, storing one mole of Hydrogen in 21.56g. This means the Hydrogen contained in a Hydrogen-powered vehicle (about 140L of cryogenic liquid Hydrogen) can be effectively stored in 104.8kg of LiH.

WHICH ROCK HAS THE GREATEST SPECIFIC HEAT?
Michael Joseph Zuidema
Detroit Catholic Central High School, Redford, Michigan, USA

Understanding a rock’s specific heat is important in areas where energy absorption is a key factor, including the design of buildings that are built from natural or synthetic stone and also in the design of fireplaces. Keeping a building cool in a hot environment requires a building material with a low specific heat. Designing fireplaces to store and later release heat requires a material with a very high specific heat. While specific heats are usually known for pure compounds, most natural rocks are composed of two or more compounds in varying proportions. This study proposed that the specific heat of a rock could be determined by taking the mass average of the specific heats of the compounds of which it was made. Six rocks (dolomite, limestone, sandstone, white marble, granite, and quartz) composed of both pure and multiple compounds were studied. The chemical make-up of each rock was found in the literature, and equations to calculate the specific heat of each chemical compound in the rocks studies were also obtained. The equations were used to calculate the specific heat of each rock by taking the mass average of each individual compound. The specific heat of each rock was then measured by a simple water calorimeter. Five trials were completed with each rock. The measurements agreed with the calculations within the limits of experimental error. These experiments prove that the specific heat of a rock can be accurately estimated by the mass average of the specific heats of its individual compounds.<br><br>

CARBON - NANOSTORAGE FOR ATOMS AND MOLECULES
Matthaus Kloc
Gymnasium of the Geschwister-Scholl-Schule Konstanz, GERMANY

Medicinal drugs. The problem I have seen is that drugs often do not take effect directly enough. Often the drugs are transported with the blood. So they take effect on the whole body, not only there, where they are needed. A good example are chronic pains. Patients have to take pills against them. The drugs do affect the whole body and the patient might get addicted to them. But in my point of view it would be better if there would be a method to bring the drugs directly to the paining nerve, where they could take direct affect on this nerve.<br><br>So I wanted to find a method to realize this.<br><br>It is easy to imagine that a drug, which is wrapped in a neutral substance, could be brought to the place where it should take affect. At this place it could release the drug slowly and for a long time. Fullerenes, which build pretty big molecules, do have crystalling structures, in which nanopores do occur. IN the nanopores, atoms can be built in. Crystals like this are called mixed crystals. My idea was to place drugs into the pores. <br><br>In my work, I have built Molecules of Acetylsalicylic acid and atoms of Sulfur into the pores of Buckminsterfullerene crystals.<br><br>I suppose that it is possible, that it is also possible to place other substances (drugs) into those pores. The mixed crystals are pretty stable, but they can be disintegrated in an exposure of the substance will occur. Therefore I suppose, that mixed crystals like this could be implanted into the body to take affect on the sick parts of it.<br><br>

DEATH BY CHOCOLATE
Camilla Conette Burke
Mount Vernon High School, Mount Vernon Ohio, USA

Lead is a heavy metal found in anything from old paint to batteries. Lead is toxic and can be inhaled, ingested, and absorbed through wet skin. Lead accumulates in the body causing various health problems from poor appetite to brain damage and even death. Cocoa beans primarily come from western Africa, Malaysia, and Central America. Many countries in these areas use leaded gas. The exhaust is absorbed by the plant. It is possible the lead survives the candy making process and can be found in the candy marketed today. <br><br> Currently the Food and Drug Administration does not require testing lead content in chocolate. There are no established procedures for this analysis. As part of the science fair project, procedures are being refined to develop a verifiable method for determining lead concentration in chocolate candy bars. <br><br>Eighteen different samples were tested for lead. The samples were chopped, weighed, charred, ashed, digested in nitric acid, and filtered. The samples were analyzed using an AA spectrometer. One sample was run as a duplicate to verify the method used. Each sample showed traces of lead. <br><br>

A REVERSIBLE HYDROQUINONE CATION-EXCHANGE MEMBRANCE CELL
Lacey Lloyd
Ogden High School, Ogden, UT, USA

A possible hydrogen storage method is in the organic compound hydroquinone, where the hydrogen is covalently bonded. This project attempted to design a workable voltaic membrane cell in which the hydroquinone could be oxidized using sodium iodate, through a cation-exchange membrane. Two half cells were assembled out of glass pieces with the top pieces cut from acrylic plastic. Holes were drilled in the top pieces for a nitrogen inlet, platinum electrodes, and pouring solutions. A cation-exchange membrane was prepared using divinylbenzene, styrene, AIBN, and toluene, then poured over supporting fabrics and heated until polymerized. Glass fiber filter paper produced the best membrane. It was then sulfonated and left in water until ready to use. A fiberglass frame was cast to hold the membrane in the cell. The membrane was inserted with hydroquinone and sodium iodate on opposite sides with water and HCl. A commercial membrane (Ionics, Inc.) was then inserted and the same procedure was followed. The cell current and voltage through the commercial membrane were smaller than that of the membrane prepared in this project. The reaction was repeated using hte membrane from this project and with no external power. The solution's depolarization was analyzed by plotting the voltage versus time. Data points were fit to exponential curves using a least squares computer program that calculated voltage at infinite time. Current was also measured at each time interval. A DC power source was then connected, reversing electrode polarity, and depolarization curves were recorded for the reverse reaction. Voltage infinity values were plotted versus time for the forward reaction. The current versus time points approximately fit an exponential curve. Improving the concentrations, voltage, current, and solvents could some day produce a practical cell for modern day applications.

A NOVEL ROOM TEMPERATURE FUEL CELL UTILIZING A CARBONATE IONIC LIQUID ELECTROLYTE
Kunil Kaushik Raval
Saginaw Arts and Sciences Academy, Saginaw, MI 48602

Current designs of the Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell utilize a mixture of molten alkali carbonate salts as the electrolyte; thus, the cell operates at a scorching 650ºC. The purpose of this experiment is to create a room temperature molten carbonate fuel cell (RTMCFC) by synthesizing a room temperature carbonate ionic liquid for use as the molten carbonate electrolyte. The idea to facilitate the MCFC reaction at room temperature is new; therefore, the performance characteristics and behavior of a RTMCFC are unknown. <br><br>The synthesis of a carbonate ionic liquid was verified through an infrared spectrum analysis. The cation [1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium]+ was unstable in an absolute carbonate (CO32-) environment because it was subject to a base attack by the carbonate ion, so the electrolyte also included bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) and 8.37% (w/v) water to stabilize the ionic liquid. The conductivity of the carbonate/bicarbonate electrolyte was 8.7 mS/cm, which provided sufficient carbonate mobility for the purposes of this experiment. <br><br>An open circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.184 V with a maximum power density of 0.344 mW/cm^2 at an efficiency of 39.7% was attained by using carbon electrodes with a nickel net current collector and a Teflon emulsion bound platinum catalyst. Development of a more stable ionic liquid electrolyte with higher carbonate mobility and concentrations will increase the power density and efficiency of the cell to more competitive levels. The RTMCFC has enormous potential to become a versatile low temperature power source. <br><br>

WHAT IS THE ACIDITY OF SODA?
Douglas William Broadwater
Greenwood School, Phenix City, Alabama

The problem I'm trying to solve is to find out how many drops of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) it will take to neutralize the sodas and its flat version. In doing this, I will discover which soda has the most acid pH level.<br><br>I think Sunkist will have the highest acidity rating. The second highest drink will be Dr. Pepper because it contains the second strongest acid, phosphoric acid. 7-Up will be the weakest drink because citric acid is the weakest of the three acids. It is also a fact that the flat version of all drinks are less acidic than its carbonated versions.<br><br>These are my results. Dr. Pepper had 10 drops of sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The flat Dr. Pepper had 5 drops of sodium hydroxide. Sunkist had 7 drops of sodium hydroxide. The flat Sunkist had 4 drops of sodium hydroxide. 7-Up had 8 drops of sodium hydroxide. The flat 7-up had 3 drops of sodium hydroxide.<br><br>In relation to my hypothesis, I was incorrect. the carbonation in the sodas definitly had an effect on the pH rating. Perhaps that is shy 7-Up had a higher acidity rating than Sunkist.

THE PH AND CONDUCTIVITY LEVELS OF SOIL AS INDICATORS OF SOIL QUALITY
Mercy Sesilia Te'o
Fagaitua High School, Pago Pago, American Samoa

A study on the soil pH and electrical conductivity as factors affecting the soil quality of Lithic Hapludolls, the most common type of soil in American Samoa, was carried out. A sloped region with growing vegetation in Lithic Hapludoll soil was chosen as the sampling area. The sampling area was divided into five parts, the lower bush-below the farming terrain, lower farm, middle farm, upper farm, and upper bush- the area above the farm terrain. Three soil samples were taken from each part of the sampling area and labeled as A1, A2, A3...throughh E1,E2, and E3. My hypothesis was that the pH and conductivity levels were higher at the lower area of the slope than at the upper area, probably due to nutrients being washed downhill. The results showed that pH levels were higher at the lower elevation and were lower at the higher elevation. The conductivity levels are within acceptable salt levels throughout the entire slope, however the electrical conductivity levels were also higher at the lower elevation and lower at te higher elevation. In conclusion, the results supported my hypothesis, that the pH and conductivity were higher at the lower region of the slope than at the upper region. The lower region is more suitable for plant growth because of the acceptable soil pH and electrical conductivity levels.

BIOMOLECULAR TEMPLATING IN THE GROWTH OF MINERALS
Thomas Henry Huynh, Boston Latin Academy
Boston MA, USA

Templated mineralization is a major mechanism for the formation of biominerals by organisms. Fd and M13 are well-characterized rod-like inovirus viruses that possess the ability to self-assemble in solution. This project demonstrates the ability of the viruses to act as templates for the mineralization of silica and calcium phosphate materials. Dynamic Light Scattering was used to assess the initial aggregation size of various virus suspensions, in order to determine the critical aggregation concentration.<br><br>The structure of the aggregates formed in the presence of silica differs from the structure of the pure virus assemblies. Analysis of Transmission Electron Microscopy suggests a cooperative assembly mechanism of the formation of the silica-virus composites. The product consists of bundles of hexagonally packed rods, in which the silica coats the self-assembled viruses. Calcium phosphate reactions were carried out similarly, by varying the initial concentration of the virus. Filaments of protein or DNA were produced with an outer coating of calcium or calcium phosphate.<br><br>The inorganic structures prepared with Fd and M13 viruses are significantly different from the mineral deposits in the absence of the virus, suggesting a role for the biological materials in controlling the growth of the mineral. This study expands our understanding of basic mechanisms of teeth and bone formation and opens new avenues for the manufacturing of bioinspired nanostructured materials for hard tissue repair. Also, a technological advancement in data storage may branch from the mineralization of the DNA.

POLYMER CHEMISTRY OF CONSUMER MATERIALS- WHAT AFFECTS THE RATE OF COMBUSTION?
Andrew Francis DeBlase
Our Lady of Loudes High School, 131 Boardman Road, Poughkeepsie, NY 12603

The focus of this project was to compare the flammability of different materials and the relationship to polymer molecular structure. Based upon literature, the process of burning involves interaction between radical molecules and the volatile gases formed as a result of decomposition of the polymer chains. If a material burns then the rate of combustion depends on its specific molecular structure, because burning is oxidation and molecules that oxidize more quickly burn faster. The nature of the polymer and the way the chains are associated with respect to one another (crystalline or amorphous - morphologies), have an impact on resistance to burning.<br><br> Experiments were conducted to evaluate the flammability of different cloth materials, with and without alum (KAlSO4*12H2O), a common inexpensive flame retardant, and at different flame directions. All materials burn faster as the angle becomes horizontal because the unburned fuel is closer to the flame and decomposes faster. The flammability of cotton, rayon, acrylic, polyester, polyamides (nylon), were tested to find the relative rate of combustion and the durability of each material fabric to a flame. To further understand the correlations solely due to variation in molecular structure, polyurethane foams were then synthesized with different molecular compositions, and were able to show that polymers with more aliphatic groups, burned faster. <br><br> In conclusion, the data indicated acrylic burned faster than rayon followed by cotton, polyester, and nylon. This order also correlates with and increases in amide, ester, and aromatic structures (known to form char - a flame resistant highly aromatic material). The angle at which a fabric burns also influences the rate of combustion. The rate of combustion of polyurethane foams increases with an increase in the chain length of the PPG component. In all cases alum is an effective flame retardant. <br><br>

OSMOTIC PRESSURE, DIRTY WATER AND A MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF DIFFUSION ACROSS A SEMIPERMEABLE MEMBRANE
Megan Elizabeth Bell
Osbourn High School 9207 Tudor Lane Manassas, VA 20110

My project attempts to show that the partial pressure of a gas and osmotic pressure of a solute, generated in two separate systems, will be equivalent when the number of particles per liter in each systems is equal (as predicted by the Ideal Gas Law and Van't Hoff's Equation respectively). I conducted partial pressure experiments using acetone, and osmotic pressure experiments using aqueous egg albumin. Ultimately, the pressures produced by each system were shown to be essentially equal and very close to that predicted by the Ideal Gas Law and Van't Hoff's Equation. This supports the idea that the two equations are limiting laws that increasingly reflect empirical results as conditions become more ideal. <br><br> The measurement of osmotic pressure was complicated by the presence of a contaminant in my albumin. I based this conclusion on the results of "thistle tube" type osmotic pressure experiments, in which the height of the column of albumin solution would initially rise rapidly, then begin to slowly fall, as contaminant, by virtue of its small molecular weight, diffused through the semipermeable membrane. In order to solve this problem, I developed a mathematical model that I used to generate, with the help of a computer, hypothetical data by recalculating the system pressure at 10-second intervals. Changing the model parameters allows hypothetical data to be "fit" to the empirical data, thus allowing determination of the osmotic pressure of the pure albumin solution. This model also allows determination of the initial concentration of contaminant in the albumin solution. <br><br><br>

WATER SOLUBILITY OF COPOLYMERIZED HYDROXYETHYL METHACRYLATE AND METHYL METHACRYLATE
Stuart Van Cortlandt Duncan-Smith
Mohawk Trail Regional High School, Shelburne Falls, MA, USA

A copolymer is a polymer made of several different repeating units covalently bonded to each other. The solubility of polymers, like other compounds, depends on the polarity of the molecule. The solubility of copolymerized hydroxyethyl methacrylate, a polar molecule, and methyl methacrylate, a nonpolar molecule, affords an interesting study of the blending of properties. I believe that a mixing of properties will occur and that the methyl methacrylate will be more influential in expressing its properties in the copolymers.<br><br> The distilled monomers were syringed from a nitrogen-flushed flask into eleven small vials containing the initiator. The amount of monomers ranged from one hundred percent hydroxyethyl methacrylate to one hundred percent methyl methacrylate in ten mole percent increments. In a parallel synthesis reactor, the eleven trials were polymerized. The polymers were precipitated in organic solvents and placed in a vacuum oven to remove contaminants. The polymers were ground into a fine powder and tested for water and methanol solubility. This was conducted by slowly adding powdered polymer to one milliliter of water or methanol, and recording the total amount of dissolved polymer.<br><br> The results of the solubility tests supported the hypothesis. The results indicated that as the amount of hydroxyethyl methacrylate decreased and the amount of methyl methacrylate increased, the water solubility of the copolymers diminished. This trend supports the prediction that the properties will mix. The trials of the experimental setup formed a trend line that curved from trial A to K, and therefore concurred with the hypothesis that methyl methacrylate was dominant.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF ACTIVATED CARBON
Wesley Jarrett Burningham
Churchill Jr. High, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA

This project focuses on the effects of activated carbons and their adsorption properties. Adsorption is the attachment of molecules to the surface of a solid. For the project, I investigated the ability of various carbons to adsorb organic matter. I used blue food dye to simulate an organic contaminant in water.<br><br> Having researched carbons, I obtained two commercial grade carbons and made my own from crushed up coconut shells, peach pits, pistachio shells, and walnut shells. I put the crushed materials into tightly sealed cans with a hole punched in each lid. Then, I placed the cans in a barbecue and coked (heated in the absence of oxygen) the materials inside.<br><br> After the coking was complete, I measured out 4 grams of each carbon into separate, labeled flasks. Then, I added 150 milliliters of distilled water containing less than 1% blue dye to each flask. After waiting 20 hours, I separated the carbon from the blue water with filter paper. I took samples from each flask and put them into test tubes. By using a spectrometer, I determined how much of the dye had been adsorbed.<br><br> My results showed that the commercial grade carbons provided the best adsorption. This test was successful in showing that carbons not only adsorb organic materials, but that they may be useful in water treatment applications because of their ability to remove pollutants.<br><br>

ROLE OF DNA TRANSLOCATION THROUGH A NANOPORE IN ULTRARAPID SEQUENCING
Kapil Amarnath
Brentwood High School, Brentwood, TN 37027 USA

We present a quantitative model for the translocation of DNA through a nanopore channel. The model is based on the solution of the one-dimensional Smoluchowski equation with absorbing boundary conditions. Our model takes into account several factors such as counterion condensation along the DNA backbone, the applied voltage across the membrane, the structural characteristics of the DNA, and the pore-DNA interactions. Our predictions for the distribution of blockade times and mean first passage time agree well with existing experimental data. Our calculations for the lifetime of the DNA in the pore explain that the time to exit the pore is linearly proportional to the length of the nucleic acid fragment and inversely proportional to the external applied voltage. Thus, we make two significant contributions. First, by incorporating distinct features of the different conformations of DNA, our model can be used for the characterization of nucleotides. Second, by providing a more thorough understanding of DNA translocation through a pore, our model helps in the development of nanopore channels suitable for ultrarapid sequencing.

STRONGER THAN PAIN!
Sara Wells Applegate
Beach High School, Beach ND, US

The intention of this project was to determine which aspirin has the best qualities, in regards to components, solubility, and price. I will be testing the components with ferric chloride and tincture of iodine which will show the presense of any inactive ingredients.<br><br> I assumed that the homemade aspirin would test about average. I also thought that the brand Bayer would test above average because of Bayer's popularity with the public.<br><br> First I made my own aspirin with salicylic acid, acetic anhydride, sulfuric acid, and water. I then capsuled my pure aspirin at a pharmacy and used inactive ingredients such as the fillers Avicel and Starch. I then gathered five different brands of aspirin. I tested the aspirin's composition by adding tincture of iodine to a pile of each product and ferric chloride to another. I also tested the pH of each aspirin product by using a pH strip in water with a crushed tablet in it. I tested the aspirin's solubility in an acid, a base, and water by measuring out 3mL of the liquids and adding a tablet to each. Finally I compared the aspirin's prices.<br><br> The results were that the homemade aspirin did the same if not better in all of the tests. The brand Bufferin had the best solubility quality because it was buffered which made it dissolve in an acid better. Even though the St. Joseph's aspirin pill was the smallest it dissolved the slowest and did not react with the iodine or ferric chloride.

H2 AND C2H4 ELIMINATION PATHWAYS IN THE Y + C2H6 REACTION
Ann Chi
Terre Haute South Vigo High School, Terre Haute, IN, US

The study of transition metal-induced H2 and C2H4 elimination in hydrocarbons aids in our understanding of the catalytic properties of metals at a fundamental level. This research employed computational methods to analyze a representative reaction: the influence of Y on elimination reactions involving ethane. Density functional methods (specifically B3LYP/aVDZ) and natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis revealed a two-step mechanism for the Y + C2H6 -> YC2H4 + H2 reaction. A second low-lying pathway that produces YH2 + C2H4 was also identified and found to proceed by a three-step mechanism: (i) C-H insertion, (ii) B-H Transfer, and (iii) C2H4 elimination. The H2 and C2H4 elimination reactions are endothermic (delta H = +7.2 and +6.1 kcal/mol, respectively) with the initial insertion of Y into a C-H bond of ethane acting as the rate-limiting step.

SYNTHESIS AND EVALUATION OF A MOLECULARLY IMPRINTED POLYMER FOR THE ENANTIOMERIC RESOLUTION OF L- AND D- PHENYLALANINE
Yvonne Joy Yamanaka
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland OR, USA

Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are synthetic network polymers that contain recognition sites for specific molecules. MIPs are designed to bind the molecule that they have been imprinted with over other structurally similar molecules. The goal of this project was to create a beta-Cyclodextrin (B-CD) based MIP imprinted with the amino acid L-Phenylalanine (L-Phe).<br><br> MIPs, which are prepared based on relatively weak intermolecular attractions between the template molecule and pre-polymer components, have decreased binding abilities in polar solvents. However, to be used in many practical applications in the future, MIPs will need to be able to function in polar solvents such as water. In this project, the goal was to synthesize a MIP that could bind L-Phe in an aqueous solution by using the hydrophobic attraction provided by the B-CD cavity.<br><br> MIPs were formed by polymerizing (crosslinking) B-CD with m-xylylene diisocyanate (XDI) in the presence of L-Phe (template molecule). CuCl2 was used to increase the solubility of L-Phe in DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide, solvent). Control polymers were formed in the same way, but in the absence of L-Phe and CuCl2. All polymers were thoroughly washed and dried to prepare them for rebinding studies and analysis.<br><br> The polymer obtained from the synthesis described was analyzed with IR spectroscopy, and the structure of the polymer was proposed.<br><br> Due to difficulties in removing background UV-Vis absorption caused by the polymer or other contaminants in rebinding study solutions, the efficacy of the polymer in binding L-Phe over D-Phe in aqueous media was not confirmed, and will be the focus of future studies.<br><br>

FACTORS INFLUENCING ION GRADIENT FORMATION AND CURRENT OUTPUT IN LITHIUM/SILVER-SALT CELLS
Andrew Hayden Seltzman
Southeast Raleigh High School, Raleigh, NC, US

This project examines variables affecting formation of ion gradients in lithium/silver-salt cells and current output. The requirement of an anhydrous and aprotic electrolyte in lithium cells prevents the use of aqueous electrolytes with unity transference. The use of non-unity transference electrolytes causes formation of concentration gradients that decrease the current output of cells by increasing electrolyte resistance.<br><br>Experiments were designed to analyze the performance of primary lithium cells in terms of electrolyte concentration, viscosity, anion size, and hydration of the anions. These variables effect the rate of gradient formation and the magnitude of the gradient at steady-state current. In this project the current output was measured with a data-logging PC-interfaced milliamp multimeter. Experiments were done in an anhydrous environment. Gradient formation was derived from plots of current output versus time. Results were interpreted with focus on factors contributing to minimizing ion gradients and thus maximizing current output from the lithium/silver-salt cells.<br><br>Results of these studies indicate that water plays a prominent role in increasing the rate of gradient formation linked to ions with smaller radii. Increasing water in the electrolyte causes a decrease of peak current output by increasing the effective radius of high density charged small anions. Smaller ions have greater charge density and thus attract more water molecules increasing their effective volume and therefore decreasing their diffusion rate. This effect as well as high viscosity of electrolytes decreases ion mobility resulting in formation of detrimental gradients. Results of this project help define the complex interactions that govern current output of lithium cells and guide the design of portable power sources for future electronic applications.<br><br>

ELECTROENZYMATIC BIOFUEL CELLS II
Daniel Clayton Appel
Eldorado HS, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA

Fuel cells efficiently convert chemical energy into electrical energy. Biofuel cells utilize biomolecules; in this case, bioelectrocatalysts in one/both electrodes instead of metal catalysts. This is attractive because enzymes operate in ambient environments. These are being developed for micro/nano-scale power generation applications in bioelectronics, optoelectronics, biosensors, biomedical diagnostics, implants, MEMS, bioreactors, and power patches/textiles. Redox enzymes lack direct electrical transfer capability (enzymatic active sites are generally inaccessible, buried inside the globular protein complex). Current research addresses enzyme immobilization and establishing electrical communication using various strategies (e.g., electron shuttling, physical adsorption, and spontaneously formed self-assembling monolayers (SAMs) on Au surfaces). Experimentation involved laccase triphase gas diffusion cathode (GDE) development using a three-variable Box-Behnken factorial experimental design testing carbon type, thickness, and atmospheric parameters to optimize gas diffusion electrode efficiency. Data was evaluated, and the best-performing bioelectroenzymatic electrode was selected for use in a prototype biofuel cell. I hypothesized I could successfully fabricate a functional GDE, a DNA and/or alkanethiol-amine direct-wired SAM, and a miniaturized biofuel cell prototype (using the best-performing bioelectrocatalytic electrode) to generate electricity. Laccase (GDE) produced 1.2V open circuit potential and 5mW/cm2power density, all direct electron transfer attempts failed, however, the biofuel cell prototype produced 640mV open circuit potential using a laccase cathode and glucose oxidase anode. Overall, great success was achieved with laccase triphase reduction of dioxygen. In the future, I would like to continue studies with reagentless direct electron transfer, including apo-enzyme DNA or PNA SAMs, and biofuel cell miniaturization (micro-nano scale) for bioelectronic and biosensing devices.

A CORRELATION STUDY OF INTENSIVE AND EXTENSIVE PROPERTIES OF COINAGE METALS
Darvin Jerrel Griffin
Noxubee County High School, Macon, Mississippi, United States

This project is a correlation study designed to compare accepted and experimental developed values for the physical properties of coinage metals in pennies over a time period of 42 years. The idea of this project was based on a desire to make high school students aware of the value of the excessive amount of pennies littering the school campus.<br><br>The accepted values for density, mass, and diameter were compared with the experimental values of density, mass and diameter to acquire the correlations that were obtained in this study. The experimental values that developed the findings of the project were mass analysis, from the decigram balance; volume analysis, from volume displacement; diameter analysis, circumference obtained for the coinage metal.<br><br>After 1982, the average density by decades decreased by approximately 1.65 gram cubic centimeter (experimental density values were compared to accepted density values). The mass of the coinage metals decreased from 1980-2002 by approximately .20 g (experimental mass were compared to accepted mass values). Correlation for the average diameter remained unchanged (no noticeable differences in accepted and experimental diameters over time). This project recognized changes in mass and volume for the 1980’s (research supported changes as adopted by the Coinage Act of 1972).<br><br>The significance of this project centers on land pollution and public awareness. First, the coinage metals (pennies) are littering society because of their diminished values. So, by informing the public that rarity makes metals more expensive, even the penny, will reduce land pollution.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

A TWO-STATE DNA NANOMECHANICAL MOTOR POWERED BY THE REVERSIBLE HYBRIDIZATION OF A UNIQUE DNA STRAND TRIGGER
Robert David Barish, Chris Eric Kulawik
The Fox Lane High School, Bedford, NY, United States

The objective of this research project was the creation of a robust DNA nanomechanical switch capable of undergoing a linear transformation between an ‘open’ and ‘closed’ state. A two-state DNA nanomechanical device was constructed by extending single stranded DNA segments from two adjacent arms on a custom built four-arm Holliday junction. A highly localized ‘set’ or ‘trigger’ strand hybridized to these overhanging sticky ends, juxtaposing the two arms of the Holliday junction on the opposite side of the device. This ‘trigger’ strand was removed by introducing its complementary ‘fuel’ strand. By hybridizing to an overhanging sticky portion of the ‘trigger’ strand, the ‘fuel’ strand can induce a thermal walk, or branch migration. The result is the removal of the ‘trigger’ strand from the device, forming a duplex waste product. The switching effect was monitored by performing a fluorescence resonance energy transfer study (FRET) on the TAMRA and TET dyes incorporated into the covalent backbone of the Holliday junction arms being juxtaposed. Additional evidence for the operation of the device was observed from atomic force microscope (AFM) scans of arrays composed of these devices in their compressed and open state. <br><br>

OUT WITH THE BAD, IN WITH THE GOOD: COMPARING THE ABILITIES OF CHITIN AND ACTIVATED CARBON TO FILTER DISSOLVED METALLIC IONS FROM WASTEWATER
Matthew A. Serna, John Paul Cantu
Edinburg High School, Edinburg, TX, USA

The purpose of this experiment is to compare the ability of chitin, a common natural polymer, to filter dissolved metallic ions from wastewater with the ability of activated carbon, a common filtration component, to do the same. We dissolved a measured amount of distinct salts in three different solutions each (one for filtration through the chitin, one for the activated carbon, and one as a control, for a total of three different test solutions for each metallic ion) and then filtered them through each of the test subjects. We then obtained effluents that, when tested by burning a small amount of the effluent using a Bunsen burner to look for a colored flame (the “Flame Test”), did or did not pass the test. As experimentation is still ongoing, definitive results are not yet available, but a similar, preliminary experiment was conducted earlier using the same procedure. The results of the experiment were: one effluent of the three obtained still tested positive for the presence of metallic ions after filtration through chitin; two effluents of the three obtained still tested positive for the presence of metallic ions after filtration through activated carbon. Preliminary results supported our hypothesis that chitin would be more effective, but conclusive experimentation is still being conducted at this time.

ANTIPERSPIRANT INDUCED DNA DAMAGE ON A SINGLE CELL LEVEL
Gloria Yiu, Sharhzad Rahbar
Saratoga High School, Saratoga, CA, US

We decided to research the possibilities of antiperspirant induced DNA damage on a single cell level, because antiperspirants are used by millions of consumers in the world. In our background literature we came upon conflicting information that either denied or agreed that antiperspirants induce DNA damage. The antiperspirants we choose were, Secret Platinum for women, Old Spice for men, and Crystal natural (a “natural” antiperspirant). Natural antiperspirants market themselves as “alternative” and “healthier” so we tested one to see how it fared against the mainstream products. All three of these antiperspirants contain some form of aluminum, as it’s active ingredient. We also used two controls in our experiment: a negative control and a positive control. The general method of our experiment involves utilizing the technique of comet assay (a single-cell electrophoresis). Through our research, we have concluded that antiperspirants due induce DNA damage. Antiperspirants do cause DNA damage through breakage on a single-cell level. Additionally, our data showed us that in general, Secret Platinum for women and Old Spice for men, cause roughly the same amount of damage. Surprisingly, the Crystal Natural, which one would expect to cause the least amount of damage or none at all, induced the most extensive damage of all three antiperspirants tested. In conclusion, antiperspirants are harmful and people should take caution with frequent usage.

INEXPENSIVE THIN LAYER CHROMATOGRAPHY
Erika Lucero Caselis Gonzalez, Lidia Varas Jacob
Preparatoria Iztapalapa 1, Mexico City, D.F., Mexico

Chromatography is a technique for the separation and identification of substances. In our case we employ thin layer chromatography, that is the technique for the separation and identification of mixtures by a solvent (mobile phase) that move over a thin layer of a suitable absorbent (stationary phase) which is generally placed over a piece of glass or another material that acts as an inert support of the layer.<br><br>The advantage that this technique offers is the use of small quantities of the problem sample. The adsorbent more widely used in this technique is Silica Gel that is an imported raw material (which make difficult the use of this tool in the school laboratory). In this project we propose the use of maize and soluble starch as an absorbent support on a glass slide where we obtain the separation of the components presents in organic colorings that have been widely reported for their natural dyes. The dye containing plants include:<br><br>Red rose, red cabbages, beet root, pomegranate, Jamaica flowers, among other. These plants have acceptable separation of the coloring in single and mixed solvents.<br><br>The use of thin layer chromatography is facilitate as a technique for the separations of mixtures of common materials by students and helps focus on the identification of the variables present in scientific development.<br><br>

AN INEXPENSIVE SPECTROPHOTOMETER
Jesse Lito Yanogacio, Henley Shao
Silver Creek High School, San Jose, CA., United States

The purpose of our project was to compare a homemade spectrophotometer against a $1000 model to see how different our results would be in terms of percentage error. Our hypothesis was that our machine would have a 30% error rate. We started this experiment by creating different molarities of Cobalt Chloride solution starting with 6M and going down in .5M increments until reaching .5M. We then put these different molarities onto a photocell and created a graph based on resistance measured in Ohms. We then tested our molarities in the commercial spectrophotometer and created a graph using transmittance. We used a digital multimeter, a ring stand, masking tape, a flashlight, cellophane, a wooden block, two types of wire, alligator clips, a soldering iron, test tubes, stoppers, and a commercial spectrohphotometer. Surprisingly, our results gave us an even higher percentage error that we predicted. This may have been because of our machine's unconcentrated beam of light, dust collecting on the photocell, or a weakening of the light. However, in the end, we concluded that out machine was more accurate than the commercial spectrophotometer.

QUANTUM YIELD STUDIES OF SINGLET OXYGEN PRODUCTION BY BIS- CYCLOMETALATED IR(III) COMPLEXES
Henry Fong, Allen Tran, Johanna Tang
Alhambra High School, Alhambra, California, United States of America

Singlet oxygen's ability to damage organic compounds makes it a good candidate for photodynamic light therapy and is of great interest. Optically excited sensitizers produce singlet oxygen, but its production efficiency (quantum yield) varies from different sensitizers. Recently, researchers discovered that Iridium(III) complexes were capable of generating singlet oxygen. Thus, this project aims to find the quantum yield of five Iridium (III) complexes (BTIrG, FIrPic, BSNIrG, BSNIr*, BTIrPy). <br><br>Ir(III) complexes were optically excited using a laser beam (532nm and 355nm wavelengths) to determine the singlet oxygen quantum yield lifetime. The principle behind measuring quantum yield is the detection of singlet oxygen's luminescence as it returns to the ground state using a time-resolved near infrared luminescence detector. The results are compared to known sensitizer quantum yields to determine the quantum yield. The same principle was followed for quenching experiments. <br><br>FIrPic shows quantum yield at unity (1.0), and BTIrG and BTIrPy have higher quantum yield (0.7-0.97) than their parent compounds. Quantum yield is somewhat diminished at high sensitizer concentrations (~0.15 mmol.) due to triplet-triplet annihilation of triplet excited state sensitizer molecules. There also seems to be a solvent effect on the sensitizers, as FIrPic's quantum yield decreased to 0.46 in methanol. Quenching rates, the ability to deactivate singlet oxygen, are small. <br><br>These results show that we have an excellent class of new singlet oxygen sensitizers. They will provide researchers with a valuable blueprint in the synthesis of sensitizers useful in the biological system for photodynamic light therapy. <br><br><br>

PROCESSING OF PRAWN SHELL WASTE
Mary Elizabeth McGeown
Sacred Heart Grammar School, Newry, County Down, Northern Ireland

The fishing industry worldwide generates enormous waste, and waste from marine crustacean processing is no exception. The Northern Ireland fishing industry relies heavily on prawn catches, which produce solid waste in the form of inedible shell. This project investigated methods of chemical processing of such waste to produce added value materials in the form of chitin, and compared the purity of this chitin to the purity of other chitin forms.<br><br>This chitin was produced by the removal of calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate by demineralisation with 1M hydrochloric acid, and the removal of protein by deproteinisation with 4% w/v sodium hydroxide. The protein content analysis was carried out with 4% w/v sodium hydroxide in an autoclave at 120 degrees C for 60 minutes and the ash analysis in a furnace at 650 degrees C overnight. This checks the efficiency of the procedures in the chitin production. The data collected showed that when demineralisation was carried out first, an average of 8.66% protein remained. However, when deproteinisation preceded demineralisation, 17.4% protein remained. The chitin, chemically produced by demineralisation followed by deproteinisation, contained on average 8.66%, compared to 14.0% protein in laboratory grade chitin and 18.7% in bioprocessed chitin.<br><br>These experiments showed that the most efficient method of chemical production of chitin was demineralisation followed by deproteinisation. This produced chitin containing significantly less protein than the chitin formed by following the reverse procedure. It was also found that chemical chitin was the purest chitin, followed by laboratory grade chitin and then bioprocessed chitin.

Sally Elizabeth Raines
Lawton Chiles High School, 7200 Lawton Chiles Lane, Tallahassee, Fl., 32309

The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether ascorbic acid, commonly referred to as Vitamin C decreases over time.<br><br> The fruits tested on were oranges, tomatoes, grapes, lemons, and potatoes. The amount of Vitamin C was tested for by collecting the juice of the fruit and adding a 1% starch solution and diluted iodine. The Vitamin C prevented the iodine from reacting with the starch. The amount of drops it took to turn the mixture a dark purple was recorded. This procedure was repeated every three days for 13 days. Each trial, three different samples were taken from two<br><br>fruits of each fruit group. the percentage degradation over time was<br><br>determined by dividing the results from Day 13 by the results from Day 1. <br><br> The Vitamin C in oranges degraded about 49%, in grapes about 42%, in lemons about 53%, in potatoes about 33%, and in tomatoes about 67%. <br><br> In conclusion, the project showed that the degradation rate varied from fruit to fruit. The potatoes lost the least vitamin C, while tomatoes lost the most. This corresponds to the degradation speed of the fruits. The tomatoes degraded the quickest, while the potatoes degraded the slowest.<br><br><br><br>

WHAT FACTORS AFFECT REDUCTION OF NITRATE IN TAMPA BAY WATER, OR DENITRIFICATION RATES?
Tamara Michele Kemp
CAT/ Lakewood High School, St. Petersburg FL, US

The purpose of this research project was to observe the changes of nitrate levels in sea water after exposing the samples to different factors. <br><br> Experiment one was based on amounts of glucose, salinity, and oxygen factors on artificial sea water(ASW). One would have to test the nitrate levels in each sample using an auto analyzer. Preparation of each sample flask begins with seven ASW samples with one half salinity and seven samples with one fifth salinity being made. Each sample flask is then filled with five milliliters of sediment except two flasks (control). One milliliter of glucose will be added to each sample flask named “glucose”. After every day a ten milliliter sample will be taken out from each sample flask, filtered, and put into a small sample tube which will be frozen to preserve for testing. Taking up these test tube samples every day will prime them for testing using the auto analyzer after being defrosted.<br><br> Denitrification is accomplished with many facultative organisms such as Achromobacter, Bacillus & Pseudomonas. As soon as elemental oxygen is depleted the facultative organisms immediately begin using nitrate for respiration. Experiment one’s data is poorly conclusive because the bacteria were administered oxygen. <br><br> In conclusion the hypothesis in experiment one and two was proven correct. The factors observed from each experiment affected the nitrate levels in the sample flasks. Looking over the first experiment one can see because of the admitted oxygen there was not a large nitrate level loss with the exception of the times that no oxygen was present (the weekend). Yet in experiment two one can see that nitrate levels plummeted because of the lack of oxygen, glucose addition, and salinity changes<br><br>

METALLIC MONOMER LIGATION OF MANGANESE COMPLEXES AND A NOVEL SYNTHETIC ROUTE TO [MN O (O CR) (BIPY) ]
Brian Andrew Sparling
Blanche Ely High School, Pompano Beach, Florida, USA

Manganese complexation chemistry is breaking new ground in quantum magnetism (including molecular nanomagnetism) and biological metalloprotein systems. The purpose of this study was to create new manganese clusters through ligation of [Mn O (O CR) (H O) ] complexes with metallic monomers containing electron-bridging groups. These bridging groups could facilitate electron-spin interactions over relatively large intramolecular distances. A novel synthetic method was subsequently described.<br><br> Molecular nanomagnets from the family [Mn O (O CR) (H O) ] (R = Me, Et, Ph, CHCl ) were reacted with various stoichiometrical equivalents (1, 2, 4, 8) of metallic monomer compounds. A typical metallic monomer used had distorted octahedral geometry with formula [M(bipy) (cxyl)] (M = Ni , Co , Cu ; bipy = 2,2´-bipyridine; cxyl = acetate, µ-terephthalate, oxalate). Low solubility of monomers and S-term (entropy) effects impeded formation of terephthalate-bridged clusters.<br><br> However, reacting [Mn O (O CMe) (H O) ] with four equivalents [Ni(bipy) (O CMe)](ClO ) in MeCN yielded [Mn O (O CMe) (bipy) ]. The unstable nature of present µ -O ions and S 2-style nucleophilic attack by dissociated bipyridine were driving forces of this reaction. Manipulation of this reaction mechanism yielded similar results for other Mn O compounds, producing other complexes in the [Mn O (O CR) (bipy) ] family (R = Et, Ph, CHCl ). Product structures were confirmed from elemental and IR analysis.<br><br> A versatile reduction of Mn O complexes to Mn O complexes retaining initial ligation was established. Tetranuclear manganese complexes of this family are good candidates for mimicking the water-oxidation complex of photosystem II (for artificial photosynthesis), or they may be used as building blocks to larger manganese complexes including molecular nanomagnets.<br><br>

SUZUKI COUPLING: AQUEOUS AND ANHYDROUS SYNTHESIS OF FERROCENE-CAPPED THIOPHENE
William Stuart Mitchell
Breck School, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA

Thiophene is a p-type semiconducting organic polymer with applications in photovoltaics, transistors, and light emitting diodes. Because of its structure, short chains of thiophene between four and eight units long could be particularly adaptable to specific device specifications, such as degree of conductivity. Cyclic voltammetry can be used to determine the electrochemical properties of various thiophene derivaties, but in order to prevent polymerization, ferrocene caps were added. <br><br>In this continuing research, anhydrous syntheses were developed to increase yields and decrease ferrocene contamination caused by water in the previously performed aqueous synthesis. Various catalysts, reducing agents, and bases were investigated to find the combination that resulted in the highest yield. <br><br>Based on those results, the most important factors in the reaction appeared to be the catalyst and the base. Potassium t-butoxide was found to react with dioxane to produce greater ferrocene contamination than the aqueous reaction. Bases of varying strengths (K2CO3 and K3PO4) were also investigated with a palladium(0) catalyst but resulted in ferrocene-capped thiophene yields of less than 5%. This research showed that all reactions investigated using anhydrous conditions were less effective than the original aqueous synthesis. The advantage of the anhydrous synthesis, the ability to recover starting materials, was demonstrated.

FUEL FOR THOUGHT: A STUDY OF CATHODE EFFICIENCY IN PRODUCING HYDROGEN THROUGH ELECTROLYSIS
Justin Matthew Bourg
South Terrebonne High School, 3879 Hwy. 24, Bourg, LA, 70343 USA

The purpose of my research was to determine which cathode (copper, aluminum, brass, or graphite) would produce hydrogen the fastest through electrolysis. Since copper is a primary material used to conduct electricity, I thought the copper would produce hydrogen the fastest, followed by aluminum, then brass, and then graphite. <br><br> Eight rods were used in this experiment: two of each type of material (copper, aluminum, brass, and graphite). For example, in the copper trials, two copper rods were used for the electrodes. Three trials were conducted for each of the four materials re-using the same rods. An electrical current passing through the water between the rods chemically separated the hydrogen from the oxygen in a process known as electrolysis. Using a funnel, 25ml of hydrogen bubbles were collected into a 591ml bottle over the cathode. <br><br> The results showed that aluminum is best to use; proving my hypothesis incorrect. The copper finished second but oxidized very easily, which slowed down the process. Graphite was the third fastest with brass being the slowest. <br><br> Hydrogen being the most abundant element, combined with its many environmentally friendly uses such as rocket and automobile fuel, producing hydrochloric acid, reducing metallic ores, and filling balloons, makes it attractive as an alternative energy source. The results produced by this experiment could be useful to companies that are creating hydrogen. Efficient production of hydrogen through electrolysis may also allow individuals to produce their own hydrogen for personal use.<br><br><br>

SURFACE FABRICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION FOR DNA-BASED BIOSENSORS
Craig John Wright
Woodlin High School, Woodrow, CO, USA

Surface chemistry is a very rapidly growing field due to the expansion of lab-on-chip applications such as biosensors and microarrays. Some estimates predict 50-75 percent of the future analytical chemistry to be done with such devices. All of these lab-on-chip devices rely on fabricating specific surfaces in order to capture, immobilize, or sense different analytes. Therefore the initial purpose of this project was to gain a basic understanding of silane chemistry by investigating short-chain silane monolayer formation on a mica substrate for use in biosensors. Upon completion of the initial research, and with a better understanding of silane chemistry, the final goal was to fabricate a DNA-based capture surface, or biosensor, using silane chemistry on a flat substrate and demonstrate proof-of-concept in simple fluorescence assay systems. The final fluorescent assay system, or biosensor, was fabricated by sequentially adding molecules to attain a reactive surface capable of bonding DNA probes. X-ray Photoelectron Spectra at each stage of the process showed that the proper molecules were bound to the surface. Fluorescently labeled DNA targets were captured by the surface as evident in fluorescent scanner images. The completed biosensor can be used to detect the presence of any desired combination of DNA and could be modified for the detection of thousands of other biological analytes such as proteins, bacteria, and even bio-terror molecules.

THE FEASIBILITY OF PRODUCING HYDROGEN BY PHOTOELECTROLYSIS FOR LARGE-SCALE APPLICATIONS
David Michael Palko
La Plata High School, La Plata, MD, USA

The inevitable depletion of fossil fuels has encouraged many to look toward alternative energy sources, such as hydrogen. One method of collecting hydrogen is electrolysis, the process of disassociating water molecules by charging them with an electric current. Since the cost of generating the electricity needed to induce electrolysis is so high, this project sought to investigate if using photovoltaic cells as a renewable source of electricity made the collection of hydrogen efficient enough to power large-scale applications.<br><br> Numerous variables, including water temperature, distance between electrodes, and salinity, were tested to determine their effect on the time necessary to collect 10 mL of hydrogen from natural brackish water. Using the fastest time, calculations were made to determine how much hydrogen could be collected in one year, taking into account other factors, including duration and intensity of solar insolation. This was converted to BTUs and then compared to the average annual energy usage of a 100,000 square foot building.<br><br> The results made it clear that photoelectrolysis is not currently a cost-effective method of collecting hydrogen to power large buildings. The number of solar panels required is both physically and economically impractical, and the additional cost of fuel cells must be considered. <br><br> Today, these methods may be used in situations with less energy demands or in areas with intense solar insolation. However, as solar panels and fuel cells become more efficient and less costly, the process of photoelectrolysis to collect hydrogen for large-scale applications can become more feasible. <br><br>

ISOLATION OF PROTEINS IN PEANUTS
Serge Alexander Shkuro
Grants High School, Grants, New Mexico, USA

Isolation of Proteins in Peanuts<br><br> <br><br> Abstract<br><br> <br><br> Allergies are reactions that are triggered by certain proteins. Peanuts are one of the major allergens because of their high protein concentrations. The reason for doing this project is to identify the different proteins in a selected variety of peanuts and compare concentrations of each. The hypothesis is that proteins that do cause allergic reactions by triggering the immune system will be found. Chromatography was used to identify the different amino acids in these peanuts. After performing paper chromatography several amino acids were found in both Valencia and Virginia peanuts. The Lowry Method for protein determination was used to plot a calibration curve based on total protein in a sample using the spectrophotometer. The absorbance of these standards was then used to determine the concentration of the peanut proteins extracted. Based on the results from the spectrophotometer, Virginia peanut legume, at 1.96(mg/dL), had the highest protein concentration when compared to the other peanuts. SDS Agarose Gel electrophoresis was used to determine the molecular weight, the approximate size of the proteins, and the number of amino acid residues present in the peanuts experimented upon.

The purpose of this experiment was to find a way to combine cyclodextrins into a nanoporous polymer capable of purifying water by removing organic contaminants and verify the polymer would be effectively reusable. Cyclodextrin is a plant starch capable of filtering water in its powder form however it is useless for filtration application in that state. It was hypothesized that it would be possible to create this nanoporous polymer and it would prove successful in the experiment.<br><br> This is a brief procedure of the experiment. First, it was necessary to create the nanoporous polymer. 10 grams of cyclodextrin was transferred into a beaker. 5 mL of benzene was then added to the cyclodextrin via a pipette. This resulted in a gel-like substance. A vacuum pump and filter paper were used to fabricate a solid filter. De-ionized (DI) water without any organic contaminants was used for the control. A blank and a spiked amount (1000 PPM) were first scanned on the Gas Chromatograph (GC) for calibration. The same filter was used a second trial to test reusability, this second water was then scanned on the GC as well.<br><br> The results supported the hypothesis. The nanoporous polymer was successfully generated and was able to remove the organic contaminants effectively, including when reused. Nanoporous polymers could be easily implemented by attaching to faucets similarly to water softeners. Its effectiveness and economical benefits surpasses conventional processes such as carbon and zeolites.<br><br>

THE DETECTION OF CHOLESTEROL USING LIPID MODIFIED PLATINUM ELECTRODES AND ITS APPLICATIONS
Carrie Ann McDonough
Hathaway Brown School, Shaker Heights, OH, USA

Platinum working electrodes mounted in thin-layer electrochemical cells were modified with artificial lipid bilayers. The enzyme cholesterol oxidase was immobilized in the bilayer from solution. Cholesterol solutions were injected into the cell and underwent enzyme-catalyzed oxidation, producing hydrogen peroxide that was oxidized at the electrode’s surface to create a current. Amperometric data showed cholesterol detection and differing current response due to various cholesterol concentrations. There was also a response when a solution of human low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was injected into the cell, though there was a considerable loss of electrode activity over time. The process of cholesterol detection was applied to living cell membranes using platinum microelectrodes in a stagnant droplet of neat buffer. Data showed a current increase as the electrode neared the membrane. This research suggests that systems using these techniques could be developed to measure cholesterol concentrations in the body and analyze cholesterol efflux from living cells. The research will be used to help understand atherosclerosis and to aid in developing better techniques to prevent this disease.

THE EFFICACY OF HYDROGEN PEROXIDE IN SWIMMING POOL DISINFECTION
Eric Allen Wang
Southridge High School, Beaverton, Oregon, United States

The purpose of this study was to determine if the use of a combination of hydrogen peroxide and chlorine would be more effective than using chlorine exclusively in the disinfection process for swimming pools. Most swimming facilities use concentrations of chlorine at 1.0-3.0 parts per million (ppm) but chlorine levels greater than 0.6 ppm have been known to cause irritation to the eyes, skin, and nasal passages of swimmers. This study’s intention was to develop a method of disinfection that would reduce the amount of chlorine levels to below 0.6 ppm so that irritation to swimmers would not occur while still maintaining the same effectiveness in disinfection. To the author’s knowledge no products or studies have used a combination of both hydrogen peroxide and chlorine in routine swimming pool disinfection. For this study 2.0 and 3.0 McFarland turbidities of E. coli (ATCC# 25922) bacteria in liquid phthalein solutions were disinfected with various concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and 0.5 ppm of chlorine. A light transmittance rating of the disinfected samples was evaluated using a spectrophotometer. The light transmittance of the hydrogen peroxide disinfected samples was compared to light transmittance of the bacteria in the water samples before the disinfection process and the light transmittance of the sample disinfected with 1.0 ppm of chlorine sample. <br><br> The effectiveness of the samples disinfected with hydrogen peroxide and chlorine was very similar to the effectiveness of the samples disinfected by 1.0 ppm of chlorine.<br><br>

A NEW METHOD FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF SUBSTITUTED 3-ALPHA-HALOALKYL-5,6-DIHYDRO-[4H]-1,2-OXAZINES
Michael Sergeevich Klenov
Moscow Chemical Lyceum, Moscow, Russia

The present work is a part of systematic investigations directed at elaboration of new methodology of employment of readily available aliphatic nitro compounds in organic synthesis.<br><br> Our concrete task was associated with development of general method for the synthesis of interesting, though scarcely studied, 3-(Alpha-Haloalkyl)-5,6-Dihydro-[4H]-1,2-Oxazines 1.<br><br> As a result, we found two general and very convenient procedures affording target products 1 via silylation of six-membered cyclic alkylnitronates, which in turn were synthesized from simple nitroalkanes according to literature data. Totally more than fifteen previously unknown haloalkyl oxazines 1 were obtained, their structures and configurations being assigned by modern physicochemical methods. Taking into account the stereochemical results of oxazines 1 generation a mechanistic model for their formation was proposed, which includes ambident nitrosonium cation as key intermediate capable of ring-chain tautomerism.<br><br> Haloalkyl oxazines 1 have very high synthetic potential. In particular, within the framework of this study it was demonstrated that these compounds serve as convenient precursors towards 5,6-dihydro-[4H]-1,2-oxazines, containing at C-3 an alpha-functionalized substituent. Several representatives of derivatives bearing different functions were synthesized. It should be pointed out that at present no general method towards these compounds is available. To illustrate versatile opportunities for their application we performed a synthesis of highly effective analogue of medicine Rolipram possessing antidepressive properties, and demonstrated the advantages of our strategy over others described.<br><br>

CRYSTAL SPLICING - AN INVESTIGATION OF THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF DOUBLE SALT CRYSTALS
Simon Chiu
Sydney Technical High School, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia

This research paper was prompted by the discovery of hydrated mineral salts on the surface of Jupiter’s moon, Europa. Evidence of heavily hydrated salt minerals present over large areas of Europa’s surface have been gathered from analysis of reflectance spectra returned by the Galileo near infrared mapping spectrometer mission. The existence of hydrated salt minerals suggests resurfacing of water by material from a subsurface liquid ocean.<br><br><br>The Europa data identifies the existence of hydrated double salts of sodium magnesium sulfate. This paper investigates the factors, which can affect the chemical composition of double salts,<br><br>[Na2Mg(SO4)2.xH2O] and aims to compare the findings of the Galileo (NIMS)mission.<br><br><br><br>The two variables identified were the relative proportions of the component saturated single salt solutions, and ambient temperature of crystallization. <br><br><br>The variables tested the effect of relative proportions of saturated single salt solutions on the amount of H2O molecules in the crystals, effect of ambient temperature on the amount of H2O molecules in crystals, and effect of relative proportions of saturated single salt solutions on the Mg(2+), Na(+) and SO4(2-) ion content in the crystals. <br><br><br>Methods of analysis included gravimetric and titrimetric/volumetric as well as atomic emission and absorption spectrometry. It was found that the identified variables all had an effect on the composition of the double salts.<br><br><br>A mathematical description/model was proposed for the two double salt extremes, [Mg(x)Na(y)]SO4.7H2O and [Mg(x)Na(y)]SO4.10H2O. Also, possible molecular and crystal lattice structures were derived for the salts. The investigation can be used to discuss the conditions that may affect the hydration of minerals on the Europan surface.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

THE CHALLENGING NMR PUZZLE: THREE NOVEL ANTIGENIC STRUCTURES ELUCIDATION
Ivan S. Bushmarinov
Moscow Chemical Lyceum, Moscow, Russia

The aim of the present study was the elucidation of the structure of three bacterial O-antigens, which have not been studied before, using modern methods of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The knowledge of the detailed primary structure of antigens is very important as it determines the immune response in higher organisms. O-antigens are represented by polysaccharides and their derivates containing non-sugar components.The NMR spectroscopy is replacing the traditional methods to determine the structure of such compounds because the latter are much more difficult to perform and assume sample destruction. Many structural characteristics of glycopolymers cannot be foolproofly determined using chemical methods only, while the NMR data is much more reliable.The most time- and afford-consuming stage of such research is the complex analysis of various NMR spectra. The complexity of the problem I faced is based on the absence of the universal algorithm of such spectra analysis. Due to this each structure implies an individual approach during the structural interpretation of the NMR data. 1H, 13C DEPT-135, 2D COSY, TOCSY, ROESY, {1H,13C}- and {1H,31P}-HSQC, {1H,13C}-HMBC and HSQC-TOCSY experiments were used to establish the structure. As a result of the present study, the structure of three novel immunologically important glycopolymers (Providencia stuartii O49, Citrobacter PCM 1443 and Citrobacter PCM 1555) was completely elucidated. In addition to its biologic significance this task represents an extremely interesting structural problem. One of the O-antigens (1555) was built of branched tetrasaccharide repeating units containing a rarely-occurring residue (3,6 dideoxy-xylohexapyranose); another one (1443) contained two independent chains.

INVESTIGATION OF INLET MATERIALS FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF ATMOSPHERIC AMMONIA
Kenji Thomas Yoshida
Fairview, Boulder CO, USA

The decay of ammonia (NH3) after removing a standard addition from a chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) is studied for various inlet materials of uniform length to determine which materials allow for fast time-response measurements of atmospheric ammonia. A 7.9 parts per billion by volume mixture of NH3 in synthetic air is flowed through inlet tubes of different materials at low humidity, high humidity, and high temperature. The CIMS instrument detects ammonia as it decays off the walls of the tubes. Nylons and Teflons decayed >75% of the signal in less than 10 seconds, whereas metals took approximately a minute to decay an equal amount of signal. Humidity slowed down the decay of ammonia in all materials, and heating the inlet tubes to 40C drastically improved the performance of 304 stainless steel and glass while only having minimal effects on nylons and Teflons. Nylons showed unusual characteristics, which may have resulted from decomposition of the polymers into monomers, polluting the CIMS signal. Teflons, including TFE, PFA, and FEP, show the most promise as inlet materials for ammonia measurement.

ESTERIFICATION
Sarah Lynn Nelson
Laporte High School, Laporte Minnesota, U.S.A.

Esters are found everywhere in our daily lives and we don't even know it. A characteristic of many esters is a distinctive odor, which has led to their widespread use in artificial flavorings and fragrances. Esters that aren't airborne are used in everything from fabric polymers, to the Aspirin we take for a headache.<br><br> The purpose of this project is to create an ester and understand esterification and the chemistry behind creating esters. I used different processes like heating under reflux, distillation, extraction, etc., to try and create an ester recognizable by smell. One mixture, isopentyl acetate, smelled extremely sweet, and another, isoproply acetate, smelled like alcohol. The unpurified esters all smelled sweet behind some other odor.<br><br> In conlusion, making esters is harder than I thought. These processes are the most complex I have ever done. I now have a good understanding of the mechanics in this part of organic chemistry.

ISOTACTIC POLYPROPYLENE SUPERHYDROPHOBIC COATINGS ON FABRIC SUBSTRATES
Melissa Ann Barber
DeKalb High School, Waterloo, IN, United States

The purpose of this project is to test a waterproof coating made of isotactic polypropylene (i-PP) applied to cotton fabric squares by measuring the water absorbed by the squares when soaked in water. Coatings were made by dissolving i-PP in p-xylene and MEK at 130°C. Concentrations of 10 mg/mL, 20 mg/mL, 30 mg/mL, 40 mg/mL, and 70 mg/mL were applied to cotton fabric squares and then dried in a vacuum oven at different drying temperatures of 30, 60, and 90 degrees Celsius. Sets of five squares were used for each testing group.<br><br> After applying the coatings, the squares were immersed in distilled water for five minutes. The mass of the water absorbed was determined. A water uptake factor was calculated by dividing the mass of the water absorbed by the mass of the dry, uncoated fabric. Then, the average water uptake factor and standard deviation were determined for each set of samples. Using these two values, data was analyzed by a mean comparison test. <br><br> Conclusions drawn from this analysis included that the drying temperature in the vacuum oven had no effect, the amount of MEK had no effect, and the concentration was the only factor that did have an effect. More specifically, as the concentration increased the water uptake factor decreased and the trend was significant between every concentration change except between the 40 mg/mL and 70 mg/mL. This shows that the 40 mg/mL concentration is the highest concentration that should be used, and it sheds the most water.<br><br><br>

ELECTROPLATING A SILVER AND COPPER ALLOY
Jenny Lauren Kovach
Laurel School, Shaker Heights, OH, USA

This experiment is designed to give a physical representation of an alloy of fifty percent silver and fifty percent copper by using an important industrial process known as electroplating, and then to test the alloy using an established procedure. By setting up a simple Galvanic cell, presumably both elements would plate out together, on top of one another, essentially causing an alloy. Both zinc-silver and zinc-copper cells were run preliminarily to establish correct reduction potentials, and were then compared to those calculated. This was performed in order to monitor the use of the carbon electrode. Eventually, the Galvanic cell that was created used a zinc electrode and 2.0 M zinc sulfate solution so that zinc could be oxidized in one compartment and both 1.0 M silver nitrate and 1.0 M copper sulfate would be combined to reduce in the other compartment with a carbon electrode. Monitoring the cell voltage in this cell would help determine the various concentrations needed to get the two elements to plate out equally. This work is still in progress, and the concentrations need to be altered in order to fit the desired percentage per element, and the encountered problems using the carbon electrode must be addressed.

NEW FINDING, CHEMICAL OSCILLATION USING IRON WIRE
Ayaka Iwami
Urawa Daiichi Girls' High School, 3-8-45 Kishicho, Urawa-ku, Saitama, JAPAN

This study describes that remarkable new chemical oscillation reaction by soaking an iron wire in the middle solution of acid and oxidizer is observed. <br><br> When an iron wire is soaked in the solution which is mixed H2O2 aqueous solution with H3PO4 aqueous solution, H2 occurs. This phenomenon, however, stops soon, and H2 occurs again after a few minutes. This reaction keeps oscillating regularly for two days.<br><br>This mechanism of chemical reaction is triggered by the cycle of the equilibrium system at the iron surface and passivity film.<br><br> Fe + 2H+ -> Fe2+ + H2 (A)<br><br> 2Fe2+ + H2O2 -> Fe2O3 + 4H+ (B)<br><br> Fe2O3 + 6H+ -> 2Fe3+ + 3H2O (C)<br><br> 2Fe3+ + H2 -> 2Fe2+ + 2H+ (D) <br><br>First, when the iron wire is soaked in acid, bubbles starts occurring(A). As the reaction (A) proceeds, the concentration of H+ decreases near the surface of iron wire and the reaction of making passivity occurs(B). Then, reaction (C) occurs as the concentration of H+ increases.<br><br>The iron wire and H+ react again, and reaction (A)-(C) occurs periodically in a cycle. Since there is no Fe3+, reaction(D) is proceeding at the same time.<br><br>It is realized that the voltage of the system and oscillation cycle depend on solution's temperature, hydrogen peroxide and pH, and we can control the cycles by adjusting these factors.<br><br>

BUGS AWAY! PHASE III
Kegan Kade Crouch
Mason High School, Mason, Texas, USA

The project of discussion is a three-year study. Year one tested cedar shavings as an insect repellent incorporated in the production of a replica feed sack.<br><br> Year two, a feed sack was lined with cedar paper made from cedar shavings, and tested for its ability to repel insects.<br><br> The present year was different from previous years because the wood from the cedar tree was not used for testing. This year, the purpose was to determine if the powder from the dried cedar leaves possess the ability to repel insects. The leaves from cedar trees were harvested and allowed to dry naturally. Then the dried leaves were ground into a fine powder substance. This substance was then incorporated into the production of paper. This paper was then placed into the lining of a feed sack. The entire feed sack was not made from the cedar powder paper because it would decrease the durability of the feed sack. The sack was then tested for repellency against insects. The paper made from the powdered cedar leaves proved to repel more insects than the paper made from cedar shavings. The cedar leaves proved to hold more oil, therefore, repelling more insects. Livestock and wildlife are not affected because the cedar is in their natural habitat and is consumed when nutritionally needed. During the three-year study, the powdered cedar leaves proved to provide the highest repellency. Because of the oil in the cedar, it makes a great natural repellent. <br><br>

EFFECT OF SOLVENT COMPOSITION ON THE SOLUBILITY OF ALCOHOLS
Parisa Marie Toghiani
Starkville Academy, Starkville, Mississippi, USA

I. State Problem: To examine the amount of alcohol needed to form a single-phase solution from a two-phase solvent/water mixture<br><br>II. Hypothesis: When 50% benzene/50% toluene is the solvent, the amount of alcohol required to form a single-phase solution will be halfway between that required when either pure benzene or pure toluene is used.<br><br>III. Materials: Gloves, safety glasses, bottles, caps, balance, syringes, distilled water, benzene, toluene, ethanol, methanol.<br><br>IV. Procedure: Add water and solvent to bottles ( ratios of 10% to 90%). For mixed solvent samples, add equal amounts of benzene and toluene (10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 90%). Record weight of water and of solvent added. Add alcohol (either ethanol or methanol) in small amounts. Record weight. Mix bottle contents. Allow to settle. Record observations. Add alcohol until a single-phase solution is observed.<br><br>V. Observation: When small amounts of alcohol were added, bubbles of solvent phase formed quickly. The bubbles were bigger and rose quickly, joining to form the less dense phase. As alcohol was added, it took longer for the mixture to settle into two liquid phases.<br><br>VI. Conclusion: The amount of alcohol needed to form a single-phase solution differed for each starting solvent/water composition. A maximum was observed for each data series. With ethanol, the maximum was at 60% water/40% solvent. With methanol, the maximum was at 50% water/50% solvent. The amount of alcohol required for the water/mixed solvent sample was between that for the water/benzene sample and the water/toluene sample at the same water/solvent ratio.<br><br>

FICUS ELASTICA: A NOVEL RENEWABLE SOURCE OF ENERGY
Luis Alberto Cruz
Colegio De La Salle, Bayamon, Puerto Rico

The purpose of this investigation is to demonstrate if (Ficus elastica) rubber tree’s latex and dried leaves have petroleum fuel qualities. The hypothesis is if some petroleum derivate products as plastics are elaborated from the rubber tree then the latex and the dry leaves from the rubber tree may have fuel properties. Latex samples were obtained from Ficus elastica tree by making an incision and collecting the latex in a sterile vial, keeping it cool in ice and immediately transporting to a professional analytical laboratory. Diesel Range Organics (DRO) test were performed to evaluate the total parts per million (ppm) of the sample that are petroleum hydrocarbons. Dry leaves were collected under the rubber tree, washed with distilled water and let stand in ethanol for three days. The solution was shattered, filtered, evaporated and distilled in three ranges. The results from latex DRO shows 17.3% light petroleum hydrocarbons (diesel). The distillation lodged in three ranges of the leaves were 29%, 37% and 23% fuel. It is concluded that the latex and leaves from Ficus elastica are an energy alternative that leads to create a new form of bio diesel, which could be a solution to reduce petroleum dependence and is friendly to the trees.<br><br><br>

PHYTOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF FLEURYA AESTUANS’ (PICA PICA) EXTRACT FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE RESPONSIBLE COMPOUND IN THE BIOCONTROL OF THE SOLENOPSIS INVICTA (FIRE ANT). III
Sascha Marie Vega
University Gardens High School, San Juan, Puerto Rico

The purpose of this investigation is to identify the main compounds in the alcoholic extract of the poisonous plant Fleurya aestuans (pica pica) effective in the biocontrol of the Solenopsis invicta (fire ant). Previous research had shown that the Fleurya aestuans’ extract is effective in the biocontrol of the Solenopsis invicta. By means of this analysis it was expected to identify what compounds or the combination of compounds that causes the insecticidal effect on this type of ant. For this analysis an extract of the leaves of this plant was prepared. The leaves of Fleurya aestuans were ground in Methanol and the resulting suspension was filtered. After filtration, the extract was concentrated by rotoevaporation. The concentrated sample of the extract was then analyzed by GC/MS (Gas Chromatography -Mass Spectrometry). In a comparison of the resulting chromatogram to a chromatogram of solvent blank, no significant differences were found. This led to the conclusion that the compound in this extract did not have the volatility or thermal stability to be analyzed by a GC/MS. To verify that the active compounds were in the extract of Fleurya aestuans it was applied to three groups of 20 ants each. All the ants died demonstrating that the active compounds were extracted. This analysis helped to establish some properties of the extract like its low volatility and possible problems with its thermal stability. These results will make it easier to identify the compounds of Fleurya aestuans in the next analysis of the extract.

THE EFFECT OF HEATING METHODS ON THE PRODUCTION AND RESIDUE BUILD-UP OF ACRYLAMIDE - PHASE II
Emily Michele Kraft
Signature School, Evansville, IN., United States

Since the alarm for acrylamide concentrations in carbohydrate-rich foods first arose, special concern has been raised for fast-food restaurants and other commercial foods as they show a tendency for higher concentrations. One of the key differences between commercial and home cooking is the reuse of oil over time.<br><br> The objective of this study was to prove that reuse of oil over time causes a build-up of acrylamide. Focus on build-up may provide the short-term solution to a long-term problem. Alteration in policy for reuse of oil can be a first step for industry to lower acrylamide levels. It was hypothesized that reuse of oil in frying of foods will lead to an increase in concentration of acrylamide, increasing concentrations existing as residue on fried foods. <br><br> Acrylamide standards were used for background testing and standard curves. For cooks, the oil was heated to a constant temperature of 170oC; 30.000mg of potato was added per 5.000g of oil. Samples were cooked in increments of 15 minutes and were removed at each interval for extraction. A 10/3 hexane: methanol extraction was used. Samples were analyzed with an HPLC using a 99:1 (.1 acetic acid: methanol) mobile phase.<br><br> Results indicate that reuse of oil leads to a build-up of acrylamide, resulting in increased concentrations on the food. Testing indicates that the concentration of acrylamide is higher in the food than in the oil. This means that acrylamide forms in the fries, but the residue build-up from the oil adds additional concentrations over time. <br><br>

REVERSIBLE MEMBRANE CELL: PHASE 2
Lacey Lloyd
Ogden High School, Ogden, UT, USA

Last year's project demonstrated the reversibility of the hydroquinone quinone reaction in an electrochemical cell with a proton-exchange membrane. The objective of this project is to further verify the performance and improve the membrane cell constructed previously. Another possible hydrogen storage method was investigated in the organic compound phloroglucinol which reduces to 1,3,5-cyclohexanetriol. The reaction was unsuccessful under the conditions used. The hydroquinone system was also compared to the catachol system. A new membrane cell design was created and a fiberglass mold for a proton-exchange membrane was built. The forward and reverse reaction of hydroquinone to quinone was followed using an ultra-violet spectrometer by withdrawing samples at time intervals. The absorbance peak at 252 nanometers was followed. Using Beer's Law, concentration changes were plotted versus time for constant current. The reaction, using a dilute concentration of hydroquinone, was then run seven times back and forth, each time verifying its completion with UV spectroscopy. Only about 16% of the starting material was lost after the seven cycles. Minimal hydrogen gas production on the cathode of the reverse reaction was observed on lead and graphite electrodes. NMR spectra also validated the products with no other contaminants detected.

MECHANISTIC INVESTIGATIONS OF OXIDATIVE TRANSFORMATIONS USING WATER-SOLUBLE HYPERVALENT IODINE REAGENTS
Arun Poothatta Thottumkara
Macomb High School, Macomb, IL, USA

Efficient and direct oxidative transformation of benzyl ethers to the corresponding benzoate esters and oxidatively cleaved benzaldehyde derivates has been achieved using a water-soluble hypervalent iodine reagent. The reaction is conveniently carried out in water and other aqueous solvent systems at 60-70 ºC and products isolated in moderate to good yields. The reagent, a modified form of o-iodoxybenzoic acid called mIBX, tolerates a variety of functional groups, both electron withdrawing and electron donating, on the substrate. The water-insoluble reduced form of mIBX, an iodosobenzoic acid derivative, is easily recovered and reoxidized to mIBX after the reaction. The reaction is believed to be initiated by the selective abstraction of a benzylic hydrogen by the iodyl moiety in mIBX followed by single electron transfer (SET) steps resulting in the formation of the ester and the oxidatively cleaved aldehyde product. A similar mechanism has also been proposed for the selective oxidation of benzylic and allylic alcohols to the corresponding carbonyl compounds by the same reagent. A Hammett correlation study conducted by the experimenter verifies the presence of a radical intermediate in the oxidation of alcohols. The value of the reaction constant (rho) obtained (-0.229) from the Hammett correlation plot is strongly indicative of the presence of radical intermediates along the reaction path. The effects of pH on the reactivity of the reagent in both alcohol and ether oxidations have also been studied. Results from this pH study prompted the experimenter to synthesize a new hypervalent iodine reagent for use as a selective oxidant in basic media. Additional mechanistic and synthetic investigations using these reagents are currently underway.<br><br>

SYNTHESIS OF COMPOSITE PROTON EXCHANGE MEMBRANES FOR HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS
Christopher Richard Hammen
Loyola Sacred Heart High School, Missoula, MT, 59802

Fuel cells are devices that directly convert chemical energy into an electric current. Improvement of fuel cells is a significant area of research, as the need for more efficient and environmentally safe sources of energy is critical to our nation. An important factor in the development of the technology is to increase the efficiency of the fuel cell by operating at temperatures between 100°- 140° Celsius. Unfortunately, the state of the art polymer electrolyte membrane technology is unstable at temperatures above 80° Celsius, due to the low melting point of the proton conducting polymers that are used in the membranes. The goal of this research is to create a membrane that is stable at temperatures above 90° Celsius. This will be accomplished by tethering proton conducting polymers to the surface and between the fibers of fiberglass filter paper. This process has allowed several polymers, such as polyvinylsulfonic acid, to be used because of their high proton conductivity. Otherwise, these amorphous polymers could not be used, due to their low melting points and lack of structural strength. When a polyvinylsulfonic acid membrane was heated to 90° Celsius, the proton conductivity increased by over 100%. These results are encouraging and need to be investigated further to improve the efficiency of the fuel cells.

CONTROLLING THE GROWTH OF CARBON NANOTUBES
Kunal Nilesh Shah
Manhasset High School, Manhasset, NY, USA

Carbon nanotubes, thousands of times thinner than human hair, possess remarkable mechanical and electronic properties. Currently, there is no way to control the diameter or chirality of carbon nanotubes. These two properties have been found to determine the mechanical and electronic properties of nanotubes (Dai, 2002). The goal of this study was to control the growth of carbon nanotubes by controlling catalyst particle size and distribution through a novel polymer/catalyst system (Pender, 2003). The system was applied to CVD (chemical vapor deposition) growth of nanotubes. Catalyst and polymer compositions, substrate preparation, and growth conditions were optimized to obtain homogenous nanotube growth. Substrates were analyzed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). It was found that nanotube surface density can be modified by controlling the thickness of the polymer/catalyst precursor film deposited onto growth substrates. Large catalyst particles were found to support either the growth of multiwalled nanotubes or no nanotubes at all. The results of this study concur with those of Cassell (1998), suggesting there is an upper limit to catalyst size and nanotube nucleation. The system investigated in this study is beneficial because of the ease and flexibility it offers in CVD growth of nanotubes.

GRASS FOR BIOMASS PHASE 2
Danielle Marie Wilson
West Central Valley High School, Stuart, Iowa, U.S.

The purpose of this longitudinal study was to determine changes in biomass yield of grasses, including corn stalks, over a two-year period. Comparisons were made in the changes of the megacalories from the grasses versus the rainfall over a two-year period. A second dimension of this project was to determine the quality of storage, indicated by pH and the glucose levels of the grasses, were analyzed. The types of biomass tested were: switch grass, prairie grass, brome grass, reed canary grass, and corn stalks.<br><br> It was hypothesized that the prairie grass would produce the greatest yield and number of megacalories per unit of area regardless of the change in yearly rainfall. It was also hypothesized that the corn stalks would undergo a pH change and the formation of glucose level most favorable to long term biomass storage.<br><br> The grasses were harvested and tested in an oxygen bomb calorimeter. The moisture was adjusted to 60% and an ensilage enzyme was added. The pH was tested on day 1 and at intervals of 7, 21, and 50 days. The glucose levels were determined after 50 days for each group of grasses.<br><br> The data collected showed prairie grass had the greatest biomass yield and megacalories regardless of rainfall. The corn stalks showed the most favorable pH change for storage. The switch grass had the greatest glucose levels. The glucose levels of all groups increased at 50 days showing that each grass was forming a glucose level most favorable to long term biomass storage.<br><br>

UTILIZING BACTERIA TO EFFECTIVELY DECOMPOSE OIL
Nathanael Lee Willie
Wingate High School, Ft. Wingate, New Mexico, United States

There are many environmental concerns about oil (petroleum) polluting the soil and waters after devastating oil spills. The purpose of this project was to test whether specific types of bacteria could be used to break down the organic structure and composition of oil. The type of oil being tested is A.C.E. All Season Motor Oil (SAE 10 w40). The oil was taken from its non-used stage. <br><br>Bacteria food such as Nutrient and Tryptic Soy Agar were used in the experiments. The procedures to make the Tryptic Soy and Nutrient Agar were followed. It was then poured into Petri dishes, cooled, and covered to prevent cross-contamination from airborne bacteria. There were four strains of bacteria used in the experiments, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Bacillus cerus, Escherichia coli (E. coli) gram-negative and gram-positive.<br><br>The first bacterium used was Staphylococcus sp.; followed in order were Bacillus sp. and Escherichia sp. A sterile swab was used to gather the bacteria and then plated on the agar. Conducted were four experiments including the control in each of the tests and six trials for each experiment.<br><br>The control experiments bacteria grew as expected. Results showed a zone of inhibition of 0.9mm of E. coli gram-negative in experiment 1, trial1 and gram-positive with a zone of inhibition of 0.9mm in experiment 2, trial 2. In the Staphylococcus sp. experiment, the lowest zone of inhibition was 1.3cm; fairly good. The Bacillus sp. bacterium had the highest zone of inhibition of 2.1cm. Overall, Escherichia coli showed the best results. <br><br>

IN VIVO NANOTECHNOLOGY IN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM
Preet Gudimella
West Bloomfield High School, West Bloomfield, MI, United States

For centuries, living organisms have been victim to the attack of invaders such as bacteria and viruses. Is it possible to build nanoscale machines that can emulate the functions of white blood cells and can even “live” for longer periods of time and attack more efficiently? How can they be manufactured to carry out the many necessary, complicated duties and more importantly, what parts are required to build a functional nanomachine?<br><br>Although it will take many years to make functioning nanomachines that can perform the functions of white blood cells with immaculate efficiency, it is very possible to build one. To begin, I think a strong shell made by covalent bonds might be the best encasement in regards to strength and stiffness. In order to carry out functions, the machine will need gears, axles, bearings, a power source, and an internal computer.<br><br>I gained information about the properties of various atoms at the atomic level, piezoelectricity, and bond energies between atoms. Using this information and a scanning tunneling microscope, I developed a two dimensional macroscale version of the machine. I also proposed what parts are required and how to build those parts for a nanomachine.<br><br>In order to make a working, reliable nanomachine, a strong diamondoid shell must be made. Also, in order to carry out functions, the machine will need gears, axles, bearings, a power source, an internal computer, and many other things as detailed above. In all, manufacturing nanomachines with functions of a white blood cell is promising, although it will take many years to make one that can perform its functions with immaculate efficiency.<br><br>

CATALYST IMPROVEMENT FOR CARBON NANOTUBE SYNTHESIS BY CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION
Qilei Hang
Allegany High School, Cumberland MD, USA

Current industrial and research demand for carbon nanotubes (CNTs) far exceed the supply capability. A promising method to produce CNTs is by chemical vapor deposition, during which a hydrocarbon is decomposed for CNT synthesis. This research focused on increasing CNT growth productivity by improving the CNT catalyst used during such the chemical vapor deposition process. <br><br> The CNT growth catalyst consists of three main components: the growth activator, the decomposition aid, and the activator support. Iron, nickel, and cobalt were the activators; ammonium molybdate the decomposition aid; and aluminum oxide the catalyst support. At the beginning of this research, iron was found the most effective CNT growth activator when compared with cobalt and nickel. <br><br> Systematic experiments were subsequently performed for various catalyst component ratios of Fe : Mo : Al2O3. Mathematical analysis of such experimental data resulted in obtaining an optimum ratio of 1 : 0.16 : 1.65 for a single-activator catalyst, which produced a CNT yield of 657%.<br><br> To achieve even greater CNT yield, this research also explored the combination of all three activators in one catalyst sample, or “multi-activator” catalysts. Such a combination resulted in a CNT growth yield of 844%, the highest obtained in comparison with previously reported values for CNT growth using a similar chemical vapor deposition process. <br><br>

HINDERING OXIDATION
Jamal Kijana Roberts
Cass Tech, Detroit Michigan, United States

The purpose of this investigation is to determine the effects of different classes of natural antioxidants on the oxidation of soybean oil by measuring the peroxide by-products.<br><br>If garlic is used as the antioxidant, then the rate of oxidation of the soybean oil will be decelerated the most. Vitamin E will be the second most effective inhibitor of oxidation, Elderberry will be third most effective, and selenium will be the least effective antioxidant.<br><br>Prepare 4 0.1% antioxidant-oil solutions (0.1g of antioxidant to 100g of soybean oil). Prepare a control group of only soybean oil. Place a copper penny in all 5 oil samples. Leave the solutions stationary for 3 hours. Pour a sample of the garlic-oil solution into a Erlenmeyer flask. Add acetic acid-ether solution into the flask. Swirl the flask until completely dissolved. Add patassium iodine solution. Allow to stand with occasional shaking for 1 minute. Add 30ml if water. Titrate with sodium thiosulfate. Record how much sodium thiosulfate was used to eliminate the yellow color. repeat the previous process using the ohter antioxidant-oil solutions and the control group.<br><br>Vitamin E was the most effective antioxidant in this experiment,which proves the hypothesis was invalid. Elderberry was the second most effective antioxiant. Selenium ranked third. Garlic was the effective antioxidant.<br><br>This experiment is designed to narrow the search for an antioxidant that can replace the process of hydrogenating oils, which increases saturated and trans fats in the oils, which leads to increased risk of heart disease, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and obesity. In addition to replacing this process, antioxidant can also reduce the risk of cancer and aging by stopping free radicals from damaging cell membranes and DNA.

HOW DO DENDRITIC AGGREGATES FORM?
Kevin Chen Ni
Churchill Jr. High, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States of America

Snowflakes are common here in winter and I have often pondered how its branchlike (dendritic) structures are created. Basing my hypothesis on a type of random molecular motion, I thought about ways to test the concept of my hypothesis. There were no snow machines or laboratory environment available to me so I thought of performing the experiment by growing a cluster using electrolysis. The material used was not snow, but it was designed to be able to work with the experiment. Furthermore, I designed a computer program which would further simulate my hypothesis. After analyzing the results of my experiments, I researched the molecular structure of ice crystals. Applying the information I found to the results of my experiments, I formulated a rudimentary conjecture about the formation of snowflakes.

DESIGNING NOVEL MATERIALS FOR FUEL CELL MEMBRANES: AN AB INITIO MOLECULAR DYNAMICS STUDY OF PROTON TRANSPORT IN HETEROCYCLIC DIMERS
Eric T Roberts
Stuyvesant High School, New York, NY, USA

Recent demands for new energy resources have generated interest in fuel cell technology. Despite its social and scientific desirability, however, the widespread use of the fuel cell model in industry is limited, in particular, by the composition of the membrane system used to conduct cations that result from oxidation reactions at the anode of the fuel cell. This study selects for investigation four potential membrane systems––imidazole, squaric acid, tropolone, and malonaldehyde (based upon certain physical and chemical characteristics, such as their ability to be immobilized when attached to a polymer backbone chain, and their relatively high melting and boiling points)––that might make their use as membrane conductors possible. This study analyzes the efficiency of each of these systems as conductors by characterizing the activation energy barrier that proton-conducting dimers of imidazole, squaric acid, maloneldehyde, and tropolone would need to surmount in order to allow a single proton transfer reaction to occur. To describe the energetic and entropic "costs" of such a reaction, this study employs the statistical technique of ab initio Molecular Dynamics, which uses "on the fly" electronic structure calculations in combination with finite temperature dynamics, to obtain a statistical approximation of this activation energy barrier. This study also incorporates a number of qualitative physical models that help to describe the activation energy profiles generated by the Molecular Dynamics simulations.

CARBON SEQUESTRATION BY BAUXITE RESIDUE BAUXITE RESIDUE FROM INDUSTRIAL WASTE TO MITIGATION OF GLOBAL WARMING
Di Zhen Ye
Mt. Lebanon High School, Pittsburgh, PA, US

This project follows the goals of the current research to investigate an innovative approach for carbon sequestration by bauxite residue, which is a major aluminum industrial waste. 70 million tons of bauxite residue, or red mud is disposed worldwide annually with high alkalinity imparted from the Bayer Process. Many environmental concerns therefore rise to the attention. Alcoa Corporation had limited success with bauxite residue treatment in the past due to the economic concern. The project is conducted with Alcoa Corporation’s support with the bauxite residue sample. Through self-designed experiments, bauxite residue is able to capture carbon dioxide and has a significant pH drop to 7. The effect of slurry concentration on sequestration is observed, and the conclusion is drawn that the more the water, the greater the pH drop and the more the carbon dioxide can be captured. Meanwhile, the sequestration capacity of neutral bauxite residue slurry with the concentration of 56.oog bauxite residue and 49.0g distilled water at room temperature (25°C) is about 6.887727g carbon dioxide. If greater amount of sample is conducted with the same manner of this project, per ton of bauxite residue with 875kg distilled water can capture about 122.995125kg CO2. Likewise, to capture per ton of CO2 needs to consume about 8130.403542kg bauxite residue and 7114.1031kg distilled water. The overall optimistic result poses a potential alternative to lessen the greenhouse gas intensity of US while sustaining the economic growth needed to finance investment in new, clean energy technologies.<br><br>

SYNTHESIS AND ANALYSIS OF METAL CHLORIDE-SILICON ETHOXIDE SOL-GEL MATERIALS
Amy Marie Coffey
Smyrna High School, Smyrna, TN., USA

A study was conducted on silicon ethoxide sol-gel materials doped with selected metal chlorides of Li , Na , K , Ca , Fe , Co , Ni , and Cu . Two synthetic methods were used that added the metal chloride at different points during the reaction. In both methods, water, silicon ethoxide, and a metal chloride were combined in an ethyl alcohol solvent and stirred electronically for six days, upon which the solutions were poured out as liquids for solvent evaporation under normal atmospheric conditions. Samples of each product were exposed to heat.<br><br>KCl, CoCl , and NiCl solutions gelled during the stir period, implying varying reaction rates possibly due to differences in molar ratios and production of acid catalysts. Differences in the visible form and structure of the products that gelled early indicate the necessity of a drying period. <br><br>The remaining products revealed physical trends based on the metal’s periodic grouping as well as the individual natures of the metal chloride. Products containing metals from the alkali and alkaline groups appeared colorless; transition metal products produced colors of their hydrous states, indicating the presence of water in the products. Products were only temporarily dehydrated by heat exposure. Alkali and Alkaline metal products showed sensitivity to the different methods; transition metal products did not. Fracture degree varied among products.<br><br>Infrared analysis for each product produced the following stretching frequencies: one occuring just below 1100 cm , a second about 950 cm , and a third about 800 cm , denoting a Si-O terminal bond, Si-O bridging bond, and M-O bond.<br><br>

ZNS, DOPED-ZNS, CDS, ZNO NANOCRYSTALS SYNTHESIZED BY CHEMICAL REACTION WITH HIGH CONCENTRATION SOLUTIONS AT ROOM TEMPERATURE
Wei Zhang
Wuchang Experimental High School, Wuhan, Hubei, China

Based on literature research, an approach to synthesize nanocrystals with high concentration solutions ( the concentrations of reactants > 2.5mol/L ) by chemical reaction at room temperature is presented in this project .<br><br> The procedure is to make, at first, two kinds of high concentration solutions by solving corresponding sorts of substances which are easily dissoluble in water separately, then, to pour these solutions together and to mix by stirring, to synthesize nanocrystals of low solubility directly. <br><br> By this approach, ZnS, ZnS:Cd, ZnS:Mn, ZnS:Cu, CdS and ZnO nanocrytals are synthesized and their production rates > 90wt%. The nanocrystals are proved by the results of XRD and TEM. The average sizes of sulphide nanocrystals are 2.1 3.5nm. The ZnO nanocrytals are plate-like with 73 76nm in the average wide. The average size of nanocrystals formed by pouring is larger than that by dripping slightly. During reaction, high stirring speed will enhance crystallinity.The ZnS, Doped-ZnS nanocrystals are luminous. Their luminescent behaviors change with both type and content of separate dopants, which prove that the dopants entered the lattice of ZnS. <br><br> The experiments and result of novelty-checking have showen that the synthesis of ZnS, doped-ZnS, CdS, ZnO nanocrystals with high concentration solutions by chemical reaction at room temperature is a new and feasible method, which has many advantages, such as direct synthesis, no calcination, no age, easy incorporation of dopants, and high productivity.

ENGINEERING BIO-BASED INDUSTRIAL ACETIC ACID PRODUCTION
Christopher David Wood
Home-Schooled Syracuse New York, United States

Wood from trees is an abundant, environmentally friendly, renewable resource that has the potential to be a major feedstock for bio-based products. The wood used in the pulp and paper industry is a resource that could be utilized to a greater extent. A water extraction process for removing hemicellulose sugars (primarily the polymer Xylan which is largely lost in current pulping techniques) has been proposed as an additional step in the paper making process to utilize the hemicellulose fraction of wood as a fermentation feedstock. The product of this water extraction will require separation due to the acetic acid content of the product, which will inhibit fermentation.<br><br> In this study, I separated the primary components (acetic acid, xylose, and xylan) of this extraction process using nanofiltration (molecular separation) membranes from both Koch membrane systems and GE Osmonics. Testing on the Koch membranes was completed on bench scale equipment at Koch Membrane Systems. A Pilot scale system was developed for the testing of the Osmonics Membrane. Sample analysis procedures involving NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) and titration were adapted and employed to detect the concentrations of xylose, acetic acid, and several other organic compounds. The data collected demonstrates that the efficient separation of the primary components is possible using membrane technology. <br><br>

SELECTIVE PHOTOCATALYSIS OF DIMETHYLNAPHTHALENE BY MEANS OF BETA-CYCLODEXTRIN MOLECULAR RECOGNITION SITES
Nicole Elisa Goldstein
Dr. Michael M. Krop Senior High School, Miami FL, United States of America

Heterogeneous photocatalysis using titanium dioxide is a non-selective technique used for the degradation of target molecules such as dimethylnaphthalene. It is applicable towards degrading harmful substances, thus aiding in the process of oil clean ups and bioterrorism prevention. This work presents a novel approach for selective photocatalysis implementing molecular recognition sites (MRS) of beta-cyclodextrin placed in the vicinity of titanium dioxide. This attracts target molecules and shuttles them to the surface of titanium dioxide, where they are more rapidly and selectively degraded under ultraviolet radiation at 254 nm. The photodegradation rate of dimethylnaphthalene was studied under two variables: surface area and kinetics of titanium dioxide, as well as the presence of MRS. While improvement under zero order kinetics was not noteworthy, it was discovered that presence of MRS in conjunction with first order kinetics improves the degradation rate of dimethylnaphthalene by a significant 150 percent.

MAKING GOLD AT THE NANOSCALE
Aldo Elías Briano, Leonardo Cuello 
Southwestern Educational Society, Mayagüez, Puerto Rico

Nanotechnology encompasses the creation of materials, devices, and systems, through the manipulation of minuscule matter. The nano-scale is the natural threshold where living systems and machines operate. Gold is the ideal material for nano-scale electronic components due to its resistance to oxidation, mechanical robustness, and electrical conductivity. Within the nano-realm, properties fluctuate between particle sizes. Therefore, the understanding of all phenomena affecting the growth kinetics of nanoparticles is essential for their implementation in nano-devices.<br><br> The factors tested in this phase of the research were gold concentration and water/surfactant molar ratio (waterpool). Two types of colloids were synthesized: one with nanoparticles suspended in an aqueous solution and another in an organic phase. In the organic phase, the nanoparticles were inside reverse micelles. Several suspensions were made by mixing different concentrations of the reactants. After stabilizing, the colloids depicted diverse colors. Colloidal color is associated with particle size. With the use of a UV-Light Absorption Spectrometer, the wavelengths absorbed by the colloids were analyzed.<br><br> Applying Mie’s theory, the colloids’ plasmon served to determine nanoparticle sizes. Particles suspended in an aqueous solution ranged from 28.9nm-68.8nm, in reverse micelles from 10nm-60nm. Based on the results, the conclusions reached are: higher gold concentrations produce minute particles; and a waterpool less than 10 will produce smaller nanoparticles than those in non-micellar colloids. This research demonstrates that gold nanoparticles of a desired size can be synthesized, thus contributing to Nanotechnology’s high-tech goals.<br><br>

Aims: The purpose of this research is to help solve the impending energy crisis by exploring the probability of creating a comparatively cheap, viable, non-toxic and environmentally friendly energy source ?Fuel from air.<br><br>Method: To construct the Fuel Cell we only need some materials which we can buy from supermarket, such as table salt and aluminum sheet, together with a specially designed air cathode, which is a rectangular nickel mesh covered with carbon paste, Teflon?and catalysts such as silver nitrate, potassium permanganate, etc. The chemical equations involved in the fuel cell are as follows:<br><br> <br><br>Oxidation: Al(s) + 4OH-(aq) ---> [ Al(OH)4 ]-(aq) + 3e-<br><br>Reduction: O2(g) + 2H2O(l) + 4e- ---> 4OH-(aq)<br><br>Overall: 4Al(s) + 4OH-(l)+ 3O2(g) + 6H2O(l) ---> 4[ Al(OH)4 ]-(aq)<br><br>When Oxygen in air passes through the air cathode, it mixes with water and gains electrons to form hydroxide ions. At the same time, the aluminum reacts with hydroxide ions in the electrolyte and releases electron and aluminate ions are formed at the same time. With the transfer of electrons electricity is then generated. Our air cathode is made by a unique method, which makes the cell cost only one fifth of a conventional commercial dry cell.<br><br>Result: There are other favourable factors that make our cell unique. If further developments are made, our aluminium-air fuel cell will be a panacea to the world's environmental problems.<br><br>

Detergent is one of the necessities in our daily life and phosphate is a common chemical found in detergent. However, phosphate can lead to eutrophication. <br><br>Part 1: Determining the phosphate content in different brands of detergent through precipitation and Molybdenum method.<br><br>[A] Precipitation Method: Aluminium ion, calcium ion and iron(III) ion react with phosphate ion in detergents to form insoluble metal phosphate. The greater the mass of precipitate formed, the higher the phosphate content in the detergents.<br><br>[B] Molybdenum Method: Phosphate in detergents combines with hetamolybdate to form a yellow complex. When ascorbic acid is added, the yellow complex turns blue as the oxidation state of molybdenum changes from +6 to +5. By comparing the absorbance of detergent solutions with a calibration curve, the phosphate content can be obtained. Results of Part 1 show that 'Brand A' has a high phosphate content.<br><br>Part 2: Using household products to make two types of environmental-friendly detergents.<br><br>[A] Homemade Detergent-1: Both baking soda and ammonia are alkalis which react with grease to form soap.<br><br>[B] Homemade Detergent-2: Both egg yolk and soya flour contain lecithin, which is an emulsifying agent having regions that associate with oil and water respectively.<br><br>In Part 2, best emulsifying effect can be obtained when baking soda is mixed with ammonia and vinegar. Egg yolk in neutral medium can also help cleaning oily dirt.<br><br>To conclude, when we choose our detergent, we should not only focus on its cleansing ability, but also their effects on the environment.<br><br>

Colegio De La Salle, Talca, Chile

Organic production has become increasingly important in recent years. Nevertheless availability of alternative pesticides is still limited. Based on this, trials were developed to evaluate the use of “Cinnamon extracts” (CE) as an organic biopesticide. <br><br>CE were prepared by means of distillation and diluted on distilled water at different concentrations in order to test its effects on different plant species. At the laboratory CE was tested for herbicide properties on Zea Maiz, Phaseolus vulgaris and Lens culinaris plantlets. Additionally a field trial was carried out with a Brassica campestris population. These trials allowed us to determine the effectiveness of CE as an organic herbicide. Also, a secondary effect with fungicide properties in plantlets was observed. <br><br>In order to verify this last finding a new set of two trials was developed: i) an in vitro trial with Penicillium spp. using the “Kirby Bauer” technique and ii) a commercial cold stored fruit test with apples inoculated with Botrytis cinerea.<br><br>After evaluation of laboratory assay plantlets, it was possible to verify a partial/total growth inhibition effect of CE depending on the plant species. This effect was also observed under field conditions. In vitro trial results confirmed the fungicide properties of CE on Penicillium spp. evidencing a significant inhibition halo in treated plates. Finally, cold stored apples showed minimal damage of grey mold on the treated samples when compared even with commercial organic fungicides.<br><br>The above results show the potential of CE as an alternative fungicide for organic fruit and vegetable production.<br><br>

Manila Science High School, Manila, Philippines

A series of tests in this study show that green mussels (Perna viridis) can be used as the modifier for chemically modified carbon paste electrodes for detecting and quantifying Lead (II)in water samples. The capability of green mussels to accumulate Lead (II) is due to the metallothionein, metal-binding protein, present in green mussels.<br><br>Mussels were collected and treated in a heavy metal contaminated environment for three days. These were homogenized and placed in a freeze-drying machine. In its powder form, they were used as modifier in paste form for the electrode by mixing it with graphite powder and mineral oil with varying concentrations. The cyclic and differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry of the electrodes were determined. These electrodes were later used for accumulating Lead (II) to test their capability to detect and quantify Lead (II), the best analyte.<br><br>The results obtained showed a linear correlation having a coefficient of 0.99118. From this correlation, it is concluded that the accuracy of the electrodes is 98.24%

FABRICATION OF A CARBON NANOTUBE SENSOR TO DETECT LEAD IONS IN WATER
Priya Gupta, Kathleen Li
Shepton HS, Plano, Texas, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to fabricate a sensor, made from carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and coated with a dithizone reagent, which shows a resistance change in the presence of lead ions in water. Samples were tested with HiPCo dispersed in Triton-X and Vitamin E. The experiment also tried to determine if CNTs and dithizone could be used in combination to transfer property variations (i.e. resistance variations) occuring in the dithizone into the CNTs, when exposed to lead (II) nitrate solution.<br><br> Sensors, made from single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and plated with nickel and gold, were first measured for resistance in water. Lead (II) nitrate was then added in various amounts while resistance continued to be calculated. The first addition of lead was when the resistance in water had become stable, and it showed roughly a ten percent decrease in resistance (-11% to -20%). This was the most significant change, although it was the smallest addition of lead, possibly because the dithizone was fresh and had not previously been exposed to any metal ion. <br><br> The implications of this project can be applied to both commercial production and laboratory research. After further modification, the project aims to create cheap lead sensors for in-home use to detect lead concentrations at 15ppb, the legal limit for lead concentration in drinking water. Additionally, if dithizone and CNTs can function together, CNTs could also be combined with other chemicals or reagents to detect various toxic substances.

QUANTUM YIELD STUDIES OF SINGLET OXYGEN PRODUCTION BY SQUARE PLANAR PLATINUM(II) COMPLEXES
Henry Fong, Allen Tran, Johanna Tang
Alhambra High School, Alhambra, California, USA

Singlet oxygen, the excited form of dioxygen, is of great interest to many research groups because of its reactivity with biomolecules including nucleic acids and some amino acids. Our previous research has found that bis-cyclometallated Iridium(III) complexes sensitize the production singlet oxygen in high quantum yields. However, nothing is known whether complexes possessing other metals are also efficient sensitizers. Therefore, the quantum yields of singlet oxygen from a new class from square planar Platinum(II) complexes is of great interest. <br><br> The quantum yields of singlet oxygen production and quenching rates of these Platinum(II) complexes are presented. Time-resolved laser spectroscopy was employed in this study. Platinum(II) complexes were excited 355nm wavelengths to generate singlet oxygen. Singlet oxygen decay (luminescence) was detected using a near-infrared luminescence detector and compared with known sensitizer quantum yields to determine the singlet oxygen quantum yields of our complexes. Quenching rates, i.e. the rates of singlet oxygen deactivation, were also measured using laser spectroscopy. <br><br> The quantum yields of singlet oxygen of the Platinum(II) complexes are high (0.9-1.0), and quenching rates are slow. From these high quantum yields compared to the Iridium(II) analogues it is concluded that the energy transfer from the excited sensitizer to oxygen does occur at the metal center. In all, we have an excellent new class of singlet oxygen sensitizers. Our findings add to the current understanding of metal-centered sensitizers and will provide researchers with a blueprint for the synthesis of new sensitizers for photodynamic therapy. <br><br>

ICE SPIKE FORMATION IN THE PRESENCE OF A STRONG WIND
Samantha Van Anh Tran, Kristina Navarro Tubera
Presentation High School, San Jose, California, USA

The formation of ice spikes during the freezing process of H2O was the subject of our investigation. Spikes do not form under all conditions. The objective of this experiment was to characterize the specific conditions of ice spike formation. It was hypothesized that the formation of ice spikes depends upon the temperature of the environment chamber and the mineral content of the water. The experiment was conducted by testing various types of water (i.e. Arrowhead Steam-Distilled, Alhambra Crystal Fresh Reverse-Osmosis Drinking Water, and Santa Clara City Tap Water) in different ice cube containers (plastic and aluminum). A controlled environmental chamber was used to conduct the trials. Containers were filled with the same amount of water with and without contaminants. Spike growth was continually monitored over a range of temperatures (-5ºC to -30ºC). The process was continually observed with a video recorder. Ice spike formation is best in a non-aluminum container using distilled water at -11ºC to -20ºC. In conclusion, any minimal amount of sediment, particles, or minerals present in the water prevented the formation of ice spikes. The internal pressure that builds up the ice cell results in bulges and cracks, which eventually pave the way for the formation of ice spikes. Ice spike growth continues to a certain limit, yet further research must be done to determine the nature of this process. It was concluded that the research hypothesis of this project was fully supported because: 1. Ice spikes of different character formed in distilled water at a variety of temperatures; 2. Ice spikes did not form in Santa Clara City Tap Water due to its mineral content; 3. Ice spikes did not form in distilled water contaminated by NaCl; 4. It appears that the smallest amount of contamination inhibited ice spike formation. The hypothesis that was made about the process by which ice cells and ice spikes form was supported by observations and measurements during the test runs. <br><br>

ATMOSPHERIC CHEMICAL INSTABILITIES

Homogeneous, gas-phase, atmospheric chemical processes revolve around the 6 molecular species CO, O3, NO , NO2 , HO and HO2 . Stability in an open photochemical system involving these six dynamic chemical species varies with changes in the emission rates of CO, O3, and NO . This system, as represented by a simple photochemical mechanism derived from tropospheric chemistry, is inherently nonlinear and can display regions or periods of instability. Oscillations or multiple stationary states can be revealed by applying a form of differential stability analysis of the kinetic equations describing the behavior of the system. This analysis shows bifurcations with variations in the source rate. The bifurcations characterize multiple transitions from regions of chemical stability to monotonic growth, confirming a previously discovered region of stability and revealing the possibility of a second. Application of Martin Feinberg’s network analysis procedure to this chemical-network structure has shown that the system could potentially exhibit an infinite number of unstable steady states. In applying observed rate constants to the chemical reactions, the system has been numerically integrated to determine the concentration at equilibrium of every chemical species. By slightly varying the source rate of NO so that the system’s equilibrium status is not perturbed, non-linear behavior of the chemical system can be observed. At a given emission rate of NO , several chemical species reach multiple equilibrium states. More interestingly, steady status for most species is reached after billions of years and chemical species can find an infinite number of pseudo-equilibrium states, according to degree of perturbation of the emission rate of NO .

A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF ETHANOL PRODUCTION POTENTIAL: RECYCLED CELLULOSE VS. INNOVATIVE BIOMASS
Ashley Nicole Sylvester
Greybull High School, Greybull, WY, USA

As a new energy crisis threatens the United States the demand for alternatives such as ethyl alcohol has increased and made this option much more viable. One of the major drawbacks of ethanol production is the expense of producing it. This is due to the high cost to farmers to harvest the plants being used. If there was a method to reduce costs, then use of alcohol as a fuel may be a much more economically feasible approach to producing increased energy supplies. Even better would be an approach that takes something regarded as garbage and changes it into something that would value and applications. This research investigates some options for ethanol production. The procedure began by collecting and fermenting a variety of different plant-based materials, some primarily cellulose-based (papers) and some biomass derived (plant wastes & portions) After fermentation, products were distilled to determine amounts of ethanol.<br><br> The experimental sample that produced the highest level of ethanol was sugar beet pulp with a volume of 5.5 mL. The second highest yield was the bean discard, which produced 4.5 mL. Following these values were bean waste (2.8 mL), pink copy paper (2.4 mL), and white copy paper (0.2 mL). Some ethanol was extracted from all tested products. The beet pulp, with the highest amount of sugar, produced the most alcohol. This is likely because the pulp contains a higher percentage of monosaccharides, such as glucose and disaccharides, such as sucrose. These sugar groups are easier to break down. All of the biomass materials had higher levels of ethanol than the cellulose-based materials. This again points to the fact that simple sugars are more readily fermented.<br><br> Ethanol, particularly from innovative biomass sources, could provide an answer to the growing concerns over the price and availability of fossil fuels.<br><br>

SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF SIZE- AND SHAPE- SELECTED METAL NANOPARTICLES USING INVERSE DIBLOCK COPOLYMER MICELLES
Grady Clark Slane
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, FL, United States

Metal clusters <10nm display unusual electronic, chemical and optical properties. Chemically inactive metals such as gold start to display enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity. These remarkable properties seem to correlate with the appearance of semiconductive behavior with decreasing cluster size. This cannot be fundamentally explained although it is believed that these unique properties are relative to the size, shape, and support of the metal nanoparticles. The goal of this project is to analyze the physical, chemical and electronic properties of metal nanoparticles and their supports, and to develop a system for supported, size-controlled nanoparticles representative of real world catalysts. The hypothesis of this research supports the longstanding theory that this selectivity found in metal nanoparticles is related to the nanoparticle size, shape and nanoparticle interactions. <br><br> This research involves producing a series of metal nanoparticle samples with different sizes. This is done by adding the polymer poly(styrene)-block-poly(2-vinylpyridine) with varying molecular weights into vials of the solvent toluene. This solution creates inverse micelles. HAuCl4 is then added to the solution whereupon it diffuses into the micelles. SiO2 substrates are dip coated in the solution and studied under AFM for structural data. Subsequently, the samples are exposed to hydrogen plasma for polymer removal. AFM is again used analyze the structure and formation of the nanoparticles. AFM analysis showed highly uniform nanoparticle distribution from at least two of the five polymer weights and semi-uniform distribution in the remaining three polymer weights. Further physical, chemical and electronic analysis is currently underway.

SYNTHESIS, CHARACTERIZATION, AND STABILITY ANALYSIS OF POLY(ACRYLATE) NANOPARTICLES THROUGH EMULSION POLYMERIZATION TECHNIQUE
Amit Ramesh Patel
Astronaut High School, Titusville Fl, USA

Nanoparticles, spherical materials with sizes ranging in nanometers, have drawn intense interest in the past few years due to their potential in a variety of applications. One application of nanoparticles made of polymer is in the field of drug delivery. By using the hydrophobic region of a polymer nanoparticle, a delivery system can be created that would allow insoluble drugs to be utilized. However, one of the greatest obstacles in this field is the synthesis procedure that is used to fabricate the nanoparticles. Often, the nanoparticles that are created are not uniform in size and are synthesized by inefficient techniques which require a lot of machinery, time, and money. <br><br> In this study, novel poly(acrylate) nanoparticles are synthesized using a simple procedure that requires surfactant, monomer, water, and radical initiator. It was believed that the size of the nanoparticles could be controlled by making changes in the parameters that influence the emulsion system. SEM microscopy reveals that the nanoparticles created through this technique are of spherical shape. Furthermore, dynamic light scattering indicates that the nanoparticles size varied dependent upon the parameters. R squared values for the correlations established in this study were above .94. The results of this study suggest that these nanoparticles are homogeneous and are stable enough for use in drug delivery.

ANALYSIS OF OXALIC CRYSTALS IN VITRO
Saida Bibie Hussain
McArthur High School, Hollywood FL, United States of America

My purpose in this research is to study the effects of oxalic acid crystal formation in vitro. Percentage solutions of 10%, 15%, and 20% of oxalic acid are made and the placed in separate wells of a sepup tray and then placed in an incubator. Each percentage is separated into 3, 5, and 10 mL per tray. The trays are checked on daily for crystal formation, the crystal size, the crystal system, and amount of time for crystal formation. This is a baseline study determining the effects of crystal formation, size of crystals, and percentage concentrations and to see if certain elements stimulate growth. <br><br> All oxalic acid solutions formed crystals in the tetragonal and hexagonal system. The 10mL always formed fewer but larger crystals when compared to the 3 or 5mL solution regardless the percentage of the solution. Over 100 crystals were made and observed. Since X2 05=43.77 > X2 s=17.15 for magnesium, do not reject the null hypothesis. There was no significant difference in crystal size. Since X2 05 = 43.77> X2 s=10.22 for calcium phosphate, do not reject null hypothesis. There was no significant difference in crystal size. Also since, fs=2.775 >f.05 2.10, reject null hypothesis. There was a significant difference when all percentage solutions of the control were compared. <br><br> By getting a better understanding of oxalic crystal formation in vitro, society may be able to better understand calcium oxalate crystal formation in vivo as kidney stones. Understanding the development of calcium oxalate crystals can possibly help treat or prevent the formation of kidney stones.<br><br>

SYNTHESIS OF FULLERENE DERIVATIVES FOR DESIGN OF DONOR-ACCEPTOR DYADS
Aleksey Borisovich Kornev
Lyceum #1, Bryansk, Bryansky region, Russia

Fullerenes possess unique photophysical properties and are widely used as electron acceptor units in various donor-acceptor systems. The most promising are non-covalently bonded dyads formed from fullerene derivatives bearing chelating groups and metalloporphyrins. Such self-assembled systems mimic natural photosynthetic antenna and are potential materials for solar energy conversion. <br><br>An efficient synthetic route to pyrrolidinofullerenes bearing pyridyl groups was developed in our laboratory. It is based on [2+3]cycloaddition of azomethine ylides formed from picolylamines and aldehydes. High product yields (65-85%) were obtained when 2-picolylamines were used as substrates, 4-picolylamines gave much lower yields (15-35%), while 3-picolylamines did not give ylides in these reactions. <br><br>We investigated catalysis of [2+3]cycloaddition reactions of [60]fullerene by organic bases (DBU, DABCO) and acids (acetic, butyric). The acids were found to be the best catalysts that allowed pyrrolidinofullerenes to be synthesized from 4-picolylamines with 65-70% yields, which are twice higher than those previously obtained. Moreover, azomethine ylides were generated from 3-picolylamines under acidic catalysis and corresponding pyrrolidinofullerenes were isolated with 75-80% yields. Up to our best knowledge, we observed the first catalytic [2+3]cycloaddition to [60]fullerene; the synthesized novel fullerene derivatives were used as materials for organic solar cells (LIOS, Austria). <br><br>We also developed the first efficient method to synthesize and isolate fluorofullerene C60F18. This compound is a much stronger electron acceptor than [60]fullerene and is currently used in the design of novel donor-acceptor systems with improved properties.

IN SITU SYNTHESIS OF GOLD NANOPARTICLES IN POLYMERIC NANOFIBERS
Aldo Elías Briano
Southwestern Educational Society, Mayaguez, Puerto Rico

Nonwoven nanofibers are meshes of polymers that are being implemented in high efficiency filter media, protective clothing, drug release membranes, nanotube materials, chemical catalysts, biotransplant materials, and tissue engineering. These nano-textiles are produced through a process called electrospinning. Electrospinning consists of an electrified metal nozzle through which a polymer solution is pumped, and a grounded collecting plate. As the electric field is increased, a jet bursts toward the collecting plate and nanofibers are formed. The morphology of the nanofibers formed can be controlled by manipulating the flow rate, the distance between electrodes, and the applied voltage.<br><br> The purpose of this research was to develop a novel material using electrospinning of polymer nanofibers. By modifying the electrospinning process and through UV photolytic reactions, gold nanoparticles were synthesized inside the polymer nanofibers. The nanofibers with gold nanoparticles were viewed using a Scanning Electron Microscope and a Transmission Electron Microscope to analyze the surface and the inner structure. The TEM demonstrated that gold nanoparticles are found throughout the nanofiber interior. The potential use of this material includes, but is not limited to, electrical conductors for future nanomachines or computer hardware and biomedical applications such as a scaffold in which the gold can be used to detect pathogens or toxins that may harm the body. Gold was selected for this research due to prior experience and its characteristic electrical conductivity, mechanical robustness, and resistance to oxidation. Nevertheless, future research may include the synthesis of nanoparticles of other materials in polymer nanofibers. <br><br>

ISOLATION OF CAMPHOR FROM CAMPHOR TREE (CINNAMONUM CAMPHORA). DOES IT OBEY THE LAW OF CONSTANT COMPOSITION?
Jonathan Adolfo Narvaez
Bradenton Academy, Bradenton, Florida, USA

This experiment was designed to extract, isolate, and purify camphor from a camphor tree (Cinnamonum camphora) and to see if the % composition of the isolated material supports the law of constant composition. I hypothesized that I would be able to do this.<br><br>Camphor leaves from a camphor tree (Cinnamonum camphora) were ground, weighed, and subjected to steam distillation. The steam distillate was poured into a separatory funnel to give a dichloromethane solution of essential oils. The oil extract and a sample of commercially-available camphor were subjected to Thin-Layer Chromatography (TLC) and Gas Chromatograph (GC) analyses. TLC of the oil extract showed three spots (Rf 0.10mm, 0.27mm, 0.74mm) while the commercially-available camphor showed two spots (Rf 0.10mm, and 0.27mm). The TLC data suggest that camphor is present in the oil. The GC showed that camphor is the main component in the oil extract (~96%) while the standard camphor sample proved to be ~ 98% pure. The crude, yellowish camphor was sublimed to yield a white, crystalline solid that was sent out for elemental analysis. The analytical results showed that the isolated camphor and the commercial sample had the same composition within experimental error (%78.60 C, 10.77% H; 78.81% C, 10.76% H, respectively).<br><br>My hypothesis was proven correct, I was able to extract, isolate, and purify camphor from a camphor tree. Furthermore, elemental analysis of the isolated material supports the law of constant composition as hypothesized. I plan to analyze and compare all of my camphor samples using GC analysis on another instrument that has computer integration software.<br><br>

CHANGES IN TEAR SURFACE TENSION AFTER EXPOSURE TO SECOND-HAND SMOKE
Katherine Elizabeth Reichert
Columbia High School, Lake City, Florida, USA

This experiment investigated whether second-hand smoke increases tear surface tension as a mechanism for exacerbating dry eye syndrome. A capillary method was used to measure the surface tension of artificial tears without smoke exposure (control) or with exposure to smoke from either regular or light cigarettes (variable). A device was created to safely generate the cigarette smoke. Artificial tear surface tension was increased by 29% by exposure to regular cigarette smoke and 9% by light cigarette smoke. Therefore, an increase in tear surface tension may be a mechanism for early tear film break-up and exacerbation of dry eye syndrome in persons exposed to second-hand cigarette smoke.

AN INVESTIGATION OF BIOACTIVE CERAMIC MATERIALS: EFFICIENT MEDIA MILLING TECHNIQUES FOR BIOGLASS 45S5 (R) COMPOSITES
Kayla L. Paulk
Blanche Ely High School, Pompano Beach, Florida, USA

Bioglass 45s5 ® is a revolutionary substance used to promote bone repair for orthopedic, dental, and surgical applications. The goal of Bioglass 45s5® is to essentially restore bone to its prior potential. One of the barriers to this product’s success in the body is its inconsistent reaction rate, due to inefficient distribution and differences in surface area. Sometimes the success of this material is dependent on the reaction rate, a function of particle size. An efficient method to counteract this effect would be to mill <br><br> Bioglass 45s5 ® in a wet mill with a fixed media. With a controlled reaction rate, Bioglass 45s5 can essentially become a better product for application. Several methods for manipulating Bioglass 45s5 ® were used for this purpose. A wet mill was set at speeds ranging from 2000 to 4000 rpm (rotations per minute) using different sized milling media. Another approach to controlling bioglass reaction was to suspend milled bioglass powder in a porous sol-gel silica support. This mesoporous material restricts the diffusion of ions released from the bioglass, thus controlling reaction rate. If silica glass utilized as media were used to mill Bioglass 45s5 ®, then the resulting material powder would be significantly more controllable and more efficiently applied to biomedicine.

ISOLATION, CHARACTERIZATION OF BETA-CHITIN FROM SQUID PENS AND CALCIUM CARBONATE CRYSTALLIZATION ON THE CHITIN SCAFFOLD
YouJia Zhong
Raffles Junior College, Singapore, Singapore

Chitin, a polysaccharide common in biocomposites, has an interwoven organic framework that can act as a scaffold for mineralization in natural systems. Acidic amino acids, namely aspartic and glutamic acids, are the primary active molecules at biomineralization interphases in mollusks. They also play an important role in controlling the polymorph and morphology of the associated mineral. In the present study, chitin was extracted from squid pens and functionalized with these amino acids before using it as a scaffold to crystallize calcium carbonate from saturated calcium bicarbonate solution. XRD and SEM images were used to investigate the polymorph and morphology of the crystals that resulted. We identified that the presence of aspartic acid on the chitin scaffold favoured formation of amorphous calcium carbonate whereas glutamic acid on chitin induced nucleation of calcitic polymorph. Addition of biomacromolecules isolated from a mollusk (cuttlefish bone) to the chitin-amino acid assemblage formed calcium carbonate crystals with interesting, unique morphologies.

EVALUATION OF CIS-CIS HOONO PRODUCTION BY LASER PHOTOLYSIS THROUGH MODELING OF REACTION KINETIC
Da Lin
Westview High School, Portland, Oregon, U.S.A

The formation of cis-cis HOONO from the reaction of OH and NO2 in the atmosphere will directly affect predictions of ozone production in polluted urban air. Laboratory studies to detect cis-cis HOONO and quantify its yield from this reaction under atmospheric conditions are critical to atmospheric models, but have proven to be very challenging. A reaction rate model was developed to investigate the feasibility of laser photolysis-initiated experimentation. Necessary initial conditions were determined for the formation of a detectable concentration of cis-cis HOONO while providing accurate HOONO:HNO3 yields at 30, 100, and 500 Torr and 298 K. Analysis of predicted models identified 16 secondary reactions that can alter the cis-cis HOONO concentrations and the apparent yield. Further studies determined the importance of several free radical concentrations for experimental studies. Based on the simulation results, cis-cis HOONO has been detected using IR cavity ringdown spectroscopy at 13 and 90 Torr and 298 K.

FROM SYNTHESIS TO ANALYSIS OF RADICAL INHIBITORS
Stephen Schulz
Gesamtschule Buer-Mitte, Gelsenkirchen, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany

Flavonoids are well known as strong radical inhibitors. Therefore they are interesting as drugs against cancer and other diseases. My aim was to synthesize and analyze a diversity of flavone-type compounds by the use of combinatorial methods.For both synthesis and analysis new electrochemical methods have been developed. The process was miniaturized to a “lab on a chip”.The flavones were synthesized by Kolbe synthesis starting from phenylacetic acids and phenylpropionic acid. The reagents were synthesized starting from benzaldehyde via Reformatzky synthesis.An improved electrochemical modification was developed for this direction.The reaction mechanism of this process has been investigated using 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy- and 3-hydroxy-2-methoxy -benzaldehyde as reagents.The product was identified by IRspectroscopy.The yield was 43% compared to 5% of the classical synthesis.This modified Reformatzky synthesis starting from benzaldehyde opens a broad range of reagents,including other organo- metallic compounds. 36 reagents using 6 different educts were prepared. The analytical methods use the radical systems consisting of 4-amino-N,N-dimethylaniline or 2,2-diphenyl-picrylhydrazyl. The activity can be shown electrochemically by the reaction of alkyl-radicals, and hydrogenperoxide radicals and Fe(II)-compounds with radical inhibitors. The complete process was down-sized on a „lab on a chip“.This analytical package including overall 8 methods results in a more differentiated analysis to test the activity of radical inhibitors than established methods. A electrochemical modification of the Reformatzky reaction was developed to synthesize a broad range of flavonoids with improved yield, also applicable to the synthesis of Zn-organic compounds. The activity of the radical inhibitors was tested with a new “lab on a chip”technology which gives access to high throughput testing.

NATURAL DYES - THE DELICIOUS WAY
Hoi Lam Anne Tsang
St. Paul's Convent School, Hong Kong SAR, China.

In the 21st century, the importance of environmental conservation brings to people's attention environmentally friendly natural dyes. However, natural dyes are unstable. In this project, I would like to find out suitable natural binding agents to stabilize natural dyes.<br><br> Chlorophyll was chosen as the dye and cotton as the fabric. When cotton fabric is soaked in chlorophyll dye, H-bonds are formed between chlorophyll molecules and cotton fibres. <br><br> In part 1, egg yolk, egg white, soya milk, soya flour and gelatin were tested to see whether they could be used as binding agents and their most effective concentrations were determined. Both egg yolk and soya beans contain lecithin. Lecithin consists of water-soluble and fat-soluble portions, which facilitate the H-bonds formation and confer emulsifying properties. The amphoteric character and hydrophobic areas on the peptide chain give gelatin emulsion stabilizing properties. Egg yolk was found to be the most effective binding agent, with optimum concentration at one part egg yolk to 3.5 parts water, while the optimum concentration of gelatin was 3g to 45ml of water.<br><br> In part 2, the effect of light, heat, washing and change of pH on chlorophyll dye at the most effective concentration of egg yolk and gelatin were investigated. Egg yolk was proved to be the better binding agent, increasing the colourfastness and lightfastness of chlorophyll dye as well as improving the vibrancy of its colour. Lecithin was probably a better binding agent than gelatin and egg yolk was a rich source of lecithin among many natural substances.<br><br>

DIGITALLY-ENHANCED THIN-LAYER CHROMATOGRAPHY: AN INEXPENSIVE, NEW TECHNIQUE FOR QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS
Amber Victoria Irish Hess
Stevenson School, Pebble Beach, CA, USA

Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) is a widely used method for qualitative analysis such as determining the number of components in a mixture, determining the identity of substances, or monitoring the progress of a reaction. The more accurate high-performance TLC (HPTLC) is better suited for quantitative analysis. Unfortunately, HPTLC requires expensive equipment that most high schools and colleges cannot afford.<br><br> I demonstrate that if digital photography is combined with regular TLC, it can perform highly improved qualitative analysis as well as make accurate quantitative analysis possible. <br><br> This novel, “digitally-enhanced” TLC (DE TLC) is very easy to use. A fluorescent TLC plate is illuminated with UV light and a picture of the plate is taken with a digital camera. Then, on a computer, using either TLC Analyzer, the public domain software I wrote, or common photo-editing software, one can quickly produce multi-spectral scans, densitograms, and calibration curves–output previously available only from more expensive equipment or complex procedures. With high linearity (R² ~ 0.97 – 0.99), good repeatability (RSD < 5%), and detection limits approaching those of HPTLC, DE TLC produces surprisingly good results for such inexpensive equipment.<br><br> Digitally-enhanced TLC is a valuable tool that can be added to every chemist’s TLC toolbox. Since this technique is much less expensive than other quantitative chromatographic methods, DE TLC is ideal for high school and college labs.<br><br>

OXIDATION OF DOPAMINE BY HIGH-VALENT MANGANESE: A LINK TO NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDERS?
Smita Mascharak
Santa Cruz High School, Santa Cruz, CA, USA

The purpose this experiment was to determine whether high-valent manganese compounds oxidize dopamine (a neurotransmitter). It also examined whether cysteine (a sulfur-containing amino acid) interferes with this oxidation. Loss of dopamine (and the presence of cysteine-derived neurotoxins) has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases like Manganism (similar to Parkinson’s). <br><br>It was hypothesized that (a) dopamine will be oxidized by high-valent manganese minerals to neurotoxic products, (b) cysteine will intervene that oxidation and (c) the products of the reactions will be known neurotoxins. <br><br>The oxidation of dopamine by compounds containing manganese in various oxidation states was followed spectrophotometrically. Typically, a batch of ~10 mg of the Mn compound was added to a solution of dopamine in DI water or phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and the oxidation products were analyzed by monitoring the electronic absorption spectra. The courses of the same reactions after the addition of cysteine were also monitored in a similar fashion. The mechanism of the oxidation was explored by intervening the oxidation reactions at various time intervals and identifying the products at selected times. It was demonstrated that first a surface complex between high-valent manganese and the catecholate moiety of dopamine is formed. Electron transfer from the ring to the manganese center then affords quinones (identified by fluorescence spectrometry) and Mn(II) (identified by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy). In addition, the formation of hydroxide ions raises the pH of the reaction mixture. <br><br>The results were correlated to the conditions observed in affected areas of the brains of Manganism patients. <br><br>

THE USE OF DENITRIFYING BACTERIA IN THE REMOVAL OF NITROUS OXIDES FROM BIOMASS POWER GENERATION EMISSIONS
Timothy Paul Kendrick
Lakeview High School, Lakeview, Oregon, United States of America

Lakeview is a small, quiet timber town in Southeast, Oregon, with two large problems. Due to the fact that four out of the five timber companies in the town have gone out of business, the health of the forest surrounding town is terrible, it is overstocked resulting in massive forest fires. Lake County has had some of the worst fires in the United States in the past five years. Because of the extreme fire danger, Lake County resources Initiative (a non-profit corporation) is pursuing the construction of a biomass fueled power generation facility in this small community. This would provide jobs, electricity, and income for the town, as well as reduce the fire danger in the surrounding forests. <br><br> The purpose of this project is to find a way to maintain air quality, while bringing a biomass power generation facility to the area. The biomass plant will produce many pollutants, including Carbon Monoxide, Nitrous Oxides, and Carbon Particulates. This project id focused on the percentage of nitrous oxides produced from various species of trees found in the forests around Lakeview, and in the conversion of these Nitrous Oxides to Nitrogen gas, without using large amounts of toxic chemicals like Ammonia. I propose the use if Denitrifying Bacteria to reduce the Nitrous Oxide emissions over Lakeview, Oregon. <br><br>

STABLE DISPERSIONS OF CRYSTALLINE TITANIUM DIOXIDE NANOPARTICLES

This project investigates approaches to producing stable dispersions, which is a critical step in order for nanomaterials to be used successfully in many applications. Specifically, the purpose was to develop a method to produce a stable dispersion of crystalline titanium dioxide nanoparticles in a liquid medium. This particular material is among the most difficult metal oxides to disperse and no published record of this being accomplished was found.<br><br>A series of experiments were conducted using pre-manufactured nanoparticles purchased as large, agglomerated clusters. Various approaches were explored and it was confirmed that techniques such as surfactants, high mechanical energy, and charge, that are useful to disperse micron particles are not effective with nanoparticles. <br><br>Eventually a novel method was developed where mechanical energy was applied to the agglomerates in the presence of an acid which was imparting charge to the primary particles. This method showed outstanding and reproducible results, supporting the hypothesis that it was possible to create a stable dispersion of crystalline titanium dioxide nanoparticles. <br><br>Mastering the subject dispersions will allow significant advances in numerous applications, achieving properties that cannot be attained using amorphous analogs or larger particles. Examples include thin film coatings where extremely high refractive index is critical while maintaining transparency. These are increasingly important in optics and photonics due to the reduction of reflection losses and hence, increased light output from devices such as light emitting diodes. Other applications range from antiglare coatings for lenses; photovoltaic cells; fog proof glass and self cleaning, disinfecting surfaces.<br><br>

IMPLICATION AND FORMULATION OF SILANE BASED OPTICAL COATINGS WITH ORGANIC AND INORGANIC COMPOUNDS TO PROHIBIT UV RADIATION
Chen Wang
Huron High School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA 

The purpose of this research work is to investigate, design, and analyze four silane based optical coatings on glass substrate to block harmful UV. The idea is to use a silane coupling agent to create an optical polymer film with micron thickness. Then the founctional UV absorber chemicals were used to modify polymer thin film for absorbing ultraviolet radiation. The designed coating showed over 95% UV blocking and 90% visible light spectrum transmission. Several coating methods were also investigated in the lab to identify their advantages and disadvantages, including dip coating, flow coating, draw bar coating, and spray coating. <br><br><br>The coating matrix was created by silane coupling agent of epoxycyclohexyl and several UV absorbers: two kinds of benzophenone chemicals, Titanium organic silane, and pre-dispersed inorganic titanic nano-particle solution. The 4in by 4in glass samples were cut from regular uncoated glass and were carefully washed to eliminate surface contaminations. The coatings were then applied to the glass surface and preheated at 100ºC for 5 minutes and fully cured at 200ºC for 10 minutes. <br><br><br>Based on the spectrum analysis, my Benzo-Organic successfully blocked over 95% UV spectral with great optical properties. The other coating formulas also showed efficiency in blocking 88.2%, 22.1%, and 48.4% of UV radiation. It was found that the four coating techniques involved in this research had no significant effects on the coatings’ UV-absorbing abilities, but draw-bar coating process provided the greatest thickness uniformity. The research results displayed exceptional commercial value because of its value and efficiency <br><br>

CYCLODEXTRIN-BASED NANOPOROUS POLYMERS: A FILTRATION AGENT FOR ORGANIC CONTAMINANTS YEAR 2
Wesley T Hong
Foothill High School, Pleasanton, CA, U.S.A.

The purpose of this experiment was to form and evaluate a polymer to remove organic contaminants for solving modern water pollution problems. This project sought a non-hazardous, water-insoluble polymer that works most effectively in organic contaminant removal. Synthesized from beta-cyclodextrins (beta-CDs), epichlorohydrin, and NaOH, the gel product was thought to be insoluble because combinations with hydroxide are always insoluble without the inclusion of a salt. It was hypothesized that this polymer would be very effective because it creates hydrogen bonds with contaminants and maintains beta-CD’s natural attraction of negatively charged substances.<br><br> The procedure of the experiment is as follows. First, the nanoporous polymer was produced by reacting 5 g beta-CD under basic conditions with 10 mL epichlorohydrin as a cross-linking agent and 1 mL NaOH. 5 g of the filter were then placed in DI water spiked with 5000 PPM of organic contaminants. The sample was agitated and the filter underwent a simple separation process. Finally, the filtered samples were scanned on a Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer for contaminant remaining measurements.<br><br> The results supported the hypothesis as the nanoporous polymer successfully removed the organic contaminants very well. The filtration was found to be significantly effective through statistical analysis, removing 93.2% of the initial contaminants. The polymer proved to have effective contaminant filtrations with varying pH values, although it was considerably better at removing basic contaminants. Its effectiveness and economical applications could rival conventional processes such as activated carbon and accordingly could provide purified water to the great needs in our lives.<br><br>

CESIUM PHASE TRANSITION STUDY

Central Virginia Governor's School / E.C. Glass H. S., Lynchburg, VA, U.S.A.

Cesium chloride capsules are no longer used for food irradiation or the sterilization of medical instruments due to a leak of the material at Decatur, Georgia. The purpose of this study was to examine the suspected cause of the leak: a change in crystal structure (bcc-fcc), which was believed to be controlled by cooling treatment. <br><br>Seven samples were prepared by adding impurities to pure cesium chloride to simulate the beta-minus decay of cesium to barium; the resulting compound was melted at 704°C. Impure samples were separated into two groups, one heated over transition temperature at 510°C while the other was heated under transition temperature at 300°C. A pure sample, as a control, was also added to each group. After heating samples were quenched in various cooling treatments, ranging from 0°C water to a 200°C furnace. Mass and height were recorded following each cycle, observations made and digital pictures taken. <br><br>Following fifteen thermal cycles, samples were examined by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and x-ray diffraction (XRD). SEM images showed that the crystal structure of impure samples heated over transition temperature had changed; however, no evident difference was found between samples cooled differently. Calculated percent changes in height and mass indicated that while samples heated over transition temperature exhibited great change, the sample heated under transition temperature did not. <br><br>It was concluded that cooling treatment had no effect on the change in crystal structure; rather, samples must be heated under transition temperature to prevent the crystal structure change, and thus, expansion. <br><br>

CHARGE TRANSFER OF CHLOROPHYLL-FUNCTIONALIZED GOLD NANOPARTICLES
Ching-Hua Wang
National Taichung Girls' Senior High School

In nature, the leaves of plants are capable of harvesting light energy. The main absorbing pigments are chlorophyll that absorb in the red (Q-band) and the blue (B-band) spectral regions, reflecting in the green. In recent years, scientists have invented new kinds of solar organic cells which use chlorophyll as electric conductivity layer in the cell. To improve the efficiency of the cells, in this project, we attempted to investigate the formation and properties of chlorophyll-functionalized gold nanoparticles due to the surface plasmon optical properties of metal nanoparticles derived from reduced dimensionality and high surface-to-volume ratio. Upon binding of the chlorophyll to the gold nanoparticles, measured by spectrophotometry, we found that the Q-band of chlorophyll was perturbed upon the formation of the gold-chlorophyll colloid. An isobestic point optical absorbent was observed around at 570 nm, at which showed that the Q-band intensity (around at 650 nm) was obviously increased, and the characteristic plasmon intensity of gold nanoparticles was decreased around 520 nm to 530 nm. This suggests that the formation of the gold-chlorophyll colloid took place. Moreover, size-dependent optical properties of gold-chlorophyll colloid was observed, and the efficiency of the charge transition was increasing when the size of gold-particle was larger than 30 nm, but decreasing while the size smaller than 30 nm. We also found that colloidal optical absorption exhibited blue shifts of the Q-band and B-band by 17 nm and 16 nm, respectively, at alkaline condition.

A STUDY INVOLVING THE SYNTHESIS OF CARBON NANOTUBE FILTERS IN THE MACROSCALE WITH MEASURMENTS CONCERNING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF METAL DERIVED CATALYSTS
Jennifer Lee Nagel
Dekalb High School, Waterloo, IN, USA

Since the discovery of carbon nanotubes, researchers have sought to exploit their vast electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties and develop macroscopic applications. With the alignment of nanotubes, possibilities for molecular filtration structures developed using the structural properties of nanotubes. This study was designed to formulate radially aligned carbon nanotube structures with a greater efficiency than conventional ceramic or polymer filters. Additionally, future portions of this experiment will compare the effectiveness of cobalt, iron, and nickel as metal catalysts in derived forms with regard to nanotube purity, strength, and alignment. <br><br> Nanotubes formed using a process known as chemical vapor deposition (CVD). A commercial CVD system was not utilized; instead, the solute solution was nebulized and carried into a tube furnace at 900 C°, employing argon as a carrier gas, at which point the hydrocarbon molecules (benzene) and the derived catalyst particles (ferrocene in initial experiments) decomposed and the floating catalyst particles settled on a mesoporous silica substrate. Once the metal particles on the quartz reached the optimum size for nanotube nucleation, the surrounding carbon formed graphite tubing capped with Buckminsterfullerenes, known as carbon nanotubes. The floating catalyst encourages radial alignment of nanotubes, and in turn, formulation of the macroscopic device. The nanotube deposits were removed from the quartz substrate using a solution of dilute formic acid and examined using SEM and TEM. <br><br> Results demonstrated a direct correlation between the concentration of the catalyst particle and alignment and purity. Additional experiments will ensue in an attempt to strengthen and decontaminate nanotubes.

ANALYSIS OF PROTEIN CONTENT IN POTENTIAL FOOD ALLERGENS
Serge Alexander Shkuro
Grants High School, Grants NM, USA

Allergies are reactions that are triggered by certain proteins. Foods such as cereal grains, fruits, and milk contain proteins known to cause allergies. The purpose of this project is to determine if potential food allergens have similar proteins, responsible for causing allergies. The total protein content of food samples was determined and the protein content within specific food groups compared. The hypothesis is at least one protein will be found in each food, but there will be no similarities in protein content between potential food allergens. <br><br> After extraction and purification of each protein, the samples were separated by thin-layer chromatography to determine the approximate number of compounds present. A spectrophotometric standard protein curve was developed based on the Lowry method for total protein determination. Absorbance values were determined for each sample based on 50microliters of purified protein, diluted with 0.2mL of 0.85% NaCl solution. <br><br> Spectrophotometry results indicate chocolate and cereal grains had the greatest total protein. Electrophoresis standard curve for determining molecular weight was developed by electrophoresis of known proteins and a linear regression of their values. This curve was used to determine the molecular weight of each protein and calculate the approximate number of amino acid residues. Electrophoresis results correlated with some of the spectrophotometry results, concluding that cereal grains, wheat in particular, contain the greatest amount of protein and the heaviest proteins. Gel filtration column chromatography was used to observe the different proteins present in each sample as well as to further purify each protein.

GRASS FOR BIOMASS PHASE 3
Danielle Marie Wilson
West Central Valley High School, Stuart, IA, USA

Biomass is being used to produce energy and the next aspect is the possibility of biomass for ethanol. The purpose of this project was to determine which type of biomass (switch grass, prairie grass, and corn stalks) would produce the greatest ethanol yield from raw material and ensilaged material when considering the yield per acre of each biomass.<br><br>It was hypothesized that the prairie grass silage would have the highest overall ethanol yield and the raw prairie grass would have the greatest ethanol yield for the raw material.<br><br>The grasses were harvested (half were ensilaged), pretreated, and fermented for ethanol production. The grasses were tested in the raw and silage state. The samples were all pretreated in a pressure cooker for 3 hours at 15lbs of pressure. The samples were transferred to the ethanol fermentation process. The samples were fermented for 7 days and then tested for their ethanol content. <br><br>The data collected shows that the prairie grass had the greatest dry yield in grams/sq ft. The prairie grass silage had the highest overall yield in gallons/acre. This was after considering the 30% loss of the raw material due to rotten material that would be found if baled. It was also found that the raw prairie grass had the highest yield in gallons/acre when compared to the others in the raw state. An ANOVA Two-Factor Statistical Analysis also shows that the results were statistically sound between the samples, between the grasses, and between the raw and silage material. <br><br>

APPLICATION OF CYCLOPOLYGON IN CHEMISTRY AND IN COMBINATION OF CHEMISTRY AND MUSIC
Shen Wang
LanzhouNo.1HighSchool Lanzhou,Gansu,China

Two main aspects discussed in this study are both related to cyclopolygon the author has discovered. The first is about the application of cyclopolygon in chemistry. The symmetry of cyclopolygon makes it possible to predict organic structures forming hydrocarbons. This is easier than forming structures spatially, because cyclopolygon is a plane model, which can be formed by simply connecting the given points. The emergence of theoretical structure offers premise and direction for synthesis. The study also used a new method -- the point-delete method to change the cyclopolygon into actual structure. Further research has shown that cyclopolygon can express non-hydrocarbon molecular structure, and put forward the concept of reaction cyclopolygon, which helps realize the digitalization of chemical reactions. <br><br> The second deals with the combination of chemistry and music. It has been found that the symmetrical melodic notes can be used as a new method to compose music. It is possible to combine cyclopolygon and melodic notes as they are both based on symmetry in real applications. Projecting the melodic notes on plane will make the notes become cyclopolygon. The changes in the projection direction produce rhythmic cyclopolygon and melodic cyclopolygon -- cyclopolygons with various musical information. They can be used to generate chemical structures through music. With melodic cyclopolygon, composing music by chemical structures can be realized. <br><br> The article aims to demonstrate that the beauty of natural sciences and humanities lies in symmetry, harmony and regularity, and that all the things in this world are somehow related to each other.<br><br>

EXPERIMENTAL AND COMPUTATIONAL STUDIES ON THE SILICON SURFACE CHEMISTRY OF ALLYL ALCOHOL C3H6O
Breanne M. Fretz
Spanish Springs High School, Sparks, NV United States

Organic synthesis is emerging as a significant player in the development of new semiconductor-based commercial products. The innovative idea of electrical detection sensors potentially allows for more certain flexibility in the detection of problematic substances. These new organic molecule/semiconductor hybrid sensors can, in principle, detect the change in the electrical properties of the molecule versus a fluorescent light detection, where the color of light emitted is correlated with the interacting molecule, by identifying the molecule in an efficient systematic process. A simple molecule is first researched and observed in its bonding to a highly reactive semiconductor. The simple molecule is allyl alcohol, in this research, with only two reacting sites, and the semiconductor used is silicon. Through computational analysis, stable geometries are calculated from the first stable form until the final for in its lowest energy state, developing a theory as to the molecules kinetics and functionality. Experimental analysis will then conclude whether one reaction group is preferred over the other, as allyl alcohol consists of two reacting sites. The Auger Electron Spectroscopy determines how many molecules are present on the surface and their position of spacing on the silicon surface. This gives an accurate picture to the reaction paths and sites taken by the allyl alcohol on the silicon surface. These findings will ultimately depict whether the allyl alcohol molecule is laudable of emerging into an organic molecule/semiconductor hybrid sensor.

THE CONSTRUCTION OF A SELF-ASSEMBLING DNA NANOHEXAGON CAPABLE OF PROTEIN STORAGE AND RELEASE
Shane Evan Mulligan
Staples High School, Westport, CT USA

The miniaturization of materials promises applications in biomedical engineering. In order to apply nanotechnology to biomedicine, a self-assembling, tunable nanostructure is needed that can act as a drug-delivery device whose stability can be insured in varying environments.<br><br> DNA’s complementary nature and ease of synthesis was harnessed in this experiment to self-assemble into a prototypical nanostorage motif. The goal of this experiment was to design and create self-assembling DNA nanohexagons to act as a structural motif in nanotechnology.<br><br> Such a nanohexagon was successfully created by modifications to a previously constructed DNA triangular motif. The modifications to the triangles cause the formation of a hexagonal macrostructure consisting of six equilateral triangles, which are each joined at a 120º angle by binding to one another at two vertices of each triangle. This system was used as individual triangles have been produced in high yield and are rigid in structure through torsionally linked helices. This assembly boasts much more control than linear self-assembling systems, as length, structure, and shape can be controlled. <br><br> This nanohexagon was successfully produced using an anneal process that exploits the hybridization temperatures of varying length strands to force triangle and nanohexagon formation. Proof of the construction of these nanohexagons was confirmed through atomic force microscopy.<br><br> The nanohexagon structure was successfully created with the desired hollow, central cavity of an approximate 40-nanometer width. The future goal of this project is to enhance the nanohexagons functionality by making its central cavity capable of protein storage, enabling applications such as smart-medicine production.

CRYSTALS: EFFECT OF VARYING PH IN THE CRYSTALLIZATION OF LYSOZYME
Rachel Suzanne Hopkins
Ridgeview High School, Orange Park, Florida, United States

The purpose of my project is to answer the question; “Does varying pH have an effect on the crystallization of lysozyme?” I hypothesized that a pH level of 4.6 would produce the best crystal growth. I tested my theory by setting up an experiment using two phases. In Phase One I tested which sodium chloride concentration produced the best crystals. I mixed a buffer solution with a pH balance of 4.67 and tested sodium chloride concentrations of .25, .30, .35, .40, .45, .50, .55, and .60. Each trial in Phase One lasted seven days. I repeated Phase One an additional three times for a total of 4 trials to compare results. My results showed that the best crystals were produced in a sodium chloride concentration of .50. In Phase Two I tested the effect of varying pH in the crystallization of lysozyme. I used a sodium chloride concentration of .50, and used vinegar to vary the pH level of the buffer solution to 3.8, 4.2, 4.6, 5.0 and 5.4. I recorded information on crystal growth for 7 days. I looked for the number of crystals produced, the size of the crystals, the number of crystals that had twinning, and the number of crystals that had fractures. I ran three trials in Phase Two to compare results. My results showed that my hypothesis was supported in that a pH balance of 4.6 produced the best quality lysozyme crystals.

PREPARATION OF HOLLOW SPHERES OF TIO2 NANOCRYSTALS AS HIGHLY EFFICIENT PHOTOCATALYST AND ITS APPLICATIONS
Qizhe Shao

Under the light (wavelength less than 385nm) irradiation,TiO2 photocatalyst transforms organic pollutants into inorganic substances.With this principal,TiO2 can be directly applied to waste water treatment, photocatalysis,self-cleaning smart materials,dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells,anti-biotic materials and so on.The purpose of this project is to develop a novel photocatalyst which is highly efficient and can be recycled and reused easily.<br><br> My solution centered on modifying the structure of nanoparticles.I innovated a novel route for the preparation of TiO2 photocatalyst with hollow structure.The monodispersed SiO2 spheres were used as seeds to prepare TiO2-coated SiO2 nanocomposite with TBOT or titanium sulfate as titanium source.The core-shell structured powder were separated from solution,dried,and then calcined to crystallize the amorphous TiO2. Then,TiO2-coated SiO2 nanocomposite was subjected to base washing with 5-10 M NaOH to selectively dissolve the SiO2 within the powder.The hollow spheres of TiO2 nanocrystals were obtained after selectively dissolving.The TiO2-coated SiO2 nanocomposite as well as the resulting the hollow spheres were characterized by XRD,TEM,and N2-sorption analysis.It is found that the hollow spheres consist of anatase TiO2 nanocrystals in the size of 10 to 20 nm,depending on the increase of the calcining temperature from 450 to 600 centigrade. <br><br> The hollow spheres possesses some advantages such as good floating ability,high specific surface area,and easily recyclable ability.The photocatalytic activity of the hollow spheres of TiO2 was tested using the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue as a model reaction.Hollow spheres showed the highly efficient photocatalytic activity in comparison with TiO2 normal nanocrystals.<br><br>

FUEL CELL PRACTICALITY
Wade Edward Miller
Alden-Conger, Alden MN, U.S.A

When I started with this project I had several ideas for what I was going to experiment with and there was really only one that seemed to be rather useful to me, that was to see how well a fuel cell would work under varying temperatures. This lead to the first task at hand, which was to figure out exactly how I was going to get varying temperatures. I decided that I could run it at room temperature once, take it outside adn run it, run it the school's walk in freezer, and use heat lamps to heat up a small area.<br><br>Then I proceded to run the fuel cell at the above enumerated areas. My results were as follows: .9 volts at -10 degress F, .75 volts at 27 degrees F, .8 volts at 64 degrees F, and .9-.7 volts at 80 degrees F(fluctuated between the two). After I got all this data graphed out using Excel, and compared my results to see where I may have went wrong, I concluded that a fuel cell would work in a region with varying temperatures, there would only be one problem; the water slowly loses its temperature and would eventually freeze, which would cause problems with the catalyst membrane inside the fuel cell.

STUDY OF ELECTROLYTE-CATHODE COMPATIBILITY IN A NEW SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELL
Megan Elizabeth Burger
Academy of Science and Technology, Conroe, Texas, U.S.A.

Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) have tremendous potential as clean energy sources, but their current costs and high operating temperatures limit widespread applications. A new solid oxide electrolyte was synthesized which had higher conductivity and lower operating temperature than today’s most common SOFC electrolyte. <br><br> The purpose of this research was to: 1) Produce epitaxial thin films of the new electrolyte to improve ionic conductivity and reduce space requirements, and 2) Synthesize a cathode material with high electronic conductivity and compatibility with the electrolyte.<br><br> Electrolyte thin films (0.8µm thick) were created using pulsed laser deposition on silicon substrates. These films were homogeneous, pure, and semi-epitaxial. Films produced under high-temperature deposition retained rhombohedral crystal structure and high oxygen anion conductivity. <br><br> Perovskite and pyrochlore materials were investigated for potential use in an SOFC cathode. The pyrochlore demonstrated greater homogeneity, significantly higher electronic conductivity, and high-temperature compatibility with the solid oxide electrolyte. A new mixed ionic/electronic conducting (MIEC) cathode was also synthesized by combining the pyrochlore and electrolyte at high temperature. The resulting material was characterized by electron microprobe analysis. <br><br> Currently, aqueous solutions containing the cations required for both electrolyte and cathode phases are being combined in an organic amine to form a “nanogel” (gel expected to promote nanocrystalline nucleation). This substance will be heated to produce rapid crystal growth, and is expected to form a high quality MIEC cathode. Production of improved MIEC cathodes will increase the cost efficiency of SOFCs, devices which may someday revolutionize transportation and large-scale power generation.

FUNDAMENTAL PROPERITES OF O2(-)
Charles Henry Herder
The Kinkaid School, Houston, Texas, USA

Understanding fundamental properties of molecules' interactions with electrons is crucial to predicting and modeling how these entities interact in the atmosphere. A means by which to study these properties is to measure the temperature dependence of oxygen with thermal electrons in the pulsed discharge electron capture detector. Oxygen, air, xenon, krypton, and molecular hydrogen were used individually as dopants and third bodies to obtain new fundamental properties of the anion of molecular oxygen. Experimental values that confirm multiple bound electron affinities ranging from 0.25 to 1.07 eV are observed. Semi-empirical self-consistent field multi-configuration configuration interaction (SCF-MCCI) calculations are then used to support all of these electron affinity values.

REMEDIATION OF TRICHLOROETHYLENE CONTAMINANTS VIA FENTON'S REAGENT
Nicole Eglin Pappano
Dominion High School, Sterling, VA, USA

Trichloroethylene (TCE) is a highly volatile and harmful industrial waste product that pollutes water and soil. The contamination of these substances causes numerous health problems in humans and the deaths of many aquatic and terrestrial organisms. The purpose of this research was to determine whether Fenton's reagent would effectively breakdown TCE into non-hazardous products.<br><br> In the first phase of experimentation, Fenton's reagent, (a combination of hydrogen peroxide and ferrous or ferric iron) was added to TCE. The breakdown of TCE was monitored by measuring carbon dioxide production. During the second phase of experimentation, TCE was added to soil to simulate the contamination of soil in situ. The contaminated soil was treated with Fenton's reagent and production of carbon dioxide was monitored with a carbon dioxide sensor.<br><br> Statistical analysis via a t-test determined that there was a significant difference between the breakdown of TCE in the trials of both phases verses the breakdown of TCE during both controls. Consequently, the null hypothesis, that Fenton's reagent would have no effect on the breakdown of TCE, was refuted. Further research would involve testing different types of soil (i.e. clay, silt, sand) to determine if differences in organic matter in the soil would effect the remediation. Hence, the use of Fenton's reagent as a treatment method merits further exploration.<br><br>

DIESEL FUEL FROM VEGETABLE OIL
Nicholas Charles Bruno
Leonardtown High School, Leonardtown Maryland, United States

Through transesterification, esters were synthesized from vegetable oils, corn, soy, and coconut, through reaction with methanol and a catalyst (sulfuric acid). The heats of combustion were then analyzed by the use of a bomb calorimeter, and high-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to determine the percent conversion to methyl ester. By comparing the two sets of results, a direct correlation is seen between percent conversion to the methyl ester and heats of combustion. The corn and soy oils only converted to roughly 50% whereas coconut oil reacted completely to methyl esters. This led to the corn and soy fuels having a much lower heat of combustion than anticipated but coconut fuel was close to matching literature values for the pure methyl ester. Though only about half comprised of esters, the heats of combustion of the soy and corn were close to that of coconut.

Partially oxidized inorganic polymers of tetra(cyano)platinate(II), K Pt(CN) Br 2H O and bis(oxalato)platinate(II), K [Pt(C O ) ] 2H O were prepared by chemical and electrochemical methods. The effects of pyrolysis time and temperature on the nanowires and their composition was examined by SEM, TEM, EDS, TGA and microanalysis. The macroscopic structure of the tetra(cyano)platinate (II) complexes was retained after pyrolysis at of 700 C at which temperature the polymers were converted into structures comprised mostly of platinum metal. SEM analysis showed that the platinum metal nanowires had a porous 3-dimensional structure with monodisperse pore density. Pyrolysis of the bis(oxalato)platinate(II) nanowires resulted in an amorphous material in which the majority of the nanowire structure was not retained.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br> Formulas have hand-written sub-scripts in actual abstract.

CAN THE STOICHIOMETRIC POINT OF A NEUTRALIZATION TITRATION BE DETERMINED USING CONDUCTIVITY OF THE SOLUTION?
Amanda Margaret Strickland
Charlottesville High School, Charlottesville Virginia, US

Titration is a method of volumetric analysis that is often used to determine the concentration of one of the reactants involved. The stoichiometric point of a titration (also known as the equivalence point) is the point at which exactly enough titrant has been added to completely react with the analyte. One type of reaction that titration can be used for is a reaction between an acid and a base. When the acid and base are present in stoichiometric proportions they are neutralized. Generally an indicator is added to the titrant which changes color at a pH as close as possible to the stoichiometric point of the titration. This indicates that the products and reactants are present in the correct proportions to determine concentration. <br><br> In this experiment the electrical conductivity of the solution was measured to determine if that, instead of an indicator, could be used to find the stoichiometric point. Phenolphthalein was added to give an independent indication of the stoichiometric point. Three different combinations of reactants were used to evaluate the possible effectiveness of this method on acids and bases of varying strength. These combinations were hydrochloric acid with sodium hydroxide, phosphoric acid with calcium hydroxide, and acetic acid with sodium hydroxide. <br><br> Graphing conductance versus amount of titrant added for each combination resulted in various shapes of curves. However, on each of the graphs there was a distinct change in slope which corresponded with the stoichiometric point indicated by the phenolphthalein.

THE EFFECTS OF CORROSION ON TYPE ONE SUPERCONDUCTORS
Samantha Kay Lawrence
Christian Heritage High School, Riverdale, UT

The purpose of this experiment is to test the effects of corrosion on the Type One Superconductors, niobium and titanium. The initial design measured the magnetic flux and resistance on metal bars; however, final design utilized these materials fabricated into tubular electromagnets.<br><br> An ohmmeter and test leads attached directly to the superconductors measured the electrical resistivity. Using a power supply, 10 amps of current were induced to the electromagnets using 12 gauge copper wire, wrapped around the superconductors, and magnetic flux was measured internally utilizing a guassmeter. Electromagnets were super-cooled with liquid nitrogen. Gauss readings were taken at specific points from room temperature to -190 degrees Celsius.<br><br> The metals were then corroded in two impressed current cathodic protection cells, with one amp induced for three weeks. Titanium was anodic to stainless steel in an electrolyte of saltwater. Niobium was cathodic to nickel in an electrolyte of sodium hydroxide. <br><br> Finally, the metals were retested for electrical resistivity and magnetic flux in the exact manner as the first, un-corroded test. Resistance for both superconductors increased about .001 ohm at room temperature. Magnetic field production was reduced an average of 8.3 gauss for titanium and 11.7 gauss for niobium (about 30%) over the entire temperature range.<br><br> The results of this of this experiment show the importance of inhibiting corrosion in applications where superconductors are used.<br><br>

FATAL UN ATTRRACTION HYDROGEN AND MAGNESTISM
Amanda Marie Graham
Belton Honea Path High School, Honea Path SC, USA

Electrolysis is costly. If fuel cells become the main power source of cars, then more efficient hydrogen production will be needed. So, what is the effect of magnetism on electrolysis? Water is bipolar, so introducing a bipolar magnet into electrolysis will stress the bonds and increase the hydrogen production. Constants are time of experiments, voltage, electrode size, water amount and temperature. The only variable is magnetism. The dependant variable is water displacement by hydrogen production. Materials used were a hydrogen generator, water and a large bipolar magnet. Experiments ran three hours with a magnet, then three hours without, stopping in the middle to record data and refill water. Magnetism did effect hydrogen production. The average improvement was 15.52%. Eighty percent of tests showed positive improvement while twenty percent were affected negatively. If negative runs were not included in the average, then improvement was 25.09%. The hypothesis was confirmed in that a magnet did improve hydrogen production during electrolysis. It is possible that clamps did not have full contact with electrodes in those twenty percent of test runs. Pencil electrodes were changed during the 6th run when one pencil split. Results after the replacement increased dramatically. Better control of pencil electrodes may play a role in the results. The conclusion is still the same in that a magnet improved the speed at which hydrogen was produced. This could be an important factor in the future of fuel cells as many scientists are looking to reduce cost of alternative fuels.

ANALYZING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SUN SCREENS USING SILVER NITRATE AND SPECTROPHOTOMETRY
Jessica Carter
Roy Junior High School, Roy Utah, United States

The SPF Factor is different for each individual person, making it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of various sun screens. It was hypothesized that sun screens that contain cinnamates, benzophenones, and anthranilates would be the most effective in absorbing UV-A and UV-B rays. This was shown by using silver nitrate and a spectrophotometer.<br><br> Silver nitrate was used to imitate the melanin in a person’s skin. However, when the sun screens were spread directly on the silver nitrate there was a chemical reaction which caused a change in color; this was because just like sun screen is not directly spread onto melanin, the sun screens could not be directly spread onto the silver nitrate. To remedy this, a piece of glass was used to represent a person’s skin. This experiment was completed and Banana Boat was found to be the most effective in blocking the UV-B rays.<br><br> To accurately measure the effectiveness of the sun screens, a spectrophotometer was used. The sun screens were spread on microscope slides and the spectrophotometer was used to measure the sun that came through the sun screens. It was determined that Paradise Gold was the most effective in blocking the UV-A and UV-B rays.<br><br> Neutrogena was second in blocking both types of UV rays. With further investigation, it was discovered that Paradise Gold and Neutrogena have the same ingredients, but in different amounts. No other sun screens have as many, or the same cinnamates or benzophenones as these two sun screens.

REVERSIBLE MEMBRANE CELL: PHASE 3
Lacey Lloyd
Ogden High School, Ogden, UT, USA

In the last two years, the hydroquinone quinone reaction was run forward and reverse in an electrochemical cell with a proton-exchange membrane. Although the cell was functional, some improvements needed to be made. This year’s main objective was to improve the membrane. Sulfonated polystyrene/divinylbenzene membranes were created by polymerizing a lithium styrene sulfonate solution on both polypropylene filter cloth and glass fiber filter paper. The latter proved to leak substantially less than the former, so a thimble-shaped membrane was created using the glass filter paper as supporting fabric. A mold was assembled for casting the membranes. The exact pattern of a tapered glass jar was calculated to make cardstock spacers the same width as the membrane fabric. A fiberglass resin plug was then cast inside the spacers to be used as the inner mold surface for the membrane. The supporting fabric, wrapped around the plug, was fused together at the seams with a gas/oxygen torch and placed in the mold. The membrane solution penetrated the fabric and was polymerized in an oven for one hour. The membrane was inserted into a beaker where it separated the inner and outer solutions and was used as a cell. The hydroquinone quinone reaction was run using a D.C. power supply at constant current. The membranes conducted, and the reactions were followed by UV spectroscopy. No significant leakage was observed over the reaction time in Cell 1B.<br><br>

BIOSORPTION OF ZINC IN CONTAMINATED SOIL FROM ZAMBALES BASE METAL MINE ZAMBOANGA CITY, BY PHOSPHATIZED BAT GUANO
Mohammad Al-Mahdi Tan Kho
Arturo Eustaquio Memorial Science High School, Zamboanga City, Philippines

Mining and processing of zinc (Zn) is a major contributor to environmental degradation of soil resources. Adverse environmental impacts from exposure to zinc from contaminated mining sites include risks to human health, contamination of soil, and soil erosion. Contaminated soil often presents an unacceptable risk to human and ecological health.<br><br>The purpose of this study is to look into the possibility of using phosphatized bat guano as an effective and economical method of biosorption of zinc in contaminated soil at room temperature.<br><br>Experiments for biosorption were performed in 9 separate 250 mL beakers using 200g each of dried soil and 100g each of cleaned phosphatized bat guano. There were 3 set-ups each for the experiment performed for 7, 14, and 21 days. Each set-up consists of three layers. For the first layer, 100g soil sample was placed followed by 100g of phosphatized bat guano, and finally, another 100g soil sample was placed over. After each timeframe, phosphatized bat guano samples from each set-up were set aside and soil samples were thoroughly mixed. From this, three soil samples, 1g each, were randomly collected for the analysis of zinc. <br><br>Analysis of the experiment showed a significant biosorption of zinc, and the sample gradually containing the said heavy metal. The mean percentages of zinc biosorped are; 64.82%, 69.00%, and 77.13% for the first, second, and third week respectively and the mean percentage is 70.32%. This shows that there is greater biosorption of zinc at a longer time of exposure of the phosphatized bat guano.<br><br>

PH-TRIGGERED ASSEMBLY OF GOLD NANORODS
Patrick Leon Hankins
Irmo High School, Columbia, South Carolina, USA

This project was a study on the development of a novel method for assembling surface-charged gold nanorods into ordered structures. After synthesis, the colloidal rods are covered in a surfactant that gives the rods a positive net charge that prevents assemblage in aqueous solution through repulsion. Attempts were made to manipulate the rods through interactions with various difunctional molecules. Eventually, adipic acid was chosen to aggregate the rods through electrostatic interactions and hexamethylendiamine through amine-metal coordinating bonds.<br><br> In high pH conditions, the negatively charged, deprotonated adipic acid molecules effectively act as electrostatic linkers and assemble the positive nanorods, but in low pH conditions the neutral adipic acid molecules do not show this attraction and little assemblage is observable. Though results are too varied to make a definitive conclusion, in high pH conditions deprotonated hexamethylendiamine molecules should form a coordinate bond with the lone pair of electrons on each terminal amine group. Control experiments were performed with simple salts and pH-adjusted solutions. TEM micrographs indicate that the aggregation into ordered structures with adipic acid proceeds in solution around pH 7-8 but not at pH 3. Zeta potential measurements show that rods treated with high pH adipic acid have a much less positive effective surface charge. UV/VIS spectrophotometric analysis shows a shift in the absorption spectra of the high pH adipic acid treated rods which indicates aggregation. Applications of this study include nanoelectronic circuitry, exploitation of special photonic properties, catalysis, and as biological and chemical sensors.

FABRIC FLAMMABILITY
Kathryn Marie Clark
Memorial High School Victoria, Texas United States

<br><br> The purpose of this experiment was to determine the affects of laundering on the flammability of different fabrics. This experiment demonstrated how dangerous peoples' choices of clothing can be when their clothing is subjected to heat or open flame. Pieces of selected fabrics were cut to size and sorted into groups by laundering instructions. The fabric groups were laundered per the specific laundering instructions for each group. After a predetermined number of laundering cycles, samples were taken of each fabric and indexed using a color code system and marked trial one. Two more trials, each with a predetermined number of laundering cycles, were completed, sampled and color coded. After all laundered samples were collected, the samples were burned to observe the burning characteristics of each fabric. Based on the data and observations collected, it was concluded that the laundering had no affect on the flammability of cotton, linen, wool, polyester, flame-retardant polyester, nylon and silk laundered without fabric softener. However, it did have an affect on all trials of rayon/linen and silk laundered with fabric softener. It appears that the most flame retardant fabric was wool and the least flame retardant was nylon. This experiment would be more accurate if the fabrics could have held up under more laundering cycles and the possible errors and problems noted in the conclusion could be resolved.

THE USE OF SACRIFICE METALS COMBINED TO GATE PAINTING AGAINST CORROSION
Marina de Mattos Lourenco
Colegio Koelle, Rio Claro, Sao Paulo, Brazil

The goal of this work is to use sacrifice metals and paint, to minimize corrosion in iron gates. Sacrifice Metals are the ones that have the oxidation function in the place of another one, protecting other metals, such as iron, from corrosion. <br><br> I demonstrated this idea by making an experiment with iron nails, that simulates residential gates, connected with small metal plates more electropositive than iron, such as magnesium, aluminum, zinc and graphite. The nails and plates, were placed inside of plastic and transparent containers, subjected to different conditions, and the results were compared. <br><br> The nails were placed in the following containers: with water, without water, without plate. Steel straws replaced nails in the experiments and they were more affected by the corrosion.<br><br>The research brought the following results: Nails that were placed in dry surroundings apparently had not suffered from corrosion, while all nails left in humid environment suffered corrosion. Water in humid containers was dark, showing great release of ferric oxide, except in the one with magnesium, where the solution was clearer, with small oxide dissolution. There weren’t significant differences of corrosion between nails in humid environments with the ones combined with graphite, only the ones with magnesium, were less affected by corrosion.<br><br> Compared to other metals, magnesium connected to iron is very efficient to protect from corrosion. Humidity is a significant factor in the rust formation speed and aluminum is not as effective as expected. Therefore, magnesium combined with painting, helps in the conservation of materials against rust.<br><br>

WELL WATER: DOES IT CONTAIN ARSENIC AND LEAD?
Jennifer Lynn Longtree, Jennifer Longtree
Turtle Mountain Community High School, Belcourt, ND 58316

The purpose of my project would be see if I could find high levels of lead and arsenic concentrations in the reservation water supply. The reason I chose these metals is they are not things that people normally look for in their water.<br><br> The EPA regulates the testing of water supplies for all cities in the United States. They set the limits of many contaminants and make sure that water is tested on a regular basis.<br><br> The EPA set the limits of arsenic originally at 50 ppb but later dropped it to 10 ppb. The lead standard is 15 ppb.<br><br> For my project I have collected 50 samples of drinking water from staff and students at Turtle Mountain Community High School. My hopes were to get samples from all over the reservation and surrounding area. I than took the samples to an outside laboratory so that I could run them through their graphite furnace atomic absorption unit. This unit is very sensitive and can detect even small amounts of arsenic and lead in drinking water.<br><br> For my results, I found that all the water samples but one contained small amounts of arsenic, except one sample. Three of samples were over 10, only one being considered over the 15 ppb standard. All the samples contain small amounts of lead, with one sample approaching the legal limit.<br><br>

SYNTHESIS AND MAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF METAL FLUORIDE COMPLEXES
Daniel Jonathan Smaltz
Wachusett Regional High School, Holden, MA, USA

This study was conducted to synthesize a novel transition metal complex and to determine its magnetic properties. A complex containing the copper(II) ion was of interest because of its single unpaired electron, which makes the ion a magnetic dipole. Specifically, the synthesis of a compound containing copper(II), fluoride, and pyrazine was desired.<br><br>Pyrazine was dissolved in an aqueous solution of copper(II) nitrate trihydrate to allow the pyrazine molecules to coordinate to the copper(II) ions in solution. Sodium fluoride was added to this solution, which resulted in the rapid precipitation of a solid due to the reaction of fluoride ions with the copper(II)-pyrazine complex. Infrared spectroscopy was used as a primary line of evidence to determine the identity of the compound. A SQUID magnetometer was used to measure this compound’s magnetic moment as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field. In addition, this copper complex was analyzed using an X-ray powder diffractometer.<br><br>The infrared spectrum of this copper compound indicated that it did in fact contain pyrazine as well as some amount of water of hydration. X-ray diffraction data suggested that the material was crystalline. Magnetically, this compound underwent a field-induced phase transition at a critical field of approximately 550 Oe, and this appeared to be due to a spin flop. Analysis of the temperature dependence of its magnetic moment suggested that it was a canted antiferromagnet. The magnetic interactions of this compound were three-dimensional.<br><br>

DIMETHICONE PAINT
Melanie Rose Clemenz
Dutch Fork High School, Irmo, South Carolina, United States of America

Artists rely on oil paint as a versatile medium with which to paint. The only problem with this is oil contains chemicals, which are hazardous to the artist's health, and the replacement acrylic is not as easy to work with. This is why it is necessary to find a new substitute for oil paint. By replacing the hazardous components of oil paint (ethylene or urethane) with the silicone dimethicone, a cost-effective replacement for the binders in oil paint will be achieved, while still retaining the quality of oil paint. The hypothesis will be tested through experiments measuring color, opacity, and drying time; then comparing the measurements made with the dimethicone paint samples to those of oil and acrylic samples. Dimethicone mixed with the same pigment as oil and acrylic paint has shown to have the same color. The drying time of dimethicone paint is not as long as that of oil paint, yet at the same time longer than that of acrylic paint. Also, general fluidity of painting with dimethicone has been satisfactory in comparison to painting with oil paint. The experiments have shown dimethicone to be an appropriate alternative to oil paint thus far.

WATER QUALITY OF MCGAFFEY WATER SHED THAT LEADS TO THE RIO PUERCO
Primrose McCray
Wingate High School, Ft. Wingate, New Mexico, United States

Abstract<br><br> The water quality of the McGaffey watershed (part of the Rio Puerco drainage) was tested at various locations for dissolved oxygen in ppm. The sites included McGaffey watershed, the Rio Puerco, and the Ft. Wingate High School pond. The water tested from the sites was recorded for temperature (in Celsius and Fahrenheit), pH, EC, and turbidity. The testing was performed on location. Then samples were obtained, and another set of dissolved oxygen procedures were applied. The procedures involved different types of solutions, like Maganeous Sulfate and Alkaline Potassium Iodide Acide, which precipitated into the water. Next, 1.0g of Sulfamic Acid Powder was added, that turned the water to a yellowish color. When the Starch Indicator turned the sample blue, 20ml. of the sample were poured into the titration tube, and more drops of Sodium Thiosulfate turned the sample clear. The point where the samples turned clear indicated the amount of Dissolved Oxygen present. Then the final results of all tests were compared by the ppm. The final results showed that the McGaffey watershed has a low amount of Dissolved Oxygen; it is not supplied with enough oxygen for fish and there is a possibility of pollution in the water. The Wingate High School pond has the highest amount of Dissolved Oxygen; that is good, but there is a high amount of Dissolved Oxygen for aquatic plants. The Rio Puerco, however, has the right amount of Dissolved Oxygen, although it was polluted by the sewer. The different elevations of the sites were also recorded. <br><br>

CYANIDE DETECTION USING A MYOGLOBIN BIOSENSOR
Daniel James Cromer
Cherry Creek High School, Greenwood Village, Colorado, USA

The need for a practical, precise, and useful cyanide detection method was fulfilled with the synthesis of a myoglobin based biosensor. Cyanide interacts with the oxygen-binding site of the protein myoglobin forming a strong complex bond. Using a myoglobin solution in phosphate buffered saline, the concentration of cyanide in solution was measured using a spectrophotometer to detect absorption at the optimal wavelength of 423 nm, which is proportional to the amount of cyanide-myoglobin binding. Temperature, pH of solution, and concentration of chemical species are major factors affecting the range of applicability of the technique. The principal focus of this project was to balance these variables in order to create an effective biosensor useful in the range of greatest interest from a toxicological perspective. For reasons related to typical testing conditions (biological as well as industrial), the sensor was optimized at pH 7.2. The biosensor successfully detected micromolar concentrations of cyanide, well below the published OSHA standards. Current efforts are aimed at encapsulating the reagents in a semi-permeable polyacrylamide shell in order to simplify field testing. These efforts have yielded convenience as well as increased shelf life. This practical, portable, cost-effective method of cyanide detection has applications in many areas, ranging from the detection of preservatives in museum specimens to the testing of runoff from mine wastes.

INTERFACIAL PHENOMENA IN –(NI-FE-CU)- GIANT MAGNETORESISTANCE SYSTEMS
Dylan Reed Conradson
Los Alamos High School, Los Alamos, New Mexico, USA

The Giant Magnetoresistance (GMR)-based sensors in ultra-high density disk drives utilize the differential resistance experienced by spin-up and spin-down electrons traversing ferromagnetic domains separated by a paramagnetic metal and are one of the first commercial applications of nanotechnology. Theories of GMR are primarily phenomenological, depending simply upon interactions between bulk magnetic domains. These devices, however, are built of discrete atoms so that the interfaces must be active both structurally/elastically and electronically/magnetically for continuity of the atoms and electronic states across them. In fact, for Fe films on Cu (and other substrates), complicated magneto-structural behavior results in three distinct phases with varying Fe thickness whose origin is very controversial. I have therefore analyzed Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure spectra to probe the local structure around the Fe atoms in a series of –(Ni-Fe-Cu)- multilayers with Fe thickness of 4–20 Å. I found a high degree of order with the exception of a significantly elongated Fe-Fe distance in the fct phase that defines the interlayer bond length. These parameters give the three dimensional arrangement of atoms in the Fe layers that I subsequently used in constructing a structural model that served as a basis calculating local density of states (LDOS). The position- and structure-dependent LDOS show that interfacial effects on the electronic structure and associated perturbation of the magnetic domains in the Fe can be the factor stabilizing the ferromagnetic fct phase, contradicting the existing models based on bulk and surface probes that point to partial transformations to the bcc structure.

REDUCTION OF CELLULOSIC FIBER FLAMMABILITY USING ALUMINOSILICATES
Katie Marie Herbage
Gold Beach High School, Gold Beach, Oregon, USA

Clothing fires can cause burn injury and death. The way a fabric burns depends on its weave, texture, and fiber content. Natural (cotton, linen) and manufactured (acetate, rayon) cellulosic fibers can burn more quickly than synthetic fibers (acrylic, polyester, nylon, spandex). Fibers with 93% cellulose and 7% montmorillonite clay nanoparticles have been shown to have greater heat tolerance than untreated cotton. The purpose of this project was to test the flammability of natural and manufactured cellulosic fibers when treated with aluminosilicate nanoparticles of montmorillonite clay or zeolite. <br><br> Montmorillonite clay and zeolite nanoparticles were prepared by making a slurry and isolating nanoparticles by flotation. The zeolite slurry was ground in a blender prior to isolating nanoparticles. Flammability tests (burn time, burn distance, % weight loss) were done on cotton fibers and cotton muslin treated with zeolite and montmorillonite particles. Results showed zeolite and bentonite reduce cotton flammability significantly and there is no significant difference in performance between the two. In the next phase of the project, cotton cellulose was dissolved and zeolite and montmorillonite nanoparticles added before flammability testing of this manufactured fiber. <br><br>

ELECTROLYSIS: PRODUCTION AND COMPOSITION
Wesley Norman Fassmann
East High School, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States of America

Water Electrolysis, the dissociation of hydrogen and oxygen atoms from water, requires electrolytes to be present in the water, increasing the water's conductivity. Electrolytes dramatically alter the ratio of hydrogen and oxygen production as well as the amount of energy consumed for the production of hydrogen and oxygen.<br><br> Throughout my experiments, I focused on the production of oxygen. To increase my understanding of the production of oxygen, I created a home made Hoffman apparatus and conducted several experiments using different electrolytes: sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium sulfate, and sodium chloride. <br><br> The production rates of oxygen and hydrogen were altered due to differing chemical reactions from each electrolyte. The reactions which took place at the cathode remained the same, while the reactions at the anode differed. The sodium chloride produced chlorine gas in addition to the oxygen at the anode. The sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate produced a weak unstable acid which broke up into carbon dioxide and water. The side reaction of sodium sulfate interfered the least in the production of oxygen. The reduction potential and chemical formulas became a very useful tool in substantiating the outcomes. <br><br> My results show that the extra reactions created from the electrolytes which take place at the cathode and anode have a direct affect on the hydrogen and oxygen production. Sodium sulfate produced the most accurate dissociation of the water because it had the weakest side reactions. <br><br>

MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF ISOBORNYL METHACRYLATE MODIFIED LIQUID CRYSTAL BLENDS

The potential candidate liquid crystal (LC) monomer greatly lowers shrinkage upon polymerization to 1/4 of current products. Previous studies showed admixed Isobornyl methacrylate (IBM) increases LC¡¯s inadequate strength and modulus without drastically increasing its shrinkage. This present research is set to study the pattern of IBM additive¡¯s usage to the LC monomer¡¯s mechanical properties and shrinkage in order to select the optimal amount of IBM additive. Furthermore, the selected superior monomer will be evaluated and compared with other current commercial monomers in a filled system. Zero, 10, 20 and 30 weight percent mixtures of IBM with 1, 4(di-4-(methacryloxyhexyloxy)benzoyloxy) 2-t-butylbenzene were prepared and initiated with 3% 1:4 camphorquinone:DMEMA. Shrinkages were determined with an Acuvol video dilatometer (Bisco); transverse strengths and moduli determined with an MTS-Instron universal testing machine. The best monomer system was selected for formulation into a 75% barium glass (Schott Glass USA) (1 μm, 3.2 % silane) filled composite resin (C1). Two comparison composites were similarly made using a 3:3:2 bis-GMA:bis-EMA:TEGDMA monomer identically photoinitiated (C2) and Coltene (C3). The result data was analyzed using ANOVA and S-N-K: 20% IBM yielded the best increase in mechanical properties with shrinkage not significantly different than 10%. Low shrinkage and high strength were highly significant (p < 0.0001) and significant (p = 0.0004) for the experimental composite compared to the conventional control. In the filled system, the 20% IBM LC blend appears to be surprisingly satisfactory, offering significantly low volumetric shrinkage (vol. 2%) and greatly comparable mechanical properties. <br><br>Supported by NIH-NIDCR P01DE11688

WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF SALT IN ELECTROLYSIS?
Hunter Hays Shaffer
Cheng Du International School, Chengdu Si Chuan, China

The purpose of the experiment was to find out which solution is the most conductive (drinking water, drinking water with one teaspoon of salt, drinking water with ½ table spoon of salt, and drinking water with 1 tablespoon of salt). This was tested by way of electrolysis. Electrolysis is chemical change, especially decomposition that is produced in an electrolyte by an electric current. This project was chosen to see first–hand the process of molecules breaking apart. This project might be of interest to the scuba-diving industry. If saltwater is a conductive solution, then by use of electrolysis there could be a small devise that could make oxygen which could allow extended time underwater.<br><br> The hypothesis is that water with 1 teaspoon of salt will be the most conductive solution. The second most conductive solution will be the solution with ½ tablespoon of salt. Drinking water will be third most conductive solution and the solution with 1 tablespoon of salt will be the least conductive.<br><br> The rate of decomposition of water was measured by electrolysis. Using this, the effect of added ions was determined. The voltage used was 9 volts from a DC power supply. The tests were done on the rate of decomposition of 100mLs of water verses time. The effect of sodium, potassium, chlorine, and iodine on the electrolysis process was determined.<br><br> The solution that decomposed the fastest was the solution with 1 tablespoon of salt. The solution with ½ tablespoon of salt was the second fastest decomposing solution. The third quickest decomposing solution is the solution with 1 teaspoon of salt. The slowest decomposing solution was the drinking water.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF REDUCTION CHAMBER VOLUME DURING SYNTHESIS ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF 3-AMINOPHTHALHYDRAZIDE'S CHMILUMINESCENT REACTION.
Ethan Alonzo Williams
Chengdu International school, Chengdu, Sichuan, China (PRC)

The purpose of this project was to observe how volume reduction of a chamber affects the chemiluminescent reaction of Luminal. I chose this project because I was interested in the development of technologies related to the crime industry. Changing the volume of the reduction chamber does effect the chemiluminescent properties of 3-aminopthalhydrazide.<br><br>I had to create the luminal from scratch if I was to observe suitably for any changes in the chemiluminescent reaction. I extracted more luminal from the Buckner funnel filter than was extracted from the smaller chamber Buckner funnel filter. I created two portions of Luminal with two different sized chambers. Afterwards I mixed them separately into 150mL beaker with 5ml of 3 M sodium hydroxide solution and 45mL of water. Afterward I added them into a 250mL beaker of 10mL of 3% aqueous potassium ferricyanide with 10mL of 3% hydrogen peroxide. This produced the chemiluminescent reaction.<br><br>The outcome was fairly similar in both the solutions tested considering the amount of light that was shown at the end of the trials. The larger chamber and the smaller chamber had nearly the same chemiluminescent reaction. I compared them to the standard American commercial Luminal and it turned out that the outcome for both of the homemade Luminal compared to the commercial Luminal was more luminescent. The commercial Luminal lasted for only a few seconds. With the homemade Luminal the chemiluminescent reaction was a minute and a half. It was seen that a different sized (volume) chamber does affect the chemiluminescent reaction in Luminal.

TOWARD SELF-ASSEMBLING NANOCIRCUITRY USING LIQUID CRYSTAL SOLVENTS
Karl James Plank
Squalicum High School, Bellingham WA, USA

The ability to control the positional and orientational order of nanometer-sized building blocks could one day lead to innovative new methods for the construction of nanometer-scale electronics and other useful devices. The goal of this study was to develop a fundamentally new method for organizing matter at nanometer length scales - through use of defects in liquid crystal (LC) solvents. Zinc oxide (Zno)nanorods were suspended in the LC 4'-cyano-4-pentylbiphenyl (5CB) and deposited onto grooved polycarbonate membranes, some patterned with domains of alkylthiolate monolayers. Scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy confirmed the ability of 5CB LC to orient ZnO nanorods. These findings demonstrate the potential of LCs to be effective and versitile means of solution-phase assembly of ordered films of rod-shaped nanoparticles.

ABSTRACT THE EFFECTS OF VARIOUS FILTRATION MEDIA ON ARGUILEH SMOKE
Allister Edwin Wilton
Westview High School, Martin, TN , USA

This project was intended to develop an analytical method for the analysis of Arguileh smoke. The collection method chosen involved placing various filtration media and a C-18 collection cartridge in line with an Arguileh. the filtration media were the variables being examined. Standard solutions of nicotine and methylene dichloride wre prepared, and injections were made by passing two millilters of methylene dichloride through the cartridge. Then all solutions were injected into a HP8950A gas chromatograph. The results were unexpected because no nicotine peak was present, and an unidentifiable peak occurred in two experimental groups and the contro group also.

NATURE'S RECIPES: ETHANOL AS FUEL
William Curtis Young
Farmington High School, Farmington, NM, United States of America 

The purpose of this project was to ascertain if it was possible to recycle fermented organic materials to meet energy needs. This was done through fermentation and distillation of apples, potatoes, and corn to discover which product would yield the greatest amount of ethyl alcohol. To attain accuracy, a second phase was completed to improve the project. It was hypothesized that fermented organic garbage could be produced, and its product would be alcohol. It was thought that corn would produce the most ethanol, followed by apples with potatoes yielding the least. In the second phase, despite the change in size of the sample, the results will stay the same as the first phase because the amount of starting oxygen will have little effect. As for the double column, it will improve the distillation of the samples but not significantly. It is also thought that the corn will produce a greater amount of alcohol. The first thing done in this project was to apply for a permit from the local Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms to produce a small amount of ethanol for experimentation. Mashes were made, alcohol was fermented and later distilled. The results were that ethanol was able to be produced and potatoes yielding the most alcohol followed by apples and lastly corn. Potatoes had the highest percentage of alcohol followed by corn with apples having the lowest. The hypothesis was supported in the first part because alcohol was produced, but it was rejected in the second because the potatoes produced the most alcohol instead of the corn. The Phase Two hypothesis was supported partially in the first part and was supported in the second and third parts. Percentages increased and the corn had better results. It is improbable that a family would produce the ethanol themselves because they would need about 22 gallons (83.279 liters) per week to meet all their needs, but if power companies would use ethanol to power homes, ethanol could become the fuel of the future.

DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL DNA SENSITIVE DYE SENSORS USING COMBINATORIAL APPROACH
Rohan Kirit Panchamia
Herricks Senior High School, New Hyde Park New York, United States

Novel dsDNA/RNA and dsDNA-sensitive fluorescence dye sensors were developed based on combinatorially-created styryl dyes. Through the combinatorial approach, a fluorescent library was produced based on the styryl scaffold. The fluorescent library was screened for potential nucleic acid dye sensors using dsDNA and RNA. In the initial screening, 40 out of 855 combinatorial styryl dye members were discovered to have a fluorescence intensity enhancement upon dsDNA or RNA treatment. Following the initial screening, certain target compounds were resynthesized, purified and tested, and compounds 1, 2, and 3 were found to selectively bind to dsDNA, as seen by fluorescence spectroscopy. Fluorometric titrations of compounds 1-3 with dsDNA in a buffer solution resulted in a linear increase in the fluorescence intensities. The addition of a series of concentrations of dsDNA and RNA to compounds 1-3 resulted in significant fluorescence enhancement or fold increase with dsDNA than with RNA. Minimal emission wavelength shifting upon dsDNA addition occurred as well. The localization of compounds 1-3 to subcellular compartments in live UACC-62 human melanoma cells was determined. Moreover, the working concentrations of the fluorescence dyes, dsDNA, and RNA within a pH 7.4 environment were found.<br><br><br>Keywords: Combinatorial chemistry; dsDNA; Fluorescent library; Fluorescence spectroscopy; RNA; Styryl Dyes<br><br>

THE STUDY OF POLYETHYLENE CRYSTAL GROWTH
Brian Christopher Czornyj
Roy C. Ketcham High School, Wappingers Falls , NY

The purpose of this project was to study polymer crystal growth from the melt. Polyethylene, a simple polymer, of varying molecular weights was selected and compared to well characterized low molecular weight PE (Polywaxes). Since it is difficult to make low molecular weight PE model polymers, little prior research has been done on the PE Polywaxes. <br><br><br> An experimental hot stage was constructed from an electric frying pan, a voltage regulator, and a digital thermometer. Samples were prepared on glass slides that were placed inside the hot stage and heated above their melting temperatures. Varying cooling rates were used to study how the molecular weights affected the growth of polymer crystals. The samples were then analyzed under a polarizing microscope. <br><br><br> The results showed that Linear Low Molecular Weight Polyethylene crystallized much easier than high molecular weight PE. Slow cooling of the PE 1000 and 2000 produced well-formed crystals. Cooling rates for the lowest molecular weight Polywax did not appear to affect the crystal growth.<br><br><br> High Molecular Weight Polyethylenes were harder to crystallize. Low Density PE (LDPE) showed poorer chain orientation, and even slow cooling rates did not appear to affect the size and growth of the crystals. Since LDPE is branched, this inhibits crystallization. High Density PE (HDPE) is virtually un-branched and exhibited larger crystals when cooled slowly from the melt. A technique was developed using thin samples of HDPE prepared from solution which enhanced the visibility to see the formation of spherulites and branching structure. <br><br><br>

OBTAINING FUEL BY ELECTROLYTIC DECOMPOSITION OF SEA WATER.
CLAUDIO BRAVO
EAGLE SCHOOL , ANTOFAGASTA , CHILE .

This project in its present form is the result of an investigation into sea water electrolysis. The initial idea came up because Chile lacks enough fuel, and specially because we have to invest a lot of money in buying it from our neighbours who are reaching a crisis in terms of fuel production that will affect us enormously.<br><br> This project proposes to create an ecological industry without damaging the environment through the production of fuel by electrolytic decomposition of sea water, using wind power to generate the necessary electricity at a low cost.<br><br> This decomposition generates oxygen,hydrogen, chlorine gas , hydrocholrine and other salts.<br><br> The development of this project included a series of experiments which were mainly based on finding the most suitable electrodes for the sea water electrolysis.<br><br> These need specific characteristics, such as not to interfere in the electrolytic reactions.<br><br> The contribution of this project is mainly the obtention of an ecological and cheap fuel source which can easily be obtained from sea water.<br><br> Wind power also plays a vital role in this experiment, and due to the fact that Chile has several windy regions, wind power is obtainable throughout the country.<br><br> It is important to state that our country owns more than 5.000<br><br>kilometers of sea-shore available for this interesting valuable purpose.

PREVENTION OF MARINE CORROSION BY PHOTOGALVANIC ACTION
Mary Katherine Soltys
Notre Dame Academy, Park Hills, Kentucky, USA

Metal corrosion costs billions of dollars each year in repairs and material replacement. It is a special problem for structures exposed to seawater. The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether a photogalvanic system could reduce and possibly prevent marine corrosion. The metals tested were brass, copper, iron, aluminum and zinc. The metals in an Instant Ocean environment were photogalvanically coupled to TiO2-coated conductive glass by means of a salt bridge containing the electrolyte potassium carbonate. In the first place, UVA light was shone on the electrode. It was hypothesized that this would cause electrons to “jump” from titanium dioxide’s valence band to its conduction band. The free electrons would replace those from a conventional sacrificial electrode, preventing corrosion of the metal sample. The results showed the metals were in fact protected. Mass loss from the coupled metal samples was almost always less than in unprotected samples. Less corrosion by-product was produced for all five metals when they were galvanacially protected, with percent differences ranging from about 10 to 30%. A second series of experiments involved using a dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode. The dye was expected to effectively reduce the band-gap energy so that visible light could generate protective voltages. Copper and iron were tested in this situation and reduction of metal corrosion was again observed, especially for the copper.

SCHWERTMANNITE: A POTENTIAL EXOTIC MAGNETIC MATERIAL
Adeline Mary Grace
Newstead Wood School fo Girls, Avebury Road, Orpington, Kent, BR6 9SA, UK

Schwertmannite is an iron (III) sulphate hydrate mineral which forms in areas of low pH, around 2.2 – 2.6. Naturally, it occurs as a product of Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) when iron (II) and iron (III), by-products of mining, are released into surrounding river systems.<br><br>Magnetisation studies reveal Schwertmannite to have a broad transition temperature, Tg, at ~70 K. There is irreversibility below Tg indicating spin glass behaviour. The ideal formula for Schwertmannite is between Fe8O8(OH)8-2x(SO4)x.nH2O - Fe16O16(OH)16-2z(SO4)z.. This broad chemical formula hinders ascribing an accurate susceptibility and finding a Curie constant and thus requires further detailed data analysis. <br><br>The determined best method for Schwertmannite production was found to be the regular addition of 5M Urea to 0.55M Fe3+ with the solution maintained at 80°C and stirred at 400 rpm.<br><br>Schwertmannite although poorly crystalline is clearly not amorphous. When viewed using Scanning Electron Microscopy its coral like structure is clearly shown. It is also seen to form fibres which have been observed to be up to 600µm in length and have a BET value of 90.5m2/g. These fibres have the potential to act as catalysts in the hydrolysis of urea at 80°C and the oxidation of ammonia at 400°C. The nitrates are detected through infra-red spectroscopy where peaks are seen at 1401cm-1, 1384cm-1, 834cm-1. This could revolutionise the dialysis of urea in hospitals and the low temperature production of fertiliser. Whether the oxidation of ammonia can occur at temperatures below 400°C is the subject of ongoing investigation.<br><br>

IS BIODIESEL AND EFFICIENT ENERGY SOURCE?
Michael Lawrence Schulte
Terre Haute North Vigo High School, Terre Haute, IN USA

The purpose of this project was to determine whether or not biodiesel is a more efficient source of energy as compared to standard diesel fuel from petroleum sources. A comparison of thermal energy output per gram of fuel burned was used as a comparison. <br><br>Biodiesel fuel was prepared by transesterfication of soybean oil with methanol, and KOH. These methyl esters of the fatty acids were burned for approximately ten minutes per trial. A quantity of water was used to absorb heat energy. The resulting temperature changes were recorded with relevant specific heats and associated masses. The energy output per/gram was determined using standard calorimetric calculations. The same process was repeated to determine energy output for diesel fuel. Modifications to the process were made to include a more controlled environment and more accurate measurement equipment.<br><br>It was found that biodiesel had a greater energy output per/gram than the diesel fuel. Biodiesel yielded –2.02 kJ/g while diesel fuel yielded –1.52 kJ/g. The more controlled environment produced similar results. Biodiesel yielded an average of –11.8 kJ/g while diesel yielded –11.6 kJ/g.<br><br>Biodiesel seemed to be a more efficient energy source in both stages of testing. Biodiesel could be a potential replacement for traditional diesel fuel. At the present time society must rely on the more cost efficient source. Petroleum based fuels, such as diesel, is currently less costly to produce but is a nonrenewable resource. Biodiesel is made from a renewable resource and because any kind of fatty acids can produce it, biodiesel may become cheaper to produce in mass quantities especially if made from used oils.<br><br>

CHARACTERISTICS OF DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF BIODIESEL
Joel Carr
Velva High School, Velva, North Dakota

The purpose of this experiment was to determine which vegetable oil produced the highest quantity of biodiesel with the lowest gelling temperature. Biodiesel is a renewable fuel and is lower in pollutants than petroleum-based diesel fuel. I began the experiment by making biodiesel from five different vegetable oils (peanut, corn, canola, soybean, and sunflower). I mixed 250 milliliters of methanol. It took one hour to twenty-four hours for the biodiesel to separate. I measured the amount of biodiesel produced from each variety, and the results are as follows: Canola, 241 milliliters; peanut, 250 milliliters; corn, 258 milliliters; sunflower, 265 milliliters; and soybean, 278 milliliters. A small sample of biodiesel was then placed in a freezer, and the temperature at which each gelled was recorded. The average temperatures at which the varieties of biodiesel gelled are as follows: Peanut, 10.8 degrees Celsius; sunflower, -4.4 degrees Celsius; soybean, -5.3 degrees Celsius; corn, -7.1 degrees Celsius; canola, -9 degrees Celsius. The biodiesel that displayed the most favorable characteristics was soybean oil. Soybean oil yielded the highest amount of biodiesel and had a relatively low gelling temperature.

A VIABLE METHOD OF MASS EXTRACTION FOR 12-A FUMITREMORGIN C FROM A. FUMIGATUS
Srikanth Aravamuthan
Kalamazoo Area Mathematics and Science Center

Fumitremorgin C is a potent chemosensitizing agent in cancerous cell lines exhibiting multidrug resistance. it is a cell cycle inhibitor, and, in high doses, a tremorgenic mycotoxin. Therefore, the study of this compound is important for cancer pathology, cell division/replictaion, and pesticides. <br><br>Since de novo synthesis of fumitremorgin C is time consuming and expensive, isolation of the compound from its only known biological source-the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus-is the best way to efficiently obtain it in large quantities. The project aims to develop suitable extraction methods for obtaining fumitremorgin C from A. fumigatus biomass. <br><br>Ethyl acetate extract of the powdered biomass extract was first partitioned between hexane and water and the resulting interface was re-partitioned with ethyl acetate and water. The ehtyl acetate extract was then extracted with methanol. The methanol solubles and precipitate were fractionated using preparative centrifugal chromatography (chromatotron). Selected fractions were characterized via HPLC and TLC. Based on these profiles, chromatotron fraction 6 from the methanol precipitate and chromatotraon fraction 4 from the methanol solubles were determined to be pure by comparison of the melting point ranges and UV wavelength absorption maxima with the corresponding known values for 12-a fumitremorgin C. likewise, vacuum column fraction 3 is consistent with 12-b fumitremorgin C. Furthermore, the fractions were identified by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectroscopy. Chromatotron fraction 6 and chromatotron fraction 4 resulted in equivalent ppm and m/z amounts in comparison with the accepted values for the 12-a fumitremorgin C.

RAMBUTAN INK FROM FRUIT RINDS OF NAPHELIUM LAPPACEUM
Esther Chiew Yee Chiong
SMK Batu Lintang, Kuching, Sarawak, Malaysia

Rambutan (Naphelium lappaceum) is one of the commonest and best loved fruits in Malaysia. The objective of this project is to study the possibility of using the fruit rinds of rambutan which are thrown away as waste to produce black ink.<br><br><br> Water extract, alcohol extract or acetone extract of fresh and dry rambutan fruit rinds was mixed with iron sulphate to produce black ink. The effect of different amounts of iron sulphate on the durability of the black ink was investigated. The tannin content of fruit rinds from different fruiting stages was compared. The colour intensity, colourfastness, lightfastness, water resistance and viscosity of the ink samples were tested and compared with the commercial ink.<br><br><br> The results showed that green fruit rinds have the highest amount of tannin compared to just ripe and ripe fruit rinds. 3-5% of iron sulphate is the optimum amount to be used to produce durable black ink. The black ink produced is water resistant, colourfast and lightfast. It is as good as the commercial ink. This ink can be used as a drawing and writing ink to be used with a fountain pen. It can also be used as an ink pad for rubber stamp, as a Chinese calligraphy ink and even as a bubble jet printer ink.<br><br><br> Million tons of rambutan fruit rinds which are thrown away yearly in Malaysia can be used to produce good quality and eco-friendly ink which can help to ensure a sustainable world.<br><br>

HOW SAFE IS YOUR DRINKING WATER?
Leigh Taylor Wamble, Ashley Helms
West Lauderdale High School, Collinsville, MS USA

The purpose of this project was to determine the safety of bottled drinking water by measuring the bacteriological effects of reusing drinking bottles, to evaluate the mineral content of the water, the pH and conductivity and finally to determine the effects of different types of water on cellular regeneration. Seven different bottled waters, including purified, spring, sparkling, mineral and sports were tested. Microbiological studies were carried out over a ten day period to measure the safety of reusing bottles. Hard water studies were conducted on each type of water. Planarians were cut into, placed in each of the different varieties of water and their rate of regeneration measured. The root tips of white onions grown in the different waters were cut, stained and then made into slides showing the number of cells in each stage of mitosis. Results showed that reuse of drinking water bottles produced significant increases in bacteria. The mineral content matched the stated amounts on the bottles, but the mineral salts present in the different waters varied according to the type of water. The rate of regeneration of the planarians and the onion root tip slides were close to that of the control. The sports, sparkling and seltzer water were conductive while all others were not. The pH values ranged between 4 and 6. It can be concluded that manufacturers of bottled water make every effort to keep bottled water safe as long as the consumer does not reuse the original plastic bottle.

STIMULATE ME - THE METHYLXANTHINE CONTENT OF COMMONLY CONSUMED BEVERAGES AND CHOCOLATE BARS
Moriah Lee Patterson, Amy Marie Harrington
Sheridan Freshman Academy, Sheridan, AR, USA

Personal daily observations conclude that many teenagers consume a number of soft drinks and chocolate bars. This is a problem because in these junk foods are found methylxanthines, compounds with stimulant properties such as caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline. The purpose of this project was to measure the amounts of caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline in commonly consumed beverages and chocolate.<br><br> The amounts of methylxanthines were measured in six soft drinks, coffee, tea, and three types of chocolate using high performance liquid chromatography. Of the soft drinks analyzed, Mountain Dew had the highest caffeine amount with 151.25 µg/mL and Sprite had the least with 2.36 µg/mL. On average, caffeine in coffee was 5.55 mg/g. Caffeine was 12.43 mg/g in green tea, 9.72 mg/g in black tea, and 1.32 mg/g in decaffeinated tea. The amounts for caffeine in chocolate were as follows (µg/g), 232.3 for milk, 74.5 for white, and 426.7 for dark chocolate. Theobromine was only detected in chocolate and the largest amount was in dark chocolate with 4160 µg/g. Theophylline in both the coffee and tea was in the 1-5 µg/mL range.<br><br> The results produced from this project proved the belief that Mountain Dew contains the most caffeine. It also was surprising to discover that Sprite and decaffeinated tea had small, but detectable amounts of caffeine. It was also interesting to observe that dark chocolate had more caffeine than Coke per gram, and contained such a large amount of theobromine compared to caffeine. <br><br>

HYDROGEN FUEL CELL WITH USE OF STAINLESS STEEL CATHODE THAT BEARS PALLADIUM "THORN"

Using two pieces of palladium-plated stainless steel gauze as electrodes and 0.5 mol/L aqueous sodium hydroxide as an electrolyte solution, we have constructed hydrogen cells. The efficiency of energy transformation from hydrogen to electricity was estimated from the duration of a solar motor, voltage, and current intensity. Finally, we were able to attain as high as 54% efficiency.<br><br> The electrode which gave high efficiency of the energy transformation was obtained by immersing the stainless steel gauze in hydrochloric acid, which contained 1% Vitamin C. The pre-treated stainless steel gauze was immersed in hydrochloric acid which contained palladium chloride, and was used as an anode in electroplating with 1.0-1.5 A current. In this operation, the formation of a thorn-like body on the surface of the gauze was observed. When this thorn was formed, the energy transformation efficiency was significanty enhanced to attain 21%.<br><br> Pictures of this thorn by electron microscope showed that the thorn was not simple crystals of palladium but was piles of capsules which was formed by microscopic crystals of palladium. We were able to raise the efficiency to 54% by compensating the hydrogen pressure which was lowered as the hydrogen was consumed.<br><br> There remain some questions. Why the pre-treatment of electrodes with vitamin C was necessary to obtain good results? What are the mechanisms of formation of the capsule-like palladium crystal piles? These questions are to be answered in further study.

SULFURIC ACID GREATER INCREASES THE EFFICIENCY OF ELECTROLYSIS OF WATER
Tucker Mason Armstrong, John Ritter
Sherando High School, Stephens City, VA, United States

This experiment intended to determine which polyatomic ion greater enhances the efficiency of electrolysis of water. The independent variables were the different polyatomic ions added to pure water; including: sodium sulfate, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride, and pure water was the control. The dependent variable was the amount of total gas produced when these ionic solutions were exposed to a constant 25 volts over a 1hour time period. It was hypothesized based on research that salts serve well to carry a charge, that the sodium sulfate would result in the greatest gas production.<br><br> A home-made Hoffman Apparatus was constructed with individual columns above each the negative cathode and the positive anode. At the cathode, electrons are forced into the water dissociating the water molecules into oppositely charged hydrogen ions(H+) and hydroxide ions(OH-). The hydrogen ions combine with free electrons and one other hydrogen atom to form hydrogen gas while the hydroxide ion is pulled by the current to the anode where it recombines with three other hydroxide ions to form two molecules of water and one diatomic molecule of oxygen gas. <br><br> The control produced an expected result of no gas while the sulfuric acid produced an average of 127mL well over twice the amounts produced by the other solutions. It can be concluded that the sulfuric acid dissociated into ions of a greater electronegative charge than those of the other compounds, thus allowing it to better carry the current between the electrodes while disproving the hypothesis.<br><br>

Homogeneous, gas-phase, atmospheric chemical processes revolve around the 6 molecular species CO, O3, NO-, NO2-, HO- and HO2-.This simple six species model can exhibit non-linear behaviors such as multiple steady states, oscillations, and chaos. With the addition of CH4, new, more exotic behaviors can be observed. Stability in a simplified 8 reaction photochemical system involving these seven dynamic chemical species varies with changes in the emission rates of CO, O3, NO-, and CH4. In the 8 reaction mechanism, in addition to non-linear oscillatory behaviors, a phenomenon deemed the "blue sky catastrophe" can be observed. The nonlinear behaviors of the photochemical models can be analyzed using numerical integration, algebraic analysis, and equilibrium point analysis. In addition, network analysis has shown that the reaction structure of the mechanism is intrinsically capable of admitting multiple steady states. In applying observed rate constants to the chemical reactions, the system has been numerically integrated to determine the concentration at equilibrium of every chemical species. With the addition of loss terms, a large comprehensive 52 reactions tropospheric mechanism was observed numerically to not only exhibit "blue sky catastrophe" and oscillatory behaviors, but true multiple steady state behaviors can also be observed. Moreover, certain variation of emission rates exemplifies that potentially, bistability never becomes extinct. Additionally, two dimensional isopleth contour analyses were applied and the contour plots easily pinpoint to regions of bistability. Currently, experimentation on the 52 reaction mechanism is underway.

VITAMIN C AND A JUICY DILEMMA
Ravi Arvind Viradia, Mark Osborne Flannery
Capital High School, Charleston WV, USA

Vitamin C is essentially a lifesaver because it supplements synthesis of disease-fighting enzymes and prevents deficiency disorders. Its chemical name is ascorbic acid, and is one of the most consumed nutrients in the diet. For this reason, we studied popular fruit juices to determine which ones had the most vitamin C. With the chemical procedure known as titration, we were able to calculate the amounts of vitamin C in various fruit juices.<br><br> Titration is the process to determine the amount of a substance in a solution. By adding a measured volume of standard 0.05M iodine solution to a juice with starch indicator, the iodine reacts with the vitamin C and the starch to produce a color change at the reaction’s endpoint. <br><br> Contrary to other scientific studies, the American Heart Association asserts that amounts of vitamin C greater than 500 mg daily could cause the development of atheosclerosis. Our research will help better the lives of people by highlighting the benefits and possible risks of vitamin C.<br><br> The contributions of this project will assist consumers in making health-conscience choices about the selection of juices for vitamin C consumption. For many, juices are the primary source of vitamin C. We found that grapefruit juices, as a class, are the optimal juices for vitamin C content. Also, apple juices had a relatively high content, but were not consistent as a class. By getting the right juice, consumers can supply themselves with a healthier drink, and in turn, live a healthier lifestyle.<br><br>

CHARACTERIZATION OF CYCLOMETALATED IR (III) AND PT (II) COMPLEXES AS EFFICIENT SINGLET OXYGEN SENSITIZERS
Henry Fong, Allen Tran
Alhambra High School, Alhambra, California, USA

Although singlet oxygen (the first excited form of dioxygen) research has been of great interest to many research groups since the 1960s, little information is available on the photophysical properties of transition metal complexes that sensitize the production of singlet oxygen. Through time-resolved laser spectroscopy, the singlet oxygen quantum yields and quenching rates (rate of singlet oxygen deactivation) of cyclometalated octahedral iridium (III) and square planar platinum (II) complexes were determined. Many of the complexes tested have high singlet oxygen quantum yields (0.4-1.0) and slow quenching rates when compared to most sensitizers. The relatively high quantum yields of singlet oxygen are attributed to the geometry of the complexes and the electronic conjugation between then ligands and metal center. It has been confirmed that the energy transfer site of these complexes lies at the metal center. The choice of the cycylometalating ligand also appears to have a profound effect on singlet oxygen quantum yields. Singlet oxygen is believed to be the only product formed due to several factors, including metal to ligand charge transfer and the unlikely occurrence of electron transfer in our system. <br><br> The results augment current understanding of transition metal photosensitizers and show promise for application of similar photosensitizers to photodynamic therapy. Particularly interesting is that these transition metal complexes can be easily altered to fit its biological application by changing the cyclometalating or ancillary ligands.<br><br>

DESIGN AND SYNTHESIS OF SECOND AND THIRD GENERATION TAXOIDS
Tina Ho, Nora Iordanova Micheva
Smithtown High School, Smithtown; Ward Melville High School, E. Setauket, N.Y.

In this year alone, approximately 1.4 million Americans will be diagnosed with cancer. There is no single treatment for the many types of cancer; however, paclitaxel (Taxol®) is one of the leading drugs in cancer chemotherapy. Despite its wide use, paclitaxel has some drawbacks. <br><br> For this reason second-generation taxoids possessing greater anticancer activity have been developed. One such taxoid, SB-T-1214, was previously tested in vitro with promising results. To further investigate this molecule, it was re-synthesized and sent for testing in vivo. Results from this test proved its superiority to paclitaxel in both tumor-sensitive and MDR-expressing tumor xenografts. <br><br> In addition, to explore the possibility of third-generation taxoids, a taxane-free anticancer agent was designed using molecular modeling. This molecule mimics the three-dimensional structure of paclitaxel. After its successful synthesis, the compound was fully characterized using NMR spectroscopy. The unique features of the designed compound will not only further the study of taxoid mimetics but also provide greater insight into the structural requirements of microtubule-stabilizing anticancer agents. <br><br>

YOU ARE NOW IN THE ZONE: INVESTIGATING THE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE LIESEGANG RINGS
Aaron Mark Weaver, Skylar Davis Williams
Miami High School, Miami, OK 74354

The purpose of this project is to evaluate the physical factors that influence the precipitation reactions known as Liesegang ring formations. The Liesegang ring formations in this experiment involve CuSO4 and K2CrO4 which dissociate into ions and are represented by the following net ionic reaction:<br><br>Cu+2 (s) + CrO4 2- (aq) --> CuCrO4 (s)<br><br>SO4 2- and K1+ are spectator ions and are not involved in the precipitation reactions forming the ring structures. In this investigation, the K2CrO4 (0.1 M) reactants were homogeneously dispersed within the gel medium while the CuSO4 crystals exceeding 0.1M were placed over the agar-chromate system. <br><br> <br><br>The experiment evaluated the number of rings formed, the length of the reaction zone, the distance to the first ring formations, and the definition of the precipitation rings. The environmental factors studied included: cold, incubated, 1.5 V, 3.0 Volts, U-V light, Darkness, and Electromagnetism. The Control was exposed to room lightening and room temperature. <br><br> <br><br>Statistical analysis of the overall results indicated a P value of 0.000 which indicates the variables tested have a significant influence on the formation of the precipitations and are not due to random chance. Additionally, Student’s t-Test comparing each tested variable to the control further evaluated the significance of the data by comparing the means of the samples.

Claudia Marily González Ruiz, Isaura Velasquez Bautista
Colegio de Estudios Científicos y Tecnológicos. San Pablo Apetatitlán Tlaxcala 

Systematic analysis is a basic tool used for identification of inorganic compounds. This project examines various methods of Systematic Analysis. Instead of using sulfhidric acid, we opted to use sodium carbonate becouse it less toxic and, as a water soluble salt, the reactions are faster. We have also adopted microscale methods and the use of alternative laboratory materials. This project to increase student participation in chemestry laboratories, to reduce cost of laboratory materials, to reduce the time necessary for laboratory practices, to reduce the risk of exposure to toxic substances, to reduce the risk of air and soil pollution. Using sodium carbonate instead of sulfhidric acid, adopting laboratory procedures using microscale techniques, writing a laboratory manual describing the procedures used, use of alternative materials and microscale procedures reduced the cost of laboratory materials by an everage of seventy porcent allowed more students to participate in chemestry laboratories, use of sodium carbonate instead of sulfhidric acid reduced time in the laboratory due to faster chemical reactions, and reduced the risk of toxic exposure by using smaller quantities of reagents, using sodium carbonate an applying microscale procedures has reduced the risk of air and soil pollution.

INHIBITING THE GROWTH OF MICROBES THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF A COLLOIDAL SILVER-BASED PAINT
Kara Morgenstern, Miki Duruz
Long Beach High School, Lido Beach, NY, USA

Many schools and public buildings are seeing an increase in the amount of disease spreading throughout them, known as “Sick Building Syndrome.” Common vectors include doorknobs, keyboards, faucets, and railings, which may result in the transfer of microbes, thus contributing to the spread of diseases. This experiment focuses on the “retro-fitting” of existing buildings, to create surfaces that will immediately have self-sterilizing properties to inhibit the growth of microbes. Colloidal silver, CET, and copper solutions were mixed into polyurethane paints, and then applied onto several doorknobs throughout the school. Of the three substances compared, the colloidal silver was the most successful in inhibiting growth. The colloidal silver solution was further tested and mixed into a water-based paint and applied onto sterile plastic tubes in varying concentrations. Using the MB2 device, an air sampler that draws in a set amount of air, samples from doorknobs were taken and then incubated to find the present amount of growth on each surface. It was hypothesized that if there is a greater amount of colloidal silver in paint, inhibition of microbial growth would be the highest. All results supported the hypothesis and resulted in the optimal range of colloidal silver in a water-based paint to be between 0.5mL and 2mL (of 500ppm colloidal silver in 20mLPolycrylic paint).

SOAKING UP THE PHOTONS: DETERMINATION OF THE UV ABSORBANCE PROPERTIES OF ACTIVE SUNSCREEN INGREDIENTS IN POOL WATER
Ashley Brooke Van Galen
Pensacola High School, Pensacola, Florida, USA

The purpose of this project was to explore the UV absorbance properties of three compounds commonly found in sunscreens, and to shed light on their potential use as UV light-protective pool water additives. The compounds selected for testing were para-amino benzoic acid (PABA), dioxybenzophenone (dioxybenzone), and homosalate.<br><br> Pool water samples were collected from a residential pool and analyzed by a colorimeter for free chlorine, total chlorine, combined chlorine, pH, hardness, alkalinity and cyanuric acid. This enabled comparison with normal values for pool water in each of the respective areas. Next, each of the three compounds was added to pool water and the absorbance of each solution was tested by a spectrophotometer. The wavelength range of interest was 230-380 nm, corresponding to the UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C ranges of ultraviolet light. It was concluded that PABA is the best candidate for a component of a pool additive that would presumably protect the underwater swimmer from dangerous ultraviolet radiation. PABA showed a distinct wavelength of maximum absorbance in the UV-C range, as well as very high absorbance values in the UV-B range. A molar absorptivity of 15,064 L/mol.cm. was calculated for PABA using a Beer's Law Plot. The other compounds did not readily dissolve in pool water, and their spectra did not show significant absorbance in the UV range. The areas explored in this project have potential for application in both the chemical and medical worlds.

DISCOVERY OF COMPOUNDS ACTIVE AGAINST STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS FROM THE MARINE SPONGE CHORISTIDA
Sheena Bhalla
Lincoln Park Academy, Fort Pierce, Florida, United States

A significant number of novel secondary metabolites with potent pharmacological properties have been discovered from marine organisms. In this study, a newly discovered marine sponge of the order Choristida, which exhibited considerable activity against the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, was studied. These S. aureus active compounds were isolated and structurally analyzed for possible anti-microbial effects.<br><br>The compounds were extracted and isolated from the sponge using bioassay-guided fractionation. After ethanol-based extraction, solvent portioning and thin-layer chromatography ultimately yielded a butanol-soluble fraction and a water-soluble fraction active against S. aureus. The more biologically active BuOH-soluble fraction was subjected to reversed-phase C-18 high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to give three fractions (BHAS 28-1, BHAS 28-2 and BHAS 28-3). Two of the fractions, BHAS 28-2 and BHAS 28-3, showed considerable antimicrobial activity against S. aureus in a bioassay.<br><br>The fraction which appeared more viable from HPLC results was subjected to various spectroscopic methods to identify possible structures of this water-soluble compound. Mass spectroscopy studies on the fraction indicated a mixture of compounds. 1Hydrogen Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H-NMR) spectra indicated the presence of several methylene, methyl, olefinic and hydroxymethine groups. The results suggest the compounds of the sponge Choristida to be similar to those of the halistanol sulfates, compounds previously cited to demonstrate anti-fungal and anti-HIV properties. <br><br> <br><br>

Blanche Ely High School, Pompano Beach, FL, USA

Bioglass 45s5 ® is a revolutionary substance used to promote bone repair for orthopedic and dental applications. Sometimes the success of this material is dependent on the reaction rate, a function of particle size. The objective is to test whether the reduced particle size makes Bioglass 45s5 ® react faster.<br><br> Bioglass 45s5 ® was mixed into a sol-gel composite to ensure uniform particle distribution and to isolate the silica component of the bioactive ceramic. A standard Bioglass 45s5 ® of .4 to .6 microns were reacted to form the hydroxyl-apatite layer. After an allotted time frame, the reaction rates of Bioglass 45s5 ® were recorded. Bioglass 45s5 ® bioactivity was analyzed using FTIR analysis. The researcher postulated correctly that the smaller Bioglass 45s5 ® would ensure a decreased reaction rate of the bioactive ceramic. <br><br> <br><br>

IDENTIFICATION OF THE ALLERGEN TARTRAZINE IN M&MS USING AGAROSE GEL ELECTROPHORESIS
Jessica Ann Lack
Nettleton High School, Jonesboro AR, United States

Tartrazine, also known as Yellow 5, is a known allergen. It has been implicated in many disease processes. A person who is allergic to tartrazine must practice strict avoidance in order to prevent an allergic reaction that could result in death. The purpose of this study was to determine if agarose gel electrophoresis would be sensitive enough to determine which M&Ms contained tartrazine in their color coating. Samples of color from M&Ms were prepared by soaking the M&Ms in distilled water. Controls were prepared by using Kroger brand food colors. Agarose gel electrophoresis using 0.8% agarose was capable of identifying tartrazine in all of the colors of M&Ms tested that contain tartrazine. Tartrazine was found in the Yellow, Green, and Brown M&Ms. Tartrazine was not found in Blue, Red, or Orange M&Ms.<br><br>

SYNTHESIS OF OXADIAZOLE DERIVATIVES FOR USE IN SUPRAMOLECULAR ASSEMBLY
Matthew Bret Weiss
Breck School, Minneapolis Minnesota, United States of America

Supramolecular self-assembly using metal-ion ligand bonding is a growing scientific area. Certain oxadiazole molecules have a potential for self-assembly through the use of metal-ion ligand bonding when they are free from impurities. Although these molecules have been synthesized previously, an effective purification procedure for these molecules has not been developed. By modifying the Balsells protocol I created a procedure that was very effective in removing impurities.<br><br> My research involved the successful synthesis and purification of four oxadiazole molecules: 2,5-di(thiophen-2-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole, 2,5-diphenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole, 2-(furan-2-yl)-5-(thiophen-2-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole, and 2-phenyl-5-(pyridine-30yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole. The molecules were synthesized using acylation and cycloaromatization, and they were purified using vacuum filtration, dessication, and qualitative transfers with ether. Purity was verified through NMR spectroscopy and EI-MS examination. The next step in the self-assembly process will be to test the self-assembling abilities of 2-phenyl-5-(pyridine-30yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole. <br><br>

APPLYING LIPOSOMES AS LUCIFERASE VESICLES IN PHOTODYNAMIC CANCER THERAPY
Rachel Ragnhild Carlson
Columbia River High School, Vancouver WA, United States of America

The applications of biological liposomes as vesicles to be used in photodynamic cancer therapy were explored in this project. In photodynamic therapy, a light-sensitive substance called a photosensitizer is chemically excited to produce the tumor-destroying singlet oxygen. The chemical luciferase from Photinus pyralis fireflies can produce the light that excites a photosensitizer. If luciferase, as well as its substrate luciferin and a photosensitizer, are transmitted to a tumor site in vivo via liposome vesicles, singlet oxygen will aggressively react with malignant cells. This experiment sought the best method of incorporating luciferase into liposome vesicles during liposome synthesis. A luciferase substitute, bovine serum albumin with Texas red dye aggregates (TR-BSA), was added to the liposome synthesizing process either during liposomes’ hydration, during their sonication, or not at all (control). Solutions containing liposomes were centrifuged to form liposome pellets and supernatants. Fluorimeter scans determined if TR-BSA was more present inside liposomes (in the pellet) or outside liposomes (in the supernatant). I hypothesized that TR-BSA would have the highest concentrations inside liposomes if added during the step of hydration. Results indicated that liposome pellets did not provide valid data because too much fluorimeter light diffracted off of solid lipid material. However, supernatant data showed that little difference existed between TR-BSA concentrations in liposomes treated during hydration and those treated during sonication; there were generally high levels of TR-BSA outside of liposomes. Control samples contained few traces of the substance. It was thus determined that new methods of integrating luciferase into liposomes are required.

Consequently, researches aimed at improving the characteristics of secondary batteries also increase mobility and service life of these devices.<br><br>My research is devoted to electrochemical generation of nickel hydroxide as paste of alkaline accumulators and analysis of its physical-electrochemical characteristics. The electrochemical method is alternative to the chemical method that is commonly used in manufacturing.<br><br>The specific objectives were:<br><br>a) to explore possibilities of electrochemical manufacturing of nickel hydroxide electrodes;<br><br>b) to study the effect of the medium on crystallinity of electrochemically generated nickel hydroxide during storage;<br><br>To find out the possibility of electrochemical generating was invented a special cell.<br><br>Using this cell, we can obtain a porous non-lamellar electrode.

To determine the influence we make X-ray diffractograms of the samples that were kept in the air, water and alkaline solution for one month.Conclusion from second part is that crystallinity of nickel hydroxide increase during the storage in each of the studied environments. In alkaline this effect is the most. I showed the importance of activity addings for accumulators that will prevent decreasing of capacity as a result of increasing of crystallinity.

This project is composed of the discovery of the phenomenon of the exceptional volume contraction in NaF aqueous solution and the explanation for it as well.<br><br>Although it seemed impossible that a mixture of volume Vc attained by a substance of volume Va adding to another substance of volume Vb gets a smaller volume than Vb, viz, Vc<Vb, I proved that it is really observable when a definite value of NaF was dissolved into water in a tailor made volumetric flask.

A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF HEAVY METALS FOUND IN FERTILIZED AND NON-FERTILIZED SOILS OF SOUTHERN INDIANA
Jessica Lee Jackson
Eastern High School, Pekin IN, US

A Comparative Study of Heavy Metals Found in Fertilized and Non-fertilized Soils of Southern Indiana<br><br> Jessica Jackson<br><br> <br><br> Crops and other plants are known to absorb toxic, heavy metals from soil; thus the potential to impact human health. The purpose of this project was to test the amounts of heavy metals found in soils as a result of repeated fertilizing. It was hypothesized that soil samples collected from highly fertilized fields would contain higher levels of heavy metals when compared to non-fertilized areas. Five soil samples were collected from six sites; three fertilized and three non-fertilized. Samples were processed to remove the heavy metals and analyzed using an Ion Chromatograph. A blank was also tested and results were compared to a standard. All samples were tested for Lead, Iron, Copper, Nickel, Zinc, Cobalt, Cadmium, and Manganese in parts per million (ppm). Iron was very high in all the samples tested. Iron is found naturally in soil, but can also be found in fertilizer. The fertilized samples contained higher amounts of cobalt, copper, zinc, and manganese when compared to the samples for the non-fertilized sites. However, Site 1D tested very high for manganese at 251.79 ppm, when compared to the highest in the fertilized Site 6C at 110.21 ppm. This was not expected because Site 1 is non-fertilized and Site 6 is fertilized. Manganese was the most commonly found element. Unfortunately, the samples did not contain high enough amounts of lead, nickel, and cadmium to yield measurable results. Based on the data collected, the hypothesis was supported.

SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF NOVEL POLYNUCLEAR MANGANESE COMPLEXES FUNCTIONING AS SINGLE-MOLECULE MAGNETS
Sarah Hyunee Nam
St. Petersburg High School International Baccalaureate, St. Petersburg, FL USA

The present interest in high-nuclearity manganese-carboxylate clusters is the investigation of molecular nanomagnets, also termed single-molecule magnets (SMMs). SMMs function as monodisperse magnetic particles below their blocking temperature (T ) and have potential applications for high-density information storage as well as qubits in quantum computers. The existing challenge of researchers is to increase the T of these complexes because practical applications require T above liquid nitrogen, 77 K. The current highest T (3 K) belongs to the members of the [Mn O (O CR) (H O) ] family. Modifications to previously studied SMMs, by the use of the largely uninvestigated ligand, 2-pyridylacetic acid hydrochloride (PDA), were initiated for the first time by various crystallization reactions of PDA, [Mn O (O CCH ) (H O) ]HO CCH 4H O], and base. A stable polynuclear manganese-complex with SMM properties has been synthesized by the mole-ratio reaction, 1 [Mn O (O CCH ) (H O) ]HO CCH 4H O] : 6 PDA : 6 Et N in MeCN. This complex has been characterized using elemental analyses, Infrared spectroscopy, and Superconducting Quantum Interference Device magnetometer. The novel molecule displayed frequency dependent out-of-phase signals below 2.4 K, the fact indicative of slow magnetization-relaxation. Such studies are quintessential both for the design of a rational synthetic method for improved SMMs and the preparation of novel 3d metal carboxylate clusters.

ON THE DYNAMICAL BEHAVIOR OF POLYAMPHOLYTES
Michael J. Pizer
University School of Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, USA

Polyampholytes are polymers that have mixed distributions of positive and negative charges along the backbone of the chain. We have generalized the classical Rouse-Zimm bead-spring model for semi-dilute polymers to describe the dynamics of polyampholytes in aqueous solution in an external electric field. Long-range hydrodynamic interactions between the beads are described within the framework of the Kirkwood-Riseman approximation in which the Oseen tensor is replaced by its equilibrium average. By introducing normal mode transformations, we derive an expression for the electrophoretic mobility and the self-diffusion coefficient of a polyampholyte chain with an arbitrary charge distribution. We then explicitly calculate the electrophoretic mobility of a polyampholyte with a periodic or random charge distribution. The amplitude of the chain deformation during electrophoretic motion is also discussed. This study improves our ability to predict the dynamics of polyampholytes in solution, providing an important tool for the development of novel applications of polyampholytes to medicine and industry.

IDENTIFICATION OF THE DETERMINANTS OF ANTIMALARIAL DRUG ACTION
Smita Mascharak
Santa Cruz High School, Santa Cruz, California, USA

Over the last century, Plasmodium falciparum (the parasite responsible for malaria) has become resistant to several common antimalarials. The goals of this project were to 1) identify which structural features of quinoline-based antimalarials prevent heme polymerization (thereby killing Plasmodium with free heme inside the cell) and 2) find out whether such features could be systematically assembled in a molecule (and employed as possible antimalarials). It was hypothesized that such features could be identified and new molecules that suppress heme polymerization could be synthesized. <br><br>First, conditions were established that allowed heme polymerization studies in a non-enzymatic manner. The capacity to deter heme polymerization of several known antimalarials (like quinine and chloroquine) and chemicals with similar structures were assessed. Typically, ~50 mg of hemin was heated with ~100 mg of drug in 5M Na-acetate buffer (pH 7) at 70 degC for 60 min. The resulting product was filtered, washed, dried and identified by infrared spectroscopy (bands at ~1660 and 1210 cm-1 indicated presence of heme polymer: beta-hematin). The results of these experiments indicated three structural features that appeared responsible for the prevention of heme polymerization. Next, two designed analogues with and without these structural features were synthesized via standard peptide synthesis protocol. The analogues were identified by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and employed in heme polymerization reactions. <br><br>The results clearly indicated that the specified structural features are indeed critical for the suppression of heme polymerization. Utilization of these features may afford potential antimalarial drugs without the extensive search for novel natural products.

BIMOLECULAR PHOTOCHEMICAL REACTIONS OF INCLUSION COMPOUNDS IN THE SOLID STATE
Mollie Ann Sussman
Rabbi Alexander S. Gross Hebrew Academy, Miami FL, USA

Solid-state chemistry offers a method to induce chemical reactivity not attainable in liquid state chemistry. The extent of this research focuses on bimolecular [4+4] photodimerization of the guest molecules in inclusion compounds. For the first time an inclusion compound of 2,4-hexadiyne-1,6-diol,1,1,6,6-tetraphenyl-1 as a host molecule with 2-hydroxy-4-methylpyradine as guest molecule was crystallized. It was found by X-ray analysis that the distance between two consecutive guests was 4.17 Å. Since the distance was just slightly below the determined limit for dimerization to occur, it was very questionable as to whether it would happen at all. However, it was found that after irradiation of ~60 hours, 66% of the unit cells of the crystal underwent dimerization. <br><br><br><br>Solid state chemistry is an effective procedure for mass producing a specific compound. When certain geometrical conditions have been met, the reaction can be truly efficient and friendly to the environment. Frequently there is only one product, so there is no need for isolation of products. Solid state chemistry may allow for economic mass production of a compound that could be used in formulating medication to fight diseases or serve as an antidote for bio-warfare.<br><br>

Noxubee County High School, Macon, MS, United States

Electrophoresis is the migration of charged particles or molecules under the influence of an applied electric field usually provided by immersed electrodes. This study measured ion mobility of sodium chloride and determined the effects of concentration and voltage on electrophoretic mobility, pH, and electrophoresis travel over time.<br><br><br>This project’s purpose was to study distinctions and influences between concentrations of NaCl by weight percent of E-pure H20 and voltages to develop time dependences (electrophoresis travel), ion mobility (velocity divided by electric field), and pH. The velocity was obtained from the voltage divided by the length between the anode (+) and cathode (-). <br><br><br>This study was divided into four groups (1 control, and 3 independent variable groups) with 3 trials per voltage group (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 volts). The four groups were developed by weight percentage (concentration) of 1-M NaCl solution. The control variables were: 1.46 % by weight of NaCl; 0-volts; and pH at 0-volts within concentrations for 1.46%, anode-4.80, cathode-3.80; 1.02%, anode-4.23, cathode-3.76; 0.73%, anode-5.02, cathode- 4.07; 0.44%, anode-6.86, cathode-5.45. The following were used as independent variables: percent by weight of NaCl (1.02%, 0.73%, 0.44%), and voltages (5, 10, 15, and 20). <br><br>During each trial, ion mobility decreased with decrease in sodium chloride concentration. Time dependences were dependent on the given voltage of each trial. The speed of ion movement increased with increase in voltage. There were significant changes between control pH and pH after voltage was applied.<br><br>

OPTIMIZING A CATALYST FOR ELIMINATION OF CARBON MONOXIDE EXHAUSTED FROM GAS WATER HEATER
Chen Wei Tsai
The Affiliated Senior High School of National Kaohsiung Normal University 

Accidental carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning resulted from incomplete combustion of gas water heaters occurs frequently when improbably installed. Initial studies indicated that burning rates at 15-30 L/min gas generated less than 200 ppm CO in the exhaust while that at 45 L/min would have the concentration of CO raised to a dangerous level of 11,000 ppm. The goal of this research is to develop a catalyst for overcoming this problem. Four different active metals (cobalt, copper, iron, and nickel) were used with different solid supports (silicon oxide, aluminum oxide, titanium oxide, and kaolin), metal to support ratios (loads, 5 to 20%), and calcination temperatures (200 to 500 Celsius) in order to develop a catalyst for the elimination of CO. It was found that cobalt displayed the highest catalytic activity and aluminum oxide was the most suitable support. Subsequent experiments suggested that the best cobalt loading was 10% and the optimal calcination temperature was 300 Celsius. Several catalysts were obtained in combination of different factors. The characteristic properties of each catalyst were determined employing BET-specific surface area analyzer and X-ray diffraction meter. Under controlled conditions, the optimized catalyst was found to be able to completely eliminate CO at a concentration as high as 15,000 ppm at a space velocity of 1,000 min-1 at all below 240 Celsius. It is also worthwhile to note that this catalyst can be made inexpensively and potentially of practical use.

FISH SCALES WASTES FROM SELECTED TELEOSTS: INNOVATIVE SORPTION MATERIALS FOR THE RECOVERY OF ASTAXANTHIN
Mark Timothy Villa Rodriguez
Claro Mayo Recto High School, Sampaloc, Manila, Philippines

This study shows the potential use of waste fish scales of teleosts Chanos chanos and Tilapia nilotica as natural sorption materials in the recovery of astaxanthin. <br><br> Astaxanthin is the major carotenoid responsible for the pink-red pigmentation of fish and shrimps. Aquatic animals in aquaculture cannot synthesize astaxanthin and this must be supplemented in their diet. It is an expensive feed additive commodity; hence, recovering astaxanthin from wastewater provides very significant economic and environmental advantages. <br><br> In this study, the researcher constructed a Fish Scale Adsorption Apparatus (FSAA) containing unshredded and shredded scales where synthetic astaxanthin dissolved in water was made to flow through.<br><br> Results showed that the compressed shredded Tilapia nilotica scales were most effective in adsorbing astaxanthin. The comparison of fish scales configurations considered the discoloration of filtrate, the total volume of filtrate collected, the time it took the first flow of filtrate to be released from the FSAA and the length of time the flow lasted.The occurrence of slits on the sclerits of the unshredded tilapia scales and the presence of debris like collagen materials on unshredded tilapia scales as revealed by the scanning electron micrographs were observed to retain astaxanthin better than milkfish scales by producing greater amount of clear, colorless filtrate and greater retention time before filtrate is released.<br><br> <br><br> Based on the effective adsorption features of the tilapia fish scales, it is suggested that these scales be studied as sorption materials for heavy metals in wastewater treatment.

THE MECHANISMS OF PROTON TRANSPORT THROUGH ONE-DIMENSIONAL WATER CHAINS STABILIZED BY IMIDAZOLE CHANNELS
Yin Yin Wu
Atherton High School, Louisville KY, USA

This experiment aims to gain insight into the mechanisms of proton transport in one-dimensional water chains stabilized by imidazole channels. <br><br> The system under study is composed of imidazoles with a central water chain arranged in a zigzag motif. The proton positions on the water chain and imidazole are believed to be half occupied. Ab initio B3LYP quantum mechanical calculations with 6-31G basis sets was used to find the potential energy profiles for systems with varying protonation states. A computer program was developed based on Monte Carlo methods to find the lowest global minimum configuration and proton occupancy rate for each of the 20 partially occupied sites.<br><br> The results show that following optimization, water molecules oriented to form hydrogen bonds with the unprotonated sites of the imidazole N and water O. Protonation and deprotonation of histidine regulated proton transport within this system. The MC simulations refined the structure by finding the percent of proton occupancy on the imidazole residues to be 50/50 for most sites, and the proton occupancy rates of water to be 50/50/70/30. Optimizations completed on systems with an extra proton illustrate that proton transfer involves both the Grotthus and Shuttle mechanism.<br><br> The contributions of this project include developing a novel computer program to find a more accurate rate of proton occupancy and the global minima configuration. Increased efficiency in finding the lowest energy structure was demonstrated by combining QM calculates of a single channel with MC simulations. Through analysis of the global minima structure and optimizations of the single channels, a mechanism for proton transport was proposed.<br><br>

REACTIVE MOLTEN METAL FLOW OVER GROOVED AND FLAT SURFACES
Alexander Danilo Zbrozek
Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Lexington, KY USA

Many products depend on the ability to join two specifically shaped pieces of metal. Heat exchangers are one of the biggest uses of industrial brazing technology. With complicated geometries, tight clearances, and low tolerance to error, modern heat exchangers challenge the limits of state-of-the-art brazing technology. The problem of constructing efficient heat exchangers is only compounded by the current trend to more complex shapes that defy traditional assembly methods. Additionally, the circuit board manufacturing industry relies on the flow of solders over copper surfaces to join components and their substrates in an electrically conductive and mechanically rigid fashion. Capillary flow of solder through microgrooves in a copper surface could also benefit manufacturers as lead pitches and overall component size shrink below reflow systems’ capability to join them.<br><br> This experimental study is devoted to a phenomenological investigation of molten metal flow in Pb/Sn over Cu systems and Al alloy over Al substrate systems. Both systems are tested under a controlled nitrogen atmosphere and recorded through hot stage microscopy and a digital video recorder. Tests are conducted with both flat geometries and grooved geometries.<br><br>

KINETICS AND STRUCTURAL FLUCTUATIONS OF THE RIBOSOME INTERACTING WITH TRNA: ROLE OF FLEXIBILITY OF EF-TU(GTP)AA-TRNA
Sudarsana Eldridge Mohanty
Lincoln School, Providence, Rhode Island, United States

A quantitative predictive model has been developed to describe the rotational motion of the ternary complex EF-Tu(GTP)aa-tRNA towards the peptidyl site (P-site) after correct mRNA codon and anticodon pairing of the cognate tRNA as observed in recent single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiment of Escherichia coli (E.coli) ribosome. The basic hypothesis is that aminoacytl-tRNA becomes more flexible when it interacts with elongation factor EF-Tu and guanosine 5’-triphosphate. The change in flexibility plays a crucial role in the rotational motion of the ternary complex towards the P-site. <br><br>The total energy of the ternary complex was constructed by taking into account pair-wise interactions between the residues that were within a cutoff distance Rc. For EF-Tu (GTP), the cutoff distance was taken to be the effective range of the inter-residue contacts, and this value was in the range between 7 Å and 10 Å. For tRNA nucleotides, the cutoff distance was 20 Å - the diameter of the A-form of RNA double helix. A normal mode analysis of the model was carried out to determine the root-mean-square fluctuation fi of residue i. The rate of rotational motion of cognate ternary complex towards the A-site as a function of magnesium concentration was calculated and compared with FRET experiments. Brownian dynamic simulation was carried out to unravel the role played by magnesium ion binding sites in tRNA. The basic ideas of this work were exploited to develop novel organic-tRNA molecular rectifiers in which the organic molecule consisted of linear allenic bridges. <br><br>

LIMITATIONS OF COTTRELL'S EQUATION
Bennet Grill
Rio Rancho High School, Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States

Cottrell’s Equation plays an important role in the world of electrochemistry—the science chiefly concerned with corrosion studies, bio-sensing, and fuel cells. This experiment sought to plot electrochemical diffusion coefficients of potassium ferricyanide [K3Fe(CN)6] and potassium ferrocyanide [K4Fe(CN)6] as functions of temperature and concentration. Temperatures ranged from 0.5 - 30 degrees Centigrade and concentrations spanned 0.1mM to 100mM. The Hardin-Sloane design of experiments consisted of 14 runs. Using a potentiostat, chrono-coulometry scans measured the induced charge of the solution over time. This information was used to calculate diffusion coefficients of the solution through Cottrell’s Equation. Problems rose, however, when testing solutions with concentrations of 0.1mM. The diffusion coefficients provided by Cottrell’s Equation were simply implausible. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy scans revealed that while most solutions were diffusion controlled, 0.1mM solutions were coming under mixed control. These results strongly suggested that Cottrell’s Equation is limited to diffusion controlled regimes. The design of experiments was modified to include higher concentration solutions in order to complete testing. In addition to revealing an important limitation of Cottrell’s Equation, the experiment provided a temperature-concentration reference model of diffusion coefficients for potassium ferricyanide and potassium ferrocyanide.

COMPARING VARIOUS DILUENTS WITH AN EXPERIMENTAL MONOMER
Laura Andrea de la Garza
John Jay Science and Engineering Academy, San Antonio Texas, USA

Many people take for granted the health and appearance of their teeth. Recently, resin composites have been replacing standard amalgam fillings. They are safer and aesthetically pleasing but not as durable as amalgam. The purpose of this experiment was to synthesize a resin that yields properties comparable to the commercial resin GTE. It was hypothesized that the experimental monomer when blended with selected mono-methacrylates will yield polymers having strengths and moduli equal to or better than those of the commercial resin GTE.<br><br>The experimental monomer, Dihydroxyphenyl ether C6 Dimethacrylate (DPEDMA) was chosen as the resin matrix. Ten and twenty percent weight solutions of isobornyl methacrylate (IBM), tetrahydrofurfuryl methacrylate (THFMA), and phenoxyethyl methacrylate (PEM), were added to photoinitiated DPEDMA. Ten 2 X 2 X 30 mm rectangular beams of each resin were cured in a Jeneric Pentron light oven. Transverse strengths and moduli were measured with an MTS-Instron 1125 universal testing machine. The bars were tested until failure. The data was compared the reference control GTE. <br><br>An analysis of variance and post-hoc using Student Newman Keuls was run. There was no significant difference of moduli within the modified samples. In conclusion, the modulus of 20%IBM+DPEDMA was comparable to GTE, and the strength was significantly greater than GTE. The data supported the hypothesis. It can be concluded that the experimental monomer when blended with selected mono-methacrylates will yield polymers having strengths and moduli equal to or better than those of the commercial resin GTE.<br><br>

USING NANOCERAMIC SPHERES TO PURIFY DISTILLED SPIRITS
Yin Liang
Affiliated High School of South China Normal University Guangzhou China

A new type of nanomaterial called nanoceramic spheres has recently been invented for use in water purifying machines to purify distilled spirits. It is because water and ethanol are polar molecules and the main components of distilled spirits. <br><br> I bought eight different brands of distilled spirits in the form of wine from the supermarket. Half of each bottle of wine was added to the nanoceramic spheres as a sample solution, and the other half was left as normal. First, 24 adults from university are tasted the distilled spirits and found the tastes of it are better than it used to. Then after 24 and 240 hours, these solutions were measured by the Gas Chromatography Machine. <br><br> I found that a certain percentage of chemical ingredients had undergone changes. To prove the experimental results, solutions of 2-butanol, ethyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, ethyl hexanoic were added to the analog wine solution with alcohol£ºwater£½1£º1. It showed that a majority of each ingredient in the distilled spirit had visible changes. Using an SEM, a Dissolved Oxygen Measurement Controller£¬ and a Electronegative Ion Measurement Controlleras analytical instruments, I found the reason for the changes were the nanoceramic spheres were able to absorb and oxidate some chemical ingredients of distilled spirits. The organic chemical ingredients can be oxygenated to CO2 and H2O. <br><br> The nanoceramic spheres can purify the distilled spirits and improve their taste. The findings of this research can help provide new technology for the purification of distilled spirits.<br><br>

A NOVEL APPROACH IN PREPARATION OF DYE-SENSITIZED SOLAR CELL
Kyung-ha Lee
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland Oregon, United States

Dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is receiving much attention as a third-generation solar cell after bulk silicon and thin film solar cells, since it is discovered in 1991 by O’Regan and Gratzel. It offers the prospective of low cost fabrication and presents attractive features for answering future energy demands. The key in DSSC is the existence of a porous oxide layer composed of nanometer-sized dye particles which have been sintered at high temperature (designated here as conventional DSSC as opposed to a new approach made in this experiment). The conventional preparation of porous TiO2 for DSSC application has led to the need for new approaches for preparing porous TiO2 with simpler methods and higher efficiency. In this study, I attempted sputtering and etching process as a less expensive alternative to sintering process which has high energy requirement. The outcome of the attempt, however, led the experiment toward the improved performance of the conventional DSSC rather than reducing the production cost. The combination of sputtered TiO2 – ZnO film with the conventionally prepared TiO2 film boosted the performance of DSSC in the I-V characteristic curve compared to the conventional DSSC which were built without sputtered TiO2 – ZnO layer prepared in this experiment. And this result brought a conclusion that this combined new DSSC could be a highly promising alternative in solar cell technology.

A NOVEL CHLOROPHYLL-BASED NANOCRYSTALLINE PHOTOELECTROCHEMICAL CELL: A PROMISING APPROACH TO HYDROGEN PRODUCTION VIA THE LIGHT-DRIVEN REDOX OF SEAWATER
Nilesh Tripuraneni
Clovis West High School, Fresno, CA, U.S.A

Hydrogen, a clean-burning fuel, has the potential to replace fossil fuels as the worlds’ primary energy storage medium. Current hydrogen generation systems have been unable to attain an effective balance of cost and efficiency. My aim was to develop a novel photoelectrochemical cell to cheaply and more efficiently produce hydrogen. The cell design, electron transfer mechanism, was modeled after nature’s PS I and PS II photosystems. In fact chlorophyll, designed by nature to photo-oxidize water intracellularly, was utilized as the primary light harvesting and redox molecule. <br><br> To serve as the electron transfer and reduction mechanism I formulated a procedure to coat a transparent, heat-resistant ceramic composite with conductive SnO2 glass successfully lowering the resistance to 3-5 ohms. Subsequently a TiO2 colloid was fused to the conductive glass to create a nanostructured TiO2 matrix. This allowed a large surface area for chlorophyll adsorption and serve as a suitable structural anchor for the chlorophyll. An orange leaf-acetone extraction produced the chlorophyll which was adsorbed to the TiO2 films.<br><br> In order to determine the efficiency of the assembled photoelectrochemical cell, current and voltage were measure by the photoelectrolysis of seawater, in addition to capturing hydrogen gas via a self-built gas capture system. This was then coupled with free energy calculations and light intensity measurements. The chlorophyll-enhanced electrodes produced over 300 times the photovoltage of the controls. Thus I was able to demonstrate in a novel, self-constructed, photoelectrochemical cell (that mimics nature), that chlorophyll can be harnessed to photo-oxidize water for hydrogen production.<br><br>

VISCOSITY: TO FLOW OR NOT TO FLOW
Harrison Phu Nguyen
Detroit Catholic Central High School, Novi, MI, United States

The purpose of this experiment is to determine how the viscosity of various motor oils, including regular, semi-synthetic, and synthetic multi-viscosity oils, change with temperatures. I hypothesized that synthetic motor oil would be the least viscous and, therefore, the best quality.<br><br>One method of testing viscosity is to determine how much time it takes for a bead to reach the bottom of a test tube filled with motor oil. A long duration would signify a high viscosity and vice versa. I decided to use this means because it is efficient as well as facile. I used five test tubes (or graduated cylinders) which contained different types of motor oil. I performed the experiment three times on each oil at various temperatures between 0ºF and 200ºF. <br><br>After my experimentation, I concluded that the synthetic motor oil was the best quality for engines because its viscosity does not change as much as the other motor oils over a wide range of temperatures. Overall, the semi-synthetic and the regular 5W30 oils have similar viscosities, and as expected, the 20W50 regular oil is the most viscous at all tested temperatures, followed by the 10W40 regular oil. <br><br>The motor oil’s main functions are to reduce friction, protect against rust and corrosion, and cooling and lubricating engine parts. Thus, the viscosity of the oil plays a big role. An oil must be able to flow at cold temperatures to lubricate internal moving parts upon starting the engine. It must also remain viscous to protect an engine at high operating temperatures. This experiment provides a quick way for an educated motorist to determine if an advertised motor oil will make economic sense for his or her vehicle's need. <br><br><br><br>

THEORETICAL STUDIES ON RESEARCH OF UNIQUE BINDING SITE OF SBX
Eugene Lee
Stuyvesant High School, NYC, NY, United States of America

The annual incidence of newly diagnosed head and beck cancers, particularly squamous cell carcinoma, has been increasing in the United States. In Vitro studies of SBX, a component derived from a particular plant species (Scutellaria baicalensis), have shown promise as a potent anticancer agent. This study attempts to elucidate the mechanism by which SBX works by identifying a specific binding site on potential target proteins in the cell, as it is currently unknown and would be time-consuming and costly through biological testing. 20 proteins were analyzed for potential SBX binding sites with a novel docking protocol using ArgusLab, which employs 2 different docking engines. AKT/PKB, a protein in the cytoplasm involved in molecular signaling, showed that highest energy reading for SBX binding of 9 identified sites. In addition 7 sites appeared on proteins involved in a cellular pathway that leads to apoptosis. Further theoretical studies should be continued by involving more protein structures. Current data will be validated by testing it with mutation (addition or deletion of amino acids to the protein structures). Finally once all data is collected, biological testing on the most likely protein structure, AKT/PKB as in this case, should be conducted.

THE EFFECTS OF LIPID FAT CONTENT ON METHYL ESTER CLOUD POINT
Anna Patricia Perry
Elko High School, Elko, NV, USA

The goal of this experiment was to determine if the amounts and types of fats in lipids, or esters, affect the cloud point of the methyl esters, or biodiesel, derived from them. I predict that the cloud points of the methyl esters would reflect the proportions of different fatty acids in the lipid ester from which they were derived. Saturated fats in a lipid should produce methyl esters with the highest cloud points, followed (in order) by trans fats, monounsaturated fats, and polyunsaturated fats. This is because the saturated, trans, polyunsaturated, and monounsaturated fatty acids require different amounts of thermal energy to stay in liquid form due to their molecular geometries, whether they are in a triglyceride molecule or a methyl ester. To test this hypothesis, methyl esters were produced through transesterification from four lipids containing varying proportions of different fats: lard, which was highest in saturated fat; shortening, which was high in monounsaturated, trans, and saturated fats; canola oil, which was highest in monounsaturated fat; and soybean oil, which was highest in polyunsaturated fat. The cloud point of each methyl esters was then found. The lard ester had the highest, followed by the shortening ester, the canola ester, and the soy ester. These results supported my hypothesis because the proportions of different fats in the reacting esters were reflected by the relative cloud points of each methyl ester from which they were produced.

PEROXIDE POWER 5
Christine Kay Nelson
Laporte Public School, Laporte MN, U.S.A.

The first year of my project, I was looking for a catalyst that broke down hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into steam (water vapor) and oxygen. The second year, I took the catalysts that I had found (manganese dioxide and potassium permanganate) and I tried to make them easier to recover and I tried to create mechanical energy from the steam. The third year, I was able to determine and predict the amount of gas volume that the reaction created by using the universal gas law. Last year, I took a collision cart and mounted a bottle on the top to make a car that was propelled by steam. The problem I needed to overcome was making my catalyst recoverable. Without a recoverable catalyst I could no longer continue research on H2O2 propulsion because there wouldn’t be a way to control the reaction. In all of my testing manganese dioxide was used because its reaction is more potent than the potassium permanganate. Once the recoverable catalyst was achieved, I controlled the temperature of the reaction so that I could control the steam. By controlling the amount of steam I can control the amount of acceleration in the cart. I timed how long the temperature stayed between two specific degrees once the catalyst was removed. By using standard deviations, I can predict for what amount of time the temperature will stay at a specific degree once the catalyst has been removed. Therefore, the option of using a controllable H2O2 vehicle is feasible.

NATURAL DYE-SENSITIZED NANO-CRYSTALLINE TITANIUM OXIDE SOLAR CELL
Yongjie Hu
The Middle School of Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China

This project in its present form shows the results of the experiment in natural dye-sensitized nano-crystalline titanium oxide solar cell. The initial idea came from the general knowledge that green plants are the most excellent users of solar energy and so in some plants there exist pigments with especial photochemical properties. The main goal of the project was to discover and extract natural dyes suitable for sensitizer. <br><br> The pigment solutions were obtained by repeatedly extracting and filtrating, and their absorption at different frequency was measured with a UV-Vis (ultraviolet-visible) spectrophotometer. The prepared cell is composed of components including photo-oxidation electrode, counter electrode, separate film and electrolyte. Photo-oxidation electrode was the TiO2-coated conductive glass stained by the dye liquor. The counter electrode was prepared by electrochemical method in which platinum was deposited on the surface of the conductive glass by consuming anode in the primary cell. The electrolyte used in the cell is a solution containing triiodide-to-iodide. <br><br> The dyes extracted from purple radish and cabbage exhibit excellent sensitization. The open-circuit voltage of the model solar cell is up to 470 mV under clear weather condition in Lanzhou area in April. Purple cabbage dye is more sensitive to sunlight, and purple radish dye exhibits higher conversion of absorbed light.<br><br>A natural dye-sensitized nanocrystalline titanium oxide solar cell has been successfully made. It has some advantages such as high conversion efficiency, cleanness, easy assemblage and low cost. It is believed that this project exhibits potential value for the natural dye to be sensitizer.<br><br>

A CONCEPT OF REMOTE GROUP PARTICIPATION ILLUSTRATED BY GLYCOSYLATIONS WITH 6-CHLORO-6-DEOXY-GLUCOSYL DONORS
Andrey M. Tsedilin
Moscow Chemical Lyceum #1303, Moscow, Russia

This work is a part of the project aimed at the synthesis of modified oligosaccharides of the outer core region of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide. Here we describe an investigation of the influence of an acetyl group at O-3 in donors with glucoconfiguration bearing chlorine at C-6 on the stereoselectivity of glycosylation. Ethyl 2,3,4-tri-O-benzoyl-1-thio-beta-D-glucopyranoside 1 was chosen as a glycosyl acceptor as the ethylthio group in resulted disaccharides can be activated for the further synthesis of more complex oligosaccharides. The acceptor 1 was prepared in six steps from D-glucose. The fully benzylated 6-chloro-6-deoxy glucosyl donor 2, which contained recently introduced N-phenyl-trifluoroacetimidoyl leaving group, was synthesized in six steps from D-glucose via methyl 6-chloro-6-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranoside. Within the synthesis, a method for cleavage of the anomeric methyl group in methyl 2,3,4-tri- O - benzyl - 6-chloro - 6 - deoxy - alpha-D-glucopyranoside was developed. Fully benzylated methyl 6-chloro-6-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranoside 3 was applied for the synthesis of O-(3-O-acetyl-2,4-di-O-benzyl-6-chloro-6-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-N- pheny -2,2,2-trifluoroacetimidate 4. The key step was regioselective deblocking of 3-OH in 3. Glycosyaltions of 1 with donors 2 and 4 were carried out in the presence of TfOH as a promoter at room temperature. Glycosylation with donor 2 lead to a mixture of alpha- and beta- disaccharides in a ratio of 9:1, whereas the reaction of 4 gave almost pure alpha-isomer. Thus, the disaccharide fragments with alpha-Glc-(1 to 6)-beta-Glc backbone were synthesized and will be used for the preparation of the modified oligosaccharides from P.aeruginsa. The concept of remote anch imeric 1,3-participation of an acetyl protecting group was validated for 6-chloro-6-deoxy-glucosyl donors.

FORMATION OF THE PROTECTIVE AND MULTIFUNCTIONAL LAYERS ON THE SURFACE OF NITINOL AND TITANIUM ALLOYS FOR MEDICINE
Andrey S. Gnedenkov
Pedagogical Gymnasium at FESTU, Vladivostok, Russia 

The titanium implants are applied in the bone surgery. The alloy of titanium (50÷60%) and nickel (40÷50%) named nitinol due to its uncial shape memory effect is exploited for preparation of the special clips e.g. in the stomach surgical operation. But using the abovementioned materials could be much wider if on the surface of them there would be layers possessing anticorrosion, biological inert or biological active properties. The diffusion of Ni from nitinol in the human tissue may cause the cancer of them. Therefore, the protective coatings on the surface are necessary for improving the nitinol exploitation as well as using the titanium alloys. The plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) method of processing the titanium alloys and nitinol permits to form on their surface the layers which can be useful for implant surgery. Those layers possessed some porosity which can be used as container for drugs (e.g. antibiotic, calcium hydroxylappatite or another phosphate-containing substances) or polymer materials which provide the best implant acceptability). The used polymer seals the pores and therefore decreases the diffusion of the medicine from surface layer. It prolongs a therapeutic effect for a long time. Moreover, these anticorrosion protective coatings significantly reduce the extraction of nickel from nitinol and its accumulation in the human tissues.<br><br>A quality and protective properties of obtained coatings were estimated by impedance spectroscopy and potentiodynamic polarization methods. The morphology of surface was analyzed by scanning electron and force electron microscopy. Some mechanically characteristics (hardness, Yung's module) were estimated with application of Dynamic Ultra Micro Hardness Tester DUH-W201.

Thus, electrochemical oxidation of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-one in ethanol in an undivided cell in the presence of sodium iodide- sodium ethoxide system leads to ethyl 2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidine-3=carboxylate in 65% substance yield via electrochemically induced Favorskii rearrangement.<br><br><br>The process found are facile, pure and economical methods for the electrochemical direct “one-pot” oxidative transformation of piperidin-4-ones into á-hydroxyketals, pyrrolidine- and 2,5-dihydropyrrole carboxylates. The general procedure utilizes inexpensive regents, simple equipment and undivided cell, it is easily carried out and the work is not complicated. The á-hydroxyketals, tetramethyl substituted pyrrolidine- and 2,5-dihydropyrrole carboxylates thus obtained are convenient intermediates for the synthesis of the pharmacologically active aminoxyle radicals and benzamide derivatives with piperidine cycle.<br><br>

The purpose of this experiment is to test the effect of a corrosive agent on copper protected with a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of hexadecanethiol. The design tested SAMs on pure copper, iron plated with copper, and pre-corroded copper-plated iron.<br><br> Samples were coated with Hexadecanethiol, forming SAMs. Samples were viewed on an optical microscope and with a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) with an Electron Dispersion X-Ray (EDX) attachment to determine elemental composition. Surface roughness was tested with a surface profilometer. One set of samples was coated with a SAM and exposed to the ambient environment for two weeks and then immersed in a salt water bath for two days, while the second set was coated and placed directly into salt water. A third set was left unprotected to corrode in salt water and a fourth control set was placed in de-ionized water for two days.<br><br> The metals were re-viewed with the optical microscope and SEM and retested with the EDX to determine if corrosion had occurred; surface roughness was re-tested with the profilometer. It was determined that the SAMs on the two week samples deteriorated, but the substrate did not corrode, whereas the fresh SAMs did not deteriorate. However, SAMs did not adequately protect the plated iron or pre-corroded samples.<br><br> The results of this experiment show that self assembled monolayers are resistant to corrosive environments and may become important in technological applications.<br><br>

OIL EXTRACTION FROM WILD PLANT SEEDS
Hannah Lloyd
Ogden High School, Ogden, UT

Biodiesel from plant oils is a possible renewable energy source. Wild plants that thrive naturally may provide significant amounts of alternative fuels. In this project, oil was extracted from common sunflowers, gumweed, acorn, and Russian olives because they are abundant in dry areas of Northern Utah, and some of the domestic varieties are used as commercial sources of oil. Canola and domestic sunflower oils were analyzed for comparison with wild seed oils. Oil was extracted from dried, fragmented seeds in a Soxhlet extractor with petroleum ether. After distilling out solvent, the oils were transesterified with methanol and sodium methoxide. Each crude product was vacuum distilled to obtain pure methyl esters, which were then analyzed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Gumweed transesterification product would not distill and could not be analyzed as above. Average mass spectra were taken for each major peak from the total ion chromatogram. Oils were found in all the plants tested. The common and domestic sunflowers contained about the same amount of oil which had similar compositions. Acorns and gumweed had moderate amounts of oil, and Russian olives had a smaller amount. Palmitate was a common component in the oils. Stearate was found in both varieties of sunflowers, and oleate was found in the acorn oil. This project demonstrates that wild plants yield significant amounts of various oils.

SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF A CO-FACIAL ZN-PORPHYRIN DIMER WITH BIS-FULLERENE ADDUCTS
Orlando Grajo DeLeon
Charles E. Gorton HS, Yonkers, NY, USA

Systems that utilize flexible, covalent linkages between electron donor and acceptor structures allow for rapid forward electron transfer, mimicking a critical step of the natural photosynthetic process. Flexible linkages, however, tend to result in a fast electron back transfer, due to the ability of the covalent linker to reduce distances between the donor and acceptor components. We report the synthesis of a novel face-to-face system incorporating zinc-porphyrin (donor) and fullerene (acceptor) moieties. This design differs from previously reported face-to-face porphyrin systems due to the presence of two fullerenes. This architecture should allow for an increase in the retardation of the back-electron transfer, a major weakness of current flexible covalently linked electron donor-acceptor models.

<br><br>The materials in pea flour will be toxic against stored grain pests and the containers that contain no pea flour will have less mortality.<br><br>The first step was to have the whole peas grounded into a fine powder. Pea Flour was weighed on an electronic scale to exactly 0.1g, 0.15g, 0.7g and then added to 100 grams of wheat each in glass container.25 red flour beetles were then added to each container. Also controls were prepared with no pea protein .At 7-day intervals, for four weeks I would sieve the wheat, and its contents, into a glass pan so I could count how many beetles have survived and died.<br><br> 70% to 90% mortality was noted in the red flour beetles exposed to pea flour compared to 2 and 3 deaths in the controls. After three weeks the number of red flour beetles in the control increased by 4 and 6 (two controls were prepared). The experiments in which pea flour had been added reproductively did not take place.<br><br>I have concluded that pea flour is an effective way to kill the red flour beetles. Pea flour can also affect the reproductive system. I prepared certain other experiments which show the migration of insects from the wheat which contains pea flour. I studied the ingredient in peas which is repellent to the red flour beetles. These are the allelochemicals. I studied the mode of these allelochemcials and carried out certain experiments which show the mode of these chemicals.<br><br>

A STUDY INVOLVING THE SYNTHESIS OF CARBON NANOTUBE FILTERS IN THE MACROSCALE WITH EXPERIMENTS CONCERNING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF METAL-DERIVED CATALYSTS: A CONTINUATION
Jennifer Lee Nagel
Dekalb High School, Waterloo, IN USA

Hollow, radially-aligned carbon nanotube deposits, formulated in the previous year’s research were developed into a filtration device by capping one end of the nanotube with aluminum and then suspending the capped nanotube in an aluminum chamber. A funnel-shaped piece of aluminum was attached to the other end of the nanotube to prevent spillage or contamination of the filtered substance. The nanotube deposits varied in length from approximately 1 cm to 5 cm, with an outside diameter up to about 2 cm, having a wall thickness of several hundred microns.<br><br> Solutions of copper hydroxide were formulated from 1000ppm and 8000ppm solutions of copper sulfate solutions. The copper hydroxide was filtered through the assembled nanotube device and removed. The remaining solution was treated with concentrated ammonia to create [Cu(NH3)4]2+, which was then neutralized with hydrochloric acid. The Cu2+ ion was then quantified through use of atomic absorption spectra. In all experiments, at least 98% of the copper hydroxide was removed, demonstrating the effectiveness of the filter, although defects in the structure exist. These defects were observed through analysis with a TEM, and included cracks in the nanotube wall and amorphous carbon on the nanotube surface. Various catalysts systems may have the potential to remove these defects. <br><br>

SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF BIODIESEL
Shruthi Baskaran
Kennewick High School, Kennewick, Washington, USA

The purpose of this project was to determine whether a particular type of oil (soybean, rapeseed, corn or vegetable) was best to use in the production of biodiesel. The project looked at combustibility, soot formation, soot characteristics, and cold flow properties of biodiesels, and tried to correlate the experimental observations to biodiesel chemistry. <br><br>The composition and structure of the biodiesels was analyzed with a gas chromatograph and a mass spectrometer. The soot was analyzed using a scanning electron microscope. The cold flow properties were studied by measuring the viscosity. <br><br>The experiments confirmed that it was more difficult to produce soot from biodiesel when compared to regular diesel. Biodiesel contains oxygen and therefore causes less soot during combustion. Also, there was very little variation in the size of the soot particles from different fuels, although some of the soot from biodiesel appeared to have a glue-like consistency. <br><br>Compared to other biodiesels, rapeseed biodiesel contained less number of double bonds in the carbon chains of the molecular structure. The degree of “unsaturation” or presence of double bonds has been linked to easier soot formation. The rapeseed biodiesel also developed a white precipitate upon freezing and thawing, but the precipitate redissolved with time and increasing temperature. This behavior upon melting at low temperatures could be related to the molecular structure, and could affect cold flow performance in engines. <br><br>

USING COMMON PURIFICATION TECHNIQUES, CAN HAZARDOUS CONTAMINANTS BE EFFECTIVELY DECREASED
Mark Anthony Menn
S.S. Murphy High School, Mobile Alabama, USA

This experiment was conducted to effectively determine the quality of water from collected water samples. A total of five water samples were taken from: a local swimming lake, a pond located near a cow pasture, underneath a bridge across from a ship building yard, a local river, and tap water. <br><br> The tap water was set as the control and all the results taken from the various types of testing were compared to it. The areas that were believed to contain a high amount of contaminants did test in favor of the suspected belief.<br><br> This project was also beneficial in determining that pollution is directly related to the contamination of water. It was proved that by imploring boiling and flitration methods, the amount of bacteria did in fact decrease by using these methods of purification of water. Although the boiling method was much more effective, the filter did help decrease the overall bacteria, which is more beneficial than consuming the water straight from the source.<br><br> In conclusion of this experiment, my hypothesis was proved to be correct. All the natural water sources did contain an alarming amount of Coliform bacteria excluding the tap water. Since this specific type of bacteria denatures very rapidly, when placed in a condition that does not house optimal conditions, the boiling method did prove to be more effective in elimination just about all traces of the Eschericheria coli bacteria. This experiment was successful and all results supported the hypothesis.

DEVELOPMENT OF AN IMPROVED OXYGEN SENSOR: INCORPORATING A TRIS-BIPYRIDYL RUTHENIUM(II) DYE INTO A SUB-WAVELENGTH OPTICAL CAVITY
Jasmine M. Gregory
Harding University High School, Charlotte, NC, USA

The purpose in doing this research was to enhance photo-chemical and photo-physical processes through optical cavity design. I hypothesized that optical cavity design will inhibit the flourescence rate for sub-wavelength spheres doped in ruthenium dye. This will make flourescence via oxygen more competitve. The result will be a more sensitive oxygen sensor than currently available. For a proof of concept demonstration, the making of an improved oxygen sensor was attempted. Various processes such as doping, refractive index measurements, and spectroscopy were used in this experiment to support the hypothesis. Doping was used to attach ruthenium dye to the silicas spheres. The refrective index measured the speed of light in a vacuum divided by the speed of light in a particular material. Spectroscopy was used to study the way the sample absorbed light(UV-Vis Spectrophotometer), emitted light (fluorescence spectrometer) as well as the rate at which it emitted light (fluorescence lifetime spectrometer). The fluorescence decay curve of the first generation of spheres was nonlinear which sugested a non-uniform system. The fluorescence deacy curve of the second generation of spheres was linear suggesting a more uniform system. In conclusion, the lifetime data supported the hypothesis that doping them in ruthenium dye can control the lifetime of sub-wavelength spheres.

A NOVEL MEDICINAL METABOLITE FROM EXTREMOPHILIC TRICHODERMA VIRENS FOUND IN THE SILVER BOW CREEK SYSTEM
Kels Gordon Phelps
Butte High School, Butte, MT, U.S.A

The purpose of this project was to determine the medicinal potential of extremophilic microbes found in the Silver Bow Creek System and isolate compounds with medicinal potential.<br><br> First, I ran a flash silica column on a CHCl3 extract of Bacillus pumilus. I then partitioned a freeze-dried extract of Neurospora crassa using a CHCl3/H2O emulsion. The upper phase was separated using an LH-20 MeOH size exclusion column and the lower phase was separated using an LH-20 1:1 CHCl3:MeOH column.<br><br> I then cultured Trichoderma virens (8x500mL in mycological broth) and killed it with 50mL MeOH. Following the culture, I removed the killed mycelia. I extracted the filtrate three times in chloroform. I then ran an LH-20 methanol crude size exclusion column on the chloroform extract. The resulting fractions were generally active in inhibiting cysteinyl aspartate-specific protease 1 and Matrix metalloproteinase 3. One fraction was particularly active and a 1H nuclear magnetic resonance experiment indicated reasonable purity.<br><br> I proceeded to use nuclear magnetic resonance, Heteronuclear Single Quantum Correlation, Heteronuclear Multiple Bond Correlation and mass spectrometry to elucidate the structure. I proposed a working structure which nearly fit the spectroscopic data obtained. My mentor proceeded to actually solve the structure. The compound has not been reported in the literature, and may be effective in containing cancerous tumors or treating inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, Huntington’s disease and multiple sclerosis.<br><br> This project resulted in the discovery of a secondary metabolite, characterized as a novel benzofuran with medicinal potential.<br><br>

FABRICATION AND STABILIZATION OF BIOCOMPATIBLE SILVER NANOPARTICLES FOR POTENTIAL TUMOR-IMAGING APPLICATIONS
Swathi Bhaskaran
David H. Hickman High School, Columbia MO, USA

Silver nanoparticles have become the corner stone of nanoscience and nanomedicine, obviously because of the many benefits their use entails. However, technologies that produce and stabilize these nanoparticles under mild, non-toxic, renewable, and economically feasible conditions are still lacking. The following research project is designed to develop a protocol to synthesize silver nanoparticles under “green chemistry” conditions. The technique requires reacting a silver salt with a phosphene amino, in which case, silver nanoparticles can be produced at room temperature, in short periods of time, at high conversion rates, and without the need for environmentally unfriendly reactants. The overall goal following the synthesis of silver nanoparticles is to be able to direct each of these nanoparticles to tumor sites by way of tumor-loving biomolecules that can act as delivery vehicles. The silver nanoparticles, once part of the tumor, can induce contrast, making the malignant lesions visible in conventional imaging techniques. These silver nanoparticles have been stabilized in a gelatin matrix both to prevent nanoparticle aggregation and to keep the nanoparticles circulating in the blood pool for a long period of time. This novel production technique further yields a tightly defined particle size distribution and is particularly well suited to both in-vitro and in-vivo practice.

SOAP MANUFACTURE FROM THE REGION'S NATIVE VEGETAL OILS AND FRYING OIL
Camilla Serra Souza
Complexo Educacional Dom Bosco, Imperatriz, Maranhao, Brazil

The soap manufacture comes from the principle of reusing, giving new use to frying oils. You can also point out the use of the abundant region’s oil, like the babaçu’s oil, not destroying or devastating the nature. Thus came a series of tests that allowed the analysis of the most indicated oil to produce soap as the caustic soda water. The analysis of the caustic soda water was essential to the improvement of the produced soap, helping to get it perfect and leaving behind soft conclusions. First, I followed the basic principle that boiling caustic soda water with some kind of fat produces soap. From the chemistry point of view, what happens in the soap is a reaction between the grase acid esther contained in the oil and the sodium hidroxe (comercially called “caustic soda water”). This reaction is named “saponification” and it is a kind of organic reaction: ESTHER+BASE forming GRASE ACID SALT (SOAP) + GLICEROL (GLICERINE). The soap production can be adjusted using recipies. The soap, being a substance with a polar head and nonpolar tail molecule, propiciates the take off the fat dirt from some pan or even from a clothe, once that the nonpolar part of the soap will be attracted with itself making the miscible parts where the fat is lodged. Threfore, the fat will be miscible with the nonpolar art, whereas the water will be misible with the polar part, due to both of them be polar. This way, the soap doesn’t dissolve or disarrange the fat, but reduces the fat so that the water is able to drag it away.

DATE RAPE DRUGS: CAN THEY BE DETECTED
Anne Marie Larissa Child
Westdale Secondary School, Hamilton Ontario Canada

The purpose of my experiments was to determine how well commercially-available test kits detect the date rape drug, gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) in a variety of popular beverages. I synthesized GHB from gamma-butyrolactone in a supervised lab setting and used the synthetic material to evaluate the kits.<br><br> Both “Drink Safe” and “Drink Detective” test kits gave a positive response with synthetic GHB. The starting materials, including butyrolactone, did not.<br><br> Eleven popular drinks were prepared and spiked with GHB using typical dose levels. Each spiked drink along with an unspiked control was applied to the test cards. When the test kits were used according to the manufacturer’s instructions, only 5 of the 11 GHB-spiked drinks gave a convincing positive reaction. Two of the spiked drinks gave no response. The lack of response did not correlate with colour or pH. I observed, however, that if the control drink colour was used as a reference point, GHB could be detected in all cases.<br><br> When GHB solution was added to cranberry-based beverages, I observed that the drink itself changed colour, providing a potentially useful indicator of adulteration. <br><br> This research suggests several new ways in which women can protect themselves against drug-induced rape. These include being alert to colour changes in cranberry-based drinks, and when using test kits, preparing a valid reference point by testing a sample of an unadulterated drink on one side of the card. <br><br>

SYNTHESIS AND CATALYTIC CHARACTERIZATION OF SIZE AND SHAPE SELECTED METAL NANOPARTICLES (PHASE II)
Grady Clark Slane
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, Fl, USA

Metal clusters <10nm display unusual electronic, chemical and optical properties. Chemically inactive metals such as gold start to display enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity. This cannot be fundamentally explained although it is believed that these unique properties are relative to the size, shape, and support of the metal nanoparticles. The goal of this project is to analyze the physical and chemical properties of metal nanoparticles and their supports, and to develop a system for supported, size-controlled nanoparticles representative of real world catalysts. The hypothesis of this research supports the longstanding theory that this selectivity found in metal nanoparticles is related to the nanoparticle size, shape and nanoparticle interactions. <br><br> This research involves producing a series of metal nanoparticle samples using organic encapsulation. Nanoparticles self assemble in a polymeric solution within inverse micelles in controlled sizes and distributions. SiO2 substrates are dip coated in the solution and morphological characterization is performed on the substrates using AFM. Subsequently, the nanoparticle solutions are mixed with TiO2 and the solvent is evaporated to create a powder nanocatalyst that can be used as an industrial catalyst. Chemical characterization of these metal oxide supported nanocatalysts is then performed in a high pressure reaction chamber for catalytic characterization under “real world” conditions. TiO2 supported Au nanoparticles have shown catalytic properties suitable for CO oxidation. These properties could change in accordance to nanoparticle size and shape. Additionally, TiO2 supported Ir nanoparticles have shown catalytic properties suitable for the decomposition of methanol.

THE APPLICATION OF GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY IN DETECTING WASHED CHECKS
Matthew Wayne Brown
Roanoke Valley Governor's School, Roanoke, Virginia, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine if one could detect whether a check had been chemically erased by detecting ink residues in areas on the check where no ink should be present. It was hypothesized that if a check was soaked in a solvent in order to remove the ink on the check, that some of the ink would diffuse into the rest of the check paper, leaving a small but detectable amount of ink. In order to test for this, paper samples were taken from checks that had been washed and they were exposed to more solvents in an effort to remove any remaining ink. The first step of the experiment was to write out forty checks using a Bic Roundstic pen and another forty using a Bic Atlantis 1.2 pen. Then, each group of checks was soaked in 50 mL of either acetone or denatured alcohol for ten minutes. Some of these checks were rinsed for five seconds in water while some were allowed to dry directly after soaking in preparation for the next step. After all of the checks had dried, paper samples were extracted from six areas on the check where writing would not normally be found. These samples were soaked in 1mL of a solution containing 50% acetone and 50% denatured alcohol. The resulting solution was placed through the gas chromatograph and analyzed. The data has indicated that regardless of rinsing or the type of solvent used, there may still be enough ink in the check paper to be detected. In finding such traces, the experiment has proven to be a reliable means of determining if a check has been chemically altered.

THE EFFECTS OF WEATHERING AND SUBSTRATE PREPARATION ON COATING INTEGRITY AND ADHESION
Jameson Keith Hackbarth
Hightower High School, Missouri City Texas, United States

Thirty-six coated carbon steel plates were prepared with four different types of surface preparation methods (abrasive blast, sandpaper, wire brush, and a rusted surface as control) and placed in an accelerated weathering device to determine the ability for a coating to weather effectively and retain its adhesion strength. Adhesion strength and an analysis of the coating appearance were compared before and after weathering in order to establish a level of coating failure. Coating failure takes place when the coating is unable to form secondary valence bonds with iron atoms in the substrate, primarily due to a passive layer of rust or contaminant such as oil. Munger, in 1997, established that these secondary bonds will be more numerous and greater in strength if the chemically passive layer of rust is removed to expose fresh un-bonded metal reactive sites of iron.<br><br>The abrasive blasting method produced the greatest surface profile and increased the overall surface area of the substrate, thereby increasing the number of exposed metal reactive sites and having a the highest degree of mechanical adhesion. Greater adhesion corresponds with increased weatherability in that a coating that clings tighter to a surface will prevent osmotic blistering and undercutting from taking place.

DNA ELECTROPHORESIS ON NANOPORE-SIZED POLYETHERSULFONE MEMBRANE SURFACES
Michael Ding
Glen Cove High School, Glen Cove, NY, USA

Electrophoresis has previously been used for DNA separation on conductive and semi-conductive surfaces. DNA – surface chemical interactions are believed to be the main factor affecting separation. Therefore a novel approach using organic polymer-based nanopore-sized membranes for surface electrophoresis was studied. To understand the dynamics of DNA motion across a flat surface under the influence of an electric field, an in situ analysis of movements of DNA fragments was performed. <br><br> A drop of lambda MonoCut DNA solution was deposited on the membrane surface, forming a ring upon drying. Mobility of DNA fractions was measured using fluorescence microscopy. The separation was optimized by varying TBE buffer concentrations from 10^-3 to 10^-1X, DNA concentrations from 5ug/ml to 50ug/ml and electric fields from 3 to 7 V/cm.<br><br> The migration of YOYO-labeled lambda MonoCut DNA was examined using laser scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy. DNA molecules exiting deposited droplets were imaged on different surfaces, such as polyethersulfone membranes and Indium Tin Oxide surfaces. <br><br> Two significant new findings were obtained in this study. First, low cost disposable nanopore-sized PES membranes were shown to be promising surfaces for DNA electrophoresis. This opens a whole new arena for DNA separations since surface chemical treatments of membranes are viable. Second, well-defined circular DNA droplets on surfaces were obtained and DNA bands being pulled from the inner/outer ring by the electric field were visually observed in situ. This helps the understanding of adsorption/desorption mechanisms. <br><br>

GRASS AS FUEL FINDING THE ENERGY OF GRASS
Jeff Kevin Bean
American Fork High School, American Fork, Utah, United States

Each year millions of tons of grass clippings end up in landfills. My experiment was to measure the energy that could be extracted from this biomass resource.<br><br>Two varieties of grass were grown to provide our biomass. The varieties chosen were types common in the area I live.<br><br>A calorimeter was not accessible so one was constructed. A design was drawn in which an insulated outer box held a specific amount of water. Inside the water was a combustion chamber made from an electrical heating coil inside a small paint can. The coil was designed to ignite and hold the burning grass. A current flowing through the coil triggered the combustion. A stirring rod was made with a small fan and a wooden dowel. This helped the water to heat uniformly. The entire system was carefully insulated from the environment.<br><br> <br><br>When running the experiment a temperature probe was inserted in the system and connected to graphing software on a computer. The initial and final temperatures were used in the equation Q = mcÄt. This gave the total system energy increase in joules. The control run energy was subtracted from this value, and the new value was then divided by the mass of grass. From this data, a value in kJ/g was obtained.<br><br>It was found that tall fescue grass releases 12.9 kJ/g of energy and Kentucky blue grass releases 10.6 kJ/g. Estimating an average lawn size and number mowings about 4000 kJ per lawn could be extracted year.<br><br>

NON-FLUID GEL ELECTROLYTE MANUFACTURING OF BORON MINERALS AND OPTIMIZATION OF GELATION CONDITIONS
Ayse Zehra Karakoc
Izmir Fatih Private Science High School, IZMIR-TURKEY

Turkey has almost 65% of the world’s boron reserves. Although this is a great amount, boron hasn’t been well processed and not valued. Turkey’s marketing share among the world countries is 28%. Obviously this amount is less than expected so that new areas are needed for use of boron and its products. Presently the electrolytes used in accumulators and batteries function in narrow pH ranges cause environmental pollution and cannot motivate electrode reactions properly. <br><br> Sodium triborate as amorph is used as gel electrolyte in this project. Solutions of sodium triborate in different concentrations are prepared. Three groups are formed from the solutions. The first group is put into an oven at 50 degrees centigrade, the second group at 70 degrees centigrade and the third group at 80 degrees centigrade. The temperatures and the conductivities of the solutions are measured every hour. Also the pH of the electrolyte with the best conductivity is determined. Then, the the results are evaluated. <br><br> It is observed that gelation occurs at temperatures between 55-70 degrees centigrade in 5.00-8.00 molar solutions. The best conductivity value is observed at 70 degrees centigrade, in 5.70M electrolyte. The best conductivity is measured as 21.60 mS/cm, when the pH is 9.14. <br><br>The gel electrolyte can be reused and doesn’t pollute environment. It can function in wide pH ranges and has constant conductivity and potential. All these qualifications prove the advantages of boron gel electrolyte.<br><br>

CHEMICAL BIOREMEDIATION FOR DEGRADATION OF PETROLEUM DERIVATES USING LIVE MICROORGANISM IN CONTAMINATED WATER AND SOIL
Juan Andres Rivera
Elvira M. Colon Negron, Santa Isabel, PUERTO RICO

Petroleum spills in water and soil are a problem. Some microorganisms in nature can decompose hydrocarbons; but they are found in small quantities. In this research the hypothesis tested was that the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the fungi Penicillium chrysogenium, Trichoderma sp., Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger can degrade the petroleum derivates present in different aquatic media and soil The affected area can be improved using bioremediation; by adding microorganisms and stimulating their growth, to increase the amount of them. Different petroleum derivates were used to simulate a petroleum spill in water and soil from different sources. Water samples of 15 mL. each were placed in test tubes and 12 drops of a petroleum derivate were added. Then 3 mL. of Trypticase soy broth were added followed by 0.1 mL. of a fertilizer (for bacteria or for fungi). The sample was observed for five days. This procedure was repeated for each of the different water and soil samples, using each of the seven petroleum derivates for each of the five microorganisms using each of the five fertilizers. The effectiveness of bioremediation using Pseudomonas aeruginosa and each of the four fungi on the different petroleum derivates was excellent. The use of commercial fertilizers with different concentrations of nitrogen (25-10-17 and 20-20-20) accelerated the bacteria growth rate; and also the degradation of all petroleum derivates. When using high potassium content fertilizers (12-55-6, 15-50-5, and 10-30-20) the fungi growth rate was accelerated and all petroleum derivates in water and soil were also degraded. <br><br>

THE PRESERVATIVE EFFECTS OF VARIOUS SACCHARIDES ON ROSA HYBRIDA
Allison Marie Lange
Noblesville High School, Noblesville, Indiana, United States

The purpose of this project was to extend vase life for cut roses and to isolate the most beneficial carbohydrates in rose preservation. Cut plants require an acidifier, a biocide, and a carbohydrate for preservation, with the form of carbohydrate affecting flower appearance significantly. It was hypothesized that natural sugars would preserve flowers longer than synthetic sugars. Twelve variables and one control were prepared. Each variable included a form of sugar and the same concentration of bleach as a biocide. Each variable was slightly acidic or neutral. Three red roses were placed in each variable.<br><br>Roses were rated objectively by measuring the bloom diameter, beginning on day three. Subjective rating began on day eight and roses were rated on the appearance of the petals, head, leaves, and the overall color. Rating ended on day eleven when the majority of roses were unattractive. A second trial was held in order to corroborate the results. A control and the five most effective solutions from the first trial were tested, in addition to a new variable. The same procedure was followed for the second trial.<br><br>On considering both trials, it was concluded that natural sugars preserve flowers longer than synthetic sugars. Flowers in natural sugars were more attractive than the control group, while synthetic sugars performed worse than the control flowers. Because the three variables that preserved the flowers for the longest period of time all contained high fructose corn syrup, it was concluded that this form of sugar was preferred by roses.<br><br>

Marian High School, Mishawaka, Indiana, United States

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) measures the enthalpy, entropy, binding affinity, free energy, and the stoichiometric coefficient of thermodynamic, biomolecular interactions. These data are used in numerous scientific fields, and especially to design/optimize drugs; thus making ITC an integral element of current scientific research. When running an ITC experiment, there are many parameters to which the instrument can be set. The primary focus of this project involves the relatively undefined, and thus arbitrarily assigned “Reference Power” parameter and its effect on the thermodynamic quantities produced by ITC. The ITC manual itself fails to define the reference power, maintains little to no guidelines for choosing the degree of this variable, and suggests an arbitrary assignment of the variable. Consequently, users are lulled into the common misconception that reference power does not affect the ITC data. This project was based on the hypothesis that reference power does have a significant affect on all thermodynamic data produced by ITC. Using the 1:1 complexation reaction of BaCl2 titrated into 18-crown-6 ether under varying “reference powers,” the initial hypothesis was supported. The results conclusively show that the differing reference powers produce dissimilar thermodynamic results in all circumstances. The consequences of this finding are significant due to the rapidly increasing use of ITC in numerous fields of research, and the conclusions of this project must serve as a basis for change in the ITC technique and its relation to thermochemisty and all associated fields lest the community continue to receive erroneous data. <br><br>

BIOFUELS: GASOLINE VS. ETHANOL
Azurae Kayla Johnson
Cookeville High School, Cookeville, TN, U.S.

The purpose of this project was to determine which fuel was more exothermic: gasoline or ethanol. The exothermic properties of 89 octane gasoline and ethanol were calculated by constructing an open constant-pressure calorimeter; however, due to safety measures involving the explosive nature of the two fuels, this system was unable to capture all the heat produced. This experiment was conducted under a safety ventilation hood, and all observers utilized protective eyewear.<br><br> One 200 mL beaker was filled with 100 mL of water. Maintaining the volume of water at 100 mL, the water was adjusted to 21.1 degrees Celsius. 1 mL of 89 octane gasoline was poured inside a 40 mL glass beaker. Normalizing densities were not adjusted, since gasoline is a complex mixture of hydro-carbons. Then, the 40 mL beaker was placed into the 200 mL beaker containing 100 mL of water. A thin wooden stick was ignited and placed above the surface of the gasoline into the 40 mL beaker. Allowing for the reaction to conclude, the 40 mL beaker was removed. A thermometer was inserted below the surface of the water in the 200 mL beaker and the data was recorded. This procedure was repeated five times for gasoline and duplicated for testing ethanol.<br><br> The data illustrated that ethanol produced an average increase of 9.58 degrees Celsius, whereas gasoline produced an average increase of 2 degrees Celsius. The data set revealed that ethanol produced an average of 7.58 degrees Celsius more captured heat energy than gasoline.<br><br>

THE ELIMINATION OF VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS THROUGH THE USE OF POLYETHYLENEIMINE NANOFIBERS
James Zhen Wang
Hoover High School, North Canton, OH, USA

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as formaldehyde found in secondhand smoke, automobile exhaust, and building materials pose a continuing threat to society. These VOCs are known to cause cancer, asthma, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and various other medical issues. Polyethyleneimine (PEI) nanofiber filters were created and tested in a controlled formaldehyde environment and the reductions in VOC levels were noted. PEI is a polymer known to contain multiple amine functional groups that chemically bind the aldehyde functional group. It was hypothesized that PEI nanofibers would be exceptionally effective in the elimination of VOCs such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde because of the nanofiber’s large surface area to volume ratio. This would provide ample contact area to eliminate these substances. PEI nanofibers were created through a process called electrospinning and were applied to an aluminum mesh for structural support. These filters were then placed in a controlled formaldehyde environment and measurements were taken to find the average level of formaldehyde in each container. Phase one test results showed an average reduction of 42% in formaldehyde levels in the stagnant environment. Phase two included an active airflow environment that better represented realistic operating conditions. With constant flowing air, a 15.40% reduction per cycle was seen. Statistical analysis was done with t-tests. The phase one results with an alpha of 95% found a t-value of 14.86 with the critical value being 2.02. Phase two results found a t-value of 14.19 with the critical value being 1.71, thus showing statistical significance for both parts.<br><br>

PHOTOCATALYTIC OXIDATION USING IMMOBILIZED TITANIUM DIOXIDE
Justin Yen
Arkansas School for Mathematics, Sciences, and the Arts; Hot Springs, AR, USA

Advanced Oxidation Process (AOP) is used often in industry today in order to treat contaminants in water. The AOP, essentially, utilizes the hydroxyl radical as a reducing agent in chemical reactions to reduce contaminants in water supplies. The purpose of this experiment was to determine if titanium dioxide (TiO2) could be an effective photocatalyst in an AOP chemical reaction. TiO2 was chosen for this experiment because it is inexpensive, easy to obtain, and environmentally friendly. TiO2 was immobilized onto quartz slides using the sol-gel method which, essentially, is dipping a slide into a TiO2 solution several times and allowing drying time in between dips. A reactor was constructed in order to test the TiO2 films and their ability to reduce dye solutions made in order to simulate contaminants in water. Films were exposed to UV light in order to induce the photocatalytic reaction. Results supported the hypothesis that the TiO2 films would effectively treat the dye solution. In all of the trials, the concentration of the solution decreased to nearly half of the original concentration of the solution. Although research in the use of TiO2 as an AOP photocatalyst is relatively new, the success of this experiment supports the potential of using TiO2 in industrial water treatment, especially considering the fact that it is inexpensive, easy to obtain, and environmentally friendly.

A NOVEL TREATMENT TO INCREASE THE 'POP-ABILITY' OF ZEA MAYS EVERTA (POPCORN)
Kelsey Daly
Oak Grove High School, San Jose, California, USA

Cellulose plays an essential part in the 'pop-ability' of popcorn. During the poppping process the heat inside the kernel increases while cellulose rearranges itself and crystallizes, strengthening the pericap (outer layer of kernel), and letting the kernel act like a pressure cooker. Reseaerch indicated that cellulose was the key to the popping of the kernels, so this project investigated pretreatment of kernels with a cellulose suspention. More than 200 batches of popcorn (102 grams each)were weighed out and treated with 10ml of a 15%, 5%, 2% ,or 1% of a cellulose suspention or distilled water. After 25 minutes of presoaking, each batch of popcorn was popped using an air popper at 177 celsius. Each batch was analyzed to determine the number of unpopped kernels(old maids), and the number of kernels ejected from the air popper. Using descriptive statistics, the mean number of old maids and the percentage of old maids was determined. The results showed that it was not the water which caused fewer old maids, but the added cellulose. Addition of distilled water hindered popping and addition of cellulose solutions increased it.

METH BUSTERS: AN IN SITU TEST FOR DETERMINING METHAMPHETAMINE HISTORY IN HOMES
Jia Jennifer Wu
Arkansas School for Mathematics, Sciences, and the Arts, Hot Springs, AR, USA

Current laws do not require a landlord to disclose a house's history as a methamphetamine lab to tenants; tenants exposed to lingering toxins may experience psychosis and cardiovascular disease. The goal of this experiment was to develop an effective wall swab test for tenants. A further goal was to determine optimal testing wall material. It was hypothesized that these goals could be accomplished with filter paper, solutions of starch or silver nitrate, and common household chemicals. Phase I tested hydriodic acid, a byproduct unique to meth production. Twelve boards, 4 each of plywood, ProRoc, and ceiling board, were painted; another 12 were unpainted. All boards were then divided into quadrants, 3 of which had columns pipetted with a range of hydriodic acid concentrations. Each quadrant was sprayed with ammoniated glass cleaner, distilled water, or isopropyl alcohol. All squares were rubbed with filter paper; the paper was then pipetted with starch or silver nitrate solutions. Quadrant II was the control. A reference color chart and statistics of color intensity, range, and consistency were created. The indication of colors supported the hypothesis. Starch solutions of 2.00% and 4.00% indicated optimally with isopropyl alcohol. All silver nitrate solutions indicated optimally with glass cleaner. Silver nitrate showed levels of 0.001 M hydriodic acid, but starch had a greater range of colors. Unpainted walls provided better indication than painted, and unpainted plywood was the best material with silver nitrate and starch. Phase II will test a methamphetamine lab in conjunction with the Arkansas Crime Lab.

This project objective is to promote the beneficial and anticarcinogenic properties of the Rubus Ulmifolius Berry (Shott) for the human health, since it overcomes seventeen times the content of the Licopen on tomatoes. The tomato is the vegetable with more Licopen concentration known up to the moment, substance, that is found on vitamin A and give to fruits and vegetables its natural red color. <br><br> I first recollected bibliographical information on different medias, then I gathered some fruit and applied proper pigments separation techniques (thin layer chromatography, solid - liquid extraction, centrifugation, analysis results).<br><br> According to the information obtained, it is possible to say that the pigments seen on the tomatoes are also present in the Rubus ulmifolius berry (Shott).<br><br> The eluyents mixture with better results were dichloromethane-methanol in relation of 1:1 in both fruits.<br><br> According to literature, the Chloroform efficiently dissolves Licopen, reference that was experimentally proved and confirmed in both fruits, giving positive results appreciating a bigger amount of it in the berry.<br><br> These studies will help Chilean agriculture, improving the growth of the Rubus Ulmifolius Berry (Shott), projecting it into other markets.<br><br>

EUTECTIC POINT DETERMINATION OF BINARY MIXTURES FOR USE IN LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAYS
Rachel Amos
City of London School for Girls, Barbican, London, EC2Y 8BB, England

Liquid Crystal Display screens are rapidly replacing traditional ¡¥box¡¦ televisions; this technology utilises liquid crystal mixtures. The aim of this project was to find the eutectic point of binary mixtures of thermotropic liquid crystals. <br><br>In a binary mixture compounds will melt over a range of temperatures, except at the eutectic point. This is when the compounds are in a specific ratio resulting in a complete liquid phase. By finding this point, liquid crystal display screens can be developed that are stable over suitable temperature ranges. <br><br>Two sets of binary mixtures were prepared; Set 1 comprising of zinc porphyrins (disc shaped) (Zn-OAP-C2, Zn-OAP-C8, Zn-OAP-C12), Set 2 calamitic (rod shaped) liquid crystals (8-OCB, 8-CB, 7-OCB). Each set comprised of different mole ratios. The mixtures were analysed using Polarising Microscopy and Differential Scanning Calorimetery to determine the melting temperature. This data was combined to plot a phase diagram and hence the eutectic point. To compare the experimental data a theoretical phase diagram was also generated using Schroder van-Laar equation and Mathematica and hence the eutectic point. <br><br>The results showed the binary mixtures of Set 1 were immiscible in the liquid crystal phase, so no experimental eutectic points could be found. However, in Set 2 the theoretical and experimental results showed very close agreement. The eutectic point for the combination of 8-OCB and 8-CB was 13„aC which is, for practical purposes, close to room temperature. These results provide significant potential for the development of new liquid crystal combinations in a range of commercial applications. <br><br>

NANO ELECTROCHEMICAL SENSOR FABRICATION USING CONICAL CARBON NANOPIPETTES
Suhail Malhotra
duPont Manual Magent High School, Louisville, KY, United States

Normally, fabrication of nanoelectrode arrays (NEAs) involves several time consuming and costly steps. Thus the objective of this project was to develop a method which utilizes the tapered geometry of conical nanostructures called carbon nanopipettes (CNPs) to produce nanoelectrode ensembles (NEEs) that would significantly reduce the effort and expense needed to make an effective NEE. Additionally, the CNPs would increase the efficiency of the resulting NEE relative to that of the commonly used NEA of carbon nanotubes.<br><br>The hypothesis was supported when a method was developed to construct CNP NEEs. The spacing of the nano scale tips needed to prevent diffusion boundary layer overlap was achieved by dip coating the as-synthesized CNPs in polymer, which insulated their macro scale bases and left only their well spaced tips exposed. This was visually confirmed using Scanning Electron Microscopy and the nanoelectrode behavior was characterized using Cyclic Voltammetry. <br><br>There are numerous potential applications of this technology platform. The enabling technology can be deployed in ways not previously possible, including modifications to make highly sensitive electrochemical sensors which can be part of a “lab on a chip” and detect analytes on short time scales at rapid scan rates. Examples include the in vivo detection of biologically significant compounds. Some of these applications have been demonstrated such as the detection of dopamine, a neurotransmitter in the synapses. A more robust, alternative method and further enhancements in sensitivity of these electrodes are being developed.<br><br>

SYNTHESIS OF PERBENZOYLATED CARBOHYDRATES IN PREPARATION FOR ANTHOCYANIN PIGMENT CHARACTERIZATION
Brandon Timothy Lew
Breck School, Golden Valley, MN, USA

Short-chain carbohydrates, specifically mono and disaccharides, were perbenzoylated and characterized using NMR in preparation for characterizing anthocyanins. Anthocyanins are pigment molecules with anti-oxidative properties found in plants. Because of their color and anti-oxidant properties, anthocyanins have potential to be used as food additives. Identification of carbohydrates is important to the characterization of anthocyanins, since the attached carbohydrate molecules differentiate the anthocyanin molecules. The goal was to use perbenzoylation to derivatize carbohydrates in preparation for H1- and C13-NMR characterization. Perbenzoylation was chosen to depolarize and prevent the mutarotation of the carbohydrate groups.<br><br> In an initial protocol, carbohydrates were perbenzoylated in 100 °C pyridine with benzoyl chloride. Flash chromatography was run to isolate the desired products. In this initial procedure, the desired product was contaminated by benzoyl chloride and some disaccharides were selectively benzoylated. A second perbenzoylating protocol was developed, in which carbohydrates were added at room temperature to pyridine, benzoyl chloride, and chloroform. The solution was rotoevaporated, washed in ddH2O, and scanned using H1- and C13-NMR.<br><br> Results showed the second procedure was quicker and resulted in higher yields and purer products as shown by NMR. This protocol demonstrated that perbenzoylation is an effective technique to characterize carbohydrates.<br><br> The next step of this research will be to use perbenzoylation to identify the carbohydrate groups in order to characterize anthocyanins in various plants. Anthocyanins have potential as food additives that would color and preserve food while reducing anti-oxidant effects on the human body.

THE EFFECT OF VARIOUS ANTI-CORROSIVE METHODS ON THE CORROSION PROCESS OF IRON
Gina Ahyun Noh
Spring Valley High School, Columbia, SC, USA

Corrosion – a costly global problem – impacts iron noticeably, especially because of iron’s widespread industrial use. The purpose of this study is to determine which of five anticorrosive coatings (black oxide, alkyd resin, epoxy resin, phosphate conversion coating, cerium salt coating) is most effective in preventing rust; the phosphate conversion coating was hypothesized to be most effective. After materials were located, iron pieces were set aside in six groups of 30 pieces. Each piece was labeled and the masses were recorded. The black oxide group was put into the blacking solution and dipped into a sealant. The epoxy resin and alkyd resin groups were painted. The phosphate conversion coating and cerium salt groups were immersed in solutions for a certain amount of time (20 minutes and 30 minutes, respectively). Masses were taken after coatings were applied. Eighteen glass dishes were filled with 90 mL of 1M HCl. Five iron pieces, grouped by coating, were placed in each glass and left for three days; fifteen pieces of each coating/control were corroded in one set of trials. The masses were taken at the end of experimentation. The results are as follows: alkyd resin group generally showed the least corrosion while epoxy ester and black oxide showed the most. Through analyzing the results of three one-way analysis of variance tests (critical value F(5,174,0.05) is 2.21) and subsequent post-hoc Tukey tests (critical value q 0(0.05,174,5) is 3.858.), it was determined that the significant difference in means was found in the alkyd resin group. Therefore, the hypothesis was rejected.

THE EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON THE AFFINITY OF CARBON DIOXIDE TO MOLECULAR SIEVE 4A
Robert Adrian Ray
De La Salle High School, Concord, California, USA

The purpose of my experiment is to find the optimum temperature for absorbing CO2 in molecular sieve 4A. <br><br>I first heat up my column to the test temperature. Then, I take a sample of 10% CO2 and 90% air with my input gas syringe. I then push this air through my column until there is no space left in the syringe. I simultaneously fill up the output syringe, “syringe 2,” to the same level that syringe 1 was at after filling it with air. I then heat up my oven to the maximum temperature and take a gas chromatograph sample of syringe 2. I then open the valves leading to the peristaltic pump and pump the gas in the column into syringe 3. I then take a sample of this gas and run it three times through my gas chromatograph. <br><br>The data for sample 1 showed that the average percent in relation to the amount of air desorbed is 69.7% CO2 at 50°C. The data for sample 2 showed that the average percent of CO2 in the desorbed air is 74.6% CO2 at 100°C. The data for sample 3 showed that the average percent of CO2 in the desorbed air is 62.1% CO2 at 150°C. The data for sample 4 showed that the average percent of CO2 in the desorbed air is 64.4% CO2 at 200°C. <br><br>I can conclude that the optimum temperature for carbon dioxide absorption into molecular sieve 4A with minimal absorption of air is around 100°C. My Student’s t-Tests show that there is a significant difference between the data of each sample.<br><br>

ADVENTURES IN GOLD NANOROD SYNTHESIS
Christopher Thomas Phare
Jefferson County International Baccalaureate School, Birmingham, AL, U.S.A.

Nanotechnology will quite possibly be at the center of future advances in many fields. Nanoscale rod-shaped particles, or “nanorods,” are especially praised for their interesting optical and electronic properties. Such nanorods can also be used for medical imaging through a technique known as two-photon luminescence or for cancer treatment because of their absorption properties in the IR spectrum.<br><br> Reliable production methods are important for all applications of nanorods. Although several methods have been developed in the past, a new set of solution-based synthesis methods is especially promising because of the long rods and high aspect ratios achievable.<br><br> This experiment focuses on developing a reliable method for synthesis of high aspect-ratio gold nanorods. Several published methods are compared, including simple one-step and three-step seeded growth procedures. Various modifications of this original procedure are also explored, such as a pH-mediated approach, the use of CTAB- instead of citrate-capped seeds, the use of C12TAB and C14TAB as an analogous surfactant to C16TAB, and the addition of nitric acid to aid in nanorod growth.<br><br> The vast majority of the methods attempted did not successfully make detectable nanorods. Instead, some nanorods, along with presumably triangular and decahedral shapes, were found in a waste bottle. The nitric acid procedure and one proposed by the Mulvaney group also look to be promising; however, none have been able to produce a significant number of nanorods.<br><br>

JITTERBUZZ- THE DANCE OF THE TEENAGE CAFFEINE ADDICT
Christine Marie Wrolson
Trinity Christian School, Williston, ND

The purpose of my project was to determine the cardiovascular and behavioral effects of caffeine on teenagers. I tested 3 groups, which consisted of 5 teenagers each. Subjects were not allowed to consume caffeine for 2 weeks. After that period, 5 subjects consumed no caffeine, 5 consumed 1 Mountain Dew and 1 chocolate bar per day, and 5 consumed 3 Mountain Dews and 2 chocolate bars per day, for 2 weeks. Then for 1 more week subjects could not consume any caffeine. Vitals (B/P, pulse, respiration rate, oxygen saturation) were taken every other day during the last 3 weeks. Results show vitals increase with increased caffeine intake and also had more intense withdrawls.<br><br> To visualize the caffeine intake, I extracted it from tea, coffee, pop, and chocolate. I put tealeaves and boiling distilled water in a flask. The solution went through a funnel, was boiled down, and added to a separatory funnel with CH2Cl2. I shook the funnel, drained off the CH2Cl2 layer, added NaSO4, and evaporated the solution into crystals. I repeated the process using 2 types of coffee grounds, Mountain Dew, syrup, and chocolate. Water and NH4OH were added to Mountain Dew and chocolate syrups in separatory funnels. The results of the caffeine extraction were as follows: tea- 20mg, coffee- 25 mg, coffee- 35 mg, chocolate- 15 mg, and pop- 100 mg.<br><br> I conclude that my hypothesis was correct. The vitals increased with more caffeine intake along with the withdrawls, and noticable behavior differences. Mountain Dew also contained the most caffeine.

HOMEMADE NATURAL INSECTICIDE
Vladimir Santana Rodriguez Arroyo
Cientific School, Albert Einstein. Lima - Lima city. Peru

The idea to carry out this project arises of the need of new alternatives for the use of agrochemicals in the agricultural middle. The natural insecticide is done based on leaves of nettle (urtica dioica) that when cause they pass for a process of finished they free capable substances to fight plagues of red spider and fleas, that attack to the cultivations of asparagus. To produce the insecticide they should be collected ½ kilogram of fresh nettles. Then him it is left to soak in 5 liters of water during 2 days in order then the prepared to strain it. Later it boils all during half an hour and al to finish proceeds to mix in double quantity of clean water. The insecticide had the results expected on the plagues mentioned previously. The 75% of the population of fleas died and the 75% of the population of red spider also. This signifies that the insecticide is a collaborator with the sustainable development because does not damage the land and the products cultivated are natural products. The products that would be cultivated with this more would be demanded insecticide in the market by their better quality. In conclusion the insecticide manufactured possesses a reduction cost and low technology for which its production among the poor peasants would not be problem, thus the peasants would not need to buy insecticides that cost more than 20 dollars that besides are toxic when can manufacture one own that is not toxic and that costs them 5 dollars approximately

COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT FLAX BIODIESELS
Ross Michael Hemmingsen, Zackary Drescher
Alden-Conger Hight School, Alden, MN, United States

The purpose of our experiment was to extract oil from different types of flax seeds to produce biodiesel from the oil, and compare the energy outputs of each. First we learned how to extract the oil from the flax seed by grinding up the Flax seed and soaking it in hexane. Using that oil that we extracted with hexane, we distilled all of the hexane out of the oil to obtain the pure flax seed oil. After obtaining the oil we mixed it with a methanol/lye solution using a reduced formula from a former student. Then the mixture goes through the process of transesterification, which is the heating, and mixing of the oil, methanol, and lye. Finally after 24 hours we burned the biodiesel in the colorimeter and obtained our data that we needed. We continued this process three times to find out the energy output of a total of three different flax seeds. We then compared the energy output of biodiesels with each other. These are the following results; Light oil had and average of 1628.06 cal/gram, Dark oil was 1282.15 cal/gram and Organic oil was 1251.85 cal/gram. From the results we found out that the lighter colored oil had a higher oil per calorie average than the other oils that we tested. Further studies would be to test more varieties and compare them with other results. These varieties can be based on the location and condition on which they are grown.

LIGHTING A FIRE: A STUDY OF THE FUELS INVOLVED IN THE HAYMAN FIRE
Max Krakauer, Alex Ruch
Palmer High School; Colorado Springs, CO; US

The effects of wood type on temperature were analyzed, and correlations were explained based on the data collected. It was hypothesized that the densest wood would burn the hottest and the longest, as there would be more matter to combust. Wood samples of ponderosa pine, douglas fir, and aspen, were first dried, and then heated using a Bunsen burner until combustion occurred. Results were collected using a thermocouple as to the maximum temperature and the duration of the sustained combustion reaction. These data points were then analyzed and graphed, in order to produce effective correlations, in an attempt to further explain the Hayman fire. It was found that contrary to the predicted outcome, the least dense wood, aspen, actually burned for the longest duration and with the highest maximum temperature. It was further observed that the longer the wood was dry, the higher the maximum temperature was. Furthermore, the decline of the combustion reaction can positively be explained using an exponential function, as per the guidelines of Newton’s Law of Cooling.

ANALYSIS OF AN ALTERNATIVE FUEL SYNTHESIZED FROM CARBON AND WATER
Samuel Richard Gates, David Chandler Russ
Christian Academy of Louisville, Louisville Kentucky, USA

A combustible fuel source was created from water and simple graphite. To do this, an electrical arc is formed under tap water between two carbon electrodes. The source of the electricity comes from a high voltage, high amperage source, specifically from an arc welder at 125A. As the electricity arcs through the water, the water molecules are electrolyzed. Much of the resulting hydrogen and oxygen gas reacts with the energized carbon rods, forming carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and various hydrocarbons. These gases are collected, and they are found to be combustible. Through calorimetry it can be found that 60. mL of this gas combusted in air can heat 40. mL of water at room temperature as much as 5.33 °C, while natural gas only 5.26 °C and pure hydrogen only 2.25 °C. In order to get the above measurements of the potential energy in the gas, the reaction occurred in a large beaker and the gas captured in a test tube. The gas was then burned from a syringe in a manner similar to a Bunsen burner. However, once the favorable calorimetry measurements were observed, a continuous reaction vessel was constructed to mass produce the gas. A vessel like this could be used to fuel internal combustion engines, houses, et al.

THE EFFECTS OF THE CROSSLINKERS GLUTARALDEHYDE, DTBP, AND SEBACIC ACID ON CATALASE'S VIABILITY AND IMMUNITY TO PROTEASES
Joshua Aaron Ozer, Hariharan Athreya
Keystone School, San Antonio, Texas

Catalase breaks down hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen gas. In industry, it is used to prevent food spoilage, dye clothes, and preserve soil in landfills. Crosslinkers are chemicals that connect two proteins to each other and serve as bridges between the two.<br><br> This experiment was conducted to determine whether crosslinkers (Glutaraldehyde, DTBP, Sebacic Acid) could be used to engineer a more robust catalase for use in industry by increasing tolerance to proteases and heat stress. It was hypothesized that high concentrations of crosslinkers would produce inactive catalase, low concentrations would produce normal catalase, and intermediate concentrations would produce catalase more resistant to extreme conditions.<br><br> All three crosslinkers were added to catalase at serial dilutions of 50% starting with 1000 µM and ending with 1 µM. Then, solutions were dialyzed or incubated. The dialyzed samples were then subjected to Proteinase K, and both groups were given hydrogen peroxide as a substrate. An assay was used to determine the amount of remaining hydrogen peroxide, thus determining activity of catalase. Absorbance was measured for each group.<br><br> Crosslinking resulted in a 3.1%, 3.0%, and 2.7% improvement in catalase activity when subjected to Proteinase K in Glutaraldehyde, DTBP, and Sebacic Acid respectively. Incubation showed little difference in catalase activity when crosslinking was done.<br><br> Crosslinking catalase using these three crosslinkers produced a more stable enzyme when subjected to proteases, and would increase profitability for industrial applications. At high temperatures, it is likely that the crosslinkers helped denature the enzyme, resulting in loss of activity.

THE BIGGEST BANG: AN ANALYTICAL COMPARISON BETWEEN ROCKET ENGINE DESIGNS
Jonathan Anthony Walker, Mathew Bryn Trussell
Berkmar High School, Lilburn, GA, USA

In an age of constant demand for better fuel efficiency, rocket engines lag far behind today's ideals of clean efficient fuels. Hybrid rocket engines are a solution to today's standards for clean and efficient fuels. <br><br> The purpose of this investigation was to determine the efficiency of hybrid engines compared to solid fuel engines based upon a ratio of thrust to fuel.<br><br> To facilitate this experiment, a hybrid rocket engine that utilized sugar and nitrous oxide was compared to a common gunpowder engine. To help ensure consistent results, common store bought rocket engines, which shared a standard nozzle size, were utilized as both the solid fuel engines and the hybrid engines. The hybrid engines were manufactured out of the hollowed shells of the model engines into which the sugar based fuel was cast. The oxidizer tank, which contained the nitrous oxide, was made out of a double layered balloon connected to the rocket engine via a 1/4 inch brass valve. The hypothesis was made that the hybrid rocket engine would produce more thrust than the solid fuel engine based on the standard heats of reaction for common gunpowder and sucrose combustion. <br><br> The results from this experiment show that the hybrid rocket engine produced a lower amount of thrust and yielded a lower thrust to fuel ratio than the solid fuel rocket engine. Therefore, it was concluded from the experiment that the hybrid rocket engine design yielded a lower efficacy than did the gunpowder design. <br><br>

OIL FRICTIONS

We wanted to find the difference between synthetic oils and regular oils. We wanted to compare the oils based on their prices. We believe that our synthetics would hold more weight than our conventional oils. Our reason is that synthetics are higher priced and engineered for better efficiency. To test these oils, we created an apparatus, which would spin a metal washer on an electric motor. We then would oil this washer with each individual brand of motor oil. We would hang weights in a basket off of a steel rod and an aluminum rod, attached to the apparatus. We added weight until the washer stopped spinning. Then we turned the motor off and repeated the process of adding weight until we had a more exact measurement. We did that three times for each oil, and for each bar (aluminum and steel). We found that our synthetic motor oil did better than the regular motor oils. For Synthetic Oil Aluminum, Pennzoil did the best, it held 3800.4 g. Royal Purple got second. For Regular Oil Aluminum, NAPA held the most weight with 3592.4 g. Super Tech got second. For Synthetic Oil Steel, Super Tech held the most wieght with 3223.8 g. Quaker State got second. For Regular Oil Steel NAPA did the best holding 2986.4 g. Valvoline got second. Some future studies that we could do are to test the oils in a real motor. We could also try to make our own motor oils using the Fischer Tropsch Process.

OUT OF THE FRYING PAN, INTO THE TANK
Dustin Eugen Shung, Yasha Lashgari
Clark High School, Plano TX,, United States

This experiment was done to create an alternate fuel for diesel engine vehicles that can be used in place of the dwindling fossil fuels. Canola, vegetable, corn, and olive oils were converted into bidiesel as independent variables. Though it was hypothesized that canola oil would be the most efficient because of its high content of mono-saturated fats, corn oil proved to be the victor, outpacing the other fuels in the amount of carbon deposits, while producing a significant amount of energy, more than the other vegetable oils. Therefore, it was concluded that corn biodiesel was the best out of all the fuels. Willie's biodiesel slightly outperformed our vegetable biodiesels, which can be attributed to the use of animal oils in his biodiesel. To create our biodiesel, triglycerides were separated through the transesterification process, the breaking up of the glycerine molecule and the three fatty acid strains in oil. This process was done through the esterfication of the oil, through the adding of methanol, sulfuric acid, and sodium methoxide and the breaking of the bonds by the catalyst lye. We filtered out the glycerine, washed the biodiesel, and created B20, the standard mixture for a biodiesel, with 80 percent diesel and 20 percent biodiesel. These biodiesels were burned in alcohol burners to determine the amount of energy emitted through the specific heat formula and weighed the ring stand and calorimeter before and after the burning in order to determine the amount of carbon deposits.

THE EFFECTS OF SUPERCRITICAL CARBON DIOXIDE ON THE COMPATIBILIZATION AND CRYSTALLINITY OF POLYMER THIN FILMS
Christopher Donald Pynn, Zimra Payvand Ahdout
Half Hollow Hills High School West, Dix Hills New York, United States of America

Thin films of ethylene co-vinyl acetate (EVA) or polyethylene (PE) and deuterated polystyrene (dPS) were spun cast onto silicon wafers and crystallized in supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) at pressures and temperatures corresponding to the density fluctuation ridge or thermally annealed using standard protocols. The morphology composition and melting points of the films were studied using scanning force microscopy and imaging time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry as function of film thickness and homopolymer concentration. The results showed that exposure to scCO2 produced highly crystalline films. Furthermore, in contrast to the thermally annealed films, the homopolymer was fully incorporated into the crystalline phase.<br><br>The surface morphology of the films after crystallization showed either island or hole structure, depending on the relation between the film thickness and the lamellar height. <br><br>

RETURN OF THE RINGS: THE INVESTIGATION OF MULTIPLE SYSTEMS OF LIESEGANG RINGS AND BIFURCATIONS
Skylar Davis Williams, Aaron Mark Weaver
Miami High School, Miami Ok, United States

The purpose of this project is to grow two different Liesegang ring systems in different environments and hypothesize how this phenomenon occurs and why. The two rings are composed of iron hydroxide and copper chromate precipitates. This project is also designed to see if the environment of the rings will affect the growth or traits of the rings, and to conclude if electricity has any affect on any part of the rings appearance, or growth. We are also looking to see if the number of bifurcations is affected by the environment. And finally this project is designed to observe the diffusion rate of both of the systems used in this project. The Liesegang ring formations in this experiment involve CuSO4 in conjunction with K2CrO4 in the first set, and FeSO4 and NH4OH which dissociate into ions and are represented by the following net ionic reactions:<br><br>[Cu2+] (s) + [ CrO4 2-] (aq) --> CuCrO4 (s)<br><br>[Fe 2+] + [OH 1-] --> Fe(OH)2 (s)<br><br>SO4 2- , K1+, SO4 2- , and NH4 1+ <br><br>are all spectator ions and are not involved in the precipitation reactions forming the ring structures. In this investigation, the K2CrO4 (0.1 M) and FeSO4 (0.1M) reactants were homogeneously dispersed within the gel medium while the CuSO4 crystals exceeding 0.1M and the 6M solution of NH4OH were placed over the agar-chromate systems. The systems are then exposed to selected environmental factors including: electromagnetism, electricity, UV light and temperature. The systems were evaluated for ring formations and bifurcations. Additionally, the rate of ring formation in the two systems was evaluated. Results indicate that each of the factors had significant influence on the rings formed (ANOVA p< 0.001).<br><br>

THE TRANSESTERIFICATION OF COOKING OIL INTO BIODIESEL
Amanda Michelle Hester, Amanda Hester, Mary Beth Jewell
Hart County High School, Munfordville, KY, United States

We wanted to test whether the transesterification of new or waste cooking oil would create the most efficient biodiesel product. Our hypothesis was that the waste cooking oil would yield the most efficient biodiesel product. To show which cooking oil would be the most efficient, we used a calorimeter to test the amount of heat each biodiesel sample creates. We transesterified and tested six samples of each type of biodiesel to provide more consistent results. Our results showed us that both samples produced approximately the same amount of heat, but the samples made from new cooking oil were slightly more efficient.

TWO MODELS FOR THE AT-LINE PROCESS CONTROL OF MOISTURE CONTENT USING NEAR-IR SPECTROSCOPY IN PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURING
Hasib F. Nasirullah
American Heritage School, Plantation, FL, U.S.A.

The delivery of high quality, cost effective pharmaceuticals depends on the development of rapid and efficient quality control techniques. Traditional techniques occur post-production in the laboratory and require weeks to assure high product quality. The introduction of Near-IR spectroscopy draws quality control out from the laboratory and directly into the production room, reducing analysis time from days to mere minutes.<br><br>In this study, a Near-IR spectroscopy calibration model was developed to determine the percentage relative humidity and water content of uncoated tablets. For the tablets tested, humidity and water content affect the dissolution of the active pharmaceutical ingredients in the drug. Two models were built using primary component analysis. Both models had R-squared values over 0.97. The models were then tested using a separate test set. The Near-IR determined values came within +/- 4.0% of all reference values. Reference values were obtained using traditional laboratory methods: a hygrometer for percent relative humidity and loss on drying analysis for water content. The study concluded Near-IR spectroscopy is a feasible method for quickly determining the water content and relative humidity of uncoated tablets. An expanded study could validate the technology for balancing humidity and water levels during tablet coating in production.<br><br>

The purpose of this experiment was to discover how much the Feet Per second (FPS) changed on an average 30-30 rifle bullet for every 1 gram of gun powder added. I believed that the FPS would be raised by 10 feet per second.<br><br>Using a rifle scale, I measured the grams of the bullet. Using a rifle a chronograph, the FPS was measured after the gun was discharged.<br><br>The data obtained from this experiment was the following: for 30 grams the average speed was 2260 FPS, for 31 grams the average speed was 2275 FPS, for 32 grams the average FPS was 2280 FPS, the average speed for 33 grams was 2165 FPS, and the average speed for 34 grams was 2095 FPS.<br><br>Some conclusions that can be drawn from this experiment are that 32 grams is the most ideal amount for this bullet that for each gram of powder added above 32 grams dropped off an average of 105 FPS.<br><br>Some possible extensions for this project would be to determine the reason for the FPS drop off after 32 grams.<br><br>

ARE AIRPORTS DEICERS SAFE? RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY FOR QUANTITATION AND CLASSIFICATION OF AIRPORT DEICERS AND ANTI-ICERS
Esther Oluchukwu Uduehi
Francis Joseph Reitz High School, Evansville, IN, USA

Aircraft deicers and anti-icers (ADAFs) are commonly used on the wings and fuselage of aircrafts during cold weather to remove and prevent snow and ice build up on aircraft surfaces. However, releases of ADAFs to the environment have the potential to cause damaging effects to aquatic ecosystems and the water supply proximal to the airport, but manufacturers of ADAFs are not required to reveal the contaminants responsible for toxicity. Therefore, by quantifying and classifying substances, detection limits and how the six ADAFs are distinguishable from one another can be found. <br><br> First, the detection limit was found for ethanol and ethylene glycol, a major component of ADAFs. Using Raman spectroscopy, tests were run on 13 solutions. Then, a data analysis for linear regression was run on the results and a baseline was found. A calibration line was then calculated and the detection limit was found. The limits of Raman spectroscopy were also tested prior to the analysis of the ADAFs. This was done by calculating the percent ethanol in three alcohol samples.<br><br> Finally, a general classification was done on six ADAFs: Octagon Type I, Cryotech Type I, Dow Type I, Dow Type IV, Lyondell Arco Plus Type I, and Lyondell Arctic Plus Type I using Raman spectroscopy integration methods and principal component analysis. It was found that each ADAF has distinct characteristics; however, apart from Dow Type I, the ADAFs also have similar characteristics relative to each other.<br><br><br> <br><br>

CHARACTERIZATION OF ANTHOCYANINS IN PURPLE POD COATS OF PHASEOLUS VULGARIS CV. BLAUHILDE
Brandon Timothy Lew
Breck School, Minneapolis, MN, USA

This project focused on anthocyanin pigments that cause purple coloration in pod coats of snap beans, Phaseolus vulgaris cv. Blauhilde, which is the world’s second largest bean crop. Anthocyanins have anti-oxidative and anti-carcinogenic properties, so these plant pigments are of interest to nutritional and pharmaceutical companies. However, pigments in the bean pod coats degrade during cooking. Neither the pod coats nor the cultivar Blauhilde of Phaseolus vulgaris have been previously investigated for anthocyanin content.<br><br>Anthocyanins were extracted with acidified methanol, analyzed using HPLC and NMR, purified with column chromatography, and characterized with HPLC coupled with tandem mass spectroscopy (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS). Results showed malvidin 3,5-diglucoside to be the major anthocyanin, comprising 86% of the pigment. Seven other anthocyanins were found in the pod coats. The next step of this project will be to genetically engineer stable anthocyanin pigments in living plants, so the pods will retain beneficial anthocyanins during cooking. (150 words)

SURFACTANT EFFECT ON AN IN-VITRO DISSOLUTION PROCEDURE
Raul Caso
McArthur High School, Hollywood, Florida, United States

This experimental project had the purpose of analyzing the effect of a surfactant on the in-vitro dissolution procedure of a water non-soluble extended release drug product, which treats the symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The development of a dissolution method is an everyday challenge for pharmaceutical laboratories. <br><br> The dissolution of the active substance was determined by evaluating its disintegration in three pH media of 1.2, 6.8, and 7.5. The results yielded 75% maximum dissolution with a near-perfect correlation between the mean values. For the remainder of the experiment the medium with pH 6.8 was chosen due to the dissolution objective of the generic drug. Then, three surfactants (1% Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS), 1% Polysorbate 80, and 1% Lauryldimethylamine oxide) in the pH 6.8 medium were utilized in order to isolate the surfactant that could give the highest dissolution. The results demonstrated that only SLS increased the release of the active ingredient to 100%. The data yielded a relatively high correlation between the mean dissolution values. Finally, the concentration of SLS was adjusted to a concentration of 0.5% in order to maximize the sensitivity of the method that was being developed. The dissolution method (pH 6.8 medium with 0.5% SLS) was tested using four different formulations of the pharmaceutical product. <br><br> The results to this experiment enabled the creation of a test method that simulates in-vivo drug dissolution through the use of in-vitro conditions. This dissolution method now becomes part of the quality control procedure at a pharmaceutical laboratory. <br><br>

Some defects were found in currently prevailing gasoline detergents through the investigations on their operating principles. The project was started because gasoline detergent was a very important addictive. In this study, current formulation was modified to acquire the preliminary formulation of a new detergent under the assistant of surfactant technology, microemulsification technology and decarbonization technology. <br><br>The formulation of NDEEC (a New Detergent which is environmentally friendly, Energy-saving and Cost-effective) was finally developed after a step-by-step experiment in which multiple optimizations were done logically. Theoretical explanation and pilot run verification and data analysis help to the evaluation of the sample made in each step. The final formulation (NDEEC) proved to be of the highest gasoline detergency. <br><br>Compared with current gasoline without NDEEC, the oil consumption of the gasoline with NDEEC is 6.9L/100km, approximately with 11% energy saving. As to emissions, CO% is 0.31% under idle conditions and 0.22% under high-speed idle conditions, which is reduced by about 25% and 12%, respectively. HC concentration is 55ppm under idle conditions and 45ppm under high-speed idle conditions, decreasing by about 31% and 30%, respectively. <br><br>It is proven that this project is feasible on the basis of<br><br>experimental result analysis, actual verification and cost calculation. So it is believed that the formulation of NDEEC is of high value of public promotion. <br><br>

ELECTROCHEMICALLY TESTED NANOPARTICLE PAINTS

After the exploration of the effects of nanoparticles on electrochemical properties in salt solutions, this year’s electrochemical experiment was to design a technique analyzed which type of nanoparticles, zirconium oxide or diamond, will sufficiently protect alloy probes from corrosion when they are mixed with certain types of coating fluids. This experiment determined the maximum voltages to initiate the accelerated corrosion process. <br><br>A total of fifteen tests with Polyshades® (a combination of stain and polyurethane), Rust-Oleum® (protective enamel), and Ross® School Glue were performed as they were used to coat the needle tips with different nanoparticle additives. Afterwards, the two needle tips were inserted into the ends of a microtube that was injected and filled with one molar NaCl and NaNO3 solution.<br><br>The zirconium oxide additives for all three coating-mediums showed greater voltages when compared to that of the diamond additives and of the initial paints. They increased the maximum voltages from a range of 1.4 to 1.9 times better than their initial paints. Especially with 0.67 grams of zirconium oxide nanoparticles in two milliliter of Rust-Oleum®, the voltage was the highest compared to the other tests. However, not all nanoparticle additives can enhance the corrosion-resistance of the coated needle tips as demonstrated by this experiment. Diamond nanoparticle additives did not consistently increase the required reaction voltage to corrode the needle tips and in tests with Polyshades® resulted in even lower voltages than the original paint.

SYNTHESIZING DMPC-CAPPED GOLD AND WATER-SOLUBLE CADMIUM SULFIDE NANOPARTICLES
Markrete Krikorian
Townsend Harris High School, Flushing, New York, USA

Nanoparticles exhibit unique size-dependent optical properties, which play a promising role in the development of biosensing devices to detect cellular changes in vitro. In the current study, a novel methodology was developed to synthesize lipid-capped gold and water-soluble cadmium sulfide nanoparticles. To this end, 1, 2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC)-capped gold and water-soluble cadmium sulfide nanoparticles were prepared. The nanoparticles were characterized using UV-vis spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering (DLS) particle-size analysis. Additionally, the gold nanoparticles were examined using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and the emission characteristics of the cadmium sulfide nanoparticles were determined using Fluorescence spectroscopy. The Langmuir-Blodgett technique was used to assemble the DMPC-capped gold nanoparticles onto a water sub-phase at room temperature. The resulting compression isotherm confirmed the ability to form a monolayer from these lipid-capped gold nanoparticles.

HYDROGENIC DEFECTS IN ICE
Sophie Alice Renner
James Allen's Girls' School, Dulwich, London SE22 8TE, United Kingdom

Despite the simplicity of the water molecule, ice is a complicated solid that exists in fourteen known phases. Transitions between these occur with changes in temperature and pressure. Generally, as pressure increases the oxygen arrangement becomes distorted. In all ice structures there are 4N (N=number of molecules) possible hydrogen positions, at high temperatures all are partially occupied, while at low temperatures only a subset of them are occupied. When cooled the structure undergoes a disorder-order phase transition between these two regimes. Some phases, such as Ice VII, undergo their disorder-order phase transition readily, while others such as Ice Ih require dopants. The aim of this project is to investigate why some ice phases undergo disorder-order phase transitions more easily than others.<br><br>Hydrogenic defects are hydrogen bonds containing either two or no hydrogens. Their spontaneous creation and movement through the hydrogen bond network may provide a pathway for rearrangement of hydrogen positions, allowing a phase transition to occur. If defects form less easily in Ice Ih than in Ice VII this explains the difference in ease of phase transition.<br><br>Defects were created in supercells of Ice Ih, Ice VII and Ice XII using a specially written computer programme (‘Defect Maker’) and the structures were optimised, using Density Functional Theory and TIP6P potential, in order to find the energy needed to create the defect.<br><br>Results showed that software based on Density Functional Theory was more appropriate for optimisation, and that defect energy is affected by the molecular topology surrounding the defect.<br><br>

PEROXIDE POWER 6... AN ALTERNATIVE FUEL
Christine Kay Nelson
Laporte High School, Laporte Minnesota, USA

For six years I have been developing a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) fueled engine. When H2O2 is broken down with a catalyst, manganese dioxide (MnO2), it creates water vapor (H2O) and oxygen (O2). The gases can be used to create propulsion. So by using a stronger concentration of hydrogen peroxide, the more forceful the reaction can be. The problem is 30% H2O2 is the highest percentage available for me to purchase. To create a higher concentration, I boiled off excess water under vacuum. Once a higher percentage was verified by specific gravity and lowered volume, I tested the temperature change when reacted with MnO2. I then mixed different alcohols with MnO2 and added it to H2O2 to try to create a combustion reaction. In doing this, a reaction should occur that will make gases powerful enough to make an alternate fuel vehicle feasible. The dilemma is getting the alcohol to combust because in distilling hydrogen peroxide the stabilizer is also concentrated preventing a higher reaction temperature. But if the temperature reaches a high enough degree, the vaporized alcohol should ignite making a potent fuel achievable.

POLYMERS, PLASTICS, AND PENGUINS
Hillary Mariko Topazian
Century High School, Rochester, MN, USA

The purpose of this project was to investigate the properties of biodegradable plastics and compare them to commercially manufactured plastic (soda can rings). <br><br> The hypothesis was that bioplastic (often called biodegradable plastic) soda can rings would degrade at a faster rate than commercially manufactured plastic can rings when placed in different environments: soil, natural sunlight, ultra-violet light, and salt water, because of the differences in their chemical structures. The carbon-carbon single bonds of the manufactured plastic’s polymer chains are resistant to degradability. Bioplastic contains a biopolymer which has a “backbone” chain that includes non-carbon atoms; this allows rapid degradation. Inert fillers such as powdered cellulose or wood shavings would act as reinforcing agents to the bioplastic and would increase the tensile strength.<br><br> The bioplastics degraded in all environments, although the commercially manufactured plastics showed no signs of significant degradation throughout the experiment. <br><br> Although the commercially manufactured Pepsi plastic breaking point strength was the greatest, the bioplastic with wood additive was almost the same. The bioplastic with cellulose additive had a breaking point strength greater than bioplastic without additive so adding additives to the bioplastic increased the plastics’ breaking point strengths.<br><br> Further studies would include using other biopolymers such as cornstarch and wheat starch (to reduce the cost of manufacturing bioplastic) and creating a water-resistant bioplastic.<br><br>

SELECTIVE ELEMENTAL DETERMINATION WITHIN MULTIPLE MOLECULAR COMPOUNDS THROUGH GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY
Stephen Michael Bergin
St. Pius X High School, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA

The objective of this project is to design a more effective gas chromatograph instrument, more selective, sensitive and accurate at detecting particular elements within multiple molecular compounds. This project began with hopes of detecting oxygenates but expanded to the detection of several types of molecules including: sulfur, phosphorous (both chemicals commonly found in chemical weapons,) and nitrogen. A plasma-based gas chromatography instrument is used to detect the wanted element. A photo-diode is placed within a completely opaque box, which is placed over the plasma so that the only light the photo-diode detects is that from the plasma. Filters are placed between the plasma and the photo-diode. These filters are specific for particular wavelengths. Each molecular bond emits light at a particular wavelength. It is then possible to specifically and selectively determine if a molecule contains sulfur by setting up a filter that does not allow any light waves except for sulfur's 921 to pass through the photo-diode. The photo-diode then detects the changes in the amount of light and records it, creating a graph that allows a quick analysis to determine to which molecule the element belongs. Currently, there are strong indications of selectivity with sulfur and chlorine, and the instrument has proven to be sensitive to as low as 50 parts per billion. Recent tests have involved detecting chloroform in Albuquerque's water supply. Overall, the results of the experiments are encouraging, and future work will continue toward developing a more selective and specific gas chromatogram for oxygenates, which could lead to applications in oil and plastics industries, as well as other industries.

DETERMINING CARBON NANOTUBES' THERMODYNAMIC SOLUBILITY: THE MISSING LINK TO A PRACTICAL SUPERMATERIAL?
Philip Vidal Streich
Homeschool, Platteville, Wisconsin

Carbon nanotubes, in isolated form, are among the strongest and most conductive materials in the world. Their remarkable properties offer the potential for breakthroughs like a bridge to the moon, a bullet proof vest less than 1 mm thick, or a composite material 1,000 times stronger than the carbon fiber used in stealth fighters. However, nanotubes naturally clump together into tight, rope-like bundles, and, when bundled, they lose their super properties. Moreover, it has been universally assumed that nanotubes are thermodynamically insoluble in all solvents and are therefore impractical for real-world applications, which require the superior properties of nanotubes in homogeneous and permanently stable solutions. <br><br> This research presents the first evidence that nanotubes are thermodynamically soluble and quantifies this solubility and its limits by using static light scattering to measure a parameter called the second virial coefficient, B . This coefficient describes the forces between the solvent and the solute and hence is direct evidence of solubility if it is positive. A novel ultra-sensitive photon-counting spectrometer, more sensitive and precise than any commercially available, was designed and custom-built to collect static light scattering data from nanotube samples of different concentrations in the solvent N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone. Using these data, positive B values of 2.16 × 10^-3 (mol•mL/g^2) for single-wall nanotubes and 1.31×10^-3 (mol•mL/g^2) for multi-wall nanotubes were determined for the first time ever. These findings may be the key to finally realizing the potential of nanotubes as a supermaterial. <br><br>

CO emissions are among environmental problems of global importance. Palladium catalysts are used in industry for diminution of CO emissions. That’s why development of energy-saving catalysts is very important.<br><br>The aim of the work was to study catalyst properties of activated carbon and carbon fiber as Palladium carrier in the reaction of carbon monoxide oxidation and synthesis of catalysts with minimal amounts of Palladium.<br><br>Catalysts were synthesized by impregnation of activated carbon (AC) and carbon fiber (CF) with Pd(NO3)2 aqueous solution. Catalytic tests were carried out in a flow quartz reactor. The analysis of reaction products was carried out by a gas chromatograph. The thermal analysis data and surface texture of the samples were studied. <br><br>Modifying carbon surface with Nitrogen results increased thermal stability of carbon. Its surface did not oxidize under temperatures less than 773 K. <br><br>Comparison of AC and CF catalysts activity showed that when using carbon fiber as a carrier of the catalyst, expenses of Palladium are 9.5 times lower than when using activated carbon in the reaction of CO oxidation. <br><br>It is explained by comparing AC and CF catalysts textures. On the AC catalyst, some of Palladium, which didn’t accumulate on macro pores or on the outer surface of carbon, could not react with CO molecules. All Palladium accumulated on carbon fiber on the outer surface and it was able to react with CO.<br><br>The catalysts can be used in neutralization of transport and plants emissions. The economy of funds if using our catalysts is very high. <br><br>

DNA ELECTROPHORESIS ON NANOPOROUS POLYETHERSULFONE MEMBRANE SURFACES
Michael Ding
Glen Cove High School, Glen Cove, New York, USA

Surface electrophoresis is an emerging technique for separating DNA. Since chemical interaction between DNA molecules and surface would affect separation more than physical interaction, a novel approach using organic polymer-based membranes was explored. Two new surfaces, negatively charged nanoporous (1 and 10 kiloDalton rated) flat polyethersulfone (PES) membranes, were systematically studied. Droplets of Lambda MonoCut DNA, with concentrations varying from 5ug/ml to 50ug/ml, were labeled with YOYO fluorescent dye and deposited on the surface. Adsorption of DNA on the surfaces was imaged using Atomic Force Microscopy. Separation was optimized by varying the concentration of Tris-Borate-EDTA buffer solution from 10^-2 to 3X and the electric field from 3 to 7 V/cm. <br><br> Well-defined peaks of individual DNA fractions were obtained through confocal and fluorescence microscopy. The mobility of the DNA scaled with the number of base pairs (N) as N^-0.51 and N^-0.52 for 1 kD and 10 kD PES surfaces, respectively. When ionic strength of the buffer solution was changed, the mobility scaled with the persistence length (p) as p^1/2 in general. Molecular dynamics simulation of polymers on flat surfaces indicated that charged surface with repulsive force tended to make DNAs move faster compared to uncharged surface. However, there existed an optimum amount of charge. <br><br> The nanoporous PES membranes are promising surfaces for DNA electrophoresis. The innovative use of the charged surfaces opened a new arena for separation of million-base-pair genomic DNA. These PES membranes can potentially be used for disposable biochips, with implications for the Human Genome Project and fighting bioterrorism.<br><br>

The purpose of my project was to determine whether or not it was possible to determine the molarity of a solution of unknown concentration using a digital camera. I wanted to test whether using a relatively inexpensive device, the digital camera, would give me similar results to a spectrophotometer. I hypothesized that it would be possible for me to use my digital camera and computer bitmap (paint program- standard on all pc’s) to determine the molarity of a solution.<br><br> 1 molar solutions were prepared of iron (II) chloride, iron (II) nitrate, copper (II) chloride, copper (II) nitrate, nickel (II) chloride, and nickel (II) nitrate. The solutions were chosen on their variety of colors. These stock solutions were then diluted to molarities of 1 M, 0.5 M, 0.25 M, and 0.125 M. which were then place into standardized test tubes to an equal depth. Pictures were taken of each solution from above using a lamp to standardize the lighting. <br><br> The pictures were then analyzed on a personal computer where color level numbers could be generated. These color level numbers had an average correlation with the molarities having average correlation coefficient of 0.93. From this and the linear regressions that I constructed from the best-fit line graph, I concluded that my hypothesis was correct and it was indeed possible. When testing unknown solutions, I had anywhere from 2.4 to 4.8 % error on the different solutions.<br><br>

SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF ASPIRIN
Jade Elizabeth Sebion
Star City High School, Star City, Arkansas, USA

Aspirin is certainly the most widely used medicinal agent ever discovered. The chemical name for aspirin is acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). The highly colored complex which forms between acetylsalicylic acid and iron (III) chloride enables us to determine colorimetrically the specific amount of aspirin present in a tablet. Since the intensity of the color formed is directly related to the amount of acetylsalicylic acid present, a series of solutions, each with a different concentration of aspirin, can be prepared and the absorbance of each solution measured. The purpose of this study was to determine if it is worth the expense to buy extra-strength aspirin products instead of regular strength. My hypothesis is that buying extra-strength aspirin products is worth the extra cost. During this procedure I prepared a series of solutions, each with a different concentration of acetylsalicylic acid, and then using the spectrophotometer, I measured the percent transmittance of each solution. After I gathered the data from the spectrophotometer, I then used various formulas to determine the concentration, concentration ration, and the "mg of acetylsalicylic acid" for each of the solutions. Based on my research, I conclude that it is better to buy extra-strength aspirin products than to buy regular strength aspirin products, despite the extra cost.

THE GUM EXPERIMENT
Julie Lauren Barrios
Converse High School, Converse, Louisiana, USA

Most people enjoy mint flavored chewing gum for the refreshingly cool feeling left in their mouth. However, does the mouth actually cool down? The main purpose of this experiment was to find out if chewing gum decreases the temperature in a person’s mouth. The hypothesis is that for sugared gums a small decrease in temperature would occur due to the sugar dissolving in the saliva, which is clearly an endothermic reaction. It is also hypothesized that sugar-free gums would show no discernable decrease in temperature since they have no sugar. To test this hypothesis, twelve different types of gum were used; three different brands, consisting of a sugar, sugar-free, mint, and regular flavor in each brand if available. Four subjects were asked to chew all twelve different types of gum for a total of ten minutes. While the subjects were chewing the gum, their temperature was being taken every second. <br><br>

CORROSION MITIGATION USING THIN-FILM COATINGS OF POLYELECTROLYTE MULTILAYERS
Samantha Kay Lawrence
Christian Heritage High School Riverdale, UT, United States of America

Copper corrosion can lead to expensive repairs and maintenance, especially in marine and underground plumbing applications. The currently used corrosion inhibition methods are not optimal: Impressed Current Cathodic Protection (ICCP) requires the use of an anode and it needs a source of electricity and conventional coatings often breakdown, resulting in costly repairs. Layer-by-layer self-assembling thin-films are an attractive alternative because they can be tailored for a specific environmental need, the chemicals are easy to prepare and apply, layers can be alternated until protection is achieved, and they do not alter the appearance of the copper. <br><br> This project tested the ability of alternating layers of cationic and anionic polymers to protect copper from corrosion. Samples were protected with polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEM) formed from alternating layers of polyethyleneimine (PEI) and polystyrene sulfonate (PSS). The effect of the film stack terminus (PEI or PSS) at two different multilayer thicknesses (20 or 40) was studied. In addition, the effect of heating the sample between each multilayer deposition was compared to a film prepared at room temperature.<br><br> The films were characterized by contact angle measurements, cyclic voltammetry, and ICCP. Cyclic voltammetry curves for protected samples indicated that PEMs reduced corrosion current. The ICCP tests indicated that PEMs prevented corrosion as evidenced by a lack of copper patina formation. Heat-treated PEMs performed similarly to those not heat-treated.<br><br> The results of this experiment support the hypothesis that polyelectrolyte multilayers are resistant to corrosive environments and are a promising means of protecting copper in various applications.<br><br>

A COMPUTATIONAL EXAMINATION OF SPARTEINE
Alexander Peter Romanczuk
Academic Magnet High School, Charleston, SC, USA

Sparteine (C15H26N2) is a naturally occurring alkaloid with medicinal applications, chemical applications, and chemical peculiarities that make it of great interest to chemists. The properties of various forms of the molecule were examined through the lenses of computational chemistry and X-ray diffraction. Using the semi-empirical PM3 method and the ab initio B88-LYP/DFT method, the software CAChe was able to correctly predict that SSSR sparteine – the naturally occurring isomer – is the most stable. Nine sparteine-metal-halide complexes were then constructed in CAChe by bonding SSSR sparteine to a metal ion (copper(II), nickel(II), or cobalt(II)) and to two halide ions (chloride, bromide, or iodide). The bond lengths, bond angles, and bond orders predicted by CAChe were in accordance with the predictions of general chemistry theory and published X-ray data (available for some of the compounds), and calculations for the copper complexes indicated that – as some literature had previously suggested – copper could exist in an unusual tetrahedral arrangement when in a complex with sparteine, such as in sparteine-CuCl2. X-ray data were also obtained for the compound sparteine-CuCl2(HCl)2, and calculations correctly predicted that the trans-trans form (three chairs and one boat) of sparteine would be present, instead of the trans-cis (four chairs) form. In addition to being an investigation of sparteine, this project served as an investigation of the methods of the discipline of computational chemistry and a confirmation of the utility of this discipline.

SYNTHETIC ANALOGS OF SMOOTHENED INTRACELLULAR LOOP AS POTENT INHIBITORS OF CANCER CELLS GROWTH
Jarrett Renn Remsberg
Middletown High School, Middletown, MD, USA

Smoothened (SMO) is a critical component of Hedgehog (HH) pathway that is essential for stem cell renewal and is dysregulated in many cancer types. SMO is a seven transmembrane domain protein with three intracellular loops. Primary structures of SMO intracellular loops are unique and very much conserved among the species, which is indicative of significant and unique roles in intermolecular or intramolecular interactions. The hypothesis was that synthetic analogs of SMO intracellular loops may function as HH pathway inhibitors. <br><br> Derivatives of second intracellular loop were synthesized utilizing automated solid phase peptide synthesis based on Fmoc chemistry. Peptides were purified by HPLC and there anti-proliferative activity tested on melanoma cells by MTT assay. <br><br> Targeted libraries of second loop derivatives of varying length helped to identify compounds that inhibited the growth of melanoma cells in vitro with IC50 in nanomolar range. The most potent of antagonists obtained is the palmitoyl derivative of the N-terminal half of the loop, and is 12 residues long. Lipidation proved to be critical for the activity. Remarkably, retro-inverso versions of the peptide, in which all amino acids are in D-configuration, are even more potent and have IC50 in subnanomolar range. Circular dichroism studies proved that the peptides are folded both in aqueous solutions and in the presence of lipids mimicking the membrane environment. They also suggested that retro-inverso analogs have a different fold, which may contribute to higher activity. The new compounds are promising drug candidates and present convenient tools for solving the mechanisms of hedgehog signaling. <br><br>

FUNCTIONALIZATION OF ZEOLITES AND GOLD FOR POTENTIAL GENE DELIVERY USE
Hari Senthil Arul
Detroit Country Day School, Beverly Hills, Michigan, United States of America

Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates with pores of molecular dimensions. Particles, such as gold, should be able to self-assemble, or re-arrange, with these zeolites using a known interaction between biotin and avidin. With this structure, a gene could potentially be assembled with the zeolite-gold structure, and then inserted into the body for efficient non-viral gene delivery. Gold has already been shown to be successful, yet inefficient, in gene delivery. This experiment looks at whether gold can self-assemble with the zeolite [which it was able to]. The two types of zeolites used were micrometer-diameter ZSM-5 zeolites and synthesized nanometer-diameter silicalite zeolites. These zeolites were, through various steps, functionalized with avidin, with sample left unfunctionalized to be used as controls. Then, gold particles were biotinylated (functionalized with biotin) so they could be self-assembled with the avidinylated zeolite structure using the biotin-avidin interaction. This biotin-avidin interaction is the strongest interaction humans know of between a ligand [biotin] and protein [avidin]. Characterization of the self-assembled structure was done using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), which very clearly and qualitatively showed an assembly of gold and zeolite particles in various different arrangements. In the future, further modifications can be made to this complex for full generation of a non-viral gene delivery system, where the complex can enter the body, and the gene is released, most likely via breaking a disulfide bond. <br><br>

AN ANALYSIS OF TITRATION METHODS TO DETERMINE WHICH HAS THE MOST ACCURATE OBSERVABLE ENDPOINT IN AN ASPIRIN ASSAY
Holly A. Jordan
Home School, Franklin TN, USA

<br><br> The purpose of this project was to determine which titration method using phenolphthalein as an indicator has the most accurate observable endpoint in assaying the amount of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in one aspirin tablet. <br><br> Six different titration methods were tested:<br><br>• Two direct titrations with an ethanol-distilled water solution, one at room temperature and one heated and cooled. <br><br>• Two direct titrations with distilled water only, one at room temperature and one heated and cooled<br><br>• Two back titrations with excess NaOH, one at room temperature and one heated and cooled. <br><br> The back titration in hot water bath and ice bath had the most accurate observable endpoint for the following reasons:<br><br> 1. The pink to colorless indicator color change was easy to detect.<br><br> 2. It had the greatest percent ionization of ASA.<br><br> 3. It had a zero percent error in observed endpoint compared to the equivalence point.<br><br> 4. It had consistent results. <br><br> In a laboratory, it is most likely that more sophisticated equipment such as a photometer would be used to determine the endpoint of the titration; however, the method with the greatest percent of acetylsalicylic acid ionized would yield the best results. Also, in a classroom setting, a teacher or professor could choose one or more of these methods to teach concepts of titration and compare accuracy of methods.<br><br>

A NOVEL APPROACH TO RAPID DIAGNOSIS OF CANCER
Richard J Li
Monte Vista High School, Danville, California, USA

This study explored a novel method of rapid and noninvasive cancer diagnosis, combining FTIR spectroscopy and ligand-receptor binding to increase cancer detection accuracy. The spectra of NHEK normal skin cells and A-375 melanoma cancer cells were taken using a FTIR spectrometer in transmission mode. It was found that FTIR spectra could differentiate normal cells from cancer cells. Although no significant peak position shifts were observed between cancer and normal cells, the relative peak intensities of lipid and protein in cancer cells were lower because of their higher metabolism. As compared with normal cells, the peak intensity of melanoma cancer cells for the lipid peak decreased by 22.8%, the protein amide I peak by 30.6% and the amide II peak by 39.2%. More importantly, leucine-aspartate-valine (LDV), a ligand with high specificity to the alpha4beta1 integrin receptor that is overexpressed in many types of cancer cells, was used to amplify the spectral differences. The high affinity binding of LDV to the cancer cells altered the micro-environment of amide II and phospholipid bonds, causing significant spectral peak position shifts. These shifts created more substantial spectral differences between normal and cancer cells, increasing differentiation accuracy. Peak position shifts of the amide II bond of proteins, the phospholipids, and the carbohydrates suggested that LDV binding changed the lipid orientation and protein conformation of the cancer cell membrane. This novel diagnostic method, which combines targeted cancer binding and FTIR spectroscopy, has high potential for clinical application as a rapid and noninvasive cancer diagnosis/screening technique.

CAPILLARY ACTION IN CONTINUOUSLY-TAPERED NARROW GAP SPACE
Clifford Byungho Kim
North Allegheny Senior High School, Wexford, PA, USA

Capillary action is adhesion and surface tension at work. Capillary rise is known to be inversely proportional to tube diameter. Conventional measurements of capillarity involve relatively large tube diameters (~mm) due to limitations in making very thin capillary tubes. No research has been done on whether this inverse relationship holds true for diameters in a smaller regime. <br><br> The goal of this project was to quantitatively define the valid gap (diameter) range for this inverse relationship. A wedge-shaped apparatus was devised with glass plates, with gap size ranging from the millimeter to micrometer scale. This configuration allowed for a virtually infinite array of capillary tubes ?with varying diameters down to zero ?to be tested simultaneously. <br><br> For narrow gap ranges (< 30-160 micrometer for alcohol, water, or oil), the capillary rise was found to significantly fall off from the inverse relationship. The contact angle calculated from the measured capillary rise showed a monotonic increase in this gap regime, approaching 90 degrees at zero gap size. This result is ascribed to the tendency of a liquid to minimize its surface area due to surface tension, thus increasing the contact angle in the narrow gap range. A theory was developed that explains the observed capillary rise in the wedge apparatus. <br><br> The findings of this study suggest a possible change in wettability of a liquid on a structured surface. Introducing micro or nanoscale patterns on a solid surface is expected to alter the interaction between the liquid and solid, an important topic for micro and nanofluidics.<br><br>

THE TESTING OF KIDDER AND STUTSMAN, NORTH DAKOTA WELL WATERS FOR IONS
Laura Michelle Juelfs
Tappen Public School, Tappen ND, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to test multiple water samples from wells in the Kidder and Stutsman County, North Dakota for Iron, Calcium, Chloride, Sulfate, Nitrate, Nitrite, and water hardness. <br><br> I hypothesized that water samples from rural areas would have a higher content of Nitrate than city well samples. The amount of Iron, Calcium, Chloride, and Sulfate should be similar in all of the wells.<br><br> I collected well water samples from rural and city wells. To conduct experimentation I placed one drop of reference solution in each of the wells on microplate lids. In the first column I placed one drop of Potassium Thiocyanate testing for Iron, in the second column one drop of Sodium Oxalate testing for Calcium, in the third column one drop of Silver Nitrate testing for Chloride, and in the fourth column one drop of Strontium Nitrate testing for Sulfate. I repeated experimental steps for distilled water and all samples. <br><br> To test for Nitrate and Nitrite I used test strips. To test the water hardness I used a water hardness test strip. To test the pH of the samples I used a pH test trip. I matched the color of each on the color scale for each. <br><br> In conclusion none of the wells tested positive for Iron or Sulfate. Thirty-nine of the fifty wells tested positive for Calcium. Forty-nine of the fifty wells tested positive for Chloride. Thirty-two of the fifty wells tested positive for Nitrate. Four wells tested positive for Nitrite.<br><br>

PAPER RECYCLING
Albert Lingfeng Cui
Midvale Middle School, Midvale Utah, United States Of America

The objective of the project "Paper Recycling" is to find an environmentally friendly oxidant or oxidant/base combinations alternative to sodium hypochlorite. The alternative oxidant with the most potential as a viable alterative to sodium hypochlorite is hydrogen peroxide. Sodium bicarbonate is also be used to see if any increase in the effect of the oxidant is present. The alternative hypothesis is "The oxidization power of hydrogen peroxide mixed with sodium bicarbonate would produce the most environmentally feasible alternative to sodium hypochlorite." <br><br> To conduct this experiment, a procedure similar to the modern industrial method is needed. In order to replicate the industrial method, the following steps were used: boiling of the recycled paper to break up wood fibers and the paper-pressing process to remove water from the paper. Data collected from this experiment shows that the alternative hypothesis was correct. On average the data collected show that the combination of hydrogen peroxide and sodium bicarbonate produced results equal to the combination of sodium bicarbonate and sodium hypochlorite. Thus the alternative hypothesis is proven correct. The theory behind the results is that the oxidant power of hydrogen peroxide and sodium hypochlorite were increased due to the sodium bicarbonate that acted as a catalyst.<br><br> <br><br>

QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF VITAMIN D-DEFICIENCIES ON EPHIPHYSEAL PLATE GROWTH AND BONE DENISTY
Kali Anne Shephard
Valley High School, Hoople ND, USA

Osteoporosis is a common disease in which bone resorption outpaces bone deposition. In previous studies, a deficiency of certain vitamins and minerals has been linked to a decrease in bone strength. The purpose of this project was to determine if a nutritional deficiency in Vitamin D leads to a difference in angle, area, roundness, perimeter, length, and width of the chondrocytes in developing chick tibias, and if Vitamin D deficiency has an effect on bone porosity and strength. Chick tibia tissue was cut using glass knives on an ultramicrotome. The tissue had been suitably fixed and embedded in an Epon epoxy resin prior to sectioning. One micron thick sections were then collected, viewed and photographed using an Olympus BX-51 microscope. Image analysis was then performed to determine the effect of Vitamin D on chondrocyte angle, area, roundness, perimeter, length, and width in chick tibias. Eight samples of both Vitamin D deficient and Vitamin D adequate were then measured. Micro CT analysis was also used to determine the effect of vitamin D on bone porosity and strength. The conclusions of this project were that Vitamin D deficiency did not lead to a significant difference in the chondrocytes of the articular cartilage. However, Vitamin D deficiency did result in a difference in bone porosity and strength.

WHAT IS THE MOST PRODUCTIVE POWDER AND CHEMICAL TO USE WHEN DEVELOPING LATENT FINGERPRINTS?
Philip William Lakin
F.W. Springstead High School, Sping Hill, Florida, USA

This experiment tested common powders and chemicals to see which are the most productive. Experimentation of powders and chemicals was conducted separately. A variety of surfaces were chosen based upon their textual variations. Each surface had multiple fingerprints placed upon them to accommodate the multiple products and trials. Of the powders tested, black powder had the highest productivity rate at 80%. Of the chemicals tested, cyanoacrylate had the highest productivity rate at 67%. These results do not support the hypothesis which stated that there would be no most efficient powder or chemical. It was concluded that these forensic tools were the most efficient latent fingerprint-developing products. Further experimentation should include more trials and more products to test.

SYNTHESIS OF SUPRAMOLECULAR SELF-ASSEMBLING MACROMOLECULAR STRUCTURES
Matthew Bret Weiss
Breck School, Golden Valley Minnesota, United States

Supramolecular self-assembly is a rapidly growing field. Specific oxadiazole molecules display a potential for self-assembly through ligand-bonding with metal-ion complexes such as palladium(II) chloride and platinum(II) chloride. I synthesized 2,5-di(thiophen-2-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole, 2,5-diphenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole, 2-(furan-2-yl)-5-(thiophen-2-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole, 2-phenyl-5-(pyridine-3-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole, and 2-phenyl-4-t-butyl-(pyridine-3-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole through a protocol I modified.<br><br>The latter two oxadiazole molecules were synthesized because of inherent 90° angles formed when ligation occurs at the nitrogen on the pyridyl ring and the 1st nitrogen on the oxadiazole ring. Inherent electronic properties of these molecules make them optimal for self-assembly of novel macromoleculeS with potential uses in guest-host interactions or as fluorescent compounds. <br><br>Oxadiazole molecules were purified using vacuum filtration, desiccation, recrystalization, and isocratic column chromatography. Structure and purity were verified through 1HNMR spectroscopy and EI-MS. Yields were greatly improved from 10% to 85% through the use of back extraction, deprotination, increased reaction time, and the use of a dichloromethane as a solvent.<br><br>Self-assembly was successfully performed by combining a saturated solution of 2-phenyl-5-(pyridine-3-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole in anhydrous acetonitrile at 0 °C with a saturated solution of palladium(II) chloride in anhydrous acetonitrile at 78 °C. The structure was not determined, but analysis by 1HNMR indicated successful self-assembly. <br><br>

SURFACE PROPERTIES OF SUGAR COOKIES
Rebecca Lee Grout
Notre Dame Academy, Park Hills, KY, USA

The superficial cracking and checking observed in sugar cookies is largely misunderstood. Saleem et al. (2003) showed that this spontaneous cracking was result of moisture changes during cooling. By examining the external moisture- and temperature- induced checking and cracking, particularly during the cooling process, this study seeks to further the understanding of why cookies crack as they do. The results contribute to the more efficient production of a more stable cookie, one more appealing to consumers. Commercial sugar cookie dough 1.0 cm in thickness was baked and cookies were placed in one of three environments to cool: atmospheric conditions, 4 °C refrigerator, or elevated humidity. Digital photographs were taken at intervals throughout the process. By analyzing the ratio of dark pixels (crack area) to total area, cookies cooled in atmospheric conditions showed the largest extent of cracking (10.40% of surface) and those cooled in a humid environment showed the least (7.37%). Cookies were probed, showing that those cooled in atmospheric conditions required the least amount of force to penetrate the surface (2.575 N) and those cooled in a humid environment required the most (3.363 N). Cookies were then broken, showing similar trends, with atmospheric cookies requiring the most force to break (19.20 N) and humid-environment cookies requiring the least (10.04 N). T-testing confirmed that almost all mean values were significantly different from one another.

FRACTAL DIMENSIONS OF CRYSTALLINE SOLIDS
Luis Yediel Negron-Rivera
Francisco Morales High School, Naranjito, Puerto Rico

This research studied the crystallization process of some solids applying the mathematics of fractals. The purpose was to reinforce the theory that the formation of crystalline solids could be explained applying fractal mathematic. The research question was: What is the relationship between the crystallization rate of solids and the dimensions of the crystal and the crystalline fractal formed during this process? The hypothesis proposed was: As the time of the crystallization process increases, the crystal and the crystalline fractal formed will be more definite and of larger dimensions. To test this hypothesis, supersaturated solutions of the crystalline solids copper sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4•5H2O), potassium permanganate (KMnO4), sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium dichromate (K2CrO4) and magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (MgSO4•7H2O) were prepared using 85 mL of distilled water. Each one of these solutions was divided and placed in three different Petri dishes (25 mL in each dish) and in one watch glass (10 mL). These were set apart to observe the rate of the crystallization process and the fractal structures formed. The box method was used to approximate the fractal dimension of each solid. The fractal dimensions approximate by this method are known as Hausdorff - Besicovitch dimensions (Marnefe, 2000). Observations and measurements done showed that the crystals that grew rapidly were smaller than the ones that grew slowly. The crystals that were formed slowly were larger than those that grew rapidly. These fractal dimensions were larger and more definite when the crystals grew slowly. The data collected supported the hypothesis. <br><br>

EFFECT OF DIFFERENT ELECTRODES AND MEMBRANES TO THE ACTIVITY OF PEM FUEL CELL WITHIN AN ALKALI SOLUTION
Baris Can Kucukdeveci
TED Ankara College Foundation High School, Ankara, Turkey

In this project, the electrocatalytic activity and stability of polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEMFC), which are prepared by using Pt (platinum), Pd (palladium) and Ag (silver) metals; Nylon and Vileda membranes, within a 2 M NaOH (sodium hydroxide) solution, are examined. <br><br>The aim of this study is to find alternatives to the Pt metal, which is mostly used in this technology, due to its high cost and limited sources. In addition, it is intended to find membranes that will substitute the Nafion membrane, which is the ideal membrane in PEM fuel cells. <br><br>For the fuel cells, which are prepared by using each electrode and membrane, 4 trials are done. For each combination, the potential versus time graphs are drawn to compare the precision and electrocatalytic activity. Logarithms of hydrogen ion concentrations versus time graphs are drawn to compare membranes. <br><br>As a result, the highest electrocatalytic activity is observed with Pt-Vileda and Pd-Nylon combinations. The cells with Ag metals had low electrocatalytic activity compared to other metals. When membranes were compared, Nylon membrane showed more stability in transferring hydrogen ions than Vileda. <br><br>In the conclusion, Pd and Nylon were found to be the best alternatives to Pt and Nafion respectively. In addition, it is concluded that with each electrode, a variety of membranes must be used to examine the electrocatalytic activity of the PEM fuel cells, since membranes acted differently when they are used with different electrodes.<br><br>

A NOVEL WAY TO MEASURE SURFACTANT AT THE INTERFACE
Kile William Alford
West Boca Raton Community High School, Boca Raton, Florida, United States

Oils and waters can actively exist within the same phase, dispersing one immiscible phase within another, at an interface. Currently only expensive electronic devices can measure the total interfacial area of oil/water emulsions. In this project, test tubes with 30,000 MWCO (Molecular Weight Cut Off) filters are used to isolate the surfactant left in the bulk solution from emulsion molecules, to find the total interfacial area at a cheap price. Various surfactants are tested at varying concentrations under the Dye Complexion Method to determine the concentration of surfactant at the interface. Testing of the surface tension is done so to calculate the area per molecule using Gibbs Absorption Equation. Then, the area per molecule is multiplied by the concentration of surfactant at the interface. The resulting value is the area per molecule, and demonstrates that novel methods can be used to deterine the total interfacial area at the interface.

CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF HUMAN TWIN HAND SCENT USING GC/MS
Mollie A. Sussman
Rabbi Alexander S. Gross Hebrew Academy, Miami Beach, FL, USA

The differences in primary scents of twins were investigated. Human scent is composed of three different components. The primary component is determined solely by a person’s genetic makeup. The secondary component comprises environmental factors, including bacteria and diet. Finally, the tertiary component is composed of outside sources, such as soap, perfume, deodorants or lotions. Of the three components, the only one unique to a person is the primary scent. <br><br><br> Are the primary scents of twins too similar to allow for identification? In this experiment, teenage twins were tested to determine if in fact each human has his own unique scent. Each teenager underwent a process to rid himself of secondary and tertiary scents. Then the emitted scent was captured and tested using gas chromatography analysis. In all five twin sets tested, including the identical twin sets, the chemical compositions of their scents were significantly different, and thus, this experiment proved that every individual has his own unique chemical scent. <br><br><br> This finding is important because it provides another analytical method of identifying people. People may be able to eliminate evidence of their presence by wiping away any fingerprints, blood, or other DNA from their location, however, it was found that they can not remove their “unique” scent. Dogs can be trained, or machines can be programmed, to identify a specific person based on the primary scent they emit. This research has practical implications for national security identifications, criminal investigations, and medical diagnoses of epidemic diseases.<br><br>

A NEW SPIN ON CHEMISTRY THE EFFECT OF MAGNETIC FIELD STRENGTH ON DIAMAGENTIC SPIN-STATE REDOX REACTIONS
Tristan Bruce Kirkman
Battlefield High School, Haymarket Virginia, United States of America

The research goal was to determine the effect of magnetic fields on the rates of ionic and covalent reactions involving diamagnetic materials. This was done by measuring the gaseous yield of two different reactions via water displacement as a function of time under conditions of varying magnetic field strength. The hypothesis was that as the magnetic field strength increased, the reaction rate would increase proportionately for both reactions. It was observed that the weak magnetic field decreased the rates of both reactions, yet caused an initial increase in rate with the ionic reaction. The strong magnetic field decreased the rate of both reactions. After further analysis, it was concluded that whether the reaction was ionic or covalent did not matter. Instead, the characteristics of the electron pairs in each reaction and how they interacted with magnetic fields caused the variance in reaction rate. In the ionic reaction, the magnetic fields caused the electron orbitals of the material to shift due to each electron’s individual magnetism, gravitating towards different areas. This increased the likelihood of the formation of monoatomic hydrogen with electrons of identical spin. As a result, these atoms could not bond to form hydrogen gas, which caused the reaction rate to slow. Should complete isolation of monoatomic hydrogen be achieved, it could be used as a potent energy source. In the covalent reaction, in order to form products, the electron pairs do not split, and thus the shift caused by the magnetic field caused the rate to decrease proportionately.

BRIGHT, LUMINESCENT SILICON NANOPARTICLES FOR BIOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
Alexandra Maria Courtis
Davis Senior High School, Davis, CA, USA

In the last two decades, there has been increased interest in semiconductor nanoparticles or quantum dots (QDs). These fluorescent, single crystals behave like single atoms and provide clear benefits over the organic dyes currently used for tracking biological processes. On average, a QD is 20-30 times brighter than a single dye molecule. Furthermore, QDs resist photobleaching, a process by which dyes in solution rapidly lose their fluorescence. Since the production of QDs is very costly, the search continues for an industry-ready synthesis of nanoparticles with optimal characteristics for bio-imaging.<br><br>Towards this goal, I explored creating silicon QDs as silicon is both electrochemically stable and the second most abundant element in the Earth’s crust. Through a top-down approach, using sodium silicide and ammonium bromide, my work yielded highly luminescent, monodisperse particles with a three times higher yield than prior publications on the synthesis of such Si-QDs. During experimentation, I also developed a synthesis that yields luminescent silicon nanorods. Since a solution state synthesis to control the shape of Si-QDs had never before been accomplished, my work has further broken barriers in the field of silicon nanoscience. The unique properties of my spherical and rod shaped particles were confirmed by UV-Vis spectroscopy, PL spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Cell studies were performed which proved the potential the Si-nanoparticles’ bright luminescence holds for tracking biological processes and imaging cancerous tumors at the cellular level. The results of my study indicate the feasibility of employing the Si-QDs I created for bio-imaging applications.<br><br>

SOLVENT RATIO OPTIMIZATION FOR THE TWO-PHASE BIOCONVERSION OF MEDROXYPROGESTERONE ACETATE
Svetlana Pavlova Ikonomova
Kalamazoo Area Math and Science Center, Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA

Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is a steroid that is the active ingredient in the contraceptive drugs Provera® and Depo-Provera®. Through a series of reactions, this contraceptive drug can be converted to an inflammation reducing drug. The first reaction converts MPA to delta-1 medroxyprogesterone acetate (delta-1 MPA), an intermediate product.<br><br> The purpose of the research is to find the water, methylene chloride, and toluene solvent ratio that gives the shortest time to reach reaction completion for converting MPA to delta-1 MPA.<br><br> To accomplish this, MPA, dipotassium phosphate, menadione, Pimelobacter simplex cells, and different ratios of water, methylene chloride, and toluene were added to a reactor and continuously agitated. Temperature and pH were kept constant and this mixture was sparged with nitrogen-enriched air. Evaporating methylene chloride was refluxed back into the reactor. Samples were taken and analyzed by HPLC to check the progress of the reaction. <br><br> This study found that methylene chloride and toluene are both necessary for the reaction to go to completion (> 99% delta-1 MPA), with 25% methylene chloride being the best. Automated pH-control diminished the need for the phosphate buffer-salt addition, and removing it from 25% methylene chloride procedure gave the shortest the reaction time of 55.5 hours.<br><br>

A NEW MODEL FOR HYDROPHOBIC HYDRATION
Sarah Elizabeth Marzen
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Alexandria and VA, USA

This research presents a new model for hydrophobic hydration, which combines two previously disparate models (information theory and quantum chemistry/hydrogen bonding) into one, more complete model. Using statistical mechanics, we find that this model predicts that solvation free energy and solvation heat capacity of hydrophobic molecules depends on two uncoupled factors: hydrogen bond rearrangement and density fluctuations in the solvent. Additionally, multivariable calculus treatment of a rigorous definition of hydration number reveals that solvation entropy and free energy vary quadratically with the square root of solute surface area, rather than linearly, as previously thought. The findings of this model could be used to improve protein folding models, as protein folding is strongly affected by hydrophobic interactions.

ELECTROCHEMISTRY OF HOMEMADE SOLAR CELLS
Katie Lauren Labbe
Notre Dame High School, Chattanooga Tennessee, USA

The objective of this project was to produce one or more operational solar cells out of household materials. The projects main focus will be on semi-conductive, flexible substrates. First to become familiar with how solar cells work I made three solar cells made from cuprous oxide, plexi-glass, copper, and salt water. One being from a design I found online and the other two being my own experimental designs. Next I went on to see if I could make solar cells out of household materials, and if so which one will work the best. I made four cells all with plexi-glass, tin foil, and raspberry juice, but each one had a different household material that has Titanium Dioxide in it; including white paint, shoe polish, toothpaste, and sunscreen. <br><br>Next I went on to work on making flexible solar cells with household materials; I made three of these. Because of the lack of conductivity I decided to make three semi-flexible solar cells with foil and wires running through to increase the conductivity. Again I took my experiment one step further and made solar cells that were not flexible with wires running through them. For my conclusion I gathered all of my data to interpret and determine what was the best household product and which solar cell design worked the best.<br><br>

EXTRACTION OF POLICOSANOL FROM SWITCH GRASS
Leah M Fruechting
ASMSA, Hot Springs AR, United States

Policosanol is made up of aliphatic alcohols and can be taken as a dietary supplement to lower cholesterol. If policosanol can be extracted from switch grass, then switch grass has the potential to become a major cash crop. The residue left over from extracting policosanol from switch grass can be used to produce ethanol. Samples of wheat germ, beeswax, dietary supplement capsules, grain sorghum, and switch grass were extracted using sodium hydroxide and methanol or hexane. Samples were sent to an outside lab to be analyzed using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometer. Also, an assay was performed on switch grass extracted by water and switch grass extracted by hexane to see how much low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was oxidized when switch grass extract was present. Results showed that switch grass extracted with hexane contains policosanol. The switch grass extracted with hexane had the least amount of oxidization using the full strength extract, but there was more oxidized LDL from quarter strength extract than with the control. The switch grass extracted with water had the least amount of oxidization in the one-eighth strength extract and the most oxidization in the control. These results showed that the switch grass extracted with both water and hexane inhibited the oxidization of LDL.

DAIDZEIN'S HELPFUL DISAPPEARING ACT THE RECOVERY OF DAIDZEIN FROM AN IN VITRO REACTION MIMICKING LD-LIPOPROTEINS
Linh Chuc Tran
Jefferson County International Baccalaureate School, Bimringham, Alabama, USA

Atherosclerosis is the biggest disease causing premature deaths as well as long-term disabilities in industrialized societies. Statistically, one in fifty-eight people have this disease, but some may not realize it because of its slow development. Atherosclerosis causes the hardening of arteries from the build-up of cholesterol, fibrin, platelets, and other substances along the walls. Along with the blockage from the extra material, the added pressure from flow of blood also causes the wall to lose elasticity.<br><br>In this study, the soy isoflavone daidzein and its chlorinated form, 3’chlorodaidzein, were used in mimicking the biological reaction of the isoflavones interacting with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles to form daidzein oleate and 3’chlorodaidzein oleate. The solutions were dried down and then solubilized in chloroform. Electrospray ionization with tandem mass spectrometry was used to analyze the samples. From the graphs, minute amounts of daidzein and 3’chlorodaidzein were found; however, a higher amount of daidzein oleate and 3’chlorodaidzein were detected to support the hypothesis that daidzein and 3’chlorodaidzein react to form an oleate. By forming fatty acid esters around the particle, the isoflavones are able to lock in and protect the LDL from oxidation and protect people against atherosclerosis.<br><br>

THE IMPLICATION OF ELECTROCATALYSIS IN CASCADE REACTIONS STRATEGY: ELECTROCATALYTIC SYNTHESIS OF FUNCTIONALIZED 4H-CHROMENE SYSTEMS
Fedor M. Miloserdov
Moscow Chemical Lyceum 1303, Moscow, Russian Federation

Electrocatalytic multicomponent cascade transformation of cyclic 1,3-diketones, aryl aldehydes and malononitrile in alcohols in an undivided cell in the presence of sodium bromide as an electrolyte results in the formation of substituted 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-4H-chromenes in yields of 85-95% at ambient temperature over a 25 min reaction period with 2800-3200% current efficiency. <br><br> <br><br>This novel electrocatalytic chain process affords prominent synthetic flexibility in the design of functionalized 4H-chromene systems. The electrocatalysis of salicylaldehydes and cyano-functionalized C-H acids in alcohols in an undivided cell in the presence of sodium bromide as an electrolyte leads to the formation of substituted 4H-chromenes in 85-95% yields with 950-1900% current efficiency over a 15-30 min reaction period.<br><br>Thus, the simple electrocatalytic system can produce, under neutral and mild conditions, a fast and selective cascade transformation of C-H acids and carbonyl compounds into functionalized 4H-chromene systems – the ‘privileged drug scaffolds’ for cancer therapy and various biomedical applications. This electrocatalytic chain process offers a convenient way to functionalized 4H-chromenes and represents entirely new synthetic concept for cascade reactions strategy. The procedure utilizes inexpensive reagents, simple equipment and an undivided cell; it is easily carried out and is valuable from the viewpoint of environmentally benign and diversity-oriented large-scale processes. <br><br>

3-BROMO-5,6-DIHYDRO-4H-1,2-OXAZINE-N-OXIDES. SYNTHESIS, PROPERTIES AND APPLICATION
Leonid V. Romashov
The State Educational Establishment lyceum #1303, Moscow, Russian Federation

Aliphatic nitronic ethers have a poor synthetic application due to their low stability, explosive risk and unpredictable chemical properties. The only exception to the rule appears to be 6-membered alkylnitronates which were successfully used in more than 20 total syntheses of alkaloids by S.E. Denmark’s group during the last 10 years. However the only reaction of nitronates explored in all of these syntheses was their [3+2]-cycloaddition, which obviously doesn’t represent potential synthetic application of these compounds. In the Soviet times our laboratory was involved in the fundamental research work aimed at the complex study of high-energy compounds, including cyclic nitronates. However the absence of convenient synthetic approaches to their synthesis significantly limited practical application of the nitronat’s reactions found. <br><br>In this study we’ve focused our efforts on the attempt to build a “bridge” between the Soviet and American chemistry of oxazine-N-oxides. 3-Bromo-5,6-dihydro-4H-1,2-oxazine-N-oxides were chosen as model compounds for the study. These derivatives represent the analogues of 3-nitro-5,6-dihydro-4H-1,2-oxazine-N-oxides thoroughly investigated in the USSR and can be easily obtained via 3-step Denmark’s strategy. However we’ve found that chemistry of bromoxazines significantly differs from the chemistry of other nitronates. This enabled us to develop new approaches for the synthesis of various compounds, such as 3-vinylisoxazolines, isoxazoline-N-oxides, 3-nucleophilesubstituted derivatives of 1,2-oxazines. As vinylisoxazolines are considered to be convenient precursors of different bioactive compounds we’ve proposed a new method for their enantio/diastereoselective synthesis. It’s important to notice that simple terpenes easily available as both enantiomers (unlike chiral vinyl ethers used by prof. Denmark) were used as chiral inductors.<br><br>

MOVING TOWARD AN ARTIFICIAL LUNG USING SYNTHETIC POLYMERS IN MICROCIRULATION
Ethan Alonzo Williams
Tian Jin International School, Tian Jin, China 

Abstract<br><br> The purpose of this project was to try and replicate the attributes in a biological lung using a synthetic polymer. To do this one must find the appropriate polymer and design a layer that will allow gas to be transferred constant and gradual rate (not too fast, not too slow). <br><br> The student-created polymer was inserted into a device which was designed to test the synthesized material. A test chamber was inserted between a high concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2 rich) chamber and a high concentration of oxygen layer (O2 rich) – the gas which were produced and captured by the student researcher. A carbon dioxide gas detector was used in the oxygen rich chamber in order to measure the gas diffusion rates. <br><br> It was discovered that it is possible to control the gas exchange rate using a synthetic polymer which imitate the traits of a human lung. <br><br>

CHEMICAL SYNTHESIS OF COPPER 2+ ION DOPED ANATASE TITANIUM DIOXIDE USING A HYDROTHERMAL POUCH METHOD
Zachariah Richard Harris
Harris Home School, Bosque Farms, NM, United States of America

The purpose of this project was to synthesize anatase titanium dioxide doped with copper 2+ ions using a hydrothermal pouch method. The initial syntheses consisted of titanium isopropoxide and copper II nitrate reactants measured into a Teflon polymer pouch that was then heat-sealed. Ethanol and de-ionized water were used as backfill surrounding the pouch within the acid digester. The acid digester was then heated in a low temperature synthesis oven for 24 hours. The product of each synthesis was vacuum filtered and then analyzed using a crystalline powder x-ray diffractometer (XRD). The resulting phase and composition data guided the subsequent syntheses which were then characterized with an x-ray diffractometer. <br><br>Phase pure copper 2+ doped anatase titanium dioxide was successfully produced after a series of incremental adjustments to the mass of the reactants along with the staged addition of hydrochloric acid in increasing molarities. The copper 2+ doped titanium dioxide was then examined using Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Brauner-Emmet-Teller (BET) surface area analysis. Scanning electron microscope images indicated regular (approx. 3 µm) spherical agglomerates. The process resulting in a phase pure product was then repeated to ensure that the process was replicable. <br><br>

CATALYTIC ENHANCEMENT OF THE ETHANOL ELECTRO-OXIDATION BY NANO-CERIA/PLATINUM COMPOSITE ELECTRODES AS A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE FOR METHANOL IN DIRECT ALCOHOL FUEL CELLS.
Avni A Solanki
Lake Brantley High School, Altamonte Springs, Fl USA

This research investigated the use of ethanol as a viable alternative to methanol in direct alcohol fuel cells, by using nano-ceria/platinum composite electrodes for the catalytic electrochemical oxidation of ethanol. <br><br>Serial dilution was carried out to create the 1.0 M, 0.5 M, and 0.25 M ethanol and methanol solutions. The cleanliness of the platinum electrode was tested by cyclic voltammetry in 0.5 M sulfuric acid. Once clean, the three electrodes (reference, working, and counter) were connected to the potentiostat and the three concentrations of methanol and ethanol were run in order to obtain the graph of current versus potential (voltammogram). Then, chronoamperometry was carried out by holding the potential for 600s at - 0.2 V in a nano-ceria and K2PtCl6 solution in order to prepare the composite working electrode. The catalyst modified platinum electrode was used as the working electrode and the voltammetry for the ethanol solutions were obtained. This process was repeated three times to test if ethanol could be as efficient as methanol when using a catalytically enhanced electrode. <br><br>After the completion of tests the following conclusions were formulated. The ethanol solutions with the nanoceria solution in K2PtCl6 catalyst increased the amount of current significantly. The 1.0 M solution of ethanol with the nano-ceria/platinum electrode produced the highest amount of current, therefore, being the most viable alternative to methanol. Future research plans include testing more concentrations of ethanol and different catalysts to determine the optimum alternative to methanol in direct alcohol fuel cells. <br><br>

INDIRECT OBSERVATION OF COMMON OTC PHARMACEUTICAL DEGRADATION RATES
Alexa Marguerite Billow
Titusville High School, Titusville, FL, USA

Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are used in vast quantities and enter the waste stream active and undetected. Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin or ASA) is one of the most common over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, and enters the waste stream constantly. This study indirectly monitored the concentration of ASA via its pH in solution over time in the presence of soil from the Indian River Lagoon (IRL). It was hypothesized that biological material in the soil was capable of degrading ASA, and that the mean pH of dissolved ASA in the presence of IRL soil would increase significantly. Three groups were monitored for pH: dissolved ASA in distilled water, IRL soil in distilled water, and IRL soil in dissolved ASA. After the initial means were adjusted to account for a break in instrument calibration, dependent t-tests were conducted on final means versus initial means. Significant increase in the pH was detected in both the experimental group and the soil/water group. Repeated-measures ANOVA confirmed significance. The soil/water group showed a roughly oscillating pattern of increase, whereas the experimental group showed a consistent increase. Due to the significance observed in the control group, no conclusions could be drawn regarding ASA degradation. However, the different patterns of increase suggest a state of dynamic ionic equilibrium under normal conditions, with cyclic changes in pH; in the presence of soil-adsorbed organic ions such as ASA, pH may be held more constant. Thus, pH may be an indirect indicator of the proportion of organic ions present in river soil.

DIOXIDE DILEMMA

Dioxide Dilemma investigated carbon dioxide producing systems and the effects of carbon dioxide on water and plants. There is a growing concern over rising emissions of carbon dioxide, and it is well known that, as a gas, carbon dioxide is a pollutant that contributes to the greenhouse effect. However, little research has been conducted on carbon dioxide’s effect on the water cycle. Dioxide Dilemma tested how carbon dioxide from ambient air, human breath, car exhaust, fermenting yeast, and baking soda and vinegar affected the acidity of water, and how this water affected plant growth.<br><br> Carbon dioxide was collected from the five systems, with ambient air as control. The collected carbon dioxide samples were dissolved in water to form carbonic acid, which were titrated for acidity. Also, samples of these differing carbonic acid solutions were used to water onion, carnation, tomato, and watermelon seeds. The growth of the plants and the acidity of the water were both recorded and compared.<br><br> Baking soda and vinegar produced the most carbon dioxide, yet the carbon dioxide from fermenting yeast had the greatest effect plant growth. Car exhaust had the third highest carbon dioxide emissions probably due to the large amount of nitrogen present in exhaust, and this sample only modestly affected plant growth. According to this experiment, carbon dioxide emissions must be greater than any of the systems tested in order for water acidity and plant growth to be noticeably affected.<br><br>

MERCURY IN TUNA A SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC ANALYSIS UTILIZING DIPHENYLCARBAZONE
Ashley Carole Fields, Kristin Lynea Fields
Ballard High School, Louisville, KY USA

Is mercury in tuna a problem? This past summer this became the question for discussion for national news and magazines. The reason for the discussion was the Food and Drug Administration changing its recommendation on the intake of tuna for pregnant women and young children to state that they should not eat tuna at all not just limit the amount. The purpose of this research was to test locally obtained tuna to see if there were measurable amounts of mercury present.<br><br> The hypothesis for this project was if mercury is present in the tuna then the levels will be higher in Albacore tuna than light tuna. Additionally, if mercury is present in the tuna then the levels will be higher in canned tuna than vacuumed sealed tuna.<br><br> The control was a standard solution of 3 x 10-4 M Hg(NO3)2 . This solution was diluted through a serial dilution down to 10-8 M and a plot was made of the resulting data. The indicator performed well down to 10-6 M and broke down after that. <br><br> Ten tuna samples of tuna (independent variable) were digested in a Nitric/Sulfuric (70/30) solution. After the digestion process the solution was tested utilizing a Perkin Elmer UV-Vis Spectrophotometer and a diphenylcarbazone (DPC) indicator. The results were compared to a standard curve of mercury nitrate with DPC at 615 nm to detect the amount of mercury present (dependent variable). From this, it was shown that three samples, all canned Albacore, had an indication of mercury. Thus, supporting the hypothesis that albacore tuna had higher levels of mercury than chunk light and that canned tuna was higher in mercury than vacuumed sealed.<br><br>

ALUMINUM ION STABILIZES ANTHOCYANIN PIGMENT IN BASIC MEDIA

Fukuoka prefectural Chikushi highschool Fukuoka prefecture Chikushino City JAPAN

The color of the aqueous extract of the leaves of Coleus (Luminaceae family), containing a pigment of anthocyanin group, is red in acidic solution, whereas it is blue in basic solution, fades away rapidly on standing. <br><br>We found that a spot of the acidic solution accidentally dropped on a copy paper turned blue and kept a color for a long time. Analysis of the paper revealed that it is slightly basic and contains aluminum ion. While we confirmed that the discoloration is due to air oxidation of the pigment, the fact suggests we can expect color stabilizing effect or anti-oxidation effect for aluminium ion in basic solution, and this was proved. Among other metallic ions tested, Fe3+ ion was effective as well.<br><br>We thought that the effect of metallic ion should be the chelate formation with the catechol part of the pigment, thus inhibiting the oxidation. In order to confirm this point, we adopted catechol as a model compound of the plant pigment and have tried to prepare a well-defined complex compound and the color change was followed by visible absorption spectroscopy. <br><br>While a complex compound is claimed to be formed from Fe3+ and catechol anion, it seemed necessary to confirm the formation of such a complex. The spectral change was clearly observed on mixing an AlCl3 solution with the basic solution of catechol. Air oxidation became slow on addition of the AlCl3 solution to catechol. The effort of characterizing the compound formed in this treatment is in progress.<br><br>

Kaohsiung Municipal Girls' Senior High School, Kaohsiung, TAIWAN, CHINESE TAIPEI

An accurate and inexpensive home-made pressure gauge has been designed, comprising a film resistor as the central element, which is sensitive to pressure variation. A linear calibration curve for air pressure is constructed to relate the pressure to a relative voltage response of the gauge. The vapor pressures other than the air are also checked to characterize the gauge. They include several liquid samples and mixtures. Then, the gauge is applied to examine the Raoult¡¦s and Henry¡¦s laws. The former law describes that the vapor pressure of the solvent in a solution is proportional to its mole fraction, while the latter describes that the solute vapor pressure is proportional to the solute mole fraction. Temperature effects of the vapor pressure for water, ethanol, and chloroform are also measured to yield corresponding enthalpy of vaporization of 9.6+/-0.1,8.9+/-0.1, and7.2+/-0.1kcal/mol, respectively, which are consistent with those predicted values of 9.7, 9.2, and 7.5 kcal/mol. The gauge is finally applied to determine biochemical oxygen demand (B.O.D.) values in different segments of Kaohsiung Love River. The results are compared with a reference method

A NOVEL TECHNIQUE FOR THE FABRICATION OF ALGINATE MICROSPHERES FOR THE SUSTAINED RELEASE OF LIDOCAINE
Vikas Anand, Esther Kwak
Jericho High School, Jericho, NY, USA

Chronic Pain is an epidemic that affects more than 70 million people in the U.S. alone. Current drug delivery systems for local anesthetics that are used to deal with this growing problem fail to adequately control the drugs, which, with their normally short half-lives, provide a limited duration of pain control for the patient. Thus, the goal of this project was to create a controlled release of drugs to make the administration of local anesthetics easier and more efficient. The model drug employed was lidocaine: the most commonly used local anesthetic whose half-life ranges from only 1.5-2 hours. To control the release of lidocaine, alginate microspheres were fabricated via a novel emulsification process. Alginate, a structural polysaccharide from algae, is made up of alpha-L-guluronic acid and beta-D-mannuronic acid. The microspheres consistently and slowly released lidocaine for more than 30 days. A similar profile was observed when such microspheres were placed and tested in a F127 and F87 Pluronic copolymer mixture. Pluronic copolymers, though not essential components for the control of lidocaine release, are, however, advantageous materials for targeting the drugs because of their unique temperature dependent viscosity adjustable property.

NEW GENERATION SOLAR CELLS

With the decrease in the energy resources, there is a need for utilizing solar energy at the maximum level. Silicon is the most widely used element in today’s photovoltaic cells. However, the cost of energy generated through the use of these cells is higher, compared to other sources of energy. Moreover, the life of silicone-based solar cells, is not that long either, which increases the cost of energy even further. On the other hand, we know that plants have always been able to obtain energy from the Sun through photosynthesis. <br><br>After the introduction of the first organic solar cells by Graetzel, it became possible then, to create experimental environments similar to the function of the chlorophyll molecule during photosynthesis.<br><br>In this research, tetra-phenyl-porphyrin (TPP) and zinc-tetra-phenyl-porphyrin (ZnTPP) molecules were used to prepare the organic based photovoltaic cells. The voltage and the current values that are produced under various wavelengths of the light have been investigated. The impact of heat on the solar cells was also examined, because heat covers the infra-red (IR) zone and today’s solar cells cannot benefit from the energy in the infra-red zone. <br><br>In this study, heat has been observed to affect our organic solar cells. Additionally,<br><br>the voltage and current values of the cell changed as different colors or wavelengths of light were applied. It was also observed that there is no direct relation between the produced electrical energy under different wavelengths and the UV-Vis absorbance spectrum of the dye material.<br><br>

DOES THE TEMPERATURE OF VINEGAR HAVE AN EFFECT ON ITS ABILITY TO REMOVE STAINS?
Kaitlyn Amanda Rainwater, Ariel Guinn
Dreher High School, Columbia, South Carolina

Vinegar is a natural solution used for household cooking and cleaning. Vinegar avoids the problem of being chemically hazardous if absorbed by the body or being environmentally hazardous if not disposed of properly because it is a weak acid and biodegradable. Vinegar is typically diluted in water or mixed with a salt solution when used as a cleaner. This project focused solely on vinegar to directly determine the effect of temperature on vinegar's ability to remove stains. It is hypothesized that the cool temperature will best remove the stain because natural stains are commonly believed to be best removed with cold water.<br><br> In this project, white cloth squares were uniformly stained with grape juice. Each test group contained three pieces of cloth that were cleaned with vinegar of the same temperature. Five vinegar temperatures were used ranging in close proximity to vinegar's freezing point and boiling point. The gray scale color of the stain before cleaning was compared to the gray scale color after cleaning using a saturation percentage chart. The most effective temperature was determined through calculating the difference of the saturation percentage.<br><br> The results found that temperature made little difference in the efficiency of vinegar as a cleaner, unless the temperature was approaching the boiling point. The change in color for almost all temperatures varied consistently around the mean and essentially remained within one standard deviation. At the highest temperature, however, the change in color yielded results above one standard deviation above the mean indicating extreme heat promoted effectiveness.

IRON CATALYST OF POLYMERIC SCHIFF BASES FOR ETHYLENE POLYMERIZATION
Yi Hui Lim
National Junior College, Singapore, SINGAPORE

Polyolefin is a worldwide big industry, in which polyethylene is the largest, making the demand for a cost-efficient polyethylene catalyst high. Despite all the advantages the use of single site catalysts in olefin polymerization offers, the homogenous nature of these systems poses a severe technical problem known as reactor fouling which makes continuous process impossible. Recently, a new approach to prevent reactor fouling by using Fe polymeric catalyst systems was reported. However, the reported catalysts displayed low activity.<br><br><br>This project aims to synthesize a new series of polymeric Schiff bases as effective catalyst precursors for ethylene polymerization. It was hypothesized that a substituted bulky bridging spacer may have better control over the coordination of ethylene on Fe(II) centre. Hence, a catalyst bearing polymeric Schiff base structure with bulky bridges may prevent reactor fouling while displaying high activity.<br><br><br>The ligands were synthesized by Schiff-Base condensation between 2,6-diacetylpyridine and equimolar di-aniline. The coordination compounds were synthesized by incorporating FeCl2 into the individual ligands. Ethylene polymerization studies were carried out in 300mL stainless steel autoclave under 80psi ethylene pressure at 60*C in hexane. Molecular weight and polydispersity of the synthesized polyethylene were analyzed with high temperature GPC.<br><br><br>In comparison to the reported catalyst, coordination compound L3-FeCl2 with bulkiest para-substituted bridges displays a much higher activity of 581.8 KgPE/(molFe.h.bar), and GPC analysis revealed that the average molecular weight is higher (Mw = 644 000, Mn = 28 000) and polydispersity is relatively narrower (Mw/Mn = 23.0). Moreover, the new catalysts can prevent reactor fouling.

Southwestern Educational Society, Mayaguez, PUERTO RICO

The experiment presented was designed with the purpose of functionalizing CdS quantum dots with Ca2+ for heart failure detection. The motivation in designing CdS quantum dots functionalized with calcium is for detecting the presence of troponin within an environment. Troponin is a calcium binding protein. The detection of troponin is an attractive method for detecting risks of heart failure. Thus, the functionalizing of these nanostructures will in the near future save lives. <br><br> CdS quantum dots were prepared in a commercial microwave oven. The CdS quantum dots absorb light at 300 nm and between 400 and 500 nm. Ca2+ containing solutions were mixed with CdS solutions with the purpose of functionalizing them. The Ca2+ had little effect on the 300 nm absorption by the quantum dots. However, the absorption of light above 400 nm increases with the amount of calcium added to CdS containing solution. When the absorbance of the CdS quantum dots increased as the calcium concentrations increased, there was evidence that there was an interaction between CdS and (Ca2+). This interaction was demonstrated in the data of absorbance gathered.<br><br> Future goals include the use of these functionalized quantum particles for the detection of troponin, a protein that is released into the blood stream a few hours prior to a fatal heart attack.

NEW RECEPTORS BASED ON CALIXARENES
Oldrich Hudecek
Masaryk's Secondary School of Chemistry, Prague 1, CZECH REPUBLIC

The field of supramolecular chemistry involves investigation of new molecular systems in which the most important feature is that the components are held together reversibly by intermolecular forces, not by covalent bonds. Calix[n]arenes are cyclic oligomeric compounds that can be prepared by condensation reaction between formaldehyde and para-substituted phenols under basic conditions. These compounds act as molecule receptors, usable in chemosensor applications or in self-assembly processes.<br><br> This project is dealing with preparation of new isonicotinoyl derivatives of calix[4]arenes. I have concentrated on synthesis of these compounds and discovery of factors which are responsible for formation of associates. I have prepared several novel derivates bearing either unsubstituted isonicotinoyl groups (connected via amide bond) or substituted isonicotinoyl groups. The properties of these compounds were recorded and compared with one another for discovering which compounds are able to form associates in solution. <br><br>I have found that some of these derivatives generate associates in solution, connected via hydrogen bonds and I have studied their use in acting as receptors or in self-assembly processes. All of these molecules have been never prepared before. One of the most complicated parts of my project was the optimization of preparation of these compounds. In future I would like to prepare some crystals for x-ray analysis and some asymmetric compounds for other measuring.

GALVANIC CORROSION OF COPPER, IRON, ALUMINUM, AND ZINC SACRIFICIAL ANODE
Patricia Nim Dailey
Ovay Comeaux High School, Lafayette, LA

In the construction of ships, different metal pipes are assembled together to transfer liquids. The metals used for building ships and submarines undergo galvanic corrosion with their hulls and propellers submerged in sodium chloride (salt water). The salt water is the electrolyte that allows the electrons of each metal to flow from the most reactive metal (anode) to the less reactive metal (cathode). The process of dissimilar metals exchanging electrons in the presence of an electrolyte is galvanic corrosion. <br><br> The purpose of this investigation is to add a zinc sacrificial anode to the dissimilar metals of copper, iron, and aluminum to decrease the progress of galvanic corrosion. The assembled metals were tested with and without the anode into different liquids of sodium chloride and distilled water. Compared to iron, aluminum, and copper, zinc, the most reactive metal, sacrifices itself to protect the less reactive metals. An important factor to consider in the choice of the sacrificial anode is the reactivity of the dissimilar metals to be preserved. The anode needs to be the most reactive metal of all the metals involved in the reaction for it to be successful in protecting the cathodes. The experimentation resulted in the metals with the added zinc sacrificial anodes galvanized less than the metals without the anodes. In conclusion, the adding of the zinc sacrificial anodes to the dissimilar metals of iron, copper and aluminum decreased the progress of galvanic corrosion.

NEW ROUTES TO NYLON SYNTHESIS
Katherine Elizabeth Robertson
Wells Cathedral School, Wells, Somerset, UNITED KINGDOM

The aim of this study was to investigate the possbility of forming the precursor to Nylon, (X-caprolactam), within a heterogeneous catalyst using computational chemistry. Current industrial methods favour a chemically aggressive route that produces large quantities of ammonium sulphate as a by-product. The heterogenous catalyst would allow a more environmentally friendly method of producing X-caprolactam. The use of dopant-substituted Aluminophosphates (MeAPOs) as suitable substrates for the catalytic conversion of a range of cyclic-ketones to X-caprolactam molecules, were investigated. <br><br>The project involved a computational study, revealing atomic-level information on the behaviour of molecules passing through the AlPO-5 channels, specifically through cobalt doped AlPO-5, as well as ‘pure’ AlPO for comparison. The relationships between the size of the molecule, the rate and manner of diffusion and the molecule’s interaction with the active site were investigated by examining the molecule-molecule and molecule-framework interactions using Molecular Dynamics calculations. <br><br>The results suggest that AlPO-based materials are suitable catalysts, as clear interactions between the active site and diffusing molecules were observed. An ‘upper limit’ to the size of the molecule is suggested: 9-caprolactam found it difficult to migrate, due to the geometric constraints of a larger ring size. Other intrinsic properties of the molecule such as the flexibility of the molecule and the strength of the attraction to the active site also proved important in determining the rate of diffusion. To conclude, this work reveals the factors affecting the ability of the AlPO to act as a successful catalyst, and merits further computationally and experimental work.

Wilcox-Hildreth Public School, Wilcox, NE

In recent years, the cost of Plastics has been rising dramatically.<br><br>As an answer to this problem, this study is conducted to seek a solution to this problem. It was hypothesized that Solanum tubesurom Linnaes also known as potatoe is a raw material for the production of biodegradable plastic.<br><br>Biodegradable plastic was produced by using extracted starch from potato, glycerol (in the form of glycerin), baking soda and vinegar. The mixture was laid in a flat tray and was heated at a temperature of 150 degrees celsius for 7 minutes.<br><br>The plastic was tested by burning and stretching it. It was also tested with Hydrochloric acid and Sodium Hydroxide.<br><br>Results showed that the biodegradable plastic is as efficient as the commercially produced plastic. It was then concluded that the extracted starch from potato could be a raw material for the production of biodegradable plastic, which biodegradable and non - pollutant.

REPLACING THE SPECTROPHOTOMETER: A SECOND YEAR STUDY
Matthew Gage Moudy
Burkburnett High School, Burkburnett, TX

The purpose of my project this year was to determine if it would be possible to use a simple computer scanner to determine the molarity of a solution. I decided to test whether this common household item could be used to replace one of a spectrophotometers functions similarly to how my digital camera did last year. I hypothesized that it would indeed be possible to use the computer scanner to determine the molarity of a solution, using a PC and its standard programs.<br><br>Solutions of iron(II) chloride, iron(II) nitrate, copper(II) chloride and copper(II) nitrate were prepared at 1.00 M, and solutions of nickel(II) nitrate and nickel(II) chloride were used, starting at a molarity of .67. These solutions were then diluted by half serially, so that I had 1.00 M, 0.50 M, 0.25 M, and 0.125 M solutions of iron and copper, and 0.67 M, 0.335 M, 0.1675 M, and 0.08375 M for nickel. These were all then put into wells of standard depth, and scanned into a computer. <br><br>The scans were then analyzed on my home PC using standard paint/edit software on all computers. This year I used the luminosity number on the “Define Custom Color” box, which gave me much more linear results then last year’s experiment. Graphing these and creating formulas based on the best fit line allowed me to test my hypothesis on a set of unknowns. These tests had an error rate of anywhere from 2.3% to 5.9%, indicating that my hypothesis was correct.

FINGERPRINTING WITH GENIPIN: A GREEN REAGENT FOR PROTEIN DETECTION IN SOLUTION AND ON SURFACES
Shamik Mascharak
Santa Cruz High School, Santa Cruz, CA

When one touches paper, trace amounts of dead skin cells and associated proteins are transferred to the surface in the contour of fingerprints. Forensic scientists currently use Ninhydrin for on-site fingerprinting. However, Ninhydrin is quite toxic and long-term exposure can cause many ailments. Genipin, a natural product from the gardenia plant, is known to form blue dyes with amino acids and proteins. The goals of this project were to determine whether Genipin can be used as (a) an alternative to Ninhydrin for fingerprinting and (b) a qualitative/quantitative analytical reagent for amino acids/peptides/proteins in solution and on surfaces. It was hypothesized that Genipin could be used successfully for both purposes.<br><br>Dilute (mM) solutions of different amino acids were heated with ethanolic Genipin (1:1 ratio) and heated to 70 oC in a water bath. Different amino acids gave different absorption maximum around 600 nm. The intensity of the blue color was proportional to the concentration of the amino acid. Blue color was also observed with Genipin and peptides as well as proteins. Fingerprints on paper surfaces were developed with both Ninhydrin (in ethanol) and Genipin (in ethyl acetate/pet ether) and heated in a humidity chamber at 70 oC. The purple prints with Ninhydrin were very comparable to the blue ones obtained with Genipin. In addition, the Genipin prints were fluorescent when excited with a green laser (orange fluorescence).<br><br>The results clearly indicate that fingerprinting with Genipin, a "green" reagent, is reliable and easily viewed on colored surfaces due to its fluorescence.

WHAT IS THE FLAME RESISTANCE OF FABRIC?
Kevin Robert Winklepleck
Lighthouse Christian Academy, Bloomington, IN

I tested the flame resistance of fabric. I think it is beneficial for people to know which fabrics are safer. I believe that wool will be the most flame resistant because I have heard that firemen wear clothes made out of wool.<br><br>I cut swatches of fabric (2 inches by 2 inches) and set them over a flame. I then recorded how long it took for the pieces of fabric to catch on fire and how long it took for the fabric to consume itself. I did this with about 12 different types of fabric. <br><br>Out of my samples, wool took the longest to catch fire and denim took the longest to completely burn. If you want a fabric that is flame resistant longer you should choose wool. If you are looking for a fabric that takes the longest to burn you should choose denim. The least safe fabrics were fleece and nylon. These fabrics melted and made a sticky substance. If someone wearing one of these fabrics caught on fire they would be in great danger because the fabric would melt and stick to their skin. Out of these two, nylon is the most dangerous because whenever the flame was held close to it, the nylon would melt and shrivel away in a matter of seconds. Even though wool proved to be the most flame resistant in my tests, it was not completely resistant to flame. One should never go near an open flame without the proper safety measures.

THE STUDY OF THE RELEASE RATE OF TRIMETHYLXANTHINE (C8H10N4O2) IN CERTAIN CHEWING GUMS, PHASE II
Hannah Marie Scudder
North Daviess Junior/Senior High School, Elnora, IN

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the percentage and release rate of caffeine within certain periods of time.<br><br>Seven chewing gums were tested for their caffeine content. An artificial saliva solution and a centrifuge were used to reenact the chewing process. The ratio of time to saliva was one minute to one milliliter. The ratio of saliva to chloroform in milliliters was two to one. The chewing gum and saliva put into a test tube were run through the centrifuge for the appropriate amount of time; the saliva from the test tube placed into a beaker, where the correct ratio of chloroform was added. A separation funnel was used to extract the chloroform and caffeine into another beaker. Then, the chloroform evaporated, and the caffeine remaining was measured. The process was repeated ten times for each chewing. The percentage and release rate of caffeine released were calculated. The Penguin brands released about 70% within 45 minutes which is .11 mg/min. The Pepp brands released around 40% within 25 minutes which is <br><br>1.15 mg/min. The Jolt brands released about 22% within 5 minutes which is 2.00 mg/min. The release rate decreased with increased time.

POLYMER INITIATORS FOR REDUCING SHRINKAGE AND INCREASING CURE OF DENTAL FILLING RESINS
Nga Man Tang
Northside Health Careers High School, San Antonio, TX

The primary aim of this project was to address the composite resin’s tendency to shrink after its application to the oral cavity. It is known that shrinkage is a side effect resulting from excessive stress produced during application as the intermolecular spaces are eliminated by molecules’ bonding.<br><br> Specimens are composed of controlled variables with C6-tbutyl-dimethacrylate (tBuC6DMA) liquid crystal monomers, TS-530 microfiller, and foundation filler. The experimental photoinitiation system was composed of camphorquinone (CQ), 1-phenyl-1,2-propandione (PPD), and dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA). Different ratios of concentrations were tested to investigate the optimum combination that would achieve lowest shrinkage. <br><br> Shrinkage was determined by visually recording the change of volume of the specimen over a period of 2 hours by the means of Acuvol. Results suggested the general trend of 2% decrease in shrinkage compared to control, the standard composite resin (GTE). However, there were fluctuations among the data, suggesting a further study with supportive manipulate variables.<br><br> Degree of conversion (DC), the rate of resin’s reaction, was also tested as the secondary goal using a Fourier Transformation Infrared Spectrometer, which detected changes of chemical bonds and provided statistical results. Compared to GTE, it was observed that DC trended from a high around 60% to around 70%.<br><br> In conclusion, the results of this experiment gave a preliminary insight that suggested certain ratio (2.0 wt. % DMAEMA, 1.0-2.0 wt. % CQ, and 0.5-2.0 wt. % PPD) of the experimental photoinitiation system has effectively reduced shrinkage and increased DC.

IMPROVE HOMEMADE DEVELOPING CHEMICALS
Joani Nicole Lindsay
West Noble High School, Ligonier, IN

Purpose of this experiment is to determine if developing film with coffee will make a negative, and if so, how to improve the quality of the image using this process. Another benefit to this alternative process will be a decrease in the amount of money spent on chemicals and a decrease in the toxicity of the developing process. My hypothesis is that the image would develop and that the quality would improve with an increase in developing time. The constants and controls in my experiment were the commercial developing process and the resulting image. The independent variables were the alternative developing process and the development time of the image. The dependent variable was the negative image that was produced. I measured the dependent variable by seeing the difference in the quality of the image as compared to the commercially processed image. The results of the experiment were that it was possible to develop a photograph using this process and that as the developing time increased, the overall quality of the negative improved. The negative that developed for fifty minutes had the highest percentage of quality. Its developing proved to be double the quality of the twenty-five minute developing and close to the quality of the commercial chemical developers. The results indicated that my hypothesis that the image would develop and that the quality would improve with an increase in developing time was correct. Additional research would be to supplement other household chemicals to make the developing take even less time.

FUNDAMENTAL INSIGHT INTO CARBON NANOTUBE/SOLVENT INTERACTIONS LEADS TO THE DISCOVERY OF A NOVEL METHOD FOR MAXIMIZING SOLUBILITIES IN GENERAL
Philip Vidal Streich
Homeschool, Platteville, WI

Fully understanding and improving how nanoparticles such as carbon nanotubes and graphene can be thermodynamically dissolved is at the heart of successfully using nanomaterials in real-world applications. For example, only thermodynamically dissolved nanotubes retain their super-properties in stable forms suitable for revolutionary applications. Similarly, the major obstacle to utilizing graphene has been its apparent and assumed insolubility. In the first year of this research, carbon nanotubes were proven to be thermodynamically soluble in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent. However, the problem remained that NMP dissolves only a small amount of nantotubes, making it inefficient for applications. Furthermore, the physical and chemical reasons for this solubility remained elusive.<br><br> In this year’s research, a fundamental relationship between solubility and solvent surface tension was uncovered. A novel methodology was then discovered for maximizing nanotube solubility by systematically tuning the solvent's surface tension by mixing solvents so as to match the nanotube’s intrinsic surface energy and thereby optimize the nanotube-solvent-intermolecular interaction. Consequently, a new solvent mix of N-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidone (CHP) and N-ethyl-2-pyrrolidone (NEP) was discovered to thermodynamically dissolve over an order of magnitude more nanotubes than NMP. This methodology was then extended to thermodynamically dissolve graphite, for the first time ever, to produce unmodified graphene sheets. These findings may be the key to efficiently utilizing nanotubes and graphene in ultra-strong and ultra-conductive materials. Moreover, the solvent-tuning methodology could be fundamental in systematically maximizing the solubilities of materials in general and in potentially optimizing the strength and stability of materials ranging from nanoparticle-composites to plastics, even to plywood.

EFFICIENT HYDROGEN PRODUCTION USING CU-ZN-AL CATALYSTS PREPARED BY HOMOGENEOUS PRECIPITATION METHOD
Yi-Han Su
Taipei First Girls High School, Taipei, CHINESE TAIPEI

In industry, high-activity catalyst is desirable for methanol reforming reaction in order to generate hydrogen efficiently. In this project, multi-composition Cu-Zn-Al catalyst was synthesized by homogeneous precipitation (HP) method with urea treatment. In comparison with those obtained from conventional co-precipitation method, our technique offers an opportunity to improve the homogeneity of metal mixing and to increase the surface area of catalysts. By adjusting urea concentration, water amount, reaction temperature and time, various hydrotalcite-like compounds are obtained. The optimized catalysts having flower-like morphology, exhibited high surface area (78.5 m^2/g, as determined by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method), and a lower reduction temperature. The HP-method derived Cu-Zn-Al catalyst exhibited higher methanol-conversion, hydrogen-production-rate and CO2-selectivity under methanol reforming reaction at 523K compared with those derived by co-precipitation method. To further improve the catalytic performance of the Cu-Zn-Al, Ce and Zr were employed to modify the support. The Ce/Zr-modified catalysts did show higher activity, as evidenced by a 20K lower reduction temperature and more than 85% of methanol conversion. Our method can be generalized for the synthesis of other multi-composition materials with high homogeneity.

THE CONTROLLED RELEASE OF LIPASE FROM PCL ELECTROSPUN FIBERS

I discovered that membranes created with the PEG-PCL micelles have successfully controlled degradation rates as shown by linear graphical trendlines. This inexpensive method of speeding and controlling the degradation process in plastics may directly impact society economically and environmentally.<br><br>Poly(caprolactone) (PCL) is an inexpensive, biodegradable synthetic polyester thats use has become popular in modern studies because of its non-toxicity, immunogenicity and environmental-friendliness. It is commonly used in the fields of agriculture, bioengineering and medicinal therapy in the form of electrospun membranes.<br><br> The only drawback limiting PCL from further applications is its several year long degradation period. The enzyme lipase has been added to the polymer to break the ester bonds of PCL and hasten the degradation process. However drug release with this new and shorter degradation period is uncontrolled and must be stabilized if PCL is to be used as a drug delivery system in the body. This project hypothesized that a novel mechanism of using poly(ethylene glycol)-PCL (PEG-PCL) copolymer micelles to encapsulate the lipase would stabilize the rate of degradation.<br><br> The PEG-PCL copolymer was synthesized through ring-opening polymerization and confirmed through IR Spectrum and H-NMR by trained lab members. PCL membranes with PEG-PCL micelles and varying concentrations of lipase were produced. SEMs ensured uniformity of the fibers and tensile tests verified their mechanical properties. Smaller membrane samples were degraded over a set time period. Percent weight loss was graphed to calculate their correlation coefficients and SEM visuals were repeated for comparison of the degraded samples.<br><br> A linear trendline showed that the membranes created with the PEG-PCL micelles successfully controlled degradation rates. This inexpensive method of speeding and controlling the degradation process in plastics may directly impact society economically and environmentally.

REDUCING FORMATION OF SCALE WITH MAGNETIC DESCALER
Maria Orb
Jogeva Co-Educational Gymnasium, Jogeva, ESTONIA

The objective of the research was to explore the impact of magnetic treatment of water on the formation of scale. <br><br>Research was conducted in Jõgeva, a small town in Estonia. The water in the water supply in Jõgeva is hard, therefore heating of water causes a lot of scale. For the research industrial magnetic descaler and a homemade scale preventer made of old computer hard discs were used. To compare the formation of deposit non-treated water and water treated in the magnetic descaler were heated. To ensure that samples can cause an equal amount of deposits, titration with HCl was performed before and after heating to determine carbonate hardness. After the heating the flasks were weighed, the difference in masses showed the formation of deposit. <br><br>Test results showed that magnetic descaler reduces scaling. Heating of non-treated water left 0.33 g of sediment, heating of water descaled with industrial 0.04 g (8.3 times less) and heating of water treated with home-made magnetic device 0.09 g of sediment (3.7 times less).<br><br>As water is quite hard in Jõgeva, it is advisable to use the devices that prevent the formation of scale. The comparison of the performance of magnetic devices and other methods as reducers of scale formation shows that permanent magnetic devices are the most beneficial – they are maintenance-free and maintain their magnetic properties for decades. Using old hard discs to make scale preventers would be a good opportunity to find an application for the components of old hard discs.

PINACOLONE CONSERVATION IN A MULTI-STEP SYNTHETIC CYCLE
Hannah Lloyd
Ogden High School, Ogden, UT

Reduction, dehydration, oxidation, and carbocation rearrangements are common pathways explored in student organic chemistry laboratories. Literature procedures exist for each of these reaction types. These steps could be linked into a cycle that would allow organic substrate to be recovered, minimizing toxic waste and reagent expenses. This project investigates the possibility of recycling pinacolone, the beginning reactant and the end product in the proposed four-step reaction cycle. Pinacolone was reduced with sodium borohydride to 3,3-dimethylbutan-2-ol, which was then dehydrated with phosphoric acid yielding mostly 2,3-dimethybut-2-ene (the Zaitzev product after carbocation rearrangement). After distillation, the 2,3-dimethylbut-2-ene was oxidized to pinacol with hydrogen peroxide in formic acid (solvent). Pinacol rearrangement into pinacolone with sulfuric acid completed the reaction cycle with conservation of the original carbon and hydrogen atoms. Product masses were measured, and theoretical and percent yields were calculated for each step. Purities were verified with capillary gas chromatography and infrared spectroscopy. This process shows promise for recycling a large fraction of the pinacolone, although yields are not optimal in all reactions.

A NOVEL THERMODYNAMIC MODEL FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF MULTI-WALLED CARBON NANOTUBES
Christopher Allen Zimmerman
Muhlenberg High School, Laureldale, PA

Herein, a novel thermodynamic model for the synthesis of multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs) from hydrocarbon precursors has been developed and tested to aid in the understanding of the synthesis mechanism. The new model incorporates the geometric aspects of the catalyst, the MWNT, and the substrate. This model successfully predicted the synthesis rate and time and the effects of precursor impact rate. It was computationally verified using finite element method analysis (Algor Systems V20 software) and experimentally verified by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Synthesis is driven more by a catalyst concentration gradient than by temperature; precursor pressure also determines the synthesis rate, according to equations. CVD was performed about a silicon substrate and variable catalysts, which were prepared with soft lithography and polydimethylsiloxane stamping. The MWNTs grown by the CVD process were analyzed using Raman spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis, and transmission electron microscopy.<br><br> The body centered cubic form of iron [Fe(bcc)] is a more efficient catalyst than nickel [Ni(ccp)] due to its increased surface area. Hydrocarbon precursors with bicyclical-, cyclical-, and chain-structures were tested to determine the importance of the molecular structure and carbonyl (C=O) oxygen atoms in MWNT synthesis. Camphor (C10H16O) was found to be 1.734 times more efficient than acetylene (C2H2) as a precursor. Similar purities of CNTs (as defined by ID/IG, the ratio of the intensities of the “G” and “D” band peaks in Raman spectra, which inherently compares sp3 and sp2 bonds) and synthesis times suggest that efficiency is not related to precursor molecular structure. The formation rate independent of precursor molecular structure indicates that MWNTs are formed via a precursor Decomposition Mechanism. The efficacy of Fe(bcc) around the Curie point (770°C) declined, inferring that the catalyst’s magnetic domain structure below that temperature may interfere with MWNT synthesis. The incorporation of geometric and chemical properties of the substrate, catalyst, and precursor into the model presents a novel and accurate way of modeling MWNT synthesis. This method has applications to commercial and governmental materials research from artificial muscles to combat jackets.

THE EFFECT OF LAYER-BY-LAYER METHOD ON ATTACHMENT OF GOLD NANOPARTICLES
Shuang Rebecca Chen
Benjamin Franklin High School, New Orleans, LA

The experiment tested the layer-by-layer method on the directed assembly of gold colloid onto PDDA polymers under certain current flow and deposition conditions. It explored the absorbance property of nanocomposite structures, while their procedure of assembly was kept the same. PDDA layers were successfully coated by the color identification, but gold nanoparticles were not found in the built structure. <br><br> A 5cm-by-5cm quartz glass slide was attached to a metal piece and immersed in solution for 10 minutes. Due to an electric current machine putting 6.0 V charge through two metal pieces and switching its outlets to enable opposite charges every coating, the aqueous particles should attach to the slide. The absorbance value of the finished slides(gold, magnetite, and magnetite & gold), subject to visible light 800 nm to 350 nm, were tested in a 500 scan spectrophotometer. Key peaks could identify the gold at 550 nm to 650 nm wavelengths and magnetite at 450 nm, for they absorb a specific segment of the spectrum in order to reflect a complementary color to the naked eye.<br><br> The peaks in the graphs were nearly identical and could not isolate a single peak for gold recognition. A good topic for analysis could be overall shift in the absorbance value for the slides.<br><br> The experiment demonstrated the layer-by-layer method that is becoming more and more useful today for nanotechnology and contributed the invalidation of creation gold nanocomposites through layer-by-layer in certain conditions.

CHEMICAL COMPARISON OF THE RELATIVE EFFICIENCY OF THE BAYER SYNTHESIS AND THE 2-HYDROXYMETHYLPHENOL-B-D-GLUCOPYRANOSIDE-BASED SYNTHESIS OF ASPIRIN WITH A FOCUS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF GREEN CHEMISTRY
Bradley Thomas Falk
Cherry Creek High School, Greenwood Village, CO

The goal of this project was to develop an alternatve synthesis method for aspirin that uses 2-hydroxymethylphenol-B-D-glucopyranoside as a base compound instead of the usual reagents. The efficiency of the synthesis method was compared to the Bayer method as a benchmark and was analyzed using stoichiometric calculations, percent purity, and an the twelve principles of green chemistry.<br><br>Laboratory standard organic synthesis procedures were used to formulate aspirin including fractional distillation. The purity was analyzed qualitatively from melting point determination and acid-base titrations. To analyze the principles of green chemistry the EPA's Green Chemistry Expert System was used to: calculate the amount of waste, determine the areas of concern associated with the reaction, and identify areas that could be improved.<br><br>Based on the twelve principles of green chemistry it was discoverred that the alternative synthesis method produced 100% waste as a percent of production volume. Furthermore, it produces 92% yield on average and had a percent purity of approximately 99%. The alternative synthesis method was determined to have 49.4% atom economy. From the Green Chemistry Expert System it was determined that the areas of concern for the synthesis are related to the significant quantities of Tier 3 chemicals present and excessive total waste.<br><br>The excessive waste present and the low atom economy mitigate the overall effectiveness of the synthesis even though it follows many of the other principles of green chemistry. However, the stoichiometric data and identity of the waste products seem to suggest that the glucose and water could be reused in the synthesis, thus reducing the amount of total waste and increasing the atom economy.

This research is devoted to synthesis of carbohydrate-dodecaborate conjugates as potential agents for boron neutron capture therapy of cancer (BNCT). However, only few carbohydrate derivatives of closo-dodecaborate anion have been described so far [1]. <br><br>Boron neutron capture therapy of cancer is based on selective introduction of stable boron-10 isotope into a tumor cell, followed by irradiation with a beam of thermal neutrons. At this moment only two compounds are used in practical therapy. They are sodium mercapto-closo-dodecaborate and 4-dihydroxyborylphenylalanine. But both of them have some imperfections – both of them have insufficient selectivity to tumor cells. So at this moment the efforts are to increase selectivity of boron compounds. <br><br>The last generation agents for BNCT contains transport part (biomolecule) and borate part (polyhedral boron compound). It is proposed that use of conjugates of boron compounds with a various carbohydrates could increase selectivity of delivery of boron-10 to tumor cells. The conjugate consists of two parts: carbohydrate and borate. One part of molecule includes boron atoms and another one delivers agent into a cell. The borate part is closo-dodecaborate anion, which was chosen because it contains 12 boron atoms and has low toxicity and good solubility in water. Carbohydrates are used to increase selectivity of delivery to tumor cells. Lactose, a known ligand of lectines on the surface of melanoma cells, was chosen as a representative example of carbohydrate part. <br><br>Copper(I)-catalyzed [2+3]-cycloaddition reaction (“click chemistry”[2]) between terminal alkyne and azide was chosen as a method of conjugation. Example of a conjugate presented on a picture.

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PH LEVEL AND THE CONCENTRATION OF SOLUBLE METALS IN THE LAKES OF TENNESSEE
Scott Elliott Coleman
Westview High School, Martin, TN

The purpose of this experiment is to determine the relationship between the pH level and the concentration of soluble metals in the lakes of Tennessee.<br><br> It is predicted that the lower the pH level of the lake water the higher the concentration of heavy metals contained in the water samples, because metals become more soluble in acidic solutions.<br><br> To begin 500mL of water was gathered from two sites of twelve Tennessee Lakes. The digital pH meter stick was calibrated. The pH level was determined for each sample and recorded in a chart. A heavy metals test kit was used to test three samples from each lake site. A test strip was dipped in a sample of 20mL for thirty seconds. The strip was removed and after two minutes the color of the test strip was compared to the test strip chart. The ppb unit matching the corresponding color was recorded in a chart. The test was repeated for each sample, using a new sample of 20mL each time and recording the results on the chart for a total of six tests for each lake and a total of 72 tests altogether. <br><br> The experiment showed that the lower the pH levels, the higher the concentration of heavy metals contained in the water samples. The lakes with lower pH levels tended to have higher ppb values and the lakes with higher pH levels tended to have lower ppb values.

MICRO-RUSTING: THE EFFECT OF MICROBIAL FERMENTATION ON OXIDATION
Samantha Jo Fleming
Syracuse High School, Syracuse, UT

Corrosion is a serious problem caused by the oxidation of metals that leads to economic and safety concerns. My purpose of conducting this experiment was to see the effect of microorganisms on the process of iron oxidization. Three different types of microorganisms, lactobacillus acidophilus, yeast and algae were tested. An iron nail that was half sanded was exposed to the microorganisms and distilled water in a glass container. Samples were observed over 48 hours. The algae was the only microorganism to make the nail rust. On each observation the amount of rust on the nail in the algae container increased. The containers with lactobacillus acidophilus and yeast did not rust the nail. This is due to fermentation which uses oxygen and turns it into carbon dioxide, preventing rust. If lactobacillus acidophilus and yeast could be alloyed onto metals, they could take the oxygen away from the metal preventing metal from rusting. This would stop the serious problems with iron oxidization. Additional research is needed to establish a method of using these results to prevent rust from forming in common settings.

TO EVAPORATE OR NOT TO EVAPORATE? THAT IS THE QUESTION
Tyler Andrew Phelps
Syracuse High School, Syracuse, UT

Moisture retention in fabrics can be detrimental to a wearer when evaporation would optimize cooling effects of perspiration. In this project different fabrics were tested to determine how the composition of each fabric affects evaporative properties. Evaporative properties are commonly referred to as "breathability".<br><br>A variety of fabrics were tested by filling five clear wide mouth jars each with 300 mL of water and covering them with these fabrics. These jars were placed in an area so they all could obtain the same amount of light. <br><br>The result showed how effective some fabrics were in allowing water to evaporate when others retained it more. Different fabrics will allow more or less water to evaporate through them because of their different composition. Breathability depended on whether they were tighter knit or looser knit and not their thickness. The fabric denim was thicker in comparison to the silk fabric, but silk retained more water because it was a finer fabric and has tighter knit. Nylon was the loosest fabric in composition so it allowed more water to escape. <br><br>Based on the data and observations collected, different fabrics are better suited for different temperatures and places. Nylon allowed more water to escape because of the greater amount of space between the threads. So this would be a better fabric to use in hotter temperatures. Silk however let the least amount of water escape, because the threads were tighter knit. So in colder temperatures it is better to wear silk to retain more heat.

JUST SAY "NO": A NOVEL DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR THE BIOREGULATORY AGENT NITRIC OXIDE
Camden Y Miller
Allen High School, Allen, TX

The importance of Nitric Oxide (NO) in several facets of human physiology has led to greater interest in producing materials that can release NO in a controlled manner. The ability to control the release of NO can provide a means to regulate physiological processes, provide a solution for poor circulation in diabetics, stimulating hair follicles in order to increase hair growth, as well as to preserve organs and tissues. This study will show that the release of NO can be controlled by adjusting polymer surface types; a porous fiber will release NO at a faster rate than a nonporous fiber.<br><br> 1-Hydroxy-2-oxo-3,3-bis(2-aminoethyl)-1-triazene (DETA-NO) was synthesized and added to a biodegradable polymer producing a NO-releasing material. The process of electrospinning was used to produce a free-standing paper consisting of aligned fibers that are easily manipulated. During the process of electrospinning, the porosity of the fibers was able to be controlled. By creating a free standing paper it allows versatility for use in medical devices, containers or bandages for transplant organs, as well as textiles for improved circulation in diabetic patients.<br><br> A new method was developed and an apparatus was created in order to accurately measure the rate of release of NO. By using the apparatus that was created, the porosity of the fibers was found to affect the rate of release; thus, showing that fiber morphology does play a role in the release of NO.

CHLORINE LEVEL IN WATER SYSTEMS
Alexandra Beatrice Buczek
Camden County High School, Kingsland, GA

The purpose of this study is to test the chlorine level in drinking water at the treatment source and at similar measured distances along the water system loops of Kings Bay, Kingsland and Saint Marys, and compare similarities in levels, distance, retention, and refresh times. The chlorine levels will show an incremental decline the further away from the source the testing is conducted.<br><br> Disinfection Byproducts (DBPs) are a natural occurrence formed by free chlorine in the water system. DBP formation is effected by several factors including amount of chlorine introduced into the system, retention, refresh and usage while keeping within the strict guidelines established by the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Georgia Department of Natural Resources.<br><br> Three separate samples were taken from the water systems over a three-month period to determine Cl2 level measurements at similar distances to determine if the samples revealed an incremental decline the further away from the treatment source the samples were taken. Although not all test sites were in similar measured distances to each other, those that were, were compared for similar Cl2 levels, approximate retention, refresh and the amount of customers on that particular loop. <br><br> The hypothesis was supported in that chlorine levels do decline the further away from treatment source samples were taken. Although anomalies occurred resulting in spikes or decreases along the systems, they were explainable.

AN ANALYSIS OF THE INSECTICIDE IMIDACLOPRID IN VARIOUS PLANT SPECIES
Conner Harper
American Fork High School, American Fork, UT

The purpose of my experimentation was to determine the amount of an insecticide, imidacloprid, absorbed by various plant species, particularly those that are commonly eaten. Imidacloprid is hazardous to human health and functions as a systemic insecticide. I attempted to find if the degree absorbed by the plants was at a degree that would represent a threat to human health. To do this, I grew several samples of each plant and applied the insecticide at incremental levels of the recommended dosage. After the plants matured to some degree, I performed a organic extraction using methanol as my solvent. Once I thoroughly dissolved the organic material in the plant, I used a roto-vap machine to evaporate the methanol from the solution, leaving only the organic residue. I reconstituted the residue of each sample in a standard amount of methanol and took a small amount for testing in the mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer yielded a mass spectrum, which showed if and to what degree the imidacloprid was present in each sample. Using this data, I determined how much imidacloprid was in each plant in terms of parts per million and found that it was an amount significant enough to represent a danger to human consumption.

THE EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON CHLOROPHYLL
Benjamin Ryan Yawakie
Breck School, Minneapolis, MN

The purpose of my project was to study temperatures effect on Chlorophyll in different types of vegetables: broccoli, spinach, and lettuce. This research is important because chlorophyll has been shown to reduce the risk of cancer, treat slow-healing wounds, and decrease DNA damages in the liver. By freezing, heating, and leaving the vegetables at room temperature, I wanted to discover the best way to prepare vegetables. I first separated each batch of fresh vegetables into three groups. I heated the first set of vegetables in a microwave for two minutes at full power. I placed the second set into a freezer for two hours at -10° C. I left the third set at room temperature at 21° C for two hours. Results showed the room temperature spinach had the highest absorbance at 450 nm while heated spinach had the lowest absorbance at 450 nm. Frozen lettuce had the highest level of absorbance at 450 nm while room temperature lettuce had the least absorbance at 450 nm. Room temperature broccoli had the highest absorbance at 450 nm and the heated batch had the least absorbance. For both broccoli and spinach, the highest levels of chlorophyll were retained at room temperature state while the opposite was true for lettuce. So for lettuce, the best way to prepare it would be to freeze it. The next step in my research would be to freeze and heat the vegetables longer to check long-term effects of temperature on these vegetables.

EVALUATING FUMED SILICA COMPOSITE POLYMER ELECTROLYTES ON THE EFFICIENCY AND SURFACE CHEMISTRY OF A SOLID-STATE BATTERY AT THE NANOPARTICLE LEVEL
Nathan Henry Kneeland
Miami High School, Miami, OK

Nanoelectromechanical systems have great potential in commercial motors, pumps, relays, and other components. One such power system that has been relatively unstudied at the nano level is the battery. Research in batteries utilizes an electrolyte that is placed between two electrodes. Many types of electrolytes can be utilized for this experiment, but a composite polymer electrolyte (CPE) will be studied. A CPE is an electrolyte that contains either hydrophobic or hydrophilic fumed silica, lithium salts and a polymer, in this case, poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), respectively. The goal of this project is to investigate the fundamental issues pertaining to the use of surface-modified fumed silica to formulate novel electrolytes in PEO using fumed silica in the presence of lithium salts. This experiment focuses on the amorphous crystallinity of the PEO polymer to increase capacitance and decrease resistance by adding fumed silica. This project focuses on both LiCoO2 and SnO2 for the anode and cathode, PEO(1,000,000) that will be the solid-state electrolyte and PEG(400) that will act as the liquid-state electrolyte for ionic comparisons. Results of the AC Impedance experiment showed that the CPE did decrease both ionic and electrical resistance but at the same time decreased capacitance. The CPE fully ionized faster than the PEO electrolyte, meaning that the ions move for a shorter time period, therefore less degradation will occur. Results of the Atomic Force Microscope experiment showed that the fumed silica has a direct effect on the surface chemistry of the electrolyte. Fumed silica shrunk the formations on the surface of the electrolyte called sphereolytes, making them less defined and giving the electrolyte more channels for ionic and electrical travel, thus having a direct influence on decreasing resistance. Results of the Kiethley charge/discharge experiment showed that the slopes of the discharge lines were closer to zero than the control, meaning the new system holds a charge longer than the control as well as a more consistent decrease in slopes, suggesting that this system is more reliable than the control.

POLYMORPHISM OF MOLYBDENUM OXIDE OBTAINED BY POLYMER-ASSISTED SONOCRYSTALLIZATION
Shyam Brihan Rajan
Half Hollow Hills High School West, Dix Hills, NY

The Properties of molybdenum oxide are transformed when obtained by polymer-assisted synthesis. PEO-derivates were dissolved in peroxomolybdate precursor solution to "template" the properties of the molybdenum oxide precipitate. Concentration of polymer was changed from 1.0 g/L, 10.0 g/L, and 100.0 g/L for investigation of the effect of increased [EO]:[Mo]. It was determined that EO reduces MoVI to MoV. X-ray diffraction indicated the presence of polymorphisms through the change of monohydrate to hemihydrate phased when synthesized with polymer; crystallization was altered from triclinic to monoclinic. Thermogravimetric analysis indicated mass loss derived from decomposition of hydration water and remaining polymer. SEM showed differing crystal structures; "templated" samples emerged as truncated spheres and/or fibers, as opposed to the lack of ordered structure in the triclinic crystal. The reactive capability of the samples was compared by UV-visible absorption spectra after leaving 0.01 g molybdenum oxide in 10-3 M Safranin O or methyl orange dye for a specified time; triclinic monohydrate sample was found to be most efficient at dye degradation, but all samples obtained decolorized dye more efficiently than commercial MoO3.

PREDICTION OF TOTAL SOLUBLE SOLIDS IN RIPE MANGOES BASED ON ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE MEASUREMENT
Lemuel Andrew Toyhacao Diamante
Visayas State University Laboratory High School, Baybay, Leyte, PHILIPPINES

At present, there is no method of determining the degree of ripeness of mangoes in terms the total soluble solids (TSS) content of ripe mangoes prior to processing without taking out the pulp from the fruit. There is also no method that relates electrical resistance of mango ripening to its TSS. The objective of the study is to relate electrical resistance of ripe mangoes to TSS. <br><br>An electrical multimeter was used in determining the electrical resistance in Ohms and a hand refractometer in determining the TSS content in degrees Brix of Carabao mangoes with different degree of ripeness.<br><br>The results show that as the mango ripens the electrical resistance and total soluble solids increase. These data were fitted with linear, logarithmic, exponential, and power regression equations. While these different equations can satisfactorily predict the TSS of ripe mangoes, the best fitting was found to be the logarithmic regression equation (TSS=-211.03585+61.17474 log R), which gave the highest coefficient of determination (r squared) and the lowest mean relative percentage difference (MRPD).<br><br>The results of this study will have a practical application since the measurement of electrical resistance of mangoes with different degree of ripeness will be sorted to within a range 4780-5550 ohms, which corresponds to TSS range of 14-18 degrees Brix that industry uses for quality puree making. This prediction method is a cheap and non-destructive alternative in determining the TSS of ripe mangoes.

MULTIPLE ANALYTE IMPRINTING IN ONE MONOMER MOLECULARLY IMPRINTED POLYMERS VS. TRADITIONAL MOLECULARLY IMPRINTED POLYMERS
Andrew C. Meng
Louisiana State University Laboratory School, Baton Rouge, LA

One monomer molecularly imprinted polymers (OMNiMIPs) have improved binding and selective properties as opposed to traditionally formulated EGDMA/MAA imprinted polymers. Monomers' capabilities of imprinting multiple species was investigated by synthesizing polymers using these two systems. Two templates, (R)-(+)-1,1'-bi-2-naphthol and BOC-L-tyrosine were simultaneously imprinted, and enantioselectivity compared to polymers imprinted with one template at a time. The simultaneously imprinted OMNiMIP exhibited only 6.3% and 21.1% loss in enantioselectivity for these two templates respectively, versus the OMNiMIPs imprinting one template at a time. For the EGDMA/MAA imprinted polymers, enantioselectivity was found only for (R)-(+)-1,1'-bi-2-naphthol, with 59.1% loss in enantioselectivity found for the multiple-template imprinted polymer versus the single template polymer. Imprinting two templates simultaneously leads to better enantioselective performance than physically mixed particles of polymers imprinting one template at a time. For example, the anantioselectivity of (R)-(+)-1,1'-bi-2-naphthol on the simultaneously imprinted polymer gave a separation factor value of 4.4 while the mixed-particle column gave a value of 2.6. Collectively, the results illustrate that imprinting mixtures of templates simultaneously is the method of choice, especially for OMNiMIPs, for producing multi-analyte molecular recognition in imprinted polymers.

PURIFICATION OF FUCOIDAN FROM HIJIKI (HIZIKIA FUSIFORME) AND KOMBU (LAMINARIA JAPONICA) SEAWEEDS
Faustine R.S. Sonon
Cedar Shoals High School, Athens, GA

In the previous year, the study determined the type and sugar composition of fucoidan found in Hizikia fusiforme, however, the extraction methods followed produced a significant amount of glucose in the extract indicating that this sugar could have come from another polysaccharide, laminaran. The purpose of the current study is to fractionate fucoidan from other polysaccharides in the cell wall of algae. Two seaweed species, Hijiki (Hizikia fusiforme) and Kombu (Laminaria japonica) were used in the study. The seaweeds were ground, washed with 80% aqueous ethanol, depigmented and delipidized with chloroform:methanol (1:1) and acetone until no color was coming off. Decolorized cell wall was added subsequently with hydrochloric acid solution (pH = 2.0) to extract the polysaccharides. The extracts were passed through a sepharose gel column and four fractions (eluates) were collected by elution with 0.1 M NaCl, 1.0 M NaCl, 1.5 M NaCl, and 2.0 M NaCl solutions in Tris-HCl buffer (20 mM, pH ~8.0). The eluates were analyzed for monosaccharide (GC-MS) and sulfate composition. Fucose and galactose were present in fractions 1 through 3 of Hijiki and in fractions 2 and 3 in Kombu. Also, sulfate ion was detected in fractions 1 through 3 of both Hijiki and Kombu. The presence of fucose and sulfate is a typical characteristic of the polysaccharide, fucoidan.

WHAT FACTORS INFLUENCE VISCOSITY? 
Michael Joseph Schepis
Our Lady of Lourdes High School, Poughkeepsie, NY

<br><br>The purpose of this investigation was to understand and investigate the phenomena that effect viscosity and to determine if viscosity is an inherent property of a substance. This study explored trends in the recorded velocity of a metal ball bearing which transverses though a liquid at different temperatures and concentrations. The hypothesis of this investigation was that the phenomena of viscosity are not inherent properties of the substance but are properties of more complex variables than just physical phase changes. The samples tested were both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids, including liquids that display thixotropic properties. In Newtonian liquids, the effects of temperature were not significant, but in non-Newtonian liquids, temperature played a significant role. A unique method was employed to measure the viscosity of opaque fluids. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

SURVEY OF VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS IN PVC AND PET BOTTLES USING GC-MS WITH SOLID PHASE MICROEXTRACTION
Sung-Hyun Kim
duPont Manual High School, Louisville, KY

Plastics have long been suspected of leaching harmful substances such as phthalates, bisphenol-A, and other dioxins. This study is a qualitative analysis of compounds leached from heated PET and PVC plastic water bottles (71C) as well as those left in room temperature (21.5C). The volatile organic compounds (VOC) were identified using a GC-MS with SPME. Several methods were used to extract compounds from the headspace and water of the water bottle. To extract compounds from water, direct immersion of SPME fiber in water sample and headspace of water sample using NaCl and heat was used.To extract compounds from the headspace of the bottle, the SPME fiber was exposed to the headspace within the bottle. Using direct headspace method, carbamic acid; cyclohexene 4-tert-butyl, and 2-decenal compounds were found in the heated PVC bottles. Using direct headspace method, 1-decanol, 2-ethyl; 2, 2-dimethyl-3-ethylpentane; and other petroleum based compounds were found in the heated PET. The results for PET were not surprising since PET is made up of ethylene and paraxylene which are compounds from petroleum refining. None of the bottles in room temperature had any compound leaching. The methods targeting VOC in the water of the water bottle did not detect chemical leaching in both heated and non-heated plastics. These results show that though some chemicals are leached, they are only found in the headspace of the bottle rather than the water. Therefore, the water is safe for drinking in both high and low temperatures.

SYNTHESIS AND CATALYTIC BEHAVIOUR OF LAYERED DOUBLE HYDROXIDES
Alexander James White
The King's School Chester, Chester, Chester, UNITED KINGDOM

A novel tungstate intercalated layered double hydroxide, [LiAl2(OH)6]2(WO4).xH2O, has been synthesised and shown to be an effective catalyst for mild oxidative bromination of phenol red, 2,3-dimethoxytoluene and 5,5-dimethylcyclohexa-1,3-dione. These reactions utilise ammonium bromide and hydrogen peroxide as the reagents rather than elemental bromine and are therefore a safer, more environmentally friendly alternative to the conventional routes. 1H NMR, IR and UV spectroscopy were used to monitor the reactions and characterise the products.

A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE DEGRADATION OF DIFFERENT OILS AND FATS BY USING BIXA ORELLANA SEEDS
Eneisha Ivelisse Santiago
Elvira M. Colon Negron, Santa Isabel, PUERTO RICO

Bixa orellana seed is a common spice used for food coloring. In this research these seeds were used as a natural degrading agent of different kinds of saturated and unsaturated lipids. The hypothesis was that the seeds of Bixa orellana completely degrade different types of lipids. A method was designed to simulate the human stomach by using a 0.1N HCL solution placed in bath of Mary at 37°C. The unsaturated oils of canola, sunflower, vegetable, corn, olive, and saturated lipids such as animal fat, vegetable shortening and butter were used. Each one of these was individually added to the 0.1N HCL solution at 37 °C shaking the mixture until each of them dissolved. These are the control group. The time it took to degrade each lipid was measured. The same tests were performed, but adding three annatto seeds to the solution. These are the experimental group. The time to dissolve the lipids was again measured. The pH was measured in both, the control and the experimental groups. It was between 1 and 2. Different chromatography analyses were performed by using different solvents, such as acetone, ethanol, methanol, isopropanol and aqueous ammonia. The components found in the thin layer chromatography and in the paper chromatography were xanthophylls and carotenoids. The results obtained of the flavonoids and saponins tests were positive. All oils and fats degraded faster when adding the three seeds to the solution. The results evidenced that besides degrading the lipids; Bixa orellana seeds accelerate the degradation of them.

DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH-SENSITIVITY ABSORPTION PHOTOMETER: ADVANCES IN THE MEASUREMENT OF TRACE PHOSPHATE IN A LAKE
Minkei Machide
Kyoto Municipal Horikawa Senior High School, Kyoto, JAPAN

Phosphate is an essential nutrient for the growth and reproduction of living organisms, and one of the main controlling factors for the characteristics of aquatic environments. So, the determination of phosphate is important for understanding the process of natural purification. Presently, the molybdenum blue method is most widely used to determine phosphate. However, for measurement of low concentrations of phosphate, such as in the surface layer of a lake, ordinary spectrophotometric detection is not sensitive enough for its accurate determination.<br><br>In this study, the aim is to develop a high-sensitivity absorption photometer which utilizes the molybdenum blue method and to measure phosphate concentration in the surface layer of a lake. <br><br>This technique was based on the Lambert-Beer Law, which is the basic theory of absorption photometry. This law states that absorption is proportional to path length of the sample cell. So the optical path length of the sample cell was extended by tens of centimeters. To transmit light accurately through the sample cell, a laser was adopted as the light source. For optical detection, a photodiode of fast responsiveness was adopted. A prototype absorption photometer was created based on this basic design and its performance was evaluated. Consequently, this device was shown to enable the determination of phosphate with much higher sensitivity (detection limit=0.15µgP/L) and accuracy than a commercial spectrophotometer. <br><br>With this device, the vertical profile data of phosphate in the north basin of Lake Biwa could also be determined.

SYNTHESIS OF A LINKER MOLECULE FOR SELF-ASSEMBLED MONOLAYERS
Philipp Zagar
Hoehere Technische Lehranstald Wels, Wels, Upper Austria, AUSTRIA

In this work, new ways for synthesizing 16-mercapto-2,3-dihydroxypropylhexadecanamide and 12-mercapto-2,3-dihydroxypropyldodecanamide were investigated. On gold surfaces, these molecules spontaneously form a so-called self-assembled monolayer (SAM). If these self-assembled layers are treated with sodium periodate and consequently activated they can be functionalized to exhibit certain specificity. These surfaces are often utilized to analyze certain interactions between substrates but also to qualitatively determine various molecules.<br><br>In the frame of this thesis two significantly improved methods compared to the previous procedure were successfully developed. This was necessary due to sever flaws as side reactions in one step of the synthesis or a purification step that had a low throughput. <br><br>Within latest experiments the synthesized compound was used for a measurement of an avidin-biotin interaction with the BIAcore (BIA = Biological Interaction Analysis) that shows one of its possible applications.

DEVELOPMENT OF AN ASSAY FOR BIOTIN USING THE CPS DISC CENTRIFUGE
Joseph Anthony Napoli
South Fork High School, Stuart, FL

The vast importance of biotin to various biological processes suggests that accurate, efficient assays for detecting its content are of vital importance. The CPS Disc Centrifuge analyzes particle sizes as they sediment within an optically clear, rotating disc; its analysis speed and sensitivity suggest its potential value in developing assays. Thus the proposed research question: Can an assay to detect biotin content be developed using the CPS Disc Centrifuge? <br><br> The avidin-biotin complex was specifically used in this experiment. An investigation was conducted into the inhibition of bonding between avidin-coated latex and biotinylated bovine serum (BSA) by incubating the latex particles with varying concentrations of free-biotin prior to incubation with BSA protein. The optimum BSA concentration that effectively promoted agglomeration of avidin particles was determined to be 0.002 mg/mL. Ultimately, a trend was observed after graphing the negative logarithm of the free biotin concentrations 1.0 x 10^-2 mg/mL, 1.0 x 10^-3 mg/mL, and 1.0 x 10^-4 mg/mL against the percent agglomeration after incubation with a 0.5 mg/mL solution of avidin-coated latex followed by the optimum BSA concentration. <br><br> The data indicated that greater concentrations of free-biotin promoted cross-linking due to the saturation of the avidin-coated latex. The curve was not consistent, however, for the smallest free-biotin concentrations, most likely a result of overnight incubation. Results did suggest that an assay for biotin can be developed using the CPS centrifuge; however, further investigation must be conducted into smaller concentrations of free-biotin solution and the curve must also be tested to validate it.

IMPACT OF ORBITAL LOCALIZATION ON ONE-ELECTRON BASIS SET CONVERGENCE
Vinay Venkatesh Ramasesh
Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science, Denton, TX

Convergence to the complete one-electron basis set (CBS) limit of local second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory (LMP2) is studied. Knowledge of LMP2 convergence is important because most molecules of scientific interest are large and therefore must be studied with local methods. LMP2 and MP2 single-point energies are calculated for a set of 31 molecules with the cc-pVDZ, cc-pVTZ, and cc-pVQZ basis sets. Obtained values are then used to calculate CBS limit energies for each molecule with both LMP2 and MP2. Results reveal a systematic convergence of LMP2 energies to a limit. For most molecules, errors in the local approximation are reduced as basis set level increases. Additionally, local correlation errors at the CBS limit are lower than those with any individual basis set. An analysis of the simple exponential, mixed exponential/Gaussian, and Schwartz two-point extrapolation schemes shows that the mixed exponential/Gaussian scheme yields the most accurate and consistent results with LMP2. The percent of MP2 correlation energy recovered by LMP2 at the CBS limit is shown, for alkanes, to resemble a decreasing power function of the number of carbons the alkane contains. This work helps increase the applicability of LMP2 by clarifying its behavior at different basis set levels.

DESIGN AND SYNTHESIS OF PEPTIDOMIMETIC ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS
Lyndon Nuoxi Zhang
Mission San Jose High School, Fremont, CA

Antimicrobial peptides are a diverse group of short biopolymers found in a wide variety of hosts and capable of a broad spectrum of activity. These amphipathic compounds attack pathogenic agents through chemical interactions with microbial cell membranes. Due to the efficacy of these molecules, the pharmaceutical industry has shown significant interest in them. This study focuses on the design and synthesis of a peptidomimetic with properties similar to those of naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides. A beta-hairpin motif consisting of a beta-turn structure mimetic and an array of alternating hydrophobic and cationic residues is sought as the structural basis of this compound. Upon the successful synthesis and purification of the unnatural beta-turn residue, 3-amino-5-palmitamidobenzoic acid, the peptidomimetic is assembled using Fmoc solid phase peptide synthesis. The results lead to what could become a novel class of antimicrobial agents.

Lyceum Severo-Kavkazskogo GTU, Stavropol, Stavropol region, RUSSIA

This work is the result of experimentation оп precision thin ZnO film synthesis of required consistency, structure and thickness bу АLD method, made оn original vacuum apparatus, their analysis and ascertainment of optimal conditions for reagent precipitation. The АLD method is оnе of the modern technological techniques for obtaining extremely thin and even semiconductor оr dielectric films. In addition, thin ZnO films аre in great demand in modern micro- and optoelectronics, for example, in the production of luminescent and solar panels. А great number of experiments оn film deposition оn different substrate types and under different conditions were conducted. Quartz, silicon and white sapphire substrates were used. The synthesis was held under different temperatures and with UV-irradiation. The experimentation data was read in situ using а quartz thickness measuring resonator with operating frequencies from 2.6 to 10 MHz. The influence of construction variations оn the film parameters was noted. The influence of the synthesis temperature and UV-irradiation оn the characteristics of ZnO films was analyzed. While changing the parameters of synthesis, both amorphous and polycrystalline films were synthesized. The film optical properties were read in UV, visible and IR range. Direct energy gap was determined using absorption spectra. The film morphological parameters were valued using STM and AFM. The film thickness was determined with аn ellipsometer. Using the quartz resonator data, the suppositions оn film growth mechanisms were made. The viability of this method for thin ZnO film synthesis is shown.

PERIODICALLY PREDICTABLE?
Johlize Marie McNeil
Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School, Washington, DC

The first step in this experiment was determining which metals I could use to get results. To see the trends in the alkali and alkali earth metals, I used Sodium and Magnesium for across and Magnesium and Calcium to see the downward trend. For the transition metals, I used Iron, Nickel, Copper, and Zinc, and for the downward trend, I used Copper and Silver. The solutions I made for the reactions were NaNO3, Mg(NO3)2, Ca(NO3)3, Fe(NO3)3, Ni(NO3)2, Cu(NO3)2, AgNO3, and Zn(NO3)2. In order to make the reactions accurate, I created them each with a one molarity. By dissolving the nitrates in 200mL of distilled water, I had enough to add 10 mL to each test tube for the reactions. By reacting the nitrates with each of the metals, I was able to determine their reactivity and create an activity series. The activity series I derived from my data showed that Sodium was more reactive than calcium, and from there went in the order of zinc, magnesium, nickel, copper, silver, and then iron from most to least reactive. When I compared these results with the true activity series, I found that some of my elements were in the wrong order. Calcium was more reactive than sodium, and magnesium was below that, and then came zinc, iron, nickel, copper and silver. When I investigated why I got some of the metals in my series in incorrect places, I determined that for sodium and calcium, and magnesium and zinc, their proximity made it hard to determine which order they went in, and for iron, because it is a high charge metal, the iron nitrate turned acidic, so that it reacted with all the metals and caused my activity series to be off. My final results for this experiment were not affected by my sources of error, and explained the trends of the periodic table showing that in the alkali and alkali earth metals the trend between groups is a trend of decreasing reactivity from left to right, and between the families there is a trend of increase going down. Between the transition metals, my results showed no trends between the groups, but going down, I found a trend of a decrease in reactivity. If I were to redo this experiment, I would use the iron nitrate earlier and test its pH level to make sure it did not become acidic. I would also conduct a flame test to test for metals I was unsure of the orders for to see which ones reacted in a more severe way.

ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORS IN HERBS AS TREATMENTS FOR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
Asanka Thimothy Nanayakkara
Mississippi School for Mathematics and Science, Columbus, MS

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is caused when beta-amyloid plaque builds up on the brain causing impairment of memory. These patients also lack acetylcholine, the neurotransmitter in the brain that helps send messages from one nerve to another. Therefore, pharmaceuticals that remove beta-amyloid plaque or cause inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the enzyme that destroys acetylcholine, can help these patients. This research describes the discovery of novel compounds that are AChE inhibitors in commonly used spices. The purpose of this project is to isolate and identify the constituents in the herbs that have been identified to contain AChE inhibitors from the last year’s project. Curcuma longa (Turmeric) and Cuminum cyminum (cumin) were chosen for the study. Extracts of these plant materials were subjected to silica gel flash column chromatography using Biotage SP-1 system. TLC plate based AChE enzyme assay guided isolation was used to isolate the active constituents. Structures were determined by NMR and GC-MS methods. Galatamine was used as the positive control in TLC plate based assay. Compounds isolated include alpha-tumeron and beta-tumeron in turmeric, and crispanone in cumin seeds. My project has shown new activity for these compounds as they have been isolated before for different reasons. This could probably be a significant factor that there is low incidence of AD among the people who use these in their daily diet. Turmeric has been proven to have beta-amyloid plaque removal abilities and NIH is carrying out clinical studies but the activity of these compounds from these herbs is a new finding. This research shows presence of dual advantage in turmeric. This is also similar for Cumin seeds as crispanone has been proven beneficial for other reasons but no scientific literature on how crispanone is a AChE inhibitor exists.

FLUORESCENT WAXES: A NEW CLASS OF CHEMICALLY MODIFIED WAXES
Prem Poothatta Thottumkara
Macomb Senior High School, Macomb, IL

Carnauba wax, derived from the leaves of the carnauba palm trees native to Brazil has found a multitude of commercial applications due to the extraordinary gloss it provides to polished surfaces. One of the widespread uses of carnauba wax is in automobile polishes as a dilute solution in other waxes. The main objective of the current research is to enhance the glistening effect of carnauba wax when used as a polish by mixing it with synthetically modified waxes that carry fluorophores, a class of compounds that fluoresce. This project describes the synthesis of five new chemically modified waxes and wax analogs to be used as minimal additives in carnauba wax to enhance its glossy properties. The syntheses of these chemically modified waxes were carried out using well established synthetic protocols and the products were analyzed by IR and 1HNMR spectroscopic methods. Fluorescent properties of the new waxes and wax analogs were qualitatively as well as quantitatively measured. After complete characterization of the compounds, these synthetic additives were mixed with carnauba wax in minimal amounts to investigate the brightening effect of these additives on carnauba wax. Qualitative studies reveal that a diether wax analog was the most effective in inducing the brightening effect on carnauba wax.

SYNTHESIS OF POLYETHYLENE IN AEROGEL BY THE PHILLIPS CATALYST
Elliot Samuel Schwartz
JP Taravella High School, Coral Springs, FL

The Phillips catalyst is utilized as a cost effective approach to produce polyethylene, a common plastic found in consumer products. On the industrial level, chromium oxide is mixed with ethylene gas at temperatures that can reach 800 degrees Celsius. While this procedure is suitable for industry, it presents problems for researchers. Organic by-products make it impossible to differentiate between reactions at the chromium site and the side reactions, and industries manufacture polyethylene at high temperatures unsuitable for research purposes. Consequently, in spite of the Phillips catalyst industrial importance in the last fifty years, the formation of the active site and the mechanism for polymerization is not fully understood. Synthesizing polyethylene in chromium-doped aerogel is an effective approach to circumventing these obstacles. Aerogel is the least dense solid known to man yet it has an extremely low thermal conductivity (0.03 W m / m2 K) and a melting point of 1200 degrees Celsius. Its porous nature gives aerogel an incredible surface area and allowed for chains of polyethylene to form because of the large number of chromium sites that were exposed to ethylene. Aerogel is also suitable for research purposes because it is optically clear and can be analyzed by spectroscopy. Finally, the problem with by-products was avoided by reducing the oxidized precursors with CO, whose single by-product was not absorbed by the sample. Detailing the steps of synthesizing polyethylene in aerogel lays the foundation for enhancing our understanding of this process and for creating more economical and environmentally friendly plastic.

THE MPEMBA EFFECT: DOES HOT WATER REALLY FREEZE FASTER?
Timothy Ryan Pontzer
Calvary Christian School, Covington, KY

This project in its current form is the result of a collaborated effort of both thorough research and scientific experimentation. The project’s purpose was to show the Mpemba Effect and to explain and explore the complexities of how water freezes. After intensive research it was hypothesized that if warm water and cold water were both put into a freezer, then the temperature of the warmer water would decrease to zero degrees Celsius in less time than the cooler water.<br><br> Two one-hundred milliliter water bottles were taped to the bottom of a baking pan, one marked "A" and the other "B." A sensor connected to a digital thermometer was taped to the bottom of each bottle in the pan. Once both of the correct temperatures were reached, the pan was quickly placed in the freezer and digital readouts were placed outside on top of the freezer. A timer was set to go off at ten minute intervals, so that the temperatures of both cups could be recorded and photographed. This was continued until Cup A or B reached zero degrees Celsius. The time was noted and the number of minutes both cups had remained in the freezer was calculated. This experiment was repeated an additional four more times.<br><br> The data collected showed that warmer water does have a faster freezing rate. This knowledge could prove to be helpful in several areas, including the production of liquid food substances which are heated during their manufacturing process.

BIOMIMETIC NANO-OPTICS
Fedja Kadribasic

Nano-optics, the use of microstructures to refract or diffract light, has been employed by nature for millions of years. Mimicking these biological microstructures for applications in the modern world was the purpose of this research. It was achieved by coating glass slides with silica nanoparticles, covering them with a polymer mold, and then using them as templates for making anti-reflective polymers that resemble the surface of a moth’s eye. <br><br> According to the hypothesis, if one mimics arthropod anti-reflective microstructures using moldable anti-reflective polymers, then the resulting polymers will exhibit a higher degree of anti-reflectivity than “flat” polymers without the microstructures. <br><br> The antireflective polymers were covered with a material with a known reflectivity (ink, whose antireflectivity was augmented by the polymer). The polymers’ optical reflectivities (visible light range) were measured compared to the known reflectivity of ink and to a control without microstructures. To see what could be the culprit of the antireflectivity, hydrophobicity of the control and experimental polymers was measured using a goniometer and a computer program. <br><br> The resulting microstructures significantly decreased reflectivity since their reflectivities, in the visible light range, were almost six times lower at certain frequencies, and about two to three times lower in other ones than the control. Hydrophobicity measures demonstrated that a significant sum of air is trapped in the microstructures, which is quite possibly responsible for the decreased reflectivity, and could be used for further investigations.

Chemical Ecological Liceum, Dnipropetrovsk, UKRAINE

Alkaline accumulators play an important role in modern life as power sources for different devices, from photo and video equipment to vehicles with electric or hybrid engines. Their characteristics are determined considerably by nickel hydroxide properties. Our research is aimed at obtaining nickel hydroxide samples with excellent properties. We presupposed that layered double hydroxide (LDH) has the highest specific capacity. Research goals were:<br><br>1) obtaining nickel hydroxides (especially LDH) using different methods; 2) investigating structural and electrochemical characteristics of these samples; 3) identifying the most perspective samples. <br><br>Nickel hydroxide was obtained by the decomposition method, electrochemically in slit diaphragm electrolyzer under different current density, and chemically with aluminum and carbonate ions addition. Industrial hydroxide was used as a reference sample. Structural properties were investigated by XRD, thermogravimetric analysis, HRSEM, and chemical analysis; electrochemical properties – by voltammogram and galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling. <br><br>We demonstrated that the industrial sample is a crystal beta-form with specific capacity 188 mA*h/g. The sample obtained by “twist” method is a beta-form with highest crystallinity, but its specific capacity is only 130 mA*h/g. Samples electrochemically obtaining are LDH, which include only the beta-form, and alpha-form stabilized by sulfate ions. Specific capacity is 280 mA*h/g. Al-stabilized hydroxide is alpha-LDH. It specific capacity is 448 mA*h/g.<br><br>We can formulate important conclusions:<br><br>1) For the first time we obtained a previously unknown type of LDH.<br><br>2) Most perspective samples are LDH (Al-stabilized and electrochemically obtained), which have specific capacity 238% and 149% relative to industrial sample.

“The Chameleon Baby Bottle” investigation has the purpose to prevent accidents with hot liquids. This investigation relates the chameleon’s ability to change colors with temperature changes. It is intended to prove if thermo chromatic ink can be use as a reliable temperature indicator. The hypothesis states that if a thermo chromatic ink strip can be made, then temperature can be determine in liquids and accidents prevented. The investigation required that thermo chromatic inks of 66 F, 77 F and 86 F were purchased. A thermo chromatic strip of each temperature was placed in each of the four baby bottles and in the four foam cups. Strips used as indicators were prepared with different temperatures. Eight rectangular strips of 4 cm. long and 2 cm. wide were cut. Five drops of thermo chromatic ink were applied for the strips, and then a plastic cover was placed on each one. The baby bottle and foam cup labeled C were used as controls and 4 fl. oz. tap water added at room temperature (~56 F). Cow milk with temperature 68 F and coffee at 69 F were added to baby bottle and foam cup labeled #1, respectively. Baby bottle and foam cup #2 had cow milk at 79.5 F and coffee at 81 F respectively. Baby bottle and foam cup #3 were filled with cow milk at 89 F and coffee 86.5 F. The thermo chromatic ink strips changed colors when cow milk and coffee were added. The hypothesis was proved; the thermo chromatic ink strips are good temperature indicators for hot liquids.

SYNTHESIS, CHARACTERIZATION, AND APPLICATION OF [RE6(Μ3-SE)8(PET3)6-N(STPY)N]2+ RATIONAL DESIGN AND SYNTHESIS OF PRECURSORS TO CLUSTER ARRAYS BY PHOTODIMERIZATION
Mary Xue Wang, Eva Nichols, 
Catalina Foothills High School, Tucson, AZ

A hexanuclear cluster complex, formulated as [Re6(µ3-Se)8(PEt3)5(stpy)]2+ (stpy: trans-4-styrylpyridine), has been successfully prepared and structurally characterized. The unique molecular structure of the complex, in particular that of the conjugated ligand, suggests the possibility of organizing individual cluster units in the solid state for photodimerization. The resulting dicluster featuring two cluster units covalently linked together is expected to display interesting electronic communication as well as unique luminescence, making such cluster arrays useful for developing molecule-based microelectronics and optics.

FTSZ INHIBITORS AS NOVEL CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENTS FOR DRUG-RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS
Janelle Schlossberger, Amanda Marinoff, 
Plainview-Old Bethpage John F. Kennedy High School, Plainview, NY

The recent emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extreme drug-resistant (XDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has created a need for the development of antituberculosis agents with unique mechanisms of action. In this study, two benzimidazole-based compounds are synthesized to yield novel antituberculosis agents. Unlike conventional antituberculosis drugs, these agents selectively target FtsZ, an essential bacterial cell division protein that is the prokaryotic homologue of tubulin. Polymerization assays based on light scattering reveal that these compounds significantly inhibit the formation of FtsZ polymers. Determination of IC50 values confirms that these agents exhibit considerably more potent activity against FtsZ than previously studied benzimidazole compounds. These results suggest that the benzimidazole-based compounds synthesized have the potential to act as effective antituberculosis agents capable of overcoming both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains of Mtb. After evaluating the activity of both anti-tuberculosis agents, benzimidazole and taxane-based photoaffinity labels are synthesized. These compounds are presently undergoing biological testing using MALDI mass spectrometric techniques to determine the specific amino acid sites of drug attachment to the FtsZ protein as a means of further drug optimization.

STUDY ABOUT ARTIFICIAL FOOD GIVEN TO BEES
Jamile Brunie Biehl, Marcieli Partichelli, 
Escola Estadual Tecnica Sao Joao Batista, Montenegro, BRASIL

Rainy seasons, at the pre-bloom period, are greatly important to assure a good vegetative development that will give the plants necessary energy storage for an efficient bloom. However, when the topic is apiculture, rain and freezing winter are incredibly harmful not only to the nectar production but also to honey production, meaning that nectar and pollen are energy source for bees. In this not-harvestable period, the adopted solution is the usage of artificial food in order to provide the bees’ basic necessities, avoiding the hive weakness. Within the list of artificial bee food, there’s inverted-sugar syrup, which tends to be a problem because on the sucrose’s inverting process, 5 – hydroxymethyfurfural (aka 5-HMF) is produced as a consequence. 5-HMF is really toxic for bees and it affects the quality of honey by modifying its nutritional levels. The quantity of 5-HMF, plus other parameters, will be quantified in this treatise by physical and chemical analysis and they will also be compared to the stablished standarts from “Instrução Normativa n° 11 de 20 de Outubro de 2000 – Regulamento técnico de Identidade e Qualidade do Mel.” – a law that fiscalizes honey quality in Brazil.

SYLILATION OF ALPHA-BROMONITROCOMPOUNDS: A NEW APPROACH FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF ISOXAZOLINES
Andrey A. Mikhaylov, Artem A. Zemtsov, 
Moscow Chemical Lyceum #1303, Moscow, RUSSIA

α-Halogen nitrocompounds (HNC) are easily available but still poorly studied compounds. A strong electron-withdrawing effect of halogen and NO2-group leads to their significant deactivation making reactivity of HNC different both from nitroalkanes and alkylhalogenides. <br><br>The goal of this study was improvement of new synthetic application for HNC. The key step of the process is reduction of nitro group into nitrosoacetal group by oxidation of carbon chain promoted by available chlorotrimethylsilane or bromotrimethylsilane. Intermediately formed α-bromonitrsoacetals are quite reactive and easily undergo elimination and/or addition. As a result a new potential for activating different positions of carbon chain of initial nitroalkane is achieved.<br><br>In the course of the study mechanism of the process was thoroughly investigated. Based on the results obtained for the model 1-bromonitroethane formation of 1-N,N-bis (trialkylsiloxy)amino-1-bromethylene and 3-alkyliden-2-trialkylsiloxyisoxazolidine as key intermediates of the reaction was proposed. <br><br>To prove the potency of the method 1- and 2-step syntheses of 3-bromomethylisoxazolines, isoxazoles and amides of aminohydroxame acids starting from available bromonitrocompounds were carried out. The effectiveness of the process was clearly demonstrated by synthesis of substituted derivatives of pyrrolidines, prolinoles and unnatural γ-amino acids.<br><br>As the result of the study a new application of available α-halogen nitrocompounds in the synthesis of isoxazoles and their derivatives was found.

THE EFFECT OF MICROWAVE AND ULTRA-VIOLET RADIATION ON THE CHELATING/ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTY OF POMEGRANATE JUICE
Neelam Kaur Grewal, Amanjeet Kaur, 
Silver Creek High School, San Jose, CA

Since polyphenols protect fruits from potentially harmful elements in our environment, it is hypothesized in this study that pomegranate juice polyphenols will not be affected by radiation. To test if the antioxidant or chelating properties of pomegranate juice are affected by ultra-violet or microwave radiation, radiated juice samples were analyzed using the EDTA reagent reaction, which takes advantage of pomegranate juice’s natural zinc chelating properties. In addition, the indicator properties of radiated pomegranate juice were also tested, using Spectronic-20 D+ absorbency tests and colorimetric analysis. Based on the spectrophotometric absorbency readings, both forms of radiation affected the water-based pomegranate juice extracts in the pH range 8 to 11 more than the 1 through 7 pH range. In terms of chelating properties, the data suggests both water-based and alcohol-based pomegranate juice extracts were affected more when exposed to microwaves than when exposed to ultra-violet light. Based on the data, the chelation of zinc is affected more through microwave as compared to the control. Although beyond the scope of this study, it is hypothesized that microwave radiation may have more effect on the polyphenol’s molecular configuration which in turn affected its ability to bind with zinc. Based on the study, the results suggest the initial hypothesis of polyphenol resistance to radiation was incorrect, since both forms of radiation did affect the indicator and chelating properties of the juice. Therefore, a practical application of this study indicates that if pomegranate juice is not stored properly, exposure to radiation may affect the antioxidant properties.

TESTING CONCENTRATIONS OF LACTIC ACID IN NAOH SOLUTION
Anna Lee Johnson, Kaushal Vadhar, 
Southside High School, Greenville, SC

Amino acids are known to be chiral, meaning that they show handedness. Humans only use one form of the amino acid and the sugars found on Earth use the other. When the body is presented with the alternative form, one of three things will happen: filtration, using only the correct form; absorbing both, and only using the correct form; or the body will absorb the incorrect form and be seriously endangered. An example of this is from thalidomide. This is a medication used in the 1980’s, prescribed as a pill to quell morning sickness, however the medication contained the incorrect form of the amino acid. The results were devastating; thousands of fetuses were misshapen and/ or had still births.<br><br> This experiment is to investigate the possibility of differentiating between left and right handed amino acids. The amino acid used was lactic acid (D, L, and DL forms). In order to conduct the experiment an apparatus is needed to measure the bending of the light (a known effect of chirality); thus the polarimeter. The results actually support the hypothesis because the results show that lactic acid did bend the light when in dexrotary and levorotatory forms, where as in DL form, the solutions did not bend the light. Thus, the hypothesis is supported, and can be applied further research in medicine to prevent more genetic mutations in children as well as in adults.

Looking clean, nice, and prepared is an important part of most people’s lives. To achieve such a status, it is necessary to use effective detergent while you wash your clothes. However, many people don’t know that such a detergent can be made in the comfort of your own home.<br><br> In this experiment, we compared the effects of store bought detergent against homemade detergent. The hypothesis was that we could do a similar, if not equal job to commercial brand detergent.<br><br> To make a homemade detergent, first we had to make a hard soap. This includes mixing sodium hydroxide, water, and fat. To turn this into a detergent, it was necessary to cut the hard soap into small pieces and mix it with borax, baking powder, and glycerin. Then hot water was added to further liquidate it. This was added into a laundry machine just as regular detergent would be. We stained identical fabrics with common staining substances. Then we washed the fabrics and compared side by side the effects of store bought detergent to homemade soap.<br><br> Ultimately, the store bought detergent could do a slightly better job of removing stains but failed in removing as much of the thick mustard stains that the homemade soap wash out. All in all, it was fairly equivalent. This contributes to the area of clean soap in that it tested whether the effects of store bought soap could be imitated by homemade.

GOT MERCURY? A TWO YEAR SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF FISH TISSUE UTILIZING DIPHENYLCARBAZONE
Kristin Lynea Fields, Ashley Carole Fields, 
Ballard High School, Louisville, KY

Last year’s project examined the levels of Hg in tuna. This year, fresh samples were examined for levels of Hg. The hypothesis were<br><br> A. If the fresh fish was from the Ohio River then it would have measurable amounts of Hg because of the recent warning issued about the Ohio River.<br><br> B. The liver of the fish would show higher levels of Hg than the filets because the liver is the filtering organ of the body<br><br> C. The Ahi would have the highest level of Hg of the samples tested because they are the largest and lowest swimming tuna.<br><br> D. If the sample is stirred for the entire digestion then the level of mercury will be higher than the sample not stirred the entire 5 days. <br><br> The control was a standard solution of 1 x 10-3 M Hg(NO3)2. The solution was diluted through a serial dilution down to 10-7 M and a plot was made of the resulting data. 18 samples of fish were digested in a Nitric/Sulfuric (70/30) solution. After the digestion process the solution was tested utilizing a Perkin Elmer UV-Vis Spectrophotometer and a diphenylcarbazone indicator. The results were compared to a standard curve of Hg(NO3)2 with DPC at 615 nm to detect the amount of mercury present. From this, it was shown that all samples had an indication of Hg. A person still needs to get fish in their diet, but the selection should be of fish that has not been caught in Hg invested waters.

THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES IN DIFFERENT CARBONATED SOFT DRINKS
Angel Zabdiel Negron, Damian Berrios Rodriguez, Eric Morales Santiago
Francisco Morales High School, Naranjito, PUERTO RICO

The problem for this investigation was: are there substances other than mint caramel that produce gas when these react with carbonated soft drinks? The hypothesis was that there are substances other than mint caramel that produce significant amounts of gas when these react with different carbonated soft drinks; and that the reaction with the diet soft drinks will produce more gas than the other carbonated soft drinks. Six different products were combined with each of three different soft drinks used to compare their reaction. All the sixty-four ounces soft drink bottles were placed against a scaled seven feet wood panel. This allowed the measurement of the height of the soft drink when it was expelled out as a result of the reaction when three grams of each of the different products were combined with the different carbonated soft drinks. This measurement was used as an indicator of the amount of gas produced in each reaction. The obtained data indicated that the highest heights for the expelled soft drinks were recorded when each of the six different products were combined with the diet soft drink. The highest height obtained was for the combination of the diet soft drink and the mint caramel, followed by the combination of it with sodium chloride and with sucrose. It can be concluded that there are substances other than mint caramel that produce gas when combined with soft drinks but, the amounts of gas produced are not as high as with the mint caramel.

Previous studies have indicated that formaldehyde is one of the components of metabolized aspartame. The goal of this experiment is to not only to certify these studies, but also to develop a procedure that can do so easily and inexpensively. Instead of using the traditional chromotropic acid method, sulfuric acid and the metabolized aspartame (broken down using yeast as a catalyst) were mixed and then added to an opiate, in this case, ground poppy seeds. Should metabolized aspartame really contain formaldehyde, the result of this mixture should be purple, a color that is traditionally obtained when sulfuric acid and formaldehyde are added to opiates. <br><br> The control groups showed that while formaldehyde alone had no impact on the opiate, sulfuric acid repeatedly independently reacted with the poppy seeds to form a brown tint. Thus, because sulfuric acid and poppy seeds create a brown mixture, it can be assumed that a purple tint can only be achieved with the presence of formaldehyde. The results of the experimental variable detected specks of purple within the brown color; thus, we can assume that this test achieved its goal of detecting formaldehyde. However, a color scale produced using varying amounts of formaldehyde showed that this test is only valid within the range of 0.01 mL to 0.10 mL.

PRODUCTION OF HIGHLY RESISTANT AND HEAT INSULATED BRICK BY USING WASTE BORON AND CALCULATING THE PROVIDED ENERGY SAVING
Oguz Koca, Utku Durmaz, 
Maltepe Military High School, Izmir, TURKEY

The increasing amount of waste boron is kept in dams near the settlements, which causes pollution.<br><br> This study was conducted to produce highly resistant and heat insulated bricks by incorporating waste boron and expanded perlite into brick clay, and to calculate the annual energy saving, assuming these bricks applied to a 4-storied building. <br><br> Initially, two groups of variables are determined and the additives are mixed homogeneously with required percentages. After samples are moistened and pressed, heat treatment is made. The coefficients of heat conductivity, strength and water absorption values of newly produced bricks are measured. Lastly, assuming these bricks applied to a 4-storied building, the annual energy saving is calculated.<br><br> It was observed that boric acid is the most effective boron type (with its heat conductivity decreases 36%, strength increases 97%) while the most appropriate one is the disposal calcined product (with its heat conductivity coefficient decreases 33%, strength increases 89%) due to recycling. <br><br> The results show that 5,38% of the total heating energy consumed in residences can be saved with a decrease in heat conductivity of bricks. Also both environmentally harmful boron disposals and fuel used in buildings for heating can be saved. The apartments built with these bricks will be more durable due to both the increment of strength of the building and prevention of corrosion in construction elements.

Our project explores an alternative for heating homes in Arctic Alaska. The goal was to convert used vegetable oil into biodiesel and test its viability in a home heating system. We hypothesized that biodiesel is a viable alternative to diesel fuel. <br><br> We collected discarded cooking oil from local restaurants, then titrated each batch to assess quality and determine amount of lye catalyst needed for transesterification. Calculated quantities of methanol and potassium hydroxide were added to the waste oil and homogenized inside a homemade 20-gallon processor. After settling, the oil was purified through stir washing. We used a torpedo space heater in an insulated shop and an uninsulated Connex van, measured temperature fluctuations for thirty minutes in 5-minute intervals. The oil was also tested in a kerosene wick heater; temperature fluctuations were measured for twelve hours in 3-hour intervals. <br><br> Success was limited. Cold temperatures thickened viscosity and increased flashpoint, causing gelling in the fuel tanks. Inside the space heater, the nozzle could not spray the B100 (pure biodiesel) into the burn chamber as a mist, so limited combustion took place. Inside the kerosene heater, B100 clogged the wick. Between both tests, average temperature rise equaled 3.05 degrees Celsius with blended fuel. <br><br> Varying factors affect practicality of biodiesel in remote arctic villages: low ambient temperatures, high viscosity and flashpoint, and expensive transportation costs of chemicals. <br><br> Biodiesel is a practical alternative in temperate climates. Here, it has potential during summertime as a blend inside diesel engines/oil fired appliances requiring little modification.

COMPLEXING TRANSITION METAL IONS WITH CURCUMIN
Chelsea Lynn Massaro
Mount Dora Christian Home & Bible School, Mount Dora, FL

The purpose for this experiment was to determine if certain transition metal ions will bind with curcumin in an aqueous solution and, if so, which transition metal will possess the largest binding affinity in respect to curcumin. The hypothesis was that if certain transition metal ions are tested for their ability to bind with curcumin in an aqueous solution, then all the transition metal ions with effectively bind. Of the transition metal ions being tested, copper (II) will possess the largest binding affinity in respect to curcumin. The transition metal ions tested were copper (II), nickel (II), and iron (II).<br><br> The experimental procedure is: first, mix stock solutions. Secondly, run baseline in the Shimadzu UV-2401PC UV-VIS Recording Spectrophotometer. Next mix transition metal ion into curcumin stock solution. Run solution using Shimadzu UV-2401PC UV-VIS Recording Spectrophotometer for each concentration. Record data. Lastly, properly dispose of all materials. Repeat steps for each trial.<br><br> The average binding affinity for all trails were: iron (II): 0.34%, copper (II): 0.19%, and nickel (II) was undeterminable due to the fact that low concentrations of the metal did not cause the solution to reach the saturation point.<br><br> The results both supported and did not support the hypothesis by showing that not all of the transition metal ions tested bonded effectively and that copper (II) did possess the largest binding affinity in respect to curcumin. <br><br> This experiment demonstrated that curcumin does bind with certain transition metal ions that are harmful in large amounts in the human body.

POSTMORTEM BODY TISSUE AND FLUID DISTRIBUTION OF 1,1-DIFLUOROETHANE
James S. Peng
American Heritage School, Plantation, FL

The purpose of this study is to determine the distribution of 1,1 difluoroethane (DFE) in the human tissues and fluids in six real cases by using the headspace gas chromatographic method with verification gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Determination of the levels of 1,1 difluoroethane may provide insight to the characteristic behaviors of 1,1 difluoroethane and the postmortem distribution patterns of DFE in relation to normal physiologic blood flow. By using a newly developed method, a series of known concentration standards of 1,1 difluoroethane were analyzed using methanol as an internal standard (IS) and a flame ionization detector (FID). A calibration curve was then established by creating ratios of the responses from each known standard to that of methanol (IS). After the calibration, the concentration of 1,1 difluoroethane in each of the tissues and fluids in all six cases was determined by comparing the responses of each of the samples in a gas chromatograph to the standard calibration curve. The presence of DFE was confirmed in the decedent's blood by injection into a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in full scan mode. The results were consistent to the times, causes, and events surrounding the decedent’s death and characterized the behavior of 1,1 difluoroethane in the human body’s tissues and fluids. The study took into account several variables that may have caused discrepancies to the 1,1 difluoroethane distribution, and it was concluded that the distribution of difluoroethane in the body’s tissues and fluids is highly dependent on several factors, such as time of intake, decomposition, and the accumulation of 1,1 difluoroethane in the tissues due to continual use. With further investigations, detailed analyses of these factors and variables surrounding a decedent’s death may be deciphered from such patterns of distribution.

SYNTHESIS AND SURFACE CHARACTERIZATION OF ALUMINATE AND FERRITE SPINEL NANOPARTICLES
Mohamed Alhadi Hamouda
Everglades High School, Miramar, FL

Nanoparticles of mixed oxides that are thermally and chemically stable have drawn considerable attention lately. One such complex are spinels. Spinel nanoparticles cover a wide range of transition metals with the same basic formula of AB2O4. In this research several surface analysis have been completed in order to prove that aluminate and ferrite spinels have great potential as catalysts. Based upon the XRD Data and TEM images, diffraction patterns confirm nanoparticles sizes with aluminates having an average particle size of 6-10 nm, and ferrites having an average particle size of 8-16 nm. Furthermore, the Diffused Reflectance Infrared Spectroscopy and Point of Zero Charge estimations show the presence of acidic surface areas and the existence of bronsted acid/base sites which proves the spinels potential use as catalysts. Also, according to BET measurements the spinels have surface areas as large as 300 m^2/g. According to FT-IR analysis, it is evident that when the samples were heated the weight loss was due to the loss of water, and the hydroxyl groups attached to the surface of the spinel complexes. Due to the loss of hydroxyl groups, it provides evidence that the spinels are acting as a bronsted base. In all, due to the large surface areas of the spinels and the presence of bronsted acid/base sites, spinels show great potential as catalysts.

MODELING THE VARIATION IN SPECIFIC HEAT OF A 4’-OCTYL-4-BIPHENYL-CARBONITRILE LIQUID CRYSTAL DUE TO PHASE TRANSITION
Andrew Steven Voyles
Pensacola High School, Pensacola, FL

The purpose of this project was to investigate how the specific heat of a 4’-Octyl-4-Biphenyl-Carbonitrile (8CB) liquid crystal changes due to phase transitions as it was heated, and to subsequently model the specific heat in the various liquid crystal mesophases. The compound selected for testing was 4’-Octyl-4-Biphenyl-Carbonitrile, a common liquid crystal used in research in this field.<br><br>I first calibrated the DSC using an iridium calibration sample and measured out the masses of the 8CB samples, using an analytic balance. I sealed the crucibles shut inside the DSC, and heated the samples from 0.0 to 60.0 ± .1 º C. I measured the average phase transition temperatures, tc, and the DSC calculated the molar specific heat data (so the mass of the sample had no effect). By plotting the data on a logarithmic scale, it was possible to determine the constants, and therefore construct a rational best-fit function for each mesophase.<br><br>The best-fit function was Cp(t)=e^6.241 * (|t-33.2|/33.2)^-.0482 for the Smectic A phase (R^2=.3325), Cp(t)=e^6.0975 * (|t-40.58|/40.58)^-.169 for the Nematic phase (R^2=.673), and Cp(t)=e^6.188 * (|t-40.58|/40.58)^-.1049 for the Isotropic Liquid phase (R^2=.4642). The Solid-Smectic A transition temperature was 22.2 ºC, 33.20 ºC for Smectic A-Nematic, and 40.58 ºC for Nematic-Isotropic Liquid. <br><br>These models were average fits for the data, based on the R2 coefficient of determination values. This was due to the relatively little data, although the best fit functions matched the data’s shape nearly perfectly. The change in specific heat explored in this project has great potential for the chemical, industrial, and consumer electronics worlds.

KINETICS STUDY OF THE DECOMPOSITION OF HYDROGEN PEROXIDE BY METALS, METAL CATIONS, TEMPERATURE, AND PH: YEAR FIVE OF AN ONGOING STUDY
Aubrey Ward Craig II
Northwest Florida State College Collegiate High School, Niceville, FL

Will temperature, pH, metals, and cations be effective in controlling the decomposition of Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) into Oxygen (O2) and Water (H2O)? Will each change made to the reaction increase, decrease, or not affect the rate at which Oxygen (O2) and Water (H2O) are produced form Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2)? The purpose of my project is to study the effects of temperature, pH, metals, and cations on Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) in order to find the most effective catalyst. It was hypothesized that pH, temperature, metals and cations increase the rate of decomposition.<br><br><br> A brief procedure is as follows. Using 50ml of a specific concentration of Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2), and a specific amount and concentration of a catalyst, the volume is measured over a reasonable amount of time to find the rate of decomposition.<br><br><br> The results showed that two of the hypotheses were accepted, and one null hypothesis was accepted. The variables of temperature, and metal cations were affective in increasing the rate. From the experiments ran, pH was not affective in increasing the rate of decomposition, it was the catalyst themselves that were affecting the reaction. Iron three Nitrate Nonahydrate (Fe(No3)3•9H2O) was the most affective catalyst of the sample group tested. With a 1M concentration of the cation, and a 27% concentration of the Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2), 25ml of Oxygen (O2) was produced in .045 seconds. The results could be used for producing oxygen for medical purposes, along with creating a new way to make oxygen in the laboratory environment.

DISTILLATION: A VOLATILE TALE
Emily Elizabeth Irvin
Union Scioto High School, Chillicothe, OH

The purpose of this project was to determine how a rectification column affects distillation efficiency by comparing a simple batch distillation and a column batch distillation on the same initial mixture of benzene and toluene prepared by weight using reagents from freshly opened bottles. The composition of the distillates collected in both temperature of the pot and the column head were recorded. <br><br> In the simple batch distillation, distillate was collected at different temperatures and weighed and the composition analyzed. In the column batch distillation, the same pot and condenser were used, except a packed column was added for the reflux distillation. The droplet rate and mass of condensate were recorded and the composition analyzed.<br><br> The composition of distillate shows that the column batch distillation produces a purer benzene distillate than the simple batch distillation. The temperature data and the comparison of experiment liquid/vapor equilibrium data with values calculated by Raoult's Law indicated that there amy be moisture in the distillation apparatus from one or more sources such as the initial liquids, the atmosphere in the distillation system, or condensate form the condenser, which was cooled to a lower temperature than necessary. Since water forms azeotropes with benzene and toluene with a lower boiling point than that the respective pure benzene and toluene, in studying distillation of substances that form azeotropes with water, water must be excluded from the distillation system.

THE DETERGENT DILEMMA
Zachary Nathaniel Wilhoit
Perrin High School, Perrin, TX

The purpose of my experiment was to isolate the best combination of laundry detergents and boosters considering the three important factors of cleaning effectiveness, environmental impact, and total cost. The detergents evaluated were Tide, Tide Bleach Alternative, Purex, Purex Bleach Alternative, Gain, and Sun; the boosters evaluated were OxiClean, Borax and no booster at all.<br><br> To analyze the cleaning effectiveness of the detergent combinations, cloth samples were stained with mustard, ketchup, grape juice, eyeliner, and ink. They were washed and then visually evaluated them at various distances to determine the minimum distance at which the stain was visible.<br><br> To analyze the environmental impact of the detergent combinations, the weight and type of waste a combination produced in a year’s worth of loads was measured, the pH level of the wastewater they produced was recorded, and the phosphate content and biodegradability of the detergent combinations was determined.<br><br> To analyze the total cost of each combination, the cost of a year’s worth of loads of the detergent and booster in each combination was calculated.<br><br> The best cleaning combination was Purex Bleach Alternate with OxiClean, the most environmentally friendly combinations were Tide with no booster and Purex with no booster, and the cheapest combination was Purex with no booster. However, weighing all three factors equally, Gain with no booster performed the best overall. Based on the results of this study, using Gain detergent on a regular basis with an occasional scoop of OxiClean for exceptionally stained loads is highly recommended.

SYNTHETIC APPROACHES TO ORGANOMETALLIC COMPLEXES FOR ELECTRONICS APPLICATIONS
Ilya Vladimirovich Vinogradov
Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Lexington, KY

Studies on organic semiconductors are extensive with applications in, but not limited to, solar cells, transistors, diodes, plastic screens, and chemical sensors. Conventional organic materials pose problems because they lack air-stability and solubility, rendering the materials difficult to work with. One method to fix such problems is through coordination with transition metals (organometallic complexes) increasing the material’s handle and potentially conductivity. Two methods were pursued to create metallocene acenes: creating a metal anhydride and adding aromatic rings through double Friedel-Crafts reactions or creating acenes salts and adding metals through a transmetallation reaction.<br><br>All chemical materials were created with standard Schlenk techniques under nitrogen with distilled solvents. The synthesis of acylferrocenes for later synthesis of ferrocene dicarboxylic acids proved fruitless; the ferrocene compounds proved too labile to handle. The preparation of a sodium acene salt, to be added to metal complexes through ligand substitution, failed. Chemistry with thalliated 1,2-bis(2-chlorobenzoyl) fulvene failed when forming anhydrides for RuCp* and Mn(CO)3. The preparation of [1,2-C5H3(CO)2C6H4] (sodium acene salt), to be added to metal complexes, also failed. A multi-step reaction using phenyl esters worked and successfully produced a ruthenium anhydride complex ([Ru{h5-1,2-C5H3(CO)2O}{h5-1,2-C5(CH3)5}], 47% yield). Further attempts at double Friedel-Crafts reactions failed because the anhydride decomposed in AlCl3 (catalyst), but many other methods to build the acenes exist. The creation of the ruthenium anhydride complex was a success to the project and could potentially lead to semi-conductive ruthenocene acenes, which have potentials in many of today’s electronic technologies because of their economic and practical viability.

BIODIESEL FUEL PRODUCTION FROM ALGAE AS RENEWABLE ENERGY
Ryan Gage Dunham
South Pemiscot High School, Steele, MO

Abstract<br><br><br>Biodiesel is biodegradable, less CO2 and NOx emissions. Continuous use of petroleum sourced fuels is now widely recognized as unsustainable because of depleting supplies and accumulation of carbon dioxide in the environment. Renewable, carbon neutral, transport fuels are necessary for environmental and economic sustainability. Algae have emerged as one of the most promising sources for biodiesel production. It can be inferred that algae grown in CO2 enriched air can be converted to oily substances. Such an approach can contribute and solve major problems in air pollution resulting from CO2 evolution and future crisis due to a shortage of energy sources. This study was undertaken to know the proper transesterfication, amount of biodiesel production and physical properties of biodiesel. In this study we used biodiesel obtained from the algae species Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and compared its energy efficiency to that of more commonly used biodiesel produced from soybeans. The results indicated that biodiesel can be produced from both algae and soybeans.

MOLECULAR IMPRINTING IN THE CREATION OF POTENTIOMETER SENSORS
Julia Yun-ling Shi
Tullahoma High School, Tullahoma, TN

The purposes of these experiments were to determine the utility of an ion imprinted elecro-active polymer coated electrode as a sensor for dicyanoargentate ion. This determination employed three types of electrodes. The first, the ion imprinted electrode, was coated with N-methylpyrrole formed using potassium dicyanoargentate as the supporting electrolyte in an electro-polymerization. A second electrode was formed by electro-polymerization with N-methylpyrrole using a potassium chloride supporting electrolyte. The third, control electrode, was a bare gold metal disc electrode. Each electrode was submerged in dicyanoargentate solutions of decreasing concentration and the potential (in millivolts) recorded. It was found that as the concentration of the solutions decreased by 0.1, the recorded millivolts of the dicyanoargentate-imprinted electrode increased in a near-Nernstian manner. The potential of the chloride-imprinted electrode increased in a more irregular manner while the uncoated electrode behaved the most unpredictably, with irregular jumps between concentrations. Interpreting this data, the conclusion is that an electrode molecularly–imprinted with dicyanoargentate is most effective at determining the concentration of dicyanoargentate ions in a solution; this is due to the near-Nernstian behavior that the electrode shows. Further experiments were performed with a constant concentration of potassium chloride to test for the interference of common ions. However, it is likely that additional work will be required to better discriminate against interferences.

IMPROVING THE FLAME RESISTANCE OF FABRIC
Kevin Robert Winklepleck
Lighthouse Christian Academy, Bloomington, IN

My project for this year was to improve the safety of the public by developing a clothing detergent that would, during the process of washing one’s clothes, increase the flame resistance of the fabric. For this experiment, I took seven of the most commonly used fabrics in clothing today (denim, wool, fleece, satin, rayon, nylon, and cotton) and tested each independently without treating them with my detergent. After this, I tested the same type of materials in a similar fashion, only prior to the testing I washed each fabric using my detergent solution. I did this with two different detergent mixtures, the first having twice as much detergent in relation to the fire-proofing solution, and the second having an equal amount of both detergent and fire-proofing solution. After testing the fabrics, I recorded and sorted the information, and compared the data gathered from the treated fabrics to those of the untreated fabrics. After doing this, I found that the treated fabrics had an increase in flame resistance by about fifty percent. This testing proved that a detergent which can improve the flame resistance of clothes can be manufactured and, with enough testing, be perfected to the point of reaching the market.

FACILE ACCESS TO BICYCLIC SULTAMS HAVING SULFUR AT THE APEX POSITION
Daria S. Grosheva
Academical Gymnasium of Saint-Petersburg State University, Saint-Petersburg, RUSSIA

The stability of planar amide bonds has been classically explained by resonance delocalization of the nitrogen lone pair into the carbonyl group. But this type of stabilization is impossible in non planer amide, such as lactams which contain the nitrogen atom in bridgehead position due to extreme lability of their amide bond. It is well known that the lone electron pair on nitrogen in sulfonamide is most often oriented to the bisector of the O-S-O internuclear angle and thus there is no delocalization in sulfonamide group. Consequently the difference in stability of the bicycles and ordinary sultams are less then the same value in the case of lactams. At present, a few sultams of this general class have been described. To our knowledge, only one bridged sultam featuring the sulfur atom at the apex position has been reported. The method of preparation of this sultam includes two key steps: the RCM reaction and intramolecular cycloalkilation. The main deficiency of this method is impossibility of small ring systems the synthesis.<br><br>In our laboratory a facile method of preparation of bicyclic sultams has been developed. The key step includes consecutive formation of two bonds as one pot process by cyclodialkylation methyl 1,2-thiazolidine-5-carboxylate-1,1-dioxide with different dihalogenides; such resort 1,2-dibromeethan as alkylation agents allowed to obtained methyl 7-thia-1-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-4-carboxylate-7,7-dioxide with a good yield. This method has a great potential, thus simple variation of alkylation agents and starting materials allowes to prepare different bicyclic system including small rings which are inaccessible by another strategy.

SYNTHESIS OF OLIGOSACCHARIDE PRECURSORS OF MYCOBACTERIAL ARABINOFURANOSIDES
Ksenia G. Fedina
Moscow Chemical Lyceum # 1303, Moscow, RUSSIA

Tuberculosis remains rampant and is a growing threat worldwide. The development of a new vaccine requires the synthesis of arabinofuranose oligosaccharides. They represent fragments of cell wall polysaccharides of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which play the key role in survival and pathogenicity of bacteria. <br><br>The goal of this work is the synthesis of 2-chloroethyl glycoside of a trisaccharide, viz., 3,5-di-O-(alpha-D-arabinofuranosyl)-alpha-D-arabinofuranose, which is present on the cell wall of M. tuberculosis. The synthesis of arabinofuranosides necessitates the development of new reagents for stereoselective glycosylation, and we obtained three new glycosyl donors for building alpha-linkages: phenyl 2-O-acetyl-3,5-di-O-benzoyl-1-thio-alpha-D-arabinofuranoside 1, phenyl 3,5-di-O-benzoyl-2-O-chloroacetyl-1-thio-alpha-D-arabinofuranoside 2, and benzoxazol-2-yl 2-O-acetyl-3,5-di-O-benzoyl-1-thio-alpha-D-arabinofuranoside 3. We also synthesized three new glycosyl acceptors: phenyl 3,5-di-O-benzoyl-1-thio-alpha-D-arabinofuranoside 4 (2-linkage), 2-chloroethyl 2-O-benzoyl-3-O-chloroacetyl-alpha-D-arabinofuranoside 5 (5-linkage), and 2-chloroethyl 2-O-benzoyl-alpha-D-arabinofuranoside 6 (3,5-linkages).<br><br>A common precursor for donors 1-3 and acceptor 4, viz., hitherto unknown 3,5-di-O-benzoyl-1,2-O-benzylidene-beta-D-arabinofuranose, was prepared from the corresponding glycosyl bromide. Coupling of glycosyl donor 3 with acceptor 4 gave unexpectedly a linear 1,2-linked trisaccharide. A common precursor for acceptors 5 and 6 was 1,2,5-O-orthobenzoyl-beta-D-arabinofuranose. Glycosylation of acceptor 6 with donor 2 afforded a “trisaccharide” diorthoester. This was rearranged by trimethylsilyl trifluorometanesulfonate-catalyzed isomerization to the target glycoside of the branched trisaccharide, which represents a fragment of the M. tuberculosis cell wall arabinofuranan.

WITHOUT A TRACE

The purpose of this project is to determine if there is a cleaning solution that can extract iron from blood making it undetectable to luminol. By adding a high level of phosphate, in the form of a cleaning solution, it is hypothesized that iron in the blood will become undetectable to luminol. <br><br> <br><br>Ten tiles were each divided into twelve blocks, for a total of 120 samples. Two tests were performed each using 60 samples each. In the first test 1 mL of blood was dropped in each square of the first five test tiles and allowed to dry for twenty minutes. Each tile was cleaned using one of four solutions; cola, dishwashing-liquid, bleach, and a self made cleaner of chicken litter and distilled water. One test tile was untreated but wiped clean. The second test was conducted using the same methods except the blood was wiped off immediately. A colorimeter test was run from the blood samples by rinsing the test section with distilled water, and testing for iron residue in ppm. A luminol test was also run on the samples. The homemade cleaner which had the highest phosphate level, was the only solution to leave the samples without a trace. <br><br> <br><br>After analyzing the data the self-made cleaner of chicken litter and water showed to be the most effective at removing iron from blood, leaving it undetectable to luminol.

UNUSUAL BEHAVIOR OF GAS MOLECULES PENETRATION THROUGH MEMBRANE
Yu-Hui Lin
Taiwan Provincial Chia-Yi Girls' Sr High School, Chiayi City, Taiwan(R.O.C.), CHINESE TAIPEI

We were motivated by observing that bubbles on the surface of an opened soda shrank quickly. Similar behavior was found in the soap bubbles filled with carbon dioxide. By injecting different kinds of gases into soap water, we found that bubbles with gas of higher solubility in water shrank more quickly, such as carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Controlling the partial pressure of the gas outside the bubbles would effectively change the shrinkage rate. We found that the shrinkage rate, in the case of carbon dioxide, decreased to 50% while its partial pressure was tuned from 1 to 0.5. Our observation generally agreed well with the "solution-diffusion mechanism". We then expanded our study in a wider scope by making different gas bubbles in various kinds of liquids, such as helium, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, acetylene, and nitrous oxide in soap water, ethanol, isopropanol, acetone, cyclohexane, and n-hexane. The carbon dioxide, acetylene, and nitrous oxide bubbles showed clear size reduction in all the liquids we studied. The sulfur dioxide bubbles appeared to be too unstable to be observed due to its much higher solubility in all the liquid systems. The implication of the results said that molecules of carbon dioxide, acetylene, nitrous oxide and sulfur dioxide own much higher solubilities than other two gases in all the liquid systems we studied. It may shed some light on the future application of a simple liquid system in the gas separation or relative environmental issue.

COMBATING CANCER: DESIGN AND SYNTHESIS OF DUAL-WARHEAD TUMOR-TARGETING DRUG CONJUGATES
Preya Shah
Ward Melville High School, East Setauket, NY

Cancer is the leading cause of death for Americans under the age of 85, resulting in over 1,500 fatalities per day. Despite recent advances in cancer treatment, existing chemotherapeutic agents are suboptimal due to systemic side effects, which stem from the difficulty of targeting only cancer cells while protecting normal tissue, and the development of multi-drug resistance. This project aims to address these problems via the design and synthesis of a novel tumor-targeting drug conjugate containing two cytotoxic agents (warheadsŽ) and a tumor-targeting molecule. <br><br> The cytotoxic warheads used in this study were camptothecin and a second-generation taxoid, SB-T-1214. Since each drug has a different mechanism of action, the conjugate can simultaneously attack the cancer cells on two fronts. Biotin, an essential nutrient consumed in large quantities by cancer cells, was chosen as the tumor-targeting molecule to guide the warheads into malignant cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The biotin molecule was linked with the warheads through mechanism-based cleavable disulfide linkers and a unique splitter comprising three functional handles. Reactions were monitored by thin layer chromatography, and molecular structures of intermediates and products were confirmed by NMR and mass spectrometry analyses. Novel synthetic routes were employed, and the dual-warhead tumor-targeting drug conjugate was successfully synthesized. <br><br> Biological validation studies will give further insight into the efficacy of the drug conjugates. This research provides an innovative approach for the simultaneous delivery of multiple cytotoxic agents to cancer cells at a molecular level, enhancing therapeutic efficacy against various cancer types without causing significant treatment morbidity.

Re-I Chin
Walter Johnson High School, Bethesda, MD

To limit side effects and improve potency against multi-drug resistant tumors, DHA-SB-T-1214, a drug conjugate with exceptional antitumor activity, was synthesized. This conjugate consists of two parts: 1) SB-T-1214, a highly cytotoxic derivative of paclitaxel (Taxol®); 2) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a tumor-targeting moiety. <br><br>To explain the drug’s increased efficacy, some hypothesize that DHA, like the radar in a missile, guides the molecular warhead (SB-T-1214) to tumors. However, there is no direct support for this hypothesis because previous studies do not reveal what biological pathway the drug takes to reach the tumors. Therefore, this project aimed to test the guided molecular missile hypothesis by synthesizing [11C]-methyl-DHA-SB-T-1214 and [11C]-methyl-SB-T-1214 (the control that lacks DHA the tumor-targeting moiety). <br><br>Specifically, schemes were designed to synthesize the radiopharmaceuticals. Furthermore, the reaction conditions for a crucial step, rapid Stille coupling, were determined and optimized using non-radioactive materials through model reactions, increasing the yield from 0% (as previously reported) to 20%. Finally, tributylstannyl substituted baccatin, an unprecedented compound, was synthesized.<br><br>In the future, these radiopharmaceuticals can be injected in mice and traced using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging to study DHA-SB-T-1214’s drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination, or its pharmacokinetics. The results from these studies can also be used to evaluate the drug’s systemic toxicity and to infer its potential side effects prior to clinical trials. More generally, these radiopharmaceuticals can test the guided molecular missile hypothesis to determine the efficacy of DHA, a rather unexplored class of tumor-targeting moiety. Finally, researchers can use the established conditions for rapid Stille coupling to label other molecules with 11C.

GROW YOUR OWN GAS:MAKING CELLULOSIC ETHANOL FROM COMMON BIOMASS
Andrew Joseph Rauh
Divine Child High School, Dearborn, MI

“Grow Your Own Gas: Making Cellulosic Ethanol from Common Biomass” demonstrates that alternative fuels like ethanol can be produced through the breakdown and fermentation of abundant waste materials or any rigid organic matter. This project consisted of three major steps: hydrolysis or breakdown of the cellulose in the biomass; fermentation of glucose; and separation. Five cellulosic materials were selected: grass, sawdust, banana peels, leaves, and newspaper. Then, three sets of these five materials were prepared for the experiment; groups were labeled A, B, and C to correspond to the method of hydrolysis used to break the material down. Group A was exposed to acid, B to cellulase (a cellulose-consuming enzyme), and C to both acid and enzyme, all for seven days. After hydrolysis, the decomposing biomasses were neutralized in pH with lye and fermented with yeast for six days. The resulting product, a mixture of a solid mash, liquid ethanol, and impurities, was separated; the mixture was strained through a mesh screen to remove the solids, and a freeze distillation process was used to remove water. Finally, after two rounds of separation, the resulting liquid was tested with coolant and alcohol breath strips which confirmed the presence of ethanol in all 15 samples. Group C, broken down by the combination of enzyme and acid hydrolysis, produced the strongest presence of ethanol. The presence of ethanol was further confirmed through HPLC (High-Performance Liquid Chromatography).

MAGNETITE NANOCRYSTALS
Erik Doyle Rentz
Colquitt County High, Moultrie, GA

The question was raised as to whether or not one could create Magnetite Nanocrystals in a cost effective manner through the use of common laboratory chemicals. The student set out to solve this problem with the firm belief that the creation of Magnetite Nanocrystals was possible in a cost effective manner. The student then gathered research on the topic. Having gathered said research, the student assembled items necessary to create magnetite nanocrystals including oil, sodium hydroxide, rust, vinegar, and tap water. The student then created lye soap through the mixture of sodium hydroxide, oil, and water. This soap was then used in solution with vinegar to create a fatty acid mixture. This mixture was then combined with rust and heated for two hours until a sludge-like material formed. This sludge-like material was then added to a lye soap and water solution and heated until dissolved. A strong magnet was then placed beside the resultant solution and nanocrystals were allowed to form. These nanocrystals would then be added to a solution of arsenic laced water which would then be qualitatively analyzed to determine the magnetite nanocrystal's ability to remove arsenic from water.

THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT LEVELS OF NITRIFICATION ON CHLORINATION IN A WASTEWATER TREATMENT FACILITY
Morgan Rachael Henrie
Weber High School, Pleasant View, UT

Wastewater treatment uses three basic processes: solids removal, nitrification for ammonia reduction and chlorination to remove harmful bacteria such as E.coli. A review of wastewater data collected at a Utah Wastewater Treatment Facility (WWTF) indicates that the effectiveness of the nitrification process, the conversion of ammonia to nitrite and then to nitrate, is highly dependent on the season of the year. It was hypothesized that residual ammonia from incomplete nitrification will hinder the subsequent chlorination process by decreasing the amount of free chlorine available to kill harmful bacteria.<br><br>Two basic experiments were conducted in the laboratory at this Utah WWTF. The first experiment developed a method for bench-top nitrification to better understand the nitrification process. The second experiment involved creating simulated samples of wastewater with different concentrations of ammonia, nitrite and nitrate based on the levels shown in the wastewater data. These samples were then treated with various concentrations of chlorine and evaluated with a spectrophotometer to determine the levels of residual chlorine<br><br>Results indicated that when ammonia and/or nitrate were present in the wastewater, approximately 30% of the chlorine was consumed. However, it was discovered that when nitrite was present, there was virtually no residual chlorine. These experiments show that the most vulnerable time for the wastewater treatment chlorination process is during the spring or fall when the nitrification process is only partially complete and nitrite is present. Understanding these phenomena could prove to be very important in controlling the release of potentially harmful effluent to the environment.

VAPORIZATION OF GRAPHITE POWDER FOR FORMATION OF NANOTUBES: ADDING AN ALLOTROPE TO THE CARBON PHASE DIAGRAM
Jennifer Erin Goldberg
Orion Junior High School, Harrisville, UT

Nanotubes are a cutting edge material, useful in applications ranging from cancer research to thermal management to sensors. Their basic structure consists of six carbon atoms bonded in a hexagonal shape, replicated multiple times in a lattice that curls to make a cylinder. While current manufacturing approaches are complex, this research assessed the viability of an ambient atmosphere microwave to produce nanotubes, and those variables that might control their production. This research also focused on locating the nanotube allotrope on a carbon phase diagram for ambient pressures, something not noted in current literature. Variables included substrate location with respect to the vaporized carbon and heating time of the graphite. <br><br>Tests were conducted in 15, 20, 25, and 30 minute heating intervals varying the position of the substrate (first placing it in the center, then back edge, then forward edge of a crucible containing highly pure graphite in micron size powder form) to ascertain the amount of nanotubes produced from each interaction. <br><br>The greatest quantity, albeit limited, of nanotubes was formed from the 20 minute tests with the substrate having the least amount of contact with the carbon vapor, or on the back edge. Tests performed with the substrate on the front edge or in the center could not complete the test due to melting or softening of the substrate. Substrates were evaluated using both Atomic Force and Scanning Electron Microscopes to determine the indicated presence of nanotubes. This also allowed documentation of the nanotube allotrope on the carbon phase diagram.

SYNTHESIS OF FLUORESCENT SILICA NANOPARTICLES CONJUGATED WITH RGD PEPTIDE FOR DETECTION OF INVASIVE HUMAN BREAST CANCER CELLS.
Shamik Mascharak
Santa Cruz High School, Santa Cruz, CA

In this project, non-toxic fluorescent silica nanoparticles have been synthesized (by Stober's method) that also contain an RGD peptide probe to interact with specific proteins on the cancer cell surface. First, a batch of 69 mg of APTS and 5.25 mg FITC was dissolved in 1 mL of absolute ethanol under dry N2 atmosphere to isolate the fluorescent silane reagent. Next, 50 microL of the FITC-ATPS conjugate, 15 microL of THPMP (to prevent aggregation), 100 microL TEOS and 100 microL ammonium hydroxide were reacted in a water/oil microemulsion. After 24 hours, the microemulsion system was destabilized by adding denatured ethanol, and the FSNPs were collected by centrifugation. The FSNPs were subsequently washed and centrifuged (2000 RPM, 10 min) 4 times with ethanol and 2 times with DI water. The FSNPs were checked for quality via TEM (70 nm) and fluorescence microscopy (515 nm), and confirmed to be consistent in shape and size. Their fluorescence did not decrease over time. For tumor targeting, the FSNPs were further conjugated to cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Tyr-Cys) peptide with the use of 3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (SPDP) in DMSO (stirring for 12 hours at room temperature). The fluorescence properties of the peptide-nanoparticle conjugates were checked via fluorescent spectroscopy and TEM imaging. Both peptide-FSNP conjugates and FSNPs were then added to MCF7 (non-invasive breast cancer cells), MDA-MB 435 (transformed human breast cancer cells), and MDA-MB 231 (metastasized breast cancer cells) grown in 8-well trays (2 days, 5% CO2 atmosphere). After 2 hrs, the cells were thoroughly washed, fixed, stained with DAPI, and subjected to fluorescence microscopy. The FSNPs synthesized in this project showed a narrow range of dispersivity (70 nm) as indicated by the TEM images. The FSNPs are stable in aqueous buffer over weeks and strongly fluoresce at 515 nm. The FSNP-RGD peptide conjugates selectively got attached to the high concentration of integrins expressed on the surface of the metastasized cancer cells. In the case of the non-invasive cells, the expression of integrin was low and hence such cells showed very few FSNPs on the cell surface. The results confirm that FSNP-RGD conjugates are excellent imaging tools for the detection of invasive cancer cells.

DYE-SENSITIZED SOLAR CELLS
Matthew Tse
Clearfield High School, Clearfield, UT

“Going Green” has become increasingly popular. Alternative fuel sources are increasingly attractive because of the growing demand and decreasing supplies of fossil fuels. Silicon solar cells are currently the most commercially used and efficient solar cells. However, silicon costs are high and thus few are considering this branch of alternative fuels. Dye-sensitized solar cells are a relatively new branch of solar energy that are lower in cost than the traditional silicon solar cells, but have been found to be lacking in efficiency. My purpose is to use different plant materials to find a viable, cost-effective energy source for third world countries. I created a solar cell using a titanium dioxide layer sintered onto a piece of conductive glass. The layer accepted a dye based on cranberries, raspberries, and/or blueberries. These cells were tested for efficiency in terms of potential voltage. The blueberry dye produced no measurable results, the cranberry dye produced 0.120 to 0.305 v in ambient lighting, and the raspberry dye produced 0.232 to 0.2662 v in ambient lighting, -0.03663 to 0.1490 v in controlled conditions (in darkness), and 0.188 – 0.3101 v in controlled conditions (in darkness with a fluorescent light). It appears that the anthocyanin dye is a significant factor in producing efficient dye-sensitized solar cells. Sorghum has high amounts of anthocyanin and is widely found throughout the world. This now makes dye-sensitized solar cells a viable source for third-world countries.

THE NONHOMOGENEOUS INTERMOLECULAR BONDING STRUCTURE OF LIQUID WATER: AN X-RAY STUDY
Bryce William Cronkite-Ratcliff
Crystal Springs Uplands School, Hillsborough, CA

A detailed understanding of the bonding structure of ambient liquid water is of high importance and interest. The intention of this project is to probe the bulk structure of ambient water with a novel X-ray technique to determine the details of its intermolecular structure.<br><br> X-ray Raman based X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Spectroscopy is a novel X-ray technique that uses hard X-rays to probe for absorption information that lies in the soft X-ray region. Experiments were performed at a high-brightness synchrotron lightsource with incident energy ranges of ~6-7 KeV. Using a 14-crystal analyzer spectrometer, the energy losses (~500 eV) necessary to observe the oxygen K-edge were detectable with high energy resolution. Spectra were analyzed by comparison with hexagonal ice spectra and by application of a model based on Density Functional Theory.<br><br> The spectral analysis suggests that liquid water is not a near-homogeneous distribution of tetrahedrally bonded molecules, as has been generally thought. Instead, a nonhomogeneous bonding model is presented, wherein about 80% of water molecules are bonded to only two neighbors while about 20% are bonded to four neighboring molecules. This finding is supported by some studies, but is disputed by others.

VENISON SAFETY: LEAD CONCERNS
Alydia Marie Rodriguez
South High School, Minneapolis, MN

When reports recently came out showing that venison meat (from legal rifle kills) was unfit to eat for pregnant women or children due to lead introduced by the bullets, many were shocked.  In this study, two hypotheses were tested: <br><br>1. Deer shot once with a quick kill shot will have lower levels of lead in the meat than those shot twice or those who live more than one minute after being shot; and<br><br>2. Deer shot once in the head will have no lead in any meat. <br><br>Meat samples were taken from four specific areas on seven deer (shot with the same bullets) as well as next to the bullet fragment and 3” away from the fragment (DNR recommendation for safe meat).  Samples were autoclaved and returned to the school lab for testing.  <br><br>The first hypothesis was somewhat supported.  The deer killed with a quick kill shot had the lowest levels of lead (35.6 ug/kg), those living .1-1 minute had the highest amount of lead (46.9 ug/kg), those living more than one minute had on average 41.7 ug/kg.  <br><br>The second hypothesis was refuted. Only one deer was killed with a head shot, a yearling, but it had the fourth highest lead level (31.25 ug/kg).  <br><br>It is recommended that no level of lead is safe for children to consume and most of the meat had some lead. However, all meat tested was considerably lower than the 500 ug/kg considered safe for adults to consume.

RHODIUM COMPLEXES OF N-HETEROCYCLIC CARBENES: CATALYSTS FOR GREEN CHEMISTRY?
Jonathan Edward Rajaseelan
Lancaster Country Day School, Lancaster, PA

N-Heterocylic carbenes (NHCs) and their role as universal spectator ligands in transition metal compounds have recently sparked a wide interest in the broader field of Green Chemistry because of their astounding catalytic properties in reactions involving organic synthesis. This project dealt specifically with the synthesis of new Rhodium NHC complexes, derived from triazole, via high-yielding air stable procedures. Six of these Rhodium complexes were successfully synthesized, three neutral complexes by transmetallation from Ag(I) complexes, and subsequently three more cationic complexes were isolated by treating the neutral complexes with triphenylphospine and silver tetrafluoroborate. They were characterized by elemental analysis and multi-nuclear NMR, and the structures of one neutral complex and all of the ionic complexes were further determined by x-ray diffraction. The complexes display a square planar geometry and the Rh-CNHC distances between the NHC ligand and the Rhodium atom range from 2.017-2.034 Å. Most significantly one ionic complex yielded two polymorphs, displaying the first structural evidence of rotation about the metal-carbene bond. All three of the ionic complexes synthesized in this project exhibited good catalytic activity for transfer hydrogenation on C=O and C=N double bonds in 2-propanol. These NHC complexes have numerous potential applications in many industrial and pharmaceutical processes, and can be extensively used in the future as effective catalysts in Green Chemistry.

PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF SAMPLES OF SIMULATED STOMACH LIQUIDS TO TEST LIPIDS DEGRADATION USING THE POWDER EXTRACTS OF BIXA ORELLANA SEEDS
Eneisha Ivelisse Santiago
Elvira M. Colon Negron, Puerto Rico, PUERTO RICO

This research intends to find out which components are found in the stomach liquids preparations, after the lipids degradation process. The hypothesis is that there is no lipids presence in the stomach liquids containing the Bixa orellana natural preparation.<br><br>Bixa orellana (Annatto) properties are analyzed using the liquid preparations obtained from the stomach liquid simulations that were performed in the first phase of this research. These preparations contain 0.1N HCl. Different oils and fats with the natural preparation of Bixa orellana and the corresponding control groups were used to determine the presence of lipids using chemical reactions. These chemical reactions evidenced the minimum presence of cholesterol and triglycerides. The following different chemical tests were performed: Triglycerides Saponification Test, positive for all samples; Halogenation test for the presence of unsaturated lipids, negative for samples except for the experimental Olive oil sample, was positive; Liebermann-Burchard test for the presence of cholesterol, which was negative for all experimental samples. The pH value of oils and butters were determined obtaining 6 (slightly acid). Bixa orellana seeds tests were performed to determine the approximate amount of dye from Annatto, which is necessary to degrade different oils and fats. The necessary amount obtained was 0.0891g. Identification of quinones was performed, resulting in the presence of the β-hydroxylated quinones. Artemia salina bioassays were performed to determine the toxicity of Annatto, which was negative. Bixa orellana accelerates digestion and is a natural lipids degrader but it leaves minimal presence of lipids that are necessary for human beings.

DEVELOPING AN IMPROVED SYNTHETIC PROCESS TO PRAMICONAZOLE INTERMEDIATES
Emma Jean Graham
Lisgar Collegiate Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA

The aim of my project was to develop an improved synthetic pathway to Pramiconazole Intermediates. Pramiconazole is a new drug for skin fungal infections (eg. Athletes foot). The Pramiconazole intermediate that I chose is created by two reactions. The first reaction, which involves an amine alkyation to form a piperazine product, is called Study 1. The second reaction, which involves nucleophilic aromatic substitution to make Intermediate 1, is called Study 2. The aim of Study 1 was to eliminate chromatography, produce a time and material efficient process that could be incorporated into the drug manufacturing process of Pramiconazole on a multi-ton scale, and to optimize overall yield and quality. The aim of Study 2 was to incorporate the improved product into the reaction, to see if Study 1’s new method was viable. I was successful in all these aims and objectives. In brief, Study 1: Data Set 1-1 was used to find the optimal mole ratio, data Set 2 was used to find the optimal reaction solvent, data Set 3 was used to find the optimal HCl protonation solvent, data Set 3 was used to find the optimal dilution and extraction solvents, data Set 5 was used to find the optimal purification solvent, and data Set 6 was used to explore a potential alternative method to protonate the dihydrochloride salts. Study 2: Data Set 1 was used to verify that the new procedure could be successful in the existing manufacturing process. It was successful.

OBSERVATION OF ARTIFICIAL ENZYME BIRTH BY ULTRAVIOLET-VISIBLE LIGHT
Gerardo Valdez Vivanco
Preparatoria Alfonso Calderon Moreno-BUAP, Puebla, MEXICO

Peroxidases are present in living organisms and they are biologic catalyst named enzymes. These enzymes use the hydrogen peroxide in excesses present in living organisms. Human organism produce hydrogen peroxide as protect mechanism and reject aggressive agents which attack him. When hydrogen peroxide exterminates these aggressive agents, there is an excess which attacks the healthy cells. In this moment some enzymes, as peroxidase, appear and use this excess of hydrogen peroxide, transforming it in simple and inoffensive water. To know the functionality of the peroxidase enzymes more simple molecules are synthesized in the laboratory. Some these molecules are mimetic compounds of enzymes. Our research group has synthesized compounds of the pinch-porphyrins family which act as peroxidase enzymes. Our hypothesis is that it is possible to obtain a new molecule of the pinch-porphyrin family which will act as peroxidase enzyme. In this work we are reporting an obtaining method of the new pinch-porphyrin and a visual qualitative assay named guaiacol test, and a study by a spectrophotometer of UV-Vis light, which shows the guaiacol products oxidation spectra through the time. Both assays are proofs of peroxidase enzymes activity. It is important to say that the results reported in this work are comparative with others reported on pinch-porphyrin compounds. The more important contributions of this work are: the obtaining and proof of that a new artificial enzyme was born.

COOLING WATER OPTIMIZATION IN LABORATORY DISTILLATIONS
Alejandra Ramirez Barrios
Cetis 96, Estado de Mexico, MEXICO

This project has the purpose of implementing a cooling system by recirculation for practices of distillations in laboratory of junior high school and superior educative level in Mexico, with the primary target to avoid the potable water waste, because a laboratory session wastes approximately 1440 liters of water, in addition it is tried to promote the redesign of laboratory equipment to optimize resources. In this work the material and procedures for the construction and handling of the cooling system were chosen. The variable to study was the composition of the cooling liquid, which will low the temperature of the cooling water that will recirculate in the distillation equipment, this investigation was based on the following criteria:<br><br>1) Increase of temperature of cooling liquid versus time of distillation. <br><br>2) Freezing and boiling temperatures of the cooling liquids. <br><br>The data collection was obtained: a) Distilling water to a constant temperature of 94ºC, cooling and warming up to boiling point the cooling liquids. Similarly the procedures were designed to prolong the time of distillation, to install, to operate and to give maintenance to the cooling system. With the development of the project it get myself to conclude that the prototype is totally feasible techniquely, ecologically and economically, since the used technology and materials are of easy acquisition and in the ecological aspect the potable water waste is avoided. The project is economic in the acquisition (52 dls) and in the operation because the electrical energy consumption for the operation is under (11W/h).

DESIGN AND SYNTHESIS OF A NOVEL T-TYPE CA2+ CHANNEL BLOCKER
Seunghyun Oh
Korean Minjok Leadership Academy, Gangwon, SOUTH KOREA

The ultimate goal of this study is to design and synthesize a new T-type Ca2+ channel blocker that is structurally simpler than previously developed Ca2+ channel blockers, but equally effective and selective for blocking the channels. I changed the central loop of morpholin-2-one to cyclic dipeptide. Two amide groups in cyclic dipeptide provide greater stability and make synthesis easier. Also, hydrogen bonds formed among those amide groups can generate more derivatives and diverse interactions. Phenyl groups, a common characteristic of the existing Ca2+ channel blockers, were maintained in the new T-type Ca2+ channel blocker.<br><br>To test virtually whether the structure of the new T-type Ca2+ channel blocker is suitable for its function, HIPHOP model was used. Major functional groups of the new blocker mostly match well with those of existing Ca2+ channel blockers, but a positively charged functional group was missing in the new blocker. This difference could show the potential importance of the positively charged functional group for the blocker to function. Through retrosynthetic analysis, I decided aspartic acid and p-chlorophenylalanine as starting materials for synthesizing the target molecule. Protection/deprotection reaction and nucleophilic acylation were used as key tools. The structure of the final product was confirmed by mass spectrum and 1H-NMR. Relatively low biological activity of the new blocker indicated that the missing positively charged functional group can be important for inhibition of Ca2+ channels. For future research, I am planning to attach an alkylamino group to the nitrogen in cyclic dipeptide of the new blocker.

SYNTHESIS OF ZIRCONIUM PHTHALOCYANINE AND HAFNIUM PHTHALOCYANINE
Kemakorn Ithisuphalap
Manhattan International High School, New York, NY

Abstract:<br><br>Zirconium phthalocyanine and hafnium phthalocyanine were prepared in different ways. Zirconium phthalocyanine was made by inserting metal ion (from zirconium tetrachloride) into free-base phthalocyanine that has already been made. Inversely, hafnium does not easily go into the free-base phthalocyanine rings, so we have to make the hafnium phthalocyanine by building a phthalocyanine ring around the metal ion (using hafnium tetrachloride as starting material). However, both of the products have similar properties.Zirconium and hafnium phthalocyanine dichlorides were only soluble in DMSO. The goal is to use these metallophthalocyanines to absorb sunlight in solar cell systems, so these metal phthalocyanines need to be attached to TiO2 surface. In order to do this, we made zirconiumdiacetate phthalocyanine Zr(OOCHCH3)2Pc and hafnium-diacetate phthalocyanine Hf(OOCHCH3)2Pc. These compounds are more soluble in other organic solvents that do not contain oxygen (O).

THE EFFECT OF FOUR CONCENTRATIONS OF A BORAX BASED FIRE RETARDANT ON THE IGNITION TIME AND COMBUSTION RATE OF COTTON FABRIC
Stephanie Michelle Ackerson
Spring Valley High School, Columbia, SC

There is concern about the health effects of flame retardants (FRs), such as brominated FRs. The purpose of this experiment was to make a natural FR that would lower the ignition time and combustion rate of cotton. It was hypothesized that cotton treated with a borax based FR would have a lower combustion rate and a higher ignition time than the untreated cotton. Different amounts of borax, 42.5g, 56.7g, 70.9g, and 85g were mixed with 473mL of water. After the borax was dissolved the cotton was soaked in the solution, left to dry, and the fabric was ignited. Stopwatches were used to measure the amount of time it took to ignite, as well as the time it took to burn completely. The control was cotton without the borax-water solution. One-way ANOVAs were conducted on the ignition time and combustion rate. For both ignition time and combustion rate the p-value was 0.001< alpha at 0.05. A Tukey Test indicated the 0.09g/ml concentration and 0.15g/ml or above had a positive, significant effect on the ignition time of the cotton, compared to the control. A 0.12g/ml concentration, and higher had a positive, significant effect on the combustion rate of the cotton, compared to the control. Therefore, the study indicated that a natural, borax based FR has a positive effect on the ignition time and combustion rate of cotton fabric at the 0.12g/ml concentration and above. Meaning that the combustion rate was lowered considerably and the ignition time was raised considerably.

DAMAGING EFFECTS OF ETHANOL VS. GASOLINE ON RUBBER PARTS FOUND IN AUTOMOBILE AND OTHER INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES
Michael Tyler Stansell
Paul M. Dorman High School, Roebuck, SC

The most common fuels used in internal combustion engines are gasoline and ethanol. While either of these fuels can be used in engines, recent market events and escalating costs have generated an increased level of public interest in substituting ethanol for gasoline. My purpose was to determine if ethanol is more damaging than gasoline to rubber parts such as o-ring seals commonly found in automotive engines. Ethanol is hydrophilic so it absorbs moisture from its environment. If the water in ethanol is greater than one percent, it may form an acid that can attack the hydrogen bonds and cause the rubber to weaken.<br><br><br> Two methods were used to simulate and accelerate the effects of exposure of the o-rings to varied concentrations of ethanol and gasoline. The first method was to expose rubber o-rings to the mixtures at elevated temperature for several one hour intervals and the second method was to expose o-rings to the mixtures continuously for a period of several days. O-rings were tested at intervals of exposure to measure tenacity (stretch length under load) and elasticity (recovery from stretching). <br><br><br> The data collected did not support the hypothesis that more ethanol rich mixtures would cause greater damage to rubber parts. Specifically, under these experimental conditions there was no evidence to support the hypothesis that ethanol is more damaging than gasoline to the nitrile butadiene rubber o-rings tested. A greater length of exposure, perhaps several months, combined with more sensitive and sophisticated testing equipment could possibly provide more conclusive results.

NOVEL RU-POLYPYRIDYL COMPLEXES FOR ELECTROCHEMICAL CARBON DIOXIDE REDUCTION
Tyler Dane Swenson
Dickinson High School, Dickinson, ND

Five novel divalent Ruthenium complexes all containing the tridentate ligand 2,6-(5,6-dimethyl-1,2,4-triazin-3-yl)pyridine (C1btp) analogous to known Ru-terpyrine (tpy) complexes were synthesized in good yield. The homoleptic Ru-C1btp complex and a mixed Ru-C1btp/tpy complex were measured with UV/Visible spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry and compared to known optical and electronic data for the analogous Ru-tpy complex. Results show that the HOMO-LUMO gap is increased in C1btp complexes while the Ru-centered t2g electrons are stabilized and the ligand-centered pi* orbitals are stabilized as well. Several heteroleptic complexes combining the Ru-C1btp backbone and PPh3, Cl, and CO ligands were synthesized for proton assisted electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction. Two complexes successfully catalyzed the reduction of carbon dioxide as evidenced by cyclic voltammetry experiments.

CHEMICAL SOIL ANALYSIS OF ANASAZI CORN
Ronita Mukherjee
The Meadows School, Las Vegas, NV

The plant Truchas Lumbroso is a variety of Zea Mays planted by prehistoric Anasazi whose seeds have been found at our excavation sites. Archaeologists have assumed this was the species of corn that grew in that soil, but no tests have ever been conducted to test whether this plant actually grows well in that area. The purpose of my experiment was to test Truchas Lumbroso growth in region 27 (Bureau of Land Management of Mt. Trumbull) and compare the soil of region 27 to other soils found in Anasazi territory in terms of pH, soil moisture and nitrogen content. I obtained three major soil types from 5 different locations and tested their soil properties by using a drying oven, a pH meter, and a nitrogen measuring kit. Then I planted three different varieties of Zea Mays corn planted by the Virgin Anasazi in a soil sample from area 27 and tracked their growth. From my data, I concluded that the area 27 soil is uniform in regards to these three components and distinctly different from the other two soils. Truchas Lumbroso germinates the quickest and grows the highest out of the three main types of corn plants (Truchas Lumbroso, Manzano Yellow, and Hopi Greasy Head) in the soil of area 27. Thus Truchas Lumbroso is the a best adapted plant out of the three major types of Zea Mays corn in terms of pH, water content and nitrogen to grow in area 27.

DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF OZONE EQUIVALENTS FOR THE OXIDATIVE CLEAVAGE OF ALKENES
Prem P. Thottumkara
Macomb High School, Macomb, IL

Oxidation of functional groups is of paramount importance in synthetic organic chemistry and an arsenal of reagents is now available in the repertoire of synthetic organic chemists to affect desired oxidative transformations during multi-step syntheses of organic compounds. A variety of compounds with different functional groups can be readily accessed from alkenes through oxidative transformations. The currently available and widely accepted protocols for oxidative functionalization of alkenes involve the use of ozone or catalytic use of toxic osmium tetroxide (OsO4). Due to the toxicity of OsO4 and the inconvenience associated with the generation and use of ozone, alternate methods for the oxidative functionalization of alkenes are desirable. The growing demand for eco-friendly chemical processes and reagents prompted the experimenter to investigate the possibility of using a water-soluble hypervalent iodine reagent as a substitute for ozone to oxidatively cleave alkenes. Use of an in-situ generated hypervalent iodine reagent from 4-iodobenzoic acid and Oxone® in aqueous solvent mixtures for oxidative cleavage and functionalization of alkenes is described herein. The utility of the new procedure for functionlaization of alkenes using environmentally benign reagents and eco-friendly solvent mixtures is demonstrated with six different alkene substrates. Alkenes that are conjugated to aromatic systems are readily cleaved while non-conjugated alkenes provide quantitative yield of trans-1,2-diols as products. The proposed reaction mechanism for the observed oxidation/cleavage explains the noted selectivity between conjugated and non-conjugated alkenes and also explains the amount of Oxone® required with varying amounts of 4-iodobenzoic acid used in the new catalytic procedure.

FIGHTING FABRIC FADING: USING MORDANTS TO MAINTAIN TEXTILE COLOR
Lisa Nicole Fink
Noblesville High School, Noblesville, IN

Mordants decrease natural dyes’ color fading in textiles by chemically binding dye material to wool fabrics. The purpose of this project was to determine which mordant best maintains the colors of certain natural dyes in wool textiles. Alum was hypothesized to most effectively maintain the indigo, black oak, and onion skin colors, while tin was hypothesized to best hold the logwood and cochineal colors.<br><br>Wool skeins were mordanted with aluminum potassium sulfate, copper (II) sulfate, iron (II) sulfate, or tin (IV) chloride, while a control group of skeins was unmordanted. The skeins were then dyed with logwood chips, indigo, black oak sawdust, onion skins, or cochineal. The initial color of the skeins was measured using the "Munsell Book of Colors". All skeins then underwent a series of washes, with the color of each skein measured after each wash.<br><br>Variegated skein colors and subjective interpretation of colors using the "Munsell Book of Colors" created potential sources of error. Using one-way ANOVA tests, no mordant was found to best hold black oak and cochineal dyes, alum best maintained the color of indigo and onion skin dyes, and iron best held the logwood dye. However, these results were not statistically significant, indicated by P-values above a .025 alpha level in one-sided t-tests.<br><br>The hypothesis could be neither proved nor disproved. Further experimentation involving more washes could reveal how to prevent natural dyes’ color fading in artistic or historically reproduced textiles. Similar theories applied to synthetic dyes could reduce color fading in mass-produced textiles.

SYNTHESIS OF CHEMILUMINESCENT FLUORENE BASED LIGANDS
Joseph Katigbak
William L. Dickinson High School, Jersey City, NJ

Chemiluminescent behavior have been observed in several organic compounds that could be used for the development of light emitting sources. Specifically, flourene based molecules have shown great promise in the field of chemiluminescence as they emit light in the blue end of the visible light spectrum when electrically excited. Novel flourene based luminophore ligands were synthesized for their unique luminescent properties that could be used in the production of Organic Light Emitting Diodes. <br><br> 9,9-Dioctylflourenyl bridged O-8-Quinolate Ligand was prepared using a Suzuki-Miyaura to coupling attach the 9,9 dioctyl dibromoflourene to the p-Octooxyphenyl boronic acid and extending the molecule through flourene bridges by repeated coupling reactions. NMR analysis was done to determine the placement of the carbon atoms and the spatial orientation protons within the molecule. <br><br> The NMR spectra confirmed the structural configuration of the molecule; the ligand was aligned congruently in a plane of symmetry viewed from above the di-octyl fluorene component. The Infrared spectra showed the proper placement of the octooxy substituent in the boronic acid component and the di-octyl groups in the fluorene component. The conjugated di-octyl fluorene component showed a λ max of 266 nm, while the boronic acid showed a λ max of 238 nm from UV spectroscopy. Varying the length of the flourene-bridge or adding different functional groups to the fluorene components would control the luminescent behavior of the molecule allowing for the synthesis of luminophores with a wide array of possible light absorption and emission properties.

AN INNOVATIVE METHOD TO IMPROVE YIELDS OF BIODIESEL
Laya Varanasi
Roy C. Ketcham Senior High School, Wappingers Falls, NY

With the recent energy crisis, alternative, renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and biofuels have received increasing attention worldwide. Biodiesel, made from biodegradable resources like oils and fats via transesterification, is the focus of this project. <br><br> Transesterification can be catalyzed by acids, bases, or enzymes, but base catalysts are usually preferred because they are less corrosive and have shorter reaction times. Although bases like metal hydroxide in alcohol are inexpensive, they form water when mixed together, and the water hydrolyzes the product ester to form soap. <br><br> The main objective of this research was to develop an efficient method to remove the water without adding more chemical agents. Since molecular sieves (porous solids) of the right pore size adsorb water, this project explored their use in the base catalyzed transesterification.<br><br> For the experiments, a mixture containing soybean oil, methanol, sodium hydroxide and molecular sieves was heated at 60 degrees C for an hour. The sieves were filtered, and the mixture was extracted with hexane. Thin Layer Chromatography and Spectroscopic methods were used for product analysis. A control experiment run without using molecular sieves led to the formation of an emulsion. With molecular sieves, more than 85% of the product was extracted easily. <br><br> This project provides a novel method to remove water formed in the base catalyzed transesterification, leading to shorter reaction times, potentially lower costs and better yields of biodegradable fuel. Patentability of this work is being explored.

In This Experiment I was testing to see if it was possible to make a viable fuel for diesel engines in a Backyard Environment. My father and my uncle driving diesel vehicles and being interested in making Bio-Diesel to supplement if not replace their petrochemical need helped this project to develop. The Bio-Diesel that is made from waste cooking oil is also more efficient to run and is made from a wasted product that restaurants had to pay to get rid of. <br><br> This project is a complete creation of bio-diesel from the gathering or purchasing of the waste cooking oil, all the way through to the burning of the diesel on the road. I started gathering oil from restaurants, I turned to purchasing it from those who gather from restaurants and filter the oil for efficency. I then proceeded to refine the oil by figuring the amount of Free-fatty acid and then proceeding to create a reaction to drop that number so that it is consistent with the petrochemical variety of Diesel. This process involves a correct combination of Methanol, and Lye, KOH or NaOH. The reaction which is catalyzed by heat as well as agitated, results in a mixture of Bio-Diesel and Glycol, a common ingredient in soap this is then strained run through a centrifuge to clean any remaining debris.

NEW CHEMICAL ROUTES TO THE CYCLOPROPYL AND BETA-PERFLUOROALKYLAMINO GROUPS BY "ONE-POT"-REACTIONS
Aleksandr Ya. Vorontsov, Mikhail A. Kozlov,

The cyclopropyl group is a vital structural unit in many synthetic and naturally occurring compounds, exhibiting a wide spectrum of biologic properties ranging from enzyme inhibition to antitumor and antiviral activities. The amines containing at the ALPHA-position fluorinated substitutent have attracted significant attention due to their diverse biological activity: from pharmaceutics to agrochemicals. But these fragments are difficult to access by known methods which are demanding uses of expensive reactants and equipment, long time of process, and yields of products are quite low.<br><br>We have set the task to facilitate access to these fragments, and as, our laboratory is researching cascade reactions, we have proposed and developed three new cascades.<br><br>Cascade transformation of aldehydes and malononitrile under action of active halogen containing compounds in basis alcohol solutions leads to the formation of 3-aryl-1,1,2,2-tetracyanocyclopropanes in 45-85% yields at ambient temperature over a 3 hours reaction period.<br><br>''One-pot''-transformation of aldehydes, secondary/primary amines, TMSOTf/MeOTf and TMSCF3 under action Lewis base in DMF results in the formation of ALPHA-perfluoroalkylsubstituted amines in 50-95% yields over a 1-2 hours reaction period.<br><br>''One-pot''-transformation of 1-benzylpyrrolidin-2-one, MeOTf and TMSCF3 under action Lewes base in DMF gives rise to the formation of 1-benzyl-2-methoxy-2-(trifluoromethyl)pyrrolidine (80% yield) which reacts with nucleophiles with the formation of the 2-substituted-1-benzyl-2-(trifluoromethyl)pyrrolidines in 70-85% yields.<br><br>Our reactions are ''one-pot''-processes which allow to obtain efficiently these fragments with high yields during a short period of time. Moreover we have assembled cyclopropane systems from 3 molecules of two different types by chemical route.

TOWARD NOVEL ANTIMICROBIAL DRUG DISCOVERY TARGETING CELL DIVISION
Shalini Pammal, Samantha McKenna, 
Commack High School, Commack, NY

The current focus of bacterial disease study has shifted to the development of new antibacterial agents with the rapid global expansion of bacteria resistant to antimicrobial agents and the recent evolution of strains of multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Thus, new antibacterial agents are crucial to make the treatment of MRSA, MDR-TB, and other potentially lethal infectious bacterial diseases more efficient and convenient to administer. Benzimidazole–based compounds have the potential to offer a novel approach in the development of such drugs, as they target FtsZ (Filamental temperature sensitive protein Z), an essential protein involved in the cell division process of bacterial cells. In this study, both lab synthesis and computational analysis are utilized to design novel trisubstituted benzimidazole compounds which will ultimately be tested for antibacterial activity and ability to inhibit FtsZ (de)polymerization. A library of compounds was synthesized and will undergo biological testing for their antibacterial activity against MRSA and Mtb strains. These compounds have wider implications and are not limited to MDR-TB and MRSA. When these compounds were entered into a computational analysis program (DOCK) and bound into a virtual model of the Mtb FtsZ protein molecule, compound SB-P3G2 was found to destabilize the T3 loop of the protein, providing evidence that the compound will inhibit FtsZ (de)polymerization in Mtb. Additionally, a unique model of the MRSA FtsZ protein was created to analyze the binding site of our compounds.

A COMPARISON OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LIQUID & SOLID DEICERS WHEN APPLIED INDEPENDENTLY & CONCURRENTLY
Lynnely Greye Parker, Bailie Bryant, 
Central Lee High School, Donnellson, IA

We selected this project after learning of an impending shortage of traditional fossil-based liquid deicer. Winter weather related airport delays already totaled $50+ million annually. The significant time, cost and safety factors warranted further research.<br><br>Our project compared fossil-based & bio-based liquid deicers, plus a solid deicer to determine which was most effective to melt ice. We compared whether they are most effective independently or concurrently. If concurrently, which application order was most effective? We factored in environmental and cost concerns.<br><br>Established test protocols assisted with an overall procedure outline. However, our project incorporated new bio-based deicers and application sequences. Dual product application and testing of the new bio-based products had not been previously conducted.<br><br>Specified amounts of distilled water were placed in Petri dishes and frozen to specified temperatures. Specified quantities of deicers were introduced at specified time intervals. Brine was decanted, volumes measured/recorded. Procedures were repeated for three sample sets, at three different temperatures for each independent product. The procedure was then repeated introducing the liquid first, followed by the solid and vice versa with 114 samples tested.<br><br>Our studies concluded solid deicer was the most effective individual deicer at all temperatures tested. This proved our first hypothesis incorrect. Concurrently, N Liquid (partial bio-based) on solid was most effective at the highest temperature/time intervals. At lower temperatures/time intervals, X Liquid (bio-based) followed by solid was the most effective overall. This proved our second hypothesis incorrect as well. Application order was most significant at the lowest temperature.

CAN MASS SPECTRA BE OBTAINED DIRECTLY FROM A TLC SEPARATION OF LIPIDS FROM MYCOBACTERIUM AVIUM?
Caroline June Trippel, Caitlyn Koscielski, 
Marian High School, Mishawaka, IN

Tuberculosis (TB), a disease which afflicts millions of people, is caused by the organism Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). When studying the disease, the benign organism, Mycobacterium avium (M. avium), a member of the same class of organisms as M. tuberculosis, is often used as a safer alternative. On the surface of M. avium are glycopeptidolipids (GPLs), which cause the host immune system to recognize an infection. These GPLs can be extracted and purified to determine their chemical structures. The common method of this analysis includes the following time consuming steps: total lipid extraction from M. avium, separation of GPLs from this lipid extraction using thin layer chromatography (TLC), removal of GPL bands from the TLC plate, and chemical characterization by mass spectrometry. The goal of this experiment was to develop a reliable and reproducible method to obtain mass spectra of GPLs from a total lipid separation directly off the surface of a TLC plate. Imaging Mass Spectrometry was performed using the technique of matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI). MALDI produces gas phase ions by using laser light energy to desorb material from a sample surface coated with a matrix compound. A thin coating of matrix was added directly to a TLC plate which contained separated GPLs. The resultant GPL ions were then detected by a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. An image was then acquired using the mass spectra of the ions detected, resulting in an efficient way to obtain spectra directly from a TLC separation.

PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF HYDROGEN PEROXIDE USED IN AN AUTOCLAVE FOR STERILIZATION: YEAR SIX OF AN ONGOING STUDY
Aubrey Ward Craig, II
Collegiate High School at Northwest Florida State College, Niceville, FL

Will Hydrogen Peroxide be more effective than water when used for sterilization in an autoclave? Will a higher concentration of Hydrogen Peroxide be more effective than a lower one? Will a longer period of time be more effective than a shorter one? The purpose of my project is to study the effects of using Hydrogen Peroxide in an autoclave for sterilization compared to water. It was hypothesized Hydrogen Peroxide would be more effective than water, at a higher concentration than a lower concentration, and for a longer period of time versus a shorter period of time.<br><br>A brief procedure is as follows. The autoclave is filled with 500ml of 3% Hydrogen Peroxide, test tubes containing Serratia marcescens bacteria are placed in the autoclave with lids removed. The autoclave is run for the set test time, after cooling, the cultures are removed, and samples are transferred to Petri dishes. After 24 hours the cultures are evaluated and the results are recorded. <br><br>The results showed that two of the hypotheses were accepted, and one was ruled invalid. After comparing the cultures with Hydrogen Peroxide and those with water, the Hydrogen Peroxide was much more effective. The Tests with water at 15 minutes neutralized all bacteria, but the tests at 5 and 2 minutes still had large amounts of bacteria present. The trials using 3% Hydrogen peroxide sterilized all bacteria in the 15 minute, 5 minute, and 2 minute periods. Due to the effectiveness of 3% Hydrogen Peroxide, higher concentrations were not needed.

CATALYTIC DECOMPOSITION AND OXIDATION OF PROPANOL UTILIZING SIZE-SELECTED PLATINUM NANOPARTICLES
Elaine Zhou
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, FL

Platinum nanoparticles were used as catalysts in decomposition and oxidation reaction of 2-propanol. Breaking down 2-propanol, a volatile organic compound, catalytically would prove more efficiently than current-day combustion. Polymers dissolved in toluene produced inverse micelles that were loaded with platinum metal salt. After dip-coating a silicon wafer into the solution, the nanoparticles’ size was examined by atomic force microscopy. This solution was deposited on two different nanocrystalline supports (ZrO2 and Al2O3) and annealed at 375°C, forming a powder catalyst eliminated of the carbon from the polymer and chlorine from the salt. The catalyst’s composition was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. A packed-bed mass flow reactor measured the catalytic reaction by placing the catalyst in a tube and flowing helium, carrying 2-propanol, through the system. A mass spectrometer monitored the gas composition leaving the reactor at various temperatures. Ultimately, all reactions showed activity below 200°C and reached similar max conversions (~90%). The performance of the catalyst based on temperature was as follows: Pt/ZrO2 (decomposition) < Pt/Al2O3 (oxidation) < Pt/ZrO2 (oxidation). In the decomposition reaction, H2 and acetone were the favored products, until 250°C when the dehydration reaction (yielding water and propene) became more dominant. Interestingly, in the oxidation reactions, there was a mixture of H2, acetone, and CO2, indicating both partial and complete oxidation had occurred. On the decomposition catalyst, an abundance of carbon deposits seemed to inhibit activity and cause a shift in reaction. This did not occur on the oxidation samples, which had lower levels of carbon.

INVESTIGATING INSULATING COMPOUNDS FOR THE OPTIMIZATION OF DYE-SENSITIZED SOLAR CELLS
Alexander Patrick McCarthy
Liberty High School, Hillsboro, OR

A group of pyridine-based compounds were tested for insulating properties in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). DSSCs often use a liquid iodide/triodide (I-/I3-) electrolyte to replenish electron-depleted dye molecules, which incompletely coat a TiO2 substrate. The I-/I3- electrolyte has slow redox kinetics in combining with electrons traveling through the TiO2. Solid electrolytes are desirable because liquid I-/I3- electrolyte can evaporate, and is difficult to seal in. Solid electrolytes studied exhibit fast kinetics in combining with electrons in the substrate before they exit the cell, effectively short circuiting the cell. This study focused on applying pyridine-based compounds to the substrate to prevent this electron transfer. Cells with nanoparticulate, or uniform TiO2, with or without dye, were soaked in 0.1 M solutions of potential insulators. Contact angle tests were performed to test for compound adherence, and the conductivity or efficiency of cells were studied. A liquid ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fe2+/Fe3+) solid electrolyte analog was used because liquid electrolyte procedures are more standardized. The most insulating compound was 2,4-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (2,4-PDC), decreasing current flow at 0.3 V by ~40% in uniform TiO2 cells, and ~50% in nanoparticulate TiO2 cells. Unexpectedly, in cells with dye, 2,4-PDC increased current flow, possibly due to the charge-dependent conductive properties of TiO2.

SYNTHESIS OF SILICA AEROGELS
Meredith Grace Marks
University School of Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI

Aerogel, the lowest density solid known, has numerous applications in insulation, catalysis, and NASA projects. Despite its remarkable properties, aerogel is not widely commercialized because of the complex process it requires. This project focuses on how silica aerogels are formed and addresses problematic aspects in an effort to expand commercialization of aerogels.<br><br> There are three main steps in aerogel production: gel preparation, gel processing, and supercritical drying. First, gels are made using tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), alcohol (ethanol), and catalysts (ammonium fluoride and ammonium hydroxide). The wet gel, called sol, ages for about 24 hours before moving onto processing. Next, the sols are soaked in a series of baths of isopropanol in order to fill the pores of the gel with alcohol and remove any water that remains. In supercritical drying, the tragic result of evaporation (xerogel) is avoided by filling the pores of the gel with carbon dioxide which, when heated to its supercritical phase, is removed without surface tension, leaving only the fragile solid framework, or aerogel.<br><br> Through trial and error evaluations of procedural adjustments, aerogels were made with a density of about 0.06 g/cm3. It was determined that a gradual saturation process of CO2 into alcohol must be used before supercritical drying to avoid cracking. The successful resulting aerogels were without cracks, but hydrophilic and fragile. To optimize the product, methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS) was used to replace varying amounts of TEOS. It was found that as the MTMS/TEOS ratio increased, the aerogels were stronger, denser, smaller, and more opaque.

ASTROBIOLOGY: LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE, YEAR IV
Sandy Ren
Midway High School, Waco, TX

In order to determine the life-proficiency of Titan, mixtures containing formaldehyde, ammonia, acetic acid, and nitrogen were made within a gas cell. These mixtures simulated the atmosphere of Titan and the possible atmospheric chemical reactions happening within that atmosphere. Spectroscopy, collected by an FT-IR, was used to discern the chemical signatures of the compounds. <br><br>The changes in the kinetic spectra were analyzed relative to the respective control spectra. There were decreases in the signals of the components at 3100-2600cm-1, 1637cm-1, and 3333cm-1 wavelength zones of the ammonia paired with its increase at 3580-3500cm-1 in conjunction with the decrease of the OH bands of methanol and consumption of acetic acid. The ammonia of the 3100-2600cm-1 zone had peaks moving to higher wavenumbers. Furthermore, the formaldehyde was completely absent in many of its defining wavelength zones in the mixtures. <br><br>The data supported the conclusion of the formation of carbon monoxide, as apparent at its distinctive 2143cm-1 vibrational peak as well as the likely formation of precursor amino acid aminomethanol. These two promising complexes further increase the possibility that life may be sustained on Titan. It is known that there are certain strains of anerobic bacteria who thrive on carbon monoxide; equally, and if not even more, intriguing is the aminomethanol. This precursor amino acid gives rise to the simplest amino acid: glycine, a promising prospect to life on Titan even though it is not necessarily an essential nutrient since the possible existence of one increases the possible existence of others as well.

The work deals with the preparation of nanoparticles of CoFe2O4 from two different precursors by using ultrasound. Nanoparticles of this oxide are usable in many areas of our lives (modern technologies, medicine, catalysis, etc.) because of their magnetic character. The chemical branch studying the synthesis of materials by ultrasound effects is called sonochemistry.<br><br>I focused on studies of an impact that various water additions in reaction could have on the final product. I also examined the impact of different molar proportion of precursors. From measured data I deduced the most efficient parameters for the sonochemical synthesis of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles.<br><br>Applied precursors were Co(acac)3 and Fe(acac)3. To transfer the energy into the sonochemical reaction, the presence of liquid phase is needed in this reaction system. In this case I prepared the solution of precursors in 50 cm3 of inert solvent (tetraethylene glycol dimethylether).<br><br>The characterization of final products were done by thermal analyses, x-ray difrection (XRD), infrared spectroscopy (IR), specific surface measurement by BET method, scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope (TEM).<br><br>Throught this experiments I made a conclusion, that most efficient parameters are 1-2 cm3 addition of water into the reaction and a molar proportion of precursors 2:1 to 1:1. Addition of 5 cm3 of water is not suitable for the preparation of this oxide, because it leads to the formation of hematite instead the wanted CoFe2O4. It has also a very negative impact on the quantity of product.

LIGHTS, QUANTUM DOTS, ACTION!
Amy Cindy Chyao
Williams High School, Plano, TX

A challenge in photodynamic therapy (PDT) cancer treatment is developing novel methods of singlet oxygen generation using near infrared light. Titanium dioxide is a photocatalyst that generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), but it requires ultraviolet light. Lead sulfide (PbS) quantum dots have a narrow band gap, allowing them to tune the absorbed wavelengths of the nanotubes to the near infrared. To ensure singlet oxygen generation, the photoreactive NO donor S-nitroso-cysteine was also bound to the nanotubes, since reaction of NO with ROS forms singlet oxygen. The nanotubes were prepared using hydrothermal synthesis, and PbS quantum dots were attached using a thiolactic acid linker, which controls both the size of the quantum dots and the light wavelengths absorbed. The absorption spectrum and PbS band gap were measured using UV-Visible Spectroscopy, and PbS attachment was verified using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Next, l-cysteine was attached to the quantum dot doped nanotubes, and NO infusion led to S-nitroso-cysteine formation. The sample was irradiated in a Ray-Sorb flask (filtering wavelengths < 600 nm) using a mercury lamp while bubbling argon to collect NO in a vial of de-ionized water. The collected samples were analyzed using UV-Visible Spectroscopy, and nitrite concentrations were calculated. The results indicate that in near-infrared light, electron transfer from PbS to the nanotubes results in NO release and successful singlet oxygen generation. This project’s original approach of attaching S-nitroso-cysteine to PbS quantum dot decorated titanium dioxide nanotubes shows promise as a next generation PDT photosensitizer.

EXTRACTION OF ZINC THROUGH PHYTOREMEDIATION USING BRASSICA JUNCEA
Haleigh Rae Hitzing
Island Coast High School, Cape Coral, FL

The purpose of this project was to see if the Indian Mustard (Brassica juncea) could remove a statistically significant amount of zinc from soil. If Indian Mustard plants could do so, the soil would be depleted of zinc and the plant parts would accumulate zinc.<br><br> One gallon bag of soil was tested prior to being exposed to hyperaccumulators. Then an identical bag of soil was sent for testing after having 60 pure Brassica juncea plants transplanted into it. These roots were left in the soil for 11 to 38 days. Then those roots were removed and sent for testing along with the plants that were never exposed to zinc. <br><br> Based on soil results only, there was a significant decrease in zinc levels in parts per million-1135 in control and 869 after testing. Also, the zinc level in the Indian Mustard seeds that were grown entirely hydroponically was 346.97 ppm; while Indian Mustard plants that had been transplanted into contaminated soil was 1197.28 ppm.<br><br> The researcher’s hypothesis was supported, Brassica juncea was able to remove a great deal of zinc from the soil through phytoremediation. Further studies could be conducted on a larger scale to prepare to use this plant to clean up zinc contaminated sites.

LICHENS, LIMESTONE, AND TREES: USING X-RAY FLUORESCENCE ANALYSIS TO QUANTIFY ELEMENTS
Kristen Paige Kirkland
Eastern High School, Pekin, IN

The purpose of this project was to identify the differences in the elements found in lichens from limestone, dead trees, and living trees. It was hypothesized that there would be a difference in the amounts of each element found in lichens from limestone, dead trees, and living trees. For this project, a one-inch cork borer was used to collect samples of crustose lichens from dead and living trees. Three samples were collected from five dead maple trees and five living maple trees. The attached bark was also collected. The lichens were separated from the bark so the lichens and the bark could be tested individually. Three lichen samples were collected from five different limestone rocks. Hydrochloric acid was used to verify that the rock was limestone. All samples from the dead trees were combined. This step was repeated with all of the lichen samples from the living trees and limestone. A Niton X-ray Fluorescence Analyzer was used to determine how much of each element was present in the samples in parts per million. Inner-shell electrons were ejected from their orbits because of the energy produced by the device. Electrons from the outer shell took their place. This produced fluorescent x-rays, each characteristic of a specific element. These x-rays were detected by the XRF Analyzer. The samples were tested three times. The results were analyzed and compared. Differences were found in Titanium, Calcium, Potassium, Iron, Strontium, and Manganese.

PREPARATION OF BLACK INK FROM FRUIT ARILS OF POMEGRANATE (PUNICA GRANATUM)
Zain Shami
Headstart School, Islamabad, ICT, PAKISTAN

The waste instead of leaving to cause pollution can be utilized to make useful products. Pomegranate is grown in South Asia- Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan and India, which are poverty stricken areas of the world. The arils of pomegranate that are thrown away contain tannin which is a basic ingredient of ink. The arils of pomegranate were dried in the sun and crushed into powder. Powdered arils were dissolved in warm water and were mixed with ferrous sulphate (FeSO4) solution which produced black ink. In this reaction ferrous sulphate reacts with tannin to form ferrous tannate which is readily oxidized to black ferric tannate by atmospheric oxygen. <br><br>The quality of ink with respect to colour, brightness, durability, water resistance and viscosity of the ink was tested and compared with the commercial ink and found compatible except it was not water resistant.<br><br>For the preparation of ink red-ripped arils of pomegranates are more useful. Most of all waste of pomegranate can be used to prepare environment friendly and quality ink which not only reduces pollution but also provides cheaper source of black ink for millions of students and people in world. Moreover this skill can be used to alleviate poverty.

SYNTHESIS OF COPPER (II) CARBOXYLATES FROM USED COOKING OIL
Nurul Haiza Sapiee
Taiping MARA Junior Science College, Taiping, Perak, MALAYSIA

Palm oil is widely used for cooking in Malaysia. However, the used oil which is thrown away can cause pollution. Copper (II) carboxylate has immense potential to be used as a catalyst in industries that require oxidation process, as molecular electronic and spintronics and perfume. This research showed that used palm oil can synthesize copper (II) carboxylate. Sodium hydroxide was firstly added to used palm oil and underwent saponification process by reflux method to produce carboxylic acid. Then copper (II) chloride was added to the carboxylic acid to produce copper (II) carboxylate. Next, the chemical properties were tested. The peak readings from the Infra-Red Machine were almost similar. This proves that the type of bonds of the copper (II) carboxylate is not affected by the cooking process. Other than that, Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) showed that the samples were thermally stable at 250oC-300oC whereby they started to decompose. Using UV-visible spectroscopy, the peaks between 700-800nm identified the geometry of the sample to be square pyramidral. Based on the percentage obtained, the oil used-more-than-five times produced 92.1% of copper (II) carboxylate whereas unused oil produced only 59.7%. This shows that used oil can synthesize more copper (II) carboxylate than unused oil and carry the same chemical and physical properties. Copper (II) carboxylate that is synthesized from used palm oil will cost less and is environmental friendly.

MILLIMETER-WAVE AND TERAHERTZ RADIATION FOR STANDOFF CHEMICAL SENSING AND THREAT DETECTION, PHASE IV
Michael Aaron Gord
Dayton Christian High School, Miamisburg, OH

The Global War on Terror, homeland security, and many other applications require new techniques for standoff chemical sensing and threat detection. If the interactions (scattering, reflection, absorption) of far-infrared radiation (mm-wave and THz) with physical targets are measured, then potentially hazardous chemicals and other threats, including concealed threats, can be sensed and characterized. Furthermore, this characterization can be achieved remotely with standoff detection and remotely operated vehicles.<br><br> Four major experiments were performed: 1) THz absorption spectroscopy for chemical sensing, 2) mm-wave interferometry for detecting concealed threats, 3) frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FM CW) radar for absolute ranging, 4) standoff chemical sensing with THz radiation and an ROV. Multiple replicates were accomplished, and signals were processed by Fourier transformation to yield the desired results. The independent variables for these experiments included the chemicals sensed, the simulated heartbeat and respiration, the obscurants employed, and the absolute range to the targets. The dependent variables included the THz radiation absorbed at each wavelength and the frequency and strength of the mm-wave mixing signals. All other variables were controlled.<br><br> The data support the hypothesis. The interactions of far-infrared radiation with physical targets can be used for chemical sensing and identification, detection of concealed threats, absolute ranging, and standoff chemical sensing with ROVs.<br><br> Applications of this technology include all kinds of chemical sensing and threat detection, including chembio weapons, IEDs, enemy combatants, atmospheric processes, greenhouse gases, industrial process monitoring, and medical applications.

CHEMICAL ANALYSES OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS IN THE SMOKE OF INCENSE STICKS DETECTED BY GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY - MASS SPECTROMETRY
Filip Kunc
Gymnazium Ivana Kupca, Hlohovec, SLOVAKIA

I have decided to make out this project, because the influance of incense burning on human health has been discussed for a long time, and at our country they are not under any general control. <br><br> The aim of this project is the identification of volatile substances in incense and finding out if these sicks are made only with the use of natural components. As it is very important, that the sticks must be burned up, I have also decided to observe the amount of dangerous polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), which are being created in every process of burning. To prove the presence or determine the amount of mentioned substances requests rather difficult methods. The main used method was gas chormatography with mass spectrometry detection (GC/MS). Except for, that there was a need to find an applicable method of determination of amount of PAH, which are created during burning the sticks. <br><br> With all of the measurements I have found out, that many sticks contain synthetic admixtures, despite the fact that the producers claim the sticks are made of natural substances in a traditional produse. The startling discovery was the detection of 7mg of harmful diethylphthalate per a stick . The amount of PAH, crated from one incense stick is nearly the same as the amount created from burning 3 – 5 ciggarets. <br><br> By these and other discoveries I would like to demonstrate the negative effects of incense sticks, which are often said to have possitive ones. These sticks have many negative atributes and their use can promote the beginning of civilizational disease

OPTIMALIZATION OF THE NEW SYNTHESIS METHOD OF STOBADINE PRECURSORS, RESPECTIVELY ITS ANALOGUES
Marek Buchman
School for Extraordinary Gifted Children, Bratislava, SLOVAKIA

Neurodegenerative diseases and their treatment are a particularly serious medical problem, given that the average age of the population is rising. Drugs with g-carboline structure provide a wide range of pharmaceutically active substances with specific effects on the cardiovascular and nervous system. 2,3,4,5-Tetrahydro-1H-pyrido[4,3b]indole derivatives are key precursors of substances that are clinically used (Carbidine, Dimebone…). These substances, according to the latest studies, eliminate symptoms related to for example Alzheimer’s disease.<br><br>Nowadays, one of the best known synthesis method for preparation of compounds with g-carboline structure is Fischer indole synthesis. This method uses highly toxic, mutagenic and unstable arylhydrazines as substrates, the application of which in industrial scale is related to very big problems with toxicity of working places and with toxic wastes.<br><br>The main objective of this work was to test and optimize reaction conditions for a brand-new synthesis method which might in the future substitute Fischer indole synthesis. This laboratory two-step method based on arynic cyclization of Schiff bases uses less hazardous chemicals as substrates and minimizes side products and wastes. <br><br>Based on the obtained results the advantages of this high-yielding method are purity of product, its superb selectivity and huge economical and ecological savings which in the case of industrial use will favor this new method over the Fischer indole synthesis. This procedure is reproducible and almost independent from the substitution of substrates. <br><br>After finishing all other studies, including pre-industrial experiments, Stobadine derivatives will enrich the therapeutic practice and will also broaden basic knowledge of synthetic pharmaceutical chemistry.

HOW DO GASES AFFECT FALL RATE?
Logan Payne Ressel
Saxony Lutheran High School, Jackson, MO

The purpose of this project was to see how the different gases' atomic masses affect the fall rate of an object falling through them. I built a chamber out of a clear PVC pipe with a timer rigged to automatically time an object falling through the tube with a break-beam circuit on both sides. I put a cotton ball in the chamber and vaccuumed it down to -10 in. hg.. I then filled the chamber with the gas to 10 psi and timed the falls. Helium caused the fastest drops and had the smallest atomic mass. Refrigerant 132a caused the slowest drop due to its high atomic mass. These results confirmed my theory that atomic mass directly affects the fall rate of objects falling through them.

AN INVESTIGATIVE STUDY ON PIGMENTED GALLSTONES: IS CU(II)-INDUCED OXIDATION OF BILIRUBIN RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR FORMATION?
Shamik Mascharak
Santa Cruz High School, Santa Cruz, CA

The goal of this project was to determine whether Cu(2+)-induced oxidative polymerization of Bilirubin (BR) leads to the bluish-black pigment often noted in the pigmented gallstones found in patients with hemolysis. In order to determine the roles of three biologically relevant metal ions namely, Zn(2+), Cu(2+) and Ca(2+), in such chemistry, the coordination features of the BR complexes of these metals were explored via Electronic Absorption Spectroscopy, 1-H NMR (for Zn complex), and EPR Spectroscopy (for Cu complex). By systemically varying the metal:BR ratio, the composition of both Zn(2+) and Cu(2+) BR complexes were determined. It was found that only the Cu(2+) complex of BR (bound through the pyrrole nitrogens) reacts rapidly with Oxygen and ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) to afford a purple-blue pigment via a radical based polymerization reaction. The radical was characterized by EPR spectroscopy. In contrast, the Zn-BR complex (although stable in non-protic media) breaks down in presence of water. The mechanism of the pigment-forming reaction was explored by spectroscopic techniques. Finally, conditions were set up to form granular pigmented stone-like products in the laboratory under physiological conditions (in presence of Ca(2+), bile acids, and cholesterol) via Cu(2+)-induced oxidation of BR. Since the synthetic stones resemble authentic pigmented stones physically (microscopy) as well as chemically (as determined by Atomic Emission Spectroscopy) very closely, my results confirmed that Cu(2+)-induced polymerization of BR is the cause of the formation of pigmented gall stones. The susceptibility of BR towards the formation of harmful pigments/stones in the body under impaired Cu and/or BR homeostasis is important due to its medical implications.

SYNTHESIS AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECT OF CONCENTRATION AND PH ON THE ION-EXCHANGE CAPACITY OF METAL POLYACRYLATES USING COPPER
Nicholas T. Wilson
Dallastown Area High School, Dallatown, PA

Sodium polyacrylate has great potential to be used in the remediation of toxic wastewater containing cobalt, copper, calcium, and iron. Using a teabag as an ion-exchange membrane, sodium polyacrylate was soaked in the four transition metal solutions to synthesize metal polyacrylates in order to demonstrate visually, its absorption capability. Colored metal polyacrylates were synthesized from the ion-exchange. This project was expanded to include a quantitative analysis to analyze the effect of concentration and pH on the ion-exchange capacity of this polymer with copper, using spectrophotometic analysis. <br><br> In order to examine the absorption properties of sodium polyacrylate, six experiments were conducted using different concentrations, ranging from 0.005M to 0.05M, and varied pH values, ranging from 1 to 12, of copper solutions. Data collected established an exponential relationship between concentration of the metal solution and rate of absorption. As the concentration of the metal solutions increased, the resulting change in absorbency decreased and the weight of the polymer increased. An alkaline pH increased the amount of copper absorbed until reaching the pH of 8, where it interfered with the ion-exchange by forming metal hydroxides. The ion-exchange was measured over time to determine the polymer’s efficiency in absorption. Most of the polymer’s absorption took place within the first fifteen minutes. <br><br> Future analysis can assess the potential of sodium polyacrylate to absorb other metal-ions found in wastewater. Optimization of the effectiveness of this polymer and a cost analysis could lead to the development of an efficient and cost-effective product for toxic wastewater remediation.

EXPLORING MPEMBA EFFECT
Daniel Michael Kassen
Mayer Lutheran High School, Mayer, MN

This project explores the Mpemba Effect, which is the phenomenon in which hot water freezes faster than colder water. Even though it has been known for over forty years, scientists have not found a definite cause, but do have several theories. These include: evaporation, dissolved gases, and convection currents within the water. This project takes a closer look at each of these and attempts to find the root cause.<br><br> Qualitative experiments were first done to find the container shape and size that best showed the Mpemba effect, and then these containers were used for all of the following tests. Quantitative tests were done by heating four different temperatures of water and placing the four containers in a walk-in Freezer. Top and bottom temperatures were recorded every five minutes, and tests were concluded when every sample had a layer of ice on the surface. Certain variables were adjusted to test the theories such as boiling water before testing to expel and dissolved gases, covering the containers to eliminate evaporation, and insulating the sides of the container to reduce heat loss through the sides.<br><br> The results showed that the dissolved gases had little to no effect on the Mpemba effect. Evaporation and convection currents on the other hand were found to work together to cause this phenomenon. The rapid cooling caused by evaporation on the surface of the water created convection currents within the water causing the hot water to cool faster than the colder water.

SYNTHESIS OF FERROMAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES WITH POLYMER SURFACTANTS
Caitlyn Anne Hall
Vail High School, Tucson, AZ

Previously, to make the polymer surfactant it took a multistep process to make the initiator to begin the polymerization process. If I could use an initiator that was commercially available rather than having to synthesize a separate initiator, the process time and efficiency would be cut down significantly. If I was able to use a different Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization process that would still produce the Amine functionalized end group that was more efficient, I could synthesize a multi-gram yield.<br><br>I used ATRP beginning with a commercially available initiator to make the first step of the polymerization, Polystyrene-Bromide. Then I did another reaction to change the end group to an Azide. Finally, another reaction was conducted, which produced Polystyrene-Amine. <br><br>I successfully created the Polystyrene-Amine, as shown by the nuclear magnetic resonance results. These tests were done at the end of each reaction, continually showing the sought after end group. Then, I used the Polystyrene-Amine as the surfactant for the Cobalt nanoparticle reaction. The transmission electron microscopy image taken after the cobalt nanoparticle reaction, showed continually chaining nanoparticles. <br><br>The images and data results show all of the reactions had been synthesized successfully, resulting in a multi-gram scale of ferromagnetic cobalt nanoparticles. This different method has proven to be more cost effective and much less laborious, while still producing the desired nanoparticles. With less expensive nanoparticles, MRIs and batteries will be more effective and less costly, which greatly benefits those in the medical field to the government.

EFFORTS TOWARD THE SYNTHESIS OF ENANTIOMERICALLY ENRICHED PYRAZOLE AMINO ACIDS
Matthew Tsao Kiok
Louisiana School for Math, Science, and the Arts, Natchitoches, LA

The total synthesis of an enantiomerically pure product poses several challenges to an organic chemist. To obtain a useable amount of final product, several steps in the synthesis must be painstakingly optimized. In addition, prochiral substrates must be reacted with an appropriate enzyme to yield the desired isomer. Three reactions were optimized leading up to the prochiral substrate. The substrate was then reacted without an enzyme in order to follow the progress of the two isomers in the subsequent reactions leading to the final product: 2-amino-3-(5-methyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)propanoic acid, a potential antimicrobial agent. <br><br>The synthesis began with a cyclocondensation reaction of methyl acetopyruvate with hydrazine to form a pyrazole ring with a methyl ester moiety at carbon 3. The substrate was then reduced with lithium aluminum hydride, yielding a primary alcohol. The alcohol was then halogenated with thionyl chloride in the presence of pyridine and acetonitrile. Then the prochiral chlorine substrate was alkylated in a substitution reaction, using ethyl nitroacetate and sodium hydride in DMSO. The racemic ethyl ester was hydrolyzed by sodium hydroxide, and the nitro group was reduced to an amine by palladium catalyzed hydrogenation under 3.4atm. The structure of the final product and all intermediate substrates were verified by 1H and 13C NMR. Each reaction along the synthesis was attempted multiple times with different reagents and under various conditions. The set of reaction parameters that gave the best yield were reported and less successful sets noted and analyzed in the paper.

STUDIES ON DRUG MICROENCAPSULATION
Tony Huang
F.J. Reitz High School, Evansville, IN

Ibuprofen (IBU) is a hydrophobic, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) widely used to treat mild pain and inflammation. Many NSAIDs have undesirable side-effects such as GI irritation, ulcerogenic effect, and short-half life. One method being explored to counteract these side-effects is sustained-release microencapsulation. Through this technique, the NSAID is encapsulated in a wall of excipient which controls its release. Due to IBU’s low melting point as well as hydrophobic nature, excipients being explored for IBU microencapsulation are mainly wax-based. Cetyl alcohol (CA), an FDA approved food additive, with a melting point: 49 - 50 degrees Celsius, is a suitable excipient for IBU. Thus, the aim of this current study was to form IBU-CA alcohol microcapsules through melt-solidification techniques. IBU was emulsified with CA in a molten aqueous phase and allowed to cool. Various experimental parameters, including agitation speed, cooling rate, and excipient concentration, were systematically adjusted to determine the optimum microcapsule formation conditions. Thermal analysis, via differential scanning calorimetry, was utilized to characterize the encapsulated products as well as the IBU and CA standards. Thermal scans of the encapsulated products indicated the formation of a uniform physical mixture with well defined solidus and liquidus events in the vicinity of pure CA and IBU melting points. Furthermore, observed particle properties such as sphericity and size suggested successful microencapsulation in the majority of the melt techniques. Optimal microencapsulation conditions occurred with a combination of a fast RPM, a fast cooling rate, and a relatively low excipient to drug ratio.

NEW NANOGOLD-BASED DERIVATIVE OF A DRUG AGAINST ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE
Jan Machal
Gymnazium, Brno-Reckovice, Brno, CZECH REPUBLIC

A significant number of efficient medicaments have the origin in nanogold. At the present time, nanogold successfully serves in the treatment of arthritic patients. A potential use of nanogold in the therapy of cancer and Alzheimer’s disease is also widely investigated.<br><br>In this project, the synthesis of nanogold clusters with potent anti-Alzheimer’s drug Huperzine A was designed and realized. Gold nanoparticles serve here as a drug carrier in the same way as for some chemotherapeutic agents. Solutions of chloroauric acid and Huperzine A in water were mixed together. Chloroauric acid was reduced using gallic acid in order to produce clusters of nanogold which eventually interact with Huperzine. Products of reaction were analyzed via MALDI TOF mass spectrometry.<br><br>It was proved that many until now not described adducts between Huperzine A and nanogold can be produced. These adducts varies from smaller ones such as HupA•Au, HupA•Au3 to greater ones as {HupA}2•Au6. Wide range of discovered substances offers a great deal of medical trials possibilities.<br><br>The results of this project suggest better therapeutic effects of discovered nanogold and Huperzine derivatives owing to the synergistic effect can be expected, giving more efficient anti-Alzheimer’s medicine. Such aggregates promise better pharmacokinetic properties, increasing efficacy and lowering the adverse effects of remedy.

A NOVEL CHEMICAL SYNTHESIS FOR >1ΜM^2 GRAPHENE SHEETS
Paul Chandrica Masih Das
Lawrence High School, Cedarhurst, NY

Graphene, a two-dimensional, monolayer of carbon atoms bonded in a hexagonal lattice structure, displays record-breaking mechanical and electrical properties. Synthesizing single-layered, non-wrinkled graphene sheets is difficult, inefficient, and expensive, resulting in wrinkled sheets or monolayers 100-500 nm long at best. Many methods also produce sheets that are highly-functionalized, thereby compromising the substance’s properties. This project developed an innovative, simple, and cost-efficient synthesis procedure, dispersing graphene oxide in an ethanol-water solvent and reducing slowly with sodium borohydride (NaBH4). After testing various solutions, it was found that when graphene oxide was reduced in a 75:25 H2O:ethanol solution with 15 mmolar NaBH4, numerous single-layered graphene sheets >1µm^2, and sometimes even >2µm^2, in size were produced. The quality of these sheets was confirmed by several imaging and experimental techniques that include Raman spectroscopy, FTIR, XRD, AFM, TGA, and TEM. HRTEM displayed hexagonal arrangement of atoms with carbon nanotubes forming in multilayered areas, indicating sample purity. ED confirmed six point lattice. Future work includes floating graphene on a Langmuir-Blodgett trough, compressing to fabricate one large, flat monolayer sheet; taking conductivity measurements of graphene samples; and investigating why graphene precipitates when reduced in 50:50 H2O:ethanol solution but resuspends when more water is added. Work function imaging of sheets will also be done using a Kelvin Probe Force Microscope.

SEPARATION OF CO2 USING SAPO-34 MEMBRANE
Junaid Akbar
Ballard High School, Louisville, KY

Natural Gas is a one of the major energy sources in United States and all over the world, but there have been many problems while extracting it. One of the major problems is that many of the natural gas wells have a high concentration of Carbon Dioxide, which is a significant impurity not only for the wells, but also for the environment. Many natural gas companies have been looking for a way to separate C02 from the natural gas, but its concentration can be up to 70% in the wells. Most of the companies have been using the polymeric membranes to separate Carbon Dioxide from the natural gas. But now there is a new type of membrane, called Silicoaluminophosphate membrane or in short term (SAPO-34 membrane) and is created from Aluminum Isopropoxide, Distilled Water, Phosphoric Acid, Ludox (silica), Tetraethyl Ammonium Hydroxide and Dipropylamine. SAPO-34 membranes have a pore diameter of 0.38nm and they are Zeolite membranes, meaning they have much more chemical, thermal and mechanical stability then polymeric membranes. When the membrane was created it was used in a gas separation system in which a mixture of carbon dioxide and methane was passed through the membrane to see if the membrane would separate the CO2 from the mixture of gasses. The results were measure by a gas chromatographer and they proved to be successful because the membrane separated most of the carbon dioxide from the gas mixture.

INVESTIGATING THE GROWTH AND NUCLEATION PROCESS OF C60 FULLERENE NANOWHISKERS VIA FORMATION STRUCTURES
Nicholas Mark Worth Sharp
Dominion High School, Sterling, VA

Fullerene nanowhiskers are composed of fullerene molecules bonded by Van der Waals forces into a wire-like crystalline structure, having diameters on the nanometer or micrometer scale and lengths from a few micrometers to several millimeters. Fullerene nanowhiskers are most effectively formed by the liquid-liquid interfacial precipitation method (LLIP).<br><br> In this research the growth of fullerene nanowhiskers via the LLIP method was investigated. First, the growth of nanowhiskers in an ambient temperature with a C[60] fullerene-saturated toluene-isopropyl alcohol interface was measured. Though far more erratic than expected, growth during the initial stages of development was best modeled by the equation L = 5.7171ln(t) + 6.8268 with an R^2 value of 0.8987, where L is length in micrometers and t time is in hours. The growth became increasingly irregular after 24 hours had passed.<br><br> Several previously undocumented structures observed in nanowhisker growth were investigated. Small quantities of “macrowhiskers” would occasionally form; these crystals were dramatically larger than others in the sample. Clearly defined “stars” were observed, in which many similar nanowhiskers radiated from a single point. Also, exceedingly dense “mats” of nanowhiskers were observed.<br><br> It is postulated that fullerene nanowhiskers only nucleate at a liquid-liquid interface for the first several hours after its establishment. After this time, the growth mainly occurs at nucleation sites on the other fullerene deposits present: nanowhiskers and bulk fullerene precipitates. This method explains the formation of “macrowhisker”, “star”, and “mat” structures, along with the observed increasing irregularity of nanowhisker growth as time passed.

INVESTIGATION OF NANO-STRUCTURED SUPER-HYDROPHOBIC COATING ON STRUCTURAL SUBSTRATES
Nivetita Ravi
Clarksburg High School, Clarksburg, MD

The main objective of my project was to determine whether the contact angle of a water droplet on a substrate coated with superhydrophobic coatings would vary with the substrate used. I wanted to see the effect of the ratio of the binder (polystyrene) to the fumed silica on the durability of the coating. I created a superhydrophobic mixture containing fumed silica (hydrophobic powder), trichloroethylene (solvent), and polystyrene (binder) and applied it onto different surfaces: ceramic tile, wood, glass, Tyvek tape, and aluminum foil. I also created 4 more mixtures, each with a different binder-to-fumed silica ratio. I tested the surface by dropping a drop of water on each surface. Using a camera and digital protractor, I measured the angle between the water droplet and the substrate. I decided to also test the durability of each substrate with the coating, so I placed 10 drops of water on each substrate in each ratio and counted how many of them were superhydrophobic. This gave me a percentage of the area of the surface that remained superhydrophobic after a period of time. I found that the contact angles of all the substrates were superhydrophobic and did not vary much. Also, the ratio R3 (ratio of 2.5) produced the most durable coating. For my combination of binder, fumed silica and solvent, wood was the most durable substrate.

SPECIFIC CELLULAR UPTAKE OF TARGETED LIPOSOMES IN CANCER CELLS
Daniel Hyungseok Pak
Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, Aurora, IL

Folic acid receptor (FAR) is generally overexpressed in cancer cells. For this reason, folic acid (FA) has been widely used as a targeting ligand in cancer. In this study, stabilized liposomes with folic acid (FA-liposomes) were prepared for specific cancer targeting and liposomes without FA were used as a control. The physical properties of liposomes were characterized by the measurement of size and zeta potential (surface charge) of liposomes. To control the FAR expression by KB cells, cells were incubated in FA-deficient (FAR+ KB cells) and FA-containing (FAR- KB cells) medium, respectively. The fluorescence-labeled liposomes with and without FA were used to visualize the cellular uptake of liposomes into the two different cancer cells (FAR+ and FAR-) by fluorescence microscopy. The results showed that FA-attached liposomes directly enhanced the specific cellular uptake by FAR+ KB cells compared to FAR- KB cells. In conclusion, this system can be effective in enhancing the specific cellular uptake of anticancer therapeutics encapsulated in FA-liposomes.

DEVELOPMENT OF A LOW-COST ELECTROCHEMISTRY SYSTEM AND A NOVEL APPROACH TO DETERMINE FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF OXYGEN, PHASE II
Sunil Kochikar Pai
The Kinkaid School, Houston, TX

This project demonstrates that simple, inexpensive electrochemical methods coupled with nanotechnology can be used to investigate fundamental properties of dioxygen and other molecules.<br><br> A low cost electrochemical system was developed which includes a data acquisition unit, an enhanced potentiostat circuit, and LabView-based user-friendly control software. The setup is versatile and capable of performing cyclic, pulse, square wave, and stripping voltammetry. Using potassium ferricyanide and other molecules, this $200 system was compared to a commercial instrument which cost from $4000.<br><br> A novel application of this device and the electrochemistry field was to conduct cyclic voltammetry of oxygen in 0.1M TBAP/DMSO over a temperature range of 298K to 409K to determine fundamental properties of oxygen. The three-electrode electrochemical cell used featured a multi-walled carbon nanotube modified glassy carbon working electrode for enhanced electron transferability.<br><br> Using an operational form of the Nernst equation and relating results to the first law of thermodynamics, it was found that 6 of the 27 bonding electron affinities of oxygen (corresponding to quantum mechanical spin states) and rotational fine structure (quantum spacings of ~0.020 eV) could be resolved. Theoretical quantum calculations (of potential curves and electron affinities using HyperChem software) were compared with the experimental results.<br><br> This system can be afforded by a wide range of educational and scientific institutions.

OPTIMIZATION OF ADSORPTION OF FLUOROURACIL ONTO CHEMICALLY SYNTHESIZED NANOZEOLITE Y
Nikhil Arjun Dhuna
Burlington Community High School, Burlington, IA

Nanocrystalline and commercial zeolite Y, aluminosilicate, porous materials with faujasite structure, have been employed as drug hosting matrices for 5-fluorouracil adsorption for potential future controlled drug delivery. Synthetic methods for decreasing the particle size from the commercially available micron dimension to nanoscale have been used to increase the external and internal surface area ratio and decrease diffusion path lengths. Additional methods to recycle synthesis solution multiple times have also been utilized to vastly increase product yield approximately ten fold. Alteration of drug loading medium, extra-framework compensating cations, and aluminum to silicon ratio in the structural framework has been performed in conjunction with extensive characterization with UV Spectroscopy to verify amount of loaded drug. Results have shown the greatest loading in zeolites with higher silicon to aluminum ratios due to probable greater hydrophobicity. Trends also reveal elevated loading in alkaline solutions, although predictions based on surface chemistry contradict this. Further studies on the influence of the silicon to aluminum ratio, loading medium, external functional groups, and extra-framework charge compensating cations upon the loading of drug will be carried out to further optimize loading. The release of drug will eventually be conducted in an aqueous solution with body simulating conditions synthesized through the addition of inorganic ions seen in human extracellular fluid as well as a pH of 7.4. Future studies will most likely involve active targeting methods through the addition of homing moieties to the external surface of zeolite particles for direct delivery of agents to precise sites in the body and eventually, in vivo experimentation.

SYNTHESIS OF ZIRCONIUM AND HAFNIUM PHTHALOCYANINES FOR GRATZEL-TYPE SOLAR CELL
Kemakorn Ithisuphalap
Manhattan International High School, New York, NY

Hafnium and zirconium phthalocyanines acetates PcZr(OAc)2 and PcHf(OAc)2 are reported as new dyes for solar cells. Since the fossil fuel supplies will be used up in the near future and silicon solar cells are too expensive to be used, the dye- sensitized solar cell seems to be an alternative way to get energy. Dye-sensitized solar cells use cheap materials and easy fabrication, and they have potential to generate higher efficiency. The final goal of this project is to coat a titanium dioxide semiconductor used in Grätzel cell with our dyes. Building the phthalocyanine rings around the metal ions using hafnium and zirconium tetrachlorides yield the products metallophthalocyanine chlorides (PcZrCl2 and PcHfCl2 ) and have low solubility. The solubility of PcZrCl2 and PcHfCl2 have been increased by converting them using column and mixture of acetic acid, methanol and dichloromethane to PcZr(OAc)2 and PcHf(OAc)2 . These dyes, PcZr(OAc)2 and PcHf(OAc)2, are then used to coat titanium dioxide by attaching them directly through metal and oxide. Furthermore, in order to understand the behavior of PcZr(OAc)2 and PcHf(OAc)2 on the oxide surface in Grätzel-type solar cells, these compounds were bound with H3PW11O39[tba]4, polioxometalate (POM), making zirconium phthalocyanine polioxometalate and hafnium phthalocyanine polioxometalate compounds. UV-vis absorbance data of the solution of phthalocyanine and NMR data confirmed that the right compounds were synthesized. Also, UV-vis reflectance spectra show that the dyes are attached to the titanium dioxide surface.

INVESTIGATING AND CHARACTERIZING FLOW RATES IN CAPILLARY TUBES
Ujwal Chadha
Del Norte High School, Albuquerque, NM

Capillary rise is the spontaneous rise of fluids. The position of the meniscus during capillary rise as a function of time can be calculated using the Lucas-Washburn Equation. However, past research has only been conducted on a limited number of liquids and tube radii, but also has shown that the Lucas-Washburn Equation does not model capillary action highly accurately. Thus, this research tested a wide range of liquids with various viscosities and tube radii and compared experimental data to modified Lucas-Washburn Equations. <br><br>Research was conducted by inserting one millimeter incremented tubes of various radii (0.279,0.395,and 0.6 mm) into fluids of various viscosities (water, isopropyl alcohol, acetic acid and sulfuric acid).Video recordings of capillary rise were taken and analyzed to obtain flow data and Reynold’s numbers. The flow data was compared to derived values from the Lucas-Washburn Equation its modified versions.<br><br>Data confirmed that rise over time is a square root function like the Lucas-Washburn Equation and that a polynomial relationship exists between viscosity and fluid velocity. Calculations showed the Lucas-Washburn Equation with constant contact angle most closely correlated with the data but also suggest the current equation is not a very accurate model for capillary rise of various fluids. Continued modifications to the current equation and the use of Navier-Stokes Equations might allow us to create a better model. The research has applications in medical and may aid the development of a portable capillary blood viscometer capable of calculating blood viscosity faster and more efficiently than current lab tests. <br><br>

HYBRID MATERIALS BASED ON SILICON DIOXIDE AND RHODAMINE 6G, SYNTHESIS AND PROPERTIES
Yaroslav S. Fadeev
School 11 of Vichuga, Vichuga, Ivanovskaya obl., RUSSIA

Hybrid materials based on nanoporous silicon oxide are of great interest today due to chemical inertness, thermal stability and mechanical durability of the silicon oxide matrix. Such characteristics combined with desirable properties of incorporated compound allow us to obtain unique hybrid materials. Rhodamine 6G was chosen as a compound for immobilization into the matrix of silicon oxide. The choice was justified by its high chromophoric and fluorescent activity. That makes rhodamine 6G desirable laser dyes, fluorescent labels and sensors in laser technology, analytical chemistry and medicine. Our idea was to use sol-gel technology for silicon oxide obtaining and to incorporate the dye during the synthesis of silica matrix. It allows us to lessen the matrix particle sizes and better distribute and fixate rhodamine 6G in the pores of hybrid material compared to commercially available silica. Tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) was a parent compound for the synthesis. After TEOS hydrolysis and further polycondensation catalyzed by triethylamine silica were obtained. The product is a pink colored powder with spherical particles. Methods of atomic force microscopy, turbidimetry and laser diffraction were used for the particle sizes determination. Sizes of smallest particles are in the nanometer range. The strength of the dye immobilization was compared to the commercially available silica. The dye incorporation during the hydrolysis appeared to cause better rhodamine 6G fixation in silica matrix. Our results can be used in new solid-state laser dyes creating.

DEVELOPMENT OF A USER AND ECO-FRIENDLY PROCEDURE FOR THE OXIDATIVE CLEAVAGE OF ALKENES
Prem P. Thottumkara
Macomb High School, Macomb, IL

Oxidative transformations of functional groups are of paramount importance in synthetic organic chemistry. Oxidation of alkenes, namely oxidative cleavages and dihydroxylations are synthetically important reactions as they are used for the scission of large molecules into smaller components or for the addition of oxygen functionality across the double bond to increase the functional complexity of the molecule. Several procedures are available for the oxidative cleavage of alkenes; ozonolysis being the most prominent one in spite of the inconvenience and the safety concerns related to the procedure. Herein, we report the use of an in-situ generated aryl iodonium ion, generated from the oxidation of 4-iodobenzoic acid (4-IBAcid) using benign and eco-friendly Oxone as the active oxidant for the oxidative functionalization and cleavage of alkenes. 1-Phenyl-1-cyclohexene was initially chosen as a prototypical substrate to determine the optimum molar ratios of the aryl iodonium ion and Oxone required to affect quantitative oxidative cleavage of this alkene. The optimization studies also revealed that vicinal diols formed during the oxidation of the alkene could also be used as substrates in the reaction. Additionally, it was further determined that the reaction could be carried out using catalytic amounts of 4IBAcid, provided the required amount of oxone is present in the reaction medium. Carefully undertaken optimization studies also showed that cis-diols are preferentially cleaved over their trans-isomers. A large array of structurally diverse alkenes have been oxidatively cleaved/functionalized using the developed procedure. Two plausible mechanisms for this oxidative transformation have been proposed and will be discussed.

EXTRACTION OF CAFFEINE
Luke Avetian-McMenamin
Buena High School, Sierra Vista, AZ

Caffeine is a common molecule frequently consumed in every day beverages. Currently, the FDA does not regulate or require labeling of caffeine content, although many companies will voluntarily state the caffeine content on nutritional labels. My experiment investigates the amount of caffeine in energy drink, coffee, soda , and tea. <br><br> I followed the procedure from Theory and Practice in the Organic Laboratory. Modifications needed to be added when testing the other beverages, since the procedure is designed for tea. This mainly consisted of removing the first stage of tannic Acids. The procedure worked well for all of the sample beverages from which I extracted caffeine. <br><br> The experiment gave consistent results. On average energy drink, coffee, soda and Tea contained 56.7 milligram, 35.4 milligrams, 8.0 milligrams, and 5.9 milligrams respectively. Then doing a purity test on the sample of caffeine, I found that the melting point of my sample was 130 Degrees Celsius, while the actual is 137 degrees Celsius, giving my experiment less than 10% error.<br><br> My hypothesis was proven partially correct. My hypothesis was supported by energy drinks having the largest caffeine content, being larger than Coffee and Tea, and soda having larger caffeine content than Tea. My hypothesis was not supported by soda having larger caffeine content than coffee.

MEDICINAL APPLICATIONS OF BIS(TRIMETHYLSILYL) ACETYLENE IN COPPER(I)-CATALYZED AZIDE-ALKYNE "CLICK" CHEMISTRY
Daniel Alexander Mokhtari
Breck School, Minneapolis, MN

The purpose of my study was to apply copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne “click” chemistry to constituents of common anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, anti-viral, and anti-cancer drugs. I used azide-alkyne cycloaddition click reaction procedures developed by Brisbois et al. (2006-09) in synthesis of 1,2,3-triazole-containing medicinally-relevant compounds, employing 1,8-diazabicyclo-[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU)-mediated desilylation of bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene in situ. Analysis using proton NMR and GCMS showed that cycloaddition of benzyl-fused acetal, benzhydral, and indolyl azides worked well with DBU, while cycloaddition of ester, acetal, and phthalimide azides did not. I adapted an alternative set of conditions that used silver salt-based desilylation, successfully applying the cycloaddition reaction to esters and phthalimides. These results provide a foundation for use of bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene in copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne click chemistry. While it is clear from the reactions tested that in situ desilylation via DBU is not an all-encompassing technique, other in situ desilylation methods may be adopted to azide-alkyne cycloaddition; as a result, the versatility of bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene in click reactions is highlighted. In addition, low catalytic loading as well as the water-based solvent used underscore the “green” nature of this reaction and its potential use in synthesis of anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, anti-viral, and anti-cancer drugs.

MIMICKING THE LOTUS LEAF: EMPLOYING NATURAL PROCESSES OF MICRO- AND NANO-TEXTURING TO CONVERT A HYDROPHILIC SURFACE INTO HYDROPHOBIC BASED ON CASSIE-BAXTER WETTING
Saumil Bandyopadhyay
Maggie L. Walker Governor's School for Government and International Studies, Richmond, VA

Hydrophobic metal surfaces have numerous applications in building construction, ultra-stealthy submarines, eyewear, windshields, decontamination, etc., but it is very difficult to hydrophobize a metal since it naturally tends to be hydrophilic. The lotus leaf, Nature’s example of a hydrophobic surface, inspired a solution. The leaf’s surface is covered with wax-coated micropapillae that suspend a water droplet like a pincushion, thereby rendering the leaf hydrophobic. This behavior is explained by the Cassie-Baxter model. Accordingly, aluminum foils were corroded in an acid to create micrometer-sized corrosion pits whose ridges mimic micropapillae. The surface was then coated with 100 nm of polydimethylsiloxane to mimic the wax-like film. Contact angle measurements of a water droplet on the surface showed it to be hydrophobic, even though aluminum is naturally hydrophilic. A second set of aluminum foils was anodized in oxalic acid to produce a nanoporous alumina film on the surface. The native film is very hydrophilic because of the pores’ capillary action, but if a water-repelling polymer of few nanometers thickness is electrosprayed on it, it turns super-hydrophobic since the pores expel water and trap air. The vestigial capillary action however holds a water drop in place, even if the foil is turned upside down. This is the first time that (a) corrosion has been used to induce hydrophobicity, and (b) nanopores have been used to induce the “gecko state”, whereby a water drop hangs upside down. Both corrosion and anodization are inexpensive, scalable, have rapid throughput and are fully compatible with non-planar surfaces.

MALLEABLE POLYMER-IMPRINTED POROUS SILICON PHOTONIC CRYSTAL COMPOSITES
Xiaoyu Cao
Torrey Pines High School, San Diego, CA

Porous silicon as a sensor is useful in many applications throughout the real world, from detecting toxins in the environment to monitoring levels of chemicals in the living systems. But while porous silicon possesses assets such as efficiency and utility as material that relies only on its optical properties in sensing, it lacks certain practical qualities such as biocompatibility and flexibility—qualities offered by polymers.<br><br>The purpose of my project is to create composite materials comprised of porous silicon nanofilms infiltrated by various polymers; two of which used in this experiment included ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). In etching the porous silicon chip, an electrochemical reaction involving a HF-ethanol solution under an electric current, numerous current settings were attempted to allow optimum polymer infiltration. Conditions of polymer application, such as exposure to high temperature, length of time in and out of heat, as well as procedure and method, were adjusted over a course of trial-and-error. <br><br>After successfully synthesizing the composites, they were placed under a spectrometer in air and ethanol, and various computer programs were used to analyze the spectral shifts to determine the material’s sensing value. <br><br>A reliable method of polymer infiltration and formation of the composite was developed. It was found that a lift-off etch was necessary in order for polymer-film removal. The discovery that the sensing ability of the flexible and chemically stable composite materials remains relatively secure paves the way for further study and optimization of these novel hybrid sensors. This previously-unexplored material holds considerable potential in practical applications as a chemical detector.

THE EFFECT OF CURCUMIN ON THE OXIDATION OF N-ACETYL-TYROSINE IN AN IN VITRO CU(II)/H2O2 MODEL OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
Chelsea Lynn Massaro
Christian Home & Bible School, Mount Dora, FL

The purpose for this experiment was to determine if curcumin will reduce the amount of oxidation that occurs to N-acetyl-tyrosine in an in vitro Cu(II)/H2O2 model of Alzheimer’s disease. Previous work has shown that curcumin strongly chelates certain transition metal ions thought to contribute to oxidative damage in the Alzheimer’s brain. I hypothesized that if curcumin is added to an aqueous solution containing N-acetyl-tyrosine/Cu(II)/H2O2, then curcumin will reduce the amount of oxidative damage that occurs to N-acetyl-tyrosine.<br><br> First, mix stock solutions. Secondly, mix N-acetyl-tyrosine/Cu(II)/H2O2 in vitro model. Next run baseline for UV Visible Spectrometer and Fluorescence Spectrometer. Run both for each sample and series at designated time intervals. Lastly, properly dispose of all materials.<br><br> The average fluorescence of the N-acetyl-tyrosine/Cu(II)/H2O2 in vitro model solution after 120 minutes was 127.263 with no curcumin present, 29.6 with .1 mL of curcumin of curcumin stock solution, 11.58 with .25 mL of curcumin stock solution, and 13.668 with .5 mL of curcumin stock solution. Fluorescence measurements reveal that curcumin nearly halts oxidation of N-acetyl-tyrosine in this model. The average percent reduction of N-acetyl-tyrosine oxidation was 79.6621 with .1 mL of curcumin present, 95.999 with .25 mL of curcumin present, and 94.9939 with .5 mL of curcumin present.<br><br> The results supported my hypothesis by showing that curcumin can reduce the amount of oxidative damage that occurs in N-acetyl-tyrosine. This demonstrates that curcumin, a polyphenolic beta-dicarbonyl found in the spice tumeric, may offer medicinal advantages in slowing the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.

THE DESIGN OF A COOLING SYSTEM FOR CULTURE MEDIA
Grace Calva-Valencia
Centro de Bachillerato Tecnologico Industrial y de Servicios #211, Panotla, TLAXCALA, MEXICO

In the microbiological analysis the right application of the quality control over the humidity level, the adequate oxygen pressure, pH, the nutrimental content and the most suitable temperature in the preparation of culture mediums assures either the optimum growth or the inhibition of the bacteria under study. There are several problems arising when preparing growth mediums such as the production of bubbles or an irregular temperature distribution giving place to the formation of globs and causing the unnecessary lost of material. In order to avoid these issues It was designed a 1000 ml laboratory flask (20 cm height and a 12 cm diameter flat bottom ), double layer with 6 mm of internal space; the water goes in and out through two side openings located in the neck and the bottom respectively, they must be connected to a flowing water device. It is made of Pyrex glass able to resist thermal shocks and temperatures up to 450°C. The flask should be sterilized before being used, the substances inside are softly and continuously agitated by a small magnet using a magnetic stirrer; at the same time they are cooled thanks to the flow of water inside the space between the double layer structure. The following features have been achieved: good temperature control, the elimination of globs and bubbles, the cooling time is even five times shorter than when using conventional procedures leading to precise and reliable results.

The experimental results of adsorption of CO2 at different temperatures (463-583 K) zeolite clinoptilolite (natural) and chemically modified, were evaluated in order to compare the effects of these treatments in the original structure of the zeolite and the rs method for estimating the micropores and was evaluated by the equation Gursvitch was used rule total pore volume VThe incessant growth of the population, industries and the transport demand consumption causing considerable amounts of fuel, high levels of air pollution. Currently, air pollution is one of the major environmental challenges facing. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a colorless, dense and unreactive forms part of the composition of tropospheric currently at a rate of 350 ppm. It`s cycle in nature is linked to oxygen. It is estimated that the increased levels of CO2 cause significant climate changes like those we are currently experiencing. An effective containment of such compounds in the pores of microporous or mesoporous adsorbents represents a suitable option to reduce the presence of this gas in the environment. The adsorption processes are a valuable option to remove certain types of fluid contaminants. The clinoptilolite was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared spectroscopy (IR), atomic absorption (AA) and its textural properties were determined by nitrogen adsorption at 77 K. Specific surface was calculated by the BET and Langmuir methods. The esulting changes in the properties adsorption of the zeolites. The experimental data are treated by the equations of Freundlich and Langmuir. In a complementary way were evaluated standard adsorption energies and the degree of interaction of this gas with the zeolite under study was analyzed through the evolution of the isosteric heat of adsorption using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation.

MALATHION: CHEMOSELECTIVE HYDROLYSIS VIA ENZYMATIC MEANS
Katherine Zeita Michels
Big Sky High School, Missoula, MT

Malathion, inexpensive and readily available, is one of the most widely used organophosphorus pesticides. As a result, stockpiles exist in commercial and agricultural sites throughout the world. Malathion has been shown to be detrimental to the health of both humans and ecosystems. This project aims to develop a simple, efficient method which can break down these stockpiles of malathion into usable chemical products. Preliminary results have identified an enzyme which hydrolyzes an ethyl moiety off of the malathion molecule, resulting in the breakdown of malathion into its corresponding alpha and beta monoacids. These results have been achieved using pure malathion; further investigation will be required to verify the effectiveness of this method on commercially available malathion, which contains impurities which may inhibit the action of the enzyme.

CAN YOU WIPE AWAY THE EVIDENCE?
Jordan Lynn Eichelser
Taconic High School, Pittsfield, MA

Detection of human blood at a possible crime scene by Luminol has been popularized by a variety of criminal investigation television shows. Often blood is still detected after an attempt has been made to clean the crime scene. This lead to the question, which cleaning products are most effective at removing blood from any surface at a crime scene? The initial hypothesis was that stain removal products, such as Shout, would be the most effective. Various cleaning agents and surfaces were studied experimentally.<br><br> In order to determine which cleaning products were most effective, an analysis of those that cause false positives was performed. The cleansers that contain non-bonding electrons, such as bleach or some organic based cleansers interacted with the Luminol molecule causing fluorescence. <br><br> Common surfaces, (finished wood, tile, vinyl flooring, fibers, and carpets) were exposed to a uniform amount of blood and then cleaned to see which cleaning agent would remove all visible traces of blood to pass a visual inspection and the Luminol exam. The data indicated that to pass the visual and chemical inspection, surface type had a more critical role than the actual cleaning agent. <br><br> The factory-finished surfaces are not stain-proof. Therefore, the surfaces may contain sections of lightly or heavily chemically treated material that can vary the ability to pass a visual and Luminol examination after cleaning.<br><br> In the future, the scouring technique should be varied and surfaces in varying stages of degradation and wear in addition to factory-finished surfaces should be tested.

COMPUTATIONAL OPTIMIZATION OF CARBON DIOXIDE CAPTURE: EXPLORING CONFORMATIONS OF AN ARYL AMIDOUREA CAVITAND FOR MORE EFFICIENT TRAPPING OF CO2
Rosalie Shinwei Doerksen
Oxford High School, Oxford, MS

Global warming has become a highly debated issue over the last decade. Many attempts have been made to determine an efficient method of capturing carbon dioxide molecules, which are believed to contribute to the greenhouse effect thus promoting the global warming process. <br><br>In this project an amidourea macrocycle, discovered by Brooks et. al and found to trap carbonate from the air as carbon dioxide, was minimized and multiple conformations were determined using various computational methods. The conformational searches were run in the Schrödinger Maestro software using force field methods. Once the lowest energy conformation was determined, it was further minimized in the Gaussian03 software using B3LYP methods, making use of the Mississippi Center for Supercomputer Research.<br><br>Of the eight conformations found, the lowest energy conformation had two carbonyls pointing in to the center of the macrocycle that were not coplanar and the macrocycle was elongated along the line between the pyridine and the urea compared with the original structure. The energy gap between the originally drawn and minimized conformation and the lowest energy one found after the calculations in Maestro with MacroModel was 72.35 kJ/mol, which is a significant difference.<br><br>The calculations showed that there were many more possibilities for lower energy conformations than the one discovered by Brooks et. al and used by Tossell in his work. Thus, this work has shown that it is important to explore all relevant low energy conformations of flexible molecules such as this amidourea macrocycle.

SAPONIFICATION WITHIN THE HOME
Peyton Elizabeth Brown
Harry P. Harding University High School, Charlotte, NC

In today’s tight economic struggles, many families are looking for methods to defray their cost for the household commodities that they often use such as health and beauty products. In their pursuit, many may turn to experimental attempts of saponification which can be deemed as dangerous due to the testing conditions and household materials used. The focus of the scientific experiment is to use cost-effective household products to create soap while maintaining safe conditions for reproduction. The final soap product was developed using a protocol similar to existing saponification methods, but also utilized less hazardous chemicals at a lower concentration. By reading the backs of labels from cleaning products I realized that majority of the substances like lye and ammonia came in simple glass and drain cleaners. Some unique aspects of the soap’s creation include use of a household ventilation system as well as de-icing salt (calcium chloride) for soap congelation. The de-icing salt is known to be water dehydrant and it absorbed the liquid and became a solid substance. However, documented observations have concluded that this method may yield unsafe results to the producer. Nonetheless, large quantities with low cost household products left lower amounts of residue compared to brand products.

This project in its present form is the result of experimentation with nucleophiles and electrophiles as well as enantiomeric molecules. The initial idea behind Silyl Glyoxylate was to create a compound that had the properties of a negatively charged molecule, and a positively charged molecule. The success with this compound led to the formation of new molecules, which could have the potential to lead to the formation of new pharmaceuticals that would reduce the frequent use of pharmaceuticals. It has also been noticed that enantiomers, whose variations in biological activity, could also pose to be useful when bonded with Silyl Glyoxylate, after they have been separated.<br><br>Extended testing with Silyl Glyoxylate was required in order inquire if the catalyst was really needed for the synthesis of the conjunctive reagent. Separation of the enantiomeric molecule that was used in study was done through a classical resolution, treated with a chiral catalyst. <br><br>Use of NMR spectrums and thin layer chromatography lessened the appearance of byproduct formation, and undesired products within the synthesis of Silyl Glyoxylate, and classical resolution aided in the separation of the enantiomers for selective crystallization.<br><br>The findings in this research project as of now are inconclusive. Additional testing is required to study the biological activity of the enantiomeric molecules, and if they would be useful in the production of new innovative pharmaceuticals.

INVESTIGATING PHOTO-INDUCED PROTON TRANSFER IN ASSOCIATED SOLUTIONS
Kaj Andrew Hansen
Carrollton High School, Carrollton, GA

Proton transfer reactions are the most common reactions in chemistry. However, water’s peculiarities have kept them from being fully understood. In this study, we investigate how viscosity affects the activation energy of proton transfer in associated solutions. The proton-transfer reactions were carried out in supercooled aqueous solutions, which were initiated by the photoexcitation of 2-nitrobenzaldehyde and concluded by the protonation of methyl red. Methyl red and 2-nitrobenzaldehyde were added to aqueous ethylene glycol and aqueous glycerol solutions. The samples were placed in an EPR tube, and submerged into liquid nitrogen contained in a finger dewar. The glass formed at 77 K was excited with 355 nm light generated from the third harmonic of a Nd:YAG laser. Photoexcitation of the 2-nitrobenzaldehyde resulted in an immediate irreversible release of protons within the glass. The color associated with protonated methyl red appeared after the sample was removed from the liquid nitrogen and warmed at room temperature. Upon the first appearance of pink, the temperature of the solution and elapsed time were recorded. It was found that both quantities increased with the mole fraction of the polyalcohol. Unlike ice and water, where protons are highly mobile, the mobility of protons through polyalcohol-water glasses is inhibited and greatly reduced in the corresponding supercooled solutions. The data suggests that there is an activation barrier for solvent reorganization, which increases with viscosity and must be overcome to facilitate proton transfer. From this data, a model has been formulated to explain proton mobility through aqueous polyalcohol solutions.

EXTRACTION OF NATURAL CARBONACEOUS NANOMATERIALS FROM SOIL SOURCES: EXPLORATION OF PROPERTIES AND APPLICATIONS
Aritra Chowdhury
South Point High School, kolkata, West Bengal, INDIA

I have extracted carbonaceous nanomaterials from soil sources following simple cost-effective extraction techniques and have found potential biological applications of such nanomaterials in areas like cellular imaging and as enzyme immobilisation matrix. Soil humus and rock ‘shilajit’, both formed by microbial decomposition of dead organisms, can be rich sources for nanomaterials particularly carbon nanoforms. Such naturally formed nanostructures may be possibly more stable and safe for biological applications.<br><br> <br><br>I adopted a simple repetitive solution and extraction procedure for extraction of carbon nanomaterials from ‘shilajit’ and humus. The shape and size of nanomaterials were evaluated through DLS and AFM, SEM and TEM imaging; Nearly spherical particles, of ~45nm size (humus, from TEM) and ~65nm size (shilajit, from AFM) were obtained. Chemical<br><br>characterization through EDAX, wide angle powder XRD and selected area electron diffraction confirmed the product to have an amorphous carbon-based structure.<br><br> <br><br>The nanoparticles emitted violet fluorescence upon UV excitation. Shilajit-derived nanoparticles were easily taken up in HEK293 and U937 cells in culture without surface functionalization. Cytosolic localization and photostability were studied using confocal microscopy. I also used ‘Shilajit’-nanocarbons, as an enzyme immobilization matrix. Bromelain was successfully immobilized retaining ~30% of its original activity in immobilized form, with only 3% activity lost after 1 month exposure to ambient temperature (compared to 14% loss for free enzyme). <br><br> <br><br>My work proves soil materials to be a potent source of inexpensive, easily extractable nanocarbon forms with potential applications as inexpensive cellular imaging devices and as enzyme immobilization matrix.

SPECIES SELECTIVE ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORS AS INSECTICIDES
Samantha Sapumalee Nanayakkara
Mississippi School for Mathematics and Science, Columbus, MS

Pests have been introduced to the United States by accidents. One such pest is Formosan subterranean termite that was introduced as a result of disembarkation of wooden military cargo at the ports of the United States that arrived from Asia after World War II. Since its first invasion of North America this pest has flourished rapidly in the warm, humid climate regions of the United States during the past fifty years. It has spread over Texas, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina and California. Devastation caused by C. formosanus in North America has been estimated to be one billion dollars a year. Some insecticides against termites have been banned due to human health concerns. <br><br>Aedes aegypti (L.) mosquito is considered a medically important pest that is the primary vector for transmission of dengue and yellow fever. It is a threat to general public and also to the military as many deployed personnel are severely affected by the diseases transmitted by this mosquito. <br><br>Application of insecticides is the major control methods for mosquitoes. However, few new insecticides have been developed for mosquito control. Recently DEET has been reported as a neurotoxin. Therefore there is need to develop safe and environmentally friendly insecticides. Natural products offer diverse classes of compounds with varying modes of action. <br><br>In this project several natural products have been identified and synthesized as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors towards termites and mosquitoes that have inhibitory activity when tested against mosquito and termite homogenates which can be further developed as insecticides.

DIBENZYL GLYCOSYL PHOSPHATE SYNTHESIS ON ION EXCHANGE RESIN
Dmitry Vladimirovich Vasilyev
GOU Moscow Chemical Lyceum No.1303, Moscow, n/a, RUSSIA

Cause for many severe deceases, such as staphylococcus, meningococci, ulcer, are pathogenic bacteria. All bacterias use oligosaccharides on their outer membrane as defense against human immune system. Nowadays the oligosacharide's vaccines are on the front-line of medicinal chemistry.<br><br>For the synthesis of such oligosaccharides 2 approaches can be applied: synthetic & enzymatic. The artificial enzymatic route requires glycosyl phosphates of different structures. One of the main precursors for glycosyl phosphates are dibenzyl glycosyl phosphates.<br><br>Modern organic chemists develop novel synthetic methods on the guideline of 'green chemistry'. Ion exchange resin is one of the most widespread “green” reagents, but it had never been applied for the synthesis of glycosyl phosphates before our project.<br><br>We’d developed a new method of glycosyl phosphate synthesis on ion exchange resin Amberlyst A-26 in dibenzyl phosphate form. It has a lot of essential advantages comparing with classical methods of synthesis. Such as the target product can be purified by simple filtration, a great excess of phosphate reagent positively influence on the product's yield.<br><br>Glycosyl phosphate synthesis’ method on ion exchange resin was tested on different acetylated glycosyl derivatives. We aimed to develop an approach to synthesis of 2-aminoglycosyl phosphates, that were harder to prepare in compare with glucose, galactose, or mannose because of its reactivity. Different aminoglycosyl derivatives were selectively obtained in both axial & equatorial configurations with high yields. The structures of all obtained substances were confirmed by spectral data (NMR 1H, 13C, 31P & mass-spectra).<br><br>Due to our work the “green reagent” ion exchange resin was applied for the glycosylation reaction for the 1st time.

THE EFFECTS OF HEAT ON THE REDUCTION PROPERTY OF ANTIOXIDANTS
Aunika Lynn Swenson
Dickinson High School, Dickinson, ND

Antioxidants are essential to cell health and viability because they protect cells from the harmful effects of free radicals. One way they can do so is by reducing the free radical without becoming reactive themselves thus stabilizing it and preventing further damage. This project was designed to test the effects that the addition of heat from different sources has on the reduction ability of antioxidants. Tomato, carrot, cranberry, and apple juices were heated by oven, stove, and microwave for varying intervals. The relative amounts of antioxidants with reduction abilities were found in each of the juice samples by performing a titration with iodine where an oxidation-reduction reaction occurred. The antioxidants in the juice samples reduced the iodine, and when the antioxidants were fully oxidized the iodine reacted with a starch indicator turning the solution blue/purple and signifying the completion of the reaction. The volume of titrant needed to complete the reaction for each of the samples was compared to the control. It was concluded that the introduction of all forms of heat negatively affected the ability for antioxidants to reduce the iodine and heating by the oven had the most significant effect, followed by stove, and then microwave. Possible explanations for this include that heat either destroys or denatures antioxidants to the point where they are unable to function as they previously did, or that the additional heat energy generated free radicals in the samples which caused a spontaneous reduction by the antioxidants and depleting the available supply.

CELLULOSIC ETHANOL
Jasmine LouAnn Kreft
Trinity Christian School, Williston, ND

Purpose: Determine if milfoil could be used as a competitve alternative fuel source.<br><br>I began by weighing out 30 50g samples of dried milfoil.Milfoil samples were ground into a powder; 9 samples were combined with 255 mL of hydrated cellulase mixture to depolymerize cellulose. 5 samples allowed to sit in 40oC incubator for 24 hrs, 4 allowed to sit in 40oC incubator for 72 hrs. Cellulase deactivated by heating the mash to 90oC for 10 min and then allowed to cool to 40oC. I added 1g of activated yeast mixed with 15mL 40oC water to each mash. Airlocks placed on each flask containing mash. 5 samples combined with 255mL of 1.5M H2SO4, 5 samples combined with 255mL of 3.0M H2SO4, 5 samples combined with 255mL of 1.5M HCl and 5 samples combined with 255mL of 3.0M HCl to depolymerize the cellulose. These samples were allowed to sit in a hot water bath for 120 min while the mash temperature was held constant at 90oC. All 20 mashes were allowed to cool to 40oC and H2SO4 samples were neutralized with concentrated NH4OH and HCl samples were neutralized with 6.0M NaOH to pH of 5 when tested with hydrion paper.<br><br>Liquid in each of 30 mashes was removed using Buchner funnel. Liquid from each flask distilled at 90oC using an organic distillation kit. Each distillation was allowed to collect product for 2 hrs after liquid reached a temp of 90oC. Mass and volume of each product was recorded<br><br> <br><br>Results(average for each group):1.5M H2SO4-1.24 mL,1.29g; 3.0M H2SO4-1.45mL,1.41g; 1.5M HCl-2.63mL,2.46g; 3.0M HCl-1.3mL, 1.18g;cellulase1-1.13mL,1.35g; cellulase2-no data produced<br><br>I conclude my hypothesis was partially verified. Milfoil produced slightly smaller yields than small grains but has no cost to grow. Thus, milfoil would be a competitively priced option as an alternative fuel source.

In this experiment, a gel electrophoresis chamber was used to separate the different macromolecules contained in green, orange, burgundy, and black food coloring. The experimenter conducted an electric current through an agar gel. Charged molecules migrated toward the oppositely charged terminal. Molecules moved at different speeds based on their size.<br><br>A gel electrophoresis chamber was created using a soap dish as a chamber to hold the gel. Agar powder was used to make the gel solution. Stainless steel wires were placed at opposite ends in the gel to create positive and negative electrodes. The gel was immersed in a NaHCO3 buffer solution: this supplied ions to transmit the current and maintained the pH. Each food coloring dye was loaded into wells created from a comb placed in the gel. Power was connected using alligator clips linking batteries to the two electrodes. Molecules contained in the gel were separated as they migrated to the positively charged electrode.<br><br>The green, orange, and maroon dyes separated into two colors. The black dye separated into four colors. Lighter colors separated more quickly than the darker colors. Black contained the largest macromolecules. Yellow was the smallest macromolecule. Green dye separated out the fastest.<br><br>Food coloring dyes are made from different color molecules. This project proves lighter colored macromolecules move farther and more quickly through the electrophoresis chamber. This experiment provides insight into the use of gel electrophoresis by forensic scientists to take out RNA, DNA, and proteins from samples found at crime scenes.

THE EFFECT OF HEAT TREATMENT ON CALCIUM LACTATE CRYSTALLIZATION ON CHEDDAR CHEESE
Flora Kathleen Su
South Burlington High School, South Burlington, VT

Calcium lactate crystallization (CLC) on Cheddar cheese is a plague to the dairy industry. Most consumers reject cheeses with the crystals, mistaking them for unwanted microorganisms. The purpose of this study was to test if a heat treatment on Cheddar cheese would significantly decrease CLC. Heating conditions were chosen to imitate the effect of exposing cheese to room temperature (21 C) before long-term storage in a refrigerator (1 C). A cheese block made at the University pilot plant was sectioned into 12 specimens (3x4x13 cm), each having a rough surface from the exterior of the block due to curd granule junctions and press cloth indentations and a smooth surface created when cut with a wire-cutting device. These were randomly assigned to two trials. The control group was immediately stored at 0 C. The experimental group was heated in a moist oven at 100 C for 5 minutes before packaging and storage at 0 C. Digital photographs of samples were taken biweekly for 20 weeks. Using image analysis, the number and area of crystal regions were determined. Data were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA. The number and area of crystal regions were significantly affected by heat treatment and surface roughness. Heat treatment caused substantial reductions in CLC rates relative to control cheeses, and rough surfaces crystallized more readily than smooth surfaces. The results indicate that brief, intense heating followed by vacuum packaging caused smoother cheese surfaces that were less susceptible to CLC, which could be a potential solution for cheese processors.

COST EFFECTIVE AND INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION PREVENTION DYEING OF WOOL AND POLYAMIDE SUBSTRATES WITH EXTRACTS OF NATURAL SOURCES
Muhammad Sohail Mustafa, Asjad Shaheen, Amir Shahzad
Defence Authority Degree College For Men, Karachi, Sindh, PAKISTAN

Wool and polyamide have unique properties and they are consumable items in field of textile as apparel, home furnishing and industrial application. These both fibers are widely used worldwide next to cotton and polyester. Dyeing of these fibers convert them to value added product, is a considerable task. Synthetic dyes and additives that are used to exhaust syntactic dyes on substrate are hazardous to handle. Their usage may leave harmful residue in the finished product and in the dyeing effluent. This study was performed to investigate the application of low cost natural dyes on wool and polyamide substrate to obtain considerable light and wash fastness properties. Dyeing of the substrates using extract of the natural sources is not only cost-effective but also secure for the environment and human being.<br><br>Eight natural dyes were extracted out of which four from Amla, Henna, Mustard and Hurhurh and other four from the bark of the trees of Pipal , Keeker and Tahli and roots of Banyan using water as an extracting solvent. Extracted dyes were applied on wool and polyamide substrates without using any additives.<br><br>It was concluded after experimentation that dyes were more effective on wool as compared to polyamide (nylon) and amongst natural dyes Hurhurh showed the best of results. Synthetic dyes are carcinogenic and can cause skin disease whereas these natural dyes are completely harmless. These natural dyes are extracted from the bark of the trees so they are cost effective and would maximize profits.<br><br>These natural dyes should be extracted on an industrial level and they should be commercialized, further research should be conducted so that we can benefit from this resource as much as possible.

INVESTIGATION OF RAIN-X™ AND SUNSCREEN COATING, YEAR THREE: PROTECTION AGAINST RADIATION-INDUCED OXIDATIVE STRESS
Derek Robert Lam, Brigette Mary Lee, 
Keystone School, San Antonio, TX

In previous projects, three different sunscreen – Rain-X™ mixtures were shown to effectively block UVA light and were not ecotoxic. Mixture 3, made with sunscreen Mustela, contained nanosized titanium dioxide (TiO2), a photocatalyst that produces reactive oxygen species (ROS). Shen et al. has shown that encapsulation of TiO2 reduces ROS production. Using dichlorofluorescin (DCFH) as a fluorescent probe, this study investigated whether Mixture 3 could reduce ROS production. An important step in photoirradiated-induced DNA damage by TiO2 is Cu(II) to Cu(I) reduction, which was also qualitatively measured. Finally, ecotoxicity of all three mixtures was evaluated under different lighting conditions.<br><br>DCFH-DA was hydrolyzed in vitro by NaOH and in vivo by esterates in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. DCF fluorescence was compared between TiO2 alone, TiO2 with ascorbic acid, and Mixture 3 for up to 2 hours of UVA irradiation. Absorbance of the Cu(I)-bathocuproine complex was measured at 480 nm after UVA irradiation for Mixture 3 and TiO2 with and without ascorbic acid. Ecotoxicity of the three different sunscreen – Rain-X™ mixtures and TiO2 concentrations under 5 different lighting conditions (12 or 24 hours of visible light or UVA, or 24 hours of darkness) was evaluated using Escherichia coli as a test for ecotoxicity.<br><br>In conclusion, Mixture 3, when compared to other experimental groups, produced more ROS in vitro but not in vivo. Compared to TiO2 alone, Mixture 3 decreased the extent of Cu(II) to Cu(I) reduction. The ecotoxicity of TiO2 was concentration-dependent. The ecotoxicity of the mixtures depended on lighting conditions and exposure duration.

SYNTHESIS AND ANALYSIS OF THE NEW SUPERCONDUCTING MATERIAL - FESE NANOCRYSTALS
Jacqueline Hung, Chi-Chieh, Lin, 
Taipei Municipal First Girls' Senior High School, Taipei, CHINESE TAIPEI

The diamagnetic and zero-resistance nature of superconductors can greatly reduce the amount of energy lost, but at present the critical temperature (Tc) for superconductors is too low and their structures are too complex for widespread use. In 2008, scientists discovered the FeSe superconductor, which has a simpler structure and does not possess toxicity, but its Tc is still quite low. According to recent publications, turning superconductors into nanoscale particles may enhance its Tc. Therefore, we decided to find a more effective method to synthesize FeSe nanocrystallites and analyze their superconductivity. After going through many experiments, we found some effective chemical preparations including trioctylphosphine oxide/trioctylphosphine (TOPO-TOP) hot melt method, hot injection method, and Ethylene glycol (EG) / Polyethylene glycols (PEG) / TOP hot melt method. Furthermore, both changing the proportions of iron and selenium reactants, and using different iron reactants affected the product. Most importantly, the nanocrystals produced had many different structures, one of which demonstrated a similar superconductive structure to bulk materials (tetragonal Fe1Se1) and its Tc could be higher than that of the bulk materials.

SMALL SCALE ALUMINOTHERMIC TITANIUM REDUCTION
Dylan James Hinrichs, Aaron Waller, Alex Wise
West Linn High School, West Linn, OR

The purpose of our experiment was to examine the efficiency of smelting titanium on a small scale through an aluminothermic reaction. This was accomplished through the reaction between aluminum powder and titanium dioxide, with additional aluminum and calcium sulfate hemihydrate reacting simultaneously to provide additional heat. We calculated stoichiometric and thermochemical ratios of quantities of heat-boosting to titanium-producing reactions, assuming no heat loss, and empirically adjusted these ratios to account for heat loss, discovering that the higher ratios of booster to titanium reaction were more efficient. We also tested to see whether it would be more efficient if all three chemicals were completely mixed, or if they were stratified with the booster reaction separate from the titanium producing reaction. The reaction is more efficient when the booster is separate from the titanium producing reaction and when the booster is underneath the titanium dioxide. Increasing the total mass of the reactants from approximately 100g to 250g or more also resulted in higher proportional yields of titanium. We discovered that, while our procedure was effective in reducing the titanium dioxide, the yielded titanium is impure, structurally weak, and encased tightly in waste products, creating errors in percent yields and necessitating further refinement. Avenues for improvement exist, such as the addition of fluoride salts to reduce the viscosity of waste products, enhancing their separation from the reduced titanium, and using phosphoric acid to dissolve all reaction products besides titanium. This reaction is currently far less economically efficient than industrial methods of titanium production.

BISPHENOL-A LEVELS IN STORE RECEIPTS
Yan Ellen Yin, Madeline Hamlin, 
Crescent Valley High School, Corvallis, OR

Bisphenol-A is a synthesizer commonly found in polycarbonate plastics such as water bottles. It has been brought to the attention of the science community in recent years due to the potential health risks that have been found to occur from exposure to BPA. Previous studies have tested the contamination of water from BPA migration in water bottles. This study tests a different medium through which BPA can be transferred: store receipts. As this is a newer aspect of the BPA controversy, the main focus of this study was to determine the presence or lack thereof of BPA in store receipts and whether there was any variation between samples collected from different sources. Dichloromethane was used to extract the BPA from the receipt samples. After adding 0.1 normal sodium hydroxide to the DCM in a liquid to liquid extraction, methanol was used to dilute the solution. The samples were run through a High Proficiency Liquid Chromatography instrument to test for BPA based on the retention time of BPA and calibration curve produced from each sample. Through research, this study has concluded that a significant amount of BPA—an average of 14.4 mg of BPA per gram of receipt—is present in store receipts, though the amount varied from sample to sample. This statement however, does not hold true for one of the sources from which receipt samples were gathered, as that particular group of samples did not show any evidence of BPA.

A COMBINED APPROACH: COMPARING LIQUID RUNWAY DEICER PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS WITH THEIR IMPACT ON AIRCRAFT CORROSION, CATALYTIC OXIDATION, THE ENVIRONMENT, AND THE ECONOMY
Bailie Jo Bryant, Lynnely Parker, 
Central Lee High School, Donnellson, IA

Our project took a combined approach to research major components of liquid runway deicers (LRD's). <br><br>We chose this project because individual components have been reviewed, but no combined evaluation performed. Associated costs and safety affect millions daily. <br><br>For each component, we used traditional LRD, a combination fluid (bio/traditional), one solely bio-based LRD and a control as solutions. <br><br>Performance: We followed SHRP-H332 method (with selected modifications), placing distilled water in Petri dishes and freezing at three separate temperatures. Measured quantities of three LRD's were introduced at set time intervals. Brine was decanted, volumes measured/recorded. Procedures were repeated for three sets, at three different temperatures.<br><br>Corrosion: We followed ASTM Designation F483-98. We cleaned, marked & weighed three sets of metal coupons, dried them, and placed them in jars of the solutions. They were placed in an L-C oven at 100ºF (± 5), removed at 24 and 144 hours, cleaned, dried, weights, and appearance recorded.<br><br>Catalytic Oxidation: We followed the revised method from the A-5A group for catalytic oxidation (with selected modifications). Weights of numbered/engraved brake coupons were recorded, anti-oxidant coated, cured & re-weighed. Coupons were randomized, soaked in the solutions, dried, weighed and heated at 1022ºF for 8 hours for 3 cycles.<br><br>Environmental and Cost: Data from a major LRD manufacturer was researched and compared.<br><br>Statistical analyses were performed for each component.<br><br>Our studies concluded a new, bio-based LRD, 'X', was best in the majority of areas compared: corrosion, catalytic oxidation, environmental and cost, while just slightly less in performance.

PORE-SIZE CHARACTERIZATION OF MONOLITHIC CAPILLARY COLUMNS FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY
Kenneth Wayne Lee, Garth Lee, 
American Fork High School, American Fork, UT

A recent innovation in the field of liquid chromatography is the use of monoliths as chemical separation media. A monolith is created by introducing a mixture of organic reagents (photoinitiator, crosslinker, and porogen) in a fused-silica column and exposing the mixture to ultraviolet radiation. As polymerization of the monolith proceeds, a porous structure is formed. The through-pore size distribution in the monolith determines the mobile phase flow rate and column efficiency, or separation power. A home-built capillary flow porometer was used to characterize the through-pore size distributions in a series of monolithic capillary columns. Monoliths representing three different formulations (i.e., percentage of monomers, initiator, and porogens) were synthesized. Various sections of the monolithic columns were characterized using capillary flow porometry to determine the pore size distributions. Using this technique, the flow rate through the monolith is measured as the pressure is gradually increased for both dry and liquid-filled monoliths. Calculations from the data obtained yield the average through-pore size and pore size distribution in a monolith. For the three monolith types synthesized and characterized, the average pore diameters ranged from 0.08 to 1.3 micrometers. The monolith synthesized from a higher percentage of porogen contained the smallest and greatest number of pores averaging 0.1 micrometers in diameter. When separations were performed, this monolith showed the best performance. The most desirable distribution appears to be one with most of its pores ranging from 0.08 to 0.2 micrometers in diameter.

COMPARISON OF REDOX TITRATION WITH A NEW DENSITY-BASED DEVICE FOR THE ANALYSIS OF CHROME PLATING BATH SOLUTIONS
Yae Eun Oh, Jasmine Podell, 
Marian High School, Mishawaka, IN

An American Chrome Plating Company (name withheld by request) performs chrome plating on work rolls to flatten metal sheeting. With the hope of the company going ‘green’, the purpose of the research is to help this company to investigate a new device to identify when to stabilize the plating baths by the addition of chromic acid. The hypothesis is that the new device is more accurate and precise in detecting the changes in chromium concentrations. To effectively plate, the densities of the baths must fall between 1.23 g/mL and 1.25 g/mL. Company officials provided samples. The redox titration was emulated in 1:100 diluted solutions to evaluate the current process. Concentrations from the titration were converted to densities: Plant B #1=1.1438 -1.2510 g/mL and Plant B #2=1.18047-1.26813 g/mL. Salt solutions were constructed to mimic the chrome baths. The new density plastics were dropped into the salt solutions. The buoyancy of the new density device plastics determined the Plant B#1’s density (1.14-1.17 g/mL) and Plant B #2’s density (1.17-1.24 g/mL). The new density-based device is the most precise. The redox titration demonstrated imprecision. By the consistent buoyancy of the plastics and the smaller range of resulting densities, the new density-based device supports the precision element of the hypothesis. Both methods are not dependable for accuracy due to the uncertainty of when it is necessary to add chromic acid. With the correct density plastics, the new method could enhance the effectiveness of the chrome plating at the American Chrome Plating Company.

APPLICATION OF WATER-SOLUBLE POLYMER ACID CATALYST TO SACCHARIFICATION OF BIOMASS
Shohei Ochiai, Taiki Sunaba, Noriyoshi Oka
Okayama Ichinomiya High School, Okayama, Okayama, JAPAN

We investigated saccharification of cellulosic biomass that does not have been still utilized enough as new energy sources, and found that the high-polymer sulfonic acid can be a new efficient catalyst and the heavy environmental load caused by the conventional sulfuric acid can be much reduced by our catalyst. <br><br>Recently the carbon-based sulfonic acid, a heterogeneous catalyst, has been proposed as a promising alternate of the sulfuric acid. On the analogy of enzymes which specifically coordinate to their substrates and work as catalysts, we supposed that high-polymer sulfonic acids should work effectively as homogeneous catalysts if they have an affinity to the cellulose. By the hydrolysis experiments of microcrystalline cellulose, it was found out that the 30% aqueous solution of the high-polymer acid had a catalytic performance approximately equivalent to that of the 15% aqueous solution of sulfuric acid and superior to the conventional solid acid catalysts like zeolite. It was also shown that the increase of the hydrogen ion concentration and the reaction temperature accelerated the hydrolysis rate as anticipated.<br><br>By analyzing our experimental results and the data shown in the literatures, we predict the existence of the third factor determining the reaction rate, in addition to the temperature and the hydrogen ion concentration. The third factor is related to the affinity between the catalyst and the cellulose. It is expected that the hydrolysis rate is still more improved by designing the high-polymer acids that have both high acid density and strong affinity to cellulose.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF A LYCOPENE-BASED SUN CREAM
Nicole Ingrid Lynch, Aoife Maire White, 
St. Mary's College, Londonderry/City, Ulster, NORTHERN IRELAND

Research has shown that Lycopene is a super antioxidant that stabilises free radicals in the body. It is found in foods such as tomatoes and water melon where it acts as an inbuilt sunscreen, protecting the fruit against UV radiation. <br><br>Preliminary experiments showed that commercial sun creams had a short shelf life thus reducing their long-term effectiveness. The fact that Lycopene can be reactivated in the presence of Vitamins E and C raised the possibility that the inclusion of these vitamins could produce a viable and enduring sun-cream without the need for inorganic components.<br><br>As Lycopene is an aliphatic compound, a way needed to be developed to combine it with Vitamins C and/or E and give it a consistency which allowed for easy and effective application. <br><br> <br><br>Repeated experimentation showed that the most effective protocol involved dissolving the Lycopene and Vitamin E in Soya Oil with the further addition of Coco Butter thus dispensing of the need for Vitamin C. The relative proportions (2 parts Coco Butter to 1 part Soya Oil) and the sources of the various ingredients proved vital in providing the final optimal consistency. The product also offered potential as a ‘tanning’ application.<br><br>Varying the concentration of Lycopene, produced a range of SPF (sun protection factor) values from 2 up to 40. Higher SPF values were achievable with greater Lycopene concentrations.<br><br> <br><br>‘Lycopene’ sun cream offers market potential as a completely natural and sustainable product, free from synthetic ingredients, providing long shelf life and a desirable false tan effect.

Andreas Wagner, Jurgen Kochl, 
HTL Braunau Am Inn, Braunau am Inn, Upper Austria, AUSTRIA

Although a lot of research was done in the last two decades, the dye sensitized solar cell still cannot compete with the silicon solar cell – mainly because of the following issues:<br><br>- Long term stability and sealing<br><br>- Costs<br><br>- Efficiency<br><br>- Scaling up to larger cells <br><br>The idea of this project was to test low cost materials in dye sensitized solar cells and to show how certain changes of the cell components affect the efficiency and long term stability of the cell. <br><br>A lot of new low cost materials were applied for this project. For example a very cheap graphite spray was used as an alternative to platinum. Only one component of the cell was changed at a time to determine how well the new low cost element works.<br><br>A very interesting dependency of changes of the cell components on the power output was shown. Especially the graphite layer was able to compete with the platinum counter electrode. A visible degradation and regeneration of the cell was observed. Decoloration of titanium dioxide plates in different solvents under illumination was examined.<br><br>Against our expectations our low cost cells produced a relatively high power output in comparison to the expensive cells. A very detailed production manual is described and published to encourage a free know-how transfer on the field of dye sensitized solar cells.

DETERMINING THE VIABILITY OF CERTAIN ORGANIC MATERIALS AS WATER IMPERMEABLE BARRIERS FOR A GREEN FOOD TRAY
Aric Daniel Reviere, Lauren Carter, 
Paul M Dorman High School, Roebuck, SC

The goal of this experiment was to determine which organic material and what mass of that material would result in the best biodegradable water repellent barrier on Biosphere biodegradable pie trays. Using a Chitosan Solution, a Chitosan Solution cross-linked with Citric Acid, a Copal Solution, and a Damar Solution, the trays were coated with one, two, or three coats of a particular solution. Including three control trays, a total of fifteen trays were conditioned in a humidity chamber with a relative humidity of 53%. Once conditioned for a twenty-four hour period, each of the fifteen trays underwent the Gurley-Cobb Test to determine the water repellency of the coatings. The Cobb Test values of the coated trays were compared to the Cobb Test values of the control trays to determine any shift in water repellency. As a result, the Chitosan Solution trays absorbed more water than the control trays did. The Chitosan Solution cross-linked with Citric Acid, the Copal Solution, and the Damar Solution all decreased the water absorption of the Biosphere biodegradable trays. Of these, Copal Solution trays did the best with its three coatings tray repelling the most amount of water of all the Cobb Tests. Conclusively, though theoretically effective, none of these organic materials would be an ideal coating for production.

Sebastian River High School, Sebastian, FL

The purpose of the experiment is to determine the temperature condition that the luminol test yields the brightest reaction and has the fastest initial reaction rate. <br><br> If the potassium ferricyanide is put under warm conditions in reaction with the luminol solution, it will be detected easier than in cold or room temperature conditions, thus yielding a brighter reaction and a faster reaction rate. <br><br> Put on safety equipment. Prepare the luminol solution. Mix 10 milliliters of the luminol solution and 10 milliliters of hydrogen peroxide in a 50 milliliter Erlenmeyer flask. Measure three 0.1 gram samples of potassium ferricyanide. Put one sample in an ice bath at about 7°C. Place the next sample on a hot plate at 96°C. The last sample is left at room temperature—21°C. Pour sample into the E. flask with the luminol solution. Immediately turn off lights, start the stopwatch, and place the stopper on the flask. Observe. Record the amount of gas collected every ten seconds. Stop recording after 90 seconds. Record final amount of gas collected. Repeat with all samples and five times for accuracy.<br><br> The 7°C reaction had the fastest initial reaction, releasing gas at a rate of 0.164 mL/second with the brightest comparative luminescence: a “one” on the provided color scale. The 96°C reaction was the next fastest and next brightest with 0.139 mL/second and a “two” on the color scale. The 21°C reaction was the slowest and dullest, with 0.134 mL/second and a “two” on the color scale.

Community Secondary School, Akiffort, Akwa Ibom State, NIGERIA

The thought of litmus, a plant extract, as an acid-base indicator, provoked this research. Several plant extracts, all weeds in Akwa Ibom State , Nigeria , were investigated for use as acid-base indicator. Weighing was done using a Philip Harris electronic balance. Extraction was done in 96% ethanol. The extracts were filtered using Whatman filter paper. <br><br>Colour-change fell into two main groups – those producing red in acid and green in alkali, and those producing pink or orange in acid and yellow in alkali. Some extracts changed colours in acid and alkali, others only in alkali and some did not change at all. <br><br>Ten plants were investigated. Six were finally selected. Among the best indicators were Dissotis rotundifolia (petals), Eremomastax speciosa (leaves), Cnestis ferruginea (fruits), and Combretum racemosum (petals). Variation in pH values was investigated using pH meter. The six extracts were mixed in certain proportions to obtain Kaffot Universal Indicator. Titration using 0.1 M HCl, 0.1 NaOH, and three drops of the indicator gave an end-point of 11.3. With methyl orange, it was 11.77. <br><br>Strips of filter paper saturated with the indicator were an effective one-spot test paper. Chromatography indicated red and blue colours. <br><br>Two mathematical formulae were developed to calculate the quantities of extract and anthocyanin. <br><br>Benefits include cheap indicator, the use of one strip of paper to test for acid and base, students' better understanding of science, effective teaching aid, exciting and activity-based lessons, and possible commercial production.

IMPROVING PIEZOELECTRIC NANOGENERATORS, YEAR II: NUCLEATION OF NANOCATALYSTS FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF NI-DOPED ZNO NANOWIRES
Morgan McKay Monroe
Episcopal High School of Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL

Our world's fossil fuel supply is running dry. As such, it is imperative that we develop alternative forms of energy sources to prevent an energy crisis in the near future. Piezoelectric nanogenerators are perfect for the task of small scale energy scavenging devices. However, these generators still have many hurdles to jump before they are economically viable, including problems with organization of the nanowires within the generators, energy output, and generator lifespan.<br><br><br>The purpose of this investigation was: 1) Develop a reproducible process for the controlled, organized growth of ZnO nanowires via nanopatterning techniques. 2) Determine what concentration of nickel dopant introduced into the nanowires produces optimal conductivity for use in piezoelectric nanogenerators.<br><br><br>A nanoindentation system was used to pattern the substrates with multiple indentation arrays varying in force applied to generate and spacing between indentations. A thin film of gold was sputtered onto the substrate and annealed. Atomic force microscopy was used throughout the duration of the study for imaging of the arrays at each stage of the investigation. This was used to assess the organization of the annealed gold nucleation points on the arrays. The optimal parameters were determined to be a force load of 5.0mN used to create the indentations and a spacing of 500nm between indentations. This set of parameters was then used to produce ZnO nanowires with varied concentrations of nickel dopant using a chemical vapor deposition growth method.<br><br><br>SEM and AFM microscopy were used to analyze the wires and test for increased conductivity and durability. Analysis of this data is currently in progress.

A NEW WAY IN DIAGNOSTICS OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA
Erika Gedeonova
Sportovni Gymnazium Kladno, Kladno, CZECH REPUBLIC

Diagnostic methods for Asthma bronchiale, utilized in the contemporary medical practice, have so far consisted of a combination of semi-invasive or invasive interventions. In this project, alternative technique was developed to facilitate diagnosis of bronchial asthma by an advanced, non-invasive and inexpensive method. The idea is based on the quantification of specific substances - so-called biomarkers - in exhaled breath condensate (EBC). Concentration levels of the biomarkers in this matrix are significantly elevated as a consequence of proceeding pathological processes in airways and lungs.<br><br>The project investigates concentration levels of biomarkers significant in Asthma Bronchiale in EBC, in particular cysteinyl leukotrienes. Analysis of the EBC combines a suitable separation (immunoseparation) with the sensitive and selective detection method - liquid chromatography connected with mass spectrometry. Immunoseparation was carried out using magnetic nanoparticles and polymer lenses with immobilized antibodies against leukotrienes.<br><br>The applicability of the suggested method was proved using clinical samples. It was demonstrated that the concentration levels of the biomarkers in healthy patients (77,8 ± 13,8 pg/ml KVV) were significantly different from the concentration levels in subjects with bronchial asthma (133,2 ± 20,1 pg/ml KVV).<br><br>The contribution of this project consists in the preparation of a diagnostic strip as a user-friendly tool for patients to determine early values of biomarkers in urine and thus enable early identification of pathological processes in the organism, i.e. facilitating an early treatment allowing minimizing the damage to the organism.

EFFECT OF COPPER ION CHELATION ON CURCUMIN’S ANTIOXIDANT CAPACITY
Chelsea Lynn Massaro
Christian Home & Bible School, Mount Dora, FL

The purpose of this experiment is to determine curcumin’s ability to work as an effective antioxidant and to analyze copper (II)’s effect on curcumin’s antioxidant capacity. Previous work has shown that curcumin strongly chelates copper (II). I hypothesized that if curcumin is added to a solution containing DPPH, then curcumin will work as an effective antioxidant and scavenge the radicals. If copper is added to said solution, then it will have no effect on curcumin’s antioxidant capacity.<br><br> To perform experiment, mix stock solutions needed for experimentation. Using stock solutions, mix solutions for trial. Run baseline solution of ethyl alcohol and phosphate buffer for UV Visible Spectrometer. Insert sample of each solution into cuvette and run UV Visible Spectrometer for each sample. At the conclusion of trial, properly dispose of all chemical waste.<br><br> The UV Visible Spectrometer measurements show that curcumin is effectively scavenging the radicals in the solution and that copper (II) only moderately reduces curcumin’s antioxidant capacity. This is indicated by the rise and falls of the peaks in absorbance of the different samples shown on the spectra. <br><br> My results supported my hypothesis by showing curcumin’s ability to work as an antioxidant. However, my hypothesis was disproved by copper (II)’s slight negative effect on curcumin’s antioxidant capacity. This demonstrates that curcumin, a polyphenolic beta-dicarbonyl found in the spice turmeric, may offer medical advantages by working as an antioxidant.

Breck School, Minneapolis, MN

The goal of my study was to synthesize 9,10-diphenylindenotetracene and<br><br>2-methoxy-9,10-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)indenotetracene, novel indene<br><br>derivatives, for implementation in organic photovoltaic devices. I began<br><br>by synthesizing a starting material (5,6,11,12-tetrachlorotetracene) and<br><br>the Grignard reagent 4-methoxyphenylmagnesium bromide. I combined<br><br>those two compounds with a PEPPSI-iPr catalyst in a Kumada<br><br>cross-coupling reaction to produce the methoxylated indene derivative.<br><br>To purify the derivatives, I used two techniques: wet column<br><br>chromatography and recrystalization. To optimize the purification<br><br>procedure for wet column chromatography, I tested various ratios of<br><br>hexanes to methylene chloride, finding that a 2:1 ratio (v/v) was the<br><br>most effective solvent system. When thin-layer chromatography tests<br><br>showed impurities after wet column purification, I tested various<br><br>solvent systems, finding that a 2:2:1 ratio (v/v) of toluene,<br><br>isopropanol, and methanol eliminated impurities. 1H NMR showed that<br><br>purification of the methoxylated indene derivative was highly<br><br>successful; therefore, I concentrated on scaling-up the reaction, which<br><br>allowed the targeted indene derivative to be synthesized in quantities<br><br>large enough for implementation in an organic photovoltaic device.

In this experiment, different concentrations of electrolyte salt were used to test wither the increasing concentration of the electrolyte salt has an effect on the rate of production of hydrogen gas. 3500 mL of distilled water and 190g of salt were used to make a 5% salt solution. The 5% salt solution was diluted to make 4%, 3%, 2%, 1% salt solutions. The control had no electrolyte salt added to the distilled water. Each test was started with a 3 amp generator. According the experimenter’s findings, the results showed how the rate of production of hydrogen gas during the process of electrolysis was affected by the increasing concentration of electrolyte salt. The average of 1% salt solution produced hydrogen gas in 8.8% less time than the control group. The average of 2% salt solution produced hydrogen gas in 50.3% less time than the control group. The average of 3% salt solution produced hydrogen gas in 51.9% less time than the control group. The average of 4% salt solution produced hydrogen gas in 60.7% less time than the control group. The average of 5% salt solution produced 77.7% less time than the control group. With such results we can conclude that the hypothesis is accepted, the rate of production of hydrogen gas increased as the concentration of electrolyte salt was increased.

ADVENTURES IN THE DENDRITRIC CRYSTALLIZATION OF POTASSIUM BROMIDE
Jack Daniel Francis McCann
Loreto College, Coleraine, Northern Ireland, UNITED KINGDOM

This study centers on the crystallization of the ionic alkali halide Potassium Bromide (KBr) in the presence of Lead(II) ions. Crystallization was carried out from a hot saturated solution with Lead (II) ion concentrations in the range of 0 – 16 000 ppm. Increasing Lead ion concentration resulted in smaller crystal size and slower crystallization. The process was studied photographically by still photography using time lapse methods.<br><br>The emission of sound and light was also studied. A hydrophone and recording system was constructed. It was found that sounds could be recorded during crystallization. The sounds came in came in groups of 2 or 3. The recorded sounds were loaded into a computer and subjected to analysis and spectral subtraction by a software package confirming the sound patterns heard by ear. <br><br>The study of the light that may be emitted (crystalloluminesence) was carried out using a digital camera with very long exposure times in an specially designed apparatus. The results were initially intriguing. However the light detected cannot be proved to be other than noise in the camera or an image of the colors in the black paper lining the experimental system. Further experiments are presently being carried out using traditional photographic film and separately with a photomultiplier tube. <br><br>An explanation is speculated (Addition Clusterization) that is believed to explain the experimental evidence.

The increase in energy crisis and water pollution has caused many problems in Pakistan and all over the world over the last few decades. In this project an attempt has been made to solve such problems in an efficient way. To fulfill the need of electricity, several dams and turbines have been constructed and also other techniques have been used but none of these are generating enough energy. The experiment for designing Organic Battery has been effective because of its efficiency and double benefit to solve such problems.<br><br>Organic Battery is a home-made device which converts chemical energy in waste water into electrical energy. For this experiment polluted water was collected which contained bacteria and ions and it was used in one side of organic battery with zinc metal (anode). Bacteria were used as a catalyst to convert the substrates into electrons. Then this microbial energy was harvested in the form of electricity. Secondly, continuous respiration of bacteria in waste water produced hydrogen ions which were attracted by cathode (copper metal) and there it combined with oxygen ions and electrons to form water.<br><br>From the report and experiment it was proved that OB is very efficient. OB produces electricity from waste water, sea water and organic materials. It is also used in waste water treatment and removes toxic materials from waste water. Further, it can be used in seawater desalination.

THE ELECTROCHEMICAL EFFECTS OF GLUCOSE AND SUCROSE ON THE VOLTAGE OUTPUT OF A MICROBIAL FUEL CELL USING SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE
Jack Erdozain
Westminster Christian School, Palmetto Bay, FL

Microbial fuel cells are a technology that in recent years have seen a explosion in capability and viability as an alternative source of electricity. They have many variations, and finding optimization in their chemical makeup and voltage output will allow for them to be used in a real world market. Being that a microbial fuel cell creates voltage from the metabolic process of microbes and fungi that reside in its anode chamber it would make sense that an addition of glucose or a dimer of it, sucrose, will create a higher voltage in a microbial fuel cell. Through experimentation in which glucose or sucrose was added, the fuel cells with the highest concentration of sugar created the most voltage and for the longest period of time. This is due to the fact that these added chemicals are part of the metabolic cycle of the organisms. These fuel cells were built with baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and metheylene blue in the anode chamber of the microbial fuel cell. The project is applicable to the world because of the fact that these fuel cells could be used in countries off the power grid for the purpose of breaking down compost or other waste products that are biodegradable. It could also produce voltage and create completely clean water to drink. With an increased voltage output and knowledge that a higher concentration in sugar will increase the length at which they produce voltage, new leaps forward can be taken in this new growing field.

SEMIFLUORINATED POLYMER BRUSHES BY SURFACE INITIATED ATOM TRANSFER RADICAL POLYMERIZATION (SI-ATRP) ON LAYER-BY-LAYER MACROINITIATOR MODIFIED SUBSTRATES
Ishita Madan
Plano West Senior High School, Plano, TX

In this study, an alternative method to older techniques of chemically grafting macroinitiators to surfaces was demonstrated. In particular, the Layer-by-Layer (LbL) and surface-initiated polymerization (SIP) methods were employed for the growth of dense polymer brushes. Films with varying layers of ATRP macroinitiators deposited were prepared followed by the subsequent growth of polystyrene (pSt) and poly(styrene-block-pentafluorostyrene) (p(St-b-PFS)) brushes. A direct relationship was found between the number of macroinitiator layers deposited and the brush’s thickness. However, it was also interesting to discover that although the LbL 12 pSt brush obtained was thicker, the subsequent growth of the p(St-b-PFS) block copolymer brush was thinner. It was concluded that the thickness of the initial brush is a determining factor in the succeeding brush growth. The polymers were then put through solvent testing to determine their reaction to an external stimulus. Based on the contact angle measurements, it was determined that the pSt brush had an affinity for the cyclohexane solvent, while the p(St-b-PFS) had one to the trifluoroethanol. The response of the brushes greatly depended on the thickness of each of the block brushes. In this case, the more dominant brush dictated the surface properties upon solvent testing. These results can be applied to create non-stick surfaces, as well as controlling wettability.

As more people suffer from diabetes, understanding the key mechanism and improving the treatments are crucial. Regarding this problem, a convenient and efficient method is designed to trace the key protein insulin in diabetes in vivo, by synthesizing the fluorescent insulin-Au nanodots.<br><br>In order to achieve the sufficient fluorescence efficiency of insulin-Au nanodots without denaturation, optimization with red fluorescence (wavelength maximum=670nm) is conducted. <br><br>The advantages of insulin-Au nanodots are proved to be the following. Compared to organic dyes, gold nanodots allow real-time tracing and much less photobleaching. The synthesized insulin-Au nanodots are capable of binding with insulin receptor and getting into cells as insulin does, testifying by the fluorescent insulin-Au nanodots and glucose uptakes. With comparable biological activity to that of insulin and low cytotoxicity, the fluorescent insulin-Au nanodots are competent markers in vitro or even in vivo.

PHOTOSTABILIZATION OF AN ORGANIC DYE VIA ADSORPTION TO CLAY MINERALS
Maya Ellen Samuels
Har Va'Gai Regional High School, Upper Galilee, ISRAEL

Fading as a result of photochemical degradation is a main concern in the color industry. In recent years hybrid complexes that combine organic molecules with clays have become of increasing interest to science and industry, due to their unique nanostructure and synergic chemical properties.<br><br>The research focused on the photochemical degradation process of the organic dye Methylene Blue (MB) when exposed to ultraviolet and white light. Using spectroscopy, the color stability of MB molecules adsorbed to six different minerals in aqueous colloids was measured and compared with that of a pure MB solution. The results differ among the variety of minerals tested, from impressive stability, to expedited degradation. Surprisingly, analysis of these results showed no correlation with the specific nanostructure of the clay. However, a strong correlation was found between light absorption peak changes to shorter wavelengths, caused by the interaction with the minerals – hypsochromic shift – and the color stabilization. This suggests that a very strong interaction at the electronic level is mandatory to achieve the desired result.<br><br>This research was inspired by ancient Mayan art. The Mayans combined a clay mineral with an organic indigo pigment to preserve it over the centuries from the extreme weather conditions in Mesoamerica. The findings in this work have the potential to bring forth a better understanding of this mechanism. Furthermore, a prospective method could be developed for a cheap and environmentally friendly industrialized technology to create very durable colors. The project demonstrates how solutions to past questions can answer future problems.

MODELING HYDROGEN PRODUCTION CATALYZED BY A NOVEL ELECTROCATALYST WITH DENSITY FUNCTIONAL THEORY
Shubhro Saha
Choate Rosemary Hall, Wallingford, CT

Though hydrogen has been widely accepted as a feasible energy carrier for the future, its production via platinum-based water electrolysis remains costly and inefficient. While most research for platinum alternatives has focused on hydrogenase mimics, this report investigates the proton reduction mechanism of a nickel electrocatalyst, abbreviated LNiX. I computed and analyzed the results of ab-initio calculations at the DFT/B3LYP level of theory to characterize the identity of this novel catalyst. In addition, I developed an understanding of intermolecular interactions, and proposed a plausible reaction mechanism and kinetic profile after considering alternative reaction pathways. Thorough analysis of several configurations for LNiX revealed the water-ligated (LNiH2O+2) and bromine-ligated (LNiBr+1) complexes to be the most stable species. Comparison of reduction potentials developed strong agreement between theory and experiment, and from this the water-ligated complex was determined to be the active catalytic species. A reaction mechanism was proposed, and though the overall reaction is spontaneous, a small kinetic barrier was found to exist before the first protonation step. The findings advance not only the potential for this new class of catalysts as a more affordable alternative to hydrogen production, but the time and cost-efficient computational methodologies implemented can be extended to study similar organometallic complexes.

BIODIESEL: FUELING THE FUTURE
Garrett Michael Thibodeaux
Terrebonne High School, Houma, LA

The purpose of my science was to determine which brand of store-bought cooking oil could be used to make a biodiesel sample most similar to real diesel. I made four different mixtures of biodiesel and tested them against real diesel in self-designed tests to compare properties. I covered a sheet of paper in each substance in turn to perform a flame test. I also completed a viscosity test using a viscometer made from a water bottle. I also observed any emissions visually and by smell. The most efficient batch of biodiesel in comparison to diesel was the batch produced using Great Value brand. I determined the cause of this to be that it was the cheapest brand, which matched my hypothesis. Often, additives are put into cooking oil to make them better for cooking; however, these same additives are the cause of their lessened efficiency.<br><br> I chose to do this project because biodiesel is a growing field and one of many economically viable future alternative fuels. Many people know little to nothing about biodiesel; however, it is relatively simple. I also desire to be a chemical or petroleum engineer, and this is very possibly going to be a large part of those career paths in the future.

BLUE OR UV: WHICH LIGHT WILL HARM VITAMIN B2? CAN VITAMIN C BEAT THEM BOTH?
Hellen Yun Chiou
Carlsbad High School, Carlsbad, NM

Purpose: The purpose of this project was to determine the effect of red, blue, and UV light toward vitamin B2 degradation. The protective function of vitamin C under all light was also investigated. My hypothesis was that blue and UV light would both cause vitamin B2 degradation, and vitamin C would prevent degradation under all conditions.<br><br><br>Methods: Vitamin B2 and vitamin B2 plus vitamin C solutions were prepared as samples. Clear, red, and blue cellophane sheets were cut, and SPF100+ sun screen was spread on one of each color. Samples were put in test tubes and covered by each cellophane sheet and set outside at 12 pm for different time periods. The UV index under each cover was recorded. The absorption of each sample at 438 nm was measured, as was the transmittance of blue light for each cellophane cover used.<br><br><br>Results: Without sun screen, degradation occurred rapidly under clear and blue covers, but was delayed under red covers. When UV light was blocked by sun screen, vitamin B2 still degraded steadily under blue and clear covers, but degradation was not observed under red covers. Adding vitamin C significantly prevented degradation under blue and clear covers, whether sun screen was applied or not.<br><br><br>Conclusion: <br><br>1. Both blue light and UV light cause vitamin B2 degradation. <br><br>2. Vitamin C protects vitamin B2 from degradation caused by both lights. <br><br>3. The protective function of vitamin C is not to filter out the light, but to eliminate harmful particles generated by light.

INVESTIGATION OF IDEAL CONDITIONS TO RETAIN ASCORBIC ACID IN COMMON COOKING METHODS
Alexander Scott Powers
Bellarmine College Preparatory, San Jose, CA

While cooking, chemical reactions occur that result in serious degradation of essential vitamins and nutrients, such as with ascorbic acid, more commonly known as vitamin C. This experiment was designed to quantify and provide insight into the controversial effects of 4 cooking methods on ascorbic acid depletion. <br><br> Fresh broccoli florets were cooked for a range of times utilizing four basic cooking methods: steaming, baking, microwaving, and boiling. The broccoli was cooled, liquefied in a detergent solution to increase break up, and stabilized with acetic acid followed by filtration. The ascorbic acid content of broccoli samples was then assayed using an iodimetric titration. <br><br> Although carried out over a range of times, ascorbic acid content at standard cooking times for each method was used to provide a final comparison. Microwave broccoli lost a minimal 8.0% and steaming 9.5% ascorbic acid as compared to uncooked. Baking and boiling lost a significant 44.4% and 46.6% respectively. Data trends were explained and further investigated with three key concepts; destruction of the molecule, leaching of the soluble ascorbic acid into surrounding water, and enzymatic oxidation by oxygen into dehydroascorbic acid. Measurements of temperatures, pH, and leaching reinforced the conclusions concerning enzymatic action and denaturation at specific temperatures. <br><br> Thus, microwaving proved favorable due to its use of a unique and efficient method to quickly heat the broccoli prior to significant vitamin loss. Although requiring further research into other vitamins and vegetables, this experiment provides the information necessary for cooks as well as ordinary people to make an informed decision.

POLYFUNCTIONALIZED SINGLE-WALLED CARBON NANOTUBES AS NOVEL SCAFFOLDS FOR MULTIMODAL TUMOR-TARGETED THERAPY AND BIOLOGICAL IMAGING
Neil Pathak
Herricks Senior High School, New Hyde Park, NY

A novel drug delivery system (DDS) from single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) has been designed for targeted chemotherapy and radiothermal therapy. This DDS can facilitate a multimodal anticancer treatment consisting of the targeted delivery of taxoids and NIR-induced thermal ablation. The first SWNT-based drug conjugate synthesized in this study for radiothermal studies contained biotin as a tumor-targeting molecule (TTM) and fluorescin isothiocyanate (FITC) as an in vitro imaging label. The second conjugate was synthesized for targeted drug delivery and contained the second-generation taxoid SB-T-1214, a disulfide linker, biotin TTM, and FITC. The last conjugate was designed for multimodal therapy with SB-T-1214, disulfide linker, biotin TTM, and chelated technetium. This radiotracer will allow the multimodal treatment to be evaluated in vivo through the study of pharmacokinetics via positron emission tomography (PET). Confocal fluorescence microscopy (CFM) was used to confirm the specificity that these biotinylated SWNTs exhibit towards the biotin receptors on the cancer cell surface. Additionally, CFM showed the efficacy of radiothermal therapy though the thermal destruction of the cancer cells. This SWNT-based DDS can be used to target cancer through two different mechanisms, and the chelated radiotracer can be used to study the pharmacokinetic profile and monitor the treatment in vivo.

THE INVESTIGATION OF THE KEY STEPS OF DETOXININE TOTAL SYNTHESIS
Alexander Sergeevich Shved
Moscow Chemical Lyceum 1303, Moscow, RUSSIA

Several years ago a new approach for the synthesis of polysubstituted prolinols was proposed. It is based on two modern stereoselective reactions which were discovered and studied during systematic research of the chemistry of nitrocompounds. These reactions are [4+2]-cycloaddition of nitroalkenes to vinyl ethers and rearrangement of corresponding nitronates. <br><br>The first part of the synthesis was the two step conversion of nitrocompound to 2-acyloxynitroalkene via corresponding nitroenamine.<br><br>This step required a lot of experiments to be done in order to find out the appropriate conditions. We have tried various amines and alkalis. The most efficient procedure (dimethylacetal of DMF and lithium hydroxide) was used to synthesize target nitroalkene. <br><br>Obtained nitroalkene underwent Lewis acid mediated cycloaddition to ethyl vinyl ether. This reaction was optimized and a new Lewis acid (equimolar mixture of SnCl4 and Ti(Oi-Pr)4) was proposed. This resulted in 70% yield. We did further experiments using model nitronate as an initial compound. The yields were good and we obtained only one diastereomer of prolinol precursor.<br><br>The conclusion for the research is that a new strategy for the 9 steps total synthesis of detoxinine was proposed and it’s key steps were investigated. We have synthesized key compounds and we have found out the efficient procedures for it.

THE SYNTHESIS OF ORGANOMETALLIC COMPLEXES OF IRIDIUM(III) AND PLATINUM(II) FOR OLED APPLICATIONS
Marek Buchman
School for Extraordinary Gifted Children, Bratislava, SLOVAKIA

Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are very intensively studied since late 1980', because of the great commercial potential and significant improvement of display technologies that this technology can offer. Nowadays, the most challenging aspect of OLEDs is improvement of their efficiency. To enhance the efficiency of OLED device a good strategy is to maximize electron-hole recombination using dopants that emit from the triplet excited state. Accordingly, compounds containing heavy transition metals appear at the forefront of chemists, because of the possibility of shifting the theoretical value of efficiency from 25% for only singlet emitters to almost 100% for both singlet and triplet emitters.<br><br>The main objective of this project were syntheses and characterizations of three completely new multifunctional organometallic phosphors based on Iridium and Platinum, which combine both luminescent and charge carrier injection/transport functions in one molecule and therefore are supposed to have high efficiencies and hopefully will be suitable for the industrial use in OLEDs.<br><br>Based on the obtained results it can be said, that the objective of this work was fully completed, since all three synthesized final compounds were prepared in high purity and good overall yield. Also all synthesized substances were prepared in sufficient quantities to their spectral characterization as evidenced by the measured 1H and 13C NMR spectra. <br><br>In my opinion, research in this area will remain interesting for many synthetic organic chemists, since the area of synthesis of new organometallic complexes seems very promising in terms of industrial use of these compounds in OLED applications.

SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF AUAG ALLOY NANOPARTICLES FOR GFP ENHANCEMENT
Daniel Ling
East Greenwich High School, East Greenwich, RI

Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are widely used for their optical sensitivity and convenience. The unique optical properties of AuNPs arise from their surface plasmon resonance (SPR) when interacting with light of various wavelengths in the visible range. We are developing a novel gold and silver composite nanoparticle (AuAg-NP) with tunable optical properties, synthesized by reduction of AgNO3 and HAuCl4 with oleylamine and octadecene as reducing agents. With precise synthesis and modification, we are able to fine-tune the SPR peak of the AuAg-NPs through adjustments in the Au/Ag composition, size, and surface conjugations. By controlling the characteristics of the AuAg-NPs, we study the energy transfer between the AuAg-NPs and other optically active molecules, specifically the green fluorescent protein (GFP). The GFP, known for its distinctive green fluorescence, has extensive use in cellular and molecular imaging. Both the AuAg-NPs and the GFP have similar light-activated properties in the same optical range, allowing for resonant energy transfer. We are investigating ligand addition and silica coating on the AuAg-NPs and studying their effects on the NP-GFP coupling. We have observed a wide range of interactions, including quenching of the GFP fluorescence.

A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE CALCIUM AND MAGNESIUM CONTENTS OF VARYING AGES OF COMPOST
Nicholas Dean Burt
North Quincy High School, Quincy, MA

This research project investigates the relationship between age of yard waste compost and chemical content of the vital nutrients calcium and magnesium. Based on the findings, the optimum time before garden use for maximum calcium and magnesium concentrations may be estimated for compost decomposition. <br><br> Samples from composting (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0 years) were collected, individually bagged, and filtered with distilled water. It was hypothesized that a maximum concentration would be achieved (1.5 years) as a balance between build up from worm castings and the tendency for seepage out of compost during rain. Standard solutions were prepared by dilution of commercial reference solutions (calcium: 1.00, 2.00, 3.00, 4.00, 5.00 ppm; magnesium: 0.20, 0.40, 0.60, 0.80, 1.0 ppm). Concentrations were determined with atomic absorption spectrophotometry, selectively determining absorbance of one metal in the presence of others. Calibration data for calcium yielded a non-linear (parabolic) curve; for magnesium the relation was nearly linear. <br><br> Each sample was measured three times and average concentration (ppm) plotted versus sample collection time (yrs). The highest concentration of both calcium (38.4 ppm) and magnesium (4.9 ppm) occurs at 1.5 years. However, concentrations do not show the smooth pattern hypothesized; the 0.5 yr sample concentrations are greater than expected: Ca 21.3 ppm and Mg 4.3 ppm. Furthermore, a plot of calcium versus magnesium concentrations suggests that they may not be correlated. These results suggest a partially supported hypothesis, indicating optimal compost decomposition at 1.5 years for the type of composted material used in this project.

GAS LEAKAGE PROTECTION SYSTEM (GASPROTECT) IS TO SECURE CONFINED PLACES FROM HAZARDOUS GASES
Iman M.T Qaraqe
Beit-Jala, Bethlehem, PALESTINE

Gas Protect secures confined places that might examine the release of hazardous gases (such as liquefied gas and carbon monoxide). It is a system that is automated by a micro-controller unit (MCU) which acts like a “brain” that “smells” the gas through a gas sensor and then reacts to activate a ventilation system, trigger an alarm, and secure a gas-line. In addition, the MCU can also be programmed to ventilate and refresh the places frequently regardless of gas leakage.<br><br>The idea of this project is to save people’s lives especially with so many accidents are taking places as a result of gas leakage. For example, this year in Bethlehem; four people died of monoxide gas and a teenager died of serious burns because of cooking gas leakage. <br><br>If there is a gas leakage, or increase of carbon monoxide the gas sensor sends a wireless signal to the control system (MCU), which in turn sends a wireless signal to the ventilator. The ventilator then is turned on automatically and starts ventilating out the contaminated air from the area, sends off the alarm, and cuts off the gas line. <br><br>The system is activated when the concentration of gas in the place is 500 PPM. When the level of monoxide reaches 800 PPM, the air becomes fatal. This system sucks out polluted air in badly-ventilated places, like kitchens and bathrooms. <br><br>This system can be developed further; a voice-recorded message option can be added. The idea is that this message is sent to the mobile and telephone when poisonous gases start to leak out. <br><br>This system has been designed also to ventilate confined places automatically with the user’s option of reprogramming system activation.

CONSTRUCTING A NOVEL CAGE MOLECULE FOR USE IN A DYE-SENSITIZED SOLAR CELL
Kerry Nicole Betz
Fairview High School, Boulder, CO

The development of efficient organic dyes for use in dye-sensitized solar cells presents a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to expensive silicon solar cells. This study's goal was to construct an organic molecule for efficient use in a dye-sensitized solar cell. The molecules synthesized consisted of two porphyrin molecules inside a cage framework designed to separate the porphyrin molecules in order to prevent porphyrin aggregation, a factor that has been shown to decrease the efficiency of cells that use these porphyrins. This separation between the porphyrins was constructed in order to increase the number of electrons that are sent to the circuit and therefore increase the efficiency of a solar cell using this cage molecule as the functional dye. The cage molecules constructed were a porphyrin without a cage structure, a two-armed cage molecule using a carbozole and alkyne framwork, a four-armed cage molecule with a carbozole and alkyne framwork, and a four-armed cage molecule using an anthracene and imine bond framwork. The definitve processes for forming each of these novel molecules were found; the four molecules were then characterized and their performances were compared in a dye-sensitized solar cell. Although testing is still in progress, analysis of the absorption spectra revealed increased light harvesting efficiencies of the cage molecules in comparison to the porphyrin monomer. This increased absorption is mainly due to the incorporation of two porphyrins per molecule as opposed to one. The cage framework was also revealed to prevent aggregation of the porphyrins and therefore improve their efficiency in a solar cell, which was the aim of this study. Through the work done in this project, a definitive process forming a cage molecule was developed and refined, and this cage molecule was shown to improve the light harvesting efficiency and decrease the aggregation of functional dyes for a dye-sensitized solar cell.

THE SYNTHESIS OF CELLULOSIC ETHANOL
Christopher Andrew Green
DeKalb High School, Waterloo, IN

The purpose of this experiment was to compare the amount of ethanol obtained from various biomasses. I believed that the sawdust would produce the least amount of ethanol. The straw and hay would produce about the same amount of ethanol. The null hypothesis is that the amount of ethanol produced is independent from the type of the biomass. I used the method, soaking in aqueous ammonia, to strip the lignin from the cell walls. Then I used the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation method to produce ethanol. Cellulose was used as a control and gas chromatography was used to analyze the finished products. I used standards of known concentration of ethanol to produce a regression line to obtain an estimate of the concentration of ethanol in my samples. I then calculated the amount of ethanol produced from each sample. The samples from the hay produced the most ethanol, followed by straw and then sawdust. The averages were 2.85 milliliters, 2.35 milliliters, and 2.26 milliliters, respectively per 10 grams of biomass. The pure cellulose had an average production of 2.33 milliliters per one gram. This data supports the null hypothesis that ethanol production is independent from the type of biomass used as a source.

AN AIR-STABLE LITHIUM ION PORPHYRIN PRECURSOR OF TRANSITION METAL COMPLEXES
Geovic Englis Jadol
Georgia Military College Preparatory School, Milledgeville, GA

I was the first to show that a stable mono-lithium complex, LiTMPyBr83+, could exist in aqueous basic media. Therefore, I proposed that the lithium complex could be used to synthesize the Gd(III) complex under room temperature via metathesis. This metathesis would eliminate the need to heat the mixture and would reduce the reaction times, thereby reducing cost and energy. I propose that other metalloporphyrin complexes could be prepared by the addition metal ion salts at room temperature and under ambient conditions. However, the lithium porphyrin was never been isolated as a solid for study or for use in other applications. Therefore, the purpose of my research was to isolate the lithium porphyrin from solution as a stable solid in air then react it in aqueous media with various transition metals at room temperature.

OPTIMIZATION AND MECHANISTIC INVESTIGATION OF A USER AND ECO-FRIENDLY PROTOCOL FOR OXIDATIVE CLEAVAGE OF ALKENES
Prem P. Thottumkara
Macomb High School, Macomb, IL

A facile and operationally convenient procedure for the oxidative cleavage of alkenes is described. An in-situ generated [hydroxy(4-carboxyphenyl)iodonium]ion formed from the oxidation of 4-iodobenzoic acid with Oxone is shown to be an effective reagent for the oxidative cleavage of a wide range of alkenes in aqueous acetonitrile. Optimization of the reaction conditions using 1-phenyl-1-cyclohexene as the prototypical substrate have shown that the new reaction can be carried out under catalytic conditions using sub-stoichiometric amounts of 4-iodobenzoic acid in presence of Oxone as a stoichiometric co-oxidant. The amount of Oxone needed for quantitative cleavage of substrates depends upon the substrates employed and whether the initially cleaved products are further oxidized. An extensive substrate scope study was undertaken to determine the ease of cleavage of variously substituted alkenes. The procedure was also found to be effective for the cleavage of vicinal diols. Competitive oxidative cleavages of different substrates using the procedure have shown that phenyl-conjugated cyclic alkenes cleave faster than non-phenyl conjugated alkenes and conformationally rigid cyclic cis-diols are preferred over trans-diols as substrates. A mechanism that accounts for observed ease of oxidation of various substrates and the noted Oxone requirement for quantitative cleavage of the different substrates is proposed.

ORGANIC PHOTOVOLTAICS II: ANALYZING AMINO SUBSTITUENT EFFECTS OF PORPHYRINS THROUGH SYNTHESIS, CHARACTERIZATION AND APPLICATION OF NEW (ZN) AMINO/CARBOXYPHENYLPORPHYRINS IN DYE SENSITIZED SOLAR CELLS
Xisen Tian
Columbia River High School, Vancouver, WA

The photovoltaic effect, observed in solar cells, can convert light energy into electricity to help relieve our dependence on environmentally detrimental carbon fuels. However, typical silicon solar cells are wasteful and energy intensive to make resulting in high cost electricity. The Grätzel Cell, a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), has shown potential to replace silicon solar cells. Porphyrin dyes used in DSSCs have shown comparable efficiencies to leading ruthenium dyes which are more expensive to manufacture. The hypothesis proposed was that amino groups in porphyrins would be detrimental to DSSC efficiency due to their inhibition of the redox process in the electrolyte solution which was observed for ruthenium dyes. This experiment investigates the effects of the aminophenyl groups in porphyrin dyes on DSSC performance by comparing DSSC efficiencies from amino/carboxyphenyl porphyrins (TAxCyPP), their deaminated and metalated analogues. The TCyPPs were synthesized using a modified Adler-Longo reaction, while TAxCyPPs were synthesized using prescribed procedures. They were all metalated subsequently and characterized using thin-layer and column chromatography and UV-spectroscopy. DSSC performance was measured by varying the electrical potential and measuring the current produced along with graphical analysis. Results showed that porphyrins with 3 amino groups performed nearly the same as the porphyrins without amino groups (0.07% vs. 0.08% efficiency). Also, the metalated porphyrins with 3 amino groups outperformed the deaminated metalated porphyrins (0.54% vs .09% efficiency). Thus, the results didn’t support my hypothesis but instead suggested that any negative effects caused by the amino groups were overcome by its electron donating properties.

SEAWEED + TAPIOCA = VEGETARIAN JELL-O?
Garima Yadav
Sachem High School North, Lake Ronkonkoma, NY

Gelatin is a substance derived from collagen, which is a natural protein obtained by boiling the tendons, ligaments, and tissues of mammals. Due to religious and dietary restrictions on the consumption and use of animal products, gelatin-based products are unavailable for part of the global population. The purpose of this study was to create a vegetarian gel substitute (Jell-O) for collagen-based gelatin using only natural plant-based ingredients. The product was created by experimentation with various ratios of seaweed (Laminaria digitata [sugar kelp], Gelidium amansii [agar]), and tapioca (Manihot esculenta) because these substances act as thickening agents. A bioassay to determine the toxicity of the prepared vegetarian Jell-O was conducted, as was a test to determine moisture content, protein concentration, and calories. It was hypothesized that by using a combination of sugar kelp, tapioca, and agar, a healthy, organic vegetarian Jell-O could be created to replicate the texture (jiggliness) and “melt-in-the-mouth” characteristic. It was found that the product had an average moisture content of 88.28% ± 0.0021. The bioassay, performed with Daphnia magna, revealed that the product was not toxic at all, which is supported by the statistically insignificant p-value of 0.601. To determine the protein concentration, the Nanodrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer was used. The results indicated an average concentration of 5.025 ± 0.883 mg/mL. A calorimeter test to determine total calories showed that the product had an average of 62.97 ± 0.14 calories which is considerably lower than the 80 calories present in the marketed Jell-O®.

REVOLUTION OF HOUSEHOLD QUANTITATIVE FOOD TESTING - 'NITRANALYZER'
Chun So
La Salle College, Hong Kong, HONG KONG

This research aims at finding a quick, simple and cheap domestic quantitative testing method for nitrite and nitrate in food. Food contributes 45-90% daily nitrate intake,which is much higher than from water. If we consume food containing high nitrite/nitrate like the people in China Gansu, it would cause cyanosis or even death.<br><br> The nitrite/nitrate in food is extracted by water with SDS. The principle of this test kit is to detect gas liberated from nitrite/nitrate after addition of special reagents.<br><br> (I) For nitrite, solid hydrogen sulphate/sulphate buffer is added.<br><br> H+ +NO2- -->HNO2<br><br> 2HNO2-->NO+ HNO3(decomposition in room temp.)<br><br> 2H+ +2NO+ 2I- -->N2O+H2O+ I2<br><br> Nitrite level is determined by comparing amount of iodine formed quantitatively on KI-starch paper with calibrated standard colour chart provided.<br><br> (II) For nitrate, sodium hydroxide/aluminium is added.<br><br> 3NO3- +8Al+5OH- +18H2O-->3NH3+ 8[Al(OH)4]-<br><br> NH3+H2O<==>NH4+ +OH-<br><br> Nitrate level is determined by comparing amount of hydroxide formed quantitatively on narrow range pH paper with calibrated standard colour chart.<br><br> This new method can be used on meat, vegetables, milk products and baby foods.<br><br> Unlike the tradition standard testing methods such as the Griess Reaction(Azo dye formation), cadmium reduction or UV-IC method, our method does not involve any toxic chemicals, expensive equipments, time consuming sample treatment, long operation time and prerequisite knowledge. This method is exceptionally accurate, its reliability and sensitivty has been confirmed by the Flow Injection Analysis. It costs USD 0.1 per test only.<br><br> I believe my testing kit will be available soon for household, food inspection unit and food production company to prevent nitrite/nitrate poisoning happening again.

FROM DUSK TO DAWN: CONTACT LENSES IN THE NIGHT TEAR PROTEOME
Jack Huang
Parkland High School, Allentown, PA

For the millions of nearsighted individuals in the United States and billions more around the globe, overnight orthokeratology presents an effective, convenient alternative to daytime corrective lenses. Through using a rigid contact lens to reshape the cornea at night, orthokeratology provides patients clear daytime vision without corrective eyewear, and also helps curb myopia progression in youth. A key concern with these lenses, however, is protein interaction, which has not been well studied in the unique night tear proteome. This project presents a novel investigation into how tear proteins interact with both orthokeratology and more widespread silicone hydrogel contact lenses in the closed-eye ocular environment.<br><br>Lenses were placed in protein solution to simulate overnight wear, then adsorbed proteins extracted. Proteins were separated via reversed-phase HPLC, characterized using mass spectrometry, and quantified by UV detection. Samples were also analyzed through SDS-PAGE and densitometry.<br><br>Contrary to original expectations, the hard orthokeratology lenses actually adsorbed more protein than soft silicone hydrogels. The two lens groups also bound significantly different ratios of specific proteins, with orthokeratology preferring more hydrophobic and silicone hydrogels more hydrophilic molecules.<br><br>This project reveals that though hard lenses are generally accepted to adsorb less protein than soft, a vastly different scenario unfolds at night. Closed-eye tear proteins interact readily with orthokeratology contacts, binding in distinct patterns to specific lens types. For doctors and patients, this study highlights hazards of extended wear and underscores the importance of careful disinfection, while identifying directions for research into improved lens design.

HEAT ACCELERATED COOLING: A STUDY ON COOLING MATERIALS WITH LIQUID NITROGEN
Akihito Ohyama
Yachiyo-Shoin High School, Yachiyo, Chiba, JAPAN

When an object at room temperatures isimmersed in liquid nitrogen (LN), vigorous bubbling originates at the object’s surface because of LN boiling off. I discovered an interesting phenomenon, which I call “re-boiling.” In my experiment, boiling gradually diminished as the number of bubbles decreased; however, a sudden surge of boiling recurred just before boiling ceased. To elucidate the mechanism, I determined the kinetics ofweight change of LN using an electronic balance and video recording. Re-boiling is characterized by a sudden decrease in weight of LN. I tested 20 diverse material typesofdiffering shapes and weights, and found that re-boiling occurs only when materials of high thermal conductivity were used. Furthermore, the time when re-boiling occurred depended on the material’s surface area.Videos revealed that a film-likestructure formed by bubbles covered the surface, and it attenuated boiling by insulating the immersedmaterialfrom LN. As the boiling calmed down, the film disintegratedresulting in re-boiling. I hypothesized that temperature uniformity along the surface resulting from high thermal conductivity creates the film by uniformly generating bubbles. Conversely, in poorly conducting materials, uneven temperature distribution prevents the surface from forming the bubble film. To test this hypothesis, I conducted anexperiment designed tobreak the film with a heating wire, and found that boiling accelerated when film formation was prevented by non-uniform heating. I tested my hypothesis further by monitoring temperatures during the process.

COLD PACK CHEMISTRY

The purpose of my project was to determine how the temperature of a mixture of water and ammonium chloride and ammonium nitrate changes with the amount of ammonium chloride and ammonium nitrate dissolved in the water. My hypothesis was that the ammonium nitrate will produce more heat loss than ammonium chloride. First I made distilled and put it into 5 cups labeled 1-5. Next I put 100mL of distilled water to each of the 5 cups. After that I covered my work surface with newspaper and put on latex gloves and safety goggles. I took out the ammonium chloride from the bag and measured out 10 grams. I then put the 10 grams into the distilled water and recorded how much the temperature dropped ever 15 seconds. After the temperature had stopped dropping completely, I stopped recording the temperature. Then I added 20, 30, 40, and 50 grams of ammonium chloride to my water. I did this trial 3 times to ensure that my work was correct and accurate. After I did 3 trials with ammonium chloride, I used ammonium nitrate. Once again I preformed 3 trails with ammonium nitrate. In conclusion, ammonium nitrate cooled the water faster and dropped the temperature more than ammonium chloride. More heat energy was lost as I added more ammonium nitrate than ammonium chloride.

ASYMMETRIC TOTAL SYNTHESIS OF GLAXOSMITHKLINE'S POTENT PHOSPHODIESTERASE INHIBITOR
Yaroslav Dmitrievich Boyko
Moscow Chemical Lyceum 1303, Moscow, RUSSIA

Inhibitors of phosphodiesterase PDE IVb is considered as promising drugs for treatment diseases of the central nervous system (depression, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease). Pyrrolizidinone Glaxo-1, proposed by company GlaxoSmithKline, is inhibitor PDE IVb (IC50 = 63 nM), more activity, then famous drug Rolipram. But activity of the Glaxo-1 studied on a racemic product, because approach on asymmetric synthesis doesn’t exist. However, only one optical isomer of this product has necessary biological activity.<br><br>It’s the first time we proposed a strategy of the asymmetric synthesis Glaxo-1. We used available input materials: nitro ethane, isovanilin and chiral trans-2-phenilcyclohexanol. A key stage – [4+2]-cycloaddition nitro olefin, derivative of isovanilin, to optical activity vinyl ether of phenilcyclohexanol. The result of this stage is 1 of the 4 diastereomers chiral nitronate. Further, resulting nitronate subject to silylation and interact with dimethylmalonate potassium. In this case dihydrooxazines arise. Reduction and removal of a CO2Me group lead to Glaxo-1 and regeneration of a phenilcyclohexanol. So, we received both enantiomers (+) and (-)-Glaxo-1 with yield 16%.

DRUG SYNTHESIS: BRAVING LEGENDARY CHALLENGES
Raghavendra Ramachanderan
St. John's International Residential School, Chennai, INDIA

Drug synthesis is the most challenging field for the organic chemists because of its most tedious synthetic route. My project deals with the synthesis of three such molecules, all of them, may be a challenge.<br><br>Firstly, a ‘glycoheterocycle’ which has an ‘active’ core caged by carbohydrates. The challenge lies in working with carbohydrates. The implication of this molecule is that it is a potential drug. The synthesis of this molecule provides a concise path for creating other<br><br>molecules as well which can be screened.<br><br>The second is the route to taxoids, which are a set of molecules that have unbelievably high medicinal properties against tumor cells. The challenge which still yearns easy methodology, is of construction of its ‘6, 8 framework’ which is being tackled. My project applies powerful<br><br>transforms to make this framework, with positive results. The work can be extensively applied in the synthesis of taxoids, where the framework is no more a challenge.<br><br>The final challenge is in making a 4th generation β-lactam Cephalosporin antibiotic, which is considered man’s defenses against bacteria. Cefepime, one such antibiotic is being synthesized. The key points of this synthesis are that it is reasonably eco-friendly, it could be scaled, concise and can be adopted in the synthesis of other β-lactam antibiotics as well, making up the largest set in the antibiotic-drug industry.

SYNTHESIZING TASK-SPECIFIC METHYLIMIDAZOLE-BASED IONIC LIQUIDS
Uchenna Fredoline Anunobi
Rockdale Magnet School for Science and Technology, Conyers, GA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effects of changing the side chains of ionic liquids on their properties. To synthesize the ionic liquids, first the methylimidazole backbone, side chain component, and anion were mixed and heated for 3 hours and 30 minutes. Then it was cleaned using dH2O. Lastly it was air dried under a fume hood. Based on the data, the melting point of ionic liquids decreases as the side chain length increases. There was a significant difference in melting points of the test groups. The melting points of the bromobutane and bromohexadecane were significantly different when compared to each other and to the other three ionic liquid side chains (1-bromo-2-methylpropane, bromooctodecane, and docusate salt) (4586.06, 4,p<0.05). The nontoxic anion, docusate sodium salt, was significantly different from the two toxic anions, tetrafluroborate and hexafluorophosphate(300.66, 2, p<0.05). Based on the significance level, the research hypothesis was supported. The Null hypothesis stated that there would be no significant difference between the test groups’ the chemical and physical properties; thus it was rejected. All ionic liquids produced in this experiment were below room temperature. Because they have very low melting points, Ionic liquids can store energy that is generated from CSPs (concentrated solar power) without turning into a solid, which would cause energy loss. The previous CSP heat transfer liquids are substances like sodium salt that have very high melting points, 800 C, so they turn into solids relatively fast when they are stored. Thus it is suggested that ionic liquids be used in CSPs to make the systems more efficient. The ionic liquids created were'not cellulose soluble; inferred that not all ILS are cellulose-soluble.

SYNTHESIS AND MANIPULATION OF SILVER AND GOLD NANO-MIRRORS
Michael Leonard Janner
Redlands East Valley High School, Redlands, CA

Reflective nanoplates, or nano-mirrors, have shown to be good candidates for applications such as liquid mirrors in astronomical telescopes and adaptive optics, but currently no reliable method of controlling these nanoplates exists. The objective of this experiment is to synthesize silver and gold nano-mirrors and manipulate their orientation using an external magnetic field.<br><br>Silver and gold nanoplates were synthesized in chemical reduction reactions using silver nitrate as a silver source and chloroauric acid as a gold source. Silver nanoplates were synthesized with spectral peaks ranging from below 400 nm to over 1000 nm, signifying average edge lengths of 20-30 nm. A seeded growth process was used to increase the edge lengths of the silver nanoplates to 2-3 µm. The gold nanoplates were synthesized with average edge lengths of 5-6 µm, which was large enough to manipulate without increasing the aspect ratio. In order to control the orientation of the nanoplates, they were injected into ferrofluid, a solution of iron oxide nanocrystals. This caused them to act as magnetic holes and allowed their orientation in the solution to be controlled using an external magnetic field.<br><br>Due to the large aspect ratio of the nanoplates, the base facets of the nanoplates reflected much more light than the depth facets, giving the nano-mirrors distinguishable “on” and “off” states. Therefore, once the orientation of the nanoplates could be manipulated using an external magnetic field, the nano-mirrors could be turned on and off by controlling which facet of the nanoplates was visible.

Currently, much attention has been focused on the production of chiral alcohols. It is now widely needed by medicine synthesising factories. Chiral alcohols are the base materials used to synthesis medicines. Although there are many types of medicines can be synthesised by chiral alcohols, but usually it is used to synthesis ARB (Angiotensin Receptor Blocker),a heart disease medicine. It will stabilize heartbeats and reduce hypertension. Aspergillus niger, a kind of fungus was used for the biotransformation of ketone to chiral alcohol instead using enzymes which is the catalyst used in industries. This experiment was conducted experiment to study the relationship between size of globules and agitation speed(rpm). Besides that, the kinetics growth of cells were studied during biotransformation and to optimize the conditions of aspergillus niger growth and biotransformation in a bioreactor. <br><br>To optimize the biotransformation, two experiments were conducted to know the suitable biotransformation time and agitation speed needed for the growth of aspergillus niger. Then, the biotransformation of ketone to chiral alcohol was carried out in a bioreactor machine. Results of chiral alcohol obtained is tested in a HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) machine.<br><br>The suitable biotransformation time is 48 hours with the dry weight is 0.893 gram and suitable agitation speed is 200 rpm with the diameter of globules is 0.38 cm. Yields and percentage of enantiomeric excess of chiral alcohol is the best at 32nd hour which is 63.7% and 85.93% respectively.<br><br>The higher the speed of reciprocator machine, the smaller the size of globules obtained in this experiment. Besides that, 48 hours is the best time for the biotransformation and aspergillus niger is the best catalyst.

More than one million people die from mosquito-borne diseases every year. In Africa alone, a child dies from malaria every 45 seconds. The Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes are considered medically important pests that are the primary vectors for transmission of dengue and yellow fever and malaria, respectively. They are threats to the general public and also to the military as many deployed personnel are severely affected by the diseases transmitted by these mosquitoes. <br><br>Bed bugs are a nuisance in many parts of the world and a growing problem in the US. In the past few years, bed bug reports have risen more than 500%. Many hotels have bedbug infestations, and some species of bed bugs have developed resistance to insecticides. <br><br>Termites cause over one billion dollars annually in economic loss to the US, especially in Post-Katrina Gulf Coast regions. Some insecticides against pests have been banned due to human health concerns. Recently, DEET, a common repellent, has been reported to be neurotoxic. Therefore, there is need to develop safe and environmentally friendly insecticides. Natural products offer diverse classes of compounds with varying modes of action. In this project, several natural products that have acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity towards mosquitoes and termites have been isolated, indentified, synthesized, and tested against insect homogenates. These compounds have also shown insecticidal activity towards bed bugs as well. Some compounds have shown selectivity towards certain species of mosquitoes and termites. Other compounds showed selectivity towards human and insect acetylcholinesterase enzymes as well.

CARBON NANOTUBE SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION
Neerja Aggarwal
L.V. Hightower High School, Missouri City, TX

Carbon nanotubes possess high mechanical strength with low density and varying electronic properties. Nanotubes range from metallic to semiconducting depending on their chirality; this is determined at the atomic level based on the crystal structure of the nanotubes. Type-specific synthesis of multi-walled carbon nanotubes was investigated with respect to industrial output of product.<br><br> Chemical vapor deposition [700 °C] was used to execute a parametric study of ferrocene concentration in toluene and reaction time-scales. Samples were analyzed using thermogravimetric analysis, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. <br><br> Optimal conditions for product with high purity and yield were found at slow injection rate [1 mL/hr] and low concentration [5 wt % ferrocene in toluene]. Conversely, at higher concentration [13 wt %] and faster injection [3 mL/hr] other carbon materials such as graphite and iron carbides were present.<br><br> The results suggest optimal growth conditions are obtained by balancing the concentration of the precursor with the flow rate of the gas [5 % H2/Ar]. Hydrogen is responsible for reduction and activation of the iron catalyst that decomposes the carbon source and forms nanotubes. Effectively, balancing the partial pressure of the hydrogen to that of the carbon source renders selective and quantitative growth of nanotubes. Excess of carbon produces other carbon products. <br><br> The impact of this research supports that industrial scale output of nanotubes for a solar cell industry could be achieved by optimization of parameters at ambient pressure conditions.

KINETIC ANALYSIS OF NANOMETALLIC CATALYST IN REDUCTION OF NITROPHENOL: INVESTIGATION OF A NEW CLASS OF "SUPER CATALYST"
Quoc-Bao Duy Nguyen, Mai-Anh Vu, 
Westwood High School and McNeil High School, Austin, TX

Heterogeneous catalysts composed of Pd, Au, or Pt are of great interest in pharmaceutical industries due to their superior stability, reusability, and improved catalytic properties over homogenous catalysts. However, they lack large surface area. We investigated a new class of “super catalysts” fabricated using the innovative dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticle (DEN) synthesis. DEN catalysts are soluble and monodispersed, which results in tremendous amount of surface area. Our study characterized how size, composition, and structure of palladium and alloy DEN catalyze the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) to 4-aminophenol. Kinetic rate was measured using a spectrophotometer technique. Our results show Kinetic rate=k[4-NP][NaBH4] where k is proportional to [Pd-DEN]. 4-NP reduction takes place at the nanoparticle surface, and thus, kinetic rate is dictated by the catalyst’s total surface area. Nanoparticle size strongly impacts the reaction rate. The optimal size for best kinetic rate is at least 60 atoms, while below 25 atoms, the nanocatalyst loses 3X in “efficiency”. Palladium-copper DEN using co-complex and sequential method exhibits enhanced catalytic power over pure Pd and Cu DEN, with Cu10Pd20 DEN displaying 4X over Pd30 DEN and 32,000X over Cu30 DEN. Structurally, uniform alloy demonstrates better performance at lower Pd composition over the shell structures of either (Pd)core(Cu)shell or (Cu)core(Pd)shell. Finally, we have formulated a roadmap to engineer DEN catalysts to enhance 1,000,000X over a heterogeneous catalyst. Because of its unique properties of both a heterogeneous and homogenous catalyst, and because it is easily filterable, DEN has tremendous potential to replace homogeneous catalysts in fine chemical manufacturing.

INVESTIGATION OF RAIN-X® AND SUNSCREEN MIXTURE, YEAR 4: EFFECT OF POLYMER COATED TITANIUM DIOXIDE ON UVA TRANSMISSION AND PHOTOCATALYTIC ACTIVITY
Derek Robert Lam, Brigette Lee, 
Keystone School, San Antonio, TX

Years 1 and 2 projects showed that sunscreen and Rain-X® mixtures were effective in blocking UVA. Last year’s project showed that the mixture containing nanosized titanium dioxide (TiO2), a photocatalyst, produced more reactive oxygen species in vitro, but not in vivo. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether modified TiO2 could reduce the extent of photocatalytic activity while maintaining UVA-blocking effectiveness. The extent of electron emission and DNA damage was evaluated.<br><br>The two test groups were labeled 1) Mixtures (Rain-X®, sunscreen, and TiO2) and 2) TiO2 only. Three types of TiO2 were used in each group: uncoated (UC), commercially coated (CC) and polymer coated (PC) TiO2. PC TiO2 was prepared. Its photocatalytic activity was tested and compared to CC and UC TiO2 using DPPH absorbance readings. UV-sensitive yeast was used for all six groups to determine UVA-blocking effectiveness. Phloxine B was used to evaluate the extent of electron emission and potential DNA damage was determined using gel electrophoresis.<br><br>UC TiO2 produced a statistically significant decrease in absorbance (23.6%, p < 0.02) compared to DPPH alone while PC TiO2 had lower photocatalytic activity (5.1% decrease). PC mixture had a minimal change in electron emission after UVA exposure while also maintaining UVA-blocking effectiveness with a yeast survival rate of 82.8%. Therefore, the coating reduced the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 and did not affect its UVA-blocking effectiveness. However, DNA damage was observed with the PC TiO2 alone and in the mixture. Additional biological tests may be necessary to confirm these results.

AN EXPANDED POLYSTYRENE-BASED ION-EXCHANGE RESIN AND ANALYSIS OF ITS RETENTION OF HEAVY-METAL IONS
Carlos Henrique Leite da Silva, Paolo Damas Pulcini, Amanda De La Rocque Rodrigues
Escola Tecnica Getulio Vargas, Sao Paulo, BRASIL

Styrofoam (expanded polystyrene) is a polymeric substance widely used worldwide. The disposal of this material is a controversial subject and its recycling utilizing conventional methods still almost unexplored. Water contamination by both, organic or inorganic species is a serious problem, once affects the entire ecosystem. Between these contaminants, heavy metals still one of the greatest problems, once opposite to the majority of the organic species, aren’t decomposed. In this project, we have improved the reaction conditions previously described (the transformation of Styrofoam in an ion exchanging resin by sulfonating it in homogeneous medium) using design experiment. The variables studied were the amount of the sulfonating agent, the temperature of the reaction and the resulting Ion Exchange Capacity (IEC). The performance of the synthesized resins was evaluated by its IEC, which was determined by reverse potentiometric titration method. Additionally was tested the retention of ionic heavy metals (such as copper, cadmium and nickel) using atomic absorption spectrometry. The best condition was chose considering the relation between the most favorable ion exchange condition attained versus the smaller consume of reagents and energy. The retention of heavy metals of the synthesized resins showed a satisfactory efficiency. The results allow us to conclude that the product can be utilized in water treatment. Furthermore, the new resin can also be utilized as ion exchange resins, for a variety of applications. To conclude, it is important to highlight that our project contributes to remove Styrofoam from the environment and it is attractive for industrial applications.

Mengdi Su, Hanqing Xu, 
Hubei Wuchang Experimental High School, Wuhan, Hubei, CHINA

Bisphenol A (BPA) is widely used in food packagings. While it is harmful to our health. This paper studied the preparation of CdSe quantum dots (QDs) coated with sodium dimercaptosulphonate. The changes of UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence emission spectra of BPA on CdSe QDs were also investigated. The CdSe QDs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and infrared spectroscopy (IR). Based on the characteristic fluorescence enhance of the CdSe QDs by BPA, a simple, rapid, sensitive and selective quantification method was established. The effects of soaking time and temperature, reused times and modeling solutions on the release of BPA were studied. The results showed that the morphology of the CdSe crystal was round with a particle size of 4-5 mm. The optimal refluxing time was 40 min and the pH value was 9-10. The PL intensity was stable when the stabilized time was from 2 to 15 min. The highest concentrations of BPA in paper cups were observed at soaking time 6-8 h and temperature of 75-95 °C. While it was stable with the increase of the reuse times. Iso-octane significantly promoted the release of BPA, followed by 3% acetic acid solution and water. Quantitative detection of BPA ranging from 4 × 10(-9) to 4.5 × 10(-7) mol/L with a low detection limit of 1.5×10(-9) mol/L and an excellent correlation coefficient of 0.998 were achieved. The present method has first been applied for the detection of BPA in PC and paper cups.

AN INVESTIGATION TO FIND OUT THE MOST EFFECTIVE REPELLENT TO CONTROL COCKROACHES (PERIPLANETA AMERICANA) USING DIFFERENT PLANT EXTRACTIVES
H.M. Niradha Buddhini Subasinghe, H.M.N. Sachintha Subasinghe, 
Government Science College, Matale, Central, SRI LANKA

Cockroach (Periplaneta americana), is one of the most commonly found house-hold insect pest in the world. Synthetic insecticides widely used to control them pose a risk to human as well as the environment. Environmentally friendly, natural insect repellents of plant origin to replace these insecticides would be a best practical solution to minimize hazards related to insecticides. This experiment was carried out to identify the plant extracts which effectively repel the cockroaches. <br><br>The hypothesis tested was “whether the herbs used as spices can effectively repel the cockroaches”.<br><br>Different parts (leaf, flower, bark etc.) of 14 selected herbs were used in this study. The extracts were prepared by grinding 5g of the plant parts with 2.5ml of distilled water. 1.5 inches wide ‘Y’ shaped tunnel, cut in to a polystyrene board was the main apparatus. The lower end of the tunnel was used to introduce the insects and the upper ends were used to place the plant extracts and the control. Cockroaches were set free into the tunnel and observed their movement i.e. towards or away from the extract. Response of the same insect for 10 introductions of each extract recorded. This procedure was repeated for 10 different cockroaches.<br><br>Observations with a single insect showed that the repellent activity for leaf extracts of Margosa (Neem) and Java Citronella was very high compared to all other extracts. The experiment with multiple insects revealed that Betel, Java Citronella and Margosa (Neem) had repellent rates of 90%, 80% and 66% respectively. <br><br>In conclusion, the experiment showed out of 14 different plant extracts tested, Betel and Java Citronella leaf extracts could be used effectively as a house-hold insect repellent to control cockroaches.

THE SYNTHESIS AND SIZE REDUCTION OF DISPERSED AGGREGATES OF MOLYBDENUM OXIDE NANOPARTICLES FOR USE IN LONG CHAIN HYDROCARBON CRACKING 
Brielle Woolsey, Natalia Anderton, 
Springville High School, Springville, UT

We have developed a novel method for making a homogenous high surface area catalyst for use in petroleum hydrocarbon cracking. Crude oil with heavy hydrocarbons and undesirable sulfur content must be broken down with catalysts into useable oil with smaller hydrocarbons. We synthesized nanoparticle MoO3 as a precursor to the hydrocracking catalyst by adapting a process patented by Cosmas Inc. Our MoO3 nanoparticles have small sizes (20-30 nm), high surface areas, and tight size distributions that are unmatched in the professional nano-chemical field. We sonicated (5 minutes) and milled (1.5-2 hours with 1.5 µm beads and then 3-4 hours with 0.1 µm beads) our nanoparticles to attain a translucent suspension in acidified aqueous solution. Large aggregates were broken, aiding a more uniform distribution of the particles. The high surface area, and thus high catalytic activity, of our suspended MoO3 nanoparticles will greatly economize petroleum refining once they are sulfurized because of the low percent yield (30-60%) of the MoO3 reaction and inflating expense of bulk hydrotreating catalysts. We are currently performing further experimentation to discover a method to sulfurize the MoO3 and disperse the nanoparticle MoS2 in a non-polarized organic solvent. Our economic, green, and simple production of dispersed high surface area nanoparticle MoS2 will be a significant advancement in the petroleum refining industry as a long chain hydrocarbon cracking catalyst.

NO MORE CRYIN' OVER ONIONS! A COMPARISON BETWEEN CONVENTIONAL VS. ORGANIC ONIONS AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF PHENOLICS IN ONIONS
Kulsoom Fatima Naqvi, Zurana Alam Taluckder, 
Eleanor Roosevelt High School, Greenbelt, MD

This project was designed to determine if a significant difference existed between the phenolic antioxidant levels in conventionally versus organically grown Allium cepa, and between the layers of the onion. If onions produce phenolics as a defense mechanism, then conventional onions, treated with pesticides, should produce less phenolics than organic onions. Concurrently, the outermost onion layer, most susceptible to infection, should produce the most phenolic antioxidants. Onion samples were peeled, separated, lyophilized, ground, and stored below -70ºC. For the first evaluation, the pulp and skin were separated. For the second evaluation, top dry skin, top two edible layers, next two edible layers, and inner core were examined. Phenolics from the onion samples (250mg) were extracted for 3 cycles, 5 minutes each, with an Accelerated Solvent Extractor using a 50:50 methanol:water solution heated at 100°C under 1000 psi at a 60% flush volume.<br><br>Extracts were transferred into a 25 mL volumetric flask, adjusted to 25 mL, filtered, and analyzed via High Performance Liquid Chromatography for identification and quantification, and via SpectraMax Plate Reader for antioxidant activity.<br><br>The t-test with a p-value of 0.257 indicated no significant statistical difference between the phenolic content of organic and conventional onions. The ANOVA test with a p-value of 1.7492E-18 indicated a significant difference between the phenolic content in the onion layers, suggesting uneven distribution of phenolics. Also, the dry outer skin, often discarded as waste, contained over 60% of the phenolic compounds with a gradual decrease in phenolics in each subsequent layer towards the core.

THE STUDY OF CORRELATION BETWEEN ACTIVITY AND MICROSTRUCTURE FOR PLATINUM NANOPARTICLE-BASED CATALYSTS
Alexander Sergeevich Goloveshkin, Alexander Alexandrovich Ulyanovskiy, 
Moscow Chemical Lyseum, Moscow, RUSSIA

The platinum nanoparticles are an efficient alternative to bulk metal in many applications where platinum is involved as a catalyst, as they naturally feature much higher specific surface, allowing for dramatic decreases in required load of costly metal.<br><br>The efficiency of a catalyst based on platinum nanoparticles is mostly defined by their microstucture (i.e., shape and size distribution). While a decrease of the average particle size usually leads to an increase in activity, the efficiency of the catalyst can be affected by additional factors, the most important being the nanoparticle-substrate interaction, as the platinum nanoparticles need to be immobilized on a substrate to improve they stability for any actual use.<br><br>This project is devoted to study of two distinct platinum nanoparticle-based catalysts, each actually being series of samples differing by the particle size: in one of them, the nanoparticles were attached to carbon nanofibers for use as cathode in fuel cells, and the other one employed aluminum oxide as a substrate and was designed for industrial hydrogenation processes. <br><br>Our work involved experimental measurement of the activity of a catalyst in the process of benzene hydrogenation and the study of the catalysts by means of powder X-ray diffraction. The application of a recently developed (and still novel) Whole Powder Pattern Modeling approach to the case of platinum particles on carbon nanofiber was required to obtain reasonable results from PXRD studies and allowed explaining the significant differences in relative electrochemical activity of particles which were considered similar according to electron microscopy data.

STANDARDIZATION AND USE OF "FILTER SULFITOMETER" FOR RAPID DETECTION OF SULFITES ON FISH
Angela Di Gianni, Giovanna Calcada Tanniguchi, Gabriela Ono
Colegio Jean Piaget, Santos, SP, BRASIL

According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in 2010 about 15% of the proteins eaten worldwide came from fish. The Brazilian Legislation does not allow the use of Sodium Sulfite as a preservative for fresh meat such as fish. Not only can this additive preserve the meat, but it can also make fish in degraded conditions appear to be fresh.<br><br> Numerous methods and techniques are used to preserve fish, among them synthetic additives that are low cost and increase food conservation. More than 4000 additives are used to confuse senses, change textures and improve industrial processing performance. Among the additives, what struck us most were the sulfites, which have antioxidant properties, acting also as bactericide and fungicide, inhibiting the oxidation process associated with deterioration. Their use in fish and derivatives showed that 1% of consumers are sensitive to their presence and can develop diseases such as urticaria, flushing, nausea, diarrhea, asthma, and even anaphylactic shock.<br><br> Several methods exist for quantitative detection of sulfites in matrices (food and beverages), which are relatively expensive and time consuming. Therefore we developed a more agile and practical method to identify fish impregnated with Sodium Sulfite the “Filter Sulfitometer”.<br><br> To do so we adapted a technique qualitatively described by the Adolfo Lutz Institute (1998), using 0.5 mL solution of green malachite, 0.02% in 3.5 grams of fish sample for 1 to 2 minutes. We tested on fish with and without scales. We compared two fish sources and verified the presence of sulfite in one of fish origins’. When the fish is impregnated with sulfite, the malachite green solution presents bleaching, otherwise the malachite green solution color remains.

Advances in nanotechnology have given birth to new classes of materials. These developed nanoparticles could provide a high surface area, and so it has great potential to be used in catalysis. The objective of the present work was to prepare eligible nanoparticles as a step forward to investigate its use as catalyst for some chemical reactions. The nanoparticles were prepared by mixing 100 mL ethanol, 100 mL ammonia, and 8 mL TEOS and heated for 60 min. After cycles of washings with organic solvents, the developed deposits incubated with ethanol in the Ultrasonic equipment until homogeneous dispersion of the nanoparticles. The nanomaterial is heated to 300 C to evaporate ammonia complex, and allow Cupper ions adherence with nanoparticles. The nanoparticles was checked with different microscopes. The electronic microscope, and ferromagnetic electronic microscope showed that roundness working particles were developed, and its size was about 100 nm. The nanoparticles were successfully coated with Cupper ions, this was confirmed through particles color change from white to reddish-blue. E-Dax equipment confirmed coating of developed nanoparticles with cupper ions. The Nano particles was developed successfully, and coated with cupper ions. These particles could be used to perform several experiments to investigate its use as catalyst of some chemical reactions such as hydrogenation. Large-scale preparation of the nanoparticles for use in many experiments. Further investigation of the effect of some factors like pressure and temperature on the final products will be performed.

A STUDY ON THE PHOTO-CATALYTIC DISINFECTANT EFFECT OF SUBSTRATE-EMBEDDED, ANNEALED, AND ANODIZED TIO2 THIN FILMS ON E. COLI
Vipul Tushar Vachharajani, Pranav Haravu,

Waterborne diarrheal disease is a widespread global health issue, and novel methods of disinfection are needed to improve prevention. Photo-catalytic disinfection using titanium dioxide thin-films exposed to sunlight is a potential solution to this problem. Evaluation of photo-catalytic killing of bacteria for various substrates has been studied extensively; however, few comparative studies exist comparing the relative abilities of different methods of film production. We have compared the photo-catalytic disinfectant effect of an inexpensive novel substrate-embedded film, to annealed and anodized films on Escherichia coli K-12 bacteria.<br><br>To prepare the novel films, we embedded anatase TiO¬¬2 in Lexan. A suspension of Escherichia coli (E. coli) in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium was prepared. Each substrate along with a measured amount of suspension was placed into an airtight tube. The tubes were exposed to fluorescent light in a sterile hood. Bacterial concentration of solutions exposed to the substrates was compared using optical density (OD) measurements in each tube before and after exposure to the substrate. In a second test, a viable bacterial count method was used to determine viable bacterial concentration.<br><br>The anodized substrate consistently demonstrated a significant photo-catalytic disinfectant effect, while the annealed substrate did not demonstrate a significant effect. The bacterial count data provided support for a positive correlation between anodized film thickness and photo-catalytic disinfection. Our novel method, when initially compared to the anodized films, demonstrated significant photo-catalytic disinfection, confirmed in our second test for viable bacteria.

We recognized that Fe is the most suitable to prepare silver nanopartcles by measurement activation polarization among the other metal(Ni, Cu, Zn). Because they make passive film. So, we recognize that if we heat the solution, we can make silver nanopaticles using this phenomenon.<br><br>2. We calculated activation energy of Fe(s) with AgNO3(aq) chemical reaction. And we observed that the color of solution it turn turned into colorless, yellow, and black. It was because of surface plasmon of silver nanoparticles' feature. And we analyzed the sample by EDS analysis using scanning electron microscope. So, we recognized that it was silver nanoparticles. <br><br>Also, we found the most condition which makes silver nanoparticles well. As a result, we can see that if we provided high temperature long time, we can make many effective silver nanoparticles.<br><br> Especially, we used various surfactant to reduce its size, Polysorbate 80 is the most efficient among the other surfactant(Polysorbate 60, Polysorbate 80, PVP-360, SLS) with treat supersonic.<br><br>3. When we analyzed by particle size analyzer silver nanoparticles, its standard deviation was big. So, we tested adsorption experimentation using SBA-15 to reduce the standard deviation. Because SBA-15's pore is 8nm generally, less than 8nm among the silver nanoparticles absorb to SBA-15. So, we could separate using filtering.

THE EFFECT OF POPCORN: NEW METHOD OF HIGHLY DISPERSIVE POWDERS OBTAINING BY MICROWAVE TREATMENT
Anastasiya Ruda, Mariya Leonova, Andrii Popovych
Chemical and Ecological Lyceum, Dnipropetrovsk, UKRAINE

Powders used for production of tints, adsorbents, supercapacitors etc. must have high specific surface, special structure and chemical activity. In this research we proposed new method for such material obtaining and had it tested on nickel hydroxide (used in asymmetric supercapacitors). We presupposed ability called “The Effect of Popcorn”: high speed heating of a sample causes an internal “explosion” (water can’t evaporate - starts boiling). As a result highly dispersive material is formed without any chemical reactions. This method can be realized only with a microwave. Test samples of nickel hydroxide were obtained in slit membrane electrolyzer. Samples were treated by domestic microwave during 0.5-5min. Industrial and untreated ones were used as reference samples. Structural properties were investigated by XRD, HRSEM; electrochemical properties - by voltammogram, charge-discharge cycling. After microwave treatment we observed samples’ inflation and amorphy structure. Untreated samples had LDH structure with middle crystallinity. As a result tested samples had much better characteristics: specific capacity for microwave treated ones was determined to be 200-240F/g while for industrial nickel hydroxide it’s only 50-60F/g; specific energy for treated samples was 190W*h/kg and is just 85.6W*h/kg for the newest graphen supercapacitors. The suggested method can be used for any highly dispersive material production (even containing water), which will have better properties than the existing. It’s very easy to implement in industry. The process goes on so fast that no harmful chemical reactions take place. Additionally, cost of microwave treatment is less than $0.4/kg, so the method is very cheap and effective.

POLLUTION OF SOLUTION?
Marissa Alaine Lee, Reagan Palmer, Arlen Ho
Beaufort High School, Beaufort, SC

With the recent oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, researchers, along with the public, began to search for solutions to the spreading oil in the ocean. One solution that was applied in the field was chemical oil dispersant. However, this dispersant was controversial because the manufacturers did not originally share information about the dispersant, and not many tests had been done to see how it affects the water and the ocean life. This topic sparked our interest and inspired our question: What effects do oil and oil dispersant have on water? <br><br>To answer this question, the pH, conductivity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen levels were measured for four samples of circulated water in four tanks. The first was ocean water only, second was ocean water and tar balls, third was ocean water and oil dispersant, and fourth ocean water, tar balls, and oil dispersant. According to our results, the dispersant lowers pH levels, making the water more acidic. It also lowered conductivity and lowered dissolved oxygen. <br><br>The changes caused by the dispersant are not drastic nor are they immediately deadly to marine life. Data indicates a continuing pattern of changes in the water that might eventually force the water life to adapt to the new water conditions. The oil dispersant is a seemingly effective way to minimize damage to the environment resulting from oil spills, but may cause problems for wildlife in the future.

LASER-INDUCED RESONANCE LIGHT SCATTERING METHOD FOR DETECTING TRACE AMOUNTS OF CURCUMIN IN SOLUTION
Chelsea Lynn Massaro
Christian Home And Bible School, Mount Dora, FL

Curcumin, a polyphenolic beta-dicarbonyl found in turmeric, is proposed to offer medicinal advantages in treating some forms of cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Previous work indicated that curcumin strongly chelates to copper ions in solution. <br><br> <br><br> This project examined if resonance light scattering (RLS) could be used to determine the amount of curcumin present in solution. I hypothesized that if a solid-state diode laser was used to induce RLS in solution containing curcumin and copper(II), then trace amounts of curcumin would be detected in solution. If the laser-induced method was compared to fluorescence spectrometer based method of measuring RLS, then the laser-induced method would be more precise. <br><br> <br><br> A 150 milliwatt solid-state diode laser and a fluorescence spectrometer were used as excitation sources for testing experimental solutions containing varying curcumin concentrations.<br><br> <br><br> Results from both the laser-induced and fluorescence spectrometer methods revealed that the light scattering intensity increased linearly with increasing curcumin in solution. The standard deviation of the light scattering intensity was calculated after performing multiple trials. <br><br> Complex formation can be detected with high precision by laser-induced RLS at 532 nanometers. Results indicated the intensity of the RLS signal is proportional to the amount of curcumin in solution. It indicated that the solid-state laser method is the more precise method. Additionally, laser-induced RLS was capable of detecting curcumin at concentrations as low as 10 nanograms per milliliter.<br><br> The laser-induced RLS method investigated could be helpful in precisely measuring curcumin concentrations present in a blood sample if curcumin was used as treatment for disease.

A COMPARISON OF ANALYTICAL METHODOLOGIES FOR THE DETERMINATION OF SULFUR DIOXIDE LEVELS IN BLEACHED, WOODEN CHOPSTICKS
Allison Claire Young
Saint Joseph's Academy, Baton Rouge, LA

In a previous project, a pH method was used to determine sulfur dioxide exposure levels from bleached, wooden chopsticks. Since then, an article was found suggesting that less complex procedures for determining sulfur dioxide levels might be just as accurate as the Monier-Williams procedure, a procedure used by the FDA and AOAC International for determining sulfur dioxide levels in food. Thus, this project compared procedures to determine the most efficient method for determining sulfur dioxide levels in chopsticks. The hypothesis is that the Monier-Williams method is the most efficient because of the accuracy of its results. The procedure involves three methods: the Monier-Williams method, the pH method, and the Ripper method. The Monier-Williams method is an acid distillation; the pH method is based on the reaction of sulfur dioxide and water to produce sulfurous acid; and the Ripper method is an iodine titration used to determine sulfur dioxide levels in wine. Results indicate that the Monier-Williams method detected a significantly higher amount of sulfur dioxide than the other two procedures. When tested with a sodium sulfite stock solution, the Monier-Williams method detected the majority of the sulfur dioxide while the Ripper and pH methods detected less than half. Also, the amount of sulfur dioxide detected by the Monier-Williams method exceeds the FDA's restriction for sulfur dioxide in fresh foods. This leads to the conclusion that the Monier-Williams method is the most efficient method for determining sulfur dioxide levels in bleached, wooden chopsticks.

UNPRESSURIZED HYDRAULIC FRACTURING: DO DETERGENT AND WATER AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES HELP TO DECREASE THE VISCOSITY OF OIL?
Husayn Faridali Ramji
Classen School of Advanced Studies, Oklahoma City, OK

The process of drilling for oil has always been dangerous, but with newer technology, methods used to extract oil have become safer. They have continued to develop, and continue to be altered. This experiment examines one such method, namely that of dispensing water at different temperatures to retrieve oil. It functions similarly to hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” but does not require use of a highly pressured fluid. I predicted that if oil is mixed with liquid detergent, hot water would inevitably increase the entropy of the oil, therefore lowering its viscosity. With its viscosity and inertia minimized, oil can be extracted more efficiently. In the experiment corn oil was placed into a plastic bottle partially filled with aquarium gravel. Once it settled, I added water of varying temperature and used a spray bottle to “extract” the oil. Every 10 spray attempts the volume of liquid was measured until the total trials numbered 50. This procedure was repeated for water at 10°C, 15°C, 25°C, 35°C, 45°C, 55°C, 65°C, and 80°C, as well as with liquid washing detergent at a fixed temperature. Each of these eight conditions had four trials each and the results were averaged. Final results supported the prediction that 80°C water mixed with detergent extracted more oil than any of the other trials, therefore validating a current method of onshore oil mining.

The goal of the current investigation was to determine if the concentration of 1,1- dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride (metformin HCl) in aqueous solution was significantly reduced in one week. Three treatment conditions were used: 1.0 mg/mL metformin in distilled water, 0.5 mg/mL in distilled water, and 1.0 mg/mL in tap water. Samples were placed in water bottles that were held at room temperature for 10 days and were exposed to light for 12 hours each day. The concentration of aqueous metformin HCl in each sample was determined directly by UV Spectrophotometer at 230 nm. Results were quantified by comparison to varying concentrations of a pure metformin standard. The measured concentrations of the samples appeared to fluctuate somewhat day to day; this may have been due to the sampling technique or variations in the suspension of metformin in solution. Overall, there was no significant difference between the starting concentration of metformin and that at the end of the study.

CHIRAL MOLECULES STUDY, YEAR TWO: MEASURING THE EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON THE HYDROLYSIS OF SUCROSE TO INVERT SUGAR BY BETA-FRUCTOFURANOSIDASE USING POLARIZED LIGHT
Cassandra Shae Mosley
Vanguard High School, Ocala, FL

Does temperature affect the amount of invert sugar that forms during the hydrolysis of sucrose catalyzed by beta-fructofuranosidase, and can this be determined by the angle of polarization? The hypothesis stated: if the angle of rotation is related to the temperature at which sucrose hydrolyzes, then as the temperature increases, the angle of rotation will decrease.<br><br> The experiment required two polarizers, one attached to a camera on a tripod, the other on a light box; a rotating platform; and solutions containing constant amounts of sucrose, invertase, and water heated to different temperatures. The solutions were individually placed between the two polarizers on top of the light box, which was placed on the rotating base. While viewed through the camera, the platform slowly rotated the solution, and the two points were marked where the mixture became darkest. The difference between where each solution became darkest and where pure water became darkest was the angle of rotation.<br><br> The solution heated at 40 ºC exhibited the greatest angle of rotation, while the 160 ºC solution displayed the lowest (excluding water). The hypothesis was supported; as the temperature increased, the angle of rotation decreased.<br><br> Sucrose hydrolyzes completely at 160ºC. This information can be used by people in the food industry. Knowing how to effectively hydrolyze sucrose into invert sugar allows companies to sweeten products by using less sugar, which is healthier for consumers. Knowledge about chiral molecules is also useful for scientists in the pharmaceutical industry to distinguish between harmful and helpful enantiomers of a drug.

CHEMICALLY TREATED RAMIE FIBER WITH RE- SILICONE OIL METHOD AND ITS GREEN COMPOSITES
Mingsi Chen
The High School Attached to Hunan Normal University, Changsha, Hunan, CHINA

Natural fiber/polypropylene composites (NF/PP) are good for sustainable development because they are recyclable and environmentally friendly. But they do not have good mechanical properties because natural fibers are hydrophilic (mismatched with hydrophobic polymer) and have impurities and microstructure defects. So I proposed and studied a new method of chemically treating ramie fiber (RF) with rare earth and silicone oil. Analyses, such as contact angle test, infrared spectrum analysis (IR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), demonstrated the new method is very effective on overcoming the disadvantages of ramie fiber. Chemical treatment with the new method has successfully changed ramie fiber to be hydrophobic, decreased fiber's impurities and microstructure defects. Then I investigated the preparation method of the modified RF/PP green composites and found a good way of preparing NF/PP composites by a hybrid technique of blending and injection mouldling. The prepared composites were then used for mechanical tests. Test results showed that the modified RF/PP presented good mechanical properties. Its tensile, bending and compact strength increased about 14%,28%,and 15%, respectively, compared to unmodified RF/PP. Its tensile and bending strength increased by 52% and 96%, respectively, compared to pure PP. In addition, the weight of the modified RF/PP decreased by 3-12% compared to glass fiber/PP composites. This will benefit energy-saving and lower CO2 emission, and can be potentially used in buildings and vehicles, such as cars, high-speed railway, subway and so on.

THE STUDY OF CONJUGATED POLYMER GROWTH ON GRAPHITIC SURFACES AND AN ANALYSIS OF THEIR INTERACTIONS
Nicholas Anthony Buoniconti
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, FL

The Use of Graphene Platelets and other organic materials in relation with Conjugated Polymers has numerous potential applications. Investigation in this field hasn’t yielded an affordable productive nanodevice with a graphitic base and polymer nanowires thus far. If the growth of conjugated polymers could be observed and controlled on these carbon bases then the potential applications are endless. <br><br> Current problems trumping many efforts in this field of nanodevices are the cost of materials and the lack of knowledge of how to successfully manage continued nanowire growth off a carbon base. <br><br> In this experiment a selection of Graphene Platelets and a selection of Conjugated Polymers were used to determine which combinations would yield successful growth. After initial testing determined which Polymers would grow wires with the Carbon most successfully, further testing was done to see what ratios and cooling conditions could be used to optimize the production of such Carbon-Polymer nanostructures. <br><br> Using mainly TEM microscopy and UV-Vis Spectroscopy, it was determined that the polymers P3HT and PBTTT were both able to create lengthy nanowire structures off Graphene Platelets with little free nanowires in solution. Cooling the Polymer more slowly and using a mass ratio of 10 to 1 (Graphene to Polymer in Seeded Solutions) was most effective in producing said polymer structures.<br><br> With these results, future testing in this field could lead to mass production of these nanodevices. Since Graphene is highly conductive and extremely cheap the benefits of effective nanodevices using graphitic bases and Conjugated Polymers is immense.

A NOVEL MICROSCALE SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC ASSAY TO MONITOR HYDROGEN EVOLUTION FOR THE CHARACTERIZATION OF CATALYSTS
Matthew Jay Goodman
Liberal Arts & Science Academy, Austin, TX

Hydrogen-based fuel cells have significant potential to address environmental challenges posed by increasing global energy demands. This project confronts a critical obstacle to their implementation, namely the inefficiency of current catalytic reactivity testing methods. A new assay was developed to quantitatively test the effectiveness of highly dilute catalysts at accelerating hydrolysis reactions for hydrogen-based fuel cells. The developed assay achieves efficiency by utilizing spectrophotometric data to indirectly measure hydrogen production over time. The reduction by hydrogen of methyl viologen dication (MV2+) to its radical monocation (MV+•) correlates directly to the hydrogen concentration in solution. The rate of hydrogen production was determined by measuring a specific absorbance peak of MV+• at 602 nm using an ultraviolet-visual spectrometer. Various monometallic dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles (DENs) were employed as sample catalysts for the hydrolysis of sodium borohydride in aqueous solution. Each catalyst was tested in 15 trials at 2µM and 0.25µM. The concentration of MV+• in solution indicated the catalytic reactivity of the DENs – compared to the 2µM copper DENs, the 2µM palladium DENs accelerated the reaction ~17x, and the 2µM platinum DENs accelerated the reaction ~31x. The principal advantage of the new assay is that catalytic reactivity can be measured efficiently and with significant accuracy using nanoscale quantities of catalyst. By utilizing lesser quantities of catalyst, this assay facilitates the testing of a class of catalysts previously considered costly. These results exhibit tremendous ability to impact the future development and manufacture of hydrogen-based fuel cells.

ASYMMETRIC CONJUGATE ADDITION OF ORTHO-QUINONE METHIDES AS A PATHWAY TO THE CORE OF NOMOFUNGIN
Joshua Moses Kubiak
Louisiana School for Math, Science, and the Arts, Natchitoches, LA

The tetracyclic structure at the heart of nomofungin, a communesin analog, was recently synthesized through a palladium-catalyzed difunctionalization reaction followed by cyclization. In the presented work, it is shown that this tetracyclic core structure can also be accessed through the 1,4- conjugate addition of an indole onto an ex-situ ortho-quinone methide followed by oxidative cyclization. The focus of the presented work was to induce enantioselectivity in the conjugate addition reaction. It was found that chiral BINOL phosphoric acid catalysts can be used to influence the enantioselectivity of the addition which is shown by the clear selectivity found in the initial screenings. A highest enantiomeric ratio of 37:63 was obtained indicating that one enantiomer was formed nearly two-fold as much as the other. It was found that the conjugate addition occurs best at low temperatures with a substrate and a catalyst that both have bulky substituents and an indole that does not have an extremely electron-withdrawing protecting group. The most promising addition product was cyclized to generate the desired core structure, showing the feasibility of the new synthetic approach. Unlike previous methods, the new approach is not reliant upon the presence of two hydroxyl groups on the substrate and does not use palladium catalysts with are both expensive and highly toxic. The created core structure can be used as a scaffold for the synthesis of novel compounds which may have useful biological activity and possible medicinal applications.

CARBON NANOTUBE SYNTHESIS & CHARACTERIZATION, II
Neerja Aggarwal
L.V. Hightower High School, Missouri City, TX

Carbon nanotubes possess high mechanical strength and varying electronic properties applicable in the thin film solar industry. However, the nanotube growth mechanism remains unclear, and so work is ongoing to achieve selective growth. Type-specific synthesis of multi-walled carbon nanotubes was investigated with respect to industrial output of product to analyze the dynamics and kinetics of the growth mechanism.<br><br>Chemical vapor deposition was used to execute a parametric study of hydrogen gas concentration and reaction temperature. Samples were analyzed using thermogravimetric analysis, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. <br><br>The results suggest optimal growth conditions [5 % H2/Ar at 1 LPM and 800 °C] for high yield and purity are obtained by increasing the gas flow rate and growth temperature. Hydrogen is responsible for reduction and activation of the iron catalyst that decomposes the carbon source and forms nanotubes. Effectively, increased hydrogen concentration activates a greater proportion of iron nanoparticles making them catalytically active. Temperatures of 800 °C lowers catalyst’s activation energy, thus accelerating carbon decomposition rate and prolonging nanotube formation. Parallel, aligned nanotube growth in some samples suggests asynchronous nucleation and potential for spinning fibers. <br><br>Reaction conditions can be manipulated to increase nanotube selectivity and activity of the catalyst. Post-processing of nanotubes was also examined including sample purification, nanotube dispersion, and thin film fabrication. The impact of this research supports industrial scale output of nanotubes for a solar cell industry that could be achieved by optimization of parameters at ambient pressure conditions.

SILVER SUPERCONDUCTORS: IS IT POSSIBLE?
Michael P. Dugas
Carlsbad High School, Carlsbad, NM

Since 1911, chemists and physicists have tried to understand and enhance superconductivity. This goal was partially achieved in the 1980s when scientists discovered the compound YBa2Cu3O6.5, or YBCO, is superconductive. Now, nearly thirty years later, another breakthrough could be here to unravel the mystery of superconductivity.<br><br>This project is designed to investigate whether silver can be a viable replacement of copper not only in a YBCO superconductor matrix, but also in other superconducting matrices that utilize copper. Through research, I have hypothesized that this could be possible due to the similarities between copper and silver. This project is also intended to broaden any superconductive knowledge that I have gathered over the past few years.<br><br>In conducting the experiment, I utilized the YBCO manufacturing process in order to produce both samples. The first sample was a YBCO superconductor. This was to test the equipment as well as the manufacturing process itself. The next sample was the silver material that was to test my hypothesis. Once both samples were manufactured, the materials were then tested using the Meissner Effect of superconductors. <br><br>Testing shows that the YBCO sample proves superconductive because the magnet levitated above the superconductor via the Meissner Effect. This proves that the manufacturing process succeeded in producing a superconductor. Unfortunately, when the silver material was tested, the magnet did not levitate, proving that the material was not superconductive. However, there are several possibilities and many more tests to come before silver can be considered non-superconductive.

EFFECTS OF PROTEINS ON DYE SENSITIZED SOLAR CELLS
Pooja Ajay Warrier
Laramie Senior High School, Laramie, WY

By converting the light energy absorbed by dyes to produce electricity, dye sensitized solar cells has become a low-cost, efficient renewable energy source. Different sources of organic dyes have been used to build a DSSC. In addition, these dyes can be purified or contain other natural components like proteins, cells, etc. And the addition of such components can affect the adherence of the dye to the TiO2 layer, thus the capacity of the DSSC. For this experiment the pure organic dye Rhodamine B (alone and with protein (BSA)) was compared. The Rhodamine B was used to stain the TiO2 in the first trials. Then the protein Bovine Serum Albumin was added to the Rhodamine B to discover its effects on the voltage output of the DSSC. Rhodamine B is a cationic species and has an overall positive charge. And the BSA at neutral pH has a negative charge. The opposite charges of the BSA and Rhodamine B were predicted to attract and cause the dye molecules to become closer to each other, to form easier pathways for electron injection. The BSA was tested to discover if it would reduce or improve the voltage output of the DSSC-depending on the pathways through which the electrons travel. The addition of BSA can help symbolize how the proteins found in unpurified organic dyes bind to the TiO2, in comparison to purified organic dyes. This difference in binding leads to a difference in the capacity of the DSSC.

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HSCAS TO BIND AFLATOXIN IN DDGS IN A SIMULATED CORN-TO-ETHANOL PROCESS
Valerie Christen Briell
Seguin High School, Seguin, TX

Corn is a popular feed for livestock that can suffer from mold infestation and subsequent poisonous aflatoxin contamination. Hydrated sodium calcium aluminum silicate (HSCAS) is an additive that adsorbs afaltoxin and is dry mixed into the feed at 2 to 25 kg/mt of feed. <br><br>Corn is also a popular feedstock for ethanol production. A co-product of the process is dried distillers grain and solubles (DDGS), which can be a nutritious feed additive, but is plagued by aflatoxin contamination. The purpose of this research was to determine if, and to what extent, HSCAS can alleviate the aflatoxin problem in DDGS. The hypothesis was that HSCAS would effectively and efficiently reduce aflatoxin to acceptable FDA levels.<br><br>Corn spiked with a high level of aflatoxin was used as feed in a lab simulated corn-to-ethanol process and increasing levels if HSCAS were added in the process water. Aflatoxin was extracted and separated/recovered by filtration and affinity chromatography. Detection methods include a fluorometer and a high pressure liquid chromatograph (HPLC).<br><br>The results showed a negative relationship between the levels of HSCAS in feed corn and the levels of aflatoxin in the DDGS. Further, the results indicated a very efficient process of toxin adsorption, as acceptable FDA levels were achieved at < 1 kg HSCAS/mt of corn.<br><br>In conclusion, the hypothesis was supported by the data. Highly water dispersible HSCAS, when added to the aqueous based corn-to-ethanol process, provides a means of using severely aflatoxin contaminated corn for the production of safe DDGS for animal feed.

AN INVESTIGATION INTO VOLUMETRIC BEHAVIOUR OF SALTS AND SACCHARIDES IN AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS
Alexander Zakharov
International School of Stavanger, Stavanger, NORWAY

The study was aimed at investigating the magnitude of deviation of salts and saccharides from volume additivity by looking at the volume shrinkages of compounds that were dissolved in water. Three processes were considered, which could potentially contribute to the observed volume shrinkages. The research question of this study was the following:<br><br>How and why do the apparent molar volumes of salts and saccharides in aqueous solutions differ from their molar volumes in a crystalline state?<br><br>In order to proceed with the investigation, it was necessary to collect experimental data. The experimental data included masses of a fixed volume of different aqueous solutions, which were then converted to densities using the formula: p=m/v.<br><br>After that, various analytical and graphical methods were used to calculate the shrinkages in molar volumes of the chosen compounds.<br><br>The results showed that volumes of the two salts (sodium and potassium chlorides) undergo a significant shrinkage in comparison with the two sugars (glucose and sucrose), volumes of which stay more or less constant.<br><br>Sodium chloride showed a more pronounced tendency to shrink in volume than potassium chloride did. To explain the volume shrinkage of potassium chloride, it was enough to assume that upon dissolution, the ions are rearranged into a more efficient packing. However, such rearrangement was not sufficient to explain the volume shrinkage of sodium chloride. In addition to their closer-packing, sodium ions orientate water molecules towards themselves, causing local distraction of water structure.<br><br>The picture was quite different for the sugars, since they only underwent very slight deviation from volume additivity. This is due to homogenous intermolecular interactions between sugars and water molecules.

SYNTHESIS OF TRIAZENE COMPOUNDS AND THEIR APPLICATION IN SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC DETERMINATION OF CADMIUM
Peter Horvath
High School of Jan Chalupka, Brezno, SLOVAKIA

There are many methods for determination of cadmium in liquid matrices. The simplest and cheapest methods are based on spectrophotometry using organic reagents, especially triazenes, which make strongly coloured complex compounds with cadmium. This work deals with synthesis of aromatic triazene compounds, which were not described for the purpose of cadmium determination. 20 derivates of 1,3-diphenyltriazene were synthesized by N-azo coupling of primary aromatic amines with aromatic diazonium salts. Products were characterized by melting points, UV/VIS absorption spectra, 1H NMR and IR spectra, where available and necessary. Coordination compounds of synthesized compounds with cadmium, calcium, magnesium, copper, nickel and cobalt cations were prepared by reaction of triazenes with them in alkaline solutions. Micellar solutions of these complexes were made by dissolving in a solution of non-ionic surfactant Triton X-100 and UV/VIS absorption spectra of these solutions were recorded. As we expected, some of their complexes with cadmium have absorption spectra significantly different from spectra of blank reagents or their complexes with other ions. Thus the novel, simple, cheap and sensitive method for cadmium determination using the most suitable reagent, 1,3-bis(4-nitrophenyl)triazene, was developed. The optimal conditions of the method have been found: The solution for spectrophotometry is prepared mixing the sample with 300 µl of 2% solution of Triton X-100; 300 µl of 1 mmol. dm-3 acetonic solution of 1,3-bis(4-nitrophenyl)triazene; 250 µl of 1 mol.dm-3 solution of NaOH and the solution is diluted to 10 ml. Absorbance is measured at 450 nm against reagent blank. Limit of detection of cadmium is 21 µg.dm-3 and molar absorption coefficient of its complex is 1,31 . 10^5 dm3. mol-1. cm-1. The results of this work can be applied in simple quantitative determination of cadmium in environment by spectrophotometry.

THE ELECTROCHEMICAL EFFECTS OF SACCHARIDES ON THE VOLTAGE OUTPUT OF A MICROBIAL FUEL CELL USING PENICILLIUM CHRYSOGENUM
Jack Erdozain
Westminster Christian School, Palmetto Bay, FL

Microbial Fuel Cell Technology (MFC) is a widely growing field of alternative energy research. One of the goals in this field is to discover a new biocatalyst, that will be efficient and yield a higher level of voltage. This organism discovered in this project was Penicillium chrysogenum. Before this experiment, this organism had never been tested in application to MFCs. This research demonstrated that this organism was not only viable as an alternative to conventional MFCs, but also yielded an increase in voltage of 40% in comparison to fuel cells of otherwise similar conditions. In addition, research was performed on the effects of different saccharide chain lengths, like Glucose, D-ribose and Dihydroxyacetone and varying these concentrations on the energy output of the cells. The results showed that a higher voltage peak would result from greater saccharide concentrations and, once again, greater in those of glucose based cells. Along with this, they also presented a higher growth curve in comparison to fuel cells with lower concentrations, or D-ribose or Dihydroxyacetone within the anode chamber. The experiment was tested over a thirty day trial period using ten fuel cells. Three concentration levels were tested: 1/6 moles added, 1/3 moles added, and lastly 1/2 moles added of each respective saccharide. For each of these concentrations three fuel cells were made and lastly one control, which had no saccharide added. This research will help to create a new more efficient and powerful version of this technology, which may be used in impoverished nations.

GOLD NANOPARTICLE OPTIMIZATION VIA STEPWISE ANNEALING OF ULTRATHIN FILMS ON SOLID SUBSTRATE
Hadass Shifra Inbar
Galili High school, Kfar Saba, ISRAEL

Gold nanoparticles (NP) attract great interest as biosenors with high sensitivity to changes in surrounding dielectric medium due to the Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) phenomenon. This project addresses the great challenge of narrowing the size distribution in the synthesis of Au NP, a critical aspect for efficient sensing. A novel method based on stepwise annealing of ultrathin Au films evaporated on glass substrate was developed. <br><br>The method includes an initial annealing of a 15nm Au film at 200C allowing hole formation and grain growth in the percolated Au film. These changes were followed through in-situ UV-vis spectroscopy and ex-situ SEM, AFM and XRD measurements. Next, films were heated to 560C for 10 hours to promote dewetting of the film and formation of NP, which were studied by SEM, AFM and LSPR spectroscopy. Measurements show decrease in NP volume and aspect ratio with increase of the thermal treatment duration and a shift the absorption peak by as much as 74nm. A second annealing profile of Au films heated at 800C was devised to improve the stability of the Au NP, leading rapid embedding of the NP in the glass substrate.<br><br>This comprehensive approach starting from film evaporation to NP embedding contributes to former studies of Au film thermal treatments which concentrated on each step separately. <br><br>The results confirmed that control of Au NP morphology, optical properties and immobility can be achieved solely by thermal treatments, thus, providing a simple and scalable technique that can be applied for biosensing technology.<br><br>

ACIDIC AND ALKALINE HYBRID FUEL CELLS FOR ELECTRICITY GENERATION
Weicheng Lin
Guangdong Experimental High School, Guangzhou, Guangdong, CHINA

Fuel cell is a promising energy convert system for many applications including electric cars, portable devices, and stationary generation. However, the humidification is a critical challenge to maintain the fuel cell operation for long time. This invention discloses an electricity generation system with acidic and alkaline hybrid fuel cells without the additional humidify system. This system can meet the requirements of self-humidification by using the water generated from the alkaline side to the acidic side according to the working principle of the two cells in series. The manufacture of the hydride system includes the synthesis of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA), the creation of the flow field, and the assembly of the MEA, bipolar plates, the gaskets and end plates to form a fuel cell. There is only one fuel compartment used for a hybrid structure to significantly reduce the volume of the system. Thereby, the cost could be significantly cut down. On the other hand, such fuel cell can generate higher power by connecting many single cells in series. The hybrid system has higher energy density and lower cost due to the reduction of the volume and auxiliary system with the improved electrochemical performance and efficiency. It is ready to mass production, providing the available of all the original materials.<br><br>This electricity generation can be used in sustainable, vehicle and portable devices as an alternative to fossil fuels for internal combustion engine and meet the zero emission goal.

THE DETERMINATION OF THE QUANTITY OF POTASSIUM HYDROGEN PHTHALATE BUFFER NEEDED TO INHIBIT PH INCREASE BY THE ACTION OF UREASE IN ARTIFICIAL URINE
Surekha Uma Mullangi
Burlington Community High School, Burlington, IA

The purpose of this project was to determine if a quantity of potassium hydrogen phthalate could be used to inhibit encrustation by urease in artificial urine. The initial concept was to determine an effective method to decrease or eliminate encrustation in human urine on urinary catheters. In many long-term catheter use situations, this encrustation is due to the action of urease-producing bacteria Proteus Mirabilis.<br><br> Encrustation levels in the artificial urine were assessed by using filtration and spectrophotometer techniques. Various levels of KHP buffer were used in order to determine the minimum quantity necessary to inhibit encrustation. Initial data revealed that the use of KHP caused significant reduction in encrustation compared to controls without KHP. This was measured quantitatively by assessing filtrate as well as by determining absorbance and percent transmittance. Further statistical analysis revealed a greater improvement in decreasing turbidity by the addition of nine grams of KHP per one hundred milliliters of artificial urine than at other concentrations. The equilibrium point can be extrapolated by assessing the data from the spectrophotometer.<br><br> It was concluded that there is a minimum quantity between 8.500 grams KHP and 9.000 grams KHP that can inhibit and control encrustation by urease.

Cytochromes P450 are hemthiolate biocatalysts classified as oxidoreductase. Most of them are located on the endoplasmic reticulum of cells. They metabolize about 50% of all administered drugs with known metabolism. The analysis is based on accurate detection of amino acid residues of input channels and on evaluation of their functions and mutual cooperations.<br><br>The starting material for the study was online database, where I got 3D structures of human cytochrome P450 isoforms determined by monocrystal X-ray diffraction. The basic tool for monitoring and processing of these structures was specific graphic program. In a next step, through thorough visual inspection I identified the presence and spatial orientation of the channel lining residues. The identified lining residues were also mapped onto primary sequences alignment to identify potential evolutionary conservation. Physical-chemical properties of identified channels were evaluated. From results, active sites of all surveyed isoforms have negatively charged residues. I estimated that cytochrome P450 is anchored to the plasmatic membrane by its N-terminus. Moreover, only channels in the conversion of the substrate, which regulate the F/G loop, were selected.<br><br>This project presents principal results, data and hypothesis for development of the research of cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are involved in I. phase metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics. It also highlights the importance of studying the microscopic enviroment to understand the phenomena with macroscopic manifestation. Knowledge of drug interactions with cytochromes P450 helps in the regulation of drug administration and assessment of clinically significant drug interactions.

The world resources of easily accessible fossil fuels have been diminishing quickly over the last few decades. Thus, it has now become very important for people to increase the efficiency of fuel cells. Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) have drawn great attention recently due to their high density, low pollution emission, and low operating temperatures.<br><br>Graphene is known as a 2D structure material, which has great conductivity to be used as an electrode. Platinum nanoparticles are deposited onto graphene sheets via synchronous reduction of H2PtCl6 and graphene oxide (GO) suspension using NaBH4.<br><br>Furthermore, graphene oxide was reduced to graphene. In order to enhance the electrochemical performance of DMFCs, this experiment also added modified material, benzoyl chloride and terephthaloyl chloride, to study the differences from the unmodified one. Samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM), etc. The real platinum metal surface area was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry(CV) on a thin porous coated disk electrode. It became clear that the modified electrochemical performance of graphene proved to be superior.

INVESTIGATING THE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE LIESEGANG RING PHENOMENON
Hayden Joseph Allen
Cascia Hall Preparatory School, Tulsa, OK

The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate the copper sulfate/potassium chromate Liesegang Ring (LR) phenomenon to determine how selected physical factors affect the formation of the ring structures. The LR phenomenon is an under explained system of rings that few scientists have studied. Liesegang rings are formed when two reacting species are placed in an agar gel medium. In this experiment, CuSO4 and K2CrO4 were used to produce Liesegang Rings (CuCrO4). This project evaluates the effects of UV light and Electromagnetic forces on the LR systems and evaluates the mathematical relationships existing within the data. The hypotheses are as follows: As the concentration of CuSO4 increases the number of rings formed will increase and the horizontal rings will become more defined. UV light will increase the total number of rings formed, increase diffusion rate, as measured by the Total Reaction Zone distance (TRZd) and increase the Triplet Ring Set distance (TRSd) as compared to the control. The electromagnetic system will differ from the UV and Control system by causing the Cu2+ ion to diffuse faster within the gel, increase diffusion rate, as measured by the TRZd and increase the TRSd as compared to the control. Radii were measured underneath a microscope and the relationship between the natural logarithm of the difference of the radii was plotted against the natural logarithm of the difference of the ring number. The slope of the line is equal to the proportionality coefficient for the proportion. This relationship suggests that there is a definite proportionality within the data because 99.5% of the natural logarithm of the difference in the radii can be explained by the natural logarithm of the difference of the number of rings (r2=0.9946).

SYNTHESIS OF NANOSTRUCTURED MATERIALS (MOF-5) FROM RECYCLED PET BOTTLES
Marcos Vinicius Silva Amorim
Colegio de Aplicacao Emmanuel Leontsinis, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, BRASIL

Synthesis of new compounds is one of the most important tools in modern technology. I have studied a new approach to synthesize hybrid molecular nanostructured sieves from recyclable sources, using recycled poly(ethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles. The Benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid (1,4-BDC) can be obtained from powered PET bottles after total basic hydrolysis, followed by neutralization. This acid is then reacted with zinc acetate, Zn(OAc)2, in demethylformamide (DMF) or diethylformamide (DEF), under solvothermal conditions with conventional heating and by microwave irradiation to afford the molecular sieve Zn4O(1,4-BDC)4 also known as metal-organic framework number 5, or MOF-5. The resulting white powder from this synthesis as characterized by a series of techniques, showing that the material is crystalline, symmetrical and significantly porous, with high thermal resistance (degradation at 400 Celsius). This nanostructured material, which was demonstrated that can be obtained from trash, could be used for the transport of gases, enabling its use in natural gas transport, CO2 capture and mitigation, as well as safe hydrogen stockage device, due to MOF’s gas adsorption capacity, making it very attractive from a sustainable point of view.

COMPARISON OF TRADITIONAL THERMALLY CURED EPOXY-AMINE/KEVLAR COMPOSITES VS. UV-CURED THIOL-ENE/KEVLAR COMPOSITES
DeAndre DeShaun Stafford May
Hattiesburg High School, Hattiesburg, MS

Traditionally energy intensive thermally cured epoxy-amines are used as the matrix in Kevlar composites. The goal of this project is to replace the epoxy-amines with a more easily manufactured material. Some benefits of UV-cured thiol-enes include fast and eco-friendly preparation. UV-cured thiol-ene Kevlar systems were prepared and compared to traditionally thermally cured epoxy amine Kevlar systems. To determine if the materials were comparable, differential scanning calorimetry was used to find the glass transition temperatures. After finding the glass transition temperature, samples of each material were prepared for property comparison. The ability for the material to wet the Kevlar mat was observed along with other properties.

SYNTHESIS AND ANALYSIS OF NOVEL PHOTOTRIGGERS FOR DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEMS
Sukjin Jang
Commack High School, Commack, NY

Despite two decades of research on photolabile linkers, there is still not a strong candidate for drug delivery. This project’s objective was to improve the photo-releasing efficiency of phototriggers by studying the mechanisms of the photoreaction and the factors that contribute to increase in photo-releasing efficiency. The paper focuses on one phototrigger called triphenylethanonyl. This phototrigger is a modified form of benzoin based on the concept of improving the resonance present on the carbocation. The resonance will stabilize the product after photoreaction, and therefore increase the photo-releasing efficiency. The photo-releasing efficiency of the compound, 1,2,2-triphenylethanonyl N-t-boc gamma amino butanoic acid, the efficiency was far greater than the previous phototriggers. The study of TPE-GABA reaction mechanism confirmed the effectiveness of stabilizing the carbocation and also highlights to the importance of the spin state in determining the photo-releasing efficiency.

ARSENIC IN APPLE JUICE
Joshua Louis Hernandez
Weber High School, Pleasant View, UT

In November 2011, reports of traces of arsenic in our country’s favorite brands of apple juice were reported. A worry for children drinking arsenic in apple juice arose. Currently there is no limit on how much arsenic is allowed in juice, there is a limit of 10 ppb in bottle-water. I believe that there are traces of arsenic higher than 10 ppb in apple juice products. I believe that the amounts should not have immediate short term consequences on human health.<br><br>I bought the selected apple juice brands from local stores to simulate an average person buying a certain apple juice product. Products were taken to a product sampling company laboratory. Juice product data was taken such as lot number and description of product. Each juice product was sample to size of 1 mg. Juice products that came packaged in groups (ex. 6-pack of children juice boxes) were taken an a composite sample of 1 mg. All samples were tested by an ICP for traces of arsenic and lead. Some grape juice products were also tested with the same procedures done as the apple juice products.<br><br>The study consisted of 42 different samples. Three samples of apple juice products exceeded to 10 ppb. The sample of arsenic levels ranged from background data to as high as 14.62 ppb. It was also found that seven grape juice products exceeded 10 ppb. They ranged from 8.04 to 16.04 ppb in arsenic levels. Top brands that tested high were Great Value. Motts, Tree Top, and Welch’s. No sample yielded considerable lead levels.<br><br>The data provided evidence that there are levels of arsenic higher than 10 ppb in apple juice products and grape juice products. A large sample of apple juice was not needed to see result of levels higher than 10 ppb. Further research is needed to assess long-term effect on people.

N-HYDROXYSUCCINIMIDE ESTER OF 4-PENTYNOIC ACID: BIFUNCTIONAL REAGENT FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF NEOGLYCOCONJUGATES
Maria Panova
Moscow Chemical Lyceum, Moscow, RUSSIA

Pathogenic bacteria and viruses can cause many kinds of severe diseases. The major remedies for bacterial diseases are antibiotics. Nowadays many bacteria have become resistant for the most common antibiotics. That's why in many countries the main problem is a finding a new treatment for pneumonia, staphylococcus infection, tuberculosis etc. which would be based on non-antibiotics concepts. One of the ways is the investigation of carbohydrate-protein interactions (because bacteria and viruses recognize human cells via such interactions). The most common tool for studying them is so-called neoglycoconjugate. Neoglycoconjugate consists of 3 parts: oligosaccharide and carrier (protein, nanoparticles, etc.) which connected together with different spacers. It was found that scientists could not predict the nature of spacers: different spacers were demanded for different proteins. That's mean that we cannot produce universal spacer. It is needed to synthesis neoglycoconjugates with different types of spacers.<br><br>In our work we choose two of them – amide bond and triazole cycle. For their synthesis we proposed to use bifunctional reagent and one precursor – sugar derivative. If we were succeeded we would have got two neoglycoconjugates just by changing reactions conditions. We wanted to investigate the best route for the synthesis of neoglycoconjugates: using protected or unprotected sugar derivative.<br><br>We obtained 4 neoglycoconjugates containing amide bond or triazole cycle from protected and unprotected sugar derivatives. It was shown that for the synthesis the best way is the using of unprotected sugar derivative. In this case the yields are very high (80-90%).

TRASH TO CASH, POWERING YOUR HOME WITH: BIOGAS
Destiney Danielle Hill
A BEKA Academy, Pensacola, FL

This year I wanted to focus on creating a source of energy that would help to power the homes of America and all around the world. In doing so, I created an experiment designed to create biogas. I hypothesized that the sample "Milk" would produce the highest amount of methane gas from all my samples because of it's pH level of a neutral. By letting certain food items decay and by using Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) I was able to read the levels of methane produced by each food sample. I found that the sample "Milk" produced the highest amount of methane out of my other samples: Lemon Juice, Egg, and a Mixture of all three of these food items. The mix sample was my control. This showed that "Milk" had the fastest decaying rate as well. Thus I went on to design a type of "Waste-To-Energy" biowaste digester. This would allow food, waste, and trash to be thrown away in a home and then turned into energy to power that home.

NATURAL FRUITS AND PLANT EXTRACTS AS POTENTIAL ANTACIDS
Carlos Enrique Rodriguez
Pablo Colon Berdecia High School, Barranquitas, PUERTO RICO

This research deals with the analysis of medicinal plants and fruits as natural antacids. There are many antacids in the market but some may produce side effects. That is why in this investigation spearmint tea (hierbabuena) and papaya juice were analyzed to find out whether these are effective against heartburn and an alternative without side effects. <br><br>For this research the process of titration was carried out. A solution of 0.10 M of HCl to simulate stomach acid was prepared. Fifteen (15 mL) of spearmint tea solution and three drops of phenolphthalein were added to 50 mL of HCl. Part of the HCl was neutralized by the spearmint tea, and the amount of HCl that remained unreacted was determined by neutralizing with 0.10 M NaOH. NaOH was added slowly until the solution turned pink. The procedure was repeated with the papaya juice. This procedure was repeated three times with each extract and an average measure was calculated for each one. Four point six (4.6 mL) of HCl were neutralized by the papaya juice and spearmint tea neutralized 6.0 mL of HCl. It was also found that the moles of HCl neutralized by 1 gram of papaya juice were 0.008 and for spearmint tea were 0.011. Analysis of the data concluded that the studied medicinal plant and fruit are antacids, because they could neutralize more than 0.005 moles of HCl per gram of tea or juice.

ANALYSIS OF THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT FOUND IN A SLIMMING PILL
Keishaly Cabrera Cruz
Rafael Rocca High School, Naguabo, PUERTO RICO

This research works with soft gel slimming pills. These pills act as appetite suppressants to help people get slim and are presumed to be 100% natural and without side effects. Nevertheless, it is known that sibutramine is an active ingredient found in these pills. The hypothesis was: if the functional groups of sibutramine are known, it is possible to determine what side effects it can have on the human body. To analyze these pills and the functional groups two types of experiments were done: one in the laboratory and one with a computer program. For the first one a solution of 900 mL of HCl 0.1M and distilled water was prepared. The solution with the dissolved pill was put in the dissolution bath. A sample of this solution was put in the infrared spectrum. For the second one, the Gauss View and Gaussian 03 computer programs were used. In the first program the molecule of sibutramine was built and in the second a computerized infrared spectrum of the molecule was obtained. Three functional groups: the N-C (amino group), Cl and benzene were identified. The amino group accelerates metabolism and provokes side effects such as headaches, strokes, mouth dryness, constipation and hypertension. A questionnaire was administered to people over eighteen years old who use these pills, to find which effects, if any, they experienced using them. The data obtained from the questionnaires and the one obtained with chemical analysis corroborated these symptoms. It is concluded that the hypothesis is accepted.

PAPER ANALYTICAL DEVICES (PADS) FOR COUNTERFEIT DRUG DETECTION
James Robert Firth
Marian High School, Mishawaka, IN

The counterfeiting of pharmaceuticals and the rapidly increasing number of antimicrobial resistant diseases are two serious problems facing the world today. As with most serious world problems, people who live in the developing parts of the world are the most affected. Only a very small number of antibiotics are prescribed by and purchased from actual physicians in developing countries. This leaves the pharmaceutical market open to counterfeiting. Antibiotics are often counterfeited or used in other counterfeit drugs such as anti-malaria pills. Counterfeits often contain small amounts of the active ingredient. This creates two problems. For the individual patient, the counterfeit lacks the potency to eliminate the infection. On a broader scale it encourages the development of antimicrobial resistant strains of disease. The goal of this project is to develop simple colorimetric tests to semi-quantitatively and qualitatively determine the validity of an antibiotics sample. These tests are to be quick, simple and stable on paper so that non-professionals can easily perform them in non-laboratory environments. This project seeks to determine the antibiotic’s pH so that a selective colorimetric pH indicator can be identified.

COMPUTER-AIDED DRUG DISCOVERY: STRUCTURE-BASED DESIGN AND EVALUATION OF SMALL MOLECULE BOTULINUM NEUROTOXIN INHIBITORS
Sarah Rebecca Chapin
Herricks High School, New Hyde Park, NY

Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are the most toxic of the CDC’s virulent Category A bioterrorism weapons. Paradoxically, they are also promising medical therapeutics, and while the general public is routinely exposed to BoNTs through BOTOX® injections in medical procedures, there are no BoNT inhibitors effective after neural cell entry. <br><br>Complicating BoNT inhibitor development is the existence of seven unique BoNT serotypes. Furthermore, traditional peptide-based drugs are effective in vitro but are too large to enter neurons in vivo.<br><br>Using computational biochemistry and rational drug design methodologies, I developed a 15-compound library of BoNT inhibitors and the first protocol for the design and evaluation of small, organic and pan-active BoNT inhibitors capable of entering neurons and preventing botulinum poisoning by all BoNT serotypes. Nine peptidomimetic inhibitors were identified via computational screening that compared the pharmacophores of potential inhibitors to the pharmacophore of a reference peptide previously found to bind effectively to the toxins. These compounds were evaluated via a high-throughput enzyme assay. Calculated IC50 values showed the best inhibitor was 97% more potent than the reference peptide and my computational protocol was 900 times more successful than traditional non-computational drug design methods. I also designed six inhibitors by optimizing a previously-identified lead compound. Molecular DOCKing and Molecular Dynamics studies indicated these novel compounds will be more potent BoNT inhibitors than the original molecule. My library of BoNT inhibitors and cost-effective, time-efficient protocol provide a solid foundation for the development of drugs to alleviate BoNT bioterrorism threats and facilitate safe BOTOX® treatments.

SPECTROSCOPIC CHARACTERIZATION OF THE REACTIVITY OF SUBSTRATE WATER MOLECULES IN BIO-INSPIRED CATALYSTS FOR WATER OXIDATION
Aneesh Shah
Half Hollow Hills High School East, Dix Hills, NY

Current global economies demand an exorbitant amount of energy, primarily provided through the consumption of fossil fuels. Unfortunately, the combustion of fossil fuels causes detrimental effects to the environment; therefore, it is necessary to innovate clean and efficient alternate energy sources. One such alternative is inspired by the blueprint of nature's photosynthetic machinery. Photosynthesis uses solar energy to oxidize water at the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) at 95% or greater quantum efficiency. Two bio-mimetic compounds, [H2O(terpy)MnIII(u-O)2MnIV(terpy)OH2](NO3)3] and [(bpy)2Mn (u-O)2Mn(bpy)2](ClO4)3], were synthesized due to their similar structure and characteristics to the OEC. These compounds were studied using 2D HYSCORE electron paramagnetic resonance, to probe their proton environment. Spectra of the proton reactivity revealed four protons (HI, HII, HIII, and HIV) interacting with the unpaired electrons at the paramagnetic core. HI derived from the ligand, HII and HIII from the water molecule coordinated to Mn+4, and HIV from the water molecule coordinated to Mn+3. While recent X-ray crystal structures provide a model for the geometry of the tetranuclear manganese-calcium-oxo catalytic cluster of the OEC, there is limited knowledge of its catalytic mechanism. This work provides for the first time the reactivity of substrate water molecules bound to model biomimetics and can, by analogy, be applied to the mechanism of the OEC found in Photosystem II. It is essential to understand the mechanism of the OEC in order to produce improved alternate energy systems that can oxidize water with the addition of solar energy. Future applications of OEC biomimetics may include alternative fuel production, water desalination, and atmospheric CO2 reduction.

DEVELOPMENT OF A GREEN SOLVENT AND CATALYST SYSTEM FOR SUZUKI COUPLING REACTIONS
Claudia Huang
Carmel High School, Carmel, IN

The development of ecologically sustainable and green reaction conditions has recently become a major driving force of synthetic organic chemistry endeavors in both academia and industry. These efforts include reducing chemical waste, utilizing more environmentally benign alternatives instead of conventional organic solvents, and developing new technologies to recover and reuse precious metal catalysts. The palladium-catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling is a powerful and versatile tool for selective construction of carbon-carbon bonds. This research project, based on the principles of green chemistry, investigated two aspects of Suzuki coupling reactions: 1) an efficient and environmentally friendly green solvent system; 2) a new sustainable and biodegradable catalyst support using cellulose. We have developed a green solvent system 40% ethanol in water. It was discovered that the renewable and environmental-friendly cellulose-supported Pd catalyst is compatible with the green solvent system. This newly developed process considerably lowered the consumption of inorganic base and the costs of the processes. The cellulose-supported Pd can be handled safely and recovered by simple filtration, which are great advantages in industrial processes. It was found that by using our green solvent system and cellulose-supported Pd catalyst, the Suzuki coupling reaction proceeded rapidly with a quantitative conversion in most cases. Typically, the complete conversion of aryl bromides and aryl boronic acids into C-C bond coupled products was achieved at ambient temperature within 30 minutes. This newly developed process can tolerate a wide range of functional groups. The broad applications of the process were demonstrated through the syntheses of several important pharmaceutical molecules.

PREDICTING BANDGAP OF SEMICONDUCTORS TO SYNTHESIZE THE MOST EFFICIENT SOLAR CELL
Jennifer Lam
Stuyvesant High School, New York, NY

The bandgap energy of a semiconductor determines the range of the electromagnetic spectrum that a solar cell can convert into electricity. To achieve high efficiency, a tandem solar cell comprised of multiple layers of semiconductors with different bandgaps must be available, and predicting bandgap is necessary to designing these solar cells. A method of bandgap tuning was found and applied to this effect. Bandgap was plotted against intrinsic properties including electronegativity, bowing parameter, and bond length in search for a predictive correlation. Bandgap energy was not found to correlate with electronegavity or bowing parameter. However, bandgap energy was found to correlate with bond length. A negative linear trend prevailed within separate alloy groups (group IIA-VI: R2=0.9019, IIB-VI: R2=0.8365, IV-VI: R2=0.7894, V-VI: R2=0.8544, Ternary IIB-VI: R2=0.9366, Ternary IIIB-V: R2=0.9174), implying that bandgap decreases with increasing bond length. To confirm the validity of the trend, a chalcogenide glass with composition of (Ge0.5Sn0.5)(Se0.5Te0.5)2 was synthesized via quench melt. Its bandgap was obtained via FTIR spectroscopy and matched to the predicted value. IR results for (Ge0.5Sn0.5)(Se0.5Te0.5)2 indicated the bandgap to be 1.3-1.7 eV, which is close to the predicted 1.9 eV value. The close match confirmed the validity and accuracy of using bond length to predict semiconductor bandgap energies.

SYNTHESIZING BIOGENIC COMPOUNDS FOR THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE AQUEOUS SUZUKI-MAYURA REACTION: A NOVEL GREEN CHEMISTRY APPROACH
Nayif Sohail Alhomoud
Dhahran Ahliyya School, Dammam, Eastern, SAUDI ARABIA

The Suzuki-Mayura cross-coupling reaction is one of the most powerful and versatile methods to form C-C and C-X bonds. However, this reaction typically employs organic solvents, which pose risks to health, safety and environment. The purpose of this project is to maximize the sustainability and efficiency of this reaction. Towards a "green chemistry” approach, five biogenic palladium catalysts were synthesized. The novelty in the catalysts is the ligands applied, which were synthesized from five different amino acids: alanine (a), valine (b), leucine (c), isoleucine (d), and methionine (e). The activity of these catalysts was investigated for Suzuki-Mayura cross-coupling reaction in aqueous medium. To synthesize the catalysts, condensation reaction was applied to amino acids with glyoxal and formaldehyde in water to form imadazolium salts (1a–1e). The imadazolium salts were esterified with trimethylsilyl chloride in methanol (2a–2e). The esterified compounds reacted with silver oxide to form silver carbene complexes (3a–3e), which underwent transmetallation with PdCl2(CH3CN)2 to obtain the desired chiral palladium catalyzed complexes (4a–4e). The catalyzed complexes were fully characterized by NMR. They were active in Suzuki-Mayura cross-coupling reaction in water under microwave conditions, with complex (4a) reaching outstanding yields of 99% based on the GC Analysis with excellent activities characterized by TOFs > 750 s-1 and TONs > 1’000’000. This research can lead to potentially beneficial applications including sustainable synthesis of drugs and organic light emitting diodes. To broaden the scope \ of our catalysts, further research includes carrying out asymmetric catalysis using our chiral catalyst precursors.

USING A NOVEL METHOD TO SYNTHESIZE SILVER NANOSPHERES FOR OPTICAL VIABILITY AND COST EFFECTIVENESS
Mohammad Jamal Al-Sharif
Najd National School, Riyadh, SAUDI ARABIA

Plasmonic nanostructures have shown to be a powerful platform in the manipulation of light. In plasmonics, metal nanostructures can serve as antennas to convert light into localized electric fields or as waveguides to route light to desired locations with nanometer (nm) precision. This research developed new methods to synthesize more efficient and larger silver nanospheres. Silver (Ag) was chosen as the plasmonic nanoparticle due to its strong optical response and cost effective qualities. Because of that, studies have been developed for characterizing Ag in many different shapes such as nanocubes, nanospheres, nanorods and many other structures. Silver nanospheres with the size of 250-350nm were found to be promising shapes to enhance light applications. The procedures began by chemically synthesizing silver nanocubes with the size of 50 nm. The Ag nanocubes accounted for almost 90% of the solution. After that, the synthesized Ag nanocubes were used as seeds to grow larger cubes (250-350 nm). Finally, the edges of the Ag nanocubes were etched to gain Ag nanospheres. The dimensions of the silver nanocubes and spheres were confirmed using the Ultraviolet Visible Spectroscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy. The positive outcomes of this innovative method can be used to increase the absorption of solar cells or other light applications. Silver, when reduced to nano dimensions, is prone to oxidation; therefore, in future studies the silver nanospheres need to be coated with a silica shell in order to prevent them from interacting with the environment.

THE SYNTHESIS OF THE NOVEL ORGANOCATALYST, PENTANIDIUM, TO EFFICIENTLY PRODUCE D- FORM AMINO ACIDS
Dana Abduladhim Abdullatif
Dhahran Ahliyya Schools, Dammam, KSA, SAUDI ARABIA

Catalysts currently used to synthesize D- Form amino acids are expensive due to their sensitivity to moisture –H2O- and oxygen, limited substrate scope, high PTC loading, and toxicity. Analysis of conventional Phase- Transfer Catalysts (PTCs) has shown using long hydrocarbon chains is the cause to most disadvantages. Therefore, the purpose is to create a novel efficient organocatalyst, also taking into consideration the industrial and environmental perspectives. Pentanidium was used as a substitute organic catalyst because it gains its properties due to its asymmetrical structure, its inorganic ions, and functional groups containing fluorine or trifluorocarbonate. <br><br>After conducting the synthesis twice, through five phase-transfer reactions, using diphenylethanediamine as a precursor, Pentanidium is efficiently synthesized. Thin Layer Chromotography (TLC) and Nuclear Magentic Resonance (NMR) spectra were conducted regularly through every reaction of the synthesis. <br><br>Scientifically, objectives are met (consumed material/ reactants) and steps are reduced, where yield after finalizing the synthesis is 5.183 g/ 5.61 g x 100= 93% meaning that only 7% of reactants is loosed throughout the synthesis. Industrially, cost of the synthesis is merely 484 Euros of one container for every reactant. Environmentally, PTC is less toxic (less hydrocarbons involved). <br><br>In conclusion, pharmaceutical industries can depend more on Pentanidium, capable of producing D- Form amino acids. These amino acids are crucial; they are the initial and activating ingredients of pharmaceutical products, as well as cosmetics and, and even detergents.

DETERMINING THE QUANTUM LIMIT OF PALLADIUM AND GOLD NANOMETALLIC SUPERCATALYST BY KINETIC METHOD
Mai-Anh Nguyen Vu
McNeil High School, Austin, TX

Soluble metallic nanoparticles are considered as “supercatalysts” because they have superior properties of both a homogeneous and heterogeneous catalyst. Supercatalysts are of great interest in oil refinery, fine chemical synthesis, and drug manufacturing. Theorists have predicted that metallic nanoparticles change its state due to quantum effect at size below 200 atoms. To test this theory, I developed a kinetic method to measure this effect. G6-OH PAMAM dendrimers were used to make gold and palladium nanoparticles of uniform size ranging from 10 atoms to 250 atoms. Catalytic effect was measured on the conversion of nitrophenol to aminophenol using UV-vis spectrophotometer measured at 400nm. To deduce the result, I calculated the kinetic efficiency, which I define as the kinetic rate per volume, of my data. Palladium shows a maximum kinetic efficiency at 80 atoms in size. Above 80 atoms, the kinetic efficiency drops exponentially as expected due to a decreased in surface to volume ratio. Below 80 atoms, the kinetic efficiency drops off precipitously by as much as 12X at 10 atoms in size. A similar curve is shown for gold but with an optimal size of 110 atoms. Further calculations show that at its optimal size, Pd of 80 atoms is about 1.3 nm in size with 85% of the atoms at the surface, while Au of 110 atoms is about 1.5 nm in size with 80% of atoms on the surface. My experiment is the first to measure the optimal size of unsupported Pd and Au nanoparticles using kinetic method. The optimal size is the quantum limit in which metallic nanoparticles are transitioning into a nonmetallic state. The findings are significant because metallic nanocatalysts should be engineered at its quantum limit to achieve the best catalyst for the least amount of metal usage.

POLYOXOVANADATE-BASED SURFACTANTS: THE SEARCH FOR AN EFFECTIVE HETEROGENEOUS CATALYST
Joy Yiran Wang
Parkland High School, Allentown, PA

The goals of this research were to test the capability of polyoxovanadate-based surfactants to serve simultaneously as surfactants and catalysts and to determine the mechanism behind the process. It was found that compared to regular surfactants or catalysts alone, the polyoxovanadate-based surfactants were highly effective in catalyzing the reaction between thiophene and hydrogen peroxide, a potentially useful reaction in crude oil refinement. Experiments were carried out to study how the emulsions formed by polyoxovanadate-based surfactants impact their effectiveness as heterogeneous catalysts. It was hypothesized that increasing the surfactants’ total emulsion surface area will enhance their effectiveness in catalyzing thiophene conversion. Due to the ability of hydrogen ions to decrease repulsions between the negatively charged polyoxovanadate-heads, pH was chosen to regulate the total surface area of regular emulsions. Since it was difficult to measure the in situ emulsion surface area, self-assembled vesicles, similar structures to regular emulsions, were separately used to assess the effect of pH. As expected for the regular emulsions, increasing the pH enhanced the total surface area and reaction rate. The influence of the total emulsion surface area on the effectiveness of the catalytic surfactant was also supported by an unexpected result – the formation of reverse emulsions (for the double-tailed surfactant at pH levels below 5), which kept the interfacial area large and subsequently maintained the conversion rate at a high level, independent of pH. The results showed that increasing the total surface area of emulsions increased the thiophene conversion rate.

A NOVEL APPROACH TO TREAT DRY EYES EXACERBATED BY CONTACT LENS WEAR
Sravya Vishnubhatla
duPont Magnet High School, Louisville, KY

A significant number of people cannot tolerate contact lenses and almost all people who regularly wear contact lenses experience discomfort at one time or another. Contact lenses may be associated with discomfort related to dry eyes due to an increase in the evaporation of tears. This hypothesis was tested in vitro in a system devoid of the tear film lipid and its effect on evaporation. The evaporation rate through contact lenses was measured gravimetrically recording the weight of evaporation containers every 5 minutes for 45 minutes. Linear regression analysis was used to quantify the evaporation rate. The rates of evaporation through contact lenses were found to be significantly higher than those of buffer, and the rates of evaporation were not significantly different for worn contact lenses compared to contact lenses that were not worn. In an effort to reduce the rates of evaporation, contact lenses were equilibrated with steryoyl oleate, a natural tear film lipid, DuraSite with and without the preservative BAK (benzalkonium chloride), and squalene, a natural triterpene. DuraSite is a topical treatment for dry eye. Contact lenses with steryoyl oleate created no difference in the rate of evaporation and contact lenses with DuraSite BAK surprisingly increased the evaporation rates. Squalene significantly lowered the rate of evaporation. To begin to work towards a potential treatment for the contact lens intolerance, it could be beneficial to study various relatives of squalene and test the success in vivo.

FABRICATION AND MANIPULATION OF ONE-DIMENSIONAL PHOTONIC CRYSTALS
Michael Leonard Janner
Redlands East Valley High School, Redlands, CA

Photonic crystals have been the subject of intensive research during the last two and a half decades due to their usefulness in controlling the flow of light. More recently, there has been interest in creating photonic structures that can be controlled with external stimuli. The objective of this experiment is to fabricate iron oxide nanocrystals and use them as building blocks for magnetically responsive photonic structures. <br><br>Iron oxide nanocrystal clusters were fabricated through the hydrolysis of iron chloride and coated with a layer of silica through a modified Stöber method. This silica layer was then made porous through etching by water. Upon application of an external magnetic field, the superparamagnetic nanocrystal clusters aligned into dynamic chain-like structures with regular interparticle spacings, causing them to diffract light. The diffraction wavelength of the photonic chains could be tuned across the visible spectrum by varying the magnetic field strength. The porous silica layer significantly improved both the stability and the order of the photonic crystals, increasing the diffraction intensity to nearly 70%. <br><br>At increased concentrations, the chains assembled into photonic labyrinthine structures with lengths of up to 3-4 mm. These photonic labyrinths are very promising, as their assembly can be manipulated in order to create labyrinths with a wide range of morphologies which can be retained for further use by a secondary silica coating. The photonic crystals have a fast and fully reversible magnetic response, making them ideal for applications such as color displays, antifraud devices, and military camouflage.

ANALYZING THE OPTICAL AND ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES OF VARIABLE DEPOSITION VOLUMES OF CARBON NANOTUBES TO OPTIMIZE THE EFFICIENCY OF THIN-FILM PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS
Danten Rand Masaji Inouye
Waipahu High School, Waipahu, HI

This project is to collect experimental data on the change in optical and electrical properties of a carbon nanotube thin-film as its thickness increases. This project is significant because carbon nanotubes are highly conductive and can increase the efficiency of thin-film photovoltaic devices. Various concentrations of carbon nanotubes in a thin-film solution prior to spray deposition will affect the performance of the material once made. Analyzing the individual properties of each will help to predict the ideal concentration of carbon nanotubes to optimize the efficiency of the thin-film. I predicted that a relationship exists between the individual properties of carbon nanotubes and a photo-emissive solution, and that those similarities can be used to express the optical and electrical properties when those two solutions are mixed. To test, I measured the resistance and light transmission of variable thicknesses a carbon nanotube thin-film. I analytically confirmed a relationship exists between the resistance and light transmission, two main properties that affect the efficiency of a photovoltaic cell. The findings are significant because mathematically predicting the range for an optimum efficiency will reduce the time needed for experimentally determining the ratio of concentrations to make the most efficient photovoltaic cell using carbon nanotubes.

THE SYNTHESIS OF CROSS-LINKED PEI POLYMERS IN ORDER TO AID IN THE EFFICACY OF GENE TRANSPORT TO CANCEROUS PC3 CELLS
Kapil Ashok Kanagal
Brophy College Preparatory, Phoenix, AZ

Gene therapy takes advantage of polymers to transport DNA to the nuclei of cancerous cells in order to be expressed by these cells. The primary objective of this study was to determine if the synthesis of a cross linked polymer between polyethylenimine and resorcinol diglycidyl ether at various concentrations would be an effective polymer in gene therapy. Background research showed that these two polymers could be a very effective method of cancer treatment if cross-linked in order to reduce the toxicity of polyethylenimine. The polymers were first synthesized and then characterized by processes like DLS size analysis and zeta potential charge analysis. The polymers then formed polyplexes with pGL3 DNA and were then transfected into cancerous PC3 cells. These cells were then lysed and the expression of the gene was read by using a luciferase assay to determine the amount of luciferin substrate that was catalyzed by the luciferase enzyme produced by the cells, from the pGL3 gene. These results were then normalized by a BCA assay, which determined the amount of luciferase produced in each well of a plate. The luciferase data for each polymer was compared to a control standard of branched PEI in order to determine each polymer's efficacy. Each polymer also was tested at polymer:DNA ratios of 1:1 and 5:1 in order to determine which polyplex ratio would be the best to transport DNA to the cells to be expressed. The results showed that a PEI:RDGE 1:15 polymer at 1:1 polyplex ratio was the most effective, followed by PEI, then PEI:RDGE 1:20- 1:1 ratio. The rest of the samples were less efficient than PEI and thus would theoretically not be as effective in vivo as the standard.

NEW BIOCIDE HYBRID MATERIALS BASED ON MESOPOROUS SILICA AND SILVER NANOPARTICLES
Sergey Usoltsev
School No. 6, Ivanovo region, RUSSIA

Nowadays nanoparticles attract much attention of researchers because of their unique physical and chemical properties. Silver is known to have a broad spectrum of antimicrobic action, drastically increasing when particles of 1 up to 100 nm sizes are formed. Therefore, one of the most important synthesis problems is to obtain stabilized nanoparticles of a predetermined size for successful application in medicine. Stabilization can be achieved by immobilization of silver in the polymer matrix. The most promising technology is the sol-gel synthesis because of the simplicity and accessibility of the material.<br><br>To obtain such hybrid materials we elaborated several technics of nanosized silver particles immobilization directly into the matrix of silicon oxide. Silica was chosen due to its high physical, chemical and thermal stability. Preparation of silver is based on the reduction of Ag in alkaline medium. Solution of glucose ("green" reducer) was used as a reducing agent.<br><br>Dimensional, morphological and spectral characteristics of the synthesized materials are determined. The formation of nanosized silver particles of spherical shape can be justified by the positions of the peaks in optical absorption spectra of hybrid material (400-460 nm). <br><br>The obtained samples were examined by atomic force microscopy and powder x-ray method. The regularities of the preparation conditions influence on the material dimensions and morphology of the particles are stated. <br><br>Bactericidal action of the synthesized materials was discovered in vitro (using E. coli, Salmonella, Staphylococcus). It is proved that biocide action of synthesized materials is much greater than that of silver.

INTERCALATION OF A FERROCENE DERIVATIVE IN ZIRCONIUM PHOSPHATE LAYERS
Francisco Roberto Martinez
Colegio Radians, Cayey, PUERTO RICO

Zirconium bis (monohydrogen orthophosphate) monohydrate) is a highly hydrated phase of zirconium phosphates (ZrP), known as the 10.3 Å phase. ZrP is an inorganic compound, and throughout the years many applications have been developed based on it. The purpose of this research involved the intercalation of a ferrocene derivative, Fc-4Br, into the 10.3 Å phase of ZrP as a host for bioactive species for potential applications as drug carrier. Ferrocene is an example of a metalloccene compound and several metallocene derivatives have proved promising as anticancer drugs. Therefore this research has also as an objective the study of intercalated nanoparticles of these materials for possible new nanotherapeutics. The intercalation procedure of Fc-4-Br was performed using 5 different molar ratios and maintaining the reaction mixture for 5 days in constant agitation at room temperature. FTIR spectroscopy and UV-vis spectrophotometry characterization methods were performed to the intercalated materials. Fc-4-Br:ZrP materials shows a similar spectrum to that of the Fc-4-Br non-intercalated complex. Both results suggest that the chemical nature of the Fc-4-Br is not altered within ZrP upon intercalation. Hence it is concluded that ZrP is a suitable material for the intercalation of the ferrocene derivative Fc-4-Br. The results of this investigation also indicate that Fc-4-Br could be use as a drug carrier, to improve cancer treatment drugs selectivity. In addition, unlike other metal complexes such as platinum, it is economic hence its use would benefit both medically and economically.

CREATING AND OPTIMIZING POROUS MOFS FOR THE CAPTURE OF CARBON DIOXIDE FROM FLUE GAS MIXTURES
William Weili Xu
Princeton High School, Princeton, NJ

Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas identified as a contributor to global warming. In order to lessen the amount of carbon dioxide emitted to the atmosphere, and slow down global warming, two issues must be addressed. First, CO2 must be taken from the air in a low cost and energy efficient manner. Second, the captured CO2 must be converted into materials or fuel. This project focuses on researching the first aspect: making materials for capturing CO2 from flue gas mixtures by adsorption-based separation methods. Such methods have the advantages of being applicable over a broad range of temperature and pressure, and having low energy penalty. To make such a process practical, it is essential to develop cost effective adsorbents with high selectivity and capacity, especially at relatively low pressures (e.g. ~0.1-0.15 atm, the partial pressure of CO2 in flue gases). <br><br>Recent research shows that porous metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging as a promising family of such adsorbents. This project centers on the design, synthesis, and optimization of MOFs for selective adsorption of CO2 over N2 in flue gas mixtures. Solvothermal and solution growth methods are employed to synthesize and grow crystals of M2(hfipbb)2(ted) [M = Co, Zn; H2hfipbb = 4,4'-(hexafluoroisopropyl idene)bis(benzoic acid); ted = triethylenediamine], and to modify Cu3(TDPAT)∙(H2O)3 [H6TDPAT = 2,4,6-tris(3,5-dicarboxylphenylamino)-1,3,5-triazine]. Structural and thermal properties are analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). This study demonstrates that enhanced interactions between CO2 (adsorbate) and frameworks (adsorbent) may be achieved by modifying the MOF structures and composition, leading to higher carbon dioxide uptake selectivity and capacity.

DOES CHEMICALLY LIGHTENING AFFECT THE STRUCTURE OF HUMAN HAIR?
Christina Kim To
Grayson High School, Loganville, GA

The purpose of my experiment was to anwer the quetions: Does the result of elasticity and strength vary wtih hair pigmentation? Does the exposure to heat vary with hair color? In order to collect data, I experimented using the P&C Experiment, which consisted of using individual hair strands with one end attached to a desk ledge and the other to a foam cup. A ramp was constructed to evenly distribute the pennies. I was found that black/brown hairs were able to support the most weight of pennies, while blond hair the least. BL/BR hair was able to support the most due to its course texture and great diameter. The heat experiment, where hairs were exposed to 5 minutes fo blow-drying, produced the results of BL/BR hairs supporting the most weight; blond the least. (P&C Experiment method used to gather result)In the correlation of the P&C Experiment to the Heat Experiment, it was shown that all the hairs did not follow the theoretical menas as results for bleaching experiments-contained "shifts." BL/BR hair contained 2 increases. Blond hair contained 3 increases. Red hair only contained one increase. Therefore, pheomelanin, most dominant in red hair was a stable pigment molecule because it allowed the red hair to most similarly produce the theoretical results. Blond hair, which originally was able to support the least amount of pennies, comprises of little amounts of bloth eumelanin and pheomelanin;therefore, based on the overall proportions of pigment, experienced the least stability to the bleaching and heat effects.

NANO ZERO VALENT IRON: SOLUTION FOR COLOURED WASTEWATER REMEDIATION.
Gargi Pare
St. Mary's Convent Senior Secondary School, Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, INDIA

Complete degradation of synthetic textile dye Direct Blue-1 has been studied in a batch reactor. The disappearance of the dye has been monitored spectrophotometrically. It has been found that nano zero valent iron (nZVI) in its reduced form could only decolorize the dye but constant oxygen purging led to complete oxidative degradation of DB-1. The complete degradation of the dye was tested with the help of UV Spectra and by determining in situ generated carbon dioxide.<br><br>Further in order to increase the recyclability of nZVI, its bimetallic particles using copper were prepared and thus the reusability went up to six times making the process still more cost effective. The presence of NaCl, an essential mordant used in the dying process, in the effluent matrix increased the degradation efficiency. Optimization of nZVI amount and pH variation has been studied.<br><br>This method was compared with another GREEN technique, photocatalytic degradation process using BiOCl as a photocatalyst in presence of visible light. The present method has been found to be faster, safer, and cost effective.

Nagano Yashirro High School, Chikuma, Nagano, JAPAN

Finding that electric power was generated by the combination of yoghurt-calcium hydroxide, we were interested, how the power was developed and examined the role of each component in the power-generating system. These efforts led us to a successful construction of a set-up which was composed of aqueous calcium hydroxide solution as cathodic solution and yoghurt as anodic solution, which were separated by a cellophane membrane, and both solutions holding carbon textiles as electrodes.<br><br> The following data were obtained at 32C for the set-up：anode was made of yoghurt (LB81 low sugar) and the cathodic solution was saturated aqueous calcium hydroxide. The results showed 374 uA short-circuit current, 378mV open-circuit voltage, and 34.7 h time of current appearance. These performances of our cell are concluded to be comparable with the published data for ordinary biological cells known up to date. The output decreased considerably when cathodic solution was exchanged to neutral solution from calcium hydroxide solution.<br><br> We conclude from the results that power generation is induced by the microorganism included in the yoghurt which acts upon lactose, and calcium hydroxide permeated from cathode side promotes the generation by controlling pH to an appropriate condition for the microorganism to work well.<br><br> We will continue this work in order to understand better the mechanism of electric power generation in our biological cell, which will allow us to design and construct a more efficient set-up.

DEPOLYMERIZATION OF CHITIN USING IONIC LIQUIDS
Vivian Vu Ho
Murphy High School, Mobile, AL

Due to the current depletion of petroleum, scientists are turning to more environmentally friendly sources of producing feedstock chemicals, which are used to manufacture plastics. One potential solution to this is chitin. The experiment aims to test the depolymerization of chitin using Ionic Liquids (IL), which will hopefully break human dependency on petroleum by replacing petroleum with the renewable natural resource of chitin. <br><br>When depolymerizing chitin, which ionic liquid catalyst design, will hydrolyze chitin the most efficiently into its monomer unit N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (NAG), a catalyst containing a propyl chain paired with a triflate (CF3SO3-) anion, a propyl chain paired with a hydrogen sulfate (HSO4-) anion, or a heptyl chain paired with a bis(trifluoromethane sulfanyl)imide (NTf2-) anion? The experimenter predicts the CF3SO3- catalyst to yield the greatest percent conversion into reducing sugars when tested over time in a 1% solution of chitin.<br><br>For the experiment, the IL catalysts were synthesized by a chemical reaction and added to a 1% chitin solution. During depolymerization of chitin, samples were drawn over a six hour period, subsequently diluted, and analyzed using a UV-Vis Spectrophotometer. Stock solutions were tested with differing concentrations of NAG to produce a linear plot needed to calculate the percent conversion of chitin.<br><br>According to the results, the highest percent conversion of chitin into reducing sugars was for catalyst CF3SO3- at 30.35%; the hypothesis was proven correct. Therefore, the project opens the scientific field to the study of ionic liquids and chitin as a “green” solution to the production of plastics.

VERSATILE TRANSFORMATIONS OF CHLORINATED FULLERENES FOR BIOMEDICINAL APPLICATIONS
Anastasiia Iurkova
Municipal Budget Educational Institution "School No.51" Bryansk, Bryansk, RUSSIA

Selective derivatization of fullerenes with multiple organic addends is a big challenge for chemists.Availability of isomerically pure halofullerenes inspired researchers to perform their functionalization by replacement of halogen atoms with organic functional groups.R.Taylor investigated reactions of C60Cl6 with C- and O-nucleophiles:aromatic hydrocarbons, MeLi and alcohols.But,all these reactions exhibited insufficient selectivity and required exhaustive HPLC separation for isolation of the target products.We have investigated the reactions of C60Cl6 and C70Cl10 with a range of S- and P-nucleophiles.It was revealed that C60Cl6 reacts with thiols and trialkylphospites with excellent selectivity thus producing C60(SR)5H and C60[PO(OR)2]5H, respectively. These compounds were isolated in high (80-95%) yields using flash chromatography or even by conventional workup.Chlorofullerene C70Cl10 produced C70(SR)5H via unprecedented pathway involving multistep addend elimination, isomerization and substitutiopn reactions. Arbuzov type reaction of C70Cl10 with P(OEt)3 yielded C70P(O)(OEt)2H and C70[P(O)(OEt)2]2H as the only isolable products.Molecular compositions and structure of >20 novel compouds were confirmed by ESI mass spectrometry, 1H,13C,31P and 2D NMR srectroscopy.Single crystals of C60[SCH2COOEt]5H and C60[PO(OEt)2]5H suitable for diffraction analysis have been obtained.Novel reactions discovered for C60Cl6 and C70Cl10 opened up new pathways for preparation of water-soluble fullerene derivatives on a large scale. In-vitro assays performed by our collaborators revealed potent antibacterial and antiviral (herpes simplex and human immunodeficiency viruses) activities of the synthesized fullerene derivatives.These results might lead to valuable pharmaceutical applications.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL SUTURES THAT STORE AND DELIVER NITRIC OXIDE FOR WOUND HEALING
Kevin Anh Nguyen, Punya Chittajallu, 
Plano East Senior High School, Plano, TX

Nitric oxide (NO) is a free radical diatomic molecule that plays an important role in the transmission of neurological pathways, regulation of platelet aggregation, and promotion of vasodilation. The controlled storage and release of NO can be applied to promote wound healing and inhibit the development of bacterial infections. However, an important application as well is the area of surgical securement, which there are currently no commercially available products. This research focuses on the development of novel surgical sutures that are capable of releasing therapeutic concentrations of NO when subjected to humidity. Polyacrylonitrile-co-1-vinylimadiazole (AN/VIM) sutures were synthesized by a meltspinning process and compared to AN/VIM fabrics created from an electrospinning process. Upon contact with controlled humidity, meltspun fibers released more µmol/g of NO than electrospun counterparts as a result of thermal stabilization. With the addition of biodegradable polycaprolactone (PCL) coatings, release durations were prolonged to several days, which is essential for clinical applications. The tensile strength of the sutures was tested to be significantly stronger than commercial sutures, which thus can be used for sewing. In this research, novel sutures capable of exogenous NO drug delivery were developed to promote wound healing and prevent postsurgical complications.

Alkourah Pioneer Center, Irbid

This study aimed to develop a new model of galvanic cells, which are small scale, low coast and environmentally friendly and to study the effect of solution volumes and solution concentrations on the galvanic cell potential. Copper wires and galvanized nails were used as metal electrodes with known concentrations of CuSO4.5H2O and ZnSO4.7H2O.The results showed that the average of generated potential of small scale galvanic cell was 1.027 volt when the solutions concentrations was 1M for each solution. Besides, as the concentration of CuSO4.5H2O and ZnSO4.7H2O decreased, the generated potential difference from the galvanic cell decreased clearly too, whereas the average of potential difference decreased from 1.083to 0.786 Volt when the concentration of CuSO4.5H2O and ZnSO4.7H2O decreased from 1M to 0.001M for each solution. On the other hand, regarding to the cost of the new cell, there is a clear difference in the cost of one experiment; the cost of one experiment is 0.13$ for the small scale galvanic cell, while 14.72$ for the traditional galvanic cell, which shows a big gap in the experiment cost. As well as the new galvanic cell is environmentally and economic by 99.5% with 05 of pollutants and can save99.5 % of water.

The purpose of this experiment was to test whether cow urine and its individual components had any effect on the fire retardant properties of cotton fabric. The components of cow urine tested were urea, potassium, phosphate, and sodium chloride. This experiment had real world relevance in that it explored the area of less hazardous and less deadly fire retardants. Modern fire retardants are known to cause cancer and other serious health problems, this experiment was an attempt to find an organic fire retardant that would replace the main-stream carcinogenic fire retardants (Bryan Walsh). <br><br>In this experiment, five different treatments were used, along with a control, to test their fire retardant properties. The treated pieces of fabric were tested for the time embers appeared and the total consumption time. Along with the analysis of variance, ANOVA, statistical test, the observations further concluded that the ammonium phosphate was the best fire retardant, followed by sodium chloride and potassium chloride.

The purpose of this project is to further develop understandings in the nanotechnology area, through the Layer-by-Layer technique— a method used in chemical engineering, biomedicine, biochemistry and biotechnology— by checking if using Polyethyleneimine (PEI) as a pre-coating polymer would enhance the assembly between a polyanionic and a polycationic polymer, Hyaluronic Acid (HA) and Chitosan (CHI), respectively, with the substrate, a glass slide, due to the presence of secondary amine groups in PEI’s structure. <br><br>In order to run the experiment, tests were done with one and fifteen Polyelectrolyte Multilayers (PEMs). They were built both by hand and by a machine called NanoStructure Pro. The films were analyzed by perfilometry and by AFM topography to determine the thickness and roughness of each slide. Besides, some of the specimens were immersed in Methylene Blue to confirm the presence of unprotonated carboxylic groups. <br><br>Although the data collected contains a complexation between the cationic and anionic polymers, the results obtained show that according to the average roughness and thickness of the slides, PEI is a viable alternative for the construction of PEMs, since it indeed enhances the assembly between HA and CHI with the substrate, the glass slide. <br><br>The conclusions obtained were that the PEI can possibly be a successful option for the formation of PEMs and therefore, as a future experiment, the incorporation of gold nanorods will be alternated with CHI solutions for the next PEMs created, and subsequently they will be heated by infrared light, to generate a more localized treatment for cancer.

AN ANALYSIS OF CIS, TRANS-FAT CONTENT IN VARIOUS FRANCHISES' FRENCH FRIES
Trisha Kaye Ramsdell, Hunter Ward, 
Kalamazoo Area Mathematics and Science Center, Kalamazoo, MI

This project was designed to rank five different franchises’ french fries based on healthiness. This ranking was determined through the analysis of fat content. With the various health problems today’s generation faces, such as childhood obesity, it is hoped that this research may inform the consumer about what they are ingesting in regards to the five different franchises tested. Grams of fat per gram of fry was determined through the process of fat extraction. The extracted fat was then analyzed through the use of NMR spectroscopy to determine the presence of cis and trans fats in the fat samples obtained. Though the amount of cis and trans fat was not quantified in this experiment, the presence of cis and trans fat was acknowledged through NMR. Bromination verified these results. Interestingly, this project demonstrates the presence of both cis and trans fat in all of the franchises’ fries. This contradicts claims made by franchises, such as McDonald’s, that their fries contain no trans fat, and raises the question of possible isomerization in the frying process. Bromination provided a method to determine the level of unsaturation, in the hope to discover which brands may contain more trans fat in their fries, as trans fat is the unhealthiest type of fat. The final ranking of the least healthy to the healthiest french fries was McDonald’s, Arby’s, Wendy’s, Culver’s, and lastly, Burger King. Furthermore, the results may help consumers to make educated choices when choosing to eat at one of the five franchises tested.

ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTION OF OCTANE BY USING IONIZED CARBON
Ahmed Hany Abdelrahman, Mahmoud Refaat Ahmed, 
Talented Athletes School - Nasr City, Cairo, EGYPT

This project researched the possibility of producing hydrocarbon fuels using an available and cheap raw material such as graphite. When the graphite was vaporized using a CO2 laser and Helium as a carrier, the optimal yield of the sublimation process was found to be about 4% by mass of the vaporized charge. Then using an electron gun, the yielded carbon atoms were ionized twice, where 25eV was used for the 2nd ionization. The ionized carbon atoms were then entered into a chamber filled with hydrogen, where the hydrocarbon compound was formed and then converted from gas state into liquid state by applying pressure to it. So the research proved that the hydrocarbon fuels can be easily produced if a renewable source of energy is utilized.

Nanotechnology studies matter at the level of atoms and molecules. Most synthesis methods of silver nanoparticles are expensive and have a negative impact on human health and on the environment. It is important to find environmentally friendly, simple, and inexpensive synthetic routes. The purpose of this research is to synthesize silver nanoparticles using vitamin C, which is cheap, readily available and harmless to humans and environment. The hypothesis formulated was that it is possible to obtain silver nanoparticles using vitamin C. In this study, ascorbic acid acts as a reducing agent, and silver as oxidizing agent. Molarities in different concentrations of PVP, AgNO3 and Vitamin C result in solutions of different characteristic colors which indicate the formation of silver nanostructures. The formation of nanoparticles was monitored by ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy (UV-Vis), with which was observed the characteristic absorption spectrum of silver nanoparticles, located between 400 - 450nm.<br><br>After completing the experiment and analyzing the results, it was found that ascorbic acid is an effective reducing agent for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles. It was also found that there was a direct relationship between ascorbic acid concentration and the concentration of silver nitrate in the size of the obtained silver nanoparticles.<br><br>This study is important because the wide applications of silver nanoparticles, for example, in the design of more efficient solar cells, in which using semiconducting polymers, including small pieces of silver, are able to absorb solar energy and generate electricity in a more efficient and economical way than conventional methods.

DETERMINING IF THE KHLOR GEN. 3000 PRODUCES ENOUGH CHLORINE TO STERILIZE WATER
Brice Nelson Plein, Nick Whitcomb, 
Burlington Community High School, Burlington, IA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine if the Khlor Gen. could produce a constant concentration of chlorine high enough to sterilize water. The Khlor Gen. 3000 is device that uses electrolysis to produce chlorine that is utilized to sterilize water. By pouring a salt brine solution, made up of NaCl and water, through the device, a chemical reaction causes the bonds between NaCl to break leaving chlorine isolated. To determine the concentration of chlorine, titrations were done. The titration was conducted by adding .5 ml of the Khlor Gen. solution to a flask with water and color indicator. Silver nitrate was placed in a 50 ml burette; the volume in the burette was recorded and was then titrated with the mixture in the flask. The titration was finished when the color in the flask turned a light maroon. As a comparison, bleach was titrated following the same process except 1 ml of bleach was titrated, not .5 ml. The data recorded during titration was used to calculate molarity. The Khlor Gen. data and the bleach data were then compared. The bleach data should to keep a consistent concentration that was concentrated enough to sterilize water. The Khlor Gen. solution had an average molarity much higher than the bleach but was more inconsistent than bleach. The data was suggesting that the Khlor Gen. did not produce a concentration that was consistent and also had a low concentration due to the silver nitrate reacting with the NaCl and sodium hypochlorite.

DEVELOPMENT OF A CHEMICAL TREATMENT TO MAKE MATERIALS HYDROREPELLENT
Aldo Cingolani, Roberto Fasano, Andrea Paladini
Liceo Scientifico Statale "Cosimo De Giorgi", Lecce (LE)

Cellulose is the most abundant organic compound on Earth. Its fibers are used for the production of many technological products with everyday use, such as paper and packaging products, membranes, medical supplies, textiles etc. Despite their current large scale use, the durability of the cellulose fibers is strongly limited by water/humidity absorption, which eventually leads to their degradation, constraining also the expansion of their use towards new applications. The main purpose of our project is to develop a simple, cheap, post production process to make cellulose fibers water proof. The process is based on impregnation of the fibers with cyanoacrylate/acetone solution by immersion or drop casting. Upon evaporation of acetone in the presence of environmental humidity the cyanoacrylate monomers polymerize forming a thin protective layer around every single fiber, and not an overall coating on the treated material, preserving the optical and mechanical characteristics of the latter. This polymer cladding formed around each fiber turns the cellulosic materials from water absorbing into water repellent. The hydrorepellency can be further enhanced by incorporating Teflon particles in the solution, due to the intrinsic highly hydrophobic character of Teflon. A quantitative assessment of the hydrophobicity was obtained by water contact angle measurements on pure cellulosic paper, showing angles up to 115° after its treatment. Our method can be applied to any cellulose fibrous material after its production (tissues, fabrics, different papers). Since cyanoacrylate polymers are biocompatible and biodegradable the cellulosic materials treated with the presented method are environmental friendly and retain their biodegradability.

Tsun Hong Wai, Lui Yat Man Edmond, Yuen Kin Hong
King's College, Hong Kong, HONG KONG

Inspired by the Nobel Prize in 2000, we tried to investigate into conducting polymers. Among them, we chose polyaniline because of its wide range of potential applications.<br><br>In the project, we investigated into the synthesis of polyaniline of different conductivity and the effect of acid or alkali on it. We found that small molecular size of polyaniline results in higher conductivity, and size of molecules is dependent on the environment during the synthesis. It was found that high temperature, absence of stirring and one pot addition of reagents result in smaller molecules.<br><br>Furthermore, we investigated the effect of acidity on the conductivity of polyaniline. The conductivity of polyaniline increases in acidic medium while it decreases in alkaline medium. Based on the above property, three generations of gas sensors were invented. The first one is a stationary one for detecting harmful gases in factories. The second one is a mobile gas sensor. The final generation is a multi-detecting gas sensor that makes use of an electronics prototyping platform to show the results and connect to safety systems like alarms and rolling doors.<br><br>The gas detector is able to detect hydrogen chloride, ammonia, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, chlorine and hydrogen sulphide gas. Resistivity of polyaniline changes significantly in less than 30 seconds when the above gases are detected. The response time is short. In the investigation, the sensors made by 2 cm x 2 cm polyaniline strips have the detection limits of 1000 ppm, 1000 ppm, 5000 ppm, 10000 ppm, 30000 ppm and 30000 ppm for ammonia, hydrogen sulphide, hydrogen chloride, sulphur dioxide, chlorine and nitrogen dioxide gas respectively.

THE NEW MAGIC FORMULA FOR ELIMINATING BAD BREATH: C42H70O35
Gabriel Alexander Salg, Nicolas Scheidig, 
Hanns-Seidel-Gymnasium Hosbach, Hosbach, Bavaria, GERMANY

Many people are classified as halitosis patients by their dentist. Halitosis can be fought by killing the bacteria in the oral cavity or with absorption agents that bind the odorous substances. Our goal was to mask the primary odorous substances of halitosis with cyclodextrin and document the efficiency of the method through scientific experiments. In doing so, we intended to focus on hydrogen sulfide and its organic methyl derivatives. These chemicals had not yet, however, been used to fight halitosis. Our experiments concentrated on their absorption by water compared to aqueous cyclodextrin solutions in the chemical laboratory and on bad breath from the oral cavity in the dental practice. Using the school gas chromatograph and a GC/MS device combination at university, we were able to verify that cyclodextrin solutions can absorb volatile sulfur compounds 40-60% better than normal water. Using a halimeter in a dental practice, we were able to penetrate the ppb range and to confirm previous results from the human oral cavity and with real halitosis. Using a mouthwash containing α- and ß-cyclodextrin, the cleaning effect was in excess of 80%. Also garlic odour is eliminated with great effectiveness. We are especially pleased to have been the first to have synthesised the host-guest complex of the α-cyclodextrin with H2S, CH3SH and (CH3)2S. Contributing to its positive characterisation are 1H-NMR-spectrographic and X-ray diffraction examinations as well as the determination of the complexing constants.

In 21C, so-called 'Information age', information is getting more important. But the encryption cannot effectively prevent information from leaking as development of computer science, many methods of encryption are in danger for leaking. Therefore out team intends to make more strong and creative method of encryption by adding chemical characteristics of material in existing encryption. Metal complex solutions have different maximum absorption. The maximum absorption gets changed by oxidation state and kinds of center metal, species and steric conformation of ligand coordinating center metal not their concentration. So using these varieties of the maximum absorption, complexes can become media of information delivery. Our team plans the three experiments about different variables that changed maximum absorption and start the research. We synthesizing [Co(NH3)6]3+ by substituting the ligands of [Co(H2O)6]2+, measured maximum absorption of [Co(NH3)6]3+ . We could get different maximum absorption of [Co(H2O)6]2+. The second is synthesizing supramolecular complexes, which is not werner complex. Metal complexes can have isomers like organic compounds. Also they have different maximum absorption. What it means is that Chemical encryption can express a lot of information. We observed how maximum absorption changes over time. For We measured maximum absorption while [Co(NH3)6]3+is into [Co(H2O)6]3+and we could observe maximum absorption changing. As a result, we found it possible to add a concept of 'time' in encryption. This research try to encrypt by new method using property of complex not mathematics or informatics methods and can expect developments of encryption through suggest possibility of 'chemical encryption' that fusion of chemistry and informatics.

LUMINESCENCE IMPROVEMENT OF LANTHANIDE COMPLEXES
Michaela Krakorova
Gymnasium Brno-Reckovice, Brno, CZECH REPUBLIC

Lanthanide complexes are intensively studied for their luminescent properties. My motivation was to prepare new compounds of europium with P–N–P ligands. Such complexes create miniature “antenna systems”, resulting in extension of luminescence lifetimes. Thanks to that they effectively convert light to different frequencies. These properties predetermine them to a wide range of applications. <br><br><br>The syntheses I made were based on the reaction of 1 molar equivalent of europium or praseodymium nitrate with 3 molar equivalents of a deprotonated ligand in methanol. Then I investigated their luminescent properties in both solid state and solution. Furthermore, syntheses of C–N–P ligands were performed via reactions of organic amides and diphenylphosphinic chloride in presence of bases and tetrahydrofuran. <br><br><br>Two novel molecular structures of praseodymium complexes were determined by X-ray diffraction. Interestingly, the lanthanide center provided 8 coordination bonds in contrast to related compounds with coordination numbers 6 or 7 only, meaning that more ligands bind to the central atom. Moreover, one novel molecular structure of C-N-P ligand was described. The most important result was the extension of luminescence lifetimes in europium complexes.<br><br><br>In conclusion, novel lanthanide complexes were prepared, their molecular structures determined and luminescent properties examined. Luminescent compounds have an important impact on development of new photonic devices and optoelectronics. Lanthanide compounds in general could eventually become a more effective alternative to gadolinium compounds used as contrast substances in MRI diagnostics. Their luminescent properties also predetermine them as prospective chemical sensors in analytical chemistry and molecular biochemistry

RARE-EARTH-DOPED AMORPHOUS CHALCOGENIDES IN PHOTONICS
Jan Hrabovsky
Gymnazium Josefa Ressela, Chrudim, CZECH REPUBLIC

The work deals with the preparation of efficient phosphors based on amorphous chalcogenides doped with rare earth ions operating from near infrared to mid infrared spectral region and with the photon energy conversion from infrared to visible spectral region. All materials were synthesized by the melt quenching technique from high purity elements sealed at residual pressure of 10-3 Pa in silica glassy tubes which were subsequently exposed to 970 °C for 24 hours. The melt was quenched into water and annealed near of glass transition temperature to release mechanical strains.<br><br>Photon up conversion and photoluminescence (PL) were studied in Ga Ge Sb S amorphous chalcogenides doped with rare earth (RE3+) ions such as Pr3+, Nd3+, Dy3+, Ho3+, Er3+, Tm3+ and Yb3+. Both up conversion and photoluminescence spectra were measured under excitation by Ti:sapphire tunable laser or by diode laser. Photon up conversion was observed e.g. for Er3+ doped Ga Ge Sb S amorphous chalcogenides in the visible (2H11/2 --> 4I15/2, 4S3/2 --> 4I15/2, 4F9/2 --> 4I15/2) and near infrared (4I9/2 --> 4I15/2, 4I11/2 --> 4I15/2,) spectral regions under 802 nm or 1.55 μm pumping, respectively. Photoluminescence emission was observed in near infrared and mid infrared (2.7 μm emission from Er3+: 4I11/2 --> 4I13/2 transitions) spectral regions. <br><br>These phosphors are potentially applicable in lasers, telecommunication, sensors, LIDAR technology or to improve the silicon solar efficiency. The efficiency of silicon solar cells is limited but other enhancement can be improved by using of up converters. The up converter layer should be deposited on the rear side of a bifacial silicon solar cell.

FLUORESCENT DETECTION OF ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANT MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS
Neha Bhaskar
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, FL

Mycobacterium Tuberculosis is one of the most deadly diseases worldwide. According to the CDC, it has been the cause of death of nearly one third of the world’s population, and remains prevalent. Most frequently, this disease is treated using antibiotics, one of the most common being Rifampin. However, increased numbers of cases reveal that some species’ genomes code for resistance to Rifampin, so this treatment fails. Fluorescent detection using molecular beacons can help identify Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in the genomes of such patients. It is these single variations in the genome that are the sites that indicate Rifampin resistance. The single DNA stranded, pin shape of the molecular beacons, when bound to a complimentary analyte strand, unzips and attaches to the analyte causing the fluorophore and the quencher to migrate to opposite ends of the beacon. When combined properly, the fluorometer detects high fluorescent signal from the sample since the quencher can no longer quench the fluorescence emitted by the flurophore. To test different mutations on the oligonucleotides, three adaptor strands, the molecular beacon, and the analyte strand are combined to test the formation of the tri-component probe. In the presence of the wild type strand, the complex will not form, producing low fluorescence, but with the mutant strand, the complex forms and produces high fluorescent signal. This widely accepted, cost effective, and highly specific method is used for early detection of Rifampin resistance in patients infected with Mycobacterium Tuberculosis, using fluorescence as an indicator of the presence of a mutation in the genome. This innovation will hasten the diagnostic and the treatment process for patients infected with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

MOLECULAR HYDROGEN AND FAR-ULTRAVIOLET EXTINCTION DUE TO DUST: A TWO-YEAR STUDY
Marianne Virginia Konikoff
Saint Joseph's Academy, Baton Rouge, LA

The purpose for studying the correlations between molecular hydrogen levels, dust characteristics, and extinction curve parameters is to observe and analyze the full sample of molecular hydrogen in a large number of sightlines to determine relationships, strengthen previous observations, identify outliers, and provide for future research. The hypothesis states that the abundance of molecular hydrogen should be correlated with the amount of dust and extinction along a given sight line through space with few outliers and will be correlated with other parameters such as temperature and density of the interstellar medium. I wrote Interactive Data Language scripts to plot the parameters and levels of dust, gas, and extinction, and analyzed the resulting plots, best-fit lines, and statistics. A majority of the plots presented statistically significant positive relationships, but the relationship between dust grain size and amount of extinction was negative. This research shows that multiple measures of extinction positively correlate with other levels of extinction, dust and gas densities, and other parameters. However, the relationship between reddening and size of dust grains presents a negative correlation, as expected. Additional analysis of previous data shows that a wide range of environments could account for the range of column densities, a different slope for higher-extinction sightlines may be present as a result of changing dust properties, and different types of hydrogen may exist in different environments. These results support the research hypothesis and lead to rejecting the null hypothesis. The findings of this project are consistent with previous research on the subject.

PROCEDURES FOR SEPARATION OF VOLATILE OILS
Michael Laue
Europagymnasium Walther Rathenau Bitterfeld, Bitterfeld, GERMANY

This project is the result of experimentation on different procedures for separation of volatile oils of chamomile flowers. The initial idea was to compare various procedures by investigating two chamomile species and to discover a procedure, which gains the volatile oils as gentle as possible (e.g. for more effective medications). <br><br>At first the already known processes for the separation of essential oils were analyzed and compared: steam distillation (common method), Micro – Water – Distillation (only small amounts) and extraction with organic solvents. <br><br>According to the results of the different experiments a new innovative procedure, with a quality never reached before, was invented. Hot Carbon Dioxide (CO2) flows through the shredded flowers and evaporates the essential oils. The mixture of gaseous oil and the CO2 streams through an organic solvent. The volatile oils were dissolved and the CO2 escapes. <br><br>The samples of the four different procedures were analyzed by Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC). Large differences in chemical composition were determined between the samples, especially shown at the sample from the CO2 procedure. <br><br>Additionally the samples were examined by Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). This analysis showed, that the new procedure is more gentle and produces a more natural oil than the other procedures do, because the CO2 prevents oxygen contact, no water is required and the temperature is lower (167°F) than the standard steam distillation (212°F).<br><br>The project´s contribution is a gentle procedure for separation of volatile oils in superior quality and a more natural composition for the medicine of the future.

CATALYSIS IN ORGANIC CHEMISTRY: A NEW COMPOUND AS POSSIBLE CATALYST
Dominik Spors
Gymnasium Martino-Katharineum, Braunschweig, GERMANY

The project demonstrates results of experimentation with organometallic ``sandwich´´ compounds. These compounds were Ferrocene and Troticene. My first idea was to compare both substances regarding their obvious differences like color (includes contemplations of the energy levels of the bonding electrons), spectra and differences in their ring systems (e.g. energy and length of the bonds). This differences should be supported by selected reactions: The robustness of the ring was researched by an Acetylation. The diversity of scopes of the mixed ring-system in Troticene was researched by Lithiations. Then I turned my eyes to the catalysis: Exspecially the scope of Ferrocene and Troticene in the chemical industry is limited. That is because the reaction conditions are hard to realize cheeply, further Troticene is difficult to produce in mass. However, there was a possibility of use: Due to the high reactivity of Troticene it has a higher affinity to catalyse reactions selectively. Therefore it is possible to produce the important catalyst prestage BINAP in higher enantiomeric yield. At least I polymerized ring-closing products (ring-systems bridged by silicon) of Ferrocene and Troticene. The most evident fact was that the Troticene-polymer has the opposite of characteristics effectively: The Ferrocene polymer forms tiny surfaces which are interesting to use as possible semi conductor materials whereas the Troticene polymer forms blue pyrophoric crystals.

My problem is to see how does the density of wood affect the BTU (British Thermal Units) value.<br><br>First I get the wood that is cut to the same size. Then I place 50ml of water in a flask. After lighting the wood (one at a time) I place the flask on the fire and start the timer. I then take temperature rise every 30 seconds until fire goes out. Finally I record all information.<br><br>My hypothesis was correct the cypress wood created more BTUs. It burned longer due to the medium density. <br><br>My opinion is: That if this was done on a larger scale the lignum vitae would create more BTUs because the lignum will burn better on a larger scale.

THE EFFECT OF THE PHOTODEGRADATION OF IBUPROFEN AND DISSOLVED ORGANIC MATTER (LAKE SUPERIOR AND ST. LOUIS RIVER WATER) ON A LAKE SUPERIOR MICROBIAL ISOLATE: PHASE V
Angela Brooks Moynan
Cloquet Senior High School, Cloquet, MN

Ibuprofen can enter bodies of water—such as Lake Superior—via waste water treatment. When photodegraded, dissolved organic matter (DOM) becomes biologically active and stimulates bacterial activity (Moran and Zepp, 1997). The question was: What effect does the photodegradation of ibuprofen and DOM have on a Lake Superior Microbial Isolate? Ibuprofen concentrations of 7,500, 15,000 and 30,000 µg/L were made from lake, river and MilliQ water. Three thousand milliliters of each concentration, as well as controls, for each water type were poured into six, half-pint, wide-mouthed canning jars (500mL each). Of the six trials for each concentration, three were placed in a 257nm light cabinet, while the other three were placed in a dark cabinet where all samples remained for three days. After the exposure period, a UV-Vis spectrophotometer was used to determine DOM molecular mass as well as the summed absorbance of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). A Lake Superior microbial isolate was then exposed to MilliQ and lake water concentrations of 15,000 and 30,000 μg/L (and controls with no ibuprofen); establishing a protocol for use by the research institute to determine photodegradation effects on bacterial growth. This study indicates ibuprofen is utilized by bacteria when there is no other carbon source available (milliQ water). Also, the isolate showed significantly higher colony counts in the lake water ibuprofen concentration of 30,000µg/L exposed to light, than the lake water control (no ibuprofen), thus signifying bacteria utilize photodegraded ibuprofen. Therefore, the isolate could possibly be a future waste water treatment additive.

CARBON ENCAPSULATED IRON NANOPARTICLES FOR CATALYTIC CONVERSION OF BIOMASS DERIVED SYNGAS TO LIQUID FUELS
Wenhao Yan
The Mississippi School for Mathematics and Science, Columbus, MS

Biomass is a potential alternative to conventional fuel sources and offers other benefits if converted into energy through pathways that are economical and efficient. Carbon encapsulated iron nanoparticles (CEINs) were prepared and used as a catalyst for converting syngas derived from wood chips through the gasification process. The performance of this material as a catalyst for the syngas to liquid fuel process was evaluated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry data on carbon selectivity. The effects of temperature and pressure on the production of liquid fuels from syngas over the catalyst were also evaluated. Carbon black from Cabot (Billerica, MA) with particle size of 20-50nm and a surface area of 254 m2/g was used as the support. Iron promoted carbon black was prepared by an incipient method. The syngas conversion reaction was carried out in a fixed-bed reactor system. Biosyngas produced through a gasification process and oak-tree wood chips were used as the feedstock. The experiments were carried out in a 12 mm (i.d.) stainless steel tubular reactor. For all reaction experiments, three grams of CEINs were loaded to the reactor. The system was purged by a helium flow for 30 min, followed by pre-reducing with a syngas mixture at 400 °C for 2 h. The catalysts showed remarkably high activity and selectivity to liquid hydrocarbons. CEINs showed high catalytic efficiency, with CO conversion and C1 - C5+ selectivity for six temperature levels increasing from 80.1% at 250 oC to 93.5% at 350 oC.

SYNTHESIZING LIGHT HARVESTING COMPLEXES FOR HYDROGEN FUEL PRODUCTION
Stacy M. Ho
Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science, Denton, TX

With the amount of fossil fuels ever decreasing, the need for alternative sources of energy has become apparent. Consequently, much research has recently been dedicated towards the conversion of solar energy into a fuel via artificial photosynthesis, which utilizes solar energy to split water into oxygen and hydrogen. The goal of this particular project was to synthesize a photosensitizer for capturing sunlight and hence powering the artificial photosynthesis system responsible for splitting water. Two Ruthenium polypyridine complexes were successfully synthesized from the starting compound 1,10-phenanthroline through multiple intermediate steps. To synthesize and purify the complexes, various organic chemistry laboratory techniques were utilized, including refluxing, hydrogenation, vaccuum filtration, rotary evaporation, recrystallization, column chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, distillation, extraction, and washing. Properties of these complexes were then analyzed by NMR spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, UV-vis spectroscopy, and theoretical yield calculations. NMR spectroscopy confirmed the molecular structure of the complexes. The absorption spectra from UV-vis demonstrated the ability of both Ruthenium complexes to absorb visible light, thus making them promising photosensitizers.

FINGERPRINTS: WHICH TECHNIQUE USED TO FIND LATENT FINGERPRINTS IS THE MOST EFFICIENT?
Mai See Moua
Harding High School, Saint Paul, MN

The purpose of this experiment is to determine which fingerprint technique is the most efficient to find latent fingerprints. To complete this experiment, the technique of using aluminum powder on dark surface areas and lifting the prints with clear tape, the technique of using iodine crystals to see the appearance of prints on the surface of paper, and Cyanoacrylate fuming to see how super glue can make a latent print visible to the naked eye. Through these experiments, data were collected and compared in the categories of quality, quantity, and time required. According to the data collected, Cyanoacrylate fuming was a good technique but the problem with this technique was that it depends highly on the amount of drops of superglue and the position where the glass slide containing the print is placed. As for aluminum powder, the experiment was easier than the other methods, but this technique depended on the type of brush used, the brushes use can smear the print and make it unreadable. The last technique, iodine fuming was an experiment using iodine crystals in a closed container and inserting a piece of paper with a latent print to discover how much time it takes for the iodine to react to the amino acids from the print. A challenge with this technique is that time matters, if the print spends too much time with the iodine crystals in the closed container the print will become over developed and no longer in good use.

A NOVEL, FACILE TWO-STEP ORGANOCATALYTIC ASYMMETRIC SYNTHESIS OF THE MYRISTININ CORE
Louis Tao
Louisiana School for Math, Science, and the Arts, Natchitoches, LA

The Petasis coupling reaction, a multicomponent reaction (MCR) involving boronic acids, aldehydes, and amines, has been useful in the synthesis of biologically active compounds, some of which exhibit potent medicinal application. In a recent study, the original Petasis reaction was amended to include styryl substituted boronates in place of boronic acids, for a more strongly catalyzed reaction, and chiral organocatalysts to allow the reaction to occur with high stereoselectivity. In this study, a derivative of the optimized reaction was developed with the substitution of sesamol in place of the secondary amine reagent. A relatively inexpensive material, sesamol undergoes a nucleophilic addition with a selected aldehyde to generate a highly reactive in-situ ortho-quinone methide. This intermediate, along with the chiral catalyst, then forms an irreversible carbon-carbon bond with the boronate to generate a chiral compound that can then be diastereoselectively cyclized with copper (II) bromide to generate the substituted chroman structure at the heart of the flavan class of Myristinins in high enantiomeric excess. These flavan compounds have been shown to exhibit COX-2 inhibition as well as some antifungal activity against Candida albicans. In addition, the ability of some of these compounds to cleave DNA Polymerase beta, an essential DNA repair enzyme, and damage DNA lays groundwork for their potential application to tumor treatments.<br><br>Herein, a versatile multicomponent reaction was developed and used as part of a novel synthetic strategy for the core structure of the biologically significant Myristinins.

ELECTROCATALYTIC ACTIVITY OF PD-NI NANOPARTICLES DISPERSED ON GRAPHENE ELECTROCHEMICALLY EXFOLIATED FROM GRAPHITE OF USED BATTERY
Emmanuel Joseph Macuha Magnaye
Taguig Science High School, Taguig, PHILIPPINES

Graphene is a promising electrode catalyst support for use in fuel cells because of its unique electrical conductivity and low production costs. This study, as part of a bigger project of a university research group working on graphene, aimed to investigate the synthesis and characterization of nanostructured Pd and Pd-Ni electrocatalysts dispersed on graphene as potential anode materials in direct ethanol fuel cells. The graphene was exfoliated electrochemically from graphite rod of a used battery. Pd and Pd-Ni nanoparticles were dispersed on graphene using borohydride-facilitated reduction. Scanning Electron Microscopy of graphene showed the stages of the exfoliation process of graphene from graphite. Atomic Force Microscopy analysis revealed a rough morphology of graphene and bright spots appearing as protrusions could be attributed to the metallic particles Pd or Pd-Ni dispersed on graphene. Cyclic voltammetry results of both metal-graphene-supported catalysts demonstrated electrocatalytic activity towards ethanol oxidation. Pd-Ni/graphene showed higher reactivity towards ethanol oxidation than Pd/graphene catalyst (1.058 mA/cm2 versus 1.037 mA/cm2 peak current density and -0.57 V versus –0.55 V onset potential).<br><br>This study showed that graphite rod from used battery is a good and inexpensive source of graphene. The electrochemical method effectively exfoliates graphite into graphene. Pd-Ni on graphene support is an effective anode catalyst for the electro-oxidation of ethanol, making it a promising anode material for use in direct ethanol fuel cell.<br><br><br>Keywords: ethanol oxidation, direct ethanol fuel cell, Palladium catalyst, Pd-Ni, electrocatalyst

INVESTIGATION ON THE SEPARATION AND RECOVERY OF RARE EARTH ELEMENTS FROM THE WASTE PHOSPHOR
Jian Shen
The Affiliated High School of Peking University, Beijing, CHINA

At present time, large amount of waste rare earth fluorescent lamps are treated simply as common solid waste, which leads to not only the environmental pollution, but also the waste of resources. Since the rare earth is an important strategy material, the recovery of this secondary resource from the waste phosphor has been received worldwide attention. In this work, we firstly performed composition measurements and structural characterization of the waste phosphor using X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). We then developed a new technology named “quicklime roasting-acid leaching-enrichment-cascade extraction”, by which the rare earth elements could be separated and recovered efficiently from the waste phosphor. Four steps were included: (1) roasting the waste phosphor at high temperature in the presence of CaO and the flux CaCl2; (2) leaching of rare earth elements by acid; (3) further enrichment of rare earth elements; (4) calculating and optimizing the technology parameters of the cascade extraction. The main rare earth elements Y, Tb, Eu, Ce, La in the waste phosphor could be separated one by one. The cost estimation suggested that the above new technology is worth performing practical application. Also, the new technology meets the idea “greenness, low cost, low consumption”.<br><br>Keywords: rare earth, waste phosphor, roasting, cascade extraction, acid leaching

MAGIC TEST PAPER: FORMALDEHYDE TEST KIT DERIVED FROM NATURAL BLUE PIGMENT OF CLITORIA TERNATEA FLOWER EXTRACT
Hani Devinta Sari
63 Senior High School, Jakarta, INDONESIA

Formaldehyde is an hazardous chemical and toxic to human body. The effects of formaldehyde vapors on health have been the subject of much discussion. Formaldehyde can be detected with laboratory test, but it takes long time and the procedure was not efficient. The simple test of formaldehyde has been discovered by using the natural blue pigment of Clitoria ternatea flower extract as indicator. Clitoria ternatea a perennial twinning herb, grows widely in tropical countries like in Indonesia. Water soluble anthocyanin of Clitoria ternatea (CT) flower extract has been prepared for magic telang test paper (MTTP). To discover the anthocyanin compound, this extract was analyzed by spectrophotometry and purifed by chromatography colomn methods.<br><br>Results showed that the MTTP sensitive to pH changes. The blue paper changes to pink when liquid pH < 7. The paper remaining in blue color when liquid pH = 7. The blue paper changes to green when liquid pH > 7. Specific to formaldehyde test, the blue paper changes to purple. Spectrophotometry data of blue pigment of CT flower extract showed the maximum wavelength (λ) was 619 nm. This pigment (1%) was added by 0.1%-5% of formaldehyde and its absorbances was measured at 620 nm. The data showed that the highest absorbances was found after added by 0.4% of formaldehyde, and the absorbances decreased gradually by increasing of formaldehyde concentration. We predicted that the concentration of formaldehyde higher than 0.4% will changes the λ max, and the color of blue pigment will changes to purple. According to chromatography (LCMS) data, pure pigment from CT flower has molecular weight was 515.3.

SYNTHESIS OF SIZE- AND PHASE-CONTROLLED IRON OXIDE NANOPARTICLES VIA CONTINUOUS, ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE MICROPLASMA: AN EFFICIENT SOURCE FOR INNOVATIVE BIOMEDICAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
Aric Generette Floyd
Hawken Upper School, Gates Mills, OH

Microplasmas are a unique class of atmospheric-pressure plasmas that create non-equilibrium conditions and thus have unique but largely unexplored potential for nanomaterial processing. This project was the first to synthesize monodisperse iron oxide nanoparticles using such a medium. Ferrocene vapor, an organometallic precursor, was dissociated in a microplasma consisting of argon gas mixed with small quantities of oxygen and sustained with a constant direct current at ambient conditions. Freed iron atoms then nucleated as nanoparticles before flowing out of the microplasma, with an in-reactor residence time of approximately 1 millisecond. Downstream, a commercial scanning mobility particle sizer system measured the diameter of as-synthesized nanoparticles in-situ. A linear relationship was established between nanoparticle size and the amount of ferrocene and oxygen added to the gas mixture at a fixed ratio. Particle distributions with average diameters as small as 4.28 nanometers were achieved, with an error range of approximately 1 nanometer. Furthermore, X-ray diffraction indicated that the magnetite, maghemite and hematite crystal forms were all present in filter-collected samples. It is hypothesized that these polymorphs can be isolated for by varying the relative flow rates of ferrocene and oxygen or by separating particles in the gas stream post-synthesis using a magnetic field. Since the unique properties of iron oxide nanoparticles, including superparamagnetism, depend on both diameter and crystal structure, this novel method of size and phase control with precision unattainable by typical chemical techniques is a promising avenue toward large-scale synthesis for applications in a variety of fields, including photoelectrochemistry and biomedicine.

AN INEXPENSIVE AND ULTRA-COMPACT RAMAN SPECTROMETER FOR REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS
Jack Thomas Andraka
North County High School, Glen Burnie, MD

Raman spectroscopy is an important tool for quickly identifying molecules through the vibrational information obtained when a sample is excited by laser irradiation. However, traditional Raman spectrometers are expensive, bulky, and require specialized training. An inexpensive, palm-sized, Raman spectrometer is described and applied to medical diagnostics and environmental monitoring. An inexpensive laser diode operating at 532 nm was used to induce Stokes scattering in samples. Digital planar holograms were then used to consolidate the optical components into easy-to-align, compact elements. The laser beam was passed through the first hologram to purify the laser light and then reflected off the second hologram, which acted as a dichroic mirror. An inexpensive lens was then used to focus the light onto the sample and to collimate the returning light. the sample was placed on an SERS substrate architecture consisting of a dense three-dimensional cavity nanoantenna array coupled with plasmonic nanodots, achieving an SERS enhancement of 3.1 x 10^9. After passing through the dichroic mirror, the scattered light passed through a second lens, which focused the light onto the third hologram, which acted as the notch filter, slit, and diffraction grating. An inexpensive CMOS device compatible with a mobile phone was used to detect the signal. The device costs $15, is 200 cm^3, and has the following limits of detection: 0.1 fg/mL for mesothelin, 0.156 ng/mL for glucose, and 25 ag/mL for atrazine. This makes it over 7,000 times less expensive, over 1,250 times smaller, and 400 times lighter than current Raman systems.

PHOSPHORUS ANALYSIS OF FALMOUTH'S COASTAL WATERS
Lucas Daniel Repeta
Falmouth High School, Falmouth, MA

<br><br> Phosphorus is one of the primary nutrients essential for organisms to grow and reproduce. In nature, phosphorus occurs as phosphate (an inorganic salt) and as organophosphorus compounds. Both forms of phosphorus are found in aquatic systems in very low concentrations, and as a result, phosphorus often limits ecosystem productivity. Humans contribute significant amounts of phosphate through the use of consumer products, especially fertilizers. When these contaminants make their way into ponds, lakes, and oceans, there is the risk of eutrophication, large blooms of algae and bacteria that overwhelm the ecosystem. <br><br> Numerous studies have been done on local (Falmouth, MA) ponds to determine water quality, but these studies have focused on nitrogen levels while phosphate concentrations have been largely ignored. This study provides data on phosphate concentrations in local ponds. Concentrations were expected to be higher in ponds near densely populated areas of the town, while ponds distant from populated areas were expected to have lower concentrations.<br><br> Spectroscopic analysis of a phosphorus-molybdenum complex was used to measure the phosphate concentrations. Results were compared based on geographic locations of the sampling sites. <br><br> While the data set was limited, it suggests that areas with a high population and development density have larger concentrations of phosphate, while areas away from population centers have lower concentrations of phosphate. The data set was too small to conclude that development has contributed to phosphate contamination, but it does encourage further study to examine the impact of human derived phosphate on aquatic ecosystems.<br><br>

TOWARDS NEXT-GENERATION NANOMATERIALS: ATOMISTIC, FIRST-PRINCIPLES ANALYSIS OF N-DOPED REDUCED GRAPHENE OXIDE
Shyamal Buch
Vista del Lago High School, Folsom, CA

The development of next-generation carbon-based electronics hinges on the ability to tune the properties of nanomaterials such as reduced graphene oxide (rGO). Research has demonstrated that nitrogen doping (N-doping) of rGO is a viable experimental technique. However, the underlying mechanisms of N-doping have not been elucidated. Fundamental insight into the formation and resulting properties of N-doped rGO is needed to direct and optimize synthesis and applications. In this work, an atomistic approach was used to investigate the synthesis of N-doped rGO. Classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provided new insights into potential reduction mechanisms. Quantum mechanical density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to create models of N-doped rGO. Density of states models revealed the impact of different bonding configurations of nitrogen on the electronic structure. Analysis of first-principles models elucidated the impact of pyridinic and quaternary nitrogen on the bandgap and workfunction properties of N-doped rGO. These results can explain observations in published experimental data. This nanomaterial has the potential for revolutionary new applications, such as optoelectronics, novel sensors, biomedical devices, energy storage, and ultra-thin flexible solar cells.

ELUCIDATING THE LIGHT-HARVESTING MECHANISM OF HIGHLY EFFICIENT PORPHYRIN-SENSITIZED SOLAR CELLS
Jonathan Chan
William G. Enloe High School, Raleigh, NC

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are a promising way to convert visible light into electricity without the costs of silicon solar cells. DSSCs utilize dyes attached to a semiconductor that, upon excitation by visible light, transfers excited electrons into the semiconductor through a process called interfacial electron transfer (IET), generating electricity. YD2-o-C8, based on zinc tetraphenylporphyrin (Zn TPP), is the most efficient dye in DSSCs to date, reaching over 12% in power conversion efficiency. To understand the link between the structure and light-harvesting properties of Zn TPP dyes, we investigate three dyes that include various structural features found in YD2-o-C8. We employ time-dependent density functional theory to obtain the absorption spectra and quantum dynamics simulations to model the IET between dyes and a TiO2 semiconductor surface. We find that replacing two phenyl groups with a 4-ethynyl-benzoate and a diarylamine group attributes to the redshift and broadening of peaks in the absorption spectra of functionalized Zn TPP dyes. This also creates a new transition that leads to rapid IET rates. Overall, YD2-o-C8’s various modifications are found to contribute to both its favorable visible light absorption profile and faster IET rates, leading to the increased efficiency of YD2-o-C8 – sensitized solar cells.

INVESTIGATING METHODS FOR MEASURING PHOSPHORUS CONCENTRATIONS IN WATER
Benjamin David Brown
Lexington High School, Lexington, MA

Phosphorus (P) is the limiting nutrient for the growth of aquatic autotrophic organisms. Excessive P concentrations can lead to eutrophication, algal or bacterial blooms, and “dead zones” in freshwater bodies; thus, measuring P concentrations accurately is of the utmost importance to environmental stewardship efforts. <br><br>The purpose of this project was to investigate inaccuracies in and alternatives to the SMEWW (AWWA et al.) 4500-P E ascorbic acid method for measuring P concentrations. Testing examined which factors contributed most to significant error in the 4500-P E method, and how they might be addressed. <br><br>The 4500-P E method employs spectrophotometry, indirectly analyzing P concentrations by measuring the light absorbance of a water sample treated with a chemical mixture that reacts with P to form colorful particles. Readings are compared against a graph of absorbance data taken from samples of known P concentration. <br><br>Nevertheless, even when performed with the utmost precision, the 4500-P E method produced inconsistent and often inaccurate results. Test results showed that even for one sample, measured absorbance could deviate significantly over the interval of time (10-30 minutes) accepted for standard 4500-P E procedure. Changes to absorbance could skew a standard curve constructed with those measurements, which would not permit determination of an unknown sample’s P concentration. Data indicated that absorbance measurements stabilized at approximately 15 minutes after adding reagent, suggesting that taking all sample absorbance measurements at that time would ensure precise and accurate data collection. This finding should be further tested, and ultimately implemented into the 4500-P E method.

THE EFFECT OF ALPHA PARTICLES FROM AMERICIUM 241 ON THE SELF-DETONATION TEMPERATURE OF NITROGEN TRIIOIDE
Hannah Kurka Margolis
Elko High School, Elko, NV

This project studied the effect nuclear radiation in the form of alpha particles from Americium-241 on the self-detonation temperature of nitrogen triiodide. The experiment was based on former work done by G.H. Henderson in 1922 and F.P. Bowden in 1958, who showed that nitrogen triiodide could be triggered into detonation by being exposed to a stream of alpha particles. The compound is also listed in Wikipedia as the only material known to do so. Both papers suggested that these particles may locally increase the temperature in the regions of their passage leading to the explosive result. Based on this previous work I hypothesized that the temperature at which the nitrogen triiodide would detonate could be lowered if the explosive were subjected to a reasonably high flux of alpha particles. For this investigation I first determined the self-detonation temperature of nitrogen triiodide when heated on a metal hot plate. This yielded an average value of 44.5 °C. When the nitrogen triiodide was subjected to an alpha particle flux of approximately 2,626 particles/cm2-s, no appreciable change was noticed in this self-detonation temperature, with the average value being 44.7 °C. Since less than ten measurements of each configuration were made, I analyzed the results using Student T statistics. The outcome indicated that there was a 93% chance that the numbers from the two different categories would continue to have the same outcome even if more experiments were attempted. This disproved my hypothesis and seems to cast doubt on the suggestions by the mentioned scientists, who had concluded that alpha particles caused the self-detonation by increases in temperature alone. Next I hope to go back to my original project idea: the effects of Cosmic Rays on nitrogen triiodide.

Purpose of the Peoject/Experiment<br><br>Nanometric semiconductor quantum dots are nano-scale crystals with photo-electric properties that can be precisely tuned to a range of applications. These tiny particles have attracted attention in the past decade with the development of new colloidal synthesis processes that allow en masse and reproducible production of particles with specified properties.

PREPARATION OF SURFACTANTS MIXTURE FROM CASHEW NUT SHELL LIQUID AND CASTOR OIL TO COMBAT THE DENGUE MOSQUITO LARVAE
Gabriel Tiago Galdino
Escola Estadual Jose Maria Hugo Rodrigues, Campo Grande, BRASIL

Dengue is the most important mosquito-borne viral disease, affecting around 100 million people in tropical and subtropical countries. Considering that there is no consensus for ideal dengue treatment, an alternative is to reduce the incidence of the disease by controlling the vector. The control of A. aegypti is made using synthetic insecticides, which present disadvantages such as high toxicity to mammals and can cause mosquitoes resistance with recurrent use. Phenolic lipids as the ones isolated from cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL) are known to possess larvicidal activity. However, these compounds are not soluble in water. Therefore, I decided to conduct<br><br>saponification reactions with these natural products in order to obtain water-soluble salts. In the present work, I aimed to develop a mixture of surfactants from CNSL and castor oil. I could easily make sodium soaps in several concentrations of natural and technical CNSL. Subsequently, I tested the larvicidal activity against A. aegypti and the results showed that all compounds were active. The more expressive activity was for the product named as SOMA-LCCN 20%, at the concentration of 2 ppm that killed 97% of the larvae in the first 24 hours, while the surfactant from only castor oil showed the lowest activity. Toxicity studies will be carried out and the expectations are that the new larvicide will not present toxicity to humans at the employed concentrations, what can disclose real possibilities for its use as an efficient and low cost agent to combat the dengue vector.

CESDEF (COST EFFICIENT, SELF DIS-INTEGRATING, ECO FRIENDLY) PLASTIC BAGS
Haris Bin Ashraf
Defence Authority Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed College, Karachi, PAKISTAN

Plastic disposition has long been a serious problem for the Planet Earth. This research project aims to rectify the composition of Plastic bags, such that plastic bag disposition becomes easier and quicker. Therefore, CESDEF (Cost Efficient, Self Disintegrating, Eco-Friendly) plastic bags have been manufactured. These bags possess the ability to completely disintegrate when buried under the soil for 9-10 months. This ability of CESDEF bags is due to the presence of Zeolite. As Zeolite tends to decompose when it comes in contact with HEAT and MOISTURE; both these conditions are found abundantly beneath the soil. Therefore, when Zeolite decomposes, it acts as a catalyst to the decomposition of plastic bags. Through this ingenious method, CESDEF Plastic Bags have been found to completely decompose when buried under the soil for a period of approximately 9-10 months.<br><br>Another benefit of CESDEF Plastic Bags is that fruits can also be preserved for a longer time whereas fruits kept in regular polythene bags become rotten within a week. This is due to the ethylene absorbing abilities of Zeolite. When fruits ripen, they release Ethylene gas which is absorbed by the Zeolite. Therefore, fruits can be preserved in these bags for at least 1 month.<br><br>The main focus of this research project is the COST EFFICIENCY, which makes it perfect for global introduction.<br><br>Keeping these things in mind, if CESDEF Plastic Bags are introduced in worldwide markets, they will create a whole world of ease for the Homo-sapiens.

NANOSTRUCTURED CO3O4, COO AND CON AS HIGH CAPACITY AND LONG LIFE ANODES FOR LI-ION BATTERIES
Prithvi Gundlapalli
Saint Andrew's Junior College, Singapore, SINGAPORE

This project investigated bulk methods of preparing Co3O4, CoO and CoN in the form of nanoparticles/ nanorods, studied their electrochemical properties and evaluated their use as anode materials for Li-ion batteries. These materials have about 2.5 times the theoretical capacity of commercial graphite (372 mAh/g), making them excellent choices for anodes. We proposed simple methods to prepare these materials in bulk to test the viability of real-world application. CoO allows for Li2O and Co metal to form during discharge, allowing for a theoretical capacity of 715 mAh/g. Co3O4 allows for 4 Li2O and 3Co to form, and has a theoretical capacity of 890 mAh/g. CoN is theoretically the best of the three because nitrogen allows for Li3N and Co to form, resulting in a high theoretical capacity of 1100 mAh/g. Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area method, and gas pycnometry were used to characterise the materials. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic cycling experiments were conducted to analyse redox potentials and capacity fading respectively. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to analyse electrode kinetics and other characteristics. The observed reversible capacity of these compounds in descending order is CoO, CoN, Co3O4. Two Co3O4 batteries were tested at two different current rates for 60-70 cycles, whereas one CoO and one CoN battery was tested for 60 cycles each. Co3O4 showed almost no capacity fading, while CoO and CoN showed increasing capacities. CoO far exceeded theoretical capacity due to the electrocatalytic effect and the interfacial storage of lithium.

ELECTROSTATIC LAYER-BY-LAYER SELF-ASSEMBLY OF ANTIMICROBIAL FILMS
Thomas Grey Quesenberry
Southwest Virginia Governor's School, Pulaski, VA

In many areas clean water has become a challenge to obtain due to poor sanitation, the expense of purification methods, and the lack of resources at hand. The application of the well-established technique of Layer-By-Layer self-assembly, a process that creates multifunctional films by layering substances with alternating charges onto a base, was used address this issue. Moringa Oleifera Cationic Protein and a highly functionalized type of carbon nano-particles were selected for use in the layering process due to their well-documented purification properties and their ability to be derived from readily available substances. The spectrometry data collected showed that these substances could successfully be used to layer a film onto a Quartz slide with an average bilayer density of 0.44. The images of the coated and non-coated slides after soaking in E-coli contaminated buffer show a distinct increase in bacterial attachment and fatality rates for the slides coated in the film. These results suggest that all of the goals were met: a film was created form substances readily available using the process if Layer-By-Layer self-assembly, and the images captured from the microscopy show the anti-microbial properties of the film.

DESIGN AND SYNTHESIS OF NOVEL TETRAPHENYLPORPHYRIN-BASED METAL-ORGANIC FRAMEWORKS FOR PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY AND DRUG DELIVERY
Landon Yates Carter
North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, Durham, NC

In recent years, cancer has grown to be the third leading cause of death in the world. We aimed to synthesize two novel metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which would exhibit favorable properties for various forms of cancer therapy and imaging. Two novel and tunable 5,15-bis(4-methoxycarbonylphenyl)-10,20-diphenylporphyrin (L) based MOFs have been designed and synthesized. Tests to evaluate their potential applications in photodynamic therapy (PDT), drug delivery, and fluorescence imaging, have been completed, and have shown the MOFs to exhibit favorable properties for use in all of these cancer treatments and imaging techniques. Single crystal structures have been obtained for each, revealing isomorphic octahedral structures. Furthermore, one of the ligand precursors, FeLCl, has an activation wavelength for PDT further in the near-IR window of tissue transparency than all existing photosensitizers approved for use in the US as of 2009. This indicates that FeLCl could be used to extend the range of cancers PDT is capable of treating.

SWEET SILVER
Dean Raymond Jarois
Divine Child High School, Dearborn, MI

This investigation was carried out in attempt to produce silver colloids with a controlled conductivity for use in medical industries along with the commercial production of adhesives and conductive inks. The conductivity of silver colloids is not only indicative of particle size, but also zeta potential, Brownian motion, and several other factors. In this study, the production of these colloids relied on the production of Tollen’s Reagent, or diammine silver, from silver nitrate and ammonium hydroxide. This was reduced with six different saccharides: dextrose, fructose (levulose), galactose, lactose, ribose, and sucrose (non-reducing). Tollen’s Reagent was reduced using several different molarities of these sugars: .5 M, .25M, .1M, .05 M, and .025 M. In the end, it was noted that the ribose results in colloids with the highest average conductivity due to the large silver particles yielded. From lactose, the only reducing disaccharide in this experiment, a low average conductivity was produced. The lowest conductivity was received from sucrose, a non-reducing saccharide. Thus, it can be said that heavier saccharides result in smaller silver particles, and lesser conductivity.

THE HEATING AND RAPID COOLING OF TRIBOLUMINESCENT ZINC SULFIDE
Briston James Bruce
Aberdeen Central High School, Aberdeen, SD

The effect of triboluminescence is when an asymmetric crystal structure is cracked which then gives off energy in the form of light (Wu, 1997). In the 1980’s scientists discovered a strange light being emitted from deposits of Zinc Sulfide at the bottom of the ocean. Scientists theorize that this light is caused by triboluminescence due to the highly triboluminescent properties of this compound. Scientists noticed that these deposits were around deep sea vents. The theory of these scientists is when super-heated Zinc Sulfide is emitted from these vents comes in the contact with the cold ocean water the thermal shock causes the asymmetric crystals of this compound to crack (Zink, 1997). The purpose of this experiment is to prove that the light being given off at the bottom of the ocean is caused by the rapid cooling of Zinc Sulfide. The experiments performed consisted of heating up samples of Zinc Sulfide to approximately 600 degrees Celsius and cool them off quickly by dumping the samples into ice water at approximately 1 degree Celsius while recording the intensity of the light near the sample using a light sensor. In a dark room the sensor detected an illumination between 94 and 140 lux. When the heated Zinc Sulfide was added to the water the sensor detected an increase in Illumination to approximately 240 lux in the first trail, approximately 850 lux in the second trial, and approximately 1315 in trail three. These results show that triboluminescence could be the cause the lights in the ocean.

AN INVESTIGATION OF CELLULOSIC ETHANOL: OXIDATION OF HEMICELLULOSE AND LIGNIN TO ACHIEVE HIGH CONVERSION YIELDS OF CELLULOSE TO GLUCOSE
Hailey C. Loehde-Woolard
Pacific Collegiate School, Santa Cruz, CA

The purpose of this experiment was to compare my previously developed treatment process with recent developments utilizing an oxidizing agent to delignify wood pulp, and to adjust my methods in order to achieve the highest yield possible. I used unprinted newsprint as a model of hardwood and waste stream paper (it as the same concentrations of lignocellulosic materials). My process involved an alkaline, high temperature, moderate-high pressure, and microwave digestion process. I also used hydrogen peroxide to act as an oxidizer to delignify the paper in hopes of an increased conversion. For the control alkaline tests (without H2O2) I achieved similar results compared to previous years experiments. A conversion of about 47.99% cellulose to glucose was achieved. In the H2O2 experiment, I saw drastic changes. I achieved an average conversion yield of 95.36%, with my highest results being 99.89%. These results are higher than the scientific papers I consulted on the subject. In conclusion, I believe the changes in the conversion yields were due to the liquification of the other lignocellulosic materials in combination with my process. In the overall purpose of my endeavors, I believe that I have successfully found an adequate, feasible and high yielding procedure for the production of cellulosic ethanol on a large scale.

AN OPTIMAL DESIGN OF ELECTRODE SURFACE MORPHOLOGY TO IMPROVE WATER ELECTROLYSIS EFFICIENCY
Jaehyeong Lee
North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, Durham, NC

In this study, a new design of surface morphology was proposed to optimize efficiency. Reducing particle size does not affect efficiency as modifying the surface morphology to the proposed design. With nickel and specified pattern thickness, and by changing pattern size of the film, the new design has 13.4% more effective surface area compared to a simple pattern with straight side walls. To realize the proposed surface morphology, photoresist-patterned Ni electroplating was used. The surface morphology of the photoresist and resulting plated film were confirmed by SEM. To improve accuracy, Kelvin probe method was used to reduce effect of contact resistivity and external resistance of the system. For Ni electrode test, Ag/AgCl in 4M KCl solution was used as reference and Pt was used as counterelectrode. To see surface area effect quantitatively, sputtered Ni film was tested with Teflon tape as masking material to define active film area. The test system was accurate enough to detect the effect of bubble accumulation on the film surface . The Voltammogram was analyzed by using modified Butler Volmer equation with a series resistance. To improve accuracy of the analysis, a data-analyzing program was written to find resistance, rs (ohm), exchange current density, J0 (Amps/cm2), and charge transfer coefficient, a;. This new analysis method was compared with conventional method for validity. From this analysis, it was found that with the proposed surface morphology modification, the series resistance decreased 20.4% from expected value, which translated into a 25.6% increase in efficiency at given bias voltage.

This project is a solid-state synthesis experiment aimed at designing and synthesizing a new Zintl phase compound for thermoelectric power generation. Efficient thermoelectric materials must have high electrical but low thermal conductivities. Because of their rattling structure, type-I clathrates have low thermal conductivities; however, they also have low electrical conductivities. Using the Zintl-Klemm concept, potential new phases with a similar rattling structure and transition metals and incorporated into the framework were predicted. Transition metals have electrical conductivities orders of magnitude higher than those of tetrel elements Si, Ge, Sn in type-I clathrates. Samples based on those predictions were then synthesized in flux reactions and powder X-ray diffraction data analyzed. 2 new compounds, Cs(3x)Si(1-x)Cu(x)As2 and Rb(3x)Si(1-x)Cu(x)As2, were created with the same promising structure; Cs(3x)Si(1-x)Cu(x)As2 was later synthesized in the pure-phase. Analysis of crystal structure and comparison with the traditional tetrel type-I clathrate Cs8Si46 revealed a new framework with high concentrations of Cu and As and a similar vibrational structure with Cs atoms in Cs(3x)Si(1-x)Cu(x)As2. Based on this analysis, the new compound is anticipated to have a much higher electrical conductivity and still low thermal conductivity, making it an efficient thermoelectric material. This project developed a novel compound (and crystal structure) with potential in thermoelectric power generation and synthesized it in a pure form. Secondly, it demonstrates that framework-incorporation of transition metals is feasible by the Zintl-Klemm concept and a promising research direction for thermoelectric materials. Future experiments will characterize the zT of the new compound.

Brandon B. Cui
Hillcrest High School, Midvale, UT

Fruit peels have been used as an alternative sorbent for wastewater treatment and water quality monitoring. However, majority of work has been focused on wastewater treatment rather than preconcentrating heavy metals for the purpose of water monitoring. The objectives of this research project were (1) to screen biosorbents, e.g. banana peel, apple peel, and orange peel, in order to determine the maximum metals adsorption capacity of each biosorbent. (2) to select a biosorbent with the highest metal adsorption capacity and apply it for preconcentration and analysis of heavy metals in water.<br><br>The results indicated that the equilibrium data fits the Langmuir adsorpion isotherm model. The maximum adsorption capacity of heavy metals is 18.94 mg/g, 13.44 mg/g and 10.06 mg/g for banana peel, orange peel and apple peel, respectively. Banana peel was chosen as the sorbent packed in a column to develop a solid phase extraction (SPE) method for preconcentration of heavy metals (Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb) in water. The effects of eluent concentration and volume, sample volume, and interference cations have been evaluated. The method accuracy and precision, linearity, and detection limit have been tested. The detection limits of the method for Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb were 0.39, 0.94, 1.70, 2.11, 0.02 and 0.13 ppb, respectively. The enrichment factor of the method ranged from 10 to 62.5 and the column could be reused 10 times without loss its adsorption capacity. The method has been successfully applied to preconcentrate heavy metals in different water samples.

REACTION MECHANISM OF ZN-CU GALVANIC CELLS IN NACL SOLUTION
Sohma Takanari
Hokkaido Asahikawa Higashi High School, Asahikawa-City, JAPAN

It is surprising to make batteries using materials around us. In some food batteries, oxygen is reduced on the cathode. However, the reaction mechanism is not fully understood. In this project, the mechanism was investigated with Zn-Cu galvanic cells in NaCl solution.<br><br> The amount of dissolved oxygen in the electric solution was changed, and the results suggested that the electric current increased not only with the amount of dissolved oxygen but also with fine bubbles in the solution.<br><br> It was confirmed that oxygen coming from outside of cells is necessary in maintaining the reaction. In the cell where air was added by bubbling, the amount of current and Zn(OH)2 formed became lager than in the typical cell. In the degassed cell where oxygen was kept from being absorbed, their amounts decreased dramatically.<br><br> The cell reactions were visualized by using agar and phenolphthalein. In a petri dish type cell, ions spread gradually from both electrodes, and Zn(OH)2 was formed in the middle, where OH– and Zn2+ collided with. In a cylindrical type cell, the area around the copper wire turned red first, and then the red area caused by OH– spread in the upper part of the cell. This indicates that the reaction mechanism is as follows: dissolved oxygen reacts first, and then oxygen is absorbed from the atmosphere to maintain the reaction.<br><br> This research will be applied in engineering to create more useful cells, and novel scientific visual tools using agar will be familiarized to teach the interest of science.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF OPERATING CONDITIONS ON GAS TRANSPORT MECHANISMS THROUGH SAPO-34 ZEOLITE MEMBRANES
Michael Zhu Chen
Fairview High School, Boulder, CO

The demand for energy-efficient gas separation technologies has resulted in increased interest in SAPO-34 zeolite membranes. SAPO-34 is a crystalline molecular sieve with 0.38nm pores that can be grown as thin continuous layers on the inside of porous ceramic tubes to form a membrane. This study investigated the effects of operating conditions on gas transport through SAPO-34 zeolite membranes to determine the quality of the membranes, characterize transport mechanisms, and to evaluate separations of gas mixtures that are of commercial interest.<br><br> SAPO-34 zeolite membranes were used to separate gas mixtures at different operating conditions in a custom-built gas separation apparatus. The permeating gas was analyzed by the gas chromatograph. The permeances (flux normalized for pressure) and selectivities (ratio of gas permeances) were measured at different feed gas compositions, temperatures, and pressures to determine membrane quality, identify defects, and develop a model for gas transport.<br><br> Results indicate that the membranes are high quality with few defects and primarily separate by adsorption mechanisms and differences in molecular size. Decreased dependencies on operating conditions when compared to previous studies show that SAPO-34 membranes are suitable for operation under a wide range of conditions.<br><br> Notably, the results demonstrate that the newly synthesized SAPO-34 zeolite membranes are suitable for a variety of commercial gas separations, including natural gas purification, hydrogen purification, biomass gasification, and carbon sequestration. The use of SAPO-34 zeolite membranes in these commercial processes would allow for more energy-efficient and cost-effective separations when compared to conventional amine scrubber techniques.

ADAPTATIONS TO THE COMMON CAR BATTERY: CONCENTRATION CELL AND ALLOYED ELECTRODE MANIPULATION
Mikala Paula Cohen
Cypress Bay High School, Weston, FL

Lead-acid batteries, currently used globally in automobiles, are known to have low specific voltage, poor weight-to-voltage ratios and are environmental hazards for waste disposal. Experiments were conducted using a more environmentally friendly material to increase the voltage output while reducing the cost and weight-to-voltage ratios of lead acid battery cells. Lead-acid galvanic cells were constructed and manipulated to have different concentrations of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) electrolyte to determine optimal electrolyte conditions. Several cathode alloyed electrodes were also constructed of different ratios of lead (IV) oxide (PbO2) to red lead tetra oxide (Pb3O4) to modify the cathode composition. <br><br> The lead-acid cells were constructed with similar specifications as an Everstart 65-3N Automotive Battery or Diehard Gold Automotive Battery in which the baseline voltage was determined to be 1.926 V. When the electrolyte concentrations differed from 0.1 M H2SO4 to 9.0 M H2SO4, the cells achieved voltages from 0.728 V to 2.054 V, yielding as much as 6.646% more voltage as compared to the baseline cell. When the cathode was composed of different PbO2:Pb3O4 ratios under varying electrolyte concentrations, the cells generated voltages from 0.480 V to 2.012 V, yielding as much as 4.465% more voltage as compared to the baseline cell. <br><br> In conclusion, an alloyed cathode electrode of 15.80% Pb3O4 and 84.20% PbO2, under an electrolyte concentration ratio of 9:1 M, was determined to generate the same voltage as known lead acid cells. This would decrease the cost of production by 12.96% while decreasing the mass as well as environmental risks worldwide.

LEAD LEACHABILITY FROM THE MATRIX OF CRYSTAL GLASS
Brigham Louis Pope
Provo High School, Provo, UT

Can the use of Crystal Glass be exposing you to harmful amounts of lead? Impregnated with lead oxide, a substance classically known to cause multiple medical complications, this glassware is a source of dangerous contamination. By researching the chemical mechanics behind this unique glass, and by conducting my own experiments, I will discover how, why, and to what extent this lead leaches into the liquid the glass holds.<br><br> Glass is an amorphous solid that undergoes modifications when ions are embedded within the matrix. When lead is introduced into the glass, it takes the forms of a network modifier and a network former. Both forms contribute to reducing structural order and contributing to the leaching process. The leaching process involves lead oxide performing a metathesis reaction with hydrogen and is extracted into the solution. The hydrogen ion is responsible for driving this reaction.<br><br> Two experiments were prepared to see first-hand the affects of exposure time and solution acidity on the leaching rate and level of lead solutes in the solution. Solutions of hydrochloric acid were placed in six identical 220mL glasses of hand cut, 24% lead crystal from Zawlercie in Poland. Tests were conducted on a pH scale of 3 to 7 and an exposure time of 1 hour to 4 weeks. Analysis by American West Analytical Laboratories revealed a linear increase of lead solutes as pH decreased and an exponentially decreasing rate of leaching as exposure time increased.

DEPOSITION OF NOVEL CATALYSTS ON PHOTOVOLTAIC MATERIALS FOR ARTIFICIAL PHOTOSYNTHESIS: THE CASE OF RUTHENIUM AND TUNGSTEN NANOPARTICLES ON HYDROGEN EVOLUTION REACTION EFFICIENCY
Jennifer Manyu Wong
Kapolei High School, Kapolei, HI

Hydrogen generated from solar-driven water-splitting has the potential to be a clean, sustainable and abundant energy source. Inspired by natural photosynthesis, photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells are artificial solar water-splitting devices that are currently in the development stage and require low manufacturing costs. Amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) thin film is used as the semiconductor for this experiment due to the advantages of being inexpensive, efficient by absorbing a lot of photons, ease of process, can be used on flexible and light weight substrates. a-SiC has a band gap of 2.1 eV, which is ideal for PEC devices. However, its surface energetics is not aligned with the water redox potential, requiring addition bias to split water. Misalignment of conduction band (Ec) and valance band (Ev) with redox potentials is a big issue for PEC H2 production. Recently, researchers discovered that misalignment of Ec and Ev with redox potentials can be solved with surface catalysis. This experiment involves selective deposition of nanoparticles to modify surface characteristics. Nanoparticles have a large surface area, which provides more reaction sites. Nanoparticles deposition onto semiconductor is used to make a high performance photoelectrode, assumed to improve performance by lowering potential while increasing water splitting efficiency. Samples were characterized by Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV) to measure current density in response to an applied potential. The current density corresponds directly to the amount of electrical charge crossing the solid/liquid interface and reacting with water to make H2. Results show that ruthenium and tungsten nanoparticles serve as great catalysts for artificial photosynthesis, in addition to being remarkably inexpensive.

FINGERPRINTS: CAN THEY HANDLE THE HEAT?
Martina Marie Hukel
Governor French Academy, Belleville, IL

This project tested if rising temperatures would affect the quality of the fingerprint lifted from the surface. It is believed that higher temperatures of an environment will decrease the quality of the print.<br><br>A professionally-taken print was examined and twelve minutiae (micro-features that individualize a print) were identified on a specific print (left index). A print was then placed on a cleaned piece of stainless steel and left for 10 minutes at room temperature. It was then lifted using the basic dusting and tape-lifting methods and examined for the twelve previously-identified minutiae. This was done four more times and became the control. Then the print was placed on steel and placed into 77°C oven for 10 minutes, removed, let cool, and then lifted with the same method. It was examined and this trial was done four more times. The temperature of the oven was increases by 11° after each set of trials and the above steps were repeated. <br><br>The results of this experiment show that as temperature increase, the amount of identifiable minutiae decreases. This proved the hypothesis correct. Fingerprints are made of mostly water and oil that naturally evaporates but as it is heated, it evaporates more quickly. Also the chemicals in the print, such as NaCl and amino acids (serine, Ornithine–Lysine), react with the steel. These reactions are accelerated by higher temperatures. They form chemicals that evaporate much more readily. As the temperature increases, the metal reacts with the salt in the print and oxides. It forms a hard resin that is also very difficult to lift with basic procedures. All of these contribute to explain the results which show that as temperature increases, the clarity of the recovered print decreases.

DUNALI LIVES
Allyse Ann Lusby-Angvick
Pershing County High School, Lovelock, NV

The reason I should find the best process for rendering glycerol from the Dunaliella Salina is because I believe it will create an invaluable source of energy. Since the the normal methods for getting glycerol such as using a hexane solution tends to kill the algae it hasn’t turned into a big industry. I believe ionizing it may turn out to be the ticket the public needs to do mass production. Also because I live in NV how much water this project takes would be important and this project is one that could be done, if you have a fully grown specimen of algae approximately one liter to ionize and a liter to grow the algae back in. my materials in this project included blue LED lights to grow the algae in which proved the itself in an earlier experiment by another student. An aseptic system and filter to muster together the algae. Dialysis tubing to keep any of the algae cells from escaping, one ionizer which zaps the algae with positive and negative ions and lastly, a spectrometer to see if the effects of the ionizer will keep it from growing and to check the absorbency.

INFRARED MULTI-PHOTON DISSOCIATION SPECTROSCOPY OF MASS-SELECTED PEPTIDE-CROWN COMPLEXES
Santos Antonio Cedric Ruiz Rodriguez
Union County High School, Lake Butler, FL

A range of peptides, including TPPpSGEPPK, pTSLPTPPTR, TPPSSGEPPK, and, GAAAAAYK were made by F-Moc solid-phase synthesis and were ran on the FT-ICR mass spectrometer. These peptides were tagged with 4’-bromobenzo-18-crown-6 ether by mixing a 1:2 (peptide:tag) solution. The peptide-tag complexes are facile to recognize, due to the characteristic isotope distribution for the tag due to 79Br and 81Br isotopes. The complex’s gas phase ions were then generated in the electrospray ionization (ESI) source of a commercial Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer and were irradiated with a fixed-wavelength CO2 laser in the ICR trap. The proposed tag will allow us to identify tagged peptides within a mixture of peptides due to their isotopic distribution and determine the precursor-fragment pairs as a result of the single pathway fragmentation of the precursor upon irradiation. This will allow for the multiplexed variable-wavelength infrared multiple-photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectra of an unknown mixture of peptides to be taken simultaneously. The preliminary results show that the peptides were successfully tagged with 4’ bromobenzo-18-crown-6 ether, the isotope ratios were correlated with calculated isotope distributions for the peptide-tag complex, and the complex fragmented through a single pathway as a result of the loss of tag upon irradiation.

DESIGN AND SYNTHESIS OF HYDROGENATED TIO2-POLYANILINE NANORODS FOR FLEXIBLE HIGH-PERFORMANCE SUPERCAPACITORS
Eesha Khare
Lynbrook High School, San Jose, CA

With the rapid growth of portable electronics, it has become necessary to develop efficient energy-storage technology to match this development. While batteries are currently used for energy-storage, they are not ideal because of slow charging times and short cycle life. Supercapacitors have attracted attention as energy-storage devices due to their long cycle life and high power density. However, supercapacitor use is limited because they store less energy than batteries. Increasing supercapacitor energy density, while maintaining good power density and cycle life, remains a key challenge in energy-storage research.<br><br>This work designed, synthesized, and characterized a novel core-shell nanorod electrode with hydrogenated TiO2 (H-TiO2) core and polyaniline shell. H-TiO2 acts as the double layer electrostatic core. Good conductivity of H-TiO2 combined with high pseudocapacitance of polyaniline results in significantly higher overall capacitance and energy density while retaining good power density and cycle life. Structural and electrochemical evaluation of the resulting supercapacitor demonstrated high capacitance of 238.5 F/g compared to the next best alternative supercapacitor in previous research of 80 F/g. This resulted in excellent energy density of 20.1 Wh/kg, comparable to batteries, while maintaining a high power density of 20.5 kW/kg. It also demonstrated a much higher cycle life compared to batteries, with a low 32.5% capacitance loss over 10,000 cycles at a high scan rate of 200 mV/s. This new electrode was fabricated into a flexible solid-state device to light an LED to test it in a practical application. This work is an important initial step in introducing this new electrode material in supercapacitors to replace conventional batteries.

SYNTHESIS OF MONODISPERSE SUPERPARAMAGNETIC FEPT NANOPARTICLES
Savannah Rae Flak
Alexander W. Dreyfoos School of the Arts, West Palm Beach, FL

Superparamagnetic nanoparticles have been studied for multiple applications, such as contrast agents for MRI, data storage, and magnetic hyperthermia, because of the unique magnetic features of these small particles. The objective of this experiment was to synthesize and characterize reproducible monodisperse superparamagnetic FePt nanoparticles with size control. Two procedures were used to produce different sized nanoparticles, where both methods thermally decomposed iron (III) acetylacetonate and platinum (II) acetylacetonate in dioctyl ether. The first used 1,2-hexadecanediol as a reducing agent and a larger amount of dioctyl ether to yield 4 nm particles, but the second used oleylamine as a reducing agent and a smaller amount of dioctyl ether to yield 2 nm particles with approximately a 1:1 iron to platinum composition. These nanoparticles were characterized using transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. It was concluded that the heating and nucleation rate during thermal decomposition greatly impacts the resulting particle size and composition.

GREEN CHEMISTRY: A NOVEL APPROACH TO IMPROVE THE RECOVERABILITY, ACTIVITY, & PERFORMANCE OF NANO-STRUCTURED CATALYSTS
Nawaf Abdulwahab Alhowaish
Dharan Ahliyya Schools, Dammam, SAUDI ARABIA

The utilization of nano-structured materials as catalysts is highly relevant due to their elevated catalytic efficiency, recovery and reuse rates. Today, the main concern is that chemical products release CO2 and other toxic emission during catalytic reactions. There has to be new methods and techniques to reduce these emissions. This research demonstrates a novel method to improve the recoverability, activity, and performance of the nano-structured catalyst using environmentally friendly green chemistry techniques and magnetic nanoparticles. In order to accomplish this, a catalyst support was synthesized “Fe3O4”, an amino acid “Glutathione” was attached to the catalyst support. Different characterization techniques were applied (XRD, TEM, TGA, FTIR) to confirm the formation of the desired nano-organocatalyst. To test the activity of the nano-organocatalyst, Pyrazole synthesis and Aza-michael reactions were selected. These reactions derivatives are important for the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds. The activity of the catalyst ranged between 80%-96%, which reflects the high performance of the nano-organocatalyst. The catalyst activity in the Benzylamine reaction lasted for 5 consecutive cycles showing a positive yield during the recoverability process that started with a yield percent 96% and ended with 93% at the fifth cycle, with a drop of 3% only. This research bridges the defects that are found in both the homogenous and heterogeneous systems by using nano-structured materials with high and promising activity and recoverability rates. This will lead to potentially beneficial applications such as the synthesis of pharmaceutical drugs for antidiabetic and antibacterial functionality.

THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT LIGHTINGS ON OIL AND ACRYLIC PAINT
Madeline Ann Landry
Benjamin Franklin High School, New Orleans, LA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine how oil and acrylic paint were affected by different types of lightings: Halogen, Incandescent, Fluorescent, L.E.D. (light-emitting diode), and no lighting (the control). It was hypothesized that the incandescent would fade bot paints the most, followed by the fluorescent, then the halogen, and lastly the L.E.D. lighting. For each paint under each lighting, three pieces of paper were placed for two months. Each trial had its average RGB (red green blue) values taken at the beginning and again at the end of the two month period.<br><br> The results showed that all of the trials' colors actually darkened (the RGB values dropped.) However, all of the trials that were placed under any light darkened less than the control (no light), and therefore the light appeared to have faded the trials slightly. Overall the acrylic faded more (darkened less) than the oil paint. <br><br> Of all the lightings, the incandescent lighting faded the acrylic paint the most and faded the oil the least. The L.E.D. lighting faded the acrylic paint slightly less than the incandescent and faded the oil slightly more. The fluorescent lighting faded the acrylic paint third most and faded the oil third least. Finally, the halogen lighting faded the acrylic paint the least and the oil the most. Moreover, the halogen light, unlike all the other lights, faded the oil paint more than the acrylic paint. Overall it was found that the acrylic pieces would fade least under halogen lightings, whereas oil pieces would fade least under incandescent lighting.

K.I.S.S. FOR KINETICS: SIMPLIFYING THE DEVELOPMENT OF KINETIC RATE EQUATIONS BY USING MULTIVARIANT REGRESSION TECHNIQUES
Rebecca Grace Johnson
Life Christian Academy, Harvest, AL

Traditional methods for predicting chemical reaction rates require collecting and analyzing large amounts of data under controlled conditions. If a faster, simpler method were available, manufacturers could inexpensively optimize reagent concentrations and other reaction conditions. The resulting changes could increase profit margins and enhance sustainability by reducing the resources and energy required and the waste generated. This project tested the hypothesis that multivariant linear regression analysis can be used to characterize the effects of reagent concentrations on chemical reaction rates.<br><br>The multivariant regression method was validated using published rate data. The resulting reaction orders, 0.933 for H2 and 0.459 for Br2, matched reported values. The adjusted R square of 0.994 indicated an excellent fit for the mathematical model.<br><br>The regression-based method was then applied to student-collected laboratory data for the Dushman variation of an Iodine Clock reaction. A video-based method was developed to pinpoint the time of discontinuous color change, ensuring accurate rate calculations. Despite a complex reaction mechanism and noisy laboratory data, regression analysis produced results equivalent to literature values. Analysis of unfiltered data yielded reaction orders of 2.02 for KI and 1.10 for KIO3 with an adjusted R square of 0.916. Corresponding student T probabilities were 0.000648 and 0.0478, respectively.<br><br>These results show that multivariant regression analysis provides a simple, inexpensive, and broadly applicable alternative to traditional kinetics analysis methods. This technique allows using available operation data to optimize the efficiencies of chemical processes and minimize environmental impacts instead of running costly experiments.

AROMATIC HETEROCYCLES FOR OVERCHARGE PROTECTION IN LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES
Corrine Faye Elliott
Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Lexington, KY

Derivatives of the aromatic molecule Phenothiazine are often used in batteries due to their ability to alternately accept and donate electrons without degradation, allowing them to redirect excess energy and prevent overcharging. This experiment aimed to find more efficient molecules for use as overcharge protectors; oxidation potential, determined via cyclic voltammetry, was used as an indicator of efficiency. The initial experiment involved the synthesis of Phenothiazine derivatives in which alternate groups were substituted for the hydrogen molecules at junctions two and/or seven; results indicated that molecules with cyano substituents added were most efficient. This project is a continuation in which alternate base compounds with 2-7 cyanide groups were synthesized in order to contrast performance with that of additives currently in use. More broadly, x-rays were taken of each molecule to determine relative planarity in the hopes of discovering a relationship between angularity and efficiency. The molecules with the highest oxidation potential while still maintaining reversibility are those likely to be most efficient as overcharge protectors. Among other ventures, further investigation would likely include incorporating each derivative into lithium-ion batteries for testing in an environment closer to their intended application. This experiment will allow chemists to determine the accuracy of planarity as an indicator of a compound’s effectiveness as an overcharge protector; conclusions may also be drawn regarding the most efficient base molecules to serve as said additives.

ALTERNATIVE ENERGY: USING NANOTECHNOLOGY TO TRANSFER ENERGY BETWEEN BIOLUMINESCENT FIREFLY PROTEINS & FLUORESCENT QUANTUM RODS
Olivia Helen Sheppard
Manlius Pebble Hill School, Dewitt, NY

What appliance do you own that may be turned on and off without the requirement of an energy source? This study of nanotechnology investigates how a biological material—firefly luciferin—may be harnessed for both biological and non-biological use. Imagine one day possibly turning on a lamp without the need for batteries or electricity! The purpose of this research was to observe energy transfer between Photinus pyralis (Ppy) firefly luciferase protein and semi-conductive CdSe/CdS quantum rods. In variable trails, Ni ions were added to the solution being studied. During the addition of Ni ions, the protein absorbed the Ni and would not effectively bind to the quantum rod. Different measurements of protein and quantum rod were mixed with beetle luciferin and ATP to create one of the brightest bioluminescence systems in nature. The addition of Ni affected the BRET results in these trials. The binding of the protein to the quantum rod via a histag was supported and the fact that the luciferase has a significant influence on BRET was proven as well. An application of nanotechnology that is currently developing is the delivery of light to places in the body, specifically tumors for medical bioimaging. Medical use of Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIR) is also being optimized through use of nanotechnology. The low background signals and lack of requirement of a direct excitation have proven these BRET nanosystems to be very useful for in vivo NIR imaging.

NEW STRUCTURE OF THE O-SPECIFIC POLYSACCHARIDE OF ESCHERICHIA COLI O36
Evgeniya Aleksandrovna Levina
Moscow Chemical Lyceum, Moscow, RUSSIA

Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) is the key component of the outer membrane of the cell wall and is considered as a virulence factor of Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli. LPS molecule consists of a lipid part, responsible for toxicity and pyrogenety of LPS, a core oligosaccharide, and a polysaccharide chain (O-polysaccharide, O-antigen), which has a highly diverse structure. O-Antigens define serospecificity of strains and are used for the serotyping of bacteria. <br><br>In this work, LPS of Escherichia coli O36 was isolated from dry killed bacterial mass, which was not hazardous. The O-polysaccharide was obtained by mild acid degradation of the LPS and studied by chemical methods along with high-resolution 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The following structure of the branched pentasaccharide repeating unit of the O-polysaccharide was established: -4)-a-D-Manp-(1-3)-a-L-Fucp-(1-3)-b-D-GlcpNAc-(1-<br><br>a-L-Rhap-(1-2)-a-L-Fucp-(1-3)<br><br>The structure was confirmed independently by Smith degradation of the O-polysaccharide, resulted in oxidation and subsequent cleavage of a side chain and isolation of the expected linear polysaccharide. <br><br>The obtained structural data contribute to the creation of molecular basis for serological classification of Escherichia coli, which is used in serodiagnosis and epidemiological monitoring.

Shannie Annjulisha Castilloveitia
Specialized High School in Science and Math Thomas Armstrong Toro, Ponce, PUERTO RICO

The acetogenins (ACG) are anticancer agents that fight malignant cells resistant to chemotherapy drugs, without affecting healthy cells. According to research, these are present in the Annonaceae, plant family tree of which Annona muricata L. (soursop) is part. The study sought to identify where in the Annona muricata L. fruit tree was the highest concentration of acetogenins thus comparing the leaf and seed. The hypothesis was that the highest concentration of acetogenins will be found in the leaf of Annona muricata L. In the process, 25 seeds (6.016 g) and 25 leaves (35. 933 g) of Annona muricata L. were used. For the preparation of extracts, both were placed in a press and introduced into an oven at 60 ° C for 52 days to produce dehydration. Subsequently these were macerated until pulverization and were weighed obtaining 5.775g of leaves and 5.403g of seeds. The pulverized materials were separatedly diluted in 100mL of ethanol for 8 days. To find the acetogenins concentration, samples were first passed through a Nanophotometer to determine the wavelength to be used in High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The mobile phase used in the chromatographic analysis was acetonitrile. According to the data, it is concluded, that the highest concentration of ACG is found in the leaves with a concentration of 2.98042x10^5 micrograms/grams compared with 1.19402x10^5 micrograms/grams found in the seed. The hypothesis is accepted. Therefore, when using the Annona muricata L. as a preventive drug for cancer it is suggested to use the leaf extract.

THE STABILITY OF GOLD AND SILVER NANOPARTICLE IN BASE AND ACID ENVIRONMENTS
Ricardo Javier Santana
University of Puerto Rico Secondary School, San Juan, PUERTO RICO

Nanotechnology shows very promising results in medical, bioengineering and electrical applications. Gold and silver nanoparticles are some of the most commonly used nanoparticles because of their stability, ability to absorb and scatter light effectively which are useful for biomedical and diagnostic applications. However, unstable nanoparticles release silver ions (Ag+) exhibiting strong toxicity by binding to DNA and disrupting cell replication. It has been demonstrated that gold nanoparticles have a partial toxicity. This investigation studies what effect pH changes to nanoparticle’s environments have in their stability. PH changes could affect both toxicities. The hypothesis is that, when exposed to these pH changes, the nanoparticles will change size and precipitate. Nanoparticles have negative and positive charges that are triggered by pH changes. Electrostatic attractions between the nanoparticles can rapidly form aggregates inside the cells, and the aggregates accumulate as the exocytosis is blocked by the increased size. The methodology consists of: the synthesis of gold and silver nanoparticles, characterization by UV-Visual Spectroscopy, pH changes to their environment by adding NaOH and HCl, evaluated at values close to blood pH levels to establish their properties for biomedical applications and dynamic light scattering measurements to determine the particle sizes. Both types of nanoparticles were less stable after the pH changes. The changes of pH had a more drastic effect on the stability of of the silver nanoparticles than the gold ones, demonstrated by changes in monodispersity This confirms that the changes affected their stability concluding that gold nanoparticle are better suited for biomedical applications.

FOLDING AND UNFOLDING OF SERUM ALBUMIN PROTEINS WITH TWO-PHOTON FLUORESCENCE SPECTROSCOPY
Gagan Ajay Gupta
Kalamazoo Area Mathematics and Science Center, Kalamazoo, MI

Two-photon absorption (TPA) cross-sections of non-covalently bound chromophores were used as markers to monitor the unfolding transitions in bovine serum albumin (BSA) and human serum albumin (HSA). Two chromophores, Coumarin 485 and Coumarin 515, that are polarity sensitive and possess intramolecular charge-transfer states, were studied for the investigation. The binding constants of the dyes with BSA were determined to be around 10000 M-1. The Job’s plot measurements have shown 1:1 stoichiometry for both dyes with BSA and HSA. The unfolding of BSA and HSA was carried out with the addition of Guanidinum hydrochloride (GuCl) and it was monitored with intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, one photon fluorescence, and TPA cross-sections of the chromophores. The TPA cross-sections of the dye molecules increased with the addition of BSA and HSA, suggesting the influence of the local electric fields in the proteins. The local electric fields of BSA and HSA were estimated to be 0.23 and 0.28 MV/cm respectively. Note that the TPA cross-sections of the dyes are quite insensitive to the solvent polarity and the observed cross-section increases were attributed to greater local electric fields in proteins in their folded forms. The observed trends of unfolding matched with one another as well as with the circular dichroism experiments. The results confirmed the hypothesis that TPA cross-sections of extrinsic chromophores can track protein folding and unfolding.

EFFICIENT AND RECYCLABLE CELLULOSE-SUPPORTED PD-NANOCATALYSTS FOR SUZUKI COUPLING REACTIONS
Claudia Huang
Carmel High School, Carmel, IN

The palladium-catalyzed Suzuki coupling is one of the most versatile C-C bond forming reactions in organic synthesis and is frequently performed on an industrial scale. Pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries desire a catalyst that can be easily recovered from product stream and be reused. As a continuation of my research devoted to sustainable chemistry, I have designed and synthesized recyclable cellulose-supported Pd-nanocatalysts. This was accomplished by functionalizing cellulose with chlorophosphine to create phosphine ligand donors, which subsequently coordinate with Pd to replace soluble Pd phosphine complexes. The catalysts were highly active, stable, and compatible with the green solvent system I previously developed. Notably, the couplings were performed at ambient temperature and often afforded quantitative conversion within 30 minutes. All functional groups present in arylbromides or arylboronic acids (-OH, -NH2, -OCH3, -CH3, -NO2, -F, -Cl, -COOH, -CHO, -SO2CH3, -CO-, -CF3, -CN, -COOCH3, -NHSO2CH3) were well tolerated. Furthermore, the catalysts were successfully applied to the Suzuki coupling reactions of arylchlorides and heteroaromatic halides and also the consecutive double-coupling reactions utilizing aryldibromides or an aryldiboronic acid under mild conditions. Most importantly, the catalysts were easily recovered by filtration and reused up to five times with constant catalytic activity. The leaching of Pd into solution from the cellulose was negligible. Finally, the catalysts were applied to synthesize bioactive compounds, functional materials, and pharmaceutical molecules, resulting in improved yields. Thus, the catalysts will greatly contribute to an environmentally friendly, economically viable, and sustainable synthetic chemical process.

MY "DOPING" PROBLEM: SYNTHESIZING N-SPIKED TIO2 NANOPARTICLES FOR VISIBLE-LIGHT PHOTOCATALYSIS
Zehrgio Mercado Mones
Murphy High School, Mobile, AL

The residual dyes from various sources, particularly textile factories, are among a variety of hazardous organic pollutants that are excessively introduced into natural water resources. Due to the threat this poses on a global scale, there is a critical need for environmentally sound and efficient chemical processes. Semiconductors are capable of redox reactions, known as photocatalysis. Semiconductors are ideal photocatalysts due to the band gap that exists between their valence and conduction bands. For photocatalysis to proceed, the semiconductors need to absorb energy equal to or more than its energy gap. The movement of electrons forms negatively charged electron/positively charged hole pairs (e-/h+) as well as the oxidizing agent hydroxyl radical. Titanium Dioxide however can only absorb UV light due to its large band gap (3.2eV). The research investigated if doping TiO2 with Nitrogen atoms could reduce the band gap so that visible - light could be used to achieve photocatalytic-degradation of methylene blue. Anatase phase TiO2 was synthesized using a sol-gel method: Titanium(IV) isopropoxide underwent a hydrolysis reaction with deionized water, isopropyl alcohol, and Ammonium Chloride. After 24h, the filtrate was filtered and dried at 120°C for 24h. The TiO2 crystals were crushed using a mortar and pestle and calcined for 2h at 400°C. Solutions of methylene blue were prepared to obtain a calibration curve using a UV-Vis Spectrophotometer. TiO2 was dissolved in the solution and illuminated by UV & Visible Light for 2h. Significant reductions in methylene blue concentrations, ranging from 64.97%-80.72%, were achieved using only visible light.

EFFECT OF A METHYLENE SPACER ON THE COORDINATION CHEMISTRY OF A NEW PYRIDINE/THIONE LIGAND
Christopher Chien-Liang Yu
North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, Durham, NC

Methanotrophs are bacteria that use methane as their only source of carbon and energy. They occur mostly in the soil of the Earth, and it is very common for them to be found near environments where methane is located. Methanotrophs are very helpful for the environment since they reduce the release of methane to the atmosphere. Methanotrophs are methane-oxidizing bacteria and they grow aerobically or anaerobically. Methanobactin is a copper-binding compound found in methanotrophic bacteria. The main metal element found in methanobactin is copper. The goal of my project is to create synthetic analogues of methanobactin, and I will be able to do this with the synthesis of the mpicMe ligand. The preparation of this new compound was successful and I studied its properties like solubility and melting points. Zinc, cadmium and mercury complexes were also synthesized and, through all of this research, I was able to contribute to the creation of synthetic analogues of methanobactin.

AN ECO-FRIENDLY WAY TO MAKE GAS SEPARATION MEMBRANES TO PURIFY NATURAL GAS
Chris Cornell Jenkins
Hattiesburg High School, Hattiesburg, MS

Natural gas is the fuel source that is used in stoves, heaters, and water heaters. Natural gas is pumped from deep in the earth, is a product of organic decay, and is filled with a variety of different gas impurities. Current processes, like refineries, use a lot of energy to purify natural gas. This project explores polymer films as an eco-friendly alternative way to purify natural gas. Gas separation membranes allow certain gases to pass through while not allowing others to pass through. The selection process is controlled by interactions between the polymer membrane and the gas, and molecular hole size in the membrane. By choosing the correct monomers for the polymer film, the selection process can be controlled. Thiol-ene chemistry allows different polymers to be made to control the selection process easily and efficiently. Thiol-ene polymerization is fast, and monomers can be cured by UV light. For this experiment, two thiol monomers and three ene monomers were mixed to make six different membranes. Monomer mixtures were cured between two glass plates using UV light. Thin membranes were removed, measured for thickness, and tested for permeability of CO2 and CH4. CO2 has a higher permeability than CH4 in all membranes but 4T-TTT. 3T-TEGDVE showed the highest CO2 permeability. 3T-TEGDVE also had the highest CH4 permeability. 3T-TEGDVE permeated CO2 27 times faster than CH4 making it the highest performing membrane tested. With these results, gas separation membranes can be developed as an eco-friendly way to purify natural gas using thiol-ene chemistry.

A COMPUTATIONAL INVESTIGATION OF THE STRUCTURES, ENERGIES, AND FORMATION PATHWAYS OF INTERSTELLAR ANIONS
Nikhil Buduma
Bellarmine College Preparatory School, San Jose, CA

About 130 neutral and a dozen positively-charged molecules have been discovered in space, but it was only until relatively recently that negatively-charged molecules have been found in space. Between 2004 and 2007, the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) identified the first three interstellar anions, C4H-, C6H-, and C8H-, from IR spectroscopic readings. To explore this novel area of astrochemistry, density functional theory (DFT) was used to compute structures, energies, and formation pathways of these carbon-chain anions in order to develop a deeper understanding of astrochemical processes. All geometrical optimizations of minima and transition structures were performed within the Gaussian 09 environment (at the B3LYP DFT level with the 6-311+G** basis set), and relative energies were corrected using a zero-point vibrational energy correction. Intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) analyses were also run on the transition states to investigate formation and isomerization pathways. The results of this computational investigation lead to numerous predictions of astrochemical significance. First, I succeeded in optimizing the structures of a number of nonlinear isomers of carbon-chain anions, contradicting previous assumptions that C4H-, C6H-, and C8H- exist exclusively as linear molecules. Second, my computations posit that these isomers occupy energetic minima of reasonable electronic energy compared to the linear isomers, thus confirming that these nonlinear isomers may exist in interstellar space. And finally, my IRC computations account for novel isomerization pathways of these carbon chain isomers. In future studies, I plan to optimize additional structures and further characterize formation and isomerization pathways of all identified carbon-chain isomers.

PRODUCTION OF TRICALCIUM PHOSPHATE NANOPARTICLES DOPED WITH IRON FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW SUNSCREEN
Vitoria Karen Raimundo
Instituto Federal de Educacao, Ciencia e Tecnologia de Sergipe, Aracaju, BRASIL

Many sunscreens are not effective against UV rays besides containing carcinogenic benzene. There are two kinds of sunscreens: organic, made of aromatic compounds with a high allergic potential, and inorganic, that produce a skin white-blued color aesthetically undesirable. The mineral tricalcium phosphate form found in bones is a biocompatible and toxicity free. The Fe3+ presents low toxicity and it can absorb UVB (290-320nm) and UVA (320-400nm). Therefore, I considered the biocompatibility of Beta-TCP added to the optical activity of Fe3+ interesting to be used as inorganic sunscreens active ingredient. This work aimed to investigate Fe3+ concentration effects on Beta-TCP optical and structural properties produced by precipitation method to be used as sunscreen. I produced tricalcium Beta-phosphate powders doped with iron according to chemical precipitation method by preparing solutions of Ca(NO3)2.4H2O+Fe(NO3)3.9H2O  added to (NH4)2HPO4. The Fe(NO3)3,9H2O solution was used on concentrations of 0.01, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 mol/L. I conducted the reaction at room temperature with vigorous agitation, at a 10.8 PH with addition of NH4OH. The material was calcined at 800°C for 2 hours. Samples were sent to a Physics lab to be characterized by X ray diffraction techniques (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Optical Absorption (OA). XRD analysis demonstrated the desired material formation with presence of minority phases identified as hydroxyapatite and iron oxide in all samples. The SEM micrography showed nanometric particles formation constituted by heterogeneous agglomerates. OA analysis assured Beta-FeTCP is absorbed on the UV region and that 0.01mol/L Fe3+ doping presented best results. Therefore, Beta-FeTCP produced in this research may be a promising candidate to be applied as sunscreen in creams, gel, make-up, etc.

Our project aims at finding more cost effective way of ammonia production by splitting strong triple bonds of nitrogen molecules in low temperature using nanoparticles and hydrogen received from water. <br><br>Ammonia is widely used in production of agricultural fertilizers, plastics, paints and explosives. Yearly over 500 million tons of fertilizers like ammonia and urea are used in agriculture to feed 30% of world population. <br><br>For the last 100 years in the process of ammonia production nitrogen was split at the pressure of 700 atmosphere and 450°C temperature, using strong catalysts, known as Haber-Bosch process which is very costly and less efficient economically. <br><br>We have found a new method to split strong nitrogen molecules into two component parts in low temperature of 50°-80°C and at normal pressure. <br><br>We mixed 18 -80 nm uncoated aluminum nanoparticle powder with water in concentration of 1mg/mL. Then we heated the solution up to 60°C and added nitrogen gas (like atmospheric air). Within an hour water was split into ions and nitrogen was split from air. The process lasted until full oxidation of all remaining aluminums from nanoparticles. <br><br>As a result nitrogen and hydrogen ions from water reacted and created ammonia in an efficient way.<br><br>Further on, by adding wasted carbon gases to ammonia we can get much needed urea fertilizer.<br><br>The result of this research may considerably improve efficiency of outdated process of production.

The usage of plastics nowadays adversely affects our green ecosystem. Therefore, a new type of plastic that can be biodegraded in a short period of time has been created to conserve the quality of the environment and to save the earth.<br><br> Starch and fiber is the base material that is used to make biodegradable plastic. In this project, the starch and fiber from banana stem (Musa sp. pseudostem) was extracted using the boiling, blending, sieving and collecting method. Using the starch and fiber extracted from banana stem, biodegradable plastic was produced using a mixer machine and a hot-press machine. The rate of biodegradable plastic decomposition was determined by burying the samples in the same type of soil while other conditions such as weather and the depth of sample in the soil were the same.<br><br> As a result, 13 samples with different ratio of LDPE, fiber and starch had shown significant differences in terms of mass, thickness and the rate of biodegradability. During biodegradability process, it was observed that some of the samples had retained, gained and experienced lost in mass due to water absorption caused by climatic changes.<br><br> Plastics with ratio of 40% fiber, 40% starch and 20% LDPE had shown the highest significant difference in mass loss by 36% compared to the other sample. The quality of biodegradable plastic can be improved in terms of morphology, strength and elasticity. Moreover, this product is also applicable to be used as a future source in the food packaging industry.

PREPARATION OF A SELF-PROPELLED NANOMOTOR

Plano East Senior High School, Plano, TX

Self-propelled nanomotors use nanolocomotion, which is the fueled propulsion of any nano-object via an anisotropic force, to drive them forward. This phenomenon has the capacity to be effective in site specific drug delivery, nanoreactors for catalysis, and biosensing. However, current nanomotors lack: 1) biocompatibility, 2) morphogenesis, 3) loading capabilities, and 4) the ability to execute nanolocomotion in a non-toxic, neutral-pH atmosphere, thus eliminating possibilities for biological applications.<br><br>Therefore, a nanomotor suitable for biological applications was synthesized. It was hypothesized that a biocompatible nanomotor can deliver payloads if magnesium nanoparticles fuel nanolocomotion via the liberation of hydrogen bubbles from the redox reactions that occur in a salt solution. The synthesis of these nanomotors involves the encapsulation of magnesium nanoparticles in mesoporous silica nanospheres, coated on one side with a gold/palladium film to form an asymmetric structure. When placed in saltwater, magnesium fuel reacts to produce hydrogen nanobubbles that propel the spheres, thus executing nanolocomotion.<br><br>The asymmetric mesoporous silica nanosphere delivery vehicles and the magnesium nanoparticles that were successfully synthesized using a surfactant templating technique and a lithium reduction, respectively. The hydrogen release was demonstrated and quantified. The success of this design and future research regarding various payloads and fuels may result in numerous applications ranging from drug delivery to smart ammunition and environmental cleanup. The development of nanomotors could have a near term impact on medicine and nanorobotics in general.

The purpose of this project was to create an economical energy storage device to overcome some of the limitations inherent in renewable energy resources, such as intermittent energy availability.<br><br>Our Hypothesis was that if we compared the voltage required to electrolyze water with the electronegativity difference of the various catalysts, then the catalyst with the largest electronegativity difference will lower the voltage the most. <br><br>We set a control value by pouring 1 liter of water into the electrolysis unit and measuring the voltage required to electrolyze the water. Next we created some .1 molar solutions of the catalysts and poured them individually into the electrolysis unit. We measured the voltage of all the solutions after the voltage had stabilized. <br><br>The control value was found to be 6.4 volts. <br><br>The results are listed in the table below:<br><br> voltage electronegativity difference<br><br>KCl 1.2426 2.34<br><br>NaCl 1.396 2.23<br><br>MgSO4 • 7H2O 1.5983 1.27<br><br>MnSO4 • 4H2O 1.6233 1.03<br><br>Our Results support our hypothesis and show that there is a strong correlation between the electronegativity difference and the voltage of the electrolysis reaction.<br><br>An explanation for the indicated trend is that the catalyst reduced the activation energy required for the electrons to jump between the anode and the cathode. Since pure water is an insulator, due to its covalent structure, the dispersion of charged ions throughout the liquid created bridges for the electrons to flow.

ORGANIC LIGHT-EMITING NANO VESICLES SELF-ASSEMBLED FROM BIS-UREA CONTAINING FLUORESCENT MOLECULES
Ting Hu, Fu Hsuan Liu
Taipei First Girls High School, Taipei City, CHINESE TAIPEI

Scientists learned from the natural biology systems for gathering useful information to design organic molecules capable of self-assembling into interesting nano-scale architectures. In this research, we have designed and synthesized two organic light-emitting molecules (Blue and Green) for the characterizations of their self-assembly nano structures and study their interactions at different levels. The desired molecules were configured with rigid pi-conjugated cores serving as the emissive chromophores and end-capped with bis-urea groups that can govern the self-assembly behaviors. In addition, the central chromophore structures were selected to obtain a good spectral overlap between blue molecule’s emission and the absorption of green molecule. This molecular design strategy gave us the possibility for studying the energy interplay between them. We used SEM and TEM to characterize the nano structures in various media and found these two molecules can spontaneously form spherical nano structures with the averaged size around 400 nm. The interesting uniform nano-vesicles were formed by subtle intermolecular interactions such as pi-pi stacking from the planar rigid pi cores, hydrogen bonds from the bis-urea groups, and van der Waals forces from the long alkyl side chains. The energy transfers between them were investigated in molecular level and nano scale by fluorescent spectroscopy and confocal microscopy, respectively. We will present the different energy transfer behaviors at various scales and demonstrated interesting applications of these emissive organic nano vesicles.

HYDROGEN PRODUCTION USING ULTRA LOW-COST SOYBEAN-MOLYBDENUM CATALYSTS
Shilpa Iyer, Shweta Iyer
Comsewogue High School, Port Jefferson Station, NY

An efficient and abundant catalyst is required for water electrolysis to produce hydrogen. Current industrial standards utilize a Platinum (Pt) electrode for this purpose – however, this electrode, due to its limited availability, is not an economically viable option. Previous non-noble metal catalysts have not been able to withstand corrosion in acid media. A catalyst prepared from the combination of soybeans and molybdenum displays promising activity which rivals that of its Pt counterpart. It is durable in an acidic media for over 500 hours and can drive 10mA cm-2 of current density using 0.2 V. This catalyst is a promising development for future hydrogen production through water electrolysis, and could potentially replace the Pt catalysts utilized today.

ESTABLISHING THE OPTIMUM AMOUNT OF POLYELECTROLYTE MULTILAYERS OF CHITOSAN AND SODIUM ALGINATE FOR DRUG DELIVERY
Josefina Dib, Flavia Bedicks, Pilar Dib
Escola Americana de Campinas, Campinas, BRASIL

The Layer-by-Layer (LbL) method is used to synthesize polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) by depositing a substrate alternately into cationic (Chitosan) and anionic (Sodium Alginate) solutions to create electrostatic interactions between each layer. Curcumin is a curcuminoid of the Indian spice turmeric and, therefore, a natural phenol. Due to its ability to incorporate various functional groups, it can be used to interact with biopolymers. It has also been contemplated for its pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory, anticancer, wound healing, chemosensitizer activities and inhibition of HIV virus replication.The goal of the experiment was to test through the LbL method whether 3, 5 or 7 bilayers would provide a better interaction with curcumin. It was hypothesized that increasing the number of bilayers would result in better interaction with the OH- groups present in the phenol. In the first trial, the bilayers intercalated Sodium Alginate and Chitosan. The procedure consisted of building CHI/Sodium Alginate PEMs, with varying bilayers numbers and adhering curcumin in the PEMs. Samples were then separated for three different tests: Methylene Blue and Rose Bengal test, the Porosity Treatment and Incorporating Curcumin as an outermost layer. The results showed that samples with five bilayers had a better interaction with the drug to be delivered. Using the colorimeter and relying on Beer's law, the change given for the five bilayer aliquots in a buffer solution proved to be the most efficient method to deliver Curcumin in a time range of 30 minutes. Concluding, the optimum amount of bilayers to be used was five bilayers with an extra curcumin outer layer applied to the glass slide.

STUDIES ON THE BOEKELHEIDE REARRANGEMENT OF CYCLIC NITRONATES
Ekaterina Kutsenok, Maxim Radzhabov
Moscow Chemical Lyceum No. 1303, Moscow, RUSSIA

Acylating reagents mediated transformation of heterocyclic N-oxides, known as Boekelheide rearrangement, is a convenient method for the functionalisation of carbon side chain in pyridine and related heterocycles. Application of this method for non-aromatic systems is limited to single examples. The present project is devoted to the acylation of 6-membered cyclic nitronates, 5,6-dihydro-4H-1,2-oxazine-N-oxides furnishing corresponding 1,2-oxazines bearing migrated acyloxy-group. Firstly, on the model substrate (3-Me, 4-Ph, 6,6-dimethyl substituted) various conditions were screened (base, solvent, acylating agent). Formation of two isomers, corresponding to exo- and endo-cyclic proton elimination, was expected. The main factors that determine isomer ratio turned out to be solvent polarity and type of a base. Use of sterically hindered NEt3 in polar acetonitrile resulted in ratio exo:endo = 17:1 (total yield 74%), but use of pyridine in less polar dichloromethane gave predominantly endo isomer (ratio 5.5:1).<br><br>On the next part of the project applicability of the rearrangement was tested on different cyclic nitronates. They were obtained by 2-step procedure from aldehydes, nitroalkenes and olefins through Henry reaction and [4+2]-cycloaddition. Obtained nitronates were acylated in optimized conditions. Good yields of target oxazines (51-72%) were obtained for 3-methyl substituted nitronates. 3-Ethyl analogues gave poor results, which can be explained by sterical reasons.<br><br>Obtained products can be considered as convenient precursors for the synthesis of aminoalcohols, including prolinols. The latter found wide application in organic synthesis as organocatalysts and medicine precursors.

Nanoarcheology is a method of exploring deep strata of material using chemical etching and modern high-precision equipment for examination of surfaced structures. We proposed this method while studying phase transitions in amorphous Fe(67)Co(10)Cr(3)B(15)Si(5) metal stripes.<br><br> The following methods of analysis were used: scanning probe microscopy for studying relief of surface and for detection of magnetic domains; scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersion analyzer for acquiring the element composition of surface structures; synchronous thermal analysis for detection of phase transitions; examination of magnetic hysteresis loops; chemical etching for exposing inner structures of samples.<br><br>Most suitable solvents for etching were: ferric chloride (10%) and hydrochloric acid (18% and 36%). We found out the dynamics of changes in amorphous and crystalline areas occurring at different thermo-magnetic processings. Confirmed presence of magnetic domains in material. Acquired element composition of interesting areas before and after etching. During etching in strong hydrochloric acid emerging of passivating film is observed. Discovered temperature of first phase transition in material (268 Celsium degrees). Ascertained that additional intensive low-duration thermal processing directly affects magnetic properties, specifically reduces coercive force and increases magnetic saturation of sample. Presence of magnetic field also greatly affects emerging crystalline structures and magnetic properties of material.<br><br>We were able to visualize structural waves arising on surface during synthesis of material on external and adjacent to drum sides.<br><br>Research yields as fundamental, so applied importance, since it studies phenomena of interactions and rearrangement of atoms.

There is evidence from previous scientific investigations that dendritic crystals can be formed on steel surfaces. The objective of this research is to obtain crystals of ADP (ammonium dihydrogen phosphate)from a supersaturated solution. This will be done on the surface of a metal (steel) using the method of slow cooling during a period of 48 hours. The hypothesis under study is that the size of the ADP crystals will be bigger as the steel surface area where they grow is bigger.<br><br>To do this investigation, eighteen pieces of steel rods, two inches long each were used. Six of them had a 3/8 inch diameter, six had a 1/2 inch diameter and 6 had a 1 inch diameter. Each of these rods were put separately inside a Styrofoam container. An ADP solution with a concentration of 47g /mL and at 70 Celsius degrees was poured into each of the 18 containers. The containers were sealed and were left to slowly cool for 48 hours.<br><br>The results were that the pieces of steel with greater surface area generated small and fine dendritic crystals. In addition, the small and medium surface areas of steel produced bigger dendritic crystals that were similar in size and thickness among them. The hypothesis is rejected. Future projections are to produce crystals to test them for conductivity.

Nowadays pollution of ocean is very common.8 to 20 million barrels of crude oil spills to oceans roughly in a year. In Gulf of Mexico 960 million liters of crude oil were spilled from April 20 to July 15 in 2010. Some companies try to clean up crude oil spills by using highly toxic detergents,chemicals or combustion the petroleum from surface of oceans.By using that ways crude oil lost its initial properties also damage the enviroment.<br><br>The purpose of our project is the finding of an effective, ecologically pure, and a cheap way of extraction the petroleum from water, with an opportunity of its further processing without loss of initial qualities <br><br>We made experiment with using 10 materials to find which one is has the best absorbing capacity. According to our experiments chicken feather has best result.(98% efficiency)Lowest result pumpkin seed shell(64% efficiency)<br><br>To clean all of the spilled petroleum 26.000 to 65.000 tons of feather are necessary. 80.000 tons of feathers thrown away without any process in America. So we can actualize our project. Feathers absorb oil in an amount of 46 times , coconut substratum absorbs 8.46 times of their own weight.<br><br>If we assume that one barrel of petroleum costs $100; every year, $ 800.000.000 to $2.000.000.000 petroleum spills to oceans and by using our methods we can recover petroleum from oceans and obtain 528,000,000 $ to 1,960,000,000 $ economical benefit in theory. But most important thing that we can save our oceans. Thus ”Oceans are more significant than petroleum.”

Industrial metals decomposed and dissolved as a result of the formation of the different components, is a damage to environment, health, and damage to the country's economy. Stages of the process of dissolution of metals takes place in the cleaning levels. In the process for the removal of impurities is performed by pickling. During this<br><br>process there is a dissolution of more metal. In order to prevent this; with the acid preservative substance will be involved in the environment. Preservative substances should be natural and they should not harm the environment at the same time. The aim of our project; metals dissolve decomposed using a natural substance that has never been used before, to protect against the dissolution of metals in a manner to prevent the economic and harmless to human health and to contribute to green chemistry. Dissolution of iron, steel, and aluminum are used as industrial degrade the prevention of natural preservatives, Solid-Liquid Extraction, UV-Visible Spectroscopy Area, Weight Reduction, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and evaluated using the methods of lyophilization. Indications: Impedance measurement results, increasing the surface resistance of the metal surface of the protective film formed with Rosmarinus Officinalis L. and iron showed decomposition prevented the dissolution rate of 80.36%. This value was 45.18% for steel, for aluminum it was -42.26%. For aluminum in the (-) value in a soluble aluminum compound solution constitutes Rosmarinus Officinalis L. is not protected against decomposition showed that dissolution. Weight decrease in the impedance measurement results are pretty close with the test results. SEM images are also supported it. Be compatible with the accuracy and reliability of the test results proved that the methods used.<br><br>Result: According to the results recorded in preventing dissolution of Rosmarinus Officinalis L. metals decompose in natural protective capacity may be used as a protective substance seemed to follow the type of the metal used.

Aluminum is a very important metal which has been used in the constitution of different products in many areas of industry. Aluminum foil is used in wrapping almost all foods. But are we aware of the fact that aluminum foils can threaten our health?<br><br> In our research, we aimed to find the amount of aluminum penetrating into chicken, fish, potatoes which are wrapped in aluminum foil and also into food such as yoghurt, salad, cheese which are kept in aluminum bowls. Therefore, we took samples of food which we cooked at home and also food from the school canteen. <br><br> In order to determine the penetration of aluminum into food, firstly, the samples of food were dried in an oven and then dried samples were converted into powder by crushing. After that, these samples were burnt with the dry combustion method. Solutions of the burnt matter were titrated by Alizarin Sulfonic Acid Method. The solutions after titration were read with a UV light for the presence of aluminum. The amount of aluminum penetrating into samples were determined by means of absorbance values.<br><br> As a result of this analysis, it has been determined that the penetration of aluminum into acidic food especially cheese and salad is more compared to the other food samples and into potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil. <br><br>After these experiments, it has been determined that the presence of aluminum was found in foods wrapped in aluminum foil regardless if they were stored in hot or cold environments. Taking into consideration the harms aluminum foil can cause to human health, it has been aimed to create awareness in the society because of the common and frequent use of aluminum foil in our daily life. <br><br>Key words: Aluminum, aluminum foil, chicken, fish, potato, salad, cheese, yoghurt

PROTECTIVE EFFECTS OF EPIGALLOCATECHIN-3-GALLATE AGAINST HYDROGEN PEROXIDE-INDUCED APOPTOSIS IN SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA, TYPE 3
Tzu-Hung Ho

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), one of the most common ataxias worldwide, is caused by the expansion of a CAG triplet repeat located in the N-terminal coding region of the ATXN3 gene. Alleles of the ATXN3 gene that carry 13–44 CAG-trinucleotide repeats are present in normal individuals. Contrariwise, alleles with a CAG triplet repeat number of >50 are present in patients with SCA3. It is known as a dynamic mutation of trinucleotide repeat sequences of 63-85 of CAG, leading to form inclusion bodies in neuronal cells in the brain which is caused by polyQ. The present studies showed that EGCG can protect the apoptosis of SCA3 cell line by reducing the oxidative stress mediated by increasing the expression of Hsp70, Hsp60, and Bcl-2, but decreasing the expression of Bax.
