THE VORTEX TUBE HEATING AND COOLING OUT OF THIN AIR
Patrick Sinclair Walters
J.R. Arnold High School, Panama City Beach, Florida, United States

The purpose of this project was to create a Vortex Tube, which is a device that produces warm and cool outputs from a high-pressure inlet, seemingly without work or external energy in the system. After designed and built, specific variables within the Vortex Tube were manipulated in order to understand its properties and to optimize the system. Once the system was optimized and the efficiency calculated, the common misconception made by amateur scientist that states this device defies the laws of thermodynamics and produces internal energy without work or external energy was resolved.<br><br> Data was collected using a thermocouple and multi-meter with the device adjusted to isolate and test two variables, diaphragm diameter and valve position, both of which are directly linked to the performance of the Vortex Tube.<br><br> The data showed that without sufficient back-pressure, the system acts as a vacuum and pulls in ambient air. However, when there is sufficient back-pressure the device separates positive work from negative work in order to create a temperature differential that approaches 3.5 degrees Kelvin. Although the device does a net of zero work overall, work can be described as both positive and negative. <br><br> The system was only 0.08% efficient, using two and a half times more energy a year than a conventional refrigerator. Despite its inefficiency, the Vortex Tube is great for spot cooling and regulating the temperature of breathing air in a self – contained breathing apparatus.<br><br>

ROBOTIC INTELLIGENCE
Erik Paul Bilansky
Vista Ridge High School, Cedar Park TX, U.S.A

The purpose of this project was to build and program a robot to autonomously navigate through a maze by sensing objects and open paths. This was modeled after the example of a rat searching for a piece of cheese through a complex maze, and learning from its unsuccessful attempts. As the robot travels through the maze, it stores characters in memory to represent the best path, and when the maze is repeated, the robot executes the most efficient path. Once the basic function of the robot was achieved, the objective to make this robot more efficient and sophisticated required a list of engineering goals. These goals included navigation through complex mazes, handling multiple paths to the cheese, adapting to changing environments, and using artificial intelligence to perform more efficiently. Navigation through complex mazes required side infrared sensors to see open paths. A whisker switch was used to detect cheese at the end of the maze. To search for additional paths the robot returns back to the start, and along the way, it only searches for paths that could be shorter, disregarding non-productive paths. The ability to handle changing environments was accomplished by allowing the robot to sense changes during the second run, and respond by searching for new paths. Artificial intelligence allows the robot to review the recent past history and recognize trends to alter its decisions on future runs. By achieving these goals, the robot successfully maneuvered through many complicated mazes and discovered the most efficient path in each.

STEERABLE CANTENNAS: A CONTINUED RESEARCH ON THE BENEFITS OF DIRECTIONAL ANTENNAS
Kyle Joseph Jurick
Hicksville Highschool, Hicksville, Ohio, United States

It is hypothesized that a wireless client will be able to have stronger, more consistent signal with the use of a directional self-steering antenna. According to previous research in the area of wireless antennas, there is an overall gain using a directional antenna, but only in one area. With the use of a self-aligning base the antenna should respond to a depreciation in signal strength, due to movement of the user or access point, by re-scanning the area for signal and re-aligning itself to compensate for the original depreciation.<br><br>To test the validity of this hypothesis a directional antenna constructed from a potato chip can was created. The antenna was mounted to a base controlled by two servos, one for each vertical and horizontal movement. The servos were connected to a serial controlled servo controller. The servo controller was then attached to a dedicated computer that will tell the servos to scan the area while it samples five hundred and ten locations for the best signal. After scanning the area the antenna then reverts back to the point that the signal was strongest.<br><br>Collected data from testing supports the hypothesis. Overall the antenna had a high success rate of aiming itself in the proper direction and achieving an overall signal gain compared to when the antenna was absent. The outside conditions, such as humidity, remained constant throughout testing. It was thus concluded that an external, steer-able antenna overall gives the client a larger range of signal throughout a larger area.<br><br>

A NOVEL CORRUGATED BOARD REJECTION SYSTEM
Judith Black
Sacred Heart Grammar School, Newry. County Down. Northern Ireland

My project was based in a packaging company that produces corrugated board, where manufacturing efficiency is essential for competitive business.<br><br>I designed a device for use on the Board Machine, which improved safety for machine operators, dramatically reduced downtime of the machine (by 77%), and reduced waste. The project was installed and now other factories with the same problem are considering the improvement.<br><br>A common problem in manufacturing of corrugated board is ‘Delamination’, where paper liners do not stick successfully. Rejection of this unstable board prevents the machine from jamming. Initially, two technicians were required to overcome this problem; one to identify the fault, and the other to operate the Shear to remove it. One technician could not do both since the control panel was twenty metres from the Laminator (detection point).<br><br>The solution involved remote controls for the Shear located next to the Laminator. This meant time was not lost in co-ordinating two operators, reducing the chance of the machine jamming. The speed of the machine varies for different jobs so a ‘distance delay’ was required. The delay meant the twenty metres of ‘good’ board, already in the machine, was not discarded. <br><br>A ‘Trumeter’ measuring wheel and ‘Incremental Encoder’ measure the distance from the Laminator to the shear in pulses. A Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) counts the pulses and signals the shear to start. The PLC program was written using ‘Siemens Logo!’ software.<br><br>As this is a large multinational company, implementation of this device will produce substantial savings worldwide. <br><br>

THE DUCTBOT AN ADVANCEMENT IN HOUSEHOLD HYGIENICS
Matthew Taylor Stegall
HBS Academy Charlotte, North Carolina USA

People do not realize the danger of the indoor air they breathe and most do not know what is lurking in their environment. When turning on the HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) system, air is not the only substance that flows from the vent. Particles of pollen, skin, dust mite feces, hair, pet dander and numerous bits of random materials, the main indoor allergens, are unfortunately trapped in household air ducts contributing to illness. The purpose of this project is to design, build and develop a robotic device and vacuum system to clean household ductwork and reduce indoor air allergens. The Ductbot was designed and constructed using common materials and modified after testing to meet the design goals. Ductbot system performance was evaluated by comparing photographic information obtained during testing. In this project the researcher observed that the Ductbot worked and met overall design goals but required development through several modifications. The hypothesis is proven correct through experimentation. The Ductbot did remove and reduce the amount of pollutants, dirt and debris inside the duct thereby decreasing the amount of indoor air allergens. With repeated testing, redesign and modifications, the Ductbot improved and currently is fully functional and more efficient. With further development the Ductbot has many real world applications for improving indoor air quality.

DEVELOPMENT OF A ROCKET LAUNCHED PARAFOIL CONTROLLED AERIAL IMAGING PLATFORM
Spencer Wolf Greaves
University School of Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA

The ability to accurately identify points of interest on the ground from aerial vehicles for scientific research or military operations in a time efficient and economical manner is becoming increasingly important in today’s world. However, there are certain situations were the technology available is unable to perform the tasks required. The purpose of this project is to develop a rocket launched platform which is recovered and controlled using an inflated nylon parafoil to examine an area of the ground using an imaging system outfitted on the platform. Using a Global Positioning System (GPS) downlink from the platform, the position and flight trajectory can be plotted in real time and then controlled using a series of remotely controlled servos outfitted on the platform. All sub-systems, the servo parafoil control system, the GPS tracking and downlink system and the imaging system are all designed for live transmission so that all data is streamed through various frequencies to ground control computers. Individual component sub-system testing has been fully evaluated and completed to establish flight readiness of the prototype platform for rocket deployment. The platform has been engineered and manufactured to be hermetically sealed and rugged to deal with a wide variety of terrain. The full system has been designed to be potentially outfitted with various imaging systems such as thermal imagers for a wide variety of scientific applications such as the detection of hydrothermal pollution as well as military applications like fast-response reconnaissance missions.

ENERGY EFIECENT HOUSES
Courtney Michelle Blockburger
Harmony Grove High School, Benton , Arkansas, United States of America

In this project, a way to maintain a constant temperature inside a home was found. The plans of a trombe house were created. Then a computer program was modified with a temperature chip that powered the attic fans. When the attic fan was acitvated, either the hot air was circulated out of the house, or the trombe wall warmed the living space. The data showed that the hypothesis was correct. In week one, the homes adjusted to the outside temperature and did not produce valuable data. However, week two produced valuable data points and showed that the living space maintained a constant temperature of 3-5 degrees Celsius or 66-68 degrees Fahrenheit. Hopefully, this project will help show that there are effective, alternate ways to heat and cool your home that will save you money.

CARBON NANOTUBES: THE FUTURE OF TECHNOLOGY
David Patrick Daniel Loan
ASMSA, Hot Springs AR, USA

This project was designed to develop an effective thin film for manipulating shape memory alloys in various applications. The main focus was to compare thin films constructed of either carbon nanotubes or graphite particles, embedded in polyurethane. The experimenter desired to find if the amalgamation of the conductive and nonconductive materials would yield an effective manipulative thin film. Results from experimentation were substantive enough to assert a conclusion supportive of the hypothesis.<br><br> Effectiveness of the thin films was based on two characteristics: efficiency in conducting electricity, and cost effectiveness. The thin films were composed of a non-conducting polymer, polyurethane, and one of two conducting substances, carbon nanotubes or graphite particles. Efficiency was based on the amount of current that was passed with each weight percent of the two films. The carbon nanotube thin films proved to be much more electrically efficient.<br><br> After the experimentation, it was concluded that the carbon nanotube thin films were also more cost efficient. The cost effectiveness was based on the cost of implementing either thin film in a real application. Even though the graphite particles are much cheaper than carbon nanotube, the nanotube thin films were concluded more effective because they required a much smaller volume.<br><br> The hypothesis was supported through experimentation. Since an effective thin film was found, it can be successfully implemented with shape memory alloys to accomplish many tasks. <br><br>

COMPUTER CONTROLLED PNEUMATIC LAUNCH SYSTEM WITH GPS TARGETING
Scott Michael Schiavone
Covenant Christian Academy, Huntsville, AL, USA

The purpose of this project was to determine the targeting accuracy of a computer controlled long range (500+ meter) pneumatic launch system. How close can an aerodynamic projectile get to a designated target by incorporating Global Positioning System (GPS) targeting and modeling ballistic drag of the projectile. <br><br> The launcher was constructed with a fill and fire valve and pressure sensor that were controlled remotely by a laptop computer. A computer program was designed to control the launcher as well as calculate all the launch parameters based upon GPS targeting and aerodynamic drag equations. Error analysis was performed to estimate system miss distance. Field testing was performed to calibrate the system and to determine the actual system performance. Results were then compared to predicted values. <br><br> Field testing proved that the computer could accurately control the launcher as planned. Designing and constructing a long range aerodynamic projectile proved to be very challenging. The computer program calculated all the launch equations and was able to fire the launcher at a target. Through field testing the launcher, the average miss distance to target that was 500 meters away was determined to be 17.5 meters. Predictions were 9.8 meters in ideal conditions.<br><br> The launcher was successfully constructed along with the computer program that controls the launcher. The computer program calculated the physics equations required for the launch, along with monitoring and controlling the valves on the cannon to accurately control the cannon. Through field testing the accuracy of the launcher was determined. <br><br>

THE DIRT ON BASEBALL STANDARDIZING THE BASEBALL MUDDING PROCESS
Cameron Kruse
Homeschool, Colorado Springs, CO, United States

According to Major League Baseball rule, 3.01(c) baseballs must be rubbed with mud to remove the gloss. This procedure, which is performed by hand, produces inconsistent coloring between baseballs. <br><br>A machine was designed, built, and programmed to rub baseballs with a uniform color and consistent weight change. It uses lasers, sensors, and motors, to detect the placement of the baseball, and to spin the ball along three axes of rotation against a mildly abrasive surface.<br><br>After noting the machine’s homogeneous application of mud to consecutive balls, the increase in the baseball’s weight from the mudding process was used to quantify the consistency between balls. The machine was first calibrated, and 1/8 tsp official Lena Blackburne Baseball Rubbing Mud was added to the rubbing surface. Initial weight of a new, official Pacific Coast League baseball was recorded, and the ball was rubbed by the machine. Final weight was recorded. Minus calibration, this process was performed for 9 balls. This procedure was repeated three separate times. A control of 18 professionally, hand-rubbed baseballs were similarly assessed.<br><br>Machine rubbed baseballs were homogeneous in color and showed minimal weight change variation (standard deviation 0.00-0.03). Hand-rubbed baseballs were inconsistently colored and weight variation was significantly higher (standard deviation 0.29-0.30).<br><br>As of 3/15/2007, additional machine testing is being conducted, to obtain a larger sample size in the intended area of use.<br><br>These machine-mudded baseballs have been used in professional baseball games, and could soon replace hand-mudded balls in order to further standardize the game.<br><br>

MOBILE ROBOT INTELLIGENCE FOR COOPERATIVE AUTONOMOUS NAVIGATION
Elizabeth Charlotte Coquillette
Hathaway Brown School, Shaker Heights, Ohio, USA

The goal of this project is to develop small autonomous mobile robots that can navigate collaboratively in a mock urban environment. Technology used includes programs written using the National Instruments LabVIEW 8.20 graphical development platform; sensors, motors, and building materials made by LEGO® MINDSTORMS™ NXT; and Bluetooth® wireless communication between the robots and a central computer. <br><br>Currently, the robots have accomplished several goals: line following, intersection recognition, intersection precedence, computer-robot communication, and obstacle avoidance. Each robot can follow a line using three grayscale light sensors and programming logic incorporating decision-making for each of eight possible black-white color combinations for the three sensors. Each robot can recognize and communicate to a central computer when it has reached the beginning, midpoint, and end of an intersection and can receive information from the computer about whether another robot is in the intersection, allowing it to prevent collisions by waiting until the intersection is clear before crossing. The robots use ultrasonic distance sensors to stop when an obstacle is sensed in close range. All of the robots’ decisions, locations, and sensor values are recorded on the central computer, and a user on the central computer can control aspects such as target robot, speed of motors, and program status. <br><br>This research could be used to improve and automate transportation and provide extra safety and performance features on normally human-controlled cars. Coordinated autonomous robotic vehicles could help to increase efficiency on roadways by reducing traffic jams, preventing accidents, increasing average speed, reducing pollution, and conserving energy.<br><br>

IMPROVING MILEAGE EFFICIENCY OF HYBRID CARS
Ruby Kandah
William Mason High School, Mason Ohio, USA

"Improving the mileage efficiency of hybrid cars<br><br>Abstract<br><br><br>The purpose of this project is to increase the mileage efficiency of hybrid cars on the highways as well as in city driving through the use of a constructed device that depends on the suspension system rather than the braking system of a hybrid car, to generate electrical power. The device created by this project transforms mechanical work generated by the up and down movement of the car's suspension system, into electric power. The electric power so generated would be in addition to the current regenerative braking mechanism currently used in hybrid cars. This additional electric power would result in boosting the mileage of a hybrid car 10-50%, depending on the sizing of my device and the driving conditions. My device can also be used in non hybrid cars to store power in batteries, which can then be plugged into a home electric circuit for powering home devices. Another aspect of this device is the fact that it will always be running, so even when it is supplying electrical current to the car it will still be recharging the battery bank.<br><br>"<br><br>

EMERGENCY SOLAR WATER PASTEURIZATION
Rebecca Ann Ehrhardt
Home school, Hamilton, NJ, USA

Most people know that boiling water for at least 1 minute, at sea level, will kill bacteria, viruses, and parasites such as Salmonella, Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Vibrio Cholerae, making it safer to drink. (Note: pasteurizing does not remove pesticides and heavy metals.)<br><br>However, people may not know that heating water to a lower temperature for a longer period of time works just as well. For example, heating to 65°C for one hour, or to 60°C for two hours, is as effective as boiling. These lower temperatures can be reached by solar heating systems.<br><br>My project uses solar energy to heat water enough to pasteurize it on a winter day in New Jersey. I will use materials such as bubble wrap, black plastic bags, aluminum foil, and a "space blanket". I will experiment to compare different designs using identical plastic water bottles, with various combinations of these common materials.<br><br>The possibility of using household materials to pasteurize drinking water has many important uses, such as after natural disasters (earthquakes, Hurricane Katrina), for places with contaminated well water, and for people lost in the woods (Giardia contaminates many rivers and lakes).<br><br>I captured 50-60% of the sun's energy with my best design. I raised its temperature 28°C (from 21°C to 49°C), and keep it there over two hours. Changes (such as starting with body-temperature water (37°C)) or preheating might be enough to pasteurize water with the design; New Orleans in the summer would definitely have reached pasteurization temperature.

DEVELOPING S.C.R.A.P.S.: THE SELF-CONTAINED, ROBUST, ANTHROPOMORPHIC, POWERED SKELETON; AN APPLICATION IN FLYWHEEL ENGINEERING
Ian Michael Bouligny
Catholic High School, New Iberia, Louisiana, United States of America

The purpose of this project was to design and build a unit to imitate a stable, dynamic walk with anthropomorphic properties. A study of human motion was fundamental in building a biped to enhance strength and endurance of the body, so a Motion Measuring Device was constructed to measure details of angles, load, and stress points of human walking. Plans for actuator movement were developed from the data. The actuators were powered by drive-wheels, which run on a flywheel. Bearings on the flywheel move toward the center when the foot is lifted, and toward the end when the foot is depressed. This open-linkage actuator amplifies force and allows the wearer to walk with ease. Amplitudes and frequencies show near-perfect alignment between conventional walking and with the unit, which indicates that there is hardly an uncomfortable moment when walking. S.C.R.A.P.S. is engineered to show an overall improvement in stability, robustness, steady walking, a friendlier user interface, and a much more reliable machine in comparison to Phase II. Applications of S.C.R.A.P.S include a faster recovery rate in physical therapy, as well as an active prosthesis for amputees. Possible areas of improvements included quality building materials, using planetary screws, and turnbuckle-based actuators.

DIRECTIONALITY IN A FAST NEUTRON DETECTOR
Alexander Robert Hagen
Jefferson High School, Lafayette, IN, USA

When a neutron is passed through tensile pressures in an acoustic field, a cavitation forms. This will detect the presence of neutrons. Because , the direction from where the neutron originated can be determined by the position of the cavitation in the container.<br><br> Because of the complexity of the simulation and the limits on the computer technology to model, a simplified three-dimensional model was used to test this chamber. The model was made in COMSOL 3.3, a multiphysics modeling program. The acoustics portion of the model was formed, using acetone as the container and simulating the pressure field generated by a piezoelectric element. <br><br> The cavitation could be modeled using the Rayleigh-Plesset equation ( ), but because of solver capabilities, a simplification was used. This cavitation was a micrometer sphere in the affected volume of the chamber. The acoustic signal it puts out during implosion was modeled. Four points, simulating microphones, were then analyzed to find the times it took the wave to travel to these microphones. It was found that the ideal placement for the microphones was three on one plane, 90os apart, and one on another plane 90os apart from the other microphones. An algorithm was then set up to solve the time differences and positions for the cavitation position. The algorithm brought back perfect results to experimental tests. <br><br> A program is in creation for the model and chamber to find the position in real time. This program has brought back moderately accurate results in the model and has not yet been developed completely for the chamber.

LIGHTING THE THIRD WORLD
John Anthony Bolander
Saint Xavier High School, Louisville, Kentucky, Jefferson

The goal I set out to accomplish in this project was to design a lighting system for third world countries. Third world countries currently rely upon substandard lighting systems such as kerosene lanterns, which are not efficient, burn valuable fossil fuels, and pollute the air. I need my product to be reusable and within the price range of $25 to $35. <br><br> So that my product would be renewable, I used solar panels to charge rechargeable batteries and then the batteries ran LEDs. I tested the voltage and current that two different types of solar cells produced through out the day as well as whether the solar cells charged the different types of batteries. Then I proceeded to test how long different batteries lasted while discharging though different LEDs. I measured the efficiency of the different LEDs I tested and went to a lab to test several different ways of making a sheet of LEDs. <br><br> I have determined that solar cells give enough current flow to charge my batteries. I have also seen that the Ni-MH batteries should provide enough milliamp hours to sustain the amount of light I want for four hours. <br><br> With the data that I have gathered thus far I am certain that an effective lighting system can be produced within the price range. To further the advancement of this product I would like to finish building a light sheet. I also wish to incorporate a circuit that can switch the batteries from parallel to series.<br><br>

I'M GONNA WING IT
Lauren Anne Cobb
Cobb Christian Academy, Savannah, Georgia USA

This science investigation was developed due to the experimenter's interest in aerodynamics and motion. The intent of the project was to discover what type of slotted camber wing shape would demonstrate the most amount of lift and the least amount of drag.<br><br> The procedures were accomplished with the use of a wind tunnel and a slotted camber wing where the trailing edge was bent down 0 degrees, 30 degrees, 45 degrees and 60 degrees and was tested at each of these angles at the low speed of 30 mph.<br><br> The collected data from the experiment was not what was assumed. Half of the wing shapes that were tested abided by the hypothesis, and the other half demonstrated results different than expected. The wing that produced the most lift was the wing with a trailing edge of 60 degrees; however, this wing also showed the most drag.<br><br> The conclusions proven by this experiment do agree with current literature concerning rates of lift and drag, yet no wing would meet the criteria of having little drag and much lift. Due to my initial research, incorrect assumptions were made about slotted wings. Upon reaching the conclusions based on the data collected, it was realized that while the experiment proved in line with other research, the way in which pilots use these principles vary due to their own personal preference, the aircraft being flown, the conditions in which they fly, and the different maneuvers performed in the air.

Design and Development of Automated Angling Device<br><br><br>Winter angling is a difficult task. In order to catch a fish it is necessary to drill a hole in the ice through which the bait is lowered. It is essential that the bait is kept moving to attract the fish. The manual control of the bait is demanding and requires constant attention.<br><br>The aim of this project was to develop a device that automates angling. I call this device Robotic Fisherman. The device simulates the movements of specific types of bait and continually repeats it. The movements were simulated using the well-known physical theory of ‘Random Walk’. When the Robotic Fisherman detects that the fish took the bait, it automatically pulls the fish out of the water and above the ice.<br><br>The Robotic Fisherman has several adjustable features and additional functions. For example, the device can be monitored and controlled remotely by using a wireless camera. It is also very robust and can therefore be used in adverse weather conditions. <br><br>I have tested the device by practical use. I correlated the number of fish caught per day with the various bait movements. It was determined that the best results for carnivorous fish were obtained with a random walk dispersion of 20cm. Further, I have proven that the Robotic Fisherman is more sensitive and faster than humans by about 30%. Extensive testing of Robotic Fisherman proved that this device is very useful tool especially in countries with cold climate. <br><br>

SOLAR SOLUTIONS TO WATER THE WORLD - SOLAR STILL - PURIFICATION
Ilya Kudruavtchev Rogers
Brunswick High, Brunswick Georgia, United States

The reasoning behind the investigation of the efficiency of the solar still was the fact that one-third of the world’s population does not have safe drinking water. The solar still is an effective and efficient, low cost, purification system. The solar still will produce purified water for safe drinking from polluted water.<br><br>Polluted water samples were tested for toxic chemicals using water testing strips. Once this was completed, polluted water was placed into the solar still and left for a day. At the end of each day the purified water was tested using water testing strips.<br><br>The tests conducted showed that the solar still worked efficiently. The samples of polluted water and purified water were compared. The comparison showed that the solar still eliminated all the pollutants and salts from the water, resulting in sanitary drinking water.<br><br>The solar still was an efficient method for purifying water. Although Weather conditions such as cloudy or rainy days prevented much water from being purified, the solar still produced purified drinking water. In future research, a larger solar still may be constructed and more testing will be conducted.<br><br>

ELECTRICITY FROM RAIN: THE KELVIN WATER DROPPER AND VOLTAGE PRODUCTION FROM VARIOUS LIQUIDS
Nathaniel Morck Beaver
Perham High School, Perham, MN, U.S.A.

This experiment was conducted with the purpose of determining which liquids increased the voltage production of the Kelvin water dropper. It was hypothesized that liquids with more free ions would produce a higher voltage. After a working model was built, different liquids were used to determine which produced the largest voltage. Probably due to increased free ions, weak acids and salt solutions produced a much higher voltage than water. Distilled water produced a higher voltage than hydrogen peroxide, and tap water produced the least of all. Theoretical voltage calculations indicated than the current produced was very low. It is theorized that an improved model could be used as an alternative source of energy in rainy climates.

GYRO BIKE
Montana Duke Wilson
Wolf Point High School, Wolf Point, MT USA

This project in its present form is the result of experimentation of engineering technology on the affect of the gyroscope upon a bicycle. The initial idea was to create a bike that utilizes the center of gravity to stay upright, replacing training wheels. Some success with the gyroscope eventually led to the formulation of a bicycle that was stable enough to provide stability at low and high speeds.<br><br> The efficiency of the Gyro Bike was determined by means of ghost testing. Ghost testing was where I pushed the bike being tested forward without a rider on it and measured how far it went until it fell over. A regular bike and Gyro Bike were used as the test systems. The efficiency was measured in terms of maximum distance traveled. An attempt was made to keep the force being applied during testing consistent. The effective distance the Gyro Bike traveled was thirty feet. The regular bike would travel an average distance of ten feet before falling over. <br><br> Therefore, the Gyro Bike remained up for ten times as long as the regular bike. Use of the Gyro Bike during testing led to the precession in the manner in which the Gyro Bike fell. As it began to fall, the gyroscope turned the wheel in the direction of the fall and the bike turned in a large arc before falling down.<br><br> The benefit of this project is that the gyroscope utilized through the Gyro Bike, replaced training wheels.<br><br> <br><br>

AN OPTICAL SENSOR TO ASSESS HIGH INTENSITY DISCHARGE LAMP AGE THROUGH SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
Carl A. Turner
New Prague High School, New Prague, Minnesota, United States

High intensity discharge (HID) lamps are known for their efficient operation and extensive use in the lighting field. While high intensity discharge lamps have a very long life, they do eventually fail. Currently, the problem with HID lamps is when they fail they are required to be serviced individually. This results in significantly higher maintenance costs that scheduled replacement. <br><br> The project was to investigate ways to make the prototype sensor more accurate and selective without significantly increasing the overall cost. A monochromator was used to analysis the spectral of different age high pressure sodium lamps. From this data a more selective optical filter combination was identified. The lumen fluctuation caused by the lamp’s AC power was also identified as an issue and resolved. This increased the accuracy and sensitivity of the sensor for identifying the subject HPS lamp’s relative age. Also by expanding upon ratio method, the sensor was able to self detect the type of high intensity discharge lamp, resulting in a more practical sensor. Improvements made allowed the sensor to be used in real world applications to provide a solution to HID maintenance costs. With millions of high intensity discharge lamps across the world, this project creates a realistic method to assess lamp age. This practical device will revolutionize the way that high intensity discharge lamps are maintained. <br><br>

SUSTAINABLE ENERGY SYSTEM FOR A GREEN STRUCTURE (S.E.S.G.S)
Vivian Lynette Rivera 
Academia Nuestra Senora de la Providencia, San Juan, Puerto Rico

The problem with the future crisis of oil and global warming has made the countries to look for alternatives to obtain energy. It is expected that within 30 to 40 years, it will be more difficult to obtain crude oil and its prices will rise. Scientists and experts have taken the task of using alternate sources in order to obtain energy and turning them into possible solutions. The sources known to obtain energy are the sun and the wind. Taking advantage of the fact that people know these resources, they have been used for this project in a design, able to offer energy to low cost and with the same capacity of the electrical energy.<br><br> Inspired by the conservation of the environment and the quality of life on the Earth, a third source of energy generation has been integrated. A generator with organic fuel has been accepted as a third option in alternate resources. The "Bio-diesel" is a fuel made of vegetal oil, combined with the methanol and a catalyst, Sodium Hydroxide. This fuel goes through a process of breaking down triglyceride molecules and converting them in a simple molecule such as a monoglyceride so that the solution is much more uniform. This process is called transesterification, where the solution finally becomes the product and as well, the sediment becomes the glycerin. After the process, according to ASMT PS 121 specifications of the U.S. government for quality control of homemade fuels, the Biodiesel it is purified on special filters that cleans out the unsuitable sediment and is refined with ethanol obtaining a completely biodegradable fuel.<br><br> These resources of energy can work independently or altogether, charging the batteries or connected directly to the house so that the electric appliances can work. The technology of the Sustainable Energy System is based on this is<br><br>

ALFRED II (ARTIFICIAL LIFE FORM FOR ROBOTIC EVOLUTIONARY DEVELOPMENT) THE NEXT GENERATION OF ROBOTIC EVOLUTIONARY DEVELOPMENT
Alexander (Sasha) Eric Siy
Steller Secondary School, Anchorage, Alaska

ALFRED II (Artificial Life Form for Robotic Evolutionary Development) is an ongoing project aimed at researching adaptive control systems in robotics-based applications. During the course of the second phase of this project, an electronic control system was built for MicroBot, a small robot that is easier to work with than the six legged ALFRED robot. Using the knowledge that was gained through this experimentation, a highly capable control system was designed and built for the ALFRED II robot. This was accomplished through the use of CAD software, circuit board design and construction, and programming of the electrical systems in PICBasic Pro. The resulting control system contains the necessary resources for adaptive control system research using the ALFRED platform. A sonar sensor system that can measure distances was also designed and built for the ALFRED II robot. This sonar device precisely measures distances to detected objects within its range of over ten feet--a thirteen-fold increase in distance sensing ability from the first generation robot. Other sensors will be interfaced to the robot through a 32-channel sensor interface that was designed and built for the ALFRED II robot. These components will provide the platform necessary for adaptive control system research. They will allow the robot to create associational data between sensor states over a given period of time. This will in turn allow the robot to learn from and adapt to its surroundings depending on the associations created.

EMERGENCY VEHICLE ALERT SYSTEM PART 5
Justine Alyson Fortier
LaSalle Academy, Providence Rhode Island, United States

The main objective of this research project is to design and build a device that detects the frequencies of sirens and warns a hearing impaired driver that a rescue vehicle is approaching. This device consists of a microphone, five narrow bandpass filters, and a heads-up LED display driven by VU meter chips. <br><br>For this year’s research, I tested the accuracy, safety, and effectiveness of the device while operating inside of a moving vehicle. The microphone component of the device was positioned on the exterior of the car in order to detect any possible siren frequencies. The five narrow bandpass filters serve to isolate the frequency range between 800Hz and 1600Hz, which is the range for rescue vehicle sirens. The VU meters drive five columns of LEDs corresponding to each of the five filters. This spectrograph display was positioned in such a manner so as to reflect off of the operator’s windshield. This form of display indicated the presence of a rescue vehicle without compromising the safety of the driver. A preamplifier was incorporated into the circuit design in order to amplify the source signal picked up by the microphone. This change serves to make the display more responsive to sirens at lower amplitudes. This feature enables the driver to know of the presence of a rescue vehicle in time to react properly and safely. The interference of wind noise was also tested, and observed to be insignificant at speeds between 20 and 30 miles per hour.<br><br>The results obtained during experimentation prove that this device can be built to work effectively inside of a moving vehicle in order to warn a hearing impaired driver of an approaching rescue vehicle, and without compromising the driver’s safety.

MAKING AN AUTOMATIC DOOR OPENER
Robert Henri LaPlante
Bishop Hendricken High School Warwick, RI USA

This engineering project in its current form is designed to help people with disabilities that affect everyday accessibility in using doors. Foremost, the device should be able to open and close almost any door effectively. It is specifically designed around the issues that arise with paraplegia. The idea was influenced by the condition of my grandfather.<br><br> In this project I set many goals for me to accomplish throughout my procedure. The primary objective that would separate my device from current door opening technologies was to have the ability of complete portability. I wanted the device to be set up easily and within a few minutes. It should not leave permanent damage to its surroundings. The device was tested under different conditions to make sure it was effective in accomplishing these tasks.<br><br> The final design used a pulley system to open the door and the natural tendencies of two springs to close it. The pulley system was operated by an old hospital bed motor, which was further operated by a system of switches derived from the parts of a toy car. Because of the inclusion of a toy car’s mechanics, the entire system could be controlled by the car’s remote control. The angles and forces being used allowed the device to ultimately stay in place, and basic clamps allowed the device to be attached to the door.<br><br> This project could contribute by creating a portable and affordable device that would allow people with limitations in transportation to gain independence and be able to have greater accessibility.<br><br>

SPACELOCALIZATION OF ARBITRARY SOUND SIGNALS IN REAL TIME
Simon Schmitt
Kippenberg Gymnasium, Bremen, Germany

This project started out with the idea of tracing mosquitos in the dark by analysing nothing except the the buzzing. During the process of research and engineering the idea expanded and the localization algorithms that were implemented in a real time acoustic system are now applicable to signals and waves of many kinds in various media.<br><br>The position of a sound emitting object can be determined using several microphones, since the time when a signal reaches a microphone depends on the microphones' known and the object's unknown position. This relation can be used to obtain the object's position, after having measured the tiny time differences between the arrivals. <br><br>However, the implementation of this simple principle turned out to be non-trivial, since the signal is disturbed by several factors such as reverberation, acoustic noise as well as hardware issues like electrically induced noise especially when using self-made equipment. <br><br>After setting up the hardware, the main part of research was dedicated to these problems. Therefore designing a fault-tolerant algorithm was essential for the project's success, as small mismeasurements can cause an enormous error in the determined position. Furthermore the results were significantly improved by inventing criteria and formulas to evaluate the signal's quality, separating the real data from noise signals, and verifying them with redundant data. In addition, guidelines for placing the microphones to minimize reverberation were developed.<br><br>The system indicates a localized object's position by pointing at it with a laser pointer mounted on the ladder of a model fire truck.

DESIGNING AND CONSTRUCTING A MORE ACCURATE PEDOMETER
Sarah Frances Doyle
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland Oregon, USA

The goal of this engineering project was to design, construct, and test a pedometer more accurate than current designs. The pedometer design uses sound to precisely measure the length of each step a user takes, and then determines the total distance moved. The pedometer is controlled by a Java program, and is made up of remote sensors and buzzers mounted on the shoes of a user. The pedometer works by emitting a sound from the heel of one shoe, and measuring the time the sound takes to reach a microphone on the toe of the other shoe. The Java program I created controls the remote devices by writing byte length commands to a relay board via the serial port. It then calculates the distance a user travels, and displays the program output in a window. I tested the pedometer design by placing the sound activated switch several measured distances from the buzzer. I then ran the pedometer, and recorded the distance it had measured. I found that the prototype was accurate to +-1.6 m, which was nearly as accurate as I had predicted based on the prototype design. Although the accuracy is fairly low, the consistency between the test results and the predicted results proves the soundness of the design concept. The accuracy could easily be improved by increasing the connection speed between the computer and the relays. A few modifications to the prototype would make this pedometer nearly 100% accurate, considerably better than current designs.

Kelcy Stephen Anderson
Monroe High School Albany,Ga. United States

The purpose of this project was to determine how the shape of the winglet affects the flight of a sailplane. The experiment was conducted by building three sailplanes. Each sailplane was marked withe a different color marker.(red,black,and yellow)The red sailplane had the highest aspect ratio. The black sailplane was second. The yellow sailplane was third.<br><br> A launcher was constructed to launch each sailplane with the same force. An initial starting point was marked on the floor. From this point the sailplane were launched. Each sailoplane was launched five times. When launched, the point at witch the sailplanes hit the ground was recorded. The red sailplane flew an average distance of 25.38 feet. The black sailplane flew an average distance of 19.56 feet. The yellow flew an average distance of 15.84 feet.<br><br> It was hypothesised that the red sailplane would fly farther than the black and yellow sailplanes. It was concluded thqat the red sailplane flew farther than the blackand yellow sailplanes.

VIRTUAL WOODWIND DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A VIRTUAL WOODWIND INSTRUMENT
Colby Anne Wilkason
Warner Robins High School, 401 South Davis Drive, Warner Robins, GA 31088 USA

Creating a Virtual Woodwind. The purpose of this experiment was to create a virtual woodwind musical instrument. The Virtual Woodwind reads each of the player's fingering positions in real time to produce notes by using a combination of flex sensors, a data acquisition device, buffer circuits, and computer software. The hypothesis was if the scientist can create an electronic device that uses standard woodwind fingerings to play music, without an actual instrument, then she would create a virtual woodwind instrument. The hypothesis was accepted. The independent variables were the finger positions of the gloves. The dependent variables were the resistance of the flex sensors, the notes produced, and the voltage into the data acquisition device. The controlled variables were the voltage range and gain of the buffer circuit, the software algorithm, and selection of the date acquisition device. In this experiment, the scientist manipulated the ten flex sensors inserted into two gloves to reproduce oboe fingerings that correspond to notes played on a real oboe. The data from these flex sensors pass through buffer circuits and a data acquisition device into the Virtual Woodwind software. This software reads the data from the sensors to "learn" the assigned notes. The software then allows the player to play notes by statistically comparing the played notes against the learned notes.

THE EFFECT OF HAIR DYE ON THE TENSILE STRENGTH OF HAIR
Hannah Marie Dotseth
Burlington Community High School, Burlington, Iowa USA

How much are you really damaging the hair when dying it, if any damage occurs at all? It was hypothesized that the tensile strength of the hair would be weakened if the hair was dyed. Sixty hair samples were collected and divided into two groups of thirty, one of the groups of thirty being dyed. The pull tester is composed of a small hand drill mounted on a stand. The drill is turned on low and as it turns, the hair is stretched to its breaking point. Each hair was placed in a pull tester and was pulled while a dual-range force sensor measured the force being applied for 20 seconds or until it broke. After compiling the data, a statistical analysis was performed on the ultimate strength averages. The averages for dyed and non-dyed hair fell within the calculated confidence intervals at a 95% confidence level. However, the ultimate strength averages for dyed and non-dyed hair were numerically close together, .650 and .635 (N). To see if these numbers had a statistical difference a Null hypothesis test was performed. The calculated Z value fell into the critical point showing it not to be statistically significant. Therefore, from a statistical perspective the two averages of ultimate strength were not significantly different. This means that dyeing this particular type of hair has no affect on the ultimate strength. This disproves the hypothesis that if hair dye is applied to the hair, then the tensile strength of the hair will be weakened.

AUTOMATIC EMERGENCY SIRENS IDENTIFICATION IN INTELLIGENT TRAFFIC LIGHT SYSTEMS
Patricio Adans do Canto Bischoff
Escola Tecnica Estadual Monteiro Lobato, Rio Grande do Sul, BRASIL

Urban transportation is made difficult mainly by badly adjusted traffic lights, operating with outdated plans and without synchronism. One of the serious problems is generated by the incapacity to organize the flow of vehicles in an intelligent form, especially in situations involving police cars, ambulances, firemen and “imprisoned” cars waiting for the light to turn green to attend the emergency.<br><br> In this context, I developed a system that identifies the sound signal of these vehicles and commands the traffic lights intelligently to give preference to emergency vehicles. Using this system, emergency vehicles will not lose time in traffic and general vehicles will optimally flow in crossroads.<br><br> This research started with a bibliographical research on the flow of vehicles in public ways. Later, simulations of the circuits and laboratory tests were conducted to enable the prototype implementation.<br><br> The prototype was tested and shows the perfect functioning of the system since it immediately detects the origin of the sound of an emergency siren and commands all the traffic lights in the specific crossroad: all the traffic lights turn red except for the light of the street where the emergency siren comes from that turns green.<br><br> Also, an optimized management of the alternation of traffic lights status (red, yellow, green) can be observed which confirms the initial expectation of the project and shows that the utilization of this system can collaborate to reduce the time an emergency vehicle takes to reach the victims and possibly save lives.

THE WATER WASTE REDUCING SYSTEM OR REDUCTION BOX
Wilkinson Nascimento dos Santos
Escola Estadual Presidente Tancredo Neves, Boa Vista, Roraima, Brazil

Water is one of the most important resources of our planet and water waste a major environmental problem. Standard taps do not collaborate with water waste reduction. <br><br>The water waste reducing system or reduction box is a device I invented. It is a device that can be installed on the plumbs of homes and factories with the goal to obtain a significant reduction on the waste of water that reaches approximately 78%.<br><br> Presently there are no such systems or devices for sale, except for sensitive taps, that work with both hands, providing comfort instead of economical result. With sensitive taps the water keeps flowing for a while after the hands are removed and as a consequence water and electricity are wasted. Such taps are not frequently used in the region I live in because of their price, because of the electrical energy they consume and because of the water they waste.<br><br> The goal of this project was to develop a solution to these inconveniences (cost, electricity consumption, water waste). <br><br>I developed an automatic mechanical system that controls the amount of water and brings great efficiency in terms of economy and usage. The device is composed of a mechanical mechanism that has a spring that is the source of the static force and does all the work.

DESIGN OF A COMPACT EXERCISE MACHINE FOR ASTRONAUTS
Sean Alan Davis
Orange High School, Pepper Pike, OH, USA

In a weightless environment, astronauts carry little or no weight on their leg muscles or back muscles normally used for maintaining posture. As a result, these muscles weaken and reduce in size. Loss of muscle strength during an extended mission could pose dramatic problems in the event of an emergency situation. <br><br>In terms of the skeleton, the benefits of exercising on Earth are widely accepted. Many studies have shown that a relatively small number of weight-loading cycles may be sufficient to maintain adequate bone density. This includes developing exercise protocols for patients with osteoporosis. In microgravity a variety of such exercise plans are used; however jumping may provide a more efficient and less time consuming way to address the problem of bone loss. <br><br>An important factor that must be taken into account when designing exercise devices for astronauts is the size of the device. Currently the size of an exercise device does not have a large affect on manned space missions, because the missions are relatively short and thus only a limited amount of supplies would be necessary to take on board the space craft. For a potential manned mission to Mars, however, a large amount of supplies will be necessary, thus a small exercise machine would be very beneficial as it would allow more room for other materials.

THE BEAUTY OF SOUND - AN ENGINEERING APPROACH TO MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS
Yu-Jung Lin
National Taichung Wenhua Senior High School, Taichung, Taiwan

Playing musical instrument is to make sounding part produce stationary wave so as to give off various gentle sounds and tones. According to different modes of sound producing, musical instruments which comprising vibrator (sounding part) and resonator can be divided into stringed instruments, wind instruments and percussion instruments. Three essentials of sound include amplitude, frequency and waveform: in which the amplitude decides the volume; tones are related to frequency; and the waveforms are composed of different frequency and volume. Various musical sounds are mainly due to different timbres and tones. Timbres, sounding characteristics of sounding part, are decided by waveform of the sounding part. Tone means pitch of the sound and is closely related to vibrating frequency of sounding part. Higher frequency makes higher tones, however, different tones decide pitch of a musical scale. Music composing and playing are necessarily connected with some music activities which include producing of stationary wave, discussion of temperament, measurement of frequency, establishment of vibrating mode of keys and observation of waveform. I adopt engineering tools such as frequency counter, wave inspector, ANSYS software, and Dynamic Analysis System to get further knowledge of technique of handling musical instrument wave. Experimental methods used in this article can provide reference for on-the-spot tuning that is needed for musical instrument tuner and designer. The engineering aspects explored in this research could serve as an effective base for the developing of cultural musical instruments.

HARNESSING THE HEAT ELECTRONIC COOLING METHODS
Alex Jack Quaintance
Muhlenberg High School, Laureldale, Pennsylvania

The purpose of this study was to establish design criteria for heat sinks used to cool electrical components. The data indicate it is possible to build a heat sink with a thermal resistance of close to 0.10 C/W, which is phenomenal for a heat sink of this type.<br><br> Manufacturer's data sheets for heat sinks ranging from simple to complex types were analyzed to determine the effects of design parameters on the thermal transfer process. Some of the factors studied were mass of the material, forced convection, fin height/thickness and use of thermal compound. A few heat sinks were assembled and tested. The heat sinks assembled for this study utilized cooling pipes of both aluminum and copper. <br><br> The compiled data and experimental testing suggested the best heat sink design will have large mass, large surface area, high convection, thin fins, and the ability to apply high pressure between the heat sink and the heat source. The most important factor to the best performance is the use of heat pipe technology. When this heatsink is applied the data suggests that silver thermal compound be used.<br><br>

ALARM SYSTEM FOR DROWNING IN SWIMMING POOLS
Jie Jin
The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China,Beijing,China

Drowning is a top one killer of the unnatural death of children between 3 and 14 years old. Therefore, we develop an "Alarm System for Drowning in Swimming Pools".<br><br>Adopting technology of wireless network communication in 2.4G, photoelectrical sensors and computer technology, this alarm system is reliable in detecting underneath water, information conveyance and data treatment. It consists of a drowning detector, an alarm handset and a computer data processor. Normally, the drowning detector sends signals to the alarm handset and computer at a fixed time. When a swimmer immerses his head in the water, the detector will not send signals, at the same time, the drowning detector, alarming handset and computer timing process start to operate. If the swimmer is still in the water beyond a specified timing threshold, the program estimates the swimmer is drowning. Then the detector emits radiance, indicating the location of the swimmer; the alarming handset and computer give light and sound for lifeguards to take measures to save drowned persons.<br><br>With a net-combining mode, it can be used for alarming in coastal bathing place or wider areas.<br><br>For the swimmer, Alarm System for Drowning in Swimming Pools is the perfect safeguard swimmer safety because this is the most efficacious.<br><br>

APPLYING AUTOMATION TO ROBOTICS WITH PROCESS CONTROL
Brian Michael Cherbak
Hanover Central High School, Cedar Lake, Indiana, United States

A system that maintains a process by feeding back a representative value of that process and comparing it to a desired value, then adjusting that process until the representative value matches the desired value is called process control. The representative value is called a process variable, and the desired value is a set-point. A programmable logic controller (PLC) is an electric device used in automation control that is interfaced by a written digital program to take the place of relays. They also have the ability to run analog process through proportional-integral-derivative (PID) loops.<br><br> This experiment investigates the further testing of the autonomous abilities of robotics in environments that are inhospitable. Its tests will be run using process control through PLC technology.<br><br> The entire construction was engineered to allow more payload while conserving energy. The duel-D design was engineered to have two degrees of freedom in the center to allow all four wheels of the vehicle to remain in contact with the ground at all times and steer. This concept is similar to NASA’s “rocker-bogie” suspension system.<br><br> Electrical design was also engineered to reserve weight and size, as well as versatility for changes in future testing. The PLC was chosen for its size and capability, as well as cost-effectiveness; it has twenty regular inputs and sixteen outputs, along with a separate analog card with two analog inputs and two outputs. This allows for on/off function as well as PID loops. State-of-the-art battery technology is used, along with innovative electrical concepts.<br><br>

SELF-CONSTRUCTED PORTABLE WHEELCHAIR LIFT
Matthew Kyle Smith
West Noble High School, Ligonier IN, US

With the growing population of elderly citizens, the need for wheelchairs and wheelchair lifts are on the rise. Current, available lifts cost over $3000, which makes them unaffordable for many people. Ramps are also available, but it takes about seven feet of ramp to go up one stair. A practical and cost effective solution needs to be found, so I set out to build a wheelchair lift that would lift a 450 pound person over three stairs and be portable enough to transport in their vehicle. Finally, my lift would also be simple enough for a person to build on their own.<br><br> After the lift was built I tested it on price, mobility, lifting ability, and strength. My lift priced well, costing 1/12 of current available lifts. In mobility, I found that people could move the lift and fit it easily into the back of a van. In my lift test I found that the lift rose up over twenty-one inches and came back down successfully. The strength test found that the lift could easily handle 450 pounds of weight without becoming significantly unstable. These results led me to conclude that in relation to my goals the lift was fairly successful.<br><br> My lift went through many different designs before I made my final decision. I then began building and encountered many difficulties. I still continue to modify it in order to achieve optimum stability, portability, and safety.<br><br>

Sophia Alexandra Goreczky
Plano West Senior High School, Plano, Texas, United States of America

The purpose of this project was to enhance the existing L.I.S.S.A. prototype device. The original prototype's feedback mechanism to the user had limitations and had no information on heading, or direction, for navigation purposes. Also, the data produced by the prototype was only available to the user wearing it. The challenge addressed here was focused on providing solutions to the aforementioned aspects. New criteria were established to guide the design and incorporation of enhancements into the prototype.<br><br> Options were examined to produce information on heading, prototype attitude, and connectivity to a host computer without physical contact. Selected options that sense magnetic fields, acceleration, and enable wireless connectivity were incorporated into the prototype without altering its form and minimal weight impact. Embedded software controlling the integration core was updated to transmit data to an interface application on a host computer. This application was designed and implemented to capture, condition, present, and allow the saving of data produced by the prototype. A visually impaired volunteer tested the prototype. Tests also included capturing, presenting, saving, and basic visualization of telemetry data.<br><br> The original prototype was successfully enhanced following the criteria established. The resulting prototype may now serve an expanded target audience: assisting visually impaired individuals, and researchers that are working to help them. Findings from this project can serve as the basis to continue improving real-time feedback information, consider adding other sensors, and using the data captured as input to improve indoor environment designs.<br><br>

TIME, LIFE INDICATORS, AND POWER SURGES OF OUTDOOR LIGHTING
Brandon Eric Northcut
Monterey High School, Lubbock, TX, USA

PURPOSE:The purpose of my experiment is to write a program that will check the incoming voltage of a lamp at any given time and either leave the power on, for normal conditions, or turn the power off, for less than normal conditions, such as a power surge.<br><br>HYPOTHESIS: If I write a program to make a circuit board to count the amount of time a light is operating, to check voltage and turn the lamp off during a power surge, then I will be able to use the program to calculate when the life of a lamp is near its maximum rated life by turning on a LED indicator at 75% of the lamps life and I will be able to prevent many lamps from being damaged from power surges by turning off the power to them. PROCEDURE: I will first write a program that will check the incoming voltage to the lamp at any given time. Then I will tell the program to turn the power off coming into the lamp if the voltage is not between 116 volts and 125 volts. <br><br>RESULTS: After writing the program and testing it under real conditions, I have found that my program works. The program not only turns on the LED indicator, but it also turns the incoming power off when the voltage is not between the written voltage window of 116 volts and 125 volts. <br><br>CONCLUSION: I have proven the program to work. The incoming power will be turned off while under less than normal conditions. The LED indicator light also comes on at 75% of the manufactured life of the lamp. My hypothesis was correct because I was able to write the program keeping time and turning on a LED at 75% of a lamps life, and turning the incoming power off when the voltage reaches damaging conditions preventing harm to the lamp.<br><br>

AN INEXPENSIVE MICROGRAVITY ENVIRONMENT
Alexandra Elizabeth Crook
Box Elder High School, Brigham City, Utah, USA

In microgravity materials and compounds can be created that cannot be made on the Earth’s surface. This is because chemicals mix better and crystals form with fewer defects in this environment. The cure for cancer may be found in compounds that can only be created in microgravity. <br><br>Because microgravity experiments can cost more than $10,000 per pound, research is very limited. Even a few seconds of inexpensive microgravity is useful for identifying the best experiments to run in longer duration, more expensive test facilities, such as the International Space Station.<br><br> <br><br>The engineering goal of this project was to establish the feasibility of conducting inexpensive, balloon lofted, microgravity experiments with the following capabilities: a) the ability to measure and record microgravity levels and duration, b) a method of starting and completing experiments during the period of microgravity, and c) a means of recovering the experiment.<br><br>A Systems Engineering approach was used to break this complicated project into parts. The functional requirement of each part was identified. A procedure was then developed to test each part to verify it would perform as intended. Parts were tested and then assembled into sub-systems, and the process was repeated. Finally, the sub-systems were combined into a system which was flight tested. <br><br>The systems engineering approach resulted in the identification of many design deficiencies that would have caused catastrophic failures, had they not been discovered. The project was successful in establishing the feasibility of conducting inexpensive, balloon lofted, microgravity experiments.<br><br>

SEMI-AUTONOMOUS UAV CONTROL USING ULTRASONIC MULTILATERATION
Tyson O. Boardman
Delta High School, Delta, Utah, USA

Control of a semi-autonomous unmanned air vehicle (UAV) can be executed using several different techniques. The global positioning system (GPS) is one method commonly used to track and guide a UAV. GPS, however, does not work well indoors because any object between the GPS receiver and the satellite obstructs the radio signal. The position of an object can be found using different locating methods. The four most common are: multilateration, angulation, proximity, and scene analysis. This project investigated the indoor computer control of a UAV utilizing an ultrasonic detection array and a novel multilateration calculation algorithm.<br><br> This experiment was performed using ultrasonic transceivers integrated with a system timing controller circuit linked to a personal computer (PC). The ultrasonic pulse Time of Flight (ToF) for each receiver was retrieved from its associated counter and the Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) was calculated using a laptop PC. The microsecond time counts were recorded in a data table and plotted to show the accuracy of each ultrasonic receiver. The TDoA values were then used in the multilateration calculations to determine the exact location of the UAV. The location coordinates were continuously displayed on the PC monitor as the UAV moved throughout the area.<br><br> A self-designed ultrasonic multilateration control system can detect the three-dimensional location of an indoor object to within a few centimeters. With such accuracy, a semi-autonomous UAV can be wirelessly controlled using a PC. The ultrasonic array and novel multilateration algorithm were determined to provide satisfactory navigation for an indoor UAV.

<br><br> The tragic catastrophe of tsunami in 2004 motivated me to investigate the nature of tsunami waves, and finding a solution to reduce the damages from this natural disaster. <br><br> To achieve this, a number of experiments were performed in a water tank, and the behavior of the generated tsunami wave was observed. Then by placing an underwater barrier in both shallow and deep sections of the tank, the effect of this barrier on changing the characteristics of the tsunami was studied. <br><br> The wave speeds were calculated using the high-speed video-shots taken of the generated wave during the experiments. The wave particle velocity was found using the computer programs MathPiv and Matlab. For the case of no barrier, the experimental results were in accordance with the values from the theoretical formulas. It was concluded that as the wave approaches the shore, the wave speed of tsunami decreases while its wave particle velocity increases. These observations are consistent with the theory.<br><br> In the experiments where the barrier was placed on the seabed, it was observed that the tsunami transformed into breaking waves. Analysis of the data collected from the high-speed shots showed that the wave particle velocity decreased; this observation can be attributed to the fact that the particles lose a great deal of energy due to the wave turbulence created. It is the wave particle speed that governs the destruction strength of a tsunami wave. Therefore, building a barrier is a potentially good solution for decreasing the fatal power of a tsunami.<br><br>

IMAGE PROCESSING AND COMPUTER VISION ALGORITHMS FOR SMART MOSAICING - AN APPLICATION FOR AUTOMATIC IMAGE RECOGNITION AND TRACKING
Peter Bao-Phuc Nguyen
Fort Walton Beach High School, Fort Walton Beach, Florida, U.S.A.

Images from cameras, synthetic aperture radar, and infrared sensors are processed as digital data. Current images can be used to correlate with images taken at previous times to detect changes or to determine if the images are of the same person as in the case of human image recognition. <br><br>Video taken from an airborne sensor can be used to track a moving or stationary target as in the case of missile or surveillance flying platform in the battlefield. This research focused on a way to track objects from frame to frame by way of correlating features at the frame level to facilitate this battlefield capability. An algorithm was developed to form a mosaic image from this video.<br><br>Individual frames are first extracted from the video. These images are first filtered to restore distortion caused by noise, poor resolution, and motion during imaging. Descriptors or features are then identified in each frame. Canny edge detectors and Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) were first explored to evaluate against a corner detector such as the Harris detector. The Harris detector was chosen as the filter in this research. Correlation between frames is used to track features as a function of time. A RANSAC algorithm (RANdom SAmple and Consensus) further refines the correlation between points. An affine transformation is then implemented and the images are warped accordingly. Finally, one frame is superimposed on another. This process is executed for a certain number of frames until a suitable mosaic has been created from the video.<br><br>Mosaics are found to be a robust way of tracking surface targets. Nevertheless I think that optimization in the descriptor will improve the processing time for real time application. I also believe that this algorithm can have tremendous applications such as in border patrol, airport security screening, biometric identity verification, and battlefield surveillance. <br><br>

WIRELESS POWER TRANSMISSION THROUGH ELECTROMAGNETIC RESONANCE
Chris James King
Creek Wood High - Dickson County, Charlotte, TN

The purpose of this experiment was to analyze and determine the feasibility of using a radio frequency electromagnetic field to transport electrical power using a resonant air-cored transformer and a receiver coil. A transmitter coil was constructed using a self-resonant topology to switch electrical power at a high frequency into the primary coil of a Tesla Coil. The secondary of the same Tesla Coil was magnetically coupled to the system by being placed inside the primary coil. Due to the self-oscillating nature of this completed device, the secondary coil began to emit radio frequency energy in the order of a few megahertz in frequency. A receiver coil was placed at various distances from the transmitter and the power the receiver coil was able to extract from the surrounding air was measured. All testing was conducted in a grounded Faraday cage to eliminate the risk of electromagnetic interference on nearby electrical devices. This project showed that the transmission of a usable amount of electrical power over a small distance using radio waves is possible. While the device constructed operated at a low level of power, the power level of this device could easily be increased to allow for an exponentially greater range and output power level. Possible applications of this technology include transmission of electrical energy to locations where it is typically impossible to use power lines or other physical means of transport.

GPFO: GENERAL PURPOSE FLYING OBSERVER
Wongsakorn Limsiri
Sirindhorn School , Surin , Thailand

This project is to develop a small aeroplane for general purpose aerial observation. It was designed with a hope to construct a useful and low-priced flying device helping human to survey in risky or unreachable areas. To attain such desiderata, I assembled the GPFO-subsystems from the fundamental and mass manufacturing components. <br><br> GPFO consists of a CCD camera, 1.2 GHz video transmitter, temperature and humidity sensor, a GPS receiver, 2.4 GHz RF transmitter, a microcontroller, 3 micro servo motors, a brushless DC motor with a driver and 4 channels 72 MHz RF receiver. The stationary side consists of 1.2 GHz wireless video receiver, 2.4 GHz RF receiver connected with a microcontroller, a PC and 4 channels 72 MHz RF remotecontrol. The video signal taken by CCD is sent via 1.2 GHz transmitter. Afterwards, a video to USB adapter converts the signal from 1.2 GHz receiver and then links it to PC. Meanwhile, the temperature and relative humidity were detected by SHT15 sensor, the accuracy of which is 0.3 and 2.0 respectively. To communicate with SHT15, I coded firmware and embedded it into PIC16F877 microcontroller. PIC16F877 also links with GPS module. It forms data format and sends them through 2.4 GHz RF transmitter. These data were interpreted by PC at ground station. The plane was controlled by 3 servo motors and a brushless DC motor, main engine, with a speed controlling circuit. The signals to input the motors were managed by FUTABA SKYSPORT 4 transmitter together with FUTABA R136F receiver.<br><br> GPFO has performed her operations more than 50 flights since October 2006. She did well! The range of control is about 3-5 km but there still are some limits. A distance of video and 2.4 GHz RF transmission is confined within 300 m. I will manipulate these problems in the future. If it is possible, I wish GPFO would fly by herself and make a decision with her own mind.<br><br>

AUTONOMOUS POSITIONING SYSTEM FOR A MODULATED LASER AUDIO TRANSMITTER II A SECOND YEAR STUDY
Taylor Michael Courier
Hendersonville High School, Hendersonville NC, USA

The purpose of this second year study was to create an autonomous positioning system for an improved version of last year’s modulated laser audio transmitter. This device had to be capable of aligning the transmitter with a remote receiver completely autonomously. <br><br> To achieve this goal, I first designed and constructed the transmitter. This component accepts audio input and modulates a laser beam in relation to the input. Next, I created the receiver, which utilizes a photovoltaic cell to detect the laser audio signal, demodulates it, amplifies the audio, and outputs the signal to external speakers. The most important component of the project was the positioning system. The positioning system consisted of a Parallax Basic Stamp 2 microcontroller, a servo, and a sensor system to detect when the transmitter was aligned with the receiver. The sensor system consisted of an additional laser, a retro reflector mirror, and an additional photocell to detect the reflected laser beam when the transmitter was aligned with the receiver.<br><br> Through constant experimentation and revision, I was able to design and construct a successful autonomous positioning system for a modulated laser audio transmitter.<br><br> This device provides secure audio communication over distance, which is difficult to intercept. This device could be utilized for secure military communication or a secure government communication method in times of crisis.

MEMS ACCELEROMETER POINTING DEVICE
Christopher Thomas Phare
Jefferson County International Baccalaureate School, Birmingham, Alabama, USA

The modern mouse has existed with few changes since its mass-market introduction in the 1980s. Mice are often limited to flat, clean, non-reflective surfaces and are rather ergonomically uncomfortable, restraining the user to repetitive small muscle movements and a fixed arm position. Nonetheless, existing designs to resolve these issues are typically too unfamiliar or expensive for widespread use.<br><br> As a remedy to these many problems, I proposed a pen-shaped device that repositions the computer cursor by sensing movement, even mid-air. Because a pen is a very intuitive interface, the device should be easily accepted with a short learning curve; it also allows for an ergonomically neutral hand position and can be easily transported. By using microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) accelerometers, integrated circuit-sized sensors made of micromachined silicon, the device can be small and inexpensive.<br><br> I conceptualized and designed the mechanical, electrical, and software components of the device, including a force-sensitive resistor grip, accelerometer interface, and onboard microcontroller algorithms to connect to a standard USB mouse interface. A working prototype of the device has been fabricated.

ROBOTIC FERTILIZER SYSTEM: CAN ONE BE DESIGNED FOR HOME & GARDEN USE?
Nancy Katherine (Katie) Powell
Westside High School, Macon, Georgia, USA

The purpose of my project is to construct a fertilizer spreader that will fertilize a residential lawn with minimal human labor. Building the spreader was a big job that required many calculations! Once built, I discovered that my robot would not move in first speed. Switching to second speed, I discovered that it would move towards the right, then stall after a short distance. Since the robot would not operate on the ground, I propped it up and ran my original program. The motors started and stopped as expected.<br><br>The next day, I tried the robot again and much to my surprise it actually moved, not only in second speed but also in first! Apparently it had self aligned the motors and winches where they would not bind and stall. The robot still moved right, but I believed this could be corrected by programming the slower motor to run constantly, and the faster motor to start and stop on a timed interval. This scheme worked, but switching the relays at such a fast rate would cause excessive contact wear and is not a good long term solution.<br><br>So, I tried operating one motor at one speed together with the other at another speed, and the robot began to move in a nearly straight line. I rewired the speed switch and wrote a new program. I was pleased that this final program worked; however, there was just enough error in the robots tracking that the pattern was not completely uniform.<br><br> (249 words)<br><br>

SWITCHMODE POWER SUPPLIES
Daniel Hudzik
Gymnazium Velka Okruzna, Velka Okruzna 22, 01001 Zilina, Slovakia, Europe

The main aim of the project is to introduce modern technology of switchmode power supplies and bring it's advanatges to crowds of hams.<br><br> Switchmode power supplies represent a modern high-effective alternative of linear power supplies. They're unsubstitional area is in many industrial applications like computers power supplies (AT or ATX) and many others. Manufacturers of these devices have been using them for more then ten years, but their advanteges havn't been known for hams for a long time. That was caused by absence of needed components (like switching transistors) and information about that technology. Switchmode power supplies became their unsubstitional place for their high effectivity (~ 80-90%), small physical dimensions and advanced possibilities of output parameters regulation.<br><br> Switchmode power supplies operate by rapidly switching the pass units between two efficient operating states: cutoff, where there is a high voltage across the pass unit but no current flows and saturation, where there is a high current through the pass unit but at a very small voltage drop. Essentialy, the semiconductor power switch creates an AC (alternate current) voltage from the input DC (direct current) voltage. This AC voltage can be steped up ur down by transformer and then finally filtered nack to DC at the output. Switchmode power supplies are much more efficient, about 70~90 percents. The downside of a switching design is that it is considerably more comples. In addition, the output contains swithing noise, which must be removed for many used applications.

BEAM BOTICS BICORE
Johnathon Thomas Roeder
Wishek Public School, Wishek, North Dakota, United States

My purpose for doing a project like this is; for a long time I’ve been interested in technology and the way it changes the world. I wanted to do a project like this because of the way robotics and technology intertwines. <br><br>The walkers, headbots, and many other BEAM robots run off of a circuit known as the Bicore. The Bicores are two-node circuits that toss a signal back and forth causing the servo or motor to reciprocate (move back and forth), therefore causing a walking or rotating movement. <br><br>Headbots come in a variety of complexities; they set the platform for the Bicore circuit. The headbot I constructed is among the simplest. It will continue to rotate back and forth until it finds the brightest light source to lock onto. Other types lock onto the brightest source, then shut down to conserve power.<br><br>The walkers also come in a variety of complexities. They utilize different combinations of the Bicore circuit depending on the number of servos being used. The walkers I constructed use a single Bicore for the one motor walker and the “master and slave” configuration for the two motor walkers. <br><br>My hypothesis is: <br><br>-The headbot should have been able to track and lock onto various light stimuli in complete darkness. <br><br>-The two-motor walker should have been able to move at a faster pace and overcome obstacles easier than the one-motor walker. My reasoning is that two-motor walkers have two servos, twice the power and greater agility than the one-motor walkers. <br><br>

MAGNETIC COIL GUN
Jackson Michael Beatty
Bishop Silas Chatard High School, Indianapolis, IN, United States of America

“Magnetic Coil Gun” is a project to explore the possibilities and uses of electromagnetic coil propulsion as an alternative to conventional means of propulsion. Through the construction of a working magnetic coil gun, this project shows it is in fact possible to use electromagnets as a means of propulsion and advantages of magnetized projectiles over ferrous projectiles. An originally designed and engineered gun was produced, and measures on the velocities of both projectile types were taken. A magnetic coil gun has been constructed before, but the use and benefits or magnetized projectiles has not been published. Although the possibility of a backfire arises, the magnetized projectiles of an equal mass to ferrous projectiles achieve a significantly greater velocity with the same energy usage, increasing the efficiency.<br><br> This technology could prove to have great advantages over current propulsion systems. No expanding gases, explosions, or chemical reactions are required. If all the connections are covered properly and the system is run within the limits of its parts, the system is extremely safe to operate. Any size magnetic or ferrous projectile with any mass can be propelled at any desired velocity with proper application of the technology. Relatively small batteries can power much larger systems and still have good duration life spans. Although conventional propulsion systems require refueling after each firing, this system only requires “refueling” of the batteries after many firings. The possibilities for electromagnetic propulsion are vast and expansive, needing further research and exploration.<br><br>

HYDRAULICS AND HOW THEY WORK
Jason Wayne Houle
Trenton High School, Trenton, ND USA

This experiment is designed to gain an understanding of hydraulics and how they work. It is hypothesized that the hydraulic system will move up and down, and open and close when opening and closing the valves. <br><br> A brief procedure of the experiment is as follows. First begin by cutting wood (two 2x2's) and connecting the (2x2's) with nuts and bolts. Then connect the clamp to the (2x2's). Then use (3) three foot rubber hoses and attach plastic syringes as the hydraulic hoses and valves. Put them between the joints and you should get better movement between the joints.<br><br> The result of hydraulics and how they work experiment supports the hypothesis because by making valves out of plastic syringes does make the arms move up and down, the clamp does open and close like a true hydraulic system does.

CYBERNETIC STRENGTH ENHANCING ARM
Reese Douglas Scott Black
Black Homeschool, Willison, ND, United States

The purpose of this experiment was to prove that it is possible to engineer and build a cybernetic arm to amplify the strength of its user. I first researched whether there was such system in use. I then calculated the dimensions for the arm, and the sizes of pneumatic cylinders I would need. I designed four prototypes using CAD software, implementing the calculations. After evaluating each design, I constructed an exo-skeletal arm. The arm implemented a main pneumatic cylinder, a signal cylinder, a pressure amplifier, and an electronic control valve. The signal cylinder determined the pressure the user was applying. Then, depending on that pressure (0-25psi), the pressure amplifier adjusted the supply pressure to the main cylinder accordingly. I had several subjects test the system. <br><br> Test #1: Lift an increasing amount of weight and rate the <br><br> difficulty on a scale of 1 to 10.<br><br> Test #2: Repeat test#1, this time wearing the cybernetic arm. <br><br> Test #3: Hold 5 lbs. for 3 minutes without the arm. Rate the <br><br> difficulty every 15 seconds. <br><br> Test #4: Repeat test #3, this time with the assistance of the arm. <br><br> The cybernetic arm decreased difficulty in every test. The amount of advantage increased as the weight for each test increased. This was true for both the bicep and body tests. For the 30 lb. weight test, the average advantage increased by 37%. The average increase in advantage in the endurance test was 61%. <br><br> I conclude that my hypothesis was correct. A system was successfully designed and engineered to amplify the overall strength of the user.<br><br>

SMART SWIM: A DROWNING ALERT SYSTEM
Jordan Michael Krell
Plankinton High School, Plankinton, South Dakota, United States of America

In 2003, there were 782 accidental, non-boating drowning fatalities among children ages 14 and under in the United States, according to the Center for Disease Control. There were also 4,000 near-drowning accidents among children ages 14 and under that required emergency care. Many such tragedies occur in our own backyards; some may be avoided through a new electronic device that I have created called the Smart Swim. <br><br> To determine if a young swimmer is dangerously underwater, a small radio frequency transmitter worn on the body constantly sends an “all safe” signal to a receiver located outside of the pool. When the transmitter is submerged, its radio waves are attenuated terminating the “all safe” signal thus causing the receiver to activate an alarm when a signal has not been received for a set period of time. This design makes the Smart Swim a fail-safe product. To accommodate children of varying swimming capabilities, the Smart Swim contains an ability level switch that allows for children to use the device from infancy to adolescence. Children of varying ages and swimming abilities have tested the Smart Swim in real life situations. In mass production, the Smart Swim would be an economical solution to saving the lives of children who perish as the result of drowning.<br><br>

I WANT A HOLODECK
George Francis Hotz
Bergen County Academies, Glen Rock NJ, USA

I designed and built a 360 degree viewable volumetric display. Since I first saw the hologram of Princess Leia projected by R2D2 in Star Wars, I wanted my own personal 3D display. For many years I have searched for this display. When I was 8, I bought my first laser pointer, and was very disappointed when all it made was a little dot, instead of a solid line of light. This set me back. I have experimented with photographic holography, and was unhappy with the poor results. I wanted a color 360 degree viewable 3D display. I began reexamining the idea this summer. I had a device from Disneyworld that could "write on the sky." It had several LEDs mounted on the front and by flashing these LEDs, it could write words in a curved 2D plane. I wanted to expand this to 3D. I realized if I spin a screen with a projected image, I could light any point in 3D space. So I mounted a screen and a DLP projector(to achieve high frame rates) on a spinning platform. The x and y of the projector are the r and z of cylindrical coordinates and the theta is the rotation of the screen. By changing the image as the screen rotates, I can draw any 3D object. This device has many applications from protein folding visualizations to video games. I have a full color, high resolution, 360 degree viewable, volumetric display.

At the moment the necessity to automate and to control the processes in an easy and simple way has taken me to design the control of systems by means of a computer, to be used in a friendly and easy environment of using like it is Windows, since 84% of users uses it to world level, and these programs that I have designed they are taken charge of supporting the different versions of Windows, from Windows 95 until Windows Vista. For example, we can control the whole mechanical system of diverse electronic apparatuses from a focus until a great motor triphase as well as we could mount a sophisticated alarm system among other, connected by means of the parallel port of the computer one can make possible. As well as this prototype can be created new solutions and prototypes that improve the way of living, the industry, the security, the trade, among others.<br><br> The purpose and advantage of being able to automate and to control diverse systems, are easy to make several things at the same time, more speed, more production, you don't have to worry, the system will make it for you, and all this for a company or industry represents bigger speed and revenues. As well as it can be this way useful this type of systems for hospitals, institutions, intelligent houses, textile, agro industry, among others.<br><br> Demonstrating that enunciated has developed several such projects as: Elevator, control of power, Leds panel, Pics programmer, among others.<br><br>

IT'S A WONDERFUL FLIGHT: CREATING A TOAST DELIVERY SYSTEM
Joseph Christopher Church
Alice Deal Junior High School, Washington, DC, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to create a toaster that could launch toast through the air onto a waiting plate, thus eliminating the need to pick up the hot toast. I hypothesized that if I could modify a toaster so that it could launch toast at any given angle, then I could derive an equation that would tell users at what angles the toaster can be tilted for their toast to land on their plates. <br><br> The experimental toaster is a commercial toaster beefed up with industrial strength springs and mounted on a hinged, adjustable platform. An exit velocity of over 145 inches/sec was achieved. The maximum range of the toast was close to 5 feet. I was able to derive an equation that predicted where the toast should land based on the laws of motion applicable to bodies moving in a plane subjected to the constant acceleration of gravity. An initial equation predicted the range as a function of exit velocity, launch angle, and launch height. After comparing initial equation predictions to experimental data, I wrote a final equation that accounted for drag. <br><br> The result is a toaster that can launch a piece of white sandwich bread within four inches of the desired distance with an accuracy of 83% by using an equation that I developed. Besides being a fun household appliance, the toaster could be used as a teaching tool in physics, mathematics, and engineering classrooms. <br><br>

DOES HEAT GIVEN OFF BY LIGHT BULBS INCREASE WITH TIME?
Aminda Irene- Baker Winters
Camden Central High School Camden, TN United States 

This project was based on the hypothesis that by leaving three different types of light bulbs on for an extended period of time, the amount of heat given off by the bulbs would increase as the light bulbs age. The light bulbs chosen were incandescent, fluorescent, and halogen, all compatible to 60 watts, and the time frame was for thirty-one days. A wooden unit was constructed to house and separate the bulbs and it was placed in the basement where it could be measured daily. An infrared thermometer was used to measure the temperature of the wall above the unit and the temperature of each light bulb. The temperatures were recorded on a log sheet. This data was then charted and graphed at the end of the experiment.<br><br>The results indicated that only two of the bulbs, the fluorescent and halogen, showed an increase in the amount of heat given off during the time period. The third bulb, which was the incandescent bulb, showed a decrease throughout the entire experiment. This did not fully support the hypothesis which had stated that all three bulbs would show an increase.<br><br>This experiment supports the research about the inefficiency of incandescent bulbs as it relates to energy consumption compared to the other bulbs. The incandescent seemed to lose the most heat energy in the shortest time.

PROPELLER DESIGN IN APPLICATION OF A HUMAN-POWERED SUBMARINE
Christopher John Sarabalis
F. W. Springstead High School, Spring Hill, Florida

The goal of this project is to design a propeller to use during a 100m human-powered submarine race. All variables of the propeller are defined using a 420 RPM limit and an expected top-speed of 7 knots. The variables needed to be defined require hydrofoil information with uncommon Reynolds numbers and therefore an apparatus is being constructed to obtain this information.<br><br>Mathematics and physics were the fundamental tools in designing the propeller to this point. Using trigonometry and physics, I was able to define the pitch and analyze the relationship between speed and the efficient radius of the propeller. I also calculated the velocity of each point across the propeller in preperation for drag and thrust calculation.<br><br>Hydrofoil information was needed at this point to continue thrust and drag calculation and research did not suffice, therefore an apparatus is being constructed to test hydrofoils under controlled Reynolds numbers. The current apparatus design is a circulating tank with flow controlled by a network of tubes used to generate a laminar flow. Manometers will be created for flow measurement.<br><br>At present this project has assembled the foundation for hydrofoil research and established a method for designing the propeller. A test propeller has been crafted and tested on the submarine. An apparatus has been designed and is being constructed that will allow further research development.

RCISS - REMOTE COMPUTER INTERFACE AND SECURITY SYSTEM
Andrew John Nowell
Nottingham High School, Nottingham Nottinghamshire, England

Existing portable computing devices are not very powerful and are expensive. RCISS solves this problem by providing desktop computing power from a small lightweight handheld device (the Handheld) that is relatively cheap to construct.<br><br> The RCISS system consists of the Handheld which has a screen and operating controls and a desktop computer (or laptop) modified with a special hardware card or external USB device. The video output from the computer which would normally appear on the computer’s monitor is transmitted wirelessly to and displayed on the Handheld’s screen. Using the Handheld’s operating controls which compromise a joystick and left/right click buttons, signals can be sent wirelessly back to the computer to control the mouse cursor of the computer’s operating system. In this way the Handheld functions as a dummy terminal for control of the computer and delivers all of the power of a normal desktop computer without needing its own motherboard, hard drive and memory. When the Handheld is not connected, the computer can be used as normal.<br><br> Using additional cards, emulation software and additional multimedia hardware multiple Handhelds can be connected to the computer each controlling an emulated virtual operating system. This would allow more than one person to share the computing power of the main computer. The handheld could also be developed to include a keyboard in a laptop style device. <br><br> Other applications of the system are in multimedia delivery, home automation and security and I have built and modified a doll’s house to demonstrate these uses.<br><br>

THE SMART TRAILER
Mackenzie F.A. Melby
Watford City Home School, Watford City, ND USA

The Smart Trailer is an anti-jackknifing apparatus that may be equipped on a conventional trailer. It features a power-steering rack, controlled by a system that selectively provides wheel correction when sensing the hitch angle of the trailer. The system serves two purposes:<br><br>1) It will prevent dangerous swerving during regular highway travel.<br><br>2) It enables drivers to back up single or double trailers without jackknifing.<br><br> Two model trailers have been constructed to demonstrate how the system operates. The models show that the Smart Trailer makes the correct adjustments to prevent jackknifing and swerving. It also shows the potential for a great market asset, lending safety and precision to the truck driving business.

TUG
David Charles Griffiths Badger
Birkdale School, Sheffield, England

Tug is a device that enables a single user to manoeuvre any type or size trailer or caravan. Tug works by using a system of gears to give the user the mechanical advantage that enables them to move such a large object. Tug is collapsable and portable, able to fit in to any car boot or luggage space. Tug has the versatility to be used in applications from launching boat and jet ski trailers out to sea, avoiding the risk of any damage to the users vehicle, to parking large trailers in to tight spots. This makes the potential target market for the device huge everywhere in the world no matter what the intended use. The project is of a simple design and construction allowing maximum performance with the least amount of costs in the production stage and also the retail price is reduced broadening the target market. No trailer or caravan is too big or too small to be used with Tug as the principals remain the same on all shapes and sizes.

INVESTIGATION OF THE MECHANICS AND OPTIMIZATION OF A PLANAR VALVELESS PIEZOELECTRIC VR PUMP
Yichi Zhang
Dunlap High School, Dunlap IL, United States

<br><br> This project investigates how the Viscous Restrictor (VR), a novel flow control device used in a valveless piezoelectric (PZT) micropump developed in a previous project, generates different flow patterns in forward and backward flow, and how the different VR parameters affect pump performance by means of experiment and simulation.<br><br> <br><br> A planar PZT VR pump, a pressure control system for pump flow measurement, and simulation models have been successfully developed. The results from the simulations and the experiments display consistency and correlation. The simulation data show that different flow patterns are due to the VR geometry guiding the flow in the forward direction and blocking the flow in the backward direction. The pump performance (net flow rate) depends on the flow difference created by the VR. A coefficient for the evaluation of pump performance, net flow coefficient, is defined. Changes in VR parameters, including edge angle, distance between VR edges, number of VR edges, and single-side and double-side VRs, alter the guiding and blocking effects of the VR on the flow and thus generate different flow rates. The optimum design is to maximize the difference between the forward and backward direction.<br><br> <br><br> The prototype pump and pressure control system are fully functional. Based on the VR mechanics, the optimum settings for the VR are as follows: double-side VR, 20 degree edge angle, 8 edges per VR, and a distance of 1.25 mm. The net flow coefficient at 400 Pa pressure differential is 0.09.<br><br>

HOW SKIRT LENGTH AND SURFACE DENSITY AFFECT HOVERCRAFT FLIGHT
Ryan Kari Sandvik
Mohawk Trail Regional High School, Shelburne Falls, MA USA

A hovercraft is an amphibious vehicle that is supported by a cushion of air. Through this project, it was hoped that more would be learned about how hovercrafts work, and educational as well as inspirational conclusions would be displayed. The building of the hovercraft was a success, much was learned. The construction was more complicated than expected. Several predictions were made, some right and some wrong as confirmed below.<br><br> Hypothesis I: Predictions were made that the hovercraft would fly better on hard, smooth surfaces, because air that escaped from under the skirt would create pressure to lift the craft more effectively. This hypothesis was confirmed when field tested, since it flew better over cement than snow or gravel. <br><br> Hypothesis II: Another prediction was that the weight of the skirt would affect the lift. During experimentation, the weight of the skirt was changed by replacing the heavy, Cordora nylon skirt with a lightweight waterproof nylon skirt. The lightweight, waterproof nylon resulted in greater inflation and lift than heavy Cordora nylon. <br><br> Hypothesis III: It was thought that a longer skirt would better hold the pressure. When the skirt was shortened from 13 inches to 9.5 inches, this hypothesis was proven incorrect. The shorter skirt resulted in greater lift than the longer one.<br><br> If this project were attempted again it would be commence earlier, and help would be sought from an experienced mentor. The hovercraft would be tested in different atmospheric settings, and more research would be conducted on surface conditions. <br><br>

When beginning the year 2006 we went thought and interviewed factories and companies from PaysandÃº city. That are dedicated to the elaboration of hygiene products , among them the pills to kill mosquitoes. <br><br>We observed that the process used by one of these companies was very slow and precarious since it is very expensive and of low capacity. We decided to elaborate a machine able to cut and to dose pills for mosquitoes, in such way that speeds up the process and diminish the costs of production. The cutting and dosage machine of pills for mosquitoes consists on cutting the flat sheet of the appropriate material. The flat sheet is placed on the conveying belt by the dispenser of platelets that is the in standing charge one of providing the conveying belt. In this, there are several loading trays in such a way that the flat sheet material is placed exactly among them to be cut by the press mold. The cutter is commanded by a pneumatic cylinder, cutting the material giving a geometric shape pills (20 mm for 30 mm) and at the same time it doses them through several conduits that lower from a deposit. <br><br> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF WATER/CEMENT RATIO ON THE STRENGTH OF CONCRETE?
Norrisa Yvonne Williams, Courtney Grant
Dutchtown High School, Hampton, Georgia, United States of America

The basis of our research was to determine the effect that a change in the amount of water in the water/ cement ratio will have on the strength of concrete, by recording the various strengths of each sample at different levels of compressive strength. It is acknowledged that concrete will be stronger when less water is present; however, what is being examined here is the effect that the varying water amounts have on the concrete and when too much water is being used creating unstable and ineffective concrete. The procedure of this experiment was conducted in the following manner: First the materials for the concrete was mixed together in order to create the concrete in three to four different tubs that were mixed to form a paste. The paste sat overnight in cylinder containers to harden. After the cylinders remained for a week, two of the cylinders were crushed and the strength of them measured according to their concrete compressive strength. Four more cylinders were crushed after 21 days had passed from the original starting date. Following a 28 day period, the final cylinders were crushed and the concretes strength measured according to its concrete compressive strength, which was measured in pound-force per square inch. The experiment proved that when the water is increased in the production of concrete the strength becomes weaker. At a certain point the concrete can become unsafe for motor vehicles and building constructions.<br><br>

ICE COLD: ALTERNATIVES TO COOLING COMPUTERS
Brendan Wesley Jones, Robert Lloyd Mussler
Nederland Middle/Senior High School. Nederland, Colorado. USA

The rational for this experiment was to test whether a computer could be effectively cooled with a passive cooling apparatus. The procedures consisted of constructing the cooling system with copper tubing and a copper block, and constructing an artificial CPU heat source using resistors. The cooling system was then tested for cooling efficiency using the artificial heat source. This was followed by application within a designated experimental computer. Over multiple trials, the results indicated a slight cooling trend but were largely inconclusive. While the computer managed to stay cool for upwards of nine minutes, it eventually succumbed to heat and auto shut down. Our choice of materials contributed largely to these results as copper may not be the best choice. If this experiment were to be expounded upon, a new material and possibly new coiling design would be paramount in achieving success. Implications for this type of technology would be most evident in portable devices; a laptop equipped with the cooler could sustain a much longer battery life because of the power available that was previously needed to run the fans. Along with that desktop computers would need less power to run fans and could potentially reduce a household’s power consumption. While technology today is still largely cooled by fans and air currents, in the future we could see everything passively cooled and computers maintaining a much higher electric efficiency.<br><br>

THE COMBINATION OF ELECTROMAGNETS AND POSITION-CONTROLLING CIRCUITS TO CREATE A MAGLEV, AND THEIR PRACTICALITY IN EVERYDAY USE
Mark Greggory Mathews, Joshua Elliot Braband
Glencoe-Silver Lake High School, Glencoe, MN, United States

Maglevs use the attractive and repelling forces of magnets to levitate them above or below a rail. For the train to levitate, it must use sensors to keep it a distance of less than 1 cm from the rail.<br><br> This experiment attempted to re-create the basic system of sensors and magnets to keep a train levitated, and to see if it could be tested on a small scale.<br><br> The experiment first involved building a circuit that would emit a signal, receive the signal, adjust power accordingly to an electromagnet, and then repeat the process many times each second. The second part of the experiment involved building the actual test vehicle out of aluminum, along with two electromagnets.<br><br> When the vehicle was tested, it attempted to levitate on its own (at a distance of less than 1 mm), but the magnets were not strong enough, and so it was not able to completely support itself. If the vehicle had a more powerful magnet, which we were not able to build (this one was only drawing 1.75 amps), or if there was a circuit that would handle more amperage, then the vehicle would be able to completely support itself.<br><br> The purpose of this experiment was partially met, as we proved that a maglev can be successfully tested on a small scale. <br><br> Because of our findings, we proved that maglevs can be used practically in small uses, such as conveyors in factories or warehouses.<br><br>

In Brazil and in other developing countries where the Human Development Index is low and the average family income is US$ 350.00 there is a considerable number of people with physical disabilities and there is also the need for a low cost and easy to adapt equipment that allows these people to enter buildings and houses with more than one floor, leading these people to look only for one floor houses or first floor apartments. Taking this justification into account, is it possible to create a low cost and easy to adapt equipment similar to those already existing in the market that allows people to go from one floor to the other without the need of physical efforts? The established aim is to present a prototype of a low cost and easy to adapt equipment that allows the locomotion of people who find it difficult to go up and down stairs in small apartment buildings and more than one floor houses, improving their life quality and providing them with social insertion and equality.<br><br> This project’s execution consists of bibliographical research and the presentation of a prototype, in which we consider fundamental concepts of elevator functioning, transmission systems, ergonomics and social insertion.<br><br> After studies and tests with the prototype it is easy to see that it is possible to help people with physical disabilities trough EPA – Alternative Popular Elevator which can be built with one third of market costs and can be easily adapted to houses’ and buildings’ already existing structures.<br><br>

FLUOROTYPE: A SYSTEM TO TRANSCODE INFO EMBEDDED IN UV-REACTIVE DATA MATRICES
Brandon Lee Reavis, Brian Christopher Reavis
Cody High School, Cody, WY, USA

Over time, technologies have added convenience to conventional ways of accessing information (i.e. the internet, television with interactive interfaces, etc), but one form of information has remained very static and archaic. Our project intends to bridge the gap between current technology and printed text. We are developing a system where information and data can be unobtrusively stored for each word of a printed page. It will be stored in the form of an invisible data matrix that will fluoresce when subjected to a brief pulse of ultraviolet light centered at 360nm. These matrices will be generated with custom software developed in C#. A major component of the project will be to develop a mobile electronic device that will illuminate, decode, and display the data. <br><br>These matrices could store numerous types of information such as definitions of words, pronunciations, and URLs. This system will be beneficial to both security and educational fields. It could be developed to only permit devices with a certain security key to access data that is encrypted in the matrices. It could also assist the reading of books which have these UV reactive data matrices embedded in them. The device is being developed to have a minimal learning curve, so that people of all ages and degrees of technical inclination can use it easily. <br><br>

INCREASED PRECISION, VERSATILITY AND CONTROL IN LASER-BASED SURGERIES THROUGH THE INTERSECTION OF SUPERIMPOSED VARIED FREQUENCY LASERS
William Decker Neiswanger, Fei Chen
School of Science and Technology, Beaverton Oregon, United States of America

The aim of our project was to develop a novel technique to increase the precision of various laser cutting applications, such as laser surgery, by providing better depth control. Despite the many advanced technologies employed in laser surgery today, there still remains a high rate of complication after surgery due to indiscriminate cutting. Our project design employs the superposition of two similar-frequency lasers to create a beam with periods of constructive and destructive interference; the areas of constructive interference can be viewed as pulses traveling down the beam. These pulses are then ‘split’ and intersected at a perpendicular angle. Due to the geometry of the intersection, the pulses form a plane of doubled intensity in the shape of a disc. We have shown that this disc forms a spatially anchored region of high intensity within the intersection area of the beams. Furthermore, we were able to manipulate the disc simply by moving the point of intersection, and we have demonstrated that the dimensions of the disc can be easily controlled by manipulating the various parameters of the system. The significance of our project lies within the controllability offered by these initial parameters: intersection angle, laser frequency, and phase. Through this technique, we are able to create an easily positioned, dimensionally controlled disc which could provide approaches to a variety of cutting applications. In laser surgery, this technique could potentially let us tailor the disc to cut specific volumes of unhealthy tissue within the body, and might help decrease the risk of surgical complications.

INCREASED PRECISION, VERSATILITY AND CONTROL IN LASER-BASED SURGERIES THROUGH THE SUPERPOSITION OF SUPERIMPOSED VARIED FREQUENCY LASERS
Fei Chen, Willie Neiswanger
School of Science and Technology, Beaverton OR, USA

In current laser surgery, lack of precision causes problems such as scar tissue, procedural failure, and damage of healthy tissue. The reason for these problems lies inherently in the fact that laser beams cut a cylinder. When these “cutting cylinders” are placed in a body (to be used in cancer surgery) or in an eye (to be used in laser eye surgery), they can often cause excess damage to tissue and certain extra procedural methods need to be used. For example, in cancer surgery, healthy tissue before, past, and to either side of the tumor is often damaged. In laser eye surgery, the eye needs to be partially sliced and flapped open before cutting with a laser can begin (in order to only cut a specific point in the eye).<br><br>Our project aims to help fix this problem by creating a new technique in laser surgery which only allows a specific section along the laser beam to have the intensity to cut. If a laser can be thought of as a “cutting cylinder” then, in our project, we created a cutting “slice” (of the cylinder). In order to do this, we began by superimposing two lasers. When two lasers of slightly varying frequencies were superposed upon one another, they created a “beat,” which transitioned between constructive interference and destructive interference. This beat was utilized like a pulsed laser for our purposes. When this superimposed “beat” beam was split and then intersected, the pulses overlapped to form a high-intensity “slice” which could be utilized like a section of a cylinder. When only a specific section of the cylinder has the ability to make an incision, instead of the entire cylinder, more precise and versatile surgeries can be attained.

MICROFLUIDIC MIXING BY SEGMENTED FLOW
David Chang, Lukasz Mosakowski
Manhasset High School, Manhasset, New York, 11030, United States

The microfluidic device market is growing annually at a rate of 15.5% to an estimated $1.95 billion in 2008 due to their ability to reproduce laboratory tests in settings thousands of times smaller with accuracy up to a million times greater. Mixing is very difficult at the microscale due to extremely low Reynolds numbers. A proposed method for rapid mixing in microchannels is segmentation which separates mixing reagents into circulating droplets by means of an immiscible carrier fluid. Tice (03) demonstrated that mixing by segmentation is sensitive to the initial distribution of reagents. The purpose of this study was to create a rapid mixing regime by segmentation in comparison to diffusive mixing to demonstrate an applicable blood analysis system. In the experimental phase, flow was driven by pressure into a PDMS microfluidic chip. Nine flow rates were observed for diffusion and five water fractions were observed for segmentation. Mixing was quantified using normalized grey scale intensity. A One-Way ANOVA was performed for each flow type. Multiphase and non-multiphase computation were performed as well. Full mixing was not achieved by diffusion within the channel; however, the highest and lowest flow rates demonstrated the most diffusive mixing due to, respectively, chaotic advection and low fluid velocity. For segmentation, full mixing was obtained at all flow fractions. At lower flow fractions at which segmentation could still occur, mixing was most efficient. Mixing by segmentation was approximately fifty times faster than diffusive mixing. These conclusions were supported by CFD modeling using Fluent software.

THE UNO: TOMORROW'S TRANSPORTATION SOLUTION
Benjamin Poss Gulak, Jason Morrow
Chisholm Collegiate, Oakville, Ontario, Canada

During the industrial revolution, combustion engines revolutionized the way humans worked, traveled and globalize world markets. As fossil fueled vehicle numbers increased, so did their environmental impact on global warming. The question remains since the day of conception: how does one create a cost effective, environmentally friendly mode of transportation? One large contributor to smog is personal commuting vehicles, particularly in dense cities. This project aims to provide a solution to urban transportation by designing an efficient personal transportation vehicle (PTV) capable of traveling 40 miles at speeds up to 45 mph using clean renewable electro-motive power. Our PTV vehicle, called The Uno, was designed in three modules: mechanical, electrical and software. A mechanical design was developed using three dimensional cad packages to create a compact wheeled PTV. This allows excellent vehicle directional control and provides dual electro-motive sources of power. The electrical design encompassed vehicle power delivery, electrical power storage, regenerative breaking, and positional control using accelerometer feedback. Software was designed to interface microprocessors to control vehicle speed, direction, position control and power management to guide the vehicle by human intuitive movements. Current advances in NiMh battery sources provide high density energy sources that can be charged from existing electricity grids, thus using clean renewable energy sources. Our full scaled working model demonstrates how innovative use of current technology can provide urban environments with a cost effective, compact and environmentally friendly means of transportation.

This project is to design and develop the water sample collecting robot that can move on the water surface and collect the water. Currently, the water collecting method can be operated by using the equipment called Water sampler. However, this equipment still needs human to carry on the boat during this sampling operation. Therefore, this method may not be suitable to work for any conditions such as small area, risking area, and polluting environment.<br><br> The designed robot is shape-like boat with four pontoons and two wheels for driving on the water surface. Microcontroller (MSC51) was used to operate this water sample collecting robot. The microcontroller can communicate to computer via the RS232-wireless. In the mechanical system, sheave and encoder were used in order to convey water sampler into the water. The depth of water sampler can be computed from the received data obtained from the encoder. The position and direction of robot can be controlled manually by user. The movement direction of robot can be controlled with computer keyboard. For the conveying and collecting system, the robot can automatically work according to the required depth of water.<br><br>

Sarvesh Sudhir Nevatia, Rehan Hoshang Netarwala
Jai Hind College, Mumbai, Maharashtra, INDIA

The multidirectional movement of a vehicle today stands restricted due to the usage of cylindrical wheels. This project deals with the development of an omnidirectional vehicle that uses spherical wheels to overcome this problem. A prototype has been successfully fabricated and tested. <br><br><br><br>The prototype works on the principle of a computer mouse.It comprises four rubber spheres, each held in place by three rollers. Two rollers placed at 90° to each other are powered by motors and produce motion along the X and Y axes. These motors, when run simultaneously, produce motion between the axes. The third roller at 135° to each of the other rollers, supports the sphere. Friction between rollers and spheres moves the spheres. A braking system together with an electronic system helps in the precise movement of the vehicle. The electronic system contains two bi-directional motor circuits and a set of 6 relays that allow speed variation of all motors.<br><br><br><br>On display is the 4th prototype made after various tests and design changes to the previous prototypes. By conducting tests on load capacity, power, speed and slippage, important conclusions have been drawn. Operating on 12 volt DC motors, the prototype attains a maximum speed of 6cm/s and has a maximum load capacity of 15 kg at 13.6W. Due to lack of sufficient friction, the vehicle is only 70% efficient.<br><br><br><br>This concept can be applied in numerous fields. It can be used on wheel chairs, luggage trolleys, forklifts, robot mounts and small vehicles in an industrial environment.<br><br>

STIRLING ENGINE STACKS
Daniel Clemens Posch, Thomas McEvoy
Waterford School, Sandy, UT, USA

Our project is designed to test an efficiency-enhancing innovation regarding Stirling engines. These are external heat engines, meaning that they produce mechanical power by transferring thermal energy from a heat source to a heat sink (cooler). Our project tests the possibilty of enhancing its net efficiency by running a second Stirling engine using the waste heat produced by the first. That is, the thermal energy which is neither converted to mechanical energy nor lost as entropy, but transferred directly from the hot to the cold side of the engine.<br><br>Our hypothesis is that it is possible to increase net efficiency in Stirling engines by doing this.<br><br>To test this, we have designed and built a working model Stirling engine. Our experiments:<br><br> - Measure the heat output of the engine on its cold side, by measuring the change in temperature of a known volume of cooling water.<br><br> - Analyze the engine's thermodynamic cycle over various heat gradients by measuring the real-time pressure of the gas inside the engine and the rotational position of the crankshaft, from which we inferred the real-time volume of the gas in the engine. This allowed us to created a Pressure-Volume diagram illustrating the engine's cycle and its inefficiencies. These are what lead to the waste heat that could be recovered by further engines.<br><br>Our experiments have shown that efficiency and power increases can, indeed, be obtained by recovering some of a Stirling engine's heat losses with an additional Stirling engine.

During research for our project we found a robot being developed named Asimo, created by Honda. The manufacturing cost of Honda’s robot was over one million dollars. We needed to understand the essential attributes of Asimo so they could be simplified to create a basic bipedal robot that still had fundamental navigation sensors. This needed to be inexpensive enough where there the average consumer could afford them, and yet still have other uses such as saving a human life by substituting for people in dangerous environments.<br><br> We attempted to develop an affordable, cost efficient biped apparatus that is capable of carrying out the basic necessities of today's entertainment/service automatons (waiters, maids, butlers, and possibly a robotic football team). Plans and blueprints to scale were drawn. Throughout the construction we found many mechanical and electrical flaws in our plans. These oversights not only delayed our schedule but also discouraged us. Our construction methods adapted as we changed theories of keeping a sound structure while still maintaining the flexibility of a human. Components such as sensors were added to the complexity of the project. Currently we have our robot taking a steady step forward while keeping a straight center of gravity. More programming will be needed to include input from sonar, balance, and touch sensors. The total manufacturing cost of our robot would be approximately $3,600. While we did considerably cut the features of Asimo, we developed an operational bipedal robot, which still has practical uses in everyday society. <br><br>

Centennial Regional High School, Greenfield Park, Quebec, Canada

The purpose of this project was to create the prototype of a robot that would prevent train accidents. The unit would travel ahead of a train, and send data back to the conductor regarding potential dangers at level crossings and on the track.<br><br>The first step was to design The PECA Forerunner and choose its sensors. Next, the body of the robot was cut out of Plexiglas, and screwed together with wooden corner blocks. A simple circuit was built to run the two motors, and the headlights. Touch sensors, a heat sensor, and a mercury switch were set up so that they let the electricity jump the motor when triggered, stopping the robot. Additional sensors were set up in a parallel circuit with a red warning light and a buzzer. The light and buzzer were placed in a control box outside the robot. This control box simulates the controls that the conductor would have over the robot, including the on/off switch for the motors and a yellow warning light. Infrared sensors were installed, which activate this yellow warning light. One webcam was added to scan the tracks ahead of the robot, and another was added to scan the tracks behind it. The average braking distances of certain trains were calculated to determine how far ahead of the train the robot would be need placed.<br><br>The main functions of The PECA Forerunner’s prototype were verified by placing it on a short, makeshift length of track, and having it detect an obstruction.<br><br>

An energy transforming device is designed to produce and store electrical energy capable of running an appliance during daylight time and some time after. The device is composed of a wooden box, a solar cell, a battery and a power inverter. The device proved to be affordable, portable, pollution free, silent and secure. The device functions in the following way: a solar cell collects and transforms sunlight into electrical energy, stores it in a 12 volts battery and sends it to a power inverter which converts the energy from 12 volts to 110 volts. Square pieces of different sizes are cut each time from the center of the cardboard, in order to make a square hole to let the sunlight come in through a controlled area. The exposed areas are 4, 16, 36 and 64 square inches.<br><br> The cardboards with different exposed areas are placed over the solar cell. The voltmeter measured the volts that were produced in each case. <br><br> Different 110 volts appliances were plugged into the power inverter socket and began to work satisfactorily.<br><br> The data collected and analyzed through tables and graphs gave evidence that the most effective size of the solar cell was 16 square inches instead of the four square inches one. This device is very useful to operate electrical appliances during outdoor activities.<br><br>

IMPROVING THE DISTILLATION EFFICIENCY OF DIHYDROGEN MONOXIDE
Joe Ritt, Naomi E. May
James Campbell High School, Ewa Beach, HI USA

This experiment was designed to improve the efficiency of a solar still, while keeping it as simple and cost-effective as possible. The goal was to use as few materials while achieving as high efficiency as attainable; thereby expanding the benefits of this project to anyone where a still can be used. This was deliberated after witnessing the cataclysmic events of Hurricane Katrina; a lot of dirty water, many people, and no way to clean the water. <br><br> After conducting a control test to verify the maximum amount of water the still could produce, manipulating the variables to obtain the highest efficiency took place. The rounds of timed cool-downs involved placing a wet towel over the glass condenser plate, then removing the towel after a set time. The “cool-downs” were then conducted at even intervals from two to 12 times per five hours. Then another round was administered with 10 minute intervals, and finally one more round with 15 minute intervals. <br><br> After compiling the results, the best combination was obtained when the condenser was cooled for 15 minutes six times per day (within the final five hours). After obtaining an initial efficiency of 25%, the efficiency rose to the 60th percentile in terms of liters-input to liters-output. Five grams of salt were added to the water in the still. The water produced was not salty. The contributions of this project are apparent in its simplicity, effectiveness, and versatility. It demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of stills and their valid application in emergencies. <br><br>

DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, AND TESTING OF ELECTROSTATIC LOUDSPEAKERS
Jan Ohmstedt, Angsuman Roy 
Palo Verde High School, Las Vegas, NV USA 

Traditionally, loudspeakers use an inductive coil, suspended in a magnetic field gap usually attached to a cone to create sound. However, alternative technologies exist most notably electrostatic loudspeakers. These loudspeakers operate with a high voltage DC bias applied to a lightweight diaphragm, usually, Mylar. This is suspended between two stators, which modulate the diaphragm with an audio signal. These speakers are excited over their entire surface and behave in a linear source fashion rather than a conventional point source. This project aimed to find the technical merits and disadvantages of electrostatic loudspeakers and analysis of acoustics regarding linear sources in comparison to conventional loudspeakers. Tests done to compare the loudspeakers include frequency response, directivity, cumulative spectral decay, and impulse response. <br><br>Furthermore, a stereo pair of electrostatic loudspeakers were constructed to learn about the engineering challenges involved in designing such a loudspeaker and to get a better understanding of these types of speakers. The speakers are constructed primarily from wood and metal rods and are powered by amplifiers driving a step-up transformer. After successful design and construction of these electrostatic loudspeakers, they were compared to a pair of conventional loudspeakers, similar in class, a 3-way loudspeaker costing approximately $800. Once tests were completed, it was found that electrostatic loudspeakers could be superior in terms of step response. In addition, frequency response turned out to be an arbitrary measure of performance. Electrostatic loudspeakers had far worse directivity than conventional loudspeakers as a result of dipolar radiation of sound. Furthermore, practical issues remained a concern and a subjective evaluation, though not completely decisive leaned towards the merits of the electrostatic loudspeaker.<br><br>

COMPARISON OF MULTIDIGITAL ARTICULATED ROBOTIC MANIPULATING APPARATI
Alexander Hiroshi Nicholas, Tim Beers, Trevor Hoo
Hanalani Schools, Mililani, HI, USA

The project is mainly about designing different constructed claws with plastic building blocks, and to test each to see which holds a set amount of items the longest. Another problem was if the claw is constructed with more leverage it would be more effective than the other claws. Then started out to test each and constantly trying to modify the design, such as attaching a universal joint to each so that the claw grabs objects just with a flip of a switch. We began to analyze and conduct the necessary experiments to see what claw was the most effective to hold the object the longest. Their were a set number of objects to assign for testing for each of the claws, including to see if the claw would grapple on to the object on the first try. Each was given three tries, and was based on time with the increments of seconds. Ten seconds is the maximum time for each try. The outcome resulted as the claw with the claw with more leverage and sturdy design (claw #3)has withheld most of the objects the longest. This is significant as to show that the design of claws is crucial because if there is one mistake the outcome will be disastrous such as an assembly line of robotic claws.

SHOCKING SCIENCE
Blake Michael Louque
St. James Parish Science and Math Academy, Vacherie, LA

I don't know about you, but I am a big fan of television. One of my favorite shows is called "Mythbusters" and is on the Discovery Channel. One of the experiements that they had was building a seven-foot tall Van de Graaff generator and testing it on themselves to see the effects of it. I built a VDG for myself. I tested it on a volt meter to determine how I can get the best "bolt for my buck." I wanted to know if changing the belt dimensions has a positive, negative, or neutral effect on the total voltage output of the generator. Once the VDG was built, I put it through a series of tests to determine the average voltage that it puts out. Once I had that determined, I moved on to changing specific designs on/about the machine and measured the resulting affect that it had on the voltage output. Using a volt meter, I determined if any or all of the changes that I make to the VDG affected the voltage output. I charted my results specifying each change and the amount of voltage achieved from that change.<br><br>I think that leaving the VDG as described in the directions will yield the highest possible voltage for my generator.

SHOES THAT GENERATE ELECTRICITY
Andrew David Daw
Mazama High School, Klamath Falls, OR

The purpose of this project was to determine if an electrical generator that could be fitted to a shoe, could harness enough energy by walking or running to charge a small battery.<br><br> After researching many generator ideas, multiple direct magnetic induction generators were built. Each generator is composed of a tube, coils of coated wire, and a magnet. This generator system appealed because of its simplicity, durability, and ergonomics.<br><br>Three different variables were independently changed; wire gauge, wire length, and magnet strength. Emerging patterns revealed how to make the generators more powerful.<br><br> The maximum voltage and current from the generators was measured with a digital multimeter. The power output was calculated for each generator based on the current and voltage (P=I x V). The generator with the maximum power output produced more than 400 mW, but under realistic conditions it may yield a fraction of this amount. Estimations suggest that jogging can produce enough power to maintain the battery level of Ipods or other low power devices.<br><br> In order for these generators to be practical as battery chargers, they would have to charge a cell phone battery in less than 8 hours. This would require a constant generator output of more than 400 mW, more than I could realistically expect with my generator. Therefore, multiple generators or different systems such as piezoelectric or a mechanical drive with a flywheel and generator, may be needed in order to obtain a practical charge time.<br><br>

PROPELLER DESIGN THROUGH CASE STUDY OF A HUMAN-POWERED SUBMARINE
Christopher John Sarabalis
F.W. Springstead High School, Spring Hill, FL

In search of a pragmatic algorithm for propeller design and in hopes of exceeding the speed record for single-person, propeller-driven submarines, this study is comprised of theoretical analysis of blade mechanics and the application of this knowledge to the human-powered submarine system.<br><br> <br><br> By analyzing the logic and mechanics of propellers, shape and angle design methods are left to be tested for efficiency. This can be done once accurate drag measurements on the submarine are completed. Two attempts for drag measurements were made by attaching the submarine to a spring scale and towing it behind a boat.<br><br> <br><br> The first attempt ended in failure when the scale broke and dropped into the water. The drag was measured as 130 newtons at a speed of 2.06 meters per second. The second attempt was hardly more successful as more problems began to unfold. The stream tube from the boat's propeller affected the test and an angle in the rope caused the sub to move irregularly, as well as tilt. The drag measurements for this test at a speed of 2.06 meters per second were 110 Newtons.<br><br> <br><br> Although drag tests were quite unsuccessful, excellent construction methods for both rapid prototyping (wooden) and accurate finished products (aluminum) were designed and tested. Finished products have a high-level of malleability and can be altered to correct angles.<br><br> <br><br> Overall, if the current drag tests are correct, it will take 1.47 kilowatts (1.97 HP) of power to ahieve 3.6 meters per second. More accurate and controlled drag tests are hypothesized to yield lower data, confirming the feasibility of success and enabling further research.

EVERGREEN FIRE ALARM AND SUPPRESSION SYSTEM
Matthew Taylor Stegall
HBS Academy, Charlotte, NC

Christmas time is a season for celebration, decoration and good cheer. One of the most popular traditions is the beautifully lighted Christmas tree. More than 33 million American homes include a natural tree in their yuletide traditions and festivities. Historically, small candles were used to decorate trees but, since 1882, electric lights usually brightly adorn the branches. Holiday revelers often do not realize the danger that lurks during this most joyous time. Christmas tree fires pose a major threat to family safety and property. Over 400 fires occur each year. The purpose of this engineering project was to design, build and develop a fire alarm and suppression system to detect, alarm, and extinguish a Christmas tree fire to prevent injury, loss of life and property. The Evergreen Fire Alarm and Suppression System (EFASS) was designed and constructed using common materials and modified after testing to meet the design goals. The Evergreen Fire Alarm and Suppression System performance was evaluated by meeting its design goals. In this project, the researcher observed that the EFASS worked and met overall design goals but required several modifications. The hypothesis was proven correct through experimentation. The EFASS did detect, alarm, and extinguish a Christmas tree fire. With repeated testing, redesign and modifications, the EFASS improved and currently is fully functional and more efficient. With further development, the EFASS has real world applications for improving safety and preventing injury, loss of life and property.

REDUCING LAWNMOWER EMISSIONS USING E-85, PHASE THREE: A CATALYST FOR CHANGE
Kate Elizabeth Weegman
Winona Senior High School, Winona, MN

In 2000, there were 97 million lawnmowers in the United States. In 2002, 146 million people were exposed to unhealthy air due to high levels of pollutants, which include hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen oxides (NOX), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide. Although there are about 10.5 million alternative fuel (primarily E-85) vehicles on U.S roads, this abundant resource (E-85) has not yet been used in small gas engines (lawnmowers). The purpose of this project was to further reduce lawnmower emissions in a cost-efficient manner. It was hypothesized that the use of E-85 and a catalytic converter would reduce carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and oxides of nitrogen emissions. Exhaust emissions could be further reduced by advancing the ignition timing. It was hypothesized there would be noticeable corrosion on internal engine surfaces. Two new Briggs and Stratton 6.5 hp OVH small engines were acquired. Housing for the catalyst was designed and fabricated to complete the catalytic converter. The dynamometer and exhaust gas analyzer were connected to the engine and CO2, CO, HC, NOX emissions were measured. 500 trials were conducted with regular fuel and E-85. An ignition advancement system was fabricated and another 500 trials were conducted. CO and CO2 emissions were reduced with E-85. A further reduction of CO, CO2, HC, and NOX took place with the advance ignition timing (p <0.0001). There was no visible corrosion on engine parts. There is little reason why E-85 could not be used in small engines (with minor modifications) to reduce exhaust emissions.

A SOLAR SYSTEM FOR THE DISTILLATION OF SEA WATER
Kazem Mazen Kutob
Modern Montessori School, Amman, JORDAN

Due to the lack of pure drinkable water in many places around the world, and due to the fact that solar energy is probably the most abundant, renewable and free energy in existence, I decided to carry out my research in the field of distilling sea water, or any non-pure water, using solar energy. <br><br>This challenging quest needed an in depth investigation. Many thoughts developed, several experiments were carried out to determine the materials and the components I should use, as well as how to overcome certain operational problems.<br><br>The final system consists primarily of a solar panel, a heat exchange and a solar reflective dish. The heat exchange fluid is heated up to high temperatures in the solar panel. The fluid circulates by the aid of a pump through the panel to a heat exchange unit where water flows. Water will then heat up, evaporate and pure water will condense on a cooled tilted surface for collection. The design of the solar panel and the chemicals used are unique of high efficiency.<br><br>The reflective dish is another means to collect and utilize solar energy. It will be focused on one side of the heat exchange unit and will further support the system by directing solar energy to heat up the water.<br><br>The system was tested in January and it was able to trap 16% of solar energy. <br><br>In conclusion, my system contributes utterly to both the humanity and our environment.

There is no proper tool readily available in the Sri Lankan market for removing seeds from raw nutmegs. Seed removing from nutmeg is the first step in the processing of nutmeg and the present method used is time consuming and causing damage to the seeds.<br><br> <br><br>The device developed by me is very simple and easy to manufacture at a reasonable cost. This consists of two curved blades of which one is mounted on the fixed (lower) arm and the other is on the moving (upper) arm with the help of a mounting shaft in such a manner that two curved edges of blades face each other. The mounting shaft is passed through a hole made on the upper arm and its top end is connected to a small turning lever. The blade mounted on the moving (upper) arm can be turned either sides by rotating the small lever fixed to the opposite end of the mounting shaft of the blade. A cylindrical section mounted to the bottom arm, is fixed surrounding the blade to hold the nutmeg.<br><br>Removing seeds from nuts are done by placing them on the holding cylindrical section surrounding the bottom blade and applying force to the upper arm and simultaneously turning the blade handle slightly to either sides. <br><br>This device was tested and found to be very useful for nutmeg farmers for manufacturing high quality seeds and improving productivity. It can be manufactured at a low cost and could be adopted for other applications as well.

COLLAPSIBLE STAIRCASE
Yasith Kanchana Lokuge
Ananda College, Colombo 10, Western, SRI LANKA

Large space which is normally required to construct a conventional staircase cannot be utilized for any other purpose. According to available data, a spiral staircase occupies 65-82% of the space normally required for an ‘L’ shaped staircase. The objective of this invention is to construct a staircase, utilizing the minimum space, leaving the remaining space to be used for any other purpose.<br><br> In this design, each stair that constitutes the assembly of the folding staircase is in the shape of a segment whose narrow end is attached to a cylindrical ring which is placed onto a main solid rod one on top of the other to make it moveable around this rod (axis). Each segment has a mechanism which draws the above segment when the staircase is folded or unfolded. <br><br> A programmed microcontroller governs the movement of the staircase through an electronic circuit. The power supply of the motor is controlled by a security password and an alarm indicates the folding and unfolding of staircase.Power from the electric motor installed under the floor level moves the lowermost segment of the staircase by means of a belt. The movement of the motor clockwise and anticlockwise turns the lowermost segment which draws the others in progress to fold or unfold the staircase.<br><br> The contribution of the project by this novel design of staircase is to save about 90% of the space normally required by a conventional spiral staircase. This novel design could be used in space critical applications particularly in urban areas.

STAIR CLIMBING STABILITY
Zachary Harrison Melnik
Viera High School, Viera, FL

The purpose of this project was to create a stable robot that can traverse stairs. The initial idea was to have the robot carry a glass of water up and down a set of stairs. The engineering required to design and build a robot that could climb stairs without exceeding a nominal G-loading was achieved.<br><br> The stable stair-climbing robot was the result of 9 iterations of building and testing. Each robot was evaluated in its ability to repeatedly climb a set of stairs. From the first robot with a treaded base to the final version with a tri-spoke uni-wheel design, the robot’s ability to climb the stairs improved with each change. Starting with robot 5, incremental changes to the stability and design of the wheel system greatly improved precision.<br><br> The stability of the robots was measured using an onboard data recorder. Only robots that were able to climb the stairs 5 times in a row were tested. Robot 9 was able to repeatedly climb the stairs maintaining a measured G-load between +1.21g and +.73 g. <br><br> As a result of the engineering done in this project, it was found that a robot could be made to climb stairs within the normal G-loading that would represent the ability for it to carry a glass of water up the stairs. However, not all the design goals of the project were met as the robot could not carry a glass of water and also could not descend the stairs.

DEVELOPING SCRAPS IV: THE SELF-CONTAINED, ROBUST, ANTHROPOMORPHIC, POWERED SKELETON--HYBRIDIZING A PROTOTYPE FOR INCREASED ENERGY EFFICIENCY
Ian Michael Bouligny
Catholic High School, New Iberia, LA

The focus of this study is the development of a lightweight, load-carrying exoskeleton leg based on passive dynamic walkers. Most exoskeletons to date have powered joints. This new design uses passive and quasi-passive elements in the ankle and knee joints, and articulates the hip with a unique lightweight actuator. Quasi-passive joints can dynamically be adjusted for corresponding changes in velocity and terrain. Once the joint has been reconfigured to match the desired speed or terrain it has encountered, it becomes passive. This architecture minimizes the power requirements for planar, bipedal motion by employing a low-mass, energy-efficient design. These designs can be employed in load carrying applications such as firefighting, military, and recreational activities or in physical therapy devices to aid in ankle related injuries.

ENERGY CONSERVATION THROUGH THE MITIGATION OF MULTIPLE DAYLIGHTING FACADE SCENARIOS FOR SCHOOLS
Bradley T Williams
Bishop McDevitt High School, Harrisburg, PA

My research quantified how the season of the year, climate of an area, and the orientation of a school affected the natural illumination and energy conservation of a classroom. After re-creating my school’s classroom and developing three new scenarios, I used the Sensor Placement and Optimization Tool (SPOT) program to see how the illumination of the room changes with each variable combination. Each model had the exact same window area, but on the three new models, light shelves were installed. Light shelves were the topic of last year’s experiment entitled “The Angle of Light Shelves and their Seasonal Efficiency in Natural Illumination and Solar Heat Gain.” This year’s project variables consisted of Summer, Winter, or Equinox; Overcast or Clear; and North or South. The control model was the current classroom style and one of the new models was based on a common mistake made by architectural engineers when designing “green” schools. I found my results to be surprising in regards to how much money can be saved in electricity bills when changing to one of my new “green” school strategies.

ELECTROKINETICS

The electromagnetic coil gun is a fascinating concept. Instead of gunpowder or springs, it uses electromagnetism alone to fire projectiles at high velocities. <br><br> Scientists are planning on using this technology in the future to launch unmanned satellites into orbit and radioactive wastes out of orbit. The hypothesis in this project is that a coil that is ten centimeters wide and two layers thick will be the most efficient and that no efficiencies will exceed 10% (efficiency is defined as the percentage of the capacitor storage energy converted into kinetic energy in the projectile).<br><br> The electrokinetic gun in this project is called a Thompson coil. A high voltage capacitor bank is discharged into a flat coil of wire and coupling creates a repelling magnetic field in a disc-shaped aluminum projectile. To measure the kinetic energy of the projectile, the gun was fired upwards, the height of the projectile and its weight were recorded, and the kinetic energy was computed using the equation E=FD. Eight different coils were tested: 15cm, 10cm and 5cm wide with one, two and three layers. 5cm wide with one layer was not tested because its low impedance could break the capacitors. <br><br> Based on the tests conducted, the hypothesis must be rejected. The coil that is 15cm wide, not 10cm wide, and two layers thick is the most efficient. Also, a statistical insignificance was found between the 10cm wide coils with two and three layers.

THE TWO INCH PROBLEM, AN INGENIOUS SOLUTION FOR PUMPING SMALL WELLS
James Lee Clark
Mayfield High School, Las Cruces

The Two Inch Problem-<br><br>This project is aimed at creating a small diameter pump for wells in an area with a 20-40ft water table. The project is beneficial because it allows water to be pumped up from deep inside the well instead of attempting to pull the water up from a pump level with the well top. To remedy this problem the pump must be placed inside the well so that it can be pushing the water upward, rather than pulling it. The pump in this project will be able to pump water from greater depths because of the system will place the pump in the water and push the water up.<br><br>The project utilizes a piston and a cylinder which are lowered into the well, allowing water to be pushed upward with a two way pump. The two way pump will allow water to be pumped on both strokes. The two way pistons will force water in the same way as a dual action bike pump, pushing water when pushed and pulled.<br><br>This pump system will be revolutionary because of its ability to pump water at a moderate flow rate from greater depths than existing pumps. The system will also be invaluable in providing water for people in arid areas of the world. The system will also be capable of pumping for hundreds of hours without failure. The simplified design will enable servicing by replacing a few parts. This pump will be quite valuable in terms of simplicity and serviceability.

CAN A LIFE-SAVING CHILD CAR SEAT/CARRIER SYSTEM BE DESIGNED TO PROTECT AGAINST PASSENGER COMPARTMENT TEMPERATURE EXTREMES?
Christopher Michael Piette
La Salle Academy, Providence, RI

The purpose of this experiment is to prove that a thermoelectric cooling/heating unit, together with attention-getting alerts, could be incorporated into a child car seat/carrier system to provide temperature regulation in the event of automobile passenger compartment temperature extremes. To substantiate this, I performed a series of evaluations of components that would be integrated into this system, and used these components to build a functional prototype. These include thermal sensors, a hacked cell phone that auto-dials a caregiver’s cell phone, a strobe light, vocal and audio alarms, a scrolling LED emergency message, and, most importantly, a temperature-regulating Peltier Junction-based thermoelectric device. The test data indicate that the Peltier Junction temperature differential was approximately 68° F between the heatsink and coldsink sides of the Peltier chip, which resulted in a suitably cold airflow output. The results of my experimentation indicate that this is, indeed, a feasible concept that could be mass produced with a thermally insulated cocoon-like housing to further moderate temperature extremes and save children’s lives.

RADIO WAVE SHIELD DESIGN IN AN MRI ENVIRONMENT
Sirish Veligati
Saint Joseph Central High School, St. Joseph, MO

The radio waves emitted from 3-5 Tesla MRI machines can cause the atoms in the patient’s body to precess at such a high level that the patient’s nerve cells may be stimulated, causing discomfort, and/or the heat produced may not be able to be successfully emitted from the patient’s body. This study was to determine the optimal design of radio wave shield in areas of flexibility, radio wave hindrance, temperature change, and target image interference. Based on Faraday Cages, the shields were built to execute these criteria. The flexibility was necessary to determine the practical use and reuse of the shields. The radio wave hindrance coverage determined the efficiency of the cages shielding ability. The temperature change determined whether or not the cage was a safety hazard to the patient, causing burns. If the radio waves were blocked from entering all but the target area of the patient - because they are necessary to perform the MRIs – the patient will avoid unnecessary discomfort. The layered rings design was hypothesized to be the most efficient shield in all areas. The single direction wires design most efficiently hindered the radio waves, but was least flexible. None of the shield designs significantly increased in temperature.

The purpose of this project is to design and construct a robotic salamander capable of movement that replicates the gait of a real salamander. Experiments are carried out to determine how various design factors effect robot speed and gait. Robot leg length and the pattern of undulation are factors influencing speed and gait. Further research might include development of an autonomous control system for the robot.

THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A FLEXIBLE ROBOTIC DEVICE
Adam Thomas Goss
Brush High School, Brush, CO

The goal of this project was to create a robotic device that is controlled entirely from a remote computer. The robot should be able to complete the following: A) run any USB device on the market today for data collection, B) provide the operator with a video feed from the robot, and C) allow all operation and control to take place from a workstation (computer and RC controller). The Flex-Bot meets all three of these requirements. It establishes a connection between two computers, one in the robot and another standalone, transmitting data via a connection of choice. Any USB device on the market can be used on the robot for scientific research, and any change can be made to the computer running these devices from the host pc. This combination makes for a uniquely powerful device that is relatively inexpensive yet still competitively powerful.<br><br> The Robot runs from two drive wheels, and four independent fully rotating wheels. The middle two are omni directional and act much in the same manner as a skid steer. Tires can be changed as does the mission, ranging from off-road tires to streamlined indoor tires. Off road tires for the Flex-Bot are large, yet with lots of relief, imitating shocks but serving the same purpose. <br><br> The combination of physical strength and technologic power in the Flex-Bot create a uniquely inexpensive, adaptable powerful robotic platform that can be used by any person, for any job, something uncommon in today’s robotic world.

Virginia Lynne Martin
Academics, Etc., Lake Charles, LA

The purpose of this project is to build an equipment control system using Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) technology that will automatically shut-down the primary equipment when an equipment alarm is detected and start the back-up equipment. The engineering objective for this project is that using the same equipment and wiring, three different operating systems can be constructed by using a Programmable Logic Controller. <br><br> A pressure switch was added to the existing test stand. The test stand also included the equipment simulator (Fan Unit), a Programmable Logic Controller, and four other devices to simulate equipment monitors.<br><br> The program for the experiment was written on a Personal Computer using PLC software called WindLDR. The first program was then loaded from the computer to the Programmable Logic Controller. The first control system operates the equipment simulator with the back-up equipment on stand-by. If there is an alarm that affects the primary equipment there will be a five second delay before the back-up equipment will take over. In some circumstances an immediate response is needed. If an alarm is tripped on the second control system, the primary equipment will shut-down and the back-up equipment starts immediately. The third control system is fault tolerant. The fault tolerant control system allows the primary equipment to continue to operate until two or more equipment alarms are detected.<br><br> The engineering object was achieved because all three programs operate the equipment in the desired manner. <br><br> This type of equipment and programming can be useful in critical operating systems. It can be used in aircraft operating systems and operating system in industrial plants where equipment failure would cause damage to equipment injury, death to the operator, or danger to the general public.

PROPELLANTLESS PROPULSION: DESIGNING A VOLTAGE DEPENDENT DIRECTIONAL CONTROL SYSTEM FOR ASYMMETRICAL CAPACITORS
Stephen Jerome Trettel
New Prague High School, New Prague, MN

The net force produced by geometrically dissimilar high voltage electrodes was discovered nearly nine decades ago, but has remained largely unexplored by mainstream physics. These electrode configurations, referred to as asymmetrical capacitors, are able to produce force silently, without moving parts, and without the release of an onboard propellant; all novel and useful properties. Last year's research uncovered a theoretical explanation for the origin of the force, but progress must be made in control before potential applications can be sought.<br><br>A basement laboratory was constructed in which to perform preliminary experiments. The collected data suggested a voltage-based control system. Using the previously derived force equation, a method of directional control was devised that would allow rotations and translations along all three axes.

THE EFFECT OF FOUCAULT CURRENT ISOLATION ON INDUCED MAGNETIC LEVITATION
Dru Harrington Knox
Roanoke Valley Governor's School, Roanoke, VA

Currently, 13% of America’s shipping industry utilizes trains. Conventional trains burn toxic fossil fuels and run with higher friction, reducing efficiency. Magnetically levitated trains (Maglev) run at higher speeds with zero friction and are entirely electric. The EDS (electrodynamic suspension) Maglev system utilizes magnetic induction to levitate, allowing greater levitation, efficiency, and stability. As of yet, data on which EDS track design is most efficient in terms of levitation height, magnetic drag, and stability is inconclusive.<br><br> This study measured the effect of track separation on Maglev efficiency. It was hypothesized that, if the Maglev track were separated into discrete, connected sections, then greater levitation and travel distance would be produced.<br><br> A quantitative, descriptive design was used to analyze 35 trials each on a homogenous track; a track with discrete, connected pieces; and a track with discrete, disconnected pieces. In a scale test; speed, levitation height, travel distance, and levitation stability were measured for all track types. Variables were measured using a video camera, tape measures, and a photogate. <br><br> The mean levitation height for each track design was: homogenous (.16964 in.); discrete connected (.25536 in.); and discrete disconnected (.06875 in.). The mean travel distances for the track types were: homogenous (32.679 in.); discrete connected (42.538 in.); and discrete disconnected (27.748 in.). All values mentioned above were significantly different using a 95% confidence interval.<br><br> This study broadens understanding of EDS Maglev principles by expanding empirical data on track performance. This data could be used to determine the most efficient Maglev track design.

THE EFFECTS OF NATURAL DYES IN DYE SENSITIZED SOLAR CELLS
Hamilton Edwin DelGrosso
Ballard High School, Louisville, KY

This experiment was based around the dye sensitized solar cell as a replacement for the silicon solar cell. The purpose was to test to see if natural dyes could provide greater efficiencies in the DSSC's. The hypothesis was that if light was placed on the solar cell, then the natural dyes would range from worse to as good as the artificial dyes. However it was thought that the cost-efficiency ratio would favor the natural dyes. The hypothesis was expanded later to being based on acidity of the natural juice. First, the DSSC was constructed with two halves, a titanium working-electrode and a platinum counter-electrode. the electrolyte was injected to allow electricity to circulate. Each cell was then hooked to a potentiostat, where it was tested using I/V spectroscopy test. This showed both current and voltage of the cell. using this data, it was plugged into a formula to calculate % efficiency. The main results were that natural orange juice performed the best of all the natural dyes, with grape coming in second, and tea ending last. The analyses are based around the chemical properties of the natural dyes. It seemed that the best juices were those that contained weak organic acids. This is why orange juice performed the best. Tea contains little to no acids, and in fact will register as a base on the pH scale. This would potentially be why it was not a good conductor for the cell. In conclusion, a weak acid would perform the best and has the most potential to be used in these DSSC's with natural dyes.

ENGINEERED ANAEROBIC DIGESTION UTILIZING A THERMOPHILIC MEDIA
Barnett Samuel Koven
Millburn High School, Millburn, NJ

My research focuses on the digestion of biodegradable waste in a sealed reactor, using a heat loving bacteria. Anaerobic digestion has shown considerable promise in diverting biodegradable waste from landfills and converting it into methane gas, for energy production. Current reactor designs only utilize mesophilic bacteria, which results in low efficiency. Working off of the hypothesis that the efficiency of anaerobic digestion would be significantly increased by utilizing a thermophilic bacteria, it was necessary to design a custom tailored, plug flow (or gravity feed) reactor and pre-treatment vessel. The reactor preformed well beyond expectation, the methane fraction of the biogas increased by 20% over the most efficient mesophilic system, yielding, on average 70% methane, 30% carbon dioxide and less than 1% trace gasses. The retention time decreased 3 fold, to 11 days. Additionally, the mud like byproduct proved to be highly valuable as fertilizer, with large concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorous. Furthermore, as a result of the high temperatures and 11 day reaction time the byproduct of the waste material was classified Class A Pathogene Free (US EPA denomination denoting fertilizer is safe for land application land which will grow food for human consumption).

BIONIC ARM: AN APPLICATION OF ELECTROMAGNETICS
Morgan Alexander Walti
Liberty High School, Hillsboro, OR

New prosthetic limbs can be controlled directly by the brain, yet are not strong enough to perform the functions demanded of them. Servo motors have been used, and hydraulic and pneumatic systems have proven cumbersome. This investigation looks specifically at the application of electromagnetic solenoids as actuators for a bio-mechatronic (bionic) arm. <br><br>The goals behind this project are to 1) build a mechanically correct model of the human arm (i.e. one that moves the way a human arm does); 2) develop an efficient solenoid to act as an artificial muscle for this arm. Electromagnetic solenoids generate substantial magnetic fields thus the arm must be constructed of aluminum and polymer components, to minimize losses. The solenoids will be developed for the best mechanical force to temperature ratio. <br><br>The metal skeletal frame that was constructed proved successful, functioning mechanically like a human arm. The solenoids did move the fingers however the larger functions, such as the wrist functions were inoperable because the solenoids were not powerful enough to move the wrist. A new solenoid was constructed and it successfully moved the wrist. Since the frame was not welded but glued together there were many joint failures due to the weight of the solenoids exceeding the joint strength. Further work would include the construction of a stronger, more versatile frame, the integration of stronger joints, and an investigation into more powerful solenoids.

EVALUATION ON LASER DISPLAY PROJECTOR
Kuan Ting Chen
Cranbrook Kingswood School, Bloomfield Hills, MI

In my research, I designed and tested a proof-of-concept model for a laser display projector that is brighter and lighter than the current display devices. A 5.1 channel sound card actuates and synchronizes an x-axis scanner, a y-axis scanner, a red laser diode, and processes the input signal simultaneously. The structurally straightforward design allows users to adjust projected image sizes and resolutions. <br><br>The data I needed to prove that my model worked includes three parts. First, the measurements of the relationships between input current and output power in order to control laser diode. By analyzing the emitted laser point, I concluded the required current for a certain level of the color red. Second, the measurements of projected line for scanners on different frequencies from 20 to 400Hz and at different voltages from 0.5V to 1.5V that demonstrated the resonant frequency and scan line length of my scanners. Lastly, I calculated the scanning speed and time periods from a point on the scan line to another point by following its periodic motion modeled by the Simple Harmonic Motion equation. I successfully projected Lissajous figures with my projector.<br><br>My model produces a brighter image and is robust and reliable in its construction, so it also has a longer working life time, lighter weight and lower power consumption than current projectors. Users can define the resolution of the image and project it to any type of screen. This project could be applied to the next generation laser rear-projection television.

MAGNETIC HEAT ENGINE
Aqsa Jamil
Western High School, Baltimore, MD

The purpose of this research was to build a homemade magnetic heat engine, then test it, by determining whether or not it could demonstrate the important scientific principle of the Curie Effect, which states that every magnetic substance, at its Curie point, loses its ability to be magnetized. The structure of the box was built using bricks or wood, in order to allow the pendulum to swing back and forth. The pendulum was made using copper wire and a small magnet. Using hot glue gun, the researcher glued the wire in a shape of a pendulum to the box and placed the large magnet in front of the small magnet, so they can connect. Then a small lighted candle was placed under both magnets. The effect of the heat source (candle) took more than three hours to produce a reaction, due to which the observations were lengthy. All in all, the experiment worked when the small magnet lost its ability to be magnetized and swung back. As a conclusion, the experiment did work, which meant that the hypothesis was correct. One can build a homemade magnetic heat engine in order to demonstrate the important scientific principle of the Curie Effect.

ROVAAR (ROBOTIC VEHICLE FOR AUTOMATION APPLICATION RESEARCH), PART II
Brian Michael Cherbak
Hanover Central Junior/Senior High School, Cedar Lake, IN

A system that maintains a feedback system of inputs directing outputs is called process control. A programmable logic controller (PLC) is an electronic device used in automation that is interfaced by a written digital program to take the place of relays. Some also have the ability to run analog process (variable input/output) through PID (proportional-integral-derivative) loops. <br><br> The purpose is to build a base robot to which specific additions can be added depending on the future task of the robot (i.e. bomb control, radioactive environment control, etc.).<br><br> The PLC governs a number of specific tasks. Two digital sensors at each end of the robot give the system a sight input to avoid collision. A PID loop in the drive allows the system to maintain speed and surmount smaller obstacles that avoid the vision path of the machine. A larger program allows for expanded programming. A volt meter reads battery voltage. The robot now uses a garage door opener remote/receiver to start the program in the PLC. A logic circuit not run by the PLC gives machine safety with limit switches governing how far the robot can turn.<br><br> Other devices added include two solar panels for charging the batteries and wheels machined from aircraft aluminum to maximize durability and traction. Gear reduction was added to the steering motor to increase control and reduce speed. The center joint has an added bearing race to minimize friction, and to allow more weight to be added to the machine in the future.

GYROSCOPIC STEERED HOVERCRAFT, PART TWO
Arturo Santana Arenas
Colquitt County High School, Moultrie, GA

Hovercrafts have long used rudders to steer the vehicle, but have proven difficult due to the inability of the rudder to turn at any speed the hovercraft is going.The student theorized that using a gyroscope to steer the hovercraft was better than using a rudder. To test the theory, the student performed an experiment with the following problem: ¿Does a gyroscopic steered hovercraft perform better than a rudder steered hovercraft? The purpose was to find out which steering technque worked best.The student hypothesized that the gyroscopic steered hoercraft would perform better.The student then built a simple hovercraft.A plastic sheet was wrapped around the disk bottom, glued at the top, and fastened with a rubber tubing on the side. A circular region of plastic on the center bottom was fastened to the disk with a small wooden disk.Then a gyoscope was welded to an electric drill. When the pilot holds a gyroscope while on the hovercraft and tilts it to one side, the hovercraft starts to spin. The results were that the gyroscopic steered hovercraft performed better. It provided quicker steering, a sharper turning radius,and equal turning capabilities at all speeds.

DESIGNING AN AUTONOMOUS TRACKING SYSTEM FOR EFFICIENT SOLAR ENERGY COLLECTION
Jeffrey Daniel Fahland
Wrenshall High School, Wrenshall, MN

In today's environment of scarce energy resources it is important to make systems that produce or consume energy as efficient as possible. This project began as an attempt to<br><br>increase the efficiency of the ethanol production process by substituting heat energy from the sun for other forms used in the process. It was found that efficient solar energy collection requires very accurate tracking of the sun. The purpose of this project was to design, build, and test such a system.<br><br>An existing polar mounted solar concentrator was heavily modified in order to accommodate an electrical drive system. After the device was completed mechanically, web research was done in order to gather ideas to build an automatic electrical tracking system. Various designs were experimented with but most were discarded. Circuits that used operational amplifiers being driven by light emitting diodes as light sensors were developed into working designs on breadboard test setups and then constructed on circuit boards.. These were installed in boxes that could withstand being outside.<br><br>During testing, adjustments were made to circuit sensitivity, shadowing arrangements for light sensors, and mechanical tuning of the motors, gearing and positioning of the polar mount.<br><br>Tests were run to see if constant temperatures could be maintained that were high enough to run the boiler.<br><br>The results showed that this is possible, even on some of the coldest, shortest days of the year, with variable cloud cover, as these tests were conducted in late December and early January.

A manufacturing company generates a waste stream of 15,000 tons of bauxite ceramic beads annually. The waste is disposed in landfills at a cost of $400,000. The project objective is to find a viable use for this waste stream. <br><br> Research suggests that ceramics have the ability to absorb and retain heat. The researcher’s objective is to devise a method to collect heat, store it in the ceramic beads, and then utilize that heat when required. <br><br> Initial tests validated that the ceramic beads are a more efficient heat storage media than other common materials. Four sample materials were heated then cooled while monitoring product temperatures to determine absorption and retention characteristics. Tests were conducted around the home to identify collectable, renewable sources of heat. Roof shingles subjected to direct sunlight proved to be the highest source of heat. <br><br> A model was fabricated to represent a roof section. Solar collectors were installed in direct contact with the shingles. A heat exchanger was constructed containing two individual copper coils. The exchanger was filled with ceramic beads. A solar-powered agricultural pump circulated water through the solar collectors into the heat exchanger where the heat was stored in the beads. The outlet coil was connected in series with the cold water supply to the hot water tank. <br><br> The system has indicated that ceramic beads can be used as a heat storage media retaining heat for over eight hours. This application could reduce hot water energy requirements by 30% by preheating the cold water delivery.

RESEARCH ON AUTONOMOUS FLIGHT CONTROLLER AND LOW-ALTITUDE ROBOTIC AIRCRAFT
Jun Qiu
Shenzhen Senior High School, ShenZhen, Guang Dong, CHINA

With the intention to apply robotic control technologies to model helicopter, turning it into a low-altitude robotic aircraft, I create the "Autonomous Flight Controller". <br><br>The "Autonomous Flight Controller" comprehends four parts: flight control computer (with loaded flying logic program and device communication program), GPS receiver unit and electronic compass, rudder motor servo driver, and remote control and auto flight control switching device. <br><br>In the design of the low-altitude robotic aircraft system, I have adopted automatic balance instrument, in which the control objects of the three-axis gyroscope are respectively aileron, elevator and tail rudder, and in which, the displacement sensor is used to inhibit the drift. In the absence of intervention of remote and aerobatic control, the automatic balance instrument is able to keep the low-altitude robotic aircraft to suspend at any low altitude. On the basis, the intervention of the "Auto Flight Controller" enables an autonomous flight of the robotic aircraft in a safe and efficient manner. This is where the essence of my design lies. Double-GPS combined operation is adopted, in which GPS positioning accuracy is increased to 20 cm of horizontal and 40 cm of relative height; radio network communication technologies are applied in low-altitude robotic aircraft system, which not only implements network communication between the "Auto Flying Controller"and ground surveillance computers, but also avails the on-board task system of a bandwidth rate of 2 MB to enable the video camera in the on-board system to realize rapid and real-time transmission of video images. <br><br>The low-altitude robotic aircraft system can be applied in the field of military surveillance, geographical information, environmental protection, disaster prevention and relief, and scientific research, etc.

A WHEELCHAIR WHICH WILL ALLOW WHEELCHAIR-BOUND PEOPLE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM INDEPENDENTLY
Janice S. Kim
Syosset High School, Syosset, NY

The National Health Interview Survey on Disability in 1994/1995 found that approximately 1.6 million Americans living outside of institutions are wheelchair bound. Although many of them experience greatly enhanced mobility with the use of wheelchairs, majority of senior citizens and some paraplegics are still unable to do one of the most private and basic bodily functions independently—going to the bathroom. In order to give them that independence, a miniature folding wheelchair was modified to have a retractable seat and a superstructure capable of raising and lowering someone. The superstructure utilizes a lead-screw system. The cross braces underneath the seat were also removed—to provide clearance for the toilet under the wheelchair—and replaced with an alternative support structure.

SMART SEARCH: A LOCATION DETECTION SYSTEM
Jordan Michael Krell
Plankinton High School, Plankinton, SD

In 2006 the Federal Bureau of Investigation received 662,228 reports of missing persons under 18. Almost half of all lost children are involuntarily lost from their parents with most separations lasting between 1 to 4 hours. These circumstances may be avoided through the use of a new electronic device that I have created called the Smart Search. To determine if a child is separated from a parent, a small radio frequency transmitter module worn on the body sends an “all safe” signal to a receiver handset. The Smart Search determines the range by measuring the received signal strength, and the range is user adjustable. <br><br> The Smart Search is also aided by nature. In a crowded environment a parent generally wants a child closer than in a wide open space; fortunately, a heightened number of obstacles will reduce the strength of the signal. For instance, in a crowded mall the range of the Smart Search is reduced. A parent can also “page” a child by depressing a button on the receiver which causes the child’s transmitter to sound an alarm. The Smart Search is a fail safe product that aids in locating a potentially lost child.

HYBRID ELECTROMAGNETIC DRUM BRAKE SYSTEM
Syed Mohd Esmat Hussaini Syed Mohd Ridzuan
Mara Junior Science College, Taiping, Taiping, Perak, MALAYSIA

The HYBRID ELECTROMAGNETIC DRUM BRAKE SYSTEM (HYBRID EDBS)is the product of detailed studies in various scientific fields such as electromagnetism and mechanical engineering. This system is developed based on the conventional Hydraulic Drum Brake System (HDBS) to improve the operation of the present drum brake system. The main purpose is to increase performance of terms of effectiveness, sensitivity, consistency, simplicity, lightweightedness, cost effectiveness and environmental friendliness. <br><br> <br><br> The process of designing the HYBRID EDBS began with detailed research in the above related fields. Following the data taken, two prototypes were designed and compared for their strengths and weaknesses. One of the prototyps was chosen and constructed. The prototype was tested in the above asp[ects and compared to those in the conventional HDBS.<br><br> <br><br> Tests on its effectiveness and sensitivity were conducted and results showed that the HYBRID DBS was more effective as it reduced the initial speed of the same car by approximately 36.4% compared to the conventional HDBS, the speed of which was reduced by only 28.3%. Besides, the HYBRID EDBS costs 27.5% less than the HDBS and is much lighter by 46.7%.<br><br> <br><br> From extensive tests conducted on its sensitivity and consistency the performance of the HYBRID EDBS is proven to be much better. Moreover with its simple design, lightweight structure, consistent braking force and non-brake fluid usage which further contribute to its cost effectiveness and environmental friendliness, the HYBRID Electromagnetic Drum Brake System can be applied in other fields of transportation, machinery and automotion. These positive features make it the true breakthrough brake system of the future.

ELECTROMAGNETIC ACCELERATOR EFFICIENCY COMPARISONS
Alexander Field Fredrickson
Brophy College Preparatory, Phoenix, AZ

This project is a testing of two electromagnetic accelerators, a Railgun and a Coilgun, to find which one is more efficient at launching mass. The idea was to test both accelerators under the same controls with the same projectile and find their efficiencies at converting electrical energy to kinetic energy. The Coilgun succeeded in launching its 2.26-gram ferrous iron mass/projectile 17 times but the Railgun would not shoot the projectile. Due to this problem, another projectile was milled out of carbon, as carbon would not readily weld itself to the rails like the metal did. The Railgun successfully fired the .3-gram carbon block. <br><br>Efficiencies were determined by first using trigonometry to analyze the horizontal and vertical displacements. Once these were put into equations, velocities were found and could then be put into kinetic energy equations. After finding the input electrical energy and the output mechanical/kinetic energy for both systems, efficiencies could be calculated accordingly. The Coilgun had a 1.35% mean efficiency while the Railgun had a .0039% efficiency.<br><br>Although these are both quantitative results, due to the fact that the controls were changed for the Railgun, proper comparisons cannot be made. It would not be accurate to deem one more efficient over the other. Further adjustments and more funding could lead to better analysis between the two and development of future uses for the accelerators.

WIFICAM: A SCALEABLE VISUALIZATION OF WIRELESS NETWORK SIGNALS
William Fairclough Whitney
Mountain Brook High School, Mountain Brook, AL

This project aims to create a fully scaleable system for the visualization of electromagnetic radiation, specifically the 2.4GHz frequency used by wireless local area networks (WiFi). The goal is to scan quickly, generating low resolution images, or slowly, creating high resolution; the results should reveal sources of these wireless signals and optical characteristics in this wavelength of static objects.<br><br> The project uses an Arduino Diecimila microcontroller board to operate two servomotors oriented for x- and y-axis rotation of a waveguide antenna. The software on the Arduino iterates the position of the servos, and through them the antenna, over the area of the image sampling desired. The signal strength is sampled continuously by a computer via the waveguide antenna, then this data is correlated to antenna position and an image is generated with every sample location a pixel.<br><br> The project was very successful. The scanning can be scaled to greater or lesser detail, and the more-detailed images clearly reveal the "topography" of the signals. Obstructions to the signal are visible, as are sources of greater or lesser intensity. The data could be used in aiming a directional antenna for maximum signal or in designing a wireless network for widespread clear signal reception. In the future this project could be expanded by a software-defined radio to expand the frequencies scanned, generating a three-dimensional model in wavelengths from microwave to far radio which would have an enormous amount of data including "vision" of objects and processes invisible to the naked eye.

ELECTROMAGNETIC LEVITATION: A DIGITAL CONTROL SYSTEM
Chris James King
Creek Wood High School, Charlotte, TN

The purpose of this engineering project was to test the feasibility of creating a digitally controlled system capable of holding a ferromagnetic object at an arbitrary position in 3D space and in equilibrium with the constant force of gravity acting on the mass of the suspended object. This project involved the construction of sensor boards, electromagnets, and a controller board. An AVR series microcontroller ran software written in the C programming language and handled the digital feedback positioning of this system. Custom tooling and parts were designed and fabricated during the construction of this project. CAD software was used extensively to design precise mechanical assemblies as well as all of the circuit boards that this project required. Results of this experiment demonstrated that stability relative to magnetic flux distribution tends to be problematic. While this system was able to stably hold a levitated object in space under digital control, the range of movement achieved was limited. Computer simulation of magnetic field lines was used to confirm the unstable nature of this device. Final data showed that although range is limited, this system still provides an accurate and reliable means of controlling the position of a levitated object. Possible applications of this technology are in scientific testing and research areas such as wind tunnel testing, hydrodynamic research, and in isolated systems testing.

A SELF-NAVIGATING BALLOON-PAYLOAD RECOVERY SYSTEM
Andrea Esther Kuklenyik
Collins Hill High School, Suwanee, GA

Weather balloons are used for carrying expensive devices to measure weather conditions, pollution, cosmic radiation, ozone levels, etc. Once the balloon bursts, the payload is recovered by chase vehicles following a radio beacon which was on the balloon. The radio beacon is then used to locate the payload. To improve this recovery process, a payload recovery aerial vehicle was constructed. <br><br> First, this recovery system is supposed to take an initial GPS measurement and memorize it. Once the payload is released, the vehicle should glide the payload back to its initial location.<br><br>The two main parts of the system is the airframe and the electronics. The airframe was constructed using Styrofoam coated with epoxy and fiberglass. The body was composed of plastic bottles. It was attempted to keep in the total weight under four pounds to fall under the least regulated category of the Federal Aviation Administration’s FAR101 Rules. <br><br> The electronics consisted of four main parts. The position was acquired by a GPS module and retrieved by Basic Stamp. The Basic Stamp collected the data and was transmitted to the AVR Stamp which took the information that it was given and calculated the heading or angle at which the glider should travel toward. Then the AVR Stamp turns the plane by adjusting the servos which move the ailerons.<br><br> The airplane was tested 5 times on a nearby large slope to simulate a weather balloon and allow it to glide back to the starting location. It came within 25 yards of the initial location.

OPTIMIZING WIND POWER: DESIGN OF A HYBRID WIND TURBINE USING ACTIVE SOLIDITY CONTROL FOR LOW WIND SPEED POWER CAPTURE
Parker Owan
Owan Homeschool, Tucson, AZ

Modern high efficiency propeller wind turbines operate at high tip speed ratios (4-7 TSR), while Dutch and American windmills operate below 4 TSR, with low efficiency. A wind turbine that operates between 0-4 TSR with improved efficiency could be used effectively in low wind regimes. Testing the performance of low tip speed ratios requires a low speed wind tunnel for accurate results. I designed and built a wind tunnel with laminar flow between 4 and 22mph since facilities in Arizona and California were unavailable with this capability.<br><br> A predictive analytical model was developed based on the previous year’s project results. This model utilizes prediction of power coefficient based on a drag model for wind speeds below 14mph, and uses a lift-based power coefficient prediction for wind speeds above 15mph. The predictive model includes generator efficiency. I developed and fabricated a scale test model vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) with 12% solidity and +/- 60% active solidity control. The data taken demonstrates Savonius-type behavior for a 0-1 TSR, and maintains comparable efficiency for a 1-3 TSR, thus bridging the performance gap between drag and lift-based generating systems. Comparing the predictive model and test data shows correlation within 22%.<br><br> Predicting the power produced by a larger machine intended for residential use indicates for a cut-in wind speed of 7mph, a 1.5KW generator would achieve full power in wind speeds of 20mph. This would conservatively produce annual revenue of more than $1000 for low wind regimes typical of most residential areas.

SCAVENGING POWER FROM WAVE MOTION FOR AUTONOMOUS BUOYS
Thomas Frederick Wilkason
Mount de Sales Academy, Macon, GA

The goal of this project is to design an electrical generator that harnesses wave motion to provide electrical power to a buoy in the open ocean. Many buoys contain electrical devices and the batteries or fuel based generators are difficult to replace. The model buoy is self-powered using six faraday generators. Each of the generators feed a bridge rectifier with all of the outputs connected in parallel to a large capacitor that charges a battery. This model is a scale model used to determine if a larger model could be used to keep a full-sized buoy powered. <br><br> The buoy generator design was modeled to compute the expected power output and results were compared to the measurements taken.<br><br> To measure the output, the buoy generator was connected to a computer using a Dataq device and the voltage and current was measured using the Dataq program. The program showed the voltage from each individual generator as well as the overall voltage and current charging the battery.<br><br> Each of the individual generators produces around 4 volts at their 4Hz resonant frequency. The buoy generator produced around 50 milliamps. The buoy generator was predicted to produce around 55 milliamps. A larger scale generator was designed that could potentially produce 400+ watts.<br><br> This project concluded a buoy could be self-powered using faraday generators. Using the proven design models, a full scale generator could be designed and built.

RIGHT ANGLE COUPLING, III: THE THEORY OF COUPLING OPTICAL WAVEGUIDES AT A RIGHT ANGLE ON THE NANO-SCALE
Trinity Ann Romney
Riverton High School, Riverton, UT

An essential part of optical computing is the development of an optical processor. One component of this is coupling optical waveguides or photonic crystal waveguides. In-line coupling of nano-scale waveguides has been accomplished using both optical waveguides and photonic crystal waveguides. For three years, I have worked towards the right-angle coupling of optical waveguides, which is necessary in the creation of optical processors. <br><br> <br><br>After testing several model iterations on the macro scale with 3mm glass rods, a laser pointer, and a light sensor, and mathematically predicting the amount of light the models should transfer on the nano scale in my two previous iterations of the project, I obtained a temporary license for waveguide modeling software called RSoft to use in this years iteration of my project. <br><br> <br><br>Using RSoft FullWA angle using different radii of lenses. Through my experiments of these several models I was able to determine if the transfer ratios were sufficient to warrant actual production on the nano-scale. through to the other end of the second waveguide-and several iterations of two waveguides that were connected at a 90 angle-to direct the light to bend at 90VE and RSoft BeamPROP I simulated several variations of the two iterations of waveguides I determined were the best in my previous experiments: an in-line waveguide that connected to a waveguide that was cleaved at a 45

SOUNDS OF LIGHT, PHASE II
Monica June Lovato
Bernalillo High School, Bernalillo, NM

The purpose of the project, “Sounds of Light” was to determine whether light to could be changed into a sound frequency using a simple homemade light sensor. The light sensor, after fabrication, was tested using several different types of light sources ranging from fluorescent lighting to a candle flame. In phase two of the project Sounds of Light, the testing that the fabricated sensor was put through was more focused towards its ability to recognize the different types of light. It was using specialized equipment in a lab setting that I was able to visually see the light according to the sound. This fabricated sensor was also used for a robotics competition. Its ability to “see” a candle flame was used in conjunction with an ultrasonic sensor for fire detection. This robot was used as a testing base for the sensor, along with the Java software, and the Multisim9™ software. Along with the software and the robot, oscilloscopes, multimeters, and the ELVIS NI Simulator were used for testing. These were incorporated in the pre and post testing of the sensor. During the design phase of the sensor, the Multisim9 software, and the ELVIS NI Simulator were used to design the placement of the components used. Afterwards the other equipment was used as voltage, resistance, and visual specs tests. Using this equipment was beneficial, because it allowed the sensor to be used in a real world application.

PRACTICAL MOTION CAPTURE FOR MIXED-REALITY APPLICATIONS
William Brewton McGrath
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Alexandria, VA

A new approach to extend principles of real-time motion capture to mixed-reality applications is proposed. Mixed-reality is a new technology that enables the correlation of virtual and real entities. A chief problem currently facing mixed-reality systems is that they are too cumbersome and impractical to ever reach a level of ubiquity. These mixed-reality systems typically rely on GPS readings or advanced image recognition to insert the user into a virtual world. However, a discreet sensor-based solution can provide data reliable enough to achieve the same goal more practically. The proposed technique is implemented by directly gathering information about a user’s body in real time. The information is then applied to control a virtual representation of the person in a virtual world. The user sees a virtual scene through a head-mounted display (HMD) and can manipulate the scene naturally, using his or her real arm and hand. A mixed-reality system was designed and constructed to demonstrate this technique using inertial and resistive-bend sensors, an interface board, a head-mounted display, and a Java computer program that uses the Java3D libraries. The system allows a user to look around a virtual world as well as to reach out and manipulate objects in it with a virtual representation of an arm, controlled by the user’s real arm. The system’s accuracy and feeling of immersion can be further extended with more sensors, better display technology, and more advanced processing algorithms, which compels further research.

METHODS TO IMPROVE SOLAR CELL EFFICIENCY WITH EXPERIMENTAL DEMONSTRATION, MATHEMATICAL MODELING, AND APPLICATION
Xiya Zhu
Southside High School, Greenville, SC

In recent years, demand for solar energy has grown tremendously. However, using solar energy to completely replace the conventional fossil fuel based energy still has a long way to go, mainly because of the high cost.<br><br>This project, therefore, investigates the ways to increase solar power output from a solar system equipped with a given solar cell by using low cost reflecting surfaces. A lab test apparatus is built and three experiments are performed. First, a black roof is used and the optimal position of the solar cell relative to the light is found. Then, the solar cell output when using the black roof is compared to the solar cell output when a white roof and an aluminum panel is used. The experiments demonstrate that the solar cell can produce 19% more power when a white roof is used and 191% more power when an aluminum panel is used in addition to the white roof. This means that if a solar cell can save $100 annually, approximately $200 more can be saved when a white roof and an aluminum surface is used. <br><br>A mathematical model is developed and validated by the experiments. The model can be used to predict the solar power generated by any solar cell from any kind of light. Application of the model will lead to the determination of the optimal orientation of the solar cell and the reflecting surface so that the maximum power can be produced. Potential economic gain is significant.

ROBOTIC NAVIGATION THREE: TAKING CONTROL
Jonathan Edward Dumm
Penn Hills Senior High School, Pittsburgh, PA

This project focused on the development of an unprogrammed autonomous robot using multiple guidance and detection systems. It utilized tiered sensing systems to override manual control to provide effective object detection and avoidance. This latest revision of the project allows operator positioning of the robot. Onboard detection and control overrides operator control and then returns to this mode after any immediate threat is avoided. The project’s hypothesis involved development of these control systems without a complex microcontroller based navigational system. It relies on a custom interface using commercially available components to react to its environment. <br><br> Multiple testing cycles enabled an accurate assessment of the robot’s realtime performance to be determined. This was accomplished by using both a “straight line” control test as well as a “real world” test. The control test provided accurate baseline detection distances of multiple types of objects with both infrared and ultrasonic sensing technologies. The real-world test allowed a reasonable determination of the robot’s reactions to objects at random approach vectors and distances.<br><br> Both tests were conducted under high and low-light conditions to examine possible adverse effects on the robot’s performance in various real-world environments that these systems might be exposed to. The robot was proven capable of making consistent and accurate detections of all obstacles in its path without the benefit of accessing preprogrammed routines, supporting the project’s hypothesis. This type of research could be effectively utilized in a large number of applications valuable to the military, mining, industrial, and public safety sectors.

BIO-MEMS RADIO FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION (RFID) DEVICE FOR SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE MONITORING
Joshua Michael Schwartz
Oceanside High School, Oceanside, NY

Currently, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technologies are static systems, coding for only one specific set of information. A dynamic RFID system, in contrast with a static system, will alter based on a dependent variable, thus coding for a range of values that are reflective of the dependent variable. Because of their cylindrical coil form, inductors may expand and contract uniformly when coiled around an expanding or contracting object. A cylindrical coil inductor may be coiled around the Brachial Artery and alter its inductance values based on dynamic diameter values of the artery to obtain and monitor blood pressure data. A novel inductor-based bio-Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (bio-MEMS) dynamic Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) based system is proposed to obtain systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings to a high-degree of accuracy obtainable only through an in vivo device. In addition, the system is intended to obtain blood pressure readings on a continuous time-interval basis, as opposed to the conventional sphygmomanometer. The theorized device will consist of three major sub-components: a transmitter, a receiver/interrogator, and an RFID tag. The transmitter will oscillate at approximately 125 kHz, a standard for RFID technologies. The in vivo RFID tag will consist of a basic cylindrical inductor (in an RLC circuit) that will be coiled around the brachial artery (inserted via µ-needle) at roughly the same height level as the heart. Results have indicated that blood pressure and inductance of the RLC circuit have a direct relationship. The backscattered altered frequency waves will be digitally analyzed based on deviation from the voltage reference. The designed system will revolutionize the means of blood pressure monitoring.

INTELLIGENT IRRIGATION CONTROL SYSTEM
Rui Jin
Scripps Ranch High School, San Diego, CA

An enormous amount of real-time information that is available on the Internet can be accessed and used in traditional control systems to improve performance. Based on this idea, the finalist designed and built an autonomous control system that manages an irrigation system using Internet-obtained weather forecasts and local-obtained rainwater levels.<br><br> The control system consists of a computer and a circuit controlled by a microcontroller. In the computer, a Java program developed by the finalist downloads XML weather data from the Internet, parses the data to interpret the probabilities of precipitation for the next five days, and sends the precipitation data to the microcontroller through a serial port. A finalist-developed BASIC program in the microcontroller then interrupts the irrigation system if rain is predicted within two days. During and after a rain, the control system utilizes a rain sensor to detect the presence of rainwater, and keeps the irrigation interrupted when rainwater is present. To interrupt irrigation, the microcontroller opens a latching relay connecting the irrigation system power supply to the irrigation valves. <br><br> In arid environments such as San Diego, this control system could save an estimated 8000 gallons of water per year for a 1000 square feet lawn, or 21% of the total water to irrigate the lawn.

PROFILE
Tom Pitts
Stamford Endowed Schools, Stamford, Lincolnshire, UNITED KINGDOM

The profile is a bench top machine tool designed for filing metal. Filing using hand files is usually a painstaking and laborious task. Being a very keen metalworker, I have done my fair share of filing in the past, I therefore decided to address this problem for my A-level design & technology project. <br><br> After carrying out careful research, I came up with a variety of designs. My best design concept was for a bench mounted filing machine. Constructed mainly from steel and powered by an electric motor the machine has a file that passes through a hole in the middle of a steel table. Work can be pressed against the reciprocating file and manoeuvred by hand to perform complex and precise cuts. The file itself can be easily interchanged with different shaped files and blades lending its self to a wider variety of tasks. The table can be angled to perform chamfered cuts and de-burring tasks, for further precision the machine has different speed settings. The Profile is a very useful tool for model making and delicate metal work. Material can be cut away very quickly for rough work. It can also be used for very accurate and consistent work. <br><br> The profile is a very useful, compact and attractive looking machine tool, which would be very usful in many small workshops and factories. As a keen metal worker all manufacture and machine work for this project was carried out by my self.

'A stair/ramp handrail assisting device comprising a handle bar and a saddle member attached, the saddle having means for sliding freely and locking/ breaking of the device upon the handrail this is achieved by the inter-action of two dissimilar materials one with a high coefficient of friction and one with a low coefficient friction inside the saddle member'- as stated from patent application. <br><br> The StairSteady is a revolutionary handrail that helps people who may find stairs a challenge to keep active and feel a sense of well being by remaining independent. ‘The StairSteady’ is a high quality handrail, that’s fixed to the wall on either side of the stairs. It has a unique steadying handle and locking device so that people both ascending and descending the stairs can be supported. When weight is applied to the handle it locks, to give added support. The supporting handle folds away when not in use, making it suitable for a varied home setting. This allows the stairs to be used by both those with unlimited and limited mobility in the household.<br><br> The StairSteady was designed to be a low cost solution for people with limited mobility, rehabilitation needs and those temporarily suffering from sports injuries.<br><br> The original project idea came about when Ruth’s teacher’s father had a stroke and was told he needed to continue to exercise but was unable to use his stairs.

THE OPTIMIZATION OF A LINEAR RELUCTANCE OR INDUCTION MOTOR
Duncan C. Townsend
Albemarle High School, Charlottesville, VA

This study was conducted to determine design parameters that increase energy conversion efficiency in linear magnetic induction and reluctance motors. The hypothesis was that the use of a diagonal half bridge topology and unconventional projectiles will increase the efficiency with which energy stored in capacitors will be converted into kinetic energy of the projectiles.<br><br>A half bridge magnetic accelerator allowed energy from the unused magnetic field to return to the capacitors. Energy conversion efficiencies for solid and hollow magnetic steel projectiles were measured to determine whether magnetic saturation in the projectiles had been reached and whether the skin effect was confining magnetic field to the outer 1.5 mm of the projectile. Trials that used solid and hollow aluminum projectiles allowed closer examination of the skin effect. Eddy currents, which are necessary in induction motors, but are parasitic in reluctance motors, were also investigated, in trials with hollow, solid aluminum, and coil of wire projectiles.<br><br>The reluctance motor achieved a peak efficiency of 4.66%, higher than any other single stage reluctance motor in available literature. The solid steel projectile design had superior efficiencies than the hollow steel, indicating that the skin effect was not present to the degree expected and that the magnetic field approached the saturation point. The coil of wire projectile had higher efficiency than the aluminum projectiles, indicating that eddy currents are not naturally prevalent. These results can be applied to make magnetic linear motors more viable in laboratory, military, aerospace, transportation, and medical applications.

CAN A SMALLER MECHANISM BE DEVELOPED TO SIFT SANDY AREAS?
Kyla Elizabeth DeWees
Westside High School, Macon, GA

On beaches all around the world people are in danger of stepping on harmful debris when they are walking to the shore on small sandy paths. The debris left on these paths and other areas, such as children's playgrounds, can be harmful to the public. I have had personal experience with stepping on dangerous debris so I wanted to address the problem of not having a smaller sand cleaning mechanism on the market. I have developed a sifting mechanism that will clean up debris in the small areas that large machines cannot reach. This mechanism uses a timing belt with a series of 1/4" hardware cloth scoops that are 6 inches wide. These scoops can pick up a large variety of debris that present potential health and safety hazards to the public. The timing belt system includes a hand crank that is mounted on a stationary frame made of 3/4" PVC pipe. The sifting mechanism has 6 inches of working space and can fit into small areas that cannot be reached by larger machines. The mechanism I have developed is stationary but I hope to one day develop it into a moving product in order to make small sandy areas cleaner and safer for the public.

The purpose of this project was to develop a proof-of-concept design allowing multiple autonomous robotic systems to work together and intelligently accomplish tasks that a single, uncoordinated robot could not do efficiently. As a practical example, there is a high cost for transporting objects to extraterrestrial locations. This limitation can be addressed by the versatility of multiple robotic systems working together instead of using many specifically designed robots to perform individual tasks.<br><br>Using ultrasonic ranging, modulated infrared sensors, distributed processing and wireless communication technologies, my project resulted in a cooperative autonomous robotic system able to navigate an unknown environment and locate a desired object. Working together, the robotic systems orient and coordinate the retrieval and movement of the desired object.<br><br>This project works within the restrictions expected in extraterrestrial environments including the lack of predetermined navigation points, no on-site human direction, extremely limited off-site human direction, and a foreign and hazardous environment. This cooperative robotic system was able to overcome and work within these restrictions, accomplish the given task, and do so in an intelligent manner. <br><br>The results of my design testing indicate that using advanced, fast, and versatile wireless communications, infrared target detection, and protocol-based communications between distributed processors can permit intelligent movement and task coordination with multiple robotic systems in a remote environment.

DYNAMIC LOCOMOTION

In the past, mobile robots have been made to be statically stable, which means that they require three or four wheels to balance. Robots designed this way are very unstable unless equipped with a wide base. Applicable work areas have obstacles that vary in height, some that many small robots will not be able to reach or detect. <br><br> <br><br>Is there a solution to a mobile platform that can achieve this dynamic agility as to operate in a normal workplace and environment, without requiring the space that a statically stable robot would?<br><br>In this project, I will attempt to research and design a better locomotive platform for robots. This platform will be designed to improve the application of robotics by making them operate within a closer-to-human proportion, which may render a potential advantage to current robotic designs. To prove that my design may fit the need of efficiency, space, tallness, agility and common application, I will conduct an experiment by building a balancing prototype platform and testing to see if it can achieve dynamic agility within a reasonable amount of space.<br><br>In conclusion, my platform achieved dynamic agility by standing 19” tall and taking only a 5 ½” X 5” base, balancing dynamically on two wheels. It also showed potential advantage to a conventional platform for operating in a normal work environment for common tasks such as surveillance, safeguarding people or property, and service to the elderly or physically challenged. My design may also lead to building a Segway that can move omnidirectionally.

A NEW MEASUREMENT METHOD FOR THE HORIZONTAL ROAD'S RADIUS OF CURVATURE FOR THE MEASURING CAR
Ronnapee Chaichaowarat
Mahidol Wittayanusorn School, Phutthamonthon, Nakorn Pathom, THAILAND

Safety in road transportation is of primary concern in the world today. In order to evaluate the safety level of roads their geometric properties are analyzed and evaluated, determining among other properties a horizontal road’s radius of curvature. The present method for the measuring car to make this calculation uses a gyroscope which is expensive and therefore not cost effective in many parts of the world.<br><br> Therefore, a new method has been researched and designed using a 1/10th scale radio control pick-up truck which has a steering system consistent with Ackermann’s principle and a differential gear. The horizontal road’s radius of curvature was measured by comparing the distance traveled by the inner wheel and that of the outer wheel when the car was traveling on a curve path. A PIC18F8722 microcontroller was used to receive digital signals from two H21A1 phototransistor optical interrupter switches which were located near both rear wheels and a ±2g dual axis accelerometer which located in the middle of the floating axle, and then transmit to the computer using wireless signals. The graph showing the relationship between the distance from origin and each specific point measured in the horizontal road’s radius of curvature will be displayed on the Graphic User Interface (GUI) of the computer.<br><br> This model used a new measurement method for the horizontal road’s radius of curvature. In order to reduce the margin of error in real life conditions a rotary encoder should be used. This principle can be applied to any general car. The main advantage of this new measuring system is evaluation without a gyroscope. Moreover, the system uses wireless network connection, which allows for several cars to be used with one computer, which permits measurement to be taken in several locations at the same time. Therefore, it makes it more cost effective and productive.

A STUDY OF PASSIVE FILTERS USED ON SOUNDS SYSTEMS WITH SEVERAL AUDIBLE FREQUENCIES
Cristian Rodriguez
Francisco Morales High School, Naranjito, PUERTO RICO

This research is about the effect of a sound speaker used with a “crossover” or passive filter on the frequency of sound wave. The hypothesis was that if a “crossover” or passive filter is integrated to a sound speaker, the frequency of the sound wave will be affected and the sound will be of high quality. Two identical subwoofers were used. In one of them the crossover was installed and the other was used as the control one.<br><br>Each of the subwoofers used had three speakers, two middle ones and a high one. The high speaker was the twitter with a diameter of 6.35cm, a 2.54 cm cone and a high frequency of 35.35 Hz. Each of two middles speakers had a diameter of 12.70 cm and a 5.08cm cone in which the highest frequency was 70.7 Hz <br><br>A crossover was connected to one of the subwoofers. The two middles speakers were connected to the middle line and the twitter was connected to the high line or channel. The high and low frequencies of each subwoofer were measured. An oscilloscope, using a computer and the software audio Wins ISD0.50.7 were used to make these measurements Graphics of frequency were made. Data collected demonstrated that the speaker with the crossover got into frequencies of 24-115 Hz (without distorting the sound) while the speaker without the crossover got into 17 -60 Hz only. <br><br>The conclusion was that the use of the crossover increased the frequency of the sound produced without distorting it.

ULTRA MINIATURE SWITCHING POWER SUPPLY WITH MOVEMENT SENSOR
Thomas Reiter
Hoehere Technische Bundeslehr- und Versuchsanstalten, Waidhofen/Ybbs, Lower Austria, AUSTRIA

Analysis of thrown-away batteries shows that they often have residual capacities up to 50%. Main reasons are that Alkalinebattery-powered devices either switch off at cell voltages of already 1.4V (making the use of accumulators having lower nominal voltages also impossible) or operating-parameters (e.g. brightness, RPM-ratio,...) decrease so much that users replace them too early.<br><br>The initial idea was developping an universal stepup-converter smallest possible size and highest possible efficiency which fits in batteries or accumulators keeping the up to 12V adjustable outputvoltage constant independent from inputvoltages down to 0.8V guaranteeing complete discharge. <br><br>Since the converter would start immediately after assembling a control circuit activates it only when a microvibration sensor which detects movements indicates power is needed ( a high challenge due to the low inputvoltage!).<br><br>In the case battery-manufactures refuse installing such converters universal backfitting adapters were developed having size and shape of commercial batteries e.g. AA-type and taking up the next smaller battery e.g. AAA-type and a converter. Exploiting the whole capacity of the smaller battery gives a higher useable capacity than the until now used only 50% of the bigger battery. <br><br><br>This invention ensures that:<br><br>• residual-capacities are fully utilized<br><br>• devices get suitable for operation with rechargeable batteries<br><br>• devices powered by exotic battery-types whose production were canceled can be further used<br><br>• basic operating-parameters can be kept constant during battery lifetime guaranteeing waste dumps get smaller and energy and environment are saved.

Idia College Senior School, Benin City, NIGERIA

The purpose of this project is to design a device that can detect an intruder by sensing light and then set-off an alarm, that could also be transmitted on radio frequency. The light meter and burglary alarm was assembled from parts taken from unserviceable radio and television sets. Materials used include capacitors, resistors, transistors, integrated circuits (I.C), light emitting diodes (LED), light dependent resistor (LDR), vero-board, antenna, tape mechanism, cassette and speaker. The circuits are built on a vero-boards which has series of holes containing an electrical contact. Holes in the same column are electrically connected. Integrated circuits used in this project are inserted so that they span the gap in the board, so that the pins from the two rows would be connected together (short circuited). The circuit is connected to the power supply through the two single holes at the top and bottom of the board (power buses). When light is shown on the device, it generates an electrical pulse which set-off an alarm that is both audible in the immediate surrounding and is also transmitted on radio frequencies. The device is battery operated (DC) it could also be configured to use electric current (AC). Design and build a light sensitive burglary alarm.

The purpose of this project is to eliminate the problem of frequent power outage in homes and calling centers that requires constant voltage source between 3 and 10 volts d.c. for the mobile phones and appliances. In Nigeria the problem of constant power failure as made communication using mobile and wireless phones very difficult due to the fact their batteries run out after excessive usage and needs to be recharged for continuity. These prompt me to research and design the multipurpose uninterrupted power supply device which will play a great roll in solving this problem.<br><br>The device was assembled using a step down transformer of 220V/20V, voltage regulator was used to step down the d.c. voltage from 20volt to the required charging voltage of various handsets, resistors were further used to reduce the output current at different terminals to produce the required charging current.<br><br>The device was able to meet the needed requirement of operating on a very low a.c Supply voltage and still gives out a stabilize output voltage. It was able to charge five different kinds of handsets at the same time including a transistor radio and it was able to provide output a.c voltage for one month.<br><br>Intermediate power storage is required to make use of the device practical for this type of application.

BOATS: WHAT A DRAG
Luke Ferris Gridley
Huntingtown High School, Huntingtown, MD

The purpose of this experiment is to determine the relationship between an applied force and the speed of a boat. The faster a boat moves through water, the greater the resistive forces. As speed increases, the force needed to maintain speed will be directly proportional to the speed of the boat squared.<br><br> The line drawings of a US Navy Gearing class destroyer were used to create a computer model. The computer model was then used to generate a model boat using a 3D Printer. Once the model was completed a test tank was built. A pulley system consisting of a towing pulley and a counter balance was set up to the test tank and model. A Photogate, which was attached to one of the pulleys, measured the distance and time. To vary the force applied to the model, increments of 0.10 grams were added to the towing pulley and multiple trials were measured.<br><br> The resulting slope of the position versus time graph for each run was taken when the slope was constant. The slopes, which are speed, were then used to generate a force versus speed graph which confirmed the hypothesis that force is proportional to the square of the speed. The proportionality constant between force and speed was calculated from the force versus speed squared graph. The calculated speed was used to generate a force versus speed/length ratio graph which compared reasonably to the Navy’s results for the Gearing class destroyer.

CAN BRIDGE DISASTERS BE EASILY AVOIDED? NO!
Chelsea Ann Arthur
New Prairie High School, New Carlisle, IN

The purpose of this project was to prove that there is no specific time during which maintenance to a bridge should be done. The collapse of the I-35W bridge in Minneapolis, MN could not have been prevented if the maintenance had been properly timed. There is no specific time during the week when bridge strain and traffic are at a very low point. The middle of the week showed lower strain damage than the weekend. There were some hours that showed more strain than others, such as the late evening and early morning hours for the week. There are also factors that have to be taken into account, such as temperature changes. The change in temperature creates great strain on the bridge, but this occurs in one large cycle throughout the day between sunrise and sunset. By analyzing the data received from the Eufaula Bridge in Oklahoma City, OK, conclusions can be made. The I-35W bridge collapse could not have been prevented. There is no specific time during which the bridge should, or should not have been, constructed upon.

USING GENERATORS IN PLACE OF BRAKES ON WIND TURBINES
Thomas Judd Cook
Carbon High School, Price, UT

Wind Turbines produce “green” energy making them far more environmentally friendly energy sources than fossil fuels. However wind turbines have a braking system that engages at high wind speed to keep the windmill from spinning to fast and tearing itself apart. This is a waste of energy. In this project, a second generator replaces the typically used braking system. This second generator slows the wind turbine and in the process creates more energy instead of loosing it in the form of heat. A paddle system was devised to automatically engage the second generator at a pre set wind speed. This allows for capture of otherwise wasted wind turbine energy. At low speeds, this modified wind turbine produces slightly less energy due to friction. However, as the wind speed increases, this slight loss is recovered and additional energy is generated.

OPTIMIZING A CUPROUS OXIDE SOLAR CELL
Taylor Layne Leger
Batesville Junior High School, Batesville, AR

The purpose of the experiment is to find what material produces the most electric voltage in a cuprous oxide solar cell.<br><br>I purchased copper sheeting and cut it into two squares, ten centimeters across. They were then cleaned and buffed thoroughly to remove any coating. One square (the other square will be used as elemental copper later on in experimentation) was placed on a stovetop burner to create a thick, black layer of cupric oxide, after being cooked on high for about half an hour. A cuprous oxide layer is underneath the cupric oxide layer. Once the squares cool, the cupric oxide began to flake off, leaving the semi-conducting cuprous oxide material. Using a glass jar, alligator clips, wire, a multimeter, a salt-water solution, and various metals, I created a solar cell. The cuprous oxide is always the electron donor while the other metal is a conductor, which creates a closed circuit when attached to the multimeter. I used the multimeter to determine the potential difference being created across the solar cell.<br><br>Copper created 102 millivolts. Aluminum created 557 millivolts. Zinc electroplated steel created 839 millivolts. Iron created 324 millivolts. Carbon created a reverse current with 350 millivolts.<br><br>Therefore, zinc electroplated steel created the most voltage in a cuprous oxide solar cell, followed by aluminum, iron, copper, and carbon.<br><br>Since the amperage created by this solar cell was not detectable by the multimeter, a follow-up experiment would be to measure the microvoltage and determine the power created in the cell.

WHY DROP THE FUN WHEN THE DRIP IS ON?
Tobias Maduro Noerbo
Ishoj Technical High School - CPH West, Ishoj, DENMARK

161,000 children will get cancer in 2008 – 70 % of these children will suffer from a severe physical and/or mental side effect from their disease. This can result in symptoms such as local venous toxicity, fatigue, regression and mood disturbance. <br><br>One of the most effective treatments against side effects is exercise and mobile activity - especially while treated, but 130,000 of cancer children have no choice they must use a drip stand which severely limits their physical possibilities. <br><br>To help these children, I developed a set of special bikes: the DripDrop series. So now a mild form of exercise could be a normal part of the children’s stay at the hospital ward – also during chemotherapy. These prototypes have been tested at a children's cancer ward. <br><br>To optimize the DripDrops, I have:<br><br>• determined how to prevent the structure from over bending.<br><br>• minimized the risk of overturning<br><br>• reduced the power needed to ride the DripDrop<br><br>• developed 3D prints from CAD drawings<br><br>• used a CNC machine to ensure accuracy of prototypes<br><br>One of the most important features with my DripDrop-system is the fastening mechanism that connects the drip stand with the DripDrop in a safe and user-friendly way. This fastener system can also be used for many other applications such as improved pipe-clamps of pipes in any dimension, mast-steps for yachting, bicycle-trailer-mounting-systems and different applications in the rehab industry.

WHAT A MES: MARS ENVIRONMENT SIMULATOR, II
Julie Emily Walker
Leonardtown High School, Leonardtown, MD

My project is to engineer a safe Martian Environment Simulator (MES) that is small enough to be portable, price effective, accurate and reliable enough to be used to test materials for Mars exploration or test physical or environmental properties of Mars itself. This year's work will: refine the requirements, perform design tradeoffs, refine the wind subsystem, and completion of the solar and power subsystems. The requirements I developed for my MES, were made considering its future uses by an engineer or a scientist. Requirements for my MES are: that all equipment and materials must meet safety requirements, simulate Martian environment with respect to atmosphere composition, temperature, wind speed, air pressure and solar radiation. In order to finish the final detailed design of the MES, I tested alternate designs for the access panel, window, solar subsystem, and power inputs. From these tests I made detailed engineering drawings, which I then used to make a plywood mock-up of MES chamber. I used the mock-up chamber to test the solar, wind, and power subsystems along with other environmental variables such as walnut grit as a possible simulation of Martian sand. I used the integration into the mock-up to test compliance of some of my system requirements. I also used the engineering drawings to get the chamber welded out of quarter inch steel plate. I will integrate the solar and power subsystems into the steel chamber next year.

THE PIEZOELECTRIC FLOOR: ELECTRICAL ENERGY WHEN WE WALK
Matthew Charles Godkin
De La Salle High School, Concord, CA

I tried to create a floor that harnessed the mechanical energy released when we walk. I thought that I could do this by putting piezoelectric elements in the floor that would be compressed and create electricity when the floor was stepped on. I tested several different designs by applying about 29 newtons of force, the same as one of my steps. I tried to make my own piezoelectric Rochelle salt crystals by growing them. I also used piezo disks and used them to make a small floor sample. I then tested using several different pads to test on these piezo disks to maximize power output. The Rochelle salt crystal peak was 27 microwatts. The piezo disks created more than that. The best design, which had cork pads underneath the piezo disks and rubber eraser on top, generated 70 microwatts. If I were to implement this design on a larger scale, it would never pay for itself in power generated. However, I have shown that it can be done, and that with a better design it could be made to work.

B.I.P.E.D.: THE NOVEL MINIATURE BIPEDAL ROBOT
Kelson Akio Lau
Waiakea High School, Hilo, HI

The purpose of this project was to construct an eight cubic inch bipedal robot that would be mobilized through eight degrees of freedom. This added movement compared to Japanese robots that have four degrees of freedom will allow the robot to take a larger step and increase the rate of motion. In order to support the robot during walking, larger feet will be constructed to account for the distribution of weight over a large area. <br><br> <br><br>In order to create movement in the robot, eight Blue Arrow 2.5 TS servos were used. Limbs were constructed out of machined aluminum which connected the servos together. Because of the limited space to mount components, batteries were used as structural members. The feet were made out of thin plastic cards and flexible wire was used to connect the batteries, circuit boards, and servos together. The robot was named, Bipedal Interface Programmable Eight-Cubic Inch Droid (BIPED).<br><br> <br><br>The robot, BIPED, was successful in achieving the goal of this project. The length of step was measured at two inches, with a step speed of one second per step.

Heat-removal is critical to the performance of computers.<br><br>I have developed an evaporative, water-based, cooling solution for computers. Traditionally air cooled heat sinks are bundled with the chips, which are very ineffective for ambient temperatures above 38°C. My cooling solution is basically for the processor but can be extended to other parts also. I have used water as the coolant as it is easily available, has high heat capacity and latent heat of evaporation.<br><br>The air cooled heat sink (of Intel’s PGA-478 and LGA-775 socket) has been modified and converted into water blocks which can circulate water over the processor without damaging it, as it is water sealed.<br><br>The cooling system has two parts-<br><br>1. The pumping chamber contains a washer pump. The pumping chamber is the water reservoir for the device. There is also a water level indicator circuit in pumping chamber.<br><br>2.

THE UNDERGROUND RADIO
Alexander Kent Kendrick
Los Alamos High School, Los Alamos, NM

The purpose of this experiment was to build and test a low frequency cave radio that will work through the ground. The purpose was also to see at what maximum depth the radio will operate. Through-the-ground radios are based on magnetic inductive coupling which is very different than normal radios. To do this, build a low frequency transceiver. When the radio is complete, make a loop antenna using PVC pipe and copper wire. Add a capacitor network circuit in order to resonate and tune the antenna to the radio. Test the radio in an open field to get the maximum surface range and test it in a cave to get a maximum depth. Calculate the depth of the cave by surveying the cave and surface. Establish communication between the surface and underground radios at several locations and record the depth of those locations. The maximum underground depth for this radio turned out to be 90 meters (295 feet) which is good. My hypothesis was supported; the radio was able to communicate at more than 25 meters underground which is a major accomplishment. In order to go deeper, the following ideas need to be tested: lower frequency, increased current and various antenna designs. Low frequency underground radios have many important applications, such as: cave rescues, mine rescues, cave surveying by radiolocation, coal detection (mining), and submarine communication.

ROLL UP FOR EASY ACCESS: A DESIGN EVOLUTION OF P.E.A.R.L.
Nicolette Isabel Quesada
Rio Rancho High School, Rio Rancho, NM

The purpose of this project was to provide a means of lifting and storing an empty wheelchair into the back of a small truck or van for wheelchair users or caregivers with limited mobility or physical strength. The goal is for a system that is affordable, easy to operate, and compatible with the majority of wheelchairs available on the market. The basic concept for PEARL (Powered Electric Automotive Ramp Lift) was a ramp that moved from an extended, lowered position into a raised, retracted position. During the design phase, the concept evolved through research, brainstorming sessions, and discussions into a series of drafts of the design. The final draft was reviewed and revised before beginning construction. In the course of construction, further alterations were made before testing began. Although the initial test was unsuccessful, it produced identifiable improvements for the following set of tests. After making minor corrections, the system ran successfully on a test stand and mounted into a vehicle. At the conclusion of testing, PEARL had achieved the objectives. Total costs for the prototype were less than similar items in the market. The unit runs with electric motors and requires very little physical effort. It requires one time installation but does not require additional assembly for each use. The dimensions for the system accommodate different wheelchair sizes, weights, and the footrest attachments, and it fits in small SUVs or pickups. The follow-on work for this project will reduce its size and prepare the unit for production.

CAPTURE THE WIND
Nathan Daniel Seal
Hahnville High School, Boutte, LA

The fossil fuels are being used up and are becoming extremely expensive. There are several renewable resources that have been developed in the world. Wind Energy is one of those renewable resources. The thought of wind, which everybody feels every single day, being a source of energy is mind blowing. I find it awesome that something like wind can be used to produce electricity. I did this project so that I can learn about windmills and how they work. Specifically how the blades affect the amount of volts produced by the windmill. It is experiments like these that can change the way everybody spends their money. Instead of spending their money on energy they could spend their money on other things that they want. Starting this experiment I expected a 6° angle to do better than the 12° angle. I used washers to change the angle: 3 washers for a 0° angle, 5 washers for a 6° angle, and 7 washers for a 12° angle. Once the angles were changed I used a leaf blower to produce the wind. It turned out that the 12° blade angle produces the most volts. Even though the 12° angle produces the most volts, the 6° angle produces almost the same amount. The real find in this experiment was that a blade that is at a 0° angle does not produce many volts but as soon as the angle is increased to 6° and 12° the windmill produces about the same amount of volts.

WATER SAVING SYSTEM WITH DOMOTIC TECHNOLOGY
Jorge Oswaldo Gomez
Tecnologico de Monterrey Campus Guadalajara, Zapopan, Jalisco, MEXICO

Water supply around the world is expected to decrease in one third in the next twenty years. In Mexico and other parts of the world people wait until the hot water runs out of the shower head which generates a waste of water. This project is about a water saving system that could be installed in most bathroom showers saving 15 liters per user, which represents an estimated of 25 thousand liters of water per family every year. <br><br>The first step done was to establish the design criteria based on sustainable development, security and cost. Then, existing water saving technology was looked into in order to find their weaknesses. Also, after selecting the best design, the material and the equipment for the prototype was selected. In order to make the system domotic, a PIC microcontroller was programmed in C code, which controls the prototype’s solenoid valves that open and close depending on the programmed temperature; if the water is cold it deviates the water to the cistern. Once the temperature has been reached the system allows the hot water to come out of the shower. The prototype has a power of 16.4 Watts, or 4 Watt/hour.<br><br>Early calculations estimated that if the system is used by 50% of the population of Guadalajara then it would save 12 million cubic meters of water per year. The project is technologically and economically affordable making it accessible to any developing countries’ market; therefore it could have a significant impact on water conservation.<br><br> <br><br>

PERSONAL AUTOMATED ETHANOL FERMENTER AND DISTILLER
Eric Ernest Hodnefield, Devin Bezdicek, 
Jackson County Central High School, Jackson, MN

Ethanol may eventually become our main source of alternative fuel. Our engineering goal was to create an apparatus that would be able to ferment and distill ethanol for personal use. This apparatus goes through the entire process with little human involvement. The ethanol machine contains a system of copper tubes, metal pots, electric valves, a pump, a microprocessor, and other electrical components. One of the pots is used for fermentation and the other pot is used for distillation. All electrical devices are connected to the microprocessor. The microprocessor is programmed by a computer to turn on the electrical valves and pump when needed to transport liquid between the pots, and to supply our cooling system with water. Temperature probes and water sensors are installed in the two pots to monitor the water temperature and the water level. The data from the probes and sensors are fed through the microcontroller which uses the data to determine when to turn on the various electrical devices. Cracked corn, enzymes, yeast, and water are used in the fermentation process. After fermentation is done, the liquid is moved to the distilling pot where it is heated. The steam then rises through the copper tubes and eventually is cooled down by the condenser. After testing the apparatus, we successfully produced ethanol. The ethanol making process is actually a simple process. By adding many electrical components to our setup, we were able to make the process even simpler for home use.

Each year, over 100,000 young engineers work against the clock to design robots to complete several complex challenges in 2.5 minutes in the FLL Robotic Competition. Since all competitors must use specified equipment and are given the same amount of development time, we wanted to gain a competitive advantage by designing an extremely efficient robot. Our strategy was to implement "generic" software and modular robotic component features to create efficiency. <br><br> <br><br>Our design goals were to develop generic software to run the robot, leverage the use of the motors for increased functionality, and create an efficient method of attaching manipulators to our robot. <br><br> <br><br>We successfully engineered the following features that made our robot efficient: <br><br> <br><br>1. Using "outside of the box" thinking, we developed a unique generic robotic software program which allowed us to execute programs rapidly, maximize memory space on the robot's mini-computer, and significantly decrease software downloading time. <br><br> <br><br>2. Restricted to the use of three motors, we created a movable drive train designed to leverage the functionality of the motors. <br><br> <br><br>3. While competing, our robot quickly slid into our engineered bases which allowed the robot to manipulate objects to score points on the competition table. Our modular robotic manipulators enabled us to complete the missions within 2.5 minutes. <br><br> <br><br>We used comparative analysis to validate the efficiency of our design. Using uniquely developed designs for a robot that features generic programming, leveraged motor capability, and modular robotic manipulators, we made our robot spectacular in a generic way.

In Britain alone there are 4,500 deaths and 78,000 injuries from motorcycles each year. Many of these are the result of not wearing or incorrectly wearing a helmet. This project aims to create a full-size model ATV (all-terrain vehicle) helmet that can have universal use. The helmet will require fitting a wireless sensor that will detect if the ATV user is wearing it correctly. The bike and helmet technology will be integrated so that the bike will be immobilised unless the device is worn. The design will be such that it will be tamper-proof from the operator or any other person. Additional desirable features would incorporate anti-theft capabilities as well as activation of a cut-off mechanism on the bike in the event of the rider being dislodged.<br><br>Several prototypes were developed which included the incorporation of Infra-red, Bluetooth, radio wave and ultrasonic technology. After extensive trialling it was decided to utilise an ultrasonic transmitter/receiver combination. This arrangement proved to be the most effective, reliable and durable solution. It also provided least health risk to the operator in terms of proximity to the brain. The inclusion of the ultrasonic technology necessitated location of the transmission circuit between the inner and outer shell of the helmet without compromising either the strength of the signal or the impact-absorbent capabilities of the foam lining.<br><br>In the event of there being no equivalent devices currently on the market, this product offers multiple applications and significant commercial potential use in the work and leisure environments.

ENGINEERING A MODULAR INFRARED TRACKING SENSOR FOR USE WITH THE FOSTER-MILLER TALON, A MAN-PORTABLE RECONNAISSANCE ROBOT
Jonathan Michael Rodriguez, Matthew Hobart Fairbank, 
Keystone School, San Antonio, TX

The engineering goal of this project was to develop a system of two robots that can scan an area and use attached thermal sensors to detect the location of humans within the scanned area. Two pan and tilt systems were assembled from kits, incorporating Hitec-brand servos together with Pololu microcontrollers. The printed circuit boards with infrared sensors were removed from two game recovery devices manufactured by Game Finder, Inc. The circuit boards were modified to reduce weight, and then wired to the parallel port inputs of two desktop computers. The final stage of assembly was to attach the printed circuit boards to the pan and tilt systems. The researchers wrote a program using Microsoft Visual Basic which sweeps the sensor from one side to another, scanning for heat signatures. The program was designed to be executed simultaneously on two networked computers, and exchange data between the two robots working in tandem.<br><br> The researchers tested the robots inside of a high school gymnasium. The robots were placed at the left and right sides of the baseline of the basketball court. Six trials were conducted, with the robots searching for a human subject who stood in a different location for each trial. In conclusion, with a p value of 6x10-13, the statistically significant data proved that robots detected the location of the person standing on the court. With this proof of concept, the system would have practical applications for military and civilian use with further development.

TESLA COIL

McCurdy High School, Espanola, NM

Our project’s goal is to produce wireless electricity with electromagnetic fields emitted from a Tesla Coil which will light a fluorescent bulb. We believe that the electromagnetic energy within the fields will create wireless electricity causing the fluorescent light bulb to be lit. To test our hypothesis we constructed a Tesla Coil. We produced a secondary coil made out of a PVC pipe and 28 gauge wire. We constructed a flat primary coil made out of copper tubing. A capacitor bank was assembled which consists of 24 capacitors placed in parallel series. A circuit board was used as a safety device for the capacitor bank. A spark gap made out of two tungsten rods that were set apart 1.4 inches, was used to create a burst of electricity. A transformer stepped the electricity up from 110 volts to 12,000 volts creating the amount of energy needed to operate the device; it also converted the current from AC to DC. We wired the transformer to the circuit board which was connected to the capacitors. Once all the capacitors were filled, the energy was sent to the spark gap, which then traveled through the primary coil and to the secondary coil. We tuned our Tesla Coil so the primary coil and secondary coil had the same resonant frequency. As a result of our testing we discovered that electromagnetic fields produce wireless electricity. We concluded that our Tesla Coil which we designed and constructed did not function properly due to tuning issues.

TREBUCHET VS. ONAGER
Kyle Robert Latham, Jimmy Burnett, Benjamin Click
Westminster Christian Academy, Huntsville, AL

The purpose of this experiment was to test two catapults of different designs to see which would launch a projectile the furthest distance. Based on the laws of physics, one catapult seemed to have a greater advantage over the other. And in light of this, our hypothesis was that the trebuchet catapult would launch a projectile farther than an onager could.<br><br> The two types of catapults chosen were the onager catapult and the trebuchet catapult. The onager, a catapult first designed and used by the ancient Romans, uses the power of twisted ropes to propel the throwing arm forward and launch the projectile. The trebuchet, however, functions with the use of a counterweight and gravity. A large amount of weight is placed on one end of the throwing arm, and the projectile is placed on the other. When the weight swings downward, the opposite end of the throwing arm rotates upward and propels the projectile. And due to the longer length of its throwing arm, the trebuchet is able to exert a greater velocity on its projectile than the onager. This advantage was the basis of our hypothesis: that the trebuchet could launch a projectile farther than an onager. <br><br> The projectile, a block of wood, was launched fifty times with each catapult. The trebuchet was less consistent with its throws, but it threw further. It averaged 29 meters. The onager, although more consistent, only averaged 9 meters.<br><br> In the end, we proved our hypothesis correct. However, although the onager did lose the distance competition, it was much easier to load and reset than the trebuchet. It was also more consistent and accurate. Since the basis of the experiment was distance, however, the trebuchet was the victor.

PUTTING PERFECTION
Justin Daniel Vail, Michael Newton, 
Macomb Mathematics and Science and Technology Center, Warren, MI

The purpose of the experiment is to determine the effect different styles of putters have on the path a golf ball takes. The putters used in the experiment were a mallet putter, a blade putter and a peripherally weighted putter. To determine their precision, each putter was hit from the sweet spot, the toe and the heel using a putting machine for uniformity. The results of the experiment showed that when the ball was hit off the toe of the putter, the variance in the degrees of the angle increased, while the precision of the putt decreased. Overall the mallet putter seemed to have the most discrepancy among putts on all points of contact along the putter face.

“Hunt for Ghost Harmonics” is a scientific attempt to detect the timbre difference in violins. An instrumentation package was engineered to accomplish precise analog filter analysis and digital examination. Quantitative analysis was made of violin recordings, to examine the fundamental, harmonic and other possible “ghost” harmonic frequencies.<br><br>To obtain the sounds from the violins, a master fiddler played the open notes, followed by a melody, on four violins of differing quality. A panel of judges, with varied musical backgrounds, subjectively determined that the sound was different in the four violins. Preference was shown for two of the four violins.<br><br>The recordings were fed into software, which provided a digital, 1/24 per octave, real time spectrum analysis. Printouts of the frequencies and decibel levels were compared using a light box. Large variances in decibels and small variances in frequencies were observed. <br><br>To more closely examine frequency and amplitude, two 1/3 and two 1/1 octave filters were cascaded to provide 70 db isolation of a narrow band of harmonics. The recordings were fed through this filter into the 1/24 spectrum analyzer and the results compared. Again, there were some variations noted between violins but nothing to definitively say; this is the “ghost” we’ve been looking for.<br><br> Determining whether the variances found are contributing to the violin being pleasant or not may be beyond the parameters of this study.<br><br>The usefulness of filter and digital analysis in studying harmonics was demonstrated. This study may help in a future understanding of timbre.

Fundacao Escola Tecnica Liberato Salzano Vieira da Cunha, Novo Hamburgo, Rio Grande do Sul, BRASIL

The Project TRANSLINE - Remote Monitor System of Low-Voltage Power Network Distribution – consists of a study and the development of a remote monitor system (at a distance) in real time of secondary network (low-voltage) of electric power distribution witch aims at helping the power station companies to supervise its transformation points and, thus, making it easier for the concessionaries to reach their goals related to the quality of energy supply established by the Brazilian Electric Energy Agency (Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica – ANEEL) and offering a trustful supervision method for the institution, something innovative and inexistent in the country nowadays.<br><br> The demand for electric energy has been growing year by year since practically all the sectors of society need it for their operation and development. The demands for quality in energy supply have also increased, although the lack of a monitor system in the distribution circuits brings disruptions both for the concessionaries such as complaints and fines, and to their clients, who suffer heavily with the energy supply interruptions. That is why the creation of an integrated system which supervises the nets and signals of informs the center about the state of theirs secondary transformers is relevant.<br><br> This project has the objective of evaluating the creation of a monitoring method of low-voltage electric network through theoretical and practical studies, considering that the concessionaries lack this system nowadays. Therefore, the TRANSLINE project searches to present a way of supervising distribution networks, helping both the concessionaries and ANEEL.

Hunger is still a global problem that affects a large part of the human population. Low-income families are the most affected due to their socio-economical difficulties. Residents of the Jardim Vitória neighborhood in Cuiaba, Mato Grosso, Brazil, need help to improve the community’s children, teenagers’ and adults’ health. This study may help the deployment of a production system for homemade bread to attend the daily consumption of these families. The research consisted on the study of local reality daily bread consumption and the development of a bread dough mixer based on old washing machines’ spare parts. The developed prototype was taken to the houses of some families, where on weekends, they made bread for the neighborhood community nursery. <br><br>Preliminary results are satisfactory as the equipment helped reduce the average cost of bread consumption for each family that was initially $30.45 (thirty dollars and forty-five cents) and was reduced to $14.70 (fourteen dollars and seventy cents), corresponding to 51.72% reduction of the total monthly bread cost.

21ST CENTURY MIRACLE LOCK
Tak Shing Lau, Tak Kin Lau, 
Maryknoll Fathers' School, Hong Kong, HONG KONG

Do you want to keep your home safe?<br><br> <br><br>Recently, a new cracking method called “Bump Key” is invented. No matter which pin-tumbler lock you are using (e.g. Multi Lock, Cross Key Lock), a house can be broken into by using this method in a few seconds and 85% of these burglaries are carried out by the<br><br>non-professionals, even a five years old child can easily be trained in using Bump Key.<br><br> <br><br>From the statistical information provided by the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) and the Department of Justice in U.S., nearly 70% of all break-ins occur with no sign of forced entry. It takes 10 minutes or more for the police to arrive at the crime scene. It is difficult for the police to spot, even if they were to stop-and-search a suspected burglar. In 80% of burglary cases, the stolen articles are not recovered. Hence most insurance companies will not pay compensation for burglaries that do not show visible forced entries.<br><br> <br><br>In light of this serious security problem, the “Anti-Bump Lock” is invented to combat this<br><br>“undetectable” crime. This lock uses a material that replaces brass pins inside the lock which slightly alters the mechanism in the lock opening process. The advantage of this lock is that the exterior appearance of the lock remains unchanged and its manufacturing cost is similar to an ordinary lock. <br><br> <br><br>This “Anti-Bump Lock” has passed six stringent tests, including Anti-Bump test, torsion test, shearing test, attraction test, pulling test and demagnetization test.

RADIO CONTROLLED RECONNAISSANCE: A BIRD'S EYE VIEW
Alexander Larson Wold, Jerry Farke, 
Armour High School, Armour, SD

We wanted to investigate uses of aerial photography using radio-controlled aircraft instead of full-size aircraft. The inspiration was the US Air Force’s Global Hawk, an unmanned surveillance plane currently employed in Iraq and Afghanistan. We started with an off-the-shelf kit for a radio-controlled airplane. After building the model, we modified it in order to accommodate a digital camera and a live video transmitter. Once the center of gravity of our craft was established we began recording video and taking pictures over interesting sites. Our still images and video allowed us to identify: animal prints, tire tracks, vegetation, water distribution in wetlands, and speeds of vehicles. Every test flight was successful. The plane was capable of recording and transmitting clear images from altitudes in excess of 100 meters. We are confident that this plane would also perform well in commercial applications. Examples are scouting hotspots in forest fires or surveying areas where large aircraft are impractical or unable to fly. We are currently investigating other surveillance possibilities where our model plane might outperform satellites or commercial aircraft.

MOTION CHARACTERIZATION OF WHEELED ROBOTS ON VARIOUS TERRAINS: WITH APPLICATIONS TO SIMULTANEOUS LOCALIZATION AND MAPPING
Gregory Robins, Oliver Donson, 
Ossining High School, Ossining, NY

Robots need to be able to traverse a variety of terrains to perform tasks such as search and rescue. Terrain type is the main cause of motion error. Therefore, predicting motion accurately on a diverse collection of terrains is a challenging problem. This study, empirically characterized the motion of a small all-terrain robot moving on a selection of terrains, and demonstrated that this characterization yields effective motion prediction. <br><br> Through a series of empirical measurements, the motion error was characterized on eight different terrains: carpet, woodland, mud, asphalt, grass, sand and gravel. The robot was placed on each terrain and commanded to execute a sequence of motions. Accurate measurements of the initial and final predicted locations and actual positions were recorded. The positions included x (side to side) and y (forward/back) coordinates of the center of the robot on the ground plane and theta (angular) displacement of the robot off the principle axis. Discrete probability distributions were constructed by accumulating the error measurements for each class of terrain. The performance of the robot was evaluated as it exploited the appropriate distribution moving from one terrain type to another. <br><br> On all terrains, the recorded errors in y values were consistently negative. The carpet terrain provided the least amount of motion error while mud terrain caused more tumultuous data. When applied to mapping these localization inaccuracies produce erroneous representations of environments. The evaluation demonstrated that the robot platform was more accurate in predicting its motion when using our terrain-based probability models. This research is an important step toward allowing autonomous robot technology to be leveraged in urban disaster recovery.

Carlsbad High School, Carlsbad, NM

We have designed a device that takes photonic kinetic energy converts it into thermal transpiration, which creates mechanical motion, which can create electrical conduction. We hypothesize that we can generate electrical alternating current with this device.<br><br> Our project utilized; balsa wood, acrylic spray paint (black and white), test tube, glue, Plexiglas, silicone, rubber stop, non magnetic metal rod, circular wood base, small gauge wood rods, magnetic copper wire, mirrors, binding wire, and neodymium magnets. All materials with exception to the Plexiglas were household items.<br><br> We constructed a radiometer out of balsa wood, a test tube, a non-magnetic rod, a wooden base, and a Plexiglas box (vacuum). We then integrated a generator, by adding magnets out of a hard drive to the bottom area of the test tube, and surrounding the magnets with conducting wire that extends beyond the box so as to allow us to measure the amount of electricity by a galvanometer.<br><br> We used the same galvanometer, and Plexiglas box for all experiments to maintain a control. The variables included the amounts of conductive wire, and mirrors used to intensify light. We found that our generator did produce small amounts of electricity.

ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION OF A TELEPRESENCE AMUSEMENT PARK RIDE
Larry James Russell, Jordan Blyther, Baichard Donald
W J Keenan High School, Columbia, SC

An amusement park ride will be created that does not have the danger present of ‘people carrying’ rides. Constructing a telepresence amusement park ride will allow the rider to be safely separate from the ride mechanism. Telepresence is defined as that which makes remote or distant people appear or feel present and part of the local activity by using telematics technology. Since the ride mechanism will only have to support the sensory equipment, the ability to construct the ride is greatly increased, and the risk to the rider is dramatically reduced. A Balloon Simulation Ride will be constructed. This ride will have an interactive camera, which will respond to the motion of the head mounted display of the rider. Using wired technology, work on the algorithms will be carried out without concern about how data is transmitted or received. The procedures used to develop this ride will be to build on existing technology such as STAMP modules, digital compass, accelerometer, and an existing head mounted display. Using sample programs provided with the STAMP module, modifications would be made. The quality of the ride will be determined by a rider satisfaction survey. It is believed that this will be a viable technology.

The purpose of Humanoid robots in society cannot possibly be summarized into one category. While Hollywood has seemed to have created the idea that robots' purpose will be to ultimately take over the world, some real life applications of humanoid robotics are:<br><br>-Prosthetics -Inspection of Dangerous Environments (walking robots better capable of walking on unstable terrain vs. wheeled robots)<br><br>-Entertainment -Human Job Assistance -Luxury Butlers<br><br> It was our goal to create a strong bipedal structure with animation similar to a human while still retaining a low budget, compared to similar bipedal robots currently under development. <br><br> Environment adaptable functions have been added to make our robot more versatile then last year's project (2006-2007 “X-Species”). Features include an object analyzer, touch recognition, sound detectors and balance sensors.<br><br> More intuitive engineering skills have been applied to create a sound structure. Using 3D blueprints allowed us to design complicated ball joint systems, analyze proportions, and permitted additional research before construction had begun.<br><br> Function abilities were performed by guidelines included on research plan which directed us to scientifically test the completion of our engineering goal.<br><br> We have greatly improved the design and function of project X-Species. This fully functional biped apparatus is adaptable enough to be used in many different realistic applications, while still being affordable to target consumers. The new inventive joint systems and original structure design is our largest accomplishment. Further study in programming capabilities will have to be performed to observe full potential of project “VSR-1 Talos”.

SEEING THE LIGHT, COMBATING SCINTILLATION
James David Carter, Janet Josten, 
Lake Braddock Secondary School, Burke, VA

This experiment tests the concept of the transmission of data through the <br><br>atmosphere using coherent visible electromagnetic (EM) radiation from 650 nm <br><br>lasers with the goal being to advance data transmission techniques using visible <br><br>light. To complete the experiment three lasers (650nm) are spaced so that the <br><br>signal fade due to scintillation, i.e. interference of EM radiation due to <br><br>changes in air density, differs between each of the lasers. At the receiver each <br><br>signal level is added together using superposition of waves, thus producing a <br><br>more constant signal that leads to an increased data rate. The resulting signal <br><br>is analyzed in terms of signal to noise ratio and the deepness of fading. The <br><br>same concept can also be applied in reverse with multiple receivers if the <br><br>signal from the receivers is combined with the same phase delay; this error <br><br>would otherwise limit effective bandwidth. The transmitter and receiver are <br><br>separated by approximately half a kilometer, which leads to scintillation of the <br><br>lasers. Two more lasers are then added in succession and results are analyzed. <br><br>The results of this experiment can be applied between long distance <br><br>communication, similar to that which government agencies wish to achieve between <br><br>its satellites (possibly orbiting other planets or stars), and ground stations, <br><br>thus increasing data transmission rates.

The objective of the project was to design and build an electronic alternative to the human arm, hand, and the therapeutic applications for amputees. This task was accomplished by designing and creating an original electronic arm and hand that is used to aid amputees in their strive for full mobility. The results of this study was that an electronic arm was built and is operational and remote controlled. The electronic arm can now be used as the "helping hand" amputees need. Future studies will include connecting the electrical prosthesis to the pressure points and neuromuscular junctions in existing human tissues.

THE ULTIMATE VEST: THE ENHANCEMENT OF BALLISTIC PLATE DISPERSAL OF BALLISTIC PROJECTILES
Kirby Ryan Knowles, Stanley Chu, Tyler French
Dutchtown High School, Hampton, GA

The goal of this experiment is to improve on the resistance of ballistic plates by testing different geometric shapes of aluminum plates while still keeping the ballistic plates' renowned flexibility. The variables of this experiment are three types of geometrical shapes to use as forms of ballistic plates: concave, convex, and hybrid concave-convex. The procedure for this experiment is in two phases: the Laser test, which is the test of the Helium-Neon laser reflecting off of the machined aluminum plates, and the BB pellet test which is the test of the plates in a controlled setting with a pneumatic .177 caliber BB gun.<br><br>The first test conducted was the Laser test. The laser was then engaged and was charted on the wall. This was conducted for 30 trials for each plate. The laser test showed that the hybrid concave-convex model had the least angle deviation, with an average of 24.7 degrees, while the largest average angle deviation was 42.2 degrees by the control variable. The second part of the procedure was the full scale shooting of the plates and measuring the reflection of the BB's on the control box, which is lined with foam. The BB's were fired into the box and the impact on the plate and the placement of the BB in the foam was charted. This test was conducted 15 times for each plate. The BB pellet test again showed that the hybrid concave-convex disc had the least angle deviation. In conclusion, the hypothesis was supported.

In Argentina, one of the protections normally put up in house electrical installations is aimed at keeping living beings safe from potential electrical shocks. However, once it is installed, neither is it checked for their efficiency nor serviced periodically. To overcome this situation, a device tending to improve and facilitate maintenance of the protections required in electrical installations for preventing people from electrical discharges is designed. <br><br>The problem arose after surveying 201 families from La Banda, Santiago del Estero. The surveys revealed that just 43 (21.4%) verified some time the proper operation of the differential switches by pressing the testing button while none of them (0%) checked the protective circuit. <br><br>From the beginning and as a basis for this research Project, specific technical material together with the regulations for estate electrical installations issued by the A.E.A. (Argentine Electrothecnical Association) were used. <br><br>To solve the problem, a fault-current simulator varying between 20 and 40mA was proposed. Once its prototype was designed and built, it was tested for heat dissipation by measuring temperature increase. Afterwards, tests for assessing its performance were carried out on protected electrical installations. <br><br>It is concluded that the device proposed in this Project is a friendly and very useful tool not only for technicians and engineers working in the field but also for safety specialists since it allows for a rapid and simple way to verify electrical protections at a low cost.

ELWAST: ELECTRONIC WALKING STICK WITH ULTRASONIC SENSORS FOR BLIND PEOPLE
Pedro Jose Sanabria__Montero, Natalia Maria Rodriguez_Alvarez, 
Colegio Tecnico Profecional Don Bosco, San Jose, San Jose, COSTA RICA

The aim of this Project is to design and construct an electronic walking stick for blind people that will soothe with the greatest possible effectiveness the day-to-day situations experienced by these people, mainly with objects that are positioned horizontally or at a certain height, and in this way, improve their quality of life. The decision to create an “Electronic walking stick for blind people” arose from the desire to offer one more solution for the mobility problems that disabled people encounter, particularly blind people.<br><br>Tiflotechnology is the adjustment and accessibility of information and communication technologies for use by visually impaired and blind people. Our project involves all of the aforementioned characteristics, therefore, it is tiflotechnological. Likewise, we are aware of the importance that developing this type of projects should have in society in order to improve the quality of life of disabled people, in our specific case, visually impaired people. <br><br>We used the principle of electronic distance measurement to develop this project. If the distance between the user and an object is measured, the person’s contact with it can be prevented through a vibration, providing the user greater security while he or she moves about. The ELWAST basically warns the person through a vibration in the handle of the walking stick when there is an object in the person’s path or if the object is at head level, as these are the main causes of accidents for this sector of the population. One of the key resources in our project is sound, directly focused on ultrasonic sound, which we will use as the basis to establish the distance from the objects. <br><br>In our case, we will use devices (transducers) that generate and receive an ultrasonic signal. In other words, the signal is emitted and received by the same transducers. The designs of the walking sticks require the blind person to move the stick in a straight line due to the emission angle of the transducers; therefore, the arched movement traditionally used with the white walking stick is eliminated.

Pipe Saving Bot (P.S.B.) is an alternative unmanned solution to inspect, repair and operate offshore and underwater valves and pipes, replacing the traditional SAT diving methods.<br><br>PSB uses programmable micro-controller (Parallax or NXT) and eight servo motors assembled to allow PSB to clamp around pipes and climb upward and downward as desired by the operation. The experimental model of PSB used galvanized steel to protect device under water. <br><br>The operation of PSB starts by installing it on top of defected pipes with pre-programmed instructions for PSB to climb downward until reaching controlling valves. The PSB then identifies the valve handle and isolates the pipe by turning the valve to closed position.<br><br>The current SAT diving methods used for deep under-sea pipes repairs and operations is potentially dangerous (could cause aseptic bone necrosis) and expensive. SAT diving boats equipped for 8-11 divers can cost up to USD 25,000 daily. <br><br>PSB was found to be an economical and safer alternative solution for inspecting, operating and repairing water immersed pipes and valves. PSB could also serve as mounting base for pipe advanced inspection devises designed for corrosion and thickness tests.<br><br>

NON-TACTILE SENSING FOR THEFT DETECTION APPLICATIONS
Nathaniel Wei-Sen Chen
Merlo Station High School, Beaverton, OR

The project is the result of an engineering experiment in which several non-tactile sensors were used to create systems effective in theft detection without physical contact. There are many applications that can utilize these sensors, but in the project circuits were designed and built with the intention of protecting a wallet. One of the main engineering goals was to incorporate an alarm into each circuit as to alert the object's owner if removed. Another was to keep the system both cost and space-efficient.<br><br>There are many non-tactile sensors, but the three components used were Reed switches, phototransistors, and infrared transceivers. Using these components, circuits were made, tested, and rated on the following design criteria; effectiveness, portability, cost efficiency, and range sensitivity. The Reed switch circuit design incorporated a magnet in a wallet to be sensed by the Reed switch while in the pocket. Absence of the magnet would complete the circuit and trip the buzzer. The final circuit had approximately 2.26 cm of range sensitivity. The infrared system was bulky, cost inefficient, and did not make it past the rough draft stage. The phototransistor circuit was designed to activate the buzzer upon sensing light outside of a pocket. This permitted greater range of in-pocket movement than the other systems. Both space and cost-effective, phototransistors were the best means of wallet protection. Other applications for non-tactile sensing include child protection and warehouse security.

THE GRAVITY WELL: HARNESSING ENERGY FROM CONSERVATIVE FORCE-FIELDS
Christopher John Sarabalis
F.W. Springstead High School, Spring Hill

Attempting to harness energy from conservative force-fields, the goal of this project was to test the following premise: If the energy required to manipulate the effects of a conservative field on a system is independent of the location of that system, the field can be used to do more work than done to change the state of the system. Other goals include the thermodynamic analysis of any system for which the premise applies and practical applications for power generation.<br><br>By the end of my research, three designs were created. Two test a gravitational field and one tests an electromagnetic field. These were designed in the following order: an "elastic" gravitational device, a "rigid" gravitational device, and the electromagnetic device. <br><br>A thermodynamic analysis discredited the viability of the elastic device. The output of this design increased logarithmically as height increased whereas friction increases at a far more rapid pace.<br><br>The rigid container was then designed. A thermodynamic analysis shows that energy output would increase linearly as the height of the system increased, but the constant energy cost (independent of height) was high relative to the output. This device would, therefore, be remarkably large (calculated to be at least 298 meters in an ideal environment) and difficult, if not impossible, to build. Efficiency tests were performed on a compressor in case a more optimum design was later fabricated. The efficiency was found to be a linear function of pressure, ranging from approximately 15% at atmospheric pressure and decreasing to approximately 5% at 6.3 atmospheres. Future research hinges upon optimizing the process of increasing the density the system.<br><br>Towards the end of my research the electromagnetic design was created. This device is more feasibile than the rigid gravitational device on the basis of size. Attempts to construct the device and maintain independence between the energy cost for charging the system and the system's position relative to the field have remained fruitless but not unproductive.

AN INVESTIGATION INTO EXCESS ENERGY RECYCLING WITHIN A SOLAR DISTILLATION PROCESS
Jeffrey Daniel Fahland
Wrenshall Secondary School, Wrenshall, MN

This project has been about discovering new methods to increase the efficiency of a solar distillation unit. It has become apparent that there is a great amount of heat energy not being used or not being used efficiently that could be potentially useful for another process. The purpose of this project was to design, construct, and test a system that would take this excess heat energy and convert it into useful electrical or mechanical energy.<br><br> The existing polar mount and tracking devices were modified for pin point tracking and strength. Several different methods for capturing this excess energy were explored or tested. These tests included a Minto’s Wheel, a split spectrum photovoltaic system, a Stirling engine, a steam engine, modified boiler designs, auto-focusing reboiler plans, improved distillation unit designs, and use of insulation. Most of these designs went to narrowing the hypothesis, but a system utilizing a steam engine, a new distillation/boiler unit, an auto-focusing scheme, photovoltaics set-up, and insulating designs were decided upon.<br><br> Adjustments were made to the final design during the experiments in order to repair leaks, tracking, and auto-focusing breakdowns. <br><br> Tests were started on December 28th, 2008 and continued into the coldest days of the year, with mostly positive results. Adequate steam pressure could be achieved, along with greatly improved temperature stability within the fractionating column.<br><br> The final system is energy self-sustaining and is capable of simultaneous production of ethanol, steam power and photovoltaic energy, all while automatically tracking the sun and auto-focusing for temperature control.

DEVELOPMENT OF WIRE BENDING ROBOT
Jan Nezval
Stredni Odborna Skola Prumyslova a Stredni Odborne Uciliste Strojirenske, Prostejov, CZECH REPUBLIC

Powder painting firms (PPFs) use various types of hooks to hang powder-coated parts. Hooks are manufactured by bending wire. In smaller PPFs, hooks are produced manually – manual bending is laborious and inaccurate work. Larger PPFs usually order their hooks from another firm, but this is expensive with long delivery times. <br><br>For these reasons, I have decided to construct a robot that is fed with straight or slightly deformed wire from one side, and produces pre-programmed shapes at the other. This device was designed with the aim of easing the job of PPFs as very productive, efficient and easy to control with minimal human intervention. Additionally, it incorporates the ability to quickly change the shape of hook as required by customers. <br><br>The unique point of this robot is it’s relatively small dimensions and it’s specific design for the needs of PPFs. Designs of simple shapes of hooks are programmed directly into the robot but for more complicated shapes a development environment on PC was created. <br><br>By constructing this robot, hook production was extremely simplified and it allowed us to produce more complex shapes of hooks. We managed to save a significant amount of time - manual production of 1 hook takes approx. 31 seconds, whereas the robot makes 1 hook in 8 seconds! Actually, the robot prototype has already bent thousands of hooks.

MOTION SENSOR CONTROLS: ADVANCEMENT IN A HIGHER APPLICATION
Cole Eric Kembel
Brush High School, Brush, CO

A user interface program was created that utilizes motion sensor controls. The system was designed to be highly usable and adaptable in order to satisfy users’ preferences. Through computer programming in Microsoft Visual C#, Microsoft Robotics, Bluetooth connection, and a phidget board, the graphic user interface program was created that allowed one Wii remote (Wiimote) to control a remote control car through motion activated controls. The created graphic user interface program was adaptable for the user as it allowed one to set any direction and/or button that can be used by the Wii remote for specific controls of the car. After successful trials, the user interface program was used in a real world application of controlling the electric over hydraulic controls of a hay stacker. The system provided advantages that make controlling devices both adaptive and usable when compared to the conventional controls of systems that function solely by buttons, switches, and/or joysticks. These advantages include making the operation of the system more intuitive, less complex when learning how to use and also during use, and providing settings of which button or acceleration states were used on the Wiimote to accomplish specific tasks. The system was successful by providing user friendly controls of simple functions such as moving a remote control car forward, and of more complex functions like raising the hoist of an intricate hay stacker.

COIL GUN
David Anthony Balasa
Franklin Public High School, Franklin, NE

My Coil Gun was designed to demonstrate the ability of an electromagnetic Coil Gun to fire a projectile.<br><br>The hypothesized I could cause a projectile to launch using one coil, but that adding more wire would allow the projectile to travel farther. I further hypothesized that adding more capicitors would permit the projectile to go even farther as added capacitors would increase the flow of stored electricity through the coil. I also surmised that how far the projectile would be inserted into the coil would affect the distance it would travel. I hypothesized that the projectile would travel the farthest when the end of the projectile was placed just into the end of the coil <br><br>Once I had completed my hypothesizing step, I began to test my theories. I took charging circuits and capacitors from used disposable cameras. Assembling my needed supplies: a bulk CD case for the housing, a plastic tube for the barrel, a light switch for the firing switch, a keyed switch to provide charge to the capacitor, a diode, and a probe to measure the distance, I began my testing. I conducted three sets of tests. For the first tests, I used one capacitor and varied the amount of wire used in the coil. For my second set of testing, I changed the number of capacitors. In my third set of tests, I changed the length the projectile was inserted into the coil.

ION CANNON
Jordan Gregory Ockmond
Saint James High School, Saint James, LA

The purpose of this project is to create a device that can disperse ions into the air efficiently with relatively low voltages, and afterwards, use this device in a series of ion related experiments to get an indication of free ions in the air, cleanse air, and emit propulsion using the ions dispersed from the device. My hypotheses are that I will be able to create this device and be able to use it with effectiveness in the aforementioned ion related experiments. To conduct this experiment, I first soldered 7 copper coupler tubes into 7 holes on a PC board. I then took a second PC board with 7 holes large enough to hold a nail, and inserted 7 nails into each of the holes and soldered them into those holes. I then installed a 1k ohm resistor, an LED, a 2.1 mm power jack, and an Ion Generator onto my base PC board by soldering them in place as well. I then connected the wires coming from the Ion Generator to their appropriate connection holes and also soldered a ground wire to the base board. I then used 4 L brackets along with screws to mount my nail and copper tube boards to the base board. Using a 60 watt light bulb I got an indication of the free ions being dispersed by holding it in front of the device and counting the flashes I would see in a minute's time. I adjusted the space between the nails and the copper tubes while doing this to see what effect it would have. I then placed the device in a smelly area and ran it for 10 minutes. I took note of the smell of the air afterwards. For propulsion, I cut a propeller out of aluminum and holstered it on a nail hammered into a soda bottle for support. I unsoldered the high voltage lead from the nail board and connected it to the nail with the propeller and turned on the Ion Generator. My conclusion is that I was able to create a device that has the ability to disperse ions into the air efficiently with low voltages, and I was able to use it with effectiveness in the ion related experiments. I concluded that more ions are free in the air when the nails are closer the the ends of the tubes, that ions can be used to cleanse air, and that they can be used for propulsion.

ENERGY FROM THE WIND, PART FOUR
Lia Garza

Does making a homemade vertical wind powered generator work just as good as a homemade horizontal wind generator? The Purpose of conducting this project is to create energy using a homemade vertical wind powered generator. While the generator produces energy it will be regulating the amount of energy to power a homemade LED flashlight.<br><br> In using this homemade vertical wind powered generator design I believe that I can create 15 to 35 volts of electricity while regulating the power from 5 to 20 volts. I also believe that I can power a homemade LED flashlight from the energy produced from the generator. <br><br> To start this project you will first need to gather the materials. Part one the frame. Draw two 12 inch (in diameter) circles. Part two make the glue out of plexiglass and acetone. Part three the blades. Cut three pieces of plexiglass 13 x 7 inches (careful they may shrink.) Part four and five the coils and the stator. Divide a round piece of plexiglass 11.5 inches in diameter into nine sections. Glue the coils in each section. Part six the rotor. Draw one circle of 10.5 inches in diameter with two circles where they don’t hit the coils, Glue magnets so that they repel each other. Part 7 the flashlights. Part 8; putting it all together. <br><br>I found out that the highest voltage I was able to produce was about 2 volts as of March.

PLASMA PROPULSION III
Jesse Kane Ellison
Bayfield High School, Bayfield, CO

My project improves efficiency of the Pulsed Inductive Thruster, which uses fast rising magnetic and electric fields to ionize and accelerate a fuel producing thrust. I theorized that pre-ionizing the fuel would allow for more of the energy of the magnetic field to go into accelerating the fuel. I improved upon last year’s project in many ways. I increased efficiency of the switching circuitry for my capacitor bank, reconfigured the capacitor bank for a higher voltage, and improved my charging system. I designed and built a thruster stand that uses mechanical means to amplify the force sensor signal that subsequently fixed the problem of amplifying electrical interference from my ionization source. I redesigned the thruster prototype with a larger diameter coil to achieve a larger magnetic field and new electrodes to create better ionization of the fuel. I also improved the vacuum system in many ways, including sealing and designing feed-throughs. After all of these improvements, I have achieved thrust. The plasma created can be seen moving away from the surface of the coil at the time of firing. A pulse from the force sensor has also been recorded many times. The amplitude of the pulse indicates a force of around 20 mN on average, which is exactly the force expected due to the relatively high pressure of the vacuum chamber and the low density of the fuel. My project proves that it is indeed more efficient to pre-ionize the fuel as there was absolutely no thrust without pre-ionization.

SOLAR SAIL
Steven Munn Jeanes
Bradenton Preparatory Academy, Bradenton, FL

The main problem with solar sails is the sail deployment. My question is, can I successfully design and construct and remotely deploy a solar sail prototype 10 times with out a malfunction. If I calculate the right amount of energy for the propulsion of the motor, and construct every thing to precise measurements, the solar sail should remotely deploy 10 times successfully without any malfunctions.<br><br> The way I made the solar sail was first I had to develop my own concept. For the construction that I built the body of the solar sail. Adding the roll pins, booms, attaching the Mylar, and the co2 system. Next were the body capsule and the rocket propulsion stage. The most importing part of this project is the precise measurements of the construction. The other most important thing is the fluidness of the deployment. The first test that I did was to see how much power in the propulsion of the motor I needed to deploy the solar sail. Then I did the final test and that was to deploy it 10 times successfully.<br><br>With a solar sail we can explore outer space with the photons of the sun with out any fuel. From a solar sail reaching speeds of 155,000 taking light-years off other space probes. This could be the new way we and explore space planets nebulas the sun retrieving data that we have been guesstimating at for years.

DEVICE TO FORECAST APPROACHING RAINFALLS
Xiaotian Ma
Northeast Yucai School, Shenyang, Liaoning, CHINA

The purpose of this project is to forecast rainfalls which may come in 2 hours.<br><br>Modern meteorology suggests that the negative variable of local atmospheric pressure is one of significant signals of rainfall’s approaching. I used sensors of atmospheric pressure and humidity to collect local data. Meanwhile, I recorded the time and duration of rainfalls. A computer was used to save and process those data.<br><br>To work out patterns, I made diagrams and charts with atmospheric pressure variables and rainfalls, placing them in series. Based on the diagrams, I found an approximate mathematical pattern between these two items. The detailed pattern was made out in diagrams and MCU (Micro Controller Unit) programs. The main program could work out the decrease rate of atmospheric pressure and analyze the possibility. In case of humidity lower than 80%, the chip will output signals indicating “No rainfall”. The results of computing were displayed in forms of flash and beep; three test devices have been made. <br><br>Then, I tested the devices in summer because frequent rainfalls could provide more opportunities to improve the pattern. In the test of 14 days, it forecast rainfalls with accuracy about 80%, which was considerably high.<br><br>The test indicated that the project had shortcomings in accuracy due to the time limit. Further tests will be led, which will improve the adaptability of the project. I made a tiny version that can be convenient for people with difficulties in movement such as the old and the disabled. This device has been tested and it generally achieved the engineering goal.

ULTRASONIC SENSOR MOBILITY AIDS FOR THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED
Thomas Frederick Wilkason
Mount de Sales Academy, Macon, GA

Many aids that are currently used for the visually impaired are both cumbersome to use and obstructive to other people. New kinds of aids that are hands-free and easier to use can be made with modern low power technology. Such devices are an improvement to everyone.<br><br>This project involves making a device that is worn on the wrists and uses ultrasonic sensors in conjunction with a wearable computer to identify obstructions in the path of the wearer. The device notifies the wearer of the distance to a solid surface via a vibrating motor and a buzzer that beeps when it receives a signal from the sensor. The intensity of the motor and speed of the buzzer is proportional to the distance the sensor reads. The device also utilizes an accelerometer for the user interface as well as intelligently disabling the device.<br><br>The device was tested by measuring the beam width, accuracy, and range of the sensor, the accuracy of the accelerometer, and the performance of the sensor against different surfaces. The sensor was accurate to less than 1 cm. The accelerometer was accurate to within 2 degrees. The range of the sensor is 3cm to 320 cm. The sensor performs consistently on each surface, typically only 2-3 centimeters off.<br><br>This device is easy to use for the wearer without being a nuisance to people around them. This is a novel approach to the problem because it removes many of the limitations that are caused by conventional aids.

DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPOUND ELECTRICAL GENERATOR
David Alexander Cohen
Mayo High School for Math, Science, and Technology, Darlington, SC

A novel method of power generation by combining existing methods of induction is investigated. Faraday's Law of Induction states that a current is induced when a magnetic field is moved through a coil of wire. This law, which is what causes “shake-up flashlights” to work, is a core part of the generator. Instead of shaking up one cylinder, an array of four cylinders similar to those of an inline-four engine is used. At the end of each “piston,” there will be a strong cylindrical magnet. Wrapped around a cylinder that has little or no effect on the magnetic field is a coil of wire. Hence, with every turn of the crankshaft, four times the amount of gross energy output is produced than there would be with one cylinder. This principle can be applied to the modern hybrid automobile by using the motion of the engine to recharge the battery. Doing so would enable the driver to spend less time using the gasoline engine, achieving greater fuel efficiency.

OPTIMAL FARADAY SHIELD DESIGN PARTICULAR TO COMMERCIAL MRI
Sirish Veligati
Saint Joseph Central High School, St. Joseph, MO

The radio waves emitted from 3-5 Tesla MRI machines can cause the atoms in a patient’s body to precess at such a high level that the patient’s nerve cells may be stimulated, causing discomfort. If the radio waves are blocked from entering all but the target area of the patient, the patient will avoid unnecessary discomfort.<br><br>A previous year’s study determined that a design with more connected wires was more efficient than many loosely disconnected wires of a higher distribution.<br><br>This study was to determine the optimal design of radio wave shield in areas of wire diameter and wire distribution. The designs were tested in microwave shielding efficiency, and MRI Image interference using 384-well microtiter plates filled with butter. This was conducted through a series of four experiments. The hypothesis was that there would be no difference between the efficiency of the designs. As wire diameter increased, microwave shielding efficiency increased. As wire spacing increased, microwave shielding efficiency decreased. Regression analysis indicated that both MRI tests were statistically insignificant.

AUTONOMOUS HUMAN-SEEKING ROBOT
Elizabeth Charlotte Coquillette
Hathaway Brown School, Shaker Heights, OH

Increasing levels of autonomy in search-and-rescue robots offer powerful opportunities to increase the safety, efficiency, and accuracy of rescue missions. The purpose of this project is to develop a fully autonomous rescue robot that can successfully navigate through a building, find humans, and determine and record their locations. This task was accomplished as an independent project by this student researcher using four major subsystems: control and mobility, physical state estimator, steering, and human location. The robot can accurately control its own movement through an encoder-based motor feedback control program. It continuously updates an estimate of its position within the larger coordinate map using inputs from the wheel encoders and corresponding kinematics algorithms. Additionally, it augments this estimate using corrections calculated by reconciling an expected position with the data from its laser range sensor. The robot employs these capabilities to follow a predetermined path through its environment using an a priori floor plan and a steering algorithm to keep it on course. Last, it identifies, locates, and reports on warm bodies using an infrared heat-detecting camera, image processing techniques, and a triangulation calculation. Each of these subsystems is integrated into an overall system that successfully accomplishes its task. This research has near-term applications in both search-and-rescue and security robots.

SOLDIER POWER
Katherine Sophia Antoniak
Hanford High School, Richland, WA

The United States military currently is facing a power crisis. With soldiers carrying an average of twenty to forty pounds of batteries on a standard four-day mission, and with roughly fifty-seven thousand dollars being spent per soldier in Afghanistan or Iraq per year, a device that will generate a small, continuous level of locomotive power is drastically needed.<br><br>I researched and considered various “soldier power” systems, focusing on piezoelectric, hydraulic, pneumatic, pure mechanical, and hybrid systems, and, through careful elimination, decided upon exploring a hybrid model. <br><br>Specifically because I wanted to generate power from locomotion, I chose to attempt doing so by theoretically having my generator be placed in the heel of a shoe, so that the power from walking could be converted into electricity. To do this I would have to convert the vertical linear motion of a footfall to an amplified horizontal motion that is used to spin a gear and drive an electrical generator. I did so through the use of two toggles, using lubricated dental floss and a chain as a drive belts. <br><br>My model, though obviously a prototype that would need much work before it could be used in the field, shows great potential – I measured an overall efficiency of linear vertical stroke to electrical power out of ~ 38 %, at a power output of 0.86 W (average values). The chief mechanical areas requiring improvement are the toggles, and a durable drive belt. However, the entire system requires optimization: significantly greater conversion efficiency, miniaturization, and better arrangement of components/packaging before it can be effectively employed.

MICRO-ENGINEERING A REMOTE CONTROLLED AIRSHIP
Zachary Robert Morse
Jefferson High School, Shenandoah Junction, WV

The purpose of this project was to determine if a standard helium-filled latex balloon could be used in the design of a remote controlled airship. The first tests conducted determined the ratio of lift to volume of helium by recording the reduction in weight of known weights when varying volumes of helium exerted an upward force. The second set of tests calculated the volume of the helium held within the balloons using water displacement. The volume to lift ratio of helium was 2.2L : 1 gram lifted. Standard 11 inch balloons held approximately 14 liters of helium, and lifted just over 6 grams. The third portion of the project used this data to construct propulsion and control units from motors, batteries, switches, and RC circuitry, the weight of which could be lifted by a standard latex balloon. The components were assembled on small Styrofoam cards in order to reduce weight and have little impact on airflow. The addition of stabilizers steadied the flight path of the craft and small wings will likely increase maneuverability. The current design flies relatively well, yet a two engine system would be more effective than the current rudder, providing for sharper handling. Although RC airships and blimps already exist, they are large, use large quantities of helium and are costly to keep inflated. A smaller airship, utilizing small balloons would be more portable and cheaper to maintain. Several improvements would result in a more marketable toy. Improved directional control is essential for a user-friendly experience.

TEMMED:DRUG-TIMING SYSTEM
Rolando Alberto Retana_Badilla
Colegio Tecnico Profesional Don Bosco, San Jose, COSTA RICA

We are gradually becoming more and more overwhelmed by daily stress, and this causes health problems, unfortunately, due to the fast-paced lifestyle we have, or simply due to our physical conditions or age. As a result I decided to create an electronic device inspired on the actual needs and difficulties of the patient. The general objective of this project was to create an electronic device based on the market conditions required by a country like Costa Rica, which may contribute somehow to the improvement of people with health problems who have some sort of diminished capacity, due to some type of physical disability or due to their old age, or simply because their daily routine is very hectic. Right from the start, during the description phase of TEMMED, the idea was to design a compact device, at an affordable price with all the requirements the patient or user may have. The design process is divided into three stages: the user interface, software design, and hardware design. Assembler language was used to design the software in charge of controlling every piece of data entered by the user of the device; it also controls time and output devices. Hardware design comprises the use of a very ergonomic system, aimed at developing practicality and elegance for the user of the device. The resulting user interface is as simple as possible, considering that the users of the device are people with limited mobility or diverse problems, both physical and mental. TEMMED only has 9 buttons for the user to perform all the necessary device programming and control functions, the buttons are an on/off button, a Reset button that deletes any configuration made, three selection buttons used to chose the container being programmed (SELECT), another to indicate approval of the changes made (ACCEPT), and the last one to setup the current time of the device (TIME). Aside from the previous, there are four setup buttons to change the numbers on the display in order to enter the time. <br><br>In conclusion, this device benefits the entire population and satisfies different types of user, such as people who need to use medication, people with special abilities, people caring for sick individuals or in charge of those hospitalized in intermediate and intensive care units, and is not limited to a single specific group or age.

Purpose of the project: To automate the national and institutional elections process making it accessible to the majority of the population, thus reducing the human and financial resources invested in processes such as this one.<br><br>Procedures: National and international voting systems were researched.<br><br>A source code was developed to allow recording information from a PLC in a quick and safe fashion. The hardware that automates the election process was designed and built for use with a common ballot adapting it to different election prototypes. A feasibility study was done to compare the different aspects of the manual voting system versus the prototype developed. <br><br>Results: A multitask, multiuser software (SISPEC)was developed that allows controlling a voting booth from a single input port.<br><br>Hardware was created capable of adapting to different election ballot designs.<br><br>Different election prototypes were designed and built which can be manipulated by a vast majority of the population.<br><br>Conclusions:<br><br>By achieving the goals of the project and attaining the creation of applicable systems, soon their use may be encouraged in schools and for national elections in the near future. The development of models combining simplicity and current technology results in designs that are technologically sound and fast, while being accepted by the people since no technical knowledge is required for their use. Adults or disabled people, together with the general population, will adapt to the systems seamlessly, because they provide certain advantages and options to voters compared to current voting methods.

I have designed a device that will aid musicians learning musical scales on the Trumpet or other 3-valved brass instrument through silent practice of finger patterns of the selected scale, with visual confirmation of a correct response and audio feedback (through headphones). <br><br>I developed the electronics on breadboard; finalised the circuit schematic; designed a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) which I had made from my design files and assembled it by hand using the chosen components. I had help programming the microprocessor around which the circuit is centred, creating new software with tables of scales and fingering details, musical notes and of course making it possible to operate the unit.<br><br>The case, which contains all the electronics and batteries, is in two halves. I created two wooden moulds then used a vacuum forming machine. Two handles were attached to allow the user to hold the device like a trumpet, so it feels more natural to them. The entire assembly was spray painted. It was important to create a realistic valve action to emulate that of the trumpet - a mechanical spring and plunger arrangement is used with magnetic or optical sensing of the action going to the microchip. <br><br>The completed device relieves parents and others from having to listen to tedious scale repetition and makes it more fun to learn scales which are worth 15% of the total marks available in the UK Musical Instrument exam grades.

How about to produce energy by using them and magnetic field?<br><br>Think of that, in the world approximately 1 billion people are using the computers and imagine the consumption because of this usage. Like everything, every problem has a solution and this time the solution is in our hand. My aim is to produce electrical energy without polluting the environment, without high cost, by using keyboard. This project is to reduce the energy consumption of the computers.<br><br>I had also done some experiments to find the solution for some problems. I did five experiments. Also I went to universities and talk with the lectures about our project, how could it be better. I took also their advices.<br><br>I have provided my project in different ways in order to obtain different values of electric current. As thin as the wire is, its resistance is going to be bigger so more energy is going to be produced and as powerful as the magnet is also more energy is going to be produced. I have provided it by changing:<br><br>-The type of the wire<br><br>-The type of the magnet<br><br>-The thickness of the bobbin <br><br>-The measure of the magnet<br><br>At the end of this experiment I reached that, electrical current can be produced by using the magnetic field and the keyboard. When a magnet passes in the middle of the bobbin, energy is produced. Nowadays, the necessity of energy is increasing, so I can overcome the problem of electricity by using this method without polluting environment and without any expenses.

INTELLIGENT HELMET
Thiago Alcides Jacobi
Fundacao Escola Tecnica Liberato Salzano Vieira da Cunha, Novo Hamburgo, Rio Grande do Sul, BRASIL

Today, the number of fatal traffic accidents involving motorcycles is scary. According to the Denatran (National Traffic Department), an accident of bike for every 600 bikes in circulation, and the Brazilian fleet is about 11 million motorcycles in 2007. It is important to stress that 28% of casualties were not using the safety helmet and 21.5% of injuries occurred in the head. These accidents caused 18,000 deaths and 214,000 hospitalizations, the majority of these deaths as a consequence the head injury, which could be avoided with the proper use of the helmet. <br><br> The project was developed Intelligent Capacete to alleviate the serious injury and fatal traffic accidents. The main idea is to make use of the helmet so that the motorcycle can not be connected without the correct use of the main security equipment. To resolve this problem was designed, manufactured and adapted an electronic device in the helmet and the motorcycle. When the helmet is properly inserted in the head transmitter device is activated, sending a signal to the receiver, which is installed on the bike, and enables the system to start. <br><br> Were carefully reviewed the dimensions and the necessary equipment for the construction and operation of the prototype, always looking for better performance and lower cost. After a series of tests and adjustments of the device, it is permissible to conclude that in addition to requiring the rider correctly use the helmet, the helmet serves as an Intelligent anti-furto, for without it, the bike does not turn on. The Intelligent Helmet can be adapted and installed on any or motorcycle helmet, with an affordable price, making it an innovative project and social benefit. <br><br>Keywords: Traffic accident.

PREIGNITION DETECTOR
Felipe Gabriel Kuhn Soares
Fundacao Escola Tecnica Liberato Salzano Vieira da Cunha, Novo Hamburgo, Rio Grande do Sul, BRASIL

This project is the development of a preignition detector prototype, for laboratory tests on racing engines, where could occur preignition. The device alerts the engine self-ignition, a phenomenon that can perforates the piston. The solution is the development of three main stages: a plasmatic current indicator, a spark sensor and a preignition discriminator. Plasmatic current indicator informs the flame presence in the spark plug. The spark sensor shows the exact moment of the spark discharge and the preignition discriminator makes the comparison between these two signals and indicates the occurrence of abnormal combustion. A construction of a plasmatic current indicator involves the use of the same igniting spark plug, which is already into the combustion chamber. A special circuit is connected to spark plug to detect flame, or plasma. The spark sensor is based on an automotive inductive pick up and the preignition discriminator is represented in the microcontroller. Test results with the three stages demonstrates viability of proposed solution. The plasmatic current indicator detects flame between the electrodes with good noise immunity and the stage connected to the inductive pick up can indicate the spark time to the microcontroller. Signals from two analog stages can be analyzed by preignition discriminator. Another important conclusion was the control unit’s immunity to noise during the tests.

SENSOR TO DETECT LIQUIDS
Thomas Nesch
Technische Oberschule Stuttgart, Stuttgart, GERMANY

Today, in the automotive industry, car bodies are painted by robots using an electrostatic painting method.<br><br>The paint is transported by flexible pipes, which often get fissures, through the robot. Then paint escapes the pipe and damages the robot and car bodies.<br><br> A sensor to detect the leaking paint needs to be small, explosion-proof, free of silicone and able to detect small amounts of all paints. The apparatus also needs to stand up to the electrostatic field (120 000 volts), but must not divert it.<br><br> Market research showed that no device meets all these requirements. So the goal of the project was to develop such a sensor.<br><br> An optical principle was applied, which included a specifically designed transparent device to steer the light of the transmitter of a one way light barrier through a detection zone. In this zone the light flux to the receiver is interrupted by a transparent or non transparent liquid.<br><br> The practical construction showed that the developed detection facility could detect all kinds of paints and all different liquids (even nebulized). After improving the transparent device, liquid amounts well under 100 microlitres could be detected reliably by the system.<br><br> Thus, a new sensor was invented which can save millions of dollars in car paintings. The ROI is calculated to be below one month.<br><br>Because of its versatility and economic construction, the sensor can be used in almost all industries (also in very dangerous ranges) to detect liquids very economically.<br><br> There is already a high industrial demand!

AUTOMATED WIRED EQUIVALENT PRIVACY AND RC4 ENCRYPTION PROTECTION THROUGH 802.11 WIRELESS PACKET INJECTION
Karson M Miller
John L. Miller-Great Neck North High School, Great Neck, NY

In modern wireless networks, engineers work to create more secure connectivity, but with increased security comes less compatibility. The most utilized security protocol for<br><br>802.11 wireless networks is Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) because it is highly compatible with other wireless devices. Despite its high compatibility rates, WEP is very insecure. Attackers are able to decrypt WEP keys in a matter of minutes. The most utilized<br><br>and current attacking software is called Aircrack-ng suite. The suite consists of a packet collecting utility, packet injection utility, and a WEP decrypter. At present there are no ways of stopping these attacks without sacrificing compatibility or enabling limited network connectivity. The purpose of this project was to construct an external device to monitor and protect WEP secured wireless networks using standard access point (router) hardware. To do this, the Aircrack-ng suite was reverse engineered to distinguish attacks from normal traffic. A program called AntiWEP was written in C++ to monitor wireless traffic for WEP attacks and repel these attacks by sending false packets to the attacker. In order to test the device a laptop was setup and coded with an automated attacking script called AutoWEP. Three tests were runs with 30 trials each. The control test had AutoWEP attack a router. The second test introduced the device to stop the attacks. The third test added a laptop to generate extra traffic. The device detected all of the attacks, but did not always respond in time. Over 70% of the attacks were repelled. This device has the capability of successfully stopping all attacks with optimization.

CALCULATION AND MODELLING OF A SPEAKER SYSTEM OF LEVEL HI-FI IN HOUSE CONDITIONS
Alexey Dimitrovich Kostadinov
Liceym of Reutov, Reutov, Moscow region, RUSSIA

Many different sound systems are presented nowadays, but acoustics possessing a good sound, costs much. Because of it there is an opinion, that qualitative acoustics is bound to be expensive and so it cannot be constructed independently. Therefore I have decided to construct the acoustic system, using simple engineering solutions. Its characteristics should correspond to standards of Hi-Fi, i.e. the system should possess “high accuracy” reproduction: low distortion level, a wide range of reproduction, the linear frequency characteristic.<br><br>I have chosen a format 2.1 - two frontal satellites and one low-frequency link. I have used simple technical solutions – passive filters and crossovers, amplifiers, built on unipolar transistors.<br><br>All necessary parameters are calculated in special software. Parameters of acoustic enclosure of speakers and dividing filters are calculated in programs WinISD Pro, BoxSim 1.03 and Audio Analyzer 1.03. Characteristics of amplifiers and power units are calculated in program DPCalculator. <br><br>As a result I have constructed the acoustic system which characteristics meat the standards of Hi-Fi. Its characteristics are:<br><br>Output power - 350 Watt<br><br>Sound pressure level - 110 dB<br><br>Frequency range - 25 Hz - 25 kHz<br><br>Maximum frequency deviations - ± 2 dB<br><br> Total distortion level - 0.5 %<br><br>According to a task in view it is possible to draw a conclusion – it is possible to construct a Hi-Fi sound system in house condition, using simple engineering solutions. This work has a practical value as it proves, that the qualitative audio system can be independently calculated and constructed with less money.

IONIC PROPULSION: A NEW FRONTIER
Alexis Emily Block
Nicolet High School, Milwaukee, WI

Conventional chemical fuel powered rockets are required to carry and use large amounts of fuel, and therefore have a restricted time limit in space, is there an alternative that would allow for the use of less chemical fuel and more time in space? The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the principles of ionic propulsion in the atmosphere using high voltage to develop ionic fields. To test this hypothesis, that an ionic field can propel an object, and the length of the time applied is more important than voltage, an ionic engine was first created with copper rods and balls. To power this, an automobile ignition coil, battery charger, and various devices to interrupt the current, were used. When this proved less successful an alternate means of delivering a high voltage was investigated; using a counter current voltage multiplier, I was able to deliver up to 30 kV to the engine and demonstrated various levels of propulsion. To build on this success, a two-piece ion accelerator engine was developed based on lifter technology. Results showed propulsion could be achieved through high voltage application to this novel ionic engine.

ENGINEERING A SIMPLER TITANIUM DIOXIDE NANOPARTICLES- BASED SOLAR CELL THAT IS COMPETITIVE FOR FUTURE MARKETS
Idan Ben-Yitschak
Nicolet High School, Milwaukee, WI

Silicon-based solar cells, while the most efficient kind of solar cell and have fill factors of about 70%, are expensive to manufacture. Recently, there has been a new kind of dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) based on a titanium dioxide film made out of nanoparticles and an electrochemical dye, usually chlorophyll or ruthenium-polypyridine. These solar cells are approximately 10 times cheaper, and reach efficiencies of 6-8%. Still, the most efficient DSSC’s still require procedures and materials that are quite complex to achieve efficiency, such as creating the ruthenium-polypyridine dye or using a thin sheet of platinum to support the iodide. In this project, a TiO2-based DSSC was assembled based on more common materials, such as pomegranate seeds for the dye, chloroform to maintain a suspension of the particles, and a simpler electrolyte solution out of potassium and iodine. Then, it was tested for voltage and current to determine the fill factor of the cell to see if it was competitive enough for the market. The simpler DSSC produced a fill factor of 33.33%, or one-third. The cell achieved a quite high fill factor (relative to the materials used) that is competitive and attractive enough for real-world applications. Many improvements could have been added to the cell, such as using a different iodide other than iodine, spreading the TiO2 film more uniformly, adding a carbon nanotubes dye to increase conductivity or grinding the TiO2 particles more. With these other simple improvements, The DSSC could easily be competitive for future uses and applications.

HEAT WAVE 2: THE SEARCH FOR THE OPTIMUM HEAT RADIATOR
Joel Jack Tinker
Covenant Christian Academy, Huntsville, AL

Space vehicles and earth-based systems in the future will require radiators that are lightweight and efficient, since radiator mass can be a significant fraction of the total system mass. Purposes of this project were to determine (a) the optimum heat radiator design, (b) effect of material, size and shape, thickness, and surface coating on radiator performance, and (c) the effect of forced convection on radiator performance in air.<br><br> To accomplish the objectives, experiments were conducted in atmospheric and vacuum conditions. Natural convection experiments were conducted for aluminum panels of several shapes and thicknesses, and forced convection experiments were performed using a 15.2 cm square aluminum panel with low (1.7 m/sec) and high (4.2 m/sec) air flow velocities. Experiments in a vacuum chamber were performed for panels having the same surface area, but different materials and surface finishes. Steady state temperatures were measured on each panel at several locations, for both atmospheric and vacuum experiments.<br><br> Natural convection radiator experiments showed that surface area and conductivity were the main factors affecting performance. The optimum heat radiator was a four-panel 15.2 cm square aluminum, with convective heat transfer of 7.8 W. Forced convection tests showed that the 15.2 cm square aluminum panel with high (4.2 m/sec) flow velocity had the lowest temperature. Vacuum experiments showed that surface area, conductivity, and surface finish (emissivity) were the primary factors affecting radiator performance. The optimum heat radiator in vacuum was a 15.2x22.9 cm copper panel with flat white paint, with radiative heat transfer of 12.2 W.

MAKING THE WEIGHT: CREATING AN EFFICIENT GRAIN CLEANING SYSTEM
Lane William Alley
Isabel High School, Isabel, SD

The goal of my project was to create a cost efficient, low maintenance, easy to use grain cleaning system. American grain producers face many factors when striving to harvest high quality, in demand grain. Any impurities such as light kernels, dirt, weeds, or foreign seeds can result in dockage of grain quality and substantial loss in profits. In addition, impure grain can also result in increase cleaning costs at later processing stages. The grain cleaner I designed is a one stage cleaning process. After designing various types of systems, I finalized my design as a boot that fit on the end of an auger that had screens in it, a fan, and a vacuum on it that was easy to install and use. I built the body of my grain cleaner out of high grade 8 in. PVC pipe. Then I cut holes in the side of the pipe for the hose of the vacuum to be inserted in. I added metal screens angled inside the pipe to provide agitation while the grain is following into the cleaning device. When the vacuum and auger were activitated the impurities were removed while grain was moved into storage. To test my design I cleaned 20 lbs each of wheat, oats, and corn. After running the grain through the cleaner, I weighed the grain again and also measured the amount of debris extracted from the grain. I was able to see significant amounts of dockage removed from all of the grain samples.

SOLAR HEAT CONCENTRATOR
Seth Allen Fisher
The King's Academy, Mohrsville, PA

The goal of this project was to design, construct and test a solar heat concentrator. The system consists of a parabolic mirror and receiver, sunlight sensors and computer controlled drive motors for tracking the motion of the sun in the horizontal and vertical planes. The parabolic reflector was constructed using segmented mirrors. A laser was used to align the parabolic dish with an incandescent light. The incandescent light was then used to align the mirror segments to reflect the sun onto the receiver. A water cooled copper coil was used as the receiver. A set of four photocells was mounted on the mirror assembly to measure the position of the sun. A microcontroller was programmed to find the position of the sun and move the mirror. The drive motors can rotate the mirror and change the elevation to maximize the sunlight focused on the receiver. The system was designed and tested indoors. The photo detectors were saturated when exposed to the full intensity of direct sunlight. A set of caps with drilled holes was added to the photo detectors. The device was then able to follow the sun. The apparatus was tested by measuring the inlet and outlet water temperatures, the air temperature inside and outside of the receiver coil. Because of the initial failure of the tracking system, the device has not been fully tested. A significant increase in water temperature was recorded when the device was operating in direct sunlight. Additional testing is planned.

There are varieties of bulbs in the market and they have two types of bases. One is screw type and the other is pin type. There are two holder types which are compatible to each type of bulb. To replace one type of bulb by another, holders also need to be replaced. Mismatching problem of bulb holders and bulb can be avoided by using a dual base bulb holder. This invention is a solution to avoid frequent replacement of bulb holders according to bulb type. Significant features of this bulb holder are simplicity and ease of operation and manufacture.<br><br>There is a thread on the top part of the bulb holder to fix threaded type bulbs. A special pin consisting of a spring is placed in between normal two pins to match for thread type bulbs. Length of special pin is greater than two normal pins. This may leads to avoid loose contact when we use different type of bulbs. This is clearance in between conventional two pins and end of the threaded bulb.<br><br>To fix the bayonet bulb you should enter the two pins of bulb to holder and turn it in normal manner. Then bulb must lock in holder. To remove bulb from cavity push the bulb first and remove from lock. You have to make sure that bulb need to come out alone the pathways.<br><br>This innovative holder will revolutionize the field of electrical engineering.

WIND: HARNESSING THE POWER OF THE GYROSCOPE
Montana Duke Wilson
Wolf Point High School, Wolf Point, MT

This project in its present form is the result of experimentation of engineering technology on the affect of the gyroscope upon a wind turbine. The initial idea was to create a turbine that utilizes gyroscopic inertia in order to stabilize the wind turbine’s rotor. Successful development with the gyroscope eventually led to the formulation of a wind turbine that provided stability at high speeds and was operational in low altitudes.<br><br> The efficiency of the gyroscope wind turbine was determined by three methods of testing: minimum wind speed required to produce electricity, altitude of operation, and efficiency of turbine. Minimum wind speed and altitude of operation were tested using a wind tunnel on the gyroscope turbine to measure how much wind is needed to produce electricity and to determine at what altitude the turbine is most suited. The efficiency of the gyroscope turbine was compared to a traditional wind turbine’s electrical output using a ratio of the two wind turbine’s electrical output to minimum speed required to produce electricity. <br><br>Horizontal axis turbines have blades that create lift to spin the rotor, whereas the gyroscope turbine operates on the basis of drag—one side creates more drag in moving air than the other, causing the shaft to spin. Therefore, the turbine is more stable in cross winds and operates in lower altitudes, but it’s less efficient then horizontal wind turbines.<br><br> The benefit of this project is that the wind turbine intergraded with a gyroscope was proven to be more stable and efficient in low altitude operation.

CATCHING SUNBEAMS: USING SIMPLE ROBOTICS TO INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF A SOLAR PANEL
Noah James Gagnon
Gagnon Family Homeschool, Goodrich, MI

Solar panels play a large role in lessening the world’s dependence on non-renewable fossil fuels. In order to obtain the greatest efficiency from a solar array, the panels in the array must be placed at the correct angle in relation to the sun’s position above the horizon at noon. This poses the question: If a stationary array positioned at the correct angle is more efficient than one that is not at this angle, will not an array designed to automatically follow the sun be even more efficient? Having considered this and researched the existing body of knowledge, the following hypothesis was formulated: A solar panel which automatically follows the sun will generate more voltage than a stationary panel. A robotic device to keep the panel properly aimed was designed and constructed using BEAM technology. It was then subjected to eleven test periods, each lasting one day. During these periods the voltage produced by the moving panel was gathered, along with that produced by a stationary control panel of the same model. The data was gathered using a Lego Mindstorms NXT microprocessor and was wirelessly transferred to a laptop computer. The data was analyzed using computer-generated graphs and it was decided that the sun-tracking solar panel did indeed produce more voltage than the stationary one. The difference in voltage produced was found to be 0.1-0.5 percent.

Merino Jr. Sr. High School, Merino, CO

The goal of this project was to create a school lockdown robot that has the capability of locating, identifing, and gathering information on an intruder during a school crisis. The researcher used a remote control car as the platform for his project.The car was controlled by Comfiletech's CUBLOC controller. This is a PLC or programmable logic controller.This interprets the controllers code to switch on the relays running the motors. The motors for the car were hooked up to one of the two 8 relay boards hooked up in a H bridge circuit. The CUBLOC is hooked up to the wireless router with the new DD-WRT firmware on it allowing the router to be a bridge. The CUBLOC is hooked up through the maxport server which converts the rs232 port to ethernet port. The IP camera is hooked up to the router allowing the researcher to see where the car is going and helping to identify the intruder when controlling the robot from a different location. The car is controlable by an IP address using the Visual Basics program that the researcher built. The car travels at a speed of roughly 10 miles per hour. This is comparable to the rate at which a human walks. This car will help in school security by aiding the law enforcement personnel in capturing an intruder at a school. In conclusion through many test runs the robot has been succesful in reaching the goal of the project.

This project is to research a payment method which is more convenient than cash card or credit card. You just put your mobile phone or PDA, which is equipped with built-in RFID reader and Wi-Fi function, near a product’s RFID tag to complete a fast payment process via shop computer’s internet banking. The customer has no need to queue up at the cashier, and no need to pass the credit card to the shop keeper for payment and hence avoid credit card fraud. In my project, I embedded a UHF 862-955 MHz RFID reader module in a PDA running on Marvell XScale PXA270 microcontroller ,Windows CE 6.0, and self-develop the application software of Wi-Fi and database connection for the whole RFID mobile payment process as follows: <br><br>1. Put the PDA near product’s RFID tag and check product information<br><br>2. Confirm pay to shop computer by WI-FI<br><br>3. Shop computer connects to internet banking and process payment<br><br>4. Payment receipt is sent to customer’s RFID PDA by shop computer<br><br>5. Shop computer sends a signal to disable product RFID tag’s surveillance function <br><br>To the merchant shops, they can increase business by more convenient payment, save cashier manpower and avoid product theft. For people living in populous cities and shopping malls of high traffic and high turnover, RFID mobile payment, the new generation of smart payment, should bring them tremendous social and economic benefits.

The project set out to optimize the deployment of a vehicle lifting system and create a more efficient mechanism. Initial research showed a range of lifting mechanisms and almost all of the mechanisms were equally effective in lifting, however, the main obstacles were the ease of use and the time taken for deployment. Consideration of the number of fatalities involving drivers engaged in the process of changing a flat wheel, the decision was taken to focus on reducing the time and effort in deploying a scissors mechanism. <br><br>A range of time and effort-saving solutions were investigated, tested and evaluated, but only one provided a viable solution which was simple, efficient, economical and safe.<br><br>Functionally, the mechanism operates by rapid engagement and disengagement of a pivot point of the scissor frame from the threaded bar, allowing it to move freely, facilitating the vertical extension to change quickly.<br><br>The operation of the mechanism is intuitive; having identified the mode of engagement and disengagement of the device, adjusting the height becomes second nature. The time for adjustment is a matter of seconds regardless of the height difference between the ground and the point of engagement.<br><br>The solution employs two in-built safety features; one which inhibits the mechanism disengaging through human intervention when a load is applied, while the second increases engagement of the threads with the pivot point with increasing load.<br><br>This mechanism offers potential for a variety of applications from the domestic car market and motor homes to time-critical military use.

Fundacao Bradesco - Escola de Canuana, Formoso de Araguaia, TO, BRASIL

In Brazil low-income farmers need to apply herbicides to produce seedlings. Substrates' disinfection could reduce risks of herbicides application. Specific disinfection equipment is too expensive for the local population.<br><br>The research goal was to develop a low-cost solar substrate sterilizer, guaranteeing the efficiency in obtaining high-temperatures to promote the sterilization. <br><br>Based a reference design, I built a solar sterilizer replacing expensive materials with cheaper ones: PVC, PET and aluminum. The solar collector is a wooden box containing six tubes, where the substrate is placed. I made six tubes of each material. At the bottom of the box, I placed aluminum foil to get a good reflection of sunlight, and at the top a cover of transparent plastic, allowing the entry of sunlight.<br><br>The experiment consisted in leaving the substrate in the sterilizer for some days and after that, put this substrate inside the greenhouses to allow the germination of the remaining weed. A non-sterilized substrate served as a control sample. To determine the minimum necessary sun exposure, I started leaving it in the sun for 21 days, and then I reduced the amount of time in the subsequent experiments. Each day, I collected the temperature of the tubes for the later analysis.<br><br>The control sample had an average of 20 germinations for all experiments. The analysis of temperature reached by PVC and aluminum tubes in a period of five days showed that there were no relevant differences between the materials. However, PVC is 76% cheaper than aluminum, which makes it a better cost-benefit choice.

JET ENGINE BY COMPRESSION THROUGH SHOCK WAVES AND AUTONOMOUS ACCELERATION
Rafael Telis Gazzin Pessoa
Centro Federal de Educacao Tecnologica de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, BRASIL

Any system that needs to move requires some kind of engine, in other words, a whole system, which converts determined energy (electrical, etc) in mechanical energy. In aviation, presently, aircrafts are turbine powered, especially among those of medium and large carry.

A COMPUTER SYSTEM TO TURN PAGES OF A VIRTUAL BOOK WITH EYE BLINKS
Nicholas Hansen
Mont Harmon Junior High, Price, UT

This is a brain computer interface system that enables the user to turn the pages of a virtual book without the use of hands. The system monitors electrical activity on the forehead, and prompts a page turn when it detects the electrical signal generated by an eye blink. This system would have application for people who have limited use of their hands, such as stroke victims and people with paraplegia.<br><br>The project has four elements: 1) An electroencephalogram (EEG) amplifier is used to monitor the electrical activity on the surface of the forehead. 2) The EEG data is processed to distinguish blink signals from other electrical signals. 3) A server program is used to communicate between the EEG processing program and the target program. 4) The target electronic book program is designed to turn a page when it receives the signal from the server program.<br><br>This system uses an approach that is not commercially available nor described in the previous literature. The system is an effective, non-invasive, low-cost method of controlling computer function by monitoring surface electrical activity of the skin. The system does not require the end user to have computer or EEG expertise. Further development of this concept could expand the possibilities for computer control using head and eye movements, making numerous computer functions available with out the use of hands.

LOOK AT THIS MES: MARS ENVIRONMENT SIMULATOR III
Julie Emily Walker
Leonardtown High School, Leonardtown, MD

My project is to engineer a safe Martian Environment Simulator (MES) that is small enough to be portable, price effective, accurate and reliable enough to be used to test materials for Mars exploration or test physical or environmental properties of Mars itself.<br><br>I used a Systems Engineering process to: define stakeholder requirements, perform requirements analysis, design and implement the MES. This year's work included: continued requirements refining, cost tradeoffs, integrating subsystems into a final MES, testing against system requirements, tracking test failures and design modifications to complete a final functioning MES.<br><br>Using pressure sensors I have tested the vacuum integrity and control of the pressure subsystem. The leaking through the access panels is currently unacceptable. Using temperature sensors I have tested the temperature response and control requirements of the MES. The temperature subsystem has met its requirements. I rebuilt the electrical subsystem from last year, but it continues to have reliability failures. The pressure sensors proved inadequate for measuring wind speed so a telltale like the one on the Phoenix Lander will be used. I have tracked the build costs which have exceeded the budget but not excessively. I have measured setup times which have met their requirements.<br><br>I anticipate the MES will be a useful tool for Mars Environmental research. The Systems Engineering process has allowed me to come up with a final design for the MES and led me to discover new methods to effectively recreate multiple aspects of the Martian environment inside of one chamber.

THE EFFECT OF SWITCHING ON LIFETIME AND LIFE CYCLE COST OF COMPACT FLUORESCENT LAMPS AND INCANDESCENT BULBS
Elizabeth Marie Mako
W.T. Woodson High School, Fairfax, VA

Federal legislation is imposing a ban on incandescent bulbs and forcing the use of compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs). This legislation was initiated by a major lighting manufacturer (Philips); so one wonders, is the motive to go “green” for the planet or the profits, since the capital cost of CFLs can be a factor of five to thirty times greater than incandescent bulbs.<br><br> CFLs consume less energy compared to incandescent bulbs. However, they do not save money or last longer under reasonable switching conditions. <br><br> CFLs have been determined to have a limit of 12,498 switching cycles (average) before burnout. By comparison, inexpensive incandescent bulbs do not burnout after 82,100 switching cycles. <br><br> The consequences of this limit are:If an application demands less than five minutes of ON time per cycle, then the life cycle cost of a CFL can be several hundred percent more expensive than a comparable incandescent bulb, even in spite of the reduced operating cost of the more energy efficient CFL. However, if a CFL is operated for about one hour of ON time per cycle, then the incandescent bulb will cost a few hundred percent more on a life cycle cost basis. <br><br> The operating life of incandescent bulbs can easily exceed that of CFLs if they are operated at less than one hour of ON time per switching cycle. <br><br> To maximize the life of CFLs, they should be switched ON for about one hour per cycle and be used at the lowest number of cycles per day.

A VOLUMETRIC DISPLAY FOR CREATING THREE-DIMENSIONAL IMAGES IN MOTION
Ethan Cannon Green
Aaron Academy, Hendersonville, TN

This project created a volumetric display that can generate moving images in empty space through digitally stored information. An 8mm-pitch array of 64 light-emitting diodes was mounted above the concave surface of a 7cm-diameter allyl diglycol carbonate lens. Approximately 7.6% of the light produced by the LED array was reflected into the space above the lens surface, creating a real image between the focal point of the lens and its center of curvature. The lens was oscillated vertically by the reciprocating arm of a modified sewing machine, shifting the position at which the light rays converged and creating vertical depth in the projected image.<br><br><br>The resulting image, appearing to the eye to "float" in empty space, was measured to be approximately 0.8cm in width and depth, an average magnification of -0.16 from the LED matrix, and 3.0cm in height, equal to the vertical reciprocation. Moving images were created and stored digitally by using a microcontroller to control individual LEDs. The images were visible from a wide range of angles in space and did not require viewing aids. <br><br><br>This project demonstrates that a volumetric display can be created using inexpensive, readily available materials and that three-dimensional images can be formed in empty space using digitally stored information. It represents an advancement from current technology, which often requires viewing aids or a spinning screen or other medium onto which three-dimensional images can be projected. With further refinement, similar technology might be used in applications ranging from air traffic control to advertisements.

TABLE TENNIS ROBOT: CAN A PROGRAMMABLE MCU UTILIZE PHYSICS TO HIT SPECIFIC LOCATIONS?
Benjamin Allen Meeder
Manheim Township High School, Lancaster, PA

This project was inspired by a need for an affordable table tennis robot that could target and shoot with precision and accuracy. The table tennis robot constructed was made to have marketable potential and a unique design before it went under construction. One of the main goals of this project was to target and hit specific locations on a table tennis table using different types of spin and by changing the direction it was pointing. <br><br> The robot used an original design to get table tennis balls from a collector tray to an eager player. The design of the shooter was based on Bernoulli’s Principle. As a ball would sit underneath a tube, a difference in pressure would suck that ball through a tube and into a forceful air current destined to shoot the ball at a high velocity. The robot was controlled by a microcontroller, several DC motors, and multiple H-bridges. The MCU used Pulse Width Modulation to control the motors and a special sensor called a rotary encoder was used to keep track of every move.<br><br> Through experimentation with a flexible program in C, the robot helped determine the voltage outputs needed to hit specific locations on a table tennis table. The robot was then able to use physics and experimental data to hit specific locations on the table with accuracy and precision.

DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL HIGH EFFICIENCY PHOTO-THERMOVOLTAIC CONCENTRATOR SOLAR CELL
Rounok Joardar
Shepton High School, Plano, TX

The energy conversion efficiency of photovoltaic (PV) solar cells is limited because these devices cannot utilize all of the energy available in sunlight. In today's best PV solar cells about 60% of the total available solar energy goes unused and is wasted as heat. A hybrid solar cell has been developed for the first time that attempts to overcome this limitation by using solid state thermoelectric generators (TEG) in combination with a conventional photovoltaic cell. The TEGs capture the heat wasted by the photovoltaic cell and convert it to additional electric energy. The objective of this project was to develop such a hybrid photo-thermovoltaic solar cell, using commercially available products, and demonstrate a conversion efficiency that is at least 5% greater than the efficiency of its photovoltaic cell alone. <br><br> A solar concentrator system with a Fresnel lens was used to study the behavior of hybrid photo-thermovoltaic solar cells. Since commercially available TEGs have only about a 2% conversion efficiency, multiple TEGs were used in cascaded arrangement to boost the total TEG efficiency. This work is the first reported use of cascaded TEGs to improve their thermal efficiency. <br><br>Load tests were done on different hybrid arrangements under varying solar concentration to determine the maximum power generated by the PV cell and TEGs. With adequately sized TEGs it was possible to obtain up to 7% efficiency increase using hybrid photo-thermovoltaic solar cells. This provides a path to a 50% efficient solar cell, the next major milestone in the field of solar energy.

ELECTROMAGNETIC TRANSPORTATION: PHASE III
Braxton Gage Hoenes
Beardstown High School, Beardstown, IL

The purpose of this experiment was to see which timer setting on the electromagnetic propulsion device produced the most linear system on a distance versus time graph.<br><br> The procedure of this experiment was to first set up the transformers, air track, stands and laptop with sensor. Electromagnets were placed, equally spaced, on the stands. Pasco motion sensor, Pasco powerlink, interval timer modules and the rheostat were then connected. The cart's magnet arrangement repelled it from the electromagnets. Using the stopwatch, the pause time on the timer module was determined. When turned on, the electromagnets propelled the cart on the air track and the path was recorded by the motion sensor. The mean standard error for each linear system was determined. <br><br> The conclusion of this experiment was that the hypothesis was partially correct. The shortest and the longest times acheived the best linear system. This was caused when the time put the cart into a stalemate position canceling the forces, while momentum overcame the effect. The information will be used to continue the project to develop a series of timed electromagnets that will produce a smooth path for the cart.

STUDY OF THE AUDIBLE FREQUENCY RANGES USING TWO DIFFERENT SOUND CAPACITORS
Cristian Rodriguez
Francisco Morales High School, Naranjito, PUERTO RICO

This research is about the effect on sound fidelity when a high pass capacitor or a low pass capacitor with a PD power regulator and a coil are used. A PD is a filter with high intensity voltage that works with low signal. The hypothesis was that if a high pass capacitor with a (PD) power regulator and a coil are integrated to a homemade electronic board then the sound quality and the output will be better. One sound speaker was used and two boards with electronic parts. One of the boards had a low pass capacitor and the other board had a high pass capacitor. The conductivity of the high pass capacitor was 10.1MFD and 100 volts and the low pass capacitor had a conductivity of 5.0 MFD and 50 volts. Each board was connected separately to the speaker.<br><br>An oscilloscope and an audio software ,Win ISDO, 50’7, were used to determine sound frequency when the high pass capacitor and the low pass capacitor were tested. Ten parameters related to the speakers were measured and the conductivity of the capacitor. The results of the investigation evidenced that using a high pass capacitor produce high sound fidelity and there was no distortion in the range of 40 to 100 Hz. When the low pass capacitor was used the sound was distorted in a 50 Hz frequency. The conclusion was that the use of the homemade electronic board with a high pass capacitor and coil have better results in sound fidelity.

AGUIRE: HIGH POTENTIAL OF WIND POWER ENERGY
Hery Colon -Zayas
Intermedia Coqui, Aguirre, PUERTO RICO

Petroleum is a non renewable source of energy that generates environmental pollution. These polluting agents are part of the global warming problem, and its necessary to look for alternatives to generate electric energy. Another source of energy can be produced by eolic energy. This kinetic energy generated by the stream of airflow can be transformed into other sources of energy. Wind powered mills were mentioned several years ago in the Aguirre community as an option to generate electricity. The hypothesis was that the Aguirre area had the necessary qualities to generate eolic energy that can be used as a source of electric energy. In order to verify this, an experiment was performed in several stages. Several homemade instruments were utilized. The first stage was to determine the wind direction. The second stage was to determine if there was a constant and strong air flow in this area. The third stage was to construct a machine that simulates a windmill to determine if sufficient electricity was generated to turn on a 6 volts lightbulb and another 110 volts lightbulb. Different size blades and materials were used for the windmill to verify if the wind speed was sufficient to turn on the lightbulbs. Electricity could be generated only to turn on the 6 volts lightbulb. After repeating the experiment during different periods during the year it was concluded that the Aguirre area does not have the necessary qualities to generate sufficient eolic energy that can be transformed into electric energy.

VOICE ACTIVATED NAVIGATION FOR THE BLIND
Nirusan Jayaranjan
College Sturgeon Heights Collegiate, Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA

Blindness is a serious issue in the world today. According to the World Health Organization, there are 161 million visually impaired people worldwide. I wanted to see if I could create system that would allow the blind to navigate buildings independently by using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), Parallax BASIC stamp, infrared sensors, and the integration of voice recognition. Voice recognition software and voice feedback is integrated into the system to allow the user to verbally dictate where they would like to go, and to also provide verbal feedback to the user. When the user enters a new building the available rooms would be dictated. Once a destination was chosen, upcoming turns and stairs would be spoken to the user. RFID technology was important to the project as it labels the specific rooms in the building and helps the robot locate itself and determine the correct path. The infrared sensors are used to help keep the robot on track. There would be a painted black line on the floor, and the robot using these IR sensors would be able to stay on this black line to ensure that visually impaired user was in fact going in the correct direction. Integrated sonar sensors in the front of the navigation system would be used as a collision avoidance system. The Parallax BASIC stamp hardware and software is what would allow these systems to work together to create the navigation system and allow the visually impaired to navigate independently and freely within buildings.

A COMPACT MINIATURIZED MEANDER ANTENNA FOR ULTRA HIGH FREQUENCY RFID READER IN MOBILE PHONE: DESIGN AND MEASUREMENT
Justine Kim
Taejon Christian International School, Daejeon, SOUTH KOREA

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems will become one of the most critical technical elements in our future ubiquitous society. Such applications include security identification, credit card charge, high-way toll payment, supermarket, and logistics systems. It is strongly expected that the mobile cellular phone will have the RFID reading capability using the Ultra High Frequency (UHF: 900MHz) electromagnetic waves, and the data access functions through wireless telephony and internet network. In this research, I proposed and demonstrated novel miniaturized antenna designs for UHF RFID reader in mobile phone. The compact UHF antenna designs were achieved based on a size reduction method of meander-shape dipole structures including flat-type and folded-type meander antennas. The antennas were devised to meet implementation requirements, such as size and thickness limitations, in order to be able to mount them on the surface of the mobile phone.<br><br>To prove the expected performance of the proposed antenna, a 3D electromagnetic (EM) simulator was employed for the calculation of gain, impedance matching, and radiation pattern. After creating the layouts of the designed antennas, the antenna patterns were fabricated on the FR4 substrates. Then, the frequency domain gain and matching measurements were performed. In addition, reading range experiments were conducted to confirm the predicted characteristics of the proposed antennas. Using the proposed antenna with the size of 11.0mm by 74.9mm, I have successfully demonstrated a reading range of 2.1 m. Furthermore, various environmental issues, such as temperature changes and the existence of barriers, were considered and tested. Thus, it can be said that I have validated the proposed meander antenna for UHF RFID reader that is small enough to be integrated into the mobile phone that requires low cost implementation.

CONTROL INNOVATIONS FOR QUADRIPLEGICS
Christopher Jozef Chopcian
Northern Collegiate Institute Vocational School, Sarnia, Ontario, CANADA

The purpose of this project is to develop a mobile Human Machine Interface (HMI) for people suffering from severe spinal cord injuries. The ultimate goal is to develop an innovation that will allow people who have limited body movements achieve more independence for themselves.<br><br>.<br><br>This innovation is designed around two (2) Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) inertial sensors. The sensors are worn on the head and simultaneously measure a person’s head movement along two different axis (up/down movement and left/right movement). A cheek activate touch switch allows the user to initiate mouse clicks. The combined output of the MEMS sensors and the check activated touch switch are sent to the mouse port of a computer. The complete system allows a person to control devices using only very slight head movements.<br><br>.<br><br>A series of functional tests were developed to test the performance of this innovation. The results of the functional tests showed that users could quickly develop accurate use of this device.<br><br>.<br><br>This innovation can be used as a Human / Machine Interface in a wide range of applications, such as an electric wheel chair controller, robotic surgery or control systems for astronauts during extra vehicular activities.<br><br>.<br><br>This project did confirm that a Human / Machine Interface (HMI) could be built to measure very slight head movements. The combination of several technologies like computer hardware and software offers a very flexible approach to this problem because software can be used to ‘customize’ the HMI for different users and different applications.

THE PRACTICAL UTILIZATION OF WIRELESS PROTOCOL AND SWARM MENTALITY TO IMPROVE OVERALL EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS IN AUTONOMOUS ROBOT PLATFORMS
Carl Edward Lawhon
Pembroke Hill School, Kansas City, MO

This study, utilizing the scientific method, analyzed whether autonomous robots can communicate and cooperate with each other in order to accomplish a “real world” task in an unstructured environment more efficiently and effectively than non-communicating robots. It was predicted that if three robotic agents utilize (1) an alternative, fluid, hybrid, cooperative mentality that is decentralized at times and centralized at others, (2) a simplified wireless communications network, and (3) several sensory capabilities, then they can, by cooperating with each other, accomplish a simple real-world task more economically and efficiently than when their communication and cooperation capabilities are not utilized. In addition, it was predicted that such hybrid wireless networks and command structures would be feasible and practical. The robots’ goals were to explore a field and find and travel to a shack placed at an arbitrary location. The tests of communicating and non-communicating robots amply revealed disparities in efficiency between robots that could communicate and those that could not. The robots’ efficiency and effectiveness were evaluated by the time taken for all three robots to accomplish their goals. It was determined that the multi-robot system that did not communicate and cooperate completed the task approximately two and a half times slower than the same multi-robot system utilizing hybrid wireless and command networks to enable cooperation and communication. It was ascertained that the hybrid wireless networks and command structures improved the efficiency of the multi-robot system and that they are feasible and effective for use in multi-robot systems.

MULTI-TOUCH TABLE: AN INFRARED-BASED TOUCH INTERFACE DESIGNED FOR COLLABORATIVE DATA MANIPULATION
Ritik Malhotra
Lynbrook High School, San Jose, CA

Purpose: Multi-touch sensing touch screens are rapidly revolutionizing the tech industry. With capabilities of sensing multiple touches at once, multi-touch screens are becoming useful for collaborative work and are becoming increasingly popular in corporate environments. The problem lies in the fact that affordable multi-touch products are far too small for the average consumer, while large-scale multi-touches cost too much, and cheap multi-touches have backlighting issues, making them unusable. This project is the construction of a large-scale multi-touch screen for an affordable price using a method based off of infrared light, while keeping the same functionality as a capacitance-based multi-touch.<br><br>Method: The multi-touch screen was constructed using an infrared-based detection system. An array of infrared light is shined into an acrylic glass sheet at a specific angle, causing the light to reflect inside the glass, bouncing up and down within it. Once a user touches the glass sheet, the light becomes “frustrated” and is reflected directly downwards at that spot. A webcam with its infrared filter removed, and connected to a laptop, is placed on the bottom of the table and is used to detect the infrared light at the spots where the user touches the glass, effectively sensing every point that the user touches.<br><br>Conclusion: The successful construction of my multi-touch showed that it was possible to achieve the same effect that a modern-day, capacitance-based, multi-touch screen achieves, but at less than ten percent of the cost (capacitance: $5,000+; infrared: $500). Next, it proved that multi-touch screens would no longer have any size limitations as long as they adhered to the infrared-based detection principle. Lastly, it showed that CCFL backlights could be used to light up the touch screen without causing major interference within the touch sensing system.<br><br>Further Applications: The multi-touch table can be used like any commercial, large-scale, multi-touch system. Small scale applications include photo viewers, musical composition, and entertainment systems. Large scale applications include large multi-touch tables for military operations, interactive business conferences, and government use.

FINE CONTROL OF ELECTROMAGNETIC LEVITATION, A SECOND YEAR STUDY
Christopher James King
Creek Wood High School, Charlotte, TN

The goal of this second year study was to design and build a levitator capable of repulsively and attractively suspending a permanent magnet in contactless equilibrium with gravity. This project surpassed last year’s work by allowing objects to be repulsively levitated and by providing a real time computer interface that allows for control of the levitated object. Construction of this project involved developments in three critical areas: First, a three-dimensional sensor array was designed to accurately sense the position of a permanent magnet in space. Secondly, a main controller board was designed to house four-channel input and output circuitry, as well as fully automated control and mixing functions. The main controller board also houses a serial-to-USB interface that allows for computer monitoring of the device’s function in real time. A third area addressed in this project was the fabrication of a custom CNC-machined electromagnetic head unit with eight permanent magnets, four fine control electromagnets, and a three-dimensional Hall effect sensing array. Custom software was written in C for input signal sampling and PWM output signal generation. This project showed that repulsive levitation is achievable provided a high-speed feedback loop is used. Separation distances of up to 1.5 inches between the levitator unit and the levitated magnet were achieved during testing. Possible applications of this project are in the fields of remote position sensing, materials handling in contaminated environments and with the addition of real time computer communications implemented in this device, in the field of precise force and vector measurement.

THE ICE BREAKER: AN AUXILIARY SLOW SPEED VEHICULAR BRAKING SYSTEM
Ian Charles Black
Black Homeschool, Williston, ND

The purpose of this experiment was to prove that it is possible to design and build an auxiliary braking system that increases the braking effectiveness of vehicles at slow speeds in slippery conditions. I researched to see if there was a similar braking system already in use. I then researched to see how many slow speed car accidents, injuries, and fatalities occurred every year in the United States as a result of slippery road conditions. I found out that, in 2005, there were 6,420,000 vehicular accidents. I then designed the “Ice Breaker System” using state-of-the-art CAD software. I created two braking pads using two different materials: plastic and aluminum. These pads would be pneumatically lowered to frictionally contact the surface of the road. I then created a testing system that would allow me to determine the coefficients of friction for a standard car tire, the plastic braking pad, and the aluminum braking pad. In order to further develop my project, I tested all three objects on three different surface conditions: compact snow, compact ice, and wet ice.<br><br> By using the test results and multiple formulas, I was able to determine the stopping distance of a 3500 lb car sliding at 15 mph on multiple surfaces with and without my two braking pad systems. <br><br> The test results showed a significant advantage when using the aluminum ice braking pad; however, the plastic braking pad failed in comparison to the standard tire in all but the compact snow test.<br><br> I conclude that my hypothesis was correct. A system was successfully designed and engineered that reduced the stopping distance for a vehicle sliding on compact snow, compact ice, and wet ice. By improving the effective braking force of a vehicle, fewer accidents and injuries should result.

USING WASTED HEAT ENERGY OF A CAR WITH THERMOELECTRIC MODULES
Thomas Keith Houser
De La Salle High School, Concord, CA

I completed this project to find out how much power could be generated from the wasted heat of a car through the use of thermoelectric modules. The first step was to determine where a large quantity of wasted heat was being released from the car. Once I determined that the exhaust pipe was the most accessible place on the car releasing large quantities of heat, I attached a thermoelectric module to capture the wasted energy. With the module mounted on the exhaust pipe I ran thermocouple wires and copper wires to the front passenger seat to allow recording of the temperature differential and voltage output while the car was in motion. Power generated was calculated from voltage produced multiplied by current produced as a result of the temperature differential on opposite sides of the thermoelectric module. The first test with a thermoelectric module on the exhaust pipe generated an average power output of about 0.025 watts with a peak power output of about 0.064watts. I used aluminum foil to increase the heated surface area in contact with the module to improve power generation. The average power generated with this improvement was 0.099 watts with a peak power of 0.258 watts. My experimentation allowed me to determine that a reasonable amount of power can be generated through this method of using otherwise wasted energy. At this time not enough electrical power is generated to supply all electrical needs of a car, but with further advances in the technology it possibly could.

A MOBILE AUTONOMOUS CHEMICAL DETECTING ROBOT
Anna Kornfeld Simpson
Patrick Henry High School, San Diego, CA

A robotic chemical detector, moving and responding to dangerous chemicals without human presence or control, could help save lives. <br><br> My objective was to create an autonomous mobile chemical detecting robot. Building upon the basic sensor prototype I made last year, I had to increase sensitivity, make vapor movement autonomous, speed up response and integrate the sensor onto a mobile chassis. I hypothesized that I could improve the sensitivity by a factor of 10 using more complicated circuitry, address movement and speed with a fan, and produce a mobile robot to autonomously detect chemical in real time.<br><br> I added an op-amp, resistors and voltage regulators into the sensor circuit to increase sensitivity, limit drift, and improve signal stability. Tests showed limited noise and range in the baseline, and a signal change more than 20 times the baseline when chemical was introduced, far more than was hypothesized. Even concentrations only of 5% ethanol changed the signal markedly. The fan caused almost immediate detection and was placed with the sensor on a mobile chassis. After programming the robot to run autonomously, I had the robot move over some ethanol placed on the ground. It consistently and accurately detected and responded to the presence of chemical in real time!<br><br> My product is a mobile robot that can sense chemical spills on the ground below it autonomously and in real time. The program can be adapted to implement a variety of algorithms for searching and response, as needed for applications in industry, security and counterterrorism.

SPREAD-A-NATOR
Gregory Wayne Lorino
Mary G. Montgomery High School, Semmes, AL

The purpose of this project was to see how the addition of a shaft to a fertilizer spreader would improve the spreader’s distribution pattern. It was predicted that the addition of a shaft would improve the distribution pattern of the spreader. <br><br>The hypothesis was tested by comparing the performance of a spreader that was equipped with a shaft (variable) to a spreader that did not contain a shaft (control). Prior to testing the spreaders, an area was set up to collect the dispensed fertilizer. The area consisted of a grid of plastic cups arranged in a square pattern. Fertilizer was then applied to the grid for a period of ten seconds on two separate occasions for both the variable and control. Fertilizer granules were then counted in each of the cups located in the grid to define the dispersion pattern and dispersion density.<br><br>Results of the experiment revealed that the spreader equipped with a shaft produced a pattern that covered an average area of 12 square feet, while the spreader without a shaft produced a pattern that covered an average area of 70 square feet. The fertilizer density in each cup for the spreader with the shaft averaged 33 granules per cup, while the spreader without a shaft averaged 19 granules per cup. Based on these results, the hypothesis was correct suggesting that the addition of a shaft to a fertilizer spreader will improve the spreader’s performance.

PROTOTYPE SOLAR-POWERED LIQUID PISTON ENGINE
Kelly Maria Kleier
Notre Dame Academy, Park Hills, KY

The purpose of this research was to construct an engine fueled by a heat source such as the sun to pump water. It was expected that such an engine would be useful for water pumping or as an irrigation system in a developing country. Four model engines were assembled and their operation improved on a trial-and-error basis. The air in the hot side was heated to create a temperature difference between the heating and cooling lines, generating pressure differences and creating oscillations that would enable pumping of water. Oscillations were able to be sustained with Model #3. Plots of displacement vs. time for these oscillations show that cooling column and output column oscillations were in step with one another, and exactly out of step with the heated line. A pumping line with two one-way valves was added in the fourth model. So far no pumping action has been achieved and troubleshooting is underway.

ADAPTIVE FILTERING OF LIDAR DATA TO PRESERVE STREAM BANK MORPHOLOGY
William Benjamin Haber
Dr. Michael M. Krop Senior High School, Miami, FL

The plan for this experiment was how to use lidar to forecast severe flooding near urban areas. Airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) sensors transmit thousands of laser pulses towards the ground per second. By measuring position of the aircraft along with the arrival times of reflected pulses, accurate positions for each laser return can be determined. Without occluding vegetation, topography can be directly measured in decimeters by using DEM’s (digital elevation models). When occluding vegetation is present the DEM’s from it must be filtered out to reveal the ground surface. This process often removes numerous points in the surface topography (i.e. stream channels and ridge lines) which causes a loss of detail around the aforementioned features and precludes proper scientific analysis of flooding and surface erosion. <br><br> To solve this, the researcher developed an approach that allowed the filter to preserve more detail along stream channels. It consisted of an initial filtering step that was optimized to reveal stream channels under vegetation. An automated morphological operation detected ground surface DEM’s of stream channels, wrote a binary mask pixel set (an operation which isolated the stream channel), and re-ran the DEM for optimization of smoothness away from the channels and detail near the channels. There was one main conclusion that I drew from this experiment. Lidar is an emerging technology that allows scientists to preserve key details along stream channels. These results will allow the military’s engineering core to better calculate flooding logistics of watersheds to protect urban areas from flooding.

THE UNDERGROUND RADIO II
Alexander Kent Kendrick
Los Alamos High School, Los Alamos, NM

An Underground Radio can be used for cave and mine rescues, radiolocation, underground imaging, and detection of coal and petroleum and for monitoring an underground microclimate. In this project, I designed, built and tested in actual caves a new two way digital Underground Radio demonstrating an operational goal of a 300m range through limestone. This system enabled the first digital and deepest communication through rock in the history of Carlsbad Caverns (200m). By using an optimal frequency of 23.4 kHz, the radio is now able to send two way digital communication using a microcontroller with C and Assembly programs. The transmitter design was based on an efficient Class-E amplifier. A sensitive receiver circuit was designed to decode messages with a very low signal. Both the transmitter and receiver circuits were modeled by SPICE in order to optimize the performance. Field tests on the surface determined that the radio was able to receive digital text messaging at a range of 400m. The radios were then tested in three caves: Cottonwood, Black, and Carlsbad Caverns, New Mexico. Two way digital text messaging was established at 200m (650ft) in the Left Hand Tunnel. Based on the signal strength measurements in the caves, an attenuation rate of about 0.03 dB/m was measured. For my transmit power, antenna coupling and receiver sensitivity this attenuation rate results in a maximum underground range of about 275m (902ft) through limestone.

REEDS, HALLS, AND OPTICS: A THREE-YEAR DISCOURSE
Andrew Garrett Amis
Clinton High School, Clinton, MS

During the pending year of study, novel developments include the design and production of multiple brushless direct-current synchronous electric motors. The harmonized classification consists of a mutually-oriented bilateral motor configuration in addition to two supplementary concomitant, plesiochronous prototypes, founded upon an aggregate quaternary electromagnet permutation in axial succession of the archetypes developed in the previous two years of engineering inquiry: a reed switch motor, a transistor-based motor, a Hall effect motor, and an optocoupler motor. A vehicular paradigm harmonizing dual reed switch rotors serves to substantiate the prospect of integration into the sustainable transportation sphere. Throughout the experimental trials, the bilateral dipole and the quaternary combinatorial motors yielded over one thousand collective measurements. The line of investigation included: cost, complexity, reliability, acceleration, revolutions per minute, relative torque, maximum parasitic load, and efficiency. Manipulated variables included: voltage, gauge of wire, quantity of rotor magnets, quantity of electromagnets, magnet configuration, motor configuration, rotor size, and velocity control. Analysis of the results substantiated both nominally linear and exponential correlations between the experimental parameters, demonstrating their relative influence on cogent functional capacity. Supplementary disquisition includes microprocessor and computer control systems, magnetic vector flux density, core saturation, sustainable generation, torque harmonics, and multi-domain analytic modeling of dynamic systems. An avenue for alternative energy, these electric motors can be industrially produced, providing an impetus for virtually any rotary mechanism. A pragmatic solution to the pending environmental impasse, this development has the capacity to counter the ill effects of human-generated GHG emissions, revolutionizing industry in its entirety.

DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF LOW COST NANO-STRUCTURED SOLAR CELLS
Siteng Ma
Little Rock Central High School, Little Rock, AR

Low power efficiency and high production cost are the two major problems associated with solar cells that prevent their wide applications. This project demonstrates fabrication of novel nano-structured solar cell, which operates on the heterojunctions between CdTe, CdSe, and CdS semiconductor nanocrystals and single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNT). The overall fabrication process is simple, economic, and environmentally benign, making the solar cell suitable for mass production. The use of semiconductor nanocrystals and SWNT as the precursors would allow formation of 3-d networking p-n junctions, and thus greatly enhance the efficiency.

READY OR NOT? THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NONDESTRUCTIVE RIPENESS INDICATOR
Brianna Leilani Bourgeois
Lutcher High School, Lutcher, LA

Each year money is wasted on fruit and vegetables that are overripe; as a result of this, I decided to create a machine that could determine a fruit's level of ripeness. To determine the level of ripeness, I used a fiber-optic UV light source and a spectrometer. Since this is my first year working on the project, I decided that I should test oranges first because they are inexpensive. I designed a machine that would slowly rotate an orange to make it possible to scan all sides. The machine is covered and painted black so that no outside light affects the readings. I tested twenty oranges; the first ten were tested two weeks after the second ten. I did this to be sure that half of the oranges were overripe.

THE SKY IS FALLING
Dylan Taylor Cockerham
Kapa'a High School, Kapa'a, HI

My project is about the relationship between an object’s shape and the amount of force it absorbs. The experiment tested the amount of force felt by a Vertical Drop Car when it had different foam bumpers attached, each of which had a unique curve. I used a total of five foam bumpers, with radii of 8, 9, 11, 13, and 15 cm. Originally I had planned on using 7 cm instead of 8 cm, but the 7 cm bumper ended up with a different shape than the rest, which would’ve produced inconsistent data. The Drop Car was constructed out of PVC, with angle irons attached for the purpose of holding the bumpers. To measure the force of the drops, I used a Dual-Range Force Sensor with a 55-gram lead fishing weight attached to it. The Drop Car was released from a height of 57 cm, using a metal rod to keep it steady during the fall. 57 cm wasn’t my original choice for a height, but after some testing I found that 57 cm was the perfect height for producing data within the range of the Force Sensor.<br><br>For the sake of accuracy I set the Force Sensor to take readings 300 times per second. I performed five tests with each bumper, then found the peak values from each test, and averaged the peak values for each bumper. From there I went on to calculate the standard deviation for each set of values. Based on my data, I’ve come to the conclusion that curves with a larger radius (flatter curves) absorb more force than curves with a shorter radius (more pointed curves). However, my data appeared to curve back slightly with my smallest radius, so further testing is necessary to fully confirm this.

NEGATIVE FEEDBACK INCORPORATED IN AN AUTONOMOUS OPTICALLY-GUIDED ROBOTIC ARM
Emily Jane Schultheis
Glenelg High School, Glenelg, MD

This study evaluated the use of machine vision feedback to autonomously guide a custom robotic arm to touch an arbitrary target. The hypothesis was that optical feedback would systematically reduce absolute error when sequentially positioning the arm relative to the target. <br><br>Two parallel miniature web cameras were mounted on a custom robotic arm driven by three stepper motors. The system incorporated optical template matching and determination of distance to a target by binocular observations along parallel axes using the geometry of similar triangles. The arm had freedom of movement in yaw, pitch, and depth. The optical template was based upon target color and size but excluded shape to enable matching when the target was viewed from different angles. The median of serially calculated target coordinates were used to position the arm in the horizontal and vertical plane to reduce outlier commands from 9% to 1%.<br><br>The experiment focused on comparing depth position error of the robotic arm relative to the target after an initial assessment to the final position of the arm following repeated machine vision as feedback.<br><br>The initial range error in positioning the robotic arm was 7.3cm + 5.9 cm (mean + SD) and declined to 4.4 + 4.5 cm over three iterations. This reduction in error was a promising trend, but failed to achieve overall statistical significance (ANOVA; p = 0.25).<br><br>Further work to reduce error may include mechanical reinforcement to reduce influence of stepper motor vibration, and reducing step size of positioning motors.

SHOW ME YOUR LICENSE
Ahmed Samir Rashed
Sidi Gaber Language School for Boys, Alexandria, EGYPT

The scope of this research is to study the problem of car driving by unauthorized people, the matter that involves a great danger to the road.<br><br> The idea is to implement certain security system inside the car that prevents the car from starting until the driver shows a registered driving license, the matter that will help preventing anyone from being able to drive the car except those authorized and registered persons in the system.<br><br>The system consists of a small special-purpose computer connected to a barcode reader will read license code and compare it with the registered codes in its database. In case of match, the car starting circuit will be activated for normal operation; otherwise the car will give no response to any trial of operation.<br><br> This will solve nearly 20% of the car accidents problem as one of each five fatal car crashes includes an unlicensed driver. Also driving without a license is one of high school students' bad attitudes. 1 in 25 9th, 10th, and 11th graders in the United States make the dangerous decision to drive solo (without adult supervision) at least an hour each week without a driver's license. However, according to the national fatality data, a full 20 percent of 14- to 18-year-old drivers involved in fatal crashes in 2006 did not have a license.<br><br>This system will prevent them from doing so, not this only; this system will reduce the percentage of deaths between youth as 53% of the deaths between youth is due to unlicensed drivers. <br><br>Moreover, the system will help preventing cars stealing, as the car without showing the license will appear dead as the starting circuit is deactivated.

INTELLIGENT SAFE ROADS (ISR)
Abdulmohsen Mohammed Albelushi

The purpose of the Intelligent Safe Road (ISR) project is to device a solution to the increasing number to over-speeding traffic accidents problem. The designed system is based on the hypothesis that if the amount of fuel injected to the car engine is controlled and limited, the limit of car speed can be set to a pre-defined value, therefore, reducing the number of accidents due to over speeding car accidents.<br><br>The ISR system works by installing a wireless receiver in the Engine Control Unit (ECU) used in cars. Such receiver will serve as a speed limiting device in cars. <br><br>It is known that maximum amount of fuel injected into car engine is controlled by ECU. Therefore, speed of cars is ultimately controlled by the amount of fuel injected in engines. <br><br>A speed-limiting transmitter device is installed on the sideway of roads with speed limits such as near hospitals and schools. This device will transmit a radio signal (with information about maximum allowed speed) that covers the neighborhood. Such signal will be received by ISR radio receiver which enables the ECU to limit the amount of fuel injected into car fuel injection system to a value corresponding to the maximum allowed speed.<br><br>For testing purposes, a model of ISR system was built using LEGO NXT controller and a gasoline fuel injection system for RC car.<br><br>Experiments were done on a model system and results were promising. The concept was proven as the opening of the throttle valve of the RC car engine was found responsive to the speed limit set by a Bluetooth transmitter and receiver. <br><br>ISR can be utilized to control the maximum speed for cars to avoid over-speeding accidents. In addition, ISR can be further developed to be utilized by police cars to enforce suspicious vehicles to stop or slow down at check points or for inspection.

ELECTRONIC LIFEGUARD BUDDY WIRELESS ALARMING DEVICE TO PREVENT KIDS FROM RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SWIMMING POOLS
Hind Saleh Alhumaimidi

Swimming pools offer great fun venues for kids and families. Yet, the risks associated with swimming pools are becoming increasingly apparent. It is found that children drowning is the 2nd leading cause of injury-related deaths among children ages 1-14. This is mainly due to the unawareness of the adults about their children falling in swimming pools/lakes. In other words, the challenge is to alert adults of possible drowning threats to their children.<br><br> <br><br>The Electronic Lifeguard Buddy is a device designed to provide an alarming solution for parents to be aware of their kids while not necessarily seeing them.<br><br>The device uses two independent circuits that communicate wirelessly. The first circuit is the one fitted in the bottom of the kid's shoe. This circuit is an open circuit with a transmitter. The circuit becomes active when the kid steps into water. <br><br>This, in turn, operates an ultra-sonic unit that measures the depth of water. If the water level is deeper than a prescribed level, a transmitter unit sends a signal to the receiving device. The second device is basically a circuit connected to an audible alarm. The signal will be translated into a loud voice alarming the adults of a potential drowning threat. Needless to say, adults are supposed to keep this receiver with them all the time. <br><br>Electronic Lifeguard Buddy is a a very economical and practical solution that is quite helpful for every family having a swimming pool, or simply planning for a water-front trip.

A SIMPLE SEAT TO SAVE A LIFE
Tyler Benjamin Odle
Catholic High School, Huntsville, AL

The purpose of this project was to design an electro-mechanical circuit that would activate a car alarm if a child was left in a car seat and the internal temperature of the automobile exceeded 43 degrees celsius. The circuit consisted of two pressure sensors, a thermostat, a 12V power source, two timer relays, a wireless key/alarm and a buzzer. The pressure sensor needed to be sensitive enough to detect an infant with a minimum weight of 1.86 kg. The thermostat needed to be able to sense when the internal temperature of the automobile became dangerous and the purpose of the warning buzzer was to indicate danger by providing an audible alarm. The pressure switches were used to determine the presence of a child in the car seat and if the dangerous situation continued, the car alarm was activated by the wireless remote. This experiment was powered by a 12-volt power supply (two 6-volt battery holders). Testing determined that the circuit would detect a dangerous situation and activate the car alarm as desired.

SMART FIRE DETECTOR ELECTRONIC SOLUTION FOR AUTOMATIC REPORTING OF FIRES FOR SAFER & BETTER PROTECTED FACILITIES
AbdulRahman F AlFozan
Ibn Baz High School, Dammam, Eastern, SAUDI ARABIA

This research project (Smart Fire Detector, shortly named SFD) aims to find an alternative solution for traditional methods used for automatic reporting of fire incidents by utilizing the existing technologies of Google Earth and GPS in a short time and specific location of the fire.<br><br>Delayed fire incidents reports or inaccurate reporting information (including location) could result in late arrival of firemen, increased number of fatalities and extended damages to facilities and homes. <br><br>SFD system consists of report sender device (hardware) and report receiver program (software). The report sender is a modified smoke detector retrofitted with an external electronic circuit that sends a wireless signal to an intermediate receiver box (containing a dialing circuit) once a fire is detected. <br><br>The intermediate receiver box (installed in facility) dials in a predefined emergency phone number (i.e. civil defense or related fire response authority) to report fire at once. At the fire authority, the phone call is received via a receiver system (consists of a computer and a special programmed software). This system identifies the caller ID and retrieves the coordinates from the customer’s database. The system then obtains accurate location promptly using Google Earth. <br><br>It was found that, fire detectors reduced average time needed for acknowledgment of fire to less than one minute (20%) and less than two minutes (80%). This is a significant improvement compared to human detecting by visual observation. It was also noted that SFD reduced the time used in the process of reporting to less than 30 seconds (10%) and less than one minute (90%). This is a significant improvement compared to human reporting using phone calling.<br><br>SFD also showed very accurate location reporting due to utilization of GPS and Google Earth (proven technologies) to locate fire sites. <br><br>

PERSONAL AUDIO DISRUPTION DEVICE
Matthew Taylor Stegall, Grant Matthew Edwards, 
HBS Academy, Charlotte, NC

Our global transportation systems have become increasingly congested and dangerous. In 2004, 1.2 million individuals were killed and 50 million were injured worldwide. This problem includes drivers, cyclists and pedestrians all using busy transportation infrastructures, competing for the same space. Conditions of these accidents vary, but eliminating risk factors can help improve safety. Concentration is key to safety. Distraction, especially related to using a personal audio device, is a major contributor and risk factor associated with many accidents. In America alone, eight out of ten crashes involve driver distraction due to hi-tech gadgets, including personal audio devices. People wearing ear buds or headphones put themselves in great peril. By blocking distracting sounds, the earpieces prevent horns and sirens from the ear canal. The purpose of this engineering project was to design, construct and develop a device to disrupt a personal audio system’s output signal upon the detection of a vehicle horn or siren to prevent injury and loss of life. The Personal Audio Disruption Device (PADD) was designed and constructed using common, recycled materials and modified after testing to meet the design goals. The researchers observed that the first version worked with mixed results but the final version, however, disrupted the audio output 100% of the time for the car horn, train whistle, ambulance, police, and fire truck sirens. With repeated testing, redesign, and modifications, the Personal Audio Disruption Device improved and was fully functional and met the design goals, therefore having real world applications for preventing injury or death.

The complexity units are parental to the simpler ones controlling the motion. They give full status reports to the operator. The remote control has a sufficient range. During manipulation without visual contact, the robot camera provides a good help reporting information about the position and status of the robot.<br><br>The camera is also used in another mode, when the built-in computer takes all the control over. Therefore it needs no communication with the operator, and the robot is able to fulfill the task.<br><br>For all above mentioned features is important the feedback of the actual position of the robot individual mechanical parts. This information is necessary in no visual contact situations, and also for the robot operating in autonomic mode. <br><br>When selecting materials and blueprints of particular parts we tried to achieve easy technical and cheap construction, a result comparable with semi – professional machines.

Indoor air quality is a very significant concern. Mold and bacterial growth in HVAC systems in buildings have negatively impacted the health of millions worldwide. Leaking ductwork drive ventilation costs as well as attribute to systemic microbial infections that lead to sick building syndrome. A portable, multitasking robotic system designed to monitor and disinfect ductwork could help keep people healthy while at the same time help monitor energy efficiency in buildings. For this project, a robot capable of holding a UV light was modified to include wireless data transmission, sonar navigation, and an air quality sensor. It was hypothesized that the UV-C exposure duration that will produce a LD-100 for Aspergillus niger will be greater than 18 minutes. The engineering goals for this project were:<br><br>Goal 1: The robot will determine distance from either side of the ductwork using ultrasonic sensor<br><br>Goal 2: The robot will monitor air quality<br><br>Goal 3: The robot will transmit temperature and humidity data<br><br>Goal 4: Using PING))) data, the robot will modify its heading in ductwork autonomously without touching either wall<br><br>Goal 5: Consolidate circuitry of navigation and safety switch to one board<br><br>Goal 6: Modify light activated safety switch through programming enhancements for more reliable response<br><br>The research hypothesis stated that the UV-C exposure duration that will produce a LD-100 for Aspergillus niger will be greater than 18 minutes. The data did not support the hypothesis and the hypothesis was rejected. All engineering goals were met with 100% success.

NOVEL CONTROL METHODOLOGIES FOR CONSERVING ENERGY WITH ELECTROCHROMIC WINDOWS
Amruth Venkatraman, Navaneeth Ravindranath, 
R. C. Clark High School, Plano, TX

Much energy is wasted in the cooling of buildings due to radiation from the sun. Preventing the solar energy from entering the buildings will reduce the building cooling loads, which is achieved by using electrochromic (EC) windows. The glass panes are composed of materials, which aid in changing the window tint by application of low electrical input. <br><br>To develop different methodologies for controlling EC devices, the window was characterized with a lux meter. The characterization was used to make a scale linking a goal temperature to a specific lux value. This goal-oriented control was modeled by the equation y = 5E-11x3-5E-07x2+0.0021x+28.692. An alternative control was developed following an on-off method, resulting in quicker responses to the goal temperature by 26 minutes; however, this control has continuous oscillations. The goal-oriented control could be used in commercial buildings in moderate climates to promote visual comfort and regulate temperatures, while the on-off control should be used in extreme climates. The EC window was found to reduce the rise in temperature of the enclosure by 6.4oC in comparison to a clear glass window. The EC has a 46.7% efficiency based on the ratio between the aforementioned difference and the ΔT between the temperature reached with a clear glass window and room temperature.<br><br>The use of EC windows in the Texas public school system saves nearly 3 billion pounds of CO2 in emissions each year and monetary savings of over $250,000,000 per year. Calculations indicate a Return on Investment of 7 years with electrochromic windows.

A COMPARISON OF THE EFFICIENCY OF PHOTOVOLTAIC PANEL DESIGNS
Lauren Ashley Choate, Abigale Berry, 
Farmington Senior High School, Farmington, MO

In a world of high energy consumption, research regarding alternative energy sources becomes imperative to the management of natural resources. The purpose of this experiment is to test the efficiency of different designs of photovoltaic panels to discover which type of solar cell provides the most energy output and use this information to determine which solar cell is most cost efficient for consumers. Different presentations of solar panels could maximize its energy output. This experiment involves the construction of four solar panel mounts, each with a panel angled at 62 degrees. These test groups include a control panel with no additions, a panel with mirrors angled at 45 degrees on each side, a panel with a biconvex lens placed above it, and a self-engineered solar tracker. The unique properties of the materials in the mounting of each design increase its energy output by a different method. In testing, each solar cell design is placed facing south from 7:00am to 6:00pm. The voltage of each cell is recorded at 30 minute intervals. The hypothesis is that the solar tracking device will produce the highest average of voltage during the eleven hour period. Data reveals, however, that the mirror test group produced the greatest voltage on average throughout each trial. It produced 16 percent more volts than the control, while the solar tracker produced only nine percent more volts than the control. When compared with cost and practicality of design, however, the solar tracker was established as the best option for homeowners.

High-speed railways have developed rapidly in China. However, the dynamic test for the vertical and horizontal displacement of railway tracks while the express train is traveling still lags behind. The project aims at an accurate and quick method to solve the problem above.<br><br>With the help of railway experts and the reference to technical regulations on high-speed railways test issued by Ministry of Railway, the view is put forward that the function of horizontal distance measurement by laser distance meter can be converted to the dynamic measurement of vertical and horizontal displacement of railways with the 45-degree angle reflection plane of an isosceles right triangle as a measuring medium.<br><br>The dynamic measurement error is smaller than 1.0 mm, which is in accord with measuring standards issued by Ministry of Railway. <br><br>The dynamic measurement will instruct the railway departments to correct errors, improve work efficiency and maintenance quality, prolong the life-span of railways and eventually make high-speed railway journeys more comfortable.

A MECHANICAL MENTOR: DEVELOPING AN ASSISTIVE AID FOR THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS
Kyle Wells McCann, Mohit Tiwari, 
Yorktown High School, Yorktown Heights, NY

Biofeedback is defined as a technique in which patients are trained through the use of feedback signals to gain partial voluntary control over certain physiological conditions. Instantaneous biofeedback is critical in gaining motor neuron control and learning how to complete a movement. When a movement is completed, i.e. a physical therapy patients bending and extending his or her leg, the patient must be able to tell whether he or she completed the movement correctly or incorrectly, which requires the aid of a physical therapist monitoring the patient. Our goal was to develop a device that would provide instantaneous biofeedback to aid patients in the process of learning various specific movements. Using Virtools 3D modeling software, we were able to create a device that provided instantaneous biofeedback to the patients as to whether he or she had completed a movement successfully or unsuccessfully in 3D space. The input device was a Wii Remote, which was strapped to subjects’ limbs and transmitted information via Bluetooth communications to a PC. The results showed that the participants completed a significantly higher proportion of successful movements after practicing with our device than without. Our Mechanical Mentor was successful in providing instantaneous biofeedback that aided the participants in completing movements, as is evident by our statistically significant results with a p-value of 4.57E-12. Thus, we were able to create a cost-effective assistive device which provides instantaneous biofeedback and allows patients to see their movement in 3D space, therefore making therapy sessions more successful.

Colegio Tecnico Profesional de San Sebastian, San Jose, COSTA RICA

The aim of this project is to obtain the optimization of a machine that produces carbon nanotubes with at a voltaic arch of low frequency. Its operation consists of generating the necessary temperature through a voltaic arc to create plasma in order to obtain carbon nanotubes. <br><br> <br><br>One of the improvements made to the production process is the construction of a direct current power supply source, the construction of a refrigeration system, a suction pump system, the cathode rotor, an encapsulation system, an ultraviolet filter, a sample collection system, automation through contactors, a safety disconnect system and the use of reusable material for their construction. The procedure to create the electric arc at a low frequency utilizes six electrodes that rotate slowly by means of a controlled reducer motor through a variable frequency drive and an electrode placed on the top with a worm gear that allows its control to bring it near the other electrodes at the moment of producing the arc. The argon provides a controlled atmosphere and impedes the influence of external agents, while enabling the ionization of the gas due to the high temperatures, creating the plasma, and therefore, the carbon nanotubes. Through hoses, the nanotubes are conducted to a container with ethanol by means of a vacuum pump. <br><br><br>A characterization carried out through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the material obtained corresponds to the expected one.

Computerized Braille translator provides accessibility alternatives to digital information sources for blind and deaf blind individuals through dynamic text transformation into tactile shapes. It inherits natural advantages of Braille over audio based systems. Normally those belong to expensive devices not easily accessible. These access limitations must be overcome through the power of creative ideas in this unattractive investments area.<br><br>The overall operation of this device is simple: there is a software designed to provide an easy access to information, it guides the users according to their needs, it interprets hot key based commands, as well it extracts characters from different sources, then the information is sent across a parallel port to an external device which consists of an acrylic enclosure with six coils that act like electromagnets which are used to attract a set of small metallic plates, along with the six pins used to simulate the Braille symbol ( 6-dot system). Then the user places his finger on top of the symbol to read the information in Braille.<br><br>Among the current implemented options users will be able to read text and PDF files, websites, retrieve emails. Our ongoing project has shown with great success economical and technological feasibility.<br><br>Neither expensive equipments nor cutting edge technologies were needed. Our first prototype was built with components found in our workshop, utilized in a creative fashion that allowed the device cost to remain under $100 USD. Tests with visual impaired people got reflected on this year’s enhancements and continue to provide recommendations for future development.

Starting from OpenHexapods' core, which in our case it is an Asus EeePC netbook, we built up a robot which gives us a great flexibility. <br><br>The robot is a hexapod. By having 6 legs, it can move faster, on any type of terrain, while remaining stable. For moving, the whole device must have at least 3 feet on the ground, while the others are in the air, moving. <br><br>This way it can go with speeds up to 0.5 meters/second (1.6 feets/second). Also a very important part of the robot is the multifunctional arm. It carries the video camera and some white LEDs, for both day and night seeing. The 5 LEDs are enough to light up a room, so the device can be used even in complete darkness. The camera allows the user to see what is around the robots sees, from different perspectives. <br><br>One can control the robot, moving and rotating it, and seeing things in detail by moving and rotating the arm with the camera. Because of the 6-legged structure, it can be sent on any terrain, in any conditions, by day or night. <br><br>The uses are practically unlimited, beginning from home-entertainment usage, geological exploration, military or law enforcement usage, and even to industrial manufacturing or military usage. With some small enhancements, it can be controlled not just by wifi, but by cell phone (via GSM networks), or via satellite, operating at huge distances.

WIRELESS POWER TRANSFER: A NEW APPROACH TOWARDS RENEWABLE ENERGY FOR THE FUTURE
Megan Malie Kurohara, Kelson A. Lau, 
Hilo High School, Hilo, HI

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the feasibility of wireless power transmission. Two different wireless power transmission systems that NASA has proposed were compared to see which was the most effective when factoring in cost, feasibility, flexibility, implementation time, and power generation. The first system is called the Solar Power Satellite (SPS) and would be a large, power generation satellite in outer space. The second system is the Stratospheric Airship Platforms for Wireless Energy Transmission (SAPWET). It uses a median relay point in the air to allow transmission from ground point to ground point. The system predicted to be most effective overall was SAPWET.<br><br>To test the hypothesis, a wireless energy transfer system was built. This was used to create a graph of how much power was transferred over different distances. The output current from the rectenna was tested at one foot intervals until it was out of range from the power source. This current reading was used to calculate the voltage output which when combined with the current output, yields the power output.<br><br> The graph of the output power was a polynomial graph. At closer distances, the output power was more efficient than at longer distances. A table was drawn up to determine which system was better in each of the five criteria. SAPWET proved to be the best in all five and was concluded to be the most efficient system.

Cameras, camcorders and cell phones are commonly used to capture people’s happy moments of people nowadays. However, these pictures not only can capture your image but also your privacy. According to our research, it was found that an object could be seen through if infrared light camera function was used when people took photos even from a great distance. This means underwear, wallets, money can all be seen if infrared light is used while photos are being taken. This is definitely of interest to criminals.<br><br>This project is to design a device, See-through Camera Jammer (STCJ), to interfere with the light reflection of an object through infrared night shot technology. We found that our technology can be used to develop new security measures to hinder illegal actions of voyeurs and others with malicious intentions.<br><br>We looked at the theory of optics and analyzed the merits and the weaknesses of similar products available in the market. The research proceeded according to the design process. After several tests, it was determined that IR LEDs could be used to make an ornament like device. The IR LED lights of the ornament interfere with the infrared light of cameras and overexpose the image. The image then becomes blurred. The effectiveness of STCJ is definitely better than any other similar products in the market and the ornament designed STCJ can surely be catered for different people’s needs or for people attending different social occasions.

Escola Profissional Gustave Eiffel, Amadora, PORTUGAL

During the past years we can note a significant increase in the number of applications for the blimps. Not only the traditional scientific applications but applications in fields so different as publicity or the transport of heavy and very sensitive materials.<br><br> In this work, we have studied the blimp evolution and his historic importance in different societies. At the same time we had studied different kinds of propulsion system, their evolution and the different kinds of sensors used for implementing stabilization mechanisms.<br><br> We will present in this work a system for remote vigilance based in a blimp with a very special shape that gives him a very low aerodynamic coefficient . This way we get a blimp very more manoeuvrable and with great liberty of movements than a conventional blimp. The entire system, here purposed consists in a blimp with the shape of a UFO, his control and propulsion system and a console system with a TFT.<br><br> For the effect we have developed a generic board based on a microcontroller from Microcip: PIC18F8722, and the respective control software. We also developed a control algorithm based on using gyroscope and acelerometers sensors to help a non specialized user to drive the blimp and also to improve is stability. A protocol of communication has been also developed to assure a communication channel free of errors.

CLAMPED BOTTLE CAP -A NOVEL TAMPER-PROOF BOTTLE CAP DESIGN
Debarghya Sarkar, Anish Mukherjee, 
South Point High School, Kolkata, West Bengal, INDIA

Our project Clamped Bottle Cap is a novel redesign for a bottle cap, preventing its reuse. This can curb widespread bottle forgery, especially in critical areas like single-use medicinal applications.<br><br>We initially designed a bottle-cap with a ring having hooks. These cling on to the holes in bottle-neck. The attachment mechanism breaks off when the cap is opened. In our next improved design these hooks were changed to Zip-Toggle-like mechanism. This too posed problems regarding the fitting of the bottle-cap, so we converted to cylindrical-projections and circlip mechanism. We have further improved this in our final optimized design.<br><br>In the optimized design we have eight cylindrical projections attached to the bottle cap. The bottle neck is joined by small bridges to the neck base. The cap with the cylindrical projections is slid in through the slots of the neck. The projections enter the eight corresponding holes in the neck and are held tightly in place. When the cap is twisted the projections of the cap do not break but the entire neck of the bottle is broken off. This mechanism also give a clear indication that the bottle has been opened before, making the bottle tamper-proof. <br><br>To test the feasibility of our idea, we contacted a rapid prototyping workshop who fabricated a few samples based on our drawings. <br><br>To extend the bottle for multiple-use in specific cases, another threaded neck is provided, attached by small bridges below the original neck. A separate cap will be provided for use with the threaded portion of the bottle neck which fits only when the upper neck is broken.<br><br>This mechanism serves as a remedy for the major problem of bottle-forgery.

AN ALTERNATIVE LIGHTING SOLUTION: AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE USE OF LEDS AS A METHOD OF LIGHTING AND EFFECTIVE WAYS OF SAVING ENERGY
Andrew Alphonse Rossignol, Alexandru Stan, 
Cardinal Newman Catholic Secondary School, Stoney Creek, Ontario, CANADA

The purpose of this project was to design an LED based lighting system to be used as a substitute for fluorescent based systems.<br><br>The final product of this experiment was a functioning LED based lamp that uses substantially less energy than a fluorescent lamp. The LED bulbs are designed to run on low voltage systems including solar or wind based power sources. While this system's primary function is to save energy in areas where an energy infrastructure is established, it could be equally effective in off-grid locations such as third world countries and rural areas.<br><br>To enhance the performance of the LED bulbs, a microcontroller based control module was also designed. The control module performs many important functions such as off-peak battery charging, monitoring battery state and central control of all lights in the building which can control the power consumption of the lighting in the building.<br><br>This idea to use LEDs as an alternative to fluorescent based lamps has been developed before but still required an electrical infrastructure. Current systems require an continuous source of energy, but the system designed for this project uses solar energy as a primary source of energy which makes it capable of being installed without an electrical infrastructure. This makes it an ideal solution to the energy and pollution crisis that the world is facing today.

IMPROVEMENT OF MOTION SYSTEMS BY USING NICKEL-TITANIUM ALLOY
Erdem Basegmez, Murat Aslan, 
Istanbul High School, Istanbul, TURKEY

Nowadays, the movement in small scales is usually provided with electric motors. Nickel-Titanium, which was proven to be the most efficient activator under 100 grams, can be used in minor applications. Nickel-Titanium has two stable phases thanks to its crystal structure. This alloy, which gets smaller when it is heated, provides the movement by creating force. In this project, the movement of applications in different ways was maintained by using Nickel-Titanium.<br><br><br>At the end of the experiments done with Nickel-Titanium wire, the most stable mass and current (190 mA, 300 gr.) that Nickel-Titanium wires work, was determined. By using these values, different movement systems were set up and the applications were aimed to be moved only by using Nickel-Titanium wires. The designed applications are “Six Leg Spider”, “Wheeler” and “Two Leg Robot”. These model applications made with Nickel-Titanium wires are very slow compared to electric motor ones. But, as the dimension of applications done with Nickel-Titanium wire gets smaller, efficiency increases. Owing to these properties, Nickel-Titanium that is used in micro scaled applications is a good alternative as an activator. On the other hand, Nickel-Titanium becomes more preferable compared to the other alternatives thanks to its small volume and lightness.

ROBASPY - INSPECTION ROBOT FOR PAPER MACHINES

Hohere Technische Lehranstalt Neufelden, Neufelden, Upper Austria, AUSTRIA

Our project partner offers as a service the maintenance of paper machines, including the inspection of ceramic dewatering elements. Due to lack of space it is impossible for the service-team to inspect the dewatering elements in some sections of the paper machines. The following pages therefore present a novel way for inspecting ceramic dewatering elements, which has been developed for the application in a range of differently constructed paper machines.<br><br>In order to allow an inspection of these inaccessible sections, the task was to develop a robot which transmits high resolution pictures of the ceramic elements to the service engineer for the purpose of defect detection. It was required that this robot is controllable wirelessly and hence independent regarding its power supply. Additionally an on-board light source and protection against water damage was necessary. For usage on ceramic dewatering elements attached in sloping position the robot had to be constructed in a way to inhibit slipping. The height of the vehicle should not exceed 200 mm and the vehicle shouldn’t have to be positioned for every single inspection. Therefore an adjustment mechanism for the camera was required.<br><br>To meet these requirements, an inspection robot has been developed, which can be controlled either by Wi-Fi or manually. On keystroke the robot takes a picture of defective ceramic elements and transmits it to the notebook. Additionally the vehicle is equipped with two different guiding devices and can easily be adapted for the inspection of ceramic elements located above it.

LOW RESISTANCE MAGNETIC COILS FOR PLASMA CONFINEMENT
Oliver Chan, James Leung, Cheryl Wu
Stuyvesant High School, New York, NY

A spheromak is a well-known and innovative approach for generating plasma. In this project, our goal is to build on that approach by confining a spheromak formed plasma with a magnetic cusp. Spheromak confinement designs typically involve magnetic coils placed on the inside outside of the chamber while our design focuses on the use of magnetic coils placed on the inside of the chamber. Our design also aims at providing better plasma confinement with lower power consumption by using liquid nitrogen and a pair of low resistance magnetic coils. These coils were assembled after several rounds of design, construction, and testing in order to determine the optimal configuration. Design considerations such as cooling, power, uniformity and scale were all taken into account, and the final coil was built using a set of planned designs and tested in accordance with the desired conditions. The low resistance coils were designed to produce a uniform magnetic field in the form of a cusp for the purpose of trapping plasma particles and thereby confining plasma in a stable configuration. The development of the coils is an initial step towards the development of a larger more powerful confinement approach involving the use of a pair of tapered coaxial guns to inject high energy density plasma into the central region of a magnetic cusp to enable high energy particles to flow along unobstructed field lines. Confinement of plasma could lead to future development in the field of fusion energy and the study of plasma physics.

BUILDING A MODEL TO OPTIMIZE SOLAR WATER HEATING REQUIREMENTS GIVEN A SITE'S OBSERVED SOLAR FLUX
Matthew Peter Stanton, Matthew Heydeman, 
The York School, Monterey, CA

The goal of this project was to develop a computational model which would evaluate the effectiveness of a solar water heater in preheating water for hot tub or home hot water use, based on year of local solar irradiance and air temperature data. It was hypothesized that the model would identify an optimum number of solar water heating panels based on the power costs and panel costs. The MATLAB program first read the short wave, long wave, and air temperature values for each ten minute interval in the year. Next, the program looped through each interval, and, using the environmental data, the constants specific to the collector model, and the solar collector temperature calculated in the last interval, calculated the incoming solar energy, incoming black body radiation, the conductive loss of the collector, and the black body losses of the collector to determine the change in temperature of the collector and hot tub/water storage unit. The heat in the collector was mixed into the tub/hot water storage unit when the collector exceeded the storage temperature by two degrees. At the end of the solar day the amount of energy which would be necessary to bring the stored hot water to the desired temperature was calculated. This value was stored for each day and used in the economic analysis of the model. The program did predict an optimum number of solar panels, which turned out to be two, for both the hot tub and hot water models.

CORN METER MODIFICATION ON CORN SINGULATION
Kellin Carl Ferguson, John Marlett, 
Chillicothe Senior High School, Chillicothe, MO

In the Corn Belt, which includes the states of Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, and Missouri. In corn farming, a problem occurs when singulation accuracy is lower than acceptable levels. Corn singulation is the measure of how accurately a corn meter plants a seed, one at a time, in a predetermined length. The main problems that occur in singulation error are skips and multiples. Each of these problems causes a loss of the corn plant resulting in a loss of yield and capital. For each percentage error in corn singulation, six bushels are lost of crop. At today’s prices, this would result in a loss of a potential $24.00 dollar per acre. The average American corn farmer farms 1,000 acres, which totals his loss at $24,000 for that one percent error. In this project, a corn meter was modified by grinding an extra set of indents, or corn stops, imbedded in the meter plate to potentially increase singulation accuracy. The modified meter was tested against a regular corn meter with a Meter Max machine. The meters were tested with multiple types of seeds and the results proved to be statistically significant in most of the tests as skips and multiples were recorded. The data supports the theory that, the modified meter can help farmers increase both yield and profit, while decreasing corn singulation error.

THE POWER OF SPECTRAL EMISSIONS
Nicole Anela O' Kina Isoda, Keri Ann Yatogo, 
Kapaa High School, Kapaa, HI

The intention of this experiment was: find a relationship between voltages used powering a light bulb and its spectral emission(s). We also intended to find a relationship between voltages put into light bulb(s) and their temperature(s) after set times.<br><br> Using an isolation transformer we set the input voltages to 120volts. We took the temperature of the bulb before turning it on, 5, 10, and 15 minutes afterwards. We repeated this for the remaining 7 bulbs and again with voltages set to 90 and 60volts. To take the spectral emissions, we used a fiber optic assembly stabilized using a 2-dimensional translation stage and aimed the sensor at our light source. Three measures were taken of the emission spectra while the bulb was lit using 120, 90, and 60volts each. These steps were repeated for the remaining bulbs.<br><br> After tests, we found temperatures of bulbs significantly higher when input voltage was higher. Red incandescent light was coolest, and agro-lite was the hottest overall, after 15 minutes. When observing spectral emissions, only vertical shifts in the intensity of wavelengths were observed. Peaks did not shift wavelengths with altered voltage. When voltage was reduced from 120 to 90 and 60 volts, intensity of the light got lower.<br><br> We concluded that there's a direct relationship between input voltage to a light bulb and it's temperature or emission spectra. As the voltage went up, so did the temperature or intensity of the emission spectra.

Traffic accidents at intersections are one of today's frequent problems. In many countries, worldwide, traffic accidents are one of the highest causes of death and severe injuries, especially in the Middle East. Some social, economical, ecological, and of course health related problems are some of the many effects that have to be dealt with as an aftermath of these accidents<br><br>Smart Intersection System (SIS) project aims to develop a smart system to manage and coordinate traffic lights at intersections to reduce the likelihood of fatal car accidents. This would additionally result in, reducing drivers’ frustrations and tension at intersections.<br><br>SIS addresses common problems at roads intersections. These problems were identified as, having traffic jams at one traffic light while other traffic lights are relatively not busy, having long cars pile up between two intersections resulting in intersection blockage and failure of timed traffic light systems or to be properly read by elders or individuals who cannot read English numbers.<br><br>The system was developed to use graded traffic lights of 12 rows (6 green and 6 red) to alert drivers of status of stop/go as suppose to timers. In addition set of 3 IR sensors were used to read the number of cars in a road while an Electronic Microcontroller (PARALLAX) is used to distribute time between traffic lights based on information collected from different sensors. The IR sensors are placed so that the last one detects cars that are at end of queue and at risk of blocking other traffic lights. The Microcontroller controls the switching of traffic lights from red to green and vice versa depending on the info received from the IR sensors. PBasic programming language was used to program the microcontroller. <br><br>In future development of the project, screening sensors that can be used to distinguish between separate bodies, and can efficiently read the number of cars in each intersection.

THE MOTION OF THE OCEAN: ENGINEERING AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO SIMULATE OCEANIC TIDES
Diana Yuri Cabral, Aloha Yoza, Noelle Owen
Saint Andrew's Priory School, Honolulu, HI

The constructed tidal apparatus is an innovative engineering approach to simulate tidal changes in a specialized in-class multi-tank complete marine ecosystem. This project focuses on the tide simulating apparatus of the system Currently, there are few apparatuses that simulate tidal changes. Many of which use expensive pump systems that displace water, thus creating disturbances for both the organisms in the tank and the experiments done. To address the need for a tidal simulator overcoming issues with already existing apparatuses, a design using water conveyance tubes was implemented. A wooden infrastructure was built using the concept of a double fulcrum to ensure the two tanks would rise and fall perpendicular to the ground. One tank would show a high tide, the other would show the opposite low tide. A water conveyance tube then connected the two tanks, creating hydrostatic pressure which allowed for the tanks’ heights to be adjusted to produce identical water heights in both tanks. A motor and a control relay system produced the mechanism needed for the functions of up and down and start and stop. These functions then were implemented to produce an array of tidal situations. <br><br> This apparatus provides a model of gentle real tidal motion, without creating large water disturbances, while also being cost efficient, with total costs being around $400.00. Currently, this tidal-tank system is implemented to observe organisms in any desired tidal situation and ultimately will be a key component in engineering a complete marine ecosystem.

HOW SALINITY EFFECTS MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC PROPULSION
Kohlton Thomas Bendowski
Crystal River High School, Crystal River, FL

If you’ve ever seen the movie The Hunt for Red October then you’ll know what I mean when I say Magnetohydrodynamic Propulsion. In the movie The Hunt for Red October the submarine, Red October, is powered by an engine that runs completely off of magnet power. The purpose for this is that someday in the future some boats might be powered by magnets and we need to know how the salinity of the water will affect the boat. The boat will most likely speed up in waters with higher salinity. At the beginning of the experiment I placed the boat into the fresh water; then I timed it to see how fast it would travel. I repeated this 5 times. After I had done the experiment 5 times I replaced the fresh water with Gulf water and repeated the same steps. After I tested the Gulf water I repeated the same steps with the salt solution that I made. The boat did not travel at all in the fresh water; it traveled at an average speed of 66.3cm/min in the Gulf water, the boat traveled at an average speed of 132.6cm/min in the salt solution. Since the boat did not move in the fresh water it means that the boat needs some kind of salinity in the water in order for it to move. In the real world, if an actual sized boat were made using the same design then you would never have to pay for gas again.

CREATION OF A 3D ENVIRONMENT WITH BINOCULAR VISION
Dylan Cooper Dalrymple
Pensacola High School, Pensacola, FL

Many solutions arise to provide an efficient method for recognizing the environment around an object 3-dimensionally, but one problem persists, cost. The purpose of my project was to create the same result as leading products in 3D vision, but more cost-effective, in a biologically-influenced binocular camera sensor that would provide its results similarly to the process of interpreting 3D movies.<br><br> I approached this problem by using an Arduino Duemilanove with the ATmega328 microcontroller (for recording and transmitting images), a computer (for interpreting images), two M64282FP camera modules (found in the Game Boy Camera), and two ADC0820 analog-to-digital converters (for converting image output). I also programmed each of these devices to work synchronically and the algorithms used to convert these 2-dimensional images into one 3D image, the Maximally Stable Extremal Regions Algorithm and the Binocular Distance Algorithm, which was developed later in my experimentation.<br><br> My hypothesis stated that if the electrical components and the Binocular Distance Algorithm are achieved, the final 3D image will output as planned. I did achieve fairly accurate output that returned its distance similar the actual distance. Though my product was not suitable enough to be used as a reliable sensor, it accurately presented the concept. Therefore, my results have proven that all of the electrical components and algorithms have performed as planned. Yet, it is evident that improvements need to be made to achieve a true sensor utilizing binocular vision that could be efficient enough to compete against the leading products in 3D vision.

AN EFFICIENCY STUDY OF A HEAD CONTROLLED COMPUTER INTERFACE USING EMBEDDED CIRCUITRY
Gavin Grant Ovsak
Eden Prairie High School, Eden Prairie, MN

Few devices currently exist to help individuals with limited muscle control in their arms to access computers. I designed a circuit board that is embedded on a baseball cap for the purpose of replacing the functions of a typical handheld computer mouse. The Circuit Head Accessibility Device (CHAD) that I invented restores access to the practical usage of computers and all related uses of it for these individuals who otherwise are unable to use a conventional handheld computer mouse. This device, is less expensive, more efficient, and uses less complex software interfaces than what is currently available in the market. My device directs a computer cursor with the use of head movements and a bite sensor that allows users to click on an item or icon. I analyzed the navigational rate quotient between a handheld computer mouse versus this new head-mounted device. My original hypothesis stated that ten-percent of the navigational rate of a handheld computer mouse device would be achieved with the head-mounted device. The 28 adult test subjects who used the device during the initial testing phase showed, on average, a 22.92% navigational rate at the completion of their testing. Possible sources of error in the data collected from the test subjects using the device include: differing mindsets, differing levels of experience with peripheral computer technology, and differing strategies. Further efficiency testing is planned to compare data between non-disabled test subjects with those who are unable to use a traditional mouse, such as amputees and quadriplegic individuals.

• My project is generally based on trying to save as much fuel and preserving the mechanical system of the vehicle as much as possible by removing the major place where it is wasted and where the system is subjected to a shock; speed bumps.<br><br>• I have conducted a study on speed bumps and the following points are the results:<br><br>1. The sole purpose for putting speed bumps is forcing the driver to reduce the speed in which he is driving the vehicle.<br><br>2. One of the main negativities of speed bumps is increasing the factor of damages to the car as the whole mechanic system is subjected to a shock every time the car ascends a speed bump which leads to decreasing the hypothetical age of the car.<br><br>3. The other negativity is that the car crosses a larger distance when it goes up and down the speed bump and that leads to burning more fuel than originally intended.<br><br>• The purpose of the energy generator speed bump is getting rid of the cons of normal speed bumps while keeping their pros.<br><br>• The energy generator speed bump also uses the movements of cars and their weights to create dynamic energy and turning it to electric energy.<br><br>• The energy which is generated is used to light the streets up through installing LED lamps which can last for a long time.

LOW COST AND EFFICIENT HIGH-PRESSURE ELECTROLYZER
Kenneth Charles McGill
Baldwin High School, Milledgeville, GA

An Electrolyzer is a device that separates water (H2O) into Hydrogen (H2) and Oxygen (O2) by electrolysis. Electrolysis is the process whereby electric current flows through liquid containing ions, and the liquid is broken down as a result[i]. Current electrolyzers capable of producing 3.0 kg of Hydrogen per day cost approximately $300,000, and are approximately 70% efficient. Hydrogen produced from the electrolyzer has to be stored at high pressure but the pumps required for storing hydrogen at high pressure are very expensive. I will attempt to design a more affordable high-pressure electrolyzer comparable to current electrolyzers in both efficiency and hydrogen production. Creating a more affordable high-pressure electrolyzer will make hydrogen fuel cells a more viable source of fuel that could replace fossil fuels. The source of inspiration for this project comes from an article I read in Popular Mechanics[ii] magazine. In this article, they discussed the pros and cons of several replacements for fossil fuels of which hydrogen fuel cells was one of, the main problem with hydrogen fuel cells is that the electrolyzers that produce the hydrogen are too expensive. During last year’s experiments, I worked with the efficiency and hydrogen production, so this year I will focus on the pressure aspect of the design. I hope to work around the expensive pumps used in current electrolyzers. <br><br>

VIAS: CREATING A VISUALLY IMPAIRED ASSISTANCE SYSTEM PROTOTYPE
Shravan Shaastri
Jasper High School, Plano, TX

The goal of this engineering project is to develop a cane fitted with RFID receiver combined with RFID transponders embedded in buildings, sidewalks, etc. as a navigational aid for visually impaired people (VIP). The Braille Institute says there are millions of Americans, including children, who are legally blind due to various causes. Furthermore, around the world is a large percentage of human population that cannot see and enjoy simple things in life like taking a walk or going shopping. Currently, guide-dogs, canes, and canes with expensive, unreliable GPS attachment are the only choices. Therefore, the goal of my VIAS product is to ENHANCE the QUALITY of LIFE of several VIP by providing accurate, safer, timely, and economical way to navigate. This experiment will design a prototype for a VIAS using RFID to inform the VIP of stores, buildings, as well as impending hazards (construction, crosswalk, etc.) indoors and outdoors. It will provide broader location information (anywhere) than currently available GPS systems and will be affordable.<br><br>Because the complete procedure is too long, an abridged version of the procedure is given below:<br><br>1) Prepare the RFID reader and tags.<br><br>2) Build the different versions of the VIAS cane.<br><br>Since the technical goal was to read as many Tags as possible, the iterations were modified either in the VIAS design or the placement of the tags to accomplish that goal. The data shows that each iteration was able to pick up more TAG signals - iteration 1: 7 times, iterations 2 & 3: 10 times each, iteration 4: 17 times, & the 5th and final iteration best fulfilled the need and engineering goal by reading 25 out of 25 times. The design of the VIAS cane and the arrangement of the tags allowed the tester to receive the location information success.

THE POTENTIAL FOR ELECTROACTIVE POLYMERS (EAPS) AS ACTUATORS IN A REFLECTED LIGHT DISPLAY BASED ON CUTTLEFISH SKIN BEHAVIOR
Jeremy Jackson Blalock
York School, Monterey, CA

This project investigated the feasibility of using Electroactive Polymers (EAPs) as actuators and to induce perceivable changes in area, in a reflective light display design inspired by the behavior of cuttlefish skin cells. The skin-coloration system of a cuttlefish works by expanding and contracting small pigment sacs, which are in contracted state, spheres, and in expanded state are disk-shaped. This experiment was designed as the first part of an engineering loop, where the end result is to design and build a digital display that uses these same behaviors to expand and contract pigmented pixels. Investigated in this experiment were two types of EAP materials, dielectric and ionic. Dielectric EAPs work as compliant capacitors, and produce a force in the X & Y directions when a force is applied in the Z direction. The resulting displacement changes the surface area, and was shown in the experiment to increase the surface area by ~30% when a 2N force was applied. To produce such a force through coulomb forces, however, the required voltage is fairly high. At a smaller scale, however, a much smaller voltage would be required to produce the same percentage displacement change. The second type of EAP material investigated was the family of ionic EAPs, which instead produce a longitudinal bending force, and so would be implemented differently. These materials utilize special carbon nanotube qualities to produce a similar behavior to that of the dielectric EAPs, but on a molecular level. The ionic EAPs would be implemented in the same manner as the contractive muscle tissue in cuttlefish skin, to open and close an actual pigment sac, as opposed to changing its own surface area, as do the dielectric EAPs.

PIEZO-POWER
Adam Brian Schuster
F.W. Springstead High School, Spring Hill, FL

This experiment is about how piezoelectric transducers produce energy when it is physically stressed. The question proposed in this experiment is, “Which daily activity would produce the most energy output when using a piezoelectric shoe insole?”. The hypothesis proposed in this experiment is “If piezoelectric shoe insoles are used during different daily activities and tested for highest energy output, then I believe that running will produce the most output because that activity will press and deform the piezoelectric disks at the highest rate and force.” The independent variable is the different everyday activities and the control is how much energy will the transducers produce if the shoe insole is in the shoe with a person wearing them.<br><br> In order to successfully complete the project, a series of procedures were executed. A thin and bendable plastic sheet was used to be be the insole of the shoe, cut out from a tracing of the wearers foot. The piezoelectric disks were then soldered together with a copper wire connecting all of the crystals of the disks together and a wire connecting all of the metal parts together and going to the voltage meter. The wiring of the piezoelectric disks were soldered in a parallel fasion. Electrical tape is used to make sure that the wires did not touch. The wearer put on the athletic shoe with insole and ran and walked on the treadmill, and stood while recording the results.<br><br> After the completion of the procedures, the data was recorded. Standing, or the control, produced the least amount of energy output. Walking produced the second most in my experiment, being less steady with moderate spikes. Running produced the highest amount of output, with high and very frequent energy readings.<br><br> This experiment is important because it is a way to produce energy doing an every day activity that would otherwise be wasted. The term to describe this is energy harvesting. Every person in the world walks, stands, and runs, and if there is a way that energy could be produced from those daily activities then it would benefit humankind greatly. Energy is being generated that can power personal technological advances, like cell phones, small computers, and other technology that will evolve in the future.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF RECYCLABLE GLIDING SONDE
Yuqing Huang
Beijing 101 Middle School, Beijing, Beijing, CHINA

Aerological sounding can provide important data for weather and climate forecasts, and hence is of great assistance to disaster alarming, especially when “Global warming” results in worldwide climatic anomalies and disasters in recent years. The tools used in aerological sounding are mainly balloon sondes. However, the sondes can only be used once, the function and accuracy of the sondes are limited. In this report, a gliding sonde is shown to solve these issues. The sonde can measure temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction with temperature and humidity sensor as well as GPS. the collected data is then sent via radio in real-time. The controller in the glider can constantly adjust the flight posture with the attitude measured by on-board accelerometer and GPS device, and therefore flies the glider to the appointed landing location. The experiments shown in this report can demonstrate the validity of my deisgn and its superiority over the usual balloon sondes. The recyclable gliding sonde not only reduces the cost and therefore protects our environment by recycling the sonde, but also increases detection range and time in air. The sonde flies back from 40km high altitude for the first time worldwide. The measurement and studies of high-altitude microorganism and magnetic field endow the gliding sonde with practical value.<br><br>Key words:recyclable,gliding,sonde,Aerological sounding,weather forecasts

PROTOTYPE SOLAR-POWERED LIQUID PISTON ENGINE, PHASE II
Kelly Maria Kleier
Notre Dame Academy, Park Hills, KY

The purpose of this research was to construct a liquid piston engine fueled by a heat source such as the sun. Air in the hot side was heated to create a temperature difference between the heating and cooling lines, generating pressure differences and creating oscillations that would enable pumping of water. It was expected that such an engine would be useful for water pumping or as an irrigation system in a developing country. In past experimentation, four model engines were designed and their operation improved on a trial-and-error basis. A pumping line with two one-way valves was added in the current research. After pumping was achieved, a new prototype (Model 5) was constructed that facilitated study of other variables. Amplitudes and frequencies of oscillation were measured for liquid volumes ranging from 125 mL to 250 mL and horizontal tuning line lengths from 26 cm to 63 cm. Frequencies were fairly constant at 1.1 to 1.2 Hz, and maximum amplitude was achieved at 150 mL and 63 cm. To facilitate observation of oscillations, Model 6 was made to test the optimum oscillation conditions with a system having a pumping line parallel to the vertical part of the tuning line.

NANOPARTICLE OPTIMIZATION OF SPECIFIC IMPULSE OF A NOVEL IONIC ENGINE: A LINK TO NANOFET NEMS/MEMS THRUSTERS
Alexis Emily Block
Nicolet High School, Glendale, WI

Conventional chemical fuel powered rockets are required to carry and use large amount of fuel, and therefore have a restricted time limit in space. Ionic propulsion is an alternative that allows for the use of less chemical fuel and a near unlimited time in space. The purpose of this experiment is to determine if nanoparticle enhanced corona wires, because of their microscopic increased surface area will have increased electrical fields, thereby producing more thrust. To test this, nanoparticle enhanced corona wires will be substituted for the corona wires used in a previous experiment, and a small wind tunnel will be constructed to more accurately measure particle velocity both with and without the nanoparticle enhanced corona wires. To power the rocket, it will be hooked up to a counter current voltage multiplier and up to 30kV will be delivered. The results of both tests will then be compared to see if a notable difference is apparent. In the hopes of maximizing thrust and minimizing power consumption, 2nd and 3rd anodes will be added to the novel ionic engine and the tests will be run again.

"COMPRESS ME LIGHT": HARNESSING THE MECHANICAL POWER OF SPRINGS
Emely Louise Morales
James Pace High School, Brownsville, TX

The purpose behind this experiment is to produce a clean, chemical free energy source. Only depending on mechanical energy, that can be transfer to electrical energy. By producing this energy and harnessing it you can project this energy and apply it to the world. Using this recoil movement to power buildings, or any type of object that, has a heavy pedestrian area near it. To harness the vertical recoil of springs by compressing then releasing it, then having that recoil act on a dynamo type generator. Where the vertical movement moves magnets around a series of coils of wire, creating an electrical charge. Then finally connecting that electrical charge into an output wire and harnessing that energy, in turn producing energy. When this energy was harnessed and acted on LED’s they were fully lit for up to three hours. Although after six minutes, of compression and recoil, the light remained lit for the same amount of time. Concluding that if this energy was harnessed and saved on a batter it can not only power led’s but can charge a battery.

STAIR CLIMBING STABILITY, YEAR THREE
Zachary Harrison Melnik
Viera High School, Viera, FL

The Purpose of this project was to construct a robot that could traverse stairs while carrying a ball on a flat plate. The engineering goals required that the robot carry a steel ball on a flat plate, that the ball must stay within ±25mm of the center of the plate, and required the robot to climb a flight of stairs. <br><br> The final robot design was the result of 7 design iterations and 14 software revisions. The robot used a resistive touch screen measuring 190mm by 145mm mounted in the center of a two-axis gimbal to sense the location of the ball. Using the X and Y positional data that was taken from the touch screen, corrections were made using a PID controller augmented by velocity to adjust the angle of the plate. The gimbal assembly was placed on a compact 4-wheeled robot that climbed a ramp built on top of a standard set of stairs. To adjust for the incline a tilt sensor was used to level the gimbal.<br><br> To judge the success of the robot the ball position, servo position, acceleration, and tilt were collected using set recording points within the software. <br><br> As a result of the engineering done during this project, it was found that the robot could keep the steel ball within ±25mm from the center of the plate roughly 85% of the time. Although not all of the engineering goals were met, the robot that resulted is a large step towards the goal of climbing stairs.

LIGHT BEAM COMMUNICATION: THE EFFECT OF RECEIVED SIGNAL POWER AND AMBIENT BACKGROUND LIGHT ON THE SIGNAL TO NOISE RATIO AND OPTIMAL THRESHOLD OF FREE SPACE OPTICAL COMMUNICATION
Bradley Joseph Natarian
Old Mill Senior High School, Millersville, MD

Free space optics (FSO) has a number of important applications, including temporary network installation for special events, disaster recovery, intersatellite communication, high speed backplane interconnections in high performance computers and enterprise networks, and to establish communications in areas where fiber installation is not practical either because of cost or risk. In the wake of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, FSO links were deployed to augment the surviving ground network to allow businesses to maintain critical operations. These applications prompted me to create a research project in an effort to engineer more cost effective FSO equipment. The research performed this year proves the hypothesis that the performance of the FSO system depends on the signal to noise ratio, in this case the difference between the signal levels, rather than the absolute levels themselves. To investigate this subject, FSO communication equipment was designed and built to transmit a 63-bit maximal length pseudorandom bit sequence. The links were basically error free, so the received power levels for the transmission of a 1 and a 0 from the phototransistor were compared. It was found that the data supports the hypothesis because there is a larger distinction between a received 1 and 0 when there is a high received signal power and low ambient background light. In conclusion, a high received signal power and low ambient light will facilitate the lowest error rate FSO communication equipment with an on-off keying format.

LEARNING FROM THE PAST: HEAT TRANSFER IN ANCIENT NATIVE AMERICAN BUILDINGS
Nicholas C Rajen
Eldorado High School, Albuqerque, NM

The purpose of this experiment is to understand how heat goes in and out of ancient Native American buildings (e.g. Bandelier National Monument, Los Alamos,, and at the Coronado State Park, Bernalillo). I also measured the temperatures on materials of known thickness and thermal conductivity (Fiberglass) kept in sunlight near the ancient structures – this allowed me to estimate the solar radiation. Then, knowing this radiation and measuring temperatures on the ancient walls, I was able to estimate their thermal conductivity. I also did some computer modeling of this heat transfer in walls. This is a first step in understanding how heat flows in the buildings, and how warm they must have been with fires inside and cold air outside. This experiment has application for affecting the design of modern buildings, perhaps making them more efficient – a key part of controlling climate change and reducing energy use and greenhouse gases. It appears that adobe bricks used at Bandelier National Monument may have had inclusions that burned away when fired leaving voids and air gaps that improved their insulating effectiveness.

SOLAR STIRLING CAPABILITY & COMPARISON
Cory Nicholson Owan
Home School, Tucson, AZ

A solar driven Stirling engine is tested and compared to the performance of a commercial Photovoltaic panel. The Stirling system consists of a solar concentrator and a Beta type Stirling engine. The efficiency of both systems’ ability to generate useable power in the form of electricity is examined under identical conditions. The Photovoltaic panel was found to have efficiency within published ranges, while the Stirling engine overall efficiency for the unit tested was half of the efficiency of the Photovoltaic panel. The Stirling system is examined and sources of loss are identified. A design that potentially improves the major areas of loss is proposed and described. The improved design consists of an Alpha type Stirling engine using a standard type regenerator and a Ross yoke power transfer system. A projection of commercial product cost and payback period for the proposed design is presented. Results indicate that a solar driven Stirling engine used to drive an efficient generator is economically feasible and should be developed.

THE STUDY OF THE SOCKET THAT SUITS FOR THE USE OF SPECIAL OR ORDINARY PEOPLE AND UNDER SOME SPECIAL ENVIRONMENTS
Yinkui Wang

As we know,the socket now is single function.The main problem of the existing sockets is unsafe for people,especially for disabilities.If a user is blind or the hole of the socket is hard to see, or touching the conducting medium directly or indirectly it is easy to electric shock,so we can’t use plug easily,safely and conveniently.Recalling my painful experience, I decided to change.After an investigation,clearing objectives,design,production,testing,data collection, analysis,it came to the conclusion finalized and produced a final model. 1.Safety: Automatically power off when pull plug.First part is the mechanism of controlling automatically power on or off.When putted or pulled plug,the double layer structure control automatically the circuit closing or opening by rotation.Even if we touch the conducting medium directly or indirectly,we don’t have the danger of electric shock.2.Simple:Whoever use socket safely simply and conveniently.Especially blind people or ordinary people without looking the hole of socket (such as dark environment, the socket under the desk, etc.).Second part is double height 1 mm orbits outside surface.Let the plug go along the orbit.We can use plug without looking.Thanks to spring in the double layer structure,pulling plug is easy.3.Special: preventing the light electrical appliances from falling on ground.Third part is a magnet and a lever,which plays a role of fixing and ejecting plug.When the powerline of light electrical appliances (such as notebooks) stumble, the plug is pulled quickly. Experiment results show that it can increase the using success rate from 12% to 96% in 10 seconds without looking.The laptop over 0.5 kg,it can be prevented from falling.Disabled and senior citizen feedback great.I think the structure can integrate higher.

CLOSER TO WHERE IT WASN'T: ESTIMATION AND TRACKING USING ADAPTIVE FILTERING
John Tilla Parish IV
HomeSchool, Colorado Springs, CO

I used a computer modeling and simulation approach to build and test two adaptive filters (a Recursive Least-Squares (RLS) Filter, and a Kalman Filter) as well as a non-adaptive Three-dimensional g-h Filter. My computer model produced a target for the filters to track. The target had either constant acceleration or varying acceleration trajectories. My filters applied position measurements to estimate the target motion. Using the current target motion estimate, the filters created a prediction for the next target position. Then, I took a position measurement (with measurement error). The filters used only position measurements to update estimates in the target position, velocity and acceleration. The cycle repeated, using incrementally less of the measurement in each update (adaptive), leading to an accurate representation for the target path. Both of my adaptive filters improved upon my non-adaptive design by including acceleration in the target model. At a set time, I calculated an extended batch prediction of the target future position. I tuned my batch predictor by experimenting with the number of measurements I used. I completed the testing process for my RLS Filter with different amounts of error, and different trajectories. I tested my Kalman Filter by experimenting with different process noise levels. My Kalman Filter performed best because it could keep up with acceleration changes. Simulations experimentally determinded the best performing filter.

LOW-ABERRATION VARIABLE-FOCUS LIQUID LENS
Eric Chiwei Shiao
Taipei Municipal Chien-Kuo Senior High School, Taipei, Taiwan (R.O.C), CHINESE TAIPEI

Liquid lens has been studied since 1940; in basic, the body of the liquid lens is a transparent liquid instead of solid glass or plastics as used in conventional optical lenses. One of the important features of liquid lens is that its focal length could be varied through the change of curvatures of both surfaces of the lens. However, the aberration is an important issue for the image quality of such a liquid lens. In this research, the theoretical focal length and the relationship between the focal length and the volume of the liquid were first derived. And then a solution was proposed for reducing the aberration of the liquid lens. With a careful design of the thicknesses of the two membranes through computer simulation and data analysis, the curvatures of the two surfaces of the liquid lens can be controlled so that the aberration of the liquid lens can be reduced significantly. In experiment, several elastic membranes and high refractive index liquids were used to develop variable-focus liquid lenses. Besides, several improvements were made to reduce the weight, size and cost of the liquid lens. For low-aberration liquid lens design, the experimental results also agreed with the theoretical results very well. At last, several applications of variable-focus liquid lens were developed. These applications, including teaching aids, creature observer, non-contact range-finder, endoscope and adjustable dual-focus eyeglasses are very helpful in teaching, daily use and health care.

UNDERGROUND IMAGING
Alexander Kent Kendrick
Los Alamos High School, Los Alamos, NM

Underground imaging can be used to locate underground aquifers in dry regions of the world as well as detect oil, gas, ore deposits, water filled cave passages, or buried bunkers. In this project, I designed, built and field tested an underground imaging system that can induce currents in aquifers and detect the corresponding secondary field. The system was optimized to detect Snowy River in Fort Stanton Cave, New Mexico. After extensive field testing, Snowy River was successfully detected over four survey lines at a depth of 5-14m. The detection of Snowy River will provide the Bureau of Land Management with an accurate non intrusive method for detecting water flow in Snowy River without human impact to the delicate cave environment. The Snowy River test was verified with the detection of a stream 10m underground in Falling Rock cave. To test and calibrate this system on the surface, a water filled hose containing a conductive salt solution was detected. An extension cord placed 15m underground in Black Cave, New Mexico was also successfully detected. By using an optimal frequency of 38.4 kHz and a phase detector, the phase shift over underground conductors were measured. A Class-E amplifier at 38.4 kHz powered a large loop antenna on the surface to generate an electromagnetic field. A gradiometer was built to isolate the induced secondary field and detect shifts in magnitude and phase created by the conductor. Based on my system’s capability, the imaging system can successfully detect an underground conductor located 5-14m underground.

THE POWER OF THE SUN: COMPARISON BETWEEN PHOTOVOLTAIC SOLAR CELLS AMD STIRLING-CYCLE ENGINES
David Allyn Litherland
Mid-Buchanan High School, Faucett, MO

A Stirling cycle engine runs on temperature differentials. It is often used for electrical generation, but has been used to operate machinery and vehicles, heat homes, and power radios. <br><br>The purpose of this project was to develop an original Stirling engine design and test it for electricity generation capability. This new engine design does not use a mechanical link between the piston and the displacer. Rather, it uses solenoids to move the displacer, negating friction. This design removes any superfluous parts from the design and could theoretically move faster than other Stirling Engine designs. Therefore, the alternate hypothesis was that the Stirling engine would be able to generate more electricity than the photovoltaic cells<br><br>To experiment with this design, a solar panel was allowed to gather electricity during the afternoon on a clear summer day. The engine was originally to be tested alongside the photovoltaic cells in the focal point of a parabolic dish, but the engine failed. The engine was then moved inside and a bench test was created to simulate light and heat generated by the sun. The importance of this project is to attempt to create a more efficient alternate energy source, or, in case of failure of design, develop and improve the engine design to achieve this goal.<br><br>The results are as follows: the Stirling engine generated an average of 4.754 milliwatts, and the solar panel generated an average of 25.04 milliwatts. These results do not conclusively support the alternate hypothesis.

SQUEEZE OF A SCREW
Mark Philippe Schoeni
Celebration High School, Celebration, FL

Squeeze of a Screw was created in order to discover whether an axial turbine or an Archimedes Screw will create more pressure at the exit (narrower end) of a cone cowling. For the experiment a test-bed built out of K’NEX was created for both turbines to be tested on. Each turbine was inserted into the test-bed and tested at one-third power, two-thirds power, and full power. A microcontroller controlled the speed of the turbines and recorded the pressure the turbines produced for ten seconds. A piezo pressure sensor is used to find the pressure at the exit of the chamber. The chamber which is used is a cone with two circular holes cut into it. The entrance is the large opening which is generally the base. The exit point for the air entering the cone is a smaller circle cut into the top of the cone.<br><br> The hypothesis for the experiment is that at the one-third and two-thirds power settings the Archimedes Screw would generate more pressure than the axial turbine. However, at the full power setting the axial turbine design would generate more pressure.<br><br> The results of my experiment showed that at the lowest power setting the Archimedes turbine did have a slight advantage over the axial design. However at the two-thirds and full power settings the axial design had the advantage. The axial turbine was able to create more pressure at higher revolutions because air is allowed to slip past the blades, unlike in the screw design where air is not permitted to travel faster than the blade. The drag created by the screw’s design slows it down, not allowing it to create enough thrust to keep up with the axial turbine.

NOVEL HEATING APPROACH IN DYNAMIC SPRAYING OF NANO PARTICLES
Alice Wei Zhao

Gas dynamic spraying of nano particles (with diameters between 1 and 100 nm) is a direct fabrication technique for nanostructured coatings and bulk materials involving the deposition or the compaction of nanoparticles to form coatings or bulk parts without coarsening the nanoscale structure. Providing high pressure (250 psi or 17 atm) and high temperature (1300 oF or 704 oC) carrying gas for the nano particles is a key part during that process. <br><br> In this research, a novel approach to heat the carrying gas by electromagnetic induction was studied, heating coil and induction coil were designed and manufactured, and the portable heating assembly was built to provide stable supply of carrying gas at required temperature and pressure for successful nanoparticles dynamic spraying test. The novel heating approach in this research has met the requirement in dynamic spraying of nano particles. This technology can be used in various industries.

THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF AN EXPERIMENTAL PISTON-LESS ROTARY ENGINE FOR IMPROVED THERMAL EFFICIENCY: SUSTAINABLE ENGINEERING FOR THE TRANSITION TO ALTERNATIVE FUELS
Eric Lau
Savannah Arts Academy, Savannah, GA

Conventional rotary engines like the Wankel have thermodynamic characteristics during combustion in which rotor-induced turbulence reduces the number of hot spots in the rotor housing, thereby reducing the chance of pre-ignition. This makes rotary engines inherently suited for use with low-octane fuels such as hydrogen; however, the Wankel is less efficient than its piston counterparts, severely limiting its viability as a “transition technology” to clean alternative energy. My research focused on the design of an experimental rotary engine for improved thermal efficiency relative to the Wankel that retained its multi-fuel capabilities. The experimental engine was designed for a higher compression ratio and a lower surface area-to-volume ratio than the Wankel in order to maximize combustion efficiency and minimize heat loss. It featured the first-ever use of an elliptical housing and rotor and an offset hexagonal rotor eccentricity. An experimental model and a benchmark Wankel engine model were created in Solidworks CAD software. They provided volumetric data used to perform calculation sets modeling the air-standard Otto Cycle using air, octane, and hydrogen as the working fluids. The thermal efficiencies of each engine were calculated. On air, the benchmark engine had an efficiency of 35.5%, while the experimental engine had a significantly higher efficiency of 41.7%. The results of these calculations validated my hypothesis in showing that the experimental engine is more efficient and demonstrated that the experimental rotary engine maintains its efficiency level when used with hydrogen. There are automotive and aerospace applications for this efficient, multi-fuel experimental rotary engine.

LIGHTING THE FUTURE: THE POWER OUTPUT OF TITANIUM DIOXIDE SOLAR CELLS USING VARIOUS DYES
Chaimaa Makoudi
General Douglas MacArthur High School, Levittown, NY

In order to solve our national energy problem, and maintain a clean and healthy environment, the development of renewable energy sources is necessary. The recent application of nanotechnology in the field of photovoltaics promises excellent potential because it is relatively efficient and inexpensive. Nanotechnology is directed towards the use of quantum dots (QDs) to improve solar cell efficiency. The main physical concept is that one photon can excite one electron in bulk semiconductor materials while it can excite multiple electrons in a QD. <br><br>The objective of this research is to enhance solar cell efficiency by replacing the chemical dye with QDs and other organic dyes, such as blackberry and raspberry juices, as well as to explore the effect of QD on the overall performance of the solar cell. Therefore, an assembly of cadmium selenide and indium phosphide zinc sulfide QDs were deposited onto titanium dioxide (TiO2) layered on Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) glass. Iodide was used as the electrolyte in this project. Performance tests were conducted under regular light using a 600W lamp. The maximum open circuit voltages and short circuit currents of the QDSSC(s) were measured and compared. The QD with smaller particle sizes exhibited better overall cell performance.

A NEW SOLAR ENERGY MATERIAL SEARCH STRATEGY
Megan Katherine Mercer
Ballard High School, Louisville, KY

At present there are no perfectly suitable materials for solar energy production. There are also no suitable search methods that can screen a number of materials for their performance. Here, it is shown that one can illuminate the entire electrode with one lamp and scan the counter electrode to resolve the photoelectrochemical performance spatially. The goal of this experiment was to determine whether one can use a small electrode tip as a counter electrode to determine spatially resolved performance. The hypothesis was that the current distribution between a large electrode and a small electrode will primarily be localized. The ultimate purpose is to improve the photochemical electrolysis and photocatalysis processes. The experiment was conducted by constructing titanium dioxide, tin (IV) oxide, and iron (III) oxide squares on slides separated by fluorine-doped tin oxide, positioning the slides in one molar potassium hydroxide solution, and then testing current produced at dissimilar points on the slides. Then, constructing dye sensitized solar cell substrates with titanium oxide, dying them, and placing them in an iodide electrolyte solution. The results were that the current of titanium dioxide could be differed from that of FTO and the other materials. The dyed titania’s current within the electrolyte solution was also significantly different from the FTO substrate. It is concluded that a specific semiconductor can be differentiated due to its current, and that the counter electrode proximity can indeed have an impact on the photcatalytic functions of solar cells. This all resulted in a successful material characterization technique.

A NEW APPROACH TO ENCRYPTION: MODIFICATION OF ROSSLER’S CHAOTIC EQUATIONS TO CREATE A ENCRYPTED COMMUNICATION SYSTEM WITH SIGNAL MASKING AND AUTOMATIC SELF SYNCHRONIZING DECRYPTION
Curtis Adrian Khol
James Madison High School, Vienna, VA

In 1960, meteorologist Edward Lorenz identified that very small variations to the input to nonlinear systems can produce unforeseen results. He called this behavior “chaotic” and his findings started the field known as “Chaos Theory”. In 1976, Otto Rossler advanced Chaos Theory by developing a set of equations which exhibited not only chaotic behavior but also the ability for two sets of the equations to self-synchronize. The experimenter created a computer model of a communication system based on Rossler’s equations then developed a modified set of Rossler’s equations (Khol’s equations) to produce a more effective decryption scheme. The computer model demonstrated that a system built using Rossler encryption and Khol decryption equations had the ability to encrypt and automatically decode a message as well as hide the true message in noise better than one using a Rossler decryption scheme. The computer simulation was confirmed through construction of the Rossler encryption, Rossler decryption and Khol decryption electrical circuits and comparison of the two decryption circuit’s outputs.

HIGH EFFICIENCY UNITY POWER FACTOR BATTERY CHARGER
Norman Luwei Jin
Notre Dame Preparatory School, Pontiac, MI

Electric vehicles are much more efficient than gasoline powered vehicles, have zero emissions, and reduce our dependency on fossil fuels. High power battery chargers are key components of electrical vehicles.<br><br>With no power factor correction (PFC) circuit, a battery can only be charged in a very narrow time window, called conduction angle, around the peak of the input voltage, which induces harmonic distortions in the battery charger input current, and reduces power factor. While conventional PFC does provide excellent power factor, it adds the full loss of PFC onto the loss of the charger. This is due to PFC operating continuously independent of input voltage, even if the input voltage is sufficient to charge the battery. My project presents a new charger design topology in which the PFC can be dynamically turned on and off based on the instant input voltage, and is only activated when the charging voltage slips below the battery voltage. This new design has the following advantages:<br><br>1. Provides the same power factor correction as a design with a typical PFC circuit.<br><br>2. The PFC circuit delivers only a fraction of the charger’s total power, greatly reducing its power requirements.<br><br>3. Leads to lower charger cost, lighter weight, and higher overall charger efficiency.<br><br> A thorough mathematical study of the relationship between the ratio of the battery voltage to the peak input voltage and the resulting power factor was conducted based on harmonic distortion analysis.<br><br> A circuit diagram of the new charger was created and a software control flowchart was developed. Computer simulations of both the new proposed design and a charger without PFC using the electronic simulation tool Powersim were performed. Simulation results yield a corrected power factor of over 0.97.

CREATING AND EVALUATING A LOW COST INTERACTIVE WHITEBOARD
Gregory James Scanlon
Holy Name High School, Reading, PA

The purpose of this project was twofold. The first was to transform a standard projector screen, using a Nintendo Wii remote control, computer and an infrared (IR) pen, into an interactive whiteboard, for a fraction of the cost of a commercial whiteboard. The second purpose was to determine optimum positioning of the Wii remote in a classroom by evaluating how the accuracy of the signal was affected by both the distance and the elevation between the user holding the IR pen (transmitter) and the Wii remote (receiver). The optimum positioning of the Wii remote relative to the user was measured by determining the percentage of times a particular task was successfully performed. Each success indicated that the receiver had accurately detected the infrared signal. For the purposes of this study the task involved dragging cartoon sheep from one pasture to another. It was expected that the success rate would be a strong function of both the distance between the Wii Remote and IR pen and their relative heights. The results showed that there was a definite optimum position of the receiver relative to the user. The success decreased dramatically when the horizontal distance of the remote was either too close to or too far from the pen/user. At intermediate distances, the success rate curve exhibited a maximum. Signal detection was a strong function of the relative height of the remote, due to potential obstruction of the beam by the user. Maximum height of the remote corresponded to maximum success rates.

NEXT GENERATION PROPULSION: THE ALFA MARKVI
Jesse Kane Ellison
Bayfield High School, Bayfield, CO

My project improves on an existing thruster called the PIT, which uses fast rising electromagnetic fields to ionize a fuel and propel it away creating thrust. My design ionizes the gas prior to firing in order to create a current sheet much sooner than the PIT. In previous years I proved that my concept was correct. This year I designed and built a full size propulsion system to test my concept on the same level as other thrusters currently in development. I designed a novel power-train to transfer the energy stored in the capacitors to the drive coil. I also designed a fuel injection valve that achieves much better gas distribution across the face of the thruster's drive coil than previous NASA designs. I designed and built a very efficient charging system to store energy from normal 120 V AC source in a 1200 V capacitor. I used high voltage DC to ionize the fuel. An electrode covers the entire face of the drive coil and acts as the anode. A cathode then emits electrons into the thruster's plume to neutralize the plasma. The entire system is controlled by a PIC microcontroller. I tested the set-up in a vacuum chamber that I designed to replicate the environment of space. To measure thrust, the thruster, ALFA (Assisted Lorenz Force Accelerator), was suspended on a spring system with the drive coil pointing up. An accelerometer was used to analyze the motion of the ALFA markVI and determine acceleration and thus, thrust.

GREEN ENGINE: AN EXPLORATION OF SMALL ENGINE DESIGN
Brantley Chance Henson
Carlsbad High School, Carlsbad, NM

There is an apparent need for “greener” technology in today’s society. While many macro scale technologies are being designed to meet this need, there is little being done for “green” micro scale technologies. In an attempt to create a “greener” micro scale technology, I have designed and constructed a small engine. The design of the engine is a compilation of several other small engine designs. It utilizes the principles of both the Stirling engine and the steam engine. The engine itself is driven by steam generated in a parabolic trough. The steam leaves the trough where it lifts a piston. After the piston reaches top dead center, the steam is cycled through as exhaust into a pipe that serves as a heat exchanger where it is condensed back into liquid water. The water then reenters the parabolic trough, and the cycle repeats. Materials used to construct this engine include: Wafer board, construction paper, Reflectech mirror film, ¾” copper tubing and joints, heater hose, steel ball bearings, recycled hospital ventilator diaphragm, and a recycled heat exchanger. This engine design is currently most applicable to the production of small amounts of electricity and to pump smaller volumes of water.

A MAZE SOLVING ROBOT
John Frank Keller Jr
The King's Academy, Mohrsville, PA

The purpose of this project was to build a robot that could be placed in a known environment, autonomously discover its position, and plot a path to a goal location. An iRobot Create and a Lego Mindstorm robot were programmed to work together in order to accomplish this task. The Mindstorm was mounted on top of the Create. The Create was used to move around the environment and the Mindstorm was used to control the Create’s movement. The Mindstorm pressed buttons on the Create to tell it where to go. The Create gathered information about the environment from only left and right bump sensors. It flashed one of its LEDs a certain amount of times based on how far it traveled. The Mindstorm made use of this information by counting the flashes with its light sensor. The Mindstorm used the information it received to estimate the Create’s position and then gave the Create commands on how to get to the goal.<br><br> Results show that the localization and path finding algorithms employed worked well. Some problems arose because the Create drifted off course, however, the algorithm attempted to combat this by anticipating inaccuracy in measurement. The interaction between the two robots was very successful. They effectively communicated with each other exclusively with their hardware. There was no software link between them. Overall, the robot team worked well together and was successful in completing its task.

NATURE'S ELECTRICITY
Taylor Frances Kinyon
Plankinton High School, Plankinton, SD

Static electricity begins when two materials that lie apart on the triboelectric series touch each other and are pulled away. Their parting transfers electrons from one material to another storing up energy through charge separation. I began to wonder if this energy could be contained and put to use. For my storage devices I used two home-built capacitors called Leyden jars.<br><br>To create the energy, I built a hand-driven electric generator which I tested in many ways, always taking humidity into account. Careful measurements were made during every test so that I could create the greatest possible charge separation with the minimum amount of effort. My original goal to charge up a small battery proved to be inefficient, and I turned to running an electrostatic motor instead. I now have a generator that can produce clean energy by merely pushing a rod back and forth. Although its power output is small, my device is extremely easy to use. It would be ideal for teaching the production of static electricity in the schoolroom or developed into an inexpensive renewable source of energy. Many improvements in my generator are still possible and are being actively pursued.

HOVERCRAFT, PHASE III
Christopher Allyn Taylor
Northview High School, Brazil, IN

A researcher wanted to further increase the capability to move heavy objects or loads with air. First they started with a previous year hovercraft and redesigned the thruster and lift components. The old 15 hp engine was replaced by a 35 hp engine with the same mass. The new engine turns 1400 rpm faster then the original. The researcher added a few more square and triangle braces to insure structural strength since the new engine has 130 percent more power. The platform remained the same with foam core construction to keep it afloat in case an engine failure occurs while over water. To maintain a low center of gravity the engine was mounted as low as possible. With the removal of the old engine and centrifugal lift fan the hovercraft had to be rebalanced, so the front or back would not drag the ground. The seat could not be moved to adjust for this; therefore, the motor and propeller were moved accordingly. The new design for the thruster was a propeller that produces 69,000 cubic feet of airflow per minute and is perfectly balanced, while the centrifugal lift fan only produced 9,338 cubic feet of airflow per minute. The rudders, located aft of the craft allow steering capability by directing the airflow. With the adjustments made to the third year project the craft did lift heavier payloads and move at a higher velocity with great proficiency.

NOVEL DEVELOPMENT OF MULTIPLE BRUSHLESS DIRECT CURRENT SYNCHRONOUS ELECTRIC MOTORS: A FOUR YEAR DISCOURSE
Andrew Garrett Amis
Clinton High School, Clinton, MS

Novel developments include the design and production of multiple brushless DC synchronous electric motors. The harmonized classification consists of a mutually-oriented bilateral motor configuration in addition to two supplementary concomitant, plesiochronous prototypes, founded upon an aggregate quaternary electromagnet permutation in axial succession of the archetypes developed in the previous three years of engineering inquiry: a reed switch motor, a transistor-based motor, a Hall effect motor, and an optocoupler motor. A vehicular paradigm harmonizing dual reed switch rotors serves to substantiate the prospect of integration into the sustainable transportation sphere. Throughout the experimental trials, the bilateral dipole and the quaternary combinatorial motors yielded over one thousand collective measurements. The line of investigation included: cost, complexity, reliability, acceleration, revolutions per minute, relative torque, maximum parasitic load, and efficiency. Manipulated variables included: voltage, gauge of wire, quantity of rotor magnets, quantity of electromagnets, magnet configuration, motor configuration, rotor size, and velocity control. Analysis of the results substantiated both nominally linear and exponential correlations between the experimental parameters, leading to the discovery of a never-before documented empirical relationship between specified electronic components and cogent functional capacity. This knowledge has led to the development of highly-advantageous electric motors with applications in energy and resource management, sustainability, environmental conservation, transportation, and industry in its entirety. An avenue for alternative energy, these novel design systems reduce the number of parts and process steps, reduce GHG emissions, create a low-carbon, resource-recirculating society, and save resources and energy while simultaneously achieving improved operational parameters.

HARVESTING HUMAN ENERGY: THE EFFECT OF MAGNETIC FIELD FLUX ON INDUCED EMF
Elan Meir Ness-Cohn
Niles North High School, Skokie, IL

The purpose of this research is to discover a means to harvest energy by converting the mechanical energy of pressing a key on a keyboard into electrical energy. It was hypothesized that if kinetic energy is used to move a key with a coil within a magnetic field, then a change in flux will induce an emf (Electromotive Force) that can be captured and stored for later use.<br><br> 3-D modeling software and magnets were used to construct the keyboard. A diode, resistor, capacitor, and magnetic wire were used to construct the circuit. Data was collected using a voltage and current probe attached at two different points in the circuit. For each data point, a total of 300 presses—30 key strokes from each of the 10 trials—were recorded.<br><br> Experimentally, 0.454 volts and 0.0849 amperes were induced in the charging circuit, resulting in a calculated 0.0385 watts. 0.143 volts and 0.0145 amperes were discharged, resulting in a calculated 0.00207 watts. Comparing the watts of the charge and discharge circuit, 5.88% of the energy generated was stored. Contrasting the experimental energy stored to the theoretical maximum storage capacity, the circuit was 61.1% efficient.<br><br> The data supported the hypothesis. The keyboard was able to collect a quantifiable amount of energy (about 8 minutes of iPod use hourly), but not at a high enough voltage for practical use. Further modifications must be made to create a working model: amplify/increase the induced voltage to be able to fully rectify the induced current, and a means to better store the energy.<br><br> At this point, the energy harvesting system can only extend battery life. As the energy required to power electronic devices decreases, it is hoped that the harvested energy can independently power portable electronic devices.

SATELLITE SOLAR PANEL LAUNCH SUPPORT & RELEASE MECHANISM
Abdulmohsen Mohammed Albelushi
Dahrahan Ahliyaa School, Dahrahan, central, SAUDI ARABIA

Solar panels are the main power source in MIT’s satellite CASTOR. A latch mechanism must be designed so it can support these panels and release them. The solar panels launch support mechanism (latch) is used to hold the solar panels firmly to the satellite, especially during launch where the vehicle experiences a 3-10 g force. The satellite is exposed to high frequency vibrations that might damage these panels. It must also be ensured that the latch will release the panels gently once the satellite reaches Low Earth Orbit (LEO). MIT’s satellite team’s main goal is to build a satellite that is capable of reaching LEO and demonstrate the performance of the Diverging Cusped-Field Thrusters (DCFT). In order to achieve these requirements, the latch mechanism must be able to fully deploy the solar panels, so they can provide the thrusters with the required power. This project includes the steps of designing and machining a solar latch through three stages: the use of Solidworks software, Cosmosworks simulator, and mechanical machining of the latch mechanism. Results from this project demonstrate and prove that the solar latch has the structural ability to hold the panels and resist a 20 g force.

The research problem is the addressed the difficulty of mobility for deaf-blind individuals because of their audio and visual disability. The research aims to develop a device that is placed on the knee of the deaf-blind person. The researcher assumed that using Knee Eye Device (KED) assists in altering deaf-blind when facing high and horizontally-positioned obstacles and holes because the ultrasonic technology is the best available to implement the solution. Also it is assumed that the KED alerts the individuals through vibration at appropriate distance for advance warning purposes.<br><br>The tools used are a micro-controller unit (NXT), ultrasonic sensors, LEGO motors, NXT-G program, cables and LEGO bricks. First the range of sensor's view has been tested to choose the best sensor orientation . Then the distance between the sensor and obstacles has been tested and adjusted to select the appropriate distance for warning. The variables affecting the experiment are obstacles' height, obstacles' distance, step length, walking speed, and individual's height.<br><br>Results were that the top and middle sensors will be placed vertically and the bottom sensor will be placed horizontally. The best distance to warn an individual about an obstacle is 110-120cm. the experiment indicated that the device can detect objects which are positioned horizontally, objects above the knee level and hoes. Also, KED generated vibrations with different intensity according to the obstacles distance.<br><br>KED assists in meeting the individual needs for the deaf-blind in identifying people and objects, navigation and data recording.

PROGRAMMABLE LOGIC CONTROLLER USED TO PROGRAM ALARMS FOR CHILD CAR SEATS
Virginia Lynne Martin
Academics Etc., Lake Charles, LA

The purpose of this project is to develop an automated alarm system to alert drivers and emergency responders that a child has been left unattended in a motor vehicle. Many children left in vehicles have died of Hyperthermia. In the United States of America hyperthermia, or heat stroke, has been the cause of death for four hundred young children left and forgotten in a cars since 1998. Thirteen of those children have been from the state of Louisiana. The temperature can quickly rise, dangerously high in a parked, closed vehicle even on a cool day. In just ten minutes the temperature can rise to 100 degrees Fahrenheit and as time passes it can elevate to 160 degrees Fahrenheit. Hyperthermia occurs when the body produces or absorbs more heat than it can dissipate. Leaving a baby in a closed vehicle is like putting the child in an oven. This project was built using a Programmable Logic Controller(PLC). The PLC was programmed using a computer. The computer is also use to monitor the PLC during the testing phase, and to make modifications to the programming. This equipment will be used to detect the presence of a child in a car<br><br>seat. The system will be integrated in the vehicle’s electrical system and in the child’s car seat. To demonstrate the program, a test stand was built to include a car seat with a weighted doll, warning lights, a Programmable Logic Controller, an automated voice dialer, and a power supply. The alarm uses lights and/or phone<br><br>calls to alert the driver and/or emergency responders. A car seat was modified to include weight activated switches that are used to detect the presence of a child. The switches were used as inputs to a Programmable Logic Controller. A reminder alarm system such as this one, would eliminate many unnecessary deaths in children.

MOTION POWERED RECHARGER

Dr. Ronald E. McNair Academic High School, Jersey City, NJ

As the world tries to be greener and environmentally friendlier I hoped to contribute to its efforts. I wanted to make something an average person has and make it run completely on reusable energy. Yet, I also wished to come up with a new alternative energy source. Instead of creating new technology, I decided to go back to the basics, the fundamentals, i.e. man power. Just like the cavemen did everything with their hands I wanted to make something that it is powered by people. What became of this thought turned into the goal of my project; which was to come up with a portable device which can recharge small gadgets, such as cell phones or iPods, using eco-friendly means. I used motion or movements of the human body that we unconsciously make when we are walking, for example, and used it to swing a pendulum through a metal coil. As an application of Faraday’s Law, the motion will produce electricity. I worked on ways to make the device more efficient, such as the aerodynamics of the pendulum, reducing friction, adding more coils, attempted to make it more compact, etc. The device stores the energy and can be used for various applications. My engineering goal was to indeed create such a device. The experimental results supported my goal by showing that energy was indeed created with this device and that the motion that we create could be harnessed into useful energy. The experiment also showed that the increase in the rate of movement also plays a role in how much electricity is generated. This device could be helpful in situations when a person needs energy for their gadgets; it saves money, and helps the environment.

DEMONSTRATION OF TERAHERTZ WAVEGUIDES USING STRUCTURED METAL FILMS
Albert Cui
Hillcrest High School, Midvale, UT

Although information processing and data communication rates have increased dramatically in recent years, there is an ongoing desire to extend this trend. However, many believe that current electronic techniques are becoming increasingly unable to meet this demand due to issues with RC-delay times, meaning that fundamentally new approaches are needed to increase data processing operating speeds to terahertz (THz) and higher frequencies. As a unit of information the photon is unmatched because it packages data in a signal of zero mass and has unmatched speed. Guided wave devices afford a simple and compact means for harnessing the potential of this unit of information.<br><br> This investigation successfully demonstrates of planar plasmonic THz guided-wave devices using periodically perforated metal films. In comparison to previous planar waveguide structures, this structures demonstrated in this investigation exhibit tighter confinement in y and z directions and a lower x propagation loss. A longer propagation length allows one to consider the fabrication of THz circuits (i.e. connecting several THz devices in series and in parallel). This is fundamentally important in the development of active waveguides and optical circuits, which are seen as viable solutions to the current stalling of information processing and data communication rates.

Redeemer Baptist School, North Parramatta, New South Wales, AUSTRALIA

In the face of dwindling reserves of fossil fuels, the global community has mobilised a push for renewable energy. However, their present flag-bearer, solar energy, is heavily dependent on the Sun’s orientation and climatic conditions. Another, less known, form of renewable energy is thermoelectric energy and this quantitative investigation demonstrates how this continuous energy source would ideally supplement solar energy.<br><br>A thermoelectric peltier module, consisting of two thermal-conducting ceramic plates with a layer of p-doped and n-doped semi-conductive bismuth telluride alloy between them, uses electrical energy to dissipate and absorb heat energy at respective plates. In a series of four triplicate experiments, the peltier was operated in reverse, with a difference in temperature generating an electric current. Using hot water in an insulated chamber connected to one side of the peltier and a fabricated water-cooled heat sink as the cool side, the 65°C temperature differential generated 2.3V. As the insulated chamber's temperature decreased, so did the voltage output at a linear rate (r = 0.9997). For a 55°C temperature differential, a power output of 20mW was calculated for the 40 x 40mm peltier, equivalent to a standardised 12.5W/m2. In comparison, Sydney’s 2426 annual sunlight hours generates an average 26.7W/m2 for a 180W solar panel.<br><br>As well as supplementing solar energy, peltiers have applications in powering personal electronic safety and communication equipment when embedded in the clothing of divers, mountain climbers, astronauts and even joggers, where the external environmental temperatures is markedly different to body heat.

A NOVEL NAVIGATIONAL AID FOR THE BLIND
Rose Doris Perrone
The Catlin Gabel School, Portland, OR

I prototyped three versions of a navigational aid that vibrates when it points north, intended for blind people. I hypothesize that our brains are able to subconsciously assimilate this new sensory apparatus that detects north, and subsequently gain a heightened sense of orientation. Because sense of spatial orientation largely determines a person's sense of direction, I hypothesize the navigational ability of my subjects will increase after a three-week training period in which they wear my device. I designed behavioral tests to track change in navigational ability.<br><br>After creating three prototypes and researching all types of orientation sensors, I conclude that a gyroscope is the only type of orientation sensor feasible for this device. Yet current gyroscopes are either too inaccurate or too large for use in my device. It's only a matter of time, however, until available gyroscopes will be both accurate and small enough for my device's needs, and blind people will get to use my device.

PASSIVE SOLAR AIR COOLING/HEATING USING GEOLOGICAL INSULATION
William Gregory Thornbury
De La Salle High School, Concord, CA

My goal for this project was to develop a cost efficient, “green” method for cooling or heating ambient air that could be used to remedy problems our environment faces today and in the future with intensifying climate problems. In this experiment I built two U-shaped PVC pipe apparatuses made of two 7 foot segments of 3 inch and 6 inch PVC pipe that were connected by a 2 foot segment and two elbow-joints. I dug a four foot trench into the soil with an auger and buried the 6 inch apparatus. I attached a solar powered fan to one of the open ends and created an airtight seal. From 12:00-1:00 PM and from 1:30-2:30 PM I measured the temperature of the air flowing into the apparatus, the temperature of the air flowing out of the apparatus, the soil temperature on and 4 feet below the surface, and the humidity. In both the 12:00-1:00 and 1:30-2:30 time period there was a significant increase in temperature after circulation (supported by a 2-sample t test). The temperature of the soil 4 feet below the surface remained relatively constant throughout the entire experiment ranging from 11-13⁰C. Consequently, future climate change would have little effect on the soil temperature if I were to dig deeper to where the temperature of the soil is even more stable. Therefore, as our planet's climate intesifies, my research can reduce the percentage of crops lost to extreme weather conditions and mitigate temperature fluctuations in new housing developments while cutting energy costs by cooling or heating the surrounding air.

VSR-2 TALOS: FG, THE FINAL ULTIMATUM
Adam Bradley Halverson
Garretson High School, Garretson, SD

My project's current purpose is to finish the development of my former team's final bipedal robot VSR-2: Talos FG. This machine is the result of three years of automaton development that has been geared towards creating a functional and economically feasible service robot.<br><br>The first two years of research and development created "VSR-1: Talos", which proved to be a successful project in many ways; unfortunately, many critical faults were present that limited all aspects of functionality. This caused a plethora of problems, and ultimately resulted in the demise of the entire machine.<br><br>After a year focused entirely on structural and electrical re-fabrication, we created a prototype of VSR-2: Talos FG: our most advanced biped.<br><br>This year, I focused much of my energies on finishing the complex mechanical structure and electrical network. This was a long process of trial and error, for bringing all the parts together presented unforeseen problems involving co-functionality. Once these hurdles had been passed over, I was finally able to begin connecting the electrical networks together and bring about the finished physical structure of VSR-2: Talos FG.<br><br>When this process was finished, I began the most daunting task of the project: Programming and Electrical Component Synchronization. Using the BASIC programming language and Visual Sequencer, I was able to begin experimentation in networking the many individual on-board electronics. After weeks of synchronization and electrical system upgrades, full autonomous motor control had been established. Continued work with the internal computer system will be needed in order to ensure competent responses to environmental variables. With a fully operational mechanical structure, an indefinite amount of programming can now take place.

SWARM ROBOTICS
Bryce Joseph Reitano
Dixie Middle School, St. George, UT

I thought of this project in the thought of getting difficult tasks done that could not be done with one machine or robot. I also thought it would be a great learning experience with the hardware I used in my project. The purpose of this project alone isn't the robot, not what it can not do, but what I can accomplish with it.<br><br> To accomplish this project I had to repeat many processes over and over. I started with the basic design to determine my budget before hand. The budget was set and I started with the more specific schematics, blueprints, and other workings of the project. After the near exact design was chosen I went full ahead and ordered the products. I quickly manufactured the robots in the short amount of time I had. I went straight into programming simple movements, which included moving forward, back, swerving right or left, and lifting it arm and putting it back down. I arranged that into easy to program functions.<br><br> I was not able to finish my project as desired in the time given between the start date and the end date. I worked my project past my official end date, I continued working on it until I finished it with my first goal of my project.

A NOVEL FIBER OPTIC BACKLIGHT SYSTEM UTILIZING CONTROLLED LIGHT ATTENUATION
Scott Douglas Olson
Highland High School, Gilbert, AZ

The development and production of the flat-screen liquid crystal display (LCD) has long been the staple of the commercial display industry, but its fragility, viewing limitations, and the rigid two-dimensional structure have left many potential applications of current display technology ignored. Primarily, the shortcomings of display systems exist within their backlighting structure. The goal of this project is the development of a backlight system which manipulates the physical characteristics of fiber optics while utilizing the effects of controlled light attenuation. Three design prototypes will be fabricated: a micro-model backlight prototype, a macro-model single strand optics testing apparatus, and a macro-model backlight prototype. Measurement criteria include flexibility, durability, efficiency, enhanced viewing angle, cost effectiveness and production. This project will model, test, and evaluate a novel fiber optic backlight design, which utilizes controlled light attenuation, on both a micro and macro scale. <br><br> Final results showed this backlight system to have increased flexibility and durability over current systems, along with having an enhanced viewing angle. On testing, the prototypes did not meet the power efficiency criterion due to utilization of crude materials and fabrication techniques. Cost effectiveness and production results were inconclusive. Further testing, using higher quality materials and advanced fabrication techniques, needs to occur before the system’s efficiency and cost performance can be legitimately assessed. The design remains a viable backlight contender. Practical applications for this system include a proposed actuation system for fiber optic backlight for display capabilities, along with military camouflage, underwater lighting devices, and extremely large, high resolution displays.

DISTRIBUTED LEARNING FOR DYNAMIC SPECTRUM SHARING IN COGNITIVE RADIO NETWORKS: A DECISION THEORETIC APPROACH
Angela Yu-Yun Yeung
Davis Senior High School, Davis, CA

Cognitive radio is the next-generation technology that will enable wireless systems to address and manage critical issues in the realms of spectrum efficiency, interference, and coexisting networks. A developing application for this technology is opportunistic spectrum access (OSA), where secondary users, equipped with cognitive radios capable of sensing and learning the communication environment, identify and exploit instantaneous spectrum opportunities without interfering with primary users. While the idea is conceptually simple, the interaction between distributed secondary users presents a multitude of challenges in policy development. This research seeks to find high-performance, low-complexity solutions to the spatially heterogeneous scenario of OSA interaction, where secondary users may be geographically distributed. Work done prior to this project investigated the spatially homogeneous scenario, where secondary users are in such proximity that their spectrum opportunities are determined by the same pool of primary users, but this research tackles the greater challenge that arises when users’ spectrum opportunities may be determined by different pools of primary users. In this research, the problem is modeled by a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process. A novel policy, the Collision History-based Prediction (CHP) policy, was developed, and shown through simulation to perform significantly better than the existing published policy. Implementation of carrier sensing and partial partitioning schemes further increased the network throughput of the CHP policy to a final improvement of up to 68.4% over the existing published policy. This research has diverse potential applications ranging from cell phone networks to military communications and emergency response.

HYBRID POLYMER SOLAR CELLS BASED ON ZINC OXIDE NANORODS AND THE WATER-SOLUBLE POLYMER PTEBS
Andrew Douglas Sylvester
Mills E. Godwin High School, Richmond, VA

In most industrialized countries the price of solar power is greater than the price of power from the electrical grid; this makes it hard to convince people to switch to solar energy. Polymer solar cells are a much cheaper solar cell, at this time however they do not have a large enough efficiency to be a feasible alternative to silicon solar cells. The purpose of this experiment was to investigate polymer solar cells that use Zinc Oxide nanorods as the n-type semiconductor and a water-soluble polymer PTEBS and attempt to increase their efficiencies. Several procedures were tested to make the backing layer and the Zinc Oxide nanopowder procedure was the only procedure that produced a smooth, even, and thick enough backing layer. Based on SEM images taken it was found that the 50 nm Zinc Oxide nanopowder produced a larger number of smaller and denser nanorods which produce better photovoltaic devices. This was latter confirmed when the solar cells were tested. It was also determined that a thicker backing layer allowed for better growth of nanorods and therefore produced a more efficient device. The best efficiency of any photovoltaic device was one of the cells made from four layers of 50 nm Zinc Oxide powder with .2 ml of polymer and no layers of Zinc Acetate. This photovoltaic device had an efficiency of 0.0057 %. This efficiency is not large enough to be a viable option though improvements could be made to this experiment to increase efficiencies of the devices.

LESS SWEAT OR LESS FATIGUE? MY SMARTBIKE DOES THE REST!
David Andrew Zarrin
Saratoga High School, Saratoga, CA

I researched the physics of transferring power through moving gears. Unlike the traditional gear system, a CVT transmission can provide a near infinite range of gear ratios. However previous attempts to build continuous transmissions have required the use of cones and/or belts, which are inherently less efficient. So, I set out to build and test a better bicycle transmission. <br><br>My hypothesis is “the use of a real-time microcomputer and a clever chain-drive CVT can convert more of my energy into bicycle movement than the conventional gear design”.<br><br>My plan is to a) empirically model the inefficiencies of a conventional gear system; b) demonstrate how such mechanical inefficiencies would reduce cyclist road efficiencies; c) build an appropriate simulation model; d) design and then build a new CVT; and e) test the hypothesis by comparing the new prototype to the conventional transmission design.<br><br>One of my challenges was to maintain the high mechanical efficiency of a chain-drive transmission in a continuously variable transmission. To my knowledge, this has never been accomplished before. Other attempts at CVT [in general] have used belts, which cannot transfer energy as well as the mechanical coupling of a chain on gear. The belt on a cone makes for an easy and continuous change of gear ratio. But, how do you accomplish this continuous ratio with chains?<br><br><br>The simulation results and the prototype showed that it is possible to build energy-efficient CVTs that could deliver up to 24% more energy with up to 40% higher Z-Factor under certain road conditions. The concept of transferring mechanical energy from one point to another is fundamental to many devices and applications. This study shows how to apply CVT technology to permit the building of more energy-efficient vehicles.

DON'T BREAK THE SURFACE TENSION: DESIGNING A BIOMIMETIC WATER STRIDER ROBOT
Emily Louise Baas
Saint Patrick Catholic High School, Biloxi, MS

The purpose of this project is to design and build a biomimetic water strider robot that will not break surface tension. It was hypothesized that the designing and building of a water strider robot would work. After having built a working prototype, this hypothesis has been proven correct. The core of this project focused on how much weight a single leg of this robot could support with disturbing interfacial tension. By using equations to find Young's modulous of carbon fiber, bending stiffness, the length of capillary waves, and the length of elastocapillary waves, I was able to calculate the appropriate length that the legs of the robot should have in order to not shatter surface tension, but still have the maximum amount of weight displaced. <br><br> After these calculations were completed, the water striding robot was built using carbon fiber rods for its legs, carbon fiber plating for motor housing, hydrophobic Teflon spray (polytetrafluoroethylene, -(CF_2CF_2)-), three compact motors, and the steering components’ of two radio controlled tanks. The building of a robot that can move on the water’s surface tension is possible, to the extent in which this project has proven it.

DEVELOPING AN AUTOMATED SUN SEEKING SOLAR PANEL SYSTEM
Dora Young Chen
Oxford High School, Oxford, MS

Solar energy made up only 0.01% of the total energy consumed by Americans in 2008. If solar energy could be made more cost effective, then consumers could save money, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and reduce foreign energy dependence. For my project, I designed a system that will automatically turn a solar panel to face the sun without a preprogrammed route. The system is based on the relationship between shadow length and the sun’s angle. After capturing an image of the shadow of a nail, the computer processes the image through multiple steps and calculates the angle of the sun. The angle measure is sent to the microcontroller board which directs the servo to turn the solar panel to the correct angle. When tested in a lab environment and outdoors, the system proved accurate. It was small, precise, and cost effective.

Multiple component chalcopyrite semiconductors, such as CuInSe2 , have been regarded as one of the most promising materials for photovoltaics because of their low toxicity and high conversion efficiency. We aimed to synthesis of high quality CuInSe2, CuGaSe2, and Cu(InGa)Se2 nanocrystals for to establish nontoxic solar cell system. <br><br> In the experimental part of the work CuInSe2, CuGaSe2, and Cu(InGa)Se2 nanoparticles were synthesized. Characterizations of the nanoparticles were made by SEM, AFM, and SAX analyses. <br><br> Nanoparticles were coated on to copper plate surface as thin films. Electrical resistivity of all samples was measured with Current-Voltage mesurement by two point contact When CuInSe2 CuGaSe2 ve Cu(InGa)Se2 irradated with UVB radiation, electrical resistivity decreased with depending on the irradiation time. This means that conductivity increased with irradiation time. Electrical resistivity increased with other nanoparticles thus conductivity decreased. But the most effective results seen with CuInSe2. <br><br> Similar results obtained with mercury lamb irradiation. Electrical resistivity turned on initial value after 5 minutes light off. Thus experimented properties were reversible.<br><br> As conclusion, we have demonstrated a synthesis of CuInSe2, CuGaSe2, Cu(InGa)Se2 coated nanocrystals nanoparticles by careful adjustment of precursors and ligands. Photoresponse from drop-cast film of these nanoparticles was also observed. Tuning the size and composition of the materials combined with their low-cost precursors and initial photoresponse suggest promise in optical and electronic applications.

Very often Motor Bicycle riders tend to forget to unfold the side stand before they start riding. This can lead to accidents. When side stand hit on ground, it will make moving Motor Bicycle to loose it’s balance and then to skid off. <br><br> A survey was done by interviewing Motor Cycle users and found that riding Motor Cycle with side stand in ‘down’ position pose a threat to the rider. It was revealed that accidents caused by this have incurred injuries to the riders and also damages to Motor Bicycles.<br><br> After studding on various types of side stands and side stand protections in the market, a simple fool proof accident free side stand was developed.<br><br> This newly developed side stand is locked in its ‘down’ position by a mechanical lock provided at the pivot point of the stand arm. Lock is operated by a rod pushed up by the thrust on side stand foot only when bike is rested on the stand. When Bicycle is straightened, thrust on the foot is relieved and arm automatically return to the ‘up’ position.<br><br> Length of the side stand arm can be designed to suit any type of Motor Bicycle.

SIMULATING OCEAN WATER FOR VIDEO LASER COMMUNICATION
Mark Evan Ragland
Saint Marys Ryken High School, Leonardtown, MD

Experimentation in the field is expensive, time consuming and difficult. My experiment will derive equations that can be used to simulate the optical properties of any type of ocean water using tap water and chemical contaminants. This will allow for extensive testing of optical equipment in different types of ocean water to be done in the comfort of a lab. <br><br> First I found chemical contaminants that, when added to tap water, would change the water’s optical properties: the absorption and scattering of light. I then added these contaminants in increments to tap water and graphed the data. With these graphs, I could observe exactly how these contaminants affected the optical properties of water. With my data, I was able to derive equations that, given a type of ocean water, would calculate how much contaminant to add to tap water to mimic the optical properties of the ocean water. <br><br> The equations I derived are: <br><br>(Scatter coefficient/488.53)+1.0234x10¬-5=Concentration of scatter contaminant <br><br>(Absorption coefficient/3478.8)-1.7132x10¬-5=Concentration of absorption contaminant.<br><br> Using these equations, I simulated Clear Ocean, Coastal Ocean and Turbid Harbor water. To show my simulated ocean water was accurate the difference between it and actual ocean water had to be <0.1c. The difference I found was 0.08c.<br><br> I then tested my video laser communication system through simulated clear ocean water and found that my signal could travel 131 meters, while in turbid harbor water, 9.04m. This shows that my equations for simulating ocean water were accurate, and that they are usable for testing optical equipment.

THE AUTOMATED MAILBOX
Zach Kenneth Williford
D. H. Conley High School, Greenville, NC

The objective of the Automated Mailbox is to allow users to know the status of their mailbox at all times from the comfort of their homes. The mailbox communicates wirelessly with an inside Homebox that alerts the user of any changes in their mailboxes state. The Mailbox Sender detects mail with the use of three infrared sensors that check for mail once the door has been opened and closed. The mailbox then checks the state of the flag to see if the mail is either incoming or outgoing. The status is then sent to the receiving Homebox. The Homebox alerts the user audibly with the use of a text-to-speech card and visually with two LEDs and an LCD screen. <br><br>This invention is extremely useful for families who live in farming communities whose mailboxes may be located up to a mile away from their house. It also can help the elderly who do not need to be making unnecessary trips out to their mailbox to find that the mail has not yet arrived.

CAN THE CONCEPT OF STEREO VISION BE APPLIED IN ROBOTICS?
Arjun Aggarwal
Lexington High School, Lexington, SC

Each eye views the world from a slightly different vantage point. Stereoscopic vision results from the combination of the two images received by the brain from each eye. The fusion of these two slightly different pictures from our two eyes gives us the sensation of strong three-dimensionality or relative depth. This depth perception gives us the ability for accurate hand-eye coordination. The intent of this study was to determine if by using the concept of stereo vision a robot could calculate the coordinates of a target object. The concept of triangulation was applied to derive mathematical formulas for calculating the coordinates of a target object in relation to a robot’s position. A robot was constructed to check the results against actual physical measurements. This research was conducted over a period of eight months. A total of fifteen versions of the robot were constructed. Strength and weakness of each version was analyzed and the subsequent version was made to improve on the previous version. As the research progressed web cameras were used for autonomous tracking of the target object. For each working version of the robot observations were made for computing the distance of the target object, against a set standard matrix. The computed distance was calculated using a formula derived during the course of the research. 40 such readings were taken to compare the derived coordinates as against the measured coordinates for each version of the robot. Across all the models, the percentage range of difference in the derived verses the measured values was 8% and -8%. This experiment along with further research on stereo vision & current technologies of autonomous robotic navigation confirm that concept of stereo vision can be effectively applied in robotics.

ENGINEERING A SUPERIOR HORSE-TYING DEVICE
Somer Harper Hand
Academic Magnet High School, North Charleston, SC

In the world of horses and their riders, there exists a need for a new-and-improved device to tie horses. Current tying methods are usually inconsistent, unreliable, difficult to use, and can be dangerous if a horse panics and tries to escape. One of the primary reasons for these flaws is a lack of integration of the engineering concepts of optimal tensile strength and breakaway force into the design of the device. The ideal horse tying device must be able to do three things: hold a horse in a normal situation, “give” or stretch when a horse leans on it, and safely release for emergency. This project demonstrates that if these essential product characteristics are met, then it is possible to create a more ideal horse-tying device. <br><br>To identify the essential product characteristics, the customer needs were determined and existing products currently in use by equestrians were collected and tested to a panic load of 172.7 kg. It was found that twine was extremely inconsistent, and most existing products were either too strong or too weak for proper use. A prototype was fabricated and tested based on the product requirements and customer needs. Once the device was assembled, it was put through final verification testing and then tested in the field. In field testing, the device released consistently at the appropriate break force in the lab, and it allowed all horses a safe and efficient escape when panicked.

OPTIMAL ANGLE OF ATTACK FOR UNTWISTED WIND TURBINE BLADES
Lexie Kae Buchs
DeKalb High School, Waterloo, IN

This experiment will determine the optimal angle of attack with untwisted wind turbine blades. My purpose is to measure and compare the output air thrust of wind blades with varying pitch angles in order to verify the most efficient angle of attack. Which angle creates the maximum force of forward air movement with a fixed power input? My experiment was done with two different methods:<br><br>1. Air Thrust Up Method:<br><br>The work that the upward thrust of air pushed the scale downward was measured. The measurements were taken in grams. Each blade was secured on the motor shaft, the scale was tared to zero, and the motor turned on. The scale was read when the readings gained stability. Between each repetition the motor was turned off and the scale was tared again. Each blade pitch test was repeated twelve times on high and twelve times on low to increase reliability.<br><br>2. Air Thrust Down Method:<br><br>With this method of measurement the air thrust a direct force downward on the scale. The motor, shaft, and blade were all suspended so the scale would not include the weight of this structure. The scale only measured the thrust work of forced air. Each blade was secured to the motor shaft, the scale was tared to zero, and the motor was turned on. Twelve repetitions for each of the nine pitches are recorded on both high and low speeds.

BREAKING POINT: TESTING THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF CONCRETE USING ALTERNATE METHODS OF REINFORCEMENT
Alexander Matthew Zuelke
Whiteford High School, Ottawa Lake, MI

Concrete is a hard and porous composite of cement, sand, aggregate, and gravel. Concrete cement is a very compressively strong material after proper component mixture and curing. It has a compressive strength 15 times greater than its tensile strength. Because of the lack of tensile strength, reinforcement is needed.<br><br> <br><br>Steel rebar is the most common method of reinforcement used in building concrete structures. Steel can rust and corrode over time and leave structures compromised. The purpose of this project is to test different methods of reinforcement to determine if there are plausible alternatives to steel rebar for the purpose of reinforcing concrete. It is believed that changing the method of reinforcement will also change the structural integrity of the concrete. Although steel rebar is the most widely used reinforcement, it is expected that the carbon fiber strip reinforcement will be stronger than the traditional rebar. <br><br>After extensive testing it was found that the fiberglass was the weakest reinforcement used as it crumbled at the lowest average force. The carbon fiber strips and threads both held up under the maximum capacity of my scale before breaking, therefore the force needed to crumble them is listed at the maximum of 500 lbs, 226.75 kg or 2223.66 N.<br><br>The hypothesis was supported by the experimentation. The carbon fiber strips and the carbon fiber threads held up under the maximum force that could be measured, higher than any of the other materials being tested.

HELIUS: A SOLAR-TRACKING MECHANISM FOR EFFICIENCY MAX. OF PHOTOVOLTAIC MODULES
DMontae Gregory Jones
Saginaw Arts & Sciences Academy, Saginaw, MI

Photovoltaic modules are generally plagued with a common dilemma, lack of efficiency due to their immobility. One solution to this dilemma can be found in one of the vast wonders of our environment, the sunflower. The mystery behind this solution is the process known as heliotropism, the diurnal motion of plant parts (flowers or leaves) in the response to the direction of the sun.<br><br> This project will attempt to mechanically mimic the heliotrophic characteristics of the sunflower at its bud stage. The motion of the device will be powered by the Arduino microcontroller, and the OWI-535 Robotic Arm Edge.<br><br> Apart from the C++ coding, cross-partitions are implemented to ensure that the cell panel is always perpendicular to the direction of maximum illumination. If the panel is off-axis, one cell in a pair will be in partial shadow, so its output voltage will fall. The Arduino measures the voltage difference between the cells and turns on the appropriate drive motor to move the panel in the direction that will make it perpendicular again, when the shadow is eliminated.<br><br> The smart bit is making the measurements differential rather than absolute. If we just measured the illumination and used that as a guide, then the tracker would be fooled every time the Sun went behind a cloud. This way, if the panel is at right angles to the Sun, then the difference between the cells will be zero, no matter how bright the Sun is.

ENGINEERING A HYDROELECTRIC TURBINE TO HARNESS THE ENERGY OF TIDAL CHANGE
Reid William D'Amico
Hilton Head Preparatory School, Hilton Head Island, SC

A hydroelectric turbine converts the energy of tides into electricity and other useful types of power. Although this renewable energy is not widely used, tidal power has the potential to create a reliable form of electrical generation. The purpose of this experiment was to design a hydroelectric turbine demonstrating the Venturi effect and to determine the amount of electrical energy that can be captured by the turbine as the tides fluctuate. A prediction of an average of 106.1 watts was formulated by comprising an equation using the following elements: P= (1/2)NqA(V^3):P= Power in Watts, N= Efficiency, q= Density of the site’s salt water, A= Area of the mouth of turbine, V= Average velocity of salt water in location.<br><br> The first step was to design and build the turbine. In order to increase the energy harnessed, the turbine would have to demonstrate the Venturi effect in order to increase the velocity of the flowing water. Thus two cone-like devices were attached to either side of a shaft with an impeller inside. A series of aluminum braces are attached to the turbine to ensure a sturdy connection to a dock. As the impeller spins, a generator atop the turbine would also spin, therefore generating electrical energy to be read by a multimeter. <br><br> The average power captured by the turbine was determined to be 15.92 watts. While this value is lower than predicted, the output is still significant because approximately 15.00% of the power can be captured by a first year prototype. With further experimentation and adaptation, a more efficient device can be used and possibly implemented into personal use.

El Nasr Girls College, Alexandria, EGYPT

The safety of pedestrian from a vehicle design point of view has received a little attention in the past but this attention is increasing by time. The goal of the project is decreasing the harmful impacts that affect the pedestrian due to a collision by a vehicle which will significantly reduce pedestrian fatalities and injuries in the event of a crash. The research is focusing on two safety objectives; the reduction of initial force of the crash, and minimizing the force before it reaches the human body by designing a frontal fluid bag to do those functions. Relationship has been derived between the force needed to make the pedestrian survival possible and the velocity of impact. So the bag design aims to change the car collision from inelastic collision to tend to be perfect inelastic collision. A system has been developed that have the ability to predict the car accident before it takes place according to the critical conditions that happens in any car accident. The system can be manufactured and fitted in two different manners; the first will be fully automatic prediction system which works with using AVR microcontroller and digital signal processing (DSP) to predict the collision before it takes place to open a frontal fluid bag in specific position infront of the car. While the Second is semi automatic system which is portable, easy to be installed in existed cars with low cost and can fit any car consisting of single fluid bag with its attachments.

SPEED LIMITATION SYSTEM
Ahmed Samir Rashed Nouh
Mohamed Zahran Experimental Language School, Alexandria, Alexandria, EGYPT

A speed limitation system, its objective is to reduce the consequences of reckless over speed driving which causes a large number of accidents. The idea is to implement a certain control system that prevents the driver from going over the speed limit on the road he/she is driving on. In this project I designed a system of two parts one on the road which is a wireless module that sends a signal to the car with the speed limit of the road the car is entering, the second is a microcontroller that controls the pulses sent from the battery to the fuel injector which leads to the limitation of the speed through the control of the amount of combustible mixture that passes to the engine pistons. The system controls the frequency of the pulses that open and close the solenoid injector assuming that the amount of fuel that would pass due to every pulse would be the same. The controlling signal will be send via an infrared module which will send a signal with a specific frequency. Another option in this system is the overdrive which will stop the torque limitation for a period of 15 seconds as to enable the driver to escape sudden dangers. The system was tested using one fuel injector controlled by a microcontroller operated relay; meanwhile the transmitter part was simulated by a remote controller. This will help reduce roughly 30% of the car accidents’ problem as the direct cause of it is over speeding.

2 FOR 1 WHEELCHAIR: IMPROVING AUTONOMY THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF MULTI-FUNCTIONAL MOBILITY AIDS
Gary Stanley Kurek
Bonnyville Centralized High School, Bonnyville, Alberta, CANADA

Currently, assistive mobility aids offer only 1 function to the physically disabled citizens that use them. Although beneficial, aids such as walkers and wheelchairs can have negative effects on a disabled user with changing daily conditions. This can place tight limits on one’s ability to be independent and autonomous. Today, if users wish to have more of their mobility needs met, they must purchase more than 1 mobility aid, and use them at different times. Said solution is impractical for physically disabled citizens seeking independence, as one isn’t always at home to switch from one aid to another. Through creating mobility aids that offer 2 or more popular functions, physically disabled citizens would be provided with increased independence, and would require less assistance from an attendant. 3 novel mobility aids were developed in this project aimed at assisting 2 large and most affected disabled groups: paraplegics, and citizens experiencing progressive debilitation. These 3 innovations include a device combining the functions of a rolling walker and electric wheelchair, a lightweight manual/electric wheelchair that reclines and ascends/descends curbs, and a manual/electric wheelchair that can ascend/descend curbs and staircases, and bring a user to standing position. These innovations were carefully designed and developed, and were tested in accordance to RESNA/ANSI wheelchair testing standards in a variety of areas including performance and safety. Test dummies were used instead of human subjects to reduce risk. Following the testing sessions, the 3 mobility aids developed in this project were proven effective under their conditions of use.

ROBUST DISPLACEMENT ESTIMATION EMPLOYING INEXPENSIVE WEBCAM BASED OPTICAL FLOW
Christopher Stephan Nielsen
Homeschool, Calgary, Alberta, CANADA

Traditionally developed trajectory estimation systems are limited due to inaccuracy, cost and inability for real-time feedback. In this project, a real-time handheld based trajectory estimation system was developed using an inexpensive webcam. Through the analysis of feature points on a ground surface manifold, the differential motion of the webcam between frames was estimated through an adapted quasi-linear least squares algorithm using a linear model for the transformation of the feature points in the image plane. An accelerometer and ultrasonic rangefinder were embedded in the design to assist in compensating for height and tilt variance of the webcam. An algorithmic construct was developed in C to interface with the MatLab engine through the API for real-time trajectory visualization. Using radial and linear testing, the system was shown to provide robust feedback to within 0.15% error. Due to the economical, accurate and real-time nature of the developed system, a multitude of applications are possible including independent indoor navigation for the blind and enhanced guidance systems for mobile robotics.

MAXIMIZATION OF DAYLIGHT WITH THERMAL MASS MODIFICATION IN AN EASTERN, MID-ATLANTIC HIGH SCHOOL
William T. Chauvin
Valley Central High School, Montgomery, NY

As numerous findings show that potential exists in lighting buildings through the use of the sun, increasing questions arise to understand how. The following study entails measuring the light levels in reduced scale, model high school classrooms. Two model groups, one control and one variable, were constructed. Each group consisted of four classrooms, each having one windowed wall oriented toward a different direction. The variable model group contained a source of thermal mass in each classroom. Over the course of six months, measurements were taken, at one week intervals, at three different times during the day. Results highlight areas in which daylight is most available depending on window orientation of the room and time of day. A second part of the study involved testing the effectiveness of the designed thermal mass. This involved creating two model rooms with ports for inserting a temperature sensor. The variable contained the thermal mass apparatus while the control did not. Initial collected data showed sufficient levels of daylight availability and indicated the effects of window orientation, and time of year and day on lighting levels. Separate data indicated the positive effectiveness of the designed thermal mass. The research offers a way to maximize natural daylight in a classroom while regulating the inherent temperature change through thermal mass. Daylight providing adequate illumination and effective thermal mass can then be relied on to reduce electrical stress. The research aims to identify a significant source for energy savings that can be projected in a full scale school.

THE ELECTRONIC COMMUNITY GUARD
Olajumoke Tolulope Adebayo
Doregos Private Academy, Lagos, Lagos, NIGERIA

The rapid growth in population in many parts of the world especially in Sub-Saharan Africa has resulted in the development of many residential estates to cater for the ever increasing housing needs. One major challenge in such neighborhoods is the safety of lives and property, which oftentimes is both labor and capital intensive. The Electronic Community Guard (ECG) was designed to address these problems; providing community surveillance in a cheap and labor effective manner. Fitted with smoke and high heat sensors for fire, together with passive infra-red as anti-burglary sensor, signals generated are synchronized with the phase lock loop and super-imposed on the mains by the isolating transformer. An LM555 timer generates a 60KHz frequency which is interpreted by the decoder LM567, causing the transistor to switch on the light emitting diode and the low audible buzz alarm in the modules which are located in all houses within the estate indicating the particular house in danger, however, the alarm is not activated from the origin house, therefore the intruder is not alerted. The impulse generated also triggers the Appliance Control Device (ACD) which sends telephone signals to pre-determined numbers; mostly the home owner and the appropriate central security agencies such as the police and the fire service. The device does not generate any toxic products and need no extra connections between the homes, as it work along with the mains, thereby making it cheap, durable and sustainable.

ROBOTICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
Michael Anthony Booker
Greenville Weston High School, Greenville, MS

The overall purpose of my project is to test the capabilities of robots to have human senses. I started this research in August 2008, and I currently working on it. Computer engineering has two areas: computer science and electrical engineering. For computer science, I wrote some basic programs using C+++, and I made a video game using Game Maker 7. I built some robots that came in kits for electrical engineering. It is a two step process when building a robot: electrical assembly and mechanical assembly. Electrical assembly includes soldering the electrical components to the circuit board, and mechanical assembly includes building and mounting the body and wheels for the robot. I formulated a hypothesis which was to test is it possible to give a robot human senses. With the right sensory electrical components, it is possible to give robots human senses.

DESALINATION OF SEA WATER: A COMPARISON OF PROCESSES
Isaaca G. Hoglen
Kauai High School, Lihue, HI

In this project, three different desalination processes were tested, and their time efficiency, energy efficiency, and the salt concentration of the resulting water were evaluated with conductivity and resistivity measurements. The three processes are: electrolysis; using organic solvents to precipitate salts; and solar powered evaporation. When experimenting with the electrolysis, different types of batteries and different probes were used. The ydrogen was isolated and collected; however, not enough water was produced to test. If the hydrogen were burned at a steady rate, this process would be the most efficient process in terms of time and water purity. Its energy use, however, is not efficient. The organic solvents used to precipitate salts were ethanol, acetone, and 91% isopropyl alcohol. Salt water solutions were made with 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, and 60% of each solvent. The solutions were filtered, and then tested to measure how much salt was removed. Ethanol and acetone precipitated the most salt, resulting in about 20% fresh water recovery. This process was energy efficient, but the water<br><br>was the least pure. However, this process can be used to precipitate salt out of large quantities of water quickly. Two different approaches were experimented with for evaporation. The first used<br><br>a funnel and tubing to direct evaporated water into a collection container. When that didn't work, the pot was placed on a slope with a plastic lid to allow the condensed water to drip into a collection container. Evaporation produced clean water, but it was not time efficient and produced a small amount (about 10mL per day) of water. This process was the least time efficient, but was energy efficient and produced clean water.

THE APPLICATION OF HOT-WIRE ANEMOMETRY TO THE MAPPING OF BOUNDARY LAYER FLOWS
Mark Thomas Parrish
Chamberlain High School, Tampa, FL

The purpose of this project was to design and construct a constant temperature hot-wire anemometer capable of accurately recording data in a viscous boundary layer flow. This instrument's capabilities were assessed by comparing the velocity profile of a laminar flat-plate boundary layer in relation to the theoretically acquired Blasius velocity profile. The experimental phase of this project included the construction of a hot-wire anemometer that included a bridge circuit designed to within 5% tolerance. Current Mesh Analysis was used to determine the voltage to resistance ratios of the probe.<br><br>The Arduino developmental environment and C-programming were used to digitize the output voltages from the bridge circuit. Coding of the microcontroller and a serial input program transferred the acquired voltage to a computer and allowed for determination of the wind speed through the Zukauskuas method. An open circuit wind-tunnel was constructed with a laminar flat plate installed for the formation of boundary layers. A proportional integral derivative(PID) controller was used to maintain a constant temperature of the wire. During wind-tunnel testing acquired boundary layer data was compared to a mathematically generated Blasius boundary layer profile.<br><br>Results of this study indicate that it is possible to construct a constant temperature hot-wire anemometer capable of acquiring boundary layer data to within reasonable values as compared to the Blasius method. An additional analysis showed it is possible to increase accuracy and spatial resolution by solving a Fourier transform through finite difference method in order to determine the heat consumed by sections of the probe.

THE VEX ROBOTICS CHALLENGE FOR ENGINEERING AND MECHANICAL DESIGN FOR APPLIED ROBOTICS TECHNOLOGY
Eon Dwayne Duzant
W.E.B. DuBois High School, Baltimore, MD

This robotics engineering project focused on manipulating and moving objects while considering the quality assurance study of mechanical subsystems that were limited by standard VEX systems. The emphasis of this experiment placed the importance of center of gravity calculations involving the chassis, mechanical arm devices, motion systems and programming logic that would support the engineering design of four tested robots. The experimental procedures for this robotics engineering designs centered on the order of each prioritization of adding and designing subsystems to accomplish the goal of moving objects and climbing inclines using remote control devices and autonomous programs with robotic sensors. The robotics experimentation included four mechanical designs. Each design had a different motor subsystem for moving objects and a different chassis design. The experimentation focused on the following physics / engineering concepts: center of gravity; mechanical advantages; constant acceleration in linear motion; angular speeds vs. linear speeds; and power and torque. Of the four tested robots, robot C demonstrated the most mechanical efficiency of all designs due to its center of gravity advantages. Results from obstacle challenges (testing) demonstrated that engineering design processes of robots that emphasized the center of gravity of the base and the weight distribution of the mechanical arms outperformed other experiment robotic designs in linear speed, in the capacity to move objects, climbing inclines and responding to autonomous sensors. Future robotic engineering research will involve applications with advanced sensory and autonomous programming with multi-tasks performances.

SOLAR SAIL, YEAR TWO
Steven Munn Jeanes
Bradenton Prepatory Academy, Bradenton, FL

The main problem with solar sails is the sail deployment. My question is, Can I successfully deploy my solar sail with a more reliable and efficient co2 system and other efficient and reliable modifications? My engineering goal is:if I successfully construct, attach, and secure the co2 system and make several other modifications then the deployment should be a more reliable system. <br><br>I modified the solar sail design of last year. I took out the co2 system and built a more reliable one. Last years deployment was mechanicaly based, whereas this years is a electronic based deployment.<br><br> I took apart a co2 hand gun and used the co2 system. I beveled the edges so the mylar can have a closer fit to the body. Then I advanced the attachment of the mylar by tying it down to the booms instead of the cotter pins for a more fluid deployment system. Then I upgraded the elastic to a stronger and thicker grade. The solar sail is folded, compacted and placed inside the body capsule. After that the propulsion stage is placed in the body capsule. When ignited it will push the solar sail out of the body capsule. Instead of a mechanicaly based it is electronicly based. When the solar sail deploys it opens from the elastic attached to the booms from the body. <br><br>The most importing part of this project is the precise measurements of the construction. The other most important thing is the fluidness of the co2 deployment, and its ability to be remotely detonated. The first test that I did was to see how much air I need for the co2 deployment system. Then I did the final test and that was to deploy it 5 times successfully and it was successful.<br><br>With a solar sail we can explore outer space with the photons of the sun with out any fuel. From a solar sail reaching speeds like taking a plane ride from Lost Angeles to Boston in a minute taking light-years off other space probes. This could be the new way we and explore space planets nebulas the sun retrieving data that we have been estimating at for years.

COOKERSMART
James Sinclair Popper
Marlborough College, Marlborough, Wiltshire, UNITED KINGDOM

In response to an elderly family friend’s devastating kitchen fire, I initiated my engineering project to devise an effective fire detection system specifically for the kitchen. This would largely, but not exclusively, target the elderly and other vulnerable members of our communities. They overwhelmingly represent the demographic group most at risk from this recurrent danger. <br><br> <br><br>Even though more fires start in the kitchen than anywhere else in the home, there are currently no effective detectors that can be situated there. Existing devices, such as smoke alarms, cannot function successfully in this environment, due to the prevalence of false alarms. The new system that I have designed, ‘CookerSmart’, overcomes this fundamental problem by utilising an innovative and unique detection method. Instead of sensing for the presence of smoke, it detects fires in their infancy, identifying the infra-red flicker of their flame, analyzing and responding to specific frequency bands of flame flicker.<br><br> <br><br>In essence, ‘CookerSmart’ offers a number of life-saving advantages. It dramatically reduces response time, gives considerably fewer false alarms and can of course, be situated directly in the kitchen. Through extensive consultation, design modification and rigorous testing, I have created a product that effectively fulfils its original aims and is highly regarded by multiple organizations within the fire safety sector. Its implementation is potentially universal and not limited solely to kitchen use; it can be modified and expanded to include other sectors such as marine, garage and leisure safety.

Number of deaths and causalities are still high in buildings fires, Although these buildings have emergency exits and facilities to maintain the safety of its occupants. Individuals that do not survive, usually die because they were trapped and were not able to escape. The Emergency Evacuation System would help save more human lives independently in case of victims trapped in a building. The device is located above the room windows with a visible metal hook; the victim should put on a life jacket (specially designed) and hock him/her self then jump out of the window. The Emergency Evacuation System will take the victim gradually and safely to the ground then roll back to the same location as soon as the victim (weight) released him/her-self from the hock ,to save other trapped victims.

BRING TO LIGHT: THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL PFO INVERSE ORGANIC LIGHT EMITTING DIODE
Elisa Bisi Lin, Ian Chan, 
Plano West Senior High School, Plano, TX

OLEDs have the potential to become the leading wide area display technology of the future. These organic devices have better resolution, larger color range, and wider viewing angles than their LCD counterparts. Furthermore, the lightweight and flexible qualities of OLEDs make them the optimal choice for commercial applications. In this experiment, a novel inverse device was developed by utilizing highly conductive multiwalled carbon nanotube sheets as the anode, the advantages of heat treatment on the emissive layer, and the properties of the polymer itself. The revolutionary structure is the first inverse polymeric device to successfully emit stable and uniform light, which peaked at 90 cd/m2. This top-emitting architecture eliminates circuitry complications and safeguards the easily oxidized cathode. Additionally, these devices are economically feasible as they are inexpensive to manufacture and can be mass produced through ink-jet printing of organic layers. Finally, since the multifunctional top MWNT layer of the inverse structure can conveniently serve as the interconnecting layer in the tandem device, this breakthrough polymer structure is a fundamental step in achieving the ultimate goal of fabricating the coveted white tandem structure.

BEAT THE HEAT: A REVERSIBLE ONE WAY HEAT PANEL
Ryan C. Erickson, Holly C Erickson, 
Los Alamos High School, Los Alamos, NM

Since the invention of the heat pipe by National Labratory engineers during the 1960's, the concept of vapor driven thermal conductivity has been exploited in many incarnations. The purpose of this project is to see whether the concept of the linear heat pipe can be adapted into a flat transverse panel, and to see if it can be caused to function as both an efficient conductor and insulator. To acheive this, panels fabricated out of metal, mesh, and a liquid working fluid were fabricated and placed under vacuum. During operation, capillary action draws liquid up the wick where it boils; the vapor crosses to the other metal plate, releases its heat, and condenses back into a liquid, allowing the cycle to continue. When tested with thermocouples and heat lamps against a copper block, it was revealed that the heat panel was an extremely effective conductor, operating at the same level as copper. In reverse, the panel exhibited insulation ten times that of copper. The heat panels' encouraging results prove that future panels could easily perform the roles of both conductors and insulators in a variety of applications including household climate control and space-related research. Some changes include giving the wick the ability to move between the panel's walls allowing the thermal properties to be reversed without physically rotating the panel. This passive, controllable, adaptable thermal diode has tremendous potential to impact clean energy research, as it provides a method of controlling the output of any energy system, ensuring maximum efficiency.

Our project proposed a novel in-pipe device – Pipe-Rat, which can move freely in a three-dimensional pipe construction, including horizontal, inclined and vertical pipe with L-shaped and T-shaped elbows.<br><br>The Pipe-Rat consists of three basic components: front propeller, rear supporting frame, and control system. The innovation of structure enables it to pass the elbows with small radius, which is difficult to the previous designs. The device has two front driving wheels can turn in the same or different directions at the same time. This two-point contact with pipes in cross-section can guide the pipe-rat to pass elbows easily. The propeller plus the rear supporting four wheels enable the Pipe-Rat to move smoothly and steadily in the pipes. The remote control system is adapted and modified from those used in airplane toy. Furthermore, the two wheels can also rotate through specially designed spiral movement to locate their position or avoid obstacles. <br><br>Extensive experiments have been designed to test the Pipe-Rat in pipes with a diameter of 250 mm in many different layouts. The Pipe-Rat can move flexibly in any controlled direction, even in the presence of obstacles, such as soldering lines with thickness up to 5 mm, cracks with width up to 4 mm.<br><br>The Pipe-Rat can easily climb vertical pipes; turn around the T-shaped and L-shaped joints in small radius and different directions; and step over small cracks or large damage areas. We believe that it will improve the efficiency of inspection work once implemented in real pipe system.

Taiping MARA Junior Science College, Taiping, Perak, MALAYSIA

Based on the conventional ceiling fan, the Self Generating Electricity Fan (SGE-FAN) is designed and developed to improve the operation of a fan in terms of reducing the amount of electricity consumed. The initial idea was to increase its simplicity, cost effectiveness, long term economic value and environmental friendliness. The process of design the SGE-Fan began with detail daily observation of the operation of the ceiling fan. By using the principle of induced electromagnetism, a model was designed. The effectiveness of each operation and the amount of domestic electricity consumed by the prototype is tested and compared to that of conventional ceiling fan. The result shows that after using the domestic electricity for only 3 minutes, the SGE-Fan is able to operate continuously on its own without further drawing on more supply of electricity. This is done by its ability to generate electricity from dynamos attached. This is in total contrast to the conventional fan which required a continuous supply of electricity for continuous operation. Since the domestic electricity supply must be paid for with each unit of current used, this makes the SGE-Fan economical in the long run. Moreover, with its simple design, and its ability to generate its own electric which contribute to its cost effective and environmental friendliness. The SGE-Fan can be applied in other fields of machinery. This positive feature makes it the true efficient energy management of kinetic machine in the future.

AUTONOMOUS ROBOTIC RUBIK'S CUBE SOLVER
David Alexandre Joseph Campeau, Spencer August Berglund, 
Mayo High School, Rochester, MN

Our goal was to construct a robust and relatively simple robot that could solve a 3x3x3 Rubik’s Cube in less than one minute.<br><br>The robot was constructed using a Lego® Mindstorms® NXT® set. Programming of the robot’s basic functions was performed using LabVIEW® and the NXT Toolkit. Higher level programming was done primarily using Matlab®. A Matlab graphical user interface (GUI), featuring a virtual cube mirroring the cube being solved, was programmed to launch and monitor the solution. The cube’s faces were systematically scanned using a robot mounted USB webcam. We developed an image processing algorithm that analyzed the webcam images and sent the initial cube orientation to a two-phased solving algorithm programmed in C. The solver was optimized to rapidly find a short (<30 moves), but not necessarily an optimal solution (<21 moves), which could require substantially more computing time. A Matlab routine then interfaced the solution to the LabVIEW routines on the NXT brick via a USB connection, and initiated execution of the robotic moves, controlled by the NXT brick.<br><br>The final cube solving process from initial scanning to final completion required less than one minute. This project necessitated several hundred hours of work; it took approximately six months to construct and program a functional robot. More than eight prototypes of the robot and ten prototypes of the GUI/solver were developed to reach our goal. Challenges overcome included inaccuracy of Lego servo motors, flimsy plastic Lego pieces, image processing under changing lighting conditions, and interfacing between system components.

NEW PRINCIPLE: VERTICAL FILAMENT WINDING MACHINE FOR COMPOSITE TUBES
Martin Ron, Jan Patak, Jan Mares
Gymnazium Susice, Susice, CZECH REPUBLIC

Composite tubes have a very wide range of application in industrial<br><br>machinery, vehicles, aeronautics and sport. They are mostly<br><br>manufactured on the horizontal winding machines. The mandrel is placed<br><br>horizontally, therefore long mandrels tend to flex and zero degree<br><br>fibers fibres sag due to gravity force. These factors limits the tube<br><br>dimensions and the speed of the winding process. In this project, we have<br><br>designed the vertical winding machine and we showed, that vertical<br><br>technology is a promising way to improve filament winding.<br><br>First, we theoretically reviewed anticipated problems and created a 3D<br><br>computer model. We had to develop practical vertical construction and<br><br>new mandrel clamping, which makes possible easy and fast mandrel<br><br>manipulation. We intended to use mainly recycled components from older<br><br>machines, although, but we had to design many new components. Our work also<br><br>included as well engineering drawing, connecting stepping motors with<br><br>PC and writing control software in C language.<br><br>After completing the machine we tested the vertical winding by<br><br>producing the first "vertical" tubes. Tests result were more than<br><br>satisfying satisfactory. Through all production processes the mandrel<br><br>flexion flexure was<br><br>dramatically reduced, zero degree ffibers fibres were placed precisely and we<br><br>didn't notice any resin run-off.<br><br>We found that vertical winding can bring major progress into filament<br><br>winding technology. With vertical machines it will be possible to<br><br>manufacture longer tubes, reduce production time and also reduce the<br><br>space needed<br><br>for winding machines. Our machine and software forms a promising base<br><br>for future development.

LIGHT YOUR JACK
Juan Ramon Ibanez, Francisco I. Rivas Reyes, 
Colegio La Piedad, Carolina, San Juan, PUERTO RICO

Abstract<br><br>Light your Jack is a research project whose purpose was to design a mechanical jack with lights. The idea of designing this project was thinking about how important it is for us to be able to change a flat tire while we drive roads or highways. Puerto Rico has lighting problem in the majority of the roads and unfortunatly this has led to fatal accidents. This mechanical jack could help in some ways to solve this problem. The project hypothesis is that if you modify the stucture of a mechanical jack by installing lights on both sides, this installation could illuminate the working area and could be used in an emergency during the night, since these lights work on batteries. The procedure involved the mixing of two components (liquid steel/epoxy resin and hardener) in order to weld the lights to the jack. The added lights were painted and the Illuminate Jack was tested. The hypothesis was proved, when lights were added to a mechanical jack, a better and safer instrument to change a flat tire was created.

Colegio Nuestra Senora de la Piedad, Carolina, PUERTO RICO

This research pretends to save and protect lives. By means of the integration of air bags and a sensor that detects the impact to the motorcycle, this could prevent more deaths or injuries. This mechanism will activate the air bags and absorb the impact, causing less damage to the driver. If the experiment is successful this could save thousands of lives. The hypothesis stipulates that the air bags will protect the driver and prevent more deaths.<br><br>In the experiment eight batteries of 9 volts were charged to increase the electrical power that goes to the sensor that activates the two fans. The experiment will also use paint balls to implant them in different parts of the dummy’s body to simulate the injuries. The motorcycle without air bags had six serious injuries and four undamaged body parts. The motorcycle with common air bag had four serious injuries and six undamaged body parts. The motorcycle with the designed air bags had only two serious injuries and eight undamaged body parts. The motorcycle with designed side air bags had only one serious injury and 9 undamaged body parts. Results efficiency was compared.<br><br>Neither the motorcycles with the designed air bags and side airbags have any deaths, however the motorcycle with common airbag had bigger number of deaths. These results proved the hypothesis mentioned. The air bags designed during the experimentations are more secure and efficient in this experimental model.

Car accidents account for 53% of accident related deaths in the United States. Recent advances in robotics provide the means to dramatically improve driving safety. We developed an Automatic Automobile Collision Avoidance system that allows robotic vehicles to detect and avoid dangerous driving situations.<br><br>We focused on three types of common car collisions: head on, quick stop, and lane change. We created a computer program that successfully maneuvers model cars out of dangerous driving situations. Developing such a complex program involved several phases, including identifying an optimal method, designing workable algorithms, writing and testing code, debugging, and recoding. We tried many different ways of solving our problem, and iteratively developed a method that worked. We developed and wrote a program that successfully maneuvers our model cars out of dangerous driving situations. Ultrasonic sensors are used to determine how fast the object directly in front of a robotic car is going. If another car is coming towards our robotic car, our robot avoids the crash by swerving out of the way. If the other car were stopped, our robot would stop at a safe distance behind it.<br><br>Our Automatic Automobile Collision Avoidance System works for two of three most common types of car crashes. Robots have been used to enhance the safety of driving, and our work suggests that additional research into computerized collision avoidance systems can yield great gains in safety. Our hope is that computerized collision avoidance systems will one day be recognized widely enough to become fully integrated in automobiles.

AEOLUS TEMPERATURE REGULATION SYSTEM
Nicholas Crispie, Kevin Crispie, 
Mountain View High School, Mountain View, CA

We wanted to design, construct and test an inexpensive product to address the problem of excessive amounts of resources devoted to the climate control of homes. The product is a system of natural air circulation using windows and fans controlled by a microcontroller which reads inside and outside temperatures. We built a model of the system controlled with software running on a Basic Stamp microcontroller. It gets 2 digital thermometers readings, controls a servo representing a window opener, and turns on and off a fan representing a ceiling fan. After the program reads the temperatures from the digital thermometers, it executes algorithms based on inside, outside, and desired temperature. These algorithms then control whether the servo is in the open or closed position and whether the fan is on or off. When attached to a computer or another data display, the program prints the temperature values. We found that the system meets our criteria and can save about 40% of energy used in cooling and 15% of energy used in heating. The program executes promptly and accurately, moving the window to the open/closed position and turning on and off the fan when needed. Per zone, roughly 2 rooms depending on home configuration, the system will cost $200. Aeolus will cost around $1,000 for an average home, and saves nearly $300 per year, so Aeolus can be paid off quickly. Within 20 years, the home owner can save nearly $5,000.

SAVING WATER THROUGH WEATHER ANALYSIS: USING PRECIPITATION PROBABILITIES AND MOISTURE SENSING IN LAWN IRRIGATION
Cathy Hsi Chen, Alexander Joseph Mullen, 
Oxford High School, Oxford, MS

The use of relatively uncontrolled faucet and automatic sprinklers poses a variety of environmental and irrigational problems, such as overwatering, excess runoff, and rapid evaporation. At present, consumers tend to favor expensive underground systems or cheap, unregulated faucet systems that require manual operation. Both systems, however, fail to acknowledge the potential of future precipitation, thus wasting large amounts of water. An automatic water control device for use with faucet irrigation systems can be designed with the intention of conserving water through optimized water schedules, predictive weather analysis, and moisture sensing technology. A program with the ability to extract XML data from an online Weather API and process the information using a prediction-analysis algorithm was designed. Moisture retained in the lawn was determined based on sensor probes that terminated yes-signals with a circuit. Signals were transmitted between computer and sprinkler using two Arduino microcontroller units. The system predicted the weather patterns with 86.80 percent accuracy. The results and design support the hypothesis that a weather-cognizant and moisture sensing sprinkler system can be integrated to form a water-conserving irrigation model.

West High School, Salt Lake City, UT

Abstract<br><br>Regenerative Braking<br><br>by<br><br>Asparouhov and Chen<br><br><br>Introduction: Regenerative braking is an energy recovery mechanism that reduces vehicle speed by converting kinetic energy into potential energy instead of dissipating it as heat. The purpose of this engineering project was to understand and create a circuit that modeled a regenerative braking system, compare its efficiency to a circuit without regenerative braking, and develop methods that would increase efficiency of the regenerative braking system. <br><br>Methods: We created circuits representing dynamic and regenerative braking systems. We tested the systems to show the efficiency advantage of regenerative braking over dynamic braking. We then bypassed the battery bridge between the ultra-capacitor and system and again measured the efficiency of each circuit. Finally, we tested 24 driving schemas to determine the optimal simulated driving conditions.<br><br>Results: The point of maximum energy recapture from regenerative braking corresponds to motor acceleration time. There is a correlation between increased power and decreased time for capacitance charge. In addition, over time, the power stored in the capacitor increases, especially for smaller capacitance charge times. The calculated maximum efficiency of all of the driving schemas was almost 28% efficiency of energy-recapture.<br><br>Conclusions: This project met its engineering goals by showing that a regenerative braking system in which the battery bridge is bypassed is viable, which may be further applied to improve the efficiency of current hybrid vehicle braking systems.

Escuela Industrial Superior has a Computer Numerical Control milling machine in its workshop to train electromechanical technicians. <br><br>The lack of a fourth automated axis in this machine causes limitations in working with it. An engineering work which allows the automation of that fourth axis has been developed. <br><br>The premises to be satisfied with this automation have been: to increase the complexity of machining of parts, to apply quality standards, to reduce machining time, to get a friendly interface with the operator of the milling machine, applying acquired knowledge and a technological low cost solution. <br><br>A conjunct conformed by a software, an electronic circuit and an electromechanical mechanism has been developed. By means of the software developed, the operating parameters and the orders for the machining of the part are introduced. The software runs on a computer via Universal Serial Bus connection, the data is transferred into an electronic circuit commanded by a Programmable Interface Controller. The circuit controls a stepper motor, which is integral with a manual rotary table through a coupling. All development is integrated to the Computer Numerical Control milling machine and is connected with the three axes which are already available through encoders.<br><br>The accuracy achieved is 0.01 [degree] of movement of the rotary table, the cost referenced to a fourth automated milling trading axis is less than 10%, and machining tests have been successful. Furthermore, all software and circuit have been completely developed, designed and tested. <br><br>You get precision, quality and low cost, satisfying the needs.

REUSING ELECTRONIC BALLASTS TO SAVE ELECTRICAL ENERGY
Alberto Erminio Gil, Dominguez, German Norberto, 
"Ingeniero Santiago Barabino" Technical School #2, La Banda, Santiago Del Estero, ARGENTINA

In the present project, the reuse of electronic ballasts from energy-saving lamps used as auxiliary equipment in fluorescent lamps is proposed under the premise of saving electrical energy. <br><br> In order to do that, a procedure for the disassembling and testing of them is followed, with careful handling so as not to break the glass of the lamps since there is a mercury microdrop inside them, which is added in the process of manufacturing.<br><br>Reused electronic ballasts are installed under real conditions of functioning to analyze the useful life of them.<br><br> Comparative measurements of electrical and physical variables with 18 W and 36 W lamps are carried out, using firstly a traditional auxiliary circuit. Then, the measurements are repeated, but this time changing the auxiliary circuit by electronic ballasts taken out from energy saving lamps of different trademarks and power.<br><br> By installing printing circuit board from low energy light bulbs with an inferior power to that of the 18 W and 36 W tubes, the luminous intensity decreases in relation to traditional ones. To solve this problem, a printing circuit board with the same power is put in them, keeping the same level of lightning in this way. However, in the case of 36 W tubes, since boards with the same power as that of these fluorescent tubes are not found, the electronic circuit of the board is modified by reusing some components, managing not to decrease the luminous intensity and following the premise of saving electrical energy.

ANTI-BUMPING SAFETY DOOR
King Lam Kwan, Woo Wing Ki, Angel, Wong Yu Hei, Bithia
Heep Yunn School, Hong Kong SAR, HONG KONG

Most hinged doors that we commonly used are either “pull - push” type or “push – push” type (swing door). However there is always a hidden danger that when we push, someone on the other side of the door may be knocked and get injured. These accidents are very common in public places such as washroom doors where transparent glass panels cannot be installed for privacy reason. <br><br> With this problem in mind, we have invented a simple but revolutionary door design that is a “pull – pull” type which can ONLY be pulled from both sides but cannot be pushed from either side.<br><br> Our design utilizes the special feature of the common ball lock. In most existing ball locks, one side of the latch is flat while the other side is curved and rounded. In our design, halves of two ball locks are installed one vertically above another but in reverse direction. The protruding edges of the latches of the two locks are filed down slightly to allow the closing process of the door smoother. The hinges of the door need to be the 180 o swing door types.<br><br> The locks work when we pull the door in one direction, the rounded edge of the latch of the nearside lock will spring out to allow the door to be pulled open. However when we try to push the door, the flat face of the latch of the opposite lock will block and prevent the door to be pushed. This design in locks arrangement solves the problem of the door being pushed but can easily be opened on either side by pulling only.

The ozone is a gas produced by two ways. Naturally, through ultraviolet radiation in the troposphere. Artificially is generated by a silent electric shock. Ozone is formed by three oxygen atoms.<br><br>Sweet water is scarce day by day, plus the use of detergents, made with lineal alquiles sulfates which increases the phenomenon of duty water and makes difficult the process to purify it. This origined an idea and its development based on the scientific method. The main task was to demonstrate the ozone effectiveness above detergents in the clothes washing. It could be thanks to its floculant property. Ozone lets plunging down inorganic wale and floating out organic one. This is result of the stain’s rust and the chemical reaction of it with water.<br><br>For that reason o washing- machine was adapted to use ozone. This one produced by an artificial generator which pumps air from environment and makes it pass through a dryer where humidity is taken away, then air receives a silent electric shock which breaks the oxygen molecules, forming ozone into the reactor and guiding it to the washing- machine, this time through a previous added pie.<br><br>After the experiment, it proved that ozone is more effective than common detergents during the washing. And there are three main advantages: get better water quality after the washing process; it decreases the time of washing and, finally, it eliminates bad odor from the laundry.

Christopher Santy Gonzalez-Santiago, Stephanie De Jesus, 
Dra. Maria Cadilla de Martinez, Arecibo, PUERTO RICO

Technology is now vital in people’s lives. Unfortunately there is also a higher dependency on fossil fuels and non renewable energy. The hypothesis of this investigation is that it is possible to create a gadget which uses solar energy to charge electric devices and that can also work as a voltage generator. The gadget can charge electrical devices via USB and can also be used as a voltage generator using two electric cables. The gadget is a low cost device which is portable. It consists of solar panels which are 3.10V each, at their maximum capacity, a small tool box and USB ports. The gadget was built using low cost materials. The testing of the device as a solar charger proceeded using cell phones with 3.7V lithium-ion batteries. Its function as a voltage generator was tested using a 12V battery. The voltage of the batteries was measured every 20 minutes during one hour. According to the data obtained, the 12V battery gained an average of 0.14 volts within 20 minutes. It was also observed that the 3.7V battery obtained an average of 0.07 volts in 20 minutes. It was confirmed that this device works as a charger and as a voltage generator using renewable energy. This device helps people move one step closer to a world that is less dependent upon fossil fuels. It is also a cost efficient device which makes it accessible to more people.

AUTOMATED PAPER-RECYCLING MACHINE
Matthew Arbesfeld, Benjamin Edelstein, 
Lexington High School, Lexington, MA

The goal of this project was to design and build a compact and inexpensive device which would automatically convert a cellulose pulp suspension into usable sheets of paper. Paper was recycled by hand to determine the feasibility and practicality of the concept. Using experience from recycling paper, an initial prototype of the machine was drafted. Throughout the building process, the design was modified in response to the challenges that arose.<br><br> <br><br> The core of the machine is the paper-collection arm, which consists of a screen mounted on a pivoting beam. Initially, it was intended for a motor to be placed at the pivot point of the arm. However, it was quickly realized that the cost of such a motor would exceed the available funds. In the final prototype, an electric drill powers a winch which hoists the arm upwards while stretching a spring which eventually pulls the arm back into the mixture. At the apex of the arm’s extension, the paper is deposited onto a conveyor belt, which is also powered by an electric drill, where it dries and falls into a collection basket. <br><br> <br><br> This device shows that paper recycling can be moved from industrial factories to smaller scale venues. Thus, a business or institution could recycle their own paper in a manner that is financially advantageous because a usable product is created. A consumer-based recycling solution directly benefits the user by returning usable paper while also eliminating the need for expensive and inefficient shipping methods.

THE EFFECT OF HUMIDITY ON SOLAR CELLS
Rohan Paul, Deniz Karabakal, 
Huron High School, Ann Arbor, MI

All around the world, people are using solar cells more and more, but the average humidity varies drastically in different parts of the world. In this report, we tested how solar cells are affected by humidity. If we found that humidity affected solar cells drastically then countries could use solar cells in locations with optimal conditions. We used 2 solar cells that we soldered. We placed the solar cells, the light source, the voltmeter, the hygrometer and the humidifier in a small bathroom for an easier control of humidity. We ran the experiment as many times as we needed to collect a significant amount of data. In this case, we ran it 3 times. With the results, we located the optimal locations to place solar cells according to humidity. After conducting the experiment, we found that humidity had little effect on solar cells after 39 percent relative humidity. Using a 26 watt compact flourescent light bulb (which produces the same amount of light as an incandescent 100 watt), the solar cells produced more than 0.625 volts at 39 percent and below. After 39 percent relative humidity, the voltage dropped down to around 0.605 volts. Our results did not agree with our hypothesis. Although we predicted that higher relative humidity would increase voltage, we found that humidity levels below 39 percent were optimal for the production of solar energy. Using our results of this experiment we can conclude that locations with an average relative humidity below 39% would be the most efficient places for solar cells.

A NOVEL DESIGN OF CHAIR TO ASSIST IN CLIMBING STAIRS
Lakshmi Rajesh, Vibha Suresh, 
V V S Sardar Patel High School, Bangalore, Karnataka, INDIA

This project is to design a novel cost effective, self braked “Climbing Chair”, for the physically disabled and the aged to climb stairs, with an assistant.<br><br>The design consists of Mild steel clustered wheel structure of two overlapped bars (cross tie), at quadrate, with wheels at its four ends attached to either side of the front legs of a cross-legged chair , with an axle passing between their centers. The cluster rolls up or down on stairs with a solid rise, with rear legs folded.<br><br>The main principle is the pivoting of the four wheeled structure around their centers, being obstructed by the rise and the tread of the stair, during upward and downward climb respectively. As the chair is pulled upwards, the two sets of wheels latches on to the stair, act as a climber & the other set of wheels acts as a support base, making the upward movement smooth while rotating on its axis. The line of application of force is along the front legs of the chair, i.e., along the incline on which the load is placed and the centre of gravity of weight of the person on the chair is positioned in such a way that the moments acting on the pivots would assist in climbing.<br><br>In stationary position, the chair rests on four legs, but on movement, the rear legs are made foldable to avoid obstructions. Additional self breaking protection is provided, in case, the chair slips off. A head rest is provided for safety & comfort of the person.<br><br>The climbing principles can also be applied to a cart or trolley and help movement of goods such as grocery carts, handling of shipment during courier delivery/pickup. The CLIMBING CHAIR is cost effective and completely mechanical, built to suit the staircase climbing needs.

DESIGN OF A NOVEL, LOW-COST, EASY TO USE, AUTO-DISPOSABLE SYRINGE
Anarta Roy, Manosij Ghosh Dastidar, 
South Point High School, Kolkata, West Bengal, INDIA

Re-use of conventional disposable syringes has become a menace worldwide causing death of nearly 1.3 million people a year, especially in poorer countries. We have designed an auto-disposable syringe that cannot be re-used after the first use even if one <br><br>wants to do so. The design consists of two main parts - the barrel & the plunger. The barrel of the syringe is a uniform hollow cylinder having a cone-shaped head. At the base of the cone-shaped portion there is an inner lining that bulges out to form a ring-like rounded-surfaced projection that acts like a barrier for the plunger. Slightly above the ring-like projection and very close to the nose of the outlet, there are angular projections on the inner wall within the cone-shaped zone. The plunger of our syringe has a small hollow cylinder at the top containing two latching window slots in its wall. A rubber gasket is fitted around it to make it air-tight. A conical cap-like structure having two legs is inserted into the cylinder such that it passes beyond the latching window slots. When the plunger is pulled to draw medicine, the conical cap of the plunger gets obstructed with the ring shaped barrier of the <br><br>barrel thereby increasing the length of the plunger as the medicine gets into the syringe. During injection of medicine the plunger moves till the head of the barrel & the conical top of the elongated plunger gets locked at the angular projections provided at the top of the barrel. Now any effort to pull the plunger back for re-use will break the cap off the plunger and the barrel will get clogged with the broken cap inside it, thus making the syringe non-reusable. Compared to other expensive one-time use syringes, our design principle is simple, low-cost and extremely easy to use.

There are limited devices for teaching therapies for individuals with audiovisual sensory disabilities; they only accomplish specific functions, and do not adequately support the educational process. In light of this, the S.E.S.A.T. project intends to create a machine to stimulate the senses based on the needs of people in Costa Rica with audio-visual deficiencies. <br><br> This machine comes with a light table, images, photographs, and sounds for audiovisual stimulation. It also has three-dimensional accessories intended for tactile stimulation concepts in maternal and preschool areas.<br><br> The prototype is divided into three parts: The control system is the application software; the interface is a mutliplex circuit that allows the exchange of data between the computer and the prototype; and the device consists of solenoids, lights, relays and other electronic and mechanical elements that execute orders received through the interface.<br><br> <br><br> The result is an easy-to-operate, interactive, adaptable solution for the learning process. As such, it is a specialized device that should be operated by the instructor or under the instructor’s guidance to accomplish the proposed objectives. The device can also be used for early stimulation, or for people with sensory integration problems, regardless of the cause.

Our project was prompted by an observation. We encountered the problem of heat generation by computers. It’s significance is the following: because of the development of technology, we have to deal with more heat generation by computers. Our project offers a simple and efficient solution for the cooling of computers, especially the CPUss.<br><br>The essence of the project is a Stirling engine to reutilize the heat produced by the processor. We use a special engine – which was designed by us – that converts heat gradient into mechanical energy. We have chosen an Intel Core Duo E5200-E5400 processor (thermal design power: 65W) to demonstrate the idea.<br><br>In our Stirling engine, the design of the important parts flexibly. Most of them can be set to the correct values. We utilize the mechanical performance supplied by the engine in two ways. First, we cool the processor directly with the rotating movement of the Stirling engine. Second, we generate electric energy by a generator.<br><br>The engine doesn’t require external energy during it’s work. Due to the Stirling engine’s improvements, it can run at a minimum of 40 °C. This is an adequate value because the processor routinely works between 40 and 80 °C. Our equipment can keep the CPU temperature below 76 °C when the CPU load is 100%.<br><br>Our solution is competitive because it is not much more expensive than an average cooling fan. We made the whole construction out of 100 Euros, and we also estimated its cost when mass produced (1.0-1.5 Euros). The innovative character of the construct makes it also attractive.

Purpose of the Project<br><br>The research for the driver assistance system was meant to solve the problem of traffic collision, which leads to a great number of victims on a daily basis. <br><br>With this problem in mind and taking into consideration the fact that assistance equipment currently on the market is too expensive, therefore unavailable for most drivers, we have proposed to conduct a research to develop a viable and affordable solution.<br><br>Methods<br><br>The first step was collecting data about the existent systems and their flaws, in order to bring further improvements to our low-cost version. Secondly,we tested various types of sensors in order to decide which would fit best. After having built a first version, we attached it to an ATV so as to test the incorporated sensors’ response to various obsatcles.A few experiments were necessary to improve the system, and when the final draft was completed, it was tested several times on a car and further modifications were made.<br><br>Observations<br><br>Initially, after noticing that the tests' results were inconstant, we found problems with the functioning of the system. So, we made changes to the electronic components of the system so that they would not interfere with anything else. This together with new software implementations led to the final version of the system.<br><br>Conclusions<br><br>By combining sensors with electronic/mechanical technology and software we have managed to design a reliable solution against traffic collision. The system can be applied to any kind of car and provides an alternative to the pricey systems available only for luxury cars. Its value on the market is given by the fact that driving accidents are a frequent and great problem of today’s world, accident prevention systems being a widely necessary accessory to all drivers.

THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A RUGOSITY SUBSTRATE PROFILE GAUGE AND COMPARISON WITH THE IN SITU CHAIN METHOD
Kate Noel Donahue, Lauren Michelle Farwell, 
Bellarmine Preparatory School, Tacoma, WA

Rugosity is the measurement of marine benthic complexity. Itis presumed to be an indicator of the amount of habitat available for colonization by benthic organisms and shelter for mobile organisms. Rugosity is commonly measured by use of the in-situ chain method. The goal of this project was to develop a new method to evaluate rugosity. This method was developed through the design and construction of a rugosity subtrate profile gauge. A comparison of the two measurement techniques was conducted to determine which is the most effective. The research was conducted by testing different marine benthic structures, using both the in-situ chain method as well as the rugosity substrate profile gauge. Rugosity measurements were recorded and then analyzed. The results determined that the substrate profile gauge surpasses the in-situ chain method in effectiveness of evaluating and depicting benthic complexity. This can prove beneficial to future studies of marine habitats by creating a better picture of the sea floor.

FRICTION INCREASING FOREARM SLEEVE
Mark Alexander Morgan, David Richard Stephens, 
Dutch Fork High School, Irmo, SC

The purpose of this experiment is to develop a forearm sleeve for football players which increases the amount of friction between the player and the ball and thus decreases the likelihood of the player fumbling the ball; we hypothesize that the sleeve will increase the coefficient of friction by at least 30%. The quantitative test involves using a GLX device with a force sensor attachment to measure the force required to drag a football across a dry forearm (control), a sweaty forearm, and a forearm with the prototype. From this test we conclude that sweaty forearms create more friction than dry arms and the friction increasing forearm sleeve created a statistically significantly increased coefficient of friction, 249% greater than that of the wet arm. The qualitative test involves the use of two 2x4 pieces of wood, two clamps, a football jersey, a college regulation sized football, and plate weights of varying weights. The control test clamps parallel wood pieces, the football is suspended between the wood pieces, one being bare and the other with a football jersey draped over it. The next condition has the sleeve on the wood piece. Weights are placed on top of the football until the ball falls through the gap. The condition involving the forearm sleeve took an average of more than double the mass to make the ball fall through. We conclude that the friction increasing forearm sleeve provides a significantly greater amount of friction and will increase a player’s grip on a football.

Who would turn down cheaper water prices? We doubt most individuals would. In today's society most people are going green because of the high energy usage. In our region the weather has been changing drastically and water bills have increased. The most common way to heat water is a water heater, but we've constructed a cheaper way to do so. The purpose of this studey wat to prove that inexpensive Solar Thermal Water Heaters can be developed and heat water as effectively as a basic home water heater. A series of nine trial were conducted in three different types of weather: fall, winter, and spring. The temperature of tap water served as the control in this study. The water was heated through a simple homemade solar thermal water heater( aluminum, foil, and basic wood paneling). The Solar Thermal Water Heater heated the tap water in all of the different climates. This simple system cost only five dollar to construct. We concluded that the Solar Thermal Water Heater did produce warm water by trapping all the infared radiation from the sun inside our panel where our collector will absorb it.

WIRELESS UNLIMITED
Juan Natividad Cano, Alan Efrain Garcia, 
Americas High School, El Paso, TX

The goal was discovered that the way the angles affect the efficiency of the solar panels is related to the Riemann Zeta Function and electronic gadgets were able recharged while the system gathering energy. This unique correlation between these two different items is that the way the efficiency increases is exactly the same way the Riemann Zeta Function increases when its argument equals one. The speed in which the gadgets acquire energy is faster rather than the conventional usage. The system only requires minor supervision to monitor its task although it does not require manual work due to the program. Simultaneously, the computer program would consider the mathematical function, so that it would be able to report the amount of work required for the motor to rotate in the exact position; at the same time, make this a complementary system that would nourish itself from the electricity gathered. Finally, incorporate the principle of electromagnetic induction to transmit the energy wireless. Using Faradays law and Maxwell’s equations, we applied all the theorems of electromagnetism to maximize the efficiency of the whole system. These equations were evaluated using data recorded through the usage of a voltmeter, to determine the strength of the electromagnetic force created, after the magnetic force is derived with respect to time it takes for the electrons to travel through the path of the plates.

THE BEETLE BOT: WHAT'S YOUR ANGLE?
Kelsi Lynn Berry
Leesville High School, Leesville, LA

Purpose: The original purpose of my project was to learn how to make a robot which included learning about electrical currents and very basic robotics. I became interested in this experiment when my robot kept getting stuck in corners and along walls. The purpose of this experiment is to find out which angle will work best for my robot’s antennas so that it will not get stuck in corners or on a wall.<br><br>Procedures:<br><br>1. Build the Beetle Bot- A simple robot that runs mainly off of 2 AA batteries, 2 1.5 volt motors, and also 2 SPDT switches. <br><br>2. Customize the Beetle Bot so that the Antennas are removable so that bending them into the desired angle is easier.<br><br>3. Conducting the experiment- I tested a total of 9 angles. I started testing from 90 degrees and then increased my angle by 10 degree increments until I reached 170 degrees. Each testing session lasted for 30 seconds<br><br><br><br>Conclusion: My hypothesis was that the 120° angle would work the best for my robot. My results would consider my hypothesis wrong.

DESIGN OF PORTABLE X-RAY AND COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY SCANNER
Tomas Svoboda
High School of Electrotechnical Studies, Brno, Bohemia, CZECH REPUBLIC

Nowadays portable X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scanners are becoming more and more important in medical and technical scopes. However the portability of most instruments presently available on the market is very limited. In this project, I designed and manufactured functional prototype of the portable device, which integrates full X-ray and CT functions. <br><br> The principal parts of the device are X-ray tube fluorescent foil and digital camera. The latter provides high-resolution video of the revolving object which is screened. The whole device is controlled by the microcontroller with accompanying user interfaces. The latter, among other things, serves PC connection where CT images are generated from the video by the original software. Based on background projection, it allows composition of hundreds of cuts through the screened object.<br><br> The developed device is completely shielded and fully safe. Various tests were provided to verify the functions. I realized CT scan of switch and other technical objects. The X-ray function was tested in defectoscopy to check electronic components as the open filament in the fuse-system or the finding broken pins in the microcontrollers.  <br><br> The benefit of this work is in combination of the complete X-ray and CT scanner functions in one portable instrument, which was designed with respect to low purchase and operating costs. The whole device, and especially the concept of a portable CT scanner, has the interdisciplinary perspective of its application e.g. in schools as a teaching aid, in defectoscopy, forensics or medicine where can take advantage of this work.

NOVEL ORAL DRUG INHALER DESIGN TO OPTIMIZE DRUG DEPOSITION IN THE LUNGS
Arnab Dey
Arkansas School for Mathematics, Sciences and the Arts, Hot Springs, AR

There are many situations where the implementation of oral drug delivery via an inhaler can be better than conventional drug delivery methods. Promising applications for oral drug delivery include the delivery of medication straight to the lungs to treat a respiratory condition and the delivery of dry vaccines that do not need refrigeration. However in order to reap the full benefits of oral drug delivery the drug deposition in the lungs has to be improved. To improve the drug deposition in the lungs, drug particles have to be inhibited from hitting the trachea wall and getting stuck there. In order to accomplish this, a novel design was created that utilized a split - counter swirling nozzle which consists of a circular outlet with a diameter of 6mm and a coaxial washer shaped outlet with a diameter of 20mm. The drugs are propelled from the circular outlet. In order to improve the drug deposition in the lungs the design creates a pressure and drag forces. The pressure gradient from the circular inlet propelling air at an axial of 7m/s and the washer shaped propelling air at an axial velocity 2m/s and the drag forces are created by the circular inlet propelling air at an angular of -200rad/s and the washer shaped propelling air at an angular of 300rad/s. Based on prototype testing on a pig’s trachea a % drug deposition of 91.4% was achieved which was a 19.4% increase in efficiency over contemporary inhaler. This prototype testing validated the design created.

SPECIFIC IMPULSE OF TRADITIONAL BLACK POWDER ROCKET ENGINES IN THE PYROTECHNICS INDUSTRY
Martin Bradley Anderson
Burnsville Senior High School, Burnsville, MN

Small black powder rocket engines of similar design have been documented in use in the pyrotechnics industry since before A.D. 1635. Their design and construction has not changed substantially since that time, with the exception that modern manufacturing methods are sometimes employed to hydraulically press composition into the engines rather than hand-and-mallet ram composition into the cases by skilled craftsmen.<br><br> Performance and quality control, in terms of consistency of performance between engines manufactured by one process versus the other have been hypothesized and debated, but never studied scientifically. Sophisticated static test apparatus to enable testing, similar to that used in NASA and the military, to enable an answer to this question, has not even been available prior to the design of this apparatus by the author.<br><br> This current project consists of 2 Phases: (1) Engineering and an improvement to the design of the previous project’s static test apparatus to make it more sophisticated and suitable for answering this question, and (2) Building 24 rocket engines to test, half of them each by carefully controlled hand-rammed and half by hydraulic manufacturing methods, testing them on the apparatus, and analyzing the data obtained to determine whether one method or the other produced better consistency or performance.<br><br> Phase (1) created the additional benefit of having a new tool available for future testing/documenting different rocket engine design performance characteristics for future rapid prototyping and development.<br><br> Phase (2) results showed that hydraulic manufacturing methods produce more consistent performance between rocket engines.

GENERATION OF ELECTRICITY WITH THE HELP OF VERTICAL AIR THROUGH A MODIFIED VERY ECONOMICAL WIND MILL
Fatima Sohail
Da Model High School, Karachi, Sindh, PAKISTAN

This research project is aimed to generate electricity at low cost through a wind turbine by vertical air movement. Pakistan and developing countries across the world are facing shortage of electricity hence needed electricity at low cost. The project was based upon the following scientific principle that hot air is lighter than cold air and always moves upwards. <br><br>Using that principle air collected in a transparent chamber was heated by sunlight that became hot, moved upwards and operated the turbine which generated power. <br><br>The project was based on mathematical calculation that is as follows.<br><br><br>Volume of hot chamber 4/3 x 22/7 x r 3<br><br>Velocities of air in cold and hot chamber A1V1 = A2V2<br><br>Volume of tunnel 22/7 x r 2 x h<br><br>Velocity of air in tunnel V2 = A1V1 / A2 where V1and V2 are the velocities of air in cold and hot chamber<br><br>Electric Power V x I<br><br>Wind Power 0.5 x Swept Area x Air Density x Velocity3<br><br>This generated electricity was amplified and then stored to use when required. This device has wide application and provides cheap electricity. While purifying the environment, the electricity can be utilized in areas like street lamps, traffic signals, homes and market places. Although it is not comparable with the electricity produced from other big sources like hydroelectricity but still it is worth producing.

BALL ROBOT - AN INSTABLE SYSTEM IN BALANCE
Jan Kaeberich
Campe-Gymnasium Holzminden, Holzminden, Niedersachsen, GERMANY

The aim of the project "ball robot" is to build a robot balancing on a ball (40 cm diameter) without falling off. It consists of:<br><br> - Omni-wheel drive<br><br> - 4-DOF inertial measurement unit<br><br> - Incremental sensor<br><br> - Control<br><br> - Remote control<br><br>With the help of the omni-wheel drive the robot is able to move immediately in each direction and meets the requirement of reacting as fast as possible. It is necessary to measure the velocity of the wheels, because DC motors are used. Therefore an incremental sensor is positioned on each wheel, identifying direction and velocity.<br><br>A 4-degree of freedom inertial measurement unit is the most important sensor, containing two accelerometers and gyroscopes and determining the angle of its position.<br><br>Both the angle and the velocity of the motors have to be regulated in order to make the robot balance. This is achieved by a cascade PID control. The outer loop controller controls the angle (100 Hz sampling rate), and the inner one controls the velocity of the motors ( 1kHz<br><br>sampling rate).<br><br>In addition, the control contains a servo control to respond to changes in the nominal velocity in a superior manner.<br><br>The robot has a wireless connection to a remote control. This provides the opportunity to change the control parameters to manually operate the motors and to retrieve data from the various sensors. Furthermore is possible to navigate the robot by remote control.

PRECISION LOCATION OF ACOUSTIC SOURCES
Alexander Nathan Finney
Covenant Christian Academy, Huntsville, AL

The goal of this engineering project was to design and build a low-cost system that can quickly analyze and compute the location of a potentially concealed shooter. Such a device would be useful for both soldiers and law enforcement personnel.<br><br>The project used the application of hyperbolas in order to determine the location of a gunshot. An apparatus of three microphones was assembled and a surrogate gunshot (a firecracker) detonated. The difference in time of the sound waves from the firecracker reaching each of the microphones was measured. That measurement was performed by first amplifying the weak electrical signal from the microphone. The signal was then translated from an analog signal to a digital signal using an analog to digital converter. The digital signal was processed on a computer to find the rise time of each microphone. From that information, the equations for the asymptotes of the two hyperbolas were calculated. The intersection of the asymptotes was determined as the approximate location of the origin of the sound. The entire process, from data collection to reporting of the range and bearing of the gunshot, was performed autonomously.<br><br>The detector was able to determine the bearing to the sound within 5º. The calculated range was consistently low and averaged about 30% below the actual range. This performance yielded an operationally useful device, and further improvements are still possible.

GATE CRASHER 3: DESIGNING AN AUTOMATIC COW GATE TO SAVE THE FARMER TIME WHILE SAVING IDLING FUEL CONSUMPTION AND CO2 EMISSIONS
William Hurdle Welch
Alpena High School, Alpena, AR

Year one of this project resulted in the design of an automated cattle gate. In year two a model was designed, which resulted in a full scale prototype this year. The complete automated gate was installed at a local farm and data was collected and tabulated on opening and closing times of the gate and then compared to the original non-automated gate. Also collected was data concerning the amount of CO2 emissions from a farm tractor at idle with both the mechanical and automated gates. The average time (five repetitions) to enter and exit the mechanical cattle gate was 60.70 seconds, while the automated gate was 0.0 seconds. Total CO2 emissions was 1877 ppm for the mechanical gate and 0.0 emissions, while fuel usage for the idling tractor was 53.72 ml for the tractor getting through the mechanical gate versus 0.0 fuel use for the automated gate. The automated cattle gate saves time, fuel, and cuts down on CO2 emissions into the atmosphere.

PASSENGERS RELIEF CAR ALARM
Yailene Marie Bueno
Colegio La Piedad, Isla Verde, Carolina, San Juan, PUERTO RICO

This experiment was done as an alternative, in case a passenger is left behind in the back seat of a vehicle. It can be helpful to save lives of children, elders, and handicaps with this innovative system, and relief of any unwanted tragedy. The purpose of this investigation is to create a solution to the many deaths caused by hyperthermia inside vehicles, mostly in high temperatures. A total of 494 cases were reported from 1998-2010. It was proposed that by creating an automobile weight sensor alarm with an integrated timer, windows will open automatically. If a weight sensor alarm goes off, after the car is turned off, and the pin door sensor is activated before the driver walk away, it will alert the driver that someone is still inside. Also after exiting the vehicle the windows will automatically come down, avoiding the passengers to suffocate. Specific mechanical devices were used to install the Passengers Relief Car Alarms prototype for example: a model seat with weight sensor, pin door sensor, a power window, external battery, 2 buzzers sirens, two timers, starter immobilizer relay, engine switch, color lights, seat belts magnet sensor, a child simulator all connected through cables, and other devices. In conclusion; three different alarms that work were installed: window opener, two buzzers sirens, and car seats lights. The install on all the parts together were tested, and functioned properly. These installments can be helpful for drivers, including hearing impaired, to notice that the passengers are still inside the car.

ROTATIONAL IMPACT FORCES AND HOCKEY HELMET DESIGN
Ashton Rhys Wackym
University School of Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI

Background: High linear acceleration values produce traumatic brain injury (TBI); however, lower rotational acceleration values will also cause TBI.<br><br>Hypothesis: The Cascade M11 hockey helmet with advanced technology will outperform the Bauer NBH4500 helmet in both dry and wet conditions.<br><br>Methods: The helmets were tested on a drop testing system with a hybrid-III head and neck crash dummy and dropped onto an oblique plate with an angle of depression of 25 degrees. A mainstream helmet (Bauer NBH4500), and a cutting-edge, recently released helmet (Cascade M11) were used. Thirty-six trials, three trials for each condition: wet and dry, without a cage, with a half-face visor, and with a full-face cage. Rotational acceleration values were collected using two accelerometers attached to the head-form and a custom Labview 8-based data collection program. Captured data were analyzed using defined mathematical formulae. After finding the peak rotational acceleration values of each trial, statistical analyses were completed using Student's t-test.<br><br>Results: Under dry conditions, there were no significant differences between the two helmets in peak rotational acceleration values. However, the Bauer NBH4500 helmet had significantly lower differences in peak rotational acceleration versus the Cascade M11 helmet under the wet conditions with no cage (p=0.0053), half shield (p=0.039), or full cage (p=0.0049). There were no significant differences between the helmets with no cage or a cage for wet and dry conditions.<br><br>Conclusions: Helmet certification standards should include linear and rotational acceleration forces, which will likely drive the design of helmets that will reduce the risk of TBI.

With this project I tried to identify a good technical and technological solution to the problem of the Cpu heat dissipation, into the pc,in order to improve the performance and the size of processors.For this reason,I thought to replace the common finned sinks made of aluminum, with open pore metal foams heat sinks. Procedure:<br><br>1. By a thermometer probe, analysis of the processor's temperature:<br><br>a)at rest;<br><br>b)in operation;<br><br>combined with the traditional sink composed by a finned pack.<br><br>2. Study and implementation of a prototype heat sink made of open pore metal foams;<br><br>3. replacing the traditional heat sink with the prototype one;<br><br>4. By a thermometer probe, analysis of the processor's temperature:<br><br>a)at rest;<br><br>b)in operation;<br><br>combined with the prototype.<br><br>The processor temperature at rest was 21.9°C.During the functioning of th pc, the temperature stabilized to a constant parameter of 57.3°C. The same measurement, taken using the metal foams heat sink, provided a value of 47.1°C ( - 18%).Furthermore, time,taken by the new heat sink to cool the processor, results excellent. With the traditional heat sink, cpu needed 25 minutes to reach the temperature at rest. Using the metal foams one, it takes only 9 minutes. (-64%). The new heat sink will increase the performance of new processors thanks to an improved heat dissipation (higher clock time) and will reduce the size of the devices in which the processors will be installed.

A remotely operated vehicle supported and driven by wheels or tracks will be halted by specific obstacles such as rifts, stairs and cliffs. Its legged counterpart would be truly all-terrain, but there are none in production, so I will test and build one. The specifications of the robots' equipment must be very similar to allow for comparison.<br><br>Weight was the initial problem, so I investigated ways of emulating heavy components, like ball and socket joints, to make them lighter. I also remade the electronics twice to ensure the lightest possible configuration. After the making was complete, the initial programming created “stock” movements, like walking and rotating. These highlighted the difficulties of legged vehicles: The control systems. I created a diagramming technique in order to aid me in this.<br><br>In conclusion, I have created a truly all-terrain vehicle which matches the specification of its pre-existing rivals. It is stable, highly manoeuvrable and incredibly dynamic – being able to be fully articulated and adapted to any task. I have also answered the question of why this is the first of its kind: Moving the legs in a sequence which moves the robot in a desired way is a highly complex task, requiring careful planning and programming. I feel that this is the main area for development – switching the pre-programmed routines for sophisticated algorithms. Then, perhaps, it will be ready for its target environments of space, minefields, areas of military surveillance and disaster zones.

Instructional Educational Institution "School Lyceum # 3", Simferopol,, Crimea, UKRAINE

The goal of the project is to develop the new hybrid musical instrument (electric guitar + violin + guitar), the distinctive feature of which is transmission of sounding without distortions which are inherent to a number of electro-musical instruments, e.g. synthesizers. <br><br>As a result of testing, the sounding identity of classical violin, guitar and electric guitar within the framework of the created hybrid musical instrument was obtained.<br><br>The goal was reached due to the use of the continuous sounding of electric guitar strings tuned in a special way. Tuning of string sounding is carried out with the help of built-in sustainers controlled by six buttons separately for every string. Such an approach to tuning enables to excite strings both separately and together. The new instrument gives a possibility to play by chords to six notes as well as to pass to flageolets. <br><br>The main points of my work are:<br><br>The continuous sounding of every string is achieved with the help of a circuit with a positive feedback via influencing every string with electromagnetic field of exciting coil.<br><br>Emulation of bow sound is created with the help of a special impulse forming circuit where impulse is similar to the natural physical process which is done with a bow.<br><br>Speaking about the construction of fingerboard instrument, it can be divided into the top part with 12 tunes that gives a possibility to play it as a guitar and bottom part without tunes, with which it is possible to play as a violin.<br><br>Further research and experiments will allow to enhance new instrument, i.e. the polyphonic six-channel section of guitar is easily connected to the interface of MIDI, thus converting developed musical instrument into synthesizer maintaining the sounding expressiveness.

I enjoy skateboarding, but when practicing alone, I found it hard to self-evaluate the techniques. Furthermore, the skater cannot handle the range of his own moves. Skaters need a feedback of their movement.<br><br>The pith of skateboarding is the control of the board. Thus we may come to the conclusion that we can judge a skater’s techniques by observing the movement of his skateboard. Acceleration is definitely a proper factor for tracking the movement of the skateboard.<br><br>In view of this situation, I develop a device to assist the skaters to practice wiser and safer. By recording the acceleration of the skateboard, it can provide the skater with an ‘image’ of his movements. The 3-axis accelerometer MMA7260 and a MCU form a Collect-Save-Transfer system. During practice, the device selectively records the movements of the skateboard. Data can be transferred to the computer via a specially designed program which starts the analysis and generates graphics of acceleration and the track of the skateboard. It can also be used for on-line communication, thus promoting the sport of skateboarding and elevating skating skills.<br><br>I invited skaters from a local skate club to evaluate my device and provide their data & feedback. During a series of tests, the device can record the skater’s moves and offer an objective feedback to the user, giving basis for further practice and thus making skateboarding practice no longer difficult.

At present,the support-type walking frame is used to help the old people or who have something wrong with their legs to walk .But when it is used, it must be picked up,and then moved forward,which will probably cause people to fall down. Thus I designed and constructed one new type of walking frame to overcome the problem with a sliding structure at the front foot and one small one-way movement wheel at the rear foot.The front foot moves forward 10 to 20cm and the wheel at the rear foot also moves forward when it is slightly pressed.The weight of people who use it is still supported by the walking frame,and meanwhile the safety is assured.The distance of the forward movement can be adjusted according to the demand of all kinds of people.The walking aid facility,which is convenient for the old and some relevant patients,are deliberately structured and are of high practicability.

NEURO-CONTROLLED BIONIC HAND
Juan Carlos Acosta
Dr. Michael M. Krop High School, Miami, FL

After centuries of technological advancements, thousands of military arm amputees are still faced with the complicated challenge of adapting to a physical world without the use of natural arms. The simple tasks of serving water, drinking out of a cup, eating, driving, holding hands with loved ones, etc... become complex obstacles that may become frustrating. The Neuro-Controlled Bionic Hand provides amputees with the doorway to an easier life - a life equivalent to having two natural functioning arms. With cutting edge technology such as motors, sensors, computers, etc... a bionic hand provides the amputees a chance to living their lives as normal as possible. In order to make the hand a reality, the arm was built and integrated with an operating system and a series of Neuro-activated sensors in order to provide an effective alternative to a real arm. A process of thinking and designing was used in order to design a hand with a full range of movement similarly to the flexibility and movement of a real hand. With the Neuro-Controlled Bionic Hand, a new age of science and technology has arisen - focused on developing solutions and alternatives for arm amputees. Amputees may now perform everyday activities with great ease and without having to put any effort into living their lives without real hands. In essence, the Neuro-Controlled Bionic Hand has provided a safe and efficient alternative to the problems that military arm amputees may face when living without natural hands.

ELECTROMAGNETIC DETECTION OF AQUIFERS
Alexander Kent Kendrick
Los Alamos High School, Los Alamos, NM

As the world's population expands, water is becoming a scarce resource. Controlled source electromagnetics provides the technology to locate and monitor new aquifers. Other important applications include monitoring potential groundwater contamination, and detecting land mines and drug smuggling tunnels. The purpose of this project was to design, build and field test a more sensitive gradiometer based aquifer detection system. A nine month time-lapse study was done over a known underground stream to correlate the amount of water with the size of the detection. This aquifer detection system uses two antennas, one to measure the induced electromagnetic field from the conductor and another to measure the primary field from the transmit antenna. These two signals are inputs to an exclusive-OR (XOR) gate based phase detector that determines the phase shift between them. The improved system separates these antennas, and wirelessly transmits the reference clock to minimize interference. The system successfully established a correlation between the measured water outflow from the underground stream and the size of the phase shift. This correlation provides the Bureau of Land Management with a non-intrusive method to measure the water level of the underground stream from the surface. Furthermore, the system tracked the path of the underground stream from its outflow to the last known survey location inside the cave. The system also discovered previously unknown tributaries that will direct future exploration. This sensitive aquifer detection system is capable of locating unknown shallow water resources and will provide crucial information for water management in arid regions.

HUMANOID GRIPPER HELPS LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD, YEAR II
Rachel Ann Aaronson
Satellite High School, Satellite Beach, FL

Achondroplasia, the most common form of dwarfism, occurs in one of every 25,000 births. Individuals with this diagnosis have compromised gripping and reaching capability. For dwarfs, typical devices found in stores (such as the Gopher Gripper®) require a large amount of gripping force, are insufficient in length and put excessive strain on the user’s wrist. A disciplined engineering process was followed to design, fabricate, and test an enhanced gripper that alleviates shortcomings of commercial mechanisms. <br><br>Quantitative requirements were derived from the project objectives, such as maximum shelf height, and maximum object size and weight. Anatomical measurements of Achondroplastic dwarfs were measured, analyzed, and used to derive additional design parameters. Engineering trades were conducted in areas including gripper design, actuator selection, arm design, and power system design. Trade results led to synthesis of the integrated design concept. This concept was then analyzed to validate expected performance prior to ordering parts. The design was then fabricated. The resulting enhanced gripper includes a telescoping arm, custom designed gripper, pistol grip with integrated controls, arm brace to minimize wrist strain, and advanced integrated battery.<br><br>The engineering prototype was tested in a realistic environment. All twenty test cases were successful, including various size cans, boxes, paper towels, produce, and a two liter soda bottle. <br><br>The next logical evolution of this design is to provide gripping force control via pressure sensors and feedback, allowing the user to safely handle delicate objects.

THE LIQUID PISTON ENGINE, PHASE 3
Kelly Maria Kleier
Notre Dame Academy, Park Hills, KY

The purpose of this research was to improve on an engine fueled by a heat source such as the sun to pump water. It was expected that such an engine would be useful for water pumping or as an irrigation system in a developing country. Six such models had been constructed in previous years. Models 7 to 10, reported here, relied on observations of previous models. These last four engines were very different from past designs. A completely new engine (Model 7) was constructed based on knowledge obtained from previous research. This engine included in-line cooling and heating columns as well as an adjustable regenerator. Variables were tested in order to determine how to make the oscillations reach a higher amplitude. Models 8 and 9 were constructed based on knowledge gained from Model 7. While these models achieved great oscillations, none produced reliable pumping. Model 10 was a simpler system created in order to return to the basic principles involved in creating a pump. Effective pumping was achieved in Model 10 and it was found that this small model pumped about 15 L of water per hour.

THE BIG LAUNCH: ARM ANGLE ADVANTAGE
Andrew Dean Moser
Homer Hanna High School, Brownsville, TX

The purpose of the experiment was to determine which launch angle (30, 45, or 60 degrees) and pivot arm length (40.6 cm or 59.7 cm) produced the greatest flight distance per ball tested using a self-constructed bungee-powered catapult. I tested: 1) professional golf ball; 2) foam practice golf ball; 3) perforated plastic practice golf ball; 4) solid, hollow plastic golf ball, and 5) generic rubber ball. I designed and constructed the launching device. I tested flight distance per ball type, angle, and pivot arm length and recorded measurements using a standard measuring tape in inches. I calculated average flight distances by adding distances for trials A-E (I-X) for angles 30, 45, and 60 degrees at 40.6 cm and 59.7 cm pivot arm lengths, respectively, and dividing each by ten. Using conversion factor 1 in. = 2.54 cm, I converted average flight distances from inches to centimeters. Graphed results showed a direct relationship between launch angle and pivot arm length. Average flight distances for all ball types increased as the launch angle and pivot arm length increased. My hypothesis that the 45 degrees launch angle and the 40.6 cm pivot arm length will produce maximum flight distance for all ball types was disproved by my experiment. Instead, maximum flight distances for all ball types was produced at the 60 degrees launch angle and the 59.7 cm pivot arm length. I performed ten trials for each manipulated variable for three angles and two pivot arm lengths yielding 300 trials.

DRUM TROUSERS
Aseem Mishra
Hymers College, Hull, Yorkshire, UNITED KINGDOM

My Drum Trousers consist of a fully playable drum kit that can be comfortably integrated into any pair of regular trousers,<br><br>The device has eight sensors, each producing a different programmable sound. These sensors are robust, durable and cheap with variably sensitivity allowing for the user to control dynamics. The sensors can also identify a quick succession of notes so that more challenging pieces can be played by trained professional drummers. When connected with concealable external pieces of technology, they form an ultraportable drum kit. They can be played anywhere and everywhere, in public or at home. The Trousers are also compatible with headphones as well as containing integrated speakers to broadcast music on the go. They can also be plugged into any amplifier to resemble the volume of an acoustic drum kit.<br><br>When hit the analogue signals produced from the sensors are converted to MIDI; a universal standard language understood by all computers. Hence the trousers achieve universal compatibility with computers, allowing them to be used with thousands of commercially available software packages. However to remove the requirement of a dedicated computer interface, I successfully modified an old keyboard in such a way that it can now understand MIDI. Consequently, the sounds stored on the keyboard’s processor are accessible to the Trousers’ user. This processor is stored in a practical easy to carry rucksack.

DRILL PRESS WITH LASER CONE CENTERING DEVICE
R. M. Aruna Prasad Keerthirathna
Vidyartha College, Kandy, Central, SRI LANKA

This project is to design a mechanism to locate the drilling point without an error on a work piece. To locate the point of drilling, workmen have to lower and raise the drill bit several times, and this sometimes does not give a good result. In this invention this problem is addressed. A rotating laser beam is used to locate the exact drilling point.<br><br>A laser torch was inserted to a rotating disk at an angle. This disc was mounted on the chuck of a drill. When rotating, this beam cast a cone shape in the space. Focal point of the beam (or the apex of the cone) gives the point to be drilled. This method eliminates the trial and error method.<br><br>Some specifications of equipment used are as follows. Range of laser intensity: Class II laser with maximum 1mW, Color Red and 650 nm wave length. This method has been tested using 8 cm Drill Bit. Battery used to power the laser circuit is 3.6 V/ 60mAhr.<br><br>This method can be used in combination with hand or mechanical drills available in market, or they can be easily modified to incorporate this attachment to enhance the quality of the end product. Tests done using drills, available in the market, has given good results. Further improvements can be done to this attachment to measure the depth of the drilled hole. Since this method uses a single beam, cost of the product also can be kept low. A centrifugal switch could be incorporated to save the life of the battery.

SEEBECK RADIATORS: THE POTENTIAL OF PELTIER COOLERS TO IMPROVE AN AUTOMOTIVE SYSTEM
Nathaniel J. Miller
Rio Grande Enrichment Studies, Albuquerque, NM

A major environmental issue today concerns the effects of automobile pollution and efficiency. Recycling lost energy, increasing fuel economy, and protecting air quality are areas in which a vehicle could be improved. Engine combustion of gasoline creates excess heat energy which the radiator disperses into the atmosphere. One way to recycle this heat is to redesign the radiator and incorporate Peltier coolers using the Seebeck effect. The purpose of this project was to research how a Peltier cooler’s temperature difference could produce electricity using a TEC1-12706, how the electrical output could be maximized, and how a stacked Peltier cooler design could create a Seebeck radiator. Analysis indicated one could convert some of the heat energy from a radiator to electricity and use it to reduce the electrical load on the alternator, therefore reducing the usage of gasoline and saving money. Based on research, this study estimates a Seebeck radiator containing Peltier coolers, at a cost of approximately $350, could save a person $110 per year in gasoline costs for an automobile in the U.S. and $260 in Europe with even more for a semi-truck. The environmental benefit of a Seebeck radiator is the reduction of an automobile’s carbon dioxide emissions into the air by up to 500 pounds per year. This is a decrease of approximately 4% of a car’s total yearly CO2 emissions. Analysis also gave several other potential applications include generating electricity for satellites and also reducing the thermal signatures of aircraft, tanks, and other military vehicles.

THE DESIGN & CONSTRUCTION OF AN IMPROVED POINT-OF-USE ANTIMICROBIAL WATER PURIFICATION SYSTEM
Jonathan Charles Fuqua
Nicolet High School, Glendale, WI

Through natural disasters and geo-cultural circumstances, people worldwide are consuming water that is unclean and dangerous. Diseases such as Cholera and Dysentery are plaguing sections of our world including Haiti, Central America, and parts of Africa. A profound need exists for an improved, simple, point-of-use anti-microbial water purification system.<br><br> Disinfection through UV-C radiation is a proven method of inactivating pathogenic microorganisms. UV-C light is electromagnetic radiation that penetrates the cell wall of an organism and damages the DNA rendering it incapable of reproducing and infecting a host and causing a disease.<br><br> The UV-C purification system presented for this project offers several design improvements over current portable purification devices. A key addition is a spiral-shaped recirculation water reservoir with a valve that can adjust the flow rate, thereby increasing or decreasing the UV-C exposure time.<br><br> Given the known volume within the UV-C exposure chamber (190 ml), the total water volume of the system (1.57 L), and the flow rate at any given valve setting, the exposure time can be quantified for each valve setting. The sensitivity of waterborne pathogenic microorganisms to UC-C light is well documented, and each organism has a unique sensitivity level. At lower flow rates, all targeted organisms would receive UV-C light exposure at levels far exceeding the amount needed to inactivate them. In conclusion, the improved UV-C purifier is highly effective for the purpose for which it was designed.

THE EFFECT OF LIGHT WAVELENGTH ON SOLAR CELL EFFICIENCY
Jill Grey Ferguson
Staunton River High School/ Roanoke Valley Governor's School, Moneta, VA

The varying wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum propagate with different properties and energies. Today, solar cells are used to harness the energy from the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet wavelengths to produce renewable energy, and to accelerate the wide spread usages of light itself. The purpose of this project was to quantify the effect of infrared, visible, and ultraviolet wavelengths on the efficiency of a solar cell. The hypothesis was, if a solar cell was used to harness infrared wavelength, visible, ultraviolet, and no light wavelength (control), then the varying wavelengths have a significant impact on efficiency and the ultraviolet light source would result in production of the most efficiency. <br><br> The light bulbs of varying wavelengths were of the same wattage and experimented in a dark room. The bulbs were secured 25.4 cm from the solar cell, and the appropriate equipment was attached to the solar cell leads accordingly. Each bulb was tested ten times at thirty seconds each trail. A data point was collected 120 times per second, resulting in 3615 data values each trial. The average voltage and current of each trial was recorded, and with that data, the power and efficiency were calculated. <br><br>An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed and the overlapping confidence intervals were interpreted using two-sample t-tests. The results suggested that the average T-test was significantly different. In perspective, the varying wavelengths of light significantly impact the efficiency of solar cells, as the p-values were less than 0.05. The hypothesis was partially supported as varying wavelengths of light significantly varied the results, however, the ultraviolet wavelength was not the most efficient.

A HIGH EFFICIENCY SOLAR ENERGY COLLECTION SYSTEM
Katherine Lee Zimmerman
Braden River High School, Bradenton, FL

The purpose of the investigation was to create a prototype solar energy collection system by combining a solar thermal panel and a photovoltaic cell. The combined system efficiency was compared to the efficiency of a solar thermal panel and a photovoltaic cell alone. The goal of the investigation was to show that by combining a solar thermal panel and a photovoltaic cell, the total amount of energy, and the total system efficiency could be increased.<br><br>A small solar thermal panel was constructed, and a photovoltaic cell was purchased and assembled together in an insulated solar collector. Water was then circulated through the solar thermal panel and the temperature rise of the water was measured. At the same time, the photovoltaic cell power output was measured. The total solar energy absorbed by the combined system was compared to the energy produced by the photovoltaic cell and the thermal panel, individually. All temperature and voltage measurements were taken using an EMANT300 Data Acquisition System. <br><br>In the experiment, it was found that by combining a photovoltaic and solar thermal panel, the efficiency of the combined system was about the same as using a thermal panel by itself. However, it was found that by operating a photovoltaic cell at a controlled, lower temperature, that the efficiency of the photovoltaic cell was increased compared to using the photovoltaic cell by itself. The advantage of combining the solar thermal and photovoltaic cell is increased power density when compared to using a thermal panel and photovoltaic panel separately. The electrical output of the combined system was increased more than 40 percent. The thermal power density was increased by more than 60 percent.

SOLAR PANEL EFFICIENCY: A MORE COLORFUL FUTURE
Samantha Paige Myers
Divine Child High School, Dearborn, MI

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effect of reflecting light back into a solar panel. If such reflected light increased the electric output of the solar panel, lighter or more reflective coatings underneath a solar panel would allow for a greater electric output. To test reflected light’s effect on a solar panel, multiple-colored background boards were placed underneath a translucent solar panel. Readings of both voltage and amperage were taken from 2 kinds of light sources, 2 distances from the light, and 6 backgrounds, and 2 different resistances. In the first trial, the silver background resulted in the highest current of 217.0 micro A, followed closely by the white background with 216.6 micro A. In comparison, black resulted in 215.1 micro A, the lowest output of the trial. Other trials maintained the pattern of the white and silver producing the highest outputs of both current and voltage. In 50% of the trials, the white resulted in the greatest electric output. In two of the three trials that white did not have the greatest output, silver surpassed white, and in the other trial white, red, and silver all tied. Two of the six trials showed a decrease in electric output when the silver background was used, possibly resulting from damage to background board or a short in the circuit. Conclusively, the use of lighter and more reflective colors, particularly white and silver, underneath a solar panel did lead to consistent increases in both the amperage and voltage of the solar panel.

INCREASING THE EFFICIENCY OF SOLAR TRACKING SYSTEMS
Michael Anthony Cerabona
Yorktown High School, Yorktown Heights, NY

Previous research has shown that a solar tracking system can improve the output of a solar cell by 30% by increasing the cross-sectional absorption area of the sun's rays. However, tracking devices are not widely used in solar installations because they are inefficient because they use high speed/low torque motors. This creates a load mismatch with current tracking systems which require a low speed and high torque input. Expensive gearboxes are often used to solve this problem, nearly defeating the purpose of a tracking system. This research has focused on replacing these inefficient mismatched motors with a material called muscle wire, a shape memory alloy that contracts when electric current is applied. The muscle-wire tracking system consists of a muscle-wire gear assembly, a differential photodetector and electronic driver circuitry. Once designed and completed, the prototype was tested outdoors, and results showed that it was able to precisely track the sun, providing a 24% increase in energy output over the control stationary cell. Additionally, calculations demonstrated that over the course of a day of tracking the sun, the muscle wire used only .00147 KWH of electricity. When scaled up, it is projected to provide a 45% greater net-output than other motor-based systems. This research has served as a proof-of-concept that will allow solar tracking systems to be more efficient, cost effective, more widely used.

A ROBOTIC ASSISTANT FOR THE VISUALLY-IMPAIRED (RAVI): A NOVEL SYSTEM EMPLOYING DIGITAL IMAGE PROCESSING AND SONAR RANGE DETECTION
Ishwarya Ananthabhotla
Kings Park High School, Kings Park, NY

In contemporary society, giving visually impaired humans the ability to exhibit a great degree of freedom in their daily lives has been a challenging task to achieve. In an attempt to present an alternative to the need for constant human or animal accompaniment, an autonomous Robotic Assistant for the Visually Impaired (RAVI) has been proposed. The purpose of this project was to physically construct, program, interface, and test a fully operational Robotic Assistant for the Visually Impaired, or RAVI, using an iRobot Create mobile platform, digital image processing techniques, and sonar range detection. The robotic system consists of a mobile platform, the iRobot Create with an Atmel168 microcontroller, a camera mounted on an extendable arm, a sonar rangefinder mounted on a digital servo, a PC, and a platform to hold all of the other components. The software for the robot consists of two major components: human tracking via digital image processing, and obstacle detection and width measurement via sonar sensing. After the application of this software, experiments to correlate human speed to RAVI’s tracking accuracy, to test its speed control functions, and to examine the functionality of its width measuring algorithm were conducted. The resulting data demonstrated minimal margins of error, and a cost analysis showed RAVI to be substantially cheaper than any alternative solution. Both indicate that RAVI is a practical step forward in the field of assistive technology.

GNUT, III: AN A.I.R.V.I.S. (ANTHROPOMETRIC INTERACTIVE ROBOT WITH VISION INTELLIGENCE & SPEECH)
Arjun Aggarwal
Lexington High School, Lexington, SC

The engineering goal of my project was the development of a functional and economical A.I.R.V.I.S. (Anthropometric Interactive Robot with Vision, Intelligence and Speech) for testing robotic algorithms. The design was based on physiology and anthropometry of the human body. The result was the creation of, GNut-III, an anthropometric biped robot with two hands, a waist, and a head with independently directed camera eyes. With anthropometric degrees of freedom, the robot can place either hand at any desired position and in any given orientation within its workspace in an unlimited number of ways. The camera eyes can track an object, interpret and translate external gestures into commands. Augmented Reality is also utilized for object tracking and command interpretation. GNut-III utilizes the free A.L.I.C.E. AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) knowledge base for intelligent conversations. The robot also utilizes speech recognition and synthesis libraries for speech. An array of sensors have been utilized for making the robot interactive. An onboard touch screen monitor allows for direct interface with the robot; thus a complete short height human inspired robot has been designed and realized. GNut-III reflects the typical anthropometric mass distribution of human beings and is 145 cm tall. The prototype can move at the neck, head, arms (all joints) and waist using 24 degrees of freedom actuated by 18 servomotors controlled by a computer. This project necessitated several hundred man hours of work; it took more than six months to construct and program the robot. Three prototypes of the robot and the program were developed to accomplish the goal. The legs of the robot are non functional. Continued work will be needed in order for the robot to walk autonomously.

BRAIN COMPUTER INTERFACE
David Alexandre Joseph Campeau
Mayo High School, Rochester, MN

A brain computer interface (BCI) is a device that can translate the brain’s electrical activity into messages or commands. My goal for this project was to design and build a low-cost brain computer interface that could control a 1-dimensional parameter without physical movement, using only thoughts. The constructed BCI device incorporated an 8-channel digital EEG based upon a newly developed Texas Instruments ADS1298 low-power CMOS integrated circuit, which packages eight programmable gain amplifiers and eight 24-bit simultaneously acquiring delta-sigma analog to digital (ADC) converters. I interfaced the ADS1298 to an Arduino microcontroller via a serial peripheral interface (SPI), which I then interfaced via USB to a personal computer running Matlab. I developed embedded software (C Language) for the Arduino’s Atmel 1280 microprocessor to control the EEG system processes. I also developed versatile real-time Matlab processing algorithms for extracting features from the digitized EEG signals using digital filters, Fourier transformation, spectral analysis, and statistical descriptors of the signals. Principal classification targets were alpha wave (posterior dominant rhythm), and Mu-rhythm from movement or imagined movement of extremities. EEG artifacts (eye blink, jaw clench) were investigated as additional classification targets, enabling use of facial gestures to augment the capabilities of the BCI. The developed BCI can reliably control a user specified 1-dimensional parameter following a period of training/calibration. With continued development, BCI is likely to become an important alternative way to communicate with machines, computers, and each other.

DEVELOPMENT OF A SCALABLE SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE FOR THE EFFICIENT PRODUCTION OF INTERACTIVE AND RESPONSIVE ROBOTIC BEHAVIOR
Austin Wendell Duff
Gaithersburg High School, Gaithersburg, MD

Visual based robots are valued for their dynamic real-world problem solving capabilities including the ability to recognize, track and pursue objects. However, the design of efficient control software is often complicated and time-consuming. Thus, I developed a novel scalable software architecture that functions as an advanced and simplified model for creating interactive and responsive capabilities in robotics. This aggregate architecture allows software developers to create more effective dynamic control systems for robots quickly, cleanly and efficiently. An advanced visual processing robot was created using the model, demonstrating the architecture’s effectiveness. The robot demonstrated how running multiple simultaneous independent standardized processes produced substantially more efficient and reliable higher-end behavior than traditional robotic software models including fluid locomotion during recognition and tracking. The method’s focus was twofold: simplified production of interactive and responsive capabilities and facilitation of scalability. Target capabilities were broken down into individual linear processes capable of being reproduced in robotic derivatives. These were then refined and packaged as individual routines according to a universal and standardized structure, which streamlined assembly. The scalability of the system indicates that simple processes at the lowest end of the hierarchal architecture are better candidates for standardization and are less demanding to produce in software subroutines. These processes were optimized for parallel computing and for concurrent communication with other processes. This research ultimately could allow faster development of more fluid and advanced control systems for robots.

RE-PURPOSING OF ELECTRONIC PARTS TO BUILD A WIND TURBINE
Samantha Jaye Selby
Saint Clair High School, St. Clair, MO

Old electronics, called e-waste, are sent to developing countries for reuse, but often pile up because they are broken beyond repair. The purpose of this experiment was to utilize the clean, renewable energy potential in the wind; and to recycle old computers that may not be fully functional to make something useful. The CD drive motor of a computer was used as the generator for a small wind turbine, and almost all of the components and building materials are from the computer as well. Placed in front of a fan, the turbine converted enough energy to light an LED light bulb and charge a rechargeable battery. It was observed that the longer blades were able to convert more energy, and that using a rectifier blocks a small amount of the voltage to the battery. It would be possible to build this generator and receive results.

I found out that I must use PWM (pulse width modulation) for converting input signal to signal which would be adequate for next convertion to hot plasma. IC (integrated circuit) TL494 was the best for converting the signal because it include PWM, amplifer, oscillator which is producing the best carrier frequency 40 KHz. For converting low voltage to higher, I used High voltage transformator because for creating plasma arc I need at least 10 KV. For amplifying current primary coil I used permisible-blocking bridge amplifer with RC(ressistor-capacitor) dampening segment. This segment had better quality of sound than the others which I tried.<br><br>I create speaker which prudce the sound by hot plasma withnou any mechanical parts.

The concept that inspired this project is to create an autonomous lifeguarding system to produce a safer environment for swimmers at unstaffed beaches. The focus of this project is on creating the preliminary design for the autonomous guided projectile system. With the use of stereo vision, a calibrated system will recognize a target, orient itself to that target, triangulate the distance to the target, determine the necessary air pressure to traverse the distance to the target, and accurately hit the target with a projectile.<br><br>A preliminary design was constructed in the form of a semi-autonomous guided projectile system. After testing several prototypes, their strengths were used to produce two subsystems: a functioning stereo vision rig and a pneumatic projectile system. An eight-meter by two-meter grid was constructed, divided into 10 cm by 10 cm sub-grids in order to help determine the impact location of the projectile relative to the target. Data was collected to measure the efficiency of the stereo rig and the projectile system.<br><br>Based on the results of the investigation, the design produced a highly precise and accurate target acquisition system. The projectile was off by an average of 8.7 % error (a distance about the length of this page); while the calculated distance was off by an average of 2.7% error. Several modifications can be made to further improve the overall system. Through continued modifications and improvement, it is hoped that a functional autonomous system will serve as a tool used by lifeguards to produce a safer environment for swimmers at beaches.

HARNESSING ENERGY FROM OCEAN WAVES BY MEANS OF VERTICAL OSCILLATION AND UNIDIRECTIONAL ROTATION
Cody McKay Cummings
Bonneville High School, Ogden, UT

The ocean has a vast amount of potential energy available. This energy can be used in tandem with other alternative sources of energy to mitigate our oil dependence.<br><br>My objective was to design a device to harness energy from the coastal areas of the ocean where waves begin to break. These areas are not typically used as a source of energy due to the difficulty of compensating for the change in wave form and water depth that comes with tides.<br><br>This device, comprised of a paddle wheel and oscillating buoys sliding on guiderails, has built-in redundancy ensuring that energy is generated regardless of the point in the tide. This was done by taking advantage of vertical oscillation of the waves and unidirectional rotation of the device’s wheel, thus ensuring a dual source of power.<br><br>The device was tested at a wave pool in various water depths, wave heights and forms. The mechanism produced energy regardless of the tidal stage. Tests were performed at water depths between 0 and 4 feet with 1.7 foot waves breaking at a depth of 2.75 feet. The wheel speed and amount of vertical oscillation were measured. Maximum wattage was created at the point where the waves began breaking.<br><br>The device is an effective means of generating electricity regardless of varying water depths and wave forms. It should be installed at the mean breaking point along the coast. The device is easy to install and requires minimal maintenance; it is a clean and continuous energy source.

HUMANOID ROBOT TELEOPERATION
Bryce Joseph Reitano
Utah Virtual Academy, Murray, UT

Some jobs are dangerous and put the workers in harmful situations; by developing a reliable interface for handling those dangerous situations would minimize putting humans at risk. Following the engineering process, I first engineered the basic design I wanted to construct. I then determined the products needed to fulfill the drafted design and use those product specifications to refine the original draft. After receiving the products, I tested all the products to verify if they fulfilled whether they are going to be used in the design. Moving forward I cut and bent the aluminum in the way needed to accomplish my design. I then attached all peripherals to the aluminum pieces and wired all the peripherals to where they were required. Knowing that the design wasn't perfect I redesigned what ever was necessary to accomplish my engineering goals. Finally I programmed and installed the required software and packages on the development platforms. Now, running the installed software on the host (laptop) and client (robot) I was able to control the robots movements with my own motions. Using this procedure I was able to accomplish my engineering goals; designing and constructing a humanoid robot, having the ability to mimic my motions accurately and efficiently, and use simple navigation controls corresponding to those simple gestures. Expanding on this technology and using a more sophisticated robot, this technology could be used to save hundreds of lives everyday; through surgery, preventing nuclear accidents, and other cases where potential physical harm is at risk.

LIGHT FILTERING WITH PHOTOVOLTAIC CONCENTRATOR SYSTEMS
Ostin David Zarse
Tucson High Magnet School, Tucson, AZ

The goal of this project was to explore the effect light filtering has on photovoltaic concentrator systems. A 3M light filter was used along with two different reflectors, flat and parabolic, on two types of solar panels, CuInGaSe2 (CIGS) and Polycrystalline Silicon. All the possible combinations were constructed, ending with 12 treatments of reflectors, filters, and photovoltaic panels. These were placed outside for six hours. Every half hour, open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, and temperature was measured for each treatment. Five of these tests were conducted.<br><br> The data show that the 3M filter lowers the current of the polycrystalline panels by an average of 37%, most likely because the filter removes some of the useful infrared light that would normally contribute to power output. The filter also decreased voltage for the same reason. Therefore, the total power output was decreased. The filter lowered the temperature by an average of 7%. The reflectors increased the power output by 2-4% in the Polycrystalline cells. The CIGS cells were not as affected by the increased light intensity. The filters increased the temperature by an average of 34% with the flat reflector, possibly caused by the cardboard backing. In conclusion, 3M filter was not effective at reducing temperature gain and actually removed useful light, reducing the power output. A more ideal filter that does not eliminate the useful spectra might show an increase in efficiency; however, the largest results will come with the use of a larger concentration reflector.

ORNITHOPTER DESIGN: OPTIMIZING TURNING RADIUS
Kristin Anne Goehl
Wachusett Regional High School, Holden, MA

Ornithopters are planes with flapping wings currently being investigated for use as small surveillance aircraft. The purpose of this project was to design a dynamic turning mechanism that decreased the turning radius but maintained the stability of a small ornithopter in flight, while having a smaller turning radius than a fixed-wing aircraft. <br><br> Three existing turning designs—the use of a wing stiffener to decrease wing efficiency, a horizontal rotation of the tail, and a vertical twist of the tail—were tested with three variables each for turning radius and stability using a video measurement system and a stability scale. The test for turning radius and stability was repeated using the three designs in various combinations. Based on the results of the prior experimentation, a prototype ornithopter was designed and built using a novel turning mechanism. The results of the prototype were compared to the calculated turning radii of fixed-wing aircraft with a similar wingspan/mass. <br><br> It was found that combinations of the different turning mechanism designs resulted in a smaller, more stable turning radius. When the calculated fixed-wing aircraft values for standard flight speeds were compared to the prototype, the prototype had a much smaller turning radius of 0.5 meters. This calculation also indicated that if the fixed-wing aircraft could fly at the same speed as an ornithopter, it could have a similar turning radius. These results suggest that the increased maneuverability of an ornithopter is due to its ability to fly at slower speeds.

NAVIBOT, PHASE IV
Matthew Joseph Hummel
Florence High School #14-1, Florence, SD

The purpose of this year’s robot is to purify water sources with the use of X-tec fabric and the Navibot’s self-navigation system. The engineering goal for this project was to determine if the Navibot could effectively absorb all of the oil out of a contaminated water source when equipped with X-tex fabric.<br><br> The student researcher created a new design for this year’s model of the Navibot. He used a double-y fitting of PVC for the robot body. Filling the side channels of the body with expanding foam provided buoyancy for the robot body. The student researcher then programmed the Navibot with a navigation code adapted for water travel. Next, the robotics dome was attached to the top of the fitting with the motors placed on either side of the PVC fitting to allow for movement. Vegetable oil was added to a large tub of water to simulate a situation where crude oil would be dispersed throughout a water source such as an ocean or lake. A board was used to create wave action in the tub of water to provide real-life operating conditions. The student researcher then powered up the Navibot and ran the oil purification test.<br><br> Based upon 6 trial runs, the student researcher concluded that the Navibot successfully purified the given water source of oil pollutants by removing 90% of the oil contaminants added to the water. Probable applications for the Navibot could include but are not limited to: purifying oil spills and removing debris from water sources.

THE SAND PLOTTER: MERGING ENGINEERING AND ART
Michelle Diane Barchak
Joplin High School, Joplin, MO

I created a device that would draw patterns in sand with a steel ball controlled by a magnet in an x/y system. My goal was to use a microcontroller to control stepper motors that would move the magnet in specific patterns. <br><br> I designed the device while building it, using easily obtained materials. Stepper motors were mounted on each corner of a square base with shafts pointing counter clockwise and attached to threaded shafts. As each turned, it moved a set of square nuts in an aluminum channel. A steel rod was connected to each set of nuts on parallel shafts and run through holes drilled in a PVC end cap, which held the magnet and slid along the rods at their point of intersection. A thin layer of sand was spread over a rigid plastic cover on the mechanism and a steel ball was placed above the magnet. <br><br> Each set of parallel motors were synchronously driven by one EasyDriver. They were connected to a power supply and an Arduino microcontroller. I programmed the microcontroller in C, writing functions to move the magnet a specific direction and a specific distance, while it monitored its position relative to center. I used the functions to create patterns for the ball to trace, including squares, square spirals, and circles. This device can be easily reprogrammed to draw any continuous pattern, or modified for other applications, such as metal or wood engraving and cutting, by replacing the magnet with a laser or blade.

A STAND-OFF SEISMO-ACOUSTIC METHOD FOR HUMANITARIAN DEMINING
Marian Joan Bechtel
Hempfield High School, Landisville, PA

Approximately 70 million landmines infest 80 countries worldwide, claiming over 500 victims weekly. This study investigated a seismo-acoustic method for humanitarian demining. It was hypothesized that a buried landmine would resonate with a remote seismic source, and stand-off microphones could detect the anomalous sound of the vibrating mine, pinpointing its location. Two laboratory-grade microphones were swept over an outdoor test bed containing wet or dry sand, across buried metal or plastic mock landmines, or barren sand for control. A concrete vibrator on the far side of the bed generated seismic waves, exciting the mines. The two microphones recorded the sound separately, to allow ambient noise cancellation. This revealed a dramatic, characteristic, audible null when the microphone array was centered over the mine. Statistical testing confirmed that the null was significant for landmine versus non-landmine recordings, validating the hypothesis. This could lead to a simple, cheap, and reliable humanitarian demining tool.

SURVIVING CLIMATE CHANGE – HEAT TRANSFER IN ANCIENT NATIVE AMERICAN BUILDINGS: COMPARISON OF EXPERIMENTAL AND CALCULATED RESULTS
Nicholas Conrad Rajen
Eldorado High School, Albuquerque, NM

The purpose of this experiment is to understand how heat goes in and out of ancient Native American buildings. I have measured the solar radiation falling on the buildings, the temperatures outside and inside walls, and estimated the thermal conductivity of the ancient materials. I also measured the temperatures on materials of known thickness and thermal conductivity (Fiberglass) kept in sunlight near the ancient structures – this allowed me to estimate the solar radiation. Then, knowing this radiation and measuring temperatures on the ancient walls, I was able to estimate their thermal conductivity. In the first year of this project, I measured conductivities at ancient ruins made of volcanic tuff at Bandelier National Monument. This year I also studied ancient structures made of sandstone at Chaco Canyon. I then created a computer model to solve for heat conduction in these walls. I have used a simple numerical procedure to solve the heat flow differential equation and compared the modeled results with experimental values. Then, I also created an experimental set-up and heated a small piece of volcanic tuff under controlled conditions. The results from this experiment were compared with the computer model. These experiments have application for affecting the design of modern buildings, perhaps making them more efficient – a key part of controlling climate change and reducing energy use and greenhouse gases.

COMPUTER MODEL OF TIME-VARYING HEAT CONDUCTION IN A PLATE
Ivan Vikram Rajen
Eldorado High School, Albuquerque, NM

This project develops a computer model that solves two-dimensional transient heat conduction. Heat conduction in a plate is solved by breaking up the plate into a large number of small pieces into each of which heat flows in and out, and also heats the piece. This results in a linked series of algebraic equations that are solved using an Excel spread-sheet. The results of the model are then plotted as a series of graphs and contour maps at varying times. The computer results are also compared to an experiment conducted using an insulated metal plate starting at a uniform temperature that then has the temperature of one edge changed to zero degrees centigrade. Finally, the computer model is extended to cases that are difficult to model in an experiment.

VARIABLE VOLTAGES: AN EXPERIMENT ON THE VIABILITY OF OVERCLOCKING
Andrew Michael Bartolo
Swink Jr-Sr High School, Swink, CO

The intent of this experiment was to determine voltages necessary to be supplied to core computer components in order to attain stability at overclocked speeds. I hypothesized that CPU core voltage, VCore, would be most necessary to attain stability. Additionally, I hypothesized that slight overclocking would be acceptable for use in an error-intolerant (mission critical) environment.<br><br> The hypothesis was tested on a self-built, high-performance desktop computer running the Linux operating system. Intel Linpack stress-testing software was installed, and stability trials were run at 2.6GHz (factory default), 3.6GHz, 3.8GHz, 4.0GHz, and 4.2GHz. Voltages were raised sequentially, in their hypothesized order of importance, in order to attain stability at each speed.<br><br> As speed was increased from the default 2.6GHz up through 4.2GHz, system components required more voltage, as was generally hypothesized. Increased VCore was most necessary in attaining stability, followed by increased VDIMM (RAM voltage). Voltages measured for other components required no discernible increase.<br><br> Though raising voltages allowed the system to pass its intended stability test, Linpack, other errors occurred at overclocked speeds. These errors could not be dependably reproduced upon a system restart. However, any increased chance of error is considered to be unacceptable in a mission-critical environment. Thus, overclocking is not recommended for critical systems, such as servers and workstations.

PASSIVE SOLAR TRACKING
Anthony Vladimir Surganov
Albert Grannis Lane Technical College Preparatory High School, Chicago, IL

Purpose - The purpose of the experiment is to create an efficient solar tracker without the use of electricity. A standard solar tracker follows the sun throughout the day generally requiring electricity to power the tilting mechanism. This passive solar tracker does not use any electrical energy to power itself, but instead relies on a phase change of liquid to gas to create the tilt.<br><br>Procedure - Check the ambient temperature, if it is not 20*C, adjust room temperature accordingly. Take the designed model and place it in the lightless room while it is leaning 45* toward the floodlight. Place the floodlights at a 45* angle, at a 1m radius from the solar panel. Attach a multi-meter to the prongs on the side of the panel and turn it on. Activate the lights and leave them to operate for 10 minutes. After the 10 minute period, record the cell's voltage and amperage. Using Joule's law, calculate power. Repeat the experiment with the floodlights at 90* and 135* in respect to the horizontal.<br><br>Data - The average power output of the passive solar tracker was 27.11 watts per half hour with a standard deviation of 9.31 watts vs. the stationary panel's average power output of 19.39 watts per half hour with a standard deviation of 9.17 watts confirming the passive tracker was 39.81% more efficient.<br><br>Conclusion - In summation, the hypothesis was proven to be correct. The proposed gas model produced significantly more power, as opposed to the stationary solar panel. Although the hypothesis was proven true, the experiment was not without errors. Such possible errors included in this experiment could have stemmed from a slight imbalance in the construction, resulting in a less than ideal tracking speed therefore skewing the results. It is hoped that the information gathered in this experiment will allow nations to focus on a brighter, cleaner, and more cost-effective future.

ROBOTIC LEGS
Louis Garcia
Carlsbad High School, Carlsbad, NM

This project is a continuation of my last year project. My engineering goal is still the same, to make a robotic leg, but I'm mainly focusing on the knee and hip joint. The leg still has to function like a human and has to be balance on each side. I researched on the human legs, so I can improve the legs capability. I used my previous designs to determine the walking issues of the leg.<br><br> First, I looked at the motion of a human leg and began to build new designs for the legs. I decided to build new legs that are stronger and more powerful than my last prototypes. I replaced Lego NXT brain with a Vex since it’s more powerful, sturdy, and has more ports for sensors and motors. I used large motors to simulate the muscle on the hip to raise the leg and servo motors to lift the knee. I used PVC for the bone structure, since it’s strong and lightweight. I used PVC joints for the knee and hips joints. <br><br> For the tendons and ligaments, I used rubber bands and Zip-tie. I am continuing to collect data on the project. I currently working on incorporating the motors on the leg and programming the vex brain for the leg. As this is an ongoing project, there are no conclusion to made as of yet.

DEVELOPING MORE EFFICIENT MODELS OF TITANIUM DIOXIDE DYE-SENSITIZED SOLAR CELLS
Shawn S. Tuteja
The Altamont School, Birmingham, AL

My project, Developing More Efficient Models of Titanium Dioxide Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells, sought to increase the voltage and amperage in solar cells. To perform this experiment, I first had to build the titanium dioxide dye-sensitized solar cells. I applied titanium dioxide paste to the electrode of the cell, carbon to the counter electrode, and then I dipped the cells in various anthocyanin dyes. The three dyes used in the experiment were raspberry, blueberry, and chlorophyll. My experiment examined whether applying these dyes in different combinations (blending them together and then applying them to the cell) would have a positive effect on the voltage and amperage in the solar cells. In addition, I wanted to see how the titanium dioxide paste would affect the reading of the solar cells. To test this second question, I tested solar cells that had a single layer of titanium dioxide paste and others that had a double layer of the paste. The results showed that the cells that were applied with the blended dyes had a higher efficiency and amperage than the ones that were applied with only one anthocyanin dye at a time. Additionally, the second modification, which was the addition of another layer of titanium dioxide paste, increased the efficiency and amperage even more, especially when this modification was tested with the previous modification of the blended dyes. Dye-sensitized solar cells are already more environmentally friendly than their silicon-based predecessors, and my project has found a way to increase their efficiency to an even greater degree.

CELLULAR PHONE DETECTOR: EFFECTIVE DETECTION AND RECOGNITION OF RADIO SIGNALS GENERATED BY DIGITAL DEVICES
Thomas Peter Foulkes
Terre Haute North Vigo High School, Terre Haute, IN

Undoubtedly, fatalities and automobile accidents due to distracted driving involving the use of digital devices have become one of the greatest pandemics plaguing America’s roadways. The purpose of this project was to investigate possible solutions to the engineering problem: Can a receiving device to detect, interpret, and respond appropriately to radio signal transmissions made by cellular phones be constructed? The results from this investigation are significant because early, accurate detection and response to transmissions sent by automobile operators has the capacity not only to alert other automobile operators to the presence of an impaired driver, but also to potentially save lives. This investigation was subdivided into eight phases, during which a receiver that could detect cellular phone transmissions was successfully designed, constructed, and tested with twenty different cellular phones. Results from this phase revealed that the receiver’s effective range was 50cm and 70cm for low and high power cellular phones respectively, which are ideal conditions for monitoring the operator of the automobile. Further investigation in the remaining phases, such as designing and programming a digital logic circuit, testing the impact of circuitry encasing materials, and creating additional receiving circuits that triangulate the source location of the generated signal transmission, was completed, and confirmed the usefulness and potential benefits for society. Finally, the analysis of the results highlighted that a receiver, which can detect, interpret, and respond to the transmission of radio signals from a digital device, had been successfully designed and constructed fulfilling all phases of this engineering process.

TAKING THE HEAT OFF
Chase Evan Herman
Nixa High School, Nixa, MO

This project was inspired by the needs for water conservation and energy efficiency, which could each play a role in cooling the internal temperature of an average house during the summer. In our society, air conditioning systems have become a necessity. Replacing these systems located in dry climates with evaporative cooling systems could satisfy both needs, but if water was simply evaporated off of the roof of the house, the expense of circulating air throughout that building would be reduced.<br><br>In this project, four different amounts of water: none, low, medium, and high, were run over three different roofs: smooth black, textured black, and smooth white, of a model house to see which roof and water combination could best cool the house using the least amount of water. A data acquisition unit and thermocouples were used to monitor the increase in the house’s internal temperatures above ambient temperature, which were recorded to my computer.<br><br>The data showed that the white roof kept the house 9.1 degrees Celsius cooler than the black roofs did until the medium flow rate was reached, and the roof type then became irrelevant because of the excessive water flow. Also, the data showed that the smooth black and textured black roofs had very similar effects on the house’s temperature because the texture on the roof was not large enough to disperse the water as expected. However, this system could be effectively and efficiently used in real life to control building temperatures within 4.5 degrees Celsius.

DON’T FEAR, IT’S SECURE: FLEXIBLE AND SECURE RFID SYSTEM DEPLOYMENT
Shayan J. Mohanty
Plano Senior High School, Plano, TX

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is used for the purpose of identification and tracking. While RFID is a low-cost solution to many inventory and mass-tracking problems, the deployment of an encrypted RFID system is very expensive due to the large wired infrastructure and the need for significantly more computing power in the central control nodes. The purpose of this project was to investigate the viability of a low cost RFID system that effectively combined the flexibility of wireless technology with the strength of the One Time Pad (OTP) based encryption. The design was based on the concept of individual self-contained and widely distributed RFID nodes communicating with each other over a wireless network utilizing encrypted data. In this system design, the possible number of OTP key combinations was up to 255 P 16 (i.e. 255 ASCII Characters that can be generated with 16 chosen from the group) – making it virtually impossible for someone to recreate the pad with a probability of success at 1: 1.97696E38. In addition to the strong encryption, each time a tag was registered, both the pad and input were randomly regenerated, further strengthening the system security.<br><br>As a result, the design effectively combined the flexibility of wireless networking; strong security of OTP based encryption and versatility of RFID technology. It can therefore be concluded that it is possible to design a networked cloud of distributed and self-contained RFID nodes based on the framework of mobility and security which can effectively render high-range, high-powered, and high-cost encrypted RFID systems obsolete.

ELECTROWETTING FOR NOVEL ELECTROMECHANICAL APPLICATIONS
Andrey Sushko
Hanford High School, Richland, WA

Surface tension determines fundamental properties of liquids. It can be viewed as energy stored in the surface layer; energy that can potentially be used to drive mechanical systems. Here we investigate the use of surface tension as means for actuating electromechanical devices, and perform proof-of-concept experiments demonstrating the feasibility of a stepper motor that relies exclusively on electrowetting.<br><br>The project uses the phenomenon of electrowetting, i.e. the decrease in the contact angle of a liquid on a solid electrode surface when a potential is applied between the liquid and the electrode. In this study we have demonstrated and quantified the electrowetting effect in single-droplet experiments and assessed several materials. We have shown that paraffin coated polyimide tape provides fully reversible wetting over more than 20 cycles. From here research progressed towards the design and construction of a prototype motor that does not rely on electromagnetic coils or a continuous flow of current to operate. This allows such devices to be scaled down to sub-millimeter dimensions at which conventional motors become impractical to manufacture. Electronic circuitry and software were developed for efficient control of the prototype. By applying a voltage in the range of 600V - 2000V a rotation of the rotor through over 150° was achieved.<br><br>The outcomes of this project are twofold. First, we constructed and demonstrated the feasibility of a novel electromechanical device. Second, the key factors affecting performance and reliability were identified and promising approaches for improving these characteristics were discussed.

TOUCHINGNOTES II: MUSIC FOR THE SENSES
Vinicius Guilherme Muller
Escola Tecnica Liberato Salzano Vieira da Cunha, Novo Hamburgo, RS, BRASIL

Music has always had great importance and significance for humans, however, it is not a benefit experienced by deaf people. My research aims to develop a device capable of interpreting commands in the MIDI protocol from a computer or musical keyboard, coding the notes played on vibrations. The purpose of the research is to rescue the music for the deaf people, expanding their musical ability to the sense of touch, so that sensory stimuli are transmitted by a bracelet attached to the user. The device has a control of tone and intensity, which allows adjustment of these properties in order to provide the best sensitivity to the user. At the end of the development of equipment, I held a series of tests with 22 hearing impaired of different ages, seeking to understand how these stimuli were received for the various musical features. It was found that 80% of those who participated in the tests had an excellent perception of semitones for differentiation, while the remaining ones have some kind of residual hearing. This indicates that those with a more profound deafness also have greater tactile sensitivity. Since deaf people could understand notes with low and high frequencies, as well as the implementation of several notes simultaneously, I might conclude, along with a qualitative analysis, the deaf people can perceive musical qualities such as melody, rhythm and harmony. Thus, the device may be not only a form of entertainment, but an innovative and useful instrument to the musical development of the hearing impaired.

GUIDING LIGHT: EMPLOYING DISTORTED MAGNETIC FIELD FOR EFFECTIVE INDOOR NAVIGATION
Faisal Mohammed Alshaker
Najd National Schools, Riyadh, SAUDI ARABIA

This paper sheds light on the improvement for the positioning aspect of the Guiding Light project, which is a new indoor positioning system. Guiding Light uses magnetic fields for navigation by analyzing the distortion of magnetic fields inside buildings. Since distortion of magnetic fields inside buildings results in fingerprints, this paper describes the process of detecting these fingerprints, using various technologies such as 3-Axis Compass with Algorithms, Arduino Micro-controllers, and Bluetooth, and employing them for positioning indoors. Results show that this technology is functional and accurate.<br><br>To start building the positioning technology for Guiding Light, we built a preliminary localization device, which consists of LEGO towers that have sensors for magnetic field detection on top. The sensor, 3-Axis Compass with Algorithms, is an e-compass with heading and tilt outputs with low voltage operations. All collected data were sent via blue-tooth to a computer and saved to create a database, or a Reference Map. In the engineering procedures, we created table with two measuring towers and carried out the experiment in an actual building environment. On the third floor, we scanned the west corridor. The results have shown an initial success platform using this technology, with error range of ~0.5 ft.<br><br><br>Ultimately, the handheld device that has 3-Axis Compass with Algorithms and programs written in Java projects guiding information and directions on different surfaces. Some controversial points are explained in this paper. For indoor navigation, the employment of magnetic fields is one of the best technologies yet developed.

STABILITY ANALYSIS OF CONTROL ALGORITHMS
Keegan Robert Mann
San Pasqual High, Escondido, CA

Both a robotics project and an experiment comparing the effectiveness and tuning process of different control algorithms, I investigated a system in which a robot balances on a rolling cylinder turned on its side. It is also possible to set the robot to a target velocity which it will follow. Control algorithms like the ones I have tested are used in everything from household heaters to high performance aircraft and are becoming ever more important as precise positioning and control is necessary in fields such as robotics.<br><br>Before starting, I wrote a program in Java which simulates the system and the algorithms involved in stabilizing it. This program served as a starting point illustrating that the control algorithms work. Building the robot has involved building sensors and circuitry from scratch including an encoder and a motor controller. In addition, I wrote the firmware for the robot myself in C and devised ways for measuring the stability of the system which included writing a program in Java to collect and display data.<br><br>The project uses both an accelerometer and a gyro for orientation data and a wheel encoder to get accurate wheel velocity data. These sensors together provide the microcontroller on which the controller code runs with enough data to balance effectively. In my project I provide statistics on the performance of different control algorithms and their effect on stability and different tuning methods as they apply to my system.

CLIMBING ROBOTS
Ashley Micheala Painter
Homeschool, Verona, MO

I designed and built a vertical pole climbing robot that could be deployed from a larger robot. Then I did field testing at a robotics competition and recorded data about it and other pole climbing robots to determine whether the number of wheels made a difference in the speed and reliability. To analyze the data recorded during field tests I set a first place score as a value of four, second place as a value of three, third place as two, fourth as one, and a failed attempt as zero. I then used the mean and the standard deviation of this data to determine that the most reliable and fastest pole climbing robot out of the data collected was the two wheeled design #525. However after a T test there was not a difference between the pooled results of two+ wheeled pole climbing robots versus one wheeled pole climbing robots. Possible uses for this research include the space elevator, robots for inspecting telephone poles, and robots for repairing cell phone towers.

WAVE ENERGY: USING A POINT ABSORBER MECHANISM
Matthew T. Haynes
School Without Walls Senior High School, Washington, DC

The goal of this project is to build a scale version of a point absorber generator. This generator will be tested to show that it is a feasible and practical option. The generator that I designed and constructed relies on the upward motion of waves for energy. A buoy is attached to a string that is connected to an axle. When the buoy rises and falls, the axle is spun. Meanwhile there is another string attached to the axle in the opposite direction, which is connected to a hanging mass, which turn the axle back the other way. On either end of the axle are two one-way gears, which only engage as the axle rotates a certain direction. These are engaged with a series of other gears so that another axle is always turning the same direction. This is then attached to a motor. I was able to construct the generator. I also got the second axle to spin one way continuously forming an oscillating motion. The generator can generate electricity on a small scale. If this same generator was built on a larger scale, then it could be used as a source of renewable energy. My results support my engineering goal because I was successful with my construction. I was able to construct a working scale model of my design that shows this is a feasible possibility. It shows that with funding, I would be able to construct a larger version can be used in the real world.

This project is to determine how temperature fluctuations affect the efficacy of photovoltaic cells. This project is significant because if fluctuating temperatures from high down to cool temperatures affect the performance of photovoltaic cells to perform under typical conditions, then it shows which environments will photovoltaic technology become inefficient. I predicted that temperature fluctuations from high to low will permanently damage the photovoltaic cells, rendering it unable to produce the same amount of power as it could. To test, I placed a photovoltaic array directly beneath a constant light source, while attached to a voltmeter, ammeter, and infrared thermometer. With the light source also being the source of heat, I increased the temperature of the cells to various levels, then quickly cooled it down back to the control temperature to measure how the temperature fluctuations affected the photovoltaic cells. The data collected shows that as the temperature of the photovoltaic cell fluctuated between greater temperatures, the efficiency of the photovoltaic cell at the control temperature, prior to experimentation, decreased. My results are consistent with my hypothesis because as the temperature exposure increases, the greater the reduction in the expected output of the photovoltaic cells. The findings are significant because it shows that photovoltaic cells become less cost efficient each time the temperature fluctuates from high to low.

ACOUSTIC IMAGING USING OPTIMIZED BEAMFORMING TECHNIQUES
Andrew Beekman Feldman
Manalapan High School, Englishtown, NJ

An acoustic array system for imaging far-field sound sources is designed, built, and optimized for the needs of users. Future acoustic arrays must use inexpensive equipment to accurately locate sound sources in real time. To reduce cost, the single multiplexed analog-to-digital converter (ADC) on an ATmega2560 microcontroller was used in place of a more expensive multi-channel device to sample the microphones simultaneously. Bandpass sampling techniques were used to compensate for the resulting aliasing. Considerable effort went toward sampling microphones at the highest possible frequency and optimizing serial data transfer. On a laptop, a fast Fourier transform gave a matrix of complex values representing incident amplitude and phase at each microphone. A delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming algorithm produced an image convolved with the array’s directivity pattern. The CLEAN deconvolution algorithm, originally used in radio astronomy, was used to remove the directivity pattern and provide direction-of-arrival (DOA) measurements. A four-by-four square of evenly-spaced electret microphones was found to produce a desirable directivity pattern and avoid spatial aliasing. The sixteen microphones are amplified and filtered to control noise and temporal aliasing. The array was tested in an environment of artificial narrowband sound sources at known angles and over a wide frequency range. Frequency estimates given by the bandpass sampling algorithm were extremely close to the known frequency values. The array gave precise DOA measurements for single sources; performance for multiple sources varied. Analysis of experimental results was used to evaluate the algorithms used and direct future research.

INDOOR GROUND MANIFOLD TRACKING THROUGH LOW-COST STEREOSCOPY
Christopher Stephen Nielsen
Homeschool, Calgary, Alberta, CANADA

Optical systems for three-dimensional position and orientation tracking of a mobile platform are typically limited due to cost and computational complexity. In this project, an inexpensive webcam stereoscopic system was developed to estimate and track the state variables describing the position and orientation of a mobile platform as it was arbitrarily moved above a ground surface. This was achieved through real time processing of feature points on the ground surface manifold observed by the stereoscopic vision system collocated with the platform. An algorithmic tracking loop was implemented to optimize the estimate of each state variable simultaneously through the minimization of alignment error between feature points back projected onto a virtual representation of the ground manifold. Using the estimated state variables, the trajectory of the mobile platform was estimated through a frame by frame integration of the differential motion. Additionally, an automated calibration procedure was devised to compensate for webcam geometric misalignment and image plane distortion. Utilizing linear and radial testing, the state variable estimates were shown to be highly accurate with a position error on the order of 0.2% and an orientation angle error on the order of 0.01 radians. As the developed system is cost effective, accurate and operates in real time, there are a multitude of possible applications including enhanced guidance systems for mobile robotics and independent indoor navigation for the visually impaired.

WINDS OF CHANGE: A NOVEL APPROACH TO WIND ELECTRICITY GENERATION SYSTEMS FOR DEVELOPING REGIONS
Megan Kathleen Schlorff
Sacred Heart High School, Walkerton, Ontario, CANADA

Currently, 1.6 billion people in developing countries have no access to electricity despite its ability to alleviate poverty. The world’s population will increase along with the demand for electricity. This project developed an enclosed system that harnesses wind to generate electricity in areas that are currently unable to support large and technologically advanced infrastructure. Bernoulli’s Principle was utilized by modeling the system’s air intake as a funnel to increase the velocity of the wind reaching the blades. The intake had a rounded circumference to induce an aerofoil effect that created lower pressure outside the system, helping to draw the air through. Various prototypes were created before constructing the system that was tested for power generation both in a controlled environment and outdoors. The system was economical to construct due to the variety of repurposed building materials. It was lightweight (6.8 kg) and could be easily shipped to various regions of the world where it could be assembled with ease. The maximum amount of power generated was 1.6x10-1 W with a wind speed of 9.8 m/s. The system has the ability to charge batteries which would be useful for items such as cell phones in these regions. The generator was assembled from a direct current motor, bearings, and a pulley system. Two generators were connected in series in later prototypes, and this has generated higher amounts of power. This low cost, low maintenance electricity generation system has the ability to create independent and thriving communities around the world.

TRAFFIC LIGHTS FUZZY CONTROLLER
Zeyu Liu
Sir Winston Churchill High School, Calgary, Alberta, CANADA

Using LED lights as vehicles and traffic lights, a PLC controlled four-way single lane intersection simulator and a traffic light fuzzy controller were successfully designed, built and tested. <br><br>The prototyped fuzzy controller development consisted of three stages: fuzzification, processing, and defuzzification. Fuzzification involved the scaling and mapping of input variables (number of vehicles) to fuzzy sets. Two inputs represented current phase queue and next phase queue; considering vehicles in all four directions made the controller more efficient. The processing stage simulated human reasoning process to deduce the fuzzy output by using Mamdani’s fuzzy inference method. Applying IF-THEN rules, the fuzzy controller controlled traffic like a human operator. The defuzzification stage converted fuzzy output values to control signals by employing the height method. All calculations were completed offline using Visual C++.<br><br>Using Ladder logic, a series of programs were programmed and executed. Six three-hour tests were conducted for both fuzzy and fixed time controllers in both equal and unequal intersections. The test results demonstrated that the fuzzy controller was more efficient than the fixed time controller as it reduced the average waiting time and increased the total number of passing vehicles. <br><br>The fuzzy controller indicated positive potential for elimination of traffic congestion and achieved real time traffic control by mimicking human intelligence. Using IF-THEN rules rather than complicated equations, it reduces the system complexity and can easily be utilized in current traffic infrastructure. This system can reduce traffic congestion and CO2 emissions which will have significant social, economic, and environmental impacts.

ELECTRONIC SUNFLOWER: SUN TRACKER
Enddy Yavier Gonzalez Figueroa
Natividad Rodriguez Gonzalez, Arroyo, PUERTO RICO

Conventional solar panels don’t move and they present certain difficulties absorbing sun rays when the apparent sun movement occurs. What is the difference in voltage between a set of still solar panels and the prototype Sun Tracker? The hypothesis was that there is a significant voltage difference between moving and non-moving panels and it increases with time.<br><br>The Sun Tracker is a prototype robotic device that was made to keep a constant alignment of the solar panels with the sun while the “apparent sun movement” occurs. This prototype works like a sunflower moving constantly towards the sun which helps to increase its efficiency. The gathered voltage was used to charge a cellphone but, it could also be used to charge other small electronic devices or batteries. The experimentation was held during four periods of two hours each, for both moving and non-moving panels. The data was collected using a voltage data logging system.<br><br>The gathered data evidenced that there was a significant 27% drop in voltage using the still panels during 120 minutes. This is a real big difference when it’s necessary to keep a constant voltage. The data analysis also evidenced that the voltage produced by the panels decreased with time when the solar panels were still, while moving panels didn’t have radical changes in voltage. It can be concluded that the hypothesis was correct.

AUTOMATED CYCLE HELMET
Roxanne Adele Pollard
Chipping Sodbury School, Bristol, UNITED KINGDOM

I have designed and manufactured a novel safety helmet for cyclists. The helmet’s main function is to promote safer cycling and also act as an incentive for more people to be attracted to cycling which leads to a more healthy and active lifestyle. <br><br>A red LED situated at the rear of the helmet is light sensitive meaning it automatically illuminates when the sun is setting and light levels are low. The cycle helmet also contains two amber L.E.Ds, situated on either side of the helmet. These lights are contact-sensitive and become active when the rider lightly touches them with a hand, thus allowing the rider to signal a change of direction without taking their hands off from the handle bars for a long period. <br><br>When activated, the amber lights will flash and make a beeping sound - acting as an indicator to announce to car users that the rider is about to change direction. The beeping sound is also a confirmation to the rider that the indicator has been activated. This sound can even be altered to a vibration, making it attractive to people who have a hearing impairment. A theme tune can also be added for the amusement of young riders. <br><br>The intended user group for the cycle helmet is primarily young children who are learning how to cycle. It aids confidence to the child whilst they are learning how to appropriately signal their change of direction whilst cycling, especially at night time.

WATER FOR THE WORLD: DEVELOPING A PORTABLE, SOLAR POWERED DESALINATION UNIT
Ryan Christopher Erickson
Los Alamos High School, Los Alamos, NM

Of all the water on Earth, only 2.5 percent is freshwater. Of that, only 1 percent is readily available for human use. It comes as no surprise then that increasing the freshwater supply is of vital importance, particularly as population continues increasing. The initial intention of this research was the development of a desalination system that solves the current problems of portability, efficiency, and costs. Research demonstrated however, that the system designed actually functioned as a complete water purification system, further increasing the applicability. An evacuated boiling chamber heated by the Sun via a solar reflector causes saltwater to boil at around 120o F. When the saltwater boils, freshwater steam travels to the top of the chamber and condenses on a chilled coil. A vacuum pump then draws the freshwater into a collection jar. The automation of the complete system through a programmable microprocessor allows the system to run with minimal user interaction. A pre-filter using sand and activated Carbon removes chemical contaminants, while an ultraviolet pen removes bacteria. Testing the system involved placing metered heat lamps around the system to simulate varying amounts of sunlight. A comparison of the solar input to freshwater yield revealed that the prototype is capable of producing over 2 liters per day. Further water quality tests determined that the process successfully removes harmful contaminants, and that the resulting water is free of salt, bacteria, and metals. These results are very encouraging, and demonstrate the potential of this system as a practical water purifier.

BOOSTING CENTRAL HEAT / AIR CONDITIONING EFFICIENCY THROUGH EVAPORATIVE COOLING SUPPLEMENTATION
Trevor Kidder Monroe
Chain of Lakes Collegiate High School, Winter Haven, FL

This project examines whether the efficiency of a residential central heat/air conditioning system could be increased through the use of evaporative cooling supplementation when applied to the outside condenser unit. Greater cooling ability of the outside refrigerant condenser coils should provide increased cooling efficiency at the air handler inside the home. This can be measured by comparing the “cooling temperature differential” of the indoor air handler inlet air temperature, versus the air handler outlet air temperatures, with and without the experiment running.<br><br> Three evaporative cooling panels were designed, built, and installed on the outside of an A/C condenser, along with a water pump system. The system collected and recycled A/C condensate drain water for use as a primary water supply. Water was pumped to the cooling evaporative cooling panels, which then drained back to the water collection box to be recycled. The condenser cooling fan drew air through the wet cooling media panels, greatly assisting in cooling the condenser refrigerant coils.<br><br> Data was collected for a period of 23 testing days noting such variables as outside and inside air temperature, humidity, and condenser exhaust temperature changes. With the experiment running, indoor air handler cooling temperature differential improved by an average of -16.64 degrees Celsius (1.62 degrees Fahrenheit), making for an average of 7% increase in cooling efficiency, compared to normal A/C operation.<br><br> I conclude that A/C condenser evaporative cooling supplementation is indeed very effective at improving air conditioning efficiency, by helping the A/C condenser cooler the refrigerant liquid better.

CONSTRUCTION OF A FEASIBLE EINSTEIN: SZILARD ABSORPTION REFRIGERATION SYSTEM
Spencer Wilson
Colquitt County High School, Moultrie, GA

Refrigeration is essential to life in developed countries. In third-world countries, the lack of refrigeration is a key factor in its undeveloped state. Were there an inexpensive, reliable, alternative form of refrigeration available, life in third-world countries would be wholly improved. The purpose of this project is to resurrect a nearly century-old, single pressure absorption refrigeration system patented by Albert Einstein and Leo Szilard that was never officially put into production. The “Einstein Refrigeration Cycle” works using butane as the refrigerant, ammonia as the pressure equalizing inert fluid, and water as the absorbing fluid in four main vessels: the reservoir, generator, condenser, and evaporator (Mejbri, 2006). The experimenter researched cycle design from different sources and designed a compact form of the cycle. Materials used are based on availability and cost; 2” steel pipe for the vessels, connected with ¼” steel brake line. Five trials were completed with different prototypes up to the time of this writing. Trial 4 was very stable in respect to temperature and temperature difference between the hot-side and cold side, with a duration of 200 minutes. The mean cold-side temperature was 12.96C and a standard deviation of 5.57C, with a mean hot-side temperature of 88C with a standard deviation of 13.9C. The final prototype, 4, reached a peak efficiency of 25% in this trial, based on the Carnot efficiency formula, 1- Tc/Th. However, these trials are only the start to testing a new design. The current prototypes cannot be treated as a finished product; improvements (including insulation and addition of heat-sinks) are currently being made to further the design and construct a viable alternative refrigeration system for third world applications.

MICROWAVE EFFICIENCY
Douglas Monroe Jones
Glynn Academy High School, Brunswick, GA

Slow and/or uneven heating of food in microwave ovens often wastes time, and even more often, results in both under and over cooked food. This project focuses on microwave efficiency.<br><br> It is hypothesized that if there are cold spots and hot spots in a microwave oven, then avoiding the cold spots should allow rapid and consistent heating.<br><br> First, to show that there are high and low energy fields in microwaves, light bulbs were inserted in a Styrofoam platform and placed on a turntable in a microwave. After turning the microwave on, the lights blinked on and off showing that there are high and low energy fields in microwaves. Second, to show where hot and cold spots are in a microwave, thermal imaging paper was placed on wet paper towels. Cold and hot spots on both a still and revolving platform were demonstrated by heat-activated ink in the thermal imaging paper. Different rates of microwave heating for cold spots and hot spots were measured using cups of water. Using two microwave ovens, four trials with lights, eight trials with imaging paper, and twenty trials with water temperatures were preformed.<br><br> The lights blinking on and off at different intensities, the revolving and standing thermal image ink patterns, and the fact that cups of water placed in hot spots got hot consistently faster than water in cold spots, all prove my hypothesis is correct. There are hot and cold spots in microwaves. Avoiding cold spots will allow more rapid and consistent heating.

SOLAR CELL ENHANCEMENT WITH NATURAL DYE AND SURFACE ROUGHNESS
Andrew Christian Woods
Mayo High School for Math, Science and Technology, Darlington, SC

Solar cells have a very clean method of creating energy from light. However, they are very costly and not very efficient (SolarCompanies.com, 2011). Pokeberries are found all over the world and their dye was found to increase the current of solar cells when placed on them (Wake Forest University, 2010). In addition, roughing up the surface of the cell was also found to increase the current (Vieru, 2010). In this experiment a solar cell, with three types of covers over the cell, was placed on a Petri Dish with a constant light shining through creating a current measured by a Digital Multimeter. The two experimental groups were dyed rough plastic and clear rough plastic covering with the control being a clear plastic covering. <br><br>After the experiment, the ANOVA analyzed data showed that the P-Value was less than 0.0001 which meant the null hypothesis was rejected. The difference of means between groups showed that the control group with the plastic covering had the highest mean and current reading. Thus, there was no indication of higher current with dyed or rough plastic covering.

NANOPHOTONICS FOR SOLAR CELL APPLICATIONS
Zachary Robert Brewer
duPont Manual Magnet High School, Louisville, KY

Over the past several decades, an increasing amount of CO2 gas has been released into the atmosphere, primarily for the purpose of creating energy. The goal of this project was to develop gratings that, when applied to solar cells, would increase their absorbance, and thus their efficiency enough that they could begin replacing CO2 emitting energy sources. Additionally, this project sought to accomplish this goal through the implementation of computer modeling because it is much faster and cheaper than traditional experimentation. To do this, the code for computer modeling of these gratings was written for GD-Calc which was installed on top of Matlab. The permittivity data for the active component, MDMO-PPV, was then added to the program. After that, the experimental data was compared with the simulation data to ensure that they concurred. If they did, then it would mean that the simulation program was working. Finally, different geometries were tested until the one with the most absorbance was found. This project determined the characteristics for the grating with the most absorbance as well as the effect that the change in certain characteristics had. In general, the height and period were directly proportional to the absorbance while the width had little to no effect.

My goal was to design and manufacture a cost efficient autonomous car that improves safety on the road by preventing accidents. My current phase consisted on the creation of hardware and software which showed a 3D virtual mapping with the used of 2D sensors and a monocular camera. The major modules that have been developed to feed the virtual mapping are: Marginal Protection, Line Detection and Road Guidance, Obstacle Detection and Avoidance, Pattern Recognition, Behavior Generation, and Mission Planning.<br><br>I took a remote controlled car, removed the transmitter and connected an array of infra-red sensors and a LIDAR. A Firewire camera with a variable lens was used to capture the images and send to the Processing Cluster. All the onboard hardware was connected to a Tablet PC. The computer cluster that is made up of four HP DL360 Servers, running Windows Server 2003 R2, was used to do the image processing and calculate the Steering angle and Speed and send them to the remote car via wireless. <br><br>My project creates a vehicle that can drive autonomously from point A to point B without pre-knowledge of the environment, recognizing and avoiding obstacles with a cost of only couple of thousand of dollars. The system was able to use sensor and camera data to create a virtual map. After over 20,000 lines of programming, I not only designed and implemented the hardware and software for this project, but also a safer and more convenient approach to eliminating traffics jams and accidents.

Colorimeters are instruments that use different wavelengths of light to analyze a substance, and they are mainly used for finding the concentration of a substance. These devices could potentially do much more and cost much less, so the goal of this project was to create an affordable, compact colorimeter that could be used to accurately identify and analyze liquids.<br><br> <br><br>A colorimeter was designed and constructed using eight PWM brightness controlled LEDs of different wavelengths, two phototransistors (to accurately detect light both passing through and deflected by the substance), and a microcontroller programmed to interface with a computer through a USB port. It shines each LED through the unknown solution and determines what it is by comparing the readings to those in an internal sample library.<br><br> <br><br>It was tested with many substances, scanning them ten times in a random order. This included colored substances as well as eight clear substances. Out of 160 trials, it only missed two for 98.75% accuracy. The factors causing this small error were identified for improvements in upcoming versions. Scratches in the plastic vials could deflect light in different ways to skew readings, and the vials were loosely fitted. In future versions glass vials and a secure vial holder will be used.<br><br> <br><br>With additions to the program, the colorimeter could easily be modified to look for other aspects of a substance, such as concentration. This prototype can lead to an accurate yet affordable colorimeter ideal for schools, labs, airports, and testing water in developing countries.

AN ADSORPTION CHILLER PROTOTYPE FOR OBTAINING GREEN REFRIGERATION FROM SOLAR HEATING
Robert Huntington Verkuil
Roy C. Ketcham High School, Wappingers Falls, NY

Solar adsorption refrigeration is an emerging technology that can reduce our dependency on fossil fuels for cooling needs. The required thermal energy is obtained directly from the sun and there are no moving parts or toxic chemicals. The purpose of this project was to design and build a small solar adsorption chiller prototype for studying this promising technology.<br><br>The chiller prototype used activated carbon and ethanol as the adsorbent/adsorbate pair. A modular design was used for ease of experimentation. In order to make some performance predictions for the chiller prototype, experimental jigs were built for measuring the heat of ethanol vaporization, the heat of desorption for ethanol adsorbed on the activated carbon, and the mass of ethanol vapor uptake by the activated carbon. The prototype chiller yielded reproducible results, largely due to improved vacuum integrity/control via a homemade Pirani vacuum gauge that was incorporated into the system. The modeling work for the behavior of the chiller prototype was consistent with the following experimental results: (1) short heating times (10-15 minutes) for activated carbon regeneration were possible, (2)an approximately direct proportionality between useful cooling time and ethanol uptake capacity was observed in a comparison between the two carbon brands, and (3)a temperature of approximately zero degrees centigrade could be reached.

SUNCONDITIONING II
Juan Carlos Gonzalez
Fleming Island High School, Orange Park, FL

We, as Americans, use 2/3 of our energy for space conditioning. Now, imagine if we effectively eliminated about 1/3 of that energy. That was the concept behind my project; use renewable energy in order to create space conditioning. Thus, Sunconditioning was born.<br><br> Sunconditioning is based off the main idea we can use the sun, a pump, and some minor physics to create a suction pressure required at the evaporation phase of the refrigeration cycle. The physics involved is the venturi principle; which states that if a motive is pumped through a small nozzle, then expanded, suction will be created. My system taps that suction to create refrigeration and absorb the heat. Then the motive will bond with the refrigerant, and solar heat will be used to separate the refrigerant from the motive.<br><br> After conceptually deeming the method feasible, and running tests on the venturi ejector; this year’s approach was to construct a small scale test rig, using the Sunconditioning blueprints as a reference. The chosen refrigerant was ammonia due to its low boiling point and high efficiency. <br><br> The results of the project were substantial, the system achieved refrigeration at 7.2⁰C of suction. Although that was short of the expected 0 C, this was the first build and future changes will be made to ensure better results. The conclusion is that the system does create refrigeration. It marks a future for Sunconditioning. But changes such as a larger pump and larger expansion of the venturi valve will be needed to continue.

MUSICAL SCORE INTERPRETER TO FACILITATE TEACHING MUSIC TO PEOPLE WITH VISUAL IMPAIRMENT BY USING VIBRATIONS
Jose Miguel Gonzalez-Arias, Nicole Alexandra Mena-Mora, 
Colegio Tecnico Profesional Don Bosco, San Jose, COSTA RICA

How can we make it possible for people with visual disabilities to learn and appreciate music in a simple way?<br><br> This device is a new method created to support people with visual impairment when learning music allowing them to correct performance. <br><br> Wearing the vibration vest (called “INNOVI” in the Spanish abbreviation) a visually impaired person will be able to interpret notes with the help of strategically placed vibrators, by being able to associate the location of the vibration with a specific note on the musical scale. The person is also taught to interpret the musical note during all of the time that the vibrator is active. <br><br> Current music teaching methods for the visually impaired are good, but only provide the option of touching the paper score, memorize it and then interpret it on the instrument. This creative idea improves on this method by providing a second option: when using the vest, the person will be able to feel or “read” the score on their back as they interpret it on their instrument, through electronic signals that send out the previously programmed score. The comfort of the vest gives the person 100% hands free movement eliminating any problems when playing their musical instrument. They only have to concentrate on where the vibrators are placed and perform a particular action.<br><br> The goal of this project is that by frequent use the user will become accustomed to recognizing the musical notes, until they are able to interpret longer and more complex scores.

Abstract：To welcome the coming 3D era, this project provides a solution of three-dimensional wireless positioning, tracking and virtual control based on TOA, further, we build up a complete three-dimensional positioning and virtual control system (PVCS), which adopts infrared ray as reference signal and through the time of ultrasound arriving at three receivers to set up a data model, then combined with the moving direction to realize human-computer interaction in real time. In order to improve the system's stability, we optimize the self-adaptive gain amplifier circuits, driver circuits for ultrasound and infrared ray respectively and design the corresponding display software, which will provide technical support for the human-based and naturalized three-dimensional animation, as well as high performance interactive devices of virtual reality systems. The PVCS has the following features: (1) Joint position based on ultrasound and infrared ray, realizing the wireless transmission of the reference signal; (2) Optimize the self-adaptive gain control circuit to improve the stability of the ultrasound and expand the positioning scope; (3) Emit the positioning signals at interval, which make the PVCS owes the superiority of low cost, low power consumption; (4) Not only can directly draw a variety of three-dimensional graphics and achieve three-dimensional motion tracking of the roller coaster, but also can realize three-dimensional control to virtual and real objects. Compared with the existing positioning systems based on electromagnetic and optical signals, the designed PVCS has the advantages of high accuracy, fast response, low cost and so on.

DESIGN OF A TOILET WATER SAVING DEVICE
Sebastian Tangarife, Daniel Andres Villa, 
Colegio Divino Salvador, Medellin, Antioquia, COLOMBIA

This project is the result of the search for an inexpensive device to help save water in common toilets used in Colombia. The initial idea came from the search of the element that accounts for the most daily water consumption in households. We successfully designed a device consisting of a spring and a stainless steel rod placed in the toilet tank. The consumption of one of these common toilets in Colombia is 15 liters per flush; our research confirmed that this water is not needed, and the toilet can work pretty well with 5 to 6 liters. Our device takes only 5.1 liters of water and is saving 9.9 liters if used properly. The materials used to build this device are very cheap so they can be acquired by people with low incomes, which allows for all type of families to install it at home. This device is intended to generate savings in each household at least 600 liters per month when the toilet is used at least twice a day. The water saved by this device would be used for other purposes if needed, to benefit other people who do not possess this vital resource.

Buena High School, Sierra Vista, AZ

The generator designed and built by our team came as a result of experimentation on all of the variables used to create an electric charge through magnetism. The purpose of our research is to discover new methods of creating power. The frame of the generator is made of Plexiglas because it is durable and non conductive. The turbine is an aluminum rod with a diameter of one-quarter inch because of its low density and non magnetic properties. The turbine is also freely suspended by 1 ½ inch neodymium magnets placed on both ends. By positioning neodymium magnets with the same polarities beneath those found on the rod the turbine is able to levitate and spin with extremely low friction. <br><br> The motor which rotates the turbine is made of a lightweight wooden block. The block is wrapped on both axes by two separate lengths of copper wire. Both series of copper coils are connected to two photovoltaic (solar) cells; four total, one glued to each face of the block. When a light source hits the cells, the copper produces a magnetic field which is pushed by a magnet of the same polarity placed below the block, rotating the turbine. <br><br> The alternator, which is where the charge is produced, is Plexiglas wrapped in a single 500 foot piece of thin, insolated copper wire. Within the coils is a cylindrical neodymium magnet magnetized through the diameter. This allows a reversing of the polarities when the turbine spins and in turn creates electricity.

FABRICATION AND IMPACT OPTIMIZATION OF ANGULAR AND HYDROSTATIC BODY ARMOR
Steven Donald Gillen, Atif Javed, 
Fairfax High School, Fairfax, VA

As our world’s offensive military technologies continue to thrive, so too must our defensive technologies to protect lives. Integrating angular geometry to body armor used by the military and law enforcement will outperform current designs in stopping ammunition, reducing kinetic energy transfer, and protecting the wearer. Several designs were engineered and by applying physical principles, stress analyses, and compression and oscillation theory, a final optimized design was fabricated for real-world testing. Hydrostatic, or water-filled, angular armor plates were designed and tested in the same manner, leading to the production of flat, angular, and hydrostatic chest plates of equal weight. The designs used steel rather than ceramics after comparing the viability of testing and their advantages and disadvantages. Fashioning the angular armor to maximize the bullet’s vector alteration resulting in the dispersal of a substantial amount of kinetic energy, reveal its potential to outperform current armors. The experimenters tested 15 rounds of 9 different ammunitions, fired from a constant distance, against the different plate types backed by modeling clay, and noted their significantly different effects in clay and armor penetration and impact area. After contrasting these incredible differences in millimeters using calipers, the data was verified with statistics testing and further physical theory. The project showed that the hydrostatic outperformed the angular design which reduced the damage and energy transfer far more effectively than the current flat technology using the same weight, amount, and type of steel. The design could even be adapted to anything requiring lightweight, multi-hit ballistic or IED protection even helmets, vehicles, or tanks.

FLEXIBLE WOODEN WHEEL
Peter Smida, Lukas Sakmar, 
Stredna Odborna Skola Drevarska, Spisska Nova Ves, Kosicky, SLOVAKIA

This work comprises the design of a flexible wooden wheel, which can dampen impacts during journeys over uneven ground. This wheel does not need any normal suspension components, because the actual absorption of the impacts takes place in the middle of the wheel. It is made from a central plywood hub, wood-laminate spokes and a wood-laminate outer frame. <br><br>The actual principle of springing the flexible wooden wheel is based on the replacement of normal fixed spokes with wood-laminate spokes in the required spring shape. The actual flexibility is a result of the forces acting upon on the individual wood-laminate spokes of the wheel. When traveling over uneven ground, pressure is created on the spokes which are in the lower part under the hub, and at the same time tension is created in the spokes which are above the hub.<br><br>When a force acts upon a spoke, it flexes, and when the force ceases to act, the spoke returns to its original shape.<br><br>The wheel can be made in any sizes, which means that it can be used in different situations. It can be used for example on a bicycle or wheelchair. On bicycles it would replace the suspension of the bicycles, whereas on wheelchairs it would ensure comfort for the users. It can also by used on coaches and wagons.

SMART GRID STRUCTURE AND GENERATION PATTERNS TO MINIMIZE LOSS AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
Manting Lao, Kevin Yuh, 
Upper Arlington High School, Columbus, OH

As energy prices increase and energy production causes increasingly harmful environmental impact, efficiency in power production, transmission and distribution, and consumption is critical. Two important steps are to minimize losses through transmission and to take advantage of the hallmark of a “smart grid”: distributed generation, the widespread production of power by typical consumers. This project’s first engineering goal was to design a program to analyze power flow, loss, and carbon dioxide emissions and provides both numerical output and a visual representation using OpenGL. To do so, the program reads datasets corresponding to nodes (generators and loads), their connecting lines, and positions on the screen, and solved for the optimal power flow solution using Decoupled Power Flow, an adaptation of the Newton-Raphson method. It then solved for the loss in each line using an adaptation of the power loss equation, and found the total loss by summing the upper triangular half of the matrix. It then found how the losses and total power consumption translated into carbon dioxide emissions, assuming 35% efficiency for coal power plants. The second goal was to determine to what extent certain grid structure and amount of distributed generation affect losses. Eight 101-node systems that contained a main generator were constructed, which correspond to different grid wiring structures and different amounts of distributed generation. Testing verified that certain grid structures are highly favorable in minimizing losses, distributed generation can significantly minimize losses, and that the program achieved the engineering goals. Possible future steps include larger-scale testing.

IMPROVING CAR EQUIPMENTS
Tala J.A Abuhelal, Abeer M.K Rabee, 
Abudees Secondary Girls' School, Abudees, Jerusalem Suburbs, PALESTINE

The majority of car jacks used nowadays are the mechanical ones. Such car jacks are not very easy to use and take a lot of time. The problem with existing electromechanical car jacks is their high prices and that they are manufactured from row material which contributes to more environmental pollution. This problem demanded the creation of a new device that is low on cost, efficient, easy to use, and at the same time pays consideration to the environment. The idea of the Recycled Electromechanical Car Jacks was developed after a period of scientific research and study. The device uses recycled material like mechanical parts from old dismantled cars which makes it environmentally friendly in reusing disposed material, and it powers on car electricity through its connection with the car’s electrical cigarette lighter which makes it very convenient and easy to operate. Through the stages of building this device, an automated screwdriver was added to the Recycled Electromechanical Car Jacks which made it even more efficient and made the process of changing tires many times easier, it also has got another device which can get the vibrations between the car and the wheels in order to change this vibrations into energy to reduce the amount of fuel that the car needs.

THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, AND TESTING OF A ROBOTIC DUCT STERILIZATION SYSTEM, YEAR 4
Spencer Steven Tuttle, Dalton Stanley, 
Palm Bay High School, Melbourne, FL

Microbial contamination of air ducts, typically referred to as SBS or sick building syndrome, can result in various ailments (which range in severity) in the occupants of the infected building or home. Leaks in duct work provide opportunities for mold and bacteria to enter duct work, as well as increase the cost of running your HVAC. This project sought to design an autonomous robotic system to sterilize duct work using UV-C radiation while simultaneously monitoring various conditions inside of duct work to find leak locations. <br><br> The researcher had four hypotheses; 1. UV-C from the robot will cause a lower number of living mold spores to grow than the control group (no radiation from the robot). 2. The location of mold in the duct work will not effect the number of living mold spores after irradiation. 3. As the UV-C exposure time increases the number of living mold spores will decrease. 4. Pulsating UV-C radiation will result in less living mold spores than non-pulsating UV-C radiation. After experimentation, it was determined that all of the researchers’ hypotheses were accepted.<br><br> In addition, the researchers also had nine engineering goals that were all achieved successfully. 1. A robotic arm on the robot will swab the inside of the duct for mold. 2. The UV-C light will pulsate. 3. The robot will determine its location in ducts. 4. The robot will scale vertical inclines. 5. The chassis will consist of 8 spring compressed legs. 6. The robot will transmit air temperature, humidity, surface temperature, air quality, and location to a receiver. 7. Information will pass through relay boards in the duct work. 8. The robot will have an LED display to confirm each part of the circuit is working. 9. A computer program will be developed to display a scale 3-D map of duct work.

HARVESTING ELECTRICITY THROUGH THE INSTALLATION OF A COST EFFICIENT MINI HYDRO TURBINE INTO THE EXISTING DOMESTIC WATER SUPPLY
Meghan Sakae Fujimoto, Alyssa Braun, Ashley Bonilla
Kauai High School, Lihue, HI

The purpose of this experiment is to determine the feasibility of inserting a mini hydro turbine into the existing domestic waterline between a house and its water meter. A prototype turbine was constructed using a recycled automobile oil pump. After running multiple tests using this turbine, we determined that the overall power output would be 1.3 kWh (Kilowatt Hours) per day. This turbine will save an estimated 474.5 kWh annually. Based on data provided by the Kauai Island Utility Cooperative the average household would save approximately $189.90 annually. This turbine would run on the pressure already supplied in the waterline. The results of this initial investigation are proof of concept. Currently we are exploring alternative design and material options for further study.

O.F.F.E.R. (OIL FIELD FIRE EXTINGUISHING ROBOT): AN OFFER YOU CAN'T REFUSE
Korbin Charles Gilbreath, Kyler Gilbreath, 
Andrews High School, Andrews, TX

The engineering goal was to build a mobile robotic catapult that would aid firefighters in fighting tank battery fires in the oil field. Traditional techniques for extinguishing fires include using water, sandblasting, and various chemicals. Because these fires have an explosive energy source, firefighters are put in danger whenever they are within 150 yards from the fire. The catapult would be able to hit the fire accurately with its fire-extinguishing chemical projectiles from 200 yards ,and would keep firefighters out of harms way and still be able to fight the fire efficiently. Making the catapult into a robot with remote controlled abilities and sensors turned the idea into Oil Field Fire Extinguishing Robot (O.F.F.E.R.). The dry-chemical being used is called “Purple-K” ,which is widely used to extinguish Class B and C fires effectively. It stops the combustion chemical reaction that the fire has with the oil, and Purple-K requires no cleanup. <br><br> The researchers went through several different designs of O.F.F.E.R., some using different methods for driving the arm and ensuring stability. After the field test, it was found that O.F.F.E.R. could handle terrain in the oil fields of West Texas, while still being able to fire accurate shots onto the fire.<br><br> Using O.F.F.E.R. offers a number of benefits. It will save companies money by saving equipment, oil, water, as well as the lives of the firefighters trying to stop the fires. The robot can be used in other firefighting scenarios including chemical, electrical, and forest fires.

This project was originated by the great demand from users who are increasingly seeking security for their homes, we wonder, can we get to find and develop a circuit that satisfies the needs that today our society desperately needs? We used an economic circuit whose aim is to use a cell phone as the main tool to warn the user instantly that there is a problem in his home through a call, no matter how far the distance is and where he is located. From his cell he can activate a system called presence simulator which would simulate the user's presence at home in case there would be committing a problem.<br><br>In the future we plan to implement this system in both cars and motorcycles, also we plan to use at school in which we attended for the computer room for getting security.<br><br> This house system has a function other than as named above, for this reason we must make changes in the circuit.

THE UNTOUCHABLE: A SAFETY FEATURE FOR WORKSHOP MACHINES AND ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES
Shi Ting Pan, Ng Ching Man, Chan Ying

Accidental cuts by rotating blades and moving fans are seldom covered by the media unless fatal injuries are caused. In fact, numerous accidents occur daily at home, school and workplace for using machines even with so-called protective shields of wires. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)* in USA, fatalities from moving machine related incidents accounted for approximately 13% of all industrial accidents. Foreseeing that severe hurt could be avoided if machines are stopped immediately whenever they are touched by an organic substance, we aim at using circuit mechanism to stop machines-related accidents.<br><br>Although the concept of “The Untouchable” is new, the electronics needed for its implementation is not. Available in the market is a touch lamp that is turned on/off by touching its surface. Based on this electronic circuit, a moving machine can be stopped as soon as the capacitance of the shielding mesh is changed due to a direct contact with a foreign object such as a finger. We have experimented with many types of switches, adding relays and on/off selectors for an optimal operation with the right time of response and adequate sensitivity.<br><br>The effectiveness of “The Untouchable” has been validated through in-situ field-tests by installing it in many machines, such as electrical jigsaw, metal cutting lathe, and electric fan. We believe that with adequate resources and further improvements, “The Untouchable” can be adopted as a standard safety feature in all machines and electrical appliances. By then, many domestic and industrial accidents could be avoided.

Chung Yeung Jeremy Ho, Leung Chung Hin, 
Aberdeen Technical School, Hong Kong, HONG KONG

True Voice Color Recognizer (TVCR) is the product of a multi-disciplinary study, a physiological analysis of color perception and a physical application of optical theory in color recognition. This project aims to enable a visually impaired or color-blind person to identify colors. According to World Health Organization, around 5 % of the population suffers from color-blindness. In daily life, the visually impaired and color-blind people often encounter difficulties in making choices when options/signs are coded in colors, as exemplified by typical signs in hospitals requesting patients to follow colored lines to specific departments; and selecting right-colored clothes to attend social functions. These drive us to work on this invention to help them. <br><br>The physiological study on human perception of colors starts with a color wheel that sets out a spectrum of colors. Hundreds of volunteers participated to select on the wheel what they perceived as six common colors. Surprisingly, we found that the number of colors the human eye could differentiate was about 18 only.<br><br>Based on this survey, we developed a palm-sized TVCR to recognize 20 common colors. The microcontroller in the TVCR controls LED to emit red, green and blue light sequentially onto an object. Microcontroller then analyzes the ratio of intensities of lights reflected from the object, matches it with the pre-recorded color bank and names the color via a human voice synthesizer.<br><br>Armed with TVCR, one will become a modern-day Horus, an Egyptian God who lost his sight in a battle but eventually regained his vision.<br><br>The TVCR was tested on visually impaired and found that most common colors were recognized with great accuracy.

Mainly, we have launched three experiments related to those three respects.<br><br> <br><br>Experiment#1<br><br>We have tested two mainstreams of propulsion systems with entirely different thrusters mounting arrangement in order to find out the specifications of which on the first phase experiment. For comparison, we measured the velocity in each parallel motion, angular velocity in each rotational motion as well as electric current and voltage consumed respectively for the sake of calculating the kinetic energy produced using the same electric power in two propulsion systems.<br><br>Experiment#2<br><br>Secondly, considering constant and shift water flow would cause troubles while ROVs desire to stay relatively still for observation, we tended to utilize simply an accelerometer to gauge the intensity of stream flow and steady ROVs in a fixed station by controlling the propellers spinning against the interfering water stream.<br><br>Experiment#3<br><br>Lastly, knowing many accidents during operations are related to tether getting entangled in undersea obstacles, we tried to find out a material having excellent performance of light reflection in water which help us more easily spot and untie the entangled cable while the cable is covered with that material with high light reflection performance. In the experiment, we gauged the illumination of seven potential cloths and paints from our daily necessaries in water to determine the light reflection performance of each.

Mechanical efficiency of a robot with an autonomous program.<br><br>This work aims to compare the mechanical efficiency of a robot designed to perform a mission using an autonomous program with sensors and an autonomous program without sensors.<br><br>Design a mission in which the robot has to travel a given distance within a track and pick up plastic rings, transport them, and deposit them in a strategically placed pole. From the mission designed, construct a robot with metal pieces measuring 46 cm long, 43 cm wide and 41 cm high, 100 RPM motors, and sensors. This robot will work with an autonomous program, one with sensors and another one without sensors. Tests were done with sensors and without sensors to measure the mechanical efficiency of the robot. Three tests were performed for each autonomous program to compare the mechanical efficiency of the robot while performing the designed mission.<br><br>Using the formula for mechanical efficiency, the autonomous program without sensors had an average of 0.0037% of efficiency and the autonomous program with sensors had an average of 0.0047% of efficiency. The autonomous program with sensors worked more efficiently since the robot could make the decisions prepared for it on the program more accurate and it could autocorrect itself. Also, the sensors help the robot to have an idea of where it is in the mission.<br><br>The data obtained support the hypothesis, since the autonomous program with sensors proved to be more efficient than the autonomous program without sensors.

INERTIAL ELECTROSTATIC CONFINEMENT FUSION USING AN ELECTROSTATIC FOCUSING LENS
Demitri Joseph Hopkins, Eric Thomas, Forrest Betton
Merlo Station High School, Beaverton, OR

At first, the purpose of this experiment was to design a functional fusion reactor capable of generating D-D fusion reactions using an electrostatic lens to focus deuterium ions generated from a pointed emitter at a frozen heavy water target. Later on, the purpose was to make a similar reactor but with a hollow cathode to generate deuterium ions, as well as analyze future protective shielding metals with an electron microscope.<br><br> The program SIMION was used to model the lens, chamber, and calculate the dimensions for the design that would maximize ion speed and density. After the dimbensions were designed the lenses were machined at a machine shop. The fusion chamber was hooked up to a vacuum pump with heavy water frozen on the target and a DC generator and voltage divider to put charge onto the lens according to the calculated specifications. The vacuum was manipulated to keep the ion beam stable and the data were recorded using a Geiger counter and a spectrophotometer.<br><br> The result of this project was the successful production of a fusion reactor capable of generating D-D fusion into helium atoms. This was determined based on the readings given from the Geiger counter and the peaks on the spectrophotometer.<br><br> The contribution of this project was the design of a functional fusion reactor, in the pursuit of energy, capable of being easily modified for energy collection and the possibility of elimination of radioactive sludge. The most prevalent contribution is the possibility of clean energy production and collection.

VOICE ACTIVATED ALARM
Jonathan William McEwan, David McCarroll, 
South Eastern Regional College, Bangor, County Down, NORTHERN IRELAND

The impetus for this project was due to two separate accidents that caused injury to both of our grandparent’s. Most current alarm systems are based on pendant operation. Our grandparents both need help with mobility in the home but often forget or cannot get to their pendants in an emergency. A voice recognition system would negate the need for a pendant; as an initial step, a sound activation system was developed as a precursor to specific speech recognition.<br><br>The initial sound recognition circuit used a piezoelectric transducer that, when activated by sound, supplied a small voltage to a transistor which in turn, acting as an amplifier, provided a trigger for a PLC. This trigger output then allowed the PLC to send a text message to a provided cell number by means of a GSM module. Repeated experimentation and testing in the electronics laboratory indicated problems with the consistency of triggering.<br><br>The circuit was modified to use a monostable circuit to set the width of the pulse for the input to the PLC more accurately. Further testing using this circuit provided the required level of consistency. However, when tested in an environment with varying noise levels the system did reveal some limitations with spurious noises activating the alarm periodically. <br><br>The current device demonstrates that a voice activated alarm system is a viable and useful method for assisting the elderly in the case of a fall. The limitations can be overcome with future development plans to include a speech recognition capability.

Shawnalyn Wing Chun Sunagawa, Sara Middendorf, 
Saint Andrew's Priory School, Honolulu, HI

The purpose of this study was to find and investigate the ability to create a completely bladeless wind turbine system. First, we discussed the design of the turbine system. We came up with three possible designs that differed based on different airfoil/wing shapes. We ultimately decided to create a wing that was most similar to an airplane wing design. First we ran a bench test on our tesla motor to obtain data. Through this we were able to decide that we would implement the tesla motor into our turbine design. From there we began to construct our system and decided how the tesla motor would factor into the system. Next, we named our turbine system: Polygonal Airfoil Wind Turbine, PAWT for short. After finishing the construction phase of this project, we field-tested and were able to see the effectiveness of our turbine system. Then we constructed a miniature model to better demonstrate the turbine system when presenting.

Imagine that you are paralyzed. You cannot turn on a computer, let alone move or click a computer mouse. You have an electric wheelchair, but to control it you need to blow into a mouthpiece; however, your breathing is too shallow to use the mouthpiece. You feel helpless and you become deeply depressed. For over 400,000 people, this is their daily life.<br><br> <br><br>My goal was to engineer and construct a complete system of dry brainwave sensors, amplifiers, and interface circuitry to wirelessly control electro-mechanical devices using a person's brainwaves. To do this, I first had to engineer effective dry brainwave sensors and amplifiers. After numerous prototypes, many failures, and 200 sensor experiments and statistical analysis, I engineered and built a dry brainwave sensor that could effectively detect and amplify brainwaves. Second after an additional 120 experiments and statistical analysis, I engineered circuits to filter out artifacts (electrical signals from eye and facial movements). Third, I engineered my electronic circuits to wirelessly transmit a signal to a programmable logic controller, which utilized software I had written to activate electronic devices based upon the brainwave signal detected and processed by my electronic circuits. With the prototype complete wireless brainwave interface system that I had engineered and built, I can turn an electric device on and off simply by thinking about it. This is just the beginning, much more work needs to be done. <br><br>However, imagine again that you are paralyzed, but with a wireless device based upon my science fair project you can via brainwaves utilize a computer, dial a phone, you can even control your electric wheelchair. Can you imagine how this could significantly increase your quality of life?

A NOVEL DESIGN FOR THE ENHANCEMENT OF ANTI-REFLECTION IN CRYSTALLINE PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS
William Yuan
Westview High School, Portland, OR

In this study, conducted at a solar company, a novel design for double-layer anti-reflective coatings (DLARCs) is developed and physical wafers are manufactured, leading to significant improvements in photovoltaic efficiency. A transfer-matrix algorithm was developed to enable quantitative DLARC analysis of multiple film thicknesses and their respective refractive indexes. The new algorithm was implemented into a computer model for numerical simulations. Optimal design parameters were generated for experiments which were carried out to verify model predictions and manufacturability. A total of 15 wafers was manufactured based on model predictions, including DLARCs which were calculated to both outperform and underperform the standard single layer antireflective coating (SLARCs). Physical characterizations were carried out for reflectivity and film thicknesses by use of spectrometry and ellipsometry respectively. The results reveal that the Si3N4 DLARC reduces reflectivity by 15%, or 0.5 mA per square cm over the standard SLARC. More importantly, the effective cost of implementation was found to be negligible. This is extremely significant in a high-volume manufacturing environment and leads to predicted cost savings of nearly $34 million per year. The increase in efficiency along with no associated manufacturing cost provides great opportunities for increased competitiveness in the solar industry.

HELIOCENTRIX: PORTABLE PARABOLIC TROUGH VS. FRESNEL LENS ARRAY
Giancarlo Alberto Barillas
Southwestern Educational Society, Mayaguez, PUERTO RICO

The intention of this research was to compare the effectiveness of two different solar light concentrating apparatus. The basic objective was to boil water efficiently using only solar power. The two apparatus were a track of parabolic troughs and an array of Fresnel lenses. The research and design phase of the experiment identified the need to evaluate portable yet efficient arrangements of these two proven technologies. The effectiveness in harnessing and concentrating solar light towards purposeful use was quantified by measuring each apparatus’ effectiveness in boiling 0.0081 m3 of water (Approximately 2.14 gallons). Key metrics of effectiveness included the change in temperature of the water and the total amount of energy transferred to the water in the two evaluation periods. Basic calculus computations and comparative statistical analysis were used to compare the heating curves for each apparatus and the amount of energy transferred to the water over time. Key design parameters for both apparatus included portability, durability, ease of maintenance, and every day-use suitability. The design phase included revisions to originally defined arrangements. Final experimentation for comparison was done with the designs included herein. Both technologies showed effectiveness heating water however the Parabolic Trough was able to deliver greater energy transfer due to its imperviousness to sun travel. The Fresnel apparatus required constant adjustment which impacted its performance. Improvements in design for both systems would include a way to insulate the water reservoir to prevent heat loss, the incorporation of a solar tracker for Fresnel lens positioning.

The search for new technologies that may assist the individual in his daily life is something that plagues science to various cultures throughout human history. The use of products from this search is a topic well important in to education today in Brazil. In some developed countries this issue has been overcome, since access to technology such as computers and internet at home and at school is common. On the other hand, the Brazilian points to the intensive free solutions, thereby opening a field large enough to spread of low-cost technology. My project focuses primarily show that it is possible to use common materials in our day-to-day and turn it into a low cost equipment to assist in learning subjects such as robotics, electronics, programming and mechanics. Thinking thus, I developed a multipurpose platform that actually it is a small mechanical equipment capable of traveling on various substrates, it can be coupled to various technological devices that will provide diverse academic experiences. The result was presented a project of great mechanical strength and low cost, making it accessible to most students, besides awakening great interest during lessons that were taught using the prototype. My project was built with reused materials, making it cheaper than the conventional kits. During the testing and research, I found an interesting fact: its durability, despite the various tasks implemented and the interest it aroused in the students.

SIMDEB II – DEVICE TO VERIFY THE CARDIAC OUTPUT MEASUREMENT THROUGH THE SWAN-GANZ CATHETER
Caio Francisco Ternus de Abreu
Fundacao Escola Tecnica Liberato Salzano Vieira da Cunha, Novo Hamburgo, Rio Grande do Sul, BRASIL

The engineering goal was to develop a device capable of correctly checking the cardiac output (CO) measurement performed through the Swan-Ganz catheter. Especially, the procedure for verifying the performance of the Swan-Ganz catheter’s thermistor is inaccurate and rudimentary because it is made squeezing with your fingers. Moreover, the current CO simulators are ineffective for not testing the entire measurement system. So, I constructed a device capable to reproduce in real-time the blood temperature changes coming from the thermodilution procedure and provide the temperatures to the catheter’s thermistor before using it inside the patient. The temperature varies quickly through a thermoelectric module connected to a small metal block which performs the thermal interface between the prototype's thermistor and the catheter’s thermistor. A proportional temperature control was developed in PIC microcontroller to stabilize the temperature in 37 degree Celsius. The simulation management is accomplished by computer software connected to the hardware through the RS232 serial port. The comparative and experimental tests of the prototype versus a cardiac monitor has proved that the simulation system reproduces a thermodilution curve and calculates CO value with an accuracy about 0.1 l/min, however more effecient that the current simulators. Furthermore, the hardware price is around 9 times lower than commercial simulators and the computer software contains more hemodynamic parameters for expanding the test conditions. In the future, my project can be applied in hospitals and surgical centers for assisting maintenance technicians and medical staffs to check the Swan-Ganz catheterization equipments in a safer way.

CHAIRTEC is a project designed to people with disabilities (ex: quadriplegia) may have control over your transportation without being helped to move. This project is based on a modified wheelchair motors, directional and brake system, with an onboard computer can capture voice commands and turn them into a function (ex: when people say "throw" the computer will interpret and send data to the engines to be activated and the chair can move).<br><br>In the future, this wheelchair will have a global position system (GPS) in order to provide information of where the user is located to his or her family. One of the key points is the safety and good stability in the system.<br><br>An important point to add is the home support from the user’s family, who through an Internet connection, the family, of the person may obtain technical data of the wheelchair, such as engine temperature, the direction performance, among others. It is also important to note that it will have special security measures such as lights, flaggers and a battery backup in case the battery that powers the engines or the computer will run out of energy.

DON'T FEAR - IT'S SECURE II: INTEGRATION OF NFC DEVICES INTO SECURED RFID NETWORKS
Shayan Jayant Mohanty
Plano Senior High School, Plano, TX

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is used for the purpose of identification and tracking. While RFID is a low-cost solution to many inventory and mass-tracking problems, the deployment of an encrypted RFID system is very expensive due to the large wired infrastructure and the need for significantly more computing power in the central control nodes, and is currently not particularly widespread within society as a whole. Near Field Communication (NFC) is making its way into the mobile market in a big way. Due to the backing of tech giants Nokia, Google, and Apple, NFC technology will be implemented across the board in most all mobile devices ranging from smartphones to tablets come late Q2 of 2012. The proliferation of these devices calls for heightened security, simpler deployment, and universal inclusion of NFC technology into areas of interaction. The purpose of this project was to investigate the viability of a low cost RFID-NFC system that effectively combined the flexibility of wireless technology with the strength of the One Time Pad (OTP) based encryption, along with the proliferation of NFC technology with various implementations in society. The design was based on the concept of individual self-contained and widely distributed NFC nodes communicating with each other over a wireless network utilizing encrypted data. In this system design, each time a tag was registered, both the pad and input were randomly regenerated, further strengthening the system security. This approach to standard OTP encryption significantly increases the total security of the system as a whole.

ENGINEERING AN INEXPENSIVE MOBILE ELECTRIC FIELD MILL TO MEASURE CHANGES IN THE GLOBAL ELECTRIC CIRCUIT WITH THE GOAL OF TRACKING GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE
Taylor Siobhan McCanna
Breck School, Golden Valley, MN

The purpose of my study was to engineer a mobile electric field mill that can be used to track global climate change by measuring the global electric circuit. Since the global electric circuit is powered by cloud-to-ground lightning strikes that increase with rising surface temperatures, measuring the global electric circuit could provide a means to track global climate change. <br><br>To measure changes in the global electric circuit, I designed and engineered a mobile electric field mill from inexpensive, readily available materials that include a 3,000-rpm motor connected to metal conducting sensor and shielding plates, housed in a 10-cm diameter soup can. The final prototype cost $115.20 and weighed 0.50 kilograms, which was within the one-kilogram payload weight limit. I wrote a program, using Arduino software to operate the mobile electric field mill continuously during a two-hour launch on a high-altitude weather balloon. Results from the launch showed that the mobile electric field mill successfully reached 28.04 km and measured atmospheric charge.<br><br> My future plan is to publish instructions on the internet for making the mobile electric field mill with the goal of crowd-sourcing research worldwide to measure changes in the global electric circuit. To date, no one has put such a model on the internet, but since crowd-sourcing on a global basis is the cutting-edge of future research; my hope is that my project will catalyze a global effort to monitor global climate change.

GREEN BOARD
David Miguel Gamero
Academy at the Lakes, Land O' Lakes, FL

The purpose of my experiment was to create a more efficient and easier to produce electronic circuit for displaying the numbers 0 to 9. I achieved this by arranging the components in a grid, and connecting them horizontally and vertically so that the correct LEDs were activated on each button press or external input. I designed the circuit in a spreadsheet as a chart of active and inactive lights with the lights as the columns and the inputs as the rows. Then I used a hot glue gun to attach diodes to a circuit board according to my layouts, and the display components to a second board. I then soldered all the components and the ground wire for both boards. The battery pack was then soldered to the main ground wire and all of the buttons and inputs. The battery pack was then sandwiched between the boards, and all the secondary components were attached with hot glue. My project was successful since all the patterns and numbers of lights were activated correctly, and none were lit incorrectly. This design uses the smallest number of connections to achieve the display, and it is created to be easily integrated into other circuits. It is a universal component that is effective and energy efficient.

LIQUID COOLING TAKEN LITERALLY
Stephen Burgess Hall
Veterans High School, Kathleen, GA

The purpose of this experiment is to analyze if and how a computer system functions when submerged in mineral oil, and to analyze how well the mineral oil solution cools the computer system. The scientist chose to benchmark the computer as follows. The core temperature of the CPU will be logged every three seconds for ten minutes in order to determine a baseline. The computer will be put under a stress test in order to induce maximum heat production, and the core temperature of the CPU will be logged at the same frequency for the same duration of time as the baseline. This will be done before and after the computer is submerged in mineral oil. A final stress test benchmark will be run for five and a half hours while submerged in mineral oil to determine how the system holds up long-term. The collected data shoes that initially, the mineral oil cooled system was approximately ten degrees cooler than it was when it was air cooled. Because of this, there is definitely an advantage to using this method as a cooling solution. However, the stress test that was ran for five and a half hours revealed that over time, the oil collects heat and becomes much hotter than the air cooled system ever was. This problem was solved by adding a radiator to dissipate some of the built up heat into ambient air. As it stands, this appears to be a promising cooling solution.

AUTONOMOUS LEAF VACUUM SHREDDER
Daniel Alfonso Diazdelcastillo
North Point High School for Science, Technology, and Industry, Waldorf, MD

Removing leaves is a problem for some people. A survey showed that removing the leaves is a very tiring and time-consuming task for many, especially for the elderly and the disabled. There are many products on the market to remove the leaves in different ways whether it is manual work with a rake, broom or with mechanical devices such as vacuums, blowers or lawnmowers. The elderly and the disabled are generally not capable to remove the leaves using the various tools on the market. The best method to resolve this problem is to make a device that requires little to no physical input. An Autonomous Leaf Vacuum Shredder (ALVS) was designed by using sonar and touch sensors that work in conjunction with an Arduino algorithm to avoid any obstacles and to thoroughly clean the yard while vacuuming and shredding the leaves into a bag with a shredding ratio of 16 to 1. It was tested to determine the amount of time it takes to clean a selected area, the amount of physical labor and the accuracy of the cleanup. The device was compared to other products on the market. The result showed that in the small area tested, the ALVS was the slowest method compared to raking and blowing the leaves, but it required the least amount of physical interaction and it vacuumed, shredded and bagged the leaves from the ground. This device would help people to save time and money and to avoid pain from removing the leaves.

FINE MOTOR SKILLS USING EEG TECHNOLOGY AND BIOMECHANICAL PROSTHESIS
Easton James LaChappelle
Mancos High School, Mancos, CO

For my project I designed, fabricated and created a fully working robotic arm. I tried to make my arm match the strength and ability of a human arm. I achieved this by studying anatomical drawings and diagrams of the human arm and the physiology. I used geared DC motors to actuate the arm and potentiometers as a feedback system so I can tell where the arm is at all times. The hand is a model I created in a CAD program and was 3d printed using ABS plastic. The hand uses small rubber bands that act as tendons and servo motors to actuate the fingers. I obtained smart car motor drivers to power the shoulder motors and a smaller controller to drive the elbow. I programmed an Arduino microcontroller as the main processor that’s controlled with code based on C which moves the arm. I attached a 7.4v 2200mah Lipo battery to power the arm. I wrote functions to control the arm so I can tell it to do a series of movements with a push of a button. I also connected an EEG headset modified to read the user’s brainwaves and get a focus rate. With the EEG I can control the hand so when the user focuses on an object the hand will close and grasp an object. The arm also has a feedback system using a force sensor and a vibrating motor to give the user a sense of touch.

INFRARED VOID DETECTION IN STAY CABLE BRIDGES
William Frank Prince
Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Lexington, KY

This project focuses on a process that has already been developed that tests bridge cables to determine their structural integrity by using an FLIR infrared camera to photograph the cables. Each cable consists of High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) coating surrounding concrete and steel cables. This method only works because the HDPE is transparent to infrared radiation at certain temperatures and thicknesses. The voids that create problems form in the concrete, and they can allow water to reach the steel cable and erode it. Through this project several factors have been tested to find optimum conditions for each, including temperature, thickness of HDPE, and the angle of the Sun. Tested values are 11 thicknesses from 1/32 of an inch up to 1 inch and at every 5 degree Celsius interval between 20 degrees and 40 degrees. Also lab tests with mock bridge cables using 1/4 inch and 1/8 inch HDPEwere performed with the location of the void known. Preliminary lab results show that ease of detection increases as temperature increases and thickness decreases and that voids are much easier to detect in sun as opposed to shade. The next variable to be tested is the effect of the angle of the Sun in relation to the bridge cable to determine optimum testing times for field tests.

AN ALTERNATIVE OPTICAL ANALYZER II
Nicholas Andrew McCoy
Academy of Science and Technology, The Woodlands, TX

The goal of this project was to create an affordable, compact spectrophotometer that would automatically identify and analyze liquids. A spectrophotometer was designed on a computer using CAD software to be made of various parts, and a 3D printer was used to physically construct these parts out of plastic. An incandescent bulb produces light which passes through a narrow slit and hits a prism that separates the wavelengths into a spectrum. Part of the spectrum passes through another slit, through a vial of the solution being analyzed, and onto a phototransistor. A control board directs the entire process and a stepper motor adjusts the angle light strikes the prism to control the final wavelength of light passing through the vial. The board’s program collects data from all wavelengths and sends it to another program on a computer that processes this data to determine what the substance is. It was tested with many liquids, both colored and clear, scanning them ten times each in a random order. Out of 190 trials, it only misidentified five for 97.4% precision. However, the factors that caused this error were identified and a simple redesign with new materials could eliminate practically all error and improve it further. With small additions to the programming, this spectrophotometer could easily be modified to calculate specific concentrations or generate spectrum absorbance graphs. This prototype can lead to an accurate yet affordable device ideal for schools, labs, airports, field testing, and water quality monitoring in developing countries.

WING VORTEXES
Thomas Sterling Walsh
Pensacola High School, Pensacola, FL

The purpose of this experiment was to demonstrate that various winglet designs added to airplane wings increase their efficiency by reducing drag caused from wingtip vortexes. There are many different variations of winglet designs in use today. However, as hypothesized in this experiment, the blended winglet proved the most efficient.<br><br> This experiment was performed by constructing wings scaled down and modeled after a Boeing 767-300 aircraft, constructing a wind tunnel and placing different wings and winglets in the wind tunnel. The various wing efficiencies were demonstrated in the wind tunnel using yarn attached at the wingtip, observing and photographing the yarn’s movements, the greater the yarn moves the greater the vortex and resulting drag.<br><br> After tests were performed and observations made, the vortex created by a standard wing resulted in the greatest movement of the yarn and therefore the greatest drag. Observations demonstrated that the Raked blended winglet had the least yarn movement and therefore most effect on reducing drag. This experiment successfully proved the hypothesis.

THE SILK SPIDER RETURNS: DESIGN OF A CONTROL SYSTEM FOR ROBOTIC LEG MOTION
David Christopher Lofts
Covenant Christian Academy, Huntsville, AL

A control system was designed to direct movement of a robotic leg for a novel octopod robot design. The goal of this study is to develop a leg design that will move eight-legged robots out of the laboratory and into real-world applications involving rugged terrain such as search and rescue, reconnaissance, IED detection, and space exploration, by reducing power consumption and using a unique exoskeleton to protect components from the elements.<br><br>Hardware was designed and built for the control system. An Arduino microprocessor, driver chips, and supporting circuits were built. Next, code was developed for the microprocessor. The robotic leg was modified (from last year’s design) to include angle feedback sensors at each of the three leg joints by replacing hinge pins with potentiometer rods, and it was integrated with the control hardware. Driver circuits were tested prior to leg integration. The control system was tested and data was gathered to characterize error sources. <br><br> Testing showed that the feedback control system functions properly. System error sources were characterized: backlash at the leg joints, scale factor and bias. These errors can be minimized by compensating for them in the microcontroller code. <br><br>The control system is a viable solution for the octopod robot, however it can be improved by using higher torque, slower motors to smooth out the leg motion. The size of the electronics will be reduced, and the leg's mechanical structure will be modified to place the potentiometer angle sensors inside the exoskeleton to meet the design goals.

MEDIEVAL MAECHANICAL MARVEL: THE TREBUCHET
Nathan Andrew Schmitz
Home School, Martinez, GA

The trebuchet was an ancient siege weapon that could throw very large objects weighing several thousands of pounds and destroy fortifications from distances of several hundred yards. For this experiment a model trebuchet was purchased and assembled. Three different experiments were designed. The purpose of the experiments was to examine the mechanical advantage provided by the device and understand the relationship between throwing distance and counterweight loading. One experiment was designed to determine the variability among the three "identical" wooden projectiles provided in the kit and provide a control set for the experiment. The second experiment looked at the relationship between the weight placed in the counterweight box and the projectile throwing distance. And finally, the third experiment used the data from the second experiment to estimate (extrapolate) the maximum range of the model trebuchet with a fully loaded counterweight box. The model trebuchet, standing only 16 inches tall in the firing position was able to consistently and accurately throw the projectiles at different distances depending on the counterweight, achieving a maximum throwing distance in excess of 50 feet. The relationship between counterweight loading and the projectile throwing distance was established by plotting the data and using standard software to fit the data to different equations. A second order equation was found to model the relationship with a high degree of correlation.

WATER FOR THE WORLD: A SOLAR POWERED WATER PURIFICATION SYSTEM
Katherine Lee Zimmerman
Braden River High School, Bradenton, FL

The purpose of the investigation was to design and build a solar powered water purification system. The design included an active solar still with evaporator and condenser stages to increase water productivity, compared to a passive solar still.<br><br>A solar thermal panel was constructed to supply hot water to the system. An evaporator was constructed to provide humid air to a condenser. The condenser was constructed to circulate cooling water which condensed humid air and provided fresh water condensate. A circulating fan and air flow sensor were connected between the evaporator and condenser to circulate air through the system. Temperature, humidity, air flow and water flow sensors were used to monitor the operating conditions. All sensor measurements were taken using an EMANT300 Data Acquisition system and software developed by the investigator. <br><br>Two different experimental configurations were used to circulate water through the thermal panel and to cool the condenser stage. Water production efficiencies for each of the two setups were 16.1 percent and 30.3 percent, respectively. When the results were compared to a passive solar still’s water production rate, it was found that configuration number one had nearly identical production rates, and that configuration number two had production rates at least 22 percent greater than either configuration one or the typical passive solar still. The results from the two configuration tests showed that between 2 and 4 liters per day and between 3 and 6.4 liters per day, respectively, could be produced, depending on the time of year.

RF PROPERTIES OF STRUCTURED THIN FILM LAYERS ON GLASS: REALIZATION OF INNOVATIVE ANTENNAS
Linn Bieske
Goetheschule Ilmenau, Ilmenau, Thuringia, GERMANY

Thermal insulation windows are economic and environmentally friendly. They are applied in modern buildings and vehicles to reduce thermal losses and decrease costs for heating or air condition. But these thermal insulation windows have an immense disadvantage: The electrically conductive thin film layer, which guarantees the thermal insulation, causes major problems for radio propagation and data transmission of cell phones, wireless telephones, navigation devices or computers. Life without these wireless gadgets is scarcely imaginable and sufficient radio signal strength of the communication networks at any operating site is required. Therefore an appropriate compromise between thermal insulation and radio coverage must be found. <br><br>Thin film layers on flat glass have been investigated concerning their RF-properties, in order to create a frequency selective RF-transmission characteristic by surface structuring. Slits of only a few millimeters in width are sufficient and do not affect the thermal insulation values.<br><br>Additionally the already existing electrically conductive layer can be used as a transparent antenna. So various thin film layer antennas have been designed, simulated and prototypes have been built. Evidence has been provided that these thin film layer antennas can be applied in practice. A comparison between thin film antennas and alternative antenna concepts is set out and various opportunities how to integrate antennas in thermal insulation windows are presented.<br><br>The results can improve radio propagation in buildings and reduce the transmission power of mobile devices. Therewith energy consumption and exposure to electro smog will decrease; furthermore the limited radio frequencies can be used more effectively.

Lucas Juergens
Christian-Gymnasium Hermannsburg, Hermannsburg, GERMANY

The aim of the project is to build a low-priced and user-friendly multichannel analyser (MCA) for gamma spectroscopy. The MCA will be operated with a scintillation counter with an attached high voltage power supply. This setup provides short voltage pulses whose amplitudes are proportional to the energy of the arrived gamma quant. The MCA has to capture this voltage value and to create a rate distribution or rather an energy spectrum of the radiation source with which a unknown radioisotope can be identified.<br><br>The MCA consists of three main components: 1) analog circuit; 2) digital circuit; 3) touch screen.<br><br>The analog circuit recognizes the pulse and holds the voltage value of the tip using a sample-and-hold IC. The micro-controller of the digital circuit digitizes this value and resets the analog circuit, so that a new pulse can be received. The digital circuit is also responsible for controlling the touch panel, on which the active measurement is shown in real-time. With the touch panel measurements can be controlled, saved and various parameters be set.<br><br>The device can be connected to a computer and the software enables a transmission of the measurement data and the management of the measurement process.<br><br>To test the construction, measurements with different gamma radiation sources were performed and evaluated. It was found that the constructed MCA provides accurate measurement results.

SELFMADE COMPUTER CONTROLLED FIBER WINDING MACHINE
Philipp Peter
Schulzentrum des Sekundarbereichs II Tech. Bildungszentrum Bremen Mitte, Bremen, GERMANY

This project is the result of building a low coast machine to produce composite fiber tubes easily and clean at home. After the second construction, it became obvious that this self-made machine made similar products like the composite industries. The first prototype of this machine was built with the impressions in the internet. But the machine didn´t work at first. After this the second machine was built. This machine worked and so the first carbon tube was made. Testing the machine one can notice that the machine has a big engineering problem. In the production process fibers getting a resin injection and were put by the machine on the core-tube. The biggest problem is the mechanic part which soaks the fiber with resin. The composite industries are using bowls of metal. The fibers run through the resin-filled bowl. After this the fibers must be pressed to have the right resin/fiber ratio. One of the biggest problems is the dirt from the resin on the machine after work. The problem was solved with a party cup. The industries wash that dirt away with acetone, I just have to wait for the hardening process. After that I just can scratch the residuals away. The third machine makes perfect composite parts and is very easy to handle. Controlled with a graphical system the machine can produce every part you wish. All in all, this project has shown that a self-made machine could be cheaper, more economical and environmental friendlier than an industrial one.

DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF A FRACTAL ANTENNA FOR FREE OTA TV
Sarah Elizabeth Van Sickle
Satellite High School, Satellite Beach, FL

In difficult economic times, people can reduce their expenses by eliminating the cost of satellite or cable television (TV) and switching to free over the air (OTA) TV. This project focused on modeling, designing, building and testing inexpensive fractal antennas that can be used to receive OTA TV. It also compared the performance of the fractal antennas to the Wonder Antenna, a typical log-periodic dipole array (LPDA) style TV antenna sold in stores.<br><br> Fractal antennas take their names from geometric fractal forms. They have space-filling properties that lead to their miniature form, multiband properties, and simple construction. They have been used in cell phones and military applications with great success. Their appeal in this application is their small size and multiband nature.<br><br> First and Second Iteration Koch fractal antennas were modeled using professional ANSYS HFSS 13.0 software. Element models, S plots, Z plots and 3D electromagnetic field plots were generated. Then fractal antennas were built and their resonance points analyzed using an Agilent Network Analyzer. The performance of the fractal antennas were compared against the Wonder Antenna. The OTA TV signal quality data showed that the multiband property of the fractal antennas allowed VHF and UHF station reception, while the Wonder Antenna only received VHF stations. The signal quality was generally higher for the Wonder Antenna, but both fractal and Wonder Antennas received 13 to 14 local stations with acceptable signal quality.

ELECTRICITY-INDEPENDENT, LIFE-SAVING HIGH-RISE BUILDING EMERGENCY EVACUATOR
Andriy Sytnyk
Netishyn Education Complex “General Secondary Education School of I-II Stages & Lyceum”, Netishyn, Khmelnytskyi, UKRAINE

This project addresses the pressing issue of emergency escape from high-rise buildings using a very cost-effective elevator requiring no electricity to operate. It allows to save human lives in case of fires, power outages and other emergencies.<br><br>Among analyzed emergency rescue systems, fire ladders cannot reach above 16th floor, aren’t mobile enough, and are expensive to produce; individual rescue devices require additional skills and physical training, and elevators, although seeming feasible due to their constant presence in the building, may become unusable due to power outages and getting filled with smoke in case of fire.<br><br>This project presents a concept of a purely mechanical elevator requiring no electricity to be built outside of a building’s walls to avoid smoke. Its principle of operation is as follows: in its initial state, the cabin is located in its highest position. When people enter the cabin, increasing its total weight, it starts descending. First, it accelerates, then in the middle of the movement, cabin's speed becomes constant due to the increase of dynamic resistance of a liquid. The cabin’s torque decreases when the cable reaches the conical part of the variator. As a result, both the tangential acceleration of the variator and the speed of the cabin decrease. When all people leave the cabin, it starts ascending towards its initial position. <br><br>The presented emergency rescue system will be simple and reliable, allowing to save numerous human lives in case of fires, earthquakes, power outages and other emergencies, especially in high-rise buildings.

HOLOGRAPHIC LIGHT FILTERING WITH PHOTOVOLTAIC CONCENTRATOR SYSTEMS
Ostin David Zarse
Tucson High Magnet School, Tucson, AZ

The efficiency or power output of photovoltaic solar cells can be increased by maximizing the utilization of light emitted from the sun. Concentrator systems, which increase the current of a cell, are limited by a cell's responsivity. Light that does not meet the bandgap requirements increases the temperature of the solar cells. This temperature gain may decrease a cell's efficiency by approximately 0.5%/°C. Rejecting a certain portion of the electromagnetic spectrum may reduce the temperature gain of solar cells. 5X, 15X, and 30X Fresnel lenses were used in combination with three holographic light filters centered at 950 nm, 1100 nm, and 1200 nm with a 200 nm bandwidth to find the optimal system. Open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Isc), and temperature of these 16 treatments were taken every half minute for 30 minutes. A current-temperature ratio was determined by the change in current over the change in temperature of a treatment compared to the control. The average Isc of the monocrystalline cells was increased by all three lenses. The holographic light filters reduced current by up to 16% due to small secondary reflection peaks. The temperature was decreased by 0.6 °C, 5.7 °C, and 3.4 °C with respect to the 950 nm, 1100 nm, and 1200 nm light filters. The 1100 nm light filter performed best of the other two. Considering the temperature of the cells, the 15X treatments performed best. The holograms were destroyed under the 30X Fresnel lens.

IMBRICATED COMPRESSION SOLAR-AIR STIRLING ENGINE
Cory Nicholson Owan
Catalina Foothills High School, Tucson, AZ

A beta type, Rhombic drive. Stirling engine, was selected for design, fabrication, and evaluation due to the design simplicity and thermodynamic cycle advantage that is offered. The approach involved using the design restrictions established for the maximum overlap of the displacer and piston in advance of the power stroke. Maximum imbrication before the power stroke greatly increases the work performed by the Carnot cycle engine. The Rhombic drive linkage system enables imbrication to occur by careful selection of geometric relations between the eccentricity, link length, and crank radius. These relations maintain sinusoidal variations in the engine such that Schmidt analysis remains valid and accurate. The final engine design employs a rolling diaphragm as the main working volume pressure seal which eliminates sliding friction. The remaining mechanical components utilize rolling anti-friction methods for all interfaces providing very low engine mechanical losses. The prototype engine tested was sized on the availability of off the shelf rolling diaphragms. The engine performance resulted in a 12% design efficiency for the combined thermodynamic cycle and mechanical losses. These results are significant since the working fluid is air functioning under atmospheric conditions at an altitude of 2900 feet, and the engine is functioning near the low range for Low Temperature Differential (LTD) Stirling engines. Increased operating pressure and temperature improve the design efficiency. The results demonstrate that use of imbrication design restrictions, and elimination of sliding losses, provides a viable means of enabling LTD Stirling engines to gain widespread use.

STUDIES OF A MEDIATORLESS MICROBIAL FUEL CELL
Cassandra Joan Schoborg
Notre Dame Academy, Park Hills, KY

The purpose of this experiment was to create a mediator-less microbial fuel cell (MFC). In particular, electricity production was studied with various carbon materials serving as actively aerated cathodes. The carbon materials tested as cathodes were a graphite rod, carbon-weave mesh, carbon conducting paper, and a carbon gel electrode. All cells had a carbon gel electrode embedded in mud from a freshwater pond as the anode. This mud was expected to contain bacteria whose metabolic processes would supply electrons to the anode. The anode was connected by way of a resistor to the cathode compartment where water was aerated to complete the oxidation reaction necessary for voltage production. Voltages and currents were monitored hourly using a computer interface. In the first run, carbon conductive paper was the most successful cathode material. In later runs, cathode differentiation did not lead to high differences in voltage and energy production in the MFCs.

SMARTWATER-INTELLIGENT IRRIGATION MANAGEMENT FOR GREENHOUSE
Zehua Lan
Beijing No. 101 Middle School, Beijing, Beijing, CHINA

Empirical irrigation, i.e. artificial judgment of when to water, and how much to water the crops, is the most laborious but important part of jobs in most greenhouses in Beijing. On one hand, crops need the right water. Too much and too less water are the same harmful. On the other hand, unnecessary irrigation wastes the scarce water resource. In order to make irrigation easy and efficient, I design and implement an intelligent irrigation management system, i.e. SmartWater. In this system, I attack the irrigation task from 3 aspects. 1) sensors deployed to monitor the environment in greenhouse, which eliminates the need for artificial inspection of soil moisture, temperature and related factors; and the monitored data is compared with the critical data about the crops water requirement stored in the soil moisture database – in excess of the critical value, the system will play music/send a SMS to notify the user to irrigate. 2) irrigation history and crop statistics are recorded. Based on the data, irrigation models are parameterized. 3) multiple users can apply the SmartWater system through handy PC, PAD terminals, which support the users to manage and control their own greenhouses and make sharing of irrigation knowledge possible. Exchange of tested good irrigation strategies can multiple the value of this system. Control experiments in a greenhouse of the Beijing 101 Middle School show the value of SmartWater system: 24% less water is required for appropriate irrigation of 5 popular crops in Beijing.

AUTOMATIC CPAP HOSE & MASK WASHER
Andrew Gregory Przyjemski
Governor Mifflin Senior High School, Shillington, PA

Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is now the first treatment for obstructive sleep apnea in most people. A machine that is connected to a tight fitting mask with a hose delivers CPAP. It is recommended that the hose and mask be cleaned daily. The problem is that the cleaning process is manual and there is no efficient and easy way of cleaning the hose and mask. To address the identified problem, a cleaning apparatus capable of cleaning the CPAP hose and mask automatically was built.<br><br>The primary goal for this engineering project was to make the washing of CPAP equipment faster and easier through the use of an automated washer. Experts in the areas of sleep study and appliance repair were consulted to assist in the design of this automated washer. Engineering goals were established to determine the specific functions the automatic washer would have as well as material requirements and dimensions of the washer. Many design revisions were made on paper before an actual prototype was built and tested. Hand versus automatic washing testing was compared by measuring the bacteria colonies that remained after each cleaning process.<br><br>Currently there are no similar inventions. This invention removed the human element from the washing process and consistently, efficiently, and effectively cleaned the hose and mask. Individual time commitment was cut by ten minutes. The invention cleaned the items an average of 52% better than by hand and the sink area was left as clean as before the process started.

INTELLIGENT SELF-ASSEMBLING SYSTEMS USING ROBOTIC CELLS
Holly Catherine Erickson
Los Alamos High School, Los Alamos, NM

Current state of the art manufacturing systems include boxes of raw parts that are assembled by intelligent robots. However, if methods could be discovered to create self-assembling systems using robotic building blocks, manufacturing could be transformed. In biology, cells are the basic building blocks for organisms. By replicating key aspects of the cell in a series of robotic modules, it is hoped that demonstration of more complex, reconfigurable systems can be accomplished. The design for this project is comprised of five goals: power, mobility, software, communication, and attachment. The power system enables the cells to seek power when the battery becomes low and be rapidly, wirelessly re-charged. Mobility focuses on the efficient movement of the robotic cells. Communication involves methods for passing information between the cells. Attachment methods are necessary for the cells to stick together and create one, single purpose larger unit. Software algorithms are used to provide the intelligence behind the robotic system. The idea is that the individual robotic cells cannot complete anything but the most simple of tasks on their own. However, they would be able to accomplish complex tasks when several are attached and operating as a single system. Finally, if these types of systems are going to be practical, the units must be capable of being very small (sugar cube or smaller) and very low cost. This project shows that these types of systems have promise in all of these areas.

DIGITAL LEAF COLOR CHART
Muhammad Luthfi Nurfakhri
Bogor 1st State Senior High School, Bogor, West Java, INDONESIA

A simple, handy and user-friendly Digital Leaf Color Chart (DLCC) for rice crop has been developed. The DLCC calculates automatically in the real-time manner the appropriate amount of nitrogen fertiliser for the current condition of rice crop according to the scanned greenness of rice plant leaves. It is argued that DLCC could avoid excessive application of nitrogen fertiliser which affects adversely the environment and also uneconomical. The instrument consists of phototransistor sensor, LED as light source and microcontroller to embed the calculator and whole system. The calculator is programmed based on the mathematical modelling representing the relation between the electrical outputs and the standard rules following the conventional leaf color chart. Using the experimental data, certain mathematical equation has been found and embedded in the microcontroller using C languange. It has also been shown that the DLCC is working well with satisfactory accuracy.

THE EFFECT OF FRACTAL DESIGN ON ANTENNA CAPABILITY
Stuart James Robertson
Staunton River High School/Roanoke Valley Governor's School, Moneta, VA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the best antenna to use in wireless signal receivers.Thehypothesis was that the Sierpinski Triangle antenna would receive the least interference and the highest minimum voltage.12 gauge copper wire was molded to match the shape of a Sierpinski triangle to three iterations of the pattern and fitted into a space 25cm by 25cm. Some soldering was required.The antenna was then attached to the receiver.This was made using an electronics kit.Aform of radio interferencewas sent through a metal file to the receiver for five seconds.Theminimum strength of the received signal over the five seconds was measured though the use of avoltmeter.This process was repeated twenty times for the Sierpinski Triangle, Koch Cross, the Koch Snowflake, and the radio antenna.The average minimum value for the Koch Cross antenna was 0.132 volts, which was the highest value amongst all four antennas.The Sierpinski antenna had an average minimum value of 0.122 volts, with the Koch Snowflake having an average minimum value of 0.115volts.The lowest average value was the control antenna, with a mean of 0.091volts.Thesevalues reflected that the Koch Cross fractal antenna proved to be the best antenna out of the four. However, further statistical analysis showed that each p-value was above 0.05 for the fractal antennas, so none of the fractal antennas were statistically significant form any of the other fractal antennas.The t-tests showed that each fractal antenna was statistically significant compared to the control.

EFFICIENCY OF SILICON CARBIDE TRANSISTORS
Kayla SueAnn Carpenter
Elko High School, Elko, NV

Silicon is a common semi-conductor used in electronic components. As Silicon carbide manufacturing techniques have advanced, Silicon carbide has become accessible in high temperature electronics. Silicon carbide’s elemental properties make it a great semi-conductor in high temperature settings. I designed a procedural investigation to test a DC-DC converter’s output voltage efficiency values while only changing the semi-conductor in the transistor: Silicon or Silicon carbide. My hypothesis was that a converter with a Silicon carbide transistor would show higher output voltage efficiency values as temperature increased than a converter with a Silicon transistor. I designed a DC-DC converter that stepped down 24 volts to 5 volts for point of load application. I assembled the converter with a Silicon transistor and ran the converter under extreme heat conditions (up to 240ºC) while recording input and output voltages, output current values, and wave form at temperature intervals. I performed the same test with the same converter, only changing the transistor to one with Silicon carbide. I calculated the efficiency using the values I recorded during testing and plotted them in a graph with efficiency as a function of time. The output voltage efficiency values can be determined by the following equation: power out/power in=((volts out)2 /resistor value)/(volts in x current). My results give evidence that Silicon carbide transistors are more efficient than Silicon transistors as temperatures increase.

AUTO-TRACKING SOLAR PANEL
Brayton Davis Miles
Niceville High School, Niceville, FL

With the growing awareness of pollution and global warming, solar electricity is increasingly popular and becoming more affordable every day. With the benefit of producing zero emissions and with the ability to function off-grid, solar cells are clean, dependable, and flexible sources of energy. Unfortunately, most existing solar panels are fixed and therefore not optimally aligned to the sun at all times of the day. If a solar panel rotates to stay perpendicular to the sun at all times of the day then it will collect the maximum amount of sunlight available. Using Fresnel lenses to concentrate the sun, a metal axle to allow rotation, counterweights for balancing, and a pair of opposing bi-metallic thermal actuators to control rotation, the auto-tracking solar panel is designed to stay perpendicular to the sun throughout the day. The auto-tracking solar panel required careful initial alignment of the slits and Fresnel lenses to ensure proper tracking. After deploying the apparatus on a clear, sunny day, the voltage output of tracking and stationary panel configurations were measured. The results demonstrated that an auto-tracking solar panel produces more energy than a fixed solar panel.

Distracted driving has gained significant attention over the past several years. With added technology in people’s busy lives, distractions within the car are causing an increase in accidents, injuries, and deaths. Nearly 20% of all accidents are directly related to distracted driving. In 2009 alone 5,474 people were killed in one of these accidents encouraging me to create a device that could help prevent distracted driving.<br><br> <br><br> A triggering device and a control box are two main components. The trigger can be added to any steering wheel. It consists of two metal strips placed on the right and left half of the wheel. When a loss of hand contact from either metal strip is detected, a time delay located within the control box begins a countdown. Once the time allotted is reached, an alarm sounds until the situation is corrected. I placed the device into my own car and tested it in both highway and city driving. It encouraged me to keep two hands on the steering wheel. My device helps to reduce the risk of a distraction and promotes safe driving with a simple reminder to scan the road ahead.

This project uses the Systems Engineering approach to create a device to recognize an emergency vehicle’s siren and determine the angle of approach. The device aims to improve highway safety by improving driver situational awareness while providing safer and more expeditious movement of emergency vehicles.<br><br> The device uses a computer algorithm to read three microphone signals and determine the acoustical phase shift between them. The orthogonal microphones are separated by a distance optimized for the 500-2500Hz range. The x- and y-directional phase shifts are used to triangulate the angle of approach with demonstrated accuracy within two degrees. <br><br> The sound data is processed using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) to determine the predominant frequencies. Algorithms were developed to detect certain characteristics found in different siren modes. These characteristics are essential for distinguishing the modulation of a siren from other common road noises. The design optimizes variables, including the size and rate of the sample and FFT to track the sound modulation and prevent aliasing.<br><br> A prototype design was evaluated using a certified emergency vehicle. Testing was conducted at distances ranging from 50-300 feet at approach angles from 0-360° at intervals of 45°, with promising results. The current system is being revised to further improve recognition at greater distances and to eliminate false positives.<br><br> This device has applications for all vehicles, but particularly those that have improved sound insulation, limited visibility, or are operated by hearing-impaired drivers. Additionally, this device could be expanded for military use to identify enemy aircraft or tanks.

The purpose of this experiment is to determine the affect of radio transmission by solar winds. The hypothesis stated that the lower frequency range would be affected less tan the higher frequency ranges by solar winds. The hypothesis was proven wrong. The frequencies were affected regardless of the length of the radio transmission.<br><br> A deep vacuum was create during a roughing pump in conjunction with a diffusion pump. A hot cathode vacuum gage was used to measure the extent of vacuum. The vacuum achieved was 73.6 cmHG. Powering the ion electrode and measuring the recency created by the function generator established a baseline frequent, being the control. the sign was created by the function generator was measured with an oscilloscope. Connecting the flyback transformers to the other electrodes was the next step accomplished. The results were very consistent, whether the frequency was increased and decreased in the same degree. A few of the frequencies, 1kHz and 4kHz, were not effected. The 8kHz radio transmission had the largest deviation. The transmissions that were affected were the AM radio transmission, which would mean there would be static or signal loss during a solar flare. Throughout the experimentation, every aspect worked as designed. Further experimentation would require a PLL circuit to be manufactured in order to explore frequencies in a higher range. These ranges would include cell phone, GPSm and other high recency forms of transmissions.

A NOVEL NOTIFICATION AND INTERACTION SYSTEM FOR CAREGIVERS OF INDIVIDUALS WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
Dora Young Chen
Oxford High School, Oxford, MS

The number of people diagnosed with dementia-causing diseases, like Alzheimer’s disease, is rising rapidly. Currently, there is no effective treatment or cure for these diseases. The purpose of the project was to create an aid to improve the quality of life for individuals with Alzheimer’s and their caregivers. In this project, a system was created to instantly notify caregivers with detailed information when the individual may be in an alarming situation. By using various sensors and computer engineering programs, the system was able to automatically begin monitoring the individual when he/she enters the premises. It instantly notifies caregivers via email when it detects a potential danger—unidentified faces and audio disturbances—and places high resolution images and audio files in Dropbox, an online file sharing app, so that caregivers can both see and hear what is happening. In addition, the system detects when the individual leaves the premises and sends out a notification to caregiver. All detection and analysis is done wirelessly, with Bluetooth, radio, and internet linking the parts of the system. The total accuracy in sensing, identifying, and notifying caregivers of alarming situations as well was 100%. This system enables caregivers to stay informed of the individual’s status while handling other responsibilities and allows the individual to maintain a degree of freedom and independence.<br><br>

MICRO-TURBINE ANGLE CONTROLLER
Taylor James Boardman
Delta High School, Delta, UT

This project began with tests to determine the optimum angle of incidence for a wind generator to produce maximum power output. Since most micro-turbine wind generators use tail fins to keep the blades directed into the headwind, it was expected that the maximum output would occur when the nacelle was pointed directly into the wind.<br><br> The optimum angle was tested by placing a small wind generator in front of a large box fan, and while changing the angle the output voltage was measured with a multimeter and recorded for plotting on a graph. Multiple sweeps were done to realign the test angles and to prevent the data from becoming biased. The results showed that the maximum generator output occurred approximately ten degrees offset from the headwind angle. This discovery prompted the need to conduct further research to find the cause and an explanation for the anomaly.<br><br> Extensive investigation serendipitously revealed that the blades of a small wind generator act like a sail on a sailboat. Sailboats can sail faster than true wind speed if the sail is not exactly perpendicular to the down wind. This phenomenon occurs from the vector sum of the true wind force plus the relative wind force acting upon the sail, which equals the apparent wind force.<br><br> The project was expanded to develop a micro-turbine angle controller which measures the true wind angle and rotates the nacelle to the same direction with an adjustable offset angle. Thus, by applying the same technique employed by sailors, the micro-turbine angle controller developed for this project is successful in generating maximum power output utilizing the "Sail Effect".

A PERFECT TIME FOR A PERFECT SPIN
Mrinalini Sugosh
Lakeshore High School, Stevensville, MI

Typically, a helicopter project focuses on engineering aspects of the helicopter, but the paper version focuses on the Paper Type, Wing Height, Body Height, Body Width, Taped Body, Mid Height, Taped Wing, and Wing Width, aspects of physics from which the actual helicopters are created. I studied about; the factors which influence gravity like the weight and factors which influence lift like geometry of the helicopter. A total of eight factors were chosen for experimentation which helped to optimize the flight time and spin. The helicopters were tested in four sequential experiments and the results were analyzed which led to a conclusion on the eight variables. I hypothesized that larger Wings will provide higher lift and adding weights to both the wings and the body will provide the necessary gravity. Body height, width and Mid Height may not be a significant factor. All the factors that will provide maximum lift and gravity will be the best helicopter. Based on the experiment, we can conclude that thin paper type, wing height and body height of 120mm(max), mid height of 10mm(min), body width and wing width of 32mm and 40mm respectively, two paper clips on the body (taped body), and no paper clip on the wings (taped wing) provided the best flight time and spin.

It is commonly known that computers process data in zeros and ones, called binary. Also well known is that computers are always pushed to their limit, with software and hardware constantly redesigned and improved to match the demands. Hardware and software were created to replace the binary number system with a base-four number system to increase speed while lowering power consumption, technology sizes, and costs.<br><br> For any reasonable adoption, these circuits would need to gradually replace binary implementations. The obvious solution was to create a compatibility layer allowing current binary designs to be used inline with quaternary logic. A completely redesigned simulator was created incorporating a binary-quaternary converter, a quaternary-binary converter, and a quaternary Schmidt trigger.<br><br> Earlier versions of the emulator were impractical and have been replaced by a completely redesigned and more efficient program. The new code is based on the architecture of a standard binary processor but substituting quaternary as its numeral base. The design has 256 2-digit memory slots, with four 2-digit registers acting as a calculation medium. This architecture, while cumbersome due to its tiny size, is usable for the fairly minimal implementations for which the original CPU was designed as a testbed for these concepts.<br><br> The current hardware and software are working as expected with a factor of two increase in data throughput. The quaternary circuits ended up virtually identical in physical size to the binary circuits while managing to double the amount of data processed, which was the end goal of the project.

HIKING BOOT BATTERY CHARGER: USING FARADAY INDUCTOR TO GENERATE GREEN ENERGY WHILE WALKING
Braxton Jacob Harris
Weber High School, Pleasant View, UT

Millions of people walk significant distances each day. This project aimed to determine if that motion of walking could be transformed into electricity by wearing a Faraday-type inductor attached to shoes, then used to recharge mobile electronic devices. This research also attempted to determine the optimum design for such a device.<br><br> An "artificial foot" was constructed and attached to an oscilloscope to measure voltage output. A Faraday-type inductor was created by winding coated copper wire around a plastic centrifuge tube, and placing various magnets inside to oscillate inside while attached to the artificial foot. A resistor of known value was soldered into the circuit to determine the energy produced by one swing of the foot. Three aspects of the final inductor design were analyzed: tilt of the inductor, magnet type, and magnet length. <br><br> A computer program was written to evaluate the 1,200 data points for each swing: eliminating noise, excluding minor voltage spikes, and summing the area under both positive and negative voltage curves. <br><br> The data show that a shoe-mounted Faraday-type inductor produces the greatest electrical energy when tilted 20 degrees higher at the toe than the heel, and a neodymium magnet is used, having a length no more than 25% of the total inductor length. Longer tubes and larger magnets produce more electrical energy. The best design produced 17,316J, enough energy to recharge a cell-phone battery with 100,000 steps.<br><br> The practical applications of this device are many: hikers, soldiers, and third world students could enjoy TRULY mobile electronics.

DETERMINING THE EFFECTS OF CONFORMAL ANODES
Skyler Douglas Wiser
Viewmont High School, Bountiful, UT

A crucial component of aerospace engineering is the electroplating of steel structural components with a thin, sacrificial galvanic material. The thickness of this coating must be uniform to allow components to fit within its assembly; an uneven coating would also inhibit the materials ability to sacrificially prevent corrosion. A common practice in the US Air Force is to electroplate a zinc-nickel compound onto a steel part using large, fixed anodes. This process causes irregularities in the thickness of the coating. The two most common irregularities in the coating are insufficient plating in recessed areas, and excessive plating around edges. A proposed solution to the insufficient plating would be to place conformal anodes next to the cathodic part to increase plating in recessed areas. Simulated electroplating tests were used to analytically determine if conformal anodes were a viable solution for increasing plating in recessed areas. Using conformal anodes, plating increased in the recessed areas of a square tube, decreasing the irregularities found in plating without a conformal anode. Physical tests were then performed in those areas where zinc-nickel was plated onto steel square tube to support the simulated tests. <br><br>In addition to validating the proposed solution for insufficient plating in recessed areas experienced in electroplating, observed plating trends suggest that future research could provide a more optimal conformal anode by altering the shape and size of the anode.

DESIGN OF A PROTOTYPE BRAILLE PRINTING SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS RE-USE OF A TEMPLATE SHEET AND DEVELOPMENT OF A MOBILE BRAILLE KEYBOARD WITH INTERNAL MEMORY
Jose Miguel Gonzalez-Arias
Colegio Tecnico Don Bosco, San Jose, COSTA RICA

The current Braille system and its printer do not offer people with visual disabilities the option to reuse paper. Thus, the impossibility of printing several Braille texts on a single sheet results in these being discarded and replaced by new ones, increasing the financial cost for the visually disabled population and contributing to the environmental problem.<br><br>In order to solve this problem, a prototype printer was built that allows using the same sheet several times to print Braille text. A printing system was invented that deposits miniature spheres to form the impression on a reusable sheet. This system uses software developed in a micro-controller to coordinate the motors. The sheet created is a rubber template with holes on the entire page forming the lines of the Braille system. It has a plastic lining allowing the machine to press the miniature spheres made from tin between the materials thus forming the embossing. Once reading is done the spheres are deposited back in the printer and the sheet is ready for a new text. <br><br>A Braille keyboard different from the ones available in the market was also built, with the capacity to store the texts internally, which does not need to be connected to any other external storage device such as computers, telephones, and others. It is easy to transport, affordable and exclusively for writing, thus avoiding the use of two menus to be able to write. It can store up to six files and each file can hold forty pages.

RIIS-ED: PROTOTYPE OF WHEELCHAIR FOR QUADRIPLEGIC PEOPLE CONTROLLED BY NEURAL IMPULSES
Luis Gerardo Leon-Vega

The RIIS-ED Project: Prototype of wheelchair for quadriplegic people controlled by neural impulses is a wheelchair-shaped intelligent robot that incorporates a mechanical arm controlled by neural impulses generated by the movement of the mouth.<br><br>The justification of the research is based on the needs quadriplegic persons have, when they are unable to move their limbs except for the head and face. The project seeks to enable a person with quadriplegia to move, manipulate objects and use a personal computer, using three types of mouth bites (mild bite to select commands, a moderate bite for the execution of the commands, and a hard bite to run the left click of the mouse) to control the robot. The prototype integrates security systems for user’s protection, such as the critical shutoff modules, which disable an error that may exist and that the electronic system cannot correct.<br><br>To develop the prototype, mechanical systems were designed according to the needs of the disabled person, based on observations; electronic systems were created for control, command-processing, and monitoring the prototype. Also, two software applications were developed, which enable the communication between user, computer, and the prototype.

RANDOM AND TEMPORARY TRAFFIC DETECTION SYSTEM FOR CAR PARKS
Yazid F Alawna
Selat Eddher Vocational School, Jenin, PALESTINE

The use of empty and uneven lands located close to city centres and residential areas as unorganized car parks is a widely-occurring phenomenon in Palestine. These parks are often taken advantage of by land owners who rent them out, but when car parks are large and rough, they render the identification of empty spaces a challenging and lengthy process. Furthermore, the process becomes economically inefficient due to a prepaid and time-independent system which requires time and effort from the fees collector and the vehicle driver especially when car parks have multiple entrances and exits. <br><br>The development of the ‘Random and temporary traffic detection system for car parks’ project aims at introducing a solution to organize the operations in temporary and unorganised car parks and control the economic aspect through identifying the number of cars parked throughout the day. <br><br>The system functions through a computer program linked to external sensor circuit located at the entrances and exits of car parks. The computer program receives signals from each entrance and exit, counts entering and exiting cars, and produces a summary of the total number of cars found at every moment on the computer monitor. It also transmits a signal if the car park has available spaces and sends the information on a regular basis to the fees’ collector cell phone. <br><br> At the end of a working day the system generates a comprehensive report to the owner on the total number of cars parked and the fees collected. The system is affordable in limited-resource settings and solves a widely occurring problem among land owners who cannot afford constructing barriers for their lands or defining entrances and exits for temporary parking.

THE EFFECTS OF DIMPLING ON THE LIFT, DRAG, AND REYNOLDS NUMBER OF AIRFOILS DUE TO EARLY TRANSITION OF THE BOUNDARY LAYER FROM LAMINAR TO TURBULENT
Bayley Meichner
Somers High School, Lincolndale, NY

Increased lift is beneficial to aerospace engineering in numerous ways. Increased payloads, shortened takeoff and landing distances, reduced aircraft noise, and lowered stall speeds can all be derived from the effects of improved high-lift airfoil aerodynamics. This study has investigated the effect of introducing golf ball-like dimples on the surface of aluminum airfoils with the purpose of generating low drag, high lift airfoils. <br><br>It is theorized that the dimples will be effective in reducing drag globally while simultaneously maximizing drag locally in order to improve the lift of the airfoils. Experimentally A subsonic wind tunnel was built and five airfoils were tested; one un-dimpled control airfoil and four differently dimpled airfoils: two with an octahedral pattern and two with an icosahedral pattern. Each pattern was comprised of either large or small dimples. The lift and drag were then measured to determine force as a measure of mass change. <br><br>When comparing the un-dimpled airfoil to each of the dimpled ones, the data analysis indicated that the large dimples showed no difference in drag values (P>.05), whereas the small dimples showed less drag (P<.05). The lift data indicated that all dimpled airfoils generated more lift. The larger dimpled airfoils generated greater lift than the smaller dimpled airfoils did, and the large icosahedral pattern airfoil generated the most lift.

SUBTERRANEAN AUTONOMOUS SEARCH AND RESCUE ROBOT
Ashley Micheala Painter
Home School, Verona, MO

The purpose of this project was to engineer a mobile autonomous search and rescue robotics platform. It had to be relatively inexpensive, small, autonomous, and a unique design. Each prototype was designed, built, and then set on a flat surface in-order to determine whether it could work. Ones which worked well would then have to climb over the researcher's hand and other small obstacles. Then they were further refined. The final prototype has two wheels and two legs. Its feet are similar to those of a gecko. This combination of designs grants it stability, agility, and the unique grip of a gecko. In conclusion it is uniquely suited for search and rescue.

COOLING WITHOUT ELECTRICITY: ENGINEERING A NEW REFRIGERATOR
Anish R. Athalye
Massachusetts Academy of Math and Science at WPI, Worcester, MA

There is a need for an effective cooling technology designed for rural areas of developing countries where no electrical energy is available. Currently, there are no inexpensive cooling systems appropriate for the task of refrigeration in these areas. This technology is essential for powering medicine coolers, which are necessary for preserving medicine in these locations.<br><br> In this project, a new cooling system employing adsorption technology has been engineered to function at a small scale. The system achieves a cooling effect by vaporizing water, removing heat energy as latent heat. Water was vaporized by boiling at a low temperature in a vacuum, allowing for rapid cooling to a low temperature (0°C – 20°C). A vacuum was maintained using a desiccant material to adsorb water vapor, preserving low pressure and allowing the system to continue running.<br><br> This new cooling technology proved to function in small-scale proof-of-concept models. Performance scaled well to full-scale medicine cooler prototypes.<br><br> The simple and inexpensive cooling technology has applications in developing countries, in both arid and non-arid regions, allowing for the operation of refrigerators and small air conditioners without electrical input. The technology is also a greener alternative to conventional cooling methods in developed countries.

PHOTOVOLTAICS: NOVEL METHOD FOR PASSIVE TRACKING
Anthony Vladimir Surganov
Albert Grannis Lane Technical College Preparatory High School, Chicago, IL

The purpose of this experiment is to create an efficient passive solar tracker. An active solar tracker follows the sun throughout the day, generally requiring electricity to power the tilting mechanism. The passive tracker will not use any electrical energy to power itself, and instead will rely on a thermal expansion of compressed gas and pneumatic actuators to power the tilting mechanism. The sun-light hitting the tracker causes the gas inside the canisters to go through a thermal reaction and expand, thus creating the pressure needed to push the piston which causes the tracker to tilt.<br><br>The average power output of the passive designed model was 19.65 watts per half hour with a standard deviation of 9.64 watts and the stationary solar panel’s average power output was 13.54 watts per half hour with a standard deviation of 5.97 watts. The designed model was 20.37% more efficient.<br><br>The proposed passive model produced significantly more power, than the stationary panel. However, the experiment was not without errors. During the second trial there was enough statistical evidence to say that there could have been no difference in power output averages. This error could have stemmed from poor construction of the designed model, the overall dynamics of the pneumatic system, and the way the experiment was designed. The poor construction could have resulted in a less than ideal tracking speed and therefore skewing the results. Another variable to have looked at throughout the experiment was the pressure and volume in each canister and how much force was applied to each piston. The design of the experiment should also be changed so that instead of keeping the light source at a direct angle and then rapidly moving it, one would gradually move it across the arcs.

NAVIBOT: PHASE V O.R.C.A.
Matthew Joseph Hummel
Florence High School, Florence, SD

Bioaccumulation is an ever-growing problem contaminating organisms in virtually every major water source. Due to the invasive introduction of nitrogen and phosphorous from products such as lawn and agricultural fertilizers, dangerous species of blue-green algae such as Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii have begun to grow excessively in lakes and rivers. To remedy this problem, the student researcher created a filtration unit to mechanically and chemically remove the algal blooms from both freshwater and saltwater ecosystems.<br><br> To accomplish such a task, the student researcher created a filtration unit solely out of 4” PVC pipe and an activated carbon filter. For housing the electronics, 18 vdc power supply, and providing buoyancy, an EPS (expanded polystyrene) foam body was constructed and sprayed with a urethane resin for enhanced durability. A 9-volt dc propulsion system combined with a servo driven brass rudder was also attached to give the filter mobility. The finished filtration robot was then programmed with a survey-and-report program that utilized a color sensor to track and mark algal bloom locations on the GPS program while it simultaneously filtered the area. To test this, the student researcher used blue and green colored gel sheets to test the color sensor marking program in a pool. Results were then recorded. <br><br> Overall, the O.R.C.A. filter robot was successful in marking and filtering algal blooms. The O.R.C.A. could easily be implemented into all aquatic ecosystems in large quantities due to its cost-effective design and low power requirements.

EMERGENCY CONVULSIVE SEIZURE DETECTION AND NOTIFICATION SYSTEM
Richard Robert Housley
Boston University Academy, Boston, MA

Fifty million people live with seizure disorders worldwide, and thirty percent will continue to have chronic seizures. The United States Center for Disease Control cites a quick and effective response to epileptic attacks to be one of the primary ways to improve the quality of life of, and prevent injury to, those who suffer chronic seizures. Nevertheless, current epilepsy research has largely focused on epilepsy prevention techniques rather than detection and notification systems.<br><br> A convulsive seizure detection and notification system was developed to prevent the dangers associated with convulsive seizures. This system consists of custom designed and fabricated circuitry programmed to detect convulsive seizures and notify emergency personnel. An on-board micro-controller implements a custom seizure detection algorithm that utilizes accelometry data as input, communicates with a GPS receiver, and a cellular modem. The device is programmed to adapt after every seizure to detect future seizures more effectively. A lack of publicly available convulsive seizures accelometry data necessitated the development of a video analysis program to extract such data from videos of patients having seizures. This data was used to validate the detection algorithm.<br><br> After several revisions and miniaturizations, the result of this project is a wearable, highly configurable, and intelligent seizure detection system that alerts emergency personnel of a patient’s location when he/she has a convulsive seizure. To determine the effectiveness of this device a feasibility study was conducted. This study made it apparent that such a device is greatly needed by, and would be beneficial to, the epilepsy community.

AMOUNT OF LIFT GENERATED BY DIFFERENT WING SHAPES
Ian Black
Jefferson County International Baccalaureate, Birmingham, AL

This project was designed to investigate the amount of lift produced by different wing shapes. The central question is how lift changes at different speeds as the ridge line (the thickest portion) of the wing moves closer or farther from the leading edge of that wing. The hypothesis being tested is that as the ridge line moves closer to the leading edge, then lift will increase.<br><br>A device was built that holds one of five wings, each with ridge lines closer or farther away from the leading edge. The device was then secured to a scale, and the baseline weight was established. Then the whole wing assembly was mounted on the roof of a car and driven at different speeds. As air passed over the wing, the scale read a lower number than the baseline. The difference between the weight at speed and the baseline weight was the grams of lift produced.<br><br>When processed, the data showed that in Wings 1-4, lift increased as the ridge line moved closer to the leading edge. However, the data showed that Wing 5 lost lift. This is possibly because the angle the air had to travel over was too steep, which disrupted the laminar flow. This data shows that the hypothesis being tested was supported, up to the point of a near vertical leading surface.

REAL-TIME OPTICAL EGO-MOTION ESTIMATION THROUGH ROBUST PLANAR TRACKING
Christopher Stephen Nielsen
Home School, Calgary, Alberta, CANADA

Scalable sensor technology capable of providing six-degree-of-freedom (6DOF) ego-motion awareness has traditionally been a limitation for autonomous robotic systems. Recently, ego-motion estimation based on optical tracking has partially ameliorated this limitation, however these solutions are subject to high computational complexity and lack of robustness. In this project, a novel solution to the 6DOF ego-motion problem has been developed based on a compound optical sensor consisting of two cameras and a laser projector. This unique sensor allows for the novel partitioning of the 6DOF tracking algorithm into two separate three dimensional (3D) calculations which provides for improved robustness with substantial reduction in computational processing. Furthermore, the system is highly scalable commensurate with a wide range of applications requiring ego-motion tracking. Algorithms were implemented to estimate the planar structure from the singular value decomposition of re-projected 3D point clusters. The affine parameters modeling the differential motion of optical flow feature points were estimated in a least squares solution for trajectory integration. Utilizing a custom built three-axis positioning system for 6DOF trajectory error analysis, the system was shown to provide highly accurate tracking performance with static root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.5 mm and dynamic RMSD of 1 mm per 1 m of trajectory motion. Overall, the developed technology provides real-time 6DOF tracking at a fraction of the cost of an inertial based system of comparable accuracy. The scalability of the proposed system allows for a wide range of applications including navigation for the visually impaired and guidance systems for mobile robotics.

FROM SPARK TO LIGHTNING: INVESTIGATING THE EFFICIENCY OF HAND-BUILT SPARK GAPS IN AN AIR-CORE RESONATING TRANSFORMER
Alexander Martin Dutton
Dutton Homeschool, Davison, MI

In this experiment, the question was: “Which common homemade spark gap design is the most effective at producing an electrical discharge and an electromagnetic field from a Tesla Coil?” The hypothesis was that the spark gap made of the most conductive material and containing the most gaps would provide the longest electrical discharge and greatest electromagnetic field. To test this, a Tesla Coil and all the spark gaps were built from common items. The spark gaps were built using three different materials (stainless steel, brass, and copper) and in three different designs (one, two, and six gaps). Each spark gap was tested in triplicate throughout their working range. The length of the electrical discharge from the discharge terminal was measured using a grounded test rod marked every quarter of an inch. An electromagnetic field sensor, composed of Compact Florescent Light (CFL) bulbs fastened to a board every four inches, was also used to collect data on how far the electromagnetic field stretched (by observing how many light bulbs lit). Using the multitude of data points collected, graphs were made showing the results. The graphs showed that the copper spark gaps consistently produced the longest electrical discharge and the largest electromagnetic field. The copper one-gap spark gap provided the longest discharge, 27 centimeters, and lit five CFL bulbs.

DESIGNING A LOW COST VERSATILE MILITARY ROBOT
Andrew Thor Lingenfelter
Seneca Valley Intermediate High School, Harmony, PA

The goal of this project was to create a low cost, versatile military robot. Designing robots for military use is expensive, and this project seeks to find a better solution. A robot was developed, designed, and built with a list of criteria and goals to measure success: cost, maneuverability, versatility, material availability, portability, and autonomous/RC control. The development of the robot included three major areas: the design and construction of the chassis, the creation and design of the electronics board, and the development of the software for basic operation. The chassis was constructed using readily commercially available materials. The motors, wheels, and batteries were reused from two Razor electric scooters, and the steel for the frame was purchased from local hardware stores. The electronics design included the development of a motor driver circuit and the construction of a control board based around the ATmega2560 microcontroller. A program was written specifically for this robot, in C, to control the basic functions of the robot while not interfering with future programs and applications. The robot has been successfully built and has met all of the previously stated criteria. Due to the steering being accomplished by speed differential of the two powered wheels, maneuverability of the robot is much better than traditional steering methods. The robot, a video of operation, a printout of the program, and pictures of the design process will be displayed on fair day.

DESIGNING A BUOYANCY SUPPORTED VERTICAL AXIS WIND TURBINE
Timothy Samuel Liu
Penn High School, Mishawaka, IN

In order to meet the world’s growing energy demands, various clean energy technologies must be developed. One unique and underexploited technology is the vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT). The purpose of my research was to study the feasibility of supporting a vertical axis wind turbine through buoyancy rather than mechanical means. In addition, I also investigated if such a design could lead to a reduction in frictional torque. I hypothesized that a buoyancy supported vertical axis wind turbine was both feasible and could generate less frictional torque than a conventional turbine. To test my hypothesis, I first designed and built a buoyant VAWT along with a second VAWT supported by conventional methods. I then proceeded to measure the frictional torque of each turbine. To do this, I ran the turbines to their maximum speed before allowing them to decelerate to a stop. As they decelerated, I measured their instantaneous angular velocity until they reached a complete stop. I then analyzed the data in order to quantify each turbine's frictional torque. During testing, I found that a buoyant turbine is a feasible concept. Following data analysis, I also found that the buoyant turbine generated less frictional torque than the conventional turbine, but only at rotational speeds of less than 2.85 rad/sec. By further refining and developing this technology, even greater reductions in frictional torque may be achieved.

Objectives/Goals<br><br>I researched internal combustion engines. Unlike traditional engines, Wankel rotary engines have few moving parts but have other problems.<br><br>Hypothesis: One can architect a rotary internal combustion engine that doesn’t have Wankel rotary engine issues and yet, offers advantages over traditional combustion engines. <br><br>Objective: Eliminate such problems through the following properties:<br><br>•Resilient compression and oil seals design that don’t wear out due to lateral motion of compression seal.<br><br>•Has no more than four moving parts.<br><br>•Combustion forces must be fully aligned with rotation tangential forces.<br><br>•Combustion force must drive the main shaft at 100% duty cycle. <br><br>•Full-cycle engine – one combustion for every cycle vs. one combustion every four cycles.<br><br>•Each combustion must drive the main shaft nearly 300 degrees instead of 180 degrees.<br><br>•No pistons, valves, valve rods, valve springs, camshaft, cams, timing chain, or such moving parts.<br><br>•Eliminate or minimize reverse motion of mechanical parts such as pistons, piston rod, valves and the Wankel core.<br><br>Methods/Materials<br><br>I built a number of prototypes. I machined them using hard steel to 0.008” accuracy. I used some off-the-shelf components such as spark plugs, coil, natural gas carburetor, and fuel injector. <br><br>Results/Conclusion<br><br>My final design was a success, and proved the concept. The design eliminates some of the weaknesses of the Wankel engine; is more efficient and has only four moving parts. To my knowledge, such a rotary engine is novel and has never been built. This engine can be used in many applications.

THE SYNTHESIS OF QUANTUM DOTS FOR APPLICATION IN SOLAR CELL EFFICIENCY
McKenna Pearl Duzac
Oak Grove High School, San Jose, CA

The purpose of my project is to improve the efficiency of solar cells by applying quantum dots. The main quantum dot synthesis I did was that of CdSe quantum dots. The synthesis involved a Selenium precursor and CdO precursor. The CdO precursor was brought to 225 degrees Celsius before adding the Selenium precursor. At this point, 1ml samples were taken at varying time intervals. These samples were then concentrated and mixed with hexanes for the solar cell application. These were proved to be quantum dots by the way that they fluoresce a different color under a UV light.<br><br> For the solar cell application, I cut my conductive glass in to one inch squares before applying a TiO2 slurry. Once the TiO2 slurry was sealed over a Bunsen burner, the hexane quantum dot mixture was pooled on to the TiO2 until the hexanes evaporated, leaving the quantum dots attached to the TiO2. I rubbed graphite on more of the glass squares and mixed up my Iodine mixture. The cells were then created by making a sort of sandwich out of a quantum dot square, a graphite square, and some iodine mixture in between. These were tested under an overhead light for equal testing conditions and compared to a cell that was made the exact same way but without quantum dots.<br><br> This project was a success because not only did I successfully synthesize quantum dots, but my quantum dot solar cells were more efficient than my cell without the quantum dots.

HIGH-POWER, FRICTIONLESS GEAR REDUCTION USING MAGNETIC REPULSION
Jesse Samuel Martin
Elizabethtown Area High School, Elizabethtown, PA

Friction between gears creates heat and noise, which ultimately results in energy and financial losses because it’s an inefficient system. Current gearing problems include the need for lubrication, and jamming. I believe that the magnetic repulsion between two magnetic poles could create enough force to turn gears without physical contact. If magnetic gears could transmit torque and power, they could be used in machines without losing any energy due to friction.<br><br>I wanted to prove that magnets could be used on gears to transmit toque more efficiently. My goal was to create a working model of a simple machine that used magnetic gears to convert the energy from a motor to spinning gears. I decided to use rare-earth Neodymium magnets because they are the strongest type of permanent magnet. I purchased 200 small N35 Neodymium magnets. Because I had so many and wanted to utilize their collective strength, I made cylindrical gears (with a gear ratio of 3:2), which allowed me to have six rows of magnets interacting at once. These cylindrical gears could be built to transmit as much torque as needed by simply making longer cylinders.<br><br>Once I built the machine, I found that it runs very smoothly and is resistant to damage from jamming. The inlaid magnets have minimal air resistance. The lack of physical contact between the gears creates no excess friction and no lubricants are required to prevent overheating, and they shouldn’t ever wear out. I calculated the maximum torque the gears could withstand and found that the magnets are strong enough for practical, real-world applications. I believe these gears would be best suited in the manufacturing industry. Machines that run all day would requite no cooling, lubrication, or extra power consumption due to frictional losses.

It covers a normal range (100Hz-8000Hz) and an extended range up to 20,000Hz and sound levels ranging from 0dB to 120dB in intervals of 10dB. An audiogram which is a plot of threshold values is updated in real time. After both ears are tested, a report is automatically generated for further interpretation by an audiologist. Options during the test include a pulse or continuous test tone and silence or white noise in the ear not being tested. Differentiating enhancements of SoundWorks include hysteresis of threshold, multilingual voice and text prompts, manual mode for spot checks, speech mode, and tinnitus matching mode. This product was developed in C# language on Microsoft Windows 7, debugged, and has been fully validated for complete functionality. Calibration of all sound levels, frequencies, and channels has been completed. This product aims to provide a portable and affordable hearing test capability for under-served economies, volunteer organizations, and frontline military medical units for quick screening of personnel exposed to excessive sound levels. Future plans include medical certification and porting to mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.

3DIMENSIONAL DISPLAY
Melvin Zammit
St. Aloysius College, Birkirkara, MALTA

Nowadays we are witnessing a wave in the development of 3-Dimensional displays. The industry presented us with 3D screens and Televisions. However the Stereoscopic technology used in most of these devices proves rather unnatural to our eyes since they generate a discrepancy between the optical focus and point of interest.<br><br> <br><br>The aim of this project is to build a 3-Dimensional display that can display ‘real’ 3D images. The entire project is based on the idea that if more than one transparent image is put in front of each other, a 3D image forms. Persistence of vision was used to create the needed layers. A line of LEDs was rotated, synchronizing the LEDs on and off with its speed. This gave the illusion of an image in midair and when more than one layer was placed after it a 3D image formed.<br><br>This 3-Dimensional display could have infinite possible applications in the future like 3D telephony, CT scan analysis, 3D games, 3D modelling and other applications that require a realistic volumetric display.

DESIGNING AND BUILDING AN AQUATIC GLIDER FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES
Nathaniel Anderson Hoffman
Hoffman Homeschool, Wenonah, NJ

This project’s goal is to enhance STEM education by mimicking an underwater research glider. This smaller version, suitable for lakes and ponds, will be ideal for middle and high school students.<br><br> A prototype has been created. It is two feet long, with a shell of 4” PVC pipe, and wings of acrylic board. Four “D” batteries power the Droids SAS Multi Interface Board, which executes a program written in C for control. Like its larger counterpart, it functions by adjusting the position of a pump to change its buoyancy. The pump draws water into the nose of the glider, giving it the front end weight necessary to glide toward the bottom. When the programmed time has elapsed, the pump expels the water and the glider rises. This process is aided by a slight forward and backward shift in the position of the battery pack. Wings facilitate forward movement. Steering is accomplished via a servo mounted on the rear exterior with a magnetic coupling for rudder control. The glider receives commands through an XBee module while at the surface. Communication between the compass and the rudder achieves correct heading. Weight was adjusted for balance and to facilitate submersion.<br><br> Design and mode of travel echo an actual research glider, and performance has been tested successfully. The next phase of this project will include the addition of a temperature sensor, remote transmission of data from the glider to the computer, and the ability to respond to sudden deceleration.

THINKING ROBOTICS
Christopher Xavier Miller
Methacton High School, Eagleville, PA

The purpose of this project was to design, program, and construct a robot that could follow the perimeter of an enclosed area and, after computer analysis, return a plot of the perimeter of the tested area. A differential wheel-drive robot was constructed, and consisted of a microcontroller, an ultrasonic rangefinder, and a pair of optical encoders. A wireless transmitter was used to transmit the encoder data from the robot to MATLAB, a data analysis software. Three different control algorithms (an If/Else tree, a P-type, and a PI-type algorithm) were coded and uploaded to the robot’s microcontroller and tested for accuracy. After testing, it was determined that the P-Type algorithm was the most accurate for the system constructed. The data were then analyzed using known equations for differential wheel-drive based robots. After analysis, it was determined that the average error for the collected plots was ± 6.33% per datum. It can be concluded that the robot completed its primary task with low error and relative accuracy. Applications of this research vary from consumer level electronics, such as robotic vacuum cleaners, to high-level military applications, such as mapping unknown facilities in dangerous war-zones.

DOES PVC SIZE LIMIT GEYSER HEIGHT?
Preston Arlan Miller
Sawyer Public School, Sawyer, ND

If the diameter of the polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe is decreased the height of the geyser will increase and if the diameter is increased then the height will decrease. The purpose of this project was to mainly have fun while at the same instance be interesting. The reason for this is because at the beginning of the Science Fair I wanted a project that would include three traits. These three traits are "fun, interesting, and significant." Fun and interesting because it would give myself motivation to complete a successful project and have attention to detail throughout the conduction of the experiment. Significant because it intrigues others to have to want to learn about my project and have a thoroughly joyful experience. Finding these three traits in one particular project was extremely challenging and I found this project should be fun and interesting enough that it will carry me farther through the fair than a project significant yet boring to myself. The procedures included: preparing the coke and mentos, securing the bottle, adding the mentos, observing the height, recording the results, and repeating the procedure. The data concluded that my hypothesis was correct and the 1 inch PVC pipe did not necessarily funnel the liquid as I presumed but correlated along those lines because the diameter of the pipe was the same as the diameter as nozzle of the bottle. I conclude that this project was an amazing experience to endure and follow through because of the proficiency I acquired in planning and improvisation.

FAR-FIELD WIRELESS POWER TRANSMISSION: A NOVEL ENERGY EFFICIENT METHOD FOR PRODUCING SPATIALLY DYNAMIC COHERENT RADIATION IN REAL-TIME
Austin Kingsley Russell
Saint Margaret's Episcopal School, San Juan Capistrano, CA

The global need for access to clean energy is increasing, along with a desire for more efficient methods of power transmission. Wired systems are costly, inefficient, and limit electricity access to a fixed location. Attempts to transmit energy wirelessly such as electrostatic and electrodynamic induction have proven to be highly inefficient, and are only applicable in the near-field. To satisfy the requirements of a 21st century mobile society, an innovative and practical method for wireless power transmission was developed through directed and modulated laser technology. Using an interdisciplinary approach, lasers of various wavelengths were collimated and directed towards a bi-axial Microelectromechanical scanner to allow for dynamic spatial modulation in any direction. This methodology permits electromagnetic radiation to be beamed exclusively at the target in real-time, increasing transmission efficiency by orders of magnitude. Proprietary tracking algorithms utilizing GPS triangulation and Ad-Hoc/WWAN network feedback were developed in order to accurately locate the photovoltaic receiver in 3-dimensional space. Prototype development and testing revealed that the system was able to transmit energy in the far-field at any given distance with up to 97% quantum efficiency and 90% electrical efficiency. This novel method of wireless power transmission creates an opportunity for clean energy to be delivered and accessed by anyone, anywhere in the world.

E-AID: ENABLING ASSISTANCE AND INDEPENDENCE FOR HOME-ALONE ELDERLY
Jonathan Wei Zhi Lee
NUS High School of Mathematics and Science, Singapore, SINGAPORE

A problem associated with the world’s skyrocketing aging population is that most elderly opt to live alone at their own homes. Many of them face serious limitations and challenges living independently due to impaired physical and mental capabilities. In order to alleviate problems with providing essential care and assistance for those home-alone elderly, this project aims to set up the "Enabling Assistance and Independence to Home-Alone Elderly" (e-AID) exploiting advanced sensing, intelligent and reminder technologies. e-AID leverages on a network of heterogeneous sensors and actuators with wireless connectivity which can be readily and easily deployed in any household without intruding into the user’s privacy. Multimodal sensors are used to monitor both situational contexts of subjects and environment within the house at all times. Actuators are installed to control various household appliances according to recognized user contexts. Moreover, they can render appropriate assistance through audio and visual reminders if abnormal or dangerous events are identified. e-AID has a six-layered implementation system comprising sensor data acquisition, feature extraction, data analysis, activity recognition, danger assessment and assistance dispensary. Through statistics, probabilistic analysis as well as rule-based decision making, e-AID will be able to perform human-like thinking processes in order to correctly identify activities of the user. Help can be actively given through positioned actuators when required, facilitating interaction between the system and the user. As e-AID achieved high precision and recall of 94.6% and 94% from preliminary evaluation, e-AID will effectively empower home-alone elderly to live independently while ensuring their continued safety.

PROGRAM RFID TAGS UNDER DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENTS
Yuki Inoue
Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Lexington, KY

RFID, or Radio Frequency Identification, is a newly developed object tracking system that uses radio waves, giving it a tremendous potential to change business. The aim of this project is to figure out which factors affect the RFID programming, so the RFID technology could be implemented onto a laser printer. Because of a laser printer’s unique mechanism, this requires tag programming to be done at a constant speed of at least 35 ppm (pages per minute, approximately 16.3 cm/sec), giving rise to some unique variables not tested in previous RFID-related studies such as the tag velocity and tag orientation. In addition, variables such as air gap, reader input power, tag type, tag uniqueness, and offset distance were tested under both static and dynamic conditions. The results were then analyzed to determine the effect of each factor on the error rate. The air gap, reader power, and velocity affected the error rate uniformly among the tags, with increasing air gap increasing the error rate, increasing reader power decreasing the error rate, and increasing velocity increasing the error rate. The orientation and the offset distance affected tags differently. The results from the static testing suggest that the effect of orientation is strongly tied with the shape of the tags. As for the offset distance, local minima were observed in regions other than the 0mm point. These findings would be of great help in the future creation and commercialization of a laser printer with a robust RFID option.

A simple application of wireless power will be presented during this project. The experiment consists in lighting a led without the use of wires and using a car to charge wirelessly. Electric vehicles offer superior energy efficiency while offering an enormous<br><br>potential for reducing CO2 emissions if the electricity is supplied from a renewable or nuclear source. However, they are presently neither range- nor cost-competitive compared to conventional vehicles, due to limited options for recharging, and expensive energy storage (batteries). This project aims at extending the wireless power transfer to the charging of moving electric vehicles. The success of this program may prove to be a very significant step forward towards the possibility of unlimited range electric mobility.<br><br>By extending the range of electric vehicles, this project will contribute to overcoming a critical limitation of existing electrical vehicles, by offering range at competitive costs.<br><br> For this purpose, the team will use research published on the internet and will get in contact with the professor in charge. <br><br>Wireless power is an exciting new frontier, opening up new possibilities.

STEPFORWARD
Jason Elie Naoufal
Antonine Sisters School Mar Elias, Ghazir, LEBANON

Step forward looks like a normal tile the only difference is that this converts kinetic energy into electric energy using electromagnetic induction. Thousands of people pass through airports, metro stations, malls etc. every day, why should their free energy go to waste in such desperate times? StepForward is but a small step forward in generating alternative energy. It will be placed in well-thought-of locations like entrances of crowded places (ex: bathrooms can be one of the most visited places in a mall), but can also be implemented in road bumps, club floors, stairways and other locations where movement is frequent. The produced energy will then be fed into batteries for various later uses. Under the tile, an adjustable number of coils will be placed and would be chosen upon specific calculations. Connecting many StepForward tiles together appropriately can help increase efficiency as needed (ten tiles in series are connected parallel to another set of ten tiles for example). Moreover, the size of the tile can be manipulated too to fit the place and need. The tile will be stable and non-obstructive or annoying when stepped on. With safety and comfort in mind, I gave StepForward a special design that will insure ease, balance and safety in while walking.

INTELLIGENT SELF-SENSING COMPOSITE STRUCTURES
Abhishek C. Rajadas
McClintock High School, Tempe, AZ

A novel self-sensing material has been developed for damage detection in composite structures. The piezoresistive property of carbon nanotubes was exploited; response to physical changes by changes in the electrical resistance. Highly conductive carbon nanotubes were mixed with epoxy to develop the self-sensing capability. Any physical change will change the location of nanotubes within the epoxy. This will change the resistance, which depends on nanotubes’ proximity to each other. This concept led to the novel self-sensing material, which was used to detect damage in carbon fiber reinforced composite bonded joints. <br><br>A solvent assistance method was used to uniformly disperse multi walled carbon nanotubes in epoxy. The carbon nanotube/epoxy mixture was used to fabricate single-lap composite joint samples which were tested using an Instron test frame. A data acquisition system was used to record the changes in electrical conductivity as the samples were subject to tensile load until failure. The electrical resistance of the joint area was monitored and displayed a clear increase during the loading. The damage was in the form of micro/macro cracks introduced by the shear stress that developed in the joint area. The rate of change of electrical resistance increased with increase in the crack size. <br><br>The results indicate that the novel self-sensing material is sensitive to changes in the local strain field and the changes in electrical resistance can be used to monitor small crack growths that would be otherwise unobservable. The material has the potential to replace external sensors used in structural health monitoring applications.

College Saint-Paul, Varennes, Quebec, CANADA

Ever wish you could verify the status of your slow-cooker or be warned of water infiltration into your home from your office or from a remote beach location? This project is a domotic one, called DomoWeb-II, which uses the Internet as a communication link to sense remote location condition and control electrical devices in a house or an industrial environment. Many domotics systems exist on the market, but most are hard to configure or offer limited connection points and types. I have designed and created an innovative and versatile, multi-sensor/control network that is user friendly using the Atmel Atmega 328 microcontroller and wireless Zigbee topology. The network allows up to 255 devices to be connected, such as home appliances, lights, fans, temperature control, motion sensors and other security devices. The DomoWeb-II was created using three software modules, a PHP and java script internet interface accessible by pc or smart phone, a VB.NET configuration interface, and a firmware coded in C. The final product is an effective remote monitoring and control system that can be used in a residential, educational or industrial environment, easily upgraded and accessed worldwide.

To help Blind people around the world pass through their handicap and have an independent life as any other human being , Electronic locomotion aids were invented to make this task. Unfortunately, These locomotion aids aren’t good enough to cover the blind’s needs, so A new system is proposed to cover all of these needs. Detection In this system is divided into 3 sections: GPS, WPS , and Ultrasonic system, These 3 solutions can mainly cover all the needs of a blind. The communication is going to be a simple sound that averts the blind, telling him where to walk (used in GPS and WPS modes) or where the obstacle is (Ultrasonic detection). This is the whole Idea , but - due to lack of time- I am just going to focus on the ultrasonic-based system with an audio communication block that –at least- can compete with existing devices and at the same time be a platform to continue the idea.<br><br>The locomotion aid system is composed of:<br><br>•A 9v volts battery that serves as the alimentation of the circuit<br><br>•An Ultrasonic detection unit that uses ultrasonic transducers on each side (one on the right , one on the left , one on the front and one for the stairs)<br><br>•A Communication unit that consists in a Wave Player from a SD memory card<br><br>•A microcontroller that will treat all of the information and command the system<br><br>The ultrasonic transducer sends an ultrasonic wave. After going collision with an obstacle the wave returns to the receiver with a low amplitude. As a result , we need to amplify it , then compare the result(V) with a constant voltage (V1). If V>V1 , Then the signal will pass to the microcontroller that is going to send the suitable signal to the WAV player that will play a sound stored in the SD card.

THE DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF A DROP TEST APPARATUS TO EVALUATE VECTOR FORCE DISPERSION IN MATERIALS, SUCH AS A NON-NEWTONIAN FLUID MIXED WITH RECYCLED PAPER AND PLASTIC, PHASE V
Alec Joseph Lamirande, Preston Jackson, 
Cloquet Senior High School, Cloquet, MN

To accurately and precisely measure the dispersion of forces being applied to a bullet proof vest at the time of impact, a drop test apparatus was designed and fabricated. The designed drawings (blueprints) of the drop test apparatus were formed using a computer drafting program. These drawings were printed to scale, placed, and glued onto a Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC) flat stock panel. The parts were than cut out from the flat stock panel and assembled using a commercial PVC adhesive. This device was designed to measure horizontal and vertical vector forces that result when the engineered impact object encounters different materials such as sand and non-Newtonian fluid mixtures. The test was done by releasing the impact device into the impact chamber where dual range force sensors recorded the horizontal and vertical forces created by the object. The force readings were recorded by a hand held data gathering device, which was then attached to a computer via a USB connection. Scatter plots were chosen to illustrate the pattern created by the horizontal and vertical vector forces because they show multiple force data points at the same time. Initial research indicates the drop-test-force-apparatus and sensors were successful at reading vector force data in Newtons(N). Further testing will be done to measure force dispersion by repeating the trials with new materials such as other non-Newtonian fluids and/or mixtures of non-Newtonian fluids with recycled products (paper and plastic), these materials could be used in a bullet proof vest.

ALTERNATIVE KAYAKS: DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, AND DOCUMENTATION
Jiyun Nancy Chang, Jeremy Kuhn, 
Southwest Virginia Governor's School, Pulaski, VA

The goal of this project was to create two hybrid kayaks that are competitive in price and quality to kayaks already on the market. The kayaks would be able to contain pontoons, centerboards, and a sail, while being able to revert back to a normal kayak. Different kayaks and previously built hybrid watercraft were researched. Using existing surf and sea kayak blueprints, the kayaks were modified to contain rudders and to be more stable with sails to keep from heeling over under actual working conditions. The kayaks were built over a period of 6 months. Accessories, such as pontoons and mast, were built after the completion of the hulls. The kayaks were tested using a computer program, Prolines 7, to find the stability, drag, and displacement of the modified kayaks. They were then tested on Claytor Lake in Southwest Virginia. Preliminary testing shows the surf kayak modifications increased drag while stabilizing it at lower heel angles. The sea kayak's stability was increased but less than stability of the surf kayak. Further testing of the prototypes will be done on the lake, while an additional computer program, Hulls, will be used to juxtapose the data simulated by Prolines 7. The focus of this testing will be on the lower speed characteristics of the kayaks, since most recreational uses will be at lower speeds. This projected testing will be completed by April 2012, and recommendations based on findings will be presented thereafter.

AUTONOMOUS ROBOTIC SYSTEM ENGINEERED TO COLLECT AND STERILIZE MICROORGANISMS, REMOVE ALLERGENS, AND MONITOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS WITHIN AIR DUCT SYSTEMS
Spencer Steven Tuttle, Dalton Stanley, Zen Campbell
Palm Bay High School, Melbourne, FL

Sick building syndrome is the result of mold growth in air ducts. Mold emits toxic spores; air carries the spores through the duct and forces them into rooms where they are inhaled by building occupants. The symptoms of infected people in some cases require hospitalization. This project sought to engineer a multitasking autonomous robotic system to sample and kill the microorganisms in ducts, monitor conditions like air temperature, smoke and carbon monoxide. The robot kills the microorganisms with an ultraviolet light, which mutates the cell's DNA. The robot samples using its motorized arm at various locations. The system incorporates: wireless video, air and surface temperature, humidity, carbon monoxide and smoke sensors to determine building safety. <br><br>From the robot, sensor data is sent wirelessly to a computer program developed by the researchers where it is displayed. Based on how far and which direction the robot traveled, the program generates a model of the duct. Video feed is also displayed on the computer. <br><br>To test effectiveness, the researchers placed sealed plates of E.coli, A.niger, and R.stolonifer inside simulated ductwork. The robot irradiated plates in different locations, using pulsing and non-pulsing UV radiation for different amounts of time. It was hypothesized that 1.) As UV-C exposure time increased, living microorganism counts would decrease 2.) There would be no difference between the numbers of microorganisms on plates in different locations 3.) Pulsing radiation would be more effective than non-pulsing. After experimentation, hypotheses 1 and 2 were accepted, 3 was not.

Ingeniero Luis Augusto Huergo, Buenos Aires, ARGENTINA

Our project is focused on the development and building of equipment able to automate and monitor indoor aquaculture facilities, aiming to get a low cost, fully reliable and ready-to-use solution.<br><br>We designed equipment to automate the whole facility, optimize every process that takes place within it and integrate a multi-service monitoring system that allows producers to watch everything that happens, anywhere, anytime. We guarantee animal growth regardless of the climate conditions.<br><br>The monitoring system does the following: sends e-mails every 2 hours with a chart of the last 24 hours of data attached, updates a web service that shows in real time these values and a SCADA that shows the state of the hydraulic system in real time as well. These tools are built in so that the facilities do not have to be supervised constantly.<br><br>The software generates a database that stores all the values. When desired, a producer can review it and study past problems and make corrections to avoid them in the future. If a value reaches a dangerous level, the system is able to warn the producer through SMS.<br><br>At the end of the development, a minimal fully functional facility was built. It is able to maintain the value of temperature at optimal levels, with less than ±1.5% variations and monitor the levels of pH, O2 and more. By maintaining values at optimal levels, the fish do not suffer from any stress and this avoids growth problems.<br><br>This system made raising tropical fish, such as tilapia, possible with minimal human intervention in the City of Buenos Aires where thermal conditions are not appropriated, thus enabling the use of this food source in a country where it has never been explored.

INNOVATIVE APPLICATION OF FACIAL MASK AS MOISTURE SENSOR FOR A LOW COST DEBRIS FLOW WARNING SYSTEM
Zhuoli Feng, Yuan Tian, Jingjing Peng
Chengdu No. 7 High School, Chengdu, Sichuan, CHINA

Debris flows are among the most dangerous natural disasters in regions with mountainous terrain. There are many established ways of predicting debris flows, the most widely-applied method works by monitoring the rainfall in areas with frequent landslides. However, this method is not accurate as rainfall varies greatly even in very near places. As debris flows generally form when the soil becomes saturated and unstable caused by rain, we proposed a novel method by monitoring the soil moisture but the rainfall to predict the debris flows.<br><br> The traditional sensor used for this purpose cannot be deployed due to its large size and high cost. To solve this problem, we experimented with various materials that undergo physical changes in differing moisture levels, and finally settled with a material that is low-cost, environmentally friendly, and readily available: used disposable facial masks. In its final design, our sensor is composed of a self-resonance inductor and a hydrophilic membrane extracted from KE-1300T silicone. The dielectric constant of the membrane changes with the soil moisture, which changes the resonant frequency of the inductor. The sensor is small in size, low in cost, reliable, accurate and can be easily deployed.<br><br> In the hillside, many sensors were deployed in different depths and places. A readout circuit with wireless module connects the sensors, allowing it to send out the infiltration and exfiltration rates of water in real-time, which is use for debris flows prediction. Experimental result showed that the proposed method can provide more accurate debris flow prediction.

MAGNETIC MOTION

Buena High School, Sierra Vista, AZ

Projectile motion is dependent on a projectile’s initial velocity. However, when using a standard speed controller, which controls speed by oscillating an average voltage, the speed at which a physical motor varies. In order to shoot a projectile at a constant distance, we needed to find a way to keep motor speed consistent while the speed controllers supply voltage varies. <br><br>Feedback encoders are known for their ability to provide applicable information in terms of motor speeds, as mentioned by several sources. One such encoder is the Halls Effect Magnetic Encoder. The Hall Effect is the disruption of a magnetic field by introducing a polar object. If you place a magnet close to this sensor, it will either return a value of 0 or 1 to signify the field has changed polarity. <br><br>We attached a polar magnet to our wheel axis and ran the wheel, measuring each revolution with the disturbances signified by the Hall Effect Encoder. Measuring the time for each revolution, we can easily equate a motor velocity. Upon having a velocity, we’ll be able to adjust the motor speed using computer intervention.<br><br>Our results show that as time progressed, our encoder was able to maintain a constant motor speed while the voltage continually dropped. This clearly shows that we were able to adjust the motor speed accordingly and maintain a constant velocity, allowing us to make accurate baskets. From design to implementation, our project was able to turn an inconsistent motor into a precise shooter.

OCULAR COMPUTER INTERFACE: ELECTROOCULOGRAPHIC EYE TRACKING WITH 6DOF HEAD POSITION COMPENSATION
David Alexandre Joseph Campeau, Spencer August Berglund, 
Mayo High School, Rochester, MN

Many people are unable to interact with a computer using a mouse and keyboard because of a physical or neurological disability. Despite serious neurological problems, most individuals retain normal control of eye movements. With appropriate technology, eye movements can be used as the basis for an effective and intuitive interface with a computer or device.<br><br>The goal of our project was to design and build a wireless human computer interface using electrooculography (EOG) based eye tracking with head position compensation that could be used to control a computer or other assistive device. We pursued a wireless, wearable design that was light weight, comfortable, easy to use, inexpensive, and practical for a wide range of users and applications. A highly integrated Texas Instruments ADS1298 low-power analog to digital converter was used to measure biopotential signals produced by eye movement. An Arduino compatible Atmel ATmega328 microprocessor (programmed in C using the Arduino IDE) interfaced the ADS1298 with a computer wirelessly from a printed circuit board attached to a visor. Computer software (Matlab, C#) was written to interpret the signals from the eye to determine eye position. When combined with head tracking compensation, the exact direction of a person’s gaze could be found and used for useful applications, such as controlling a computer mouse.<br><br>With continued development, our EOG-based human computer interface could be useful for individuals who are otherwise unable to control a computer, and could also be used as a control mechanism for assistive devices such as robotic arms or wheelchairs.

SOLAR HEATER FOR RURAL USE FOR UNHEATED HOMES OFF THE GRID
Jacquel Rivers, Arne Joi Nipales, 
Baboquivari High School, Sells, AZ

This science fair project uses a solar heater to take renewable solar energy to heat a 4.3mx4.8mx2.6m (53.6 cubic meter) test-room. The solar heater and accompanying solar photovoltaic arrays are intended for rural off-the-grid homes. Many living on the Tohono O’Odham reservation are poor and without central heating. <br><br> The study is working on the assumption that if we catch enough sunlight to correctly heat up the solar heater, then we can transfer that heated air via solar-powered fans and successfully heat up the test-room. This would allow heating remote rural homes on bitterly cold days, homes not designed for below-freezing weather.<br><br> Our solar heater used a push-pull pair of 12VDC fans. The cold-air-intake (push cold air into the heater) used 0.15m diameter ducting to allow the push-fan to draw in the cold (heavier) air off the floor. The hot-air-return (pull hot air out of our solar heater) ducting went from the pull-fan to the outlet 1m off the floor. Each fan was powered by a single solar array, through its respective voltage regulator, to maximize the air flow. Digital thermometers were used to measured temperature every ten minutes.<br><br> The solar heater heated up the test-room (our high school’s concession stand) to a maximum temperature differential between hot air-in and cold air-out of 23OC (41.4OF) and a maximum ceiling temperature of 35OC (95OF). Our project could turn into a tribal business exploration, which will turn our project into a life-saving enterprise for the Tohono O’Odham Nation.

SAVING MILLIONS WORTH OF GAS USING A NEW WAY TO COOL NATURAL GAS PIPELINE TURBINES
Anastasiya Ivanova, Oleksandra Gulenko, 
Nature-Science Lyceum No. 145, Kiev, UKRAINE

The efficiency of gas turbines used in pipelines to pump natural gas decreases with the increase in air entering turbine temperature, leading to a drastic increase in operation costs in the spring and summer seasons. This project proposes an M-cycle-based gas turbine cooling device that will allow significant gas savings.<br><br>The M-cycle is based on indirect air cooling and successfully used in air conditioners (Idalex, USA). We present an M-cycle-based cooling device for pipeline network gas turbines, in which steam injection into the combustion chamber is used to reduce emission and increase power. A condenser placed after the gas turbine collects water from both injected vapor and combustion gases. After chemical refinement, this water is sent to an exit heat exchanger to be evaporated and used in the combustion chamber. A small portion of refined water is returned to the water contour after operation. To enhance heat and mass transfer, the dimple technology providing lowest pressure drop is used in cooling device passages.<br><br>The project includes a scheme of an actual gas turbine, shows the correlation between thermal efficiency and air inlet temperature, provides thermodynamic analysis of the M-cycle with basic calculations and presents a working cooling device prototype. An economic assessment is also included showing that the proposed system can annually save about 250 million m3 of natural gas, or $100 million worth of natural gas in Ukraine alone.<br><br>This project shows that application of the M-cycle to cool air entering natural gas turbines used in gas pipelines decreases air temperature and increases turbine efficiency, allowing significant savings in natural gas.<br><br>

In the past decades, mankind has suffered many disastrous events, several of which have also had fatal results. Floods,earthquakes, fires, tsunamis, wars, nuclear accídents, terrorist attacks etc. have destroyed many buildings and buried many victims under the debris. So far, the only way to rescue them has been to send human rescue teams to explore the situation and attempt to save lives. However, these teams were threatened by compromised structural integrity, smoke,I chemical fumes present in sites hit by disastrous events, and many of them died during rescue missions. The solution is a robotic rescue system, which is, thanks to it resistance and flexibility, cap able of operation in complicated environment,such as narrow tunnels, contaminated places, buildings with disrupted statics etc.<br><br>The goal of our project was to construct a functional model of a recue robot in small scale, which can be, after and minor software changes, used in a real environment during a rescue mission. A single-board I microcontroller is used to evaluate information obtained from sensor system and navigate in complicated-maze like environments with a lot of obstacles and debris. The main task is however the indication of human victims by usage of temperature sensors capable of tracking human heat. AII information obtained by robot during his mission, including a [ video from on-board camera, will be send to rescue team via wireless technologies in real-time. Thanks to this Iinformation, the rescue team can better plan tier approach and minimize the time spent in dangerous environment.

DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF AN AUTONOMOUS ROBOTIC RECYCLABLES TRANSPORTER (ARRT)
Samantha Blair Santoscoy, Ketki Lele, 
Hathaway Brown, Shaker Heights, OH

Recycling has become an important aspect of modern society as resources become increasingly limited, and along with social changes comes advancements in technology. Two student researchers designed, built, wired, and programmed an Autonomous Robotic Recyclables Transporter, or ARRT, which could autonomously navigate a building and pick up designated recycling bins, thus implementing a more efficient method of recycling. All programming was coded completely by the student researchers and done in Java. A series of waypoints were used to map out the robot’s route and a PID controller was used to keep the robot from straying too far from the determined path. The major physical components for ARRT were thoroughly researched by the students and then implemented after a series of designs. These aspects of ARRT include a dual mechanical arm, pneumatics to operate the arm as well as clamp onto the recycling bins, and Omni wheels to allow greater maneuverability in a high obstacle zone. Additionally, sensors such as encoders attached to the motors and a gyroscope were used to obtain information about the robots position and heading: two integral components of a successful PID controller. ARRT can be easily applied in virtually any building because of its ability to easily adapt to new paths. Also, ARRT can be used for transporting a variety of materials, such as medical or janitorial supplies, as long as they are within the allotted width (two feet). The completion of this project will bring about a more labor and time efficient recycling method.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNETIC ENERGY STORAGE (SMES) SYSTEMS
Steven Donald Gillen, Devon Papanicolas, 
Fairfax High School, Fairfax, VA

The world is going through an energy crisis and there is great need to store energy efficiently. Current methods of storing energy in large quantities have had limited success. However, integrating superconductors into the field of energy storage will result in increased efficiency, versatility, and almost non-existent discharge and charging times. <br><br>Utilizing superconductors to store energy is known as superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES). The engineering of an SMES system requires the use of several aspects including a power conversion system (PCS), superconducting coil, cryostat, and cryogenic cooling. In addition, careful calculations with mechanical stress with the design of coil and energy magnitude were done to verify that the system would operate at safe levels and conditions. Using the manufacture’s designated maximum critical amperage of eighty amperes for the superconductor, the researchers used the formula E=LI2 to approximate 50 kilojoules of stored energy in the electromagnetic field.<br><br> A thyristor based PCS was used, with a single stage cryostat using liquid nitrogen as the coolant to maintain cryogenic temperatures. The experimenters tested the system with three phase and single phase AC at three different energy levels with fifty trials per level. The system was charged using the AC power source aligned with a delta-wye transformer and PCS system allowing for a rapid charge rate. After the data was recorded, the experimenters determined that an efficiency of 93% was achieved. Comparing this to other storage systems the efficiency is phenomenal. This project concludes that an SMES can be built without a bulky design, whist being cost effective, and with high efficiency allowing SMES systems offer a broader range of applications.

THE SYNTHESIS OF A COMPOUND DEVICE TO MAXIMIZE SOLAR AND WIND ENERGY
Andrew David Hurst, Zachary Klein, 
Long Beach Senior High School, Lido Beach, NY

With fossil fuel emission increasing at a greater rate in recent years, alternative fuel sources are constantly being sought after. Sources that are efficient as well as environmentally friendly can eliminate the multitude of problems caused by petroleum-based fuels. Wind and sunlight are two sources that have proven to be very resourceful in recent years. Windmills and photovoltaic cells have been very beneficial in converting wind and solar energy into other energy forms, such as electricity. In attempt to maximize the benefits from these phenomena, a single device to harvest energy from the sun and wind was created. At the same time, a low budget was maintained, making it economically more beneficial than oil as well. A wind turbine was created using a car alternator and three blades constructed from aluminum. Four solar panels were placed on the tail of the windmill, which helped the blades turn into the wind. The solar panels that were facing the sun produced higher voltages than the solar panels in the opposite direction. During the course of any 24-hour period, each solar panel produced relatively equal voltages. The alternator, when spinning at high RPM’s, was able to produce enough voltage to effectively charge a 12 volt car battery. The average voltage for a given week of testing measured between 39 and 44 volts. The device as a whole was efficient in producing energy that superseded the energy of any individual device, as well as saving space by combining the two energy forms.

VOLCANO OF ENERGY
Jennifer Colon, Asuwie M. Serrano Lugo, 
Luis Munoz Marin High School, Barranquitas, PUERTO RICO

The Volcano of Energy concept came into existence due to the following question: Could it be possible to acquire a flow or stream of air using the heat released by the sun? The hypothesis poses that a black, aluminum object inside a crystal pyramid will generate a flow of hot air that could be used to generate electricity. Initially voltage quantities were produced with a generator using different wind speeds. The data collected evidenced that the higher the velocity of the air flow, the greater the amount of voltage that was produced by the generator. The investigation included six attempts. The sixth attempt involved the placement of a crystal, transparent pyramid with openings at the top and bottom areas. Using a piece of aluminum, a cone shaped object was created and was painted black. The aluminum, cone shaped object was placed inside the pyramid. The widest areas of both objects were placed on the ground. Finally, the objects were exposed to the sunlight and the speed of the wind that came out of the pyramid was measured. The hypothesis was confirmed given the fact that when the prototype was exposed to the sunlight a flow of hot air was produced, which in turn could be used for the generation of electric energy. The following modifications can be done to improve the prototype: to conduct the investigation during the summer months, to substitute the fan with a more efficient spherical turbine and to increase the size of the prototype.

DILUVIUM DETECTOR: DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A FLOOD ALERT SYSTEM TO SAVE LIVES
Pedro Julio Hernandez-Rodriguez, Elliot J. Ramos-Cheverez, 
Adela Rolon Fuentes, Toa Alta, PUERTO RICO

It can be very difficult to deliver flood warnings if people living in flood prone areas are not in communication with the news media at the time of sudden floods. Therefore, this will put their lives at risk. The problem was to build a flood alert system to alert people leaving in flood prone zones. The hypothesis under study was that it is possible to design and construct a flood alert system using a water level detector and an alarm that automatically alerts people and local authorities to protect life in times of flooding. <br><br>A prototype of the flood detector was constructed. It contains an electric circuit which consists of an integrated ULN 2803 circuit with a set of NPN transistors. Sensors, LED indicators and a siren with stroboscopic light are then connected to this circuit. The whole circuit was protected and put inside a vertically positioned PVC tube. LEDs emit light when water enters the system, touches the sensors and the circuit is activated. When water entering the system reaches a pre established height then the siren is activated. The flood detector was tested for different water levels inside a recipient, for rainfall flooded areas and at different water levels of the Maunabo River which usually floods various communities. It can be concluded that it was possible to construct an effective flood alert system for people in flood prone areas. This device can monitor river water levels. The sound of the siren will alert people to activate emergency evacuations.

DRL INNOVATIONS
Luke William Finkernagel, Ryan Staub, Drew McCall
Chapin High School, Chapin, SC

There are 2,800 summer swimming leagues in the United States, most of whom are local outdoor neighborhood pools. These particular pools either invest in one of two types of blocks in the swimming block market: Transportable (blocks that can be moved easily) or Mounted (blocks bolted to the ground). Most of these outdoor leagues cannot purchase any of these expensive blocks, so in compensation they have to build highly inadequate homemade blocks or have none at all. The mounted blocks are far too expensive (average $2,000) and pools logically do not want the potential hazard of children getting hurt playing around the mounted blocks during free swim. Transportable blocks are also expensive (average $1,700) and can be very wobbly (affecting the swimmer's time).<br><br>The Marlin 1 SpeedBlock will be aimed to serve as an effect alternative to these expensive blocks for summer league pools. The Marlin 1 has the sturdiness of a bolted down mounted block but has the ase of access and transportability as a transportable block. The Marlin 1 will also have features no other swimming block on the market has: vertical swimming platform height adjustment, angle adjustment for foot platform, and an adjustable foot rest on the platform.<br><br>The velocity will be measured for transportable, mounted, and no blocks. The velocity measurements will be compared to the velocity of the Marlin 1. Test subjects will require to swim a 50 yard lap off each block and the times will be compared.

REINVENTING THE WHEEL: THE OMNIDIRECTIONAL TRACK SYSTEM
Andrew Kenneth Messing, Philip Keller, 
Hardin Valley Academy, Knoxville, TN

The Omnidirectional Track System (ODTS) is a track system designed so that when used on a vehicle, the tracks enable the vehicle to move omnidirectionally (forward or backward, side-to-side, diagonally, and rotating) with ease and precision. A conventional tracked vehicle has several advantages over wheeled vehicles such as greater ground traction and a larger payload capacity, but has much less mobility. And, while an omnidirectional wheel system is more mobile and efficient than conventional tracks and wheels because of its larger range of movements, it is still severely limited in ground traction and payload capacity. A vehicle with the ODTS is tested on payload capacity, mobility, ability to climb various inclines, and traction. The research paper provides the mathematical equations representing the ODTS kinematics as it moves translationally and rotationally. Calculations demonstrate that the ODTS creates more maneuverability than a conventional track or wheel-based vehicle and provides more payload capacity and more ground traction than an omnidirectional wheel-based vehicle. This invention creates the possibility for new vehicles with superior payload capacity, precise maneuverability, and omnidirectional motion. Vehicles with these attributes could revolutionize machinery used in diverse fields such as agriculture, military, industrial, and warehousing.

This project is an invention to help other people especially those who organize a commercial undertaking in baking and even the housewives to serve the best for the others. The idea is to create a machine that can help these people to separate the egg yolk, egg whites and the egg shell in a very short time, that is 1 egg for 3 second and 15 seconds for 5 eggs. So, by doing this , they can save more time and can help them to ease their burden. First, pick a suitable range of voltage required to operate this machine, which is 8 volt. Next, put the eggs into the egg holder one by one. After that, close the sleeve cover until the indicator lights up. Turn on the switch and the machine will break the eggs to separate the yolk, egg white and the shell of the eggs. Then, take out the shell of the eggs. The result, the egg whites and the egg yolks have been separated in a short time. This machine can separate the egg white, egg yolk and the shell of the eggs in an average of 10 seconds for 5 eggs at a time. It doesn’t matter whether the eggs are an A, B or even C grade. The possibility for this machine to fail in the process is only about 4%. The percentage of the egg yolks that can be separated from the egg whites is 96%. From the test that had been done by us, only 2 eggs out of 50 eggs failed to be separated. As the conclusion, we believe that our project can be used to help those people in the baking industries and the housewives to ease their burden. So, we believe that our project can be commercialized, as it requires a low cost and it is environmental-friendly. This project only requires a little amount of electricity and this machine doesn’t require the usage of fuel to operate it. This machine is also very convenient and easy to be carried. Therefore, we believe that our project can be a success and can contribute a lot for the mankind.

ION PROPULSION: ELECTROSTATIC THRUSTER DESIGN AND OPTIMIZATION FOR SPACE APPLICATIONS
Wesley Hileman, Matthew Hileman, 
The Classical Academy, Colorado Springs, CO

Electrostatic thrusters are promising alternatives to chemical rockets in space applications. This engineering project focuses on maximizing key performance parameters by developing, implementing, and testing thrusters with various anode, cathode, and magnetic field configurations. The goal was to identify configurations providing high thrust output, high specific impulse, and low mass.<br><br>Our methodology consisted of six steps: (1) gather information, (2) develop thruster evaluation criteria, (3) design thrusters, (4) build thrusters, (5) conduct experiments, and (6) interpret data. All thrusters used air as a propellent. Measurements of thruster exhaust velocity (via hot-wire anemometer), test-site temperature and humidity (thermometer), and pressure (barometer) allowed calculation of thrust and specific impulse. Measurements were normalized, then a multi-criteria decision analysis was preformed to compare thrusters.<br><br>We found that thrusters one, four, and eight excelled in all criteria. Thruster one maximized the creation and axial movement of ions. Thruster four was efficient, but preformed lesser due to insufficient neutralization leading to partial thrust reversal. Thruster eight was efficient, but ion movement was hindered due to electromagnetic field interference resulting in increased exhaust dispersion. Finally, thruster one’s specific impulse varied parabolically with body diameter.<br><br>We conclude that thrusters implementing pointed cathodes, tubular or gridded anodes, and no axial magnetic fields had maximum efficiency. We recommend further research explore (A) the use of propellents with low ionization potential, (B) vacuum testing, (C) improved thrust measurement options such as pendulum gauges and ultrasonic pulsing, and (D) continued configuration examination.

Colored LED displays are seen and used widely in public, such as Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs), laptop computers and mobile phones. In this fast-pace world, people often have to deal with their personal financial matters such as managing their bank accounts in public using ATMs. In view of this, personal information displayed on the monitors may be seen by people closed by, causing serious security problem.<br><br> <br><br>The aim of this project is to solve this everyday problem by applying a simple but ingenious system on existing colored LED displays. Instead of displaying fixed and still numbers, such as one’s bank account balance on the screen, we alter the display slightly by deliberately adding several sets of “fake” numbers of different yet similar colors on the screen so as to overlap with the real number. The result will be a set of fast flicking numbers seen by the naked eye and the true information cannot be recognized by people viewing the display. Only the user viewed through a small window which has a special colored plastic filter placed directly above the display can see the true information on the screen.<br><br> <br><br>This special display system works by applying the characteristics of subtractive colors onto the plastic filters. We carried a series of experiments and found the best combination of colors for the number display and the color filter. We chose the complementary colour red and green for demonstration in our model at last.

Trung Bach Tran, Vinh Anh Vu, Trang Thi Quynh Bui
Hanoi-Amsterdam High School, Hanoi, URUGUAY

Desalination of seawater has played an important role in resolving the need for freshwater. In this project we present a novel design of a desalinating system by combining solar energy and low pressure technique. A vacuum ejector is designed and utilized to create a low pressure of about 0.1~0.13 atm at which seawater boils at temperature 50~55°C. Additionally, solar energy is utilized to maintain the boiling temperature to produce distilled water, which could be used for daily life.<br><br><br>The design of the system encompasses hydraulic concepts, employing an ejector and centrifugal pump to create low pressure and reduce the boiling point of seawater, thus enabling solar energy to effectively desalinate seawater. The thermal concepts - solar energy, boiling point elevation of saline and specific enthalpy of steam, pure water and saline were used to model the distilling process to optimize the distillation process. The operating parameters of the prototype were<br><br>determined based on theoretical calculations.<br><br><br>Experiments on lab-scale and pilot-scale were carried out. The prototype system produced up to 7.8 liters in 4 hours with recovery rate ~55%. The experimental yield was ~90%, comparing with theoretical prediction.<br><br><br>Our novel desalination system prototype showed high efficiency and potential for practical application by taking advantage of the available resources due to its simplicity, easy-to-use and highly applicable for coastal and island areas, where population is low and scattered. The scale-up of our design could be well fitted for many practical purposes.<br><br><br>Keywords: Desalination; Distillation; Vacuum Ejector Pump; Solar Energy; Boiling point elevation.

The world these days has become majorly reliable on electricity which is a vital requirement yet a huge problem, the fusel fuel that was mainly used in electricity generating process appears to have bad consequences on the economics of most of the nations considering that this expensive source of energy is not renewable and it’s a must to find an alternative cheap renewable source of energy.<br><br>Believing that burning fuel is burning money and aiming for a better tomorrow we have created this infinity engine that can easily appeal to the needs of brighter future.<br><br>We were based on common combustion engines design with a little change and we have replaced the combustion by the permanent magnets to produce rotary force. We have used the repulsion of tow neodymium magnets with the same polarity in order to create rotation. The engine is made of stainless steel, aluminum and Teflon.<br><br>The data collected revolves around the properties of the materials used in the fabrications also the force produced by the resource involved and how much electricity it could produce.<br><br>Concerning the difficulties it may be hard to find the materials especially the neodymium magnets on top of this the application of the theory may not be as easy as it seems.<br><br>The implementation of this engine will give us a chance to produce a cheap renewable energy. This engine can be implemented at homes to produce electricity and also in cars. This will lead to the reduction of pollution.<br><br>

THE DEPOSITION OF PROTECTIVE COATINGS ON ALUMINUM FOILS IN THE MAGNETRON DISCHARGE
Alexander Sergeevich Prishvitsyn, Nikolay Lozbenev, 
State budget educational school lyceum 1511, Moscow, Moscow, RUSSIA

This project is devoted to creation and testing of coating for protection of aluminum collectors of ultra-capacitors against corrosion in alkali electrolyte. We have hypothesized that carbon, titanium, and copper are suitable materials for protective coatings, as they do not react with alkali at room temperature. Multi-component coatings may also have required properties.<br><br>At our request, carbon, mixed titanium-carbon, and copper coatings were deposited on aluminum foils at the research university. A stationary magnetron discharge was used for sputter deposition, as the magnetron discharge is one of widely used deposition techniques that can produce dense and uniform coatings with good adhesion.<br><br> <br><br>We carried out an analysis of deposited films. We evaluated adhesion of the coatings to the aluminum substrate using the tape test. All the samples had a very good adhesion. Then we studied protective properties of coatings in 30% aqueous solution of alkali NaOH. During the tests, the samples were observed in an optical stereo microscope. We observed that hydrogen bubbles, which appear as a product of the reaction of aluminum with alkali, appeared on samples with carbon and titanium-carbon coatings after contact of alkali with the foil. At our request, the samples were examined in a scanning electron microscope; this examination demonstrated that many microcracks, and exfoliations of the film were produced. We proposed a model of protection coating destruction. <br><br>We got three types of coatings. Copper coatings can be used for protection aluminum against alkali. Basing on these results, further researches were planned and implemented. Use of ion pretreatment of the substrate and increase of the sputter rate made possible deposition of coatings stable in alkali for a long time.

SEMI-METALLIC FENDERS: PROTECTION UNDER GUARDRAILS FOR MOTORCYCLISTS WITH THE TREAD OF THE TIRE
Felipe Machado Ody Figueira
Fundacao Escola Tecnica Liberato Salzano Vieira da Cunha, Novo Hamburgo, BRASIL

The worldwide levels of traffic deaths each year grows absurdly. Much of this figure is due to the types of restraints used road today. The guardrail protection is the most used in Brazil today. It's main objective is to prevent the vehicle from four or more wheels off the road to avoid a claim of greater consequence. That kind of defense does not seek the safety of the rider nor the passenger because it was not designed for this purpose. The guardrails have fastening poles which act as true guillotines motorcyclist's body during an accident. These "guillotines" can be solved by implementing my protection at lower metal fenders, made with the tread of a tire unserviceable truck or bus. With this enhancement of the protection and use of Brazilian Regulatory Standards (NBRS) I developed the project Semi-metallic Fenders, which aims not to let the passenger nor the driver come in contact with the pole and the outside of the track, thus avoiding an accident severity and reducing material damage motorcycle. The tire tread, which is made mainly of rubber and steel wires, will dissipate the impact energy over containment system. The semi-metallic fenders provides a more safety in traffic, also presents a creative, sustainable, innovative and socially relevant problem, and above all gives a disposition to truck and bus tires that are unusable and pollutants for the environment.

APPLIED TRIANGULATION USING INNOVATIVE SIGNAL PROCESSING AND RADIO FREQUENCY CAPTURING (ISPARC (C))
Alexis Rose Hopkins
Fort Walton Beach High School, Fort Walton Beach, FL

The purpose of this project is to develop and evaluate a radio frequency based transceiver system designed to locate a target (RF Transmitter) safely and efficiently.<br><br>Rescue personnel are hindered by environmental factors in a building or area with a person trapped inside. My specially designed system will provide location identification in which the rescue personnel can use. <br><br>I performed angle tests and determined I could not measure an angle more precisely than 45 degrees leaving an error of up to 27.99 meters wide. I performed line of sight and off angle tests. Using the angle tests, I was able to obtain a best fit line to the data and calculate that I could locate a transmitter within 3.45 meters along a straight line. <br><br>After reviewing the principles of triangles and triangulation with the assumption of using an omnidirectional antenna, I developed an application of triangulation using four RF Receivers. Each pair of RF Receivers would use the relationship of distance and power along a straight line to determine the target’s location. By orienting the two lines in a known configuration, I can use the law of cosines to determine the angles to the target and apply triangulation to calculate its location. <br><br>Provided my calculation and results, I can measure a waveform from an unknown location and process that data to identify and detect a target with accuracy and efficiency.

DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW COMMUNICATION METHOD AND MECHANISM FOR DEAFBLIND PEOPLE
Isaac Christopher Portocarrero-Mora
Colegio Vocacional Monsenor Sanabria, San Jose, COSTA RICA

There is an estimate of 77,000 hearing- and visually-impaired people in Latin America, eager to have tools that will enable them to make their contribution to society. This project is aimed at solving some of the difficulties faced by this population, thus helping them interact in an easier way with their surroundings and communicate with those around them, by creating a low-cost universal communication method and mechanism accessible to the target population. In order to solve the language standardization issue a universal language is proposed based on the binary language and the alphabet including numbers. An interpretation mechanism is developed concurrently consisting of a glove fitted with 6 vibrating devices and capacitive sensors working together with an application developed for Android devices. Anyone wishing to communicate with the hearing- and visually-impaired individual speaks to the mobile device (telephone or tablet) that recognizes what is said and sends it to the glove, where the vibrating device translates the message according to the standard language created. The user can answer using a capacitive keyboard placed on the palm of the hand, displaying the message on the telephone’s screen and reproduced by voice. The system is also capable of sending and receiving text messages allowing long-distance communication. The prototype has been tested using the Pavlov classical conditioning method, with the subject being able to recognize 6 letters in 6 sessions. The results have led to plans to enhance the project with the use of image-recognition technologies and scanning of the surroundings.

INNOVATIVE, EASY TO USE AND SAFE CIRCUIT AND LIGHTING CONTROL FOR EVERY HOUSE
Simon Kieran Bluett
Meanscoil na mBraithre Chriostai, Cill Chainnigh, Kilkenny, IRELAND

The aim of the project was to design and construct a viable system to control electrical circuits in the home remotely and easily. A number of home control products exist on the market, but this concept takes a totally different approach, by easily retrofitting the existing electrical system. <br><br>The project involved the design and development of a system consisting of four elements: an electro-mechanical unit to control the circuit breaker switches on the house distribution board, a micro-controller, an online control panel and an end-user interface running on a smart phone and a website. Each of these elements was developed individually and as a unit, through research, planning and experimentation stages, from initial concept to fully working prototype. The development of the electromechanical unit involved the use of a CAD/CAM facility; the other elements required the application of a range of programming languages, including ‘C’, 'PHP' and 'Java'.<br><br>The electro-mechanical units clip onto the circuit breaker switches on the house distribution board. No existing electrical circuits are tampered with, meaning a reduced cost and increased safety. The flick units are connected to a micro-controller, which receives its commands in text-message format from the central control panel via a smart phone app or the online website. This allows the user to control the circuits in the house from any location in the world. The system can also be used as a timer to switch off circuits when not required, resulting in energy saving and increased safety.

VERTICAL AXIS WIND TURBINE FARM CONFIGURATION EFFICIENCY BASED ON SCHOOLS OF FISH IN NATURE
Yenny Dieguez
Jose Marti MAST 6-12 Academy, Hialeah, FL

The purpose of this experiment was to find the most effective VAWT farm configuration, arranged to simulate how fish swim in schools, to generate a higher output of energy measured in volts. The investigation sought to find if arranging the VAWTs in this way would improve the efficiency of the farm, as opposed to isolating the VAWT so that it would receive no interaction from another VAWT. The hypothesis stated that the configurations in which all 7 turbines were working together would produce the most voltage. <br><br>Seven VAWTs and a wind tunnel were constructed. All in all, 29 different configurations were tested at 5 different diameter distances. All testing was conducted inside wind tunnel, where factors remained constant. Turbine1 counterclockwise remained constant. <br><br>It was discovered that arranging VAWTs in counter rotating rows is essential, as they benefit from aerodynamic interactions from neighboring adjacent turbines. When VAWTs were not arranged in this manner, the average voltage output suffered drops of up to 57.32% average. Additionally, patterns were distinguished for their efficiency, with up to average 11.26% increase in voltage output. The results of this experiment did not support the hypothesis. <br><br>The findings of this experiment can be applied for the benefit of society because technology for extracting energy from the wind has become a topic of economic, social, and political interest in the course of the last 50 years. Vertical axis wind turbines offer an efficient alternative because they have a smaller footprint, take up less space, and are more versatile.

ANALYSIS OF HYPERSONIC WAVERIDER DESIGNS AND DETERMINING THE MOST AERODYNAMICALLY EFFECTIVE DESIGN
Thomas Sterling Walsh
Pensacola High School, Pensacola, FL

The potential applications of deriving efficient hypersonic body designs could be one of the biggest leap in the field of aerospace since the invention of the jet engine. The ability to take the excessive amounts of time it takes to travel across the globe by air and to turn that into a fraction time spent traveling by traveling at hypersonic speeds, also the numerous military applications by mastering this technology. The ultimate goal of this project is to take the theorized Waverider concept wear the body of the aircraft manipulates the shockwave produced bye the aircraft traveling at such high speeds and use it to the aircraft’s advantage. I have developed several designs which are designed to do this. And the final goal will be to show which design would be the most aerodynamically effect based on an accepted system for aerodynamic performance at such high speeds. When I fished the experiment I found that I had proved my hypothesis that the design I had based off of conical flow would have the greatest aerodynamic effectiveness and thus being the optimal design to select in the construction of a hypersonic aircraft.

USING MATHEMATICAL MODELS TO SIMULATE OFF-ROAD VEHICLE PERFORMANCE AND DESIGNING OPTIONS FOR CHANGING DYNAMIC WEIGHTING TO INCREASE DRAFT
Elijah Lloyd Welu
Marshall High School, Marshall, MN

In the year 2050 the world’s farmers need to produce twice the food on half of the amount of land. I want to start on a smaller scale however, so I hope to design a system to distribute weight on a quarter scale pulling tractor. This Dynamic Ballasting System will be able to distribute weight forward on the tractor as the pull goes on, this in turn will allow the tractor to steer while still having the maximum amount of weight on the back to increase draft. I used mathematical models to show at what amount of slip there will be maximum weight on the back tires. I took given weight distribution equations and used the SDSU quarter scale tractor design for the measurements. After examining graphs made from John Deere engineers showing different weight distributions of tractors I saw that my data I collected followed the same pattern. This proved my data is accurate and that I could continue with the idea of changing dynamic weight. I have found that I found at about 12% slip the front tires of the tractor will start to lift off of the ground. To solve this problem I summed the moments around the rear axle to find out how much weight I need to add to the front axle to be able to maintain steering. This weight was approximately 80 pounds at 44 inches extended out. In conclusion I found my system would improve the pulling power of the tractor.

POWERING THE WORLD: THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF A GREEN ENERGY TECHNOLOGY
Marcus James Langevin
Lincoln Senior High School, Thief River Falls, MN

In the United States, and many other countries alike, there is a growing need for more energy. However, supplying this energy in a way that is both good for the environment and economically viable can be very challenging, as it requires solving many problems. The purpose of my project was to create a prototype floor tile that would harness the energy behind the human footstep and put it to good use by powering the things all around us. Once fully developed, many of these floor tiles would then be installed in places with high-density pedestrian traffic, like malls, schools, and sports stadiums. There, they would then be able to power most of the electrical needs of the building. This would mean that the building would need less energy from outside sources, like power plants that rely on fossil fuels. The prototype was designed and created out of raw materials in a machine shop. The energy output will only increase as the design of the tile improves. The cost per Kilowatt will also go down as more tile are manufactured. In the future the tile will be everywhere in urban cities, where there are lots of people to step on the tile. Everyone walks, so why not use the force behind each step to power our lives, and the world.

DIAPHRAGMS OF SPEAKERS
Victoria JoDyon Doctolero
Leesville High School, Leesville, LA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether saran wrap, plastic covering, copy paper, or tissue paper would provide the highest decibal reading when used as the material for a diaphragm of a speaker. For the procedure I simply took the speaker apart using a screwdriver, then tore the speaker cover off using a flathead screwdriver. Then I cut the original diaphragm out of the spider rack using an exacto knife. Then I made new diaphragms using each of the materials for each set of speakers. Then, I ran a single sound through each speaker and read the decibal reading with a decibal meter. The results showed that the plastic covering gave the highest decibal reading. However, I realized the thicknesses of the diaphragms are different, so to get more conclusive results, I made each diaphragm the same thickness. I did this by gluing several pieces of a material together until they all had the same thickness. I used a different procedure of making the diaphragms to decrease the amount of crumpling on the diaphragm and I also used a different and louder sound from my computer to make it easier to get a decibal reading. The results showed that the saran wrap was the loudest, and the plastic covering provided the lowest decibal reading. In conclusion, the saran wrap produces the highest decibal reading using that type of construction and cone.

MINIMIZING DRAG COEFFICIENTS BY AUGMENTING A NEOTERIC COMPUTATIONAL ALGORITHM WITH COMPUTERIZED OPTIMIZATION
Kwuang Tang
Little Rock Central High School, Little Rock, AR

This project’s purpose was to develop a mathematical piecewise generating function for the minimum-drag profile in any fluid environment. Since no comparative method for determining drag existed besides using either the highly sophisticated Navier Stokes equation-derivations or expensive wind tunnels to develop such a profile, a mathematical algorithm for calculating the drag coefficient was first constructed. Based on published wind-tunnel data, the algorithm was found to have 1.3%-1% error. Capitalizing on existing research, the 5:1 aspect ratio, and the mathematically proven least-drag fore portion generating equation was applied. The maximum thickness abscissa was then optimized with a TI-Basic program. Finally, a C# program utilizing the new drag-calculation algorithm was constructed to optimize the aft portion generating equation. The completed profile was found to have a drag coefficient of .00033, much lower than the Joukowski airfoil, the elliptical airfoil, and any other published profile available. Since the algorithm’s accuracy was rigorously enforced, the optimization program was logically sound, and the new profile had the lowest known drag coefficient, the profile was deemed the most fluid-dynamic shape. With applications ranging from more efficient vehicles to sports equipment design optimization to theoretical influence, probable extensions include actual wind-tunnel tests, and a study on reverse conformity to the optimal profile.

SOLAR FUNNEL COOLER: POTENTIAL SOURCE OF REFRIGERATION/COOLING FOR UNDEVELOPED AREAS
Galen Daniel Lee
Holy Spirit Catholic Regional High School, Tuscaloosa, AL

The purpose of this experiment was to design a low cost, portable solar funnel cooler which could be used to preserve food and medicine in undeveloped areas or during emergency disaster relief. The target temperature range of the cooler was 35 to 45 degrees Fahrenheit. Solar funnel cooler kits were constructed using various materials and funnel sizes to allow for comparison of the abilities of each to radiate infrared (IR) radiation. The solution containers were painted matte black in an effort to improve IR radiation function. Comparisons between various materials, water and a five percent brine solution, and two different types of bags, nylon and high density polyethylene (HDPE) were conducted. To evaluate cooler performance, temperature measurements and weather conditions were noted throughout the day and night. Data show wrapping the cooler in Mylar, using the water solution, matte black glass, the thin HDPE bags, and the largest (super) funnel achieved the fastest drop and lowest temperatures. Using these components, the target temperature was reached. Results prove use of the solar funnel cooler for refrigeration purposes is a viable option.

Despite the great development of renewable power systems, they still have some problems, majority of them occupy vast squares, there exist energy accumulating problems, they require building of new power lines and transformers etc. Thus, the main purpose of the project was to create new type of smart grid which consists of special household low-powered stations, so called smart power cells. In such system there is a constant exchange with both energy and information between consumers and producers, depending on their needs and possibilities.<br><br>To realize this idea, I designed and constructed unique functioning sample of smart power cell with following capabilities: ability to store energy from the power net (and renewable energy source) for the household use, accumulation of excess energy during off-peak times, stabilization of the power grid during unstable generation periods, on demand metered transmission of energy to the power grid or local smart network and information link between other smart cells and energy supply provider. It was also taken into consideration that power cell networks may create temporary isolated power systems in the events of the main grid collapse. <br><br>Suggested smart power cell and its communication algorithm, combined into Internet-like network helps to control overflows and peak loads, reduces energy cost and losses, increases power system’s efficiency and stability. Therefore, in this way it is possible to significantly increase the amount of green energy generation in brief terms.<br><br>

Cherry Creek High School, Greenwood Village, CO

The number of children with autism has been steadily increasing. So too has the use of external communication and learning devices such as iPads by these children to help them grow and develop. <br><br>In using such devices, accessibility issues and issues with functionality are inherent; this was the problem this project attempted to solve through building a universal case system. <br><br>To build this case, adults who interact with children with autism who use these devices were surveyed to determine the issues and usefulness of certain things pertaining to iPad use, as well as general background information. This survey was analyzed and the biggest issues were the screen becoming scratched or dirty, the device breaking, the speakers being insufficiently loud, the device being difficult to see due to the angle it was at, and the device not being attached to the student. <br><br>Materials to cover the screen were tested and the best material was determined to be poly-carbonate plastic. Solutions to prevent damage to the device were tested and the best solution was found to be a foam strip around the edge or the device. Lastly amplifying devices were tested and the best device was found to be a curved chamber. The solutions for varying the angle of the device, holding the device, and attaching the device to the student were discussed in a focus group of professionals and the best solutions were determined based on feedback from the experts. This was all combined into the final case design.

DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF A FRACTAL ANTENNA FOR OTA TV
Sarah Van Sickle
Satellite High School, Satellite Beach, FL

Anyone can receive over the air (OTA) television (TV) with a properly designed antenna. The benefits of OTA TV include no monthly fees or contracts. OTA broadcasts are available in most areas. This project focused on modeling, designing, building and testing Koch and Sierpinski monopole ground plane fractal antennas to receive OTA TV. It also compared the performance of the fractal antennas to the Wonder Antenna, a typical log-periodic dipole array (LPDA) style TV antenna sold in stores.<br><br> Using professional ANSYS HFSS 13.0 software First and Second Iteration Koch and Sierpinski fractal antenna models were created. These models were used to generate S plots, Z plots and 3D electromagnetic field plots. Then fractal antennas were built and their resonance points analyzed using an Agilent Network Analyzer. The modeling and Network Analyzer results were similar. The performance of the fractal antennas was compared against the Wonder Antenna using 35 signal quality samples from 20 stations collected over three months. The signal quality was generally higher for the Wonder Antenna, but both the Wonder Antenna and fractal antennas received 13 to 14 stations with acceptable signal quality. The stations include ABC, CBS, NBC and FOX national broadcasts. <br><br> A fractal antenna can be custom built for any broadcast area by determining the design frequency, calculating the element length, and then building the antenna. The materials used in this project are inexpensive and readily available.

WEB-ENABLED PROGRAMMABLE WATER HEATER CONTROLLER
David Prilutsky
Dr. Ronald E. McNair Academic High School, Jersey City, NJ

Heatduino is a new microprocessor-based technology developed to save energy wasted by conventional water heaters that keep water warm when it isn't needed.<br><br> Traditional whole house water heaters (WH) maintain a given water temperature regardless of whether or not the water is used. WH temperature controls are mechanical devices; they can't be programmed to shut down at night or operated remotely. This is a problem if you leave on vacation forgetting to turn off the WH. This leads to inefficient water temperature control and significant energy waste.<br><br> To optimize WH control and decrease used energy, I developed Heatduino – a programmable internet enabled remote control for a WH. Heatduino works in combination with over 95% of existing WHs, is safe to use, and is simple to install. Heatduino allows for programming any WH to save energy at night when water is not used and remotely change WH's temperature through a smart phone or computer.<br><br> Heatduino controls the WH with a servo connected to the WH's control. The servo control block is implemented with an Arduino microprocessor. An additional Ethernet Shield is used for remote connectivity. Heatduino software was developed with C++ language and utilized Ethernet, Nettime, and servo libraries. Programming included implementation of a simple proprietary web server and control logic. Client implementation is based on HTML, AJAX, and JavaScript technologies.<br><br> Initial estimates and tests show the Heatduino technology can save up to 19% during night hours and presents much greater savings (70%) when used for vacation properties.

A MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT CRUTCH DESIGN
Benjamin Thomas Tow
C.H. Yoe High School, Cameron, TX

The crutch, which has been around since 3000 B.C., has only made advancements in its design shape, not in efficiency. The purpose of this experiment was to develop a more energy efficient crutch design, where efficiency is described as the amount of force applied to heel impact. The null hypothesis of this experiment was that the new crutch design would have an equal energy efficiency compared to F.S. Lin’s patented crutch. The new crutch design that was proposed in this experiment was designed with a fiberglass leaf spring to give the crutch an improved energy output. Testing was conducted by measuring the initial(heel) impact, equilibrium point(flat foot), and final(toe) impact on a force plate grid. The average for the fifteen trials with the new crutch design is as follows: heel impact 859.67 Newton’s(N), flat foot 607 N, and toe impact 779.13. The average of the fifteen trials for F.S. Lin’s crutch is as follows: heel impact 799.53 N, flat foot 568.73 N, and toe impact 752.13 N. The data disproves this experiments hypothesis by showing that the new crutch design has, on average, a 60 N Higher heel impact. Therefore, the new crutch design is more energy efficient than F.S. Lin’s patented crutch.

FRICTION-REDUCING FERROMAGNETIC FLUID
Timothy Joel Lyne
Brush High School, Brush, CO

This project explored possibilities of using ferromagnetic fluid and neodymium magnets as low-friction bearings. Ferrofluid surrounding a magnet virtually eliminates friction. The goal was to engineer a bearing using this observation that could outperform the efficiency of commercially available thrust bearings. Field research was conducted to identify various vertical motor assemblies at Pawnee Power Plant. A vertical motor was designed, modeled, and constructed to represent a basic assembly from the motors observed. <br><br>Each bearing was tested in this motor assembly. The voltage of a power supply was adjusted to drive the shaft of the constructed assembly at 450 RPM, a common vertical motor speed. Using collected data, the power, in watts, was calculated and compared. An average power of 1.62 Watts was required to operate the ferrofluid bearing which was an improvement from the roller thrust bearing (3.08 W) and comparable to the radial roller thrust bearing (1.37 W). It was observed that the ferrofluid bearing produced the least amount of heat after each trial. It also ran at the most constant speed. The results proved that ferrofluid bearings are a feasible alternative to traditional roller thrust bearings. <br><br>The enhanced efficiency of the ferrofluid bearing results largely from the hydrodynamic characteristics of the ferrofluid in addition to reduced vibrations in the system. Ferromagnetic bearings may be used by industries to minimize cost and decrease energy usage reducing pollution in the environment. The concepts gained in this project can be used for systems in energy production, transportation, and other industrial machines.

INVISIBLE KEY
Jianing Liu
Northeast Yucai School, Shenyang, CHINA

With the development of technology, cell phone is indispensable for normal people. It has become a necessary communication tool for our teenagers. So I came up with an idea that we could use cell phones to facilitate our daily life, i.e. function as a key. Cell phone flashlight sends optical signals which can conduct unique pass codes to open the doors. The phototransistor receives the optical signals through Micro Control Unit(MCU) which can analyzes the codes precisely to unlock the door. Meanwhile, build-in duplicate device work simultaneously to avoid faults. I designed special compact keys for elders who don’t use mobile phone.<br><br> This invisible key is approved in different environment and it work precisely. You don’t need to bring keys with you if you have a cell phone. You can unlock doors with a mobile .It makes our life more convenient and secure.<br><br>

We are facing with numerous problems in the world of loudspeakers today.<br><br>The goal is to achieve excellent sound quality at low cost.<br><br>For excellent sound quality three loudspeakers are required: one high, one bass and one middle transmitter. What if we could achieve the aforementioned three frequency-ranges with just one loudspeaker, with a better sound quality and lower production cost? The question is: “Is it possible?” The answer is: “Yes, yes it is!” We just have to re-establish the basic operation principle of loudspeakers.<br><br>I used neodymium magnets, which are among the strongest one nowadays and can be procured easily, but for my purposes I couldn’t use a magnet of any strength or size. Therefore it was more difficult to find the right magnets for my prototype.<br><br>The outer loudspeaker’s frequency pass-through is from 87 Hz to 3700 Hz, with about 118 dB of sensitivity.<br><br>The transmission, as I planned, lasts from 65 Hz to 13 kHz, with smaller swings. The measurements in the school’s laboratory prove that the idea is appropriate, it can be seen and the wide frequency spectrum can be heard.<br><br>In addition, measurements was made in a club-room, where the results were extremely demonstrative. I used an original „Electro Voice” wide-band loudspeaker box, which was developed especially for loud rooms, and astonishingly my new loudspeaker was able to produce a bigger sound-pressure and a more clear sound, than the other four loudspeakers in the room.

ION PROPULSION: ELECTROSTATIC THRUSTER DESIGN AND OPTIMIZATION FOR SPACE APPLICATIONS
Matthew Garrett Hileman
The Classical Academy College Pathways, Colorado Springs, CO

Electrostatic thrusters are alternatives to chemical rockets in space applications. This engineering project focuses on maximizing key performance parameters by developing, implementing, and testing thrusters with various thruster lengths, and circular anode and magnetic field configurations inside a vacuum using the propellant argon. The goal was to identify configurations providing high specific impulse output.<br><br>My methodology consisted of eight steps: (1) gather information, (2) develop thruster evaluation criteria, (3) design thrusters, (4) build thrusters, (5) build apparatus, (6) conduct experiments, (7) interpret data, and (8) repeat 3-7, where and when necessary, based on data. Thrusters used argon as propellant. Measurements of movement and acceleration allowed calculation of thrust when a thruster was attached to strings. Exhaust velocity was unable to be measured. Each thruster is tested three times with 300 data points over a period of 4000 milliseconds. An Arduino was used for precision and timing.<br><br>Thruster 2 probably produces more thrust than thruster one. Thruster 2 produced a force of around 1.163 newtons on average. Thruster 1 produced a force of around 0.892 on average. Though the standard deviations of both thrusters overlap, thruster 2 is probably more efficient. Thruster 2 has a 1.45 inch circular anode in length and thruster 1 has a 2.9 inch circular anode in length.<br><br>I conclude that shorter circular anode effects the efficiency of a thruster. More testing would be done to determine which length is most efficient. It is probable a shorter anode produces greater thrust, but is not certain.

This project aims to design, build, and test a device that uses eye movements to control a robotic arm and lamp as examples of controllable electronics. Photoresistors will be used to track the position of the eye and phototransistors will be used to identify which object should be controlled. Data collection will involve moving photoresistors by increments of one millimeter to determine which position is best for a recordable change of light reflection given off by a moving pupil. The amount of infrared light which must be emitted from objects to be found and differentiated by a phototransistor will also be recorded. The best photoresistor and number of IR LEDs per object will be paired with an Arduino computer and glasses which are coded so that the wearer can control an arm and light by using "if" statements to determine where the pupil is as well as which object is being look towards.

A FOLDABLE SOLAR PANEL WITH AN IMPROVED HILL CLIMBING MPPT CIRCUIT
Alexander Lee Chen
Palos Verdes Peninsula High School, Rolling Hills Estates, CA

This project aimed at developing a compact, foldable solar panel with an improved hill climbing (HC) maximum power point tracker (MPPT) to address the need for efficient and portable power generators. The solar panel could be reconfigured to produce different currents and voltages.<br><br> Instead of using low efficiency solar films, this project employed more efficient Si solar cells to construct the foldable solar panel. Two 6”x6” cells were serially connected and enclosed in a thin, transparent Plexiglas case to form a module. Eight modules were mounted on a fabric to form a panel. Modules were connected to one another by bullet connectors which made the panel reconfigurable. An MPPT circuit was design and assembled to control the solar panel voltage. It included a boost converter and a microcontroller which executed the improved HC algorithm developed in this project. <br><br> Two solar panels were constructed. Each had a size of 3x7.5x14 cubic inches and weighed less than 8 pounds. They produced >60W of total power. The MPPT circuit achieved >98% of electrical power that could be achieved by manually optimizing the converter duty cycle. It showed fast and robust maximum power point tracking under rapidly changing light intensities.<br><br> The results were significant because the solar panel design addressed many practical needs and the improved HC MPPT algorithm addressed the deficiencies of the popular perturb-and-observe algorithm with simple modifications. The solar panel can be used as power generators for outdoor events, campers, and dwellers in remote areas where grid power is not available.

For better scientific investigation and exploration, we design an underwater detector. Different from robot fish or submarine, it’s a mechanical bio-robot jellyfish, based on jellyfish’s body structure and move model. To reach an ideal mechanical and functional state, proper materials for mechanical structure and proper driving pattern are selected; at the same time cameras, various sensors are equipped together with repeated experimental tests and parameter adjustments.<br><br> This detector is able to sink and float flexibly by imitating jellyfish which gains driving power by spurting water counter-back and controls its direction and movement through its unique wingspan movement parameter. When the detector encounters some emergency such as torrent, collision and hostile invasion, it will immediately launch contingency measures like swift sinking, flashlight etc.<br><br> The detector group is made up of two, between which they communicate and fulfill tasks with the cooperation of ground controller.<br><br> The shape and stable movement of jellyfish enable the robot to investigate, explore and escape dangers in the areas of slits and ravines.

A CONCEPT REFRIGERATOR FOR A GROWING WORLD: A SECOND YEAR STUDY
Micah Laura Dunkleberger
Alpha Omega Academy Distant Learning, Rock Rapids, OK

It was hypothesized that if a top access refrigerator was constructed by changing the temperature controls and was powered by a 155 watt or larger solar panel, then the appliance would operate at 38 degrees F/ 3.3 degrees C. A chest freezer was converted into a refrigerator by changing the internal thermostat. A solar charging system was enhanced with a solar panel tilt/rotation frame connected to a small inverter which operated this top access refrigerator. The appliance operated 90% of the time, 109 out of 121 days, from the solar equipment alone. Twelve out of the 121 days where 25% overcast or greater requiring battery supplementation. This alternative designed refrigerator used 7.5 times less electricity than traditional vertical units. The average run time of the appliance was reduced to 7 minutes, 30 seconds hourly (SD=0.031 minutes). The continuous wattage of the appliance was 145.55 W (SD=4.413 W). The four sided design was key to its efficiency making it an option for off-grid and stressed-grid regions as well as developed countries. This alternatively designed refrigerator could reduce the electrical output of existing generating plants or prevent new plants from ever being constructed resulting in fewer emissions, lessened environmental problems, and fewer deaths globally. In the United States alone, there is a potential savings of 138 TWh annually equaling the output of 39.5 coal generating plants. <br><br><br>SD= Standard Deviation W= Watts<br><br>TWh= Terawatt hours C= Celsius <br><br>F= Fahrenheit

A PRACTICAL NOTIFICATION SYSTEM TO IDENTIFY INCOMING SUDDEN IONOSPHERIC DISTURBANCES
Anthony Robert Bisulco
Commack High School, Commack, NY

Solar flares, which are the sudden release of high energy particles from the sun, are a threat to our vital communication and power networks. This investigation devises and evaluates a method to minimize this threat by creating a solar flare early detection system based upon identifying characteristics of the solar flare. Solar flares ionize the ionosphere which has been shown to increase its reflectivity. Hence, the reflection of a Very Low Frequency(VLF) wave off the ionosphere increases as ionization in the ionosphere increases. Therefore, a high amplitude reflected VLF signal could indicate a solar flare. The detection and warning system consists of a loop antenna which detects the VLF waves, a preamplifier and sound card, and MATLAB software which processes the signal and identifies the potential solar flare. A smart phone application has been written and implemented to deliver the information about a potentially disruptive solar flare to various communication devices.

ON THE ACCURACY OF OPTICAL DATA
Patrick Nelson Prochaska
Coral Academy of Science, Las Vegas, Henderson, NV

While our military is keeping its digital secrets safe by beaming them across battlefields in the form of infrared lasers and major hospitals are sending visible light messages where life-saving equipment would not permit conventional ones to go, this project seeks to investigate the accuracy of such data. If data is transmitted visibly and through the atmosphere the air in its way will disperse, diffract, and filter the light and whatever data it may have carried will be lost or obscured. I hypothesize that the accuracy of the data will degrade at a constant rate as the dispersion of the laser beam is increased. To test this I set one computer to transmit a binary message by means of a red blinking laser and another to receive that message at consistently greater distances. What I found was that instead of degrading at a consistent rate as I supposed, data remained perfectly constant until a kind of tipping-point and became almost entirely inaccurate afterwards.

THIRD WORLD POWER: USING A JOULE THIEF TO EXTEND BATTERY LIFE
Andrew Jerald Miller
Rio Grande Enrichment Studies, Albuquerque, NM

Over a billion people in third world countries do not have access to household electricity, resulting in a reliance on devices powered by expensive batteries. Given the average third world wage of a few dollars a day, 20-30% is spent on energy sources like batteries, creating a need for improving battery lifetime. Batteries that are considered to be “dead” are discarded even though they still have remaining energy. By incorporating a relatively new type of circuit called a “Joule Thief” (which boosts battery voltage) in a low current draw device, remaining energy in a “dead” battery can be utilized, extending battery life. The purpose of this project was to research and optimize a Joule Thief circuit in a flashlight, gaining additional use from otherwise “dead” batteries. By optimizing a Joule Thief circuit in an LED flashlight that uses two AA batteries, ten additional hours of useable light were obtained from a set of “dead” batteries (resulting in a 16% longer battery lifetime). The optimized Joule Thief circuit design when produced in bulk will cost pennies to add in flashlights, paying for itself in the first set of batteries. Joule Thief flashlights will not only significantly reduce energy costs for people in third world countries, they will reduce battery landfill pollution through the extension of battery life. This project resulted in a working prototype Joule Thief flashlight.

EFFICIENT SMART CLOTHES DRYER
Un Peng Tai
Santa Rosa de Lima High School (Chinese Section), Macao, MACAU

Humid weather brings a lot of troublesome to us, especially the difficulty of drying clothes. Nowadays, there are different kinds of clothes dryer and dehumidifiers, but in general, their power consumptions are fairly high. Furthermore, their efficiencies are not very ideal, so there is plenty of room for improvement. Thus, I had an idea to design a highly effective clothes dryer, which aims to be more eco-friendly.<br><br>Efficient Smart Clothes Dryer is based on a dehumidifier and combined the principle and features of electrothermal clothes dryer with air dehumidifier; one of the distinguishing features of this equipment is that it boasts a humidity testing system, it can be chosen to internal or external air circulation automatically. That is, when the humidity of the internal air is higher than the external, the ventilative door will be opened and the clothes dryer will go into internal circulation, in order to discharge the air which is highly moist and inhale the air which is comparatively dry, and vice versa. Another feature is that the power of this equipment is about 480W, it is lower than the common clothes dryer.<br><br>Via the experiment data, the First Generation of Efficient Smart Clothes Dryer compares with the Electrothermal Drum Clothes Dryer, the efficiency increases about 15%, and the Second Generation compares with the Electrothermal Drum Clothes Dryer, the efficiency increases about 45%, which can save more energy.

Several electronic or electric devices i.e. air conditioner, TV, DVD etc are controlled by remote control systems which are only limited to small distance operations. Later, more device control systems have been developed to operate using the internet from any part of the world.<br><br>This project was conceived because of the curiosity to utilize the same technology as of a remote control device because it’s compact, sleek and can be operated with a flick of a button. The systems to be controlled with this technology are connected with the mobile phone having Subscriber Identity Module Card and are operated with the relay system as Radio Technology is used in mobile phones for communication.<br><br>Initially devices up to 10A current were controlled e.g light bulb; devices up to 120A current can also be controlled i.e. household electricity. Another advantage of using this device is that no credit is used from the SIM card. Using the same technology power stations up to 100A to 4000A current may also be controlled from any distance and from any part of the world by just making a call.<br><br>This device can also be used for security purposes i.e. in case of security breach at home one can get an immediate call on the mobile.<br><br>Thus, the project proved that by using mobile phone technology variety of devices can be controlled without any restriction of distance or internet through a call from anywhere and the same technology can be expanded and used for commercial applications.

Ivan Seleznov
Specialized School No. 22, Mykolaiv, UKRAINE

The aim of this project is to create an ultrasonic device for spatial orientation to be used by visually impaired people, since echolocation appears to be the most convenient and accurate amongst the methods used to calculate the distance between two objects.<br><br> <br><br>The proposed device was designed to send ultrasonic waves (40 KHz) into surrounding environment, receive them back, calculate the distance to an obstacle, and inform the user about obstacle proximity with sound signals or vibrations. This ultrasonic echo locator is based on Arduino Pro Mini 328 platform using a custom-made algorithm employing two HC-SR04 ultrasonic ranging modules to generate ultrasonic pulses and calculate the distance to an obstacle. Then the micro-controller uses pulse-width modulation to communicate with the earphone or tactile sensors as well, using sound, vibration or pressure as feedback. The innovative approach was to make the device in the form of a glove to make it convenient.<br><br> <br><br>The constructed device has up to 4m working range, with two ultrasonic ranging modules located at a 120 angle. Two vibromotors connected with the modules notify the user about obstacles by changing the frequency of the vibration or by sound signals via earphone. The device works 5-6 hours on lithium-ion battery. <br><br> <br><br>The presented device will be simple, reliable, and convenient, allowing to assist many people with sight injuries orient in space better, live an independent life and be active members of the society, besides its price is approximately $50, which makes it available to most of visually impaired people.

A NOVEL, COST EFFECTIVE EXOSKELETON THAT AMPLIFIES ONE'S STRENGTH
Conor James Maddry
Langley High School, McLean, VA

The attempt was made to create the motorized elbow brace to counteract the problems older people face everyday. These being lifting heavier objects such as grocery bags. The exoskeleton does so by mirroring the wearer's movements with the help of force sensitive resistors(FSR).These vary the resistance as force is applied to the contact patch of the sensor. They were placed at two different points on the brace. At these points when the wearer's arm contracts, one of the contacts is stimulated while the other is not. These signals from the force sensitive resistors are sent to the bases of two transistors. These in turn trigger the bases of one of the two pairs of relays. These relays are configured in an H-bridge format to control the motor in both directions. The problem with the exoskeleton was the motor was not geared down enough and therefore was to fast with a lower amount of torque then would have been liked. However, this project was a successful proof of concept as a motorized elbow brace was created for under 50 dollars that mimics the wearer's movements, effectively amplifying their strength.

ELECTROMAGNETIC WHEEL PROPULSION
Theresa Marie Neubig
Paul VI Catholic High School, Fairfax, VA

This project evolved from the idea of using electromagnetic fields to levitate an object therefore reducing friction and increasing efficiency. By using electromagnets to propel an object along its track on a small scale, new means could be discovered by which objects can be propelled with greater efficiency. The purpose of this experiment was to determine if increasing the current of an electromagnet would cause the electromagnet to travel faster along the rails. <br><br>For this experiment, as the number of coils of the electromagnets increase and the current of the electromagnet increases, the time required for the wheel to travel the set distance will decrease. <br><br>In order to determine the effect of changing the current a formula was used. The formula involved the number of coils, the area of the electromagnet, and the length of the electromagnet.<br><br>An apparatus, consisting of a two electrified rail track with permanent magnets mounted in between the rails, was assembled. One electromagnetic wheel was then built with four electromagnets positioned at quarter intervals around a central wooden disc. To vary the strength of the electromagnetic fields, different amounts of current were used.<br><br>The amount of time necessary for the wheels to travel along the set distance of about 1.9 meters was recorded. Different setups included varying the current of the electromagnets and varying the separation distance between the electromagnetic wheel and the fixed magnets. Thirty trials were used for each setup to provide enough data to be analyzed. The results were as hypothesized.

THE EFFECT OF FRACTAL ANTENNA DESIGN ON FM TRANSMISSION
Aaron Andrew Aguhob
George C. Marshall High School, Falls Church, VA

Fractal geometry continues to shape the modern world through its unique self-similar design and advance technology by minimizing size while maximizing performance. The question concerning this experiment stems from the properties of FM signals and the actual design of the Koch Snowflake: Would the design of the fractal allow for greater transmission due to its self-similar design and geometric qualities? For the purpose of this experiment, fractal dipole antennae were tested to determine their effect on transmission of radio frequency signals. It was hypothesized that if fractal antennae were used to transmit FM signals, then the FM transmission would be improved by increasing the number of fractal iterations because of the unique structure of the Koch Snowflake. <br><br>In order to effectively test this hypothesis, a simple FM transmitter was constructed, to which dipole antennae could be interchanged. The transmitter, placed on a plane level to the receiving radio, was moved away from the radio every 30 cm. At each distance, the signal strength in S units was recorded. This process was repeated five times per antenna, allowing for the average signal strength at each distance to be calculated. The data demonstrates a property known as fractal loading, where fractal antennae increase both inductance and capacitance of a transmitter thereby lowering the resonant frequency and widening the bandwidth. Also, the data supports the hypothesis, where the 3rd iteration of the Koch Snowflake antenna demonstrated a 400% increase in the distance maintaining the maximum signal strength of 5 S units.

PROVIDING A WAY TO HELP VISUALLY IMPAIRED PEOPLE USING AUDITORY SIGNALS
Robert Arthur Pakko
Dearborn High School (Dearborn Center for Math, Science, and Technology), Dearborn, MI

The research goal was to provide a way to help visually impaired people recognize where obstacles are in their environment using auditory signals. In short, open source software was used to properly integrate a Microsoft Kinect with a personal computer. A program was then written to use the infrared projector and camera in the Kinect to recognize where objects are three dimensionally. The program and software was then uploaded to a laptop in order to make it mobile. Lastly a 12-volt battery was connected to the device, a mounting structure was created, and headphones were added to make the device truly mobile. A product evaluation was then conducted and it was found that while the device did not improve the test subjects’ times, it did help them to hit fewer obstacles.

WINGLETS FOR WIND TURBINES
Elizabeth Ann Spicer
Fayetteville Senior High School, Fayetteville, AR

The purpose of this experiment was to observe if winglets would increase the power produced by a wind turbine. Two wind turbine models (one with pitched blades and one with straight blades) were created in Autodesk Inventor. Four copies of the pitched blade model and two copies of the straight bladed model were then printed with a 3-D printer. One copy of each model was tested without winglets while the remaining models were tested with four unique sets of winglets. Each model was tested using a box fan as a wind source. Power output of each turbine model was measured using a direct-current motor with several resistance loads ranging from 0.300 to 472 Ohms.<br><br>The data showed that pitched blades create more power than straight blades and that standard airplane-like fenced winglets didn't increase the watts produced. More importantly, however, the data showed that adding a small, downward-facing winglet increased the power produced on average 10% on the straight blade model.<br><br>The total power production increase with the addition of downward-facing winglets could become an important innovation in the growing push for green energy throughout the country. With more real-world accurate testing, winglets on wind turbines could become a very useful innovation in modern energy production.

WATER FOR THE WORLD (YEAR THREE): A HIGH EFFICIENCY COMBINED EVAPORATOR AND CONDENSER FOR SOLAR WATER PURIFICATION
Katherine Lee Zimmerman
Braden River High School, Bradenton, FL

The purpose of the investigation was to design and build a combined evaporator and condenser to increase the water production efficiency of the solar powered water purification system, as compared to the previous year’s design. <br><br>A combined evaporator and condenser was constructed to replace the separate evaporator and condenser systems, used in the previous year’s project. In the combined system, hot water was passed through the evaporator and humidified by a fan which circulated the air through the system, then dehumidified by condenser coils. Temperature, solar insolation, air flow and water flow sensors were used to monitor the operating conditions of the system. All sensor measurements were taken using the EMANT300 Data Acquisition system and modified software from the previous year’s experiment. <br><br>Three different experimental configurations were used to test the system performance. Ping pong balls were used as the evaporator media for configurations one and two. Aspen evaporative cooling pads were used as the media for configuration three. Average water production efficiencies for configurations one, two and three were 43.8 percent, 37.1 percent, and 55.8 percent, respectively. Comparing these results to the previous design’s performance of 16.1 percent and 30.3 percent , shows that the efficiency was improved between 22 and 172 percent. The results from the configuration three tests show an estimated 5.7 and 10.8 liters of water could be made per day, depending on the time of year. Comparing these results to the previous design’s maximum production volumes of between 3 and 6.4 liters per day, show an increase of between 69 percent and 90 percent for the current design.

IMPROVED VIABILITY OF PHOTOVOLTAIC SOLAR CELLS
Ostin David Zarse
Tucson Magnet High School, Tucson, AZ

Implementation of photovoltaic solar cells is limited by the lack of a versatile, large scale energy storage system, the lifespan of solar cells, and low efficiency. To solve these problems, weight energy storage, holographic light filters, and weight driven mechanical sun tracking, respectively, were incorporated into photovoltaic systems and analyzed for benefits, limitations, and improved viability. A low cost energy storage system can be constructed using weights to store the energy in the form of gravitational potential energy. This system with solar modules can create energy independence on a small or large scale. Dichromated gelatin reflection holograms were developed for optimized use with silicon solar cells and their reflections peaks were centered at 1200 nm and 1400 nm. The holograms decreased the temperature by one to two degrees Celsius; however, the short-circuit current showed no decrease. A weight-driven mechanical sun tracker, similar to a clock design, can be used to improve the efficiency of solar trackers and can increase aesthetic appeal. Future work will increase the effectiveness of the holograms.

MULTI-DIMENSIONAL TOUCHLESS COMPUTER INTERFACE
Taylor James Boardman
Delta High School, Delta, UT

This project’s purpose was to create a touchless multi-dimensional computer interface (TMCI) and the associated software. TMCI advantages include: hygienical and germ-free use, intuitive computer interfacing, and ergonomic design. A low-cost TMCI was created by using matched infrared transmitters and photo-transistors to detect the position of the user’s fingers or hands.<br><br> TMCI creation was accomplished by researching and designing a low-cost infrared detection circuit. Components were acquired to build a test circuit, and redesign followed until the detection circuit’s desired output was successfully reached. The infrared emitters and photo-transistors were populated in an aluminum frame. Finally, software was written to process inputs from the I/O device and expanded to demonstrate several applications of the TMCI.<br><br> Two tests were conducted to verify proper operation of the TMCI. The first test was an object detection test. Transmitters and receivers were placed at increasing distances and the detector interference voltage was recorded. Results showed that interference increases at larger distances between the transmitter and receiver, but for the aluminum frame used the interference is irrelevant. The second test was an infrared reflection/absorption test performed by placing various materials one foot (30.5 cm) away from an adjacent transmitter and receiver while measuring the receiver's output voltage. Data from this test showed that plexiglass was the best infrared absorption material while stainless steel was the best reflector.<br><br> The project goal was accomplished with the multi-dimensional touchless computer interface. It could be improved by time-multiplexing the transmitters, but this would increase the circuit and software complexity.

GERMITRON: ROBOTIC ASSESSMENT OF SEED VITALITY
Ema Linnea Parker
West High School, Salt Lake City, UT

The robot “Germitron” was designed and built to assist in the assessment of seed vitality. Aspects of mechanical, electrical, hydrodynamic, software, and systems engineering were all applied in the design and construction of this robot. Nine modular 96-well plates were filled with absorbent material and seeds. Germitron administrated the watering and periodic photography of the plates. Photography occurred at a specially designed station which used three servos to mechanically align each plate in the camera's field of view so that photographs taken at each 5-minute interval could be aligned with all the others to within a few pixels. The photographs were then digitally analyzed and archived to identify stages of seed germination for each seed. Vitality could then be assessed by more than simply the percentage of seeds in a sample that germinate after a couple of days. Rate of germination as well as rate of transition from one stage of germination to another could be determined.

INVESTIGATION OF THE VERICAL VIBRATION ISOLATION DURING TURBULENCE
ShiJia Wang
York High School, Yorktown, VA

I researched that studies of commercial jet transport aircraft during turbulent conditions determined that the primary excitation frequency of concern occurred between 4 Hz and 5 Hz. Based on the comparison of the relative displacement of the seating during turbulence with the maximum vibration levels which should be transmitted to the seated person in order to minimize the reduction in performance and comfort, I determined that the best way to reduce human error is to reduce the relative displacement of the chair. In this experiment, I am designing a vertical vibration isolation system on a seat by means of a non-linear piezoelectric actuator. My first step in my experiment to represent a pilot seat by means of a mathematical model. Then I test the piezoelectric actuator characteristics. I then build a transfer function including the pilot sear model and the piezoelectric actuator and test my model using sinusoidal or random excitation signal as turbulence. I select the parameters for the design and simulate and prove the seat module and controller in MATLAB software. The data I received is the resonance frequency of the entire seated human body is from 4 Hz to 30 Hz. The displacement of the seat and body with the piezoelectric actuator is the least in comparison with conventional isolation systems. The conclusion I reached is that the piezoelectric active vibration isolation controls on the pilot seat is required in the vertical direction to mollify the disturbance felt by the pilot. Theoretically, the piezoelectric actuator, working with other vibration isolation systems, will be able to minimize the relative displacement between the pilot seat and the aircraft.

ACOUSTIC VIRTUAL REALITY IN HEADPHONES
Raman Andreevich Birulia
Gymnasium 41, Minsk, BELARUS

One of the acoustics development priorities nowadays is the creation of a full presence effect. In the existing solutions the sound spread is in horizontal plane. The initial purpose of my research was to create a computer program for synthesizing the 3D sound effect, which allows the stereo sound spread both from left and right, and from front to back. A computer program I developed allows synthesizing the mono sound into a 3D sound. While experimenting, I realized that due to the differences in amplitude-frequency responses for each individual, there was the need of changing these parameters for each person, as each individual user has a unique system of spatial perception due to the differences in the structure of the auricles. I was trying to adjust the existing headphone to each individual; still due to many parameters to be changes in each case I have abandoned it. It led me to the idea, in addition to the computer program, to create a new prototype of 3D headphones applicable to any auricles. Actually, I placed only one low-frequency dynamics loudspeakers at the right angle, while the other three were placed at different angles, in a form of a hemisphere. Eventually, my computer program with the new type 3D headphones allowed me to synthesize the clearly localized in space sound applicable for any auricles, and to minimize the blind zones typical for human perception. This unique approach dramatically improves the quality of virtual reality sound, and may be used in simulators and computer games to create a full sense of presence, as well as for the diagnosis of the vestibular apparatus.

SOAP - O - MATIC
Sophie Isabelle Battat
The Study, Westmount, CANADA

The project’s main objective was to create a prototype of a system that can automatically refill soap dispensers using a hygienic procedure. In meeting this objective, (a) hand washing will be more sanitary and, (b) custodial staff labor and its related cost will be reduced and lastly, (c) the prototype will be a more cost-efficient alternative to the individual dispenser cartridge system. From a scientific and design perspective, the building of this prototype incorporates the computer hardware and software of Arduino (a microcontroller that is programed through a computer software) and implements elements of circuitry and engineering. By developing this system, sources of bacterial contamination in the soap refilling process will be eliminated.<br><br>The prototype of this system is composed of a reservoir, a dispenser, an Arduino Uno, a no touch soap dispensing unit and a peristaltic pump. The reservoir stores all of the soap that will feed the dispensers. Only the reservoir must be filled. The dispenser is equipped with a fluid level sensor. This fluid level sensor is connected to the Arduino through analog pin zero. The pump is entirely controlled by the Arduino (based on the fluid level sensor readings). However, this is done indirectly. Though it might seem as though the pump is controlled directly by digital pin seven, it is actually a relay controlling it. <br><br>To conclude, this reliable prototype forming a series circuit is a step in the right direction towards finding an innovative solution to meet a daily need.

USING A DYNAMO ROTOR TO RETRIEVE ENERGY LOST THROUGH FRICTION BRAKES IN VEHICLES
Aritra Biswas
St. Andrew's Episcopal School, Ridgeland, MS

While most efforts to create energy-efficient cars focus on making lighter vehicles and using alternative fuels, another approach involves finding ways to minimize energy loss. In this project, I explore an alternative braking system that reuses energy lost to friction brakes. A midsize car braking from 35 mph results in a ~209 BTU energy loss, or roughly 0.19 gallons of gas per day (given 20 brakes per day and 20% engine efficiency). If half of this energy could be reused, an average driver would save 6.5% on gas.<br><br>This project examines the effectiveness of a dynamo rotor brake system designed to save a fraction of that energy. The model for this brake system consists of small bicycle dynamos attached radially to a disk, creating a "dynamo rotor brake" to replace the brake pads. Once the wheel attains a certain angular speed, the dynamo rotor brake is pressed against the wheel’s brake disk, decelerating and stopping the car. During this stopping process, each individual dynamo rotates and creates an electrical current which could be saved for reuse.<br><br>If deployed in a car, this process will allow the car's mechanical energy to be converted into electrical potential energy as the car brakes. The project examines the parameters that would affect 1) the car's stopping distance, and 2) the energy generated by the braking system. I conclude that to achieve real-world savings, the strength of each dynamo should be balance and the number of dynamos should be maximized.

CREATING A PORTABLE VERSION OF A NINTENDO 64 GAMING SYSTEM
John Lars Dean
Scotia-Glenville High School, Scotia, NY

There are many different applications where creating a smaller, more efficient package of an already existing system is important. This is a constant strive in the computing industry, where portable devices are becoming a major market. This project utilized a Nintendo 64 gaming system to create a handheld unit that can be played anywhere. Modifications were made to the N64 motherboard, a case was fabricated from a flat sheet of plastic, and subsystems for the unit were planned out in the case. Techniques such as soldering, vacuum forming, and spray painting were used, and equipment such as a Dremel, band saw, belt sander, and soldering iron were employed in the creation of the system. Batteries were incorporated in the system, and issues such as thermal management, power consumption, and ergonomics were taken into account. The end result shows how a seemingly obsolete piece of technology can be innovated to perform in a similar, but enhanced way.

FPGA-BASED CONTROLLER FOR HIGH FREQUENCY INDUCTION HEATING
Weston Daniel Braun
San Dieguito Academy, Encinitas, CA

Induction heaters utilize induced high-frequency currents to heat conductive materials, such as metals and graphite. They provide fast and efficient direct heating that can be precisely controlled, and are a growing industrial technology to replace traditional gas furnaces and torches. Traditionally, induction heaters have been controlled with an analog system based around a phase-locked loop. However, there are limitations to analog-based controllers. They must be reconfigured in hardware when the induction heating work coil or load is changed and require retuning for each specific system configuration. Additionally, overcurrent protection and regulation to control the power output is difficult to implement. This project attempts to overcome these limitations by developing an all-digital controller for induction heaters utilizing digital signal processing on a field programmable gate array (FPGA). An entire induction heating system was designed and built, including signal acquisition hardware and power electronics working in conjunction with a Nexys-2 FPGA development board running Verilog code. The digital control loop developed for this project was tested and demonstrated to be capable of tracking the maximum power point of the induction heater while adapting to variations in loading. The controller was also capable of actively limiting and regulating the power output of the induction heating system. The FPGA-based digital controller developed presents a promising alternative to the analog controllers currently used for induction heating.

My project is a robot designed to clean windows and eliminate the need for human labor. My ultimate aim for this project is to develop my robot to clean high-rise buildings as well as homes. The current version of my robot is designed to clean only house windows. <br><br>The idea to invent a robot that would automatically clean windows came to me when I arrived home from school one day and found my father struggling to clean the outside of our living room windows because he suffers from back and knee pain. During my research I stumbled upon high-rise window cleaning accidents in which people have lost their lives and this gave my project greater purpose. <br><br>The major challenge I faced when designing my robot was getting my robot to stick to a vertical window while maneuvering around its surface without falling off. My solution was to use vacuum technologies, suction cups and direct current motors in my design. My robot is made up of a mechanical system, an electronic system and a pneumatic system. The mechanical system consists of direct current motors that drive the two arms of the robot backward and forward through a rack and pinion enabling movement. The pneumatic system provides the vacuum that enables my robot to stick to the window and also consists of cylinders that lower the suction cups onto the glass. The electronics system is made up of a microcontroller that uses transistors to control the robots various components. <br><br>I plan to one day develop my robot to clean high-rise buildings so it minimizes the risk of workers losing their lives.

Objectives<br><br>Air transportation has become an integral aspect of today’s society. The FAA Aviation safety records document hundreds of aircraft accidents resulting in thousands of fatalities caused by aircraft engine failures. Many of these accidents were caused by ingestion of birds, ice, precipitation, and volcanic ash resulting in engine flameout and/or turbine failure.<br><br> <br><br>The objective is to design a new engine concept that eliminates turbojet failures caused by flameouts.

ROOF MOUNTED HORIZONTAL AXIS WIND TURBINE
Alexander William Beall
Brunswick High School, Brunswick, MD

The purpose of this project was to design and build a new wind turbine for personal home use. This prototype was a roof mounted horizontal axis wind turbine. This turbine would be useful to anyone who was interested in renewable energy for their home but didn’t have the money for solar panels or the space for a traditional home wind turbine. This design would not require any yard space and could be used by anyone with a roof. The low profile of the turbine allows it to not be an eyesore from the street allowing more communities and HOAs (Home Owners Associations) to allow homes in the community to use this turbine. The prototype was built out of coroplast polypropylene and a steel paint can. The design used a large opening that collected the wind off of the roof that then funneled the wind into a smaller opening that lead into the drum. In the drum there were four blades that were fixed to a wooden dowel that rotated from the wind moving through the drum and out the bottom. This turbine could be placed along the top of the roof in the place of the existing ridge vent. Multiple turbines could line the top of the roof on one or both sides and could have a custom ridge vent placed on top to prevent leaks and reduce visability.

CREATING A RELIABLE AND COST EFFECTIVE AIRSOFT GUN
Nathan Turner Wamsley
Home School, Pacific, MO

Airsoft guns are unreliable and fragile as determined through research conducted during this project, which indicates Automatic Electric Guns (AEG’s) break at an undesirable rate, higher than Hammer Valve Assemblies (HVA’s) used primarily in paintball guns. Broken AEG’s quickly become refuse, presumably going to landfills. The purpose of this project is to develop a cost effective solution to the unreliable AEG system. A CAD program assisted in design, analysis and communication of the work. <br><br>AEG airsoft guns rely on a complex assembly of over 100 parts, excluding nuts and bolts, in which small, often plastic parts undergo constant stress. HVA paintball guns rely on a simpler gas operated design, in which a piston strikes a valve, releasing the gas that propels the BB and cycles the piston. This operation allows for larger parts, and less moving ones, which contributes to its reliability. A review was conducted on airsoft and paintball gun concepts to produce a unique design containing less than 50 parts, offering higher gas efficiency than paintball designs, and keeping economic feasibility in mind. This design is estimated to shoot BBs 370-400 fps and obtain 7000-7400 shots per 12 ounce C02 tank making it a desirable product to replace the AEG system.

WIND POWER
Kinsey Brooke Potter
Jackson County High School, Gainesboro, TN

For my science fair project, I transformed a fan into a generator of electricity. The purpose of the experiment involved being able to use something ordinary like a household fan and transform it into something that can generate electricity, which saves money and is good for the environment. Also, by doing this experiment, I gained a knowledge on wind energy, electricity, motors, and electromagnetism.<br><br> In order to transform the fan into a generator of electricity, I took apart a fan motor and drilled four separate holes into the armature. I then placed a ceramic magnet with opposing poles into each hole and put the motor back together (the armature would then create an electromagnetic field which would create electricity when it rotated in the stator). After putting the motor back together, I used a drill to spin the armature inside the stator and connected all possible combinations of wires to a Multimeter which calculated the voltage of electricity generated (the drill acted as the wind). <br><br> My results stated that the armature with magnets generated an average of 1.5 V while the armature without magnets generated an average of 0.27 V. The armature with magnets generated an average of 83% more electricity than the armature without magnets. <br><br> From my experiments and results, I conclude that it is possible to transform a fan into a generator of electricity and generate up to at least 2.48 volts of electricity.

APPARATUS AND ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR MINIATURE PULSED PLASMA SOURCES
Adam Joseph Bowman
Montgomery Bell Academy, Nashville, TN

Coaxial plasma guns (CPGs) have potential applications as pulsed plasma and radiation sources in a variety of fields but are limited in use due to their cost and complexity. Methods and analysis techniques for CPG operation in low-voltage and low-energy ranges are presented. This project used apparatus developed in previous years' research to investigate the dynamics and applications of propagating plasma wakes. Uncharacterized plasma wake separation was observed at large timescales after the discharge. An optical analysis technique was therefore developed using fiber-optics and photodiodes to study wake kinematics. The gas-dependent propagation speeds observed indicate potential applications for gas analysis or studying plasma and ion mobility. A modified device was designed and modeled for use as an inexpensive gas analyzer, combining a novel linear CPG geometry with the optical systems. A microcontroller interface should allow this device to act as an inexpensive alternative for basic experimental techniques, improving the capabilities of low-budget research institutions and even high school labs.

A COMPARISON OF WIND TURBINE EFFICIENCY
Andrew Garrett Nichols
Saint Clair HIgh School, Saint Clair, MO

With the increased interest in renewable energy and increase in the number of wind turbines coming available on the market, claims of efficiency of different designs have become exaggerated, because the efficiency depends on the design the company is promoting. There are distinct advantages and disadvantages to the different designs. The purpose of this experiment was to see which type of wind turbine design will be the first to produce electrical energy as the wind speed is increased from zero. This experiment was conducted on two different basic designs of the wind turbines: horizontal and vertical. Both were placed in a variable speed wind tunnel where the output voltage was monitored while the wind speed was changed. After multiple tests it was concluded that the horizontal design began producing an output voltage at lower wind speeds than the vertical design.

HARDHIT: A MOTOR VEHICLE CONCUSSION FORCE IMPACT DETECTION SYSTEM
Justin Nicholas Krell
Plankinton High School, Plankinton, SD

Nearly twenty percent of all concussions are directly related to motor vehicle accidents, which occur every 8 seconds in the United States. With this point in mind, I developed the HardHit system. The HardHit system is a device designed to alert medical and first response professionals to possible concussions and traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) that happen as a result of motor vehicle accidents. HardHit is a motor vehicle headrest detection system that uses an infrared proximity sensor and microcontroller along with an accelerometer to track concussion force impacts within motor vehicles. After further development, I updated the HardHit system by incorporating additional sensors throughout the vehicle. The new system uses a data logger to store information and provides real-time information from a motor vehicle accident that can be used to calculate the g-forces experienced. It then compares these g-forces with those levels thought to cause concussions and other types of traumatic brain injuries. Utilizing the HardHit system is easy. Motor vehicle occupants are not required to wear special devices for the system to work. HardHit could help save lives and reduce the consequences of concussions and TBIs by allowing medical professionals to begin diagnosing TBIs within minutes after an accident has occurred.

INFRARED ENERGY
Andrew Joseph O'Neill
Suncoast Community High School, Riviera Beach, FL

The central purpose behind my engineering project was to apply technology to a clean energy source that is able to provide power from any locality on the globe irrespective of positioning and orientation. Moreover, I endeavored to address an increasing demand for power worldwide as global populations rise while simultaneously mitigating the worst effects of climate change elicited by fossil fuels. I first began the project by researching available solar tracking technology and investigated a new approach using photosensitive crystalline sensing elements of pyro-electric sensors. I then designed an apparatus to contain the solar module itself and searched for a way to integrate and adjoin the PIR driven mechanism with the data yielded by the solar cell itself. I finally determined that the best way to create such an apparatus was to employ a processing component known as a filed programmable gate array (FPGA) with an internalized configurable logic block which has the ability to control and modulate the pulse width of each duty cycle and adjust the rotary mechanism accordingly. The project will be able to maintain the constant and optimal angle of 90 degrees with the sun and solar cell, respectively, thus yielding maximum energy storage on an external deep cycle battery.

A NOVEL MODULAR REPULSIVE TYPE HYBRID MAGNETIC BEARING FOR FES SYSTEMS
Zeyu Liu
Sir Winston Churchill High School, Calgary, CANADA

Billions of dollars are invested annually in finding more efficient ways of storing energy. Although technologies for chemical batteries are mature, their drawbacks prevent them from being the most efficient energy storage device. Flywheel Energy Storage (FES) systems store energy as rotational energy. They have many advantages over chemical batteries including a higher energy density, freedom from capacity degradation, and extremely fast recharge. These make them ideal for storing electrical energy for applications that demand large reservoirs of power. However, FES systems can be subject to issues such as energy loss through friction and mechanical instability. This research highlights the construction and testing of an innovative hybrid magnetic bearing designed for FES systems. The device consists of two permanent magnetic bearings, two electromagnetic bearings, and a thrust bearing. The permanent magnet bearings provide most of the levitation while the electromagnetic bearings stabilize the system. A PID control algorithm is used to control the electromagnetic bearing. The whole system is modular which makes it easy for maintenance and expansion. Vibration and force tests demonstrated that the system is mechanically stable and resilient to external forces. It was observed that the bearings have a high degree of stiffness and that the restoring force increases exponentially with the shaft offset. With further development, it is likely that the advantages of this novel magnetic bearing system will increase the viability of FES systems and enable the implementation of these systems as the main source of high capacity energy storage in applications like electric cars.

A HELPING HAND: ENGINEERING AND PROGRAMMING OF A ROBOTIC HAND
Matthew Anthony Campagna
Lancaster Catholic High School, Lancaster, PA

This experiment was designed to invent a functionally independent, that is free of external control units, robotic hand that could be used to aid a human. Voice control would allow the user to command the hand to “open” and “close”, resulting in the appropriate action for the given command. <br><br> The hand was drafted two dimensionally prior to the development of a digital three dimensional model. Final drafts of each component were given to a machinist for production. The components were fabricated from 1080 CQ steel, aluminum, and acrylic respectively. Voice samples for the commands “open” and “close” were programed to an Easy VR voice recognition module. A program was developed, in C programing language, for an Axon II micro-control unit (MCU) in which the voice recognition unit would compare voice commands to the programed samples. The micro-control unit would then command a servo motor to rotate accordingly, thus yielding an “open” or “close” action. Once obtained, the servo and machined components were fastened together and allowed to operate.<br><br> A serial port was used to diagnose problematic sections of the code. After revision, the program operated as designed. Rotation of the servo conveyed the “open” and “close” commands to the corresponding actions. Testing allowed the robotic hand to grasp, hold, and release objects, thus rendering it an effective means of aiding a human.

MEDTRACKER: A SYSTEM TO TRACK AND CONTROL ACCESS TO MEDICATION
Nivedita Khandkar
duPont Manual Magnet High School, Louisville, KY

With the aging population and people living longer due to availability of better medical care, the “sandwich generation” is faced with the problem of providing care to their parent’s generation while at the same time taking care of their children and maintaining a career. Providing care can include ensuring that their parents are taking the correct medication at the right time as well as ensuring that they are not taking multiple doses because they forgot that they had already taken medication, creating a potentially life-threatening situation. <br><br>The goal of this project was to build a radio-frequency identification (RFID) based system to assist in one facet of this issue – ensuring that the parents take medication at the correct time. This involved creating a system using an Arduino to control the lock mechanism of a medicine container so that only valid RFID cards would allow access to the medications. In order to address the issue of overdosing, the system only allows access during valid time intervals. The system also communicates via Bluetooth with a Visual Basic (VB) program on a computer to associate RFID cards with people and to track access details in a database. Another VB program uses SMTP in order to provide ongoing alerts to the caregiver. <br><br>Future developments for this project could include creating fail-safe mechanisms, adding the ability to specify different timeframes for different people, and sending out customized reminders to people.

CHEATING SIGHT: THE EFFECTS OF ELECTRONIC GLASSES ON OBSTACLE NAVIGATION
Vincent Glen Marco
Hartville R-II Schools, Hartville, MO

Existing devices used to assist people are becoming outdated by modern technology. Infrared sensors can be used to give a unique type of vision for visually impaired people. The purpose of this project was to design, develop, and test a pair of glasses that provide navigational assistance to visually impaired people in the cheapest and simplest manner. It was hypothesized that the glasses would allow participants to navigate simple obstacles. Infrared sensors were used to create navigational glasses that interface with a human’s sense of touch via a belt that produced vibrations in correspondence to distances from obstacles. As sensors detected obstacles, the belt vibrated signaling which side the obstacle was on as well as the distance from it. A basic calibration test was performed in which the middle sensor on the glasses was mathematically tested at incremental angles and at varying heights to find the angle that provided the widest range of obstacle detection. In another test, three high school students were blindfolded and told to navigate four obstacles including a flat wall, a corner, a free standing obstacle, and a panoramic enclosure. The amount of time, help needed, and distances from the obstacles were recorded. Data were used to calculate average walking speeds as well as accuracy of obstacle detection. Participants were surveyed to gather perspectives about this technology. In looking for adverse physiological effects, heart rate was taken before and after each testing session. Results from this experiment supported the hypothesis. The glasses would alert the user of an obstacle at consistent distances and allow them to increase their walking speed comfortably without negative physiological effects.

OPTIMISING OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE OF A THERMOELECTRIC GENERATOR
Kyle Francis Leong Willimott
Barker College, Hornsby, AUSTRALIA

Each day 15 trillion watts of waste heat is released to the environment while generating 10 trillion watts of usable energy. If most of this waste heat could be recovered and used through Thermoelectric Generators, significant energy savings and carbon emission reductions could be realised. Thermoelectric power production can conserve resources and impact people globally from an environmental, financial and social perspective.<br><br>The Thermoelectric Generator (TEG) Model II is a portable device designed, built and tested to convert heat energy into usable electrical energy in remote locations. The device operates by using a temperature difference between the TEG’s internal hot and cold plates to generate power. It successfully solves the problem of how to maximise TEG electrical output while minimising heat input requirements and heat losses by considering key scientific and engineering principles in its design - this includes the Seebeck Effect, Reynolds Number, Continuity Equation and Thermal Mapping. Detailed tests, calculations and analyses were conducted to find the optimal design and operational characteristics of the device, determine the validity of the design process and accommodate scaling for commercial applications. Key results include dual mode cooling capability, exceptional control of thermal pathways and a current power output of up to 20 watts. The device recovers and utilises waste heat/cooling, is scalable, portable, has potential to increase its power output and has a wide range of commercial applications. An initial cost benefit analysis of a TEG assembly was conducted and compares favourably with other green energy alternatives such as photovoltaic cells.

DAG [SEE THE SOUND): INNOVATIVE AND INEXPENSIVE, RISKLESS AND PROPER DEVICE THAT HELP DEAF PEOPLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH NORMALS
Aly Abdelfatah Aly
The British Intl. School in Cairo, Cairo, EGYPT

My project design aim to provide convenient mean of communication to deaf people,it will not only help them to interact with voices and sounds,but it also will be engaged with information window to help them to interact and take decision based on a knowledge base.DAG would simply recognise the voices and sounds,and convert them into visual text and meaningful signs on the surface of the glasses through HUD.The voice recognition will be carried through directed integrated microphones and give the indication from where the sounds are coming from.The micro-controller will processes the signals from the microphones to define the sound source and the spot of interest to the user.Afterwards if sound is detected,visual signs would be displayed on the glasses,moreover smooth vibrations would be activated in case of alarm sounds detection.However if voice is detected,the microprocessor would handle the recognition of the different spoken languages and display the translated text accordingly.The software architecture would be an embedded Linux OS that will handle the application.The application will provide a neat and simple graphical interface,and the recognised speech will be displayed as a subtitle over the glasses,the application will also communicate with the trackpad wirelessly,to give the user the freedom to navigate through the software.With an intuitive keyboard,the user will type texts easily,and the typed text will be spoken accordingly.Statistically more than360million are deaf,and the current hearing aids meets less than10%of the global needs.DAG would be the most inexpensive solution,with a cost less than100$which is600times less expensive than the cochlear implants.Moreover,no risks have to be taken;DAG will be a turning solution for the hearing impaired population

SHIPS RESCUE SYSTEM
Ahmed Atef Saber
Lycee la Liberte D'Alexandrie, Alexandria, EGYPT

The project is trying to solve a critical problem that costs the world hundreds of deaths and millions of dollars every year. This problem is ship accidents. The research is preventing the damage caused by three kinds of ship accidents (foundering, collision and contact) which make up nearly 70 % of the accidents. <br><br>On searching in the existing solutions for this problem it was found that the most advanced solution is the ‘double hull’ but the problem is it can’t resist all forces caused by the accidents, so a search was started for a modification for the double hull to be capable of resisting the required forces. The idea for this modification was to dissipate the force generated during the accident by changing its path from vertical to horizontal.<br><br>To carry out this modification research was made on different materials and designs to choose the most convenient one, to be put in the space between the hulls.<br><br>Computer simulation was made to ensure that the layer can resist the needed force. Also, a complete prototype including (a scaled ship, a complete control system and a scaled extra layer) was made to prove all the concepts.<br><br>On testing the prototype it was found that all the system parts worked smoothly and gave the expected outcome.

EASYLIFT
Anielys Marie Matos - Rodriguez
Bonifacio Sanchez Jimenez, Aibonito, PUERTO RICO

The EASYLIFT is a system of four fixed and automatic jacks that are integrated to the automobile. It was created because of the need of reducing the time and effort relative to lifting an automobile to change a tire or in case of an emergency to realize minor mechanical work. Will the EASYLIFT function? The hypothesis is that the EASYLIFT will reduce the time and effort in lifting an automobile to fix any situation such as changing a tire. Investigations were realized about how the characteristics of the product should be. First of all, the mechanics to be utilized with the design were defined. The height of the product should not exceed 12 inches and the width should not exceed 8 inches. The product should have the capacity to support up to 800 pounds and to lift and automobile for at least 9 inches from the ground. EASYLIFT consists of a 12 V motor connected to a gear system that allows for a set of tubes to come down thus lifting the car. EASYLIFT will start functioning when pushing a button that activate the motor. Considering the design and mechanics of the product it was concluded that EASYLIFT will effectively and rapidly lift a car. The hypothesis can be accepted. Future projections are to construct and test this product to commercialize it.

SELF-DIAGNOSING SMART BOLTS TO SAVE YOUR LIFE
Vladislav Sevostianov
Las Cruces High School, Las Cruces, NM

The work presents the concept of self-diagnosing smart bolts and its experimental validation. In the present research such bolts are designed, built, and experimentally tested. As a key element of the design, wires of Galfenol (an alloy of iron and gallium) are used. This material shows magnetostrictive properties, and, at the same time, is sufficiently ductile to follow typical deformation of rock bolts, and is economically affordable. Two types of Galfenol were used: Ga10Fe90 and Ga17Fe83. The wires were installed in bolts using two designs – in a drilled central hole or in a cut along the side - and the bolts were tested for generation of the magnetic field under three-point bending loading. To measure the magnetic field in the process of deformation, a magnetometer that utilizes GMR effect was designed, built, and compared with one utilizing Hall effect. It is shown that (1) magnetic field generated by deformation of the smart bolts at the stress level of plastic deformation is sufficient to be noticed by the proposed magnetometer; however, magnetometer using Hall effect is insufficient; (2) Ga10Fe90 produces higher magnetic field than Ga17Fe83; (3) magnetic field in plastically bended bolts is relatively stable with time.

Alisha Saxena
Interlake Senior High School, Bellevue, WA

When exercising, people need to carry an assortment of fitness tracking and motivational devices that often do not work well together to provide an optimal workout experience. The goal for my research is to investigate whether exercise efficacy can be improved with a device that combines necessary health monitoring and motivational functions, allowing people to maximize the benefits of their workout.<br><br>During my research, I discovered several studies proving that people are able to exercise at higher intensity levels when they match their workout rhythm to the beat of the music. I also researched the correlation between music beats per minute to the workout intensity to classify songs for use with the desired workout pace. <br><br>To leverage the therapeutic benefits of activity-synchronized music, I developed a prototype device using an Arduino microprocessor integrated with health and activity monitoring sensors that upload data to the web for analysis and archival. I programmed the device to automatically monitor users’ activity levels and raise it to the target intensity by motivating them with the appropriate music tempo. This unique capability in my prototype is unmatched by the most sophisticated devices and smartphone applications available in the market today. <br><br>My device successfully validates my research findings and offers sophisticated capabilities for enhancing workout motivation and monitoring. It enables future enhancements by uploading data to the cloud for analysis to offer customized recommendations for workouts and share details with health care providers, friends and family.

SOLAR ENGINE APPLICATIONS
Sean Michael Loken
Wishek High School, Wishek, ND

The purpose of doing a project like this is that the world is dependent on fossil fuels. There are different ways of producing renewable energy. Solar energy is just one of them. For the past two years, I have been developing the GBSE (gate boost solar engine) to become more efficient in the energy that it collects and uses. I believe that the GBSE II will be able to power applications such as a small water pump feature, lighting for a model house, a light-seeking solar platform and a light-seeking power station.<br><br><br>The tests conducted were an average voltage test and engine pulse test. I placed the GBSE II solar engine 20cm and 30cm away from a vertical and a horizontal light source. The lights used include a 100 watt white, red, green, blue, and amber. <br><br><br>I found that the different configurations of the GBSE II were able to perform efficiently with most of the lights at different distances. The least effective lights were typically the blue and green lights, along with red in some experiments. Depending on the demands of the configuration and the distance from the light source would determine how the GBSE II would operate.<br><br><br>I found that the GBSE II was able to power all applications that I had in mind. I found that adding a second GBSE II onto another GBSE II increased the power output and ran the water pump feature and model house almost as if they were being operated by batteries.

HUMAN-LIKE BIPEDAL ROBOTIC SYSTEM UTILIZING DYNAMIC BALANCE AND ADAPTIVE WALKING GAITS
Edward Joseph Hunckler
Marian High School, Mishawaka, IN

Numerous forms of motion can be seen throughout nature. Humans have a unique upright bipedal walk. In order to create robots that more efficiently interact with humans, the robot must move with a human-like bipedal walking gait. The goal of this project is to create a bipedal robot that utilizes dynamic balance by modeling human walking. This was approached by analyzing human walking gaits at various speeds and inclines and developing a relationship between these variables. Next a bipedal robot modeled after human legs and torso was created for testing and analyzing the effectiveness of the walking gait. Finally, stability feedback was incorporated into the program using an accelerometer for automatic feedback. The robot walks utilizing the functions that model the data collected, and it can easily be adapted through adjustments in the functions made by the balance sensors. Research into robotics, in particularly the study of bipedal walking motion, has impacts in many different regions of science. Biped research can help in the understanding of how humans learn to walk. Artificial legs have an impact on prosthetics that has both military and civilian applications. Finally, robotics is an area that is developing quickly and spreading into everyone’s lives.

ROCKET MOTOR TEST SYSTEM 7000
Ryan Russell Maurer
Frazier High School, Perryopolis, PA

The RMTS project was an effort to consolidate the system for testing rocket motors into two components: a test stand and a computer. Research showed that the best method to do this would be to develop custom computer software that would wirelessly communicate with the test stand via a Bluetooth connection. To aid in concentrating all systems into the test stand, a custom load cell was designed and built. For safety and legal purposes, the ignition of the rocket motor was not made wireless. The result was a test stand that could handle rocket motors delivering up to 200lb (890N) with all data acquisition concentrated into the test stand and its computer software companion. The test stand was shaped like a rectangular prism, with base dimensions 9.5in x 8in and a height of 5in. On top of it was a combination motor mount and blast deflector. The test stand accurately and reliably performed as expected.

In the modern world, as always in history, inevitably occur civil war. Retreating mine roads, houses, and those areas where people can step foot. Professional engineers clear of mines in the gangway to move the attacking forces, ie with many mines remain undiscovered. And at these mines are not only killed soldiers but peaceful adults and children. If it were possible to provide civilians with individual means of mine detection, the number of victims would have been much less. In our time, developed a lot of different individual devices to detect metal skih min. P rimenyayutsya robotic engineers for mine detection and clearance, but, as a rule, these devices are expensive. Their cost ranges from thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars. That's why we decided to design and fabricateinexpensive moving robot assistant for civilians capable of detecting metal mines. In peacetime, such a robot can become indispensable to search for treasure. It was decided to design and manufacture the model of the robot - mine detector based on low-cost LEGO-designer with a microcomputer NXT. Make on the basis of the self-propelled trolley design with good maneuverability and easy for her to write a program in NXT or Robolab can any student 12-17 years. But that would make it a robot mine detector, it is necessary to connect it to actually own a minesweeper. Even so, oh, homemade robot minesweeper at some stage detection of mines and explodes, it will perform before its main purpose - to save human life.

USING RESONANT INDUCTIVE COUPLING TO TRANSFER ELECTRICAL POWER WIRELESSLY FOR MIDRANGE APPLICATIONS
Christian James Steinmetz
Hilton Head Preparatory School, Hilton Head Island, SC

The purpose of this project is to use the theory of resonant inductive coupling with LC tuned circuits to achieve an efficient electrical power transfer between two non-contact circuits for powering portable devices at distances less than 1 meter. It was predicted that by the addition of an auxiliary transfer and load coil, the amount of power transferred to the secondary side from 10cm could be increased.<br><br> First the primary and secondary circuits were constructed to enable the two coils to resonate at the same frequency. A function generator was connected to the primary coil which produced a 10 volt peak-to-peak square wave. During the tests the frequency was tuned. Two multimeters were connected to the DC output of the bridge on the secondary load coil to measure the voltage and current over a 1K Ohm load from an increasing distance in increments of 5cm to 30cmm.<br><br> At a distance of 10cm, the average power transferred to the secondary coil without the use of auxiliary coils was 11.881mW. With the addition of auxiliary coils the average power transferred to the secondary coil was 81.976mW. The hypothesis was supported because the auxiliary coils strengthened the coupling between the circuits resulting in a greater power transfer to the secondary coil which would be practical for powering portable devices.<br><br>If stronger coupling can be achieved it is likely that a greater transfer efficiency can be achieved enabling portable devices to be powered more efficiently over distances greater than those demonstrated in this experiment.

Electrical systems are vital nowadays. They are used in almost all fields to assure a comfortable life style.<br><br>Servers for example are important to save and analyze huge amounts of data every second. Internal components of servers heat up very quickly and the cooling system is both very large and energy consuming. Therefore I've conducted experiments on an example of servers ( HP Proliant ML350e gen8) and on mini compressors and refrigeration fluids and then I came up with a new cooling mechanism in which a small aspirator will pull the air and a mini-compressor will compress the fluid ( R134a) then the evaporator will decompress it making it cold afterwards a small ventilator will push cold air through capillary tubes to the exact locations of major heating points (processors,hard disks...) and then it (cold air) will be spread all over the server and then evacuated and this process will continue to function based on temperature increase and stop functioning based on temperature decrease which will be calculated using an imbedded thermometer.

MAN OVERBOARD!
Samuel Wheelhouse
Nottingham High School, Nottingham, UNITED KINGDOM

Man Overboard! Is a marine safety system for use on any ship or yacht. The system detects if any crew members have fallen overboard and alerts the crew members remaining on the ship by using a series of audible and visual alarms. The system will also log and display the position where the crew member fell overboard using GPS. Crew members can be easily taken overboard when working on the deck in rough seas and heavy weather without notice. The system is completely integrated within a lifejacket and is the very first system to do this. By fitting the system within a lifejacket allows innovative charging, storage, lighting and automatic activation methods previously not possible with conventional ‘clip on’ devices. The charging, storage and automatic activation relies on the smart material ‘conductive Velcro’. By using this material in this way makes the system extremely easy to use and eliminates problems related to flat batteries and forgetting to switch the system on since this is all taken care of automatically. Up to 16 individual lifejackets can be used with one head unit. The project was completed on a relatively low budget and is therefore very cost effective and could be used in 3rd world countries.

ENGINEERING A LOW-COST ALTERNATIVE NAVIGATIONAL AID FOR THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED
Brandon Deonte Alfonso Kinard
Mililani High School, Mililani, HI

In June 2012, 285 million people were reported to be visually impaired with 39 million being blind and 246 million having low vision. Additionally, 90% of visually impaired individuals live in developing countries. Knowing this, I wanted to create a device that would be inexpensive and easy to maintain. This lead me to develop a belt which housed fairly inexpensive components such as an Arduino microcontroller, ultrasonic sensors, vibrating motors, an ardumotor, VEX motor controller, and a battery supply. The sensory belt works in a way similar to the way bats find their way through caves – echolocation. The ultrasonic sensors send out a ping and receive an echo back off of an object. Based on the time it takes to receive this response the program can determine how far away an object is by converting time to inches or centimeters. This distance value is then stored in the Arduino. The vibrations then vary in intensity based on a simple calculation of 255 (maximum vibrating speed) – distance*2. This will cause the designated motor to spin slower the further the object is and faster the closer the object is. This will allow the user to determine where an object is and because of the design of the device and it’s hoist (a belt) the user is never required to use their arms saving their energy. Additionally, I have programmed the device to detect crosswalks alerting the user of upcoming streets and have included voltage regulators, a webcam, and a raspberry pi in order to do so.

NON-TACTILE MAZE NAVIGATION
Matthew Brodie Russell
River Ridge Academy Home School, Lexington, KY

Autonomous navigation is an important topic in the field of robotics. The purpose of this project was to develop a robot that can navigate autonomously through an unknown maze without touching any walls while maintaining a link with a remote operator. The maze used was from the National Robotics Challenge Non-Tactile Maze competition for high school students and undergraduates. A robot was constructed for the project using the chipKIT Uno32 development board and was programmed in C. The robot utilizes a wall-following procedure and carries three infrared distance sensors, a dual motor driver, and a bluetooth modem. While in operation, the robot first checks for head-on collisions and executes an emergency maneuver if necessary. Next, it looks for open spaces on the left and right to indicate turns in the maze. If no turns are detected, a wall-following PID algorithm guides the robot through the course. The project was successful and the robot was able to navigate through the maze without collisions with an average speed of about 43 cm/s. In addition, the robot could be monitored via Bluetooth and an Android app running on a tablet device. The app allowed the operator to toggle the robot’s autonomous behavior and assume direct control. Further research may include extending the range of the system as well as adding a wireless camera to provide video feedback. Mapping software may also be implemented. This technology can be applied in many circumstances as a simple, effective mode of autonomous navigation.

The goal of this project is to design and fabricate an affordable upper limb prosthesis that is controlled neurologically. I am using EEG, ECG and blink movement to create a seamless control system that an everyday person can master within a few hours. I am reducing cost by fabricating the arm using an additive manufacturing machine ¬¬¬and creating gearboxes to increase the strength. Users want the prosthetic to function as a real arm and with that come weight and range of movements. During the design phase I simulated stress and movement to make sure the arm is durable enough for everyday use and can still have a human like range of movements. The main motor type I’m using to actuate the arm is servos. This makes electronics simpler and smaller and also coding easier and more accurate. The arm is all self-contained meaning that power and the electronics are all within the arm. I am using a Teensy microcontroller as the brain of the arm as well as amplifier circuits and Bluetooth receivers. To control the arm the user flexes a muscle to enter a selections state. Once there, they use a series of blinking to select pre-loaded movements such as hand, elbow or wrist movement. Once a movement is selected the EEG headset measure attention/focus which controls the movement. Based on the user I can tailor the control system to whatever we find works the best for that person.

CONTINUOUS REAL-TIME MONITORING, DETECTION, ALERT OF TRANSIENT CARDIAC ABNORMALITIES UTILIZING ELECTROCARDIOGRAPH CIRCUIT AND ANDROID-BASED ANALYSIS WITH COMMUNICATION THROUGH WIRELESS NETWORKS
Andrew Wei Chen
Beaverton High School, Beaverton, OR

Cardiac disorders are the leading cause of death throughout the world. Without continuous monitoring of the heart’s condition, many time-critical and latent transient cardiac abnormalities are left unnoticed, not being manifested during hospital testing. This study sought to develop and prototype a continuous and real-time cardiac monitoring, detection, and alert system utilizing an electrocardiograph circuit outputting to an Android smartphone, which would perform waveform analysis and communicate through wireless networks upon abnormality detection. Categorized components of development involved analog amplification of minute transthoracic electrical voltages from the depolarization and repolarization of the cardiac system, analog-to-digital conversion of electrical signals into amplitude arrays and subsequent frequency-based band-stop filtration through Fast Fourier Transformation, software interpretation and comparison of the processed data sequence to predefined references, and wireless transmission of alerts and notifications upon applicational detection of cardiac abnormalities through SMS and SMTP. Multiple ECG circuits were explored, with the final prototype employing three leads - two transthoracic attachments for electrical observation, and a third for body bias and stabilization utilizing VDD/2. The prototype was evaluated using statistical analysis, which found no significant difference concerning distortion and precision between input/output of the amplification circuitry. The implications of this study are twofold. First, the monitoring mechanism is portable and affordable for continuous usage. Second, it provides for the proactive detection at the onset of otherwise unnoticed heart diseases, as well as immediate response to possible cardiac failure.

BIOMETRIC ELECTROMECHANICAL FIREARM SAFETY
Kai Thorin Kloepfer
Fairview High School, Boulder, CO

Firearms in the wrong hands result in catastrophic and unintended effects. The number of preschoolers killed by firearms is nearly double the number of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty during 2008-09. In addition, 10% of police-related deaths by firearms are officers disarmed in combat and killed with their own firearm.<br><br>The solution I invented, designed, constructed, and tested is a biometric electromechanical system that permits only registered users, for example parents or officers, to fire a firearm. Fingerprint recognition uniquely identifies registered users to lock or unlock a firearm. The electrical system receives input from the fingerprint sensor and, when a user is authenticated, it drives a small piezo motor that actuates my mechanical locking mechanism to drive a pin into the firing mechanism. Electrical, mechanical and biometric systems are integrated into the firearm to create a functional system transparent to authenticated users. <br><br>Creating multiple prototype versions allowed testing and improvement of the systems. Design and assembly of PCB versions resolved circuit issues and streamlined design. Mechanical system revisions tested materials and functionality. Obtaining models of my CAD files produced using additive manufacturing techniques finalized placement and fit of electrical, mechanical, and biometric systems and allowed testing system integration. The completed prototype illustrates systems adaptable to many types of firearms. <br><br>System engineering and design is complete. My final design is successful and proves the concept. The biometric control, integrated into a firearm, allows registered personnel to use the firearm normally while preventing use by unauthorized users.<br><br>

ROCKET ASSISTED CONSERVATION USING NEAR-INFRARED
Draven Ray Sims
Hart County High School, Munfordville, KY

Infrared light is electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths longer than visible light but shorter than radio waves. It is one of many forms of rays in the electromagnetic field. The electromagnetic Spectrum consists of Infrared light, visible light, gamma rays, radio waves, X-rays, ultraviolet light, and microwaves. My project is the study of Near Infrared and Visible light and how we can use it to indicate healthy and unhealthy foliage or vegetation. I plan to be able to take aerial photos of dense populations of trees that may be infested with disease or trees and track possible infestation patterns. The latter will be Phase two of this project, which I will be gathering the data for this summer. <br><br> First I modified mini wireless digital video cameras to record near-infrared light. This was accomplished by removing the IR filter on the lenses and adding a filter to block visible light. I have another camera recording in visible light for comparison. Next I started recording data by comparing live and dead or unhealthy vegetation by taking still photos in both near infra red and visible light to compare chlorophyll reflectivity and have determined that healthier foliage reflects brighter in the Near Infrared bands. I have begun developing a half scale model of my flight vehicle to use as a test bed for flight testing for my cameras for the second phase of this experiment, which will begin this summer.

EYERINATOR: A NEW VISION
Jyoti Ranjan Sahoo
D.A.V Public School, Unit-8, Bhubaneswar, Bhubaneswar, INDIA

The purpose of my device is to enhance the field of vision available to the glaucoma, retinitis pimentosa and low vision patients. Since, there are many medicines to arrest the disease but no successful medicine/device as yet to enhance the vision. The device “Eyerinator” has been developed to be a vision enhancer, for patients to do their day to daywork conveniently. The scene is focused by a lens through a color filter array onto an image sensor which converts incident light into an equivalent electronic signal. The converted electronic output goes through analog signal processing blocks such as correlated double sampling (CDS), automatic gain control(AGC), analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) and a significant amount of digital processing for color, image enhancement and compression. All the control functionalities are done by a microcontroller whereas the image manipulation is taken care of by a DSP block. The video to be captured can be stored in the memory or it can be transmitted to the display. The captured image is then processed so that the whole image can be brought within the patients’ visual field and they can get improved visual perception about their surroundings. The user has to wear the device, turn it on, and then he can get a better vision in the same field of vision available. The device gives better ratio accuracy due to its mobility hence it is able to give the best result. The best part of the device is that it is good at navigation which is most required for the patients to commute. This device costs about $60 which is very affordable. Thus, Eyerinator being simple, compact, comfortable, and innovative will be the best vision enhancer for the patients to carry out their day to day tasks as there is no such device available yet.

CREATING A DESIGN PROCESS FOR A REMOTELY OPERATED VEHICLE (R.O.V. UNDERWATER ROBOT) WITH SPEED AND MANEUVERABILITY AS THE KEY FACTORS FOR PERFORMANCE
Zachariah I. Spencer
WEB Dubois Environmental High School, Baltimore, MD

Remotely Operated Vehicles is one of the fastest growing technology and engineering industries in the world. The need for cost effective R.O.V.’s is essential for providing the growing industry with its most essential needs. Pressure vs. depth for any R.O.V.’s is one of the challenges when considering factors such as structural integrity and the performance ability of the R.O.V.’s. Limiting factors from the structural designs will offset depth capacity, speed, and maneuverability of the R.O.V. Experimentation from the design process presented with this research with a hypothesis of speed and maneuverability could be achieved by modifications with emphasis to place on motor propulsion capacity and motor angles to each other motor on the R.O.V.’s. The performance factor with speed and maneuverability were measured based upon the motor designs and angle location of motors to each other. Three hundred and sixty (360) degrees maneuverability is a primary function and requirement of R.O.V., so therefore the angles of the motors along with propulsion capacity is essential to the design process. This research presented findings that will greatly enhance fundamental design process that will allow engineers to develop a cost effective approach to design and build R.O.V.’s.

A BETTER WORLD
David Jean Abou Kors
Antonine Sisters School, Ghazir, LEBANON

The world has become a frightful place. Even after both World Wars, peaceful coexistence remains threatened by weapons of mass destruction and a full-blown nuclear war. However, this threat arises partially from the excess usage of radioactive material in nuclear reactors as well as the plutonium waste engendered from this procedure. This experiment aims to remedy this problem and also increase the efficiency of nuclear reactors by substituting the turbine-based power system in these reactors with a pressurized piston-based scheme thus boosting the amount of energy amassed.<br><br>Throughout the four generations of nuclear reactors, a turbine was utilized to produce electricity from the steam generated in a nuclear reactor. The past year was fraught with extensive research on this subject and I have come to the conclusion that it is possible to improve the power generation system rather than the heat efficiency and thereby produce exponentially larger quantities of energy from the same amount of nuclear material. A piston was placed on top of the vat of water and this caused the canister to store pressure and raise the piston which turned several cogs to generate electricity. Calculations were made as to the pressure and the energy created and I have proved that the release of this pressure into other similar canisters would multiply the energy produced.<br><br>The principle as a whole can be used in several other power systems including hydropower factories and cars. The structure proposed is unique and groundbreaking and can revolutionize the future of power generation.

Fundacao Escola Tecnica Liberato Salzano Vieira da Cunha, Novo Hamburgo, BRASIL

Brazil has about 35,791,488 million people with visual needs (IBGE, 2010). To minimize difficulties of accessibility in everyday life of these people was proposed on this research, a home automation application addressing the development of a domotic control with function trigger residential loads. The possibility to promote accessibility and mobility for these people in different spaces is the purpose of using a wireless system via RF communication, who attended suggestions coming from people who have visually impaired in an informal interview. The tool used was the development kit eZ430-RF2500 from Texas Instruments, due to features such as the possibility of alternative use in different locations using the frequency band of 2.4 GHz, with the program written in C language, representing a technological advantage of low cost. There is a possibility of modification or updating of programmed commands, simply access the configuration code and an USB port on a PC computer. Each sensor (phototransistor) of the remote control has a different embossed Braille, providing the drive and disengagement of a load. Each state is represented by one or two beeps. Once is completed the schedules in the microcontroller, boards are installed and made the necessary connections in the desired loads. It was made a simulation model representing a residence and the actual installation in the laboratories of the course of Electrotechnical in our school. The final step is the presentation of mockup to disabled respondents, just as the operating manual in Braille and audio description on CD, for analysis and final conclusion, giving greater autonomy to the user.

ORIENTATION AND SAFETY SYSTEM DEVICE FOR VISUALLY IMPAIRED PEOPLE
Kevin Arnoldo Perez-Calvo, Mariana Quesada-Morera
Colegio Tecnico Don Bosco, San Jose, COSTA RICA

Individuals with visual impairment are unable to anticipate some of the surrounding elements that can impede their movement, thus they experience a sense of insecurity and frequent mobilization difficulties in their daily life. This project developed an electronic device that detects surrounding obstacles and provides a greater sense of self-confidence and a real safety solution while walking.<br><br>In this day and age there are only a very few devices that meet some of the demands and needs of this population regarding their mobilization. That is why this work is aimed at designing and building a solution for visually impaired individuals by integrating two systems that provide direction. The first one is located on the user’s head to issue audio warnings when objects are near his/her surroundings. The second one is a hand device that identifies obstacles at the lower body level through vibrating alerts. Additionally, the device is able to send text messages with the coordinates from a built-in GPS to third parties interested in the wellness and whereabouts of the user. <br><br>Both devices incorporate an ultrasonic sensor and a microcontroller. A software program was developed to give instructions to the microcontroller to measure the distance between the user and the obstacles. This software also collects the GPS data and communicates to the caretaker through a text message the location of the user .<br><br>The device and its systems were progressively improved by working with a specialized educator for people with visual impairments, and trying the device with a person with visual impairment. This experience positively helped on risk identification, ergonomic design and conducting a comparison between the prototype and other more traditional methods.

INJURY-FREE BED FOR BEDRIDDEN PATIENTS
Ulises Jesus Sanchez-Garcia, Brandon Segura-Torres, Jean Carlo Fernandez Alfaro
Colegio Tecnico Profesional Jesus Ocana Rojas, Alajuela, COSTA RICA

Pressure Ulcers (PUs) are sores in the body that are formed in patients with prolonged immobility due to the pressure the body exerts on certain areas of the skin. In order to reduce this problem, a hammock - bed was created based on Pascal’s Principle “At higher area, less pressure” that is capable of reducing the pressure in those areas, providing benefit to the patient’s ergonomics and facilitating the work of the caregiver. <br><br>Using the theory learned in the previous Project, the hammock - bed is built; the hammock is raised with 4 pins situated on each bed support, providing more stability to the patient when suspended, with respect to the mattress. A Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) was used to automate the ascent and descent; a hammock was used since it has the ability of easily adapting to the ergonomics of the body.<br><br>It was concluded that the hammock is the most appropriate method unlike others used, because the patient is kept ergonomically comfortable, ventilated at an adequate temperature and humidity to prevent PUs. Also, the PLC accurately manages the cycles according to the times established and recommended by the doctor. <br><br>As the electromechanical design produces noise that can cause patient’s discomfort, a pneumatic device was implemented. This device is much quieter; the pins were changed and pistons were installed, and instead of using a stepping motor, it uses air pressure.

CAR SEAT SENSOR BATTLING CHILD NEGLECT
Ariel Morisa Keller, Karina Skov
Alden-Conger High School, Alden, MN

Our purpose was to create a device that would detect when a child’s car seat has been buckled and relay that information to a wireless receiver that warns the driver once they are a specific distance away from the car seat. Our hypothesis was this would be achieved by placing the sensor inside the buckle.<br><br><br> We placed a reed sensor into the buckle of the car seat and magnets into the prongs of the buckle. The magnets activated the reed sensor when the car seat was buckled. Then, we connected the sensor to a modified dog containment fence and a power supply. The receiver that the parent carried synced with the transmitter when the car seat was buckled and the receiver beeped once it was too far away from the transmitter.<br><br><br> We tested the device with no interferences, cement wall interference, cell phone interference, radio interference, a cell phone and radio interference, and interference of a purse. Our results showed the longest activation distance of 18 meters with no interference. The shortest activation distance was 3 meters when the receiver was in a purse. The most consistent activation distance was 7 meters with both cell phone and radio interference.<br><br><br> In conclusion, our hypothesis was correct because we were able to create a sensor that consistently beeped when it exceeded the sensing limits. The device still worked in the presence of the interferences, though the activation distance was shorter, and became even more consistent due to the presence of carrier waves.

TECHNOLOGY OF DC SUPPLY IN FAMILIES
Peiwen Liu, Shuailin Lu, Yutong Liu
NorthEast Yucai School, Shenyang, CHINA

Nowadays, the electricity supply in families is only limited to providing alternate current(AC) which far exceeds the safe voltage. But currently many small electronic appliances mainly adopt DC supply. According to our statistics, only less than 30% of family-use electric appliances rely on AC.<br><br> Recently DC/DC technology witnesses an incredible development and the efficiency has increased enormously to about 96%, in contrast with AC/DC, that is only about 85%. Therefore, we develop a brand new technology which combines DC power supply with solar power. As a result, the efficiency of energy conversion increases via eliminating the intermediate conversion from solar DC to AC as well as the AC/DC conversion. Intelligent management is achieved in our DC supply system by utilizing MCU technology. The system also provides USB and other general ports . Meanwhile, DC supply can stimulate and facilitate the popularization of LED application with its simplified driving. <br><br> The application of such technology combining DC supply and solar power can reduce the demand of adapter enormously. Consequently, resources consumption is reduced and energy efficiency is improved.

Printers are one of the most important devices in our daily life. However, traditional printers are often high-volume because the integration of ink cartridges and print head. They are big, heavily and not suitable for portable application. A new printing technology without ink cartridges and print head is developed in the paper. The idea is to develop a thermal-photo sensitive material which combining the thermal sensitive and photo sensitive materials. The material was made into microcapsule and painted on ordinary paper. When the paper is exposed to heat, the paper will change its color. The color will be stabilized when exposed to the UV light. The paper can present an image if the paper is selectively exposed to heat and UV light. Based on this technology, the first generation super thin printer is developed. The printed paper by the new printing device was tested at high temperature( 60°C，3 hours). Testing results showed that the printing resolution is high and the image is clear and stable after long time. The thickness of the first generation prototype is within 20mm. With further optimization, the thickness can be reduced to 10mm. The new printing device is low-cost and is adapted to integrate into PC or mobile phone devices.<br><br>Key words: thermal sensitive, photo sensitive, super thin, printer <br><br>

The purpose of this project is to provide blind people with an electronic system which helps them move in the streets.<br><br>A high percentage of blind people become seriously injured when navigating outdoors, even with the assistance of walking sticks. This is because low-hanging objects like marquees or awnings cannot be detected by a walking stick. <br><br>Currently, most blind people are limited to touching the walls of buildings and shops with their walking sticks when out for a walk.<br><br>This system includes a walking path in the centre of sidewalks designed for blind people so that they can move easily in the streets. The path is recognized by a reflective sensor. The system also proposes an ultrasound detector to detect objects placed at a level over people’s waist, at a distance of two meters. Both sensors can communicate with a pre–programmed microcontroller.<br><br>In order to let users know when an object is close to them or when they move out of the path, the system includes a Bluetooth module, capable of connecting with any kind of mobile phone. The module sends two audible messages: obstacle and get out of the path.<br><br>This system is wireless, portable, and it can be configured on articles like walking sticks, caps, belts, or pendants.<br><br>It is compatible with any phone running the Android operating system.

In our city, there are only two multisensory rooms which are used by people with disabilities. These rooms help disabled people awaken the senses and relax. They also stimulate patients making them respond to stimulus whether physical or psychological. Moreover, they create an atmosphere of therapist-patient and patient-environment, and help patients’ develop capabilities which allow openness to the world of the senses and emotions.<br><br>Problem:<br><br>The final cost of construction of such rooms is too high for the institutions, and the handling of the different environments (ball players, sensitive rugs, and bubble machines among others). It is complicated for the therapist to work with the patient, which requires the presence of more than a person in the same room.<br><br>Objective:<br><br>To build two automated multisensory rooms for patients with disabilities for therapeutic and relaxation purposes.<br><br>Product:<br><br>In the two rooms, there are 10 different sensory spaces-such as a rug that stimulates sensory motor and a diffuser which stimulates the sense of smell, among other. The different sensory spaces are controlled from the outside through a switch panel, which turn them on or off. Each space allows the therapist to interact with the patient directly, without worrying about the switch panel which depends on the external operator.<br><br>Conclusions:<br><br>Comparing this prototype with others, the AMSR is cheaper than the others. Its simplicity allows anyone to operate the panel, which allows the therapist to create different environments to interact with patients with different capacities.<br><br>

ABCS: AUTOMATIC BUOYANCY CONTROL SYSTEM
Omer Granek, Idan Sharon
Hof HaCarmel Comprehensive School, Ma'agan Michael, ISRAEL

Purpose<br><br>A scuba diver must control his buoyancy in order to achieve equilibrium throughout his underwater movement. Buoyancy control is done by manual inflation and deflation of a "Buoyancy Compensator" with air. It is a skill scuba divers struggle to master. Poor buoyancy control is one of the major factors in many fatal diving accidents. Furthermore, standard buoyancy control equipment requires proficient manual operation, which results in lack of efficiency and accessibility.<br><br>Procedures Used <br><br>We developed a novel system that automatically controls the buoyancy of the diver without any user interface. The system evaluates the state of the diver: whether ascending, descending or maintaining a certain depth. In correlation with this evaluation a control signal is produced and sent to the inflation or deflation valves of the system. The control signal formulation, although based on it, differs from classical control loop formulation because it allows a greater freedom; the diver can apply an induced input (i.e. swimming upwards or downwards) and the system controls the buoyancy appropriately.<br><br>Results<br><br>We ran numerical simulations of the entire system and performed an experimental dive with the system, in which the vertical velocity of the diver was measured. In both cases, an overdamped response with small inaccuracy and noise.<br><br>Conclusions <br><br>The strong agreement between results from simulations and experiment confirm that our system works properly. This is a low-cost system and it is easily attached to the Buoyancy Compensator. Furthermore, the formulation may be transferred to analogical environments to construct similar systems.

AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF SURFACE DIMPLING EFFECTS ON POLARA’S GOLF BALL TRAJECTORY
Brice Nelson Plein, Nicholas Whitcomb
Burlington Community High School, Burlington, IA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine if the Polara golf ball depression pattern would decrease a slice up to 75%. It was hypothesized that the surface composition of the Polara golf ball would have an effect on the ball’s trajectory, producing a straighter flight pattern than the regular golf ball, but not to a 75% reduction in slice. First, a device was designed, engineered, and built that could consistently hit the balls the same way. Once this was finished, testing could begin. Next, the regular ball was hit down range. During the ball’s flight, time of ball flight was recorded. After the ball landed, the angle of the slice was measured using two ropes that were both attached to the point at which the ball was hit. Before testing occurred, the first rope was lined up and staked in a straight line down range to show where the ball would be hit if no slice was present. The second rope was then pulled tight to where the ball landed and the angle of slice was measured using a protractor. This process was then repeated for the Polara ball. This system of hitting and measuring was one trial. This was then repeated for a total of 30 trials. It was concluded that the Polara ball did reduce the slice in comparison to the control ball; however, the ball only reduced the amount of slice by 41.26% on average instead of the specified 75.00% and the reduction was fairly inconsistent.

This science fair project builds upon 2011-2012 research to create a total-solar strategy for complete disconnection from fossil-fuels and nuclear energy. The following sections are all new areas explored for 2013.<br><br> The first-section used solar-oven technology to double the temperature of the air generated by our solar heater. To double the area of light concentration and double the Delta_T (Delta_Temperature), solar-concentrator mirrors were constructed using flat cardboard and aluminum foil. We used concepts in Physics, Geometry, and Trigonometry in our research project. The second-section described the use of a Double-Throw/Double-Pole switch to selectively store to, or use stored electricity from, a 12 volt rechargeable battery. We tested and used the stored energy in lighting a 12 volt lamp. <br><br> The data collected was Delta_T which was twice the Delta_T measured in 2012 without solar concentrator mirrors. The entrance temperature T1 of ambient air and exit temperature T5 of the heated air were measured at the same time. We doubled the area of light collection by the use of solar-concentrator mirrors and we correspondingly doubled Delta_T.<br><br> We doubled the efficiency of our solar heater, as measured by Delta_T=T5-T1, by using solar-concentrator mirrors to funnel more light into the solar heater. The solar-concentrator mirrors are solar-oven technology and we employ them to double the collection area of sunlight. We were able to use some solar generated electricity to recharge a 12 Volt VRLA battery for night time lighting and, separately, for cellphone recharging.

HIGH FREQUENCY RESONANT TRANSFORMER
Henry William Love, Julian Thomassie
Yorktown High School, Arlington, VA

The purpose of this project was to learn the theory behind the operation of a resonant transformer and to successfully build a medium sized Tesla coil. A tesla coil is a high frequency resonant transformer that generates large plasma arcs by increasing the voltage of the input current in two steps. The first step is the neon sign transformer which increases the standard 120V of a household wall outlet to 9 kV. This current charges a bank of capacitors whose stored energy is discharged across a spark gap which travels through the primary coil. As the current flows through the primary coil, it creates a large magnetic flux. The changing magnetic field induces a voltage in the secondary coil. This induced voltage is stored in the top load until it reaches full capacitance and discharges into the air. Soon after this happens, the magnetic field collapses and the arc goes back into the top load and down the secondary coil to the RF ground. As the magnetic field collapses, a voltage is induced in the primary coil which then recharges the capacitors. Since the primary and second LC circuits are tuned to the same resonant frequency, a much larger voltage output than a non-resonant transformer can be achieved. The overall design is original and unique. Before beginning construction, a set of calculations was performed to determine what specifications of each component were necessary. All of the safety features that seemed necessary in the circuit were included to ensure safe operation.

COUNTER IED COMMUNICATION USING NEAR FIELD MAGNETIC INDUCTION
Hayden Douglas Dobyns, Brennan Burnett
Pleasant Grove High School, Pleasant Grove, UT

Every year IEDs cause thousands of American casualties.<br><br> A common type of IED is the RCIED (remote controlled improvised explosive device), which insurgents will bury under roadways and detonate when a U.S. military convoy passes.<br><br> RCIEDs are detonated using radio transmitters, so the U.S. military employs radio frequency jammers to disrupt communication between the transmitter and the RCIED. However, soldiers within a convoy are unable to communicate while the radio-jamming signal is active.<br><br> A feasible way to circumvent this communication breakdown is to communicate using near field magnetic induction (NFMI). NFMI relies on the transmission and reception of magnetic fields, not radio waves used in traditional communication systems.<br><br> One challenge with this solution is that the energy emitted from the radio jammer can interfere with the NFMI receiver. However a shield encasing the NFMI receiver could solve this problem.<br><br> The goal of this project is to design a shield to allow magnetic communication while impeding radio waves.<br><br> Three shielding designs were tested: a solid steel sheet, a perforated aluminum sheet, and a copper wire mesh. Our goal was to reduce eddy currents, increase radio wave absorption, and allow for unimpeded magnetic field penetration. <br><br> Each successive shield prototype more fully reached the project’s goal. The final design was the most effective at shielding radio waves, yet allowed for an NFMI link distance 210% greater than the other configurations.<br><br> The result of our project suggests that one could allow NFMI communication within military convoys while simultaneously jamming radio waves to defeat RCIEDs

DEVELOPING A HEAT EXCHANGER BETWEEN A DRYER AND A GEOTHERMAL SYSTEM
Jacob Kyle Reeves, Brant Blaha
Avon High School, Avon, SD

Have you ever wondered how efficient your dryer is? Much of its heat is lost through an exhaust vent. Our goal was to capture this heat and convert it into energy that can be retrieved by an existing geothermal system. <br><br>We coiled copper tubing and placed one of the coils in a metal exhaust vent and attached it to the back of a dryer. The other coil was placed in a box of sand to serve as a release point for the dryer heat. The two coils were connected by a piece of vinyl tubing and a small fountain pump was used to circulate the water through the system. The circulating water removed the heat from the exhaust vent, successfully storing the heat from the dryer in the sand which is analogous to a geothermal system. By knowing the mass and specific heat of the sand and the water, we calculated that our heat exchanger utilized a significant fraction of heat generated by the dryer. This heat could potentially be used in a geothermal system. <br><br>We continue to calculate how these results will influence the efficiency of a geothermal system as we make improvements to our design. If our heat exchanger is commercially successful, it could be incorporated into a geothermal system, a heating pad for a pet, or other applications requiring low-level heat.

Isamar Cartagena, Katherine Fernandez
IE Juan Nepomuceno Cadavid, Itagui, COLOMBIA

According to statistics provided by the National Institute of Deaf People "INSOR", the hearing impaired represents the 17.3% of the total population in Colombia. They become potential victims of car accidents, since they can rarely identify alerting sounds such as horns, sirens, screams, or so. <br><br>For this reason, and because as investigators with hearing impairments we live this kind of situations in a daily basis, we designed and constructed the device "VIBRASOR”, which receives audio signals such as the horn of a vehicle (motorcycle or car) or a person’s voice 10 meters around, and returns a light and vibration signal. <br><br>Electronic elements were used to build the device: protoboard, microphones, filters, capacitors and chips for assembly and subsequent trials. Then, Vibrasor was calibrated using an oscilloscope to set a frequency of 700 Hz, the value reported in the literature. After assembling the device, surveys were conducted with 20 people with hearing impairments, to evaluate the effectiveness and usability of Vibrasor. As an outcome of the surveys, we found out that it was considered to be accurate to rapidly alert deaf people in a risky situation, it was comfortable and it was considered a very useful device. <br><br>VIBRASOR is a versatile device that performs the functions for which it was built and also serves as an accessory. It is presented as a practical alternative, which supports people who are deaf or hearing impaired, lowering the risk of suffering different types of accidents.

Bolts and nuts are used in tightening mechanical parts and structures from bridges to escalators. However due to vibration and movement, bolts and nuts can be loosened and may cause detrimental accidents.<br><br>At present, spring washers and nylon locking nuts are the most common devices for preventing bolts from loosening, however they are not readily detectable with naked eyes when they fail to being tightened. Based on simple frictional mechanics and spring principle, the “Smart Alert Washer” is invented which is designed to give immediate warning when a bolt is loose. <br><br>The “Smart Alert Washer” consists of two thin washers fixed together. The upper washer is an ordinary solid ring-shaped washer while the lower washer is of the same size and shape with a small segment cut out. This small segment acts as the “warning signal” with a spring loaded wire.<br><br>When the bolt is tightened, the segment of the lower washer with the spring wire under tension forming a complete part, and the upper washer completely covers the lower washer appearing like an ordinary single washer. However, when the bolt is loosened, the segment will spring away and give instantaneous warning signal. <br><br>In our prototype, when the tightening force of the bolt is less 10 N, the segment will spring out, alerting the user to carry out maintenance immediately.

Chong Chung Chow, Tsz Him Wong, Chung Shun Steven Yuen
Ju Ching Chu Secondary School (Yuen Long), Hong Kong, HONG KONG

Wind energy has been used for centuries. Modern wind turbines are categorized as Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWT) and Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWT). <br><br><br> This project dwells on the implementation of an alternate configuration of a wind turbine for generating electricity. Applying the magnetic repulsion, involute spiral turbine blades are fitted on a vertical shaft and suspended on magnets as a replacement for ball bearings. Power will then be generated with an axial flux generator, which incorporates the use of permanent magnets and a set of coils.<br><br><br> The turbine is designed to be omni-directional, which performs well even in low and uneven wind conditions. The triple involute spiral-vaned configuration increases the power output significantly because it diverts the wind mass inward to perform work on the sails and continuously changing its direction of travel through laminar flow over much greater surface area vanes, allowing maximum extraction of wind energy. The maglev system can greatly reduce the noise and vibration during operation, allowing it being installed even in built-up residential area. The heavy generator and gearbox is placed below the turbine giving it easier accessibility.<br><br><br> Performance tests carried out using a strong blower and an anemometer gave results of which the unit’s maximum efficiency of up to 31% can be attained at wind speed of 10.1 m/s.<br><br>The average power output of the unit is 9 kWh, giving it a total output of 216 kWh per day, which is sufficient for powering the lighting and ventilation in corridors of public areas.

DETECTION OF HEAVY METALS THROUGH THE USE OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SENSORS
Grey Groulx Braybrooks, Samuel Wachowski
Kalamazoo Area Mathematics and Science Center, Kalamazoo, MI

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effectiveness of printed electrochemical sensors at detecting varying concentrations of the heavy metals mercury and cadmium in standardized solutions. To achieve this, eight different concentrations of each metal ranging from 1 picomolar to 100 millimolar solutions were tested by applying 1 mL of the solution to the sensor, and then running two different tests using the PARSTAT cell and analyzer. These tests were cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, or powersine tests, which are explained in greater detail in the body. In addition, two different types of printed sensors were used, an inkjet printed sensor and a screen printed sensor. The differences between these will be explored in greater detail with the PARSTAT tests. Graphs plotted from the PARSTAT data allow for a comparison of each sensor's detection of the varying metal concentrations, and a final analysis of data will allow for a determination of the limit to the acuity of the sensors based on differences observed between the graphs. Detection precision down to 100 nanomolar seems plausible at this time, which would allow for a broad range of applications for these sensors in detection of cadmium and mercury. Possible applications of these sensors include detection of concentrations of these heavy metals in groundwater samples, or, through a refined method, the detection of higher levels of mercury and cadmium in the blood samples of hemodialysis patients as a precursor to infection. The benefit of printed sensors to that of more conventional detection methods lies in the low cost and reproducibility of sensor production and testing.

Given the growing demand for home-grown, fresh and clean food as well as the increasingly hectic pace of modern life, the purpose of this study is to automate the original aquaponics system and look deeper into its usability and feasibility.<br><br>The comprehensive system is a prototypical automatic system attached to a basic aquaponics one. After features of fish and vegetables are studied, conditions for both species to develop are experimented and built. Solutions to arising problems are implemented and gradually innovated. After each innovation, products’ data are collected and analyzed to develop a better system. An artificial environment based on sensed, analyzed and fixed (if required) necessary environmental data is created and monitored by a set of equipment with cooperative sensors (thermoelectric cooler with LM35, SMS communicator, etc.). <br><br>Results are significant after 6 months of experimenting and innovating manifest in the system’s high productivity (Tilapia (fish) reach 450g in 5 months, Indian mustard - grow 320mm in a month), water quality (tested by different institutes and companies), low cost (85.7 USD), low power consumption, accurate data values, positive survey results (99.4% of 500 respondents support the implementation of such a system). Above all, the significance of the experiment is the success of implementing an automatic environmental control system to monitor living conditions for fish and vegetables, which is time- and-labour-saving.<br><br>In brief, the feasibility of an automatic aquaponics system is proven. However, further research is needed to fully automate the system and adapt it to other fields.

ABLATION RESISTANCE AND PERFORMANCE OF METALS IN MAGNETOPLASMADYNAMIC APPLICATIONS
Michael Douglas Sherburne, Andres Artze
James W. Robinson Junior Secondary School, Fairfax, VA

The purpose was to investigate the affects plasma has on different materials, and determine which material has the best performance and vitality if it were to be used in an ion engine, plasma shielding, or other electromagnetic plasma applications. The purpose was developed from the previous year's research where there was a noticeable downward trend in the distances the plasma travelled. The hypothesis is that stainless steel will have the best resistance to ablation due to a high specific heat capacity of .51 (KJ/Kg K) and a high density. Copper will have the best performance because of its physical properties to conduct current efficiently at 89.5 %IACS. Data was collected by using an apparatus that accelerates plasma, which may damage certain materials. The firing device was built with a CNC machine to allow it to exchange and secure rods easily, and decrease random error. The data collected supports the hypothesis of copper having the best performance, but does not support the hypothesis of stainless steel having the best resistance against ablation. It was determined that the average change of mass was proportional to the specific heat capacity squared. Aluminum's specific heat capacity of .91 KJ/Kg K was important in given it the best resistance against ablation, thus making it better than stainless steel. The applications of this experiment in magnetoplasmadynamic thrusters, plasma sprayers, and other applications accelerating plasma. The experiment shows that cooling systems or high specific heat capacity materials would increase the reliability of these applications.

ADVANTAGES OF A BENT ARM TREBUCHET VS. A STRAIGHT ARM TREBUCHET
Sean Christopher Kruzner, Elishua Lo, Eric Johnson
Chapin High School, Chapin, SC

Through physical experimentation it was discovered that bending the arm of the trebuchet increased its range. A hypothesis was developed that an optimal angle would be present to maximize throwing distance. In addition to changing the angle of the arm, the arm length and sling length would be optimized for each bend configuration.<br><br>The principle of this project involves the conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy. Bending the arm of the trebuchet allowed for an increase in potential energy. However, too large of a bend will result in the weight preventing the arm from moving. It is these observations that resulted in our hypothesis.<br><br>The initial straight arm design was developed using Trebuchet Simulator V2.2 which represented our control design. The range of fire for the different bent arm configurations were found using the simulation tool Working Model 2D. For a given arm bend, an arm length was optimized. The sling length was varied from 80% to 120%. Throwing distance was recorded and the maximum was noted. The arm length was also varied from 90% to 140% of the initial straight design. Arm bend angles were tested at 0, 10, 20 and 30 degrees using Working Model 2D simulation tool. <br><br>An optimized configuration was found that did maximize the throwing distance, which was 68% greater than the initial straight arm design.

DEVELOPMENT OF AN ANTHROPOMORPHIC ROBOT HAND
Patrick Lux, Ben Weber, Joe Hoffmann
Athenee de Luxembourg, Luxembourg, LUXEMBOURG

This project aims to develop an animatronic hand, able to accomplish the basic functionalities of the human hand. Furthermore, the robotic hand is comparable to the human hand in sense of dimensions and mass properties, all at low production costs. <br><br>The main objectives of the projects are to enable the key and the finger-tip grips as well as to grasp different objects. The robotic hand consists of 2 identical fingers and an opposable thumb. The robotic hand provides only 9 DOF compared to the 23 DOF in the human hand.<br><br>An actuation concept has been developed, consisting of only one servomotor per finger and two motors for the thumb. Finger flexion is actuated, while extension is assured by torsion springs installed in every joint. All parts are made of printed PLA, thus being lightweight while providing sufficient rigidity. <br><br>Functionality tests of the robot hand have been conducted with a master-slave system. The hand is actuated with commands coming from a sensor glove, whereby the robotic hand mimics the masters hand motions.<br><br>Experiments show that the two basic grips are fully accomplished by the robotic hand and that grasping of lightweight objects is possible. In general, functionality of the robotic hand could be successfully proven. However, position deviations and time delays compared to the master’s commanded reference trajectories occur and can mainly be explained by corrupt outputs of the sensor glove, not occuring when the hand is controlled numerically.<br><br>This anthropomorphic hand shows promising results for future applications.<br><br>

AN ADVANCED BIOMIMETIC HAND USING ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING
Holly Catherine Erickson
Los Alamos High School, Los Alamos, NM

Current prosthetic limbs are primarily comprised of mechanical parts and gears using traditional subtractive machining and manufacturing. As a result, mobility and many basic functions are limited. Current prosthetic limbs take substantial time to make, are very limited in flexability, and are mostly hand-made. However, if methods could be developed to create a prosthetic hand using additive manufacturing, the field of biomimetics could be radically transformed. By replicating key aspects of the human hand such as bones, tendons, nerves, skin, etc., there would be no need for traditional mechanical parts, allowing for greater range of motion, function, and appearance. Additive manufacturing is a new and upcoming field. Therefore, development of a modified 3D printer that would directly print all of the different materials required for building biomimetic hands could revolutionize the development of custom prosthetics. Using 3D scanning technology, measurements could be taken for a certain person and could be rapidly programmed into the printer, allowing the prosthetic device to be made in just a couple of hours. This new technology for a biomimetic prosthetics could be used in war zones, third world countries, and even local hospitals. Although this use of additive manufacturing is looked at through the perspective of biomimetics, there is virtually no limit to the applications of this new technology.
