ELASTOMERS: RUBBER AND HEAT
Malone Russell Locke
Trinity Catholic High School, Ocala, Florida, USA

This project was used to find the effect that heat has on the properties of elastic polymers. Polymers can exist in linear, branched, or cross-linked form. Rubber is a substance that is slightly cross-linked in its construction which gives it unique properties. <br><br> In this experiment, 5 rubber bands were prepared to be tested at 5 different temperature zones. To examine the rubber's ability to contract when exposed to heat, each rubber band was connected to a hanging rack, placed in an oven, and exposed to temperatures of 25°C (control), 75°C, 100°C, 125°C, and 150°C. Before heating, initial measurements of the distance between the bottom of the oven and the end of the rubber band were recorded. They were then subjected to heat for 30 minutes and measured at 10 minute intervals. These measurements were compared to the measurements of the rubber bands before they were subjected to heat and the data recorded.<br><br> At 25°C there was no measurable difference. At 75°C the average rubber band contraction was 1.2 mm. At 100°C the average contraction was 2 mm. At 125°C the average contraction was 6.4 mm. At 150°C the average contraction was -8.6 mm.<br><br> In conclusion, when rubber bands are subjected to heat, they contract from their original length. There is a positive correlation between the increase of heat and the amount of contraction of the rubber band. This is evident until the threshold temperature <br><br>(~120°C) is reached and the rubber becomes too hot and begins to expand and melt.<br><br>

MISSION TO MARS
Ivey Schell George
Union Grove High School, McDonough, GA, USA

The purpose of my projct is to determine which material is most suitable to sustain human life on Mars. While conducting my experiment I cut cotton, fiberglass, carbon, Kevlar, polyurethane coated nylon, and polyester into 28cm x 28cm pieces of fabric. I did this to test the insulating ability of the untreated fabrics again. I wrapped them around a 12 oz. glass Ball jelly jar. I also cut an 8cm x 8cm piece of fabric and pokes a hole into it to place over the top of the jar. I poured 150 ml of boiling water into the jar and stuck the MultiLog probe in. I took the temperature with the probe every ten seconds until it dropped below the starting temperature. I performed this experiment with each fabric. I then cut 5cm x 10cm pieces of each of the fabrics to test their flammabilities. I clamped each fabric to a ring stand and torched them. I torched the fabrics until they burned or lasted for fourteen minutes. I then repeated the steps above. After this, I exposed the fabrics to liquid nitrogen. I placed the fabrics into the liquid nitrogen for five minutes and then let them return to room temperature. I then repeated the above expermient with the treated fabrics. Once all of the data od the experiments was compiled, I concluded that Kevlar is the best fabric to sustain human life on Mars due to its consistent performance in all three experiments.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

THE POWER OF THE JOULE
Julian Paul Bourg
Ellender Memorial High School, Houma, Louisiana, United States

When I chose this project for the science fair I wanted to show how reducing friction and changing gearing ratios affects cars. My first car, Maximum Velocity I, was equipped with hoop screws for bearings and really modest gearing. The car still managed to reach 178 feet. Maximum Velocity II is its big brother. While M.V. II is much larger than M.V. I, I managed to keep them the same weight. To prove that reducing friction and changing gearing would cause a car to be more efficient, I put ball bearings on M.V. II and I created three gearing setups to use on the car. M.V. II proved to be much more efficient just by rolling the car. The first pass was made with the gearing setup #1 equaling 175 feet. I proceeded to gearing setup #2 equaling 190 feet. Without wasting any time I proceeded to gearing setup #3 equaling 230 feet! Just like in a joule mobile where there is a finite source of energy, there is a finite source of energy in a car. In the joule mobile it is the falling weight releasing its potential energy and in a car it is its fuel supply. For either one to be considered efficient each must be able to make the most of its source of energy. High grade bearings and correctly suited gearing ratios are two of the ways to do that. That is what my project was meant to prove.

STRIATED SKELETAL MUSCLE ANALOGUE: A DESIGN AND ANALYTICAL COMPARISON
Aaron Christopher Enten
American Heritage School Plantation, Plantation, FL

Nylon possesses both elastic and tensile strength properties which provide flexibility. It was hypothesized that if iron filings were incorporated into nylon fibers, then the fibers could be mobilized by an electromagnet simulating a skeletal muscle contraction. The analogue of bundled nylon fibers was made by mixing n-hexane with sebacoyl chloride and pouring the mixture on a hexamethylinediamine solution. Iron filings were added onto the interface that formed between the two solutions as the nylon fibers were pulled. After the fibers were created, they were bundled into groups of approximately 8.5 centimeters with an average diameter of approximately 2.5 centimeters. Testing consisted of force comparisons for contractile strength capabilities and tensile strength capacity between the analogue and average muscle tissue. The values obtained were within 5.447% of normal muscle tissue.

ROBOTICS SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM
Joey Lee Edgar
Jensen Beach High School, Jensen Beach, FL, USA

The purpose of this project was to engineer a complete robotics system for wireless surveillance. The only similar product found available to the public was from Machinelab.com. The Machine Lab’s system's limitations include limited short wireless range, limited maneuverability, non-programmable and only remote controlled.<br><br>The platform was designed in Autodesk Inventor 8. The robots movements are controlled with an Initial Navigation Unit (INU) using an ATMEL Atmega16 microcontroller. The INU was programmed using an STK500 ATMEL development board. The programming language was a combination of C and Assembler. AVR Studio was used to compile the code and Image Craft Compiler (ICC) downloads the .hex file onto the INU. Six 50W motor controllers are used to operate the drive train. An ultrasonic range finder onboard the robot is used for obstacle avoidance. The robot is linked to a wireless user interface using a Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (USART) style of communication. Autonomously programmed navigation and remote navigation are both possible. The user interface is controlled by and ATMEL Atmega16 microcontroller. The user interface consists of an LCD that displays conditions on the robot.<br><br>This system was found to have a range of 300 meters and provides various features that make it more durable then the current product. The expected production cost would be very competitive with Machinelab.com product.<br><br>

FABRIC TO DYE FOR
Kelli E Iwane
Kailua High School, Kailua, HI

‘Fabric to Dye For’<br><br>Each day, fabric is dyed to create mass productions of clothing and accessories that are worn and bought all around the world. Through this experiment fabric was tested in different conditions to see which produced the best outcome. Three different factors were tested, time, temperature, and concentration. For each of the three tests, 3 different fabrics were tested also, rayon, silk, and cotton. The time variable was tested by leaving the fabric in the solution for 3 different intervals of minutes, 5, 10 and 15. Leaving the pieces of fabric in three different temperatures of solution for 10 minutes tested the temperature factor. Lastly, the concentration factor was tested by leaving the pieces of fabric in different amounts of powder dye solution for 10 minutes each. My hypothesis was that the concentration test would produce the darkest fabric. Through my experiment my hypothesis was proven correct; concentration did have the greatest effect on the coloring of the fabric.

SIGNAL AMPLIFICATION STRATEGIES FOR LONG DISTANCE WI-FI NETWORKING
Steven Patrick Buss
Martin County High School, Stuart FL, USA

Wi-Fi is a wireless networking standard and has become synonymous with the freedom of connecting to the internet from almost anywhere. Unfortunately, “almost anywhere” tends to mean that one must be within a couple hundred feet of a base station, or even less if the signal has to pass through walls. My purpose in this experiment was to find the best way to connect to a wireless base station from up to a mile away.<br><br>Three antennas were constructed using readily available materials. The antennas were a circular waveguide, a biquad, and a biquad mounted onto a parabolic dish. The three antennas were tested by setting up a wireless base station and traveling set distances away. I then attached each of the antennas to my laptop computer and used a program called NetStumbler to test the signal strength for each antenna.<br><br>The cantenna was the worst performing antenna, achieving a distance of only .3 miles (.64 km) from the base station. The biquad by itself and the biquad mounted on the parabolic dish both performed much better, with the biquad achieving 1 mile (1.7 km) and the biquad and parabolic dish combination achieving 1.3 miles (2.1 km).<br><br>The experiment I conducted can be applied to any application that requires a long distance wireless connection. Businesses could mount these types of antennas on their roofs and communicate between separate offices. Or perhaps a neighborhood could share high speed internet. Both uses would reduce costs for the internet and increase productivity.<br><br>

THREE-STATE MOLECULAR TRANSFORMATIONS FOR OPTICAL TO DIGITAL INFORMATION PROCESSING
Clifton Saurel
Blanche Ely High School, Pompano Beach, Fl, USA

Certain molecular switches respond to input stimulations producing detectable outputs. The interplay of these signals can be exploited to reproduce basic logic operations at the molecular level. The transition from simple logic gates to complex digital circuits requires the design of chemical systems able to process multiple inputs and outputs. A three-state molecular switch has been identified that responds to one chemical and two optical inputs producing two optical outputs. <br><br> The molecule spiropyran (R/S)-SP was synthesized in three steps starting from the commercially available compound 2,3,3-trimethyl-3H-indole.The solution that resulted from the derived spiropyran was switched to the merocyanine form ME upon irradiation with ultraviolet light and was designated an input. CF3CO2H was added to ME to form the protonated form MEH. The CF3CO2H added an H+ ion, another designated input. MEH was isomerized to SP when irradiated with visible light. Visible light served as the third and final input. The two resulting outputs (401 nm and 563 nm) were the absorbances of the molecular switch. <br><br> The results revealed that a combinational logic circuit integrating two AND, two NOT, and one OR gate can be formed. One portion of the logic circuit combines the three inputs through NOT, OR, and AND operations producing an output. <br><br>

EFFECT OF MODEL CONTROLLERS ON THE FRICTION CONTROL OF HIGH PERFORMANCE ROBOTICS SYSTEMS
Melissa Amoi Belinda Smith
Coral Glades High School, Coral Springs, FL, USA

Friction, a force between surface, can cause errors in a robotics system if not properly accounted for. This project focused on testing the performance of various controllers in a robotics system in relation to friction. The hypothesis was that if a controller that modelled dynamic terms and compensated for friction was applied to a robotics system, the system would be more efficient. A one-link robot was constructed and used as a test bed for a series of experiments. The motor's position feedback capabilities allowed the error to be calculated through the use of the LINUX-based qMotor software program. The resulting errors were compared to pure feedback controllers and two different friction model-based controllers. <br><br> Results have proven conclusive with the hypothesis, as the error reading for the controller with dynamic terms had a final error of 0.008, compared to the final error reading of 0.026 and 0.38 of the other controllers.

A WIND TUNNEL MODEL OF AN ADJUSTABLE SOFFIT SYSTEM'S EFFECT ON HURRICANE DAMAGE
Thomas Kent Fichtelman
Vero Beach High School, Vero Beach, Florida, USA

After hurricane Frances, water stains were noted on the ceiling, while the overlying exterior roof was undamaged. Prior to the next hurricane, Jeanne, the soffit that surrounded the same roof area was closed. After Jeanne, there was no further ceiling damage. I hypothesized that an adjustable soffit system would reduce interior structural damage during sustained high wind/rain events.<br><br> To test this theory, a Jet Stream 500 wind tunnel was used to test structure models of Plexiglas and balsa wood. They were tested with a closed one, or two soffit (upwind/down wind) system. Using an 80 mph wind speed, the closed soffit’s maximum lift was 0.73lbs, while the two sided open soffit’s lift was 0.99lbs. When only the downwind soffit was open, the lift was 1.44lbs. Significantly, when only the upwind soffit was opened, the lift force was 3.13 lbs. A soffit’s louver orientation in relation to wind direction was also a significant factor in determining lift force. When the louver of an open soffit is directed away from the wind, there is virtually no lift.<br><br> Using dry ice and boiling water, flow visualization studies were conducted with digital photography and video. Soffit configuration influenced interior moisture collection. This was most intense with a completely open soffit system.<br><br> Future work will be to create an adjustable soffit system powered by both electricity and a manual back up, which will respond to changes in ambient temperature, wind intensity, and moisture.<br><br>

HYDRATED LIME'S EFFECT ON MORTAR'S RESISTANCE TO WATER PERMEATION
Amy Renard Wheble
Starr's Mill High School, Fayetteville, GA

The purpose of this experiment was to answer the question: does increasing the amount of hydrated lime in a mortar mixture increase the mortar mixture’s resistance to water permeation. It was hypothesized that increasing the amount of hydrated lime in a mortar mixture would increase the mortar’s resistance to water penetration. By providing data to support the hypothesis, individuals could add hydrated lime to mortar mixtures of to lessen chances at water leaks of water damage to the structure. To test this problem, four groups of mortar mixtures were made. One mortar group had no additional hydrated lime, one mortar group had .5 liters of additional hydrated lime, one group had 1.0 liters, and the last group had 1.5 liters. Ten molds of mortar were formed using the different mortar mixtures. The forty mortar molds were massed as dried molds, soaked in four cm of water for two hours, and then re-massed. The percent of increase was found for each of the forty molds to find the increase of mass due to water permeation. No additional hydrated lime yielded an average percent increase of 2.3%. .5 liters of additional hydrated lime showed an average percent increase of 3.5%. 1.0 liters of additional hydrated lime had an average percent increase of 5.5%, and 1.5 liters of additional hydrated lime had an average percent increase of 6.7%. Therefore, the hypothesis was not supported by the data because as the amount of hydrated lime was increased, the mortar’s resistance to water permeation decreased.

SPATIAL CORRELATION OF GRAPHENE ETCHING TRACKS TOWARDS NANORIBBON FORMATION
Arunita Kar
Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Lexington, KY

Graphene is an exciting, newly discovered, two-dimensional material that consists of carbon atoms arranged in a "honeycomb" hexagonal lattice structure. Graphene has tremendous potential for use on a wide variety of electronic applications due to its unique electrical and two-dimensional properties. Most of these applications require some method of confining the electrical charge carriers through the use of anatomically precise, lateral boundaries of the graphene structures, thus forming nanoribbons. Currently, the atomic precision required to form graphene nanoribbons is beyond the reach of standard nanolithography and, as a result, other methods are required. Crystallographic etching of graphene through the use of hydrogenation via metallic catalyst particles is one promising technique which has emerged. In this method, etch tracks are formed along the crystal axes of the graphene at high temperature under a well controlled hydrogen atmosphere. To utilize this technique to effectively form nanoribbons requires high spatial correlation between adjacent etch tracks within a single sheet of graphene. Here I will investigate this spatial correlation and explore the possibility of improving it and nanoribbon formation by tuning the processing parameter of temperature during catalytic hydrogenation.

ANALYSIS OF AERODYNAMIC LIFT GENERATED BY STORM WINDS WITH APPLICATIONS TO REDUCING STRUCTURAL ROOF FAILURE
Katherine Elizabeth Reichert
Columbia High School, Lake City, Florida, USA

Hurricane wind damage is a major threat in the United States costing millions of dollars and hundreds of lives each year. One component of the damage is the structural failure of roofs. This project analyzes the role of aerodynamic lift as the mechanism of roof destruction. An experimental model was created by constructing a wind tunnel and evaluating different roof pitch angles and the lift that they generate. Then, experiments were performed to reduce this lift by creating drag at the leading edge of the roof. These results determined that roofs can generate aerodynamic lift in high wind similar to an aircraft wing. The lift increased with increasing roof angle from 0° to 15° before decreasing again. A roof with a 15° pitch created the most lift, and this was statistically significant (p=0.02). After 30° there was no significant lift, but there was increasing statistical variance due to increasing turbulence. In addition, interruption of the airflow over the leading edge of the roof does generate enough drag to significantly reduce lift. As larger percentage of leading edge airflow is obstructed, the lift decreases proportionally. Obstruction of 50% or more of the leading roof edge statistically significantly reduced lift (p=0.20). These experiments provide insight into strategies to safeguard structures from the damage of high storm winds.

PROTECTING LEVEES FROM WAVE EROSION: ROCKS, TREES, MARSH
Andre James Simoneaux
South Terrebonne High School, Bourg, LA

This project was about finding the best way to stop wave erosion on earthen levees. The effect of rock barriers, marsh, and a forest rim of trees on levee erosion was examined. The experiment showed clearly that after the waves had taken their toll least material was lost form the levee in the simulated marsh treatment. Therefore marsh protection is the most effective way of reducing wave erosion on earthen levees. This project was conducted in a homemade wave tank. A wooden mold was used to ensure that the initial profile of the levee was similar for each trial. For three trials for each method of protection the levee profile was measured at the start; and then at 30 sec. intervals for two minutes. Change in the levee profile was used to estimate the volume of dirt lost. My control had an average volume loss of 17.38% and the rim of trees trials had an average loss of 20.74%. However the rock barriers showed only an average 12.31% volume loss, but the marsh trials averaged 9.70% loss of volume. Some of my observations indicated that the trials involving the trees just allowed the waves to pass right through them having little to no affect. My experiment shows that when a levee is protected by a marsh it will likely retain more volume than a levee protected by trees or rocks.

IS IT RIPE YET?
Allen J. Bordelon
St. James High School/SMA, St. James, LA, USA

Each year money is wasted on produce that is either not ripe or too ripe. I decided to design a device to detect fruits' ripeness by using flavanoid concentration. A UV/Vis spectrophotometer was used to emit a wavelength of light (338 nm) absorbed by flavanoids. This was used to determine flavanoid concentration, which was compared to fruit ripeness for oranges. The first trials indicated that there was a change in flavanoids at different ripeness levels and no damage to the fruit using this device was detected.

A STUDY OF POLYMER CROSS-LINK STRUCTURES BY THERMAL ANALYTICAL METHODS
Zenia Zoe Zheng
McIntosh High School, Peachtree City, GA

The molecular structure of a flexible packaging film is quite important because it affects the properties of the film. This research was conducted to study the cross-linking structure induced by Electron Beam (EB) irradiation and its impact on polymers that are broadly used for packaging materials. The ultimate goal is to understand the relationship between cross-linking structure and the properties of polymers.<br><br>In this study, two polymers, Ethylene Vinyl Acetate and Linear Low Density Polyethylene, were chosen. These two plastics are the most commonly used as flexible packaging material because of their excellent optics, great heat seal ability and good mechanical strength. Two thermal analysis methods, Differential Scanning Calorimetry and Dynamic Mechanical Analysis were used to measure the creep strain, creep recovery, and heat capacity of different samples with varying amounts of EB irradiation dosage. The gel measurement data was also used to show the degree of cross-linking in various samples. The Extraction test (gel content) shows that a higher dosage of EB Irradiation resulted in a higher degree of cross-links in the polymer. As the dosage of EB Irradiation and degree of cross-links in the polymer increased, creep strain decreased, creep recovery increased, and heat capacity decreased. Also when there was more EVA than LLDPE, the creep strain was higher, creep recovery was lower, and the heat capacity was lower. The results give many hints on the relationship between the cross-linking structure of the polymer and its thermal properties. These results provide a clear understanding of cross-linking structure and its impact on material performance properties that are critical for flexible packaging films.

WHEN THE NEWS FAILS... STRENGTH TESTING OF NEWSPAPER, SAND, AND CEMENT MIXES
Kelsey Sachi Anderson
Kailua High School, Kailua, HI, United States of America

        I sought to find an economical and environment-friendly alternative to normal concrete in the form of papercrete.  To test whether papercrete was an effective alternative I compared how different proportions of paper and sand affected the strength of a concrete beam/block.  My hypothesis was that the sand-cement concrete would have the greatest compressive strength and the paper-cement concrete would have the greatest tensile strength because the paper would create bonds across the concrete beams.  I created mixtures with a one-to-one ratio of sand-to-cement, a one-to-one ratio of paper-to-cement, and a half-to-half-to-one ratio of paper-to-sand-to-cement.  The concrete set for a 14-day period and I tested the compressive and tensile strengths of the mixes at the University of Hawaii Civil Engineering Lab.  The sand-cement had the greatest stress and rupture strength; the paper-cement held the least stress and the weakest rupture strength.  The papercrete did not fail like regular concrete, being able to hold less stress for a greater period of time without a physical failure.  My hypothesis was proven incorrect; paper did not have a positive effect on the strength of the concrete but instead created weak points at which to fail.  My results for the papercrete mixes were not valid because there was less uniformity in papercrete. Though the papercrete results are invalid, the strength held by this concrete was so low that it is clear that the papercrete formulas used in this experiment do not have a viable use as a building material.<br><br>

AERODYNAMIC WINGS OF THE FUTURE - A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF LIFT AND LONGITUDINAL STABILITY OF A HYPER-ELLIPTIC CAMBER WING AND A NACA 2412
Peter Bao-Phuc Nguyen
Fort Walton Beach HS, Fort Walton Beach, Florida, United States of America

It has been a challenge for aerodynamicists and weapon designers to come up with an airframe with high lift and high stability. High lift allows air vehicles to fly faster, achieve longer ranges, and minimize fuel consumption. Stability allows control of the air vehicle during weapons release, and cruise or terminal maneuvers. It also permits easy control of aircraft during all flight phases such as roll, pitch, and yaw with efficiency and grace.<br><br>The purpose of this project is to find out if the hyper-elliptic camber wing will generate higher lift and is statically stable for longitudinal control compared to the conventional planar wing NACA-2412.<br><br>This paper reports my investigation of the aerodynamic performance of a hyper-elliptic camber wing, which highly resembles a hybrid shape of the wing of a seagull and a shark fin. A sub-sonic wind tunnel was constructed during the summer of 2003 in preparation for this project. Data such as wind speed, lift force, and pitch moments about the center of gravity was collected from the sub-sonic wind tunnel for both types of wings.<br><br>The hypotheses are verified and confirmed with the measured data. The performance of the hyper-elliptic camber wing promises great application to missile and aircraft design. Stable missiles at release assure safe separation from aircraft. Great lift could provide longer range to targets. Large range of angle of attack provides flexibility in trim. Longitudinal stability allows easy control of cruise and final descent to targets. The same performance could be applied to aircraft design. I plan to further explore the roll and yaw, the Lift-to-Drag performance of this special wing shape in the future.

BASE LAYER CLOTHING THE WILL KEEP YOUR BODY INSULATED MOST EFFECTIVELY
Ryan Michael Kitchens
Starr's Mill High School, Fayetteville, GA

The title of this experiment is: Base Layer Clothing That Will Insulate Your Body Most Effectively. The purpose of this experiment is to find out which base-layer brand material will keep you warmest in cold weather conditions and if it is worth spending extra money for well-known brands. The problem of the experiment is whether spending extra money on well-known insulation base-layers are worth it. The hypothesis is: If the thermometer is surrounded by the Polartec brand material, then the thermometer will show less loss of heat after the time periods when it is observed. To carry out the experiment, sensors from three different remote thermometers were placed in three different materials and then placed in socks to act as an outer layer. There was also a fourth thermometer placed in only a sock to act as a control group for the experiment. Then the materials were hung in a freezer that was at -20 degrees Celsius. After 15 minutes the temperatures were observed and recorded without the sensors being removed from the freezer. After 30 minutes the temperatures were again recorded and then the sensors were removed from the freezer and brought back up to 19 degrees Celsius so that the materials were able to be retested. The test was accomplished 10 times. The hypothesis was rejected. The best base-layer material for keeping the warmest temperature in the cold condition was the cotton thermals. Unresolved aspects that could affect the warmth of these materials, that were not tested, are moisture wicking ability and wind resistance of the materials. These factors could be tested to extend this project in the future.

STOPPING LEVEE EROSION: ROCKS, GRASS, TREES
Andre James Simoneaux
South Terrebonne High School, Bourg, LA

This project was about finding the best way to stop wave erosion on earthen levees. The effect of rocks, grass, and trees on levee erosion was examined. The experiment showed clearly that after the waves had taken their toll least material was lost from the levee with the simulated grass treatment. Therefore coverage by grass is an effective way of reducing wave erosion on earthen levees. <br><br> This project was conducted in a homemade wave tank. A wooden mold was used to ensure that the initial profile of the levee was similar for each trial. For three trial for each treatment the levee profile was measured at the start; after thirty seconds of exposure to the waves, and five times thereafter at one minute intervals. Change in the levee profile was used to estimate the volume of dirt lost. Both the bare mud control and the trees treatment had an average 16.7% loss of dirt from the levee. However the rocks showed only a 7.3% loss of dirt, but the grass showed a surprisingly low 4% average loss. Observations indicate the trees seemed to have little effect on the waves; waves just passed straight through, impacting the levee just like in the bare mud control. <br><br> The project shows that if new levees are left bare they are more vulnerable to wave erosion that if covered with grass. Single rows of trees will not be enough to stop wave erosion, but a single layer of rocks may at least slow it down.

NANO-GRAPHENE LASER LIMITING
Boshan Zhao
Little Rock Central High School, Little Rock, AR

As lasers become more powerful, the need to protect against harmful effects such as accidental discharges and the potential use as a weapon becomes more urgent. Just as the bulletproof vest significantly decreased fatalities from guns, laser proof armor via optical limiting may decrease injury or death because of lasers. The project hypothesized that graphene, a two dimensional (2D) atomic layer of carbon, would perform optical limiting better than the current standard, fullerenes (C60), due to its unique 2D pi-conjugation structure. Aqueous suspensions of graphene nanosheets, graphite, and a gold-graphene composite were prepared along with a C60 solution in orthoxylene, each with linear transmittance 70% at green light of 532 nm. A nanosecond pulsed green laser beam was directed and focused on each sample. The transmittance was recorded as a function of laser power. Broadband limiting was tested by using an additional red laser of 730 nm. Results indicated that graphene was the best limiter overall, superior to the best limiting materials currently available. Future work could be done optimizing graphene’s 2D structure via chemical modification as well as evaluating the effects of different suspending media.

A STUDY OF AERONAUTICAL DRAG ON VARIOUS WING MECHANISMS AT MULTIPLE ANGLES OF ATTACK TO PRODUCE A MORE EFFICIENT STOL AIRCRAFT DRAG MECHANISM
Forrest Eugene Lindsey
Mills University Studies High , Cabot Arkansas , United States of America

Drag is the resistance an airplane experiences in moving forward through the air. Drag is a force directly opposed to the motion of the airfoil and, as the work of overcoming it is performed by the engine, it is desirable to have it as small as possible, to afford the engine to be more efficient. Drag is of two principal types. Parasite Drag is the term given to the drag of all those parts of the airplane which do not contribute to lift, and Induced Drag is the result of the wing's work in sustaining the airplane in flight and is, therefore, a part of the lift and can never be eliminated. In this experiment primarily parasite drag is tested, yet the mechanisms we use are primarily “induced” in real life. This experiment tests parasite drag on wing mechanisms by using a sled friction device and a series of gram weights. The objective was to find the amount of drag produced on select wing mechanisms within a four-minute period, hence the problem “what wing mechanisms (flaps, spoilers, or ailerons) produce the highest amount of drag, in a remote operated real-time situation at different angles of attack, for a basis to create a more efficient STOL mechanism”<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

RUNNING ON EMPTY
HAROLD FRANKLIN HEDRICK
RIVER RIDGE HIGH SCHOOL, NEW PORT RICHEY, FL. PASCO

It is estimated that Americans use more than 380 million gallons of gas every day. According to experts, if everybody bought the most fuel-efficient car available, the United States would save approximately 1.47 billion gallons of gasoline each year! The purpose of this project is to determine if it is plausible to greatly increase gas mileage with inexpensive supplies available at a local retailer. <br><br> <br><br>Since additives and/or modifications can revoke your car’s warranty, a $25 car was purchased. Four methods were used: 1) the car in its original condition 2) .10 oz. Acetone per gallon of gas 3) 1 oz. “Gumout” per gallon of gas 4) “the OG2” (a recreation of Tom Ogle’s invention of the 1970’s) Each method was tested 3 times each at both 30 mph and 70 mph. The car was jacked up and cinder blocks were placed under the frame so the tires would spin freely. The fuel tank was emptied and the trip-o-meter was set to 0. One gallon of gasoline was put in the fuel tank. The car was turned on and accelerated to the appropriate speed. The cruise control was set and the car ran until it was out of gas.<br><br>The MPG was abnormally high on all tests due to the lack of ground resistance. One must look at the data as qualitative not quantitative. My hypothesis that MPG could not be greatly increased inexpensively proved to be false. The data clearly showed that “the OG2” out-preformed the other methods and even doubled the original MPG. The "OG2" does what fuel injection was designed to. The heated vaporized fuel passes through a series of tubes and filters to the intake box and into the cylinders.<br><br>I could not road test the vehicle due to the fact that the person I purchased the car from could not locate the title; therefore, I could not get tags or insurance. She has sent away for the title and as soon I have that, I hope to perform the road tests.<br><br>

THE PATTERNS AND EXPLANATIONS OF BRIDGE FAILURES
Kirstin Heurich Negron
Lake Brantley High School, Altamonte Springs, FL

A fascinating aspect of civil engineering and bridge failures is the practical applications this subject entails: improved structural construction, more developed analysis of critical materials, as well as minimized chances of perilous failures. The problem addressed by this research was whether the causes of failure in specific bridges could be analyzed to pinpoint a pattern among the collapses. Thirty bridge failures were researched including the structure type, materials, year of collapse, location of bridge, and cause of failure. The subcategories were utilized to associate causes of failure with structure type and materials used. The overpass on the Boulevard de la Concorde was a model in the experiment. Two bridges were constructed with bass wood simulating one of the critical causes that contributed to the overpass failure: the first model demonstrates improper rebar support, while the second demonstrates an improved design with a lesser chance of failure. This trial was then repeated with balsa. I-35W Mississippi River Bridge, a truss arch bridge, was the second bridge failure analyzed. Four models were constructed: two trusses and two arches. The truss models reflected the impact of inadequate rebar support, a cause of the Minneapolis collapse. The arch models revealed the impact of undersized gusset plates, another cause of the Minneapolis collapse. After testing the strength of the enhanced structures with the Universal Testing Machine, significant quantitative differences were revealed. The findings support the alternate hypothesis that there is a statistically significant pattern among the cause of failure, structural design, and the materials used.

THE FABRICATION AND TESTING OF A LUMINESCENT OXYGEN SENSOR
Emily Margaret Cook
Marian High School, Mishawaka, IN, USA

An oxygen sensor has the potential to determine the amount of calories burned over a period of time. Therefore, the use of this technology combined with physical exertion would help athletes and dietitians in determining the effectiveness of their workouts and in developing new exercise routines. In order to accomplish this goal, such a sensor, which is based off of a blue LED light, a [Ru(Ph2Phen)3]2+ membrane, and a phototransistor, was constructed. Next, the sensor was calibrated by sending air with known percentages of oxygen through it. The calibration line, which is modeled after the Stern-Volmer relationship, was then used to produce an equation with which to calculate the number of calories burned. This line along with the calibration data for the spirometer was used to develop a series of equations, which were input into a LabView command series, to calculate the number of calories burned. In the final stage of the experiment, human subjects will be asked to perform various physical activities before breathing into the sensor. From this, conclusions regarding the amount of calories burned during each specific activity and the effects of different body types and lifestyles on the amount of calories burned will be drawn.

IMPLEMENTATION OF PBASIC TO ENGINEER AND DESIGN BASIC OBJECTS
Michael Andrew Montminy
La Plata High School, Laplata, Maryland, USA

The main project goal was to build a computer controlled milling machine capable of producing a variety of simple objects, with very little downtime to switch between objects and programs. The machine was constructed primarily with MDF plywood, a type of plywood made from recycled wastes that features excellent resistance to splintering or chipping. Both of the machines axis were driven through screws constructed of threaded rod, and powered by servos. To control the servos, a Stamp 2.0 micro controller was used enabling the machine to be easily programmed and configured through a computer. All programming was done through P-Basic a modified architecture of Microsoft’s Q-basic. This programming language is designed to be very adaptable to a plethora of uses from industrial control to aircraft cabin lighting. The milling machine is designed in order to prevent flex from allowing unwanted movement in the object being constructed, for in the industry any flex would result in wasted time, money, and labor. The machine also features sealed cartridge bearings at all pivots, or linear travel locations in an effort to reduce friction and flex to minimal levels, producing a more reliable and accurate milling system. And in machining the most important concerns are accuracy, speed, and reliability, three concerns addressed in this project.

SPATIALLY TUNABLE LASER EMISSION IN DYE-DOPED CHOLESTERIC POLYMER FILMS
Charles Richard Doyle
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, FL

A spatially tunable laser emission of the dye-doped cholesteric polymer film is demonstrated by generating a one-dimensional gradient photonic band gap which is cured by an ultraviolet light. A frequency-doubled pulsed Nd:YAG laser is used to pump the film. Since the spatial distribution of the reflection band is fixed in the cholesteric polymer film, the tuning of the laser wavelength does not require any external field.<br><br> The desired effect was produced when a 15 ìm cell was filled with a cholesteric monomer. The glass-encased film was then positioned on a heating stage so that only one part of the cell would be under direct contact from heat while under the ultraviolet light, thus creating a polymer film with a one-dimensional temperature-induced gradient. The cell was then pumped by a 532 nm source, yielding the results of the experiment. The lasing wavelength is tunable from 595 to 643 nm by shifting the position of the film with respect to the pumping beam.

CARS OF THE FUTURE 2
Aeriel Denise Murphy
Wetumpka High School, Wetumpka, Alabama, U.S.

This year I performed numerous tests to determine the strength of the cars we use today. The machine I tested on could apply a maximum of 5000 lbs to the materials. The first materials I tested were light but had a thick cross section as a result the machine could not break them. After I milled the materials down the machine could break them easily. While performing the tests I realized the thicker the material was the higher the tensile strength. The thinner the material was the less the tensile strength. Most of the cars we use today are mostly made of vanadium, magnesium, chromium, aluminum and sometimes titanium. I hypothesize that the materials in automobiles today do not have a high tensile strength because the materials are thinner resulting in more deaths and damages in a car accident; automobiles made fifty or more years ago were more safer because the materials on cars were thicker. The purpose of this project is to prove that there would be less deaths and damages in automobile accidents if the materials in our automobiles would be as thick as the materials in some of the first cars; for example the Ford Model T. I want to prove how strong our cars are compared to how strong the automobiles would be if the materials in our automobiles today were thicker but light. My hypothesis was correct automobiles would be safer if the materials in them were made thicker.

UTILIZING AUDIO PROFILE MATCHING TECHNOLOGY FOR REPLICATING BODY KINESIS
Robert Vaughan Glissmann
Peak to Peak Charter School, Boulder Colorado, USA

The purpose of this project is to implement a method of using sound to teach specific motor movements for sports and rehabilitation applications. The optimal acceleration profile of a motion is stored on a computer. The user learns the motion by attempting to duplicate the tonal pattern produced by the acceleration profile, with the tonal pattern produced by their movement. This technique of audio profile matching permits motions, like golf or tennis swings, or for a stroke victim, the motor skills necessary to walk, to be practiced without the need of a coach or therapist.<br><br>The project uses a wrist-mounted accelerometer to measure the angle of tilt and the acceleration involved in an underhand throw. A C++ program converts the data from the accelerometer into a Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) synthesized tone implemented by Windows. Although ball-throwing movements were primarily investigated in this project, other movements can be monitored by attaching the accelerometer to other parts of the body.<br><br>Experiments were conducted by tossing a ball underhanded with the objective of having it land a specific distance from the thrower. The data collected from various trials indicated that the concept of audio profile matching was valid. This device provides a user with a method of practicing motions independent of a therapist or trainer while receiving feedback as to whether the movement is being performed correctly.<br><br>

BALLISTIC LIMIT OF LAMINATED COMPOSITE PANELS
Niraj Rama Nathan, Lecanto High School
Lecanto, FL , USA

The purpose of this project is to determine the relationship between the ballistic limit of a sandwich panel and those of its component parts, determine the which materials should be used for cockpit doors, and utilize finite element analysis to accurately determine a material’s ballistic limit through computer modeling.<br><br> I predicted that the ballistic limit of the composite panel would be greater than or equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the ballistic limits of its components and that the sandwiches with filled cores would be best suited for cockpit doors.<br><br> First, the aluminum plates and honeycomb were cut into 5” x 5” squares. The aluminum plates were attached to both sides of the core. The plates were cured for 3 weeks. The gas gun was prepared for impact tests. The sandwich material and its components were tested. The previous process was repeated for the other sandwich materials.<br><br> My experiments proved that the ballistic limit of the sandwich was greater than or equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of the ballistic limits of its components. Also, the sandwich panels with filled cores did not yield the best results; the plain aluminum plates and sandwiches with plain honeycomb cores were most desirable for application in cockpit doors.<br><br> This project is useful in the aviation industry, particularly for strengthening cockpit doors in commercial planes. The demand for a strong yet lightweight material makes sandwich composites appealing for use in this industry. <br><br>

PLANTS IN A PIPE
Anthony Fletcher, Jr.
St. James High, St. James Louisiana, USA

As humankind continues to build skyscrapers, malls, houses, etc., our land for growing essential food items is becoming scarce. In conducting this experiment, I hope to secure answers to where and how will we plant our basic nutritional necessities. <br><br>As problems for space steadfastly increase, we must find new ways for growing plants in confine spaces. This is why hydroponics exists. Therefore, I created a hydroponics system related to the Nutrient Film Technique (NFT). The system consisted of two PVC pipes using the following sizes: 3 inches, 2 inches, and 1½ inch. <br><br> The system was used solely to determine if plants could be grown in PVC pipes and the growth effect on each plant. The plants were grown for exactly two weeks (14 days) in the hydroponics system. After the two weeks the plants were removed from the system and placed in the sun for one week (7 days) to obtain dry weights. The plants were placed in the sun to rid the water and moisture from the plant. <br><br> The dry weights proved that the plants in the 2-inch pipe grew best. Why? The plants in the 2-inch pipe had the best growing conditions as compared to the other pipes. <br><br>

ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY?
Atalie Danielle Mickelson
Alma High School, Alma, Arkansas, United States of America

The reclamation of abandoned bauxite mines is dependent on a refining process challenged by issues with water resources. The process requires extremely large quantities of water. Problems arise concerning the management and disposal of the process’s discharged water. In addition, the mines currently contain acidic water that cannot be released to the environment. The researcher’s objective is to find a method to make the existing mine water usable for the process and to treat the excess water for discharge. <br><br> A test station was fabricated to test multiple mixing valve angles based on a venturi design maximizing to a 1.8 to 1 blend ratio. A solution of lemon juice was developed to match the mine water pH of a 2.7 and used as a safe alternative for testing purposes. Extensive tests were conducted with caustic solutions to evaluate effectiveness. Results proved that minimal quantities of lime would reach a maximum pH level of 12.4, but higher concentrations will treat greater quantities of water. From the obtained data, blend ratios were determined and a full process test was conducted utilizing actual acidic mine water and the pilot plant process model. <br><br> The process provided instant treatment of acidic waters and proved that high concentrations of caustic could be employed to minimize the quantity of caustic solution that needs to be utilized. The project proved successful by defining a system that could supply a sufficient quantity and quality of water to support the refining operation while becoming suitable for discharge to the environment.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF PRE-STRETCHING ON THE PERFORMANCE OF ELECTROACTIVE POLYMER ACTUATORS
Forrest Q Friesen
Palmer High School, Colorado Springs Colorado, United States

This experiment deals with how pre-stretching alters the properties of the VHB 4910 Electroactive polymer (EAP) material. Three groups were tested: a control group in which the material was not pre-stretched, a static group which was stretched for 45 minutes, and a dynamic group which was stretched back and forth for 45 minutes. The polymers were actuated under 1500 volts, 8250 volts, and 15000 volts. Both the strain (distance the electrode expanded), and the actuation speed were measured. The pressure between the electrodes was also calculated and compared to the collected data. Overall, the pre-stretched groups actuated significantly faster than the control group, but the average strain of all groups was very close. The most interesting results of this experiment had to do with the response patterns of different groups when actuated at specific voltages. Based on the data, pre-stretching can be used to both enhance overall performance of EAPs, and to adjust EAP’s responses to different voltages and conditions. <br><br> The information gathered in this experiment might enhance the applications of EAPs, which currently include speaker diaphragms, artificial muscles, robotic manipulators, and variable texturing.<br><br>

EFFECTS OF SPECIFIC DESGIN MODIFICATIONS ON THE CAPABILITIES OF AIRFOILS, PHASE II
Nolan Drew Cmerek
Hotchkiss High School, Hotchkiss, CO, USA

This researcher has tried to develop an airfoil that would create more lift than a conventional airfoil. Most airfoils would have to use flaps to create enough lift to get it up into the air. The first step was researching airfoils that were already developed. He then formed a hypothesis that an airfoil with waves in the design would create more lift than a conventional airfoil.<br><br>The researcher made five airfoils (A, B, C, D, E). They were constructed of galvanized tin, which was bent by hand and shaped with the use of tools to achieve the desired shape. The airfoils were then tested in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel consisted of a fan, contraction cone, settling chamber, and test chamber. Three airspeeds were used to receive optimum results while looking at the wind around the airfoils. <br><br>The researcher used a fog machine to see the wind around the airfoil. The airfoils were video taped while wind passed over them. The researcher found that Airfoil B (waves on bottom) hid a spinning wind at the trailing edge causing it to flip. Each of the other airfoils has no substantial improvement compared to Airfoil A (conventional), except Airfoil C. Airfoil C (waves on top and bottom) showed a greater gap between the upper and lower chambers in the wind than Airfoil A with the same characteristics as Airfoil A at the trailing edge. This let the researcher come to the conclusion that Airfoil C created the greatest amount of lift. <br><br>

LOWERING THE RESIDUAL MOISTURE CONTENT OF DRAINED COTTON FABRICS BY CHEMICAL PRE-TREATMENT
Christian Anthony Regalado
American Heritage School, Plantation, Florida, United States

The residual moisture content of a dried cotton fabric is roughly proportional to the dynamic surface tension of the water drained out of it. The dynamic surface tension of water is inversely proportional to the concentration of surfactant such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). As SDS concentration increases, the residual moisture of clothing soaked with it decreases until just before the critical micelle concentration, where it rises and then falls again. Theory suggests that this “spike” occurs because SDS adsorbs onto cotton at that concentration; with fewer dodecyl sulfate anions in solution, the solution’s dynamic surface tension increases, causing the residual moisture content to rise again. This project’s purpose was to eliminate that spike in the residual moisture content. It was hypothesized that by pre-adsorbing specific organic molecules onto the clothing fibers, SDS would have fewer binding sites on the fiber’s surface, maintaining a lower dynamic surface tension. With fewer binding sites and more SDS remaining in solution, the residual moisture content of those cloths should not experience the spike as significantly as those cloths not pre-treated. The cloths were treated with the organic materials and then their moisture was tested at various SDS concentrations by weighing them before and after soaking. The cloths treated with organics (specifically stearic acid) showed a significant decrease of the spike (with the exception of CAP betaine). Reducing the spike is a desirable outcome because it reduces the necessary time to complete the drying process in a dryer, therefore saving energy, time, and money.

SPINNING WIND ENERGY IN A NEW DIRECTION: THE DARRIEUS VERTICAL AXIS WIND TURBINE
Adam Daniel Sidman
Palmer High School, Colorado Springs, CO, U.S.A

The Darrieus Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (DVAWT) is a simpler design concept than the horizontal axis wind turbine. Generally, DVAWTs are more efficient at higher wind speeds, don't require a yaw pointing system, and are less expensive to build and easier to maintain, since their generators are ground accessible.<br><br> Both an open-circuit wind tunnel and a Delta-DVAWT with removable, straight NACA 0015 airfoil-shaped blades were designed and constructed. After researching technical papers and U.S. Patents, graphical CAD tools were used to design a balanced turbine with a direct-drive motor starter/generator. The relationship between electrical power generated and number of blades was determined over a range of wind speeds. It was hypothesized electrical power generated would be proportional to the number of blades and would increase as the square of wind speed.<br><br> The electrical power generated for 1, 2, 3 and 4 blade turbine configurations was measured over 26 wind speeds up to 20 km/h. The 3-bladed turbine generated the greatest power, but stalled at lower wind speeds (<13.7 km/h), where only the 4-bladed turbine was capable of generating power. The square law prediction was confirmed for the DVAWTs well above stall speeds.<br><br> The criticality of DVAWTs' surprisingly high stall wind speeds and dependence on the number of blades was also demonstrated. Because DVAWTs are usually not self-starting and must be motored up to begin generation, determining the optimal number of blades for a given location's wind patterns can maximize overall energy production and reduce the number of costly start cycles.<br><br>

THE LEG: PART 5; WALKING ALONE
Alan Larkin O'Donnell
McDonough High School, Pomfret, Maryland, United States

The purpose of the experiment was to determine if a pair of artificial legs walk further through a fixed step program or through a program based on compliant stepping using data from positions of the servos.<br><br>In this experiment if a pair of artificial legs are controlled by a program based off position data returned from the servos used to move the leg, then the program will be able to correct differences in step distance due to slipping or servo movements and be more compliant. Therefore, that program should produce more reproducible and adaptable leg movement. Whereas, the legs controlled by the set program will not be able to correct slips and missed servo movements, causing the leg to have a less accurate movement. <br><br>To perform this experiment, one must first construct artifical legs. In order to reduce the force necessary to move the legs and eliminate the need for a stablization method, construct a movable support stand. Develop two computer programs. One program will give set movement intervals to the leg servo motors creating forward movement. The other program uses feedback from the servo motors to determine their current position and corrects movement for the next step. The last step is to put a straight line down on a smooth surface. To compare the programs record the distance traveled after each step of the artifical legs. Repeat this for 10 full step cycles for both legs 20 times. <br><br>From the data that has been taken while performing the experiment the compliant program produced a further walking distance. The data shows that the when the legs where controlled by the program based off data returned from the servos position the steps had a smaller standard deviation then the legs controlled by the set program. Showing that the “smart” programmed leg will be able to reproduce the same results more often then the “dumb” controlled leg.<br><br> <br><br><br>

Caddo Parish Magnet High School, Shreveport, LA, U.S.A.

In the engineering field of drainage systems, engineers have used a nomograph to find the most economical. A nomograph is a chart used by engineers to find the most economical pipe size and related calculations, that is formed and revise by manual calculations.<br><br>The hypothesis of this project is that by using the programming language REALBasic and math, it is possible to devise a program that operates and does the functions of a nomograph faster than a human and more accurately than a nomograph. The purpose of this project is to create a computer program that does the complete function of a nomograph with regard to trapezoidal open channels, box culverts, and rectagular open channels in addition to circular pipes.<br><br>The experiment was conducted as follows: (1) Study the necessary materials, (2) make the computer program, (3) check the program for accuracy, and (4) if the program does not work, recreate the program.<br><br>The results of the project are that the computer program can find the discharge and velocity, the depth of the water flowing, the wetted perimeter, and the hydraulic radius of a circular pipe; the depth of water flowing in a trapezoid and rectangular open channel and box culvert can be found. These functions are performed faster and more accurately than a nomograph creating a more user-friendly way to find the ideal pipe, open channel, and culvert size. The conclusion is that the answers from the computer program were more accurate and faster supporting the hypothesis. This program can be used by engineers instead of the nomograph to find the ideal pipe, box culvert, rectagular open channel, and trapezoidal open channel size.<br><br>

AN INVESTIGATION OF SOL-GEL TECHNIQUES TO FABRICATE MEMRISTIVE DEVICES
Heather Nicole Leask
Norwich Free Academy, Norwich, CT

In 1971, Leon Chua hypothesized the memristor as the fourth passive circuit element based on a “missing” relationship between charge and flux. In 2008, the first memristor was fabricated. Memristor circuits can potentially be used for computer memory, to emulate neuron functions, as well as increasing memory chip density by an order of magnitude. The fabrication of memristive devices was investigated using three sol-gel methods to create titanium oxide powders including: acid reflux, chelating agent, and metal alkoxide technique. The molarity and procedure were modified to create the desired nanoparticle size of the titanium oxide to emphasize memristive effects. Samples of titanium oxide were characterized using X-Ray Diffraction to identify the composition of the sample. Then Transmission Electron Microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy, and Scherrer equation were used to calculate particle size (TEM and SEM conducted by graduate student). The products of the sol-gels, titanium oxide powders, were pressed into pellets and tested as potential memristive devices. Conductivity testing was performed via the four-point probe test on samples to determine if memristive effects could be detected. The sample layer’s thickness and material were adapted based on the results and the ability of the device to exhibit memristive properties. Memristor properties, including the pinched hysteresis loop, zero-zero crossing on the current-voltage curve, and ability for memory of resistance were found within the devices fabricated from dried metal alkoxide samples. Memristor emulation circuit was breadboarded using semiconductor multipliers and operational amplifiers to simulate memristive effects.

DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A SILENT MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC PROPULSION SYSTEM
Ethan T. Hahn
The Classical Academy, Colorado Springs, CO

The purpose of this experiment was to build an MHD propulsion system that makes, at most, 10% of the noise of the current model. The thruster was also designed so that it has no consumable fuel, except for water and electricity, and emits nothing that would be easily detectable by modern day marine sensing equipment. The thruster was constructed out of plexiglass, which contained stainless steel electrodes and NdFeB magnets, and had an activated carbon filter on the output. I also built a vacuum distillation apparatus consisting of a standard distillation system connected to a vacuum pump. A zinc iodide recycling system was also necessary. Lastly, a vacuum transfer system was constructed from a low power vacuum pump and some flasks to transfer the solution throughout the machine. When the thruster was tested in salt water, it produced 4cm/sec of thrust and 34.4 db. of noise. When it was tested in the zinc iodide solution, it produced 3.5cm/sec of thrust and 0.0 db. The vacuum distillation system produced 10ml of pure water every minute. The original activated carbon filter captured 98.0% of the zinc and iodine, and a re-designed filter captured 99.5%. The test of the MHD system was an overall success. The thruster produced only .26% of the noise of the original system with moderately less thrust, because of the filter. The thrust could be increased with an increased concentration of zinc iodide. A reverse osmosis distillation system would have been able to keep up with the thruster output.

AN INVESTIGATION OF WOOD LAMINATES AND THEIR REINFORCEMENTS
Timothy Meng Rominger
Lighthouse Christian Academy, Bloomington, IN

What is the Effect of Lamination on Material Strength? Can a reinforcing material serve to increase the strength while reducing the thickness and weight of a plywood analog? In this experiment, the effectiveness of lamination on material strength was determined by using several different material combinations that include: how the wood is assembled (laminated or non-laminated, reinforced or non-reinforced), the thickness of the wood, and the direction that the force is applied on the wood (parallel or perpendicular to the grain). The breaking point of the wood was determined by dropping a known mass a measured distance and calculating the kinetic energy at impact. It was theorized that the two ply glued with the force applied perpendicular to the grain would perform the best out of all the possible combinations of the two ply non-reinforced and that aluminum reinforcement would perform best of out of the non-wood materials.<br><br>It was found that one ply with the force applied perpendicular to the grain was many times stronger and harder to break than when the force was applied parallel to the grain. Lamination does increase the breaking point with the force applied parallel to the grain. The results for the reinforced material are still being collected and analyzed. <br><br>In conclusion, the results strongly confirmed the hypothesis on the wood only samples that the laminated two ply with the force applied along the grain would be the strongest out of the other wood only combinations of two ply. Lamination did have an effect on the material strength with the force applied along the grain. It did have an effect when the force was applied perpendicular to the grain, but initially these samples could not be broken due to system limitations. A revised the breaking machine has been employed and the process of collecting new samples to conduct a more in depth analysis is ongoing.

SHAKING WITHOUT BREAKING: AN EXPERIMENT OF EARTHQUAKE-RESISTANT CONSTRUCTION FEATURES
Caley Campbell Howland
FW Buchholz High School, Gainesville, FL

This project tested whether different construction types, heights, and the presence of a foundation affected the susceptibility of a structure to simulated earthquake conditions. A shake table was built using two large pieces of plywood drilled with holes, about six inches apart, through which wire was placed to hold a series of 16 compression springs in place between the boards. Four, rapid-release C-clamps were used for the compression and release of energy in the table. Masonry/block-style structures were made from sugar cubes, using peanut butter as mortar. Frame-style structure were built from popsicle sticks cross-braced with tongue depressors. Both construction types were built in short (4 story) and tall (8 story) versions with, and without a modeling clay foundation. The short block structures were severely damaged by shaking. However, damage was minimized for the small masonry + clay foundation structure, presumably because the modeling clay absorbed much of the energy from the shake table. Overall, frame structures held up better than block structures. This may have been primarily because of increased flexibility. The taller buildings also had less damage done to them, though it was more obvious in the masonry construction. The taller buildings have more ability to sway, which helps to keep them from cracking and displacing because the structures can move with the energy of the earthquake. In summary, the project showed the importance of all three variables (height, construction style, and foundation) in affecting the duribility of mock building structures to simulated earthquake-like forces.

WHAT TRUSS DESIGN WILL SUPPORT THE MOST WEIGHT?
Allison Burr Chislett
Lakeside High School, Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.

Using a controlled span length and a maximum member cross section to determine the weight a truss can hold, information was gathered to help an engineer find the truss design with the highest load bearing capacity. Of the three truss designs that were chosen to be tested, the Pratt truss, the Howe truss, and the Warren truss, it was hypothesized that the Pratt truss design would support the most weight for a given span length. Three trusses of each design were constructed using balsa wood. Each truss had the dimensions of thirty centimeters in length and six centimeters in height. After the three trusses for each design were built, a testing device was designed and constructed. The nine trusses were tested one at a time by adding a load of barbell weights and water to the bucket until failure of the truss occurred. The weight that each truss supported at the point of failure was recorded. Data collected proved the hypothesis wrong, showing that the Howe design had the highest average of 16.5 kg of weight supported, followed by the Pratt design with an average of 16.1 kg. The lowest average belonged to the Warren design with 13.4 kg supported.

DIATOM-CDS NANOSTRUCTURES AS A METHOD TO ENHANCE THE EFFICIENCY OF A DYE-SENSITIZED SOLAR CELL
William Cummings Newberry
Greenwich High School, Greenwich, CT

The Dye-Sensitized Solar Cell (DSSC) provides an inexpensive alternative to standard solar cells. This type of solar cell is greatly inefficient in its production of electricity, as most cells reflect over 70% of the incident light. The integration of light-trapping materials into a DSSC may decrease the amount of light reflected and allow for increased efficiency. Certain algae known as diatoms are characterized by the presence of an internal matrix nanostructure used to trap light for photosynthesis. These structures, biosilica frustules, are composed of naturally produced SiO2 and contain nanoscale complexities not replicable by synthetic preparation. Literature has indicated that it is possible by complex methods to extract these frustules from the interior of a diatom and preserve their structure in a salt. The current study isolated biosilica frustules from the algae Pinnularia sp. and developed a simple method to coat them with a thin layer of the semiconductor, Cadmium sulfide. Characterization of these coated frustules using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) indicated that such methods were successful. Isolated frustules were coated with semiconducting material to allow for their integration into a DSSC without losing the matrix nanostructure necessary for light capture. UV-Vis analysis of CdS coated frustules in comparison to an equivalent CdS coating without frustules demonstrated that these frustules trap up to an additional 5% of incident light and decrease the reflective nature of a surface very similar to a DSSC. Testing of a DSSC integrated with CdS coated frustules in comparison to a standard DSSC indicated that, as expected, frustule incorporation increased the electrical efficiency of the solar cell.

ORTHO KLEAN BRACES BRUSH
Thomas Hauser, Jr. 
Bradenton Academy, Bradenton FL

Food and plaque gets caught between braces and teeth and cannot be removed well with conventional toothbrushes. My hypothesis is that I can build a device that will successfully clean out the food and plaque that gets caught between braces and teeth better than regular toothbrushes. The purpose of this invention is to clean between braces, where other toothbrushes cannot go.<br><br> <br><br>I took a regular toothbrush and removed the bristles and replaced them with four tapered Proxy Brushes. I stuck green beans in between the braces and teeth of an orthodontic model, and moved the new brush (Ortho Klean) back and forth for forty-five seconds. I did the same thing with a regular toothbrush and compared the results. The Ortho Klean brush cleaned out much more of the beans than the regular brush.<br><br> <br><br>The Ortho Klean Braces Brush was found to be easy to use and the four Proxy Brushes allowed it to get into many more places than a normal toothbrush. This proved my hypothesis to be correct; I could build a device that would work better than a regular toothbrush. The Ortho Klean Braces Brush proved to be a very successful at cleaning the places inaccessible to a regular toothbrush. <br><br>

STRENGTHENING NI/AU NANORODS FOR USE IN A BIO-MOTOR
Aaron Michael Wise
Hillsborough High School, Tampa, Florida, U.S.

This project involves work on the implementation of a biomolecular-motor. To successfully create this bio-motor, a central rod with certain properties must be created in a reproducible and efficient manner. This rod must bond with myosin (a property possessed by gold), but it must also be magnetic (so it can be easily observed). Thus, our task is to create a central rod consisting of a gold center capped by nickel on each side.<br><br> This central rod can be formed by electrodeposition, in which metal precipitates into a porous template in the shape of rods. The process can be performed where several different metals precipitate onto the template. Electrodepostion alone was ineffective in bonding the Au and Ni: the samples, when sonicated, would separate into gold rods and nickel rods. Thus, this experiment attempted to anneal the rods so they bond along the metal interface.<br><br> Three annealing conditions were tested, 3 minutes at 300°C, 3 minutes at 400°C and 20 minutes at 400°C. The rods were observed with an SEM, and evidence was found that annealing was successful (the interface between the metals was visibly blurred). A second test, to determine the relative strength of the annealed rods through sonication, was inconclusive: very few of the rods broke apart in any of the samples probably because the Au/Ni interface was not centrally located (the center receives the most energy from sonication). With more sonication, it is expected that the annealed rods would exhibit less separation at the interface than non-annealed rods.

COMPARISON OF ENERGY ABSORPTION HISTORY: TESTING IMPACT RESISTANCE WITH ALUMINUM, FIBERGLASS, AND ALUMINUM/FIBERGLASS LAMINATE
Lakshmi Menaka Ram
Lecanto High School, Lecanto, FL, United States of America

The purpose of this project was to compare the energy history for aircraft wing structure of aluminum, fiberglass (composite), and an aluminum/fiberglass laminate (hybrid) through the means of impact resistance testing.<br><br> Aircraft structures are normally built with a composite or metal exterior to protect itself from incoming objects. Composites if hit with an incoming object, would not show external damage. However, interior would be disrupted. However, if an aircraft is built with aluminum and is hit with an incoming object, external damage will be visible but the interior structure will remain in tact. By combining aluminum and fiberglass, the laminate should be able to have positive qualities of both structures.<br><br>A Five by five inch panel of each specimen was used. The panels were approximately 0.080” to 0.090” thick. The specimen was placed on the drop-height machine to find the time it took for the weight to come in contact with the specimen. By using the force transducer on the Hi-Tech Techniques IQ300 model, values of force were given. Using the time and values of force, four parameters were measured: displacement, force, velocity, and kinetic energy. <br><br>The equations and graphs proved that the hybrid is the best component of the three specimens. It combines advantages of both aluminum and fiberglass. From the four parameters, an equation was used to find out how much energy the plates absorbed. For aircraft structures, this number should be low. The aluminum had the highest amount (2.78 Joules) while the hybrid had the lowest number (1.326 Joules). <br><br>

A KALMAN FILTER TO TRACK MOVING TARGETS IN A DUAL MODE MILLIMETER-WAVE/INFRARED (MMW/IR) SENSOR - A SPECIAL ALGORITHM FOR MULTI-MODE DATA FUSION
Peter Bao-Phuc Nguyen
Fort Walton Beach High School, Fort Walton Beach, Florida, USA

One of the challenges air-to-ground missile designers face today is attacking moving targets in weather, which includes rain, cloud, snow, fog, and dust. Millimeter wave (MMW) sensor can penetrate the atmosphere with high probability of detection, yet with poor range and angle resolution. Infrared (IR) sensor is more susceptible to atmospheric and weather effects; but it provides better resolution. Dual-mode sensor using both MMW and IR can improve detection probability; and if fused data from sensors are used correctly, they can provide high quality track information to the weapon guidance and control processor. A Kalman filter was developed to track moving targets using fused data both from a 35 GHz radar and a longwave (8-12 micrometer) IR sensor. Measurements from the two sensors include target range, velocity, noise, and associated noise to form the covariance matrix for the filter to propagate and to track targets. Missile trajectories in the XY plane with constant altitude (Z axis) are simulated to demonstrate the filter performance in response to the measurements corrupted with White Gaussian noise. Three sets of measurements with different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to represent initial track, mid-track, and terminal track were discretely input to the filters as three separate conditions to demonstrate how well the filter converges to the true missile positions as a function of time. The filter performed especially well during the terminal track when SNR is large. This is important and critical in guiding the weapon during its maneuver toward a target on the ground.

AUTONOMOUS COOPERATIVE LEARNING BETWEEN MULTIPLE ROBOTS THROUGH RF COMMUNICATION
Jason Michael Schuler
Center for Advanced Technologies, St. Petersburg, Florida, U.S.A.

This project concerns the potential of autonomous robotic cooperative learning. The first objective of this project is to design, build, and program two identical robots that, alone, have the mechanical capability to walk, and the electronic capability to sense and control the most effective walking routine. Mechanically, the robots are built to have the ability to individually actuate their four legs in a vertical plane and rotate each in a horizontal plane. Each leg consists of a servo motor and a solenoid. The robots generate a list of the possible positions to try on the servo motors and then sequentially to go through the list. Each robot tries the sequences for taking a step, senses the distance that each step took them, and then stores the information in memory. With this information the programs on each robot sort the most efficient step routines and then retry the top ten sequences. The most efficient step is determined by constants that are set in the program. The pattern continues for whatever direction is desired and can be changed by a constant at the top of the program code uploaded to the robot. The second objective of this project is to enable the two robots to communicate via radio frequency communication and share the results from the steps that they have tried. When first turned on, a robot checks for radio communication with another. If communication is not detected then the robot continues the program to learn on its own. If communication is established then the two robots start at opposite ends of the same list of walking sequences and meet in the middle to share their results with each other. The advantage of this method is that the robots will learn the correct sequence to walk in approximately half the time that it took them alone. To test each robot that determines a walking routine each robot is programmed to establish what it thinks is the most efficient sequence and then light an LED. When the researcher presses a button on the robot after the LED is lit, the robot will continuously run the sequence until it is shut off. This allows the researcher to not only test the time that it took to determine the routine, but also the effectiveness of the routine that the robot established. In conclusion, from the testing done the data taken shows a significant difference between the times of discovery for the robots independently and cooperatively. The difference was, on average, close to half the time with cooperative learning, and the dissimilarity between the actual efficiency of the walking for the two methods was negligible.

MANIPULATING THE DIFFRACTION OF TRAFFIC NOISE OVER A TWO-EDGED TOP SHAPE
Douglas Charles Niemann
duPont Manual High School, Louisville, KY

The purpose of this experiment is to find the optimum angular placement for the edges of a two edged top shape on a highway noise barrier. Top shapes were drawn up in AutoCAD using combinations of 45° incremental placement of the “wings” of the top shape. These top shapes were then entered into a Traffic Noise modeling program, and from that five top shapes were selected for field testing. A barrier was constructed with two hinged edges that could be adjusted to the appropriate position. Brackets were constructed to place the hinged “wings” in the proper position for testing. A 25 by 75 foot room was chosen as the testing site. The barrier was set up in the middle of the room, and the acoustical equipment was set up accordingly. Each barrier was tested at four frequencies, scaled to span the “real life” spectrum of traffic noise. To produce the noise, a sound generator was attached to a speaker and set to the frequency required. Two sound level meters were used to measure the change in sound energy on account of the barrier and respective top shape. Each top shape was tested with the receiver behind the wall in two different positions and at each of the four frequencies. The data was entered into a spreadsheet program for analysis and Insertion Loss was calculated. The average insertion loss of the top shapes was calculated, and it was found that top shape 2a performed best overall.

COMPUTERIZING PSYCHROMETRICS
Lucas Adam Coffin
Canterbury School of Florida, St. Petersburg, FL, United States of America

Programming a psychrometric chart on the computer screen and building an environmental box have been utilized to obtain fast psychrometric data acquisition and graphing. Using high speed thermocouples and a new method of keeping the wet bulb moist sped up the entire process. Visual Basic 6.0 as the platform to program the software and generate the graph was ideal because of its ability to connect to serial devices and send and receive data. The program received the dry bulb and wet bulb temperature data from the thermocouples, with limits from 35°F to 110°F, and plugged them into the Hyland-Wexler Equations to solve for the other properties of air such as Relative Humidity, from 0% to 100%, and Dew Point. This data was then used to plot a point on the computerized psychrometric chart. <br><br>This project was able to reduce the update time from 5 minutes using the sling psychrometer and a printed psychrometric chart, to 3 seconds using the software program, the thermocouples, and the computerized psychrometric chart. This project integrated the hardware and software to create an exceptionally fast receiving and graphing mechanism that displayed the findings on the computer. Through this research, an environmental simulation box, using all the safety precautions outlined in the procedure, such as goggles and gloves, was able to be assembled to prove the program’s speed. <br><br>This research could be advanced to a handheld test instrument or could be applied to air conditioning controls, building management software, and the monitoring of sedated surgical patients.

THE EFFECT OF WOOD HARDNESS ON THE SPEED OF FIRE BY FRICTION
Thomas Peter Foulkes
Terre Haute North Vigo High School, Terre Haute, IN

To begin with, the purpose of this experiment is to discover what combinations of woods with varying hardnesses will decrease the time necessary to form an ember which is crucial in the process of Fire-By Friction. The hypothesis for this experiment states that if a combination of harder wood for the spindles and of softer wood for the floorboard is employed then the time necessary for ember formation will diminish. The null hypothesis for this experiment states that no particular combination of woods with varying hardnesses would decrease the time necessary for ember formation. Before performing the experiment, wood samples are collected and the necessary number of spindles and floorboards for the experiment are created. By using a drill press to apply the downward force and the rotation speed, the human fire by friction process can be simulated scientifically in a controlled situation. Repeating each combination of spindle and floorboard three times with varying hardnesses will provide enough quantitative data necessary for a Chi square calculation to statistically analyze the experimental data. The analysis revealed that a harder spindle paired with softer floorboard will yield ember formation 35.6% faster than a soft spindle on a hard floorboard. This illustrates that the experimental data refutes the null hypothesis because a combination of soft and hard woods produced faster ember formation. Subsequently, the experimental data supports my hypothesis that a combination of a hard spindle and a soft floorboard will produce faster ember formation.

TENNIS TECHNOLOGY
Christine Nichole Gilbert-Crawford
Ballard High School, Louisville, KY

Objective: Over time tennis racquets have evolved in size, weight and materials. When you look at the evolution of racquets you wonder what has changed. <br><br>Was the ball speeds affected by the changes in racquet materials? <br><br>Methods: Four tennis racquets of different time periods and materials were used for the testing. There was also a device that was built during testing in order to take out the human factor. During the human factor each racquet went through multiple testing trials, carried out by numerous serves. Individuals of different gender, age, heights and weights tested each tennis racquet. Then each racquet was placed into a homemade hitting device. This hitting mechanism would eliminate the human variable. <br><br>Result: Small increases were seen through out all four evolutions. The most obvious change in speed occurred within the last two evolutions. This was the evolution of the aluminum Arthur Ashe Composite to the graphite Babolat Pure Team Drive. This is when the data showed signs of jumps within the charts. Without the human factor the change in speeds were not as obvious, but still noticeable. While in the hitting mechanism the speeds stayed consistent for each racquet. The speeds remained below 30mph, with the graphite still showing the highest speeds.<br><br> Conclusion: The ball speeds did increase as the materials changed, with speeds ranging from 56 to 103mph. As the materials in the racquets changed over time, they became lighter and easier to swing. Allowing the individual to add more speed to their swing increased the overall speeds of the balls.

INSULATORS: NATURAL VS. SYNTHETIC
Paul Christopher Greagoff
Ovey Comeaux High School, Lafayette, LA

The most common type of insulation being used today is known as fiberglass insulation. More people are beginning to build homes that are “green” causing housing contractors to look to find natural or organic insulations. These home insulations need to be able to make the homes efficient to reduce heating and cooling costs. Rather than buying synthetic or unnatural insulators for their home, people look for ways to recycle old materials or use renewable resources.<br><br> Experiments were performed to see if natural insulators can work as well as synthetic insulators for residential home use. The hypothesis created for these experiments was that if synthetic insulators are tested against natural insulators, then the synthetic insulators will work more efficiently, especially the fiberglass insulation. The other tested insulations were cotton cloth, polar saw dust, and a synthetic “reflective” insulation.<br><br> A house like structure was built. High wattage lamps were put inside the structure facing toward a wall that contains the type of insulation being tested along with a temperature probe that was used to chart and record temperature changes.<br><br> A ttest was performed and all p-values < 0.05 were considered to be significantly different. The Reflectix material had a significantly higher temperature change and could not be used as a practical home insulation. The poplar saw dust had the smallest change in temperature. This shows that the saw dust could be used as a natural substitute for traditional fiberglass insulation.

WHAT TYPE OF WOOD GLUE IS THE STRONGEST WHEN IT COMES TO HOLDING WOOD TOGETHER?
Lewis Martin Nugent
North Daviess Junior / Senior High School, Elnora, IN

This project is about the strengths of glues that I tested on oak wood. I wanted to know if it’s worth paying a few extra dollars for the top-notch glue or if cheaper glue still got the job done.<br><br> To find out my question I researched and came up with five glues. My dad and I cut the wood to the right size gluing area of 0.25” X 0.75” (0.64cm X 1.9cm). I then glued two pieces of wood together with the five different types of glues three times each. I let it dry 24 hours and then put hooks into the top and bottom, so I could hang increments of weight from it. This allowed me to find the strength of the glues. After this I had my results and conclusion. <br><br> After my first tests I realized that glue held a lot more weight than I thought, so we had to cut down the surface area from an original 1 inch (2.54 cm) to 0.25”X0.75”. Also I didn’t have enough weight to do this, but my engineering teacher had a stress analyzer machine that worked. We modified the machine and did my tests on that. Elmer’s ProBond wood glue held the most weight at 248 lbs., (113 Kg) and in 2nd, Gorilla super glue held 239 lbs (109 Kg). My conclusion is that wood glue does the best, but all-purpose super glues wouldn’t be a bad choice since they are cheaper and do just about as well.

FLY INTO THE SKY
Kelcy Stephen Anderson
Monroe High School:Albany,Ga:United States 

The purpose of this project was to determine how wing shape affects the flight of a glider. The experiment was conducted by building three gliders. Each glider was marked with a different color orange, red , and purple. The purple had the longest wingspan and the short cord(high aspect ratio). The red glider had the second longest wingspan and the second shorest cord. The orange glider had the shorest wingspan and the widest cord(low aspect ratio). An initial starting point was marked on the floor. From this initial starting point the gliders were thrown. The point at which the gliders hit the ground was marked. The distances were measured and recorded. This experiment was repeated five times.<br><br>Initial tests showed the weight of the glider also had an affect on how far the glider will fly. The gliders were modified so their weight would be identical.<br><br> The purple glider traveled an average distance of 308.6 inches. The red glider traveled an average distance of 266 inches. The orange glider traveled an average distance of 213.8 inches. The flight of the gliders depends greatly upon how they were thrown.A launcher was built to launch the gliders to elimitate the variable of human error. <br><br> It was hypothesised that the the purple glider with the long wingspan and the short cord would fly farther than the orange glider with the short wingspan and the wide cord. It was concluded that the purple glider flew farther than the orange glider.<br><br>

ASPHALT RUBBER VS. CONVENTIONAL ASPHALT
Kimberly Natasha Mann
Wingate High School, Ft.Wingate, New Mexico, USA

The need to reduce the occurrence of pavement distress and permanent deformation in roads is a major issue. I will test the physical properties of both Asphalt Rubber and Conventional Asphalt corresponding at various temperatures. Which asphalt can better endure intermediate temperatures, high temperatures, and low temperatures; Asphalt Rubber or Conventional Asphalt? I hypothesized Asphalt Rubber will have greater durability and less decomposition due to its physical propoerties.<br><br>My data shows an overall increase in mass for Conventional Asphalt. I believe most of the weight gain comes from absorbed water, salt crystals and rust. When salt is combined with water, chlorine gives a negative charge, and sodium gives a positive charge. These charges facilitate oxidation of the iron in the nail to form rust. The interference of salt caused increased rusting to the nail, and increased decomposition of the Conventional Asphalt. Conventional Asphalt in tapwater and saltwater gained more mass than Asphalt Rubber. Visual observations of both asphalts show greater amounts of rust and decomposition to Conventional Asphalt. I conclude that Asphalt Rubber is more resistant to ionic deterioration. Due to this ionic resistance, Asphalt Rubber at variuos temperatures held its shape and cohesiveness, while Conventional Asphalt mold disassociated. Asphalt Rubber is the better road surface material.<br><br>The benefits of Asphalt Rubber are beyond reproach. Using Asphalt Rubber will help in recycling old tires, making it environmental friendly and increasing its durability, which over time saves enormous amounts of money and road maintenance work.

TOOTHPASTE WHITENERS: WHICH ONE WHITENS BEST?
Brian Taylor McCarthy
Westover High School, Albany Georgia, United States

The purpose of this experiment was to find out which whitening toothpaste, out of four different types, would whiten various stains best. To accomplish this, thirty four eggs were hardboiled. Each egg was marked with four circles with different colors that corresponded to the toothpaste that was to clean the respective area on the egg. Eight eggs were stained with one of four stains: tea, coffee, soda, or grape juice. Two unstained eggs served as a control. After staining for one hour, each egg was brushed for an equal amount of time with equal amount of paste using Crest Extra Whitening, Aquafresh Whitening, Arm and Hammer Advance White, and Crest Whitening. One egg was left unbrushed to also serve as a control. After cleaning, four judges chose which area on each egg was the whitest. The grape juice stain proved unusable because the stain did not adhere to the egg shell and was easily wiped off. The data analysis revealed that Crest Extra Whitening was the best stain remover four times on soda, seven times on tea, and zero times on coffee. Aquafresh was the best whitener twice on soda, once on tea, and zero times on coffee. Arm and Hammer was the best whitener nine times on soda, twice on tea, and twenty-eight times on coffee.

DEVELOPMENT OF A LINEAR ACTUATOR POSITIONING SYSTEM
Timothy Martin Kirchner
West High School, Iowa City, Iowa, U.S.

Azimuth-Elevation positioning systems, systems designed to point a flat plate in nearly any direction within a hemisphere, generally rely on a pair of rotors or a rotor and a linear actuator to function. However, this system requires very powerful rotors and generates high stresses on the machinery for any large applications. An alternative to the rotor driven system involves a set of linear actuators connected to a solid plate, also known as a Stuart Platform. This allows for more equal distribution of the weight of the system. While the controls of this alternative are more complex, its greater mechanical efficiency makes it a desirable system. Using geometry and physics I have developed a system of control equations that are simple enough to be easily run in real time for any 3 degree of freedom linear actuator system. I have also constructed a model linear actuator system by modifying the basic Stewart Platform design and applied my methods to controlling it. My design consists of three linear actuators, each connected by a hinge to wooden crosspieces such that the bases and the far tip form respective equilateral triangles with the other actuators.

A NOVEL TENSIOMETER UTILIZING A CARBON NANOTUBE ELASTIC CONDUCTOR
Michael Daniel Tom
Greenwich High School, Greenwich, CT

This investigation designs a tensiometer to measure tension, based on a novel multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWNT) dispersed elastomer. An important application of this technology is bladder wall tension measurement in neurogenic bladder patients, whose ability to sense bladder fullness is impaired by disease. Carbon nanotubes have unparalleled electrical and a very large effective surface area, and are ideal for dispersion into an elastomer. A new conductive elastomer, with high elasticity and conductivity of up to 1.14 Siemens/meter, is created containing 20% MWNT in a polydimethylsiloxane elastomer. The film is ideal for internal use by being very flexible, stretchable, nontoxic, and exhibits large, quantifiable changes in resistivity when stretched. Ionic liquid and magnetic alignment tests demonstrate the importance of nanotube bundling for conductance. Magnetic alignment of nanotubes changes conductivity depending on its angle from the direction of current of up to a factor of 2. Infrared spectroscopy and material analyses confirm retention of elastomer properties with nanotube dispersion. Changes in resistance of the film with stretching are used to monitor tension. The unique nanotube dispersion causes the resistance to decrease with stretching because of changes in physical and quantum point contacts between MWNTs. A conductive elastic composite polymer is fabricated using a novel and scalable procedure. A device can be created to measure bladder wall tension designed for surgical implantation, dynamically stretching with the bladder wall as it measures tension.

HOW WING C URVE AFFECTS LIFT
Sam Matthew Post
Juneau Douglas High School, Juneau, Alaska, U.S.

<br><br> To determine how different wing curves affect lift, three wing shapes were tested; small, medium, and a large wing curve. The part of the wing that was tested was the leading edge curve, or the first two inches of the wing. The wings were tested by being placed in a wind tunnel that consisted of an 18-inch diameter fan, a metal contraction cone that created a venturi effect, a transparent test chamber made of Lexan plastic, and a metal diffuser which allowed air to exit the tunnel. When the fan was switched on, the wings rose on a pivoting steel rod that put pressure on a scale. The reading on the scale was the lift for that wing. The results of my experiment supported my hypothesis that the large wing curve would result in the greatest lift, which was an average of 26.8 grams. The medium curve had an average of 25.4 grams, and the small curve produced the least lift at an average of 23.7 grams.<br><br> I feel that aircraft manufacturers would be interested in the results of my experiment because they could reduce the cost of building and flying aircraft. Wings that create more lift could be smaller and lighter. This would allow planes to carry more cargo weight or fuel. Also, planes could fly slower without stalling as easily. This would allow them to land and take off on shorter runways.<br><br>

WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND?

Bauxite deposits in Arkansas abandoned open pit mines are poor quality with alumina levels less than 66% and silica greater than 25%. Development of equipment capable of separating silica from the base materials would make the ore commercially viable. Marketable materials in excess of 72% alumina could be valuable enough to offset the reclamation and cleanup cost of the mines. A machine was developed to accomplish this separation.<br><br> Material separation was achieved through a 2-step process. Initial research indicated the silica is concentrated in very fine particles. A rotary screening device was designed to separate coarse and fine material. A 1.5m section of 150mm PVC tube was perforated with a series of 289 25mm holes. The tube was covered with a 40-mesh screen. The screen allowed fines to pass through the perforation while coarse material traveled the length of the tube. A horizontal support bed was constructed of 4 trunion rollers and a mechanical drive. Mined ore was reduced to size to under 6mm. Crushed ore and water were fed simultaneously into the rotating tube. Tube angle, rotation speed and material feed rates were adjusted to control the separation and production rates. Adjustments were measured and recorded. Profitable product and waste streams were measured for rate, ratio and chemical analysis.<br><br> Bauxite from two different mines was processed. Lab reports conclusively proved the process successful with alumina percentages elevated to 77% and silica reduced to 12%. Recovery rates were approximately 50%. Process control adequately enabled maximization of raw material.

SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES FOR HYPERTHERMIA TREATMENT OF CANCER
Christopher Dean Romanczuk
Randolph School, Huntsville, AL

A series of magnetic alloy nanoparticles were evaluated for use in magnetic fluid hyperthermia therapy for cancer treatment. Hyperthermia therapy is the process of heating cancer cells to temperatures above 42°C which will destroy the cancer cells, or make them more receptive to chemical treatments. The primary objective of this project was to develop magnetic nanoparticles with material properties which would allow them to be heated to an acceptable temperature when excited by a radio frequency alternating magnetic field. This paper presents the results from my study of FePt, Fe3Pt and FePt3 particles, as well as some work developing CuNi particles. Nanoparticles were synthesized chemically, characterized, and tested for their magnetic properties and potential for hyperthermia treatment. The maximum final temperatures attained in the hyperthermia chamber were as follows: FePt 40.2°C , FePt3 37.3°C, Fe3Pt 44.5°C and FePt annealed 42.5°C. The SAR values attained in the hyperthermia chamber were as follows (in Watts per gram): FePt 22.4, FePt3 19.1, Fe3Pt 14.7 and FePt annealed 20.4. These SAR values provide a baseline for comparison to other nanoparticles. The results showed that treatment of cancer cells is possible with these particles which achieved a high enough temperature to destroy cancerous cells when placed in close proximity and excited by an alternating magnetic field.

MACRO-SCALE SYNTHESIS OF VERTICALLY ALIGNED CARBON NANOTUBES VIA REDUCED METAL CATALYSIS
Alexander Raymond Ruyack
Brewster High School, Brewster, NY

The objective of this project is to develop a novel synthetic path to fabricate macro-scale vertically aligned carbon nanotubes. This specific type of nanotube is excellent for use in water desalinization and filtration systems; it is planned for this area of application to be looked into. In addition to nanotube fabrication, low tech catalyst application methods were investigated. The carbon nanostructures were synthesized on quartz or silicon wafer substrates. Iron acetylacetonate was applied as a catalyst on the substrate surface. This modified substrate was placed in a flow type reactor in a pure, anoxic process gas environment. In the reactor the substrate temperature was increased so the organometalic compound was reduced to pure metal nanoparticles. A pretreatment tube was then heated to decompose reactant precursors. A carbon source gas, propane was then introduced into the system. The catalyst allows the low temperature pyrolysis of the carbon containing gas on the substrate surface in a process called chemical vapor deposition. The flow of propane was then stopped and the reactor was cooled in the nitrogen environment. Scanning electron microscopy was done by an outside facility to image the resulting samples. Carbon deposition on the catalyst treated substrate took place and with increasing reaction time carbon deposition continued to happen, resulting in vertical growth. The catalyst application method was successful and growth was significantly greater than other fabrication methods explored. Scanning electron microscopy showed the existence of carbon nanotubes on the substrate surface proving the success of the synthesis method and catalytic reaction.

TESTING THE BIOMECHANICS OF BROILER CHICKENS' TIBIA DUE TO INCREASED ACTIVITY
Katherine Amy Thompson
Cedar Shoals High School, Athens, GA, USA

This study was conducted using broiler chickens. Tests were conducted to determine if the strength of the experimental group's tibia would vary from the control group due to increased activity. Typically, broiler chickens are raised for commercial meat production. As a broiler chicken ages the chicken's tendency to become inactive increases. To determine if activity causes the mechanical properties of the broiler chickens' tibia to change, risers were placed under the experimental group's water dispenser and feeder. The control group was raised in conditions similar to commercially raised fowl. A three-point bend and shear test was used to compare the strength of the tibia. The shear stress was calculated for each tibia by taking the force from the Instron 401 display machine and dividing by the total area of the bone. Bending stress was calculated by using the variables determined in the experiment. The shear stress for the control group ranged from 223 to 1023 PSI and the shear stress for the experimental group ranged from 25 to 500 PSI. The bending stress for the control group ranged from 15,390 to 39,170 PSI, and the experimental group bending strss ranged from 16,457 to 37,480 PSI. The control group experienced both the greatest and smallest experimental values. Based on my question, the mechanical properties of the experimental and control group did not change as I had predicted.

IN VIVO FLOW CYTOMETRY THE SEARCH FOR AN AGENT
Hannah Lois de Jesus Lintag
Little Rock Central High School, Little Rock, AR, United States 

In vivo flow cytometry (FC) is a state-of-the-art technique that will revolutionize disease diagnostics in the near future. Its need is derived from the limitations of conventional in vitro FC. Its invasive nature, inability to be used for long-term monitoring of cells, and the cytotoxicity of the fluorescent labels used are hindrances that prevent the study of blood flow and cell migration within the living organism. Through in vivo FC, the toxicity of the agent remains a problem, thus there is a need to find a suitable agent that is suitable for the human anatomy. The main focus is to analyze the suitability of the chosen agents: nanoparticles and Indocyanine Green (ICG) via transmission digital microscopy (TDM) and through data interpretation of previous experiments, which consists of photoacoustic FC (PAFC) subjection of agent-bound bacteria. TDM provides high-resolution real-time monitoring of the agent in vitro. The visual characteristics of carbon nanotubes (CNT), gold nanorods (GNR), nanoshells (NSH), and ICG as monitoring agents bound to S. aureus were observed through still-frames (27 fps, 50 frames) that were taken of each agent-bacteria sample with two charge-coupled device cameras. Data from previous PAFC subjection of CNT-bound bacteria was the first to be analyzed in this project. Pre-collected data from PAFC subjection (wherein the agents were irradiated by laser within the blood flow) shows that the bacteria’s clearance rate extends over 48 hours. Via TDM, it was observed that the size of the agent-bound S. aureus (individual bacterium or aggregate) is important when considering the agent as well as its behavior compared to unbound S. aureus.

A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT: CLOSING THE FLOOD GATES ON LOW WATER CROSSINGS
Lisa Ann Marie Ogier
Alpena High School, Alpena AR, USA

Numerous low-water bridges throughout Arkansas are unsafe for vehicular travel when water levels rise. A stainless steel gate was designed that would lower to prevent crossing when the water was unsafe and rise when the level was normal.<br><br> An original design was hand drafted and individual components were labeled for concise explanation. In this design, a tube that included a float was utilized to push up a warning gate and hit a trip switch to release the gate. The tube had slots cuts on the lower half to allow water to set the float in motion. The gate was tested 50 times. Ten times it was tested in a sink with a non-banded float; 40 times it was tested with the banded float to determine if the engineering design functioned correctly. A band was placed around the float to correct adhesion and cohesion problems inside the tube encountered during experimentation. The model measured 24.13 cm by 24.13 cm. One model of the gate was constructed by the researcher at a commercial metal fabrication business.<br><br> The project data includes: 1)96% accuracy on lowering, 2) 94% accuracy on raising, and 3) 94% accuracy for lowering and raising.<br><br> In conclusion, a gate model was designed that raised and lowered with the changing levels of water. The gate had a high rate of success with the banded float.

When using modern personal computers, the mouse is the standard device for navigating the computer screen. However, many find using the mouse difficult and face problems moving the pointer, scrolling, clicking and double-clicking. To simplify these operations and eliminate the associated frustrations, I built a device, a glove, which replaces the mouse. This new device has sensors attached to the index finger and pads on each of the other fingers. I wrote a program so that the sensors read movement, while the pads may be used to "click." This allows the user to point their finger to an area on screen and have the pointer move correspondingly. They may then click the pads on any of the other fingers to left and right click, or to turn the pointer off to use the keyboard. <br><br> To test how accurately this glove functions, I had eight human subjects use the glove to perform various operations. I made a small program that instructed the user to point and click as near to the center of a series of boxes as possible, and then give a ranking of their accuracy. I found that the eight subjects were all very successful at using the glove; the overall accuracy of the device was 97.5%. <br><br> Overall, my glove design was a success. In the future I would like to make the glove wireless, as well as incorporate all components into the glove itself.

ENGINEERING MICROFLUIDICS-BASED TECHNOLOGIES FOR RAPID SORTING OF WHITE BLOOD CELLS
Vinay Ashok Raj
duPont Manual High School, Louisville, KY

The isolation of specific sub-populations of WBCs from the rest of the blood is important in finding the pathogenesis of disease processes using gene/protein expression profiling. Current WBC isolation techniques are time consuming and result in manipulation of WBC expressions. Using engineering approaches and basic fluid flow phenomenon in the microscale, a microfluidic sorting device that can isolate WBC sub-populations rapidly based on size has been developed. Osmosis was used to increase the size differences between different cell populations to ensure separation based on size, and a separate device was developed to study this.<br><br> <br><br>I designed all the devices using layout software. The preliminary device consists of a 5000 um X 200 um channel with 2mm deep, 100 um diameter holes. Once cells were introduced into the channel and settled into the wells, then the channel was replaced with deionized water. To establish proof-of-concept, MOLT-3 cells were captured and cell sizes were increased from 8 to 25 microns in 90 seconds. The sorting device consists of spiral channels generating outward. Cells flowing experienced inertial lift forces that tend to push cells to the side walls and lateral deans forces that attempt to balance these forces. At specific conditions, for particles of a particular size, balance of the dean’s and inertial forces occurs, focusing the particles. Proof-of-concept was established and conditions for focusing of 8, 15 and 24 um beads were accomplished. These devices provide the basis for study and sorting of complex WBC populations from blood.

DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A DYNAMIC ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK
Forrest Quinn Friesen
Palmer High School, Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States of America

This project explores the viability of using the interplay of magnetic fields on a two-dimensional surface in conjunction with digital data processing architecture to map changes in self-wiring neural networks. The first key aspect of biological neurons simulated was their ability to connect spontaneously to one another based on the principle that “neurons that fire together, wire together.” This was addressed through the use of a four electromagnet cluster to represent a single neuron. Sixty-four of these triangular clusters were mounted vertically into a Plexiglas block. Small magnetic, ferrous objects were then placed around the exposed magnet cores, where they formed chains between the input and output sections of different neurons. The chains were detected electrically by a computer. The second aspect was that all neurons must behave in same manner. This was accomplished through the software written to dictate firing behavior for the network. The third was that there must be capacity for feedback and looping within the network. This came naturally, because the field plate was demagnetized after each firing cycle, making each previously connected neuron open for receiving new connections. Testing showed that the desired principles were accurately replicated by the system, but that more fine tuning is necessary to bring the device up to full capacity and reliability. The apparatus correctly produces unique maps which show the formation of inter-neuronal connections throughout the network over time, based on a given initial input.

The vehicle also is programmed to stop if there are any obstacles in the way, or change lanes if there is a lane to change to.<br><br>The purpose of this project is to reduce the number of drivers with driver's fatigue and have a less expensive way to automate vehicles by just having a single lane painted on the road. This system could enable "tractor trailers" to drive continuously.<br><br>The process of making this project was to, first, to modify a remote controlled car and buy a computer with a built in I/O board. Also, five infrared sensors would need to be bought so that they can detect the lane and guide the vehicle. Once everything is connected, then the software is written using notepad and in C programming language. Then the program needs to be compiled into binary code and loaded onto the computer I/O board, and, finally, the program needs to be launched. To test the truck, you would need to make a track out of foil tape and paint, this is needed to see if there is a difference between paint and foil tape and to test the truck to see if the infrared properly guides the truck.

INVESTIGATION OF VORTEX GENERATORS USING A WIND TUNNEL
Lindsey Ruth Dombert, Glenelg High School 
14025 Burntwoods Rd. Glenelg, Maryland 21737 U.S.A.

The results of this experimental investigation to determine the effects of vortex generators on the lift of an air foil are reported. The experimental results support the hypothesis that vortex generators increase the lift of an airfoil. The results also indicated that the v-shaped, first vortex generator set had the overall best effect on the air foil's lift, with an average lift increase of the measured values at 9%.<br><br>An in-draft, open jet, wind tunnel was constructed. The maximum speed in the test section was 14 m/s and the variation of speed across the section is 2.9%. A measuring devise, with the capability to adjust the wing's angle of attack, was built in order to measure the wing's lift during testing. The devise was calibrated, before all other data was taken. In addition, a 3-D low aspect ratio (1.8) NACA 0012 wing was constructed. It was determined that the wing, without the airfoils present, stalled near a 12-degree angle of attack.<br><br>After conducting a Reynolds’s number sweep, it was concluded that the lift coefficient is independent of Reynolds number for the Reynolds’s number tested. It was also determined that the vortex generator located at the 10% chord length produced the wing's highest lift. An analysis of the data indicates that all test points have a standard deviation of .0316. The investigation showed that a wing's lift is affected by the addition of vortex generators, but the extent of the affect depends on the design and placement of the vortex generators. <br><br>

James 1:5 Home School, Louisville, Kentucky, USA

The goal of this research effort is to develop a plasma reactor which can be used to synthesize a wide range of unique nanomaterials for future product applications, including electronics, blue lasers, LEDs, drug delivery, high performance coatings, and many other uses. The system has been produced at a very low cost and is highly reconfigurable to allow for a wide range of experimental conditions. The current effort is focused on the growth of silicon oxide and nickel oxide Nanowires. Both of these materials have been produced in this reactor and studied using scanning electron microscopy and EDAX. To obtain the growth of the silicon nanowires, plasma was induced with a 15,000-volt 60Hz power supply and a vacuum pressure of 1 to 5 torr. Hydrogen was flowed into the reactor at a rate of 80 to 81 sccm, nitrogen at 15 to 20 sccm, argon and oxygen at less than 5 sccm. Gallium coated substrates, two quartz and two silicon, were placed on the heater. Substrate temperatures were 750 to 850 Celsius. Plasma was sustained two hours, with a cooling time of 45 minutes. Under SEM, the silicon substrate showed various types of silicon oxide nanowires ranging from 20 to 500 nanometers. The nickel oxide nanowires were found on the quartz disc that was placed under the nickel chrome heating element protecting the base of the heater from direct heat. All of the engineering goals for this reactor were met. I plan to further research bulk synthesis of nanomaterials.

The pump, based on the operational principle of ultrasonic motor, uses two piezoelectric bodies, of which the actuations cause the formation of a traveling wave when voltage is applied.<br><br>The amplitude of the wave was measured using a laser vibrometer to observe whether the pump successfully created a traveling wave. The inability to pump liquid raised a suspicion that the damping effect of the liquid was a major problem the piezopump held.<br><br>The data showed that there was no position, at which the flexural wave had amplitude of 0, which indicated that the pump successfully created a traveling wave. In addition, the fact that the average amplitude of the wave decreased from 0.995 to 0.1 indicated that the damping effect of the liquid was the major cause to the low pumping efficiency of the NASA’s piezopump. The use of thin phosphor-bronze pads and calculating and adjusting the resonance frequency increased the amplitude of the wave and ultimately, the feasibility of the linear piezopump. <br><br>The contributions of this project are twofold. First, a piezopump in linear shape was built with a successfully generated traveling wave. Therefore, this project has demonstrated the possibility of linear piezopump in development and more effective use – no friction generated between the driving forces, less wear, higher power efficiency, ability to reverse the pumping direction, and high accuracy. Secondly, the damping effect of liquid, which seems to have caused the NASA’s rotary piezopump to produce a low discharge pressure, was discovered to have a significant effect on the amplitude of the wave. This discovery will further help the researchers who are currently under a study of designing a pump using the microscopic deformations of piezoelectric materials.<br><br>

A STUDY OF FLUID DYNAMICS TO ELUCIDATE THE EFFECTS OF FOUR DIVERSE SURFACES ON A HYDROFOIL
Kaleb Matthew Stunkard
Osceola High School, Kissimmee, Fl

Using the study of fluid dynamics, I carried out a scientific investigation geared toward discovering a legitimate explanation as to why rougher textures on a hydrofoil are faster than slick surfaces at higher speeds. I set up a pool in an enclosed area for testing. Next, I constructed four individual hydrofoils. I used three types of wet/dry aluminum oxide sandpaper to cover the entire surface of the hydrofoils. Each hydrofoil was given different sandpaper, ranging from rough to fine. The last hydrofoil was left smooth. Eye hooks were then attached to each of the hydrofoils. The hydrofoils were pulled one at a time along the bottom of the pool by a battery powered winch that I built from conduit pipes. A pulley was mounted onto the motor shaft in order to hold mason twine that ran through a series of four pulleys. The other end of the mason twine was attached to an eye hook on the leading edge of the hydrofoils. I used a 100-ohm speed controller to test each of the four hydrofoils at different speeds. Several key measurements and data were collected from each test. The major measurements recorded included temperature, density, velocity and current draw. After generating forty-two graphs of data, I revealed a hidden but very complex pattern. This pattern centered on viscosities, boundary layers, major loss, and fluid flows. The latter lead me to write a program allowing prediction of the best texture to use on a hydrofoil based on specific conditions.

DOES LOWERING A TRUCK'S TAILGATE INCREASE ITS FUEL EFFICIENCY?
John Christopher Tarleton
Union Grove High School, McDonough, GA, USA

Purpose - Over the past few decades, it has become a common belief that one way to increase a pickup truck's fuel efficiency is to lower its tailgate. While this theory may seem logical to many people, many engineers disagree. The purpose of this project is to test rather or not a lowered tailgate increases a truck's fuel efficiency.<br><br>Hypothesis - I believe that if the amount drag is measured on a model truck with an upright tailgate, and compared with one with a lowered tailgate, the truck with the upright tailgate will have less drag, creating better fuel efficiency.<br><br>Procedures - This common theory was tested by measuring the amount of drag a model truck had with each tailgate configuration. This was accomplished by measuring the distance that drag forced the truck backward in a home-built wind tunnel. The data from each test was then recorded and averaged. The experimentation continued with taking pictures of the airflow over the bed of the truck to determine the cause of the drag differences.<br><br>Results - According to the experiment, when compared with a truck with an upright tailgate, drag increased 9.43% by lowering the tailgate and 15.90% by removing the tailgate. A Tonneau cover decreased drag by 11.53%. These results prove that lowering a truck's tailgate actually decreases its fuel efficiency.<br><br>Conclusion - These results support my hypothesis that a truck has less drag with the tailgate in the upright position, creating better fuel efficiency.<br><br>

CARS ON MARS: THE DEEP FREEZE
Daniel Mark Ellsworth
Buena High Shool, Sierra Vista, Arizona,United States of America

I began this experiment because of my interests in the space program, my goal to work at NASA and current events such as the recent landings of the Mars rovers. My hypothesis is that the temperature on Mars will affect the structural integrity of material used on Mars rovers. To test this hypothesis I needed to achieve several goals. First, to simulate the temperature on Mars. Second, to create a way of testing how much stress the materials could withstand. To achieve the first objective I used refrigerators, freezers and dry ice. The second objective was reached with the construction of the test board, which allowed the testing of the materials to the same degree each time. <br><br> To conduct the experiment I cooled the materials to different temperatures within the range of the Martian climate. Next, the samples were tested for three stress factors; flexibility and resistance to pressure and pounding. Signs of stress were recorded using a scale of no stress, minimal stress, medium stress, major stress, and structural failure. Some of the materials tested did poorly in some areas but did well in others; which suggests it would not be suitable for some operations of a rover. The data showed that the materials stressed at about the same magnitude regardless of the temperatures. In conclusion, my hypothesis was wrong: the effects of temperature on the materials of a Mars rover would be negligible.<br><br>

THE THERMODYNAMICS OF CERAMIC GLAZING
Patrick Byrne Rademaker
Saint Xavier High School, Louisville, KY

The purpose of my project is to see what affects the amount of heat that can pass through a glazed ceramic tile; whether it be the glaze ingredients, clay ingredients, number of dips in glaze, or heat at which the tiles were fired. <br><br>I began my science fair project by going to talk to my ceramics teacher. I started out by defining the parameters of my project, and I decided that I would be working with 8 different glaze colors (4 from midfire and 4 from lowfire) and two different clay colors. All of my test tiles were created generically the same size at 4 inches long by 2 inches wide by .25 inch thick, and were initially fired for the first time at 1875° Fahrenheit by my ceramics teacher. At this point, I was able to glaze my test tiles, and I glazed 6 tiles for each glaze color. There were 3 tiles of red clay and 3 tiles of white clay, and these tiles were either coated with 1, 3, or 5 coats of glaze (all of the ingredients and percentages for the glazes and clays are included with the test tiles). After being glazed, they were placed in their respective kiln by my ceramics teacher, and fired for the second and final time. The mid fire kiln fires at a maximum of 2400° Fahrenheit and the low fire kiln fires at a maximum of 1875° Fahrenheit. After being unloaded by my ceramics teacher, I used a thermal heat gun on my ceramic tiles to test the heat resistance of each tile. In order to prevent getting skewed data, I enclosed the tiles in a wet clay sheath. They were fired upon by the thermal gun at a temperature of 150° Fahrenheit for 30 seconds. My results showed that low fire glazes on white clay with five dips retained the greatest amount of heat. I went back and tested my data again and still got a difference in temperature of around 18° Fahrenheit (with the low fire white clay being 18° higher than the mid fire red clay). In conclusion, I can assume that the clay color, number of dips in glaze, and level of firing do affect the heat retention of a ceramic piece. Since there are multiple variables in my experiment, it is difficult to know how much each ingredient affects the finished product.

WHAT'S IN YOUR CONCRETE?
Ashley Nicole Spooner
Ursuline Academy, New Orleans, LA

The purpose of this experiment is to determine which concrete mixture is strongest under compression or applied pressure. I chose this experiment because I wanted to learn about the properties of concrete and the effect of its components. I wanted to know if it was possible to use recycled materials, such as glass or shredded rubber, to create a strong and workable concrete mixture. Also with this experiment, I hope to discover a more resourceful way in mixing and forming concrete. I hypothesized that the pea gravel mixture, which contains the densest coarse aggregate, will require the greatest amount of pressure to reach its maximum compressive strength.<br><br>In this experiment, I designed three concrete mixtures with three varying coarse aggregates of pea gravel, shredded rubber, and glass. The mixtures were designed based on the volume and densities of each component. Strength compression tests were conducted on 12 cylinders. Compressive stress is the amount of stress an object can hold under pressure. The density of pea gravel was 101.5 lbs/ft^3, the density for crushed glass was 87.2 lbs/ft^3, and the density for shredded rubber was 31.75 lbs/ft^3.<br><br> <br><br>I conducted tests on all 12 cylinders and concluded what coarse aggregate had the highest average compressive strength (psi). The average compressive strength (psi) for pea gravel was 5125.208 psi, shredded rubber was 1501.215 psi, and crushed glass was 4840.343 psi. My experiment proved that the denser coarse aggregate, pea gravel, was the strongest concrete mixture under pressure.

THE HOUSE THAT DOESN'T BURN
Heather Ashley Martin
Jeffersontown High School, Louisville, Kentucky, United States

The purpose of this experiment was to design and develop a heat transfer device, designed to function as an active thermal barrier, capable of redirecting heat away from a structure’s outside wall, thus maintaining a cooler external temperature preventing the structure from reaching the temperature necessary for it to burn. The introduction of a heat transfer device within the walls of structures located within fire prone areas would significantly help in the prevention and reduction of property loss as a result of uncontrollable wild fires within our nation’s forests. Through the utilization of a heat transfer device, known as R.E.D. for “Redirected Energy Device,” heat can be successfully redirected away from a structure’s outside wall, thus maintaining a cooler external temperature preventing the structure from reaching the temperature necessary for it to burn. This experiment applied the principles of both a deluge and water mist sprinkler system, with the concepts of convection and conduction, in a manner not currently being utilized. The R.E.D. prevented the structure from burning through a different application of these principles and both water systems. The experiment did not attempt to put out a fire. Instead, it focused on preventing a fire from engulfing a structure lying in its path. Its design protects a house from burning, it is “The House That Doesn’t Burn.”

''CAN THE WING ANGLE AND DESIGN AFFECT THE FLIGHT OF AN AIRPLANE?"
James William Armstrong
Owensboro High School, Owensboro, KY, US

The purpose of my project was to see the effect of the wing angle and design on the flight of paper airplanes. I selected five known designs and five experimental designs and tested each one for lift, glider like flight pattern,time they stayed in the air and the effect of a head wind. I threw them into a seven mile/hour head wind and documented my time. I dropped each one from a height of 20 feet and I measured the distance from where I dropped to where the palne landed. From my experimentation I have found out that paper airplanes with shorter fuselages and wider wingspan flew more like gliders, where as those with longer fuselages and shorter wingspans flew more like jets. Furthermore, I discovered that those planes which flew like gliders remained in the air longer and had a tendency not to fly straight.

FROM NATURE TO SOLAR CELL: OPTIMIZING THE TOBACCO MOSAIC VIRUS COAT PROTEIN SCAFFOLD FOR ORGANIC LIGHT HARVESTING
Vicki Hsieh
California High School, San Ramon, CA

Self-assembling tobacco mosaic virus protein (TMVP) scaffolds offer an attractive route towards synthetic light harvesting systems through its cost efficiency, organic structure, and nanometer-sized building blocks that can order chromophores into arrays reminiscent of the natural photosystem. Yet, notable problems with this light harvesting assembly include the protein scaffold’s sensitivity to changing pH and overall fragility of the structure. Through this project, I aim to solve the stability problem through modifications of the TMVP DNA to create additional functionalities that will stabilize the TMV scaffold.<br><br>-<br><br>Through experimentation, I discovered that a transamination reaction that would result in additional functionality of an aldehyde tag could solve this problem of instability. Through taking advantage of the hollow-tube-like structure of the scaffold, I modified TMV and used a PLP reaction to add aldehyde tags to the inner attachment sites where polyethylene glycol (PEG) cross-links could extend across the center of each self assembling ring of TMV protein. This process would promote and strengthen the disk and rod shape phases of the TMV and expand the pH-tolerance range of the TMV scaffold during experimentation. I tested this new modification with arrays of chromophore dyes, different assembly phases, and PEG cross-link attachments and found that this new aldehyde tag did not interfere with existing TMV light harvesting functionalities. The contributions of this project, in addition to optimizing the TMV scaffold for organic light harvesting, can also attract the prospects of future bioengineering projects with the TMV scaffold through this current and more robust design.

CAN BACTERIAL CELLULOSE BE CHEMICALLY MODIFIED AND USED AS A PROTON EXCHANGE MEMBRANE IN A HYDROGEN FUEL CELL
Terri Beth Watson
Owensboro High School, Owensboro, Kentucky, United States

The purpose of my project was to investigate if bacterial cellulose could be used as a proton exchange membrane in a hydrogen fuel cell. During the construction phase, a cube of bacterial cellulose was soaked overnight in distilled water, covered with plastic wrap, flattened, and dried for 24 hours. This process was repeated with another cube. Eighteen hours into the process, the second cube was slightly overlapped onto the completely dried first cube and adhered through H-bonding. This was repeated until a panel of dried cellulose two layers thick was achieved, and then with another group of cubes after being soaked in ammonium hexachloropalladate. Palladium was absorbed from the solution, forming modified bacterial cellulose called palladium-cellulose, which was H-bonded to each side of the two-layer panel of dried cellulose, completing the proton exchange membrane. The fuel cell was assembled and the membrane sealed. During the testing phase, the electrolyser was connected to the solar cell and filled with 10ml of distilled water. It decomposed the water into oxygen and hydrogen gases which were sent through the fuel cell to purge the system. Hydrogen was then stored until 10ml of hydrogen was collected. The fuel cell was connected to the load measurement box and hydrogen again delivered to the fuel cell. After varying the pressure of delivery of the hydrogen, I observed a voltage reading on the load measurement box. From my research I found that chemically modified bacterial cellulose is capable of catalyzing hydrogen and generating an electric current.

TO BUILD A BETTER HARBOR
Elise Dawn Sorum
Valdez High School, Valdez, Alaska, USA

Currently two designs are proposed for a new harbor in Port Valdez. One design is a 3:1 rectangle using a semi-permeable wave barrier and the other has a 2:1 aspect ratio with a rubble mound breakwater. This project’s purpose was to test each of these designs and determine if they could be improved upon utilizing an alternative design combining the harbor shape that circulates most effectively with the best attributes of each proposed breakwater. It was hypothesized that a design with a 1:1 aspect ratio, incorporating both a rubble mound breakwater and a semi-permeable wave barrier would be more effective than either proposed design.<br><br> Scale models were built to test each design and the movement of ten drifters were tracked throughout a simulated 24 hour tide cycle. Five trials were conducted per shape.<br><br> The harbor with the rubble mound breakwater, circulated well except in the rear where the current slowed drastically.<br><br> The semi-permeable wave barrier model showed increased horizontal circulation since the water flowed in and out from under the barrier.<br><br> The alternative design had strong circulation, which was enhanced by the semi- permeable wave barrier, the curvilinear shape, and the small entrance channel. The velocity of the current was greater in the back than in the front of this design.<br><br> In conclusion, the hypothesis was supported. Building the alternative design in Port Valdez would provide for better circulation, improved water quality, reduced damage to the marine ecosystem, and lower cost than either of the other proposals.

VIRUS-BASED LITHIUM ION BATTERIES
Kevin Richard Kaufmann
Clovis High School, Clovis, CA

This project attempted to create fully functional nanowires that could be used as a battery electrode. An objective of the project is that the synthesized nanowires be uniform in structure.<br><br> This uniformity is achieved using a bacteriophage (a virus that infects bacteria) as a template for precisely positioning materials. The bacteriophage is transformed into a template by changing the functionality of certain proteins through genetic modifications in the M13 genome. The addition of a tetraglutamate to a specific protein produces a M13 clone designated as E4 and allows iron phosphate (FePO4) to bind to the phage. <br><br> Fully functioning nanowires were successfully produced from FePO4•E4 using this method and were assembled into virus-based, lithium ion batteries that were capable of being charged and discharged repeatedly. The FePO4•E4 nanowires are more environmentally friendly and less costly to make than existing FePO4 battery components. The FePO4•E4 battery is almost completely biodegradable. The only part of the battery not yet biodegradable is the electrolyte. The virus-based batteries could hold any voltage, except that the electrolyte for lithium ion batteries is only stable from approximately 1 volt to 5 volts. Since the virus-based batteries are also rechargeable, they may repeatedly be charged and used again after being discharged.<br><br> These virus-based batteries are both environmentally friendly and economical. They last longer than existing commercially available batteries and may help to create less waste for the future. The nanowires can be used to build batteries that are capable of powering most devices that require a power source.

CARBON FIBER MAKES A POINTE, PART DEUX
Harper-Grace Niedermeyer
Catholic High School, Huntsville, AL

This is a continuation from my 2007 project Carbon Fiber Makes A Pointe, which found that it was feasible to make a pointe shoe out of composite materials. With that knowledge I set out to create a wearable shoe that can be worn for a period of time to perform field testing for the 2008 Science and Engineering Fair. Through much trial and error I have created a toe box and shank combination that is substantially more durable when being worn by the dancer. It is a blend of materials, fiber glass and carbon fiber. Many different shank variations have been tested, however the design of the shank has not been finalized. Shoes were created for five dancers, from their own unique molds, and field testing was done. Each dancer tested three different models, and evaluated the three against each other and against traditional shoes. Through the dancer's feedback I have found that the curvature in the shoe needs to begin in the toe box instead of starting where the shank begins. Overall the dancers believed the shoes performed well and were comparable to traditional shoes but required no break in period.

STREAMLINING PICKUP TRUCKS PART II
John Christopher Tarleton
Union Grove High School, McDonough, Georgia, USA

Engineering Goal - Pickup trucks typically have a high degree of air resistance, which in turn causes them to have lower gas mileages than other types of vehicles. The goal of this project is to investigate and design new methods to improve a pickup truck's aerodynamics and therefore increase its gas mileage.<br><br>Hypothesis - A pickup truck’s aerodynamics has plenty of room to improve. I believe that by designing a method to reduce the turbulence behind the truck’s cab and tailgate to make it more streamline, a pickup truck’s aerodynamic drag can be drastically reduced.<br><br>Procedures - Research was done on the aerodynamics of pickup trucks as well as the design of wind tunnels. Using this information, a wind tunnel was built, and a scale model of a Chevy Silverado was carved. Several methods for making a pickup truck more streamline were then developed and tested. The results obtained were then analyzed.<br><br>Results – Tonneau covers significantly reduce the drag of a pickup truck. A partial tonneau cover with a curved overhang dramatically reduced the truck's drag. Though the other additions tested did not yield a reduction in drag over that of the basic tonneau cover, their additions led to a better understanding of pickup truck aerodynamics and which airflows yielded the best reduction in drag.<br><br>Conclusion - Several methods proved successful for decreasing a pickup truck's aerodynamic drag. The data obtained can be further analyzed and the designs improved to give a more substantial decrease in the truck's aerodynamic drag.<br><br>

3, 2, 1, IGNITION
Phillip Andrew Latus
Sulphur Rock High School, Sulphur Rock, AR , USA

Do the speed and the force generated between models of rocket engines differ? The goal is to test these two values using a test apparatus in a limited space.<br><br> Two testing apparatuses were built to determine force and speed. A model rocket engine was mounted in the engine holder that is connected to the bicycle rim, which was mounted on the speed testing apparatus. The engine was ignited with 2 D batteries. When the engine was ignited the stopwatch was started. The stopwatch was stopped by a toggle switch when the engine stopped burning. The rocket engine was secured to the force testing apparatus with a dual force detector attached to the other end and ignited.<br><br> Data collected showed the A8-3 produced 4.9N over .45 s and an average speed of 3.57ft/s over 4.5s. The B4-4 rockets produced 2.68N over 1.17s and a speed of 10.12ft/s over 5.83s. The C6 engines were close with category force of 4.20N over 1.73s and an average speed of 16.66ft/s over 6.75<br><br> The A8-3 rocket had the slowest speed and greatest average force, while the B4-4 had the least force. The C6-3 and C6-5 rocket produced similar peak force and average applied force, yet the speed produced was markedly different. The C6 category of engines showed that the C6-3 produced more force, but ejected faster than the lower thrust produced by C6-5 engine.<br><br> The contribution of this project is the production of a limited space testing apparatus for force and speed of rocket engines. <br><br>

MAXIMIZING SOLAR THERMAL POWER GENERATION
Jeremy Halden Fowers
MAST Academy, Miami, Florida, United States

Heat transfer media are commonly used in solar thermal power plants as an intermediate between the sun’s energy and electricity generating steam system. This study was designed to determine if a medium’s peak temperature, time to heat to 100 ºC, and time to cool to 100 ºC from its peak temperature could be predicted using regression modeling. Water, NaCl, mineral oil, silicone oil, antifreeze, ethylene glycol, glycerol, Al(HO) 3, CaCl, NaNO3, KNO3, a 50/50 NaNO3 and KNO3 mixture, and a 60/40 NaNO3 and KNO3 mixture were tested to acquire data for the regression models. <br><br>A Type K temperature probe was attached to an XPlorer PASPort system to collect data. The test was conducted by placing 20 grams of a substance into a black test tube, which was mounted in a parabolic dish. A 500 watt incandescent lamp was focused on the dish for 30 minutes, and then turned off, allowing the substance to cool for 60 minutes. <br><br>The regression models performed had high R values, ranging from 0.75 to 0.97, which allow the accurate prediction of heat transfer using density and specific heat as predictors in regression equations. The equations show that a medium with higher density and lower specific heat will perform better than a medium with lower density and higher specific heat.<br><br>A continuation of this experiment should select promising media based on the equations and test them to both determine the viability of the equations and discover an ideal heat transfer medium.

AUTOMOTIVE INNOVATION: WIRELESS AUTOATTENDANT
Marc L Ingram
Ballard High School, Louisville, KY USA

With the rapid progression of technology in today’s society concerning the automotive industry, new innovative applications are becoming a necessity for car companies. In this project, the goal of the design was to simplify the way a person initially interfaces with their vehicle while also solving some of the most problematic issues that thousands of people run into everyday. The idea behind the Ingram Auto-Attendant, is the concept of being able to call your car with a regular cell phone (or pay phone for that matter) and hook up with an auto-attendant interface (this interface is very similar to that of a business answering machine that routes calls to specific locations in a store or building). When the auto-attendant picks up, it asks a series of questions concerning your car and the designated task that you wish for it to perform. After that, it asks for a six digit D.O.S.A. password for extra security then executes the task given. This can be as simple as unlocking doors in case of an accidental mistake, heating the car, turning on the ignition, or simply turning off/on the alarm. The tasks are executed at the touch of a button and can virtually be done anywhere in the world. With the ability and potential that this invention holds (practical uses go far beyond the automotive market), no wonder why thousands would be interested in an idea that simplified their life while adding a bit of luxury to a car.<br><br>Before the actual construction of the Auto-Attendant was started, a flow chart of possible functions that the Auto-Attendant would perform was mapped out. For example, from the main unit, a call would get routed to the switch turning on heated seats in a car. From there electronic components were laid out so the right action would be performed. Due to the absence of a similar product, a breadboard design with electronic components was put together creating a piece of the overall functionality of the whole design.<br><br>

REGENERATIVE DIESEL FUEL PRODUCTION IN A FLEX FUEL VEHICLE UTILIZING VEGETABLE OIL AND CATALYTIC HYDROCRACKING
Andrew Michael West
Conifer Senior High School, Conifer, CO

Previous experimentation by this author demonstrated the feasibility of producing high-grade diesel fuel hydrocarbons from vegetable oil. Vegetable oil was cracked using low temperature catalysis on a palladium catalyst with hydrogenation of the resultant fractions. Independent laboratory analysis verified the feasibility of fuel production using this method by analyzing the fuel using gas chromatography and flame ionization detection. This current series of experiments seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of using the exhaust gas of a diesel engine and a palladium reaction bed to produce sufficient heat required to boil vegetable oil and produce a hydrocracked fraction real-time. The resultant fuel is collected and used to power the vehicle. <br><br>A prototype device has been engineered using standard off-the-shelf materials allowing an easy retrofit of any exhaust gas system. This device incorporates a stainless-steel reaction vessel, palladium pellets from a GM type mid-1980s catalytic converter, and a custom engineered exhaust gas heater. Used vegetable oil from deep-fat fryers is filtered and metered into the hydro-cracker while the engine is operating. Hydrocracked vegetable oil is hydrogenated and condensed after passing over the super-heated catalyst. The resultant diesel fuel is separated from any water condensate and used as a fuel source while the engine is running.

In this project, the goal of the design was to simplify the way a person initially interfaces with their vehicle while also solving some of the most problematic issues that thousands of people run into everyday. The idea behind the Ingram Auto-Attendant, is the concept of being able to call your car with a regular cell phone (or pay phone for that matter) and hook up with an auto-attendant interface (this interface is very similar to that of a business answering machine that routes calls to specific locations in a store or building). When the auto-attendant picks up, it asks a series of questions concerning your car and the designated task that you wish for it to perform. After that, it asks for a six digit D.O.S.A. password for extra security then executes the task given. This can be as simple as unlocking doors in case of an accidental mistake, heating the car, turning on the ignition, or simply turning off/on the alarm. The tasks are executed at the touch of a button and can virtually be done anywhere in the world. With the ability and potential that this invention holds (practical uses go far beyond the automotive market), no wonder why thousands would be interested in an idea that simplified their life while adding a bit of luxury to a car.<br><br>Before the actual construction of the Auto-Attendant was started, a flow chart of possible functions that the Auto-Attendant would perform was mapped out. For example, from the main unit, a call would get routed to the switch turning on heated seats in a car. From there electronic components were laid out so the right action would be performed. Due to the absence of a similar product, a breadboard design with electronic components was put together creating a piece of the overall functionality of the whole design.<br><br>

REGENERATIVE DIESEL FUEL PRODUCTION IN A FLEX FUEL VEHICLE UTILIZING VEGETABLE OIL AND CATALYTIC HYDROCRACKING
Andrew Michael West
Conifer Senior High School, Conifer, CO

Previous experimentation by this author demonstrated the feasibility of producing high-grade diesel fuel hydrocarbons from vegetable oil. Vegetable oil was cracked using low temperature catalysis on a palladium catalyst with hydrogenation of the resultant fractions. Independent laboratory analysis verified the feasibility of fuel production using this method by analyzing the fuel using gas chromatography and flame ionization detection. This current series of experiments seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of using the exhaust gas of a diesel engine and a palladium reaction bed to produce sufficient heat required to boil vegetable oil and produce a hydrocracked fraction real-time. The resultant fuel is collected and used to power the vehicle. <br><br>A prototype device has been engineered using standard off-the-shelf materials allowing an easy retrofit of any exhaust gas system. This device incorporates a stainless-steel reaction vessel, palladium pellets from a GM type mid-1980s catalytic converter, and a custom engineered exhaust gas heater. Used vegetable oil from deep-fat fryers is filtered and metered into the hydro-cracker while the engine is operating. Hydrocracked vegetable oil is hydrogenated and condensed after passing over the super-heated catalyst. The resultant diesel fuel is separated from any water condensate and used as a fuel source while the engine is running.

CHARACTERIZATION AND OPTIMIZATION OF THE BONDING FORCES OF A NOVEL SILICON NANO-WIRE GECKO BIOMIMETIC ADHESIVE
Zoe Elise Dubrow
Carlmont High School, Belmont, CA

The method by which geckos climb smooth vertical walls confounded scientists for over 100 years, until the discovery in 2000, that gecko feet are coated with millions of tiny hairs several nanometers in diameter. When a gecko foot is pressed to a surface the pliability of the tiny hairs permits them to draw close enough to the opposing surface to activate intermolecular bonding forces, allowing the gecko to adhere. In this project the bonding properties of a silicon nano-wire biomimetic gecko adhesive was characterized and its bonding forces optimized. It was found that capillarity forces caused by water evaporating off of the silicon nano-wires increased adhesion forces by a factor of almost 7x compared to applying the nano-wire surface dry. It was also determined that as the contact angle of a surface increases, the strength of adhesion to the silicon nano-wire surface decreases. On a smooth wetted low contact angle glass surface, adhesion forces above 10 Newtons per centimeter squared (N/cm2) were measured, greater than the adhesive force of most geckos. Adhesion forces of the silicon nano-wires to biological surfaces such as porcine intestine and pig skin were found to be high enough to fail cohesively opening up a spectrum of medical applications. Finally to demonstrate the capability of the biomimetic gecko adhesive, the first documented suspension of a human from a vertical wall using nano-fiber adhesion was successfully demonstrated.

CONTINUOUSLY VARIABLE TRANSMISSIONS, AN EFFICIENT ALTERNATIVE TO THE MODERN TRANSMISSION. PHASE III
Brian James Beyt
Catholic High School, United States, New Iberia, La 70563

This project represents the further development of a transmission different from a traditional “five speed” transmission. The design is similar to a prototype present in some hybrid cars, but represents a significant advance. In previous research (Phase One), a preliminary design was created and modeled, and in Phase Two, an advanced design based on the concept of an expanding gear was developed and modeled. In this research (Phase Three), a new design was created which operated mechanically rather than hydraulically and investigations were undertaken on the maximum ratio change, overall efficiency, and performance of the new format.<br><br> The new design consisted of two mechanically expanding gears. Each consisted of 16 expandable arms in two groups of eight. Unlike the prototype created in Phase Two, the mechanical design used a series of sliding cones arranged in an “hour glass” shape to expand and contract the arms of each gear. The two gears are aligned parallel to one another, and as the two spans of one gear expand and contract, the opposite two expand and contract in reverse, allowing the machine to use a fixed length belt or chain. Because of insufficient funds necessary to machine an actual working prototype, the design was created and drafted using a CAD program, and the digital prototype was tested using the program. <br><br> Range of rpms, range of speed, and theoretical rate of fuel consumption were all determined during simulation Using this data, the theoretical effect that the transmission would have on a vehicle’s performance was estimated. The design proved more fuel efficient, creates a smoother acceleration, and accomplishes the same goal as the modern transmission, only doing so with greater ease and efficiency. The data received from the tests was used when comparing the mechanical prototype to several other formats. The design has multiple uses and has great potential for future development.

OPTIMIZATION OF CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF CARBON NANOTUBES
Robert Benjamin Sobelman
Staples High School, Westport, Connecticut, USA

Carbon nanotubes have many potential applications. They are useful because they are an allotrope of pure carbon; the atoms are arranged in an ordered and geometrically stable configuration. This gives them unique mechanical, electrical, and optical properties that can be exploited in a large number of applications. Carbon nanotubes can be synthesized using several different methods, none of which have been optimized for large-scale manufacturing. Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) is one method of synthesizing Multi-Walled Carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). It employs a tube furnace and uses a catalyst/carbon-source mixture to precipitate MWCNTs onto a silicon dioxide substrate. Without optimization of this method, the MWCNTs produced are not uniform and are not suitable for mass production. In order to manufacture usable MWCNTs using CVD, the temperature at which the MWCNTs were grown was investigated. The optimal temperature to synthesize MWCNTs was determined to be between 950 degrees Celsius and 1050 degrees Celsius. This temperature range produced a high yield of perpendicularly aligned MWCNTs that averaged a length of 115µm. Temperatures greater or smaller produced MWCNTs not as well aligned with average lengths no greater than 20µm. These results will allow MWCNTs to be synthesized in higher yields with desirable mechanical, electrical, and optical properties. MWCNTs with these properties will be able to be implemented in many new applications. For example, these MWCNTs could be used as a mechanical substrate, or scaffold, for cell transplants in the retina where it is difficult for cells to adhere.

THE KUDZU QUESTION: A USEFUL, RENEWABLE RESOURCE?
Kathryn Ann LeCroy
Jefferson County International Baccalaureate School, Birmingham, AL

The Kudzu vine, Pueraria lobata, is an overbearing plant that can be found predominantly in the Southeastern United States. After researching the process of papermaking with plant fibers, Pueraria lobata showed potential with the bast fibers within its inner bark. Pueraria lobata fibers were collected and processed into fiber pulp. The pulp was used in varying concentrations. To test the strength of the paper created, a tensile strength testing procedure and simple machine were created. Seventy square–inch samples in each test group were tested for general uniformity, which is an important factor effecting tensile strength testing, and trimmed means indicated the ten best representative samples for each group. Two control groups were added, notebook paper and cardstock paper, to contrast from the handmade paper during tensile strength testing. The independent variable is the concentration of Pueraria lobata used in sheets of paper made, and the dependent variable is the viability of paper during tensile strength testing. Controlled variables include all aspects of the papermaking process and general methodology of tensile strength testing using the simple machine created. The hypothesis that using data from tensile strength testing, fibers from the inner bark of the kudzu vine, Pueraria lobata, can be a viable source for papermaking was confirmed by the results. For greater uniformity of fibers however, the papermaking and tensile strength testing procedures must be employed in a more systematic setting than inherently possible during this experiment.

THE BRAIN MACHINE: ALTERATION OF PERCEIVED STRESS LEVELS BY AUDITORY AND VISUAL STIMULATION
Farrah H. Hassan
Manatee High School, Bradenton, FL

If specific frequencies of lights and sounds are pulsated into the human brain, will the brain synchronize its brain waves to the lights and sounds inducing a change in its mental and emotional state? If the human brain will synchronize its brain waves to the pulsating sounds and lights then the subject's blood pressure, pulse and perceived stress level will change. <br><br>The Brain Machine was constructed so that different sequences could be programmed into the microcontroller through the serial port. Two LED's were mounted on the goggles and connected to a printed circuit board. A stereo headphone jack was also added. The codes for the relaxed and hyper sequences were then programmed into the machine and subjects were tested. <br><br>Six subjects’ blood pressures and pulses were recorded as they were entrained in the relaxed sequence. They were also surveyed about their perceived stress levels before and after experimentation. The results were inconsistent. To reduce this variability, the codes were refined and the testing method modified so that the experiment would produce more accurate results. <br><br>Three subjects were tested using the revised method and new hyper sequence. All three showed an increase in blood pressure and stress levels. Four subjects were tested using the new relaxed sequence. There was a decrease in the systolic blood pressure for all four subjects. The self evaluated stress levels varied but all subjects reported drowsiness. Two subjects were tested using both sequences and their results were consistent: both systolic blood pressures were significantly higher during the hyper sequence. <br><br>Some of the 'relaxed' results seem to mimic the 'hyper' ones. This may be due to the key difference between the two sequences: the gamma frequencies which are known for their connection to the hypothalamus and adrenaline levels. The human body may be responding to the overall brain machine experience in the same way for both sequences but the subjects feel tired after the relaxed sequence because the brain, not having been entrained in the gamma frequencies, did not trigger the release of adrenaline. <br><br>Based on this data, the Brain Machine did yield changes in the subjects' mental and physical state.

THE BIGGEST BANG: A HYBRID ROCKET MOTOR FUEL EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS
Jonathan Anthony Walker
Berkmar High School , Lilburn , Georgia, United States of America

In recent years, hybrid rockets have become very attractive solutions to many rocket based problems, not only for its use in military applications but also as a cheaper, safer, alternative to Ammonium Perchlorate fueled rockets. Since Hybrid Rockets have the ability to use a wide array of different materials as fuels. There is much debate on which fuels are the most efficient.<br><br>This experiment was designed to determine which of the four most commonly used fuels for hybrid rockets yields the greatest specific impulse.<br><br>In order to ensure that the homebuilt hybrid rockets motors would provide viable results, the experiment was separated into two parts. During the first part of this experiment, it was necessary to determine the actual dimensions that would work the best for this experiment. On the basis of the most fuel burned in a paraffin wax design, a hybrid rocket motor with 2.54 cm outer shell and 1.47 cm fuel port was decided would be the best platform for the experiment. The four fuels used to determine greatest efficiency were paraffin wax, animal lard, sugar, and PVC. Twelve different hybrid motors were constructed and strapped to a deflection-test system that was used to measure thrust.<br><br>The data from the experiment shows that the sugar-fueled motor had the highest impulse and highest specific impulse. From the results of the experiment, it was concluded that out of the four different types of fuels tested, sugar was the most efficient rocket fuel.

COMPARISON OF CHARCOAL PRODUCED FROM THE INVASIVE PUERARIA MONTANA VAR. LOBATA (KUDZU), RED OAK, HICKORY, AND A COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE CHARCOAL
James Edward Whitfield LeCroy
Jefferson County International Baccalaureate School, Birmingham, AL

Pueraria Montana var. lobata (Kudzu) is a nuisance plant infesting the Southeastern United States. Attempts have been made to either harness this weed for positive purposes or completely eradicate it. Charcoal is a renewable resource with many uses. Utilizing kudzu to make charcoal might help reduce its environmental damage. In this study charcoal was produced from hickory, oak and kudzu. Fifteen samples of each homemade charcoal as well as a commercially produced hardwood charcoal (control) were burned in a homemade calorimeter to analyze their performance. There was no significant difference in kudzu’s performance and that of hickory or oak in peak temperature or burn times. Kudzu produced less energy than both control and hickory; however, the energy production of kudzu and oak charcoals were statistically similar. These calculations project that the possible energy production for the control charcoal is 29MJ/kg, followed by hickory with 26MJ/kg, oak with 25MJ/kg, and kudzu with 23MJ/kg. Kudzu charcoal appeared to produce an average of 80% of the calories per gram produced by the commercial charcoal. Statistically and subjectively, kudzu burned more completely than control, hickory or oak. Kudzu had an average of 13% mass remaining after burning while the control had 31%, Hickory had 30%, and Oak had 33%. These results suggest that kudzu produces less energy than the control or hickory and possibly a similar amount of energy as oak, and burns more completely than all other charcoals, with less waste.

ENGINEERING AND FASHION: THEY CAN WORK TOGETHER
Jeanie E Janas
New Prairie High School New Carlisle, IN USA

I have had two major ankle surgeries. My doctor told me not to wear high heel shoes because they excessively stress my ankle. I used Engineering to understand what I can do to keep my ankle stress reasonable while wearing high heels shoes. <br><br>I chose an L18 orthogonal array to understand the contribution of variables of 6 different shoes, 3 different accessories (nothing, backpack, and shoulder bag), 3 different surfaces (cement, carpet, wood), 3 different length of steps (short, normal, long), and 3 different walking speeds (fast, normal, and slow).<br><br>I tested 13 students (twice) to determine the length of short, normal, and long steps. I had to correct the length of leg adjustment to this length (I am only 5 feet tall). I used the same students to determine the actual speed of fast, normal, and slow walking.<br><br> I secured two accelerometers to my ankle by using hose clamps. Since F=ma, the acceleration is an indication of the stress of my ankle. <br><br>I tested and analyzed over 600 steps per the orthogonal array procedure, and control charts were developed to understand the contribution of the variables to my overall ankle acceleration.<br><br>I was surprised about the difference between my upper and lower ankle acceleration, so I developed a free body diagram to better understand.<br><br>My analysis for the upper ankle was a simple statistic using the range from minimum to maximum values. The time histories of the steps indicated this analysis to be appropriate.<br><br>Jeanie Janas<br><br>

LOW COST NANOWIRE-BASED GAS SENSOR TEST PLATFORM FOR MILITARY & CIVILIAN APPLICATIONS
Trevor Elliot Powers
Christian Academy of Louisville, Louisville, Ky. 40299

The primary focus of this project was to develop a gas detector research platform. This test platform was used to conduct experiments on Nanowires to ascertain how they react with various gases. This reaction causes the Nanowires’ electrical resistance to change. A thin film of Nanowires on quartz was analyzed by measuring its electrical resistance during a battery of experiments. Nanowire-coated substrates were produced in a hot wall filament reactor that was designed and built by the student. Temperature changes the rate that gas reacts with Nanowires. Increasing temperature speeds up the reaction process. Knowing how much the resistance changes will allow a program to be written that will recognize any gas previously detected. To optimize the sensor, the platform was built with the capability to reach a wide range of temperatures (100 to 500C) because gases react differently at various temperatures. Good temperature control was required to yield useable data during experiments. This research platform is capable of measuring electrical signals through three types of Nanowires. Currently, the system is configured to handle six of twelve possible signals.<br><br>Because of the high surface area of Nanowires, these detectors should respond more quickly and with more sensitivity than current thin film detectors.<br><br>The long term goal is to develop Nanowire-based sensors that would operate as a lab on a chip. These devices would be deployed in areas too harsh or impractical for current gas detection equipment.<br><br>

BIOMECHANICALLY ASSISTING THE STS MOVEMENT
Spencer R Wilson
Colquitt County High School, Moultrie, GA

Many people have trouble moving from a sitting to a standing position including pregnant woman, physically disabled, and most of all, the elderly. The purpose of this project is to engineer a portable device to assist these challenged individuals using an analysis of the sit-to-stand movement, ergonomics, and anthropometry. The engineer developed several engineering goals for the project: effective lifting capacity, comfort, ease of operation, portability, and lightweight. In order to achieve these goals, the project was divided into three parts: research and design, construction, and evaluation. After research, a pneumatic, dual-pivot point, supplementary seat was designed. The fourth and final prototype, constructed from aluminum, and quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated. The compressor is powered by a 12 volt rechargeable battery adapted from a cordless drill. The compressor, battery, and bladder were all inclusive in the seat. The seat was tested for the amount of torque generated at five different angles for each part of the seat. The amount of torque generated by the seat decreases as the angle of each part increases, showing that the seat sufficiently shifts the weight of the user forward through the STS movement. The angular velocity of the seat was also calculated. At >1 degree/sec, the seat successfully provides a smooth movement tailored to the focus consumer. The x-intercept of a linear-square regression line was used to find the theoretical weight limit for Prototype 4. Angular velocity was also evaluated using controlled weights to decrease testing variables. Above 30kg, velocity began to increase (against the trend), coinciding with the torque analysis; the device uses the downward force to propel the mass forward. The main engineering goals were achieved; a device was designed and constructed which is comfortable, portable, and provides successful assistance in the STS movement.

Magnetic storage devices are becoming necessarily larger in storage capacity to maintain the amounts of data being generated. For this to continue at the rate at which it is currently increasing, a material that allows huge capacities of data storage must be found. Iron Platinum [FePt] is potentially the material of choice and may be the future in magnetic recording.<br><br> Synthesized FePt forms into a face-centered-cubic (FCC) crystal structure with the iron and platinum atoms randomly distributed over the crystal structure. Heating is required to transform the arrangement of Fe and Pt atoms on the FCC structure to an ordered structure called L10 having alternating planes of iron and platinum atoms along the z-axis. L10 has the correct magnetic properties for magnetic storage.<br><br> Processing FePt requires a well-equipped chemical laboratory. Procedural steps were taken to preserve proper mixtures, remove waste material, and dry the remaining particles. In preparation for spin-coating, the dried nanoparticles are dispersed in octane solutions and applied to silicon wafers. An X-Ray Diffractometer was used to conduct X-ray reflectivity scans to determine thickness of nanoparticles on the silicon wafer. Samples were heated in a tube furnace for varying time periods. The heated samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction to determine particle size and phase transformation.<br><br> These tests were conducted to determine if FePt transformed into L10 acquiring the correct properties for magnetic storage. Particle size increased 400% indicating sintering (clumping together). Complete transformation to L10 did not occurred because particle spacing was not comparable to previous experiments. <br><br>

POWER UP AN EXPERIMENT IN PERPETUAL ENERGY
Daniel Mark Ellsworth
Buena High School, Sierra Vista, AZ, USA

This project was an attempt to create a low cost device that would produce perpetual energy. Perpetual, or never ending, energy is said to be an impossible and intangible theory. However, something is only said to be impossible because it has never been done before. If this device succeeded in creating perpetual energy, it would revolutionize the world, and exploration to other planets would be much more efficient and cost effective.<br><br> A Closed Circuit Air Flow Energy Device, (CCAFED) is a device that in a closed environment uses fans to move air which turns a turbine. The turbine turns the crank shaft of a generator and in theory creates sufficient energy to power the fans. This device was created using a vacuum bell jar to create the enclosed environment, a computer fan to move the air, a modified paint mixer for the turbine, and a hand held generator to create the electrical output.<br><br> This device was constructed and modified several times during the course of this experiment. All four phases and their various modifications failed to produce sufficient usable power. These results show that the theory of a CCAFED being used to create perpetual energy has been disproved. The theory that perpetual energy can be obtained still stands, for the time being, unproven. <br><br>

MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING: AN ANALYSIS OF THE CREATION OF SUBCRITICAL SILICA AEROGEL AND ITS PROPERTIES
Justin To
Oak Grove High School, San Jose, CA

Objectives:<br><br> To create aerogel under subcritical conditions. <br><br>Hypothesis:<br><br> If aerogel is created under subcritical conditions, then it will have similar properties (density, appearance, strength) to aerogel created under normal (critical) conditions.<br><br>Method/Materials:<br><br> In the first stage of a three-part process, tetraethyl orthosilicate is combined with methanol, water, and an acid; afterwards, it is sealed and put into a drying oven. In the second stage, an additional mixture of isopropyl alcohol and a base is added, and the mixtures remain in the oven. In the final stage, the mixture is unsealed and is allowed to dry. By experimenting with the time each stage spends in the oven, I can optimize the final result. A basic water displacement experiment was done to determine each sample's density, and I used a dual-pressure sensor to determine how much force it took to crush each sample. <br><br>Results: <br><br> The various samples that I created were not very similar to aerogel in terms of properties, and so I doubt they can be classified as aerogels. Although some of the samples looked identical to aerogel, they lacked aerogel's characteristic low density,optical traits, and mechanical strength. <br><br>Conclusion:<br><br> As I am inconclusive as to whether I have created aerogel or not, I can not properly compare the properties of that of my samples to those of normal aerogel. I am still conducting research into refining my methods and possible new methods in creating subcritical aerogel at this time.

In phase two, an advanced design based on the concept of an expanding gear was developed and modeled. <br><br> The new design consists of two gears connected by a belt drive. The gears are aligned adjacent to each other and as one gear expands, the other contracts at the same rate, therefore allowing the machine to use a fixed length belt while continuously changing the ratio between the two gears. This goal is accomplished by creating a mechanical system using a pivoting lever that moves to compress and extend the arms of each gear. For testing, a model gear system using available materials was constructed then placed in a frame and powered by a variable speed motor with suitable controls. <br><br> The relationship between the driven gear and the driver gear was observed, and speed, RPMs, and theoretical rate of fuel consumption were recorded. The experiment showed that the new design is potentially more fuel efficient, creates a smoother acceleration, and accomplishes the same goal as the modern transmission. This design has potential for multiple uses and future development. <br><br>

SUSTAINABLE INSULATION & CONSERVATION: KEEPING HEAT IN & SOUND OUT
Raphael James Burne
Maharishi School of the Age of Enlightenment, Fairfield, IA

Due in part to a growing population, the US is getting louder and that has been shown to cause stress and decreased productivity. Increasing stress levels further are the ever-rising costs of heating homes. Last year household energy usage totaled 1,140 billion kWh, of which, one-third was used for heating and cooling. If the energy efficiency of buildings can be improved we can shrink heating bills and reduce the consumption of fossil fuels, helping us become more carbon neutral, and as an added benefit reduce the penetration of environmental noise resulting in a quieter environment inside the building. <br><br>In this project, eco-friendly materials were examined for their effectiveness as insulators against sound and heat loss. Mixtures of cellulose and recycled vulcanized crumb-rubber were compared, within a model room system, to traditional fiberglass insulation for their ability to insulate against noise and retain heat. A sound meter was used to determine the sound dampening aspect of the materials while heat retention was determined by heating the room and identifying the steady-state temperature. The mixture of cellulose and rubber proved an excellent heat insulator ranking second across all the treatments while being the most effective at dampening sound. Fiberglass had slightly lower thermal conductivity to the mixture; however was not a good sound dampener. The negatives associated with fiberglass make it difficult to handle while the cellulose/rubber mixture proved to be a sustainable option for insulating buildings that will lower energy bills, reduce scrap tire waste, is inexpensive and easy to install.

This goal is accomplished by creating a mechanical system using a pivoting lever that moves to compress and extend the arms of each gear. For testing, a model gear system using available materials was constructed then placed in a frame and powered by a variable speed motor with suitable controls. <br><br> The relationship between the driven gear and the driver gear was observed, and speed, RPMs, and theoretical rate of fuel consumption were recorded. The experiment showed that the new design is potentially more fuel efficient, creates a smoother acceleration, and accomplishes the same goal as the modern transmission. This design has potential for multiple uses and future development. <br><br>

SUSTAINABLE INSULATION & CONSERVATION: KEEPING HEAT IN & SOUND OUT
Raphael James Burne
Maharishi School of the Age of Enlightenment, Fairfield, IA

Due in part to a growing population, the US is getting louder and that has been shown to cause stress and decreased productivity. Increasing stress levels further are the ever-rising costs of heating homes. Last year household energy usage totaled 1,140 billion kWh, of which, one-third was used for heating and cooling. If the energy efficiency of buildings can be improved we can shrink heating bills and reduce the consumption of fossil fuels, helping us become more carbon neutral, and as an added benefit reduce the penetration of environmental noise resulting in a quieter environment inside the building. <br><br>In this project, eco-friendly materials were examined for their effectiveness as insulators against sound and heat loss. Mixtures of cellulose and recycled vulcanized crumb-rubber were compared, within a model room system, to traditional fiberglass insulation for their ability to insulate against noise and retain heat. A sound meter was used to determine the sound dampening aspect of the materials while heat retention was determined by heating the room and identifying the steady-state temperature. The mixture of cellulose and rubber proved an excellent heat insulator ranking second across all the treatments while being the most effective at dampening sound. Fiberglass had slightly lower thermal conductivity to the mixture; however was not a good sound dampener. The negatives associated with fiberglass make it difficult to handle while the cellulose/rubber mixture proved to be a sustainable option for insulating buildings that will lower energy bills, reduce scrap tire waste, is inexpensive and easy to install.

WHAT EFFECT DOES A ROOF'S ANGLE HAVE ON THAT ROOF'S RESISTANCE TO A TORNADO?
Michelle Anchors, Herschel V. Jenkins High School
Savannah, Georgia, United States

The purpose of my experiment is to determine which angle roof is the most tornado resistant. To find this out, I built a tornado generator box out of two plywood bases and four Plexiglas side panels. I placed a Styrofoam cube in the bottom of the box and set roofs of different angles on top of the cube, or house. Then I used a vacuum cleaner to pull air up the box in a vortex. I used a stopwatch to time how long it took for the roofs to be completely removed from the house. The average time taken to remove the 180-degree roof from the house was 4.53 seconds. The average time taken to remove the 120-degree roof from the house was 5.63 seconds. The average time taken to remove the 85-degree roof from the house was 5.88 seconds. From these results, I could conclude that there is an indirect relationship between the angle of a roof and its resistance to a tornado. In other words, as the angle of the roof decreases, the time taken to remove the roof from a house increases, or the resistance increases.

THE EFFECT OF HELIUM ION IRRADIATION ON THE TUNNELING BEHAVIOR IN ALUMINUM/ALUMINUM OXIDE/LEAD JUNCTIONS
Rahul Mitra
Corona Del Sol, Tempe, AZ

This research studied electron tunneling, a quantum mechanical phenomenon, in tri-layer aluminum/aluminum oxide/lead junctions where aluminum is a non-superconducting metal, aluminum oxide is a thin insulating barrier through which electrons tunnel, and lead is a superconducting metal. A superconductor is a material that conducts electricity with zero electrical resistance below a low temperature known as the superconducting transition temperature (Tc). In this research, structural point defects were added into the aluminum oxide insulating barrier of the junction, and the resulting changes in tunneling behavior were determined. Each junction was manufactured on a sapphire substrate using thermal evaporation. Then it was dipped into liquid helium to achieve temperatures below the Tc of lead (7.19K) and current-voltage electrical measurements were taken. If tunneling was observed, point defects were added into the barrier by irradiating the junction with 3MeV helium ions using a Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometer. This process was incrementally repeated until tunneling was no longer observed. The results showed that after 1 million counts of helium ion irradiation, there was no change in tunneling behavior. After 4 million counts, the conductance of the junction increased by over 10 times, there was a small change in the tunneling behavior, and the barrier height and thickness of the junction decreased. Finally, by 7 million counts, the conductance increased by over 2000 times but the tunneling behavior was drastically degraded. This research established a breakthrough process to trim a junction's barrier to a specified parameter without adversely affecting its tunneling behavior, which is invaluable for the next generation devices in which such junctions are used.

THE EFFECT OF GOLD ON THE SUPERCONDUCTING TRANSITION TEMPERATURE OF LEAD
Rahul Mitra
Corona Del Sol High School, Tempe, AZ

A superconductor is a material which begins conducting electricity with zero electrical resistance at an extremely low temperature known as the superconducting transition temperature (Tc). This research evaluated the effect of gold, a non-superconductor, on the Tc of lead. The objective was to prevent lead from atmospheric degradation by capping it with a layer of gold in such a way that the gold would not decrease the Tc of lead from 7.19K. It was hypothesized that small fractions of gold mixed with lead would decrease the Tc of lead, whereas large fractions of gold would make lead non-superconductive. Equal amounts of lead were simultaneously deposited onto several sapphire substrates in a Denton Vacuum DV-502A. Varying amounts of gold were then deposited onto each lead sample. A Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometer was used to determine the thicknesses of lead and gold of each sample. Annealing was performed on each sample for 90 minutes at 200°C to uniformly mix the lead and gold. Finally, electrical measurements for superconductivity were performed by dipping each sample into liquid helium down to 2K. It was found that samples with 81.35% and 61.94% atoms of gold were not superconductive. At 7.05% atoms of gold, the Tc of lead decreased to 6.72K. Finally, samples with 0.35%, 2.51%, and 4.19% atoms of gold had absolutely no decrease in the Tc of lead. In conclusion, this project established that gold can be used as a capping layer for lead provided it is 4% or less at the lead-gold interface.

THE EFFECT OF WING SWEEP ON AIRFOIL STALLS, PHASE II
Gregory Donald Howe
Savannah Country Day School, Savannah, Georgia

Research was done on Aerodynamics and, more specifically, what happens when an airfoil stalls. The original experiment was designed to determine how the sweep of a wing affects how it stalls. A wind tunnel and wings of varying sweeps were constructed and tested. After these tests, it was determined that the data was inaccurate and unreliable. Modifications to the wind tunnel and new data collection methods used this year go great lengths towards correcting these inaccuracies. Statistical tests performed on this year's data and last year's data prove that the new methods are indeed sounder than those used previously. If accurate testing procedures can be devised and used to test the original problem, aircraft safety and performance could potentially be increased.

LOW-COST POLARIZATION BASED GFP VIEWER
Harikrishna Rallapalli
Amador Valley High School, Pleasanton, CA

A novel application of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) Polarization Anisotropy as a marker for cancer stem cell lineage analysis is proposed. The main advantage is GFP signal intensity remains constant across generations as the GFP gene can be incorporated into the genome. This avoids critical problems with conventional fluorophores such as genotoxicity and exponential decay in signal intensity across successive generations. However, two major issues are raised: 1) Thousands of GFP variants are required to trace the large number of descendants across generations of a single stem cell whereas only around 100 color and intensity variants exist; 2) Noise due to background autofluorescence reduces the GFP signal. Exploiting the striking polarization anisotropy of GFP helps solve both problems.<br><br> <br><br>A compact, portable, simple GFP microscope designed for efficient measurement of the polarization anisotropy of pure GFP protein and GFP laden samples is presented. It builds upon low-cost GFP viewer and TIRF microscope designs to reduce cost by 95% compared with typical epifluorescence microscopes. The microscope successfully detected 400% higher polarization anisotropy of GFP laden E. coli samples compared with fluorescein, using only emission polarization filters. Using this viewer, GFP variants with modified molecular volumes engineered to have different rotational relaxation times resulting in up to 30x differences in polarization anisotropy can be quickly validated in vitro and in situ. The viewer design also enables other applications such as: determining genotoxicity of chemicals; identifying genetically modified organisms in the field; and intra-vital imaging.

DUSTY PROBLEM MISTY SOLUTION: THE DESIGN AND TESTING OF A PM-10 (PARTICULATE MATTER) SUPPRESSANT
James John Robillard
Clovis West High School, Fresno California, United States of America

The project’s purpose tested a new way to suppress anthropogenic atmospheric PM-10 with water. The initial idea was conceived while observing a tractor and disk emitting dust. PM-10 triggers asthma attacks, weakens crops, and contributes to Valley Fever. PM-10 is a main component of air pollution, and has been implicated as one factor in air-quality related deaths. In the experiment, PM-10 was introduced, in the form of baby powder, 5.08 cm above the base of a self designed 61 cm cylinder. On the contra lateral of the cylinder, water was sprayed from five different heights. PM-10 and the water were simultaneously introduced, spraying for three seconds. The PM-10 was allowed to settle for ten seconds. At the base of the cylinder, pre-massed filter-paper was used to collect the PM-10 and water that returned to the ground. The water was allowed to evaporate for 24 hours. Once dried, the amount of PM-10 collected was re-weighed. The most effective heights for PM-10 abatement were 19.05 and 29.21 centimeters. At these heights the spray device was 26.7% most effective in reducing PM-10 pollution. Results here suggest an onboard device where a proximal delivery of water may significantly reduce the amount of PM-10 being emitted by farm equipment. When this measured 26.7% reduction is applied to data provided by the California Air Resources Board, PM-10 could safely fall within national and state standards. A device with the advantage of onboard proximal water delivery could reduce health problems with improved air quality and visibility.

PLASMON RESONANCE OF GOLD-COATED NANOSHELLS
Hadas Friedman
Lincoln Park High School, Chicago, IL, USA

Nanoshells have potential use for various medical applications, such as eradicating tumors in the fight against cancer, or binding wounds without stitches. The nanoshells have optical resonant properties as a result of their particularly useful geometry - a dielectric core and a metal shell - that allow them to be tuned to any wavelength from the visible to the infrared spectrum. When the nanoshells are injected into the body, it is important to know the components of the medium they are entering because the local environment will affect the peak plasmon resonance. This experiment determines the effects of water and bovine serum albumin on the peak plasmon resonance of fabricated gold-coated nanoshells. <br><br> Dry gold-coated nanoshells with a silica core were immobilized on a glass slide and compared to wet nanoshells in water, and to wet nanoshells with the protein bovine serum albumin (BSA). The peak positions of the surface plasmon resonances were measured and compared using a spectrometer.<br><br> The immersion of the nanoshells in water caused a shift of 28 nm toward the infrared spectrum. The addition of the protein BSA caused an additional shift of 2 nm. The hypothesis that the immersion of nanoshells in water would cause a shift was correct. However, it was thought that the BSA would induce a larger shift than the water but this was not substantiated. <br><br>

DESIGNING AN INNOVATIVE MICROPUMP
Craig John Wright
Woodlin High School, Woodrow, Colorado, USA

The area of microfluidics is a rapidly growing field with lab-on-a-chip devices having the potential to replace 50-75% of the analytical chemistry that is done today. Fluid pumping is essential to this growing field. Therefore, the purpose of the research was to explore new and innovative micropump designs. The specific design goals were targeted towards a nanobiosensor application. Many different designs were investigated including ones that used ferrofluid, wankle rotary motion, and piston actuation. The successful prototype utilized the piston configuration. Four cylinders in a row with iron pistons in them would move up and down in sequence displacing fluid out of the pump in a continuous cycle. The micropump was machined out of acrylic plastic with pistons made of iron wire. Expected pumping performance was realized. The information from the successful completion of the prototype, and from other research investigated through the course of the project will be useful in the development of the next generation micropump. Several evolutions of the current prototype are outlined involving designs using photolithographic etching, soft photolithographic molding, and precision manufacturing.

THE SOLAR STEAMER: A SOLAR THERMAL ROCKET POWERED BY A FRESNEL CONCENTRATOR AND H20 PROPELLANT
Nathan Michael Tinker
Covenant Christian Academy, Huntsville, AL, USA

The purpose of this project was to discover if a solar concentrator and H2O propellant could be used to produce significant rocket thrust. Previous researchers have investigated solar steam rockets, but tests have not been performed on rocket configurations combining a Fresnel concentrator and H2O propellant. <br><br> A propane tank was modified to act as a rocket engine, then filled with H2O and mounted to a Fresnel concentrator assembly. The sun was tracked and focused onto the rocket engine to heat the propellant by rotating the assembly. The tank was also wrapped with insulation and a secondary concentrator (reflector) was attached to the Fresnel concentrator assembly to increase the temperature and pressure in the tank. A nozzle was fabricated and attached to the tank to increase the thrust. The temperature and pressure measurements were taken as a function as time. Once the maximum obtainable pressure inside the tank was reached, the tank was placed on a digital scale and the steam was released to measure the thrust.<br><br> After the experiments were completed and the results were considered, it was concluded that the trials with the insulation and insulation/secondary concentrator performed the best. The experiment with no insulation performed poorly. Also it was proven that nozzle increased the thrust by the following results: for the experiment without a diverging nozzle the pressure was 384.6 kPa while the thrust measured 340.2 g. For the experiment with a diverging nozzle the pressure was 384.6 kPa while the thrust measured 680.4 g.<br><br>

MICRO BLOWING TECHNIQUE
Kenneth Lee Eunice
Colquitt County High School, Moultrie, Georgia, USA

For several years scientists all over the world have been trying to reduce the skin friction across the surface of a wing. Less friction means less drag and less drag means greater fuel efficiency. Airplanes will be to fly further on less fuel. Many techniques have been experimented with but none succeeded in significantly reducing the friction across the skin of a wing in a flight enviroment.<br><br>The technique that the researcher is experimenting with is called the micro blowing technique or MBT. This skin friction reduction technique is done by a small amount of air flowing vertically through the skin of a wing through extremely small holes. This concept is the same a modern day air hockey table, it dramatically reduces the friction of the surface thus allowing the puck to glide across the tables' surface almost frictionless. The experimenter hypothesizes that the technique of micro blowing can be applied to the top skin of a wing and greatly reduce the friction across the surface.

THE PAIN FREE SOCKET 2.0: ELIMINATING PHANTOM PAIN IN AMPUTEES USING THERMAL BIOFEEDBACK INCORPORATED INTO PROSTHETICS
Katherine Emily Bomkamp
North Point High School for Science, Technology and Industry, Waldorf, MD

Phantom limb pain, pain in a person’s nonexistent limb, plague an estimated eighty percent of the world’s ten million amputees. Phantom pains are thought to be caused by the brain still sending signals and commands down to an amputated limb which no longer exists. Currently, no completely effective medications or holistic methods exist for the treatment of phantom pains. Twenty-five feet of embedded thermo-resistive wiring (much improved from the heated socket used in last year’s project) is connected to a lithium ion battery pack inside of a below the knee prosthetic socket, allowing for concentrated and controlled heat to stimulate severed nerve endings in the residual limb, effectively stopping the brains signals down to the amputated limb. Updated and advanced electronics are featured, including wireless communication and the addition of a microprocessor. Both microprocessors are used for wireless communication purposes. One microprocessor board works together with the slide potentiometer and transmitter IC. The second microprocessor is responsible for receiver wireless data regarding temperature correction inside the socket. If the receiver voltage is less than the transmitter voltage, a relay is turned on in the socket and the resistive wiring beings to heat the socket internally. If the transmitter signal temperature is higher, the relay is shut off and the socket will cool down again. An additional microprocessor monitors and compares the temperature set by the transmitter, to the actual temperature inside of the socket, allowing for visual confirmation of the effectiveness and accuracy of the wireless communications.

THROUGH THE FIRE AND THE FLAMES THE EFFECT OF SELECTED FLAME-RETARDANTS ON SPECIFIC FABRICS
James Edward Whitfield LeCroy
Jefferson County International Baccalaureate School, Birmingham, AL, USA

Fire is a major source of death, injury, and property loss. Flame-retardants offer some protection from these hazards by potentially prolonging escape time. This experiment compared the effectiveness of a Homemade Borax Solution, commercially available Flame Stop I-C and commercially available 3% F-500 in reducing the flammability of cotton, wool, and silk. Three groups containing ten samples of 100% cotton, 100% silk, and 100% wool were treated with the above-mentioned flame-retardants. A control group contained ten samples of untreated cotton, silk, and wool. Each group was exposed to flame. Burn times (time to ignition, time to extinguishment, total burn time) as well as residual mass and surface areas were recorded. It was hypothesized that, samples of cotton, wool, and silk treated with commercially available flame retardants 3% F-500 and Flame Stop I-C would be less consumed by flame than untreated fabric samples and samples treated with the Homemade Borax Solution. The 3% F-500 test results did not support the hypothesis because this solution did not preserve fabric mass or surface area. Flame Stop I-C data did support the hypothesis because it preserved fabric mass and surface area. Flame Stop I-C also shortened burn time of each sample type. The Homemade Borax Solution data did not support the hypothesis because it did, in fact, result in more preservation of mass and surface area of wool and cotton than control samples and those treated with 3% F-500.

HOME FLOODS, A DEVICE TO STOP THEM. A SYSTEM FOR PREVENTING FLOODS AND LEAKS IN HOMES
Christopher Michael Jenkins
South River High School, Edgewater, Maryland, USA

The main purpose of this project was to build a device that can prevent floods and leaks from occurring in your home. The device was set up with a water flow sensor that is connected to the water supply line. If the sensor detects water flow, then a signal is sent to a timer. The timer starts counting down from a preset time. Voltage to the water supply pump is controlled by the timer. When water is flowing, the timer is counting down from a set time (the timer can be set to any amount of time). If the preset time elapses, then the timer shuts off the water supply pump, and stops the water leak. My hypothesis was that I could build a device using a timer and water flow sensor to shut off the flow of water in a house, and that faster flow rates would cause the timer to turn off faster. I first tested the water flow rates in sinks and toilets on 3 different floors in my house, and determined what the minimum flow rate was necessary to activate the flow sensor and timer. I then constructed a prototype water flow sensor-timer in a small-scale house, and tested whether the device could turn off water flowing through the miniature house. <br><br>I concluded that the water flow sensor-timer system could be used in a house. This device would be useful to prevent major flooding of a house when the homeowners are away on vacation.<br><br>

MAXIMIZING POWER DENSITY IN DIRECT METHANOL FUEL CELLS: THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL MULTIPLE FUEL CELL DESIGN
Douglas George Lavanture, John Adams High School
South Bend, IN USA

Because of the dwindling supply of fossil fuels, scientists now seek an alternative power source that is clean, safe, reliable, and efficient. The most plausible answer today for mainly automotive applications is the direct-methanol fuel cell (DMFC). The DMFC is more reliable economically than a hydrogen fuel cell. The cost to make methanol available conveniently at one-in-ten energy stations nationwide is only about $600 million. A similar hydrogen infrastructure would exceed $1 trillion.<br><br> The purpose of this continuation was to study mass transfer impediments that occur internally and externally from the fuel cell. It was hypothesized that the formation of intermediaries at the anode surface and the formation of a water film at the cathode surface caused mass transfer impediments. A wind tunnel was used to rush ambient air at varying velocities over the cathode surfaces of the fuel cells to test for voltage and power responses. <br><br> Tests to discover the power output response as cells were connected in series were also performed. It was hypothesized that the power densities in the cells would increase as more cells were correspondingly connected in series. <br><br> Finally, construction of a novel design and arrangement of the fuel cells was tested. This arrangement would be most suitable for automotive applications and was thus subjected to wind tunnel tests. It was hypothesized that larger wind velocities would yield larger power densities in all wind tunnel series.<br><br> All trials were conducted repetitively so that statistical tests could be performed. Results and data thus far suggest corrolation with the presented hypotheses.

THE BOOMERANG DRILL DEVELOPMENT OF DRILLING A 180º CURVED HOLE
Benjamin Thomas Unsworth
Kingswood Academy, Sulphur, LA, USA

Many applications would benefit from the ability to drill a hole that started and ended on the same surface, to drill a hole in a curve of 180º.<br><br> Such a hole would provide greater strength than a standard screw or nail. It could also greatly speed up processes requiring such strength but only have access to one surface.<br><br> The purpose of this project is to create a drill that bores a 180º curved hole.<br><br> There are four major elements: the drive shaft, the guidance shaft, the frame, and the drill bit. The drive shaft is a flexible wire rope. It can be bent and still retain the ability to revolve the drill bit. The guidance shaft is composed of a stainless steel tube, a spring and a brass bushing. The tube is bent 90º to a 1” radius to force the drill bit to cut in a curve. The spring is soldered to the tube to push the tube in unison with the drill bit. Once the tubing is completely inside the material, the spring contours to the hole’s shape and thus continues applying constant pressure on the tubing. The bushing is attached to the tube to reduce resistance and chatter with the drill bit. The stainless steel tube frame is bent twice 90º to form an “S” shape. The first curve guides the drill’s direction. The second curve allows pressure to be applied to the guidance shaft vertically. In preliminary tests, the drill was successful in low density materials.<br><br>

REDESIGNING MOLOKAI'S LIFELINE
Ayla Rose-Lyn Bicoy
Molokai High School, Ho'olehua, HI

An experiment was done to find a better design for the Kaunakakai Wharf causeway. The main objective was to find a design that would be more environmentally friendly by improving sediment circulation yet also be economical and realistic. It was hypothesized that a design supported entirely by pillars would be the most conducive to long-shore sediment flow, but would be the most expensive. A design with an opening slanted out to sea was hypothesized to be the best balance between efficiency and economy.<br><br> To test the hypothesis, 5 different models were placed in a water-flow box. Fine grain sediment taken from the wharf beach was spread in front of the water gate. As the water flowed towards the model it took the sand with it. The amount of sand left on the current side of the causeway was scraped up and measured with a gram scale. Pictures were also taken during the flow of water.<br><br> It was found that the Full Post design allowed for the most sediment flow, but, because implementation of the design would require an entire revamp of the current road, it was also the most expensive. The Slanted Opening was the least efficient design because the sharp angle made by the opening caused disruption to the streamlines and constricted the opening. The Post Opening design proved to be the best balance between efficiency and economy; it provided the largest area of flow for the smallest price.

MODIFYING FACTORS IN THE PROTON EXCHANGE MEMBRANE OF THE DIRECT METHANOL FUEL CELL, INCLUDING THE EVALUATION OF A CARBON NANOFOAM ELECTRODE, TO MAXIMIZE POWER DENSITIES
Jordan Andrew Hurwich
John Adams High School; South Bend, Indiana; United States of America

In recent years, it has become evident that mankind needs a new energy source for the twenty-first century, and the most plausible answer to today's energy problems is the direct methanol fuel cell, DMFC.<br><br> The purpose of this investigation was to alter the DMFC in various ways to produce the greatest power outputs. The investigation focused on the proton exchange membrane, PEM. Platinum-loading, alteration of the flow field plates, Teflon-loading, and the use of a carbon nanofoam electrode was investigated.<br><br> In the platinum loading series, platinum was deposited using the Argon Sputter Process at 0.1 and 0.3 mg/cm^2, while a 0.2 mg/cm^2 deposition was provided by the manufacturer. It was hypothesized that the largest platinum loading would have the greatest power outputs. In the flow-field plate series, two fibers were investigated, a carbon material provided by the cell's manufacturers and an imported, less dense, carbon-like material that was retrofitted for the cell hypthesizing that the less dense material would produce greater power output. In the Teflon-loading series, Teflon was added to provide a hydrophobic layer to reduce carbon dioxide and formaldehyde poisoning. For the carbon nanofoam electrode series a carbon nanofoam electrode was compared to a standard stainless steel electrode.<br><br> From this investigation, it was concluded that greater platinum concentrations yield the greatest power densities, that porous flow-fields allow for greater power densities, that Teflon works well to decrease carbon dioxide and formaldehyde poisoning of the anode, that flow rate with teflon loading does not proportionally increase power output, and that a carbon nanofoam electrode is more effective than a steel electrode.

INDUCED EMF GENERATOR; THE CREATION OF A MAGNETIC INDUCTION REGENERATIVE ENERGY CAPTURE DEVICE
Richard Lee Shillington
Dr. Michael M. Krop Senior High School, Miami, Florida, USA

Today sources of electrical energy are becoming scarce. The idea behind this project is to create and test a prototype induction system, which is in close relation to traffic light trips, to determine its potential to actually become a new renewable source of energy. It was decided to construct a brand new induction device, which used a reverse polar system. This device was constructed of many parts including Neodymium magnets and over one thousand feet of copper wiring. After the device was made it was tested on the levels of induction using both AC and DC power. Once the initial testing was done the electro-motive force was taken into account, which is contained in the metallic mass of an automobile and decided that it was the perfect item to use to test the induction capabilities of the prototype device. The results of the experiment showed that both the AC and DC power would raise the level of inductance by using the electro motive force, but DC voltage was the more efficient of the two and actually increased the voltage by an average of 23%. This research has everyday applications such as automobiles, trains, airplanes, military vehicles and many other EMF producing objects. Currently this experiment is being applied to the creation of a new kind of battery called the “Human Kinetic Cell”, a current innovation developed at my high school, which purports to use induction to make an everlasting kinetic battery cell.<br><br>

MANIPULATING THE DIFFRACTION OF TRAFFIC NOISE
Douglas Charles Niemann
duPont Manual High School, Louisville, Kentucky, USA

The purpose of this experiment is to find how different top shapes affect the acoustical shadow of highway noise barriers. Many different top shapes were sketched up and brought to the mentor of the experiment. The properties of diffraction were discussed and the many shapes were narrowed down to eight different shapes. Using measurements from a past experiment and new AASHTO measurements, a standard highway noise barrier was scaled down for experimentation and constructed out of wood. These rough shapes were drawn up on AutoCAD, a drafting program, to find exact measurements for the wood to be cut to. Each design was put together using screws and metal brackets. The top shapes and the wall were then taken to an open field for testing. A receiver was placed in front of the wall and behind the wall. Each top shape was tested with the receiver behind the wall in four different positions to fully observe the acoustical shadow. Traffic noise was played over a computer speaker so that one foot in front of the wall the sound was at a constant level. The average sound level at both receivers was recorded after thirty seconds. The data was then taken to a computer and statistically analyzed. The t-test results concluded that the data was extremely significant. After finding the overall reduction in decibels, it can be determined that shape five, or the hybrid between the T-top and the Y-top, reduced the traffic noise the most in all but one test.

DETERMINATION OF EFFICIENT BLADE GEOMETRY FOR USE WITH MARINE CURRENT TURBINES
Nicholas David Araujo
Dr. Michael M. Krop Senior High School, Miami, Florida, United States

In an attempt to alleviate the high initial costs that have stalled development and implementation of marine current turbines (MCTs), a design that would improve rotational efficiency was investigated. Six simplified models—unshrouded axial flow turbines of which half had two blades and half had three blades—of constant blade surface area were created to examine the effects of fluid friction and torque on rotational efficiency. In each design category—two blade or three blade—the edge perimeter of one model was minimized to minimize negative effects of fluid friction. Two other designs for each category focused on 10% and 20% radial increases to maximize the positive torque effects. The models were evaluated in a wave tank under five current velocities. It was assumed that higher average RPMs indicated more efficient turbines. Logarithmic regressions indicate that two blade turbines produce more average RPMs than three blade turbines, and turbines whose edge perimeter was minimized produced more RPMs than turbines of increasing radius. Specifically, a 1% increase in total edge perimeter resulted in a 94.25% increase in RPM for the turbines tested. A one-way Analysis of Variance test confirms that the statistical difference between the determined RPM values is significant enough to be caused only by differing blade designs, not human error in blade construction. Thus, two blade turbines whose edge perimeter had been minimized were deemed most efficient. Such findings are relevant to a myriad of turbomechanical and hydropower applications including hydroelectric dams and wave energy conversion.

THE SECRET TO A SILICON-BASED SUPERMATERIAL: INCREASING THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF SILICA AEROGEL THROUGH SUBCRITICAL DRYING PROCESSES
Justin To
Oak Grove High School, San Jose, CA

Objective: <br><br>Silica aerogel is a remarkable material known for its low density and low thermal conductivity. Aerogels are created by a process of supercritical drying of wet gels to produce porous solids without shrinkage. Aerogel is also a viable form of efficient thermal insulation in homes to significantly reduce energy costs. However, the costs associated with supercritical drying prevent aerogel from being widely implemented. Thus, it is proposed that subcritical drying processes, such as freeze drying and ambient drying, be used as a more economically viable manner to create aerogel. <br><br>Method: <br><br>Liquid gels are first created through a series of reactions. The gels are then frozen and the solvent is removed by sublimation under high vacuum. Another batch of gels is silylated for ambient drying. The resulting gels are then compared to commercial aerogels created supercritically by means of density analysis and surface analysis using a scanning electron microscope. <br><br>Conclusion: <br><br>The initial runs of creating aerogels by sublimation were inconclusive. Due to uncontrolled freezing and rapid temperature fluctuations present in a high school lab, unwanted cracking and melting of the gels occurred prior to sublimation. The result was faulty aerogels. The samples that were not affected showed promise to be similar to that of conventional aerogel. Gels dried ambiently have similar properties as supercritical aerogel and are viable alternatives, as long as cracking is avoided. <br><br>Summary: <br><br>A study of alternate, subcritical drying processes is presented for producing aerogel, an extremely effective thermal insulator with potential for great energy savings.

A COMPUTER MODEL FOR OPTIMIZATION OF A NON-ISOTHERMAL CHLORINATION REACTOR
Raj Gautam Ranade
East Lyme High School, East Lyme, CT, USA

Allyl chloride is an important chemical intermediate used in the synthesis of barbiturates and anesthetics. High temperature vapor-phase chlorination of propylene to produce allyl chloride exhibits extremely poor selectivity and conversion. A Java 2 computer simulation model was developed and fully validated for the optimization of the chlorination reactor. The optimization variables include temperature of in-going reactant streams, adiabatic versus non-adiabatic operation, and the reactor coolant temperature. The model also assessed the effect of varying the limiting reactant concentration on reactor performance. The computer model simultaneously solves the coupled differential equations for the energy and mass balances using Euler’s numerical method. The model predicts the concentrations of desired product and by-product, conversion, temperature, and the reaction selectivity as a function of reactor position. A large set of reaction conditions was systematically evaluated to conduct a temperature-constrained optimization to minimize undesirable side reactions. This powerful model successfully identified the optimum reaction conditions to substantially improve the reaction selectivity and throughput of the reactor. This analysis demonstrated that a sevenfold increase in selectivity could be obtained by using optimum reactant and coolant temperatures. An additional 56% increase in reaction selectivity can also be obtained by selecting an optimum reactant ratio while simultaneously decreasing the reactor volume by 41%. Furthermore, the model provides an excellent insight into selection of an optimum reactor volume with respect to the target chlorine conversion. This comprehensive optimization exercise substantially improved the commercial and economic feasibility of the non-isothermal chlorination process for allyl chloride synthesis.

Additionally, this project incorporated a data-logging function for both airspeed and altitude to enable a post-flight assessment of the launch’s safety, efficiency, and normalcy.<br><br> The completed telemetry and data-logging unit was installed and tested in the glider and winch. Six winch launches were performed with the system operating. The winch operator stated that the system worked flawlessly throughout the launches and enabled him to accurately control airspeed. The glider pilot attested to the normalcy and efficiency of the launches. The airspeed never varied more than ±4 knots from the target airspeed, and three of the launches reached an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet above the ground, about 100-200 feet higher than average with the glider used.

NANOENGINEERING AEROGEL FOR INSULIN INSULATION
Alex Nathan Capecelatro
Brewster High School, Brewster NY, USA

The need for passive long-term insulin storage is crucial in guaranteeing the safety, well-being, and freedom of diabetics. Aerogels cross-linked with hexamethylene diisocyanate were investigated for the specific application of insulating insulin. Using a TMOS monomer, gels were formed through a hydrolysis polymerization reaction. A novel non-supercritical drying process was implemented using ambient drying techniques to cut costs, time, and size restrictions during the production of silica aerogels. Drying sol-gels at ambient pressures normally results in the formation of xerogels, which lose the porosity desired in aerogels. The cross-linking process, however, strengthens the gel significantly so as to allow for drying at ambient pressures. The aerogels were characterized through BET and BJH analysis, as well as TEM and SEM imaging. Thermal characteristics of prototype devices were measured with computer controlled thermocouple readings. The ambient dried aerogel showed traditional characteristics with a surface area of 765 m2/g, average pore size of 22nm, and 89.01% porosity after being produced without the need for an expensive supercritical extraction process. Aerogels dried through an ambient drying technique were indistinguishable from the aerogels dried through a supercritical extraction process. The aerogels showed good insulating characteristics and can be implemented into capsules designed for insulin storage among numerous other applications.

Leo High School, Leo, Indiana, United States

The purpose of the engineering in this project was to determine the feasibility of a web based system for real time recording of music that is mechanically actuated. For this project, I focused on a computer controlled mechanism for playing an electric guitar. Systems were needed for depressing each of the six strings onto each of four frets to create a reasonable range of sound for output. Electromagnetic solenoids accomplished this task, as well as the sounding and muting of the strings. Electrically, I created a circuit to individually control each solenoid based on binary output from the computer. A prototype of the whole system was then constructed.<br><br><br>Basic engineering principles were employed to design and perfect the guitar player. After the prototype, necessary modifications were constructed to ensure consistent sound quality output. The final machine is able to produce a sound of quality near that of a medium level human guitarist. However, should this design be manufactured in the future, the custom machinery used to make the guitar player would greatly improve the tone of the sound.<br><br><br>The focus of the project now turned to the web system, with which the user, such as a composer, could hypothetically use to record music remotely. Servers in one remote geographic location, each attached to one of the mechanisms I have designed, could attend to requests from all over the internet. Users could send data files with music to these servers and receive real time live recordings for use in their compositions.

USING GLASS AS A CATALYST FOR DIESEL PARTICULATE FILTERS
Chelsea A Arthur
New Prairie High School, New Carlisle, IN

The objective or purpose of this was to develop a low cost catalyst for use in diesel particulate filters. Alkali metals are known to be effective soot oxidation catalysts, and potassium is the most effective alkali metal. I worked to develop glass compositions with properties specifically tailored for a diesel particulate filter application. To start the experiment I measured out compositions containing different amounts of potassium. After putting the glasses in the furnace, they were milled to a powder of similar particle size. The soot and catalysts are mixed and then put in a TGA machine to perform combustion/oxidation tests. Using software, the data is analyzed and put into graphs. To test the stability of the glass, PH tests were performed. The glass was immersed in 100ml of water and stirred using a stirring rod and stir plate. The PH value changes were monitored using a PH meter. The PH changes are correlated with ion-exchange and show how stable glass is, depending on the rate that the PH changed. <br><br><br>The more potassium the glass contained, the higher the catalytic activity. The glasses containing high amounts of potassium were too unstable but did bring the oxidation temperature for the soot to the low desired temperature range. The glasses with lower amounts of potassium did not lower the oxidation temperature enough to be effective, but they were stable. The best glass catalyst for a diesel particulate filter would be an optimization of the K.5 glass and K.7 glass. Optimizing these glasses would be done for future research.

DOES A HOT MOTOR EQUAL HOT PERFORMANCE?
John Michael Simpson
Owensboro High School, Owensboro, KY 42303, USA

<br><br>The purpose of this project is to see whether temperature changes affect an electric motor’s performance. I took one small electric motor and operated it in three different tests called the “Hot” “Cold” and “Neutral” tests. Measuring the performance was done with a tachometer reading the revolutions per minute (rpms) of the propeller that the motor was spinning. The fewer the rpm’s fell, the better performance of the motor. For the experimentation, I placed the motor in an environment with a variable temperature. For the “Hot” test, I raised the temperature to about 130 degrees Fahrenheit with the aid of a hairdryer. With all wind factors taken into account, I started the motor at 1,950 rpms so that I have something to compare. After 5 minutes of operating time for the temperature to take effect on the motor, I measured the performance with the tachometer aimed at the propeller. An assessment for the performance was to subtract the final rpm that after the 5 minute run, from the beginning rpm of 1,950. The greater the value, the less performance the motor will have. I performed the same tasks on both the “Neutral” and “Cold” tests, except that the temperature was decreased to 50 degrees and 20 degrees respectively. The conclusion of the experiment is that an electric motor will perform better not in a hot or cold environment, but in a neutral or around room temperature.<br><br>

INSULATION AS AN ENERGY SAVER: CAN YOU HAVE TOO MUCH?
John Kelly Ewing
Lakeside High School, Atlanta, GA

Adding more insulation to a wall system might not always be the most cost effective course of action for weatherproofing a house. This study attempts to find the point of diminishing return for adding extra wall insulation. Knowing the point of diminishing return for wall insulation will enable homeowners to devote the appropriate funds to wall insulation and allocate additional funds to other components of home weatherproofing. It was hypothesized that, for the temperature contrast being tested, there would be a point of diminishing return for adding extra wall insulation at a thermal resistance of 3.52 SI R-value.<br><br>Eight different thickness or thermal resistances of rigid foamboard insulation were tested by creating a forty-liter, heavily-insulated box. A sample of each thickness of insulation was placed in the box so that it separated the box into a larger, thirty-liter chamber and a smaller, ten-liter chamber. Ice was placed in the larger chamber, the box was sealed, and the chambers’ temperatures were recorded. The temperature regressions were used to determine the performance of each sample. Incremental increases in thermal resistance improved performance more for thinner samples.<br><br>Data from the tests revealed a point of diminishing return between the thermal resistances of 1.761 and 2.818 SI R-value. This was less than the hypothesized value of 3.52 SI R-value. Future research might include further isolating the point of diminishing return or evaluating insulation for other temperature ranges. Eventual results could lead to a more comprehensive approach to weatherproofing, involving the entire weatherproofing system.

SEARCH ROBOT
Matthew James Mokler
Tucson High Magnet School, Tucson Arizona, United States of America 

The creation of a small-scale autonomous land vehicle is the design goal of this project. The proposed robot will be able to search out and mark different metallic objects, such as meteorites or metal deposits, on a large land area without human contact. This technology can also be implemented in mine detection robots capable of searching on land or at sea for explosives. This field holds value because it alleviates the need for a person to do these time consuming and sometimes dangerous tasks. <br><br> The finished robot is forty-five by fifty centimeters, constructed from PVC and ABS plastics. Each plastic piece was separately cut and then chemically welded together forming strong bonds between each plastic. The robot is four wheel drive with a fully independent suspension using universals to deliver the power to the wheels. The steering mechanism involves rotating the rear of the robot so the front ultrasonic ranger can remain in alignment with the onboard compass. <br><br> The ability to locate metal deposits or objects comes from an onboard metal detector coil mounted on the underside of the robot. Its autonomous capability comes from an onboard Basic Stamp 2sx microcontroller. The microcontroller receives readings from the ultrasonic ranger mounted on a servo in the front of the robot that provides object avoidance. The microcontroller also receives a pulse with modulation signal from an onboard magnetic compass that allows the robot to maintain a heading. Using these three sensors the robot is able to conduct its search. <br><br>

IN VITRO STUDY OF THERMAL ABLATION CAPABILITIES OF GOLD-GOLD SULFIDE NANOPARTICLES FOR HUMAN LIVER CANCER THERAPY
Suhas Ravindranath Bharadwaj
duPont Manual High School, Louisville, KY

Research in gold nanoparticles as cancer therapeutics is a fast growing field in biomedicine. Based on the Mie Scattering Theory, gold nanoparticles may be tuned to any plasmon resonant peak wavelength based upon geometry of the nanoparticles. For biomedical applications, gold nanoparticles are tuned to have resonant peak wavelength absorbance in the Near Infrared (NIR) region, in which the physiological materials such as water and hemoglobin do not have peak absorbance wavelengths. Therefore, NIR laser shining upon nanoparticles causes photothermal ablation of cancer tumors with minimal interference with surrounding normal tissue. <br><br>The toxicity of gold-gold sulfide nanoparticles to human dermal fibroblast cells and hepatocellular carcinoma cells with NIR laser activation was tested.Gold-gold sulfide nanoparticles were synthesized by the reaction of chloroauric acid and sodium thiosulfate. Coatings of chitosan, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and chitosan plus PEG, all with the combination of anti-epithelial growth factor receptor were added to the nanoparticles to improve the biocompatibility and stability of gold nanoparticles (and attachibility to cancerous cells). Live/dead stains to image apoptosis, silver stains to image binding of nanoparticles to cells, and MTT Assays to measure mitochondrial activity of cells were performed after NIR light activation with nanoparticles. On average 93% of Hepatocellular carcinoma does not survive after laser activation with particles. But specifically coated with chitosan plus PEG nano particle activation induces 96% of cellular death in cancer cells. While this leads to promising results the HDF cells that were used in the study survived on average 86% of the time with chitosan 82.3% with peg and 93.8 with both Peg+Chitosan.

STUDY OF N-DODECYLTRIMETHYLAMMONIUM BROMIDE (C12TAB) SURFACTANTS USING MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS
Leah Nicole Nation
MAST Academy, Miami Florida, USA

Surfactants are molecules which contain both hydrophobic and hydrophilic ends, making them useful in everyday products, such as detergents and soaps. There have been few studies about surfactants on the nanoscale level. To further understand surfactants, the indentation of aggregates of the surfactant n-dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (C12TAB) by a carbon nanotube were simulated and analyzed. It was hypothesized that a micelle, an aggregate of surfactants, would break apart when indented by a carbon nanotube rather than slip out from underneath the indenter. The results support the hypothesis. The indentation of a micelle by a carbon nanotube in the presence of both silica and graphite substrates at speeds of 25 m/s, 50 m/s, and 100 m/s all break apart the micelle.

WHY I SHOULD HAVE A NEWER, BETTER CAR
Jeanie Elizabeth Janas
New Prairie High School, New Carlisle, IN. , USA

Hypothesis: High Mileage produces worse ride characteristics.<br><br>Procedure: I chose railroad tracks as my input. I learned that a vehicle body motion can be described by six degrees of freedom. I could only really feel the vertical, roll, and pitch. I thought of 3 vehicle aspects that could affect the results: tire pressure, vehicle speed, and how much weight was in the car. I had access to accelerometers and a SoMat eDAQ data acquisition system. I learned to use the data acquisition system and analysis software. The time histories were hard to directly compare. The first analysis i did was to use the statistics feature to calculate the range of acceleration. This produced very repeatable results, but only measured the largest bump, not all of the bumps. A rainflow analysis counts all of the bumps. This provides the overall analysis of what is going on, but is hard to compare a lot of different trials. I used the damage comparator to reduce all the bins of the rainflow analysis into one number. This analysis appears to have very significant variationl. <br><br>Conclusions: Measuring a car's ride is not an easy thing. Understanding what vehicle parameters affect the result and the variability of the data is very important. Usually one analysis is not enough. Several different analysis methods are usually used for complete understanding. I was surprised that there was not more of a difference between a Neon with 162,000 miles and 28,000 miles.

FREE ENERGY IN YOUR OWN BACK YARD
Brian Joseph Sutterer
Terre Haute North Vigo High School, Terre Haute, IN, USA

Due to our depleting energy resources, I wanted to explore alternate sources of energy in this project. I came across the concept of the Stirling Engine, a very efficient heat engine, and that the ground temperature 6’ deep stays nearly constant year round. My engineering goals in this project were to build and analyze a heat transfer system that can deliver heat to a Stirling Engine, as well as construct a Stirling Engine. For my heat transfer system, I constructed a system with three 6'-3" long Copper rods, with thermistors placed along the rod, and placed the rods in an equal length PVC pipe, with the rods sticking out of the bottom 3", and insulated the inside of the pipe. To run my outside test, I first dug a hole in the ground 6' deep, and then took initial temperature readings. I then placed the system in the ground and took temperature readings over a span of two days. To analyze my data I developed a spreadsheet that, using equations that I derived, allowed me to solve for the amount of heat energy that comes out of the system, as well as the theoretical temperature at the top of rod. From my results, I saw that heat clearly was transferred through the system, and there was always a temperature difference between the top of the rod and the air outside. This means that a Stirling Engine can run on the system, and ultimately turn a generator that will produce electricity.

GREAT MUSICIANS, GREAT INSTRUMENTS: AN UNDERSTANDING OF SOUND QUALITY USING AN ANALYTICAL APPROACH
Ashlee Noelle Brewer
New Prairie High School New Carlisle, IN USA

The purpose of this project is to understand sound waves and how the combination of different frequencies of sound waves combines to allow the human ear to distinguish between a clarinet and a trumpet. <br><br> The clarinet and trumpet sections in the band were asked to play three notes, three separate times. A data acquisition system was used to record the notes and the notes were analyzed using a Fast Fourier Transform. The magnitudes of the harmonics were recorded and normalized so as to compare the data. To compare differences in the three notes, I documented exact primary frequencies, but presented the data in multiples of the primary instead of the actual frequencies.<br><br> The clarinets were better tuned than the trumpets. The clarinets’ variation from perfect harmonics was smaller than the trumpets’ variation. The chair in the section did not affect the tuning of each instrument. Some of the middle chair players tuned just as well as the first chair player.<br><br>

CONTRIBUTION OF THE CILIARY BODY TO THE FORCES MEASURED DURING SIMULATION OF ACCOMODATION
Guillermo Andres Tinoco
MAST Academy, Miami, Fl, USA

Accommodation is the ability of the eye to change its focus, enabling a person to see near objects. According to the Helmholtz theory, the ciliary muscle contracts during accommodation, releasing the tension on the zonules and lens capsule. The released pressure on the lens capsule enables it to contract, resulting in an increased thickness of the lens. Studies have shown that changes in the ciliary muscle with age may affect the loss of accommodation with age, a condition known as presbyopia. The purpose of this experiment is to quantify the contribution of the ciliary muscle to the forces measured during simulation of accommodation when using an optomechanical lens stretching system. <br><br>Post-mortem cynomolgus monkey (n=14) and human (n=4) eyes including the lens, capsule, zonules, ciliary body, and sclera were mounted in an ex vivo accommodation simulator (EVAS). This machine allows the postmortem lens to be stretched radially, mimicking the accommodative response in living primates. The lenses were symmetrically stretched in 0.25mm steps, for a total of 4mm diameter, while the load was continuously recorded. At each step, a digital picture was taken. These measurements were repeated 3 times. The lens was removed from the system by cutting through the zonules and hyaloid membrane. The eye containing only the ciliary body-sclera system was stretched in the same way as described above. <br><br>The ciliary body diameter and load-diameter responses with and without the lens were compared. The ciliary body alone accounts for approximately 30% of the load recorded during ex vivo stretching experiments.<br><br>

BODY ARMOR UTILIZING A SHEAR THICKENING FLUID
Jared Joseph Carter
Sarasota High School, Sarasota, FL

The purpose of this experiment is to determine the effect the mass % of solute (silica) in a shear thickening fluid impregnated in Kevlar fabric has on ballistic penetration depth, and if low velocity testing results can be used to predict the effect of high velocity testing. Solutions at 0, 5, 10, and 15% wt. silica were mixed using a vortex mixer. The solutions were then diluted in an equal volume of ethanol to aid impregnation into the Kevlar. The Kevlar was dipped in the diluted solution, then dried in an oven to remove the ethanol. The target--3 layers for low velocity testing and 10 layers for high velocity testing--was attached to a clay witness, shot, and the depth of penetration was recorded. Results showed that as the concentration increased, the depth of penetration decreased, although the effect seemed to level off. The results were also replicated at high velocity, using a 22 caliber pistol rather than a pellet gun. Future research will include testing a variety of different firearms on the impregnated fabric, and testing different types of silica nanoparticles.

The methanol fuel cell is highly valued because of methanol's high energy density and ability to be stored and transported much like gasoline. <br><br>There are, however, many problems inherent to the DMFC. One major problem is called methanol crossover, which occurs when methanol crosses the proton exchange membrane and begins to oxidize at both the anode and the cathode. Much materials research has been conducted into the membrane material in order to minimize methanol crossover, but a viable solution has not yet been found.<br><br>This year's research centered on a way to block methanol crossover. Varying thicknesses of Pt were tested to find an optimum Pt catalyst layer. Once this was found, varying thicknesses of Al were placed below the Pt catalyst layer on the anode side. Aluminum has the ability to form grain boundaries, which may exclude methanol but allow hydrogen ions to permeate to the cathode for reduction.<br><br>Series were run relating Pt thickness to Al thickness, and all data were collected in multiple tests in order to run statistical analysis such as t-tests and polynomial regressions with standard errors of the mean. Results thus far suggest that the Al surface layer has a very beneficial effect on the performance of the cell, improving the voltage response curve and the power density response curve versus current. This suggests that methanol crossover is decreasing. More research is currently being conducted to find an optimum Al surface layer thickness.

BREAKIN' BRIDGES
Naivasha M. Harris
Murphy High School, Mobile, AL

I wanted to know out of the arch, beam and suspension bridge, which one would have the highest bearing capacity. My findings would help build safer bridges. I predicted that the supesion would perform the best and the beam would perform the worst. I used various types of craft sticks to create miniature versions of the bridges. My designs were created by myself after studying pictures of each bridge type. I used the weight of rocks and water to test my bridges. They were placed between two stands to simulate a real bridge. A container was hung with yarn under each bridge. Weight was slowly added until each bridge gave in and broke. Each bridge type was tested five times. The average result for the beam was 2.42468 kilograms. The arch's average was 2.73306 kilograms. 2.9595 kilograms was the average for the suspension bridge. After the experirmentation, my hypothesis was proven to be correct. The supsension bridge did bear the most weight before collapsing. This shows what my research has told me in that suspension bridges are very strong.

AERONAUTICS PHASE 5
Bryan William Bailey
Alpena High School, Alpena, AR, USA

This project demonstrates the use of aeronautical engineering concepts of proportion, or ratio, utilizing fuselage mass to wing surface area. This continued experimentation specifically identifies weight and stability factors.<br><br> Five replica airplanes were built and five gliders were assembled. The weight of all aircraft were measured and calculated to find 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. Additional weights in sand increments were added to each fuselage. All aircraft were tested in wind tunnels, including airborne status calculation in seconds. In addition, gliders were tested in a gym, utilizing a box fan from four different wind directions and shot from a self-designed launcher. The linear distance, magnitude distance, and angle off line of flight were calculated.<br><br> The data collected for twenty tests was the 26.0g airplane's average status was 0.52413 seconds; 32.5g airplane's average was 0.53896 seconds; 39.0g airplane's average was 0.51799 seconds; 45.5g airplane's average was 0.468825 seconds; 52.0g airplane's average was 0.417075 seconds. The glider's averages for five tests from five different wind directions: #1 magnitude of 6.5166254 meters at 1.9 degrees right; #2 16.06347 meters at 5.7 degrees right; #3 23.23287 meters at 1.8 degrees left; #4 23.01773 meters at 2.5 degrees left; #5 20.26031 meters at 30.2 degrees left.<br><br> Comparing the 52.0g airplane had the least airborne status while the 32.5g airplane had the greatest. When comparing all tests the 52.0g airplane only had a difference of 0.2064 seconds. Comparing gliders the #3 had the greatest magnitude and linear distance and was 1.8 degrees off flight line.

REAL TIME ANALYSIS AND OPTIMIZATION OF SOLID FUEL ROCKET ENGINES
Anthony James Neuberger
Torrey Pines High School, San Diego CA, USA

Maximizing the efficiency of solid fuel rockets and controlling the flight profile requires the tailor engineering of multiple design features. Previously, I identified engine design features which had significant impact on thrust generation. However, data was collected and analyzed after the burn test. The purpose of this project is to simultaneously monitor multiple engine performance parameters, collect data on the millisecond timescale and analyze it in real time. To achieve these goals, I designed and built a rocket engine test device with multiple sensors integrated into the apparatus. I also wrote a computer program called Rapid Information Procurement with Real-time Analysis Program (RIPRAP) which collects and analyzes data in real time. Thermocouples and pressure sensors were placed in the engine burn chamber and nozzle to monitor temperature and pressure. Analog signals from the sensors were converted to digital signals, imported into RIPRAP and analyzed. RIPRAP calculated the amount of fuel spent, the amount of fuel remaining, the dynamic pressure in the engine and nozzle, the volume and speed of the gas exiting the burn chamber through the nozzle and the energy and force produced over time. RIPRAP also generated theoretical flight profiles. All data was saved in spreadsheets for re-analysis with user-defined parameters to predict performance prior to building new engines. Finally, RIPRAP monitored engine performance against predefined values and generated digital output signals when appropriate. Future work will integrate these output signals into the rocket test device thereby completing the information and control loop.

NANOSTRUCTURE ARCHITECTURES FOR PHOTOELECTROCHEMICAL SOLAR CELLS
Thomas Leigh Hauch
John Adams High School, South Bend, IN

Diminishing stores of natural fuels and the obvious environmental implications of carbon-based energy have hastened the need for a new, alternative source. Of the various possibilities for long-term energy production, photovoltaic solar energy remains the most viable option for future generations. Although high costs and relatively low efficiencies have since prevented a global implementation of solar technology, emerging research has demonstrated the potential of nanostructure architectures to resolve these problems.<br><br><br> Among various nanostructures that have been synthesized so far, quantum dot nanocrystals have the potential to significantly improve the photoelectrical properties of solar cells. Quantum dots act as sensitizer molecules, absorbing light over a broad spectrum of radiation. CdSe and CdS quantum dot particles have the ability to extend the photoresponse of certain cells into the visible spectrum. In the proposed research, a semiconductor oxide (TiO2) and CdS quantum dots will be synthesized. The quantum dot nanocrystals will be attached directly to the surface of a TiO2 semiconductor film. These modified anodes will be characterized by microscopy and spectroscopy. The solar cell performance will be evaluated by monitoring voltage, current, and power output. The conversion efficiency at different wavelengths will be determined for pristine TiO2 anodes as well as those sensitized by quantum dots. It is hypothesized that quantum dots will enhance the overall efficiency of photovoltaic cells, and that the varying of quantum dot size will tune the photoresponse of these cells.

CARBON FIBER MAKES A POINTE!
Harper-Grace Niedermeyer
Catholic High School; Huntsville, Alabama; United States

I have a problem finding pointe shoes for ballet class that last longer than two weeks before the shank breaks. I set out to create a personalized shoe, with good flexure strength in the shank that would last longer and be more durable. I decided on carbon fiber as the material for the shank rather than the traditional wood or paper product. Carbon fiber is very light weight and strong, it is used on airplanes, in golfclubs, and in bicycles. I first had to make the tool for the shoe, make a shoe model, and then create a shank to put on that shoe form. I also planned, using this material, to tailor the stiffness of the shank to match the needs of each individual dancer. I discovered that yes, it is feasible to make a shank from carbon fiber with good flexure and strength.

ELECTROMAGNETIC RECIPROCATING PUMP
Matthew James Mokler
Tucson High Magnet School, Tucson Arizona, United States of America 

Standard reciprocating pumps are mechanically complex requiring frequent maintenance and high production costs. If the complexity could be reduced, a less expensive, more reliable pump could be manufactured. In this design, combining the motion source into the pump assembly reduced complexity. Two hollow magnetic neodymium pistons, inside a cylinder with large coils around each, were moved in a reciprocating motion by controlling the direction of current through the coils. The pistons were kept within the coil range by placing neodymium magnets on the outside of the cylinder at both ends and at the center. Piston frequency was controlled using one of two sensing methods; one measuring the voltage drop of a five-volt signal introduced into the primary coils and the second, measuring an induced voltage in the secondary coils. This information was processed by a microcontroller that controlled H-bridges to create the alternating current needed to move the pistons in relationship to the pressure of the substance being pumped. The microcontroller communicated with an interface box that allowed the manipulation of variables within the microcontroller and allowed for monitoring of piston frequencies and temperatures of coils and H-bridges. After numerous failed attempts and reconstruction of the control circuitry, an operating pump was achieved. This new design could offer a reliable low cost alternative for many pumps used today.

KUDZU CALORIMETRY, A STUDY OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF KUDZU AS A FUEL
James Edward Whitfield LeCroy
Jefferson County International Baccalaureate School, Birmingham, AL

Kudzu is a nuisance plant in the Southeastern United States. Many attempts have been made to find productive uses for it, but the persistent jungle of vine remains. Scientists have recommended utilizing it as a fuel source. This experiment was conducted to determine if kudzu could be considered a useful fuel in comparison with hickory and charcoal. Ten samples each of kudzu, hickory, and charcoal of the same approximate size were burned under a home-made calorimeter. It was found on average that kudzu produced 1004.05 calories/gram, hickory produced 1337.23 calories/gram, and charcoal produced 2280.03 calories/gram. When comparing charcoal and kudzu, there were statistically significant differences in peak temperature, burn times, mass lost, and energy production. Kudzu generated 44 % of the calories/gram produced by charcoal. When comparing hickory and kudzu, there was a statistically significant difference in energy production but not between peak temperature, burn times or average mass lost. Kudzu generated 75% of the calories/gram produced by hickory. Considering that kudzu is a woody vine and hickory is a hardwood tree, it seems that the overall energy yield from kudzu over time compares favorably to hickory, given the years required to grow a harvestable hickory tree suitable for use as a fuel. Kudzu is able to be harvested twice a year and requires no cultivation. In the Southeastern United States, the abundance of kudzu and its notoriously fast growth suggest that aggressive harvesting with efficient processing as a renewable alternative fuel source might be economically feasible and environmentally beneficial.

"CAN A VP SHUNT MALFUNCTION BE DETERMINED WITHOUT A CT SCAN OR MRI?"
Lauren Alexandra Fleck
Dunwoody High School, Dunwoody, GA

Hydrocephalus is caused by a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid within the ventricles of the brain. Excess fluid can increase intracranial pressure and result in brain damage, or worse. Many of these patients will need emergency surgery to place a Ventricular-Peritoneal (VP) Shunt to control hydrocephalus. VP Shunts are know to be problematic and can malfunction requiring emergency surgery. A shunt malfunction is life-threatening condition that is typically confirmed by a CT Scan subjecting the patient to potentially harmful radiation. Malfunctions mimic typical headaches often resulting in unnecessary CT Scans. This experiment and research explore the possibility of using energy scavenging pressure gauges to transmit pressure conditions along the implanted shunt providing positive diagnosis of failure without having a CT scan. In this experiment, an apparatus was built to mimic shunt blockage conditions at the intracranial ventricular region, the pressure valve region, and the peritoneal cavity region of the shunt. The experimental results show that different shunt blockage conditions result in differential pressure readings that are unique to each blockage condition. Because of advances in energy scavenging nano-technology pressure sensors, the results of this experiment point to the possibility that VP shunt hydrocephalus patients may no longer have to endure potentially harmful radiation from a CT scan to diagnose a shunt malfunction.

OPTIMIZING A MODEL FOR ROCKET STABILITY
Robert Gerard Wright
York School, Monterey, California, USA

This experiment tested whether using the RockSim method to calculate the center of pressure (CP) in conjunction with the generally accepted “rule” that the CP must be at least one caliber (one diameter of the rocket’s airframe) behind the center of gravity (CG) accurately predicts a stable rocket flight. The experiment identified which relationship between the CG and CP results in a straight, near vertical rocket flight in a variety of wind conditions.<br><br> In order to determine the optimal distance between the CG and CP, eight identical rockets were built with varying fin heights, which allowed for a varied CP/CG relationship. In order to classify each of the flights, four wind ranges and seven flight stability profiles were devised. The intent was to launch each of the rockets at least once in each of the four wind ranges and categorize the stability of each flight into one of the flight stability profiles. Using the results, the optimal placement for the CP in relation to the CG was determined.<br><br> The results of launching the rockets showed that flights are near vertical when the relationship between the CG and CP falls within a certain range. This range decreases as the wind velocity increases. Outside of this range, rockets either weathercock into the wind or fly in an unstable manner.<br><br> The experimental results supported he hypothesis. Using the RockSim method for calculating the center of pressure in conjunction with a caliber range of 1 to 1.5 is an accurate method for predicting stability.<br><br>

BIOMECHANICAL RESPONSE OF THE IN-SITU PRIMATE LENS
Isabelle Dortonne
North Miami Beach Senior High School, North Miami Beach, FL

Presbyopia, the most common refractive disorder of the elderly, is the age-related loss of accommodative ability, or near vision. Lens and capsule-based theories of presbyopia assert that the decrease in accommodative amplitude can be attributed to increased hardening of the lens substance and decreased elasticity of the lens capsular bag with age. One novel technique in the restoration of accommodation is Phaco-Ersatz, or lens refilling. The promise of Phaco-Ersatz can be assessed by characterizing the biomechanical properties of the lens in its natural versus empty state. Postmortem cynomolgus monkey, rhesus monkey, and human eyes of varying ages were stretched in their natural and empty states in an Ex-Vivo Accommodation Simulator in eight, 0.25mm steps, mimicking the changes in zonular tension that occur in-vivo. The diameter-force relationship of the natural and empty lens were characterized and compared. There was no relationship between the empty-bag diameter slope and age, indicating that the lens capsule’s mechanical properties do not change the setting of accommodation. Moreover, the ratio of the empty capsule to natural lens load-diameter slope decreased significantly with age, proving that it is the lens material, and not the elasticity of the capsular bag, that contributes to presbyopia. The results confirm the postulation that accommodation can be efficiently conducted as long as the lens contents have proper viscoelastic properties. Thus, Phaco-Ersatz is a viable future treatment for presbyopia.

F.I.N.D.-2 THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN AUTONOMOUS SURVEYING VESSEL
Benjamin Thomas Unsworth
Kingswood Academy, Sulphur, LA, USA

Surveying waterways is a monotonous task requiring many tedious man-hours. Inattention often results in costly delays.<br><br> The purpose of this project is to design a robotic vessel with minimal manual assistance to survey waterways for civil engineers. The vessel will collect the latitude, longitude and depth of the waterways for mapping and navigational uses.<br><br> The major elements for this project include: vessel design, steering, motor control, power, and a program to control it. A curved bottom boat was built that is stable at the slow speeds the survey requires. An electric trolling motor propels the vessel; reducing the vibrations gas motors could create. It is mounted inside the boat for easier access by the steering mechanism. A coupling moves up and down on a screw drive, directing the trolling motor. A geared motor rotates the screw drive. An infrared sensor detects the degree the trolling motor is turned. An electronic compass and the GPS determine the boat’s direction. A Parallax BS2p microprocessor controls the electronic equipment. It receives and uses data from the infrared sensor and compass to determine how much the trolling motor turns.<br><br> A laptop with a custom program determines the path the boat follows. It collects the latitude and longitude from a survey quality GPS and the depth from a Fathometer.<br><br> This project provides an alternative method to the tedious task of surveying waterways manually.

COMPARISON OF HYDROPONICS VS. AQUAPONICS SYSTEMS
Travis Joseph Lopez
Skyline Technical High School, Phoenix, AZ, USA 

The purpose of this research is to design a low cost aquaponics system for developing communities that does not require a large area, or heavily concentrated nutrients. Benefits from this system would provide a sustainable food source of protein from freshwater prawns, and carbohydrates and vitamins from vegetables. <br><br>This Phase 1 research focused on determining the growth rates (mass) of three types of plants in an aquaponics system compared to a hydroponics system. Each system used three types of plants. Two are considered a viable market commodity, Latvca sativa (lettuce), Capsicum annuum (pepper), and an ornamental, Chlorophytum comosum (spider plant). The aquaponics system used freshwater prawns and required the engineering of a special filter to support the plants in the system.<br><br>At the time of this writing, the data shows the Latvca sativa having a 100% increase to its mass in the hydroponics system over the aquaponics system. The Capsicum annuum and Chlorophytum comosum had an average of 58.5% increase in mass in the aquaponics system. Collectively, the plants in the aquaponics system averaged an overall 8% increase in the mass of the plants over the hydroponics system.<br><br>Based on the results of this research, it is determined that designing a system combining the advantageous characteristics of both systems can not only provide a sustainable food source for economically deprived communities, but also provide market commodities to these communities. Phase II will involve the development of a dual system model to determine growth and production in comparison to the individual system.<br><br>

ANALYSIS OF NANOFIBER-BASED SCAFFOLDS
Abigail Rose Lewis
Rockdale Magnet School for Science and Technology, Conyers, GA

Nanotechnology is of international interest because nanofibers are becoming an alternate growth surface for cell transportation during plastic surgery or organ transplants. The purpose of this experiment was to fabricate a nanofiber-based scaffold using different polymer solutions and different voltages, 5 and 21 kV. It was hypothesized that a nanofiber-based scaffold could be successfully created by using the process of electrospinning and that the various voltages and different solutions would have an effect on the surface area of the scaffold. The procedure used during this experiment was generally modeled after a previous study by J.R. Venugopal, except the independent variables were different in the current experiment. Electrospinning was used to spin the fibers onto a collection plate. Two polymer solutions were used; one made of methanol, choloroform, and PCL, and another made of PCL, HFP, and collagen. The diameters of the fibers were measured after viewing under an electron microscope. A greater number of smaller fibers indicated greater surface area and a more efficient scaffold. To analyze the data, two t-tests were performed to determine the significance of the variables. It was found that the different voltages were not statistically significant. However, the difference between the separate solutions was statistically significant. The collagen fibers provided more surface area for the future growth of cells. As a preliminary study, epidermal cells were grown on a scaffold sample and viewed under a microscope. It showed that the scaffold aided the growth of cells.

A device like this can be used to produce duplicates of an object, such as a component used in a machine. It can also be used to aid graphic designers and three-dimensional game developers. To illustrate its uses I have used a CNC lathe and a CNC mill to cut out my three-dimensional models of different types of objects.

I then designed a device that allows a camera to take digital images a full 360° around an object. As the camera takes images of an object, there is a laser pointer that projects a laser line onto the object. My computer program scans the digital images, determining where the laser line intersects the object in each of the pictures. By using trigonometry, my program calculates three-dimensional points along the places where the laser line intersects the object. After calculating all of the three-dimensional points, my program then displays the three-dimensional model of the object on the computer screen.<br><br>

AN INVESTIGATION OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF LIQUEFACTION-INDUCED LATERAL SPREADING ON A POPULATED URBAN SETTING
Evelyn Chang
University High School, Irvine, CA

The main objectives of this project was to: a) clarify the existing definition of a “free face” in the currently vague and ambiguous lateral spread criteria and b) to provide a map of the City of Irvine with clear outlines of the specific areas that require attention to lateral spreading. In specific, the contours of equal lateral spread magnitudes will be established on both sides of the "free face" channel to highlight the potential extent of damage that may be associated with lateral spreading in an urban setting.<br><br> The model setup consisted of two main elements: the soil in its container, and a working shake table. A model slope was constructed with either bare earth, rip rap covering, concrete-paving, or a reinforced concrete retaining wall, and placed under seismic agitation to determine its lateral spread potential. <br><br> The model was prepared by the filling of a soil box with the essential soil and carving out the slope based upon a contour drawn alongside the box. The entire box, along with the soil, was then set on a shake table and placed under a seismic force of about 0.25g. The movement of the box was captured with a camcorder and analyzed digitally.<br><br> The rip rap slope and the concrete lining slope displayed many characteristic damages associated with lateral spread, including the subsidence, or slumping, of the crown point and back edge, the heaving of the toe, the tension cracks, and extensive ground fissures. On the other hand, the retaining wall seemed to resist the forces of lateral spread, merely displaying some typical damages associated strictly with liquefaction: the “floating” on the liquefied soil and the loss of contact between the wall and the soil.<br><br> In conclusion, the rip rap slope and the concrete lining slope should clearly be characterized as “free face” slopes, while a retaining wall should remain outside the category. Additionally This calls for the importance of new reinforced designs and the need to retrofit current slopes with further reinforcement.

PAIN FREE SOCKET
Katherine Emily Bomkamp
North Point High School for Science, Technology and Industry, Waldorf, MD

Approximately 80% of amputees experience phantom pain, which can be severe and debilitating. A survey of amputees determined that the application of heat can help to ease the pain and provide comfort. However, use of heating pads and similar devices is not practical in many settings. There is a need for a device that provides access to the relief heat provides, no matter what the situation. To accomplish this goal, a custom Pain Free Socket was designed consisting of a carbon fiberglass outer socket with a removable inner Pro-Flex socket, designed to provide insulation. Heating elements connected to a battery pack were placed along the outside of the inner socket applying heat to the limb. The temperature is controlled by a microprocessor and thermocouple, which measures the temperature inside the socket. The microprocessor is programmed to shut down the current if the heat exceeds a threshold. A wireless remote control allows the user to discretely activate the socket, preserving privacy. The prosthetic has always been viewed as a mobility and cosmetic device, never before has it been used for pain management

The purpose of this project was to prove that a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generator could be made which uses ionized rocket exhaust gases passing though a magnetic field to generate an electrical current. <br><br> A rocket had to be designed to produce a supersonic flow at temperatures around 2600ºK. MAPP and oxygen where chosen as fuel and oxidizer through rocket calculations in CEA (Chemical Equilibrium and Applications) code.

DESIGN, TEST, AND FEASIBILITY OF DUAL ION STREAM ACCELERATION ENGINES FUELED BY AMBIENT MATTER
Michael Eric Taylor
Bradshaw High School, Florence Alabama, USA

Ion propulsion is just beginning to be used in the space program with Deep Space 1, even though it has long been present in science fiction works. The ion engine used on this spacecraft carried its own gaseous fuel, which it ionized and accelerated, then neutralized with an electron beam. The goal of this project is to simulate the vacuum of low earth orbit to determine if there is enough ambient matter to fuel an ion drive as well as if combining two accelerated ion streams with different polarities could be used as an efficient method of neutralizing the streams. If the streams are not neutralized, the ions will loop back into the engine significantly decreasing the desired momentum transfer. Thus far, two versions of a test engine have been built, a large-scale experimental model and a small vacuum test model. Currently the vacuum test model produced a small amount of thrust. The power supply’s waveform became highly distorted and prevented further successful tests both in and out of a vacuum. The large-scale model has some duplicate components still under construction. Those components that have been built also have been successfully tested for their function. The small-scale model deflects a plastic sheet to measure the produced thrust above the force of friction. Current results indicate that the engine design could be feasible to greatly reduce the cost of space propulsion, since the engine would not require costly fueled to be launched into orbit.

THE EFFECT OF MULTIPLE VARIABLES ON THE STRUCTURAL EFFICIENCY OF A BRIDGE
Daniel Llanes
Hialeah Senior High School, Hialeah, FL

This multi-variable project tests three different independent variables. The problem statements explored were as follows: what is the effect of internal bridge design type on the structural efficiency of a bridge, what is the effect of different structural widths on the structural efficiency of a bridge, and what is the effect of the wood type (density) on the structural efficiency of a bridge? <br><br>The three specific research hypotheses inferred that the Howe internal design bridge, the 20 mm wide bridge and the bass wood material bridge would prove to have the highest efficiency compared to similar models in their respective categories.<br><br>To increase the probability of accurate results for the efficiencies calculated in each of the three experiments, 6 trials were conducted to test each specific research hypothesis (18 bridges per experiment for a total of 54 bridges.) Each bridge was placed on a testing apparatus and the load was applied carefully to the bucket held by the bridges until each structure collapsed.<br><br>Efficiency data was calculated by finding the quotient of the mass of the structure by the mass of the load held prior to collapse. The mean, variance, and standard deviation were calculated for each of the three experimental groups. Conclusively, three t-tests were conducted for each procedure at a significance level of .05 and compared to their respective critical T values based on the degrees of freedom; all of the specific null hypotheses were rejected and all of the specific research and alternative hypotheses were accepted.

THE EFFECT OF AGE ON NON-HUMAN PRIMATE LENS SURFACE CURVATURES DURING SIMULATED ACCOMMODATION
Saramati Narasimhan
Coral Reef Senior High School, Miami, FL

The purpose of this experiment is to measure the age-dependent changes in the lens curvatures of Macaca fascicularis and Papio hamadryas lenses as a function of lens diameter, thickness, and power during ex-vivo simulated accommodation. Image analysis was performed on lens cross-sectional profile images acquired with a time-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) system. Lens shape, power, and force measurements were obtained during stretching, performed with student researchers, on 13 Macaca fascicularis (1.4-9.8 y/o) lenses from 13 donors (PMT 19.1 ± 14.3 hours) and 13 Papio hamadryas (1.8-21 y/o) lenses from 11 donors (PMT = 7.1 ± 9.4 hrs). The surgeon isolated and mounted the lens in EVAS-II. A linear regression was performed on the changes in surface curvatures as function of diameter, thickness, and power during stretching. A linear regression was then performed on the lens radii of curvature/thickness ratio, lens radii of curvature/diameter ratio, and lens radii of curvature/power ratio as a function of age to determine age-dependency. In all eyes, lens stretching flattened both surfaces, increased the diameter, and decreased the thickness. For the Macaca fasciculais and Papio hamadryas, there was no significant age-dependent trend in the lens radii of curvature/thickness ratios (p>0.05), lens radii of curvature/diameter ratios (p>0.05), and lens radii of curvature/power ratios (p>0.05). The lack of age-dependencies suggests the changes in lens surfaces have a constant impact on accommodation, independent of age in both species. It also suggests that there may be fixed ratio between the different lens parameters independent of accommodative state or age.

WIND: ENERGY OF THE FUTURE
Adam Lee Forshier
West Central Valley High School, Stuart, Iowa, Guthrie

The purpose of this experiment was to determine how blade design, blade pitch and blade number affect the RPM readings on an electronic tachometer attached to a wind-driven device.<br><br> A wind tunnel, testing apparatus, and nineteen blade sets of different designs were created and tested at six pitches and two wind speeds.<br><br>The average wind speed of each of the two wind speeds was calculated. Thirty readings of RPM were taken with each blade set at each pitch and wind speeds. All readings were entered into a spreadsheet and the RPM compared to pitch for each blade set and two wind speeds was graphed. A t-test was performed on the data. <br><br> When testing the nineteen blade sets consisting of three blades each, the wind-driven device created the highest RPM with airfoil-shaped blade set 13. Airfoil blades and non-airfoil blades both created the lowest RPM. The most efficient blades were the airfoil blade sets 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16. They consistently produced a high RPM at all wind speeds and pitches. Of the blade designs tested, the airfoil-shaped blades performed the best. Most of the blades showed a lower RPM with the lower wind speed. When testing blade numbers 3, 4, 5, and 6 with the six most efficient blade sets, blade set 16 with four blades created the highest RPM. The data was statistically supported.<br><br>In conclusion blade design, blade pitch and blade number do affect the RPM readings created by a wind-driven device. <br><br>

TELESCOPIC MORPHING WINGS: DESIGN - BUILD - FLY
Stephen Gerald Warrener
East Noble High School, Kendallville, IN USA

This project represents a proof of concept for a span-changing wing structure. It was hypothesized that telescopic wing morphing would greatly increase the capability of an aircraft or UAV. The three part project included designing a wing capable of drastically changing shape, constructing a working model from those plans, and flying/testing this wing on an R/C aircraft. <br><br> Once the wing was constructed it had an extended length of 102.5" and a retracted span of only 64.5". The morphing process was controlled with a winch and cable system. Non-flight calculations included Reynolds Numbers, MAC, aspect ratio, area, and center of gravity figures. The final weight of the aircraft compared very favorable to conventional aircraft of similar size.<br><br> Flight testing was used to analyze the performance of the aircraft. Field data was used to measure airspeed, altitude, acceleration, climb rate, takeoff distance and roll rate. A short wingspan yielded .8m/s sq. acceleration, and a 15% higher top speed. The longer wingspan was capable of a 38% slower cruise, a 5.47m/s climb rate and a 7.6m takeoff distance. A variable span wing is able to exploit only the good characteristics of each wing configuration and change whenever necessary. <br><br> It was concluded that a telescopic wing is practical and demonstrates an exceedingly wide range of flight capabilities. Such a wing is able to perform optimally in specific flight missions without compromise to others. <br><br>

EFFICIENCY OF MAGNETOPLASMA DYNAMIC ENGINES
Peter Friedman
Lane Technical High School, Chicago, IL, USA

Since ionic propulsion was developed in the late 1950’s, its uses have been greatly embraced. However, scientists speculated the full uses of ion propulsion here on earth. Charges in the earth’s atmosphere interfere with the transfer of ions, which in turn makes the use of ion propulsion within our atmosphere difficult. This is because the ions destabilize and provide little force.<br><br>Purpose: The aim of this experiment is to test an ion engine against a propeller-based propulsion device (fan) to find out which provides the most Newton force at the least electrical power.<br><br>Hypothesis: Hypothesized results are that the ion engine will be more efficient, producing more force per unit power due to the method in which electricity is converted into motion directly.<br><br>Procedure: Using charged grids to produce the proper conditions, gnerated ions, can be manipulated by the grids and accelerated. This form of ion propulsion, also known as electrostatic- electrokenetic propulsion, can be used to efficiently produce propulsion without the implementation of a vacuum. First, the engine was constructed, using acrylic tubing. Next, the grids were electrically charged using a high voltage power supply (12000v). The resultant ionic wind pushed a plastic sail on a [near] frictionless track. The distance the sail traveled, and the time the movement took was recorded, and the acceleration was calculated. Using these calculations, the force was calculated using the formula F=MA (force=mass*acceleration).<br><br>Conclusion: The initial hypothesis was proven correct, the ion engine was more efficient then the conventional propeller-based propulsion device by .0001 units of force per unit power.

SPATIAL RESOLUTION ENHANCEMENT OF A PROSTHETIC RETINA
Iheoma Uchanma Umez-Eronini
Benjamin Banneker AHS, Washington DC, 20012, USA

The spatial resolution of a prosthetic retina is enhanced when the electrical crosstalk between top and bottom surface contacts is minimized. This project sought to diminish crosstalk between top and adjacent-bottom ohmic contacts on gallium arsenide (GaAs) wafers, by etching rod or pillar features (> 50 µm high) onto the top and bottom surfaces of the wafer to increase the resistive path between contacts on those surfaces.<br><br> Experiments were performed to determine etch rates on GaAs wafers, for different chemical solutions and reactive gases as well as mask materials for both chemical and reactive ion etching (RIE). Conventional RIE etching with chlorine gas and nickel mask was slower than the chemical etchants considered and produced insufficiently high (< 10 µm) rods. The best result, in terms of the etch rate (2.5 µm/min compared to 0.2 µm/min for RIE), was achieved using a (4:1:1) solution of water, hydrogen peroxide, and ammonium hydroxide with a photoresist mask.<br><br> Before and after etching, resistivity measurements were made between top and several adjacent-bottom ohmic contacts. Before etching resistance values of 7.09, 7.47, 8.61, 8.18, 8.37 and 9.20 mÙ compared to after etching values of 12.98, 13.51, 14.18, 154.3, 14.33 and 15.33 mÙ, confirmed the increased isolation between the contacts achieved by this approach. Consequently cell currents and voltages produced by solar cells fabricated on the top surface of a treated wafer to create a prosthetic retina, will be isolated from adjacent-bottom contacts and the device’s spatial resolution will be enhanced.<br><br>

BIFURCATION OF OIL-WATER EMULSIONS USING ELECTROSTATIC FORCES - YEAR 2
Leanne Louise Thompson
Bishop Kenny High School; Jacksonville, FL; United States of America

The purpose of this project is to determine the impact of sodium chloride in the water of an oil-water solution. <br><br>The project's engineering goal is to redesign the current apparatus and process for effectively separating an oil-water emulsion. <br><br> <br><br>Several engineering problems were encountered: 1) measuring the purity of oil; 2) keeping the pulse generator circuitry cool particularly the power transistor; and 3) maintaining sufficient distance between the electrodes and the oil-water interface during the separation process.<br><br>The purity of oil was dealt with using a capillary centrifuge techniques. The heating problem with the pulse generator’s power transistor was reduced by introducing another power transistor, which allowed a reduction in the duty cycle of the power transistors. Since the duty cycle was reduced each power transistor was “OFF” more than “ON”, which enabled the power transistors to cool down before powering back on. The negative and positive electrodes were designed to ensure that the water-rich solution did not come into contact between the electrodes resulting in shorting out the electrodes and reducing the effectiveness of the process. <br><br>In conclusion once all of the above issues were dealt with, the apparatus that was built could be used for any situation and be effective in separating the specific oil-water emulsion. The applications of this project would be separating light-weight oils contaminated with water caused by accidental oil spills on surface waters. <br><br>

3, 2, 1, IGNITION PHASE II
Phillip Andrew Latus
Sulphur Rock High School, Sulphur Rock, AR United States

Problem: Will the speed, distance and acceleration alter by adding mass to an object in motion? Procedure: Proving speed, distance, acceleration, and time traveled. A engine was mounted in the engine holder that is connected to the bicycle rim. At this time the engine was ignited and the stopwatch was stared at the same time. The stopwatch will also be stopped at the same time the engine stops burning. The speed, distance, time of travel, and acceleration will be recorded on the data page. Conclusion: The testing apparatus is used to measure the distance and force of the rocket engine. Multiply: D = (distance in 0.000 miles) by 5280 (feet). This will give you total feet; divide this by T (time force applied in seconds. This gives you feet per second to convert to meters per second multiply by 0.3048 feet. (0.5280/T = feet per second * 0.3048 feet = meters per second) Centripetal Acceleration – Divide: Vt2 = (the tangential speed squared) by r = (the radius of the circle). As expected, the 50g reduced the speed, acceleration and distance the least; the 100g reduced the speed, acceleration and distance more then the 50g weight. Last the 150g reduced the speed acceleration and distance the most out of all three engines. By adding the mass to the rocket the speed and acceleration will decrease and the time will increase unless the force can be lowered but must be constant over a longer period of time.<br><br>

DAMPENING THE MODES OF VIBRATION OF MULTISTORY SCALE MODELS DUE TO SEISMIC WAVES
Jonathan Brooks Bell
R. Nelson Snider High School, Fort Wayne, IN, The United States of America 

The purpose of my project is to minimize the magnitude of the resonant modes of vibration in scale model multi-story buildings using passive dampers. <br><br>I built five buildings: four, six, and eight stories with three levels of stiffness. I built several damping devices to reduce the vibration of the scale models. These devices included pall-friction dampers, shock absorbers, x-plate metallic dampers, and a base isolator. Initially, I planned to test these dampers using an electric drill driven shaker table. This design proved to be much too unstable and problematic. Eventually this design was replaced with a speaker powered shaker table that I both designed and built. The table was controlled by an laptop computer and power amp. All measurements and controls interfaced to the laptop through the audio jacks. I also built two accelerometers to measure the vibration of the buildings. I created several waveforms of varying frequencies and amplitudes, deciding on a 0-40 Hz swept sine wave. I tested the five buildings, with and without additional mass.<br><br> <br><br>I conclude that all forms of dampening are effective. For example, the six story building with no dampening had a peak acceleration in the 10-20 Hz range of 1.61 G. The pall- friction damper had a peak acceleration of 0.57 G compared to the base isolator which had 0.64 G and the x-plate and the shock absorber which had 0.72 G each. I also conclude that using sound waves to test resonate modes of vibration is a reliable and useful technique.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

THE SEARCH FOR THE PERFECT WING
Amber Michele Butler
Hart County High School, Munfordville, Kentucky, USA

I measured and cut out eleven different Styrofoam wings and, after wrapping them in aluminum foil, labeled them by their measurements (cm). I hung them in a wind tunnel, that was provided by them school, with a fan at one end. Each wing was tested three times, for fifteen seconds, for each wind speed (slow, medium, and fast). There were three test types. The first four wings were to test the wing's depth, the next five were to test the placement of the wing's curve, and the last two wings were to test the best wing at different sizes. All the wings were rated by a system I made, with five being the best and one being the worst. Then all the data was arranged into charts and graphs for each test and the averages.

ETHANOL IN SMALL ENGINES
Grant Allen Lewis
Delavan High School, Delavan IL, USA

The purpose of this science fair research project is to determine the most efficient main fuel jet diameters according to horsepower for a small engine running on various blends of ethanol. <br><br> The first step was to break in two 6.5 HP engines for five hours. Then, two engine dynamometers were built. They consisted of a hydraulic pump system that is restricted by a needle valve. A pressure gauge measured hydraulic pressure, a relief valve was installed for safety, oil coolers cooled the hot hydraulic oil, and a reservoir stored the oil. The two engines were then attached to a dynamometer. Engines were filled with 568 mL of synthetic 5W-30 engine oil and 500 mL of the initial fuel (regular gasoline). Both engines were run at full throttle on regular gasoline, 10% ethanol, and 85% ethanol with 18 different sized main fuel jets. The restriction was kept the same on each hydraulic system and hydraulic oil pressure and RPM measurements were recorded. From these numbers, horsepower was calculated and the fuel jet that assisted the engines to perform with the most power was determined for each fuel mixture. <br><br> In conclusion, the experimenter’s hypothesis was correct. Higher blends of ethanol fuel did require larger main fuel jet orifices to run well. The engines with regular gasoline ran at the highest power with the stock fuel jet. The 10% ethanol-fueled engines ran with the most power with the .91 mm main fuel jet and the 85% ethanol-fueled engine performed the best with the 1.61 mm fuel jet in trial one and the 1.78 mm fuel jet in trial two. The 85% ethanol-fueled engines performed as well as gasoline fueled engines with the standard sized, .84 mm jet. However, with larger fuel jets, more fuel is consumed compared to a smaller sized main fuel jet.<br><br>

MICROFLUIDIC DEVICE FOR RAPID ISOLATION OF PURE LEUKOCYTE POPULATIONS
Melis Nuray Anahtar
Montgomery Blair High School, Silver Spring MD, USA

The goal of this study is to create a microfluidic device that isolates pure leukocyte populations by lying erythrocytes in a minimum period of time. The device was designed in AutoCAD, produced in a microfabrication facility using soft lithography, and tested using different bloods, lysing solutions, and quenching solutions. The data shows that an approximately 97% pure leukocyte population is produced by the device. The results of this study suggest that achieving nearly pure leukocyte populations is feasible and may potentially aid in the study of a host's immune response to injury.

FLIGHT AND LIFT
Yichi (Ian) Zhang
Dunlap High School, Dunlap, Illinois, The United States of America

The objective of this experiment is to develop a two-dimensional wind tunnel system, measure lift, one of the most important forces in the field of aerodynamics, with the designed system, and investigate the factors such as angle of attack and wind velocity that affect lift. <br><br>A wind tunnel system, including a wind tunnel, three manometers for measuring pressure, and an apparatus connecting the wind tunnel to the wind source, has been developed. The dimensions of the wind tunnel are based on the mass conservation equation. Several factors such as the boundary layer effect, wind source capability, and the wind velocity distribution along the tunnel have also been taken into consideration. The system has been used to measure the lift generated by an airfoil. The angle of attack and the wind velocity are the two variables of the experiment. In the experiment, 5 angles of attack ranging from -10 to 10 degrees and two flow rates, representing two different wind velocities, have been used to investigate their impact on lift. For each angle of attack and velocity the pressure difference, representing the lift, has been measured.<br><br>The wind tunnel system has been proved successful in investigating the factors that affect lift. The lift is very sensitive to angle of attack. An increase in the angle of attack increases lift, and decreasing it decreases the lift. As velocity increases, so does the lift. It is also observed that the lift distribution along the chord of the airfoil is different. <br><br>

THE DEVELOPMENT OF A BANDAGE USING A POLYMER, POLYVINYL PYRROLIDONE, AND AN ANTIBIOTIC, POLYSPORIN.
Cuong Viet Nguyen
Sarasota High, Sarasota, Florida, United States of America

Escherichia Coli, strain K-12, is known to be innocuous to humans. It is being used to determine the effects of a polymer film, Polyvinyl Pyrrolidone (PVP), on its growth. The film acts as an adhesive bandage containing the antibiotic Polysporin to inhibit bacterial proliferation. The project’s purpose is to observe the anti-microbial effects of a Polyvinyl Pyrrolidone and Polysporin solution on a culture of Escherichia Coli. The hypothesis was that the polymer/antibiotic solution would inhibit bacterial growth. The project was tested to see how adhesive and what shapes the solution would form once polymerized. The polymer powder (using three different Molecular Weights (MW) of 2,500; 10,000; and 40,000) was dissolved in 100% alcohol and let to evaporate. The film showed that higher level MWs were the ones able to be picked up using tweezers. The other two cracked more as MW decreased. Molar ratios of the number of monomers in each solution were equilibrated, but the same results were obtained. When tested on the cultures, both with bacteria on the surface and incorporated in the agar, the antibiotic solutions were more capable of inhibiting bacterial growth. Solutions lacking antibiotics were still able to inhibit growth. There were a few scattered colonies located where the films were though, possibly due to the E. Coli incorporating itself into the solution droplets before polymerization. Further tests must be performed, by making polymer film disks and placing this on the agar to see if this can inhibit growth and not just other factors.

SAVE THE WATER. RECLAIM THE RAIN.
Shelby Lynn Terry
Wildwood High School, Wildwood, Florida, USA

The student researcher wanted to find out if it would be possible to design and build a device that would be able to function properly and recycle water that was used to water plants or rainwater that the plants did not use. First, the researcher designed the system. Then, measure out an area of 10 square feet and outline in biodegradable marking source. Clear the area of all plants and weeds. Dig a hole in this corner that is 1.5 yards deep and big enough to fit a 5 gallon bucket. Lay plastic sheet over area. Make sure it is 6" longer than the need area on all sides and big enough to overlap water collection device. Put perforated drain field pipe in sock and then in system. Replace dirt and plant the plants. They should get 5 gallons of water per week. The water will be recycled aside from the initial 5 gallons of fresh water. Monitor water input and output of the system. After the conclusion of the experiment, the researcher found that the system reclaimed about 60% of water put into the system, proving the hypothesis correct and answering the initial question.<br><br>

A STUDY OF THE EFFECT OF ANTIREFLECTIVE COATING ON SOLAR CELL USE
Iheoma Uchanma Umez-Eronini
Benjamin Banneker Academic High School, Washington DC, USA

This project tests the effects of antireflective coatings (ARC) 203As and 512b on silicon based solar cells. Initially the idea was to coat two bare silicon based solar cells with the two distinct antireflective coatings, and evaluate the ARC’s performance on the basis of electrical efficiency of the two cells. However, the criteria of uniformity, consistency, and thickness were also imposed on the antireflective coatings in this work. <br><br>Wafers of GaAs were prepared using standard RCA cleaning procedures, and antireflective coatings 203As and 512b were spun onto the wafers at 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000rpm (revolutions per minute). The coatings were cured and cooled and thickness and uniformity of the coatings were measured using an ellipsometer. Based on the coating criteria previously defined, it was determined that 203As spun at 3000rpm was the coating best suited for ARC applications on bare silicon solar cells.<br><br> A comparative evaluation of the electrical efficiency of a bare silicon cell, a manufacturer proprietary-ARC silicon solar cell and a 203As ARC silicon solar cell was carried out. Measurements of the voltage and current produced by each of the cells when exposed to light from a solar simulator revealed that the 203As ARC solar cell fell short of the manufacturer’s ARC solar cell’s performance, but produced a significant gain over the bare solar cell; the computed efficiency of the three cells (the bare silicon cell, the 203As and the commercial cell) relative to an Air mass 1 solar simulator were 2.54%, 2.83%, and 3.65%, respectively.<br><br>

Palos Verdes Peninsula High School, Rollings Hills Estates, California, USA

Material failure prediction would revolutionize modern engineering. Currently, commercial systems are unable to measure the impact of stress and, most importantly, to predict failure of materials. The ultimate objective of this study is to develop a reliable material failure prediction system by analyzing the characteristics of deformation luminescence (DL) of mechanoluminescent materials under stress.<br><br> Irradiated Lithium Fluoride (LiF) crystals were utilized to observe DL as the material undergoes hysteresis. An Instron testing system was used to compress LiF with various stress, strain, load speed, cycling and time duration variables. A photomultiplier was used to capture photon emission data. Data was collected both manually and with an oscilloscope computer data acquisition system from which mathematical models were derived.<br><br> As LiF was stressed to its elastic limit, DL was found to increase drastically, signaling hysteresis. Under prolonged conditions, DL decayed in various mathematical relations against stress, strain and time duration. Photon emissions increased logarithmically with load speed. Photon emissions were also found to be effective in identifying the presence of internal cracks and denoting the phenomena of fracture. The accumulative total of photons emitted up to fracture remained relatively constant even under radically different stress regimens.<br><br> DL was found to be an innovative and superior method of indicating material hysteresis. A novel method for predicting material failure was suggested by utilizing accumulative photon counts. The findings in this study directly apply to plastics, ceramics and other non-conductive, transparent materials, potentially resulting in safer and more economic vehicles, machines and structures.<br><br><br><br>

STEM CELL TISSUE ENGINEERING WITH A NANOWIRE-HYDROGEL MATRIX
Mitali Thakor
River Hill High School, Clarksville MD, United States of America

This work describes the engineering of a novel nanowire-hydrogel matrix to support the growth of mesenchymal stem cells. Currently, insufficient mechanical properties have seriously limited the use of hydrogels for load-bearing tissue applications such as bone or cartilage. It was hypothesized that nanowires could be magnetically aligned along horizontal field lines by external magnetization during photogelation of the polymer, in order to maximize the strength of the composite. <br><br> The nanowires used here are ferromagnetic nickel wires (d=350 nm, L=35 microns) fabricated by electrochemical deposition. Stem cells and nanowires were encapsulated within a Poly (ethylene oxide) Diacrylate hydrogel polymer under magnetic fields of B=25 G. Comparative mechanical compression strength experiments with a motorized tensiometer found that hydrogels with nanowires required significantly increased force of compression, indicating strengthening of the composite. <br><br> Future directions include in vivo analyses of nanowire-hydrogel matrix biocompatibility as well as nanowire effects on stem cell differentiation. This research has long-term applications in tissue engineering of bone, cartilage, and connective tissue.

BIFURCATION OF OIL-WATER EMULSIONS USING ELECTROSTATIC FORCES - YEAR 2
Leanne Louise Thompson
Bishop Kenny High School, Jacksonville, FL, United States

The purpose of this product is to determine if different shaped electrodes affect the clarity of the separated emulsion and the time it takes to get there. <br><br> <br><br>The project's engineering goal is to discover the best electrode shape that is the most effective in separating oil-water emulsions. <br><br> <br><br>Results were found by lowering three different shaped probes into an emulsion at different times and observing the purity of the oil that is separated every two minutes using a microscope. These results showed that the circular probe was the most effective in separating the emulsions but all three of them were very similar in the purity of the oil. <br><br> <br><br>In conclusion it can be determined that out of a triangle probe, circle probe, and square probe the circle probe will be the most effective in separating an oil-water emulsion.

FACTORS AFFECTING COOPERATIVE ROBOTIC BEHAVIOR YEAR 2
Donald Eng
Stanton College Preparatory School, Jacksonville, Florida, USA

The purpose of this experiment is to determine, isolate, and manipulate the factors that directly affect a robotic community’s efficiency in terms of how quickly a task can be performed. By controlling these variables, various behaviors can be created for a single robot and/or the entire community. This is illustrated through simple and complex cooperative robotic behaviors.<br><br>The robots are structured as Objects (or instances of a class module) in Visual Basic to simulate “independence.” A main program calls on the robots to perform various functions and the robots utilize the main program as a “server” to query information about their peers from an ActiveX control written in Visual C++. An image analysis program identifies the location of the entities playing on the field and the behavior control component uses the ActiveX control as a sensor to monitor the robots’ information as a method of deriving the next course of action.<br><br>Analysis of the given problem for the robots to “solve,” involves manipulating a collision avoidance algorithm to control the robots’ “aggression” and manipulating the layered programming of the behavior control component to provide a basis for expending the complexity of the problem. Independent variables in the higher level functions of the robots (dodging opponents and seeking a target) as opposed to lower level functions (rotation and translation forward and back), establish a higher level of scalability for the system demonstrated by the endless complexity of the problem solving algorithms.<br><br> Understanding the factors that affect cooperative robotics extends the reach of simple problems taking advantage of communication via Artificial Intelligence to the replication of specialized tasks in nature (ant colonies, wolf packs etc).<br><br>

THE ROLE OF OXYGEN IN COBALT DOPED TITANIUM OXIDE THIN FILMS
Jeffrey James Marlow
Cherry Creek High School, Englewood, CO, USA

This study aimed to determine the role of oxygen pressure during fabrication in the semiconducting and magnetic properties of cobalt-doped TiO2 thin films. Films were made by reactive co-sputtering of titanium and cobalt onto both silicon and quartz substrates; during this process, oxygen partial pressure varied from 20 to ~80 mTorr. Pressures of less than 75 mTorr resulted in semiconducting properties as determined by resistivity-vs- temperature graphs. Films with pressures of 62 and 41 mTorr demonstrated slightly ferromagnetic activity, with coercivities of ~100 Oe, and saturations of ~0.05 memu. Similar coercivity was found with an oxygen pressure of 20 mTorr, but the saturation increased more than tenfold to ~0.60 memu, which is quite high. Coupled with the retention of semiconducting properties, this elevated magnetization could lead to the development of a practical diluted magnetic semiconducting device for use in quantum computing applications.<br><br>

FACTORS AFFECTING COOPERATIVE ROBOTIC BEHAVIOR - YEAR 3
Donald Stuart Eng
Stanton College Preparatory School, Jacksonville, Florida, USA

The purpose of this experiment is to demonstrate cooperative robotic behavior by developing a robot protocol based on a rudimentary form of distributed intelligence. Applying the factors that affect an individual robot’s behavior to that of a community promotes a higher order of complexity for a multivariable system. <br><br>Each robot is a separate entity rather than an object in an array. The restructuring of the robot driver program shifts the task decomposition from serial procedures more towards a multithreaded process. The robots collect data and commands from a C++ ActiveX control that uses Visual Basic as a user interface. An image analysis program decomposes a field image and streams the appropriate data to the robots. Based on the inherent programming within each robot module (PIC 16F767) and the goal of the system, each robot will utilize its data to evaluate a given problem.<br><br>As the system approaches a pure multithreaded architecture, the cooperative robotic behaviors shift from a “clock maker” set up to more abstract methods of problem solving. Choreographing “dance” routines demonstrates the clock making method of controlling the robots by giving the robots an initial set of rules and a problem to solve or pattern to form. Layered learning then becomes more of a tool than a technique for evaluating problem sets.<br><br>The quantification of multiagent systems requires an understanding of the relevant factors that affect the isolated behavior. Perhaps by replicating the natural organization of societies with robotics, improvements can be made to current systems or new systems can be developed expanding the application of cooperative robotics beyond space exploration and soccer matches.<br><br>

BLOWING IN THE WIND: WHAT SHAPE BLADE SPINS FASTEST?
Jennifer Lane Jemison
West Anchorage High School, Anchorage, Alaska, USA

Some areas of Alaska, like the Aleutian Islands, can benefit from their ample wind supply by using windmills to convert the linear velocity of the wind into either mechanical or electrical energy. I conducted this experiment to discover a blade shape that spins the fastest and therefore gives the windmill the greatest potential output.<br><br>I erected a windmill out of tinker toys with two tandem rotating wheels. The first wheel had four arms that were used with removable test blades. It was oriented toward a fan. The second wheel was used for measuring (one end had a magnet and the other an appropriate counterweight). I mounted the sensor for a bicycle odometer so that it read the magnet when it passed during rotation. I calibrated the odometer for the appropriate circumference. I then cut squares from the same material into various shapes so that each resulting shape had the same surface area. I made four of each shape. I independently mounted and tested each shape with the fan and recorded the results at the same intervals.<br><br>I found the rectangular blades (mounted horizontally) achieved an average of eleven kilometers per hour, followed by the isosceles (long side toward rotor) and the equilateral triangles (9.75 and 9.83 kilometers per hour respectively). The shapes that produced the fastest speeds had the longest horizontal contact with the arm. They offered the least resistance and the least drag. They gave the optimum force at the closest point to the rotor.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF FREE VOLUME DUE TO RELAXATION ON THE AMORPHOUS METAL PD40NI40P20
Wayland Chen
Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, Baltimore, MD

Free volume in an amorphous metal is intricately connected to the density of this type of unique alloy. Relaxation can cause the density of the alloy to increase and therefore decrease the amount of free volume in the metal. This change in the free volume can be assumed to have an effect on the alloy. For this experiment samples of the amorphous metal Pd40Ni40P20 were annealed using a tube furnace to cause the changes in free volume that were required. The samples were put through the vickers microhardness test and results from the annealed and unannealed samples were compared to determine the effect that the change in free volume had on the amorphous metal. The results show that the increased density due to the lowering of free volume in the metal from the relaxation causes an increase in the hardness.

EVALUATING THE USEFULNESS OF CARBON NANOFOAM ELECTRODES AND CARBON NANOTUBE CATALYST SUPPORT IN THE DIRECT METHANOL FUEL CELL
Jordan Andrew Hurwich
John Adams High School; South Bend, IN; United States of America

In recent years, it has become evident that humanity needs a new energy source for the twenty-first century, and the most plausible answer to today's energy problems is the direct methanol fuel cell.<br><br> The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the effectiveness of carbon nanofoam electrodes and carbon nanotube catalyst support in the direct methanol fuel cell. The investigation focused on variables including molarity of methanol, cell temperature, methanol flow rate, Teflon-loading, and variable catalyst loading.<br><br> It was hypothesized that fuel cells equipped with carbon nanofoam electrodes would produce more total power output and greater power densities than standard, stainless steel equipped cells. This hypothesis was upheld under most conditions. In the first phase, the effect of methanol molarity on cell performance was investigated, and at every molarity except 0.5M, the nanofoam cell outperformed the standard cell. Next, temperature was investigated, and the nanofoam cell outperformed the standard cell at every temperature. Third, flow rate was evaluated. In this study as well, the hypothesis was supported. In the fourth phase of this study, the effect of Teflon loading was investigated with results upheld the hypothesis. In the final stage of the nanofoam study, platinum loading was investigated. The catalyst was deposited by the Argon Sputter, and in this phase the nanofoam equipped cell was able to outperform the standard cell. The next study involved the use of carbon nanotubes as a catalyst support in the DMFC. The hypothesis that the altered cell would produce greater power output and power density was upheld.<br><br> From this investigation, it was concluded that carbon nanofoam electrodes and carbon nanotube catalyst support are effective means to increase fuel cell power output and power density in the direct methanol fuel cell under many conditions.<br><br>

FUEL CELL SYSTEM USING HYDROGEN FROM AQUEOUS SODIUM BOROHYDRIDE SOLUTION FOR PORTABLE COMMUNICATION APPLICATIONS
Shengbo Xu
Hamilton High School, Chandler, AZ, USA

A new fuel cell system has been tested that incorporates two new components for portable communication applications. The first is an aqueous compound, sodium borohydride, that releases hydrogen through catalysis by ruthenium. It is safer than other storage methods and has a greater energy density than other energy storage mediums including hydrogen gas. I/V testing was done using a Kiethley Source meter controlled by the Labview program to observe whether the performance of a fuel cell using sodium borohydride is comparable to results obtained from conventional hydrogen gas. The second is a moldable graphite fixture that replaces the poco graphite block commercially used. These fixtures act as a current collector and flow field for the fuel cell. The moldable graphite housing is both cheaper and more portable than the commercial poco graphite one. I/V testing was also done but with a PINE potentiostat to observe whether the performance of a fuel cell using the two types of fixtures differed. Results conclusively demonstrated that sodium borohydride is a comparable alternative hydrogen storage medium to conventional gas tanks. Moreover, moldable graphite is a promising replacement of poco graphite in MEA housings when made through compression molding. This data was analyzed in terms of both efficiency and portability, measured by voltage and power density, respectively. Further avenues of research include development of a sodium borohydride generation reactor, regeneration of sodium borohydride from sodium borate, and ultimately, the integration of the reactor and moldable graphite housing into a portable fuel cell.

THE EFFECTS OF BLADE DESING AND ANGLES ON WIND TURBINE ENERGY PERFORMANCE!
Andrew Charles Schlievert
Algona High, Algona Iowa, United States

Because of the limited and dwindling supply of fossil fuels, scientist now seek an alternative power source that is clean, safe, reliable, and extremely efficient. Wind energy is one of the best answers to solve this problem. Which leads to my investigation to design a better wind turbine and blade for application today. I designed several types of turbines and blades, which includes several conventional windmill blade designs and a new vertical concept turbine blade.<br><br> A design criteria was to construct a state of the art wind tunnel for testing windmill turbines, blade designs, and blade pitch. After construction of my turbines and blades I used a non-contact tachometer, voltmeter, and anemometer to measure my results. After all testing was complete I recorded and analyzed my results.<br><br> Testing results conclude that Bernoulli's principal and airfoil design are one of the most important factors when creating an efficient wind turbine and blade. Based on testing a conclusion can be made that a three-propeller windmill using an airfoil blade with direct inverse design methods applied at a 15-20 degree pitch will optimize the energy and efficiency performance on todays applications.<br><br> Wind energy is a very efficient and clean alternative to the energy problems we face today. Current research is focusing on further testing in attempt to produce more efficient wind turbines.<br><br>

ADAPTIVE AIRFOILS: BETTER THAN EXISTING TECHNOLOGY
Tyler Jason Clark
Salpointe Catholic High School, Tucson Arizona, United States

The purpose of this project is to determine if an aircraft fitted with an adaptive airfoil can outperform the same type of aircraft outfitted with a single airfoil with slats and flaps. To test this, a computer flight model simulation called X-Plane Version 8.32 from Laminar Research was used. Unlike most simulators, instead of giving the performance of an aircraft from preset values, X-Plane uses the geometric shape of the aircraft and then calculates how that aircraft will fly. To gather data, three different types of airfoils (the ATR72SM, NACA0012, and the NACA6409) were each put onto an A-10 Thunderbolt II airframe and then tested in four different tests against a Control A-10. After gathering the data, it was found to support the hypothesis that an adaptive airfoil aircraft has advantages over current technology. This project proves that adaptive airfoil technology is beneficial and worthwhile to develop.

DESIGNING A NEW CARDIOVASCULAR STENT FOR RAPID ENDOTHELIALIZATION
Mark Mohan Mazumder
Little Rock Central High School, Little Rock, AR 72202, USA

An encased cardiovascular stent was developed to minimize restenosis (re-blocking) in stented arteries, which affects nearly 25% of stented patients. In the new design, the wire mesh structure of the stent, made of either stainless steel or Nitinol shape memory alloys, is completely encased by a radially expandable polyurethane (PU) film grafted with polyethylene oxide (PEO) with covalently bonded and embedded antithrombogenic drugs. The goal is to promote the formation of a homogeneous endothelial cell lining with its inherent, long-term defenses against restenosis along the inner wall of the stent. Tensile and SEM tests were carried out to study the radial expansion and the surface structure of the coatings. The stent wires were first coated with conductive polyaniline (PANI) for corrosion prevention. Measured by impedance spectroscopy, the resistance of the PANI-PU-PEO stent coating against corrosion in an artificial physiological solution increased first exponentially then linearly with the coating thickness (95% confidence level) reducing the corrosion rate to under 10 micrometers/year (50 micrometer film thickness). Embedding multiple layers of drug particles at 8 micrometers in diameter within the coating optimizes drug delivery (2mg/stent). Drug incorporation prevents fibrinogen attachment (restnosis precursor) and smooth muscle cell proliferation during endothelialization. Atomic force and epi-fluorescent microscopy were used to study fibrinogen attachment and endothelium confluence. A flow cell was constructed for in-vitro biocompatibility studies of the coating with plasma treatment for surface modification and sterilization. The feasibility studies show that an encased stent with an endothelialized inner wall can effectively prevent restenosis.

UTILIZATION OF NITINOL IN AN ARTIFICIAL LIMB
Nicholas Ahamad Hosein
Torrey Pines High School, San Diego, CA, USA

The main problem faced with creating an artificial limb using Nitinol is the unpredictable nature of the wire under non-ideal conditions. Slight air currents, exposure to light, and variations in room temperature affect the amount of current needed to alter the length of the wire. This problem was solved by using a microcontroller to measure the angle of each joint and changing the current through the wire to compensate for any environmental variations. Another problem was deciding between using an active bias (Nitinol contracts freely) or a constant bias (constant force opposing the contraction) in the artificial limb. Three tests were conducted on the Nitinol. Test one and two were used with an active bias system while test three was used with a constant bias system. The first test determined the percent contraction of the wire as a function of the current. It also determined the superelastic current range, which is used to maintain the limb at a set position. The second test determined how the force of the Nitinol varied with current and therefore the stress range under which the Nitinol safely operates. The third test determined how the bias force affected the percent contraction of the Nitinol. It was also used to predict the results of test one for a constant bias system. Each set of results contributed the data required by the microcontroller to control the Nitinol.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF GRADIENT BASED COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS APPLICATIONS
Robert M. Parrish
George D. Chamberlain High School, Tampa, Florida

The purpose of this project was to develop a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program that used discrete rectangular meshing to accurately predict the airflow around objects such as airfoils in a non-compressible airstream. The CFD used the gradient vectors of the pressure distribution over discrete time-steps to proportionately export each cell’s pressure to neighboring cells. Results from wind tunnel tests using smoke visualization and manometer tests of pressures and gradient fields over a NACA 4407 airfoil were compared to the CFD program output. <br><br> The experiment design involved the construction of a NACA 4407 airfoil, an open two-dimensional wind tunnel and the use of a smoke machine and manometer for flow visualization. Data collection techniques included manometer pressure sensing and smoke streamline testing. Two algorithms, the simple radial distribution and the gradient-based algorithm, were developed in-house using Java to distribute finite scalar pressures in large matrices representing the physical world. <br><br> The output from the CFD programs was convergent to the data collected during the wind tunnel testing and supported the hypothesis which stated that the development of a high resolution CFD program would produce accurate approximations of pressure distributions and particle trajectories around objects as tested against wind tunnel data. The simple radial algorithm produced good predictions of flow, with smooth gradients, generally accurate pressure distributions, rotational flow, and convergent streamlines at low angles of attack, but fails to predict flow separation. The gradient-based algorithm produced more precise predictions, with extremely accurate pressure distributions, gradients, and identification of flow separation. <br><br>

A STUDY OF CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATORS ON A HEXAPOD ROBOT, WITH A VISION RECOGNIT
Vincent Michael Howard
California High School, San Ramon, CA, 94583

A hexapod robot was constructed out of a lightweight polycarbonate with twelve degrees of freedom. The twelve high-torque servos are controlled by a programmed OOPIC. The mechanical spring force feedback and how it affects various walking gaits for a hexapod robot was studied. The use of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) foam legs allows the robot to be flexible in moving over uneven terrain. The robot uses programmed central pattern generators (CPG) to implement various walking. The effectiveness of three different walking gaits was explored: the wave gait, the ripple gait and the tripod gait. Each of these gaits has their advantages and disadvantages.<br><br>In addition, an object recognition system based on an Artificial Retina Chip (ARC) was developed. It is a CMOS chip that was hacked from a Gameboy camera. The chip is controlled and processed with a Mini Robomind (MRM) that is linked to a PC through a Java Graphical Interface (GUI). For the object recognition, the image is converted into a binary image of either black or white, based on a threshold pixel intensity. The image is then broken into a series of sub-features (3 x 3 pixel arrays). Each sub-feature is converted into a 9-bit number, and a spectrum is formed of the number of times a particular sub-feature appears in an image. By matching these spectra, objects can be recognized and identified.

CAN YOU HEAR IT NOW? ...GOOD
David Wayne Counsell
Heritage Christian High School, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States

This comprehensive project included the structural and electronic design, construction, and precise testing of a prototype omni-directional, three-way, full range speaker that utilized sound wave reflection off of aluminum cones. This prototype will conveniently be able to fill a small to normal sized room with rich sound from a single central location. This prototype may also be used as a surround speaker in a home theater system or in combination with informational display.<br><br>After designing and constructing the prototype speaker, it was tested in a professional quality anechoic chamber. The speaker was rotated and tested for a full 360 degrees at thirty-degree intervals. This process tested the speaker’s loudness in decibels for all audible frequencies in hertz. The control group was the speaker’s output results without any rotation, or at zero degrees. These results were then compared to the results of eleven other tested angles for their similarities. I hypothesized that the speaker’s output would be virtually the same from every lateral angle from which it was tested. I also predicted that if there were differences between the test results of each angle, they would be increasingly found in the higher frequencies produced by the speaker.<br><br>The results complemented the purpose of the project precisely. The bass response of the speaker up to 350 hertz was purely consistent throughout all tests; the midrange, from 350 to 2000 hertz, differed by at most two decibels; and the high frequencies, from two to twenty kilohertz, differed by less than six decibels consistently.<br><br>

The purpose of this experiment is to determine what factors directly affect a robotic community’s efficiency, or how quickly a particular task can be accomplished. The task in this situation is moving an object to a specified location. The three major components for the cooperative robotics are navigation, robot control, and behavioral states. By mastering the navigation and robot control, additional behaviors can be developed and utilized in varying applications.<br><br> The robots used an aerial camera to locate each other and the item. The computer grabbed an image from the camera and analyzed the pixels using Visual C++. Then the locations and direction of the robots and the item were exported to Visual Basic where the behavior program controlled the robots using the parallel port. From here various behaviors can be developed. For example, a passive/aggressive set can be experimented in the field with two robots. The two behaviors were also tested in varying situations. For this experiment’s purpose the aggressive robots were more efficient accomplishing the test in much less time then the passive robots. Perhaps given a different set of goals the Passive Robots would be more effective.<br><br>The optimal efficiency rating for a community in a given situation is key to utilizing groups of robots in an environment to perform a task. If not operating at full capacity, there are less advantages of implementing a robot community. By testing new factors, other unique behaviors may emerge.<br><br>

ZERO POLARITY II THE REPLICATION OF A SUPERCONDUCTOR’S DIAMAGNETIC PROPERTIES
Lynwood James Walker
Hahnville High School, Boutte, Louisiana USA

Magnetic levitation is a hot topic in the modern era as many scientist work diligently to unlock the most efficient levels of its design. A Maglev would allow one to travel the globe quicker than ever before, and even to venture out into the bounds of space, without the need for large rockets. Up until now, Superconductors have been implemented for the levitating process, due to their unique diamagnetic properties, which allow for the repulsion of all magnetic poles. The general purpose of my project was to find electronic means for the replication of the diamagnetic property, thus allowing for a more cost efficient and safer manner of Maglev transportation. The device centered on the study of the electron-flow and the “left-hand-rule,” which is the law that states that the direction of the electron-flow through a coil will determine the polarities of the magnet. In my first year study, a prototype was constructed which implemented the use of bipolar hall sensors to regulate the polarity of the magnets, thus proving the electrical device as a valid and efficient manner of levitation. This year, focused more on the process of putting the device into a practical/usable form, that would function as a Maglev. Also, the most efficient track, and aerodynamic transportation designs was tested, and the trains process of work was addressed. This year research takes a much more thorough look at the functions of an electrical-produced diamagnetic track, and produced tremendous findings.

MULTI-TERRAIN NAVIGATING MICRO AIR VEHICLE WITH TAKE-OFF AND LANDING CAPABILITIES
Brian Jonathan Ho
Suncoast High School, Riviera Beach Florida, United States

Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) did not have the ability to take off and land, or navigate on terrain successfully while maintaining control of the aircraft both on the ground and in-flight. A new MAV called the Hamster MAV was developed, created to be able to take off, land and navigate across various types of terrain. Designs were made to create a MAV having two wheels attached to the MAVs wings. The MAV was created through typical MAV creating procedure through laying up carbon fiber and curing it. The wing (Wingspan = 0.241m, Chord length = 0.114m) was laid up with an axel for the attachment of the wheels. The wheels were also laid up with carbon fiber. Major design obstacles included the Center of Gravity (CG) placement and terrain traversing methods and the effect in-flight. The CG was placed under the axel of the MAV to allow a sufficient angle for take off and keeping longitudinal stability while in-flight. Traversing features of thin independent wheels allowed the MAV to steer successfully while having relatively minimal in-flight interference. The wheels were large (radius = 0.095m) to maximize ground speed for take-off and to provide structural stability in landing. The results were: the ability to traverse across multiple types of terrain (grass, concrete, dirt and linoleum); take off with minor problems after take off dealing with stability and control shortly after take off; land successfully; and keeping relatively controllable flight, the only problems found were a lagged flight, and resistance to turn.

NANO-FIBROUS POLY (L LACTIC ACID ) SCAFFOLDS
Jacquelyn A Gold
Spanish River Community High School, Boca Raton, FL. 33496, USA

In this project, I created a biodegradable nano-fibrous matrix within which stem cells might successfully differentiate and multiply. A fibrous Poly (L-Lactic Acid) (PLLA) matrix was chosen because of its structural similarity to collagen (l), a type found in bone marrow. However, in previous published studies, interstices were too small to allow stem cell proliferation. In this project, I created 60-100 um macro-pores throughout a PLLA scaffold by introducing paraffin microspheres of the appropriate diameter into a PLLA matrix. The spheres were then leached out with solvents.<br><br>The microspheres were created by stirring together a mixture of paraffin and Poly(vinyl alcohol)(PVA). By varying the ratio of these two ingredients as well as the stirring speed, paraffin spheres of optimal size (70.06 + 14.81 um) were created. The spheres were drained, rinsed and allowed to dry. A solution of PLLA in pyridine and dioxane was then mixed with the spheres, and the mixture frozen to -70°C. The resultant solid was rinsed with solvents hexane and cyclohexane to remove the paraffin microspheres, leaving macro-pores in their place. The remaining structure was lyophilized, creating the final scaffold.<br><br>Scaffold morphology was analyzed with scanning electron microscopy, confirming a nano-fibrous structure containing macro-pores averaging 70 um, a configuration optimal for stem cell proliferation. It is my hope that future experiments will show that stem cells cultured in this matrix will successfully differentiate into collagen (l) cells. Because of the biodegradable nature of PLLA, the scaffold should gradually disappear, leaving behind viable collagen (l) cells.<br><br>

ELECTROMAGNETIC LIMB
Boris Andres Simmonds
Catholic High School, Huntsville, Alabama, U.S.A.

At the core of my research and experimentation lies the desire to make underwater and/or space construction and exploration safer and more efficient. My first step in fabricating this idea is evaluating the current scenario. Most mechanical movements require what is called pivotal movement. This includes any form of movement achieved by manipulating long, stiff segments that are joined together with smaller, flexible joints. In my project I designed and partially manufactured a limb that is more maneuverable and more easily stored. I invented electromagnetic limb. A generally tubular limb with electromagnets attracting and repelling each other as the prime movers of this limb avoids lots of moving parts and minimizes size. This concept of a tether of electromagnetic links that can move freely in any direction could someday make pivotal movements obsolete. In this science research project a science fiction dream is made into a reality!

STUMP JUMPER PULLEY
Adrian Leo Cahill III
Wetumpka High School, Wetumpka, AL, USA

The purpose of my experiment was to design a Stump Jumper Pulley that would take the blades off of a splined shaft on a bush hog gearbox. I believe this will prove to be a valuable tool, as it will prevent damage to the bush hog when removing the blades. My hypothesis was that I could design and build a device that could perform this task.<br><br> Design: use one piece of channel 30” long and 3/8” thick. There are four support brackets made of steel 8 ½” long bolted to the base using 3 ½” long u-bolts. A plate was welded to the channel for the jack to sit in. Use a 12-ton or stronger jack, preferably a bottle jack. One bow stress support, which is a piece of square steel tubing 30” long, welded inside the channel. These give it support so the frame won’t bend. Use one 6” x 6” wood block cut into four pieces 3” long and ½” wide. Bolt four support pieces together with 1 ½” long bolts with a diameter of ½”. <br><br> Weld the 30” long tubing inside the 30” long channel. Use the four support brackets you bolted together. Take the pieces you cut off the 6” x 6” block and make sure your jack plate fits your jack snugly. Mount it in the center channel. You can now use the pulley. <br><br> My hypothesis was proven correct. I did make a device that could take the blades off of a bush hog easily.<br><br>

AN ELECTRICAL MODEL OF THE TRANSMEMBRANE POTENTIAL OF AXONS IN LOLIGO PEALEI
Tania Sharlin Sierra
Suncoast High School, Riviera Beach, FL, USA

The axons of the squid are a convenient research tool for the field of neurology because of their size and relative simplicity. Loligo Pealei, a species of squid, is an extensively studied marine animal. Its large axons allow experimentation with the goal of uncovering the details of the process of action poential propagation. The chemical exchanges that occur at the membrane cause potentials to build up, thus making the system analogous to electrical circuits. This was the goal of many scientists in the latter part of the twentieth century. Indeed, models for action potential propagation have arisen, especially since the discovery of the Hodgkin-Huxley theory. Because of the increasing amount of research, the success of models is not absolute. This experiment creates an electrical model for axons in Loligo Pealei and compares it to the most recent and accepted models.

ZERO POLARITY III THE REPLICATION OF THE DIAMAGNETIC PROPERTIES OF THE SUPERCONDUCTOR & THE DESTRUCTIVE INTERFERENCE OF GRAVITY WAVES
Lynwood James Walker
Hahnville High School, Boutte, Louisiana, USA

The first stage of my current research focuses on revolutionizing transportation by the removal of the friction force via Maglev transportation. In my search for a frictionless transportation system, one that utilizes the property of a magnetic field to repel like poles, I was able to construct a device with the ability to function as a superconductor in tits diamagnetic properties. In other words, I designed a circuit that repelled both poles of a magnetic, thus acting as a room-temperature superconductor. The second stage focuses even more-so on the properties of the superconductors and magnetism. I will attempt to prove gravity to be a wave by initiating two of the principle features of all waves-constructive and destructive interference. The first portion of this year's research will focus on manipulating the properties of magnetic Iron (Fe) and the second on manipulating the properties of the superconductor. If my theories prove themselves to be correct, the acceleration of gravity will slow down (due to the destructive interference of G-waves), gravity will be proven to be a wave, and the development of an equation to connect all four natural forces of the universe will be possible.

IMPROVING SURGICAL TECHNIQUES THROUGH THE MEASUREMENT AND DISPLAY OF CUTTING FORCES IN VISCERAL
Eric David Rosenberg
Ingenuity Project at Baltimore Polytechnic, Baltimore, Maryland, Unites States

During minimally invasive surgeries, the surgeon’s semi-intuitive abilities are limited. Therefore, the surgeon has an inadequate ability in understanding what visceral tissue is being cut. Likewise, as robot assisted surgeries become more common, the robot does not posses the ability to distinguish between visceral tissues. The primary goal of my project was to create a pair of “smart” scissors that will help the surgeon in distinguishing what type of visceral tissue is being cut in a real-time situation. With a few added non-hindering components, the scissors are able to output data that visually displays the tissue being cut. This will make up for all intuitive senses lost by surgeons, and robot assisted surgeries.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF BLADE DESIGN ON MAXIMUM POWER EFFICIENCY
Harmony Brown
Chandler High School, Chandler, Arizona, United States of America

The purpose of this experiment was to determine which windmill design would produce maximum power. The hypothesis was: if the blade design has the proficiency to both harness various wind speeds and simultaneously overcome drag, then it will produce maximum power due to its ability to optimize wind energy by altering shape. In order to determine the best power-producing windmill, four windmill designs were constructed out of cardstock and then mounted on a DC motor placed atop a tower. The tower was constructed on a plywood board out of dowel rods and craft sticks. A wire was soldered from the motor to a terminal block screwed into the board, which provided a load site. A dual speed fan was placed thirteen and a half inches from the base of the tower, and level with the motor head (approximately 9 1/2 inches). With the fan blowing about 3 meters per second, each design was tested at five resistor loads (1.3, 3, 5.1, 10.2, and 51.7 ohms). A digital voltmeter was used to determine the voltage that was produced. Later, power could be calculated from this data. The relationships between current, voltage, and power were explored in addition to the physical components of each windmill blade. A strobe was used to determine the number of revolutions per minute. Results determined that the traditional windmill produced the most power, thus supporting the hypothesis. This design had the most flexibility and proficiency to overcome drag making it the most efficient.

HOW DOES A VARIABLE SINTERING TEMPERATURE AFFECT STEREOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS IN SOFCS?
David Perry Kundinger
DeLand High School, DeLand, FL,, United States 

The purpose of this project was to determine how variable sintering temperatures affect stereological characteristics in solid oxide fuel cells, and how this characterization change affects the impedance in the fuel cell sample. Finding the most efficient fuel cell (lowest impedance) is the long range goal of this project. It is hypothesized that the fuel cell sample with the greatest area and volume fraction values will have the lowest impedance. It is also hypothesized that the fuel cell with the least volume fraction value will have the lowest tortuosity value. In order to test this hypothesis, a focused ion beam was used to create cross-sectional images from each of the different fuel cell samples. Using these images, the area and volume fraction values of the samples were approximated. Separate images were created in order to determine the tortuosity value of the fuel cell samples. Area fraction and volume fraction values were determined in different sets of fuel cell samples sintered at different temperature, and a correlation was made between the stereological characteristics and the impedance. The experiment showed that the fuel cell sintered at 1100 degrees Celsius had the lowest impedance. The tortuosity was unable to be determined due to the amount of time that it takes to collect data for analysis. The difficulty in collecting data, coupled with the focused ion beam being out of commission for extended periods of time, made the task of determining tortuosity impossible within the scope of this project. Fuel cell technology is a promising solution to the current oil crisis.

THE EFFECTS OF BALANCE TRAINING ON OLDER ADULTS
Christina Nicole Hobson 
Red Mountain High School, Mesa, Arizona, USA

Phase I was an inquiry year of balance control functions using a stationary, hydraulically-driven platform. During Phase II, two portable platforms were designed and fabricated (Proof of Concept and Second Generation). The Second Generation proved to exceed the performance standards of the stationary platform.<br><br>The purpose of the current year’s research, Phase III, was to apply the Second Generation as a balance training tool to an older population (60+ years). The study consisted of two population groups: healthy older adults who had received no balance training prior to the study and older adults who had been in participation of Tai Chi for more than six months. Both populations were tested at the Motor Control and Rehabilitation Lab to evaluate postural control at four different test conditions. The healthy older adults were then trained three times a week for six weeks on the Second Generation. After balance training was complete, the healthy older adults were tested again at the lab to assess changes in postural control. For all testing procedures, two types of data were collected: Center of Pressure (CoP) and Electromyogram (EMG). <br><br>The data was statistically analyzed for the eight parameters taken from CoP and EMG data. Significant improvements were found from pre- to post-training. The results indicate that after balance training, the healthy older adults had less variability in postural responses for all test conditions and a finer control of postural movement at faster test conditions (2.6 and 3.0). Post-balance training data versus Tai Chi data show marginal difference. <br><br> <br><br>

SELF-ASSEMBLING MICROCONTAINERS FOR ON-DEMAND RELEASE OF CHEMICAL AGENTS
Emma Kathryn Call
Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, Baltimore, MD, USA

Recently, technological advances in the field of micro/nanotechnology have created a pathway for the advancement of biomedical devices on the microscale. My current research focuses on the creation of metallic microcontainers for use in the fields of chemical engineering, biomolecular engineering, and medicine. By using a series of microfabrication techniques (including photolithography, electrodeposition, and metal etching), in combination with surface-tension driven self-assembly, I have shown the fabrication of “dust-like” microcontainers ranging in size from 50 microns to 200 microns. These microcontainers are ideal for a range of applications, including remote release, due to many advantageous attributes. These attributes include: a large surface area to volume ratio, which maximizes interactions with the surrounding environment; a metallic structure, which allows for non-invasive tracking and remote heating using radio frequency fields; and a finite volume for the encapsulation of various substances, such as cells, gels, and polymers. To date, I have shown the fabrication of a variety of microcontainers with different shapes and pore sizes, the loading of these structures, and the release of a chemical upon conductive and inductive heating. In the future, I would like to investigate the potential of surface modification for the integration of a radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag, and also investigate the potential of in vivo release.

CHORDING GLOVE: A NOVEL ALTERNATIVE TO TEXT ENTRY IN BLUETOOTH ENABLED PERIPHERAL DEVICES
Evan Takashi Morikawa
High Tech High, San Diego, CA, USA

As the world trends towards a time when portable computing devices are miniaturized to the point where they become wearable, efficient human interface with these electronics becomes more difficult. The “qwerty” keyboard, while standard in the consumer market, is inherently large, inefficient, awkward, and not suitable for miniaturized electronics. A solution to this problem exists within single handed chording technology as a method of efficiently and portably entering text into peripherals. A chording device generates text through the striking of a combination of keys simultaneously; much like the chords that are played on a piano.<br><br> This project demonstrates the effectiveness of this technology when placed on the fingertips of a wearable, portable glove. Through the Human Interface Device (HID) profile of the wireless Bluetooth stack, the device transmits the interpreted text input commands wirelessly to any HID Bluetooth enabled peripheral device such as a personal digital assistant (PDA) or cell phone. Due to the compact nature and high level of efficiency constructed into the device, it has the potential to exceed input speeds exhibited with current portable input methods such as cell phone keypad entry and PDA graffiti; thereby making it a viable alternative for text entry in the consumer markets as well as for applications from the military to disabled persons.

A COLLABORATIVE FRAMEWORK TO ENHANCE CAMERA-BASED SECURITY SYSTEMS USING INTELLIGENT WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS
Vinayak Ramesh
Oak Ridge High School, El Dorado Hills, CA, USA

The site council at Oak Ridge High School, California, highlighted how the school's PTZ camera-based security system was unable to provide adequate security coverage on campus. Addition of more cameras was very expensive. This prompted the idea to build an innovative and cost effective system to enhance the existing security system. <br><br> The approach involves a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), consisting of "motes", to monitor motion around the school. The hypothesis is that the camera-based security system, in collaboration with the WSN system, would increase the number of events recorded. <br><br> The WSN system uses household wireless motion sensors. A transducer was designed to convert motion to light readings. Motes were programmed to detect light readings and transmit the data wirelessly to other motes in the network using a multi-hop scheme. A base mote channels the data to a PC-based data logger which logs events related to motion. <br><br> The experiment was conducted in Oak Ridge High's parking lot, which was monitored by a PTZ camera. Monitored by a 4-node wireless sensor network were two points. A subject was made to run across the areas monitored once every few minutes, 60 times. The camera recorded the subject 7 times; the sensor network, 57 times. The WSN system, working together with the camera, would catch 57/60 events, in the worst case, and 60/60 events, in the best case. This increases the camera's hit detection rate by 750%. <br><br>

INVESTIGATION OF THE AERODYNAMIC CHARACTERISTICS AND AIRFLOW PATTERNS OF BLENDED-WING-BODY AIRCRAFT WITH CHANGES OF THE INBOARD AND OUTBOARD WING PANEL SWEEP ANGLES
Amir Mehmedagic
John Adams, South Bend, Indiana 46615, USA

Due to increasing commercial air travel researchers have been looking for an airfoil configurations that will enable more passengers to be transported while using minimal air space and without exceeding regulations or airport capacity. Using the B-2 bomber, which has been used militarily for years, and other previous research Boeing and NASA created the Blended-Wing-Body (BWB) concept. The revolutionary design is not only more practical, but it is also much more economical because of better aerodynamic characteristics. The basis for the design of the prototype models came from much research not only by the two large companies, but also by joint cooperation with many universities. While there has yet to be a full scale model, Boeing has stated that they expect to have the BWB aircraft in use by 2030. <br><br>This investigation utilizes a KELWIND II-Tech 21 wind tunnel, which has an 8" X 8" X 12" test chamber. Due to the location of the tunnel in the room, the air intake and exhaust are facilitated using fans to direct the air in and out of the wind tunnel. Lift and drag were measured with the KelSensorTM Lift & Drag, and Airflow patterns were recorded using a UL Fogger 1000TM by NESS for all flow visualizations. Angles of attack at which stall occured were also investigated. Tests were conducted through the full range of the wind tunnel air speeds, and at angles of attack ranging from -10o to 20o in ten-degree increments. The twelve airfoils have inboard wing sweep ranging from 55o to 70o and outboard wing sweep ranging from 25o to 35o.<br><br>Results showed that model C1 had largest lift and drag ratio, which supported my original hypothesis; furthermore, all of the Blended-Wing-Body models performed better than the conventional wings. Airflow patterns, tested with the fog machine, furthermore support the results by showing best airflow over the Blended-Wing-Body models.<br><br>

CHARACTERIZING THE STRUCTURAL STABILITY OF MODEL BUILDINGS THROUGH THE USE OF A BIAXIAL SHAKER FOR THE PURPOSE OF STRUCTURAL OPTIMIZATION – PHASE 3
Jonathan Brooks Bell
R. Nelson Snider High School, Fort Wayne, IN, the United States of America

Year one and two focused on the design and development of shaker tables using acoustical technology. A single axis and biaxial shaker tables using mono and stereo waveforms were designed.<br><br>This year, I used the biaxial shaker table to characterize the structural stability of model buildings during an earthquake. Accelerometers were placed on the buildings allowing for both the horizontal and vertical accelerations of the buildings to be measured. They were also used to measure the buildings output response to an input stimulus for the derivation of a building’s transfer function. A set of experiments was used to determine the structural stability of single and multistory model buildings of varying mass and stiffness. Knowing this information a building’s transfer function can be derived which would allow for a building’s design to be optimized in regards to its motion during an earthquake.<br><br>I also performed a design of experiments (ANOVA) using the Taguchi method which allowed for the determination of the optimal configuration of a model building in regards to its mass, stiffness, damping, and foundation material as control factors. Five earthquake stereo waveforms were used in this experimentation as noise factors. The optimal design in terms of peak horizontal acceleration was the 1/8” dowel rod building with two units of additional mass, two MR (magneto-rheological) fluid dampers, and a foundation set in sand. This design had the smallest peak horizontal acceleration.

THE EFFECT OF HOLE ORIENTATION ON PARACHUTE DRAG
Stephen Gabriel Welty
Northside College Preparatory High School, Chicago, IL, USA

This experiment was designed to investigate the effects of escape hole orientation on the amount and spread of drag created by a parachute. The experiment gathered drag data for parachutes with 1, 3, and 5 escape holes. There were two different hole orientations for parachutes with 3 and 5 holes (with and without a center hole). An additional parachute was used to investigate the drag produced by a parachute with no holes.<br><br> The purpose was tested by hooking each parachute to a force sensor connected to a data collection program. This was set up in a wind tunnel. For each of two trials for each parachute, the wind tunnel fan ran for two minutes, and the force sensor recorded drag data once each second. <br><br> The data are inconclusive, because statistical tests show that the behavior of most parachutes was not similar between the two runs. In many cases, these analyses showed that the means and variances for the first run of a parachute were inconsistent with those of the second run. Therefore, it is impossible to confirm any variations in performance between different parachutes. It is possible that the wind tunnel failed to adequately control air flow around the parachute or that the velocity of the air may not have been constant enough.

SOLAR-HYDROGEN VEHICLE: HYDROGEN POWERED INTERNAL COMBUTION ENGINE TRUCK EQUIPPED WITH A DETACHABLE SOLAR-HYDROGEN PRODUCTION POD
Soroush Farzin
Central High School, Phoenix, AZ, U.S.A.

This project, to make an environmentally cleaner transportation vehicle, was motivated by the threats to our health and biosphere due to automobile-related pollutants. The hypothesis was that an internal combustion vehicle could be powered by hydrogen, which could be created onboard the vehicle from water and sunlight. One goal of this project was to design and build a hydrogen-powered vehicle. A second goal of this project was to create a hydrogen production unit, which would be powered by photovoltaic cells and could be either mounted on the vehicle or detached to be used as a separate and stationary unit. The basic components of this system included electrolysis cells, solar panels, a hydrogen purifying system and a storage system, all of which were mounted on a vehicle with an internal combustion engine that was modified to run on hydrogen. During the period from May 2003 to May 2004, a new electrolysis unit was assembled and connected to photovoltaic cells; various components such as float valves were designed, built and tested. A hydrogen storage system was also designed and tested. Also, a 1998 Chevy S-10 pickup truck was purchased, and the engine was rebuilt, modified to run on hydrogen, and tested. Another accomplishment of this project was to create a comprehensive research document, which would enable others to use solar energy to produce hydrogen and convert their vehicles to run on hydrogen. Finally, research was conducted on various fossil fuel and alternative energy issues and included in the project report.

SELF-POWERED PROSTHETICS THE UTILIZATION OF FARADAY'S LAW OF ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION
Thomas Shaw
Monta Vista High School, Cupertino CA, United States

Powered prosthetics are constrained by the periodic need to recharge its internal power source. The goal of the project was to find a solution to negate this necessity, specifically through the incorporation of Faraday’s Law of Electromagnetic Induction. By placing a magnet-coil system on a set of opposing springs, it was theorized that the effect could be amplified with minimal user effort. The purpose of the project was to determine if such a setup would serve as a viable alternative energy source for a powered prosthetic.<br><br> The process envisioned was simple: the natural motion of a leg stepping up and down would be harnessed to provide energy for another step. From preliminary experimentations with Faraday set-ups already available, a generator unit was designed, constructed, and tested until a reliable source of power could be attained. Measurements of energy output while the unit was in operation were then compared to the energy usage for similar motions from a model prosthetic leg built and programmed by the finalist. The unit, as well as the program code dictating knee movement, were constantly revised and retested to maximize energy efficiency.<br><br> Analysis of data collected indicated that in low-power environments, the generator unit was able to provide enough energy with each step to furnish power for the next step and still offset inevitable energy loss. While the challenge of scaling up the design to support a high-power system still remains, the project has proven there is indeed potential in this theory and should be pursued.<br><br>

MUFFLED RESONANCE
Randall Thomas Huffman
John T. Morgan Academy, Selma AL, United States

The purpose of this project is to produce a muffler that is equal in sound decibels or is quieter than a stock muffler, but produces more horsepower.<br><br> First, I built what I call a megaphone muffler. It is a half inch steel pipe with a sheet of aluminum shaped like a cone. At the end of the cone is a bowl connected with a bolt and spring which allows back pressure to escape and the sound wave to be reflected back in.<br><br> I recorded the sound decibels of each muffler at 500rpm's and 3500rpm's with a sound level meter at one meter away. Then I tested the horsepower with the oscilloscope and by what I call the pull test where the go-kart pulled 235lbs. of weight.<br><br> Of these two mufflers I tested, the megaphone was quieter at 500rpm's and the same at 3500rpm's. After I did all the calculations the megaphone muffler was the best all around since it had the same sound level at wide open throttle, but produced an average of .21 more horsepower than the stock muffler which repesents a gain of 32.6% increase over the stock muffler.

OPTIMIZING A FAST NEUTRON GAMMA-INSENSITIVE CONTINUOUS OPERATION TENSION METASTABLE FLUID DETECTOR
Alexander Robert Hagen
Lafayette Jefferson High School, Lafayette, Indiana, United States

Radiation Detection is a useful field, with several applications in several fields, including militaristic operations, national safety, and space technology. Existing Fast Neutron Detectors have several fundamental errors. They are very expensive, sensitive to gamma radiation or cannot work in a high gamma environment, or create their own radiation through an acceleration source. Dr. Taleyarkhan and Joe Lapinskas are currently working with a model to detect fast neutrons using sonoluminescent fusion principals.<br><br> Sonoluminescent fusion is often called bubble fusion and happens in the implosion of bubbles. Using these principals, it has been found that bubbles will occur in a tensioned liquid when a radiation source is near. The setup for this includes a glass container with glass inserts, acetone, and a piezoelectric transducer. The cavitations (bubbles) happen only in areas of high pressure when the source is near. To make this technology applicable, a detector must be found that has a high area of pressure above that cavitation threshold (20 bars). <br><br> Using ComSol 3.1, a multiphysics modeling program, small changes to the design of the chamber were made and tested for optimum percentage of volume at a pressure above that cavitation threshold. <br><br> Results indicate several things. First and foremost, the chamber yields similar results for all sizes if the proportion is kept the same. Other interesting results are found that when the inserts are changed in size, the percentage of volume above that cavitation threshold can increase up to ~44%. When the glass inserts were removed entirely, the affected area climbed to ~50%. These results are very promising, and as research is continuing, hopefully they can be used to better the setup. <br><br> For continuation, more tests will be done with the glass inserts removed, and possible with disk and not ring piezoelectric elements. There are some design questions also being posed, such as strain on the glass, and how to detect the bubbles being formed in the container. <br><br>

AN EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS OF THE THRUST PRODUCED BY AN ORNITHOPTER AT LOW REYNOLDS NUMBERS
Anjaney Pramod Kottapalli
Lynbrook High School, San Jose, CA, USA

The aeronautical community has begun to focus on lightweight and slow Micro Air Vehicles [MAVs]. One such configuration is an ornithopter in which the propulsion and lift are both derived from flapping wings, similar to a bird. Currently, the only effective means of understanding and improving ornithopter designs is through the testing of models.<br><br> This project investigated the thrust produced by a small scale ornithopter. An important theory that was explored is the Weis-Fogh effect which states that the pulling apart of two wings creates extra thrust over the thrust from each individual wing.<br><br> To perform this experiment, a test vehicle was constructed using Carbon Fiber, Mylar Plastic, and a pager motor. Two configurations were tested. First, a monoplane ornithopter was tested with two, side-by-side wings. Second, a biplane ornithopter was tested with two additional wings (total of four wings) in the same side-by-side configuration. <br><br> The data was analyzed after applying the Reynolds Number [Re] as a leveling factor. The Reynolds Number involves the air viscosity, and the length and velocity of the test vehicle. Using the induced velocity, the Re was calculated to be 3.6 x 10^3 for the monoplane and 6.7 x 10^3 for the biplane; within the same range as that of a butterfly.<br><br> The Weis-Fogh effect was validated in this experiment by showing it was significantly adding thrust (66% of the monoplane ornithopter thrust). The results suggest that the Weis-Fogh effect occurs inconsistently around certain flapping frequencies. I would like to further research this curiosity.<br><br><br><br>

USING ROBOTICS TO TEST MECHANICAL ADVANTAGES AND WIRE GAUGES IN ELECTRICAL CIRCUTS A SECOND YEAR CONTINUATION PROJECT
Brian Michael Cherbak
Hanover Central Jr/Sr High School, Cedar Lake, Indiana, United States

The problem being addressed in this robotic engineering project is the design and construction of a robot that will pick up certain items, carry those items to an area where they will be placed in a box, and popping balloons in the box.<br><br> To begin the project, I fabricated and constructed the aluminum chassis. Then, to ensure a straight drive and parallel axes, I drilled precise holes. Double drive axes (two motors per axle, each three volt motors running on 4.5 volts) and swivel front wheels were added for steering simplicity and effectiveness.<br><br> For lifting the arm to place the pieces into the box, I used one six volt K'nex motor connected to a bottom axle. This axle is attached to a top axle with two pulleys. A non-stretch string attaches the two axes and the pulleys provide an approximate mechanical advantage ratio of 10:1.<br><br> Next, I constructed a "fork" (for increased surface area) out of thinner aluminum (because of weight) that is attached to the arm. This is the way that the robot actually collects the pieces: attaching fly paper to all surfaces and sticking the pieces to the fly paper.<br><br> The last step in the construction of the robot was the addition of the electrical components. Four D-cells and three toggle switches are wired inside a control box. Wired to the toggle switches are eighteen-gauge wires that run approximately six feet and connect to the four 3-volt drive motors and the one 6-volt lift motor.<br><br>

MODERN APPLICATIONS OF MICRO-ELECTRONIC-MECHANICAL SYSTEMS (MEMS)
David Michael Strouse
Cherry Creek High School, Greenwood Village Colorado, United States of America

Over the last two years, forty percent of nursing home admissions and the number one cause of injury related deaths among the elderly has been linked to falling. The purpose of this project is to integrate MEMS accelerometers into a communication device in order to create an autonomous “bump and safety alert” device that alerts authorities of an incident and reduces response time in hopes of also reducing severe injury and death.<br><br> A MEMS accelerometer was used in 35 bump tests from a 34” height and under 103lbs. Also, two programs were written in C++ programming language, one to measure impact and the other to interact with the communication device, count down to alert authorities, and actually alert authorities. The two programs were later integrated to function simultaneously.<br><br> The acceleration on the X, Y, and Z axis’ as well as the total acceleration was measured and averaged to find the total acceleration to be +2.19g indicating the calibrated acceleration for a catastrophic impact.<br><br> The applications of this “bump and safety alert” program are immensely diverse ranging from uses with senior citizens, children, and vehicles to soldiers in the field and pillar mining collapses. Further development will hopefully yield a fully autonomous device that could be used and located any where in the world and hopefully save lives.<br><br>

CHARACTERIZATION OF NITI NANOPARTICLES
David Bellamy Miller
Cherry Creek HS, Englewood CO, USA

The goal of this project was to characterize NiTi nanoparticles, and produce a nanofluid capable of being used as a heat-transfer fluid. NiTi is able to undergo a solid-state phase change between austenite and martensite. This is what makes NiTi a shape memory alloy. During the phase change energy is released as the lattice shifts from austenite to martensite. Energy is then absorbed as the lattice recovers back into austenite. The solid-state phase change can therefore be driven by temperature. Little is known about NiTi nanoparticles and this solid-state phase change effect at the nanoscale. The particle size may have an effect on each particles ability to undergo this reorientation. Particle sizing was done using numerous methods to determine if size affects the material’s characteristics. The particles are capable of the phase change as indicated by differential scanning calorimetry, and can be affected by oxidation and heat treatment. The effects of sizing have yet to be determined.

A NOVEL VALVELESS PIEZOELECTRIC MICROPUMP AND ITS CHARACTERISTICS
Yichi Zhang
Dunlap High School, Dunlap, Illinois, The United States

This project developed a new valveless piezoelectric (PZT) micropump with controllable flow rate and direction. A novel flow control device in the pump, named the vicious restrictor (VR), was designed. An in-depth investigation into the characteristics of the pump was conducted to guide the pump development and performance optimization. The structural simplicity, operating reliability, and flow control flexibility of the valveless PZT micropump in this project add to the growing application potentials of micropumps in such fields as medicine, biochemistry, bioengineering, electronics, and aeronautics.<br><br> <br><br> The VR rotations, the angle of the VR edges, the height of the VR edges to the PZT actuator, the voltage, and frequency of electric current were selected as the design variables and operating parameters affecting the pump characteristics. The valveless PZT micropump was operated under each of the above conditions, the pressure differentials were measured, and the pump flow rates were calculated.<br><br> <br><br> The pump was fully functional, and the VR was successful in controlling the flow rate and direction. The pump attained a maximum flow rate of 1.2ml/s and 177Pa pressure differential in both directions at 50V and 70Hz. The flow characteristics vs. pump design and operating parameters were established. The pump flow rate increased with the voltage; it reached a peak value in the frequency range between 60Hz to 80Hz; it increased with the VR edge height to the PZT actuator; the 35 degree angle of the VR edge exhibited the highest flow rate. <br><br><br><br>

DEVELOPMENT OF A HUMAN EXOSKELETON: PHASE II
Ian Michael Bouligny
Catholic High School, New Iberia, Louisiana, USA

The purpose of this project was to design and build a mechanical unit (Exoskeleton) to enhance the strength and endurance of physically handicapped individuals. Before the exoskeleton could be constructed, proper measurements had to be taken. To acheive this goal, a measuring device was designed and constructed to transmit information from a self-designed and constructed "Electronic Protractor" to a computer. Data collected was used to build two pairs of joints for knee and hip motion. A "backpack" containing the control system was designed and constructed consisting of a single aluminum sheet along with two arches for shoulder support. The actual control system was made using relays, actuators, and microswitches. The relays were used to control the direction of the actuators, and the microswitches were used to restrict the rotation of the flexible shaft. The flexible shaft transmitted torque to a clamp screw which permitted the joints to tighten and pivot. <br><br>Data was collected by comparing natural to exoskeleton augmented movement. It was shown that similar motion existed in periods, velocities, and walk cycles. The exoskeleton, despite its mechanical imperfections, proved successful. Furthur development and enhancement for biomedical engineering and possible military applications (extra load carrying) were indicated.

MEGA MUFFLER
Matthew Boman Johnson
Autauga Academy, Prattville, AL USA

The purpose is to build a muffler for a gasoline engine that will reduce sound output, when compared to a commercial muffler, while increasing horse power. <br><br> The design procedure was based on the theory of expansion chamber, sound absorbing material, elliptical sound reflectors and a straight pipe to straighten the flow and create a pulling effect on the exhaust gasses. The muffler was designed with a straight path for gas flow in order to increase power. <br><br> Tests were performed on three types of mufflers: (1) straight-pipe (SP); (2) commercial muffler (CM) and (3) Mega Muffler (MM) for sound and power output utilizing a go-cart engine. The sound tests were performed with the engine running at (1) Idle and (2) at Wide-Open Throttle. The sound generated was measured via a microphone and computer program. The power test was performed by pulling a measured load through a measured distance while measuring the elapsed time. <br><br> The data collected from the sound test are as follows: Idle Test: SP = 104 decibels; CM = 93 decibels and MM = 91 decibels. Wide-Open Throttle test: SP = 110 decibels; CM = 103 decibels and MM = 95 decibels. The data collected from the power test are as follows: SP = .6655 horsepower; CM = .5823 horsepower and MM = .6900 horsepower. <br><br> The data indicated that the Mega Muffler design allowed for additional power output while reducing sound. <br><br>

TAILGATE UP OR TAILGATE DOWN? BUSTING THE MYTH
Mary Siobhan Gallagher
Savannah Country Day School, Savannah, Ga, USA

Pickup trucks have been said to share their aerodynamic design with a brick, so it is no surprise that they get the worst miles per gallon of all automobiles on the road. But just a slight change in a pickup truck’s design can significantly improve its aerodynamics, save the consumer money on gas, reduce pollution, and minimize the country’s dependency on foreign oil. <br><br> The drag of a 1/24 scale model F-150 pickup truck was tested in a wind tunnel with a drag and lift balance. Seven different configurations were tested to determine the effect on drag. Configurations tested include: tailgate up, tailgate down, tonneau cover, tool box, side wall extensions, a short fairing, and a long fairing. Flow visualization of the air flow over the pickup truck bed was accomplished with a fog generator and a reservoir. <br><br> The results show that the short fairing was the best configuration for reducing drag, and that tailgate up reduced drag by eleven percent when compared to tailgate down. But the best, most practical configuration that reduced drag was the side wall extensions.<br><br> This configuration is simple and could save truck owners nearly $2,300 over its lifetime if they switched from tailgate down to the side wall fairings with tailgate up. If this were adopted by everyone who had a pickup truck, a billion gallons of gas could be saved every year, therefore reducing our dependency on foreign oil, eliminate a significant amount of pollution, and save the consumer money at the gas pump. <br><br>

OPERATOR INJURY MITIGATION USING ELECTRONIC SENSING, MECHANICAL BRAKING, AND DECOUPLING DEVICES IN HANDHELD CIRCULAR SAWS
Erin F. Eppard 
Thunderbird High School, Phoenix, Arizona, U.S.A.

The objective of this experiment is to invent a safety feature prototype on circular saws that will minimize injuries to the saw operator by detecting and reacting when a finger, hand, or any other body part comes into contact with the saw blade. <br><br> If a body can safely conduct small amounts of current when on a saw trigger, and a body can complete the circuit to ground when the saw blade is in contact with a body part, then an electrical touch switch, braking device, and anti-kickback decoupling device can be incorporated to stop the saw before severe damage is done to the operator. <br><br> When the saw operator contacts the blade, +15 volts is conducted across his or her body and is detected by a 555 touch switch timer when the voltage is shorted to ground on the saw blade. In result, a +15 volt output from the 555 timer turns off the power to the saw motor through an optoisolator and a TRIAC and signals a solenoid to actuate a caliper braking and blade decoupling mechanism. Ideas for this project were original or from unrelated applications. <br><br> Table 5 and figure 16 show that, when set up properly, the safety modifications reliably stopped the blade when it came in contact with the saw operator. In the testing scenario, detection and reaction time were virtually immediate and the saw inflicted no more than a minor laceration to the finger-simulated conductive object held by the saw operator.

CREATION OF AN EFFICIENT, TIDAL-INFLUENCED MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC GENERATOR FOR COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: A NEW PHASE IN A FOUR YEAR STUDY
Ryan Paul Jones, Eric Anthony Smith
Astronaut High School, Titusville Florida, USA

This project combines prior research conducted by the researchers along with the findings of other researchers to create an efficient Magnetohydrodynmic generator that utilizes tidal movements to produce power. The generator enables extraction of power through the magnetohydrodynamic process. This real-world approach involves construction of a generator to mimic effects of tides through inlet channels; therefore seawater was used as the conductor. This generator makes use of continuous-wall electrodes to maximize the surface area in contact with seawater. The researchers' past MHD projects were reviewed and analyzed further in order to assure the best combination of all variables therefore creating the researchers' most advanced and real-world applicable generator to date. A continuous cycle apparatus was constructed using PVC pipe and plastic tubing employing a water pump to circulate the seawater. Graphite was used for the electrodes based on its noncorrosive properties. A second type of channel was constructed using copper as the electrode, for comparison purposes. Tests from graphite electrodes yielded high voltage, low amperage. Copper tests showed that high amperage was being obtained while low voltage was being produced, due to weak magnetic fields. Tests indicated that as the velocity increased from 7 to 9 mph the power also increased, it was also found that as multiple channels were tied together the power increased, the ANOVA statistical analysis program supported this idea. The data shows that this type of tidal-influenced MHD power generation can be commercially applied when ideal conditions are attained and all limits are eliminated.

THE SYNTHETIC ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT
Shrineel Patel, Chase Moyer, 
Celebration High School, Celebration, FL

Finding a synthetic replacement for the ACL will ultimately allow an athlete to return to his or her sport in minimal time. The purpose of this experiment is to promote research on synthetic anterior cruciate ligaments, to potentially reduce morbidity and pain from ACL graft donor sites, and to reduce the cost of ACL surgeries. The hypothesis for this experiment is that silk, being the most resilient out of Gore-Tex and PTFE coated fiberglass, would be the best synthetic replacement for the anterior cruciate ligament. Three ACLs were constructed for each material. Prior to experimentation, the ACLs were soaked in a phosphate-buffered saline solution heated to 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit to mimic the internal environment of the body. The ACLs were then removed from the solution and immediately mounted onto the universal mechanical testing machine, operated by professionally trained laboratory personnel. The maximum loads were recorded on a computer attached to the machine. The result of this experiment was that the PTFE coated fiberglass yielded the highest maximum load, at 942 Newtons, out of the other two materials. In comparison, the silk yielded a maximum load of 391N and Gore-Tex produced 71N. The results show that the hypothesis should be rejected because the silk did not achieve the highest maximum load. In order to improve this experiment, an effective method would need to be devised for constructing a stronger synthetic ACL that is both above the average maximum load of a biological ACL and 100% compatible with the body.

A ROTARY IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STIRLING CONCEPT
Lauren Ashley Byrd, Stephen Joseph Leotis
Houston County High School, Warner Robins Georgia, United States

Neither Stirling nor rotary engines are as widely used as piston engines, but have many more efficient and productive characteristics. The purpose of this project is to take characteristics from each engine and design a rotary Stirling engine that will produce power. Theoretically, this engine will be smoother, quieter, and more efficient than the common piston engine. <br><br> In order to establish a design for the engine, we researched the Stirling cycle, Stirling engines, rotary engines, and the geometry of their housing. We plotted a hypotrochoid curve into Excel and generated points for the shape of their housing; we completed our design in AutoCAD. We generated a series of performance equations and found that a small amount of torque will be produced at the pre-set temperature and pressure ratio 1:1. Because the motor has three chambers, each with a sealed volume, there is a projected volume ratio of 4:1. Therefore, to maximize efficiency, a 4:1 temperature ratio is required. This ratio calls for a greater than 900 degree temperature difference. At these ratios, at least 220in/lbs of torque will be created. For further study, we will manufacture a motor with equal volume and temperature ratios and determine the amount of power produced.

EFFECT OF IMPACT MODIFIERS ON THE STRENGTH OF VINYL SIDING IN COLD TEMPERATURES
Sharis Nicole Steib, Jordan Duhon, 
St. James Parish Science and Math Academy, Vacherie, LA

The purpose of our experiment is to see how different impact modifiers affect the strength of vinyl siding in cold temperatures. In our experiment we tested three different impact modifiers using a machine called a Dynatup. The three types of impact modifiers that we tested are: Tyrin 2500p, Tryin 3615p, and Acrylic. A Dynatup is a computer operated piece of equipment that puts the siding sample in a -10 degree Celsius temperature, locks it in place using a clamp, and drops a pole with a weight on it that punctures the sample. Using sensors placed in the pole and clamp, the Dynatup measures the amount of force required to break the sample as well as other things. Since we are testing the strength of the siding, we used the formula to find the impact resistance of the siding sample. This formula is the energy to max load/thickness of the sample/4.43 (the conversion factor). After using this formula for all of the samples, acrylic modifier had the largest average in-lb/mm. Originally we thought that Tyrin 2500p would be the strongest; however, after a careful analysis of the results we concluded that Acrylic modifiers are the most effective for strength in cold temperatures.

COMPETITION FOR THE HYDRAULIC CAR LIFT
Stephen Austin Age II, and Justin Bradlee Leibowitz
duPont Manual High School, Louisville, KY, USA

The hydraulic car lift is the most popular kind of device for lifting cars. At the same time, the lift is also one of the most expensive devices ranging between $35,000 and $50,000. The purpose of the project was to design a device that would be able to compete with the hydraulic lift while costing much less. The hypothesis/goal was a device as previously described could be designed through the use of a CADD program. Ideas were first hand-sketched and analyzed. If problems arose early, then a new idea was created and analyzed. The final idea was drawn with a CADD program. The main components of the idea were a worm gear, motor, and two columns. The worm gear and motor were mounted to one another above the loading area for the car. Drive shafts were connected to the worm gear. By doing this, the power from the worm gear was transferred to the rest of the lifting components. Prices were obtained for the final idea and calculations were done to see how much the device would cost, weigh, and lift. The final idea was found to be within the goals and limits set and was thus acceptable to be the Age-Lee Car Lift. Therefore, the hypothesis/goal was partially met; a device moderately capable of competing with the hydraulic lift was created. It was only moderately capable because the maximum weight capacity of the Age-Lee Car Lift was less than that of a hydraulic floor lift.

THE USE OF AN ELECTROLESS INTERMETALLIC COATING TO REDUCE INFRARED EMISSIVITY AND TEMPERATURE OSCILLATION IN METAL ALLOY SAW BLADES
Gennifer Reid Rubin, Audrey Christine Leasure, 
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, FL

The use of an oscillating saw for cast removal creates a potential for iatrogenic injury and patient discomfort. Burns and abrasions can occur from the heat created byfrictional forces and direct blade contact. The purpose of this project is to create a friction resistant, wear resistant, and less detrimental saw blade by application of an intermetallic coating. Hard chromium coatings have previously been used for a similar purpose, but the creation of this coating involves direct contact with carcinogens, thus a different coating was needed. Previous coatings were efficient in heat resistance, but could not gain the hardness levels of hard chromium. This experiment aimed to create a more efficient coating, comprised of nickel, cobalt, boron, and phosphorus. The addition of this coating creates columnar grains and a nodular surface, reducing surface-to-surface contact and thus friction significantly. This coating was applied to a standard stainless steel saw blade by a controlled autocatalytic reaction and was tested using a cast removal saw against an uncoated stainless steel blade on an identical cast saw. Two identical 6-ply casts were created for the blades to be tested on. The data showed that the coated saw blade decreased temperatures and infrared emissivity by 75% compared to the standard stainless steel blade. This coating can be applied to multiple other industries, such as food processing, automotives, oil and gas, and military weapons.

THE POOR MAN'S CAMERA DOLLY
Nick Andrew Colbert, Neil James
Christian Academy of Louisville; Louisville, KY; United States of America

The idea for this project was proposed based on the interest in the process of filmmaking as well as the desire to produce a low cost alternative to what major Hollywood producers use each day. The question for this project was “At what speed must one run a low cost camera dolly in order to obtain a consistent steadiness, based on maximum speed and stability?” The hypothesis was that the low cost camera dolly, when tested for maximum speed and stability, would yield a moving picture that has an average displacement of 1 pixel at 1.009 m/s and under, an average of 2 pixels at 1.01 m/s to 1.02 m/s, and an average of 4 pixels in trials 1.03 m/s and over. The experiment was performed by first of all building a low cost camera dolly for under $100, filming a subject at three different speeds, extracting frames from each of those speeds, and using a computer program comparing the displacement of the object on the y-axis in order to better understand the correlation between speed and stability. The results showed that the dolly doesn’t yield an extremely unsteady picture until it is propelled at 1.03 m/s or more, at which time the average displacement becomes 1.11 pixels, compared to the average displacement of only .72 pixels for those times tested under 1.03 m/s. Therefore, in using a low cost camera dolly, it is best to stay under the speed of 1.03 m/s in order to avoid a shaky picture.

EFFECT OF RUNNER DESIGNS ON POWER AND EFFICIENCY
Lindsey Broadnax, Jodie Wu
Rockdale Magnet School for Science and Technology, Conyers GA, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to design and construct a runner that would generate the maximum amount of electricity in the least amount of time. To begin this task a testing stand was constructed and tested. The starter kit runners, including impeller, double wheel and propeller design were tested. The most efficient and powerful design, which was the double-wheel runner, became the control value, and a new experimental runner was designed and tested. Without set variables, the runner was altered until an exceptional efficiency and power rate was achieved.<br><br> The power of the runners was measured by timing how quickly known weights reached the top bucket, and the efficiency was measured by determining the height the weight reached when given less water and force. Using a pulley system and a set amount of water for each trial, the time recorded was converted to power and the height reached was converted to efficiency. Alterations were made and carefully recorded in order to ensure that all possible variables were accounted for. The data was analyzed using multiple t-tests. The double-wheel runner was found to be the most efficient and most powerful with the propeller design being the least efficient and least powerful. Contributing factors to efficiency and power were the number of blades and perpendicular blade design. <br><br>

SOLAR ENERGY MANAGEMENT SOLAR POWER SYSTEM LOAD CONTROLLER DEVELOPMENT
James Dean Morton, Jonathan Troup
Faith Baptist School, Longmont CO, USA

The purpose of this project was to design a circuit that will help conserve energy within a solar power system. It was hypothesized that a device can be built to manage the loads on a solar system in order to ensure power is available for critical devices powered by the system. A circuit was built in an attempt to achieve this task. The circuit automatically switches loads connected to the system off if the voltage of the source drops below a specified value, and on again if the battery recharges up past that point. These threshold voltages are manually set with a potentiometer. The ability for thresholds to be user defined makes the circuit customizable for a variety of applications. After the thresholds were set, diagnostic tests were run to determine various behaviors of the circuit. The circuit was tested with a solar panel and battery in parallel, as well as with an adjustable power supply. The amount of hysteresis, ON/OFF offset, in each channel of the circuit was measured and recorded. Upon retrieving the test results, the hysteresis feedback segment of the circuit was redesigned to allow for less hysteresis. Several more endurance and functionality tests were run with the circuit with corrected hysteresis. Further improvement to the circuit shows promise that it could be extremely valuable to anyone who uses solar energy or any other form of renewable energy that needs system controls.

LEVITATION REVOLUTION...THE TECHNOLOGY OF TOMORROW, TODAY
Aaron Christopher Scruggs, Kristen N. Kearney, 
Russellville High School, Russellville, AR

This project explored the possible use of magnetic repulsion to levitate and easily move objects. The resultant technology could greatly reduce the effort required to transport materials. The basic concept was that the magnetic repelling force of a combination of permanent magnets and electromagnets could be employed to provide levitation and motive force.<br><br> Hand constructed electromagnets and Neodymium super magnets were employed to explore possible methods to generate a stable levitation field. Multiple configurations were tested in order to find the most suitable lift platform. The rotational force associated with using like magnet poles to produce levitation required the development of a rail system. These rails helped to maintain the position of the platform so that levitation and easy transport would result.<br><br> The stable levitation platform produced with the Neodymium magnets was then enhanced with an under track electromagnet. This additional electromagnetic repulsion produced increased lift and could easily be used to propel the platform (pallet) down the track. Using this successful configuration, a working model was constructed. An additional model was built using a second electromagnet to demonstrate the levitation of a pair of linearly confined Neodyymium button magnets.<br><br> The success of this project in creating stable levitation and movement of a pallet will lead to possible commercial applications. The natural expansion would be to use an under-floor cart fitted with multiple variable power electromagnets. This configuration could be used in the construction of a low emissions automated magnetic warehouse.

EXPERIMENTAL AIRFOIL DESIGN: USE OF THE VENTURI TUBE THROUGH AIRFOIL STRUCTURE--PHASE II: DIAGNOSTIC ANALYSIS OF FLUID MECHANICS
Vivek Paresh Buch, Zachary Hulett
Mills University Studies H.S., Little Rock, AR, USA

The ultimate goal of the project and its continuations is to be able to design an airfoil that decreases basic form drag by minimizing the production of eddies and also the overall drag by producing thrust, all without compromising lift. Phase II of the project is a diagnostic analysis of the fluid mechanics of the experimental airfoil compared to a control airfoil, especially in terms of lift and drag. In the course of testing, a modified airfoil was made in accordance with the results from the first test and retested. The data from the modified experimental airfoil was compared separately from the original. The hypothesis of the original experimental airfoil stated that the lift would be less than that of the control, but the drag would also. The airfoils were designed, built, and tested using proper wind tunnel facilities. The results indicated that lift produced by the experimental airfoil was surprisingly not much less than that of the control, however the drag was much greater. This was concluded to be due to a venturi ratio that was too large and to the lack of a proper structural support. The airfoil was modified using a smaller venturi ratio and a proper structural support and retested. These results indicated that the modifications decreased the amount of lift as expected but also greatly decreased the amount of drag. The drag performance of the modified experimental airfoil was almost exactly the same as the control. These results indicate that though the experimental airfoil is not yet significantly decreasing drag, the process is underway; and a second modification is being designed which is believed will produce the desired results.

THE BAT HAT: AN ECONOMIC AID FOR THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED
Taylor Michael Ducote, Dylan James Ducote
Catholic High School, New Iberia, LA, USA

The purpose of this project was to develop a sensing device (Bat Hat) from inexpensive parts to aid visually impaired persons in the navigation of their environment. <br><br>The basic principle of the design is that sonar sensors using high-frequency sound waves can be used to determine distance. A proposed circuit was developed for the sensing system. It was recreated on a breadboard to verify that it would work and was transferred onto a PC board. The interface parts (switch, volume control knob, and headphone jacks) were mounted into a hardhat. A wire way hole measuring roughly 2.5cm in diameter was cut in front of the hardhat to connect to the sonar sensors, which were mounted onto the exterior of the hat in a metal bracket. The circuit, battery, and jumpers were all connected inside the hat. At each step listed, preliminary tests were performed to find difficulties. The finished product was “put to the test” on subjects in various environments. The final “Bat Hat” senses objects from two feet to ten feet away, by producing a continuously variable tone based on the object’s distance and producing a stereo output based on the object’s position. <br><br>The experimenters were able to create a device to detect objects using inexpensive parts, and the device provides the visually impaired with information about their surroundings “beyond the cane,” and “above the cane,” thus adding to their quality of life. This device will not replace or compete with the cane, but complement it instead. <br><br>

In this project, a computer program was constructed in order to determine the distance that a trebuchet could launch a golf ball. The program was tested using an actual trebuchet. If the program can accurately predict the distance, and the trebuchet can consistently launch the same distance, then the project was a success. The trebuchet was built using three-by-twos to construct two legs, which supported a pin, which spun the arm. The program consisted of expansive physics including the physics of a projectile, the physics of a rotating object, and the physics of a sling. The trebuchet was tested using four different weights, as was the program. The project was a success. The program accurately predicted the distance, and the trebuchet launched a golf ball consistently.

A METHOD FOR FABRICATING MAGNETIC POWDER MICRO MAGNETS
Timothy Robert Joubert, Matthew S. Joubert, 
Satellite High School, Satellite Beach, FL

MEMS technology requires an improvement in fabrication techniques used to produce micro-magnets. Research in "packed powder" magnets which incorporated a rare-earth magnetic powder and wax mixture combined the magnetically superior rare-earth powders in an easily fabricated magnet ranging from 500µm to 5µm across and without the use of remanence inhibiting resins or inks. Previous NdFeB powder magnets proved successful but did not meet expectations hypothesized by calculations. This was due to theoretical air gaps between the 50µm diameter NdFeB particles. To address this, experimentation was conducted combining smaller 20µm SmCo particles to create more solid magnets with and better properties than a pure NdFeB magnet fabricated in this way.<br><br>Experimentation included the fabrication of the magnets with different percentage mixtures of the magnetic powders, along with a 6% wax bonding agent, and their testing in a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The fabrication process involved packing 500µm by 500µm by 320µm trenches in a silicon substrate with the different mixtures. The filled wafers were then placed into a hard baking process that melted the wax particles in the mixtures, hardening the magnetic particles into a single solid magnet. The packed trenches were diced out into individual magnets and tested. The VSM produced hysteresis loops used to evaluate the magnetic attributes of the magnets.<br><br>Upon comparing the hysteresis loops of the three fabricated magnets to a pure NdFeB magnet it was determined that as the NdFeB percentage decreased the remanent flux density would decrease as well but the coercivities were complemented by the presence of more SmCo. The magnet that resembled the NdFeB magnet most was the magnet with the highest percentage of NdFeB, and had the highest values of the successfully fabricated composite magnets.

MSTARS: MEDICAL AND SURGICAL TRAINING WITH AN AUGMENTED REALITY SYSTEM. PHASE II
Alexa Danielle Sider, Neha, Hippalgaonkar
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, Florida, United States of America

Adding virtual objects into a real world environment can provide enhanced vision. Augmented Reality (AR) is one such technique that supplements the every day world with optically superimposed 3-D virtual objects generated using computer graphics. A medical and surgical training system that incorporates AR is the Ultimate Intubation Head (UIH), where doctors can not only see the external anatomy of a mannequin but also the internal anatomy, and are thus able perform a procedure just like they would on a real human body. In positioning the 3D anatomical models accurately on the mannequin, the mandible is considered the reference object, from which other internal organs can also be positioned.<br><br>A key requirement of the virtual organs is that their shape be accurate compared to real organs. A common solution is to change the shape of the organs obtained via medical imaging and adjust their size and shape to match that of the mannequin. In our previous work we presented a method to scale a human mandible from a given size to a target size. Results showed that the scaled virtual model closely matched the real object.<br><br>In phase II of this research, we collected additional data from two medical experts who repeated a localization of anatomical landmarks twice, and we present for the first time an assessment of our scaling method. The mean and the variance of the landmarks positions and the landmarks' distances were computed. Those with an accurate mean-position and low variance were used to register for the first time the virtual and the real mandibles. <br><br>

SIGHT THROUGH SOUND: A SONAR-BASED TACTILE NAVIGATIONAL AIDE FOR THE BLIND AND DEAF-BLIND
Brian Robert Epling, Layson, Matthew Allen
Owensboro High School, Owensboro, KY, USA

The purpose of this project is to create a sonar-based navigational aide for the blind and deaf-blind with a tactile feedback apparatus. The feedback must be felt and not heard because the deaf-blind cannot sense an audible response and the hearing of a blind person is often critical to their navigational skills. Thus, a tactile response would not clutter audible sensory information.<br><br>We chose sonar over radar devices due to its ability to be in use while in motion and its capacity to operate in a variety of environments. Radar forces the user to remain stationary to solicit a logical response, which we determined to be impractical. Using a pre-built sensing device, we designed an apparatus that would interpret the sensor’s output in such a manner that it triggers a vibrating motor, obtained from a broken pager.<br><br>The device senses and responds to obstacles in front of the user at varying ranges. For example, an obstacle two feet away from the user would create far more response than a lesser priority object six feet away. As the user becomes more accustomed to the vibration, he or she will be able to easily differentiate between upcoming and immanent obstacles, thus creating an effective collision detection system.<br><br>The concept of the sonar feedback device uses a sonar sensor to relate range information to a coupling circuit which relays a varied response to a vibrating motor based on distance from an obstacle. Although we didn’t invent sonar, we are creating an innovative application.<br><br>

V.I.P.J.E. VARIABLE INTAKE PULSE JET ENGINE
Robert Scott Behringer, Kyle Joseph Hoffpauir
Catholic High School, New Iberia, Louisiana, United States

This project was designed to increase the throttling range of a patented pulse jet engine by a series of carefully designed and implemented experiments. A stainless steel variable intake jet engine was constructed by the experimenters, and then four tests were conducted on the engine: nozzle length test; fuel port test; fuel efficiency test; and the decibel test. Measurements were taken of maximum and minimum thrust, fuel consumption, and noise levels.<br><br> The nozzle length test was conducted by altering the intake nozzle and its connection to effectively alter its length. The fuel port test was done by altering the point of fuel injection to six different equally spaced fuel injection ports into the combustion chamber. The efficiency test was done by a measurement of fuel burned in fixed units of time. The decibel test was accomplished using a decibel meter at four different distances from the engine.<br><br> By conducting a matrix of the above tests it was possible to optimize the throttling range of the engine over the control by 6.7%.<br><br> Several avenues for future research and application are possible. First, the construction of a more refined (thinner walled) engine could make the engine lighter and therefore more efficient. Because the engine runs at such high temperatures, alternate fuels (cooking oil, other fuels) could conceivably make its operation cost-effective. This modern design of a valve less pulse jet engine turns disadvantages into new defensive opportunities. The engine can be extremely useful in powering unmanned high-speed drone aircraft, especially where stealth is not an issue: since the engine runs so hot, heat seeking missiles would target this aircraft rather than manned vehicles. <br><br>

DO THE CAR'S SPOILER AND THE CAR'S FRONT WING AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF DOWN FORCE PRODUCED BY THE CAR?
Ryan C. Abernethy, Mark Peterson
Lincoln Park Academy, Fort Pierce Florida, United States Of America

The experimenter’s project was to test the amount of down force that a combination of the front wing of a car and the rear wing of a car produced. The experimenters believed that the triangle shaped front wing and the 30-degree spoiler would generate the most down force.<br><br> The experimenters used a wind tunnel constructed out of PVC pipe, a digital scale, and a leaf blower. Two sets of triangle shaped front wings and arch shaped front wings were created. The same was done for 20-degree and 30-degree spoilers. Combinations of these were then created (i.e. Triangle front wing and 20-degree spoiler). The platform was placed on the digital scale, and the leaf blower was turned on. The difference between the original weight and the new weight was recorded and was referred to as down force in grams. This was done 22 times for each combination and the highest and lowest figures were taken away.<br><br> At the end of the experiment, the experimenters found the triangle/20-degree combination produced an average down force of 2.8 grams, the arch/20-degree combination had an average down force of 2.8 grams, the triangle/30-degree combination had an average of 3.8 grams, and the arch/30-degree combination had an average of 2.8 grams. The experimenter’s hypothesis that the triangle shaped front wing and the 30-degree rear wing would produce the most down force proved to be correct. <br><br>

THE EFFECT OF L.A. LOOKS GEL ON HAIR TENSILE STRENGTH OVER TIME
Jimmy Le, Aniket Shah, 
Berkmar High School, Lilburn, GA

The purpose of this experiment is to observe the effects of L.A. Looks 10+ Hair Styling Gel on hair tensile strength over time. It was hypothesized that the hair tensile strength would decrease over time due to the insertion of water created by propylene glycol and glycerin into the hydrogen bonds located in the alpha helices of the hair strands. The procedure begins when one thousand eight hundred hair strands were collected and divided into two groups: one control group without gel and another experimental group with gel. Each group was divided into nine zip-lock bags containing ten strands. Next, the bags were labeled from 8 – 16 hours in one hour increments and left on the table until the labeled time was over. The contraption used to measure the hair tensile strength was composed of a dual range force sensor mounted on a horizontal pole clamped to the vertical pole of a ring stand. Each hair strand was pulled from the bags, tied to the hook of the dual force sensor and pulled by a 200g mass while the dual range force sensor measured the force applied to the hair strand until the hair stand broke. All 10 trials illustrate that the hair styling gel had a negative effect on the hair tensile strength; thus, the hypothesis was concluded to be correct but to what degree was uncertain. Further research found that the keratin amino acids countered the effect of the weak hydrogen bonds, which causes the hair tensile strength to decrease gradually rather than decrease exponentially.

A ROTARY IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STIRLING CONCEPT
Lauren Ashley Byrd, Stephen Leotis
Houston County High School, Warner Robins, GA, USA

In the further development of the Wankel rotary stirling engine, this year’s study incorporated the favorable characteristics with last year’s research. The purpose of our furthered study is to convert a basic Wankel rotary internal combustion engine into a smoother, quieter, and more efficient rotary engine.<br><br> In order to develop our design, we used the housing and rotor from a 12A Mazda Rx-7 Wankel rotary engine and refined the housing to meet the physical demands of the stirling concept. Because the engine has a 9.4:1 compression ratio, the air within the chambers of the housing must be heated to a significant temperature difference for the engine to operate efficiently. In further study, we will continue to research and develop a more efficient, useful engine that will maximize power equal to that of today’s internal combustion engines.<br><br>

TERMINAL BALLISTICS OF HOUSEHOLD STRUCTURES
Mario Alberto Valdez, Martin Lopez, 
Rio Rico High School, Rio Rico, AZ

The current drug cartel war along the US-Mexico border poses a threat to citizens’ lives on both sides of the border. Structural damage from automatic assault rifles has proven fatal and has been well documented in local media. The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether ripstop nylon could either terminate a round’s trajectory or contribute to the structural integrity of the targets.<br><br>The terminal ballistics of hollow-point rounds fired from an AK-47 into cinderblocks, wooden studs attached to drywall, and PVC pipes attached to drywall were determined. All structures were shot with and without the addition of ripstop nylon to the back of the targets. Penetration was determined by measuring how deeply the rounds penetrated the material from the front of the target to the termination of the bullet’s trajectory. <br><br>The addition of ripstop nylon to the targets statistically reduces the level of penetration of all materials. However, cinderblock was the only material that terminates a bullet’s trajectory. Further, the ripstop nylon increases the structural integrity of the cinderblock.<br><br> <br><br>The ripstop nylon decreases bullet penetration and maintains the structural integrity of cinderblock. Practical application of these results can reduce the loss of human life. Citizens in war zones could be better protected with the addition of inexpensive ripstop nylon to the back of cinderblocks during house construction. Could the addition of ripstop nylon during construction help maintain the structural integrity of buildings during earthquakes? Investigation into this question and other potential applications of the data are of the essence to address civil and natural disaster.

EXPERIMENTAL AIRFOIL DESIGN: USE OF THE VENTURI TUBE IN AIRFOIL STRUCTURE-- PHASE 1: OBSERVATIONAL ANALYSIS OF INDUCED DRAG PRODUCTION
Vivek Buch, Zack Hulett
Mills University Studies High School, Little Rock AR, USA

The ultimate goal of this project and its continuations is to be able to design an airfoil that not only decreases drag, but actually produces thrust without compromising lift. The purpose of this phase of the project is an observational analysis of the amount of induced drag produced by the experimental airfoil. The drag was measured by measuring the distance between the trailing edge of the airfoil and the first vortex produced. For the testing of this phase of the project, a wind-tunnel like apparatus called the Vortices Measuring Unit (VMU) was designed and produced. The hypothesis states that the experimental airfoil will produce less drag than the control because of the Venturi tube designed through the structure of the airfoil. The venturi decreases the amount of air splitting at the leading edge therefore increasing the distance between the trailing edge and the first vortex. The distance from trailing edge to first vortex is a sufficient indicator of drag-the more distance between the two, the less drag that is being produced. After mounting the airfoils in the VMU, the behavior of streamers attached to the airfoils were recorded and analyzed using a special frame-by-frame VCR unit. Two different tests were performed. The results indicated that the hypothesis was correct and the experimental airfoil did in fact produce less drag than the control airfoil. However, many interesting secondary observations concerning the behavior of the streamers elude to the desire for further research and testing which is already underway.

PURSUING NANOTECHNOLOGY'S FUTURE IN ENERGY CONVERSION CONVERTING SOLAR ENERGY INTO ELECTRICAL ENERGY BY USING NANOTECHNOLOGY
David James Sauer, Joseph Abayev
Ballard Highschool, Louisville Kentucky, United States of America

The use of nanotechnology in energy conversion could become a revolutionary process in a more energy/cost efficient way to produce electricity. While PV (Photovoltaic) technology has by now been well developed, PEC (Photo-electrochemical) technology has only a fraction of the research; nanostructures have several possible opportunities for exploitation in this field and are also about 10% cheaper than silicon cells when comparing surface area. This research is being conducted to determine which of the two titania nanostructures, nanowires or nanoparticles, is a more photosensitive material that will efficiently be used in photoelectrolysis in the future. Both nanostructures were annealed onto two different titania wires; using each as a working electrode in a Cyclic Voltammetric (C.V.) analysis with no light, visible light, and ultraviolet light. The results have shown that the nanowires were more photosensitive by a good degree; approximately 90% of the applied voltage is needed to start the oxidation reaction, compared to nanoparticles. It would be interesting to know how efficient each nanostructure is in hydrogen generation. As a future study, both nanostructures will be separately dispersed in distilled water and exposed to U.V. light, thereby performing photoelectrolysis.

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS: SORBOTHANE VERSUS NON-NEWTONIAN FLUIDS
David Booth, James Chumbley, 
Saint Xavier High School, Louisville, KY

The purpose of the experiment was to compare Sorbothane and non-newtonian fluids (cornstarch and water). We decided to determine exactly how effective each type of substance was at absorbing shock in various situations and circumstances. The main test that we did was an in-depth bounce test. We dropped six different balls from a height of 8 feet, 6 inches and recorded the bounce height of each ball. We used various thicknesses of Sorbothane and various ratios of non-newtonian fluids. We conducted the tests on three different days and under three different temperatures. We mixed various ratios (1.75:1, 2:1, 2.5:1) of non-newtonian fluids in order to establish whether or not the difference in ratios impacted the results. We established that the non-newtonian fluid absorbed more shock than the Sorbothane. We also established that under certain conditions, the thicker the Sorbothane stack, the less shock the Sorbothane absorbed. After recording the results, we used the coefficient of restitution formula, various potential energy calculations, and amount and percentage absorbed calculations to establish how effective each substance was.

ENGINEERING THERMOREVERSIBLE HYDROGELS FOR CONTROLLED DRUG DELIVERY
Daniel Y. Peng, Elias Lebovits, Naveen Murali
Monta Vista High School, Cupertino, CA

Polymeric hydrogels have gained attention for their use in biomedical drug release due to their protected transport of nutrients and ability to regulate the release of drugs. In our research, we aimed at designing a controllable polymeric drug delivery system. Pluronic® F127 is a thermoreversible tri-block copolymer hydrogel which has been utilized for drug delivery. F127 is a micellar physical gel (i.e. not chemically crosslinked) which is diluted upon introduction into the body, deeming thermal control of drug release from F127 impossible. To overcome this problem, we developed a method to photocrosslink F127 reacted with dimethacrylate and created a permanently stable chemical gel, FDMA. We tested rheological properties of the unmodified F127 under physiological conditions of glucose and saline and demonstrated its sol-gel transition. To investigate the possibility of thermally controlling drug release using FDMA, we photocrosslinked a layer of this gel to a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) substrate bonded to a thermoelectric (TE) module. Gel attachment to the PMMA substrate was shown to withstand a 190µN fluid shear force, higher than that produced by the bloodstream. The spaces in the FDMA hydrogel network can be used to carry a pharmaceutically active payload. In our experiments, we loaded and released folic acid stabilized platinum nanoparticles from the hydrogel. By cooling the sample we were able to increase drug release from the hydrogel by over 50%. We demonstrated that this system was able to target and kill 92% of colon cancer cells after 4 days. We concluded the following from working with our drug delivery system: 1) Glucose had no noticeable effect on gelation while F127 in higher levels of salt required greater cold stimulation by the module to reach gelation. 2) PMMA served as an effective surface for attachment to the module through photocrosslinking. This crosslinked attachment withstood a fluid shear force greater than that produced by the bloodstream. 3) Cooling the FDMA improved the drug release rate by more than 50%, confirming the possibility of thermally regulating micellar release. 4) FDMA-based nanoparticle release produced the greatest cancer cell death. Furthermore, we are currently experimenting with a wireless voltage application system, which a physician could use to remotely control and monitor drug dosage to patients.

THE TESTING OF ZEA MAIZE AND CARICA PAPAYA L. FOR GENETICALLY MODIFIED GENES ON A REAL TIME PCR SYSTEM
Jasmine Gajeton, Jessica Chiang, 
Deer Valley High School, Antioch, CA

This study was undertaken to determine if organic produce has more genetically modified genes than non-organic. Items that are known to have genetically modified genes were collected. The Hawaiian papaya is modified to resist the ring spot virus, which forms blemishes on the papaya and can cause its death. The corn is known to be modified with the bacteria, bacillus thurigensis, which creates protein crystals that are toxic to some insects. <br><br> DNA extractions were performed for each sample. InstaGene was added to the slurry of ground food products to prevent enzymes that degrade DNA. InstaGene removes metal ions, which are cofactors in enzymatic reactions. The slurry was centrifuged so that the resulting supernatant could be taken to make serial dilutions. The non-GMO control was oats, which are known not to contain any GM and so a negative result was expected. The positive control was used for comparison for the unknown food samples, Hawaiian papaya and both of the corn. After running the Real-Time PCR, the Hawaiian papaya tested positive. In contrast, both the non-organic and organic corn had negative results. <br><br> The negative results of the corn products may be due to the specificity of the primers used. The primers used here searched for a variety of genetically modified genes. If the corn was genetically modified, then the primers that we used did not match with the corn. If we had chosen primers specific to the corn products, then we may have seen that it was genetically modified.

BIOMEDICAL APPLICATION OF SHAPE MEMORY POLYMERS
Tracey A Fischer, Leslie R. Dias
Centaurus High School, Lafayette, Colorado

Currently there are several limitations for hip prosthetics. Many of these limitations are caused by the metal alloy materials that are used to make existing prosthetics. Shape Memory Polymer (SMP) Technology allows a material to change size through the process of recalling a maximum shape, thus expanding while retaining its original shape. This technology can be applied to the field of Biomedical Engineering and can specifically be replaced several times within a child’s life, due to constantly growing bones. SMP may be able to alleviate this problem of continuous replacement by allowing the prosthetic to expand as the child grows. It can also require fewer invasive surgical procedures for elderly hip prosthetic patients. This research tests SMP in a prototype of a CAM application. Selection criteria were developed to select the best material for producing a mold. Once the mold is poured, the prosthetic piece will be tested for strength, agility, and durability using a carefully developed method.

DISTAL AND PROXIMAL SEARCH STRATEGIES FOR ROBOTIC PATH RECOVERY
Peter N Sebrechts, Walter Beller-Morales, Sam Wagner
Bethesda Chevy-Chase High School, Bethesda, Maryland, USA

The project compared robotic path-following and path-recovery strategies when using proximal and distal visual sensor information. The goals included developing alternative sensor strategies and examining their usefulness in path following. <br><br> A robot vehicle was designed to move autonomously under control of either a (proximal) light sensor or a (distal) camera. The light sensor algorithm used rapid right and left alternation depending on the presence or absence of light, resulting in movement in a straight line. The camera algorithm turned towards a light region; with no light region, it alternately scanned and moved until it found a path.<br><br> Robot performance time and path completion was tested for each sensor using two randomly generated courses, each with a continuous path and a gap variation. The robot with input from the proximal light sensor followed both continuous courses rapidly, but was unable to complete those with gaps. The robot with distal camera input was much slower but relocated the path once it was lost.<br><br> The light sensor proved to be much faster on the unbroken course. For the gap course, the light sensor was unable to distinguish between the side of a line and its endpoint, resulting in an inability to bridge the gap. The camera was able to relocate the line in all circumstances but took very long to react to changes in its environment due to the substantial lag in processing the visual image. Choice of sensor for robot navigation depends on the specific task and the sensor’s information processing demands.<br><br>

DOES PAPER DESIGNED TO MEET THE AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARD INSTITUTE Z39.48 STANDARD RESIST DAMAGE FROM ULTRA VIOLET LIGHT BETTER THAN PRE-STANDARD PAPER?
Madeline Jean Belflower, Taylor Fleming
Union Grove Highschool, McDonough GA, 30252

The purpose of our experiment was to test acid and non-acid paper to the criteria of Z39.48 Standard policy under UV light. Our experiment took quite a while. We had to cut both types of paper into samples of the same size. Then we weighed each one. Next we stuck the samples in a goggle storage case and turned the UV light on for five minutes. When the timer shut off we tested the paper for flexibility change with a weight and paper clip. We repeated the procedure with five minute intervals and finished with thirty minutes. Our conclusion came out to be that the acid paper became more flexible under the UV light and the non acid became less flexible. Our data charts support this conclusion along with the recordings.

POLARIZATION AND STRESS ANALYSIS OF AIRPLANE WINDOWS
Catherine Gabriella Wrisley, Eling Tsai, Lauren Fischer
Spruce Creek High School, Ormond Beach FL, United States of America

The purpose of this project was to study factors which influence aviation safety and to determine the optimum conditions for flight. It was important to evaluate which shape of airplane windows has the least concentration using a process of stress analysis called photoelasticity. A polariscope was constructed to show the isochromatic bands that appear when a 3-kg weight is added to Lexan plastic strips with six different cut-out shapes. An elliptical shape, circle, square, diamond, two congruent circles, and a circle surrounded by two smaller circles were the tested shapes. The initial hypothesis was that the elliptical shape would have the lowest stress concentration. The hypothesis was proven correct, as the elliptical shape had two isochromatic fringes, or two areas of stress concentration. The circle had three areas of stress concentration, which was the second least stress concentration. Using stress concentration equations, the elliptical shape proved to have a lower maximum stress and gross stress. The other four shapes had more isochromatic fringes, because sharp angles and surface between circles increase the stress concentration. Another very important consideration in flight is vibration. The behavior of a material versus dynamic stress is a critical part of engineering design. Vibration was used to test the shapes and their strength. Airplanes use Lexan plastic often in their windows and this experiment simulated the damage that could be caused by pressure or weight. As millions of people fly every year, this experiment reinforced the use of the elliptical shape of windows used in airplanes.

MEASURING THE LIFT OF AIRFOILS IN A WIND TUNNEL
Jennifer Prew, Adam Foman
Hart County High School, Munfordville, Kentucky, USA

In this project the lift of airfoils was measured in a homemade wind tunnel. First a three-foot by one-foot by one-foot wind tunnel was constructed from plywood. The tunnel also has two parallel observing windows. Next different airfoil designs were made out of one-inch thick exterior Styrofoam insulation connected together by popsicle sticks and covered in aluminum foil. Then the airfoils were tested in the wind tunnel by blowing wind through the wind tunnel with a fan. The lift was measured by marking the position of the airfoil while it was at rest and then measuring the position of the airfoil while in flight at the three different fan speeds. Turbulence was observed during test runs and notes were taken. The more conventional shaped airfoils number 1, 2, and 5 had the best amount of lift and stability.

Brookwood High School, Snellville, GA

The goal of this experiment was to build a cost-effective and functioning gel electrophoresis apparatus for use in almost any situation, but especially for use in classrooms where purchasing professional electrophoresis equipment would not be financially unviable. A single gel electrophoresis system purchased for classroom use would cause approximately $715.19, while a lab-built apparatus would cost $7.73. A system created by students could be used a teaching module to explain the many processes involved in gel electrophoresis. <br><br><br>This experiment was limited in materials to only those found in a basic biotechnology laboratory. A micropipette tip box was modified for use as both a gel casting tray and an electrophoresis chamber. Household batteries and common wire were used as the power source and electrodes. Sample loading dyes and molecular weight markers were run using standard gel electrophoresis procedure. The gels were then examined for evidence of polar movement.<br><br><br>It was found that a cost-effective and functional gel electrophoresis system could be created using common biotechnology materials because evidence of polar movement was present and the system cost 98.9% less than a professional apparatus.

AUTONOMOUS UNDERWATER VEHICLE
Nicholas Dorian Rapp, Tamsen Alicia Drew
Amador Valley High School, Pleasanton CA, United Stated of America

As advancements in robotics expand, machines are being used to complete tasks that would otherwise be impossible. Robotics is an evolving field, with evolving obstacles. As a result we wanted to design a robot that could adapt to a variety of mission objectives. The purpose was to design and build an underwater vehicle that would encompass the following: adaptability to a variety of tasks, energy and size efficiency, and complete autonomy. To accomplish these goals we sought a design that had both hardware and software modularity. This would allow the adaptation of the vehicle to new sensors or other hardware mechanisms and the software needed to implement them. After constructing the vehicle, there was a need for a development environment. To meet this need a land based application was created that monitors the vehicle’s real time values. These variables are key indicators of errors within the platform. Through analysis of this data, necessary changes in hardware and software can be identified and implemented. After many months of debugging, the vehicle was able to perform a series of tasks including, holding a depth, tracking a heading, and following a specified search pattern. The next step was to complete optical recognition software that would enable the submarine to self-navigate. By breaking down camera images the vehicle was able to identify objects in the water and position itself over them With this ability we can complete complex missions involving search and seizure, and object identification; thus completing our objectives.

EFFECTS OF COOLING ABILITY AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF REFRIGERATORS BY USING ALUMINUM TO INCREASE SURFACE AREA OF CONDENSING COILS
Erin Francis Eppard, Lindsey Koril
Thunderbird High School, Phoenix, AZ, United States of America

The target of the experiment was to reduce electricity consumption of refrigerators by adding hollowed out aluminum cans to the condenser coils. We intended to increase the surface area for the heat to dissipate from as well as provide a draft of air through the cans to carry away additional heat. By decreasing the temperature faster, less energy should have been used because refrigerant would be colder before reaching the expansion valve.<br><br> We took temperature readings of the condenser coils and the water in the freezer compartment for cooling ability, and tested the compressor through a multimeter for energy efficiency.<br><br> If aluminum is an effective heat conductor and we use it to increase the surface area of the condensing coils on a refrigerator to dissipate heat faster, then it should increase cooling ability and energy efficiency.<br><br> We attempted to conserve energy by increasing the surface area of the condenser coils with aluminum cans to conduct the heat and then dissipate it by convection. <br><br> Figure 1 shows that less current is used in the refrigerator with aluminum, but Figure 2 shows that less heat is dissipated. Figure 3 confirms that the refrigerator with aluminum is slower to cool down, and though it appears to use less current, it actually uses more to do the same task as the regular refrigerator. <br><br> In conclusion, using aluminum to increase energy efficiency and cooling ability should not be attempted by using aluminum cans stacked vertically to increase the surface area of the condenser coils. <br><br>

MAD SCIENCE: ELECTROKINETIC PROPULSION
Matthew Alan Martz, Jeffrey Wayne Dronenburg II
Great Mills High School, Great Mills, MD, USA

This investigation and series of experiments was intended to determine the best method for harnessing the Biefeld Brown effect. Our goal was to use the data to construct a craft that would lift 50g. The efficiency criterion was based on the net force on each craft. We used a common Electrokinetic Propulsion Device (EPD) design to build multiple EPD’s described in the Research Plan due to ease of assembly and use. Our experiments tested the effects of a variety of variables, including: size of EPD, voltage, wire height and polarity.<br><br>We were not able to use electronic test equipment since an EPD flight is generally erratic and will interfere with electronic sensors. Instead, we secured each craft to a standard triple beam balance, measured the mass of the craft, then operated it and found the apparent difference in weight to calculate the net force.<br><br>We found that the largest EPD craft with a side length of 220mm lifted with the most force as compared to the other crafts with side lengths of 200mm and 180mm. The 220mm craft lifted on average 3.14g of mass.<br><br>We used the 200mm side length EPD for the remaining experiments. Polarity testing revealed an 8.5% increase in efficiency when the wire was negative. Input voltage testing revealed an optimum operating voltage of an estimated 33,000 volts, yielding a lifting capacity of 2.74g. Wire height testing indicated an optimum operating height of 2.5 cm, with a lifting capacity of 1.7g.

RINVENTING EDISON: OPTIMIZATION OF LIGHT BULB FILAMENT MATERIAL
Elizabeth Mrizek, Teresa Sartor
Presentation High School, San Jose, CA, United States

Over 100 years ago Edison perfected the light bulb making it one of the most widely used devices in our daily lives. By “reinventing Edison” our project reproduced some of the many tests Edison executed to determine the optimal filament shape, metal, and environment for a filament in an incandescent lamp. After researching the subject, we believed that a helical tungsten filament in the presence of a vacuum would be most effective in the construction of a light bulb. Tungsten has a high melting point as well as a high resistivity allowing it reach greater intensities without burning out as quickly. During our experiment, we tested the filament resistance, the brightest intensity, and the duration of the light for steel, brass, nichrome, and tungsten filaments. After the completion of the many “electrifying” tests and hours of pouring over the data collected, we have concluded that a helical tungsten filament in the presence of a vacuum produced the brightest light for the longest amount of time. The vacuum was effective in producing a higher intensity for the tungsten filament because the heat the filament produced was not able to radiate to the surrounding air, allowing the temperatures to increase. The helical shape also permitted the heat to stay within the filament because not as much surface area was exposed to the surrounding environment. A helical tungsten filament in a vacuum neither produced the most light nor had the longest duration, but we have learned, in doing this project, that one must sacrifice intensity for duration or duration of intensity. The steel filament, for example, produced a high intensity of light, but the duration was extremely short, an average of approximately 10 seconds. The tungsten filament, on the other hand, produced a fairly high intensity of light for a fairly long period of time, approximately 3 minutes. Since light bulbs in our daily lives are, in fact, make with helical tungsten filament in the presence of a vacuum, it reinforces the validity of our conclusions.

CREATE A COLLAPSIBLE WHEELCHAIR
Joshua Robert Turner, Shawn Matthews, William Rodgers
Paulding County High School, Dallas; Hiram High School, Hiram, Georgia, USA

The goal of this engineering project was to create a durable, space efficient, and cost effective collapsible wheelchair. Research found that modern wheelchairs are too large when folded up, which makes it hard for handicapped people to lift them or store them. The team knew a better wheelchair must have a collapsible wheel. This need was meet by sectioning our wheel and allowing each section to seperate from the other and interlock behind one another. Ergonomics were also considered as a main aspect of the design. A goal for the team was to make the wheelchair fit in an overhead compartment of an airplane. Possible solutions were achieved by sketches and brainstorming. The sketches were then combined to achieve the best possible design for the wheelchair. The wheelchair was modeled on the computer by individually engineering parts and then putting them into an assembly. A program called COSMOS® was used to test all the individual parts and assemblies. Each part was put under stress tests by applying a material and then fixing certain locations on the parts and applying forces to other locations. Stainless Chrome Aluminum was chosen as the material for a majority of the parts because it had the perfect characteristics of durability, strength, weight, and practicality. All parts passed with a safety factor of 1.5 or greater; or if the part failed then that part was changed to meet desired constraints. The wheelchair weighs only 30lbs and can hold 500lbs. The wheelchair as a whole will help disabled persons travel with greater ease. A person in a wheelchair can finally travel on an airplane and store his/her wheelchair above him in the overhead compartment instead of placing it in an area not accessible by them. Our wheelchair will also make it possible for a person to work at a standard desk and still be able to comfortably slide under it. With this greater ease of life we can enable handicapped person to begin retaining their independence.

SELF-HEALING STRUTS
Eletha Joy Flores, Jay Carson
Charles Herbert Flowers, Springdale, MD, United States

We began this project as a precursor to the Self-Healing initiative for the Tetrahedral robotic walker. The purpose was to develop a method of self-repair for the ANTS robotic swarms, which must reconfigure their geometry in every step, and enhance unmanned space exploration. The main engineering goals of our project were to design, create, and automate simulated broken struts to relocate each other and physically realign in 3-D space. Prototyping consisted of designing and developing the strut-mounting box, actuating struts, pan and tilt swivel mechanisms, printed circuit board and search algorithm, and integrating the system with the sensory components. Testing involved displacing the mobile, visible light-emitting strut at specified locations around the immobile, light-sensing strut, executing the search algorithm, and measuring ending distances to determine overall accuracy of strut realignment. Statistical analysis using the ANOVA test demonstrated that at each position, realignment was equally close to the target position, while more than 50% of test trials successfully realigned. Our self-realigning prototype was thus reliably successful. Problems prohibiting successful realignment can be attributed to faults in the photocell light sensor, ambient light interference, weaknesses in the algorithm, and instability of the mechanical structure. A change in the sensor-emitter combination along with furthur testing and optimization of the system will maximize self-healing capabilities and bring our team closer to a self-repairing robot.<br><br>

MAGNETO-RHEO-LOGICAL FLUID
Yen Nguyen, Thanh Nguyen, Stephanie Romasanta
Oak Grove High School, San Jose, CA USA

<br><br> Magneto-Rheo-logical fluids are incredible fluids that are able to change their state from a liquid to solid instantly. This fluid is being used inside large dampers to absorb vibration and help stabilize buildings and bridges during earthquakes. MR fluids harden inside the damper when it is exposed to a magnetic field and changes back to its original state as soon as the magnetic force is removed. This magnetic fluid is created with the combining iron filing and oil, such as motor oil or food oil.<br><br> This experiment is to analyze how MR damper are able to withstand the force of the earthquakes and winds. We constructed a small-scale replica of a tall building with basla wood and foam board attached with velcro. On the top of the building, we placed a beaker filled with colored water. The building was placed on the bed filled with water. We dropped different weight on to the bed to cause vibrations on to the model building. This vibration splashes the water in the beaker. We measured the height of water splashed with and without the MR damper attached to the model building.<br><br> The results clearly show that less water splashed when the MR damper was activated then when it was not. In the experiment, the results turned out to be accurate to our hypothesis. Testing with a mass of 56.66g without the damper the splash height was 39mm, but with it, it is only 14mm. So the vibration was reduced to a fraction of 2.79. The MR fluid has a great effect on building structure and bridges. <br><br>This MR damper should be in good use in today's world if some of our buildings consist of the MR damper. By using this MR Damper, a building or bridge can be stabilized during an earthquake. Today this MR damper is located in Asia, the China's Dongting lake bridge and Japan's National museum of Emerging Science.

COLLAPSIBLE WHEELCHAIR YEAR 2
William Caleb Rodgers, Joshua Robert Turner
Hiram High School, Hiram GA, USA

The purpose of the design team is to create a durable, space efficient, cost effective, and manufacturable collapsible wheelchair. New research was performed to find out how to make the wheelchair more manufacturable. Extensive research was done to determine what types of materials would adequately meet our design constraints. New designs were produced to successfully provide footrests, wheel rigidity, and front arm/leg connections. Increased attention was paid to documentation in the engineering log books, manufacturability, drafting the patent application, and forming Inventive Design Solutions L.L.C. In the previous year all work was devoted to the engineering process by focusing on general research and developing the best possible solution for the collapsible wheelchair design. The chair was a solid aesthetic design, but it was not functional enough to manufacture and take to market. Work in year one also involved a lack of consideration for future business plans, which caused the team to have to redesign many features of the wheelchair. We feel we have reached our goal with the year two continuation, and with further pursuit we plan to bring a beneficial product to market.

MAGNETIC FETCH
Mark M. Head, Jaae In
Glen Rose High School, Malvern, AR, U.S. 

This project's goal is to create a way for dogs to play fetch by themselves.<br><br> <br><br> There are energetic dogs that constantly want to play when their owners may be too tired or do not have enough time for this activity. Our concept is to develop a way for a dog to play without help from the owner.<br><br> We approached the question, "What if we could make a ball that would move away when the dog chases it?" The next step was to determine how this would be possible. The idea of magnetic repulsion occurred as a possible solution to the problem. Magnets were attached inside the ball with the north side facing outward and the magnets on the collar facing the same way. The ball would be pushed away from the dog not allowing him to catch it; thus, creating a way for the dog to continue to chase the ball.<br><br> We predicted that the magnet on the collar would repel the magnets placed in the ball causing it to move away from the dog. The results were different than our original hypothesis because the magnets in the ball were too heavy and the collar magnets were not strong enough to create the repulsion. If the ball veered too much to either side, the attraction and repulsion became equal and it caused the ball to sit still and vibrate without producing movement in any direction. We believe the vibration was due to both the repulsion and attraction occurring simultaneously.<br><br>

TESTING THE MOST EFFECTIVE IONIC CHARGER AND ITS EFFECT ON PARTICLE CHARGING
David Gates Steward, Foster Holcomb, Russel Viegas
Little Rock Central High School, Little Rock, Arkansas, United States

The purpose of this experiment was to test for the most effective corona charger. Three corona chargers, also known as ionic pumps, were constructed using the same materials and procedures of construction for each pump. The pumps varied in the diameter of the PVC pipe used and the number of needles in each pump was directly proportional to the diameter. It was hypothesized that the pump with the three-inch diameter would be the best at charging particles, and the pump with the one-inch pipe would be the least effective due to the limited space and less charge. To conduct the experiment, three pipes were constructed. Using a positive charge of 5kV, the one-inch pipe was the most effective charger of the three, and three-inch proved to be the least efficient. When a negative voltage was applied, the 3-inch charger was most effective in charging particles and the 1-inch pipe was least effective.

A SELF-CONTAINED COLLISION AVOIDANCE ROBOT PHASE II AN IMPROVED OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE SYSTEM
Benjamin Josef Bohn, Panola High Schol
Panola, Oklahoma, USA

The improvements of my obstacle avoidance system included improvements of not only the sensors and control program but improvements of the placement and number of sensors. I found that if the robot had a simplified and symmetrical perimeter, the obstacle avoidance system could be simplified as well. In previous attempts, the wheels were found to be a nuisance in terms of avoiding a collision. The wheels protruded from the robot and introduced an enormous area for a collision to occur that was difficult to protect by the proximity sensors. The resulting circular frame encompassed all of the components of the robot, including the wheels, and provided for an area onto which the sensors could be mounted in order to optimize collision avoidance.<br><br> <br><br> The sensor receivers were selected because of their ability to “ignore” ambient infrared radiation that is not of a specific frequency. Initial testing revealed that the output frequency and the input frequency are the same, meaning that the output should be used as more of a carrier for an output than a simple square or ramped wave output. The circuit that was finally implemented used the carrier frequency as a trigger onto which a modulation frequency of 600 Hz was added, giving a clear indication of a change in the status of the carrier. The number of logic transitions in a given amount of time is counted and compared to a minimum value to determine an action in the program that produces a reaction of the robot. <br><br>

VORTICES - WHAT A DRAG
Jordan Matthew Meehl
Glencoe-Silver Lake H.S., Glencoe, Mn., U.S.A

Vortices are spiraling winds coming from the wings of a plane. These vortices can cause havoc to other planes following in its path to flip or fly out of control. Different designs of wing tips have been found to create less vortices. This researcher developed an experiment to test the effectiveness of different types of wing tip designs at lessening vortices and hopefully come up with a better design in the process. <br><br> My problem was "Which wing tip will reduce the size of vortices?" My hypothesis was that the tip sail design would perform best by producing the smallest vortices, while the control or box tip would perform the worst by producing the largest vortices. Wings were made with five of the most common tip designs; control (box tip), conventional, winglet, tip tank and tip sail. A wind tunnel was than constructed to test each wing with wing tip and a measurement was taken of the vortices produced. Controls were taken to ensure accuracy in taking the measurements.<br><br> The data disproved my hypothesis; the winglet design performed the best by producing the smallest vortices, while the conventional wing tip design performed the worst by producing the largest vortices.<br><br> Variables included wings not quite at scale, positioning of the wings, or force of the wind in the tunnel. Wing tip vortices are not only important to engineers of airplanes but to submarine, helicopter and racecar designs. Reducing vortices can save time, money and precious resources.

EFFICIENCY OF TWO NOVEL BIODEGRADABLE POLYMERS AT VARIOUS TEMPERATURE LEVELS
Nisha Pillai
Temple High School, Temple, TX

Biodegradable Polymers are natural or synthetic macromolecules form of plastic that decomposes both natural aerobic and anaerobic environments.Previous studies have shown that most polymers are only applicable at a certain temperature levels. This experiment examined the practicality for surgical applications of two bone polymers at various temperatures. The solid polymer is a co-polymer of poly (lactic acid) (PLA) and poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) and was synthesized by the ring opening polymerization of D, L-Lac-tide and PEG. This resulted in a ratio of PLA to PEG of 68:32.The liquid polymer involved addition of diaxonone (DX) monomer resulting in a ratio 45:17:38 for PLA: DX: PEG. The solid form was obtained by drying the polymer at an elevated temperature under a vacuum.The samples in both solid and liquid form were suspended in a water of constant temperature. Eight different temperature levels from 21 °C to 37 °C were studied to observe variances in viscosity, density, and the amount of time of degradation of both polymers. The liquid polymer was recorded to be more viscous and therefore more inject-able at lower temperatures.However, at temperatures in the range of 34 °C to 36 ° C the solid polymer had similar viscosity to the liquid. Furthermore the solid polymer had a greater durability.<br><br>The uses of these polymers for surgical procedures show great promise. However, due to durability limitations, the applicability appears to be limited to smaller procedures. Future research is needed to develop the greater durability required for larger applications such as orthopedic procedures.

5-PLY HICKORY LACROSSE SHAFT VS. SOLID HICKORY LACROSSE SHAFT
Rachel Marie McCarthy
James Bowie High School, Austin, TX

The purpose of the experiment was to compare flexibility and impact strength for a 5-Ply hickory lacrosse shaft and a solid hickory lacrosse shaft. Because each lacrosse position may require a shaft of different flexibility and impact strength, the project would be helpful to a lacrosse player who is choosing the type of shaft they should use for their position. Flexibility was tested by hanging weight off the end of the lacrosse shaft and measuring the flex distance. Impact strength was tested by dropping a weighted shaft, to simulate a check in lacrosse, onto the lacrosse shaft and measuring the weight at which the shaft broke. The 5-ply hickory shaft proved to be more flexible by about 5 inches. The solid hickory shaft had a higher impact strength; on an average is 13 pounds higher than a 5-ply hickory lacrosse shaft. In the end a solid hickory lacrosse shaft would be better because it is a little bit flexible, but it is also has a very high impact strength so it will last longer in a game.

ENGINEERING OF AN AMMONIA-BASED HYDROGEN STORAGE SYSTEM (HYDROGEN AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO OIL)
Ariah Aram Klages-Mundt
Winona Senior High School

The consumption and pollution of fossil fuels has led to a search for alternative energy sources for electricity and transportation. Use of renewable sources could be applied to generating hydrogen as a sustainable, renewable energy solution. The purpose of research was, through 6 phases, to design a method for efficient, renewable hydrogen production, develop a hydrogen storage system using calcium ammine (NH3) complexes, and to release hydrogen from ammonia for fuel cell use. The goal of this research was to meet DOE guidelines for hydrogen storage. Phase1 concentrated on the practicality of hydrogen through simulation comparisons to petroleum, through which the date for global peak oil was calculated 2009 and hydrogen was found more economical than oil within 50 years. In phase 2, drag-reducing riblets were applied to wind turbines, reducing costs of renewable electrolysis (U-shape shown best for application). Phases 3-4 tested ammonia storage in NH4Cl and release of H2 through a reaction with Mg. Due to low weight percent hydrogen yield in phases 3-4, phases 5-6 focused on hydrogen storage in calcium ammine complexes and decomposing ammonia using catalysts. Ammonia was shown to be released from the complex experimentally at 78º C (comparable to 349º C using studied Mg ammine complex). The Ca ammine complex exceeded DOE goals for hydrogen storage and Ni/Al2O3 and Cu/Al2O3 catalysts were shown successful in decomposing ammonia through ph and flow rate tests. The results of this project show that calcium ammine storage makes hydrogen a viable alternative to oil per DOE goals.

THERMOGELLING DISPERSIONS OF POLYMER NANAPARTICLES
Peter D Hu
Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science, Denton, TX

A solution of therapeutic proteins like insulin is usually introduced into the body via daily injection. It is very difficult, however, to keep the protein drug effective for a long period of time due to degradation and protein compatibility using traditional polymeric carriers. The purpose of this project is to create a thermogelling dispersion of polymer nanoparticles for the controlled release of protein drugs. The nanoparticles were synthesized using two biocompatible interpenetrating polymer networks of poly(ethylene glycol) derivative (PEGd) polymers that had a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of 33 °C and poly(acrylic acid) (PAAc). PEGd nanoparticles were prepared under a nitrogenous environment using a precipitation polymerization method and used as seeds for AAc to polymerize upon. Above the LCST, PEGd imparted hydrophobic attractions between particles, and the temperature-insensitive PAAc prevented shrinkage of the PEGd network so the interparticle distance was close for effective attractions. Various reaction times for the polymerization of PAAc upon PEGd were investigated and the optimum time determined. Atomic force microscopy illustrated that resultant nanoparticles were spherical and had 242 nm diameters at 20 °C by the light scattering method. The dispersion’s viscosity increased 40 times from 20 to 37 °C and the dispersion was visually a fluid at 20 °C, but a gel at 37 °C. This work leads to a novel polymeric carrier for the controlled release of proteins, as proteins can be mixed into the dispersion at room temperature but encapsulated and slowly released by the gelled dispersion once injected into the body.

FRACTAL DIMENSION AND ITS RELATION TO THE EFFICIENCY OF PROPOSED ARTIFICIAL LUNG MODELS
Avi William Levy
West Linn High School, West Linn, Oregon, United States

Current artificial lungs are very "artificial" and not so much "lung". They are not efficient, and cannot be transplanted in humans. My goal is to increase the efficiency of future devices to make them practical and transplantable. The target artificial lungs, much like nature's own, will be of fractal nature, to maximize surface area. Maximized surface area leads to increased efficiency. The experiment showed the correlation between fractal dimension and efficiency with respect to artificial lungs. The focus of this project was from a mathematical standpoint, and did not involve physical lungs. It was postulated that an increased fractal dimension would result in an increased efficiency.<br><br>This study shows that the best way to construct an artificial lung is in the shape of a fractal, and then addresses specific fractals. Three rules were derived to generated three series of fractals to test for dimension and efficiency. Each fractal generated was a variation of the Menger Sponge Fractal. The terms of the generated series approached fractal dimensions of 1, 2, and 3 respectively. It was concluded that those which approached dimension 2 have greatest efficiency.<br><br>Future artificial lung advancement relies on this research. The technique of creating customized fractals and selecting which ones will be most advantageous goes beyond artificial lungs and can be widely applied. Creating a more efficient artificial lung is an important step in science.<br><br>

THE USE OF SOUND TO MEASURE, MONITOR, AND MANIPULATE THE ACOUSTICS OF A ROOM
Kurt Richerdson Stiehl, University School of Milwaukee
Milwaukee, WI, USA

In this project, I used sound to measure, monitor and manipulate the acoustics of a room. In the first part of the experiment, I created a method for measuring and graphically presenting the acoustics of a room. This was done through the use of playing a tone and then recording the amplitude of this tone at different points in the room. I then applied this technique to a device that monitors the acoustics of a room. This device works like sonar, turning to different angles and monitoring the acoustics at those angles. <br><br> The first part of the experiment resulted in two main conclusions. First, the acoustics of every room is different. This is due to the distance from the source of the sound and the amplification or the cancellation done by the sound waves that bounce off the walls. The acoustics of a room are also different for different frequencies and physical changes in a room. Where there may be a dead spot in a room, it will not be a dead spot if the materials in the room or frequencies change. <br><br> These conclusions were applied to a device that monitors the acoustics of a room. The device first monitors a room and then detects changes in the acoustics by the addition or moving of materials. It measures the change by intensity, the Doppler effect, and external noises in the room not produced by the detector. This device can be applied as a motion detector or a monitor of acoustics.<br><br>

INTEGRATED AUXILIARY DESIGN - A SYSTEMS COMBINATION TO ELIMINATE SOLE-MEANS RISK
Jennifer Lee Worley
Keyser High School, Keyser, West Virginia, United States of America, 26726

The purpose of my project is to integrate robotic back-up systems, as part of the function that is to be replaced, in the event of primary system failure, yet be dissimilar to avoid common failure, while consuming the same amount of resources and be able to assist the primary system.<br><br> I decided on a rover type vehicle and concentrated my efforts on the propulsion system. Each wheel was given it's own motor and the front and rear wheels were steerable. With this configuration I learned that I only needed one wheel on each side functioning to achieve full maneuverability. That is a loss of 78 percent of the primary system.<br><br> The secondary system will use the wheels as legs and a center piston to raise and lower plus orient the rover. The servo I selected will lift 16 pounds. After measuring the arm on the servo from the pivot point I concluded I would have a 2:1 amplifier, which would limit my rover weight to under 8 pounds.<br><br> If the rover needed to rotate in a tight space the foot could be used to change direction in place. Also the foot could be lowered for more stability in high winds.<br><br> A electronic compass and thermometer were added. Low temperatures had a great impact on battery life, and location ability was essential for demonstration purposes.<br><br> Each propulsion system worked completely independent of each other and was able to accomplish the same tasks while using the same amount of resources.

DEVELOPING A SHAPE MEMORY ALLOY SNAKE ROBOT
Adam Paul Hahn
Robbinsdale Armstrong High School, Plymouth, MN, USA

An original, cost-effective design for a shape memory alloy (SMA)-powered snake robot was developed. Round wire nitinol was chosen as the SMA actuator. The design consisted of nine polystyrene segments joined by brass rivets. Lengths of nitinol ran along each side of the snake. By sequentially actuating lengths of nitinol, a wavelike motion was propagated throughout the snake. A BASIC Stamp 2 microcontroller was used to synchronize the actuations. The SMA-powered snake robot was constructed per design and motion demonstrated. <br><br> A cost analysis of this snake robot was conducted. The use of a shape memory alloy in place of motors and its small scale contributed to the cost effectiveness of this design. <br><br>

A FERRIS WHEEL GONE CHAOTIC: THE CONNECTION BETWEEN FLUID DYNAMICS WITHIN AN INDEPENDENT LORENZIAN WATERWHEEL TO RENEWABLE SOURCES OF POWER
Zachary Brook Howland
Burnsville Senior High School, Burnsville, Minnesota, United States of America

Chaos is a system in which the properties of initial conditions institute the outcome of a non-deterministic environment. The principle sources of renewable energy stem from the concept of thermodynamics, which deals with non-deterministic flows of energy. The main objective of the experiment was to expand the knowledge and analysis of the chaotic motion in a functioning Lorenzian waterwheel. The wheel is a mechanical analogue of a rotating circle of convection. The wheel was designed and constructed to determine whether the ensued chaotic environment could be used to obtain renewable energy and if the non-deterministic motion could be determined, based on the bounded regions of the strange attractor. The waterwheel, itself, could be classified as a turbine, which ideally converts mechanical energy stored in a fluid, into rotational mechanical energy. This type of machine is widely used for the generation of electricity. The Lorenzian model was designed from an imaginative process and constructed using a slanted wood base, glass aquarium, pressurized pump system, steel base, bike wheel, and 360 degree rotational can system. The experiment was conclusive. The wheel generated believed chaotic oscillations, for 20 to 30 seconds every trial. A large step towards acquiring a better understanding of the Lorenzian waterwheel was accomplished. Further study options were then instituted:<br><br>1) find which mathematical formulas or theories pertain to the system<br><br>2) offer a single mathematical equation which could precisely tell an observer where a cup would be according to both velocity and time<br><br>3) obtain a means of generating power from the motion of the wheel<br><br>

NOVEL THERMOGELLING DISPERSIONS OF POLYMER NANOPARTICLES FOR CONTROLLED DRUG DELIVERY
Peter D. Hu
Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science, Denton, TX

Therapeutic proteins are critically important for treating various diseases, but a major problem is that there is not a suitable protein drug carrier that can maintain a sustained release while protecting the protein from degradation in the human body. The purpose of this project is to solve this problem by creating a novel, biocompatible thermogelling dispersion of polymer nanoparticles as a protein drug carrier.<br><br> During Year I, I prepared nanoparticles consisting of two biocompatible interpenetrating polymer networks (IPN): thermo-sensitive poly(ethylene glycol) derivative (PEGd) polymers and thermo-insensitive poly(acrylic acid) (PAAc). The physical properties of the nanoparticles were characterized using atomic force microscopy and dynamic light scattering. The main objective in year II was to apply the dispersion of polymer nanoparticles for controlled drug delivery. Two proteins as model drugs were used for the study of release kinetics: Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and insulin, one of the practical therapeutic proteins. For these drug delivery tests, each protein was mixed with the dispersion at room temperature, at which the dispersion was a fluid. At 37 °C, the dispersion formed a gel, resulting in the slow and continuous release of protein. The released BSA was quantitatively measured using UV-visible spectroscopy. To accurately determine the total level of insulin in a solution, a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay was used. Both BSA and insulin release profiles from the IPN nanoparticle dispersions were characterized by a sustained release under physiological conditions (37 °C, pH 7.4). Such a steady, continuous release demonstrates that this dispersion has potential as a suitable protein drug carrier.

NOVEL THERMOGELLING DISPERSIONS OF POLYMER NANOPARTICLES FOR CONTROLLED DRUG DELIVERY
Peter D. Hu
Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science, Denton, TX

Therapeutic proteins are critically important for treating various diseases, but a major problem is that there is not a suitable protein drug carrier that can maintain a sustained release while protecting the protein from degradation in the human body. The purpose of this project is to solve this problem by creating a novel, biocompatible thermogelling dispersion of polymer nanoparticles as a protein drug carrier.<br><br> During Year I, I prepared nanoparticles consisting of two biocompatible interpenetrating polymer networks (IPN): thermo-sensitive poly(ethylene glycol) derivative (PEGd) polymers and thermo-insensitive poly(acrylic acid) (PAAc). The physical properties of the nanoparticles were characterized using atomic force microscopy and dynamic light scattering. The main objective in year II was to apply the dispersion of polymer nanoparticles for controlled drug delivery. Two proteins as model drugs were used for the study of release kinetics: Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and insulin, one of the practical therapeutic proteins. For these drug delivery tests, each protein was mixed with the dispersion at room temperature, at which the dispersion was a fluid. At 37 °C, the dispersion formed a gel, resulting in the slow and continuous release of protein. The released BSA was quantitatively measured using UV-visible spectroscopy.

HIGH FREQUENCY ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES POWERED BY RENEWABLE RESOURCES TO PRODUCE AN EFFICIENT WATER HEATING SYSTEM
Cassandra Arien Lynn Abel
Hobson Public School, Hobson, MT, United States of America

The engineering goal of this project is to determine the feasibility of using microwave energy to produce an efficient water heating system powered by an environmentally friendly, renewable resource.<br><br> The system was built using microwave oven components and tested for excessive leakage by a professional. Electrical tests were conducted while running the system and monitoring the temperature of the outflow water and the water at different levels in the holding tank.<br><br> The heating efficiency for a tankless, on demand water heating system varied from 72 to 80 percent, averaging an efficiency of 76.1 percent for all the tests combined. The heating efficiency for an un-insulated tank model water heater varied from 51 to 57 percent, averaging 54 percent. The heating efficiency for an insulated, tank model water heater varied from 67.78 to 80 percent, averaging 73.7 percent. On average, it took the system 30 minutes to heat 12.3 Liters of water from an average of 10° Celsius to the desired temperature of 49° Celsius. A thermostat was assembled to keep the water between 49 and 60° Celsius.<br><br> A model hydrogen fuel cell and solar panel were constructed to demonstrate the use of these environmentally friendly, renewable resources for power. By pairing the two resources, you can use the solar panel to carry out the process of electrolysis to generate the hydrogen needed to run the fuel cell when there is an insufficient light source.<br><br> The water heating system produced was environmentally friendly and efficient. Therefore, the engineering goal was met.<br><br>

IMPLEMENTING A DATA-GATHERING METHOD FOR A DOUBLE-WELL DUFFING OSCILLATOR USING NI LABVIEW
Javier Cabrera-Perez
Breck School, Golden Valley Minnesota, United States of America

This project sought to analyze whether a dynamic system modeled on the Duffing Double-Well equation showed chaotic patterns. The model was based on the equation.<br><br> There were three goals to the project. The first goal was to wire the oscillator and find a suitable way to collect data, using a National Instruments DAQ card that gathered voltage readings. The second goal was to write a program to read and interpret data using the NI LabVIEW programming language. The final goal was to analyze the fractal patterns produced in a Poincare section.<br><br> The first two goals in the project were succesfully completed. The oscillator is now wired to a computer through a DAQ board that collects voltage readings from the tracks. A LabVIEW program that interprets phase space and Poincare sections is now able to control the data acquisition. Even though the oscillator was designed to follow the Duffing Double-Well problem, the project did not determine whether the system was chaotic due to an electrical noise that spiked at about 50 mV, which came from the electrical wiring of the building. Using a 3.5-inch diameter steel ball, the noise was partially blocked. However, the sensitivity of the system disrupted the Poincare section. It was also speculated that the tracks acted as antennas to amplify the noise.

WHAT FOUNDATION BEST WITHSTANDS THE FORCES OF AN EARTHQUAKE
Mackenzie Kate McDaniel
Bartlesville Mid-High, Bartlesville, OK, United States

Millions of earthquakes happen each year. Many of them are extremely damaging. The purpose of this project is to find a foundation that will decrease the amount of property damage caused by an earthquake. To test this, a simulated earthquake was built out of an electrical vibrating sander and a dimmer switch. The sander was put on the dimmer switch so that it would have five different vibration levels. Next, the sander was attached to the bottom of a two foot by two foot by ¼ inch wood board and set on top of two sawhorses. Three wooden blocks were glued together to form the base of the structure. The structure was set on one of six foundations in the middle of the board. The six foundations tested were fixed foundation, where the structure was attached directly to the board, four springs, soft rubber tubing, hard rubber corks, teflon sliders, and rollers. Each vibration level was tested ten times for each of the foundations. The spring foundation had the best results for all five of the vibration levels. The reason for this is because the simulated earthquake created horizontal vibrations. The springs took the horizontal forces and converted them into vertical forces. Vertical forces were less likely to overcome the friction holding the horizontal levels of the structure in place. While all vibrations in an earthquake may not be horizontal, this experiment showed that springs beneath a building may reduce those lateral forces and reduce the damage to the building.<br><br>

A NON-PHOTOLITHOGRAPHIC APPROACH TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF N-TYPE MOSFET DEVICES USING FOCUSED ION BEAM TECHNOLOGY
Ryna Karnik
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland, OR, USA

The purpose of this project was to devise a procedure by which it was possible to directly microform/micromachine MOSFET devices onto a doped silicon substrate during physical silicon debug, thereby bypassing post-manufacturing photolithographic processes. Possible applications of this method include in-situ device formation during chip editing, and post-manufacture device creation in three-dimensional microchips. Using Visual Basic, models were written to predict both electrical and physical properties of the devices. An FEI FIB 610 with a Ga LMIS (Liquid Metal Ion Source) was used to both mill out the geometry of the transistor, to dope the source and drain regions through maskless implantation of Ga into the substrate, and to deposit platinum contacts using a direct-write chemical vapor deposition process. A heat treatment was used to anneal the silicon and allow the Ga to take substitutional lattice sites in the substrate. The transistor was tested using a 4-point probe station. Results of source/drain diode testing of the transistors gave strong evidence supporting the hypothesis that gallium was an n-type dopant. Further testing is in progress to determine the exact behavior of gallium in a silicon substrate. When tested, the transistors showed MOSFET characteristics, the I-V curves showing no significant difference from the mathematical model. <br><br>

TOUCH-BASED NAVIGATION AID FOR THE BLIND AND VISUALLY IMPAIRED
William Decker Neiswanger
School of Science and Technology, Beaverton, Oregon, USA

The aim of this project is to engineer a device that allows blind and visually impaired individuals to detect, and navigate freely around, obstacles in an unfamiliar setting. This aim is met by creating a pointable apparatus that applies pressure on successive fingers, allowing a sightless individual to perceive the distance to, and position of, objects within an environment, without coming into direct contact with these objects. The user of this aid wears a glove with a mounted ultrasonic distance sensor stationed on the hand’s back (perpendicular to the hand). The ultrasonic distance sensor has a five foot range. This ultrasonic distance sensor detects the distance to objects within its path, and outputs an electrical voltage proportional to this distance. The voltage from the ultrasonic distance sensor goes through four comparators, which produce electrical charges when this ultrasonic distance sensor voltage crosses a certain threshold. I am able to set the comparators so that when the ultrasonic distance sensor detects an object within five feet, the first comparator gives off a charge, and consecutive comparators give off charges when an object comes within three feet, two feet, and one foot. Each comparator is connected to a solenoid, which is mounted inside the glove, on the tip of one of the four fingers. When objects come within the four distinct thresholds, the four successive solenoids make contact with four successive fingers, allowing a sightless individual to detect the distance to an object. This device successfully completed its engineering goal, and is truly able to apply pressure on successive fingers, allowing the user to perceive the distance to, and position of, objects within an unfamiliar environment, without coming into direct contact with these objects.

REGARDING THE APPLICATIONS OF SEMICONDUCTING CARBON-BASED SINGLE-WALLED NANOTUBES
Yosyp Shvab
T. C. Williams High School, Alexandria, VA

A series of experiments were conducted in order to find methods by which field effect transistor devices with Single Walled Carbon Nanotubes (SWNT) as the semiconducting gate material could be turned into binary memory cells. SWNT MOSFETs (metal oxide semiconductor field effecttransistors) were produced specifically as part of the research. The entire fabrication process from silicon wafer cutting, catalyst spinning, SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) development, e-beam lithography and nanotube growth were conducted for the experiment. The main problem with using SWNT based transistors as memory cells is the issue of uncontrollable and unpredictable cycles of hysteresis, which is attained by grounding the Drain, applying variable voltage to the Source and reading the current of the Gate. The following research proposes, tests and proves a solution to the stated problem by the idea of dispersing a Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) polymer with small (<50nm) nanoclusters of Au, and spinning said solution onto silicon based chips with completed SWCNT transistor devices. The proposed method functions theoretically by the gold nanoparticles being charged on the initial part of the hysteresis, however as the Source voltage reaches its peak and changes direction, the gold clusters are chargetrapped and continue to maintain their electromagnetic value. Thus the hysteresis loop width increases greatly due to the extra particles maintaining their trapped charge.

PNEUMATIC CANNONS
Travis Wayne Paul
Notre Dame High School, Wichita Falls, Texas, United States

This project was to test my hypothesis that differences in air tank volume, pressure, projectile diameter, and barrel length would make observable differences in the velocity and maximum range of a projectile fired from pneumatic cannons.<br><br> The cannon was assembled from PVC pipe and fittings, an automatic lawn sprinkler valve as the fire control system, barrels of three different diameters, and air tanks with four differing volumes. Wooden dowel “projectiles” were sized to the barrels and were of varying lengths so that each weighed the same. Each barrel/tank combination was tested at three different air pressures settings each fired three times over a chronograph, for velocity, and then three more times to establish maximum range. A portable air compressor pressurized the air tanks and the procedure resulted in over 220 test firings carried out over a three-day period.<br><br> As I had hypothesized, the larger tank sizes, longer barrels, and higher air pressures produced markedly higher velocities with all barrel combinations. Distance testing, however, revealed interesting results. Since the projectiles were of different diameters (3/4”, 1”, and 1-1/2”) they had to be of different lengths in order to make them all weigh the same. Due to its much greater length, the smallest projectile tumbled badly in flight, which adversely affected its range. The largest projectile, with a greater frontal area, also did not range as far as did the middle projectile which apparently had a much better ballistic coefficient than the others.<br><br>

USE OF GAS-FILLED LIPID MICROBUBBLES FOR ULTRASOUND-MODULATED DRUG RELEASE FROM IN SITU FORMING PLGA IMPLANTS
Rebecca L. Forcier
Hathaway Brown School, Shaker Heights, OH

In-situ forming biodegradable polymer drug depots stimulated by ultrasound-induced microbubble cavitation offer a promising, minimally-invasive, and controllable treatment for cancerous tumors. Prior experimentation examined microbubble stability and susceptibility to ultrasound. Incubated microbubbles appeared to be less stable at higher temperatures; percent bubbles burst by ultrasound sonication correlated positively to time and duty cycle but negatively to frequency. The current project tested the efficacy of combining microbubbles and low-power ultrasound to alter the drug release profile of in-situ forming implants. PLGA (n=4) and PLGA-avidin (n=3) implants, both containing fluorescein as the mock drug, were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and later sonicated in 50x microbubble solutions. Controls received ultrasound alone or neither ultrasound nor microbubbles. PLGA-avidin implants used biotinylated microbubbles to attach the bubbles to their surface. PBS supernatant was sampled over time for fluorescein content. The data suggest that the combination of microbubbles and ultrasound increases drug release immediately following sonication relative to treatment with ultrasound alone. Stimulated drug release was more evident for PLGA-avidin implants with biotinylated microbubbles attached (236% increase) than for PLGA implants in microbubble solution (66% increase). Extended release profiles (30 hrs for regular implants, 9 hrs for avidinylated implants) were nevertheless similar after sonication between implants in different treatment groups; the proposed system therefore shows potential for “on-demand” drug release. Ongoing testing will determine if drug release stimulated by ultrasound cavitation can be repeated in the same implant over a longer period.

IMAGE QUALITY
Megan Marie Pendleton
Vista Ridge High School, Cedar Park, Texas, United States

This project is about improving image quality in a telescope. The particular telescope was built for last year’s science fair. The two aspects of image quality are collimation and focus. The method used for determining good focus also provides a way to measure improvement in image quality. During collimation a tool set was used along with a step-by-step method to achieve good alignment with the two mirrors and focuser/eyepiece. A web camera was mounted at prime focus of the telescope to capture the star image in order to assess its quality. An analysis of the star image was performed using a computer program called MatLab. This analysis determined the image’s degree of focus. Using the analysis, a motor connected to the focuser, and a process written to determine an image’s prime focus, the telescope could focus automatically.

RADIAL MOMENTUM
Jordan T.C. Lutz
Ada-Borup High School, Ada, MN, USA

Radial Momentum<br><br> This project highlights the properties of Radial Momentum and how they can be applied to flight. This project also "debunks" the popular belief that the Bernoulli Principle, in and of itself, explains flight. Bernoulli's theory states that where velocity is high, pressure is low and where velocity is low, pressure is high. When air travels over the top of an airplane wing, it is said to go faster than air on the bottom of the wing in order to travel to the back of the wing at the same time as the air on the bottom. I believe that this principle alone does not explain flight. In my project, I explain what some scientists think is the real explanation for flight. I use several demonstrations to show how Radial Momentum causes low-pressure zones. Radial Momentum, or Radial Expansion, occurs when particles spread out in all directions from a central point. My demonstrations will show that this is what causes low-pressure zones, which allow planes to fly.<br><br>

DESIGNING A FORCE-SENSING DEVICE TO AID IN THE TREATMENT OF IDIOPATHIC TOE WALKING THROUGH MOTIVATION
Isabelle Cicely Gill
Nicolet High School, Glendale, WI

The purpose of this project was to design a device to be used in the treatment of young idiopathic toe walkers (ITWs) by motivating them through visual feedback. ITWs are children who are physically able to put their heels down but for unknown reasons walk and stand on their toes. Current protocol is to not treat ITWs under the age of three. After the age of three, ITWs are often treated with braces, casts, and surgery to lengthen their Achilles tendons. To address the need for a treatment of ITWs under the age of three a force-sensing resistor was designed and incorporated into a circuit with LEDs. The illumination of the LEDs is proportional to the amount of force applied to the force-sensing resistor. The device attaches to a shoe with the force-sensing resistor on the heel of the shoe and the LEDs on the toe. More LEDs light when the child applies more force to their heel. Initial results show that the device works, it indicates different pressures that are applied to it, and it received a positive response when tested on an ITW. In conclusion, the prototype was a success and a real product using a force-sensing resistor could be developed as possible early treatment for idiopathic toe walking. The next phase of this project is to enhance the device with the addition of a sound component and to do thorough testing of the device on a large test group of idiopathic toe walkers.

POP BOTTLE CONCRETE
Brandon Lee Herrick
Franklin Public High School, Franklin, NE

The purpose of my project is to see if adding recycled plastic to concrete will increase the compressive strength of concrete. My hypothesis is that the recycled plastic will increase the strength of concrete by 10% compressive strength. My procedure was to make recycled plastic concrete in a 5x6 inch-testing canister. I made 3 samples each of a control, 10% recycled plastic, and 20% recycled plastic. I let them sit for 21 days at room temperature so they hardened. After the 21-day period reached, I crushed them with a hydraulic press. The press had a digital display so I could read the results for an accurate measurement. The display measures the force in pounds per square inch or (psi), so that way it was easy to convert the results to roadways using a simple equation. I concluded that when I increased my percentage of plastic, the strength gradually increased. In comparing the control and the 10% average there was a difference of 600 psi. In comparing the 10% to the 20% the average had a difference of 200 psi. The average difference of the control and the 20% had a difference of 800 psi. My hypothesis was correct as the percentage increase 24% rather than the predicted 10% increase. The standard deviation for the control samples was 2600 +- 200. The deviation for my 10% samples was 3200 +- 200, and for my 20% samples were 3500 +- 100.

THE EVALUATION OF A MULTI-FREEWING UAV WITH THE CONCURRENT DEVELOPMENT OF A FLYING TEST PLATFORM TO ASSIST IN EVALUATION OF TURBULENCE REDUCTION AND FLIGHT PERFORMANCE
Ryan Thomas Olson
Southwest Virginia Governor's School, Dublin, Virginia, USA

The objective of this year’s project was to further evaluate and construct a multi-freewing aircraft having significant turbulence alleviation and thrust vectoring capabilities, intended for a UAV and general aviation aircraft. Design specifics of a single freewing were investigated this year using computer simulations and wind tunnel testing at VPI. These studies compared lift, drag, and moment values for freewing and identical fixed-wing configurations. Most of the effort in this final stage included developing a flyable, UAV test platform to simulate actual flight conditions and determine the advantages of a multi-freewing. The distribution of mass across the wing chord was found experimentally to significantly affect a freewing’s performance. The optimum lift/drag ratio found for a fixed-wing was duplicated when converted to a freewing. The flyable remote test platform, equipped with a GPS plus data monitoring devices, was completed. This included the fabrication of a series of radio-controlled mono-freewing model aircraft of adequate size to carry the remote sensing and telemetry equipment. The results of the scale-model radio-controlled aircraft studies led to the design, fabrication, and testing of a one-third scale biplane. This incorporated the video telemetry GPS monitoring system, a wing/horizon view camera, and a ground surveillance camera for observation by the ground based controller. It was concluded that the optimum freewing configuration for the greatest turbulence reduction, STOL characteristics, and ease of control was for a bottom fixed wing with ailerons staggered 0.625c and separated 0.9c from a top freewing. This included a NACA 23112 with a pivot location of 0.22c, with 40% to 45% of the mass in front of the pivot. This configuration proved to be an enhanced platform for military/civilian UAVs and general aviation aircraft.

WHAT EFFECTS DO LEADING EDGE TUBERCLES HAVE ON HYDROFOIL CHARACTERISTICS?
Mark Richard Fleming
Loyola High School, Mankato, Minnesota, USA 

I choose to do this project because I have always had an interest in airplanes. I observed that the Humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) is able to execute extreme banking and turning maneuvers. The humpback has large protuberances or tubercles on the leading edge on its flippers. I wanted to learn more about the effect leading edge tubercles<br><br>would have on the lift, drag, and stall characteristics produced by a hydrofoil. For my testing, I developed and made a balance (measurement device) to record the lift and drag forces. I made a birch foil (Foil NACA 4412), epoxy sealed it, sanded it smooth, and attached it to my homemade balance. I then tested my hydrofoil in the water tunnel at several selected angles of attack. I then modified the hydrofoil by adding tubercles to the leading edge and tested them at the same angles of attack. I also added some green dye to the water to observe the flow separation over the hydrofoil to see what affect the tubercles had. In conclusion, I found that the hydrofoil with the tubercles had an increased amount of drag at all the angles of attack. It also had less lift at the lower and middle angles of attack. The tubercles cause the hydrofoil to have a lower max lift (lift over drag). They did seem to delay the critical angle of attack, but more experimentation will be needed to verify that.

DON'T GO WITH THE FLOW
Adeyemi Akorede Adewuyi
Williams High School, Plano, TX

Though there has been interest in the use of magnetically targeted drug delivery systems (MT-DDSs) for treating cancer, several obstacles prevent the development of a fully functional system. This experiment sought to create an MT-DDS model and meet two main engineering goals: (1) identify the optimal magnetic induction for transporting biopolymer-coated ferroparticles and (2) determine the dynamic pressures at which the hemodynamic drag force invalidates MT-DDS. It was hypothesized that if magnetic induction increased, then microparticle velocity would increase. Also, if dynamic pressure increased, then microparticle velocity would decrease. A circulatory system was modeled using water and vinyl tubing. Ferroparticles were inserted, and three stationary neodymium magnets were used to pull the particles in the opposite direction of water flow at magnetic induction levels of 0, 13300, 13700, and 14700 gauss. The experiment was conducted four times, at dynamic pressures of 0, 0.88, 0.92, and 1.07 kilopascals. The average velocity of the particles in millimeters per second for the four induction levels at 0 kPa were, respectively: 0, 28.78, 37.97, 90.52. At 0.88 kPa, the averages were 0, 9.13, 15.02, 20.17. At 1.07 kPa, the averages were 0, 0.6, 0.72, 1.02. The data collected shows a positive correlation between magnetic induction and particle velocity and a negative correlation between dynamic pressure and particle velocity. This information shows the inefficiency of using an MT-DDS in a vein with blood pressure over 1.07 kPa, such as the subclavian vein.

THE EFFECTS OF PIER TYPE ON A RIVERBED'S EROSION
Alyssa Marie Bennett
John Jay Science and Engineering Academy, San Antonio, TX

Large populations are located near rivers across the globe, subjecting millions of lives to the dangers of flooding. There have been many methods of dealing with flooding, such as levies and dams, however sometimes these can fail. Another solution might be inserting piers into a river channel since piers cause scour, and thus increase the depth of the river This experiment focused on which pier shapes would have the greatest overall effect a riverbed as well as which one caused the deepest scour. The hypothesis was that the pier arrangement with the highest drag coefficient would have the greatest overall effect.<br><br> A control test with no piers was carried out three times. Then tests with a row of circular and a test with a row of square piers were carried out three times each. The depth at certain points was measured, input into tables, and graphed. Then an ANOVA test was preformed on the data to analyze the overall effects each pier set up had on the river bed.<br><br> The data showed that the square piers, the piers with the highest drag coefficient, caused the largest amount of deep erosion. The data also showed that circular piers caused the riverbed to widen. The ANOVA tests showed that there was a significant overall similarity between all pier set ups despite differences in erosion patterns. In conclusion the hypothesis that the pier arangement with the highest drag coefficient would have the greatest overall effect was not statistically supported.

WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WIND DEFLECTION AND SOUND REDUCTION OF VARIOUS FENCE TYPES?
Barton August Bone
San Jon High School, San Jon, N.M.

What is the relationship between wind deflection and sound reduction of various fence designs?<br><br>Sound is a form of mechanical energy that propagates through matter as a wave. Sound is characterized by the properties of frequency, wavelength, period, amplitude, speed and is measured in Sound Pressure Levels (SPL). The most common SPL scale is decibels (dBA). Sound waves with frequencies between 20 hertz and 20,000 hertz and greater than 80.0 dBA can be unpleasant to humans. Sound emanating from roadways is at levels between 80.0 to 90.0 dBAs. This noise pollution and prolonged exposure to it can result in hearing loss for residence leaving nearby. <br><br>Sound barriers are used to protect people in residential areas against noise pollution. However, the effectiveness of sound barriers when there is a temperature inversion (which reflects sound over the sound-barrier) is still a problem. Also, wind is a major nuisance in some regions. Designing a fence which provides sound protection as well as wind deflection for residential areas is worth accomplishing. The purpose of this experiment is to determine the relationship between wind deflection and sound reduction of various fence designs and how their effectiveness is affected by temperature inversions. <br><br>The experiment used a model simulation and a simple decibel meter. SPL was measured on a simulated temperature inversion. Fences were tested for wind deflection <br><br>Data indicated the alternating fence design provided the optimal combination of sound protection and wind deflection for residential areas. Further research should include full-scale testing. <br><br>

ACOUSTIC EXCITATION FOR ENHANCING INTERFACIAL DYNAMICS OF MESOBUBBLES
Joline Marie Fan
Upper Arlington High School, Upper Arlington, OH, USA

The standing wave generated in an acoustic field is well recognized to be capable of levitating microbubbles (100 micrometer-2 millimeter). In systems involving mesobubbles (2-8 mm) typical of gas-liquid reactor applications, little is known regarding the ability of acoustic fields in regulating the dynamic behavior of these bubbles. Thus, the problem defined in this study is to understand the acoustic wave characteristics and their interactive behavior with mesobubbles in multi-bubble systems. Engineering goals include devising an apparatus that can utilize acoustic waves to enhance transport properties in both reactive and non-reactive flows. <br><br>The experiments using nickel magnetostrictive oscillators as transducers reveal a significant increase in interfacial activities of the mesobubbles in the presence of an acoustic field. Specifically, with the influence of an acoustic standing wave, the bubble rise velocity decreases, the liquid phase turbulence increases, and the mesobubbles aggregate at the anti-nodal region of the standing wave. A mathematical model that considers various forces including Bjerknes acoustic force can account for the fluctuating rise velocity of a single bubble. There is also an increased oscillatory behavior observed on the bubble interface under an acoustic field. These microscopic behaviors involving the acoustic wave and mesobubble interaction substantiate the macroscopic characteristics of an increased oxygen transfer from water to nitrogen bubbles and an increased ozone reaction with potassium iodide in an aqueous solution. With acoustic regulation, a drag reduction effect is also found in horizontal pipe flows leading to new designs of gas-liquid flow and reactor systems.<br><br>

ADJUSTABLE PROSTHETIC SOCKET
Craig Dean Hawes
Perham High School, Perham Minnesota, U.S.A.

Prosthetics can be a very important part of life. They can help amputees to regain functionality and aesthetics of a complete limb. Young individuals tend to deal with discomfort from prosthetics due to growth. Their prosthesis fits well for a few months, but the prosthesis becomes continually more restricting. Therefore, it is necessary to get a larger prosthesis. However, due to insurance purposes, only one prosthetic device can be prepared each year. To deal with this, the socket is created to allow the residual limb room to grow. This can make the prosthesis uncomfortably loose. However, a year later, the same prosthesis will likely be uncomfortably tight.<br><br>The production of a prosthetic is very expensive and takes at least a month. The development of an adjustable prosthetic socket would reduce fabrication time and cost. To address the problem of uncomfortable fit in the socket, a prototype of an adjustable prosthetic socket was built.

STRONG AS WOOD
Carlos Roberto Rubio
Del Rio High School, Del Rio, TX

The purpose of this experiment was to determine which type of wood and bridge design would support the most weight. I hypothesized that the Warren Through Bridge and that Treated Yellow Pine would hold the most weight. To construct small wooden bridges, I used wood dowels of varying lengths that were arranged into two sets of the Pratt Through Bridge, Howe Through Bridge, and Warren Through Bridge formation designs. These were hot glued at the joints, and additional dowels were hot glued to the corresponding joints of the two sets of each design to form a bridge. Construction paper served as a roadbed; it was hot glued to the bottom connecting dowels. I cut six rectangular blocks made of Holm Oak, Oak, Treated Yellow Pine, Banac, White Fir, and Cedar to be .25 inch thick, .583 inch wide, and 7.25 inches long. I tested the bridges and the blocks using the Structural Stress Analyzer 1000. I then calculated the engineering efficiencies of the bridges. The Pratt Through Bridge held 111 pounds and had an engineering efficiency of 674. The Howe Through Bridge held 134 pounds and had an engineering efficiency of 799. The Warren Through Bridge held 55 pounds and had an engineering efficiency of 308. Oak held 213 pounds. Holm Oak held 216 pounds. Banac held 148 pounds. Treated Yellow Pine held 210 pounds. White Fir held 142 pounds. Cedar held 107 pounds. The Howe Through Bridge and Holm Oak wood held the most weight.

IMPROVED EARLY DETECTION OF DRIVER DROWSINESS
Katherine Marie Vienot
Bartlesville High School, Bartlesville, Oklahoma, USA

ABSTRACT<br><br>The purpose of this project was to enhance the monitoring and early warning function of a previously invented steering wheel circuit that monitors a driver’s movements to determine whether the driver is at risk of falling asleep. Last year, a mechanism / circuit was developed which alerted a driver when the steering wheel was not adjusted for a set period of time. This year, the steering wheel monitoring function was improved upon by determining whether or not a driver was holding the steering wheel. This improvement was added as drivers who are about to fall asleep often relax their grip on the steering wheel. The device is intended to only start once the vehicle reaches a certain speed limit. The following will be checked, assuming the speed is above this value. Monitor the rotational movements of the steering wheel and the time variance between successive movements, as well as the driver’s grip of the steering wheel. If the driver releases their grip of the steering wheel or the rotational variation of the steering wheel within a set time window has ceased, then an audible warning is given to the driver alerting them of impending danger and the need to rest. <br><br><br><br>

ENERGY AT THE SPEED OF WIND
David Quintana
Southeast High School, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA

This expermiment is a continuation project from last year. Last years project was to test energy output of the alternator in an open field for a duration of 12 days and a total of 120 diffrent tests. This years experiment has changed in that the variable being tested is the blade angles on the wind mill blades. What was trying to be found in this experient was "What is the maximum blade angle that will produce the most energy output of ther alternator". The windspeed, 15 mph, was constant through out the whole experiment to decrease incorrect readings. Ever blade was changes to the desired angle and put back on the axle. Next a variable speed shop fan was used to blow 15 mph wind onto the wind mill. Each test was tested twice and then an avergae was taken for every angle. In total there where 24 different angle that where tested. The results of this experiment show that the balde angle of 43 degrees gave the maximum rpms on the shaft an produced the highest energy output.

DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL ANTIMICROBIAL BONE GRAFT SUBSTITUTE FOR CRANIOPLASTY
Catherine Yang Fan
Tom C. Clark High School, San Antonio, TX

The purpose of this project was to produce silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in situ by curing dental resin. Many tests were performed to see whether or not the size, distribution, and release kinetics of the AgNPs would have sufficient bactericidal activity (the antimicrobial study was performed by a professional researcher).<br><br>The light-cure (LC) system and the cold-cure (CC) system were used in order to synthesize AgNPs in different concentrations by weight. Rockwell hardness was done to make sure all the samples cured evenly. In reference to the LC samples anything over a concentration of 0.15% had low readings, while CC samples were pretty much the same regardless of concentration. Transmission electron microscopy was done to visually confirm the presence of AgNPs. AgNPs were found in both LC and CC samples, however nanoclusters were also present. However CC samples had better distribution and much smaller AgNPs. An in vitro release study was also done. The CC system had the best results, since every concentration had some release of Ag ions, while the light-cure system only had Ag ions released after 0.1% Ag benzoate. As a follow up, a professional researcher conducted an antimicrobial study on 0.2% and 0.5% Ag benzoate CC samples. The samples had a 52.4% and a 97.5% inhibition respectively.<br><br>In conclusion, AgNPs were successfully produced with significant bactericidal activity and the CC system turned out to be the best process to use. Future applications of this method can be applied to medical and dental biomaterials that need antimicrobial properties.

DEVELOPMENT OF AN ANTIMICROBIAL ACRYLIC RESIN, YEAR TWO
Catherine Yang Fan
Tom C. Clark High School, San Antonio, TX

Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were successfully synthesized in situ by utilizing the curing process of dental resin in last year's work. Results showed good size and distribution of AgNPs as well as release kinetics. An antibacterial study showed a 97.5% inhibition of bacterial growth. However, the mechanical properties of the dental resin were compromised by the presence of the AgNPs. The purpose of this year's study is to alter the material, by using a new initiator system, in order to achieve mechanical properties better suited for dental resins, while also exhibiting antimicrobial properties. This technology could be used in dental and medical biomaterials to prevent infection caused by bacteria.<br><br> The initiator system with benzoyl peroxide (BPO) and dimethyl-paratoluidine (DMPT) was used in varying ratios to create the resins. This system produced samples that displayed better mechanical properties (supported by Durometer hardness and three-point-bending). The in vitro release study had results that were supported by excellent bactericidal activity when the samples were tested against S. mutans, S. aureus, and E. coli. (antibacterial study was performed by a professional researcher).<br><br> The 0.8BPO:1.0DMPT formulation produced specimen that inhibited the most bacteria, while the 1.6BPO:1.6DMPT formulation produced the strongest specimen. In conclusion, AgNPs were successfully synthesized with the BPO/DMPT system. The new system had better mechanical properties and mechanical properties compared to specimens produced last year. Further tests will need to be done to test biocompatibility and in vivo efficacy.

INNOVATIONS IN REBAR DESIGN: A STUDY OF STRENGTH VS. STRUCTURE
Skyler Thomas Thiel
Isabel High School, Isabel, SD

My project’s purpose was to determine if new innovative rebar designs or standard bar designs have a greater or equal tensile strength to standard rebar. I hypothesized the chain design and solid square design will display similar strength as standard rebar. After drafting new designs and making sketches of standard rebar, I sent my designs to a custom steel manufacturer in North Dakota. I tested standard round rebar, round rebar tubing, solid square rebar, square rebar tubing and my personal chain design. I used a Tinius Olsen machine to test the ultimate strength, yield strength, and rupture point of each bar. I concluded the results did not entirely support my hypothesis. Design A has seemed to withstand the test of time and innovation by remaining the strongest overall design. Despite only minor differences in design, even the next strongest rebar, the solid square tubing, withstood 22% less stress than the solid, round rebar. In addition, my chain design rebar was also significantly weaker. Even though the results disproved my hypothesis, the data still is applicable to people around the world working in construction companies, bridge building corporations, and concrete structure designers. My project helps to illustrate the importance of not only knowing what design elements work but also what innovations are not effective. It is important to recognize that even though an effective standard exists, research must still continue and we must strive to find innovations.

RFID APPLICATIONS TO TRANSFUSION MEDICINE
Alison Mae Stace-Naughton
Robert M. LaFollette High School, Madison, Wisconsin, USA

There is a need to design a safer, more efficient blood supply chain. In transfusion medicine, mistransfusions (mis-match between patient and blood) occur in 1 out of 12,000 transfusions. Reducing mistransfusions was identified by US Department of Health and Human Services and the National Institute of Health as a top-20 national priority. <br><br>The use of radio frequency identification (RFID) in the blood supply chain could provide healthcare entities with a safer and more efficient alternative to tracking blood within the blood supply chain. As opposed to current barcoding technology, which uses light waves, RFID emits radio waves, which eliminates line-of-sight requirements, and allows simultaneous reads of multiple tags. <br><br>Verification of the reliability of RFID throughout the blood supply chain is needed. This research systematically investigates the reliability of RFID with different container types, tag types, and bag orientations. The methodology involves scanning the bags and simultaneously recording the number of tags read in specified time intervals. <br><br>RFID is found to be effective in identifying 100% of the tags as 99.39% of the trials resulted in 100% readability in 60 seconds. Experimentation showed that 56 out of 60 trials read 100% of the tags on the blood bags in less than 60 seconds, leading the researcher to conclude that RFID is reliable. This research illustrates that RFID is a strong alternative as it enhances efficiency and reliability, eliminates barriers with barcoding, and meets national healthcare initiatives. <br><br>

AUTONOMOUS ROBOTS
Collin David Arnold
John Marshall High School, San Antonio TX, United States

This project’s goal was to create a mobile robot designed to autonomously map its environment. After the basic design of the robot was finalized, it was decided that the project consisted of three major components: the mechanical design, the electrical de-sign, and the computer program design. Because these three clear divisions existed, the project therefore progressed simultaneously on all three fronts. This was possible for the most part because the goal for each component was known, so they could be inde-pendently designed without much fear of failure once they were combined.<br><br> Though the specifics of how these sections progressed differ, the basic process re-mains the same. First came the design phase, which included creating models or simu-lations of possible designs for comparison, and much careful discussion with people knowledgeable in the fields applicable. Second came the preliminary test phase, in which portions of the competing designs were constructed and tested to better assess how well they worked, how difficult they were to assemble, etc. In the third phase, the most workable designs were chosen, and the others were set aside for future considera-tion. And finally, the designs were used to build or create the final components of the robot.<br><br> Once all the parts of the robot were completed and combined, the project’s major goal was fulfilled, as well as the majority of the minor goals, such as having the com-puter program completely control the robot’s systems. The project was successful, and the extensive design process proved the key to success.<br><br>

ICING IS SUCH A DRAG: AERODYNAMIC EFFECTS OF ICE ACCRETION ON WINGS AT MULTIPLE ANGLES OF ATTACK
Eric Robert Mueller
Acton Middle School, Granbury, TX, USA

The purpose of this project was to determine the aerodynamic performance characteristics of wings under different icing conditions and varied angles of attack (AOA). Thirty-six experiments were each repeated five times, in order to verify accuracy. Airfoils were constructed with shapes representative of actual fighter, transport, and light aircraft wings. Aircraft icing conditions were simulated using quantified cycles of water spraying and freezing. The wings were tested at speeds of 0-80kph in a precision wind tunnel under conditions of “no icing”, “light icing”, and “moderate icing”. For each icing condition and wing type, lift and drag measurements were recorded at 0, 10, 20, and 30 degrees AOA and room temperatures at approximately 0 degrees C. A total of 200 test runs collected more than 900 data points for the entire experiment. Wind Tunnel Visualization tests were conducted on the wings using dry ice and recorded by a digital camera.The results show, as icing increased, the airfoil lift coefficient decreased by as much as 39%. As AOA increased, the greater the effect ice accretion had on lift. Drag also increased on each wing as icing increased beyond “light icing”. L/D performance of each wing was degraded by up to 50% with “moderate icing”. Visualization tests also supported the wind tunnel data by verifying decreased aerodynamic performance with moderate icing. These results could provide valuable information to engineers regarding future wing design and to pilots by demonstrating the critical importance of avoiding icing conditions.<br><br>

CREATION OF ULTRA HIGH-TEMPERATURE CERMETS: ZRB2 + MO AND ZRB2 + W
Erin Marissa Hopke
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Tech, Alexandria Virginia, USA

Today’s cermets perform inadequately at temperatures higher than 1200C and the materials used in propulsions systems must be able to withstand temperatures that exceed 2000C. For that reason, a new ultra high-temperature cermet must be developed that meets the requirements of propulsion systems.<br><br>The chemical compatibilities of ZrB2 with the refractory metals Mo and W were studied in order to determine the potential for developing ultra high temperature cermets. Previous research indicates that molybdenum reacts with ZrB2 at high temperatures, leaving no pure metal remaining in the cermet. It was hypothesized that if a thin layer of zirconium oxide could be formed on the ZrB2 grains before combining it with the refractory metals, chemical reactions would not occur because ZrO2 does not react with ZrB2 or Mo.<br><br>The cermets with component volume ratios (ceramic: metal) of 66:34 and 50:50 were prepared by hot pressing at temperatures of 1600C and 1900C with 20 MPa of pressure in a carbonaceous atmosphere. Molybdenum completely reacted with ZrB2 forming molybdenum borides despite the pre-oxidation of ZrB2 to form a surface reaction-barrier layer of ZrO2. On the contrary, the ZrB2/W system is more chemically compatible with only very limited formation of tungsten borides at temperatures up to 1900C. Hot pressed samples containing ZrB2 and W had a very high strength (295MPa); hardness (2329 kg/mm²); and when coated with liquid glass containing phosphate, oxidation resistance improved. These results suggest that the ZrB2/W system should be focus of future research for ultra high temperature cermets.<br><br>

CONTROLLED RELEASE OF ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID FROM ACRYLIC POLYMERS
Purnima Malik
Central York High School, York, PA

Prolific pharmaceutical activity is focused on the design and use of transdermal drug delivery systems. This project is a detailed investigation of the diffusion rate of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) from two acrylic adhesive matrices, which is critical to designing transdermal patches. The advantages of transdermal delivery of ASA over conventional routes for preventing thrombosis and coronary disease have been discussed in pre-researched literature. Polymeric adhesive is important component in the construction of patches, because it forms the matrix for carrying the drug while providing intimate contact between the patch and skin. Acrylic polymer-1 was synthesized according to the procedure given in previous year’s project and Acrylic polymer-2 was formulated this year. ASA was incorporated into the polymer matrices to create patches for delivering therapeutic doses. In-vitro extraction experiments were designed to collect 25 data points. Quantitative infrared spectroscopy was used to monitor the amount of ASA released in each extraction experiment. Fick’s law and Higuchi’s drug diffusion models were used to analyze the results. Diffusion coefficients were determined through regression analysis of experimental data by Higuchi’s time-dependent diffusion model, (and planar release model) 6.0x10-11 cm2/sec (8.39x10-11 cm2/sec) for Acrylic polymer-1 and 3.7x10-10 cm2/sec (5.13x10-10 cm2/sec) for Acrylic polymer-2. The diffusion rates were different depending on the chemical constitution of the polymers. Therapeutic amounts of ASA released from both polymer matrices. In the first 24 hours, 23 and 60 milligrams of ASA were released from Acrylic polymers-1 and -2 respectively. Multiple research data suggests that transdermal dose form containing ASA is a viable delivery route.

DOES THE ADDITION OF CARBON NANOFIBER AFFECT THE COMPRESSION STRENGTH OF CONCRETE?
Brigid M Cain
Central Catholic High School, Wheeling, WV

The purpose of this project is to determine whether Pirograph III Carbon Nanofiber enhances the compression strength of cement as a possible replacement for rebar. It is perceivable that carbon-carbon bonds, being the strongest bonds found in nature, could be used to strengthen concrete. If Carbon Nanofiber were found to improve concrete, there would be an increase in demand that could result in more jobs for Americans living in coal-rich states.<br><br> Experimentation was begun by measuring amounts of nanofiber for the specified concentration levels: 0.125%, 0.25%, 0.375%, 0.50%, 0.625%, 0.75%, 0.825%, and 1.0%. (All percentages were based on weight.) Concrete was mixed with the pre-measured concentrations of nanofiber. After the composite was poured into molds and allowed to set, the models were measured and weighed. Lastly, each model's compression strength was measured with an Instron machine.<br><br> Initial data suggests composite samples with higher concentrations (0.75% to 1.00%) of Carbon Nanofiber were less resistant to compression stress. The 0.250% and 0.375% composite concentrations demonstrated an increase in resistance to compression stress. <br><br> Although the test results suggest the addition of higher concentrations of Carbon Nanofiber reduced the compression strength of concrete models, two concentrations, 0.25% and 0.375%, did demonstrate increased resistance. Using these results, the ability of Carbon Nanofiber to increase the compression strength of concrete will be tested in comparison to that of polypropylene, an additive currently being used in industry for its concrete-strengthening properties. This experiment has produced more insight into the properties of Carbon Nanofiber and is a stepping stone to further research and tests.

DEVELOPING A MICROELECTROCHEMICAL SENSOR ARRAY TO DETECT GLUCOSE AND KETONE LEVELS IN DIABETICS
Kristin L. Butler
Hathaway Brown School, 19600 North Park Blvd., Shaker Hts., OH, USA, 44122

This research focused on the development of an array of microsensors to optimize efficiency and ease in diabetic care protocols. For diabetic management, it is desirable to monitor both blood glucose and ketone levels. Therefore, this research focused on the development of accurate, cost-effective glucose and ketone microelectrochemical sensors. The glucose sensor was fabricated using thick film printing technology. The sensor was designed using AutoCAD and was printed onto an alumina substrate using the thick film method. Of the sensor's three electrodes, both anode and cathode were platinum, and the reference electrode was silver-silver chloride. Glucose oxidase was immobilized onto the surface of the sensor using protein cross-linking with glutaraldehyde. This enzyme catalyst sensor measures glucose by detecting the amount of hydrogen peroxide produced in the following reaction:<br><br> Glucose Oxidase<br><br> C6H12O6 + O2 yields C5H11O5COOH + H2O2<br><br>Testing of the sensor varied five concentrations of glucose and analyzed the effects of temperature, pH, and calibration on the most effective sensor. Following this analysis, a final design was chosen and fabricated for the glucose sensor based on accumulated data suggesting optimum accuracy. Subsequently, a similar protocol for the development of a ketone sensor was initiated, focusing on the oxidizing properties of several substances with regard to ketones and maximum accuracy in sensor design. Future testing will reveal the most accurate ketone sensor using data pertaining to concentration, temperature, pH, and calibration.

WHICH TRUSS CAN YOU MOST TRUST?
Nicholas Y Lee
Nicolet High School, Glendale, WI, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine which of three common truss bridges (Warren, Howe, and Pratt) has the greatest load-bearing capacity. This project offered insight into how truss bridges manage the stresses placed upon them and is an extremely relevant study, because lack of understanding involving bridge designs has caused many tragedies that should have been preventable. Therefore it seemed important that the aforementioned designs be tested, especially the Warren and Pratt, both of which are frequently used in today’s structures. Before continuing, it is important to explain what a truss is. A truss is a type of triangular structural framework known especially for its rigidity. It was originally more prevalent in railroad bridges; however, today’s truss is found in many different structures including major traffic bridges and landmarks like the Eiffel Tower. In order to assess the three designs, nine bridges, three of each type, were constructed using basswood and Weldbond glue. Then a Chatillon digital force gauge was used to apply a compressive force on each of the bridges until each broke. During this experiment, the Warren emerged as the strongest design holding an average load of <br><br>10.65 kg. That was 21% greater than that of the Howe and 26% greater than that of the Pratt. The fact that the Warren was able to hold a much greater load than the other bridges can be attributed to its pure triangular design that channeled the force applied on the bridge from one point to two.

EMERGENCY VEHICLE ALERT SYSTEM, PART 2
Justine Alyson Fortier
LaSalle Academy, Providence, Rhode Island, USA

For this project, I attempted to build a device that can detect the frequencies of sirens and warn a driver with hearing loss that a rescue vehicle is approaching.<br><br> During part one of this project, I went to my local fire and police stations to record their sirens. I learned that all the sirens have frequencies between 800 Hz and 1650 Hz. During part two of this project, I built a band pass filter to filter out all of the frequencies not between 800 Hz and 1650 Hz. Before building the circuit, I calculated the size of the resistors and capacitors I would need. I then built a simple band-pass filter using these parts and one op-ampo chip. I used a sound analyzing program and a computer to test the filter. Two audio jacks were used to connect the filter to the computer. One jack went from the computer’s sound input to the filter. The second jack went from the filter’s output to the computer’s sound input. I played the siren recordings and filtered them with the hardware filter, and the software filter. 3D spectrums were made of all the filtered and unfiltered sounds.<br><br> The hardware filter was able to filter out most of the environmental noises. The hardware filtered sound graphs also looked very similar to the software filtered sound graphs. I was also able to simulate the LED display using a moving spectrum of the sirens.<br><br> My hypothesis was supported by the experiment. I was able to build a filter to isolate the siren frequencies and simulate a display which could warn a driver with hearing loss of an approaching rescue vehicle.

DEVELOPING A NOVEL PH BUFFER METHODOLOGY FOR CONCRETE CORROSION
Michael Jeffrey Loy
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland, OR

Concrete deterioration costs billions of dollars each year in the U.S. in repair, replacement, and environmental impact. The major cause of deterioration is corrosion of steel rebar in concrete which occurs when concrete pH is reduced by high acidic attack or when chloride ions penetrate concrete, destroying the natural passivation layer surrounding rebar.<br><br>This innovative study developed a pH buffer methodology to maintain a high pH environment to protect rebar's passivating layer from acidic and chloride corrosion. Previous studies and mitigation strategies have focused on creating additional passivation layers or developing coatings, sealants or coverings for concrete to inhibit corrsion.<br><br>Sodium borate and sodium carbonate based-buffers, both highly alkaline and non-chloride, were mixed into concrete by replacing the mix water with 25%, 50%, 100% concentrations of each buffer, then compared against a non-buffered control. Samples were placed in a 100% carbon dioxide chamber to accelerate acidic corrosion attack and immersed in a 2M sodium chloride solution to accelerate chloride corrosion. The effects of pH buffers on compressive strength, pH levels, half-cell potential, flowability, air content and rebar surface were studied.<br><br>Results indicated that pH buffers maintained high pH and reduced probability of corrosion with sodium borate at 50% the most effective buffer solution, exceeding the control in compressive strength, maintaining consistently high pH, testing second-best in low probability of acidic and chloride corrosion, with moderate flowability. This study supported an efficient, cost-effective, non-toxic buffer technology to extend the service life of concrete, improve durability and promote a sustainable environment.

DESIGNING AND ANALYZING A NEW SHRINKAGE-REDUCING ADMIXTURE
Michael Jeffrey Loy
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland OR, United States

Concrete is the most widely-used building material in the world. The challenge is to design durable concrete which does not crack. Chemical air-entraining admixtures (AEA) are added to concrete to reduce cracking from the freeze/thaw process but increase drying shrinkage, resulting in cracking, thus prompting addition of shrinkage-reducing admixtures (SRA).<br><br> The goal of this project was to design a new, effective, non-toxic SRA, superior at reducing shrinkage because of its low surface tension. A dipropylene glycol-based SRA was formulated by the student, mixed with AEA into concrete then analyzed against concrete mixes of 1) Control 2) AEA-only 3) AEA with hexylene glycol-SRA 4) AEA with neopentyl glycol-SRA for effects on compressive strength, rate of shrinkage, air void quality and air content. Surface tension, slump and unit weight tests were also conducted. <br><br> Of the SRA-mixes, the student-designed SRA had low shrinkage, superior compressive strength and good air quality while non-toxic. Neopentyl-glycol SRA was inferior at compressive strength, similar in drying shrinkage, best at air quality and content but harmful to health and environment. Hexylene-glycol SRA was inferior to the student-SRA in shrinkage and compressive strength and inferior to neopentyl-glycol SRA in air void quality and content while also toxic. Results indicated that lower surface tension correlated to lower rates of shrinkage by retaining water in the capillaries thus reducing drying shrinkage.<br><br> Based upon promising results of the student-designed SRA, further study should analyze the chemical composition and reactions of dipropylene glycol-SRA, without AEA, and vary mix combinations for optimal results. <br><br>

PROLIFERATION AND ALIGNMENT OF OSTEOBLASTS ON ORIENTED MAGNETIC NANOCOMPOSITES
Mary Catherine Chih-Li Wen
Archbishop Molloy High School, Briarwood, NY, USA

Engineering tissue to improve the proliferation and the alignment of osteoblasts on scaffolds for bone grafts can facilitate the healing of fractures and nonunions. Research has shown that strong magnetic loads can stimulate bone formation and orientation along the field, and magnetic substrates have also been exposed to external magnetic fields for biomedical applications such as targeted drug delivery and artificial implants. Studies have also shown that mimicking the topology of an extracellular matrix with an electrospun scaffold enhances the structure and adaptation of the tissue. Combining these aspects, MC3T3 osteoblast progenitors were plated on magnetic and diamagnetic surfaces of different topologies and cultured both with and without an external magnetic field. Four materials were created, 100% EVA 260, 90% EVA 260 with 10% Cloisite 20A, 90% EVA 260 with 10% Cloisite 20A:Iron Pentacarbonyl in a 1:1 ratio by mass, and 90% EVA 260 with 10% Cloisite 20A:Iron Pentacarbonyl in a 1:2 ratio by mass, and formed into three configurations: bulk disks, electrospun mesh fibers, and electrospun aligned fibers. Vibrating Sample Magnetometry, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, Thermogravitometric Analysis, and Dynamic Mechanical Analysis determined the mechanical and magnetic characteristics of the materials. Cell counts and confocal microscopy investigated the proliferation and alignment of the osteoblasts on the magnetic nanocomposites. The study indicated that a biologically and mechanically compatible paramagnetic nanocomposite was created from electrospun aligned fibers of 90% EVA 260 with 10% Closite 20A:Iron Pentacarbonyl in a 1:2 ratio cultured in a magnetic field with the potential to accelerate fracture healing.

LONDON BRIDGES
Iola DorElla Danesha Edwards

Abstract<br><br> My project involves the design and rebuilding of the Yellow Church Bank Campground Bridge. My question is how I can redesign a present day bridge to hold its full potential weight. By changing the design I hope to meet my goal.<br><br> In order to complete my project I needed to build a scale model of the original bridge and test the amount of weight held by that one in order to get more accurate results I made two models of the original one. The main load on the bridge was three buckets of sand hanging from the bottom and then weights were placed on the bridge itself. During testing observations were used, such as looking the way it was bending and looking at the pieces after it was broke. This allowed me to think what changes can be made when constructing the new design. I constructed my new bridge off of the pros and cons from the original design. I also used my observation notes from the testing, and the research of other bridges. The results of the test came to be that the original design came to be that the average was 7.5 pounds and the weight for the new design was about 18 pounds total. My new design came out and stronger. In real life there are pros and cons about this bridge, it would cost more, taxes could go up, and it would take a longer time to redesign. <br><br>

DESIGNING AN OPTICAL SENSOR TO EASILY DECIPHER THE RELATIVE LONGEVITY OF A HIGH PRESSURE SODIUM LIGHT THROUGH SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
Carl Anthony Turner
New Prague High School, New Prague Minnesota, United States

High pressure sodium lighting in the choice endurance light in the industry, especially in utility lighting purposes. A problem with high pressure sodium lighting is the way in which they fail. Unlike incandescent bulbs, they cycle instead of “burning out”. This cycling will eventually destroy either the ballast or starter, causing repair work to be preformed on key components instead of replacing a simple light bulb. This adds significant cost in both equipment and labor. <br><br>My project was to invent a solution to this problem. Using digital photography, I was able to study an alteration in the power spectral distribution of high pressure sodium lights from new to old lights. With this change I was able to take a ratio between two parts of the visible spectrum. This ratio would then tell the relative age of the light. With the correct implementation of this device, a very significant amount of money could be saved in efficiency and equipment costs. A utility would take a survey of their high pressure sodium lights each year and then would know which lights are most likely to fail within a specific time period. Using this process, scheduled maintenance could be completed instad of the current method of replacement by failure. With millions of high pressure sodium lights across the country, this inexpensive and simple device will revolutionize the way that high pressure sodium lights are maintained. <br><br>

ENERGIZE: OPTIMIZATION OF A PROCESS TO DETERMINE ALGAL SPECIES PRESENT IN A SAMPLE PRIOR TO FERMENTATION THROUGH SINGLE-STRAND CONFORMATIONAL POLYMORPHISM
Charlotte Sophia Kirk
Westville High School, Westville, OK

The small sub-unit of ribosomal RNA is highly conserved in eukaryotes; it also has variable regions that could be used to differentiate among species. Determining the variable regions along the gene and designing oligonucleotide primers to anneal to those variable regions would utilize this gene for the differentiation of eukaryotic species by using single-strand conformational polymorphism and DNA sequencing. In the research performed here, algal species were used. Oligonucleotide primers were created for two variable regions along the small ribosomal sub-unit, and a polymerase chain reaction process was optimized. The PCR products were purified and single-strand conformational polymorphism was used to determine the population diversity in a sample of algae based on the conformations of the algal DNA. This process could be used prior to the fermentation of algae into butanol in order to predict fuel yield or to determine the presence of any algal species toxic to the fermenting microorganisms.

IMPROVING DAMAGE TOLERANCE IN FIBER-REINFORCED COMPOSITES: A STUDY OF HARDENING AGENTS EFFECTS ON POLYMER PERFORMANCE
Rachael Nicole Wood
Trinity School of Texas, Longview, TX

In the field of polymer engineering, when trying to magnify the desired property other desirable properties are generally reduced or lost. By using a mixed hardener, the goal of this project is to create an epoxy polymer that takes advantage of the desired property from multiple hardening agents yielding an easily reproducible, inexpensive to manufacture polymer that retains toughness at high temperatures.<br><br> Molds were casts of four different hardners with the epoxy resin DER 383. Three samples were made of a different individual hardners with the DER 383 and the fourth was a mixed hardener EP101 composed of all three. These samples were cut, tested and examined under a scanning electron microscope. Flexure, heat deflection and barcol impressor hardness tests were performed. The tests were selected to evaluate the specimens for toughness, temperature performance and for consistency of cure throughout the sample. Scanning electron microscopy was used to determine where the fracture initiated, direction of crack propagation and to see if the specimen failed prematurely due to an introduced flaw during the manufacturing process.<br><br> The results demonstrates that it is possible to manufacture an epoxy polymer that retains the desired properties of temperature performance and toughness. The epoxy polymer was easy to manufacture, was reproducible and the manufacturing process was not cost prohibitive. This supports my hypothesis that a toughening mechanism can be created that does not degrade temperature performance and retains toughness by use of a mixed hardener.

EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE, PH, AND ULTRASOUND ON TIMED RELEASE ALGINATE MICROSPHERES
Nabeel Riyaz Vira
John Jay Science and Engineering Academy, San Antonio, Texas, United States

This experiment was designed to investigate the release rate of alginate microspheres using a surrogate active ingredient (AI), Crystal Violet dye. Temperature, pH, and ultrasound were the variables applied to the alginate microspheres to test the AI release rate. The hypotheses state that as temperature increases, the release rate of the alginate microspheres increases; as pH increases, the release rate decreases; and the release rate increases with increasing exposure to ultrasound. The morphology of the microspheres was designed with alginate, a polysaccharide derived from brown algae, and Crystal Violet dye. Droplets of the alginate mixture were submerged into a Calcium Chloride (CaCl2) solution to form the microspheres. The CaCl2 solution was then drained to isolate the microspheres. These microspheres were then placed into various baths with the applied variables. Once the beads remained in the bath for a designated period of time, aliquots of the solutions were collected and monitored for spectroscopic analysis.<br><br> In conclusion, the release rate increased as temperature increased caused by an increase in thermal degradation; the critical point occurring between 90C to 100C. The pH experiments were proven incorrect for pH values 2 to 6. However, for pH values 8 to 12, the hypothesis was proven correct: the release rate increased as pH decreased, ultimately affecting the glycosidic linkages. The release rate of the AI in the ultrasound bath at 40 kHz decreased with time in relation to the microspheres with no ultrasound due to the increasing interaction of alginate and Crystal Violet dye with ultrasound.

A NOVEL SOLUBLE PENTACENE PRECURSOR: SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATION
Garrett Nathaniel Traub
Ossining High School, Ossining, New York, USA

A method for synthesis and application of a relatively high performance, alcohol soluble pentacene precursor is described. The Diels-Alder adduct of N-sulfinylbutylcarbamate and pentacene is shown by IR-spectroscopy, UV-visible spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis to undergo a retro Diels-Alder reaction to convert into pentacene at low temperatures. (120º C) This adduct is soluble in a variety of environmentally friendly solvents such as alcohols, and is the first organic semiconductor to exhibit this property. This represents a substantial improvement over previous methods of processing pentacene, which required chlorinated solvents that have been shown to be harmful to the environment. Thin film transistors fabricated by solution processing (alcohols) of this novel pentacene precursor, followed by thermal conversion to pentacene, have shown respectable field-effect mobilities near 10^-1 cm^2 * V^-1 * s^-1 and a current modulation of 3.9x10^4. Since the precursor can be processed in alcohol while retaining a high field-effect mobility, it uniquely matches the requirements for large-area electronics and all-organic integrated circuits using modern patterning techniques such as inkjet printing or microcontact printing.

SOLID FREEFORM FABRICATION OF H13 TOOL STEEL
Wenqiang Yue
Tullahoma High School, Tullahoma, TN

The purpose of the study was to determine the processing conditions under which solid freeform fabrication can create three dimensional "UT" logos from AISI H13 tool steel powders. The outline of the "UT" logo was drawn in AutoCad and loaded into SCAPS software that controls the solid freeform fabrication machine. A series of trial runs were performed from different combinations of laser beam power, scan speed, powder mass feed rate and argon flow rate. Robust "UT" logos were obtained after processing the powders with a 180 watt laser beam, focused into a 0.45^2x(pi) square millimeter spot, rastered over the powders at 20 mm/s. Under aforementioned conditions, an 80 micrometer thick layer of laser-melted and resolidified material is deposited every 5 seconds. The powder feed rate was set at 25 g/min. Forty millimeter tall "UT" logos were fabricated under these conditions and then sliced into 2mm thick samples for demonstrative purposes.

DETERMINING TENSION AND DRAG AND LIFT COEFFICIENTS FOR THREE SIMPLE PARAVANE DESIGNS
Martin Jordan Minot
Central Virginia Governor's School for Science and Technology/ E.C. Glass HS, Lynchburg, VA

The purpose of this project was to test the tension produced by three types of simple stabilizing paravanes. The experiment tested three simple paravane designs—Michelsen, Seward, and Silvia—for drag at four different speeds. The study was conducted in December 2008 at the Smith Mountain Lake, Virginia. To determine the tension of the paravanes each design was towed beside a small boat and a force gauge was attached to the end of the tow line. One-way ANOVAs were conducted at each speed and statistical significance was observed at all speeds as all of the p-values were less than 2.05*10^-22 (alpha = .05) and tukey tests showed significant differences between every design at each of these speeds. Also, the data were graphed as a function of speed to compare the paravanes graphically. According to this graph the Silvia design produced the least tension throughout. Thus the hypothesis was not supported as the Silvia design, with its simple, surface area based design, produced the lowest tension figures. Also, tension was decomposed into drag and lift and these measurements were used to determine dimensionless drag and lift coefficients for each design. The results taken together showed that Silvia was the most efficient of the three and hydrofoil based paravanes, like the Michelsen design, are not as effective as surface area based designs like Seward and Silvia.

VIABILITY OF A PHOTOINDUCED ELECTRON SPIN ALIGNMENT CREATING A MAGNETIC EVENT IN A POLYMER
Michael Vincent Di Mascio
Waynesville High School, Waynesville, OH

Traditional methods of storing data are quickly approaching the limits of their capability. Computer systems store data using binary code, however, they are expensive and have finite data granularity. It was hypothesized that a blue laser could store/read data on a polymer with none of these problems potentially present. A novel solution polymerization process was discovered to synthesize 8 poly(methylmethacrylate) PMMA thin-film 1 cm squares using PMMA powder, toluene, and manganese ions. The Faraday Effect, B = theta/VI, was used to store/read data on the polymer samples after blue laser (405 nm in wavelength) irradiation. A cross polarization apparatus measured the voltage intensity as a function of the polarization change theta (minutes of arc) of the laser light. A Babinet Soleil Compensator was tuned to shift the state of polarization (sop) of the blue laser to a specific interval of 2° from 38-52° for each sample in a magnetic field B of 1119.4 G. The Verdet constants V (min of arc/G-cm) were determined to be exactly 0.0018 for each sample, where the apparatus measured polarization changes as small as 0.0005°. The length I of each sample was determined to be 165 micrometers using a laser diffraction technique. Then each sample was irradiated for 15 minutes using the blue laser. At each sop, the blue laser induced a magnetic field greater than 1119.4 G in each sample via photoinduced charge transfer between the MMA and manganese molecules. These results prove the hypothesis was correct. Data represented by any value of polarization from 0-360° can be stored on a polymer using a laser where the encoded data has much greater granularity than binary systems of 1s and 0s. Further research could focus on developing computer systems using photoswitchable polymers.

EFFECT OF AUTOMOTIVE EXHAUSTS ON PROTON EXCHANGE MEMBRANE FUEL CELLS
Jonathan Brandon Burke Cross
Robinson Secondary School, Fairfax, Virginia, United States of America

Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) have been widely researched as replacements for automotive internal combustion engines. Existing research has focused almost exclusively on the effect of impurities on the hydrogen (anode) side of PEMFCs. Little has been devoted to studying the effects of automotive air pollutants on the oxygen (cathode) side. This investigation examined the effects of such automotive pollutants on PEMFC electrical performance, and the effectiveness of a simple filtration system.<br><br> Tests on two PEMFCs, with and without charcoal filters, were conducted using an automated test device. Electrical performance was measured by the decrease in voltage over time. Baseline tests used ambient air as the oxygen source, while remaining trials used diesel or gasoline exhausts pumped to a hood over the air intake.<br><br> Statistical analysis of eight baseline tests showed that the fuel cells were stable on ambient air, while seventeen trials on automotive exhausts showed 0.4 to 8.8% per minute degradation in performance, and increasingly erratic behavior over time. Filters reduced degradation effects by 26% to 85%. Upon return to ambient air, about 96% of initial capacity was recovered.<br><br> This investigation is significant because it clearly demonstrated automotive exhausts can seriously degrade PEMFC performance, and that full capacity is not restored even when ambient air is restored -- raising questions of how permanent the effects might be. Furthermore, it demonstrated that filtering systems can somewhat mitigate these effects. Clearly air pollution poses a serious threat to commercialization of automotive fuel cells, and additional research is urgently needed.

EVALUATION OF MICRO-LASER TECHNOLOGY FOR HIGH-SPEED INFRARED DATA NETWORKS
Michael "Scott" Haney
Oakton High School, Vienna, VA, USA

Future networks will require bandwidths of 1Gbs or more. Current optical wireless systems are power inefficient and do not reach this bandwidth. This experiment has one objective: To determine if new micro-laser technology could be utilized to fix this problem.<br><br> First, measures were taken to ensure that background light/noise, stability (both physical and electrical), and eye safety were at a premium for testing purposes. It was found that the instability and background noise were minimal, and that the beam posed no risk to eye safety. Next, individual VCSELs (Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers) were lit up and the light intensity pattern was recorded in increments of 1 cm squared. This pattern was then compared to the Gaussian beam model (a model showing the theoretical light intensity pattern for lasers). The patterns were found to be generally Gaussian in shape, but spikes in light intensity altered some beams, giving them a distinctive multi-mode behavior.<br><br> It was then necessary to test the procedure's repeatability. In order to accomplish this, the detector was kept in one spot for twenty minutes, and the light intensity was recorded every minute. The detector was also moved back and forth to around one spot to determine if the array and collection apparatus were physically stable. It was determined that the experiment was repeatable, and that the error was minimal.<br><br> The procedure for evaluating micro-laser technology for high speed networks has been demonstrated in this project, and it has been determined that micro-laser technology is a good candidate for solving the problem of slow networks. Microlaser arrays could be employed in many optical wireless systems to increase the bandwidth of these systems.<br><br>

EVALUATION AND MEASUREMENT OF THE FRICTIONAL PROPERTIES OF GRAPHENE BY ATOMIC FORCE MICROSCOPY
William B Kalb
Horace Mann School, Riverdale, NY

Graphene is formed of single-atom thin sheets of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal pattern. Its unique shape makes graphene almost as strong as diamond and allows for novel micromachinery applications as a lubricating material. In this study, the frictional properties of graphene samples were analyzed using contact atomic force microscopy with graphene samples overlaid on silicon wafers, as friction is understood on a macroscopic scale but is not well explained at the nanometer scale. The aim was to assess the relationship between the number of graphene layers and the frictional reduction and to assess the effect of the underlying substrate on the frictional properties of the overlaid graphene. A forty-fold reduction in frictional forces was measured when monolayer graphene was compared to bare substrate and further reduction in frictional forces was measured between mono- bi- and tri-layer graphene. This trend was reversed for thicker graphene. Quantitative frictional measurements of graphene suspended across small apertures were unobtainable, despite attempts to modulate tip force to reduce material strain. The major conclusion was that the frictional reduction was optimized at three atoms thickness, though a further reduction between 3 and 10-atom thickness could not be excluded. Absence of underlying substrate reshaped the graphene, limiting frictional assessment by AFM. These results are interesting because graphene’s frictional properties change even though surface composition does not. One explanation for the friction of graphene overlaid on a substrate is that thin layers cling tightly to the substrate under electrostatic forces, picking up the substrates’s surface irregularities.

THE POWER OF PITCH II: INVESTIGATING THE USE OF A VARIABLE-PITCH WIND TURBINE TO OPTIMIZE POWER OUTPUT UNDER VARYING WIND SPEEDS
Galen Daniel Maly, Yorktown High School
Arlington, VA, United States

The overall purpose of this experiment was to determine if a variable-pitch wind turbine is more effective than a fixed-pitch turbine in converting the kinetic energy of wind into electrical power. This was achieved by testing the following hypotheses: the higher the blade pitch, the lower the wind speed needed to spin the blade, but lower-pitch blades spin faster at higher wind speeds; rotor RPMs are directly related to power output; maximum power output at a given wind speed occurs when the angle of attack on the blade is about 15 degrees; power output can be maximized by varying pitch; a computer program can be written that uses RPM input to adjust pitch for maximum power output; and a program can be written to maximize output based on wind-speed.<br><br> A variable-pitch wind turbine with computer-controlled servos was designed and built. The turbine’s rotor was connected by a belt to a direct-current motor, which served as the electrical generator. A multimeter measured power output. Four different computer programs were written in Interactive C to adust pitch. The turbine was tested in a wind tunnel and using a high-velocity fan. Wind speeds ranged from 4.5 to 14.3 meters per second. Light-emitting diode sensors fed RPM and wind speed data to the microcontroller. Blade speed was calculated from RPMs, and this allowed the resulting wind and angle of attack to be calculated. The results supported all hypotheses except the last one. The microcontroller had insufficient processing power to read and respond to real-time wind speed. High-pitch blades spin at lower wind speeds because of drag. Low-pitch blades spin faster because of lift. A fixed-pitch turbine is like a 21-speed bike stuck in one gear: It is either hard to get moving, or it will not move fast. A variable-pitch turbine can “switch gears” to take better advantage of drag, lift, and varying winds, and it is therefore about three times more powerful.

GENERATION OF ELECTRICITY FROM ALGAE IN MULTI-ORGANISM HYDROGEN FUEL CELL BIOREACTORS
Daniel Morgan Scott
Benjamin Franklin High School, Portland, OR

Through the combination of two structures, this bioreactor design produces electricity through by products of the metabolic pathways of Scenedesmus algae. This species of algae engages in photosynthesis during light conditions, producing hydrogen an anaerobic environments, as well as starch. During the night, this starch is metabolized, producing additional hydrogen. Besides this primary organism, the presence of several other cultures is being tested in order to synergisticly cycle nutrients. Hydrogen gas produced via this procedure feeds a hydrogen fuel cell which uses a catalyst to separate electrons from hydrogen, which combines with oxygen to form pure water. Several different bioreactor permutations were tested, in order to study the efficiency of two iterations of the fuel cell, and the effect of various additional organisms on the efficiency of hydrogen production. A finalized version of this reactor would utilize not only photosynthetic energy, but chemical energy from household compostable biomatter to produce hydrogen with the assistance of specific photosynthetic bacteria that made use of the alga's byproducts.

Beaumont School, Cleveland Heights, Ohio, USA

Long-term microgravity induces bone loss in astronauts and animals sent into space. During long duration space missions, astronauts develop sufficient osteopenia to make the occurrence of a bone fracture under normal loading highly likely. Published studies indicate that fracture healing is impaired in actual and simulated weightlessness environments. Thus, bone fractures incurred during long duration space flight will be impaired and could lead to a fracture non-union. <br><br>One possible solution is intermittent parathyroid hormone therapy, an FDA-approved treatment for osteoporosis. In published studies, when used in deep space missions, intermittent PTH therapy shows reduced hind limb bone loss in tail-suspended rats, and enhances the amount of bony callus tissue surrounding tibial fractures in rats.<br><br>Osteotomies were performed by a post-doctorate fellow in both fibulae of fifteen rats, which were subjected to simulated weightlessness via an approved hind-limb suspension model. The healing response was observed by means of micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) imaging. Analysis of x-ray attenuation determined the volume of the healing callus, volume of cortical bone being produced, and the formation rate over a five-week period. Overall, there was a moderate increase in the fracture healing response of the treated rats versus the control group, but the response was not normalized relative to that of normal gravity. Also our study noted that increased doses of PTH did not correspond to increased healing response beyond a certain point. The healing response increased relative to dosage with respect to callus volume and formation rate, however the cortical formation dropped as dosage increased. <br><br>

THE GOOGLER
George Francis Hotz
Bergen County Academies, Hackensack NJ, USA

The Googler is a robot that seeks out objects. In order to do this it needs a picture of the object and the GPS coordinates of the object. This information is fed into an onboard Linux computer over a wireless link. When the robot is activated, it doesn't know which way it is facing. Using the GPS it finds which direction is north. Then it knows which direction it has to travel to get to the coordinates. It navigates to them by using onboard infrared sensors. Once the coordinates are reached it searches for the object with the two onboard quickcams. When a lock is established on the object, it travels to a distance of 1 ft away by using the disparity map from the two cameras. It picks it up with the robotic arm and brings it back to you(it could also be programmed to do other things). This can all be watched over from a webpage which displays coordinates of the robot, distance to the object, locations of walls and other obstacles, and a live webcam feed. Such a device has many practical applications. The military could use it to seek out mines. Birdwatchers could use it to track birds. Owners of warehouses could use it to take inventory. It could be used to chase geese on the side of airport runways. It could help people in bookstores find the book they are looking for.

THE EFFECT OF VARIOUS ELECTROMAGNET VOLTAGES AND PAYLOAD WEIGHTS ON THE SPEED AND ACCELERATION OF AN URBAN MAGLEV VEHICLE
Michael John Fraser
Yorktown High School, Arlington, Virginia, USA

Maglevs (magnetic levitation vehicles) could offer a more environmentally friendly and economic alternative to existing urban rail transportation systems. This experiment studied the effect of varying propulsive voltage and vehicle payload on the speed and acceleration of an urban maglev vehicle. It was hypothesized that increasing the propulsive electromagnet voltage, for a given payload weight, would show an increase in speed and acceleration, whereas increasing payload weight, at a set voltage, would cause a decrease in speed and acceleration.<br><br> An elevated bi-directional brass track was constructed (1.05m long) with strip magnets for levitation mounted on seven support masts. Seventy propulsive electromagnets were built and installed above the track. Control circuitry, incorporating optical switches, was mounted on the support masts. Test circuitry, batteries, and volt and ammeters were built into a container. For testing, propulsive voltage was varied and weight was continually added in 7g increments. Times across the track were computer-recorded for each voltage/payload weight combination. Calculations to obtain speeds and accelerations were made.<br><br> The main effects of propulsive electromagnet voltage and payload were statistically significant (Two-Way ANOVA, p <= 0.05). At each payload weight, average speed and acceleration increased with propulsive voltage. At each voltage, average speed and acceleration declined as payload weight increased. The hypothesis was supported. Based on scaling the vehicle, all but the lowest voltage/payload combinations exceeded FTA guidelines for vehicle acceleration. Maximum required acceleration was achieved at the minimum operable voltages. The results suggest an urban maglev would have lower costs than other rail-based systems.<br><br>

EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT TYPES AND SIZES OF RECYCLED PLASTICS ON THE STRENGTH OF CONCRETE
Ryan Elmer Headrick
Seckman Senior High School, Imperial, MO

The purpose of this study was to continue on last year’s study in determining the effect of plastic fiber additions on the strength of concrete. Last year different amounts of plastic fibers were added to concrete and the concrete's compressive strength was measured. The study was expanded upon by adding different types and lengths of fibers. Also, tensile strength was measured as well as compression strength to give a better view of the effects.<br><br>To perform this 0.45g of each of six different groupings of plastics were added to six different batches of 45g of concrete. After mixing, the concrete was cast into molds and let to cure for seven days. After seven days, the concrete brick and cube molds were demolded. The concrete bricks and cubes were tested for compression strength in a cold crushing machine and tensile strength in a Modulus of Rupture(MOR) testing machine. While MOR does not offer an exact measurement of tensile strength it is the best estimate when working with concrete. <br><br>In contrast of expectations, it was found that all the plastics except the HDPE 1.5" group decreased the tensile strength of the concrete. However, opposite of what was expected and what normally happens there was an increase in compression strength for the HDPE 1” and HDPE 1.5" group. Fiber lengths also tested were the HDPE 1.5” group which experienced an increase in both compression and tensile strength, but the HDPE 1” group had the largest increase in compression strength. To further investigate the effectiveness of recycled plastics as an additive in concrete, more tests need to be performed involving real world situations. Also, the toughness should be measured using a fracture toughness test.

CHARACTERIZATION OF IONIC POLYMER METAL COMPOSITE (IPMC) FORCES AND MOVEMENT
Robert Brik
Mills E. Godwin High School, Richmond, VA

The purpose of the research was to fabricate Ion Polymer Metal Composite (IPMC) actuators and model the movement of the IPMC material. An IPMC actuator is a relatively new type of smart material which bends when voltage is applied. IPMCs are lightweight, easily scalable, and function efficiently under low voltages. An IPMC-based robot can be used to swim through the body or move objects in space. By understanding the critical factors in controlling IPMC material, better performing IPMC-based systems can be produced.<br><br> There are three main parameters that affect IPMC performance: coating, voltage, and oscillation frequency. IPMCs with different coatings were tested under varying voltages to understand generated forces. Experimental results showed that the gold coated sanded IPMC at 3.5 V and 0.5 Hz achieved the largest displacement and generated the greatest force. Therefore, the research hypothesis of 2 Hz and 3.5 volts exerting the greatest force was not supported. Video analysis of the IPMC movement under various frequencies and voltages was performed. The results indicated that IPMC movement can be modeled by an elliptical equation: (x - a)2 / a2 + (y)2 / b2 = 1. An Analysis of Variance Test showed that the data was statistically significant, and the null hypothesis of no significant difference between displacements and velocities was not supported with a probability of error below 0.001. The research characterized IPMC movement and consequently allows for more efficient application of IPMCs to robotic grippers, swimming robots, medical devices, and a wide variety of other applications.

USING ACETONE BASED ELECTROSPUN NANOFIBERS TO PRODUCE INEXPENSIVE WATER FILTRATION SYSTEMS.
Joseph Patrick Pudelka
North Toole County High School, Sunburst Montana, United States of America

The purpose of this project was to use a process known as electrospinning to create nanofibers capable of removing microorganisms from water at a low cost. To run electrospinning an apparatus had to be built. This was then wired up to high voltage needed for electrospinning. I produced these nanofibers and incorporated them into a filter. To test these filters E. Coli was inoculated in sterile nutrient broth and was allowed to grow for twenty-four hours. This solution was then tested in a spectrophotometer for transmittance. Comparing this with the transmittance after filtration is proportional to the percentage of bacteria taken out. However, due to the gelatin in the nutrient broth these filters clogged up. That is why the rest of the filter is needed. To test the nanofiber filter alone a solution had to be made so that the bacteria would not rupture. A solution of 5% glucose to sterile water was then made and E. Coli was added. This solution was then run through my nanofiber filters and the transmittance was taken before and after. However, the nanofibers filters were not effective in taking out bacteria. After this experiment, I tested my entire filter with pond water. The same method with the spectrophotometer was used. My entire filtration system with the nanofibers changed the transmittance of the pond water from about 91.8 to 98.8 percent. Hopefully, with further experimentation and with different variables applied a cost effective filter that will produce clear, safe drinking water could be produced.

THE CREATION OF A BIOPHOTOVOLTAIC DEVICE UUSING THE PS-I COMPLEX STABILIZED BY PEPTIDE SURFACTANTS
Erin Elizabeth Perry
Elko High School, Elko, NV

Photosystem I (PS-I) is a chlorophyll-containing membrane complex that captures the light energy from the sun by an internal large antenna system. This photosystem complex was isolated from the thykaloids of spinach chloroplasts using a chemical detergent. Subsequently, several methods were used to stabilize the protein complex. These included the use of Triton X-100, biological lipids, and peptide surfactants of 7-8 residues. The peptide surfactant I6K2 was designed to mimic phospholipids (a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail) and extend the backbone of the protein complex through hydrogen bonding. The protein complexes were placed inside an electrophoretic chamber in a buffer solution with an electrolyte. Stabilization methods were compared to determine the optimum surfactant to prevent denaturation of the proteins while still not impeding on the photosynthetic functions of the protein complex. The PS-I complexes stabilized with I6K2 experienced a photosynthetic rate (measured by the amount of oxygen produced through water splitting) 3 times that of the PS-I complexes with no stabilization method. However, when placed in a solution with the electrolyte NaCl, generators containing the peptide surfactant conducted the lowest amount of electricity. This suggested a failure of the electrolyte to transfer electrons. The electrolyte KI was utilized in a second trial. The generator containing the peptide surfactant stabilization conducted twenty times the voltage of the generator with no stabilization. This success could be attributed to the easy oxidation of iodide to iodine. Although a wet battery was created, this methodology could be applied to create small dry batteries using PS-I complexes.

BIO PRINTING
Montana Duke Wilson
Wolf Point Junior/Senior High School, Wolf Point, MT

Today there are more than 40,000 people who are added to the United States organ transplant waiting list each year. At the most, there are 16,000 deaths that could allow for organ donation to those 40,000 people. This project in its present form is the result of experimenting with bioengineering technology. An investigation was conducted on the affect of an inkjet printer’s accuracy to place cells in a designated area in order to create an organ. The initial idea of this project was to reverse engineer an inkjet printer, which would print cells to test if the cells could survive the printing process. Some success was met during the experimentation when the inkjet printer successfully printed a bacteria culture. <br><br> The bacteria culture was tested in three different types of bio-ink, which were methylene blue, regular printer ink, and plain cells. The three bio-inks were then placed into ink cartridges, and then printed onto biofilm. After the bacteria were printed, it was determined that they were alive by using an ultraviolet light, after a 24-hour incubation period.<br><br> Anomalies in the first printer design were detected when constructed. The first printer’s design was flawed because when constructing it, the stepper motor was damaged. Therefore, a new design was introduced, when I removed the bottom of the printer’s base to accommodate the biofilm.<br><br> The benefit of this project is that the cells started to automatically sort themselves out by a natural sorting process.

TESTING SOLAR CELLS FOR SPACE APPLICATIONS: PHASE I
Ernestine Chaco
Navajo Preparatory School, Farmington NM, United States

A significant factor of a solar cell is the durability when the solar cell is in a space environment as opposed to a baseline solar cell that is on earth. Companies throughout the world have undertaken the challenge of creating a cell that has high efficiency and yet is inexpensive to manufacture. Currently, the Ultra-light weight Flexible Thin Film solar cells are the leading candidates. For space applications, solar cells need to be tested to show that they will have the capability to survive harsh space environments. A cell has to be able to function in extreme temperatures (-194°C to 160°C) and have the ability to convalesce after it has been exposed to radiation for a long duration of time.<br><br>This study’s objectives were to subject low cost thin film cells to proton radiation tests, which simulate 15 years in space and to measure their performance before and after the proton test using a solar simulator. Results indicate that the damage done to the cell by the proton test did not significantly damage the cell as indicated by the 4.5% drop in maximum power (Pmp); whereas, a silicon solar cell, subjected to the same conditions, drops on average of 15% in maximum power (Pmp). The study’s conclusion illustrates that these thin film cells have a great potential to be highly efficient solar cells for space applications. <br><br>

SYNTHESIS OF CUPRIC OXIDE (CUO) NANOSTRUCTURES FOR GAS SENSING AND CATALYSIS APPLICATIONS
Nandini Venkateswaran
Herricks Senior High School, New Hyde Park NY, USA

The study of nanostructured metal oxides has been a subject of intense research due to their applications in electronics, mechanics, and sensing. Cupric oxide (CuO), a narrow band gap, p-type (1.2eV) semiconducting oxide is drawing increasing interest due to its versatile properties. Its compositional simplicity, strong electron-electron correlation, and monoclinic structure render it an optimal candidate for applications in nanodevices, catalysis as well as for studying its cryogenic gas sensing characteristics. <br><br> The primary purpose of this study was to synthesize novel CuO nanostructures for gas sensing and catalysis applications. In the first two facets of the study, the electrospinning and oxidation heat treatment methods were investigated for the synthesis of CuO nanostructures. The products were CuO nanogrids, novel CuO nanostructures composed of networks of continuous, self-supported, 3-dimensional particles, crystals and nanorods, providing increased surface area, durability, porosity, and extensive open networks tunable for multi-functional sensor technologies and catalyst development. In addition, new methods were discovered to increase nanowire length and density grown on copper substrates that could contribute to the development of novel nanowire sensors. Lastly, the sensitivity of the nanostructures in detecting gases and chemical species was explored. The CuO nanostructures, by exhibiting fast response time to ammonia gas, pose as effective CuO based gas sensors that can detect 50 ppm of ammonia gas at room temperature (25¢ªC). The structures created are useful in understanding the capability of nanostructured polymorphic oxides to be molded into novel catalysts and advanced chemosensors that can be exploited in nanomedicine and sensor development.<br><br>

OPTIMIZING TASK EFFICIENCY RELATIVE TO MONITOR ORIENTATION
Colin T Millar
University School of Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI

Laparoscopy, a surgical technique, employs a video camera inserted into small incisions, displaying the procedure on a monitor. Surgeons tend to look down at their hands while preforming procedures, but laparoscopy forces them to look forward towards a monitor. Surgical efficiency decreases with two-dimensional images and unnatural monitor placement. This study's hypothesis predicts the optimal monitor placement will emulate one's natural line of sight (Surface 180°).<br><br>For Experiment #1, an apparatus was contructed to evaluate the effect of monitor orientations and dual-camera that increases depth perception. 50 subjects threaded a needle three times with direct vision (control) and with a video camera using six monitor orientations (Front 90°, Angled 120°, Surface 180°, Right 90°, Left 90°, Front Dual 90°). For single-monitor and dual-camera orientations, both Angled 120° (averaged 13.74 seconds to thread) and Front Dual 90° (11.53 seconds) yielded optimal efficiency. To assess task repetition, ten subjects threaded ten times successively and efficiency gradually increased as anticipated.<br><br>In Experiment #2, an automated monitor angle adjustor with electronic timing system was constructed. A computer interface automatically set monitor angles and recorded times using a modified needle and wire thread to determine optimal subject angle. 25 subjects were electronically timed at seven angles (90°, 105°, 120°, 135°, 150°, 165°, 180°). Results on efficiency reflected that a unique optimal angle exists for each subject.<br><br>The monitor angle adjustor, computer interface, and diagnostic procedure can be applied to surgical devices, optimizing efficiency in surgical simulation, laparoscopic surgeries, and video camera-assisted procedures in any field.

REFINEMENT OF SOLAR CELL MORPHOLOGY IN BULK HETEROJUNCTION NANOPARTICLE POLYMER COMPOSITES
Mubarrat Nuvid Bhuiyan
Jericho Senior High School, Jericho, NY

Polymer solar cells are the future of flexible, lightweight, user-friendly solar devices. To construct a more cost-effective nanoparticle polymer composite (polymer solar cell), this study had a dual focus: 1) to produce a columnar structure by employing a novel blend nanocomposite and 2) to confine electron-accepting nanoparticles to polymer-polymer interfaces. Improving morphology is the key to improving solar cell efficiencies. Solutions of polymers, polystyrene (PS) and poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT), and electron-accepting nanoparticles, phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), were prepared and films were spincast on silicon substrates. Samples were studied using the AFM, ion mill, TEM, and ellipsometer. AFM images of 90:10 PS:P3HT blends revealed appropriate lateral phase separation and degree of immiscibility. Increasing the molecular weight of PS (from 62K to 123K) increased interfacial tension, inducing greater immiscibility and more robust columns. After 90 s of sputtering, in films that began at ~100 nm columns spanned through the film. Reductions in interfacial tension and images via TEM detected nanoparticle confinement. An innovative equation relating free energy, interfacial energy, and nanoparticle concentration was modeled to explicate nanoparticle confinement. Lastly, samples after annealing accurately declined in interfacial tension, stabilizing the ordered morphology. Future research entails power conversion testing, and use of focused ion beam to validate the internal structure. This study not only revolutionizes solar cell research by using blend nanocomposites of PS:P3HT:PCBM, but also succeeds in improving the nanomorphology of bulk heterojunction solar cells to enhance solar cell cost- efficiency and viability.

A FARADAY EFFECT OPTICAL MODULATOR FOR USE IN THE DETECTION OF RADIOFREQUENCY ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES
Mark Philip Croce
Langley High School, McLean, Virginia, USA

Conventional antenna designs are poorly suited to ultrawideband and spread-spectrum wireless technologies due to their frequency-dependent efficiency. In this project, a novel optical antenna, utilizing the Faraday Effect to detect the magnetic field component of a radio signal, is explored both in theory and in a proof-of-concept experimental setup. The Faraday Effect occurs to some degree in all optically transparent materials, causing the material to become optically active in the presence of an applied magnetic field and rotate the plane of polarization of a polarized source. The magnitude of the rotation varies with the strength of the applied magnetic field, not the frequency of the field. This characteristic makes the Faraday Effect ideal for detection of wideband RF signals. An experiment was designed to demonstrate the practicality of this concept. Using readily available materials, a Faraday Effect modulator was constructed to determine if the effect was indeed measurable in the presence of a small magnetic field. A pair of polarizers, acting as an analyzer, was used to detect the rotation of the plane of polarization of a laser diode source. A photodiode was used to detect the change in transmitted intensity through the analyzer, and this output was amplified. The experiment was successful: even in a crude homebuilt setup, the Faraday Effect was visible. Theoretically, the effect can be created in a micro-scale solid state device to create a fully functional wideband optical antenna. As proven in this project both theoretically and experimentally, a Faraday Effect optical antenna is a new kind of antenna technology that can greatly improve the performance of ultrawideband and spread-spectrum RF systems.

DESIGN AND SYNTHESIS OF A POLYVINYL ALCOHOL HYDROGEL FOR CONTROLLED RELEASE OF PHOSPHATE
Alexandra L Ghaben
Central York High School, York, PA, USA

Phosphate fertilizers contribute to environmental harm, due to pollution from manufacture, and eutrophication of lakes by algae that thrive on phosphate runoff from over-fertilization. The purpose of this study was to slow the release of phosphate by use of a Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) hydrogel. <br><br>First, twenty five hydrogels were synthesized and characterized . Fifteen were made by physically crosslinking 5, 10, 13,15 or 20 wt% solutions of 88% or 99+% hydrolyzed PVA, and drying at 22 or 50°C. Ten were made by chemically crosslinking 88% or 99+% hydrolyzed PVA with phosphoric acid for 0.5, 1, 3, 5 or 7 hours. All hydrogels underwent gravimetric swelling and force tests, and diffusion and swelling characteristics determined. One hydrogel from each crosslinking method was selected for phosphate release testing.<br><br>Next, physically crosslinked hydrogels containing 1-50 wt% of powdered phosphate were fabricated using the selected physical crosslinking method. Cumulative phosphate release into water was tracked spectrophotometrically, and compared to the release of the same amount of phosphate released from dialysis tubing. The results showed that PVA hydrogels effectively control release of phosphate both in the short (5 hr) and long (500 hr) term. Specifically, the average phosphate release after 5 hours using PVA hydrogels was 28% of that of the control. Also observed was that increasing phosphate concentration changes the diffusional exponent (and consequently the structure of the polymer) from Anomalous type diffusion to Case II. Similar trends characterized the release of 5 and 10 wt% of phosphate from the chemically crosslinked hydrogels tested.<br><br>

REPAIRING AMERICA'S AGING CONCRETE HIGHWAY BRIDGES WITH CEMENT BIO-COMPOSITES
Raymond Tan
William Mason High School, Mason, OH

America’s aging concrete highway bridges need to be repaired in time to prevent further deteriorations which may pose as public safety hazards or even cause traffic disasters. The objective of this work is to determine if cement bio-composites may be used for rapid repairing of the concrete bridges, providing fast curing for minimal traffic closures while maintaining the cement strength properties. It is hypothesized that cement may form composites with biomaterials such as wood sawdust powders, rice or rice starch powders. It is further hypothesized that the cement bio-composite may be reinforced with cross-linking polymers, such as the polyisocyanate glue, for fast curing and strength build-up.<br><br>It was found that cement bio-composite made from 1% sawdust powders which were cross-linked with polyisocyanate, accelerated the cement curing by 50% while maintaining the strength properties. This may lead to practical applications. Cement bio-composite made from rice starch powders which were cross-linked with polyisocyanate demonstrated excellent physical strength, but the curing and hydration was retarded too much to be practical. Adding sawdust or rice particles directly into cement, without cross-linkers, decreased the compressive strength properties in all cases. Without cross-linkers, the curing was retarded as well when the sawdust addition levels exceeded 2%. Adding polyisocyanate alone (without biomaterials) could speed up the cement curing substantially, but surprisingly the cement strength properties completely diminished.<br><br>A mechanistic model has been proposed to explain these findings, especially the synergistic effect by the cross-linking polymers and the sawdust particles.

DESIGN AND SYNTHESIS OF A POLYVINYL ALCOHOL HYDROGEL FOR CONTROLLED RELEASE OF PHOSPHATE
Alexandra L Ghaben
Central York High School, York, PA, USA

Phosphate fertilizers contribute to environmental harm, due to pollution from manufacture, and eutrophication of lakes by algae that thrive on phosphate runoff from over-fertilization. The purpose of this study was to slow the release of phosphate by use of a Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) hydrogel. <br><br>First, twenty five hydrogels were synthesized and characterized . Fifteen were made by physically crosslinking 5, 10, 13,15 or 20 wt% solutions of 88% or 99+% hydrolyzed PVA, and drying at 22 or 50°C. Ten were made by chemically crosslinking 88% or 99+% hydrolyzed PVA with phosphoric acid for 0.5, 1, 3, 5 or 7 hours. All hydrogels underwent gravimetric swelling and force tests, and diffusion and swelling characteristics determined. One hydrogel from each crosslinking method was selected for phosphate release testing.<br><br>Next, physically crosslinked hydrogels containing 1-50 wt% of powdered phosphate were fabricated using the selected physical crosslinking method. Cumulative phosphate release into water was tracked spectrophotometrically, and compared to the release of the same amount of phosphate released from dialysis tubing. The results showed that PVA hydrogels effectively control release of phosphate both in the short (5 hr) and long (500 hr) term. Specifically, the average phosphate release after 5 hours using PVA hydrogels was 28% of that of the control. Also observed was that increasing phosphate concentration changes the diffusional exponent (and consequently the structure of the polymer) from Anomalous type diffusion to Case II. Similar trends characterized the release of 5 and 10 wt% of phosphate from the chemically crosslinked hydrogels tested.<br><br>

REFINEMENT OF SOLAR CELL MORPHOLOGY IN BULK HETEROJUNCTION NANOPARTICLE POLYMER COMPOSITES
Mubarrat Nuvid Bhuiyan
Jericho Senior High School, Jericho, NY

Polymer solar cells are the future of flexible, lightweight, user-friendly solar devices. To construct a more cost-effective nanoparticle polymer composite (polymer solar cell), this study had a dual focus: 1) to produce a columnar structure by employing a novel blend nanocomposite and 2) to confine electron-accepting nanoparticles to polymer-polymer interfaces. Improving morphology is the key to improving solar cell efficiencies. Solutions of polymers, polystyrene (PS) and poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT), and electron-accepting nanoparticles, phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), were prepared and films were spincast on silicon substrates. Samples were studied using the AFM, ion mill, TEM, and ellipsometer. AFM images of 90:10 PS:P3HT blends revealed appropriate lateral phase separation and degree of immiscibility. Increasing the molecular weight of PS (from 62K to 123K) increased interfacial tension, inducing greater immiscibility and more robust columns. After 90 s of sputtering, in films that began at ~100 nm columns spanned through the film. Reductions in interfacial tension and images via TEM detected nanoparticle confinement. An innovative equation relating free energy, interfacial energy, and nanoparticle concentration was modeled to explicate nanoparticle confinement. Lastly, samples after annealing accurately declined in interfacial tension, stabilizing the ordered morphology. Future research entails power conversion testing, and use of focused ion beam to validate the internal structure. This study not only revolutionizes solar cell research by using blend nanocomposites of PS:P3HT:PCBM, but also succeeds in improving the nanomorphology of bulk heterojunction solar cells to enhance solar cell cost- efficiency and viability.

EFFECTS OF RECYCLED PLASTICS ON STRENGTH OF CONCRETE
Ryan Elmer Headrick
Seckman Senior High School, Imperial, MO

The purpose of this experiment is to find an inexpensive and environmentally friendly additive for concrete. Most concretes today use special made fibers of either plastic or steel as an additive. You should be able to use recycled plastic bottles that have been chopped up as an additive for concrete.<br><br> For this experiment thirty-five cube samples of MORCO Dura-Floor concrete were cast at Missouri Refractories Co., Inc. The thirty-five samples were cast in five different batches of seven samples each. Each batch was cast with either: 0% recycled plastic content, 0.5% recycled plastic content, 1.0% recycled plastic content, 1.5% recycled plastic content, or 2% steel fiber content (base for MORCO Dura-Floor concrete). After casting, the samples cured for three days, and then using an ELE International concrete crushing testing machine, the strength was tested with a cold crushing strength test. <br><br> Strength testing suported my hypothesis as the concrete became weaker by a small amount as plastic was added. Although the plastic content weakened the concrete, the plastic also made the concrete hold together better. For example, when the concrete with no plastic or steel in it broke, it fell apart fairly easy, but when you added in plastic it held together very well. So even though the strength decreased, the concrete was very difficult to pull apart because of all the fibers holding it together. Now, when the steel fibers were added, the concrete increased in strength and held together even better than the samples with plastic fibers. So, while yes, the plastic can act as an additive and still have a usable building material, it is not as effective as the normal steel fibers used in MORCO Dura-Floor concrete.

RARE EARTH FIBROUS OXIDES AS SELECTIVE EMITTERS IN THERMOPHOTOVOLTAIC ENERGY CONVERSION
Shrey Prashant Shah
Saint Ignatius High School, Cleveland, OH

Thermophotovoltaic energy conversion utilizes a system consisting of a heat source, selective emitter, and a photovoltaic cell, and entails the conversion of thermal energy into electrical energy. At high temperatures, when heat passes through the selective emitter, photons are given off. This radiation is most often infrared or near-infrared and is converted by the photovoltaic cell into electricity. The traditional emitter, called a blackbody or greybody, has an extremely wide emission spectrum. Because photovoltaic cells can only utilize radiation at certain bandgaps of energy, most of the photons (95%) given off by the blackbody go unused, causing enormous waste and making the process cost-inefficient. In the research project, ceramic oxides were doped with the rare earth elements erbium and ytterbium and used as the selective emitters. Er2Ti2O7, Yb2Ti2O7, Er3AL5O12, and Yb3AL5O12 solutions were mixed with PVP, electrospun into nanofibers, and subsequently annealed at high temperatures to pyrolize the organic materials. They were tested as selective emitters in a simulation of a thermophotovoltaic device, and their emission spectra were collected and analyzed for efficiency. While the Yb2Ti2O7 and Yb3AL5O12 nanofibers did not even have a recognizable emission spectrum, the Er2Ti2O7 nanofibers outperformed the Er3AL5O12 nanofibers. The results showed that erbium doped nanofibers are efficient as selective emitters in thermophotovoltaic systems, and are a drastic improvement over the traditional blackbody emitter. These selective emitters could be used in real-life electricity generation systems, including a system in a car that could utilize waste heat to produce electricity for various subsystems.

ABSTRACT AERODYNAMICS: GOING WITH THE FLOW
Christopher Ernie Lopez
Taos High School, Taos, New Mexico, USA

The car industry has been hard pushed to design and manufacture asthetically nice vehicles that are more aerodynamically efficient, thereby increasing their fuel efficiency. The purpose of this project is to design and prepare six different car models with different features impacting aerodynamics involving drag coefficient, drag force and Reynolds number. It is hypothesized: (1) that as the car's shape is streamlined then its drag coefficient (Cd) and its drag force (Fd) will decrease when tested in a computerized wind tunnel, and (2) the smoother the car model surface the better the fluid flow, which is evident by a higher Reynolds number and Log Reynolds number.<br><br> To perform this project the models were placed in a wind tunnel at a zero degree angle of frontal wind attack. They were tested for their aerodynamic properties at four wind velocities (15, 30, 45, and 60 mph) at four different model sites (front, hood, cab & rear).<br><br> It was observed that car model #4 had the lowest Cd and the lowest Fd, indicating a better streamline design and a clean airflow current that followed the car's contour. The pattern was evident at all four wind velocities, ranking this car model first. Car model #2 had the highest Reynolds number and Log Reynolds number. This indicates that it had the slickest and smoothest skin finish because it had the lowest fluid stickiness rating. <br><br> The data collected and interpreted has led to the following conclusions: Car model #4 had the lowest Cd and Fd and therefore was the most efficient aerodynamic designed model. It had little air flow stagnation. The data analysis also proved that car model #2 had the smoothest design evident by the highest Reynolds number and Log Reynolds numbers. This data collected and interpreted then supports both hypotheses as presented and are therefore accepted. The dream car design would have the lowest Cd and Fd and the highest Re #'s.

MICROBUBBLE CHARACTERIZATION FOR DRAG REDUCTION IN PIPE FLOWS
Joline Marie Fan
Upper Arlington High School, Upper Arlington, OH, USA

Drag reduction using microbubbles is noted for ship hull applications with appreciable effects. However, under significantly different flow conditions such as in a pipe flow, little is known regarding its microbubble drag reduction effect. Thus, the hypothesis is that the use of microbubbles, which are less costly and more environmentally friendly compared to the use of chemicals, could yield a drag reduction effect in a pipe flow. The engineering goals are to explore the underlying mechanisms governing the microbubble-wall surface interaction and drag reduction behavior and to probe different microbubble injection techniques and their feasibility for drag reduction applications for pipe flows. The data indicate that the hydrophobic surface would be more effective than the hydrophilic surface in microbubble drag reduction. Effects of microbubbles, which reduce the skin friction and dampen the turbulent eddies, are manifested in a fast settling velocity of a particle with microbubble generation in a liquid Microbubbles generated from the Alka-Seltzer“ coating and the gas ejector yield a significant drag reduction effect affirming the hypothesis of the microbubble drag reduction effect in a pipe flow. The studies further indicate that for effective drag reduction, microbubbles are required to be 100-300_m in diameter, which is consistent with my analysis of the length scale of the turbulence structure in the wall region of a pipe flow. Based on the mechanical energy consumption analysis of a flow system with gas ejectors, there is a considerable advantage of energy saving in adopting gas ejector devices for industrial pipe flow applications.

A MOLECULAR AUTOMATON WITH BUILT-IN VISUAL DISPLAY FOR FILOVIRUS IDENTIFICATION
Julia Elizabeth Poje
Valley Stream South High School, Valley Stream, NY

Deoxyribozymes, enzymes formed by DNA, have promise for a wide variety of functions because of the fact that they are easily customized as logic gates. One of the most promising applications of these gates is as a simple and effective virus detector. The goal of this project was to design an automaton for use as a novel detector for Ebola (EBO) and Marburg (MBG), the two viruses of the filovirus family. <br><br>Several YES gates targeting each virus were designed and tested for functionality and kinetics. The gates were tested using safe, synthetic DNA with filovirus sequences rather than the actual viruses. The results showed that the gate YES EBOb had a turnover per hour of 38, and YES MBGb had a turnover of 40/hour. These two were chosen to be used in the creation of an ANDNOT gate, EBOb ANDNOT MBGb, which was ultimately used for EBO detection. YES MBGb was used for MBG detection and the NOT portion of EBOb ANDNOT MBGb. The two gates cleaved two differently labeled fluorescent substrates, one of which emitted green fluorescence (Yes MBGb) and one which emitted pink fluorescence (EBOb ANDNOT MBGb). The two gates were arranged on well plates so that if EBO was detected, the assay would show an E, and if MBG was detected, the assay would show an M. <br><br>Tests revealed that the detector was effective – with EBOb input, the automaton displayed a pink E, and with MBGb input, a green M was present. Based on the success of this detector, the next step would be to improve the sensitivity of the detector and optimize if for longer inputs.

THE DETECTION OF ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE USING AN ELECTROCHEMICAL SENSOR
Joanne Helen Wang
Hathaway Brown School, Shaker Heights Ohio, USA

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme that is a biological marker for various diseases, primarily bone and liver disease. Normal levels of ALP range from 25-100 IU/L, and concentrations outside this range generally indicate disease. Electrochemical detection of ALP requires a complex, two-step reaction, involving two separate enzymes and a change in pH from 10 to 6.5. In addition to developing an electrochemical sensor, a greatly simplified process of detection was derived in a single-step approach. ALP’s substrate, phenol phosphate, was decomposed, and its product, phenol, was oxidized and reduced to generate a current for detection. The sensor had a silver-silver chloride reference electrode and carbon working and counter electrodes. Cyclic voltammograms were taken in both in a -0.2~0.6V scanning window at 38°C, using a CH Instruments, Inc. electrochemical analyzer. The oxidation peak currents of the graphs of the stock solution before and after the addition of ALP were compared. The differences between the oxidation peak currents quantified the amount of ALP present and demonstrated a linear relationship between current and concentrations of ALP, from 28.57-171.42 IU. The sensor developed is cost-effective, practical, highly-sensitive, disposable, and successfully detected varying concentrations of ALP in a single-step reaction at 38°C. Future research involves reducing size, increasing sensitivity, making the sensor wireless. Human blood samples will also be used as test samples. ALP is one of three enzymes in the liver that are typical markers for disease; sensors for the enzymes glutamate oxaloacetic transaminase and glutamate pyruvate transaminase may also be developed.

DEVELOPMENT OF A TERNARY MANIPULATION FOR FUEL DISPLAY AND ANALYSIS
Sarah Narceille Vaden
Staunton River High School/Ronoake Valley Governor's School, Moneta Virginia,USA

Liquid hydrocarbon fuels have beneficial applications in hypersonic aircraft, which necessitates its replacement for hydrogen fuel. Extinction limits were collected by the experimenter using an opposed jet burner. The data collection and initial analysis proved ineffective at displaying the effect of all species and flame strengths involved for ternary mixtures in a singular location. <br><br> A ternary manipulation was developed to accommodate ternary compositions by imposing an equilateral system on a standard xy-axis. Percentage levels of the compositions were denoted by linear functions equidistantly spaced between the vertexes-100% composition- and opposing base-0% composition- and the plotting point of a fuel mixture was determined by the intersection of the three fuel lines. This system was then used to determine alternate surrogate compositions for hydrogen in fueling a scramjet vehicle.<br><br> It was hypothesized that the ternary manipulation system would be able to produce fuel compositions, with an ethylene composition within 10% of the 60% ethylene in the original surrogate, at 150 cm/s Uair. The compositions produced were, in percent ethylene, methane, and heptane respectively: (62%, 32%, 6%), (64%, 33%, 3%), (64%, 19%, 16%), and (67%,17%, 16%); all supported the hypothesis except for the last, which was just outside the 10% requirement. It was also hypothesized that the ternary system would produce at least one fuel replacement for the ethylene-methane-ethane fuel system, based solely on binary flame strength relationships. It was supported with the intersection of a surface representation of the data with a z-plane of 150 cm/s, along the 66% ethylene fuel line. <br><br>

NXTBOOST: THE NEXT GENERATION CHILD BOOSTER SEAT
Nicholas Samir Ekladyous
Cranbrook Kingswood Upper School, Bloomfield Hills, MI

Every year, scores of children under the age of eight die in automobile accidents. 40% of these fatalities occur in side impact accidents. There are no government safety standards for booster seat safety performance in side impacts. There are no adequate child booster seats on the market today with regard to side impact protection. Additionally, current booster seat designs allow for out of position (OOPS) error states, which increase the likelihood of injury in an accident. A new child booster seat designed around biomechanical principles of occupant kinematics was created to maximize child safety in side impact accidents.<br><br>A crash test matrix was created using three crash modes: side impact, frontal impact, and oblique impact. Conventional seat designs were compared to a new booster seat design, nxtBoost. Analytical crash analysis tests based on the Hybrid III 6 Year Old ATD were conducted using PC-Crash 3D. PC-Crash 3D results were also used to compute Injury Assessment Reference Values (IARV): Head Injury Criteria (HIC), Neck Injury Criteria (Nij), Chest Acceleration (G’s), Chest Contact Forces, Head Excursion, and Knee Displacement. 3D Finite Element Analyses were conducted to optimize the final design configuration. Weight and cost were minimized. The Hybrid III 6 Year old test dummy and nxtBoost prototype were built. <br><br>nxtBoost outperformed existing booster seats because of direct support for the head, neck, and shoulder, as well as even distribution of force across the chest. nxtBoost proved safer in all seven IARV categories evaluated. nxtBoost successfully prevents OOPS error states and rollouts.

USE BLACK TO KEEP YOUR TEETH WHITE: THE EFFECT OF VARIOUS LIGHT TYPES ON THE ABILITY TO DETECT SIGNS OF DENTAL CARIES
Vina Phuong Nguyen
Hayfield Secondary School, Alexandria, VA

The purpose of this project is to find a means for early detections of dental caries (tooth decays) and to minimize the use of harmful X-rays at dentist offices. I employed a scientific method, which is observable, measurable, and repeatable, to examine the effect of various light types on the ability to detect signs of dental caries.<br><br> I conducted an experiment by taking pictures of six series of different light types, which consisted of seven trials of different human teeth. I used light sources, their placements, and filters, to take each picture in one of the following six combinations: visible reflected, near-infrared reflected, black light (near-ultraviolet) reflected, visible trans-illuminated, near-infrared trans-illuminated, and near-ultraviolet trans-illuminated lights. I used a photo editing software to open each image, selected a tool that displayed the three red, green, and blue (RGB) color values of a picture element, and recorded the RGB values of a lesion spot and a healthy spot on a given tooth. The higher the contrast, the better the detection could be.<br><br> I tabulated the data on a spreadsheet, calculated the averages and the contrast between the lesion and the healthy spots, and plotted a graph. I ran my data through two statistical analysis tests--One-Way Analysis of Variance Test and Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference Test--to make sure that my data could be accepted and trusted, respectively.<br><br> The result clearly supported my research hypothesis: the black light would be the best light type for detecting dental caries on the enamel surface.

EMERGENCY VEHICLE ALERT SYSTEM, PART 3
Justine Alyson Fortier
LaSalle Academy, Providence, Rhode Island, USA

The purpose of this project is to design and build a device that will detect the frequencies of sirens and warn a hearing impaired driver of an approaching rescue vehicle. My design consists of a bandpass filter, an amplifier with a gain of 200, a VU meter chip, and a bar of ten LED’s. The focus of this project is to get a bar of 10 LED’s to turn on in sequence when a siren is detected by the device. <br><br> The filter is built to isolate the siren frequencies (800Hz-1650Hz). The VU meter chip is used to determine the number of LED’s which will turn on depending on the volume of the siren. signal. An audio amplifier with a gain of 200 is also incorporated into the circuit to strengthen the input signal in order for it to be strong enough to light the LED’s. A microphone is used as the signal input to the filter to take in all surrounding sounds.<br><br> I tested the circuit by playing recordings of rescue vehicle sirens. The microphone was able to pick up these sounds, and the LED’s turned on in sequence. I also played other recordings with frequencies outside of the 800Hz to 1650Hz range, and observed little to no response from the LED display. This proved that the bandpass filter is filtering out a significant amount of the unwanted frequencies. The results from my experimentation support the idea that this device can be built to help hearing impaired drivers.

DESIGN AND USE OF AN IMPACT RESPONSE DEVICE TO ASSESS STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY
Devin John Roach
Saint Pius X High School, Albuquerque, NM

Recent catastrophes have shown that weathering, fatigue loads, and other environmental conditions can create damage in critical structures. Millions of people trust buildings, bridges, ships, airplanes, and roller coasters to operate safely. The purpose of this project was to design and test an instrumented impact test method that can detect structural flaws. By combining an accelerometer with an impact device it was possible to produce a sensitive instrument and an inspection method that produces a better understanding of a material. A Duration of Impact (DoI) parameter became the basis of the impact test device. Trial tests on simulated corrosion, erosion, crack, and disbond flaws in structures showed that such flaws could be detected by this impact test device. The performance of the device is improved if the DoI data is plotted to produce a two-dimensional response image of the structure. Different stiffness areas (flaws) produce different DoIs and can be imaged in “C-scan” plots. An experiment was conducted where corrosion flaws were placed in aluminum test specimens. Experimenters were trained to use the impact test device and then asked to locate the hidden flaws. It was determined that the impact test device could reliably detect these flaws. The computer-generated images improved the presentation of data and thus, improved the detection of flaws. Not only could smaller damage be reliably detected using these C-scan images, but also the false calls were greatly reduced. The instrumented impact test device is portable, easy-to-use, and can be applied to many structures to ensure safety.

HYDROCARBON PRODUCTION THROUGH ELECTRICAL IONIZATION
Arthur Joseph Petron
Dallastown Area High School, York PA, United States

Hydrocarbon fuels provide seventy percent of the United States’ electrical energy and virtually all our energy for transportation and heating; demand continues to increase. Hydrocarbon production through electrical ionization of inorganic compounds could alleviate strain on mined sources. This project addresses the synthesis of hydrocarbons at atmospheric pressure in a formation chamber of novel design.<br><br> The experimental method was tested in a chamber engineered such that the air inside could be displaced with a pure atmosphere of hydrogen gas, deterring oxidation for safety reasons. Suspended in this atmosphere are two carbon rods that, when arced over an 8.00 minute reaction time, generate heat, ionizing both hydrogen and carbon, forming hydrocarbons.<br><br> The resulting atmosphere in the chamber was analyzed with a Hewlett Packard G1800C Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS) and a Hewlett Packard 5890A Flame Ionization Detector Gas Chromatograph (FIDGC). Confirmation of hydrocarbons of level C5 and below was determined in peaks that eluted at the same time on the total ion current plot of the FIDGC. Evidence of dodecane appeared in the mass spectrograph of the largest eluted peak.<br><br>The FIDGC graphs were analyzed for reproducibility by assigning a signature number to each graph resulting in comparable signature values, yet independent of the volume of analyte injected. The experimental results have an average deviation of 5.20%. The results of experimentation and analysis show that hydrocarbons can be manufactured through electrical ionization and can potentially act as an ancillary source of hydrocarbon fuels.<br><br> Future experimentation will determine the economic feasibility and yield per unit energy of this type of hydrocarbon production. More trials will also be completed to validate the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the data.<br><br>

BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE (BCI) P300 SPELLER PROGRAM: MAZIMIZING CLASSIFICATION PARAMETERS
Sarah Ann Anderson
Columbia High School, East Greenbush NY, United States

A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a device allowing paralyzed individuals to communicate with their surrounding environment using only their brain signals. The P300 Speller application of the BCI utilizes a specific time-locked signal- the event related potential (ERP)- to allow users to make selections from a flashing matrix containing letters and numbers. The rare flash (2 of 12) of the row and column holding the character that the user is focusing on creates an ERP which is used by the computer to select the correct character.<br><br> Because each user has unique brain signals, the P300 speller must classify each user’s data. Improving the methods used to derive the classification coefficients (CCs) would improve the accuracy of the program. A user completes multiple sessions using the P300 speller, and CCs are derived using a subset of that data. It’s currently unknown which session(s) produce CCs that best classify the rest of that user’s data. To determine this, I used differing amounts of data from various sessions to generate CCs using a stepwise linear discriminant analysis (SWLDA). When applied to the same test sessions, it was found that data sampled from many sessions produce CCs that classify the test data more accurately than CCs derived from data sampled from a single session. Results show that when using the SWLDA, no single method of choosing a data subset for CC derivation produces markedly high accuracy for P300 BCI users; thus, P300 spelling proficiency levels directly relate to the ability of the user.<br><br>

CAN RECYCLED PLASTICS BE USED TO REDUCE LANDFILL WASTE, HELP IMPROVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF BUILDINGS, ROADS, HIGHWAYS AND BRIDGES AND REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS?
John Charles Boykin
St. Peter Chanel High School, Bedford, OH

Abstract<br><br>Recycled high density polyethylene plastic (HDPE) was tested in structural concrete to see if recycled plastics can be used as an additive to improve properties in concrete, reduce environmental waste in landfills and reduce greenhouse gas. Consumer waste containers of HDPE were obtained, reduced in size and shape to a powder particle by shredding and pulverizing. The recycled plastics were cleaned, measured, weighed and prepared for testing. The recycled plastic and concrete mixtures were tested under many conditions that included, heat, freeze, chemical testing, environmental testing, gas, solvent, boiling, impact and crush test. The tests were run ten times for repeatability and reliability. The tests were run against a control. The test results indicated that the recycled plastics did not reduce the chemical and structural properties of the concrete. The recycled plastic improved the absorption rate of the concrete by 3 %, improved the heat carrying capacity of the concrete by 9% and the slump test increased by 1 inch. Based on the results, the use of recycled plastic, HDPE, used as an additive in concrete improved or maintained many of the physical properties which indicate it can be used to improve the infrastructure. In using the recycled plastics before it is discarded into the landfills will reduce the amount of waste and the number of landfills that are generated. Reusing recycled plastics will help reduce greenhouse gas generation by reducing industrial burning.

A MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC DIRECT CURRENT TRANSFORMER
Elizabeth Van Cortlandt Varela
West Potomac High School, Alexandria Virginia, United States of America 

This experiment explores the field of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), the interaction between a conductive fluid and electromagnetic field. Traditional transformers use alternating current input to generate a moving electromagnetic field that can induce output. To create a direct current (DC) transformer, mercury was used as a mobile conductive fluid, breaking up the permanent magnetic field induced by the DC input, and in turn inducing alternating current output. This experiment is the first MHD transformer employing an accumulator (separating electrode output from mercury pump)allowing innovative use of coil and electrodes in series. The experiment tests whether use of a mercury coil, used as primary and alternatively secondary coil, will generate electricity in the secondary coil. The end-end coupled transformer is made up of one mercury and one copper coil. A mercury pump, pressure regulator, accumulator, and cooling system were designed and implemented. Electrodes were implanted within the coil to deliver input and retrieve generated output electricity. Step-up and step-down transformations were performed, AC and DC input supplied, and permanent magnets with and without electrical input were used in trials to test generated current output. Output was smaller than expected due to leakage flux, resistivity, and low mercury velocity, but improves with new nontoxic MHD alloys. This is the first DC transformer of its kind.

OPTIMAL DESIGN FOR MINIMIZING STRUCTURAL WIND LOADS IN HURRICANE PRONE REGIONS
Kirsten Marie Boardman
Orion Jr High School, Ogden, UT

Primary hurricane damage mechanisms are wind induced loads that exceed structural capabilities, and flooding. This work investigated effects of a structure’s lift and drag characteristics to determine optimal design approaches for minimizing overall wind loads. Models were constructed to conduct wind tunnel experiments from which lift and drag coefficients were calculated. Axial drag force data was obtained at a constant wind speed of 44.8 ft/sec for basic roof and wall designs including the classical gable with eaves, gable, hipped roof, flat roof, and profiled walls with conical roof (yurt). Lift force data was obtained for roof pitch angles of 0, 15, 25, 35, and 45 degrees. Calculated lift and drag coefficients showed that yurt like structures result in the least drag. High roof pitch angles produce the least lift. Measured lift and drag coefficients were used to scale up wind loads to an average full scale house. Analyses showed that the effective hurricane intensity at constant wind speed, as indicated by the Saffir-Simpson scale, can be reduced approximately two Categories by selecting yurt like design approaches over the typical gable with eaves approach. Such reductions in wind loading (approximately 35% at high wind speeds) offer the potential for minimizing structural damage and subsequent flooding caused by wind driven rain. This work has application to design of housing in coastal regions that may be subjected to damaging hurricane winds, particularly in lesser developed countries.

ALIGNING SILICON NANOWIRES FOR USE IN NANOELECTRONIC DEVICE FABRICATION
Peter James Mintun
Hawken School, Gates Mills, OH

Nanowires are likely to be important components of the transistors and other nanoelectronic devices of the future. However, these nanowires must be manipulated with extreme precision and accuracy to construct functional devices. This work focused on methods of manipulating nanowires at the nanoscale, to compare the effectiveness of three general alignment techniques: fluidic flow alignment, mechanical transfers, and dielectrophoretic alignment. For the fluidic flow method, we pumped nanowire solution, produced via sonication, back and forth through a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), microchannel, heating the solution to evaporate it and deposit nanowires onto the chip substrate. Although this technique produced alignment rates as high as 60%, the process was too difficult and overcomplicated to easily and efficiently repeat. Second, we used mechanical transfer methods to transfer nanowires directly from a growth substrate onto our chip by sliding one chip across the other. Although this method produced effective results, it damaged the chip, was inconsistent, and produced non-uniform nanowire densities, undesirable for device fabrication. The third technique, dielectrophoretic alignment, used a high frequency power supply to induce an oscillating (or alternating) electrical field on the device chip, inducing dipoles in the nanowires suspended in solution. These dipoles created electrostatic torques which, when used with sufficient voltage and proper frequencies, produced electrostatic torques that aligned the nanowires parallel to each other at rates as high as 80%. Additionally, this process was the most consistent and least complicated to repeat. Thus, dielectrophoresis could potentially be used for fabrication of electronic devices requiring parallel arrays of nanowires.

PREVENTING COLORBLIND ACCIDENTS ON HIGHWAY INTERSECTIONS
Ushnik Ghosh
Socorro High School, Socorro, New Mexico, USA

Colorblindness affects approximately 8% of the male population and 0.4% of the female population. Colorblind vision is an irreversible, congenital disorder. As a person who is colorblind, this project addresses issues that will offer solutions to help reduce many highway accidents. <br><br>Many highway fatalities are influenced by misinterpreted traffic signals. Unbelievably, there are no questions asked on a driver’s license test about being colorblind. However, a colorblind test is required for obtaining a CDL (Commercial Driving License). A study shows that there are 35% fewer accidents involving CDL drivers than normal drivers. Colorblindness may be a possible cause of some of the highway intersection accidents. <br><br>The objective of year-1 of this continuation project was to do a bio-science study to understand if there is any difference in brain’s perception to colors. Based on limited survey, it can be inferred that both normal vision and colorblind people react to red-blue colors similarly when LED lights are used. LED lights are more focused. However, replacing all the incandescent traffic lights in the U.S. alone would require an excess of ten trillion dollars.<br><br>The objective of the current (year-2) project is to do the engineering study to conceptualize and build a colorblind drivers’ aide that will read and process the traffic light and display the corresponding color using 1). a color circle 2). a printed word and 3). a spoken word to allow the driver enough time to react to the traffic signal. Details of this model are presented on the display board.<br><br>

WIND TURBINE ENERGY OUTPUT ENHANCEMENT USING ELECTROHYDRODYNAMIC PRINCIPLES
Arthur Joseph Petron
Dallastown Area High School, Dallastown PA, USA

Wind turbines have proven to be a safe, productive way to provide electrical energy for consumer use. The implementation of electrohydrodynamic principles on a wind turbine can provide an increase in energy capture of a wind turbine. This is possible because the decrease in drag caused by the device allows the blades to capture more of the wind’s energy.<br><br> The experiment was conducted by constructing a scale model of a wind turbine rotating it with a DC motor. The power input to the motor could be controlled to three significant figures. A graph relating the power input, with an equation of y = 2.42x – 26.9, of the motor to the angular velocity of the turbine was used to relate the change in angular velocity when the electrohydrodynamic device is powered on to a theoretical gain in power output.<br><br> Experimentation consisted of 930 readings of angular velocity, half with the power to the device on, and half with the power off, each half consisting of readings at three different voltages and amperages. The readings were analyzed to find the power gain of the combination of the turbine and electrohydrodynamic device working together.<br><br> The results of the experiment support the hypothesis in that the gain was less than the power supplied to the device to an angular velocity of 25.7 rpm. After this point, the gain surpassed the power requirements and the turbine was able to harness wind energy with the amount of gain harnessed being equal to -2.06(tan-1(-1.50x + 37.1) + 3.14. An analysis of the error of the experiment shows that 99% of the data is within one standard deviation of the mean. The results of this experiment show the viable application of this device on wind turbines.<br><br>

TESTING THE EFFECTS OF CORRUGATED AND FLAT SHEET METAL REINFORCEMENT ON THE V50 BALLISTIC RATING OF A COMPOSITE REINFORCED FRAME WALL
John Joseph Conner
York Catholic HIgh School, York, Pennsylvania, United States of America

Can a house wall, constructed of common building material, and using a composite armor approach, provide ballistic protection from a 30-.06 bullet? The hypothesis was if corrugated sheet metal was added to a composite wall sample, then it would provide additional ballistic protection as compared to a composite wall constructed using flat sheet metal or without any reinforcement. <br><br> Building on two previous years of research, three composite wall samples were constructed using common building materials layered according to composite armor design. These layers consisted of Tyvek©, cement board, plywood, pressure treated wall studs, DuRock©, and filled with pea gravel. The control was constructed without reinforcement beyond the composite wall approach. The second sample was reinforced with the addition of 19 gauge flat sheet metal to the front of the wall. The third sample was constructed as the control but with the addition of 19 gauge corrugated metal to the front of the wall. The corrugation was developed to increase obliquity and cause deflection of the projectile upon impact. <br><br> A V50 ballistic protection limit for each sample was derived by applying the US Government TOP 2-2-710. Striking velocity was varied by adjusting distance and propellant. The V50 value of the control and sheet metal samples were 2,593 fps and 2,604 fps. The protection limit of the corrugated sample exceeded 2,658 fps, thus providing the best protection.<br><br> The conclusion of this experiment supports the hypothesis that the addition of corrugated sheet metal to a composite wall increases the ballistic protection limit. <br><br>

ANALYZING THE NCI-60 CANCER CELL LINES USING DATA OBTAINED FROM GENOME-WIDE CHIP-X EXPERIMENTS
Jayanth Krishnan
Mahopac High School, Mahopac, NY

The application of data obtained from high throughput ChIP-on-chip and ChIP-Seq experiments to analyze the NCI-60 Cancer Cell Lines can allow for the identification of the regulatory program responsible for the aberrant expression of genes in the different types of cancer. Using input data from a published resource specific to the NCI-60 Cancer Cell Lines, a system can be developed to identify mis-regulated transcription factors that potentially regulate transcription factor activity. These transcription factors can be organized, with the development of cancer specific networks of the regulatory interaction data, to determine the activity of transcription factors that is influential to cell activity specific to each one of the NCI-60 cell lines. With networks and lists of specific transcription factors involved with regulating each cancer cell line, experimental biologists can design functional experiments targeting the specific transcription factors identified by this project. We propose that the combination and integration of ChIP-X data with the NCI-60 mRNA expression data is useful in obtaining a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for aberrant expression in different cancers.

AN INNOVATION FOR MICROBIAL FUEL CELLS: ANODE VARIATION IN A NOVEL CONTINUOUS FLOW SYSTEM UTILIZING TUBULAR CATHODE TECHNOLOGY
Daniel John Slotcavage
Ephrata Senior High School, Ephrata, PA

Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) harness the natural ability of certain bacteria to metabolize organic matter, liberate electrons, and transfer those electrons to an electrode (anode) in a useable current. <br><br>Optimization of MFC functionality requires the reduction of internal system resistance of the cell so that electricity generation is limited only by the rate at which bacteria are able to oxidize the substrate. The goal of this project was to maximize power output (normalized by the cathode surface area) in a system utilizing a novel anode in a feasibly scalable design. <br><br>Power output was measured from a continuous flow MFC of original design inoculated with untreated wastewater (primary clarifier effluent). The continuous flow system was composed of a tubular cation exchange membrane coated with highly conductive graphite paint and a 10% Pt catalyst to serve as the cathode, with a graphite anode inside the tube. A carbon paper "asterisk" anode of original design was developed to maximize surface area available to bacteria, maintain a high level of structural integrity, and allow large particles to easily pass through the system. This novel anode (surface area = 300cm2) was tested in the continuous flow system under a load of 1000 ohms. <br><br>The continuous flow system utilizing the novel asterisk anode produced voltages lower than those of the currently popular brush anode systems that use a similar tubular cathode design, but this was attributed to the nutrient-enriched substrate fed to the bacteria in the brush systems. Therefore, the voltages produced matched preliminary predictions.

WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF RECYCLED MATERIALS ON CONCRETE STRENGTH?
Elias Bradley Johnson
Orion Junior High School, Ogden, UT

The Cement manufacturing process is currently 9% of the U.S.’s total CO2 emissions. By using recycled materials, a separate manufacturing process would not have to take place in order to obtain these materials, decreasing the CO2 emissions. This study investigates the effects of recycled materials on concrete strength. By strengthening concrete we can reduce the amount of times the manufacturing process occurs, benefiting the environment by reducing CO2 emissions and using recycled materials.<br><br>These recycled materials were mixed with cement and solidified into concrete pillars. The pillars were then tested for strength and weather resistance. Seven different aggregates were tested including: Nova-mesh 850, assorted smooth metals, assorted rough metals, rubber, spent oil shale and gravel. Gravel was chosen as a control because it is the most common aggregate used today. <br><br>The data supports/indicates assorted rough metals, spent oil shale and the control (gravel) finished first, second and third place, respectively. Glass, Nova-mesh, rubber and assorted smooth metals had the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh highest PSI ratings respectively. As the data shows, the assorted smooth metals had the lowest PSI rating, despite being made of the same material as the assorted rough metals. <br><br>The assorted rough metals, oil shale and gravel were relatively close in comparison; justifying the use of each of these three materials. Today, there is an effective recycle and reuse process for metals. This opens up the possibility of a material that currently has no industrial benefit, and makes a beneficial environmental impact.

INVESTIGATION OF BOUNCE VARIATION DUE TO PRESSURIZED STORAGE OF TENNIS BALLS
Morgan Rachael Henrie
Orion Junior High School, Harrisville, UT

This project studied the effect of pressurized storage on the bounce of tennis balls. The most common type of tennis balls are produced with a pressurized core which helps them to bounce. These balls are packaged in a pressurized can until they are opened for use. It is a common belief that tennis balls going “flat” is one reason that they bounce less as they get old. The hypothesis for this project was that pressurized storage of tennis balls would affect their bounce. Old and new tennis balls were stored at three different pressures for four months and the change in bounce compared. Each pressure chamber stored three old and three new tennis balls. The testing was done by dropping the balls from a ramp and measuring the bounce height using a grid and a video camera. Bounce tests were performed before and after storage for each ball and were repeated three times to reduce variation. The average change in bounce height for new balls stored for four months at 69, 138 and 276 kilopascals was -2.8, -1.7 and 1.4 centimeters, respectively. The average change in bounce height for old balls stored for four months at 69, 138 and 276 kilopascals was 0.0, 0.6 and -4.2 centimeters, respectively. A change in bounce height from the pressurized storage could not be detected in these results. The conclusion was that pressurized storage did not affect tennis ball bounce.

MANIPULATION OF A MULTIVARIABLE DYNAMIC SYSTEM: A CASE STUDY IN TRAFFIC FLOW
Victoria Christine Wooldridge
Midland Senior High School

The purpose of this project is to determine the normal traffic pattern associated with a local high school parking lot. The large number of students with minimal driving experience quickly exiting and reentering the lot during the lunch hour creates stressful and hazardous traffic conditions. After the normal pattern is revealed, recommendations will be made concerning possible changes to increase efficiency and safety in the parking lot.<br><br> The most important materials used included various data sheets tailored to the project for the purpose of recording traffic data. The data from each day was graphed using Graphical Analysis 3.2. Surveillance was completed with a team ranging from three to six people per day. Weather factors and other conditions were taken into consideration to assure that variables deemed irrelevant did not hinder accuracy. <br><br> A normal pattern for this system included such characteristics as: a large peak of rush traffic at the beginning of the lunch hour, and a smaller and slower peak nearing the end. Out of the four entrances/exits, two carried a much higher percentage of traffic. One of those two, however, had little ingoing traffic and a copious volume of outgoing traffic. <br><br> Once this equilibrium pattern was established, I experimented with different variables to determine the stability or instability of this pattern and statistically analyzed all data. It varied in different ways depending on the characteristic of the disturbance present. These factors allowed me to propose and recommended changes to increase safety and efficiency of the traffic flow. <br><br> <br><br>

A MICROELECTRONIC IMPLEMENTATION OF ULTRAWIDEBAND WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY
Mark Philip Croce
Langley High School, McLean, Virginia, USA

Wireless communications have always been problematic. They offer limited channel capacity and are prone to jamming and interception. Many of these problems stem from the fact that a single carrier frequency is used to transmit information. Recently, a technology known as ultrawideband has shown potential to overcome many of these problems. Ultrawideband (UWB) transmissions radiate electromagnetic energy at many different frequencies, unlike conventional transmissions. This gives UWB unique properties such as the potential for enormous channel capacity and immunity to jamming and interception. The Department of Defense and several private companies are currently building prototype UWB communication systems. However, receiving a UWB transmission, since it covers much of the electromagnetic spectrum, has proven to be an overwhelming problem. Most existing systems use banks of narrowband receivers, a solution that requires expensive, complicated, bulky circuits. In addition, much of the radiated energy is excluded by the elements in the array, decreasing overall efficiency. By taking a different approach and eliminating the need to detect discrete frequencies, I have developed a unique receiver design that is sensitive to all electromagnetic radiation in the radio frequency bands. My receiver continuously monitors the total amplitude of electromagnetic energy in an environment, and is able to both detect the time-coded UWB signal and output information about its encoding. It could be manufactured on a single integrated circuit for just pennies apiece, allowing UWB technology to be widely implemented in portable microelectronic devices. My receiver offers a solution to the fundamental problem of ultrawideband communications.

THE AGE OF AXUM EMPIRE
MICHAEL GETAHUN HAILEMARIAM
PINEY WOODS SCHOOL, PINEY WOODS, MS, RANKIN

The main goal of The Age of Axum Empire is to transform the idea of PC games to a real robotic game. This is designed for twenty to twenty-seven students to participate in the process of making the robots, which makes it interesting and fun in a unique way while teaching them engineering skills at the same time. This robotics game is based on the foundation of Age of Empire PC game, even though they are hardly similar. There are three major steps in completing this project. The theoretical representation of the pieces is done first. In this step ideas and goals are set forth, and a general design is made to show how things have to look. The next and most challenging level is to make the physical plan. This is the part where each piece - the ships, the tower, and the tanks- is studied and designed individually. Every part is specifically identified and connected on the right part of the circuit board. The final step will be making the circuit. This includes making the robots and building the six to eight feet long, three to five feet wide, five to seven feet high box.

THE EFFECT OF RECYCLING ON THE TENSILE AND CRUSH STRENGTH OF PAPER
Noah Jackson De La Hunt
Central Virginia Governor's School, Lynchburg, VA

The purpose of this study was to find out how many times paper can be recycled effectively enough to be considered a useable product. A high-school student collected tensile and crush strength (lb/in) data for linerboard paper after recycling it three times during two days in a paper lab. In order to study the effects of recycling on paper, DLK (double lined kraft) samples were taken and beat into pulp using a Valley beater (109-E-726). This pulp was tested and refined to four different freeness levels (the freeness level indicates the length of the fibers and therefore the bonding potential of the pulp solution). Handsheets were made at each freeness level and tested for both crush strength and tensile strength. Twelve samples were tested for crush and tensile strength at each freeness level. A regression analysis test (α=.05) was used to analyze the data; the data for tensile strength was significant with a p-value of 9.24*10^-7 while the data for crush strength was highly insignificant with a p-value of 4.36*10^-1. The original hypothesis that “If the paper is recycled more than six times, then it will lose most of its strength because of fiber shortening that occurs during repulping and due to the effects of “hornification” (loss of flexibility of fibers) and become unusable” was not supported by the data. In conclusion, the study showed that handsheets made from pulp at lower freeness levels contained more tensile strength, while the data from the crush strength tests were inconclusive.

COOLING HIGH POWER DENSITY MICROPROCESSORS: EMPLOYMENT OF A LIQUID GALLIUM—INDIUM—TIN EUTECTIC
William Campbell Martin
Saginaw Arts and Sciences Academy, Saginaw, Michigan, USA

The engineering goal of this project is to design an alternative high performance cooling solution for the increasingly power dense microprocessors that are being used in today’s computing platforms. In order to accomplish this, the design looks at using a non-toxic gallium-indium-tin eutectic that is liquid at room temperature as a coolant circulated within a magnetohydrodynamic heat transfer pump. The superior thermal and physical properties of a gallium-indium-tin eutectic coolant lead to several advantages over traditional water cooling. These include very high heat conductivity, a completely closed system, no moving parts, no generated sound, and a very high boiling point that allows very hot sources to be cooled.<br><br> Since liquid metals are electrically conductive fluids, they offer an efficient pumping solution. Magnetohydrodynamic pumps harness the Lorentz force, which is exhibited by a charge moving through a magnetic field. This force depends upon an electrical field that is orthogonal to a magnetic field, which together result in a force that is orthogonal to both of these fields. The constructed pump utilized two permanent neodymium magnets positioned across from each other and orthogonal to two pure tungsten electrodes also positioned across from each other. Tests indicated that the liquid metal transferred heat very quickly throughout the pump.<br><br> Implementation of liquid metal cooling could allow microprocessor heat generated due to transistor leakage and increasing power densities to be dissipated more efficiently. Greater thermal dissipation leads to more advanced computing applications, such as protein structure prediction, speech to text conversion, and natural language processing.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF WING TIP DESIGN ON THE LENGTH OF TRAILING VORTICES
Belle Dean Bredehoft, Mount Vernon High School
Alexandria, VA USA

Wings create vortices off their tips because high-pressure air is flowing from underneath the wing to the low-pressure air on top. Trailing vortices are one of the main causes of air traffic delays. In my experiment, I took the two best wing tips from last year's project of wing tip designs, and modified them to optimize their design. The wing tips were one that extended up and down, and a Y shaped one. I had my control of a normal wing tip. The vertical wing tips went from a total vertical length from bottom to top of 1" to 4", increasing in length by 1/2" total. The Y wing tips had angles of 30°, 45°, 60°, 75° and the 3" wing tip as the 90°. I tested each wing in my wind tunnel three times. I had notches cut out of the top of my wind tunnel and with a mechanism of dowels that were connected to strings, I moved down my wind tunnel, watching the strings to see where a vortex was present. I tested the wing tips for how much lift they produced. I compared the ratio of vortex length and amount of lift created to find my best wing tip, the 3" wing tip did the best. I ran my mechanism over the top of the control, which helped me visualize airflow. Finding that at 1 1/2" above, the turbulence over the wing ended. This explains why the 3" vertical length did the best.

QUANTIFICATION OF THE IMPACT RESISTANCE OF RESIDENTIAL WINDOW GLASS
Stephanie Nicole Boileau
Novi, High School, Novi, MI , USA

In high wind storms, a great deal of damage is done when the windows in a house shatter. A common recommendation for people in an area threatened by storms is to apply commercial adhesive tape directly to the surface of residential window glass. However, the effectiveness of this technique is not known. <br><br> Therefore, the purpose of this project was two-fold: First, to quantify the energy needed to shatter standard annealed glass used in household windows; and second, to quantify the energy needed to shatter glass with two quick, inexpensive protective coatings based upon commercially-available packaging tapes. The project required building a special test device to fracture the glass in a repeatable manner to determine the effect of the adhesive tape on impact resistance.<br><br> A Window Test Device was created, tested, and proved to be capable of fracturing multiple annealed glass plate samples in a repeatable manner. The median impact energy of the glass plates was determined to be 3.61 J. The impact resistance of the annealed glass plates was not affected by the presence or absence of tape, the type of tape, or the configuration of tape present. <br><br> Therefore, the impact resistance of annealed glass used in windows cannot be improved through the use of inexpensive, commercially-available transparent tapes. However, the presence of tape on the glass significantly reduces the area percentage of the hole created by the impact as long as the fractured glass plate specimen remains in the window frame. <br><br> <br><br>

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, USING A SHAPED MEMORY ALLOY, FLEXINOL 150 LT PHASE II MARCO (MOBILE ACTIVATED RADIO CONTROLLED OBSERVER)
Alicia J. Ortega
Pojoaque High School, Pojoaque, New Mexico 87501, United States

This Phase II project’s purpose is to design and construct a wireless model of the six-legged walking machine, “MARCO” with video capabilities. The project was phased into four different stages. First, a model three times larger was built in order to accommodate all the electronics, power sources, video cam, and radio frequency electronics. Major changes in design were incorporated to conserve energy, and provide efficient power to the Flexinol 150 LT wires. Second, the computer Q-Basic Program was modified to allow RS232 bi-polar inverted format data to be transmitted serially from the laptop and converted to parallel data to run MARCO. Third, Express PCB software was downloaded into the laptop in order to design and construct the printed circuit boards necessary for the serial to parallel configuration. Extreme measures were taken to design a PCB small enough to be carried by MARCO. Two serial to parallel conversion programs were written in “C” program language. Each was run through a compiler and then downloaded into the microprocessors in order to test the PCBs and then to run the radio frequency electronics. Forth, component electronics were purchased and the PCBs constructed. Finally, testing and inspecting was done to minimize failures and correct mistakes. In conclusion, this project has been a tremendous challenge and an opportunity into understanding the world of electronics. MARCO performed as was expected. In the future robots like MARCO will be used for investigating disasters, identifying chemical warfare weapons, and in helping save human life in dangerous situations.<br><br>

CARBON NANOTUBE SYNTHESIS AND MEMS FABRICATION
Steven Gary Noyce
American Fork High School, American Fork, UT

Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) have numerous potential applications, yet are difficult to produce. Several inexpensive synthesis methods were engineered, such as hot filament gas decomposition, synthesis in fused sodium chloride, carbon arc synthesis, and 8 other techniques. The product of highest purity was obtained through catalyzed CVD, which was first performed using an electroplated aluminum substrate, then on coated silicon substrates. This method utilizes the decomposition of a source gas over a carefully prepared iron catalyst, producing a “forest” of CNTs which are aligned vertically due to Van der Waals forces. Many uses of these forests were developed, such as the production and uses of CNT sheets, fibers, etc.<br><br> MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) are micro-scale machines which are traditionally fabricated by etching silicon wafers (through RIE or DRIE), but this process is expensive and has very limited aspect ratios. This study focused on the use of CNT forests as the basic structure for MEMS devices, and then filling the obtained structures with other materials in order to strengthen and add practicality. This increases achievable aspect ratios 15 fold. The floor layer of these CNT MEMS must be removed, and RIE has undesirable effects, so a thermal oxidation removal process was designed to remove this layer. Also, the presence of the iron catalyst can be detrimental to the final devices, so a gas phase iron removal process was engineered. These CNT MEMS are less expensive, more applicable, and more accurate than current MEMS, representing a significant advance in MEMS technology.

TEXTILES TAKE FLIGHT
Duncan Lee Miller
Divine Child High School, Dearborn, Michigan, USA

This science fair project was designed to discover which of the four cloths — silk, nylon, rip-stop nylon, or polyester — would be best suited for the envelope of a hot air balloon. Four qualities were then selected to determine which fabric would be most appropriate: weight, durability, tearing strength, and heat resistance. Once I weighed each textile, I tested durability by using a constant weight to drag the cloth across a strip of sand paper until it completely wore through. In the case of tearing strength, the cloth was hung from a table and attached to a bucket at the bottom. Sand was gradually added into the bucket until the cloth ripped completely in two. To assess their heat resistance, I placed them in an oven and gradually increased the temperature up to 288º C.<br><br> After collecting and recording all the data, I completed charts as well as precision errors for each test. Each material was assigned a quantitative value reflecting its performance in each of the tests, weighted according to its importance. After computing this formula, nylon came out ahead with a score of 1.556. Rip-stop nylon, the material currently used in hot air balloons, was second with 0.980 and polyester was just behind at 0.922. Silk came in last, the weakest of the fabrics, with a 0.542. Seeing nylon well ahead of rip-stop nylon, the current fabric, supports my hypothesis that a stronger textile could be used in the production of hot air balloon envelopes. <br><br>

DOES CORONA DISCHARGE WEAR OUT CARBON NANOTUBES?
Amanda Lorraine Armstrong
Shorewood High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA

Corona discharges are used to produce static electricity, for example for air filters and photo copiers. Available means for producing a corona discharge requires 5000 volts or more. Carbon nanotubes with their long length and tiny diameter offer the potential of corona discharge at a much lower voltage. This project investigates the wear effects of carbon nanotubes during two hours of corona discharge. The purpose of the experiment is to determine if the voltage needed to initiate corona discharge changes as the carbon nanotubes are used. To run the experiment I mixed actual carbon nanotubes into a solution containing mostly ethanol and placed one drop of the new solution on a copper grid. Next, a circuit was made with the copper grid, acting as the anode, a 3mm ceramic spacer and a cathode. I took three measurements of the corona discharge voltage. I then maintained a corona discharge for one hour at 2000V, took measurements again, sustained the corona current for an additional hour and then took my final measurements. My results were surprising. Instead of the voltage necessary for corona discharge increasing as time went on, it decreased. My conclusion is that two hours corona discharge did not wear down the carbon nanotubes. My speculation is that as the electrons in the air were being repelled from the electric field, the ions were being attracted, and were bombarding the carbon nanotubes. The effect of this would be that the carbon nanotubes are being whittled away, and becoming pointier, decreasing the corona discharge voltage. Corona discharge from carbon nanotubes has not yet yielded all of its mysteries, the decreasing voltage shows that there is more to find. <br><br>

THE EFFECT OF AN INDUCED AIRFLOW ON THE AMOUNT OF LIFT PRODUCED BY A WING
Paul Briedé
James Wood High School, Winchester, Virginia, USA

Maintaining laminar airflow is essential for lift. When laminar airflow is lost over the majority of a wing, lift can no longer be created, thus creating a stall. Designing and building a wing that increases the likelihood of laminar airflow will be more efficient than today’s wings. I hypothesized when I induced airflow over and out the top of the wing, laminar airflow would be maintained for a longer distance over the top portion of the wing, thus increasing the capabilities for a greater amount of lift. I conducted my experiment in a wind tunnel that I previously built. I tested the wing with the induced airflow at many positive angles of attack and recorded the airspeed over the top portion of the wing and also monitored the airflow over the wing with strings. My testing proved that my hypothesis was correct. Creating an induced airflow creates better lifting capabilities. This does so by pulling the laminar airflow further back on the wing while also increasing velocity over the top of the wing. Knowing this, many aspects of flight can be changed. By creating an induced airflow, the normal use of control surfaces such as flaps and ailerons might be eliminated. Current stall recovery systems can be replaced with this method of inducing airflow to regain airspeed over the top of a wing. Other area in flight that would benefit include decreasing takeoff and landing distances, reduce fuel consumption, decrease flight duration and or distance, and reduce stall speeds.

MAVs will be carried in a soldier’s backpack and flown by remote control to provide enemy surveillance. <br><br> A two-component project was conducted: (1) the development of the smallest practicable endurance MAV that satisfies DARPA’s 15-minute minimum flight duration requirement; and (2) the development of a slightly larger, video-camera-carrying surveillance MAV having a 1000-m range and 15-minute duration. <br><br> The endurance MAV platform was derived from a 3-element methodology. First, a series of glide tests defined a small, inherently-stable airframe configuration. Secondly, a series of battery discharge tests and wind tunnel propulsion tests were conducted and an aerodynamic model consisting of power required vs. MAV weight interactions was obtained through flight testing of various aerodynamic configurations. A flight-testing approach was implemented since wind tunnel balances for such precise measurements have not yet been developed. Thirdly, equations will be fitted to test data and then input into a Multidisciplinary Design Optimization code, which defines the optimum MAV size and subsystems compatible with DARPA requirements. <br><br> The surveillance MAV was developed by scaling the optimized endurance platform to a 5.5-inch size capable of carrying a video camera.<br><br> Both endurance and surveillance MAV objectives have been fulfilled. Flights with an endurance MAV have exceeded 20 minutes. A surveillance platform has achieved a 1000-m flight range, and an endurance of 15 minutes.<br><br>

THERAPEUTIC COMPUTER-CONTROLLED CONDITIONING
Trevor M. Boardman
Delta High School, Delta, UT

People with physical disabilities or debilitating injuries need a reliable way to condition their body, strengthen muscles, and maintain overall health. Standard exercise methods generally oppose muscle contraction using the force of gravity, elastics, or hydraulics. These conditioning methods are satisfactory for normal people. However, for those with injuries or disabilities, conditioning must be individually customized. This project was to develop and test a therapeutic, computer-controlled conditioning (TCCC) device that can aid people with physical impairments.<br><br> <br><br>Physical conditioning methods are classified as isotonic, isometric and plyometric. Isotonic exercises use a force applied to the muscle which does not change. Isometric exercises maintain the muscle at the same length during conditioning. Lastly, plyometric exercises make use of the stretch-shortening muscle cycle to increase the myotatic or stretch reflex. Plyometrics is used to develop explosive speed in place of maximum strength. TCCC can reproduce the three types of conditioning methods listed previously. TCCC can also provide full range of motion, ligament stretching, increase bone density, strengthen muscles, tendons, and ligaments, improve joint toughness and function, and reduce potential for future injury.<br><br> <br><br>The TCCC device for this project was constructed using parts from immobilizing braces, surplus motors and gears, force sensors, motor controllers, limit switches, and a computer with a digital input/output interface. The most difficult part of this project was to find mechanical components that would work together after assembly. Unlimited algorithms can now be programmed to control the desired type of TCCC. These customizable algorithms are quintessential for successful TCCC.

COMBINING ACID DECRYSTALIZATION WITH ACID HYDROLYSIS TO CONVERT CELLULOSIC WASTE INTO FERMENTABLE SUGARS, PHASE IV
Thomas Sylvester Morgan
Northwestern Area High School, Mellette, SD

To successfully assimilate renewable energy into the global energy market, new processes must be designed. Cellulosic waste has been an untapped natural resource in the majority of the United States for many decades. This project looked into the possibility of using acid as the catalyst to convert the cellulose to glucose. <br><br>For this experiment, I used ground hay, which is an abundant and easily attainable resource. I added very strong 18 molar phosphoric acid to the hay/water mixture. After soaking the hay/water mixture with acid for five minutes, the pH of the solution is brought up to 1.6 using a strong base, and the mixture is heated to 900 C. After one hour of heat, base is added to the mixture once again to bring the pH up to 6-7. <br><br>I continued with one test by fermenting. I added fertilizer and yeast, and then let the mixture set at 300 C for 72 hours. The resulting ethanol is the same ethanol that is made from corn. I did not add the fermented data to my results because the resulting chemicals given off during fermentation can askew the results.<br><br> <br><br>In past testing, phosphoric acid acted the best on organic materials. Knowing that phosphoric acid was my best shot, this project was aimed at seeing how efficient phosphoric acid converts on a large scale. After experimenting, phosphoric acid converted 95 percent of the cellulose to glucose. The implementation of this process may revolutionize the ethanol industry.

ENVIRONMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS USING RECOMBINANT DYNAMIC NODAL ANALYSIS
Tyson O. Boardman
Delta High School, Delta, Utah, USA

Environments can be investigated using Recombinant Dynamic Nodal Analysis (RDNA). This project tests the development of a RDNA algorithm to use with an autonomously navigating robot. The robot investigates an environment using a grid-based coordinate system, finds randomly placed objects, and then documents their location on a computer-generated map. Although the test is performed with physical objects, they could represent environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, chemicals, and other things of environmental concern at specific locations locally or worldwide. The use of robots for environmental investigations could help us to better understand and protect the world around us without endangering human lives and our fragile ecosystem. <br><br> An algorithm which observes an object from only one or two sides could miss important details and features. The autonomously navigating robot, however, uses an RDNA algorithm to detect objects from all sides and to best determine their characteristics. <br><br> Each occupied cell in the grid becomes a node for a common object. The robot observes the details from all sides and then analyzes and recombines the nodal data on the computer-generated map. The final map can be printed for post-test analysis and inspection of the objects' complete features and locations.<br><br> An autonomously navigating robot with a good RDNA algorithm can be used to look at objects from all sides and to avoid making false, one-sided judgments. RDNA can also be used for a host of other activities where humans and sensitive life forms are kept out of harm’s way.

AUTOMATICE TRACKING DEVICE
Samuel Jang
Nicolet High School, Glendale, Wisconsin, United States

The purpose of this project is to construct an automatic tracking device that always faces its target. Unlike other auto tracking devices, such as the GPS system, the laser-guided missile, and the high-tech security cameras, this device is designed for convenient applications for daily life. The criteria is that it must be cheap, simple (no computer CPU), and comfortable to use.<br><br>In making the auto tracking device, six components are put together: the target, the sensor, the motor, the mount, the circuit, and the applicant. The target is an object that the device points towards. It attracts the sensors which then send messages through the circuit to the motors so that the device can face the light source. All the components, except for the target, are placed on a pan-and-tilt mount. In this model, a visible light (the target) activates the photoconductive cells that allow electric current to flow through the newly constructed operational amplifier based circuit, which controls the movement of the device. <br><br>In completing this project, a problem arose. Since the OpAmp amplifies the difference of the voltage from the two photoconductive cells of an axis, even a slight difference between the amounts of light entering the photocells causes the device to move. This makes the system “vibrate” even when the target is still. <br><br>The objective of this project was successfully completed using the new OpAmp based circuit. However, the device is not perfect yet due to the vibration effect.<br><br>

FISHING AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE WITH FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS!
Christopher Michael Ballard
Northside High School, Roanoke, Virginia, U.S.A.

This experiment was designed to determine if a new casting mechanism could be built that would perform as well or better than the 2004 prototype, and be made adaptable for use by people with functional limitations. <br><br> It was hypothesized that if the 2004 prototype is redesigned, built from lighter materials, made smaller, and attached to a wheelchair, then the new mechanism would perform as well or better than the prototype.<br><br> A new casting mechanism was built using aluminum, a linear actuator, and installed on a wheelchair. Operation using switches makes it adaptable for the fisherman unable to cast a fishing line by hand. Each mechanism was equipped with 8-pound test line, cast fifty times, results measured with a stationary tape measure, and recorded. <br><br> The new casting mechanism performed better than the prototype. The line cast by the new casting mechanism traveled an average distance of 39.7 feet and an average of 39.0 feet for the 2004 prototype.<br><br> The hypothesis, if the 2004 prototype is redesigned, built from lighter materials, made smaller, and attached to a wheelchair, then the new mechanism would perform as well or better than the prototype was supported. The new mechanism achieved more casting distance than the 2004 prototype. This conclusion was supported using statistical data to perform a 't' test with a value of 2.34, falling within the range of +2.37 to -2.37. <br><br> Manufacturers might consider producing the mechanism for sale to fishing enthusiasts who, because of functional limitations, might otherwise forego the pleasure of fishing.<br><br>

PHASE SEPARATION IN TERNARY POLYMER BLENDS CONFINED AT SURFACES
Jaclyn Schein
Hebrew Academy of the Five Towns and Rockaway, Cedarhurst, NY

Blending polymers, a cost-effective alternative to synthesizing new polymers which can be useful in recycling and thin film applications, can create new materials which combine the valuable qualities of each of the components. This project investigated the blending ability of polystyrene, poly(methyl methacrylate) and poly(vinyl chloride), polymers generally immiscible due to their structural incompatibilities. Compatibility was determined by calculating the free energy of the polymer blend, with a lower free energy indicating increased compatibility. <br><br>This project investigated, for the first time, PS:PMMA:PVC ternary blends at a 1:1:1 ratio. Their immiscibility causes de-wetting and phase separation, demonstrated by the formation of droplets which are visible under Atomic Force Microscope imaging. Sample were spun at thicknesses ranging from 3500Å to 800Å and then divided into three sections. One remained unprocessed, one was annealed at 150°C, and one was exposed to supercritical CO2.<br><br>Droplet height decreased 70% after supercritical CO2 exposure, from 489nm to 147nm. Contact angle was measured to calculate interfacial tension, Flory Huggins parameter, and the free energy. Annealing decreased the free energy by 4% and supercritical CO2 decreased the free energy by 7% in blends of 3500Å. Position and location of the polymers within each blend were identified through melting point and differential solvent techniques. Based on this data, an equation calculating the free energy of ternary blends was formulated.<br><br>This demonstrates that supercritical CO2 is more effective than annealing in increasing compatibility of ternary blends. Future work will examine the effect of both processes exerted together on polymer blends.

NANOCOMPOSITE FOAMS MADE USING SUPERCRITICAL CO2
Alice Lee
Upper Arlington High School, Upper Arlington, Ohio, USA

Environmentally-friendly nanocomposite foams were made using pure polystyrene (PS) mixed with various concentrations of nanoclay 20A and talc, a microparticle. Supercritical carbon dioxide was used as the blowing agent. This was achieved using a Leistritz ZSE-27 mm intermesh twin-screw extruder. Carbon dioxide was injected into the extruder by using a syringe pump to control the gas flow rate. For the flammability test, one strand sample was lit over a paper towel soaked with ethyl alcohol. All samples were flammable, but pure PS, PS+5.0% talc, PS+0.5% and 2.5% 20A samples melted and dripped onto the ethyl alcohol, causing huge flames. PS+5.0%, 7.5%, and 10% 20A samples did not drip; only charred. Thermomechanical analysis was performed using a thermomechanical analyzer. PS had a 55.23 mm/m/°C thermal expansion coefficient, while PS+5.0% talc exhibited a value of 28.99 mm/m/°C. PS+5.0% 20A produced the lowest thermal expansion coefficient of 18.59 mm/m/°C. PS+5.0% 20A foam has a heat distortion temperature 10°C higher than that of the pure PS foam (50°C vs. 40°C), while PS+5.0% talc foam has a heat distortion temperature around 45°C. An Instron Microtester measured tensile properties. PS had a tensile modulus of 50 MPa, while PS+5.0% talc had a 95 MPa modulus. PS+5.0% 20A exhibited the highest tensile modulus, at 110 MPa. All samples had a similar density of 0.15 g/cm3. Low flammability rate, low thermal expansion coefficient, high heat distortion temperature, and high mechanical strength were achieved by adding nanoparticles to conventional polymer. A safer and stronger foam was successfully produced.

TESTING THE IMPACT RESISTANCE OF WINDOWS & WINDOW PROTECTION SYSTEMS
Forrest B Berg
The Woodlands High School, The Woodlands, TX

One of the greatest risks to your home from a windstorm is broken windows. Not only can this result in severe damage to the home’s contents, but it can also put the structural integrity of the house at risk. The purpose of this experiment is to determine what level of protection is provided by various window thicknesses and window protection materials against airborne debris. The results are intended to provide useful information to homeowners on how to protect their homes from damaging windstorms.<br><br> To conduct the test, an air cannon was constructed capable of shooting a one-foot long, one-inch diameter wood dowel at varying speeds to simulate flying debris. A mock window frame was also constructed to hold eighteen-inch by eighteen-inch sheets of glass during testing. The canon was used to shoot the wood dowel at the windows at speeds ranging from twenty to 113 mph.<br><br> The strongest of the materials tested was the 3/16” polycarbonate and 3/4” plywood, both of which withstood the maximum impact speed of 113 mph. The 7/16” plywood sheet was second best, withstanding an impact of 101 mph. The safety glass and the windows with security film withstood speeds up to fifty mph, and like the previous materials, maintained integrity even after they were penetrated. All other materials, including plain glass, shattered at low speeds and provided little protection. Security film was found to provide an effective defense against moderate windstorms, however, purchasing polycarbonate window covers may be a smart investment for homes in high risk hurricane areas.

As time goes by, robots are becoming more and more useful in the world. Unfortunately, our current robots are not well suited for dealing with complex environmental situations. The purpose of this project is to use living creatures as a model for robots and to find the best design for such a robot.<br><br>Two walking robots were built: one with three motors used for walking (one for both front legs, one for both rear legs, and one for the waist) and another with five motors (one for the waist and one for each leg). These robots did not use microcontrollers or programming for control. Instead, they used analog control systems that adapt to their environment. These control systems were based upon nervous systems in living creatures.<br><br>The two robots were put through a series of tests. Three tests measured how fast the robot could walk on different types of surfaces to show how well the robot could adapt.

AN EXTRA SPIN ON NERVE REGENERATION SCAFFOLDS: SYNTHESIS OF AN ELECTROSPUN SPINAL CORD NERVE CONDUIT
Amardeep Singh Grewal
Detroit Country Day School, Beverly Hills, Michigan, United States of America

A novel electrospun nerve guide tube has recently been synthesized for spinal cord nerve regeneration. The guide tube was created from the bioresorbable polymers poly(E-caprolactone) (PCL) and poly(D-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). To optimize the strength and elasticity of the guide tube, various concentrations and blends of PCL and PLGA have been mixed and electrospun. Mechanical testing was conducted to determine the modulus, toughness, and the stress and strain at the fracture point of the tubes. These values were compared amongst the various tubes, and then compared against guide tubes that had been annealed to promote crystallization. The degree of crystallinity present within the electrospun tubes was determined by differential scanning calorimetry. The annealed guide tube created by a blend of 5% PCL and 5% PLGA solution in 3:1 chloroform:methanol showed the greatest strength and elasticity. The morphological studies that were performed showed the changes that occurred within the scaffold while in tension and in a hydrated environment. My current in vitro tests and the in vivo tests performed by the principal investigator suggest that the tubular scaffold allows for cellular migration and attachment. This nerve guide tube shows great promise for soldiers who are injured while at war, and for civilians who suffer from spinal cord trauma.

ALARM TRIGGERED SHUT OFF APPLIANCE SYSTEM (ATSAS)
Yunchao Susan Lou
Wylie Groves High School, Beverly Hills MI, USA

Cooking has become the leading cause of house fires in the United States. It is also the leading cause of home fire injuries. These fires result from unattended cooking, human errors, or mechanical/electric failures causing the loss of lives, injuries, and billions of dollars lost on property damage. <br><br>The purpose of my project, the alarm triggered shut off appliance system (ATSAS), is to assist the hearing disabled and elderly with a device that shuts off the utility supply line for appliances to prevent those fire occurrences and carbon monoxide poisoning in response to the sound of an activated alarm such as smoke, carbon monoxide, or heat alarms. It can be used for all utility appliances in residential homes, commercial buildings, ships, and aircrafts. <br><br>The ATSAS uses the sound of alarms as the trigger signal to energize switch (either relay or gas solenoid valve) to shut off a utility appliance’s supply line. Once the alarm sounds, a microphone transmits sound waves to a tone decoder that activates a switch circuit, turning the appliance off. The device can be employed to detect a wide array of alarm sound frequencies given that the tone decode is adjustable, and its sensitivity to alert sound is also adjustable in order to fit a variety of situations. The tone decoder prevents the system from being falsely activated by erroneous sounds. This helps the occupants to take emergency action in the earliest stages of development of a fire/carbon monoxide breakout or prevent their occurrences when the occupant’s direct action is impossible.<br><br>

CONCRETE PAVING AND MAINTENANCE IN MICHIGAN
Lukas Adam Gordon
Marysville High School, Marysville Michigan, United States

Michigan was the first state to use concrete paved roads, but for some reason our roads are more structurally deficient compared to other states. The purpose of this project is to see if concrete pavements of years past perform better than the pavements and patches being placed down today.<br><br>The experiments consisted of testing multiple highways and arterial roads with a calibrated concrete test hammer. The test consisted of hitting the pavement a specific amount of times on joint patches and the mainline pavement. The location of the tests on the selected concrete areas was at random. The reason being was so my test results would not be skewed by any cosmetic defects. <br><br>Other experiments involved coring selected pavements and inspecting the cores for defects or differences between pavements. I also compiled data from around the state on new in-place concrete mix designs and cylinder break results. <br><br>All of the tests that I completed were done the same way each time in a controlled way, and followed ASTM (American Standard Test Methods) and MDOT (Michigan Department of Transportation) procedures. All of the testing instruments used were calibrated by professional technicians.<br><br>The tests I conducted supported my hypothesis, that the original pavement is stronger than the patch that is placed to repair it in most instances. The results could be varied depending on the mix design of the two pavements.<br><br>

EMERGENCY VEHICLE ALERT SYSTEM PART 4
Justine Alyson Fortier
LaSalle Academy, Providence Rhode Island, USA

The purpose of this project is to detect the frequencies of sirens and warn a driver with hearing loss that a rescue vehicle is approaching. This device consists of a microphone, a series of five bandpass filters, and five VU meter chips to drive a five column LED display. <br><br> The band pass filters each have a bandwidth of 100 Hz and have center frequencies of 825 Hz, 1025 Hz 1225 Hz, 1425 Hz, and 1625 Hz respectively. The filters are designed to isolate the frequencies between 800 Hz and 1650 Hz, which is the frequency range common to all rescue and police vehicle sirens. Each column of LEDs corresponds to one of the five bandpass filters. This creates a display that shows the pattern of the siren frequencies enabling a hearing impaired driver to distinguish the sirens from other sounds that are in the same frequency range. I tested the device by playing a 50-2000 Hz frequency sweep directly into the signal input of the individual filters. I observed the number of LEDs that turned on at each frequency in the frequency sweep and graphed the results to test each filter. Filter A peaked at approximately 820 Hz, filter B peaked at 1050 Hz, filter C peaked at 1250 Hz, filter D peaked at approx. 1400 Hz, and filter E peaked at 1700 Hz. These peaks are very close to the calculated center frequencies for each filter.<br><br> The results of this experimentation prove that it is possible for a device to be built that can detect the frequencies of sirens and warn hearing impaired driver that a rescue vehicle is approaching. The results also show that the five column LED display can help a hearing impaired driver to better distinguish a siren from other sounds in the same frequency range due to the pattern of the lit LEDs.

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF GOLD, NICKEL, AND COPPER DEPOSITED PEN ON THE OXIDATION AND ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE PROPERTIES FOR ELECTRONIC TEXTILES
Graham Edward Gintz
Hilton Head Preparatory School, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to identify, fabricate, and test electrically conductive materials for use as a substitute for woven fibers. An electronic textile functions as both a traditional fabric and as a component of a solar powered identification system designed to remotely identify and locate an individual in a hostile environment. An electrical budget of 200 Ohms per square per ribbon was set to give the system maximum operating life. Four electrically conducting materials--aluminum foil (the control), and spun coated gold, nickel, and copper polyethylene naphthalene dicarboxilate (PEN) film-- were studied. Strips of each material were cut into ribbons 150mm long, 125 micrometers thick and in three widths from 0.75-2.0mm. Ribbon width was varied to facilitate mechanical hand weaving. Three tests were devised to determine mechanical durability, rate of oxidation, and resistance to cleaning agents. (1) Five aluminum samples failed bending tests within 10 repetitions. Failure occurred when the metal broke or the film delaminated. Copper PEN had the most mechanical stability over 100 bending repetitions, gold PEN nearly so. (2) Gold PEN performed best in the oxidation test; copper PEN failed within three days, nickel PEN within 45 days. Failure occurred when electrical resistance rose above 200 Ohms per square. (3) All PEN film performed equivalently when immersed in cleaning agents. Gold ribbons, 0.75 mm wide, provided the best overall performance when electrical, mechanical, and environmental tradeoffs were considered with a resistance less than 170 Ohms per square per ribbon after four months of testing.

Wing tip vortices are the tornado like winds produced by the wings of aircraft, submarines, and racecars. They can be a “real drag” causing many problems in the air, water, and on the ground. An experiment was conducted to test which aspect ratio and sweep produce the smallest vortices.<br><br> The problem included 3 parts:<br><br>• Which aspect ratio produces the smallest vortices?<br><br>• Which sweep produces the smallest vortices?<br><br>• Which combination of the above will produce the smallest vortices?<br><br> The hypothesis also had three parts:<br><br>• The larger the aspect ratio is, the smaller the vortex will be.<br><br>• The forward swept wing will produce the smallest vortices.<br><br>• The best combination will be the forward swept wing with the largest aspect ratio.<br><br>Wings were designed and fabricated from three basic aspect ratios with each being swept backward, forward, and non-swept. Pictures were taken of the vortices for each wing, and measurements were taken from the pictures.<br><br> The data both supported and did not support the hypothesis. The aspect ratio results supported the first portion of the hypothesis. For the second part, the backward swept wing produced the smallest vortices, followed by the forward swept and non-swept. The third portion was partly supported by the data. The combination was the forward swept wing with the largest aspect ratio produced the smallest vortices. Least successful combination was, the forward swept wing with the smallest aspect ratio, not supporting the hypothesis.<br><br>

DEVELOPMENT AND OPTIMIZATION OF A POLYVINYL ALCOHOL HYDROGEL FOR CONTROLLED RELEASE OF PHOSPHATE
Alexandra L. Ghaben
Central York High School, York, PA

Phosphate fertilizers pollute the environment by the process of eutrophication. The previous study (Design and Synthesis of a Polyvinyl Alcohol Hydrogel for Controlled Release of Phosphate) attempted to correct this problem by reducing phosphate runoff through the use of a Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) hydrogel. The purpose of this study is to automate (with regard to synthesis procedure), microsize, and optimize the PVA hydrogels designed in the previous study. <br><br> To create a hydrogel, a PVA solution is first subjected to a series of freeze/thaw cycles to form crosslinks. This crosslinking procedure was automated by the use of programmable on/off cycles of a conventional freezer to control the temperature of the crosslinking environment. Success in this field of automation, using a gravimetric absorption test, produced a PVA hydrogel that displayed both Fickian swelling and an infinite swelling ratio of 2.0, properties achieved in the previous study.<br><br> Next, the PVA hydrogel was microsized by approximately tenfold from the previous design. This prompted the redesign of the PVA/phosphate placement within the hydrogel. The Taguchi Method of Experimental Design was used to test the effect of phosphate concentration and crosslinking time on the release of phosphate in a dynamic flow test system for three periods of five hours. The redesigned PVA hydrogels released approximately 15% of the phosphate compared to uncontrolled release. Analysis using the Taguchi Method indicated that the release rate of phosphate is optimized when the concentration of phosphate is 50 mg of phosphate per mL of PVA solution, regardless of crosslinking time.

WOOD STRENGTH: WHAT COMMONLY AVAILABLE WOOD IS BEST FOR HOME CONSTRUCTION
Jordan Taylor Harris
Hilton Head Preparatory School, Hilton Head Island, SC, United States

<br><br> This project was designed to determine what commonly available wood was best for home construction from the standpoint of strength. If homes were built stronger and were more impervious to hurricanes and natural disasters, thousands of people would save money that otherwise would have gone to reconstruction. It was predicted that Oak would be the strongest, though its cost could be a drawback.<br><br> Six woods (Cypress, Pressure Treated Pine, Spruce, Pine, Poplar and Oak) were tested in the experiment. Weights were applied to five 1.91 cm by 1.91 cm by 1.91 cm by 40.64 cm samples of each species using a self-designed testing apparatus.<br><br> Each wood displayed consistent results among each of its test samples. Several of the results were close in number but distinctive enough to draw a clear conclusion. Cypress had an average breaking point of 64 kg, Pressure Treated Pine had an average breaking point of 91 kg, Pine had an average breaking point of 129 kg, Spruce had an average breaking point of 103 kg, Poplar had an average breaking point of 136 kg and Oak had an average breaking point of 139 kg.<br><br> The hypothesis that Oak would be the strongest of the tested species was accepted. The average breaking point of Poplar was very similar and was determined to be a more practical alternative to Oak because of cost. After all factors were weighed, while Oak was determined to be the strongest, in all practicality the best option for home construction was determined to be Poplar. An added benefit of this experiment was that the self-designed testing apparatus could have additional applications for strength testing in the building industry.<br><br>

SCANNING ION CONDUCTANCE MICROSCOPY OF LIGHT-INDUCED VOLUME AND SURFACE AREA CHANGES IN CHLOROPLASTS IN VITRO
Evan Neal Mirts
Jefferson City High School, Jefferson City, MO

Traditional studies of light-induced morphological changes in isolated chloroplasts in vitro have relied on electron microscopy or packed volume techniques. Neither technique presently affords a method of observing the reversible light-induced morphological changes undergone by individual chloroplasts without damaging them or introducing the possibility of artificial morphological changes. Unlike other types of scanning probe microscopy, scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) never comes into contact with a sample as it scans, thus eliminating many difficulties in examining reversible reactions in individual chloroplasts. SICM was used to render three-dimensional images of individual chloroplasts undergoing light-induced volume and surface area changes. Volume changes when exposed to multiple spectrum incandescent light ranged from an increase of ~13% to a decrease of ~21%, and surface area changes ranged from an increase of ~29% to a decrease of ~38%. It was found that whether surface area increased or decreased occurred independently of whether a chloroplast’s volume increased or decreased, suggesting that the changes in shape and surface area experienced by chloroplasts as a result of light exposure are based on the orientation of the chloroplasts relative to their supporting surface rather than on their changes in volume directly. In addition, an isolation procedure for obtaining a high yield of intact and functional chloroplasts and an incubation medium (175 mM NaCl, 5 mM Trizma base, 20 mM phenazine methosulfate, and 100 mM sodium acetate, buffered to pH 6 using NaOH) supportive of reversible light-induced morphological changes and compatible with SICM is outlined.

ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE PROCESSING OF NYLON 6: A TWO YEAR STUDY
Xavier Joyner
Wake Early College of Health and Sciences, Raleigh, NC

Nylon-6 chains were effectively confined within Cyclodextrin molecules with uncovered portions of the chains that dangled outside the crystalline channel structure formed by the CD molecules. These compounds were formed to understand the constrained crystallization of N 6 chains in the IC as a function of N6 molecular weights and the N6: α CD Stoichiometry. The main focus of this study is to induce faster crystallization and increase the overall rate of crystallization of the polymer. These uncovered but constrained chains crystallized differently when compared to the bulk polymer. The formation and crystallization of the ICs were characterized by differential scanning calorimetery (DSC) and Fourier Transform infared spectroscopy, (FTIR). The DSC results suggested that the N6 chains were partially complexed by the CD molecules, and the FTIR scans revealed that the N6 chains were present in the n-s-N6: α-CD-ICs. DSC comparison of the crystallization and melting of neat bulk N 6 and the dangling N6 chains in n-s-N6: α-CD-ICs indicated that the latter constrained N6 chains crystallize more readily/rapidly and achieve a higher level of crystallinity than the neat bulk N6 samples. This is a consequence of the ability of the N6 chains “dangling” from their (n-s)-CD-ICs to crystallize at higher temperatures than bulk N-6 chains. When their molten mixture is cooled, the (n-s)-N6-CD-ICs provide finely dispersed crystalline nuclei for the subsequent crystallization of bulk N6.

DETERMINING THE EFFECTS OF FLOW CIRCULATION AND THE KUTTA CONDITION IN FLIGHT
Garrett Darl Lewis
Sandia Preparatory School, Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States of America

While there are many different methods used to explain the process behind lift production among airfoils, ranging from the ever popular Bernoulli’s principle to obscure vorticity related methods overlooked by most introductory classes, many are not fully accurate, covering only certain aspects of the process and ignoring areas that do not fit the proper parameters. The Kutta-Joukowsky Theorem remedies most of these shortcomings due to the ambiguous nature of its parameters; yet at the same time it has extensive implications for the lifting process. In an attempt to demonstrate the veracity of this statement, two NACA 4-digit airfoils were tested both computationally and experimentally in a wind tunnel at zero and five degrees angle-of-attack. <br><br> The modified Baal’s wind tunnel utilized a 1x 8.5-inch test section 30 inches deep to test the wing profiles at a steady wind speed of 10 ms-1 while a fog generator provided a visible fluid to observe the circulation about the wing. Computational testing was conducted primarily with Elmer, a multi-physics platform developed by the Finnish IT Center for Science. <br><br> With minimal error in the 5-degree airfoils and higher, yet still reasonable, error at 0-degrees, both airfoils gave lift results that agreed with theoretical expectations with high error percentage due, in part, to the low magnitudes used in the process that magnified any discrepancies in measurements. Nonetheless, the models gave strong support to the theory as set forth by Kutta and Joukowsky. <br><br>

FOOTBALL RECEIVING GLOVES: POLYVINYL CHLORIDE ETHYLENE VS. TRADITIONAL MATERIAL
Zachary Donat Remillard
Drury High School, North Adams, MA

Commercial football receiving gloves have adhesive that wears quickly and decreases the receiver’s ability to catch a football. The purpose of this research was to test the polyvinyl chloride ethylene material against the traditional material under different climate conditions to observe if the polyvinyl chloride ethylene material would be a better material to use for receiving gloves. <br><br>It was hypothesized that the polyvinyl chloride ethylene material would perform better under the different climate conditions, because the polyvinyl chloride ethylene material does not have adhesive on it. Therefore no adhesive would wear off.<br><br>To calculate the coefficient of friction of both materials, a football was attached to a weight (via a linear pulley system) by a string. The football was pulled back on a plank of wood and released over the aforementioned materials which were affixed to the wood. A photogate at the end of the linear pulley measured the average acceleration, which was used to calculate the coefficient of friction. Different climate conditions were achieved by aging the materials in an oven (dry heat), a freezer (cold), and in an oven with a hot plate and water (humidity). After each aging process, the acceleration test was performed.<br><br>It was found that the polyvinyl chloride ethylene had a better coefficient of friction after the dry heat and cold aging processes, and the same coefficient after the humidity test. From these results, it can be concluded that the polyvinyl chloride ethylene material would last longer than the traditional material in receiving gloves.

TRACKING THE SOUND A SECOND YEAR STUDY ON AN ULTRASONIC TRAIN WRECK AVOIDANCE SYSTEM
Courtney Anne Rafes
Northwest High School, Justin, TX, USA

Everyday millions of people and billions of dollars worth of materials travel on the railways of the world. The safety and security of these railways are of a paramount importance to the lives and the economy of the world and homeland security. Many of these accidents are due to train derailments or train collisions. This project is a second year study into the use of ultrasonic sound to prevent derailments and collisions. In this year’s study, actual trains and train tracks were utilized to test nine hypotheses. Within the limitations of the equipment utilized, it was determined that 163 KHz was the optimum frequency for transmitting sound through train tracks and to trains. It was shown that sound will travel from one rail to another even with rail expansion joints and that by increasing the output voltage the signal will travel further down the track. It was also proven that ultrasonic sound will travel long distances down tracks and can travel from a train through a track to another train. Finally it was demonstrated that the sound of the train can be filtered using a high pass filtration system so that only the ultrasonic sound from an emitting transducer is detected by a receiving transducer. This project demonstrates that a specific frequency of ultrasonic sound can be transmitted from a train through rail tracks to another train on the same track. This project also demonstrates that the transducers can detect breaks in tracks, thus helping to avoid train derailments. <br><br><br><br>

A BALLISTIC VEST WITH COMPOSITE TRAUMA PLATE INSERT - A PROTOTYPE
Connor James Rise
Brownell-Talbot College Preparatory School, Omaha, NE

Men and women in security positions need protection from ballistic penetration and from blunt force trauma. This project is a study of how composite materials react to being struck repeatedly with a high speed projectile. The force of each impact and impact crater was measured and the energy absorbed by the trauma plate was calculated. The major goal of this project was to find a composite material that would successfully absorb the energy impact of a projectile with realistic energies. <br><br>I built an air canon that fired a projectile at a composite material layered between two sheets of metal. Each composite trauma plate consisted of layered materials to absorb and distribute the energy of the impact. Pressure paper will measure the pounds per square inch put on the trauma plates. Deflection of the metal using clay was also measured.<br><br>My hypothesis was supported by the data collected. The metal had a minimal effect on the composite and did a great job of holding the composite together. As I predicted, the layered composite materials were more successful and lighter than the control and were able to achieve higher survivability than that of the control. <br><br>The prototype vest and trauma plate insert is a great option to achieve survivability in a dangerous situation. These vests can be used to help protect military personnel, but can also be used to provide protection for hunters, security forces or police officers.

THE EVALUATION OF CONCRETE COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH OF SILICON DIOXIDE REPLACEMENT SAMPLES WITH ELECTRIC UTILITY COAL FIRED BOILER BOTTOM ASH AND BOILER SLAG
Michael David Ludwig
Louisville High School, Louisville, Ohio USA

Coal combustion products (ccp’s) are the inorganic residues that remain after coal burns in electric generation boilers. Products include pulverized wet bottom (flowing magma from the bottom of the boiler), pulverized dry bottom (falling out cooler in non-magma state), and cyclone wet bottom (spinning coal chunks in cyclone pattern inside boiler). Coal fired boiler ashes from three electrical generation boilers were used in this experiment.<br><br> The purpose was to substitute ashes from units 1-2, units 3-4, and unit 5 for silicon dioxide in concrete samplers. A control group of sand was also formulated. Three-column samplers were constructed of boiler slag produced by the two wet bottom units and bottom ash from the dry bottom unit. They were strength tested after seven, fourteen, and twenty-eight days of curing with a compression tester. Thirty-six column samples were analyzed in this fashion. A second set of trials was completed using an admixture super plasticizer that aided the chemistry to produce the desired effect of increasing the concrete flow characteristics, making finishing easer and increasing strength.<br><br> The control sand mixtures were found to have the greatest strength in both subsets. Substituted boiler slag and bottom ash samples decreased the strength of the sample, but the strength still remained above minimum standards for commercial non-structural concrete use. The super plasticizer admixture produced little effect. This research showed the practical application of substituting ash from electric utilities for sand, thereby preserving this natural resource and finding a suitable use for this industrial waste.<br><br>

HOW DO YOU LIKE YOUR EGGS?
Hannah Marie Schweiss
Herculaneum High School, Herculaneum, MO, USA

I chose this project to determine the best way to package fragile objects. Shipping costs money, due to packaging cost and weight. There is a risk of breakage. I wanted to know what would provide the lightest packaging with the highest success. Therefore, my question is what is the best cushioning to keep an egg from breaking?<br><br> I hypothesized that if I drop the egg and container from various heights, then the eggs in the cylinder and tetrahedron will not crack while those in the box and bubble wrap will break.<br><br> My procedure involved creating containers: a tetrahedron, a cotton filled box, a high density foam cylinder and bubble wrap. First, I secured the eggs in the container. I measured 1.5, 3 and 4.5 meters from the concrete and dropped the container from each height. I recorded the results. If the egg was broken, I replaced it and the container. I repeated each drop three times from each of the heights.<br><br> I discovered the cylinder protected the egg at all heights. The tetrahedron failed to protect; the egg looked as though it had exploded. The box worked half the time; it depended on how it landed. The bubble wrap failed to protect the egg at every height.<br><br> In conclusion, my hypothesis was partially supported. For shipping, the best material to use is high-density foam. It is the lightest material that worked well. It could be cut to surround the fragile object, or pieces could be packed around the object.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF WINGTIP CONCAVE ON INDUCED DRAG
James Eugene Dorman, Robinson Secondary School, 
Fairfax, Virginia, United States

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effect of wingtip concave on induced drag, the type of drag resulting from wingtip vortices that come about as the result of air pressure differentials on the surface of the wing. To determine this I prepared six identical wings and added indentations on the wingtips of 3mm, 6 mm, 9 mm, 12 mm, and 15 mm. For the control, I left one wing without any indentation. Later, I deepened the latter two wings by 6 mm each to attain wings with 18 mm and 21 mm of indentation. I then tested the wings in a wind tunnel at a wind speed of 128 km/h. It was found that drag increased as concave increased up to 12 mm of indentation, then afterwards it increased at a slower rate. One explanation is that the indentations cause turbulence, as a result of high-pressure air moving into the low pressure indentation, to a greater degree than it dissipates the vortices. After 12 mm though, the depth of the indentation is approaching a distance greater than the air can travel in the time it spends in the indentation. After that point, the depth of the wingtip indentation is inconsequential; from then on, mitigation of the vortices and the increase in drag caused by turbulence will be proportional. The testing of wings with greater indentation and at higher air speeds to create larger air pressure differentials could more accurately determine the true nature of this pattern. <br><br>

USING GEL ENCAPSULATION AS A VEHICLE TO ISOLATE SERRATIA MARCESCENS TO ENABLE THE PRODUCTION OF A BIOSURFACTANT TO PURIFY CONTAMINATED WATER, YEAR TWO
Caleb Ryan Schneider
O'Donnell High School, O'Donnell, TX

Can Serratia marcescens be gel-encapsulated, retaining its bioactivity? Is it possible to separate the biomass from the biosurfactant produced? Can the biosurfactant lower the surface tension of water, allowing the removal of impurities, without being toxic? Serratia marcescens can be gel-encapsulated, retaining its bioactivity. The gel encapsulation will separate the biomass of Serratia marcescens from the biosurfactant it produces. By lowering the surface tension of water, the biosurfactant can remove impurities, without being toxic. Serratia marcescens cells are encapsulated into gels prepared with TEOS, and incubated. Solutions are tested for the presence of Serratia marcescens cells. The presence of the biosurfactant is tested qualitatively using paper discs, and quantitatively using capillary rise and depression calculations and instrumental analysis. The ability of the biosurfactant to remove E. coli and lead impurities from water is tested and evaluated using turbidity measurements, Petri Films, and a lead spot. Toxicity is measured using bioassays with a model of microbes, plant and animal. Results show the Serratia marcescens is successfully encapsulated in gels. With the addition of biosurfactant to contaminated water samples water samples show only minute amounts of impurity present at the top of the tubes, as compared to the sizable amounts of impurity concentrated at the bottom of the tubes. Serratia marcescens is successfully gel-encapsulated, retaining its bioactivity. The gel encapsulation effectively separates the biomass of the Serratia marcescens from the biosurfactant it produces. By lowering the surface tension of water significantly, the biosurfactant can effectively removes the impurities, without being toxic.

THE LIFT ASSIST - SECOND EDITION
Blake LaWayne Price
Happy High School, Happy, Texas, USA

The second edition of the Lift Assist, a geriatric help device, was designed and tested on both able bodied and elderly people with a certified EMT present. The device is designed to help an elderly person safely rise from a seated position. It is cost effective and was designed with ergonomics, durability, usability, serviceability, and cost in mind. The second edition of the Lift Assist uses an electric actuator to power the pull bars. This reduces the need for an elderly person to use their upper-body strength. Elderly people testing the device were timed rising from a chair without the aid of the device and while using the device. The subjects then completed a survey and ranked their ease and stability with and without the aid of the Lift Assist. On a scale of 1 (worst) to 5 (best) the people gave the Lift Assist a 4.9 for stability, and a 4.8 for ease, compared to 3.8 and 3.5 without the aid of the Lift Assist. A student-t test showed that my device significantly improved stability and ease when rising from a chair. The cost of the lift assist was $394.20. This means that the Lift Assist is an affordable and ergonomic device for the elderly care market.

THE EFFECT OF BORON CONTENT ON THE THERMAL STABILITY OF NANOSTRUCTURED NICKEL
Rohit Gupta
United Nations International School, New York NY, 10010

Nanostructured materials contain small grains of less than one hundred nanometers in diameter and thus exhibit enhanced properties, such as strength and toughness. However, at elevated temperatures, grains grow by merging together, leading to the loss of these properties; therefore maintaining grain size is of special interest. This investigation determined the effect of boron on the thermal stability of nanonickel. Samples of both nanonickel and boron-doped nanonickel were annealed at different temperatures and then studied by X-ray diffraction. The X-ray profiles were modified using Fourier analysis, and afterwards, the Scherrer formula was used to calculate grain size. The resulting analysis showed that nanonickel is unstable at temperatures above 473K, whereas boron-doped nanonickel is more thermally stable, with insignificant grain growth up to temperatures of 573K. Hence, adding interstitial elements such as boron is important to improve thermal stability of nanostructured materials. A possible explanation for this effect is that boron, which has a small atomic radius, can act as an interstitial without causing excessive strain, hence becoming a barrier against grain growth. Boron may also be able to create new bonds at the grain boundaries, which increases the interface energy required for grain growth. This investigation is an important first step in the development of nanostructured materials for practical applications such as airplane propellers which may involve elevated temperatures. Further investigations will study the effect of boron on the other properties of nanonickel as well as the optimal concentration of boron for thermal stability.

HYBRID ROCKETRY: ENHANCING PERFORMANCE OF PARAFFIN AS A FUEL
Kirk Michael Davenport
Tullahoma High School, Tullahoma, Tennessee, United States

The idea for this project came from viewing tests made on paraffin rockets. Inefficiency was seen in the tests and a question arose of whether or not the efficiency of paraffin as a fuel could be improved. The purpose of this experiment was to design and construct a hybrid rocket engine that uses interchangeable paraffin based combustion chambers in order to test the variations of paraffin fuel. From this point a design was made for the engine using the idea of bolting two endplates, one on each side of a PVC segment, together. One of the endplates would have a nozzle drilled into it and the other a port in which to connect the oxidizer supply. The combustion chambers were made by filling PVC segments with variations of paraffin and aluminum screen. <br><br> This project was successful in showing that a hybrid rocket motor incorporating easily interchangeable combustion chambers can be built and fired. However, due to backflow issues in the chamber the thrust was erratic. Therefore, in order to obtain in order to collect substantial data that issue must be resolved.<br><br>

ON TUMOR TARGETING BACTERIA AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NOVEL POPULATION CONTROL CIRCUIT
Nirav Vanraj Lakhani
North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, Durham, North Carolina, USA

It has been proposed that synthetic genetic circuits with virtually any desired function can be constructed from a network of simple regulatory elements. Here, a system for genetically engineering E.coli bacteria to destroy tumors of epithelial origin is offered. Tumor-targeting function of these bacteria is defined by three novel synthetic genetic circuits. The first, named Targeted Localization, is responsible for preferential binding of the bacteria to cancer cells through antibody display via the C-terminus of Immunoglobulin A1 Protease; the second, named Discriminate Killing, is responsible for quorum sensing induced invasion of bacteria into cancer cells and delivery of a cytotoxic agent to act against the cancer cells; and the third, named Regulated Suicide, induces apoptosis of the bacteria once they have destroyed the tumor. A mathematical model of combined circuit function was coupled with experimental data collected to validate the predicted function of the bacteria. The Regulated Suicide circuit was constructed and validated in TOP10F´ E.coli cultures. Effective population control was demonstrated experimentally in the Regulated Suicide circuit by using optical density as a measure of population density of the bacteria. Additional small molecule experiments substantiated the correlation between quorum sensing and induced bacterial death in the engineered E.coli. Although this system was developed for tumor targeting, the genetic circuits are widely adaptable for any antibody targeting system, and can be modified to become a drug delivery, gene delivery, or population control system.<br><br>

DESIGN OF AN AERODYNAMICALLY-ENHANCED PLASMA FOR SYNTHESIS OF NANOPARTICLES
Rohith Chandrasekar
Princeton High School, Princeton, NJ, USA

Metastable nanomaterials such as cubic Boron Nitride (c-BN) have thus far been synthesized only as films on a substrate, at high temperatures and high pressures, using a combination of ion bombardment and biases. Such processes suffer from three weaknesses: <br><br>1. Films produced using these methods are of poor quality - they have a layered structure of various forms of the compound (such as t-BN, a-BN along with c-BN). <br><br>2. The processes used are not reliable, repeatable and robust in a manufacturing environment. <br><br>3. Such methods do not allow in-situ laser diagnostics as a means of instant measurement and quality control.<br><br>Discussed here is the design of an apparatus that would eliminate all the above weaknesses - hence scalable for the mass production of high yield, high purity metastable nanoparticles - such as c-BN - at low pressures, without a substrate, without bias and without ion bombardment. This setup involves the Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) in a quasi one-dimensional stagnation flowfield. The thermal plasmas employed permit the processing of a large number of possible precursors in the solid, liquid, and vapor phases, and hence allowing for the synthesis of non-oxides, such as nitrides. The aerodynamic stagnation flowfields allow for the manipulation of the residence time of the nanoparticles in the reaction zone, during which in-situ laser diagnostics could be easily conducted.

THE EFFICIENCY OF BRIDGE TRUSS BASED ON FORCE RESISTANCE COMPARED TO COST ANALYSIS
Rachel Estelle Coleman
Westview High School, Martin, TN

This project examined bridge truss design efficiency based on cost analysis and force resistance of each bridge design. The hypothesis stated the Baltimore truss would be the most efficient design having the greatest force resistance compared to cost analysis. <br><br> Blueprints were constructed for the Warren, Howe, and Baltimore truss bridges. The Pratt blueprint was downloaded from the WestPoint website. Then three bridges of each design were constructed. Each bridge was exposed to a stress test to determine the amount of force the bridge could withstand before collapsing. The real-world cost of constructing each bridge design was assessed, allowing for a cost analysis of each compared to its force resistance.<br><br> The average forces held and total costs were 7.904 kg by the Baltimore cost of $190,740.14, 6.959 kg by the Pratt cost of $176,677.23, 6.956 kg by the Warren cost of $179,410.66, and 3.761 kg by the Howe cost of $199,530.61.<br><br> The data supported the hypothesis showing the Baltimore Truss to have the greatest force resistance; the cost analysis revealed it was also the most cost efficient with a cost of $24,131.10 per kilogram of force resistance a total cost of $190,740.14 for the bridge construction. If working under the constraints of a tight budget, however, it might be considered that for a total price of $173,677.23, the Pratt Truss Design was a close second with a cost of $24,958.39 per kilogram of force resistance.

DECREASING THE APOPTOTIC THRESHOLD OF HYPOXIC MCF-7 CANCER CELLS THROUGH THE CO-ADMINISTRATION OF CERAMIDE AND PACLITAXEL IN POLYMERIC NANOPARTICLES
Ana Marie Lyons
Mecosta-Osceola Math, Science & Technology Center, Big Rapids, MI

Solid tumor pathophysiology is known to demonstrate a variety of physically impairing and intracelluraly defective conditions unique to nearly 90% of all cancer malignancies. Such conditions displayed in solid tumors induce various degrees of chronic hypoxia and multi-drug resistance, often times resulting in residual cancer growth and proliferation. To overcome the multi-drug resistance found in hypoxic tumors, this research aimed to isolate a more effective method of anticancer therapy through the use of a polymeric nanoparticle drug delivery system. A specially formulated poly(epsilon-carprolactone) (PEO-PCL) polymeric nanoparticle with a surface poly(ethylene oxide) modification was loaded with a ceramide and paclitaxel co-administration therapy and was tested for efficacy under a simulated hypoxic environment. Results show that MCF-7 human adenocarcinoma cells indeed express a multi-drug resistant phenotype when exposed to incubation under hypoxic conditions, as determined through western blotting, apoptotic imaging, and cell viability studies. Interestingly, results also indicate that the free-traveling paciltaxel-ceramide combination was the most efficient at restoring apoptotic signaling and resensitizing the amount of drug needed in relation to the effective dose administered in non-drug resistant cancer cells, as opposed to treatment delivered via polymeric nanoparticle. Because nanoparticles are specifically designed for optimum efficiency under in vivo conditions, the success of the novel paclitaxel-ceramide coadministration therapy - even though expressed in free-traveling form - nevertheless shows promise for the implementation of a similar polymeric nanoparticle therapy when administered beyond the restrictions of the cellular level.

LOW REYNOLDS NUMBER AERODYNAMICS, PHASE 3: MICRO AIR VEHICLE AIRFOIL, ASPECT RATIO, AND PLANFORM OPTIMIZATION
John Pease Moore, IV
Dayton Christian High School, Dayton Ohio, USA

The purpose of this project is to design a fully operational Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) that conforms to the DARPA and International MAV Competition regulations. A MAV is defined as a micro-sized aircraft in which no linear dimension exceeds 6”. <br><br> This is the third phase of a five year project researching low Reynolds number aerodynamics. The engineering goal of this phase is to conduct Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), run a Design of Experiments (DoE), conduct Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO), and fabricate a fully operational MAV. <br><br> The CFD program XFOIL was used to optimize three airfoils for three figures-of-merit: maximizing the lift coefficient, minimizing the drag coefficient, and achieving a pitching moment of zero. A DoE was conducted to reduce the full factorial of wind tunnel and computational experiments down to the desired number. In the case of the wind tunnel experiments, the number of test articles was reduced from 27 to 18. An MDO methodology was implemented to achieve the optimum MAV configuration. In this optimization procedure, an analytical code was written to optimize the MAV configuration for flight endurance subject to a maximum dimension of six inches. Both one and two panel wing configurations were optimized. The optimum configuration had a two-panel geometry, and the predicted endurance was 38 min. and 48 sec. <br><br> This project has shown that CFD, DoE, and MDO approaches can be used to generate a feasible MAV configuration. A MAV geometry has been optimized for flight duration, and a prototype has been built and flight-tested. <br><br>

AUXETIC ACOUSTICS: A NOVEL INSULATION FOR NAVAL APPLICATION
Andrew Mitchell Romine
Unionville High School, Kennett Square, PA

Submarines need insulation that provides sound absorption and dissipation over a broad spectrum while retaining characteristics of flexibility, light weight, and durability in naval environments. This project evaluated properties of open-celled, polyurethane foam modified by the student researcher to yield a negative Poisson’s Ratio (Auxetic Foam) compared with untreated material (Regular Foam).<br><br><br>Five samples of each type of foam were used for each 186-hour test. Thermal extremes at 100 degC and -20 degC were compared with the ambient 19 degC. Aquatic tests included freshwater, saltwater, and 30% humidity exposures. Both foams appeared stable in every tested environment, except extreme heat caused the loss of auxetic qualities over time. <br><br><br>Because the equipment used for measuring acoustic properties required large samples of auxetic foam, the student researcher engineered a new procedure for making the test samples. Several failures, modifications, and refinements led to a process that reliably made fully auxetic, uniform, large samples. The 30.5 cm x 30.5 cm samples were tested in a freshwater tank for acoustic properties between 20 kHz and 150 kHz. Both foams attenuated sound, but Auxetic Foam proved a much greater sound attenuator at high frequencies.<br><br><br>In undersea uses, Auxetic Foam is more practical than Regular Foam. It maintains enhanced properties in all environments tested, except heat. High heat applications might not be a problem if the Auxetic Foam is kept compressed. Flexible, light weight, and durable Auxetic Foam clearly improved acoustic damping. An unexpected result was the observation that Auxetic Foam might also provide enhanced performance as a sponge.

CONVERTING WASTED KINETIC ENERGY INTO ELECTRICAL ENERGY
Patrick Charles Thornton
Pleasant Grove High School, Texarkana, Texas, USA 

The engineering goal of this project was to convert wasted kinetic energy into electrical energy. A wind turbine that powered an electromagnet was built and mounted on a stand. A foot-pump ws used to fuel the wind turbine through the release of air. The wind turbine required 120 psi of air to fully power a light source. The experimental design was created to simulate the act of pedestrians walking over a pump-like object to fill a tank that could power a turbine. The turbine could potentially fuel traffic signals or other electrical needs.

YIELDING TO PEDESTRIANS
Nicholas Samir Ekladyous
Cranbrook Kingswood Upper School, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan USA

Pedestrian-vehicle accidents are a globally recognized safety concern. This has resulted in stringent Phase-II European Union safety regulations effective 2010. Every year, thousands of pedestrians are killed in car accidents. Nearly 80% of the fatalities are caused when the pedestrian's head hits the vehicle hood/bonnet. The purpose of this project is to maximize pedestrian protection by optimizing hood material selection & design to outperform existing industry solutions. A system was created using multi-objective optimization to minimize competing objectives of: Head Injury Criteria (HIC), weight & cost. Hood design variables included: high strength steel, alluminum, stainless steel & geometry.<br><br>Analytical head impact results were determined by 3D non-linear transient Finite Element Analysis. Headform deceleration curves from the FEA analyses were used to compute HIC values. A full factorial DOE with three variables & three levels was created. HIC, weight & cost values were used to determine the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) functions that approximate the three objective functions. MATLAB optimization was then used to minimize the normalized objective functions.<br><br>Results show a combination of: FEA, RSM & Optimization technology can yield results quickly & efficiently to maximize pedestrian protection given competing objectives. For hood design, the optimum solution was a homogeneous design of: stainless steel material for the outer panel, stainless steel for the inner panel & X-Hood geometry. The optimal design outperformed baseline hood designs by 70% for HIC values & outperformed passive protection hood designs by 50% for HIC values. A patent application was submitted for the optimal design.

LEGGED MOBILE ROBOTS
Collin David Arnold
John Marshall High School, San Antonio TX, United States

Natural disasters such as earthquakes and tornados can cause considerable damage to man-made structures and cause great loss of life and property. One of the inherent dangers during recovery from such catastrophes is the vast amount of wreckage strewn about as well as the possibility of collapsing buildings while rescuers are removing debris or searching for survivors. This research project addresses that problem by asking whether a mobile legged robot could be built that would be able to traverse the uneven ground caused by wreckage and even enter unstable buildings in search of survivors who might be trapped or injured.<br><br> A legged mobile robot design was chosen over a tracked vehicle because of it efficiency and ability to traverse more unstable terrain such as gravel or loose debris. A tracked vehicle wastes much more power on turning and may not be able to pass through some debris-covered areas. Such a robot was designed and constructed. The prototype was constructed from LEGO blocks and then a more refined model was constructed from aluminum. Tests showed that the mobile legged robot was able to move about adequately and the design shows promise as a rescue vehicle in situations where human lives might be endangered.<br><br>

This research project’s target was synthesis of bismuth nanowires 200 nanometers in diameter and about 10 microns long. Growth of these wires involved an evaporative process. A small Al2O3 crucible was placed in a tungsten boat. The crucible was filled with 5 g of 99.9995% bismuth and was capped with a porous anodized Al2O3 template and a molybdenum plate. The boat was placed between two resistive heating posts in a vacuum chamber which was evacuated to 1.0 x 10-6 torr, to ensure that no oxidation occurred during growth. 200 amperes were driven through the heating posts, heating the crucible and evaporating the bismuth. After 1.5 minutes the current was gradually decreased, allowing the bismuth to crystallize within the pores of the alumina template from. Once the system was fully cooled, the alumina template was removed and placed in a selective acid etch that dissolved the Al2O3, leaving behind the bismuth nanowires. A few drops of suspension were then placed on a silicon chip and imaged using an SEM. Insofar, templates are heavily embedded with bismuth, and SEM images have shown 50 micron wires in template. These wires have been successfully removed with etch and imaged on silicon chips.

DETERMINING A MORE EFFICIENT METHOD FOR THE TRANSFORMATION AND GROWTH OF BACTERIAL PLASMIDS
Kathryn Ann Del Vecchio
Century High School, Bismarck, ND

Purpose: To develop a more efficient variation of the standard operating procedure for the transformation and growth of bacterial plasmids. This procedure varies the time of introduction of antibiotic to determine the least stressful method.<br><br>Procedure:<br><br>Control: Standard Operating Procedure - Transform cells and immediately plate 250 uL on an agar plate with 250 uL of antibiotic. Incubate at 37 degrees Celsius for 24 hours. Count colonies that appear.<br><br>Trial A: Transform cells and plate on an agar plate containing 250 uL antibiotic. Introduce cells at Hour 0 (SOP), 1, 2, 6, and 12. Incubate plates at same conditions as control. Count colonies that appear.<br><br>Trial B: Transform cells and plate 250 uL on agar plate without antibiotic. Introduce cells at Hour 0, 1, 2, 6, and 12. 20 minutes after the introduction of the cells, add 250 uL of antibiotic. Incubate cells at same conditions as control. Count colonies that appear.<br><br>Results: Trial A was more successful than Trial B. In A, colonies grew steadily except for decreases in cell survival around hour 6. B was doing well, although there continued to be a slightly less yield from the cells in B compared to A.<br><br>Conclusion: In Trial A, cells proliferated exponentially and would have continued to do so after hour 12. In Trial B, at the 12th hour, no cells were present. This could be an isolated incident due to experimental anomaly or it could be a legitimate occurence. Further experimentation could reveal what happened to the cells of B.

AN EXTERNAL BALANCE SYSTEM FOR A SMALL SCALE WIND TUNNEL
Andrew Scott Holder
Tullahoma High School, Tullahoma, TN, United States

The engineering goal of this project was to design and build an external balance to measure lift and drag in a small scale wind tunnel. Small wind tunnel testing is more cost efficient than large wind tunnel testing; therefore has many applied uses.<br><br> Aluminum flexures, linkages and clamps were used in the construction of the external balance. Strain gauges applied to the flexures provided the means to measure output in micro amps for lift and drag. <br><br> During assembly of the balance with the original design, it became apparent that the balance system as designed was extremely flexible. Therefore, a series of modifications were made. <br><br> A small scale wind tunnel, with a fan specifically constructed for this project was used to conduct tests on an airfoil. Wind tunnel calibrations were performed to measure free stream dynamic pressure, which was used in the calculation of the coefficients of lift and drag. Tests with the fan on at various angles of attack were performed and lift and drag micro amp outputs were recorded. <br><br> The air-on lift data were found to be repeatable and varied with angle of attack. The air-on drag data were not as good as desired, partly because the air velocity was lower than expected and because of other concerns primarily related to the instrumentation equipment. <br><br> Overall, this particular design of an external balance was found to be useful in measuring lift and drag for a small scale wind tunnel. <br><br><br><br>

RESEARCH, ENGINEERING, AND DESIGN OF A HARD SURFACE SAILER (PART II)
Christopher Brennan Long
Angel's Rest Homeschool, Pearisburg, VA, United States of America

The objective of this project was to further evaluate the performance of a set of paired symmetrical wings and to investigate ways to create a safe and efficient landsailer. Research was conducted in the design specifics of various components and subassemblies suitable for use in a full-scale demonstration prototype. After creating an initial design, two sets of airfoil analysis using JavaFoil were conducted: The first was of three sets of wings: parallel, toe-in, and toe-out. The second was of an inverted airfoil that would act similar to a spoiler. It was determined that using an inverted wing (airfoil) would be a more efficient way to correct heeling forces than using the traditional system of using ballast.The manned vehicle was designed with four wheels instead of three because it offered a more stable platform.<br><br> The landsailer was fabricated in two parts. The body consists of two bicycles and several carbon fiber rods that were used to keep them parallel. . The second part was the sail which were made of two symmetrical vertical wings (NACA 0012) connected by an arch at the top. The wing is attached to the body by a male and female connection. The male connection was made from the neck of a motorcycle which allows the wings to spin 360 degrees allowing it to adjust relevant to the wind direction. This allows for recreational applications and also increases the safety and simplicity of operation.<br><br> In the future, further testing and modifications are planned.<br><br>

PLATINUM NANOPARTICLES: FROM HYDROGEN STORAGE TO CANCER TREATMENT
Daniel Scott Katz
Hebrew Academy of The Five Towns and Rockaways, Cedarhurst, New York, U.S.A

Platinum, on the bulk scale, offers unique catalytic and conductive abilities but when brought down to the nanoscale, its properties are both altered and enhanced due to the increased surface-to-volume ratio. This research discovered that on the nanoscale, platinum is toxic to cells; however, if coated with specific targeting agents, the platinum nanoparticle’s destructive abilities can be utilized to destroy cancerous cells while leaving healthy somatic cells unharmed. This research devised a simple one step method to coat platinum nanoparticles with folic acid, since cancerous cells require exponentially greater amounts of folic acid than do normal cells; this “tricks” cancerous cells into absorbing the toxic platinum nanoparticles. This “nanotherapy” has the potential to treat cancers without the devastating side effects of current chemotherapies. <br><br> This research has also discovered that platinum nanoparticles have a high affinity for hydrogen and are capable of absorbing, on average, 31.78% hydrogen by mass. Currently, fuel cells require the use of hydrogen stored at high pressure in its gaseous form; however, this is very dangerous in mobile applications due to the explosive nature of hydrogen gas. This research has devised a method of storing hydrogen in an aqueous solution of colloidal platinum nanoparticles, circumventing the possibility of undesirable hydrogen reactivity. This finding is significant in increasing the safety and efficiency of fuel cells.<br><br>

A STUDY ON PRACTICAL PRODUCTION OF HYDROGEN THROUGH EFFICIENT ELECTROLYSIS
Nigel Forest Reuel
Rio Rancho High School, Rio Rancho NM, United States of America

This experiment’s purpose was to see which of the many variables of electrolysis were significant factors to influencing electrical efficiency and under what conditions electrolysis was most efficient. <br><br> Hydrogen gas was collected off the cathode and measured in moles. By knowing the specific energy per mass ratio of hydrogen and dividing it by the total energy put into the experiment through electricity, electrical efficiency was found. <br><br> The driving factors of electrolysis were found to be pressure and salt concentration. The optimum conditions for efficient electrolysis were: a salt concentration of .0672 molar, ambient pressure of 100,000 Pascals, and a water temperature of 295 Kelvin. At this point, the predicted efficiency is 92%, which means that 92% of the energy inputted into electrolysis can be stored by the gaseous hydrogen produced. <br><br> Some further studies on this question would include: what happens at higher salt concentrations and could this information be applied to a small garage-sized device that could produce cheap hydrogen through Photovoltaic solar panels?

INVESTIGATING THE AERODYNAMICS OF A LIFTING BODY
Derik Thomas Bowen
Longshore Homeschool, Billings, Montana, USA

My experiment with NASA's existing X-33 VentureStar model was to try to expand cargo space and still have an aerodynamically stable lifting body. <br><br>Since the X-33 was never actually built and flown, there wasn't much information in print. I searched the Internet for information on the X-33,as well as contacted NASA for any information they could send me. <br><br>For my project, I built 3 lifting bodies to a 31.5 scale. I designed my control rocket to be an exact replica of the X-33, #1 was designed with a convex face, and #2 was designed with a convex bottom. My hypothesis was that my control rocket would be the most stable. I flew each lifting body twice and measured altitude from a seventy-five yard baseline using the triangulation method. I also tracked the aerodynamics and flight patterns of each rocket. My control was very stable in powered flight, and also in gliding descent. Lifting body #1 was very stable in powered flight, however in descent, the convex face caused the air flow to direct too high over the rudders, causing the rudders to be useless. This caused #1 to yaw and pitch. Lifting body #2 was very unstable both in powered flight and in gliding. It had rudder control, but the air flow rolled over the wings and ailerons, and they were useless. <br><br>My conclusion was my control and #1 were the most stable, and #1 would be most efficient for increasing payload size if the rapid descent could be controlled.

THE LOGIC PROJECT: WORKING WITH RELAY AND PLC LOGIC
Amanda Christine Sturges
Laurel Scholl, Shaker Heights, Ohio, United States

Two types of control logic were studied in this project, relay logic and PLC logic. A stack light was run using both relays and a PLC. The PLC was found to be more effective than the relays because the relays had a limited number of contacts. To continue the study of programming logic, a PLC was programmed to run a two-axis stepper system that had platforms on a screw. The demonstration includes proximity switches, the stepper system, and stepper controllers along with the PLC. The system is programmed to run at different speeds at different positions, and to overcome mechanical problems in a variety of different scenarios. Continuations of this project include programming more complicated tasks and using more sophisticated devices, including encoders, counters, servos, and other feedback devices.

INTEGRATION OF CDS-SENSITIZED NANOBELTS ON A ZNO NANOWIRE ARRAY IN SOLAR CELLS
Maryann Chenting Tung
Saint Mary's Academy, Portland, OR

We report an entirely inorganic solar cell. In this solar cell, the CdS nanoparticles that serve as an inexpensive and stable light absorbing material are attached to the nanobelts without the use of any organic materials. Furthermore, the traditionally highly resistive n-type semiconductor is replaced by a TiO2 nanobelt/ZnO nanowire array hybrid that serves as a porous and conductive n-type semiconductor capable of absorbing more photons while also allowing for rapid electron transportation. The fabrication of this entirely inorganic solar cell has the potential to accelerate the wide-scale implementation of solar energy.

ACTIVE SOLAR HEAT AND INSULATION
Bryan Edward Vanderloos, Hysham Public High School
Hysham, Montana, Treasure County

My project entitled "Active Solar Heat and Insulation", the goal of the project is to trap solar energy inside the solar colletor. The process starts as water flows in and through the flooring substance. Once the water passes through it will then flow into the collector, as water heats it will rise, based on the principle of a thermosyphon. The floor types are three unalike substances of concrete, wood, and sand with tile.<br><br>After the water rises and flows into the collector, the water then travels back to the origin from which it started. The project operates off of the basis of "passive" solar energy, which states that energy collected can be controlled by a switch or turn on or off. The system is continuous and as long as the sun hits the collector, the floor heat will rise.<br><br>The purpose of the flooring substances is to define which substance could trap the most and retain the most energy as in heat.

SOLAR SOLUTIONS
Anna-Marie Gulotta
Charlottesville High School, Charlottesville, Virginia, U.S.A.

In this project I produced a solar oven for use in the winter at higher latitudes that is durable, lightweight, weather-resistant, and constructed with easily replaceable parts. Such a solar oven could provide long-term use for people in refugee situations or for the military while on extended operations. Using data from my science fair project “Simply Solar,” I constructed a solar oven that could withstand weather damage. I constructed the solar oven to have parts that are easy to fix and replace should damage from travel or accident occur. In order be durable and weather resistant, the solar oven is constructed of manmade, heat resistant materials that are not biodegradable or subject to rust. I used Plexiglas and housing insulation foam because they are durable and weather resistant, while still being relatively lightweight and easily portable. I chose a square design because it allows for interchangeable sides, aiding construction and replacement. By attaching the parts of the oven with Velcro, it is easier to fix and maintain the oven over time. Initially, I used metallic paints to provide a durable, reflective finish, but the first trial demonstrated that the metallic paints were not sufficiently reflective. I changed the reflective material on the reflector and inner walls to Plexiglas mirror. My research resulted in an oven that reached a maximum temperature of 208°F and demonstrated greater heat retention than the “Simply Solar” solar oven, making the new oven a durable option for winter use.

THE REMOVAL OF ALLERGEN-PRODUCING DUST MITES USING ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION
Xue Chi
Southside High School, Greenville, SC, US

The goal of this project is to remove as many dust mites (Dermatophagoides farinae) from carpets using ultraviolet light without decreasing the carpet’s durability. Two different wavelengths of 10-Watt UV light were used: 365 nm and 254 nm. <br><br>An attachment of sheet metal was added to a vacuum accessory to shield users from the UV and to ensure that only the dust mites were exposed to the UV. This provides a method of vacuuming with ultraviolet lights in the most efficient way possible. The effectiveness of the ultraviolet light on dust mite removal was measured by vacuuming carpet samples that had been previously exposed to dust mites and then testing the amount of mites vacuumed using a dust mite test kit. <br><br>The tensile strength of the carpet was then tested to determine if UV light had any negative effects on the carpet’s durability. Small carpet samples were exposed to ultraviolet light, then were unraveled to test the tensile strength of the carpet strands. <br><br>Ultraviolet light was shown to have a significant effect on the amount of dust mites collected from the carpet. In the case of the 254 nm light, the amount of dust mites removed increased 2 categories from the mild category to the heavy category. Furthermore, the tensile strength of the carpet remained fairly constant, with the tensile strength decreasing by only 4 N (9.2%). In conclusion, ultraviolet light was found to be an effective method in the removal of allergen-producing dust mites without damaging the carpet’s durability. <br><br>

HYDROGEN - THE FUEL OF THE FUTURE
Brigham Colorado Arce
Spanish Fork High School, Spanish Fork, UT

This project researched the possibility of running an automobile engine by using hydrogen gas derived from water, or at a minimum, increasing the vehicle’s gasoline mileage by mixing hydrogen into the regular engine gasoline. <br><br> I built an electrolysis chamber in which electricity dissociated water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen gas, and then installed it into my car through the air intake manifold. Water was introduced into the electrolysis chamber, and the car operated. This engine modification resulted in the vehicle’s gas mileage increasing significantly. The data supporting this conclusion was obtained by recording the vehicle’s mileage in a series of tests conducted with and without the chamber in use. Superb results occurred from each test which was conducted using the electrolysis chamber. I calculated that the car averaged slightly over thirty percent improved gasoline mileage when hydrogen gas mixed with the gasoline, as compared to the normal mileage obtained without it. <br><br> This project showed that fuel efficiency increases when hydrogen gas augments the normal gasoline used in an automobile engine. Further research would be, first, to find a means to produce hydrogen gas more rapidly so that possibly less gasoline is required and secondly, to study the change in exhaust emissions to determine if the exhaust created by this engine modification is more environmentally friendly then normal emissions. This research also points to the possibility that it might eventually be possible to power automobiles solely by using hydrogen derived from water. <br><br>

THE EFFECT OF GRAPHENE OXIDE NANOFILLERS ON POLYVINYL ACETATE TENSILE STRENGTH
Kekeli Mauwena Dawes
Spring Valley High School, Columbia, SC

The purpose of this experiment is to determine if suspended graphene can be used as a strengthening nanofiller in polyvinyl acetate composites. Graphene is an atom-thick sheet of graphite that has high electrical capabilities that can be easily exfoliated by suspending oxidized graphite in polar substances like water. However, present exfoliation methods result in small, nanometer-wide flakes. There are transparent films and papers of layered GO flakes that exhibit exceptional electrical capabilities that can be used as transparent electrodes and paper-thin wires. It has not been shown that GO’s nanoscale strength capabilities can translate to thin films or as a nanofiller in low concentrations. In this study, polyvinyl acetate-graphene nanocomposites usually used for electrical purposes were tested for tensile strength. It was hypothesized that composites with the GO nanofiller present would display an acute increase in tensile strength. The GO was exfoliated using a modified Hummers method. Polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) was dissolved in acetone with different amounts of GO present. The GO was suspended in water. There were two nanocomposites made; one with 30mL of GO suspension, and one with 15mL of suspension. The control consisted of 30mL of distilled water. The PVAc composites were then cut into uniform stubs and were fastened to a table to be tested for tensile strength using a spring scale. The readings for 30 trials for each composite were analyzed using an ANOVA test. The results indicate the presence of GO positively effected the tensile strength of PVAc.

GREASE IT UP
Amber Bullard

J. R. Jones Grain is a grain elevator that is owned and operated by my family. On a hot summer day in the middle of wheat season, our yardman came in the office complaining because several bearings had gone out in the past month. He blamed it on the grease not being able hold up in the heat and suggested using another type. <br><br> At this point in time, I was not even aware that different types of greases existed. After doing some research and discovering that there were various greases for different purposes, I wanted to do some researching of my own to find out if the most recommended multi-purpose grease was indeed the best choice.<br><br> In order to determine this, the properties of a NIGL#2 GC-LB Lithium Complex EP Grease, a Petroleum Hydrocarbon Grease with a graphite additive, and a Petroleum Hydrocarbon Grease will be tested under varying temperatures and on different surfaces.<br><br>If the four greases are compared, then the Petroleum Hydrocarbon Grease with a graphite additive will be the most viscous, while the NIGL#2 GC-LB Lithium Complex EP Grease will have the greatest temperature range.<br><br> While the temperatures did affect the greases differently, the NIGL#2 GC-LB Lithium Complex EP Grease proved to be the most efficient choice for a wooden surface. On the other hand, Petroleum Hydrocarbon Grease with a graphite additive will work best on the metal surface and the Petroleum Hydrocarbon Grease proved to be the best choice for the rubber surface.<br><br>

FINDING THE FAULTY FRAYS IN AIRCRAFT WIRING

As aircraft begin to age, tiny arcs or frays are developing in the wiring systems. These pose serious hazards to the safety of aircraft’s immensely complex electrical systems. Millions of hours are spent each year trying to manually locate these tiny arcs. <br><br> Previous experimentation has shown that time domain reflectometry (TDR) can be used to locate these frays. However, TDR has several limitations that inhibit its feasability of being applied to modern aircraft. This project investigates two new fray detection methods, Spread Spectrum Time Domain Reflectometry (SSTDR) and Sequence Time Domain Reflectometry (STDR). The goal of this project is to find alternate fray detection methods that are accurate, reliable, cost effective, convenient, and that overcome the limitations of TDR.<br><br> For the experiment, pairs of identical wires, damaged and functional, are connected to the testing instrument and an electrical impulse is transmitted down the wire. The testing instrument measures the reflection from the impulse. An engineering software program called Matlab is then used to make data calculations and produce graphs of the calculated results. The graphs are analyzed and used to make predictions concerning the location of the frays. The fray predictions are then compared to the actual fray locations. From the results, it was concluded that SSTDR and STDR would be more effective and more efficient than TDR in locating hazardous frays in aircraft wiring. Their advantages over TDR combined with their level of accuracy demonstrates the feasibility of integrating small SSTDR and/or STDR systems into aircraft wiring systems.

GLASS BONE IMPLANTS: THE EFFECT OF SURFACE ROUGHNESS ON CELL PROLIFERATION
Raina Himani Jain
Freedom High School, Bethlehem, PA

With increasing life expectancy, a greater percentage of the population suffers from diseases that cause bone destruction. Titanium implants are most commonly used to replace bone, but they cause scarring and have a lifetime of about 15 years. In contrast, Bioglass® (45SiO2-24.5CaO-24.5Na2O-6P2O5) appears more promising with superior bioactivity. Past research on titanium has shown that its surface microarchitecture, in particular the roughness, has a significant effect on the cell proliferation. However, similar information on Bioglass is not available.<br><br> Glass samples were made by melting silicon dioxide, calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate and calcium phosphate tribasic. Varying surface roughnesses were produced by polishing the samples with silicon carbide paper of different grit sizes and with cerium oxide. The roughnesses were measured using a profilometer. MG63 osteosarcoma cells, which proliferated for different periods of times (2, 48, 96, 144 hrs) on the glass surfaces, were photographed using an inverted fluorescent microscope and counted manually. <br><br> The results reveal that after the initial stress from trypsin, the cells recover and begin to proliferate. The cell proliferation increases with increasing surface smoothness. In the early stages of proliferation the cells tend to be rounded and clumped together on rough surfaces in contrast to being elongated and spread out on smoother glass surfaces. For the first time, cell alignment was observed on glass, when the scratch width was comparable to the cell size. These findings should help improve implant performance by reducing the period of a patient’s immobilization after an implant surgery.

A SENSING SYSTEM BASED ON LASER INTENSITY CHANGES DUE TO OPTICAL FIBER VIBRATION
Michelle Louie
Kings Park High School, Kings Park, NY, USA

The purpose of this project was to construct a sensing system based on Laser intensity changes due to optical fiber vibration. When photons left the Laser source and entered the optical fiber at an incident angle, they continued to propagate through the fiber by successive internal reflections. When the fiber was bent, the length of the path of photons was altered. The degree and number of reflected angles determined the resulting Laser intensity. This change in Laser intensity was used to calculate the displacement of the optical fiber. The body of the fiber was first situated adjacent to the accelerometer on the vibration table that was rested on the top of an audio speaker. The optical fiber was then aligned with the Laser. The end of the fiber was connected to the photon detector to determine the changes in Laser intensity, which were displayed by the oscilloscope and spectrum analyzer. A baseline was established, then pre-determined sine waves frequencies of 100Hz to 500Hz were produced by the waveform generator. Each increment was tested when the resulting air pressure caused the vibration table to vibrate the fiber. The oscilloscope displayed the waveforms of the sensing system and the generator, which proved the quality of the system-generated sine wave. Data from the spectrum analyzer were used to determine the amplitudes of each frequency, which was necessary for displacement calculation. The optical fiber displacement was equal to the acceleration divided by the square of omega, where omega is equaled to (2)(pi)(frequency). Calculated displacements for each harmonic motion were 4.77, 1.00, 2.71, 0.97, 0.52, 0.47, 0.25, 0.11 micrometers. Thus, the system was proven to detect optical fiber micro-vibration as small as 0.11 micrometers. Applications for this system include security monitoring, location of victims in collapsed buildings and mineshafts, condition-based maintenance for structural integrity, and all situations involving high electric and magnetic fields and harsh chemical environments.

PARALLEL 2X2 COMBINATORIAL CHEMICAL SYNTHESIS USING A SINGLE-LAYER MICROFLUIDIC CHIP
Joseph Paul Dexter
Green Mountain Union High School, Chester, VT

A novel microfluidic chip for performing parallel combinatorial chemical synthesis was designed, fabricated, and tested. Past studies on microfluidic parallel combinatorial chemical synthesis have generally utilized multilayer glass microchips that are difficult and expensive to fabricate. In this investigation, a single-layer microfluidic chip was designed for conducting 2X2 parallel combinatorial synthesis. The microchip was fabricated from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) using photolithography. A silicon wafer spin-coated with SU-8 photoresist was patterned using a chrome photomask of the channel design. The PDMS microchip was then cast from the SU-8 master and bonded to a glass slide via oxygen plasma treatment. The microfluidic chip was tested by performing a combinatorial series of chemical reactions in it. This investigation constitutes the first ever development of a single-layer microfluidic chip for parallel combinatorial chemical synthesis and should provide a strong basis for effectively applying microfluidics to combinatorial chemistry.

UNCONVENTIONAL MIXTURES FOR COMPUTER LIQUID COOLING
David James Dingeldine
Churchville-Chili Senior High School, Churchville, NY , USA

This project is the result of evaluating unconventional mixtures for the cooling of computer Central Processing Units (CPU) for the purpose of over clocking. The initial idea was to determine the best solution to use for the evacuation of heat produced by the chip. Cooling with a Diluted Ethanol mixture led to an increase of overall system performance.<br><br>Computer performance was determined by the use of 3D Mark 2001 SE and SiSoftware Sandra, which are leading computer benchmarking programs in the industry. Temperature of the CPU and other prominent components were monitored during all tests with the use of thermocouples. The cooling liquids were circulated through the computer via a heat-exchanger system coupled with a copper heat sink placed directly on the CPU chip. It was concluded that the Diluted Ethanol mixture reduced overall system temperatures to allow for an increased rate of clock frequencies. This increase of clock frequencies greatly affected overall system performance.<br><br> <br><br>There were many significant contributions made by this project. First, the increased performance of the cooling system allowed for a large decrease in CPU temperature. This large decrease in the operating temperature of the chip will allow for increased life of the system. Secondly, the decrease in temperature allowed for an over clocking of the CPU, thereby decreasing processing time.

MAPPING ROBOT
George Francis Hotz
Bergen County Academies, Hackensack, NJ, USA

A unique terrain mapping robot is designed. It probes its environment with mounted IR detectors and scans for nearby objects. The coordinates are relayed to a computer via an RF wireless module, which will receive and interpret the data using a C++ program. The program applies various algorithms to the data. It then saves the data to a map file, which is later displayed using a Visual Basic Program.<br><br>On the robot there are two PIC microcontrollers, a PIC16F877 and a PIC16F84. The PIC16F84 acts as a communication buffer so that the main microcontroller does not have any bottlenecks in communication. <br><br>The C++ program uses polar coordinates, an algorithm to find groups of points, and a Convex Hull algorithm to determine the map boundaries.<br><br>

DEVELOPMENT OF AN OPTICAL AND ELECTRICAL AUTOMOBILE CRASH AVOIDANCE SYSTEM
Diana Christine Burk
West Potomac High School, Alexandria, Virginia, USA

Many car accidents are due to obstructions that hinder a driver’s visibility of oncoming traffic. This robust system could be the safe, low-cost, adaptable solution to prevent such automobile collisions. The system was developed to indicate whether it is safe for a vehicle to merge in front of an obscured oncoming vehicle. It consists of a series of optics, a free-space laser link and control circuitry. One of the main components of this system is the Multiple Quantum Well Modulating Retro-Reflector (MRR), which transmits modulated data over a free-space optical link. The system is a new application for the MRR technology, which has previously been used for defense purposes. A long-range optical setup was devised to direct an eye-safe laser beam towards the MRR, which is attached to the oncoming vehicle. The MRR transmits the vehicle speed to the electrical circuits using frequency modulation and optical amplitude modulation. The development of the auto sensor involved mechanical physics to determine the accurate “safe-times” to merge, displayed by a green LED signal. Once it is no longer safe to merge, the LED turns red until the oncoming vehicle passes through the unsafe zone. The LED then resets to green until another vehicle is detected. The four main control circuits were designed, built and tested, and an full system demonstration was then effectively conducted in a laboratory setting. The system is accurate, compact, and adaptable to a variety of roads and highways and could be a new means of accident prevention.

HARNESSING THE FILTRATION ABILITIES OF CAUSTIC HYDROXIDES AS A MEANS OF THE ABATION OF CARBON DIOXIDE FROM AUTOMOBILE EXHAUST
Christen Marshall Robinson
Saginaw Arts and Sciences Academy, Saginaw, MI

The project was chosen because of the want to create a "now" solution to the carbon dioxide problem. The study was made to study, improve, design and create a practical eradicator of carbon dioxide suitable for vehicular usage. The study conducted observed the performance of the reaction over time and in the presence of hydrated and anhydrous air. The hypothesis was that the reaction would perform better in the presence of hydrated air.<br><br>An analytical method to test the reaction will be done using a fluidized bed reactor using calcium hydroxide as the solvent solid. The concentration of carbon dioxide in a standard car was simulated via creating a concentrated mixture of normal [atmospheric] air and carbon dioxide. A 75g sample of calcium hydroxide was placed within the reactor and samples of the "scrubbed" air were collected for a period of 5.5 minutes.<br><br>The amount of carbon dioxide within the gas sample was measured using photometric comparisons, whereas the gas samples each were at high levels of quality and purity from each environment.<br><br>Overall, the experiment performed suggested that the reaction performs better in anhydrous air. Due to the hydroscopic nature calcium hydroxide, it is believed that the surface area of each molecule is reduced where by the water absorbed thereby reducing the area available for reacting.

GONE, WITH THE WIND...
Tara Deane Batson
Pickens High School, Pickens, South Carolina, United States 

I recently went to New Orleans on a mission trip to build houses, and I was changed forever by what I saw. I wanted to find a safer house design for the people of New Orleans who lost everything that they once had, and that we take for granted. While in New Orleans I had learned that much of the damage to a house, in a hurricane starts with the roof. Once the water starts to leak in through the roof, the walls and foundation weaken from there, eventually causing it to collapse. <br><br>I believe that finding a style of roof that will deflect both the wind and rain would be most beneficial in saving homes in the future. So, I came up with four possible designs. The designs included a Concave Slope, a Convex Slope, a sixty degree angle, and a thrity-five degree angled slope. To simulate a hurricane I used a pressure washer which captured the affect of both the wind and the water. As each test model was placed under the impact of the wind and the water I recorded all of my data and organized it into tables and graphs so that it would be easiser to read. <br><br>From these tables and graphs I was able to descern that as I expected the Concave Sloped roofing design would be the most helpful to the people who live in the path of a hurricane.

WIND RESISTANCE: ANLYZING HOUSE STRUCTURES
Mariana Ximena Cruz
Westfield High School, Chantilly, VA, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to analyze structures to prove their resistance to wind loads. In order to test this, a model house in Fort Lauderdale was used to reproduce a similar computer model through a program called SAP2000. This model house was first tested as it would be constructed right now to test its ability to withstand 170mph winds. Because the area’s building code requires the houses to be constructed to withstand a 150mph wind, it was expected that the model would fail. Then, an additional version of the same house was tested. This one, made out of reinforced concrete, proved to be the house able to withstand effectively. Then a physical model was built to prove the results. The two houses were built and put in a wind tunnel to test their strength. In addition, an extra house was built based on the SAP2000 results. This one maintained the same structure as the original house, but a steel cable clamped to the ground was added to provide support and add weight. The purpose of this new house was to provide a “renovation” to give existing houses the ability to resist hurricanes. After the houses were exposed to sustained 50mph winds for five minutes and two trials each, none of them collapsed, but the original house model experienced the most damage. This project was able to give structural alternatives to prevent hurricane damage. The big question lies on the conflict of interests building and insurance companies may have.

A STUDY OF THE DEGRADATION OF THE TWO-WAY EFFECT IN NITI
Scott Alexander Skirlo
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Alexandria, VA

The purpose of this project was to examine the degradation of the Two-way effect in NiTi over several thousand thermal cycles with respect to the hottest and coldest temperatures reached during thermal cycling. The Two-way effect exists only in trained shape memory alloy samples and consists effectively of the material remembering a hot shape and a separate cold shape. The memory of each shape will degrade with repeated thermal cycling. Knowing the impact of cycling temperatures is important for applications and for understanding the mechanisms of degradation. This study utilized stress-strain, resistance-temperature, strain-temperature, and strain-thermal cycle tests to measure the degradation and understand the development of the microstructure. The equipment for this study was constructed from scratch. <br><br> The results show that the degradation of Two-way effect is largely insensitive to variations in the coldest temperature reached during thermal cycling. In contrast, changes in the highest temperature reached during cycling significantly altered the degradation path. By increasing the maximum cycling temperature, the rearrangement of the internal stress field causing the Two-way effect increased, resulting in faster degradation. Lowering the maximum cycling temperature subjected the trained dislocation array to less stress, better maintaining the Two-way effect. The number of dislocations generated during cycling did not appear to vary significantly throughout the tests, suggesting that internal stress rearrangement is the most significant factor in the decrease of the Two-way strain.

HARNESSING THE ENERGY WHICH ESCAPES PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS BY USING A FLAT PLATE SOLAR PANEL
Rebecca Grace Willmott
Langley High School, McLean Virginia

This experiment attempted to improve the efficiency of a photovoltaic (PV) cell and capture a higher percentage of the energy from the sun by introducing a second application: heating water. <br><br> A PV cell turns photons into electrons, or sunlight into electricity. One of a PV cell’s greatest flaws is that many of these photons are lost as heat. This problem worsens at higher temperatures. <br><br> A flat plate solar panel collects heat from the sun in a tube filled with a moving propylene glycol and water mixture. This heat is then transferred by the glycol mix to water in a storage tank.<br><br> In this experiment, the flat plate is used to remove the excess heat from the PV cells to both improve the efficiency of the PV panel and heat the water storage tank. The combined unit was compared against a PV cell by itself and a flat plate by itself. <br><br> The data showed an improvement in the electrical output of the PV cell being cooled by the flat plate. The thermal output of the flat plate combined with the PV remained the same as the control panel directly exposed to sunlight. <br><br> This new design makes solar energy more competitive with less sustainable forms of energy. It can be used in office buildings, homes, military bases, space stations and other buildings where electricity and warm water are needed.<br><br>

ROCKET ROLL A SECOND YEAR STUDY ON AIRPLANE ROLL COMPARING AILERONS AND A PROPELLER WING
Arlo Jeffrey Swallow
Spring Creek High School, Spring Creek, Nevada, U.S.A.

This experiment was designed to test maneuverability, specifically roll—movement about the longitudinal axis—versus speed, involving airplanes. The traditional method of creating roll involves the use of ailerons—small flaps at the end of the wings to turn the plane. The other method I tested, involves twisting the wing to create an airfoil similar to a propeller that I thought would create roll but not disturb the smooth flow over the surface of the wings as much as the ailerons do. I wanted to determine which method maintained the most speed when both are rolling at the same rate.<br><br> My Hypothesis was if the two methods were tested in a wind tunnel, and the aileron wing was adjusted so that it had the same roll rate as the propeller wing, then the propeller wing would travel faster than the aileron wing when shot down a wire by a model rocket engine. I constructed two identical model airplanes; their only difference was one plane had a propeller wing and the other plane incorporated ailerons. The airplanes were first tested in a wind tunnel I designed and timed for their number of rolls per ten seconds. The aileron wing was then adjusted so its configuration would match the number of rolls produced by the propeller wing. After I determined their roll rates were as identical as possible the airplanes were propelled down a guide wire with a model rocket engines. The planes were timed for their speed to discern which method maintains the most speed.<br><br> The aileron wing had a 2.61% slower roll rate in the wind tunnel. The speeds of the two planes, however, were significantly different. The aileron plane was 14.57% slower than the propeller wing. My hypothesis was correct. A propeller shaped wing not only will create roll for an airplane, but also will not retard the speed of an airplane entering a turn as much as ailerons.<br><br>

REDUCE, REUSE, INSULATE?
John Alexander Roberts
The Academy of Science and Technology, The Woodlands, TX

The purpose of this project was to evaluate the effectiveness of recycled materials in average household insulating situation in an attempt to establish such materials as cheap, environmentally conscious alternatives to traditional insulating materials. The materials tested were polyurethane foam, fiberglass, Styrofoam, paper, cardboard, low-density polyethylene, and polyethylene terephthalate. The hypothesis was that polyurethane foam would perform the best, followed by fiberglass, and then the recycled plastics. The procedure was to apply a heat source to a scale wall with various insulations within its annular space, recording temperature readings on either side of the wall for 15 minutes, and the data was then used to calculate the R-Value for each insulation using the equations Q=mCp∆T and U=Q/(A*h*LMTD) and R=1/U. The results showed that polyurethane performed the best, followed by the recycled plastics. A cost analysis then showed that a switch from fiberglass to polyethylene terephthalate would save 1.4 trillion kWh a year in America’s 112 million residential homes. That’s $140 billion a year. 523 million tons of coal a year saved from being used in coal power plants. 1.5 billion tons of CO2 kept out of the atmosphere. Not to mention more efficiently using 17 million barrels of oil used every year to produce the 29 billion soda bottles produced annually.

WINGS: WHAT A DRAG...
Mark Richard Fleming
Loyola High School, Mankato, Minnesota, USA

I choose to do this project because I have always had an interest in airplanes. I observed that the Humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) is able to execute extreme banking and turning maneuvers. The humpback has large protuberances or tubercles on the leading edge of its flippers. I wanted to learn more about the affect leading edge tubercles would have on the lift, drag, and stall characteristics produced by a wing.<br><br>For my testing, I made a birch wood wing, painted, and polished it to a very smooth finish. I tested the wing in a wind tunnel from -5º to 20º angle of attack and measured the lift and drag. I then modified the wing by adding tubercles to the leading edge and retested several different configurations in the wind tunnel. I also added threads to the top surface of the wing to observe the development of the flow separation as the critical angle was approached for each of the different configurations.<br><br>In conclusion, I found that the wings with the tubercles increased the lift at higher angles of attack, while delaying the stall angle as compared to the wing with the straight leading edge. The drag was increased at intermediate angles of attack with the two modified configurations compared to the wing with the straight leading edge.

IMPROVING LASER EFFICIENCY USING SOLID FLUORESCENT CONVERTERS
Ryan John Clark
Hilton Head Preparatory, Hilton Head Island, SC

The purpose of this experiment was to create a solid fluorescent converter with the intention of improving the efficiency of an optically pumped solid state laser. It was predicted was that the solid fluorescent converters would be made by dissolving Rhodamine 6G in either Dow-Corning 93-500 base, Plexiglas, or PMMA. It was predicted that these converters would improve laser efficiency because previous research demonstrated an improved efficiency with florescent dyes dissolved in liquids, particularly Rhodamine 6G. Furthermore, Rhodamine 6G absorbs between 510 and 545 nm and re-emits between 530 and 590 nm closely matching the absorption band in the Nd:YAG laser (560-590 nm), the laser that will be utilized in this experiment.<br><br> To conduct this experiment, Rhodamine 6G was tested with Dow Corning 93-500 base, Plexiglas, 350,000 Mw and 996,000 Mw PMMA. The Rhodamine 6G was combined with the three substances in the dry powder form and with an ethanol, acetone, methanol, or anisole solution.<br><br> The solid Rhodamine 6G and the Dow Corning 93-500 base combination did not fluoresce at all. The samples with Rhodamine 6G in solution initially fluoresced, but fluorescence diminished to zero as the solvent evaporated. The Plexiglas samples with only Rhodamine 6G and the samples with Rhodamine 6G and ethanol solution fluoresced after all heating was terminated. The 996,000 Mw PMMA samples with the anisole fluoresced the most significantly after curing was terminated. The 350,000 Mw PMMA samples fluoresced but not as intensely as the 996,000 PMMA samples.<br><br> The Dow Corning 93-500 samples did not support the predicted outcome because they did not fluoresce in the solid form. In regard to the Plexiglas and PMMA, the predicted outcome was supported because the Plexiglas samples did fluoresce when all of the liquid (ethanol) had evaporated. The 996,000 Mw PMMA samples fluoresced the most intensely and were relatively clear, the two desired traits for this phase of experimentation. This is of significance because from the previous experimentation, it was inferred that solid Rhodamine 6G could not fluoresce with the absence of a liquid. The next phase includes testing this converter with the Nd:YAG laser.

THE IDEAL DESIGN
Jonathan Matthew Ketterling
Wishek Public High School, Wishek, ND

The purpose of this project was to determine the most efficient tower structure based on strength and weight of the tower. I built different towers, tested how much weight each tower held, and found out which is the most resistant to force.<br><br>I hypothesized that the tower built at a 75 degree angle will be more resistant to force than the tower with right angles. I also believed that the heaviest tower will not be as efficient as a lighter tower based on weight held compared to weight of the tower.<br><br>The results of the six designs of towers are as follows. Each design was tested twice to ensure consistency of results.<br><br>It took 9.5 newtons to tip towers (C,CC,and CCC). It took 4.25 newtons to tip towers (D,DD,and DDD). <br><br>The amounts of wood used to build the towers are as follows: C-714.24cm, CC-824.40cm, CCC-842.40cm, D-704.80cm, DD-827.20cm, and <br><br>DDD-819.84cm.<br><br>I made a ratio of how much weight each tower held divided by how much weight the tower weight. Based on these calculations the most efficient tower was CCC1. Following are the towers listed from best to worst based on my efficiency equation: CCC1, CCC2, DDD2, DDD1, CC2, CC1, C2, C1, D1, D2, DD2, and DD1.<br><br>In conclusion the best towers were CCC1 and CCC2 respectively. They were both 90 degree towers with X cross braces and had the best efficiency.

ENHANCING THE EFFICIENCY OF HYDROELECTRIC POWER GENERATION WHILE MINIMIZING DAMAGING ECOLOGICAL EFFECTS RESULTING FROM DAMMING
Brenton Jeffrey Pimley
Joplin-Inverness High School, Joplin, MT, United States of America

Hydropower creates large amounts of energy, but it has also caused environmental problems that include river blockage from damming and marine death from turbine mishaps. This project set out to create a machine that would collect energy from river flow while minimizing blockage and wildlife problems. A wavemill was constructed by cutting a 16.2 cm long tube with an internal diameter of 5.2 cm. A fin, heated and bent to resemble an elongated screw, was placed in the tube and supported at both ends by plastic stabilizers. One stabilizing end piece, 3 mm thick, included a motor mount that supported a 12-volt direct current motor. Two large gears connected the fin shaft to the generator shaft. Those two gears created a 1.2:1 gear ratio. Two trials of different river flow were created to simulate varying river flows. These simulated flows would represent seasonal changes in a river’s flow. In the first set of testing trials, the wavemill produced an average of 0.133 volts per second, and in the second set of trials it averaged 0.091 volts per second. These results showed that the fin design for this wavemill would produce results, but the average voltage was not great enough to gain legitimate amounts of energy. Introducing more ribs to the fin design could be one way to improve the wavemill's performance.

DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF AN ANALOG-BASED BIPED ROBOT: A STEP INTO THE FUTURE
Zachary Michael Walchuk
Mankato West High School, Mankato, MN, United States

The purpose of this project is to determine if it is possible to use an analog control system to control a biped robot. There are many biped robots being built currently, but most of these robots use computer control. Computer control is expensive, complicated, and requires specific rules to govern all motion. Walking is a periodic and rhythmic motion that a system of oscillators should be able to control. The goal of this project was to create an autonomous biped robot that uses analog technology to achieve an efficient walking pattern.<br><br> After researching many current biped designs, a final design was modeled that allowed for motors at all joints in the robot. A prototype was built using this design, which included 10 motors at 6 joints for a total of 10 degrees of freedom. Gear motors were used because of their high torque, and the motors were centered using springs. Due to problems with motor centering, a new prototype was designed that used a potentiometer within the motor to keep the motors centered electronically. The circuitry that centered the motors could be controlled with a single input line for each motor, simplifying the control system. This prototype was able to keep itself standing under its own power, but the motors used were not strong enough to allow proper walking.<br><br> From the work done so far, it seems as if an analog-based biped robot is possible. The prototypes have demonstrated the ability to perform the functions necessary for walking, such as shifting weight and maintaining balance. When a new prototype can be built with stronger and more exact motors, true walking will most likely be achieved.<br><br>

GRAPHENE: FIRST PRACTICAL PRODUCTION AND APPLICATIONS OF THE SUPERMATERIAL
Philip Vidal Streich
Home School, Platteville, WI

Graphene, a single-atom-thick sheet of carbon, is stronger and conducts electrons faster than any known material. Its remarkable properties offer the potential for revolutionary applications like ultra-fast, small, and efficient nanocomputers, ultra-strong composites, significantly more efficient and inexpensive solar cells, and advanced ultracapacitors for green energy storage. The major obstacle, however, has been the inability to produce and apply uniform sheets of pure graphene on any large scale. This is because graphene sheets naturally stick together to form graphite, which lacks these super properties, and methods to “unstick” graphene have either required chemical modification (thereby severely degrading graphene´s properties) or have been highly labor intensive and impractical for large scale production and application.<br><br> <br><br>This research presents the first method for practically producing graphene from common graphite on a large-scale. A novel inexpensive solution-phase process was discovered which spontaneously produces pure graphene sheets from graphite through thermodynamic dissolution. A method was then discovered to deposit graphene sheets from solution onto various substrates. Graphene samples were analyzed using multiple microscopic, spectroscopic and electrical techniques, and were engineered to produce conductive transparent films. Using graphene films as transparent electrodes, the world’s first graphene solar cell prototypes were constructed. The first ultracapacitor prototype using pure graphene was also built. These findings could lead to the first large-scale production of pure graphene and may be the key to finally realizing the potential of graphene as a supermaterial.

ENCAPSULATION OF SINGLE-WALLED CARBON NANOTUBES IN MICROGELS
Amelia Heyi Lin
Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science, Denton, TX, USA

Although possible applications for carbon nanotubes (CNTs) span numerous fields of science, due to their cytotoxicity (toxicity to cells) they cannot be introduced into the human body, excluding their use from proposed biological applications for them—including biosensors, drug delivery agents, and selective cancer cell destruction— impossible.<br><br> Hence, this research proposes a novel method of encapsulating carbon nanotubes in microgels, a biologically compatible medium, via sidewall functionalization. This is a step towards enabling introduction of single-walled carbon nanotubes into the human body. In N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPA) microgels, polymer strands of N-isopropylacrylamide monomer are linked together by a crosslinking agent, such as methylene-bis-acrylamide (BIS) that terminates in vinyl groups. Functionalized carbon nanotubes replaced BIS as a crosslinking agent, yielding NIPA microgels with carbon nanotubes embedded inside. Sulfuric acid and nitric acid were used to cut carbon nanotubes into short, open-ended segments. Hydrochloric acid was then added to ensure formation of carboxylic acid groups. Reaction with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) and N-(3-Aminopropyl)methacrylamide hydrochloride (NMH) yielded carbon nanotubes functionalized with vinyl groups. Successful encapsulation of the carbon nanotubes in NIPA microgels verified sidewall functionalization.<br><br> The encapsulation of carbon nanotubes in microgels makes carbon nanotubes, which are normally cytotoxic, safe for introduction into the body. Hence, the work presented here opens the way for a broad range of exciting applications including biosensors, artificial muscles, regrowth of broken or severed nerve endings, and targeted cancer treatment.<br><br>

VORTEX GENERATORS IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER
Zachary Marc Schroeder
Miller City High School, Miller City, Ohio, USA

Vortex generators and aerodynamic forces in a wind tunnel were measured to determine the effects on lift. How do the vortex generators of an aerodynamic airfoil increase the lift created by the airfoil? The airflow over the airfoil passing the vortex generators creates small vortices. The typical airflow with the created vortices turn more efficiently than only the standard flow, resulting in a reduction of boundary layer separation and an increase in lift. The experimentation examined two personally designed airfoils one of which had five vortex generators added to the contouring edge. Multiple trials in stable environmental conditions were conducted in a wind tunnel. The airfoils were tested at five different degrees of angle (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20) and at three different wind speeds (3.799 m/s, 4.157 m/s, and 4.558 m/s) to determine lift force. <br><br> Results varied between the angles and the wind speeds. All forces were digitally measured in grams. The resulting forces of the airfoil without vortex generators, for all wind speeds range from 3.7 – 18.2, 11.1 – 33.1, 28.4 – 54.2, 45.2 - 84.7, and 51.5 – 100.6 g at respective degrees. The airfoil with vortex generators had results for respective angles ranging from 9.0 – 23.9, 16.5 – 39.6, 29.0 – 61.6, 39.0 – 82.1, and 47.9 – 100.2. Direct data comparison indicated greater force production with the application of vortex generators. These results validate the hypothesis promoting the use of vortex generators to increase lift. Possible applications for vortex generators include automobile design, competitive racing, and in the air transportation industry.<br><br>

A NOVEL, NON-INVASIVE APPROACH TO DIAGNOSING OBSTRUCTIVE UROPATHY USING CFD AND COMPUTER SIMULATION
Nirmish Singla
Andover High School, Bloomfield Hills, MI, USA

Urinary tract obstruction is a common clinical problem involving constriction anywhere along the ureters or urethra. Current diagnostic methods can be risky or costly, and urologists are seeking new, inexpensive, non-invasive measures to diagnose obstruction. This project combines computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with computer simulation to create, for the first time, an accurate diagnostic tool for obstructive uropathy. Various hypothetical models were initially created in Gambit 2.1.6, in which the physics of flow was evaluated, based on varying geometries and conditions. These models presented short segments of the tract and possible effects of obstruction. Once accuracy was proven in Fluent 6.1.22 by comparing contours of velocity, static pressure, dynamic pressure, total pressure, and wall shear stress to results predicted by flow theory, realistic models of both healthy and obstructed urethras and ureters were created and simulated. Accuracy in the realistic models was proven by comparison to uroflometry data, experimentally obtained. The accuracy of the models indicates implications for potential clinical applications of tract analysis, secondary flow effects, disease prevention, and diagnosis. The hypothetical models may also be used in CFD studies of other physiological systems, such as in the blood vessels of the circulatory system.

BRIDGETENDER: AN AUTONOMOUS SYSTEM TO MONITOR THE STRUCTURAL HEALTH OF BRIDGES
Evan Bock Clark
West High School, Salt Lake City, UT

Today, one of the most pressing infrastructure problems facing the United States is the structural integrity of our bridges. Of the nation's approximately 600,000 bridges, nearly a quarter are listed as “outdated” or “structurally deficient” by the Federal Highway Administration. Repairing each bridge is only a temporary solution. What is needed is an inexpensive system that can automatically and periodically diagnose the health of bridges, and alert the proper authorities when a bridge becomes dangerous.<br><br> This project developed such a system, dubbed BridgeTender, and implemented it on a model bridge. BridgeTender uses the properties of sound waves to diagnose the structural integrity of a bridge by driving high-pitched frequencies into the bridge and monitoring the resultant amplitude and phase pattern at important points along the structure. The health diagnosis is made by comparing the “healthy” waveform pattern (characterized when the bridge is known to be healthy) to the current waveform pattern, and searching for significant changes. BridgeTender is sensitive enough to determine whether the model bridge is “healthy” or “broken” (achieved by unscrewing a nut in the bridge's chassis), and alerts the user via text message if the bridge is determined to be broken.<br><br> This project provides a solution for a real life problem that needs addressing. The implications are both powerful and extensive. An effective, inexpensive bridge health monitoring system could improve the infrastructure of our nation, as well as the safety of its citizens, and could have far-reaching effects all over the world.

A NOVEL APPROACH FOR MATHEMATICALLY MODELING PRETARGETED RADIOIMMUNOTHERAPY AS A TREATMENT FOR COLON CANCER
Ananth Ram
Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science, Denton, TX

In pre-targeted radioimmunotherapy (pRIT), antibodies are engineered for therapeutic purposes (e.g. cyto-drug delivery) as promising treatments for cancer. However, the current mathematical models that measure the interactions of antibodies and antigens in tumor cells do not take into account any damage done to normal tissue. <br><br> The purpose of this project is to analyze the current mathematical model and fix any inaccuracies or redundancies. The second goal was to model the physiology of the colon in order to predict the effects of the treatment for colorectal cancer on normal tissue. The third goal was to model alpha particle radiation to see the effects of the treatment on normal cells. Tests were set up to measure the concentration of antibodies bound to the antigens of spherical tumor models over long periods of time, a one dimensional villi model was developed to measure antibody concentrations in the colon, and changes were made to the beta emission model to include alpha particle analysis.<br><br> The model was validated through comparisons to clinical trials. Times of saturation and clearance from the crypt of antibodies were compared to saturation windows for the tumor. It was found that after antibodies had cleared from the villi, there was still ample time to dose radiation in order to maximize the volume of tumor dosed and minimize the normal tissue damage. The theoretical equations for alpha emission are yet to be validated. Future studies include completing the model for the alpha particle emission and calculating nonspecific toxicity to other body organs.

THE EFFECTS OF CONCRETE COMPOSITION ON BRIDGE FLEXIBILITY
Margaret Wu
Ann Arbor Huron High School, Ann Arbor, MI

The purpose of the experiment was to evaluate the effects of different compositions of the bridge deck on the resulting structure’s flexibility. The experiment was conducted using six unique combinations of cement, sand, water, lightweight aggregate, metakaolin, and two types of fibers called polyvinyl alcohol, PVA-1 and PVA-2. Each of the model decks was created using a mold in which the mixture was then allowed to set for one week to let the cement harden and achieve maximum strength. After each of the models was created, they were placed on supports to simulate the pillars of an actual bridge. Then, the amount of weight on each deck was progressively increased by pouring sand into a container placed in the center of the model. The total weight of the container of sand was then recorded when the model deck broke, which is the load capacity of the deck. The break in the model with a standard cement mix was clean and sudden because the material was very brittle, which is detrimental to bridge safety. The incorporation of lightweight aggregate and metakaolin improved the model deck’s flexibility. But the greatest flexibilities achieved were from the models with PVA fibers. The model decks carried much higher loads and still deformed substantially before their final failure. Furthermore, the model containing PVA-1 performed better than the one containing PVA-2. Thus, not all fibers are equally effective in increasing a bridge’s flexibility.

OPTIMIZING ETHANOL PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY
Jessica Lynn Laviolette
Brandon High School, Ortonville Michigan, USA

The purpose of this experiment is to increase both the rate of ethanol production and the longevity of the ethanol production process. By doing this, the overall efficiency of the process increases and makes ethanol a more viable renewable fuel source. <br><br> To begin experimenting and collecting data, a fermenting chamber was built that could withstand vacuum and high pressure. A membrane column was built into the chamber so that its contents could be evacuated of all atmospheric gases, and have a constant supply of Clintose solution void of atmospheric gases fed to it at a rate regulated by a metering pump. Samples were then taken at set intervals and sent to a private certified laboratory for analysis and verification of contents. The results from the lab have allowed for further analysis of my process. From this data, the rate of ethanol production, the longevity of the process, and the concentration of ethanol could be determined. The focus of this year’s project is to increase the rate of ethanol production and the longevity of the process, while last year, the focus was to increase the concentration of ethanol. After speaking with the lab, it was clear to me that the concentration of ethanol, as long as it is above 9%, makes it a viable process for commercial production—the increase of production rate and the longevity of the process is the culminating effort of this year’s research. <br><br>

THE EFFECT OF RUMBLE STRIP DESIGN ON VEHICLE TRAJECTORY
Renee Schaaf
Central High School, St. Joseph, MO

Rumble strips alongside roads are designed to create noise and vibration to alert drivers leaving the roadway. A better rumble strip design might give drivers extra time to wake up or correct their mistakes, prevent run-off-road incidents, and save lives. I sanded grooves into pieces of wood particle board using a 2.5 inch diameter grinding wheel, as opposed to the 25 inch diameter grinding wheels used in Missouri. I attached this to an electric hand drill housed in a wooden box I designed for it that slides across an adjustable wooden guide. Next, I obtained a remote controlled car with 2.5 inch diameter wheels. All aspects of the experiment were one tenth of Missouri guidelines. I created strips with grooves cut perpendicular to the length of the board (90 degree strips), 80 degree strips, and 70 degree strips with grooves slanting downward to the right, as well as obtaining a control board with no grooves cut into it. Pieces of Styrofoam with texture comparable to that of the wood and thickness equal to that of the wood were attached to either side of the test board. The car was started along a metal guide with either the right or left wheels encountering the rumble strip. A value in centimeters from the centerline at the opposite end of the apparatus was taken based on where a mark on the center of the car ended. All rumble strips created drag on the vehicle, pulling the car into the rumble strip. The car also tended to take the path of least resistance, the line perpendicular to the grooves. Depending on whether this path of least resistance was in the same direction as the drag effect or not, the angled grooves either canceled the torque effect caused by the drag or accentuated it. The 70 degree rumble strip with left wheels encountering the rumble strip nearly negated the effect of the drag, keeping the car on the rumble strip longer. All results were statistically significant.

ON THE AIR
Megan Leigh Burcham

We live in an electronic and imformation age where people use too much energy. I believe that the same tasks can be accomplished using much less energy. I believe wireless applications are a part of the solution. I believe that information can be transferred with much less use of energy, components, and resources. This would be more important as technology increases. <br><br> I recently became interested in radio. Therefore, I decided to do my project related to this interest. After I did my research, I realized how important communication and information exchange is. I also realized that all things dealing with electronics use energy.<br><br> I built a radio using few parts and no electricity. I then tested it. I immediately began to hear and identify distant stations. I also utilized a general coverage HF all mode communications receiver to test signal propagation theories and the advantages and disadvantages of a variety of communications modes.<br><br> I kept a logbook to record some of the stations I received. I measured the distance to some of the stations. I studied wave propagation to understand how radio signals can travel so far. I also did research on some of the stations I received. <br><br> I found this process to be fun and educational. I was able to listen to news and information from great distances without using any power on the receiver I constructed. My general coverage receiver used only 4 AA batteries and a 3' telescopic antenna and could receive even low power stations worldwide. In this case, my hypothesis seemed to be accurate. I hope to explore signal transmisson next.

ON THE HEAT TRANSFER OF 40K HELIUM AS APPLIED TO THE COOLING OF MIRRORS FOR THE FREE-ELECTRON LASER
Daniel Peter Andreano
Poquoson High School, Poquoson, VA, USA

A method was designed and created to determine the necessary flow of Helium required to cool the sapphire mirrors in the optical cavity of the free-electron laser using an assumed acceptable wall temperature, mirror size, and laser power. Prior to experimentation, research was performed to determine the relationships required for the experiment and in order to learn the operations of the free electron laser. A helium flow rate was determined for a 10kW laser with an initial 2 inch mirror with an assumed wall temperature of 41.37K using a finite element analysis and Microsoft Excel. After finding the required helium coolant flow rate required, additional modeling was completed to determine the coolant flow for larger mirrors and to determine isotherms along the mirror. <br><br>The efficiency of such free electron lasers will increase as such modeling and study in done on them and free-electron lasers have potential applications across fields such as industry, defense, and communications.<br><br>

ENZYMATIC ELECTRODES FOR BIOFUEL CELLS
Daniel Clayton Appel
Eldorado High School, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA

Fuel cells convert chemical energy into electrical energy. Biofuel cells use biomolecules such as enzyme catalysts and glucose. The advantages of enzymatic biofuel cells over precious metal catalyzed cells include high specificity, ambient environments, scalability, and ready availability of fuels, such as glucose and ethanol. These are being developed for micro/nano-scale power generation applications in bioelectronics, oligonucleotide and immunological biosensing, MEMS devices, and power patches/textiles. Redox enzymes generally lack direct electrical transfer capability since enzymatic active sites are generally buried inside globular protein complexes. Current research addresses enzyme immobilization techniques and establishing electrical communication by physical adsorption and direct wiring via self-assembling monolayers (SAMs). Experimentation involved development and optimization of laccase triphase gas diffusion cathodes (GDEs) using carbon black and nanotube composites using design of experiment methodology (experimental plan that simultaneously evaluates multiple variables) to optimize power generation and efficiency in pH and saline environments (pH 5-7 and NaCl up to 1.0M). Potentiostatic/galvanometric testing was used to determine power output and voltage, and cyclic voltammetry to evaluate surface electrochemistry. Increased salinity and higher pH negatively affected voltage and power density. A direct-wired, 4-aminothiophenol SAM with covalently immobilized laccase performed nominally at lower pH, but had poor tolerance of salt and acidic environments. Multi-walled carbon nanotube GDEs produced 214uW power (higher than current published values), however, buffer leakage prevented complete testing of the most recent biofuel cell prototype. Future work includes refinement of DOEx derived models (mathematical prediction equations), use of single-walled nanotubes, and further miniaturization of biofuel cell designs.

AN INNOVATIVE FLAT SEQUENTIAL COLOR VIDEO DISPLAY
Enhao Li
Plano West Senior High School, Plano, TX, USA

An innovative full color video display is made by sequentially showing red, green, and blue images. They are mixed in our brains and form a full color image. This display is eye-friendly because each field image is static like movie rather than the constantly changing CRT and LCD. This new display is as twice as energy efficient, three times higher resolution and 20% cheaper than traditional LCDs due to no color filter. It also has a flat RGB light source that turns on time sequentially. In order to show a static image of each field, the data of every pixel has been loaded one-line-at-a-time of row-by-row, as in traditional LCDs, but cannot be seen. Then, all the data in every pixel of entire display will be shown simultaneously and synchronously making a one-field-at-a-time display. In order to implement the one-field-at-a-time display, there are at least two TFTs and two capacitors on each pixel. The data will be loaded to the first capacitor controlled by first TFT. Once all pixels are loaded, the second TFTs are turned on by a single controlling signal to show the designated red, green, or blue image with the corresponding uniform red, green or blue light.<br><br>The one-field-at-a-time driving method was proven by a simulation. The TFT and capacitor on pixel circuit are substituted by an analog switch and a capacitor using same schematic diagram. The simulation does not only prove the design, but also optimizes the circuitry of pixel.<br><br>

AUTONOMOUS METAL DETECTION: ROBOTIC IDENTIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION OF METALS
Amanda Sarah Hersh
Yeshivah of Flatbush Joel Braverman High School, Brooklyn, New York, USA

Troops stationed overseas are in constant danger from deadly bombings and attacks. A novel approach to weapon detection has the potential to save many lives. The purpose of this project was to design, build, program, and test a cost-efficient, autonomous robot with the ability to detect land mines, roadside bombs, and grenades. This robot was programmed to identify and classify various metallic objects. The robot’s hardware consisted of two Plexiglas platforms attached by dowels and supported by three wheels. A Board of Education, consisting of a Basic Stamp II microcontroller, was positioned on the top platform and contained the circuitry. This circuit board was wired and programmed, using the PBASIC language, to use infrared and inductive sensors to detect metallic objects. A conductivity sensor was placed on the top platform to determine the metallic composition of each object and classify it by electrical conductivity. The robot relayed this information to the operator by emitting a preprogrammed sound specific to that metal through a piezo speaker and displaying the specific metal’s name on a Serial LCD screen. In multiple trial runs using aluminum, copper, iron and wood blocks, the robot successfully maneuvered and searched for these test objects using its infrared sensors. The robot determined if the detected object was metallic in nature using its inductive sensor. It then successfully ascertained the identity of the detected metal using its conductivity sensor to determine electrical conductivity, a distinguishing feature of metals.<br><br><br>

CAN THE FORMULA FOR AERODYNAMIC DRAG BE VERIFIED IN MINIATURE?
Andrew Ryan Mizener, Lehman Catholic High School
223 Bon Air Drive, Sidney OH 45365, USA

Drag is one of four fundamental forces of aerodynamics, and the single most important in terms of its affect on an automobile. This experiment attempted to prove that the formula for aerodynamic drag, FD=CD½(roh)V^2A, can be verified in miniature, using 1:24 scale model cars.<br><br> To accomplish this, I built a wind tunnel. I measured drag indirectly by determining the backwards (drag) force exerted on cars which were attached to a platform, itself hovering on a cushion of air to negate friction. A string was attached to the platform; it ran out the front of the wind tunnel and down over a pulley; on the end was a weight resting on a scale.<br><br> When the wind was turned on, it exerted a drag force on the car. As the car (and thus the plate) was pushed back, the force the weight exerted on the scale lessened by an amount equal to the drag force. The drag force divided by the measured frontal area of the car equals the product of the drag coefficient (CD) and the dynamic pressure (½(roh)V^2, or q). The ratio of CD and q for two cars should equal the ratio of the drag coefficients of the same two cars, because the dynamic pressures, which should be equal, cancel out.<br><br> The project proved that it was possible to build a wind tunnel to measure the force of drag on a car, but that it was not possible to verify the equation for aerodynamic drag in my wind tunnel.

REDEEM YOUR STEAM
Adam James Leiferman
Kimball School, Kimball, SD, USA

I built a heat energy recovery device that operates in the exhaust system of a 16 horsepower gasoline engine. This device uses a heat absorber to cool the exhaust, which causes the steam present in the exhaust to condense into water and decrease in volume. The volume change produces a vacuum of approximately 25 in. Hg, which pulls the piston up during the exhaust stroke. At the bottom of the heat absorber, a pump removes the carbon dioxide and liquid water from the vacuum. The carbon dioxide is then removed from the water in a device called a separator. The separated water is pulled through a cooler and brought to ambient temperature. After being cooled, the water is decompressed and pulled through the cooling side of the heat absorber. This water cools the exhaust until it boils. When the cooling water turns into steam, it is pulled in with the exhaust to be cooled and condensed again. <br><br>To test my device, I built a dynamometer that allowed me to measure the torque and horsepower of the original engine and my modified engine. I also used the dynamometer to operate the engine at a range of horsepowers, so the fuel usage could be measured. The amount of fuel used with my device installed was about 14 percent less than the amount of fuel used by the original engine. The horsepower of the engine with my device installed was about 13 percent more than the horsepower without the device.<br><br>

A NEW APPROACH TO BIOFILM INHIBITION: INCORPORATION AND CONTROLLED RELEASE OF SYNTHETIC N-ACYLATED HOMOSERINE LACTONE COMPOUNDS FROM SURFACES
Suvai Gunasekaran
James Madison Memorial High School, Madison, WI

Biofilms consist of populations of bacteria that work together to colonize and adhere to a variety of surfaces. Bacteria thrive within biofilms because they surround themselves in an extracellular layer of natural polymer that protects the bacteria against antibiotics. In many cases biofilm formation is undesirable, and new ways to prevent its growth are of great interest. When biofilms form on biomedical devices implanted in the human body, serious bacterial infections can result and may even be fatal. Most bacteria use a communication method called quorum-sensing to proliferate and form biofilms by sending N-Acylated Homoserine Lactone (AHL) signals to other bacteria in the immediate vicinity. Synthetic AHL compounds that can block the binding sites of naturally occurring AHL can potentially prevent biofilm growth by interrupting quorum-sensing signals. <br><br>I first studied methods to incorporate and coat synthetic AHL compounds onto surfaces using biocompatible polymers. I then investigated the release of these compounds as a function of AHL type, polymer employed, number of AHL layers deposited, solution concentration, and coating procedure. The results demonstrate that synthetic AHL compounds can be incorporated onto surfaces for controlled release. The amount of compound released is dependent on the AHL type, and it increases with the loading concentration and number of layers deposited. The rate of AHL release can be controlled by varying the composition of the carrier polymer matrix. This research will help pave ways to inhibit biofilm growth that might eventually prevent complications from bacterial infections resulting from biofilms growing on implanted biomedical devices.

THE WORLD IS CUBE
BIlly Gene Hudson
Greenwood Senior High School, Greenwood, MS

The cube is used in building blocks for toys and is used for making houses and giant buildings. The question that I want to know is why the cube is used so much in life. To answer this question I built three different cubes and made each cube stronger that the first. I then placed the cubes under five to twenty pounds of weight for exactly three minutes. I would check the cubes after the test to see if the shape or support changed. After each test I recorded all my data and charted my graphs.<br><br> The results from each test coincided with my hypothesis that the stronger the cube design the more weight it will sustain and hold in a given time period. It was also noted that in my last test the angle of my cubes weren't as strong as its flat surface. From this I concluded that to truly make a stronger cube you have to justly reinforce the angles so that they can add more support to the entire surface area of the cube.

PYCNOMETRY: AN APPLICATION OF THE IDEAL GAS LAW
Ethan Lee Williams
Saint Michael's Academy, Bryan Texas, United States of America

The purpose for this project is to find whether the Ideal gas Law can be applied to accurately measure the volume of objects. The hypothesis is that accurate volume measurements can indeed be obtained through application of the Ideal Gas Law.<br><br> A pycnometer was built to test the hypothesis. A pycnometer is a system of airtight chambers and valves, which is used to measure the volumes of samples through application of the Ideal Gas Law. A program in Basic was written to automate the pycnometer, decreasing experimentation time while increasing accuracy and precision.<br><br> After completion of the apparatus construction, tests were run with steel ball bearings of known volume. This was done to find the exact volumes of the test chambers. Then, several tests were run with aluminum and rock salt samples to find their volumes. Their masses were also measured and density valuses for the samples were calculated.<br><br> The data acquired from the tests was both precise and accurate. The density values obtained through operation of the experimental apparatus were 99% accurate to values listed in books for the same substances. In conclusion, the data supports the hypothesis, and the project was a success.

HARNESSING ELECTRICAL ENERGY FROM THE KINETIC ENERGY OF SURFACE WATER FLOW
Brenton Jeffrey Pimley
Joplin-Inverness High School, Joplin Montana, United States of America

Most people never realize the potential of hydropower. When energy is created with little cost, and without wasting the Earth’s natural resources, humanity must harness that power. The star shaped wavemill was created for the purpose of energy collection through river waves. As the waves pass under the wavemill, the wooden mill turns. As the mill turns, a 54 mm diameter spur gear turned along with it, while spinning a 24 mm pinion gear. The pinion gear was attached to a 50 turn motor, relying on the tension of the pieces together to keep the apparatus from falling off. As the motor created energy, a Computer Based Lab probe monitored the voltage output. Three tests were taken, while incorporating three trials into each test. Each test was at a different location from headwaters. The first test was set at 2 cm away. The second test was 10 cm away, and the third test was 20 cm. An average voltage for each test included: .303 volts for the first, .175 volts for the second, and .132 volts for the third test. Photogates were used to calculate the velocity of the simulated river. As the gates were positioned nearer to the headwaters, the velocity increased. While using ratios, a voltage for a real life wavemill was calculated at 78.11 volts/second. While rivers naturally have different speeds, the construction of the wavemill must be carefully thought out so as to get the optimal amount of energy out of the river’s flow.

DEVELOPMENT OF A PLANAR PERFUSED TUMOR BIOREACTOR
Lucas Hudson Hofmeister
Martin Luther King Magnet, Nashville Tennessee, USA

Cancer is the result of complex interactions of a tumor cell with its microenvironment. New micro fluidic devices open the door to in vitro cancer research by more closely mimicking the in vivo microenvironment than current technology. Tumor cells in vivo interact constantly with the immune and vascular system of the host, and an in vitro system should simulate this environment. We have designed a micro fluidic, planar perfused tumor bioreactor using poly(dimethylsiloxane) for the assay of leukocyte transendothelial migration under physiological conditions. Reproduction of these physiological conditions requires shear stress on the apical side of the cells, as well as diffusion across the endothelial membrane. Endothelial cells will be cultured along channels in the bioreactor. To allow for diffusion, the basolateral side of the cells will be on a nanoporous membrane. Electroosmotic pumping through nanoporous alumina membranes was designated as an ideal method for controlling shear flow and allowing adequate diffusion. Biocompatibility of materials was tested. Immortalized lung microvascular endothelial cell (IL-MEC) growth rates were comparable when cells were cultured on poly(dimethylsiloxane) or standard treated polycarbonate (i.e. tissue culture plates). Likewise, cell attachment and spreading was similar on alumina and polycarbonate filters. From these works we can conclude that it will be possible to fabricate and apply the engineered planar perfused tumor bioreactor. The planar perfused bioreactor will be an effective tool for the in vitro study of leukocyte transendothelial migration.

FLOAT YOUR COAT: THE USE OF NEOPRENE AND CLOSED-CELL FOAM TO CREATE A BUOYANT WETSUIT
Katrina Jane Stine
Hilton Head Preparatory School, Hilton Head Island, SC

The purpose of this experiment is to design a buoyant wetsuit. Different materials were tested for their buoyancy, with the most buoyant being selected for the creation of the wetsuit. This material was cut into different sized panels and shaped according to muscular movement. These samples were then placed in the most practical areas on the inside of the wetsuit to allow maximum movement and buoyancy for uninterrupted breathing. It was predicted that closed-cell foam would support the largest amount of weight because it is commonly used in personal flotation devices; next would be a sealed air pocket, diced closed-cell foam followed by the control: Neoprene (wetsuit material). The overall results of the buoyancy testing proved to be successful in that all samples were able to support weight. The closed-cell foam and sealed air pocket both supported average weights of .1382N. Neoprene supported an average weight of .0696N followed by the diced closed-cell foam which supported a weight of .0353N. All sample weights ranged from 3.35g to 3.55g ensuring a design of a light weight wetsuit. The final design performed well; one was able to swim and paddle easily with the foam inserts. More importantly, one would slowly float to the surface head first, a very positive and essential result especially for surfers who, if unconscious or dazed, could surface and breathe. This buoyant wetsuit design will prove to be a low cost, efficient means of lowering drowning rates globally.

HELICAL ANTENNAS: FROM DESIGN TO IMPLEMENTATION. CAN WE ACHIEVE THE THEORETICAL PERFORMANCE?
Thomas Sidney Stock
Stockbrite Homeschool, Smithfield, UT, USA

Helical Antennas are ideal for long distance communication such as space communications, because of their small size and circular polarization. To make a helical antenna work, the circular wire structure must be supported by some material. This project demonstrates how the dielectric constant of the support material affects the antenna performance.<br><br> Antennas were constructed with Air, Wood, PVC, and Styrofoam cores. The antennas were built to radiate in axial mode. Theoretical models of the antennas were programmed using SuperNEC; a program based on the Numeric Electromagnetic Code. The radiation pattern was found by measuring the signal strength broadcasting to and receiving from a reference antenna. The absolute gain was calculated by comparing the gain of the test antennas to the gain of standard reference antennas. <br><br> Comparing the results to the theoretical models, the actual antenna gain was lower. Thus identifying some of the factors that keep real antennas from reaching theoretical performance. The models did reflect the shape of the radiation patterns for all the antennas except the PVC. It was determined that the PVC dielectric constant was wrong according to the data sheet obtained. This showed the importance of finding an accurate source for the dielectric constant.<br><br> This research can aid in the development of new antenna designs and will help engineers to build more efficient antennas in the future. This project demonstrated the importance of the dielectric constant of the support material in getting antennas from the drawing board into real life.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF POLYMERS ON MODIFIED ASPHALT SEALANTS
Amy Elizabeth Guymon
Bonneville High School, Ogden, UT, USA

Highways and freeways are aging and funds are scarce to improve them. Repair instead of reconstruction, is the most appealing alternative. In designing materials to accomplish repairs, a basic knowlege of thermoplastic polymers and their effects on asphalt cement is essential. <br><br>Two types of polymers commonly used in asphalt sealants were obtained for testing. The first was [styrene-butadiene-styrene] (SBS or 411), and the second was [styrene-butadiene-rubber] (SBR or 1205). The source company for the polymers was Dynasol in Houston, Texas. The asphalt cement came from the Cenex refinery in Laurel, Montana. <br><br>Test methods were chosen based on federal and state specifications. Testing procedures came from the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). All testing was done by the student and supervised by Michael Guymon, a chemist and materials engineer. The testing facility, equipment, and materials were provided by Maxwell Products Inc. <br><br>The purpose of experimentation was to see how the polymer would affect the asphalt cement. The tests performed include: tensile adhesion, ductility, penetration, resilience, and flow. Test results determined definitive points where the consentration of polymer was optimal. During testing, parallels were drawn between results and actual application situations. Test results showed that the 411 gave the material internal strength and cohesive properties. The 1205 contributed to the adhesive properties, but did not contribute in any significant way to internal strength or cohesion. A protocol for future evaluation of additional polymers was determined.

SYNTHESIS AND ELECTROCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATIONS OF GRAPHENE SUPPORTED PT NANOPARTICLES FOR FUEL CELL APPLICATIONS
Zhou Li
Greenwood Laboratory School, Springfield, MO

Direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFC) may become the major devices that generate electricity by chemical reactions in the future, because ethanol is one of the most desirable reactants that are easy to produce, are renewable, and relatively easy to transport. Moreover, comparing with other reactants, ethanol is non-toxic and possesses a higher energy density. Since the major barrier to the commercial use of DEFCs is the inefficiency of ethanol electro-oxidation, it is of great importance to develop anode catalysts that can improve the activity of the reaction. Recently, graphene, a novel one-atom layer material, has been extensively investigated for a wide range of applications due to its unique physical and chemical properties. Its unique electrical property and high surface-volume ratio could enhance the transport efficiency of charges in the DEFCs. Therefore, this study particularly concentrated on graphene as a catalyst support for the ethanol oxidation reaction in DEFCs. Both graphene and graphite supported platinum and platinum-ruthenium were synthesized by the ethylene glycol reduction method. Electrochemical characterizations, such as cyclic voltammetry and reaction stability, showed that graphene-platinum nanocomposites could have promising applications as catalysts for DEFCs.

ENHANCED STABILITY EFFECTS OF MICRO-FOILS ON SUPERCAVITATING TORPEDOES
Robert Francis Minehart, III
Dominion High School, 21326 Augusta Drive, Sterling, VA, USA

This is a third year project, the first year demonstrated that drag could be reduced by Supercavitation. The second year proved that a shock wave could force envelope closure. This year's research explored the stability enhancing effects that micro-foils have on the lateral stability of rocket torpedoes. <br><br> A bullet was mounted on a brass tube that served as a structural support, a path for gas delivery and means to measure torque. The tube was supported by a journal bearing that was lubricated by water. Carbon dioxide gas was injected through the support tube via a flexible plastic tube to form the supercavitating envelope. The plastic tube also served as the angular spring that was calibrated to establish a spring constant that translated angular displacement into torque. Last year's test chamber was used to induce a shock that forced envelope closure. Two projectiles were considered: one with and another without micro-foils. <br><br> The angular rotation was measured using a simple laser-pointer and mirror configuration. The displacement of the reflected beam was measured 10 times and averaged (for each projectile). The data suggests that lateral stability can be enhanced by a factor of 5.8. Or, a torpedo, without micro-foils, must apply 5.8 times the corrective torque to maintain course. <br><br> The hypothesis that a micro-foil may be designed to enhance the lateral stability of a rocket torpedo was supported by the data. Micro-foils do enhance the lateral stability of a rocket torpedo. This finding also has broader application to the field of fluid mechanics. <br><br>

ROOFING: FIREFIGHTERS' FRIENDS OR FOES?
Collette Ann Marchesseault
Seton School, Manassas, VA

The hypothesis of this experiment was: When a fire is ignited in the interior of a structure, an asphalt fiberglass shingle roof will allow the structure to remain standing longer than an imitation slate roof, fire-treated cedar shake roof, or untreated cedar shake roof. The independent variable was the roofing material; the dependent variable was the time before structure collapse. The purpose of this experiment was to determine which roofing material will allow a burning structure to remain standing the longest. <br><br> Four structures were constructed and roofing material attached. The structure with asphalt fiberglass shingles was considered the control, since it is the most common roofing material in America today. Variations in atmospheric conditions, including temperature, humidity and wind, were minimal because the structures’ combustion was completed within 90 minutes. The method of ignition remained constant. Six cotton balls with 20ml of lighter fluid were ignited in the interior of each structure. The temperatures of the roof and front of each structure were measured using a Ryobi non-contact infrared thermometer.<br><br> The structure with untreated cedar shakes collapsed the fastest (12 minutes, 55 seconds). The fire-treated cedar shake roof collapsed next (15 minutes, 25 seconds). No substantial difference was seen between the structures with imitation slate and asphalt fiberglass roofs (approximately 15 minutes, 48 seconds). In conclusion, the asphalt fiberglass roof and imitation slate roof allowed their structures to remain standing the longest. The results of this experiment can be used by firefighters judging how long a burning structure is safe.

INVESTIGATING THE MOST EFFICIENT COMBINATION OF NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC INSULATION PHASE 2
Bryan Lee Steinkopf
Roy High School, Roy, UT, USA

This project is an investigation of the most efficient combination of natural and synthetic insulation materials. 800 fill power Goose Down and Hollofil 2 were tested in a 40 degree Fahrenheit environment when wet and dry.<br><br>To begin the experiment, we gathered pint jars to hold warm water, and lids with a puncture hole made to fit the bottom of the digital thermometer. We then constructed identical sleeping bags with the different combinations of 800 fill power Down and Hollofil 2. The pint jars were filled with 98.6 degree Fahrenheit water (to simulate the temperature of the human body). The jars were placed inside the 40 degree Fahrenheit environment (Refrigerator) in the same spot. The jars were left inside the refrigerator for 10 minutes each and the temperature was recorded. Each insulation was tested three times for 10 minutes and three times for 60 minutes.<br><br>This process was repeated while the insulation was wet: the insulation was sprayed evenly with two oz. of 70 degree Fahrenheit water. The procedure was then followed in the same manner as the dry tests. Each wet insulation was tested three times for 10 minutes and three times for 60 minutes. When all the tests were complete, the results were analyzed and compared.<br><br>The contributions of this project are an analysis of natural and synthetic insulation attributes, and an exploration of ways to combine them to create a more efficient insulation for outdoor use in both wet and dry conditions.

CONSTRUCTION OF A MAGNETIC LINEAR ACCELERATOR
Andrew Scott Meyers
Hamilton Junior High School, Parkersburg, WV, USA

The purpose of this project was to determine how the spacing and number of magnets on a magnetic linear accelerator would affect the velocity of the projectile. <br><br> I constructed the magnetic linear accelerator from wooden rulers, 12 mm gold-plated neodymium-iron-boron magnets, and 5/8-inch nickel-plated steel balls. The magnets were securely taped to the ruler and two steel balls were placed to the right of each magnet in the groove of the ruler. A single steel ball was placed 2.0 inches to the left of the leftmost magnet. Magnetic force and the transfer of kinetic energy caused a chain reaction that resulted in the launching of the rightmost ball in the series into a ballistic pendulum, a device I made using a small cardboard box suspended with lightweight nylon strings. The vertical distance the pendulum moved was measured and used to calculate the velocity of each steel ball projectile. Projectile velocity was determined in separate trials using four to nine magnets spaced 2.5 and 3.0 inches apart. <br><br> Maximum velocity achieved was 467 cm/s (about 10.4 mi/hr) using nine magnets spaced 2.5 inches apart. The measurements and calculations confirmed my hypothesis that the velocity of the projectile will increase as the space between the magnets is decreased and as the number of magnets is increased.<br><br>

BIODIESEL ON THE FARM, III
William Arthur Wright
Belgrade High School, Belgrade, MT

The goal of this year's project was to see if adding a simple component to a continuous flow processor (built last year) would eliminate problems in the commencement and termination of production. Accordingly I designed and built that very component. It included pre-filling the mixing line with a substance so that when production started it would act as if it had already been running. I then tested it by running the apparatus, starting and stopping it, and then recording yield and labor intensiveness. To put the results I found to the test, I compared them to that of the processor without the new component (last year), a batch process (2 years ago) and petroleum diesel. I found that the new component raises the yield but it also increases labor of the continuous flow processor. Therefore it is useful. It has a lower yield than the batch process but requires much less labor; it is preferred over the batch process. How does this compare to Petroleum Diesel? The cost of Diesel is still lower than the cost for a farmer to produce biodiesel. So at the current time Petroleum diesel is still the more practical choice for the farmer. However this is changing, as oil prices are rising rapidly, biodiesel will soon become cost worthy for the farmer.

H2 FUEL FOR FUEL CELLS FROM RECYCLED ALUMINUM CANS
Brooks W. Willig
Cornerstone Christian School, San Angelo, TX, USA

This project was conducted to test if hydrogen production to fuel a fuel cell was possible by combining aluminum, sodium hydroxide and water in a pressure container. The aluminum reacts with the sodium hydroxide and releases hydrogen and forms sodium aluminate as a residual. The process can be stated in this equation: 2Al+2NaOH+6H2O¨2Na[Al(OH)4]+3H2. An apparatus consisting of a reaction jar and a separation jar that was connected to a Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell was constructed to test the theory. A digital pressure gauge and thermocouple was connected to the reaction jar, and a Magnehelic monometer was connected to the fuel cell. A volt meter and amp meter were also connected to the fuel cell along with a variable load. The separator jar was installed to try to prevent moisture carryover to the fuel cell. Tests were conducted using Drano and flaked lye as a source of sodium hydroxide and recycled aluminum cans as the aluminum source. The materials were placed in the reaction jar, and the reaction was observed and the data was recorded from the instrumentation. Residuals from the reactions were emptied into settling pans and observed. The reaction produced useable quantities of hydrogen to fuel the fuel cell. Economic calculations were also made to examine the cost and quantity of hydrogen produced. While this system worked, a more sophisticated pressure vessel is needed for bulk production. <br><br>

Amanda Gayle Kimbel
St. Charles West High School, St. Charles Missouri, USA

The purpose of this project was to ascertain how to build a successful trebuchet that will throw for maximum projectile range. Two different trebuchets, Standard and Floating Arm, were compared and a model Floating Arm Trebuchet was built. The comparison was performed after equations were derived, and the Matlab(Registered Trademark) program showed which trebuchet had the longest range. A Floating Arm Trebuchet with the same lengths as the optimized Matlab(Registered Trademark) trebuchet was built to show how a real world trebuchet would perform.

PHASE 5: INVESTIGATING THE POSSIBILITIES OF UTILIZING NASA'S TITAN 111C FOR FUTURE MANNED SPACE EXPLORATION
Derik Thomas Bowen
Longshore Homeschool Billings, MT USA

The nature of my project of experimenting with NASA's extinct "Dyna-Soar X-20" space maneuvering vehicle was to modify the proto type for future manned space travel. <br><br> For my project, I built 6 proto types with varying fuselage lengths, and wind tunneled each one. Model 4 was the most balanced in lift and drag. I further tested Model 4 by boosting it on top of a scale model Titan IIIc to test it for high speed boosted stability of the craft. The model flew exceptionally well, but needed a few adjustments. I then moved to a larger scale, a 1/18th scale X-20 and tested it being launched from a catapult. Following the catapult test, I launched this model by hand in high winds. The model flew straight, but pitched up when it created too much lift in the wind, although it was very stable in roll and yaw. <br><br> I took my project one step further and built an additional 1/18th scale X-20. This model was control lined and had an engine. I tested this model and found it was extremely stable in all axis's. <br><br> At the conclusion of my project, my hypothesis was wrong, however, I believe the X-20 could be modified by extending the fuselage to make it aerodynamically sound for manned space travel as a possible replacement for the Space Shuttle.

COMPARISON OF SOLAR POWER SYSTEM COST TO UTILITY POWER COST FOR HOME USE
Adam Matthew Fuhrmann
Heritage High School, Leesburg, VA, USA

The purpose of this project was to determine if the cleaner and more independent solar cell system is more cost efficient than utility power in Leesburg, Virginia.<br><br> This problem was tested by measuring voltage production in Leesburg from 7am- 7pm for a period of 15 days. Then the required size of the system was calculated. The monthly payments of a system of that size were compared to the monthly payments of a utility power bill. Interest rate, inflation, and varying cost of utility power were taken into account. It was also taken into account that data was only collected in January which has the least amount of light. Year round data was used to make the results more accurate.<br><br> The results show that the required system size would take 20-25 years with 0% interest rate, 3% inflation, and 8 cents/kwh utility power. The useful life of the system is about 20-25 years so by the time the solar system is paid of it would need to be replaced.<br><br> The conclusions are that the solar power system costs the same as utility power making the hypothesis incorrect. The only way the solar system would be cheaper was if the installation cost was less.<br><br> A way to further the results of this experiment is to look into the fact that the solar system can make money by selling extra power produced back to utility power. Another way would be to collect data in different parts of the town on different roof slopes and see the difference.<br><br>

A CLEAR CHOICE: A POLYCARBONATE-POLYHEDRAL OLIGOMERIC SILSESQUIOXANE NANOCOMPOSITE
Blake Allen Campbell
Stevens High School, Rapid City, South Dakota, USA

Glass windshields can break into sharp shards capable of causing injury or death when involved in an accident. A windshield made of polycarbonate provides an alternative, but does not possess suitable rigidity and will flap in the wind at high speeds. The goal of this second year project was to create a polycarbonate nanocomposite possessing the equivalent transparency of polycarbonate, but having increased rigidity suitable for replacing vehicular windows.<br><br>Trisilanophenyl-POSS was selected as a nanofiller potentially capable of retaining the transparency of polycarbonate. Variables studied included percent POSS (2.5, 5.0, 10.0 and 20.0%) and mixing temperature (200 °C, 210 °C, 220 °C). Controls were established by heating and mixing pure polycarbonate at the selected temperatures. <br><br>Visible spectrometry confirmed the nanocomposites had a transparency equivalent to polycarbonate. Transparency was independent of both percent POSS composition and mixing temperature. UV spectrometry indicated the nanocomposites have an equal or greater UV absorption than pure polycarbonate: a potential advantage. <br><br>There was a significant increase (P Value = 0.034) in rigidity of all polycarbonate-POSS nanocomposites compared to all pure polycarbonate controls. The rigidity of 2.5% POSS nanocomposites (P Value = 0.049) and 5.0% POSS nanocomposites (P Value = 0.036) versus all pure polycarbonate controls were significantly higher. The P value approaches significance (P value = 0.081) when comparing the rigidity of 10% POSS versus the controls. Five percent POSS and 210°C tested as the optimum percent composition and mixing temperature. <br><br>It appears feasible to replace glass in vehicular windows, among other possible applications, with a polycarbonate-trisilanophenyl-POSS nanocomposite.

AIRFOILS-THEY'RE ONLY NATURAL!
Kristin MacKenzie Hope
St. Joseph Catholic High School, Ogden Utah, United States of America

The purpose of this project was to see if basic fluid dynamic shapes found in nature, such as a seagull wing, a shark dorsal fin, a whale tail fluke, and stingray pectoral fins, could be directly applied to airplanes, enhancing the efficiency of the aircraft, by increasing lift and decreasing drag. I hypothesized that since these shapes are naturally fluid dynamic that there would be an increase in lift and decrease in drag. <br><br>This is a continuation project. Last year these shapes were tested on a Cessna 172 in the computer simulator X-plane. From the observations I made in X-plane I realized that these shapes may be more efficient on different types of aircrafts, such as fighter jets or gliders. To test this I decided to build the different shapes out of balsa wood and fiberglass and test the overall aerodynamics of each individual shape in a wind tunnel. This would allow me to observe and test each individual shape’s lift to drag ratio as well as its stalling angle. <br><br>I built a wind tunnel in my basement, using a 40 knot fan, cardboard, duct type, drop scales (one positioned vertically measuring lift and one horizontally measuring drag), and a device to change the angle of attack on each shape.<br><br>From my research and observations I found that overall there was a decrease in drag and an increase in lift. This proves that these shapes compared to the control wing (a wing on RC plane) are more efficient airfoils. <br><br>

AN EAR TO THE TRACK AN ULTRASONIC TRAIN WRECK AVOIDANCE SYSTEM
Courtney Anne Rafes
Northwest High School, Justin, Texas, USA

Everyday millions of people and billions of dollars worth of materials travel on the world’s railways. The safety and security of these railways are critical to the lives and economy of the world and homeland security. Since the first railroad was constructed, people have known that by putting “an ear to the track”, they could detect an approaching train. In a similar way, this project utilizes the science of sound to determine the presence of two trains or subway trains on a collision course, thus preventing accidents. This project also utilizes sound to determine if railway tracks have become disconnected, thus helping to prevent train derailments due to broken tracks. <br><br>By performing eight experiments and over 2350 tests, it was found that certain sonic and ultrasonic frequencies traveled far distances on train tracks and that the ultrasonic frequency utilized traveled significantly further than the sonic frequency. The experiments also showed that measurable ultrasonic sound can be sent from a moving train through the train track to a receiver placed on an on-coming train. When using a variable electronic sound filter, external sounds such as those from the train can be eliminated so that only the designated ultrasonic sound is detectable. <br><br>By placing sending and receiving transducers on trains, train engineers and subway train drivers can determine if their train is on a collision course with or too close to another train. Also, by attaching sender and receiver transducers in alternating configuration on train tracks, broken tracks can be detected. <br><br> <br><br>

THE DEVELOPMENT OF AUTONOMOUS SELF CONFIGURING MULTI-CELL BASED ROBOTS
Jessica Lauren Malone
Berea High, Berea Ohio, USA

This project investigates the development of Self Configuring Multi-Cell Based Robots that function as independent entities or collectively to carry out tasks. The robotic cells are modeled after the concept of biological cells. Each cell is identical and engineered to assess its environment, detect other cells, and communicate with other cells and monitoring systems. Each cell has the ability to move independently or in a configured group comprised of multiple connected cells. The various configurations are determined by assigned tasks. The cells can be deployed in unlimited numbers for military, space exploration, medical and hazardous duty applications. <br><br><br> Infrared scanning technology and electronic compasses allows cells to asses their surroundings and map the position of neighboring cells and obstacles. Information gathered by each cell is broadcast and fed into algorithms to establish the relative location of other cells and obstacles. These algorithms are programmed into each cell eliminating the need for “master” cells. Gyroscopic precession is used to maintain the proper orientation for each cell. Accelerometers are used to measure orientation and to feed PID control loops to maintain desired orientation. Cells can physically connect forming larger entities for various task executions. <br><br><br> Each cell is in the shape of a dodecahedron which provides an optimal number of surfaces for physical connectivity. Embedded microcontrollers control all functions of the robot as well as environment mapping. <br><br><br> This project successfully demonstrates the development of Autonomous Self Configuring Multi-Cell Robots that adapt to various environments and are capable of cooperative efforts. <br><br> <br><br> <br><br>

WIND POWER
Pavel Sergeevitch Krasnov
St. Joseph Catholic High School, Ogden Utah, Weber County

The main objective of my project was to construct a miniature replica of a three-bladed wind turbine and to test it. Also,to cnstruct data tables containing series of voltage to wind speed and amperage to wind speed readings, and to construct a power curve graph of the wind turbine. <br><br> I have constructed my wind turbine using various materials, including galvanized pipe, and lexan plastic. The wind turbine is 15' tall from the ground to the tip of the rotor diameter. I used a 24 V, DC natural magnet motor for a generator, and had a gear and belt reduction ratio of 108.5:1.<br><br> Using a Davis digital anenometer to read the wind speed and Fluke multimeters to read the current and the electromotive force, as well as a 1 kOhm resistor for a load, I constructed a data table containing electromotive force and current readings for every wind speed, ranging from 0 to 30 mph. I tested the wind turbine by mounting it on to a truck bed. I mounted the anenometer to the front of the truck in order to read the true airspeed, and strng the leads with the meters inside the cabin. I recorded the appropriate values in the data table. Using Ohm's Law equation W=IE, I have calculated the power reading for every wind speed. I then constructed three line graphs for the data. The x-axis showed the wind speed, and the y-axis showed the voltage, the amperage, and the power. <br><br> In my experiment, I have proved that wind power is a clean and reliable, and efficient source of energy. I have shown how my little generator can output over 2.6 watts of electrical power solely from the kinetic energy of the wind.

WHAT'S UP WITH BUMPY WINGS?
Ian S. Johnson
Susquenita High School, Duncannon, Pennsylvania, USA

The tubercles or bumps, on the front of a humpback whale’s fins, allow the whale to achieve incredible maneuverability by increasing lift, decreasing drag, and increasing the stall point by forty percent. These incredible bumps, when transferred from the natural system to an engineered system, also known as biomimicry, will allow airplanes, cars, and boats to become more maneuverable, and will allow them to travel further and faster than ever before. This project studied the effect of leading edge bumps on airfoil performance at increasing angles of attack. <br><br> Specifically, airfoils with leading edge bumps will have increased performance due to increase in lift and decrease in drag. The increase in performance may be due to the tubercles creating vortices running the length of the airfoil. This injection of momentum or energy into the flow keeps the airflow attached to the upper and lower surface of the airfoil. This energy also aids in increasing lift and decreasing drag at high angles of attack, ultimately delaying the onset of stall. <br><br> Two airfoils, one with bumps and one without, designed using the NACA airfoil specifications 5315, were tested in a previously constructed wind tunnel. A new sensor system was developed and constructed for the wind tunnel to obtain more accurate lift and drag measurements. Each of these airfoils was tested at a series of angles of attack from zero to ten degrees. At each angle of attack, both airfoils were tested 10 times, for a total of 140 tests.<br><br>

This project demonstrates the ability to build and interface a modular rover with onboard sensors for a cost of only $102.68. In its current state, the rover can return streaming audio and video, battery level, and compass direction to the user. In addition, the rover establishes its connection using wireless Internet technologies, providing mobility as far as the Internet reaches. <br><br> All components are interfaced through an old discarded laptop. The operating system used is Linux, an open-source alternative to Windows and MacOS. This allows extended freedom in designing project software. Open-source projects developed by others were manipulated to provide the video and audio feed. A wide range of Linux GPS software also exists and its use will be researched in future work. <br><br> To reduce costs, a motor controller with speed control was designed and built using mostly recycled electronic equipment. Speed control in high-wattage systems must meet special demands in order to operate without excessive heating. To meet this challenge, a pulse width modulated signal was used which oscillates the power provided to the motors instead of simply restricting electrical flow. Through research, the ideal frequency for controlling the motor was determined to be 1 kHz. Early programs produced a pulse as low as 83Hz. The final program was improved to achieve 852Hz, nearly optimized.<br><br> Project applications are broad, including security, inspection, environmental monitoring, and eventually autonomous navigation. Due to its modular design and my extensive documentation, others can economically reproduce the rover and do their own research. <br><br>

ADVANCED OPTICAL CAMOUFLAGE
Ian Michael Fuller
Bellbrook High School, Bellbrook Ohio, United States of America

Question: Is it possible to conceal an object by creating a suit that utilizes advanced optical electronics? <br><br>Hypothesis: By using a new method of concealment, this project will design a method to create a suit that conceals the wearer by making a viewer perceive what is behind the wearer. <br><br> This project has devised a system that may achieve the goal of optical active camouflage. A camouflage suit could be constructed by using thousands of color sensors and emitters. Using many sensors would allow camouflage from many different viewing angles. There are still several variables that need to be accounted for when dealing with this new idea for camouflage; the angle that the object would be viewed at, both in the X and Y axis, and the relationships between the distance of the object to the background and the distance from the object to the viewer. There were several steps and processes involved in this project.<br><br>• Choosing and researching the correct hardware<br><br>• Learning C programming<br><br>• Calibrating the sensor using a known intensity from the LED<br><br>• Constructing board schematics using OrCAD<br><br>• Designing the board layouts using AutoCAD<br><br>• Soldering all the integrated chips to the board<br><br>Camouflage is something that has been in use for centuries. As technology increases, so does the complexity of camouflage. With the availability of electronic components, this project will attempt to make one giant step forward in the evolution of disguise and concealment. <br><br>

THE INVENTION OF NEODYMIUM MAGNETIC SUSPENSION SYSTEM
Josh Paul Jones
Wilcox-Hildreth High School, Wilcox NE, USA

The overal purpose of this project was to design, build, and test a suspension system that performs better than the traditional spring over shock suspension. Large technological automotive advancements have been made in all areas except in the suspension area. The system I invented uses the basic principle that the isotonic sides of a magnet repel. <br><br> My hypothesis is that the repelling force of the electrons in the magnetic field created by the magnets when arranged in an isotonic pattern would react faster then the atoms rearranging in the steel spring. <br><br> A medium priced remote control car with independent spring over shock suspension was used to represent an average priced car with similar characteristics. I designed a unit that used the neodymium magnets as suspension. I used a small electric treadmill equipped with a speed bump to test my new design. First, I measured the distance from the speed bump to the point of contact with the surface. I compared the results of the trials using the two systems. The trials were conducted several times to engage different results. All had similar outcomes. The Neodymium Magnetic Suspension System had a shorter distance; hence a faster reaction. From the results of my tests and the inferential statistics, I concluded my hypothesis was correct. <br><br> Future research includes a similar design on the school’s power drive car. My invention of the Neodymium Magnetic Suspension System may be applied to any vehicle that incorporates the importance of traction and ride qualities.

BOMB SNIFFING ROBOT
Evan Bernard Cummings
St. Joseph's Catholic High School, Ogden, Utah, USA

Many current bomb-detection strategies (such as used in airport security) rely on fixed detectors and methods of getting people and objects to move through those detectors. This proof-of-concept project seeks to build an inexpensive, efficient, mobile bomb-detecting technology. In order to maximize the effectiveness of such technology, it uses a strategy of multiple, low-cost robots working together to detect and locate the explosive. To demonstrate that such technology is workable, this project adopted two simultaneous procedures; the development of a prototype robot which used volatile organic sensors in place of explosives detectors, and the creation of a computer simulation to demonstrate the effectiveness of multiple robots in a variety of environments. The robot functions as expected, avoiding obstacles using infrared sensors and detecting and locating volatile organics. The data from the simulation shows that the team of robots were always able to locate the simulated bomb, regardless of the shape and size of the “room” in which they searched. The results suggest that the proposed strategy meets the initial goals of the project and that further development should be pursued.<br><br>

PRESSURE BRAKING
Alexander Winslow Mavrogordato 
Hilton Head Preparatory, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, USA 

The purpose of this experiment was to design a more efficient brake light system for a vehicle. The new model was based on a two-color system. The colors are associated with the stages of braking and the brake pressure applied at each stage. A combination of red and blue Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) was used to indicate the amount of pressure being applied to the brake. These colors were chosen after conducting research as to which color induced the most rapid recognition by the human eye and therefore, the quickest braking response.<br><br> The design consisted of four levels of braking: light brake (single red light), medium brake (two red lights), hard brake (three red lights) and emergency/no traction brake (combination of three red lights and one blue light). The LEDs were placed in an ascending slope linear design. A brake simulator was built in order to illustrate all of the different braking possibilities and scenarios. <br><br>In conclusion, this new brake light gives the driver more information allowing for better driving decisions. No longer will a driver have to differentiate between another driver’s light tap and a panic braking situation built on the basis of a single brake light system. <br><br>

DON'T WASTE ENERGY STOPPING
Adam James Leiferman
Kimball School, Kimball, S.D., United States

I built an automobile energy recovery device that saves energy normally lost during braking and makes it usable to the vehicle. The device uses two air conditioner compressors to slow the vehicle. The compressors are attached to the driveshaft of the vehicle through two belts. When braking is needed the compressors are engaged by tightening the belts. As the compressors rotate, they pump atmospheric air into a tank. To increase the amount of braking, more backpressure is put on the compressors by partially closing a valve inside the vehicle. The air that is compressed into the tank is let out through a regulator to turn an impact wrench. The impact wrench turns a 12-volt generator that charges the battery of the vehicle. If the car is stopped once every 15 to 25 minutes this device can completely remove the need for an alternator. If stopping is not required for long periods of time, a backup alternator on the engine would be needed. I tested the modifications to my vehicle by comparing its fuel mileage using the device and using the conventional brakes. I found that the average increase in fuel mileage while using my device was 1.4 miles to the gallon. I also found that when my device was used to replace the original brakes the stopping distance increased.

CAN FLOW CONTROL DEVICES SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE DRAG?
Sumontro Lal Sinha
Oxford High School, Oxford MS, Laffeyette 

Sumontro L. Sinha<br><br>Oxford High School, Oxford MS<br><br> An object moving through a liquid or gaseous body always faces drag. Drag is a problem that goes back to the first time anyone tried to make anything fly. Drag wastes fuel and increases costs. The purpose of this project in its present form is to measure drag on a model rocket, understand the theory behind it and see if the drag can be reduced using simple flow control methods. The project has been wholly successful so far. <br><br> The flow control devices that were applied to the rocket were a tape cone in the back of the rocket to reduce form drag and a strip of tape wrapped around the rocket body right behind the nosecone to reduce skin friction. <br><br> I first assembled five identical rockets and placed one of them in a windtunnel. I measured total drag in the windtunnel tests using a wake drag rake, first with nothing on it, then with with the tape cone and lastly with the tape around the nosecone. The second method reduced total drag while the first increased drag. I then launched a control rocket with nothing on it and an experimental rocket with the tape around the nosecone. <br><br> I concluded that my experiment was a success. The experimental rocket with the simple tape behind the nosecone flow control device almost doubled the altitude. My hypothesis was proven correct. Flow control devices can significantly reduce drag. <br><br>

PERFORMANCE OF ELECTRIC MOTOR VS. PETROLEUM ENGINE IN AUTOMOTIVE RACING
Brent Singleton
Bonneville, Ogden, Uah, USA

The purpose of the research is to compare electric automotive technology to that of petroleum based vehicles. An electric powered dragster was constructed previously to allow the voltage, amperage, and battery temperature to be altered to maximize speed and acceleration. In the current research time slips were used to gather data from sanctioned race tracks. Data was then analyzed and compared to petroleum dragsters. In comparing the electric (electro) dragster to the petroleum (petrol) dragster it was concluded that the electro-dragster was not only more powerful and less costly, but more consistent due to the lack of variables compared to an petrol-dragster. World energy and environmental issues require us to look at alternative energies and by applying alternative energies to racing we would be able to understand that petroleum is not the only powerful source of energy for transportation.

THE EFFECTS OF WING SHAPE AND SWEEP ON LIFT
Benjamin Derek Gordon
Amherst County High School/Central Virginia Governor's School, Amhers, VA

The purpose of this study was to determine if the shape and sweep of a wing affect lift. Testing of the wings took place at a central Virginia high school between the months of November and December 2002. Three differently shaped wings were swept forward and backward. The shapes were rectangular, tapered front, and tapered back. The data collected was pressure data, collected with a pressure differential sensor, on the top and bottom of the wing and then the difference between the two was taken. A two-way ANOVA and a tukey test were used to analyze data. An alpha level of 0.05 was used. It was found that there was no significant difference (F[1, 42] p=0.89) in the sweep factor. There was a significant difference (F[2,42] p=3.25E-06) in the shape factor. There was also a significant interaction (F[2,42] p=3.96E-08). The two-way ANOVA showed that the wing sweep does not affect the lift properties, but shape affects lift properties. The two-way ANOVA also showed that the shapes reacted differently to different sweeps.

My experiment was over bridges and a safety system that would warn motorists of a collapse of a bridge. The purpose of my experiment was not only to see if a working bridge safety system could be constructed but also if it could be done cost-efficiently. <br><br> I constructed my bridge out of wood and tried to simulate what would happen in the actual event of a bridge collapse. I then built a concept version of how the bridge safety system could actually work. I made this out of pieces from a small metal construction set, two electrical switches, metal wires, 2 AA batteries, and two light bulbs.<br><br> In conclusion of my experiment, I found that my bridge safety system was in fact a success. I hope perhaps safety systems such as this one will be put to use to prevent future tragedies.<br><br>

ENERGY FOR THE FUTURE FUEL CELL CAR?
Cassie Arien Lynn Abel
Hobson Public School, Hobson, Montana, United States

The purpose of this project was to develop an efficient hydrogen fuel cell vehicle. A benefit is that without combustion or pollution, they convert chemical energy into electrical energy. Fuel cells have the potential to power cars, trucks, and buses without causing harm to the environment.<br><br> A fuel cell car was built consisting of a reversible fuel cell in which the process of electrolysis was carried out using power from an attached solar panel. When the motor was connected to the fuel cell, the car was propelled as the front wheels moved, and as it ran, the temperature of the fuel cell increased. The gas volume in the tanks decreased being consumed by the fuel cell. The average distance the car traveled using 24 mL of hydrogen and 12 mL of oxygen is 201.6 meters. The average speed of the car is .303 meters per second. The average no-load voltage of the fuel cell is 948mV and the average operating voltage is 800mV. The average short circuit current is .2A. The efficiency of the fuel cell calculated as 49% with 5% being converted to heat. The only emission of the fuel cell is water.<br><br> An electric current forms because electrons flow from the platinum alloy anode to the cathode through the nafion foil electrolyte. This current provides the necessary voltage to operate the motor. According to this information, cars can be run by fuel cells efficiently. Therefore, the engineering goal was met by this experiment.<br><br>

DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF PLANAR GLUCOSE SENSOR ARRAYS
Parvathy Rama Menon, Westview High School
Portland, OR USA

Affecting over 150 million people worldwide, diabetes is one of the world's foremost health concerns. All of these patients must monitor their blood glucose levels, some as many as 5 times per day. Implantable glucose sensors will one day replace the currently used needle-and-blood-strip method. Our particular sensor works by sensing an electrical change on the surface due to an enzyme-activated reaction between glucose and oxygen; resistance between the two endpoints of the sensor varies inversely with the glucose level. We fabricated arrays of 0.2 - 2 cm long glucose sensors onto p-type silicon wafers using photolithography and metal deposition. An ultra-thin, (4-nm) discontinuous gold layer served as the glucose-sensitive region and the chrome bonding pads were deposited at the endpoints. In addition to the fabrication experiment, another experiment was done to control crosstalk between the sensors of the fabrication set. After fabrication, we immobilized the enzyme onto the sensor (glucose oxidase, GOD) and tested the sensors in three different glucose concentration solutions (5, 25, and 100mM) using point-tipped probes and a digital multimeter. The presence of silicon dioxide was varied - to explore its role in the sensor electrical properties. The sensor yield was 12.5%, and showed no direct impact of oxidation and sensor geometry on sensitivity. Our immediate goal is to improve the output of our process so that the experiment results can be more meaningful and conclusive. Once planar glucose sensors are fully developed, they will be a significant improvement to the current painful and inconvenient method. <br><br>

Cameron Alexander Martin
Imlay City High School, Imlay City, Michigan, USA

This is phase I of two part series of experiments aimed towards designing a Shuttle Inspection Vehicle.<br><br>The overall design goal is to create a Shuttle Inspection Vehicle that is controlled through the use of a Cold Gas Thruster system of valves, servos and thrusters.<br><br>The purpose of this first year's project is to design and build the valve mechanisms required for the Cold Gas Thruster system. This first step of the project is critical due to its primary role in making the system function properly.<br><br>For testing, Finite Element Analysis will be used to determine the stresses the valve is experiencing. Once the stresses are calculated, and are not too much for the material, the thruster will be test fired to determine the output. <br><br>Based on these calculations, the thruster "burn" time will be evaluated. This allows for guidance system calibration for mass and inertia.

A NON-PHOTOLITHOGRAPHIC APPROACH TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF N-TYPE MOSFET DEVICES USING FIB TECHNOLOGY
Ryna Karnik
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland, OR, USA

The purpose of this project was to devise a procedure by which it was possible to directly microform/micromachine transistors onto a silicon substrate during physical silicon debug, thereby bypassing post-manufacturing photolithographic processes. Possible applications of this method include in-situ device formation during chip editing, and post-manufacture device creation in three-dimensional microchips. P-type Si was used as the substrate, on which a 1ƒÝm layer of SiO2 was grown. To prevent issues due to sample charging while milling with the Focused Ion Beam (FIB), AuPd was used to frame windows on the SiO2. An FEI FIB 610 with a Ga Liquid Metal Ion Source was used to both mill out the geometry of the transistor and to dope the source and drain regions through maskless implantation of Ga into the substrate. 10x10 arrays of diode and gate structures were created and tested to determine optimum dimensions for the devices. The transistors were created by using the FIB to mill the diode regions and deposit the platinum contacts. A heat treatment was used to anneal the silicon and allow the Ga to take substitutional lattice sites in the substrate. The transistor was tested using a 4-point probe station. Results of source/drain diode testing of the transistors gave strong evidence supporting the hypothesis that gallium was an n-type dopant. When tested, the transistors showed MOSFET characteristics, with an average threshold voltage of 3.5V. Scanning Electron Microscope images were taken of devices after testing, allowing the actual geometry of each device to be precisely determined.

THE MAGNETIC SHOCK ABSORBER
Derek John Gardels
Wilcox-Hildreth High School, Wilcox, NE, USA

Albert Einstein, one of the greatest physicists of all time, said that his fascination with the natural world began as a child when his father gave him a magnetic compass. More than 2000 years ago, the Greeks experimented with a mineral that pulled in iron objects toward it. One end of this mineral always pointed north when suspended freely on a string. They described this mineral as being magnetic. <br><br> The purpose of my project is to harness this magnetic energy for use in a shock absorber. I hypothesize that my shock will be functional and offer a smoother ride for passengers. <br><br> I purchased eight magnets off the internet. They are made from neodymium, grade N38. They are very strong for their size and thus well suited for my project. PVC pipe was used for my tube instead of metal for several reasons. Metal tubing would not allow the magnets and the shaft to slide freely causing a slower response time, increased wear on both the magnets and the pipe, and a shorter product life due to the increased wear. Next, I took the shock absorber and tested how much weight it could hold. I then determined that it would be best suited for use on a Honda 50 motorcycle. I put it on the motorcycle and compared the smoothness to the standard shock absorber. I plan to patent my design so that my design can be used on other motorcycles and ATVs.

ION THRUSTER DEVELOPMENT AND ANALYSIS
Thomas Andrew Trudel
Muhlenberg High School, Reading PA, United States

The goal of this project was to design, construct and test a functional RF (radio frequency) ion propulsion system and to compare ion generation efficiencies using different gas flow arrangements. The propulsion system consisted of an ion thruster, RF plasma generator, and a gas flow regulator. The ion thruster was fabricated using a glass tube, aluminum end caps, thin ceramic spacers, and molybdenum sheet metal and screening. It was approximately 6.0 inches in length and 1.75 inches in diameter. All thruster testing was conducted under high vacuum conditions. The numerous systems necessary to carry out the testing involved with this project were all assembled from scratch with the exception of the vacuum chamber, mass flow controller, and Faraday cup. <br><br> Successful firing of the ion thruster was achieved. The ion generating performance of the engine was measured using a Langmuir probe and Faraday cup over a range of RF power levels and grid accelerating voltages. The operating parameters of the thruster were characterized using a traditional straight gas feed delivery nozzle. The efficiency of ion production using a novel spiral feed gas flow was also examined and then compared to the traditional straight gas feed. The spiral gas flow produced substantially higher ion density levels than the traditional design. The spiral gas feed is unique and could have considerable significance in improving thruster efficiency and extending fuel reserves for space applications of RF ion thrusters.<br><br>

WASH-O-MATIC
Jeffrey David Hartsell
Pleasant Grove High School, Texarkana, Texas, USA 

The purpose of this engineering project was to modify a washing machine so that it would automatically dispense liquid soap, fabric softener, and bleach. In order to do this, a control module was programmed to read the washer fill level and the washer cycle. The information is held in the control module and then sent to the cylinoid valves to tell them when to open for solution dispension. Numerous tests were performed to determine the amount of pressure needed to add the solutions. Pressure was added by an air pump that can pump fourteen pounds of air pressure, but only two pounds of pressure was needed. The containers were attached to each other so that the air could go through one tube instead of three. The containers were then attached to the cylinoid valves and then the valves would dispense the solution over the washer tub through tubes attached to the top of the valves. Three seperate push buttons for each solution could be activated to tell the control module which solutions needed to be added.

DOES POUND TEST DETERMINE DISTANCE?
Christopher Michael Ballard
Northside High School, Roanoke, Virginia, U.S.A.

This experiment was to determine which pound test of Trilene XL Smooth Casting Fishing Line would travel the greatest distance when propelled by a casting mechanism.<br><br> It was hypothesized that if 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14-pound test smooth casting fishing line are propelled, then the 10-pound test line will travel the greatest distance.<br><br> A casting mechanism was designed and built to allow the fishing line to be cast by releasing a gate latch which thrust a fishing pole forward with the same amount of force each time. The mechanism was constructed from an original design. The six different pound test lines were attached to the mechanism individually and tested. Each line was cast when the wind was calm outdoors. A total of fifty trials were recorded for each line. Each cast was measured by a stationary tape measure attached to the mechanism.<br><br> The results showed that the 4-pound test line traveled the greatest average distance that was 43.3 feet. <br><br> In conclusion, the hypothesis if 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14-pound test smooth casting fishing line are propelled, then the 10-pound test line will travel the greatest average distance was not supported. The 4-pound test line traveled the greatest average distance followed by the 6, 10, 8, 12, and 14.<br><br> The project informs consumers which pound test line to purchase. Manufacturers might consider using the apparatus to test casting distance. The device could be adapted for use by the handicapped fishermen.<br><br>

A DESIGN CONCEPT OF A MULTI-CHAMBERED RADIAL IN-FLOW (MCRI) ROCKET ENGINE
Benjamin William Glass
Community High School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA

A Multi-Chambered Radial In-Flow (MCRI) Engine is a new type of annular rocket engine that has the potential for lower engine weight and higher performance at all altitudes. The MCRI concept uses a continuously variable self-optimizing, externally constrained expansion nozzle, capable of producing optimal thrust levels at any altitude, coupled with the ability to perform differential throttling for the purpose of thrust vectoring. This project involved the conceptual development of the idea, the design of the initial MCRI test engine and design and operation of a cold flow simulation prototype. Qualitative flow analysis of the cold flow prototype was accomplished with a Schlieren flow visualization method.

EXPERIMENTAL AIRCRAFT DESIGN AND TESTING
Thomas Andrew Trudel
Muhlenberg High School, Reading Pa, United States

This project researched the development and testing of the airframe for an experimental aircraft, the SS-1. The aircraft is an original design meant for low-level flight at high speeds. A wind tunnel and test fixtures were built to measure the effects of the design variations. Five airfoil shapes were built and tested for lift and drag at three different angles of attack. The airfoil design that produced the desired results was selected for additional development. The camber of that airfoil was then modified twice. Lift and drag measurements were used to select the optimal airfoil design. A model of the airframe was fabricated and tested for airflow and drag. The airframe design was modified after analysis of the wind tunnel test results. Wings, canards and rudders, based on the selected airfoil design, were added to the modified airframe to create the finished model. The final model was wind tunnel tested and compared to the original design. The testing and modifications resulted in an aircraft design that is superior to the initial design.

PHOTOVOLTAICS AS A PORTABLE POWER SOURCE
Larry Gunnar Nelson Jr.
Massachusetts Academy of Math and Science at WPI, Worcester MA, USA

Creating solar energy that is portable is an important field that will be vital to our energy needs in the future. The purpose of this project was to design and create a portable power pack that will recharge itself in sunlight. Using a 17-watt solar panel, a 12 volt 18 amp-hour sealed lead acid battery, charge controller, ac inverter, and multiple types of connectors, the power pack was built with the dimensions of 27 inches by 27 inches by 7 inches. The power pack incorporates two key features that makes it new and unique. The first is the ability for the power pack to easily expand its solar input and battery storage through external terminal blocks. The second is the power pack is all-inclusive and requires no setup.<br><br> On a sunny day the power pack will charge for over 5 hours. The recharge time for the power pack is 7.5 times the discharge time at 60 watts. Potential improvements that will be investigated include weight reduction, higher efficiency, smaller size, and the ability to power larger loads while incorporating other external power sources for recharging. Some of the practical applications for this device are camping, power supply for field research, and an emergency power supply.<br><br>

THE ELECTRONIC SCROLL-WIRE A NEW VERSATILE AND APPLICABLE INTERFACE
Bert Thomas Ruyten
Tullahoma High School, Tullahoma, TN, 37388 USA

The purpose of this study was to design the Scroll-Wire, an electrical interface that by measuring the resistance across two wires and a conductive stylus, will determine the position of a conductor relative to minimum and maximum positions defined by the user during the Scroll-Wire’s calibration cycle. The Scroll-Wire’s interface consists of two parallel wires, a push button to activate calibration, and three tri-color LEDs for status indication, all mounted on a panel. By moving a conductive stylus across the Scroll-Wire, a digital output will change proportionally to the stylus’s position, with zero corresponding to the minimum registered position, and an output of 255 corresponding to the maximum defined position. In addition, the Scroll-Wire’s touch activation capability can signal to an external device to read the value when the stylus is removed.<br><br> The Scroll-Wire will use both analog and digital electronics. In this study, the Scroll-Wire’s concept was developed, the circuitry was diagrammed, and the first two stages of circuitry were built. Diagnostics later revealed some principle errors but confirmed the validity of the Scroll-Wire concept. By continued study and development, the Scroll-Wire will interface various electronic devices and may lead to the development of new technologies, such as specialized interfaces for quadriplegics.

CRASH MONITORING DEVICE FOR VEHICLES WITH FOUR OR MORE WHEELS
Allison Pauline Smyth
Massachusetts Academy of Mathematics and Science, Worcester, MA, USA

Car accidents have become a large problem in the United States with the number of accidents increasing each year. A crash-monitoring device that can be mounted on the front of a vehicle to warn the driver of a potential frontal accident was developed to reduce the number of accidents during city and highway driving. This device uses a Polaroid sonar module to determine the distance between two vehicles and gives the driver a visual warning if he or she is following too closely. It also determines if the driver is catching up to the vehicle in front of him or her too quickly and visually warns the driver when necessary. It adjusts for different weather conditions as well as vehicles with different tire sizes. Though the general concept of this device was developed, more testing is needed to prove that it would reduce accidents.

WE ARE GO FOR ORBIT PHASE III USING COMPUTER SIMULATION TO SIMULATE A NEW LOW COST GUIDANCE SYSTEM
Cameron Alexander Martin
Imlay City High School, Imlay City, MI, USA

This was the third part in a number of experiments that will eventually lead to orbiting the first amateur satellite.<br><br>This year's experiment is a two part experiment. The purpose of this year's project was to use computer simulation to simulate the controlled flight of a rocket using the TVC's that were designed and tested last year. After the useful information was gathered from the simulation the rocket was actually test flown to determine the accuracy of the simulation.<br><br>To accomplish these goals, the computer modeling software Working Model was used.

A NEW TECHNOLOGY FOR PORTABLE CONSTRUCTIONAL BEAMS AND A PROCESS FOR THEIR PRODUCTION AND USE WITH APPLICATION TO PROVIDING SHELTER FOR REFUGEE POPULATIONS
Micah Lathaniel Toll
Cedar Crest High School, Lebanon Pennsylvania, United States of America

Testing of prototype constructional beams previously developed as part of this project determined that corrugated polypropylene stress skin with a two-part expanding polyurethane foam core was the most efficacious combination, yielding all desired physical characteristics and utilities for a commercial prototype. <br><br>This year, new and more complex beam designs were developed and tested. Also a simple heat welding technique was developed to increase efficiency and decrease costs over gluing as was done previously.<br><br>These beams improve and expand the quality, utility, and range of shelters that can be built using this product. Two new beam joining methods were successfully developed: staking and notching. Wall and roof sections built from parallel, stacked beams can provide significant thermal insulation for use in areas with extreme temperature regimes. <br><br>Compression testing of beams used as vertical posts or wall studs was performed using commercial testing equipment. Results demonstrated that the loading potential for beams used as vertical posts greatly exceeds expected loads. Empirical destructive testing was attempted but found to be impractical due to the excessive weights involved. Theoretical loading capabilities for the full-sized shelters were calculated and were in excess of those expected in actual applications. <br><br>Beams were subjected to flotation tests to determine buoyancy. Results indicate that beam rafts would be highly effective in carrying both people and supplies.<br><br><br>

SUPERCRITICAL FLUIDS: A NOVEL PROCEDURE FOR INCREASING THE COMPATIBILITY AND APPLICATIONS OF POLYMER BLENDS
Mitchell Stephen Fourman
Ward Melville High School, East Setauket NY, United States of America

An ideal plastic can be defined as a material with a high degree of both ductility and tensile strength. A polymer blend can be created to achieve this goal, but polymers are incompatible with each other, and the resulting blend is often brittle and weak. It is of interest to increase the degree of compatibility of these blends, thus allowing an expanded range of commercial applications. Recently Koga et al [Europhys. Lett, 60 (4), 559-565, (2002)] showed that supercritical CO2 (scCO2) is a universal co-solvent for thin polymer films. scCO2 was used as a co-solvent in the current work to study three polymer blends: Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and Ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA); PMMA and Polybutadiene (PB); and Polystyrene (PS) and PMMA. Polymers were melt mixed in a Brabender, molded, and exposed to scCO2 at variable pressures. Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) showed that the modulus and ductility of the exposed materials increased due to foaming in the sample. A confined polymer film was formed to further analyze the effects of this procedure. PS-PMMA confined by a silicon oxide layer was exposed to scCO2 for four hours. Atomic Force Microscopy showed increased miscibility within the polymer blend, as power spectral density of the film surfaces showed increased smoothness following exposure. Applications of these new materials include car bumpers, tires, heat-resistant machine casings and belts, as well as in Homeland Security, where these materials can be used as structural supports and gear casings. Ultra-thin plastic films can be used as coatings for computer wiring and as a substrate for microprocessors.

LISSA: LIGHT INTENSITY AND SONAR SENSING ASSISTANT
Sophia Alexandra Goreczky
Shepton High School, Plano, Texas, United States of America

The purpose of this project was to design and build a working prototype of a device that can assist visually impaired individuals to navigate within an indoor environment. Existing components providing distance and light sensing technology were examined. Voice synthesis was considered as a means to communicate relevant information to the user. A criteria was set to guide the design and implementation of the prototype.<br><br>The prototype built integrates ultrasonic and infrared distance sensors, combined with a photocell (light sensor) to detect light intensity. Measurements captured by sensors are processed and communicated via a voice synthesis module. A simple user interface allows the user to select diverse operating modes. A programmable microcontroller module, acting as the integration core, allows for management of the prototype's functions, both as a standalone device or “tethered” to a host computer. The device was tested with the help of a visually impaired volunteer. Valuable feedback was gathered and incorporated into this project.<br><br>A device can be built following the criteria established. The current device can serve as the basis for further enhancement by adding position and direction sensing technologies, as well as a time reference and enhanced audio interface. Findings from this project may also be used as the thought basis to build a microprocessor based , network enabled “assistant”.<br><br>

DON'T SWEAT IT ABSTRACT
Sincer Jacob
William Mason High School, Mason, Ohio, United States

Earlier this football season something occurred that changed a life. During football season, this player encountered a heat stroke that resulted ending the majority of the season. The doctor said the cause of the stroke was dehydration, and a proposed solution was ‘undergears’. <br><br>As an athlete, people want the edge over opponents. Athletes are willing to do anything to succeed over competition. Due to this drive, many things are sought after; such as ankle weights, running shoes, and undergears. Undergears specifically are sought after highly, yearly. Due to the overwhelming desire of this fabric, prices range between $30-$80 dollars for shirts. Every undergear is designed to wick away sweat, and keep the athlete dry, cool and light. However, the technology behind them differs greatly. <br><br>Which type of undergear wicks away perspiration from your body the best? Is there a difference? Or is it a scam? <br><br> After doing systematic research, hypothesis stated Under Armor (single layer, skin tight fabric) would perform best in the experiment. <br><br> Research for this project took months; many things were thought of/ smaller tests were run, until the ideal experiment was designed. <br><br> The experiment was to make a kiwi similar to human, then make it sweat in a set environment by moving in constant motion while wearing the undergear to test how efficient the wicking ability of the fabric was. All of this would resemble an athlete working out in a typical summer day. <br><br> The experiment was a success, and results came out even. Two of the four fabrics won; one of them being Under Armor. The hypothesis was supported to some extent. Results showed a great deal, however outcomes varied. <br><br>

SOLAR HYDROELECTRIC GENERATOR
Mariann Poling Kempes
McCurdy High School, Espanola, New Mexico, United States of America

The purpose of this experiment was to design and test a working solar hydroelectric generator. The main concept that was tested was the thermo-siphon system. A thermo-siphon system uses passive, or non-electric, solar energy to pump water against gravity. This design pumps water into a storage tank where, at a desired time, it can be poured into a simple hydroelectric generator to create electricity. <br><br> A collection box was built to gather solar heat and transfer it into copper pipes. The pipes ran between two tanks, an upper and lower. The lower tank supplied the collector with cool water and the upper tank collected the water that was successfully moved.<br><br> After several tests, it became apparent that the application of mirrors around the sides of the collector could increase the temperature of the water inside. This was done, and the water reached temperatures that were high enough to turn it into steam. The design was slightly altered to accommodate the steam and re-condense in into water to be collected.<br><br> In order for the project to be applied to real life, a simple generator would have to be built and added. The design of the generator, since it has already been proven, was not a primary concern that was tested in this experiment. The conclusion of this experiment is that the proposed solar hydroelectric generator worked. The concept of using a thermo-siphon system to move water through a generator was proven and could possibly be applied to a realistic setting.<br><br>

DESIGN AND BUILD OF AN MHD GENERATOR UTILIZING A PARAFFIN BASED HYBRID ROCKET MOTOR
Kirk Michael Davenport
Tullahoma High School, Tullahoma, Tennessee, United States

The idea for this project came from viewing tests done at a university on a magnetohydrodynamic generator powered by a liquid rocket motor. After doing research on the subject it was determined that there were several advantages to using a MHD generator with a paraffin based hybrid rocket motor instead of a traditional liquid rocket motor. For instance, the need for only half the plumbing of a liquid rocket motor allows a hybrid rocket motor to be much lighter which would be an advantage for space based applications. Also, the fuel grain could have its seed for ionizing the plasma imbedded during fabrication and would therefore eliminate the need for a mixing system. From these concepts, a design was made for a MHD generator that could be powered by a paraffin based hybrid rocket motor. <br><br> This project was successful for a couple reasons. Through it issues that occur with trying to mix and pour a homogenous fuel grain were addressed. In addition, it was able to prove the concept that it is possible to generate electrical current with a MHD generator through the utilization of a paraffin based hybrid rocket motor. <br><br>

TIME AND LIFE INDICATORS OF OUTDOOR LIGHING YEAR 7
Brandon Eric Northcut
Monterey High School, Lubbock, TX, USA

The purpose is to write a program allowing me to keep the time a lamp is running and to turn on a LED indicator at 75% of the lamps manufactured life. The variables are the time increments I will test the circuit board program. If I write a program to make a circuit board to count the amount of time a light is operating, then I will be able to use the program to calculate when the life of a lamp is near its maximum rated life by turning on a LED indicator at 75% of the lamps life. <br><br>I first wrote a program that kept time that a lamp is burning. Then I added to the program, to turn on a LED after approximately 75% of the manufactured life of that lamp. After writing the program, I made a box that had a light fixture and a LED for a demonstration to show that the written program works. After writing the program and testing it under real conditions, I found that my program works. The LED indicator came on to indicate the lamps life is almost over at 75% of its life. This helps a utility company in light maintenance. I have proven the program to work and the LED indicator light will come on at 75% of the manufactured life of the lamp. My hypothesis was correct because I was able to write the program keeping time and turning on a LED at 75% of a lamps life.<br><br>

AND ALL THE LITTLE HOUSES WENT SPLAT
Malina Kay Simmers
Cornerstone Christian School, San Angelo, Texas

The purpose of this experiment was to determine which shaped building - circular or rectangular - better prevented flood damage. I took ten Jello boxes and shaped them into a recangular shape that was 8 by 11.5 inches. I then took nine Jello boxes and shaped them into a cicular shape. After shaping the buildings, I taped them together with packaging tape and painted the buildings purple. I took the rectangular building to the bottom of a small spillway, pinned it to the side of the spillway with a large cement block, and poured 114 liters of water against it. After pouring the water against it, I removed it an repeated the process with the circular building. I then tested the damage done to each building by measuring how much the buildings had collapsed. The side of the rectangular building collapsed 18 centimeters while the circular building did not show any external damamge other than loss of floor and paint. The circular building was better at withstanding oncoming flood water.

A SUBTERRANEAN TEST ON THE EFFECTIVE DISTANCE OF VARIOUS FUNGICIDE VOLUMES
Andrew Thomas Marin
Plano East Senior High School, Plano Texas, United States

Some fungi attack plants through their stolons and roots. One domestically prominent example is the fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis variety graminis. Because of the malevolent effects of this fungus, the golf course industry continuously explores means to control the outgrowth of the fungus. Previous tests have been conducted by aerosol application, but since this fungus thrives below the surface, this research investigates a subterranean application of the fungicide.<br><br> In the experiment, various volumes of the fungicide, Daconil Zinc, were applied at points on the surface of the ground in a fungus-laden plot. From the point of injection, samples were taken every inch up to six inches to determine the effectiveness of the fungicide as distance increased from the injection point. Each sample was rated based on the fungal outgrowth. The scores ranged from 0 to 5; a 0 being no outgrowth while a 5 was extreme outgrowth. In addition, a potential rating of 2.5 was defined as the threshold value. The best-fit line was calculated and the threshold value recorded. <br><br> The data show a logarithmic relationship between the outgrowth rating and the distance from the application point. This effectiveness is related to the fungicide transported by an amount of water.<br><br> In addition, the diffusion equation of soil physics is used to determine the diffusion of the liquid through this soil. When the diffusion data and effective-distance data is examined, dimensions of a subterranean applicator can be calculated. These dimensions reduce the amount of fungicide while maintaining a favorable fungus control level. <br><br>

ENGINEERING VISUAL ORCHESTRATION TECHNOLOGY "MUSIC PAINTER"
Siir Kilkis
Greenwood Laboratory School, Springfield, Missouri, United States of America

This project demonstrates the practical feasibility of combining human color and sound cognitions by engineering a Visual Orchestration Technology, which is based on a scientifically robust audible sound and visible light correlation provided by Siir’s Photo-Acoustic Theory. The Visual Orchestration Technology is the first to colorize orchestral arrangements, constructively coordinate color and sound stimuli for composers, conductors, and the impaired, and translate the Midi Sequence of an orchestral score into a new Color-Midi Sequence. <br><br> The Color-Midi Sequencing algorithm dynamically assigns spectral colors at different tone indexes to the notes being played by the orchestral instruments for every time interval in a measure. This Technology was applied to an orchestral arrangement and a visual color accompaniment on a standard orchestral seating chart was successfully generated on the computer screen. <br><br> The Visual Orchestration Technology has several attributes, including enhancing music cognition with color, harmonizing music through visual patterns, and enabling orchestration by hearing deficient composers. This Technology was reverse engineered to transform visual artwork into an orchestral arrangement and mathematically extended to thermo-optics forming the Rosetta Stone of light, sound, and heat. Further analyses indicated that this novel Technology can make perfect pitch widely accessible, reveal the architecture of music, and communicate music to individuals with the learning disability Congenital Amusia. It is concluded that the Visual Orchestration Technology emerges as a new engineering horizon in implementing creative devices by acousto- optical modulation with an accurate coupling of the auditory and visual perception.<br><br>

TRANSMITTING SENSORY TOUCH FROM A PROSTHETIC LIMB
Samuel Joseph Hefty
Luke M. Powers Catholic High School, Flint, Michigan, USA

The loss of a limb from injury or disease can be devastating for an individual. The ability to move can be achieved with high-tech, powered prosthetics, but the ability to sense touch is lost forever. Touch is important in how we process external information for optimal functioning. Impaired sensory touch can affect quality of life, even making movement less effective. Tactile information is processed via a network of electrical connections between nerve endings, mechanical receptors and the brain.<br><br> The purpose of this research project was to find a way to transmit sensory touch from a prosthetic limb. The experiment involved constructing a simple and sensitive touch sensor attached to a circuit. When stimulated, a weak electric current could be carried, like the impulse from a nerve ending, to a transmitter. Touch could be perceived as either skin vibrations from a small pager motor, or a tingling sensation from a weak electric current, on the remaining skin. Electric circuits were designed on the multisim computer program, then transferred to a breadboard and a circuit board. Hand models were constructed to show application of the touch sensor-transmitter unit to a prosthetic limb. A case study demonstrated adaptability of the sensor-transmitter in a test subject.<br><br> The project involved the study of electronics to design a touch sensor and skin stimulator that can be used in the future in prosthetic limbs. It is hoped that such research will improve the quality of life for people who suffer from limb loss. <br><br>

COST VS. SAFETY OF OUTDOOR LIGHTING
Brandon Eric Northcut
Evans, Lubbock, TX, USA

PURPOSE: My experiment is to compare Metal Halide and the High Pressure Sodium lamps. Which lamp is the most cost efficient and which gives the most light.<br><br> VARIABLES: Metal Halide and the High Pressure Sodium lamps.<br><br> HYPOTHESIS:I think the High Pressure Sodium will not only be the most cost efficient but also produce the most lumen output. <br><br> PROCEDURE: Set a pole with 2 fixtures mounted at approximately 29 feet off the ground. I will measure every 22.5 degrees around the pole giving me 9 different angles to measure the light output pattern. Using a rope tied to the pole along each marked angle and also marked at every 10 ft, I will then take foot-candles readings at every 10 feet along the rope recording my readings at each point starting at 10 feet from the pole to 60 feet away. I will then be able to determine which lamp gives off the most light. <br><br>RESULTS:I found the HPS lamp to provide the most lumen output and not to be the most cost efficient per lumen output. <br><br> CONCLUSION:I found the HPS lamp to give approximately 63% more lumen output than the MH. Even though the HPS cost was 5% more to operate, the lumen output was substantially greater than the MH. Therefore, economically the HPS would be the better lamp to use. I found my hypothesis to be partially correct. The HPS did have the most lumen output but was not the most cost efficient. <br><br>

FORMULATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF A "STOMACH-FRIENDLY" NSAID [IBUPROFEN DELIVERY SYSTEM]
Anuj Atul Shukla
White Station High School, Memphis, Tennessee, U.S.A

Doctors often prescribe drugs that have harmful side effects. In order to deal with these problems, doctors may prescribe other drugs. Therefore, pharmaceutical scientists are constantly searching for new ways to deliver combination drugs to solve the problem of patient compliance. Combining two or more drugs into a single dosage form such as a capsule or tablet requires a thorough understanding of properties of the drugs, raw materials, and equipment that is used to manufacture the dosage form. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are drugs with analgesic, antipyretic (fever reducing), and anti-inflammatory effects. However, due to their acidic nature, widespread use of NSAIDs result in adverse drug reactions such as irritation of the gastric mucosa (lining of the stomach) and/or gastric ulcers, which could induce bleeding and could often be fatal. Doctors often prescribe antancids to reduce pain in gastric ulcer patients. Therefore, the objective of this project was to design and formulate a combination dosage form (pellets) consisting of an NSAID (ibuprofen) and an antacid (sodium bicarbonate), using the extrusion spheronization process. The pelletization process was optimized using various process and formulation parameters including different types of extruders and different spheronization times. Several tests, such as sieve analysis, bulk and tap densities, friability, and dissolution were performed on the pellets. The antacid was able to neutralize the acidity of ibuprofen in the optimized pellets. This combination dosage form is expected to prevent the gastrointestinal irritation and possible bleeding (that can often be fatal) from the side effects of the NSAID.

DEVELOPMENT BY DESIGN AND TESTING OF A MINIATURE TURBINE TO HARNESS KINETIC ENERGY FROM AIRFLOW AROUND A MOVING AUTOMOBILE
Vijay Kailas Brihmadesam
Jackson Preparatory School, Jackson MS, Flowood

This project presents a summary of a successful design, fabrication and testing of wind turbines mounted on a car roof for the purpose of extracting power from the kinetic energy (dynamic pressure) contained in the wind flow around the car. The placement of the turbine was based on aerodynamic considerations. Various design concepts were tested and evaluated. Drag tests were conducted that showed the turbine did not negatively impact vehicle performance. NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics) ducts were evaluated and shown to offer additional choice for turbine design and placement. The results obtained from the tests conducted in this research demonstrate the feasibility for the efficient extraction of energy from wind flow around an automobile. Literature research consisting mainly of a review of NACA reports supported the findings of this study.

DESIGNING A PERSONAL AIRCRAFT FOR THE FUTURE OF SHORT-DISTANCE TRAVEL
Nicholas Hane Wiles
Academic Magnet High School, North Charleston, SC, USA

As the airlines become more congested and fight to remain financially sound, “air taxi” services are emerging and finding a niche for themselves within the air travel industry. These small airlines can provide a significant time advantage over conventional airlines. One of the main small aircraft in use by these companies is Cirrus Design’s SR22. The plane is capable of seating up to three passengers and a pilot and cruising at speeds from 180 to 160 KTAS. SR22s currently provide a time advantage for up to a 500-mile flight. The goal of this project was to design a personal aircraft capable of cruising faster and more efficiently than the Cirrus SR22. The design would be geared toward the air taxi market. Currently the fares on air taxis are high. However, if the taxi airlines flew faster, slightly larger, yet more efficient planes, the overall price per trip could be lowered. Finally, a plane that could cruise at an average of 200 KTAS would allow air taxi services to extend their competitive time advantage over airlines to about a 750-mile flight.<br><br>A Rutan-inspired canard configuration was chosen for the basic layout of the new design. Once complete, a comparative analysis was performed in Laminar Research’s X-Plane software to judge the design’s efficiency. The results showed that the new design could cruise faster, and more efficiently than the SR22. An average efficiency increase was simulated at about 5%. These results show that a more efficient design than the SR22 could be drafted.<br><br>

USE OF POLYMER GEL TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE SAFETY AND TRANSPORTABILITY OF LIQUID FUEL CELLS
Turner Reece Batty
Blue Valley North High School, Overland Park, Kansas, United States

Fuel cells are considered a likely method for producing clean, efficient energy; however, liquid fuels in Direct Oxidation Fuel Cells (DOFC) generally have many associated safety hazards. For instance, many fuels are flammable, produce hazardous fumes, can be spilled, and are toxic to plants and animals. A possible solution to the hazards associated with the transportation and use of liquid fuels would be to find ways to modify current fuels in order to eliminate or reduce safety issues. It was anticipated that the placement of liquid fuels in an acrylic sodium salt polymer would reduce the rate of fuel evaporation without significantly affecting the power and voltage output of a DOFC. To test this, a DOFC was run with varying concentrations of methanol solutions both with and without the presence of polymer gel. Another DOFC was run with varying concentrations of gelled and non-gelled solutions of sodium tetrahydridoborate, another prospective DOFC fuel. Another DOFC was run using fuel solutions with and without polymer gel containing varying mixtures of sodium tetrahydridoborate and methanol. Fuel evaporation rates of varying fuel formulations were also determined. The presence of polymer gel significantly decreased the rate at which fuel mass was lost to evaporation. There was no significant difference in the voltage and power outputs of the fuels formulations with and without polymer gel in fuel cells connected to circuits with relatively high resistances. However, significant decreases in voltage and power outputs occurred in gelled fuels connected to circuits with resistances less than 10 ohms.

THE CAPTURING AND UTILIZATION OF WASTED ENERGY
Janelle Marie Goettman
Burkburnett High School, Burkburnett, Texas, USA

The purpose of this project is to introduce a globally efficient way to reuse wasted energy. I wanted to find my own way to help our environment in the most resourceful way possible. This experiment proved most prone to my capabilities and interests. I believe that in the most productive hands, this idea can become a nationwide, even universal approach to helping the existing energy efficiency of our vehicles. I hypothesized that it would be possible to capture normally wasted energy required to bring a forward moving vehicle to a stop, and then utilize that captured energy to assist that vehicle to regain forward motion.<br><br> The possibility of this theory was first tested by constructing a prototype that would capture a portion of the wasted energy of the rotating wheel, store that wasted energy from braking, and then utilize that energy to assist the vehicle in regaining forward motion. To actually test my hypothesis, I put these steps into action with the use of my constructed prototype.<br><br> My initial hypothesis was correct. I theorized that it would be possible to capture the normally wasted energy required to bring a forward moving vehicle to a stop, and then utilize that captured energy to assist that vehicle in regaining forward motions. Due to an unfortunate limited amount of time, supplies, and funding, I was only able to construct a primitive prototype of what should be a simple and efficient mechanism. The prototype that I have constructed, however, does indeed answer my question to the possibility of creating such an instrument. I plan to proceed further in a second year study with this project. Optimistically, I intend to have the capabilities to be able to create an improved comprehension of my idea to the general public.<br><br>

WHICH TRUSS DESIGN WILL MAKE THE STRONGEST TRUSS BRIDGE?
Elaine Chan
Braintree High School, Braintree MA, USA

Truss Bridges are used and found everywhere. They are used for many different purposes; therefore, it is important to learn which truss design makes the strongest bridge. It is crucial for engineers to know which bridges are the most effective for a particular purpose and the experiment performed set out to achieve this. It was hypothesized that the design with the most triangles would be the strongest design because triangles create strength in truss bridges. Strength in triangles is a result of its ability to dissipate a heavy load to a considerably larger area.<br><br> In order to discover which truss design was the strongest for this experiment, several different truss designs were built and a bridge-crushing apparatus was used to crush them each in the same way. Six bridges of each of the six designs were constructed. <br><br> The hypothesis was proven to be correct because the William Howe Truss design contained a total of 96 triangles in its structure. It held up an average of about 49.33 pounds per square inch (psi). The weakest bridge, which held up only 33.33 psi, had only 36 triangles, again proving the hypothesis correct. <br><br> The data gathered from this experiment are important because it was found that there was a very strong correlation between the number of triangles in each design and its strength. The correlation coefficient was approximately 0.94; therefore, the results are significant. However, this experiment could be improved in many ways, and its improvement has already begun for the future! <br><br>

THE DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF THE MODIAK G2: A COLLAPSIBLE KAYAK WITH UNIFIED SKIN AND SKELETON
Christopher Dipak Modi
Yorktown High School, Yorktown, New York, United States of America 

This project consisted of the design and fabrication of the Modiak Collapsible Kayak with Unified Skin and Skeleton. Its basis was the hypothesis that a portable kayak could be designed and fabricated to be lighter in weight, more compact, easier to setup, and as capable of handling the open seas and the back country waterways as current portable kayaks. After two years of countless design revisions, prototype fabrications, and testing, the hypothesis has been proven true. The revolutionary design of the latest generation model of Modiak, the Modiak G2, allows it to outdo its similarly sized competitors, the Klepper AE Scout® and Sea Eagle 380x®, in the areas of weight, compactness, ease of setup, and price. The Modiak G2 can also significantly outdo the Klepper AE Scout®, and compete admirably with the Sea Eagle 380x® in the area of weight capacity. Furthermore, the balance of primary and secondary stability that resulted from the hydrodynamic hull design, makes the Modiak G2 a utilitarian craft that can go wherever its competitors can go and beyond.<br><br>

THE DESIGN AND OPTIMIZATION OF A PITCH ELEVATOR AND IT'S EFFECT ON THE OSCILLATION FREQUENCIES OF A MEMBRAPHONE
Sarah Narceille Vaden
Staunton River HS/Roanoke Valley Governor's School, Moneta Virginia, USA

In this project, a pneumatic pitch elevation pedal was designed and implemented on a membraphone and was then tested for oscillation frequencies. The independent variable is the degree of implementation of the pitch elevator. The levels of independent variable were the standard tuned tensions of tensions of 75/1000th, 80/1000th, and 85/1000th, along with the tensions due to elevation from the pneumatic pitch elevation pedal of 80/1000th and 85/1000th of an inch. The dependant variable was the frequency oscillation patterns of the vibrating membrane. If a pneumatic pitch elevation pedal was tested for tension elevation and oscillation frequencies, and compared to standard tuned membranes, the pneumatic pitch elevation pedal would show stronger lower fundamental oscillations and should be able to raise and sustain the elevated membrane tension. <br><br> The membrane was properly tuned to a tension of 75/1000th of an inch. A constant force mechanism was allowed to strike the center of the membrane. A microphone picked up the oscillations and sent it to program LoggerPro to be analyzed by performing a Fast Fourier Transform program. <br><br> The rebound rate, of the second and third peak frequencies, of the membranes with elevated tensions of 85/1000th and 80/1000th of an inch due to implementation of the pneumatic pitch elevation pedal proved to be significantly higher than the respective standard tuned membrane, producing t values of 3.66 and 2.72, and p values of 0.001 and 0.01, respectively. Thus the hypothesis was supported, that the pneumatic pitch elevated membranes showed stronger lower fundamental oscillations.<br><br>

The revolutionary design of the latest generation model of Modiak, the Modiak G2, allows it to outdo its similarly sized competitors, the Klepper AE Scout® and Sea Eagle 380x®, in the areas of weight, compactness, ease of setup, and price. The Modiak G2 can also significantly outdo the Klepper AE Scout®, and compete admirably with the Sea Eagle 380x® in the area of weight capacity. Furthermore, the balance of primary and secondary stability that resulted from the hydrodynamic hull design, makes the Modiak G2 a utilitarian craft that can go wherever its competitors can go and beyond.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF WING ASPECT RATIO AND WING SHAPE ON GLIDER FLIGHT
Kathleen Ann Goertzen
Hattiesburg High School, Hattiesburg, MS, United States

<br><br> Unlike airplanes, gliders lack constant thrust, and therefore rely on design to stay aloft. The forces affecting flight (thrust, drag, lift, and weight) must balance to allow steady flight. The relationship of drag and lift is partly defined by the wings' aspect ratio, the wingspan squared divided by the area. My goal for my project was to demonstrate why gliders usually have wings with high aspect ratios, and how different wing shapes also affect flight.<br><br> I hypothesized that wings having the highest aspect ratio (Condors I, II, III, and IV) would allow the longest flights. I constructed four sets of wings, each set testing a different variable. Each set of five wings had the same five aspect ratios. (Each wing had the same surface area, and was balanced identically on the body.) These provisions allowed me to make direct comparisons between flights of the different sets of wings. I launched each version of this year's glider 20 times outdoors, totaling 300 flights. I noted the length of each flight, averaged these for each wing type, and compared results.<br><br> The glider flew farthest when wings with high aspect ratios were attached, but within boundaries affected by shape. The Eagle, Vulture, and Osprey (listed in order of highest to lowest flight average) flew well, but the Condor and Hawk did not always. I concluded that since high aspect ratios allowed longer flights, this factor is significant in reducing drag and increasing lift, but wings with extremely high aspect ratios may fly poorly.

UP, UP, AND AWAY: A QUANTITATIVE COMPARISON OF ROCKET PROPELLANTS.
Christopher Cody Sheppard
Hedgesville High School, Hedgesville WV, US

The purpose of this project was to determine which propellant produces more thrust: Potassium Nitrate/Dextrose or Potassium Nitrate/Sucrose.<br><br> The procedure was to construct six engines, three Potassium Nitrate/Dextrose and three Potassium Nitrate/Sucrose. I constructed a static test stand to measure the thrust of the engines and recorded the results using a video camera. I then converted PSI to pounds of thrust and constructed a thrust curve and graph. Finally, I compared the results to determine which type of engine produced more thrust.<br><br> Results (Data): PSI lbs. of force Burn Time(sec)<br><br>KNO3/Suc.(1) 78 34.476 33<br><br>KNO3/Suc.(2) 74 32.708 31<br><br>*KNO3/Suc.(3) 65 28.73 29<br><br>KNO3/Dex.(1) 68 30.056 29.5<br><br>KNO3/Dex.(2) 70 30.094 30<br><br>KNO3/Dex.(3) 66 29.172 27.5<br><br>*- Nozzle of engine blew out during testing.<br><br> My conclusion was that Potassium Nitrate/Sucrose produced more thrust because Sucrose is a disaccharide which means it is two monosaccharides convalently linked, whereas Dextrose is a just a simple sugar or a monosaccharide. Basically, I believe the reason the Sucrose propellant produces more thrust is because it has twice the energy in it than what Dextrose does.<br><br> If I were to do the experiment again, I would develop a more accurate way of recording the results from the gauge and possibly use different propellants. I would like to develop a way to record the results electronically in "real time".

BALANCING ROBOT
Matthew Scott Rosoff
Bergen County Academies, Hackensack NJ, United States

The purpose of my robot is to balance itself on two wheels along an axis of free rotation. The robot balances by using two accelerometers, a gyroscope, a Kalman filter and a PID loop. The Kalman filter, PID loop and other motion control routines are executed on an Atmel microcontroller. Sensor bandwidth and error parameters had to be anticipated to make the robot balance with minimal oscillations. The robot maintains a high center of mass and can be modeled as an inverted pendulum with a second order differential equation. Special considerations had to be taken for the non-ideal nature of the accelerometer and the gyroscope. Factors such as noise and gyroscopic drift had to be accounted and compensated for with active filters. Because the gyroscope was not necessarily designed for such slow angular rates, yet had the precision to measure them, an amplifier circuit had to be built. The amplifier circuit also decreased the significance of the ADC’s stair step transfer function. Cost was also a major factor in the design of the robot, and I successfully maintained costs below $100 using the latest Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS).

NANOSTRANDS IN HYBRID COMPOSITES
Lauren Hansen
Wasatch High School, Heber City, Utah, United States

The objective of this research was to determine the effects of nickel nanostrands in creating a greater conductvity in composites made from carbon fibers or nickel-coated carbon fibers. These fibers are usually conductive, but the non-conductive epoxy matrix greatly reduces the conductivity of the overall composite. The nanostrands are able to bridge the space between the fibers in the matrix, creating a fully conductive composite.<br><br> Composite samples were made at a variety of fiber and nanostrand concentrations and then tested using ASTM D2732-97. It was determined that a combination of nanostrands and carbon fibers provide a greater conductivity than could be achieved by either material alone. Nanostrands were also added to the matrixes of carbon fiver composite bars. It was shown that this addition greatly increased the conductivity.<br><br> Practical application of this technology was demonstrated by wrapping a fiberglass tube with a thin layer of the hybrid composite. A small radio was placed in the tube and then rendered silent, showing the tube to be an effective shield to radio waves. The hybrid composite was also coated onto a piece of Kevlar fabric, creating a composite sheet that was bullet proof, stun gun proof, and lightning strike resistant.

TIMING COMPARISON OF EXCESS-3 AND BINARY CODED DECIMAL ADDERS
Joel David Greinke
Lausanne Collegiate School, Memphis, Tennessee, United States

The purpose of this experiment is to create four-digit adders for Excess-3 and BCD encoding methods in order to compare response time for each one. This is extremely relevant in today’s world as nearly all of the world’s businesses rely on computers for many functions. When comparing time use for different codes, there is usually only a difference on nanoseconds, yet with thousands of calculations being performed per second, this can add up quickly. Using the Quartus II simulation software downloaded off the Altera website (www.altera.com), logic circuits were created that could add four-digit Excess-3 and BCD numbers. Once compiled, a report was produced that gave response times and the bits that were changed to cause these. The data shows that the BCD adder had a faster minimum time, but the Excess-3 adder had a faster maximum time. This is probably because when there, is no carry the BCD adder has to go through fewer steps to get the right answer, whereas if there is a carry, the Excess-3 adder has to complete fewer steps. A way to make this experiment better and more useful would be to add more forms of code for comparison purposes.

COMPUTATIONAL THERMODYNAMICS AND KINETICS
Kimberly Jo Larrabee
Reading High School, Reading PA, United States

Magnesium is a metal with high strength to weight ratio. The applications for magnesium are often limited by its tendency to deform under pressure (creep). This investigation was conducted as part of a larger effort to characterize magnesium alloys and identify a composition, which could be resistant to creep. Computational thermodynamics can generate phase diagrams using basic thermodynamic properties of metals. A Computational thermodynamic analysis of magnesium, calcium, and zinc predicts the existence of a new phase. A phase in the solid state is a different crystalline structure. The thermodynamic calculations predict the new phase will have a lower free energy than the elements. The change in free energy provides the driving force to change elements into alloys. The new alloy was produced using diffusion. Kinetics is concerned with the rates of change in the concentrations of the reacting metals. Reactants at higher temperature have more kinetic energy, which should cause the reaction to proceed faster. The metals were placed in furnaces at three different temperatures for nine days. Diffusion occurred in the furnace. Optical microscopy was used to characterize the diffusion.

SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF TUNGSTEN OXIDE NANOWIRES AND THEIR CONVERSION TO TUNGSTEN SULFIDE NANOTUBES
Aitor Maiz
The Catlin Gabel School, Portland, Oregon, USA

Due to their high aspect ratio and small diameter, carbon nanotubes have been investigated as the electron sources for flat panel displays and electron microscopes. Since WS2 nanotubes have similar morphology and internal structures to carbon nanotubes, the investigation of electron field emission properties of WS2 nanotubes will allow us to explore new candidates of tubular emitters and improve the understanding of the electron field emission mechanism of nanotubes. Synthesizing the WS2 nanotubes requires a difficult conversion from tungsten oxide nanowire precursors that will fail unless all of the parameters are met exactly. Although WS2 nanotubes have been synthesized from tungsten oxide nanowire precursors using hydrogen sulfide gas (H2S), in my experiments, I have developed a method that does not use corrosive and toxic H2S gas, but instead uses plain hydrogen gas (H2) in combination with solid sulfur to perform the conversion from tungsten oxide nanowires to WS2 nanotubes. Using field emission high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) and field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), I have studied effects of growth parameters (such as, ratio of argon and hydrogen, flow rate, and temperature) on the morphologies and internal structures of WS2 nanotubes.

EFFICIENCY OF DIFFERENT BRIDGE DESIGNS
Justin Michael Secrist
Keyser High School, Keyser WV, United States

The purpose of my project was to determine if a triangular shape, in the architectural design of a truss bridge, affects its overall performance.<br><br> I constructed the new material tester which distributed an equal amount of force into the new 15 bridges, and determined the maximum capacity held by each model. I built 3 models of each design. Design A: Large triangular shapes, Design B: Vertical braces and large triangular shapes, Design C: Vertical braces, Design D: Small and large triangular shapes and vertical braces, and Design E: Small and large triangular shapes. I established the mass of each model, made sure each bridge was level, and then tested each model for its maximum capacity. Next, took the maximum capacity, and divided it by its mass determining the efficiency factor. Finally, I found the average for each design.<br><br> The efficiency for Design D and E was close; with Design D: 621, and Design B: 676. Results for Design B and A was similar with Design B: 585, and Design A: 396. The efficiency for Design C was low with 292.<br><br> My hypothesis proved to be incorrect, although the results were fairly close, bridge Design E was the most efficient design. The efficiency for Design C was low compared to the designs that used triangular structures, proving that the triangular shape affects a bridge’s overall performance. I determined that bridges can become more efficient by using triangular structures in their design. My project proves that triangles are a strong structural shape.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF TRANSESTERIFICATION CATALYST BASE STRENGTH ON BIODIESEL PRODUCTION
Anmar Lou DeJoya Siochi
Warwick High School, Newport News Vriginia, United States

Biodiesel is an alternative fuel gaining interest in the United States as a petroleum fuel substitute. It is derived from vegetable oils and animal fats. It is a renewable resource because the oil from plants can be harvested annually and the animals that consume the plant oils generate more animal fats. Biodiesel is biodegradable, non-toxic and environmentally friendly. The favored method for industrial production of biodiesel is base catalyzed transesterification of fatty acids into alkyl esters.<br><br>The goal of this experiment was to study the effect of the transesterification base catalyst strength on biodiesel production. The base catalysts used in this experiment were sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), calcium hydroxide Ca(OH)2, and aluminum hydroxide Al(OH)3. They are listed in the order of base strength, with NaOH and KOH being the strongest bases. The density, viscosity, yield and energy output of the biodiesels produced by transesterification of soybean oil catalyzed by the above bases were measured and compared to commercial B100 biodiesel used as the control. The results showed that the strongest bases, NaOH and KOH, were the best catalysts because they produced the most yield and highest quality biodiesel as shown by viscosities, densities and energy outputs closely matching those of commercial biodiesel. Although NaOH was the cheaper of the two bases, fewer washes were required to remove the soap by-product when KOH was used. For a biodiesel production plant, the cost of additional washing steps may offset the lower initial cost of using NaOH as the base catalyst.<br><br>

INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF THE BIOCOMPATIBILITY OF HT/HP CO/CR/NB/C PHASES
Richard Winston Larson
Provo High School, Provo, UT, USA

Modern hip implants have several wear problems, such as particulate debris, which sometimes result in the need for revision surgery. A diamond hip implant would solve most of the problems current implants are having. In one implant being developed, niobium and diamond are set in intimate contact with an F-75 ball. This assemblage is put through an HT/HP process and a result of this process is a reaction zone. This project analyzed the new phases formed in the reaction zone, the microstructure of the reaction zone, and the biocompatibility of the reaction zone. It was observed that the microstructure was complicated and that five new phases were formed. Elution and electro-corrosion studies were performed to determine the biocompatibility of the reaction zone. High initial Co ion concentrations and the lack of a passive region in electro-corrosion suggest that this is not a good biomaterial.

REGULATED CRYSTAL GROWTH: A BIOMIMETIC APPROACH TO MATERIALS SYNTHESIS
Thomas Henry Huynh
Boston Latin Academy, Boston Massachusetts, United States

Templated mineralization is a major mechanism for the formation of biominerals by organisms and is suggested to play a role in amelogenisis. The Fd virus is a well-characterized, rod-like inovirus that possess the ability to aggregate in solution. This project was designed to investigate the templating properties of the Fd virus. The first step was to determine the effects of ions on the aggregation and alignment of the viral rods. The greater the aggregation and alignment, the better the virions would serve as a template for calcium phosphate crystal nucleation and growth. The viral rod aggregates became more aligned with the introduction of calcium ions. Samples for the ion interaction experiments were prepared by pre-incubating the virus both in ammonium phosphate and in calcium chloride. The alignment of the virions was confirmed by Transmission Electron Microscopy analysis.<br><br> The second step was to use the aggregated Fd virus as a template for the mineralization of calcium phosphate materials. Mineralization experiments consisted of mixing counter ions to the pre-incubated virus aggregates. The final concentration of calcium was 2.5mM and 1.5mM for phosphate. The calcium phosphate crystals prepared with the aligned Fd virus templates are significantly more organized than the crystals grown in the absence of the virus. This suggests a role for the biological materials (virus) in influencing mineralization process. This study expands our understanding of basic mechanisms of teeth and bone formation and opens new avenues for the further understanding and production of bioinspired nanostructured materials for hard tissue repair.

PREVENTING DEGRADATION IN PROTON EXCHANGE MEMBRANE FUEL CELLS: A NOVEL, MULTI-CARTRIDGE AIR CONTAMINANT CONTROL SYSTEM
Jonathan Brandon Burke Cross
James W. Robinson, Jr. Secondary School, Fairfax, Virginia, USA

Fuel cells have been widely researched as replacements for internal combustion engines. Existing research has focused almost exclusively on effects and mitigation of impurities in the hydrogen fuel – with virtually none on effects of pollutants on the oxygen side, and even less on effective means of mitigating them. <br><br> This multi-faceted investigation began with comprehensive literature surveys to identify pollutants in civilian/military environments that impact PEMFC performance. Of 15 chemicals accounting for 99.9% of pollution, effects of 3 were unknown. Of these three, 11 tests verified that only acetone is of concern. Various HEPA filters, activated carbons, molecular sieves, and desiccants were evaluated to identify filtration materials optimized to the target pollutants. Twenty tests showed that HEPA was up to 50% effective; Carulite/desiccant, from 12-45%; and activated carbons, from 5-41%. <br><br> Four Contaminant Control Systems (CCS) were developed – based on modular concepts using layer, disk, “bubble”, or tubular cartridges. Over 75 tests on gas/diesel exhausts demonstrated system effectiveness in reducing PEMFC degradation, from 66-91% using Layer Cartridges, to 100-115% using a Tubular Cartridges -- a significant advancement over the 0-59% achieved by fuel cell filters in commercial markets. <br><br> This investigation is significant because it represents the first comprehensive summary of military battlefield pollutants, and has shown that an optimized cartridge-based filtration system can totally eliminate the effects of pollutants on PEMFC. The CCS can be easily reconfigured, allow depleted modules to be replaced without discarding the entire filter, and reduce costs. Commercial/military fuel cells are now one step closer to reality.

SEISMIC SURVIVAL
Julie R. Smetana
Mohall High School, Lansford, North Dakota, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine what type of structural design would best withstand the forces and pressures produced by three different types of seismic waves emitted by an earthquake.<br><br>I hypothesized that the building reinforced with cross-bracing and a base isolator will be able to stand the most strain and force emitted by my earthquake simulator.<br><br>I constructed a model earthquake simulator, commonly called a shaker table, out of a plywood board and a wooden frame. The board and frame were attached to each other with rubber bands. I then built twelve buildings; 3 with a simple frame on a regular foundation, 3 with cross-bracing for support on a regular foundation, 3 with a simple frame on a base isolator, and 3 with cross-bracing on a base isolator. I tested the buildings on my shaker table to see how they would perform. I was able to simulate Raleigh Waves, Shear Waves, and Love Waves by pulling the plywood board down in a certain manner and letting go. I measured how far down I had to pull the board before the building obtained serious structural damage.<br><br>The results I recorded indicated that the building with both cross-bracing and a base isolator tolerated the most seismic force before sustaining structural damage. The building with a simple frame and regular foundation tolerated the least amount of seismic force, and showed much more significant structural damage in all three tests. These results confirm my hypothesis as being correct. From these results I was able to conclude that a building with interior fortifications such as cross-bracing and a base isolator would withstand the forces of an earthquake better than a simple, more common building.<br><br>

BIODIESEL: FUEL OF THE FUTURE? PHASE V
Joshua James Chilson
Florence High School, Florence South Dakota, United States

The problems involved in this project were to find and lower the cloud point of various blends of biodiesel and identify benefits of blends using higher percentages of biodiesel. The student researcher hypothesized that biodiesel will have a higher cloud point than regular diesel and that additives will help to lower the cloud point of biodiesel.<br><br> The student researcher acquired 100% biodiesel and a 50/50 blend of regular diesel from a service station for testing. The two fuels were blended by pouring specific amounts of biodiesel into the proper amount of regular diesel fuel and then agitating the blend. Initial temperature and light absorption tests were conducted using a temperature probe and a colorimeter. Finding the cloud point of each blend involved lowering the temperature until wax crystals formed. This indicated the cloud point of each blend. Next a cold flow test was performed with a fuel filter system pressure tester. Temperature tests were also conducted with anti-gelling additives added to each blend. The student researcher performed quality tests including cetane, lubricity, and a cold flow test on the blends to find the effects of the additive. This also compared the quality of biodiesel versus regular diesel. <br><br> Based on his tests, the student researcher concluded that biodiesel has a higher cloud point than regular diesel and the cloud point is lowered by blending biodiesel with regular diesel. Anti-gelling additives also lower biodiesel blends’ cloud points. Biodiesel performed better in all of the quality tests than regular diesel fuel. <br><br>

ROBOTICS EQUIPPED WITH COLOR VISION
Levi Bradley Kingery
Edinburg High School, Edinburg, North Dakota, USA

The plan was to build a robot that can search an area for a colored golf ball and go pick it up.<br><br> The robot was built using only interlocking plastic bricks. An adder-subtractor mechanism was constructed; it uses one motor to generate total motion and another motor to control steering. Several wheel combinations were tried with a short, wide wheel base working the best for the skid steer. It was equipped with an arm like a front-end loader that would pick up the ball.<br><br> For the robot to see, a specialized digital camera was attached. This would detect the color of the ball so the robot could react. <br><br> The last component added was a micro-computer that controls the motors after being programmed.<br><br> Then the robot was programmed using software from the camera manufacturer. This is how the robot is told to search for, find, and retrieve the ball.<br><br> Preliminary testing occurred on a small piece of particle board (60 x 90 cm) and a larger piece of plywood (90 x 240 cm). Later, more accurate testing was done on a tile floor. The ball was placed at eight locations, in 45 degree intervals, around the origin. For the first time around, the ball was placed 30 cm from the origin, and the second time, 50 cm. <br><br> Out of sixteen different locations, the robot ran into the ball before it entered the robot’s vision at three locations. Search times were longer for larger angles. <br><br>

EXTRACTING MELODY FROM MIDI FILES
Benjamin Min-Jia Chang
Sewanhaka High School, Elmont, New York, USA

The purpose of this project is threefold: to provide ground truth data for melody extraction of MP3 files, to act as a stand-alone factor in query-by-humming systems, and to create small databases of music that can be searched quickly.<br><br> I propose an addition to all query-by-humming systems that extracts melody by selecting one individual track out of a complex MIDI file. A 20 track pop music database will be used. The one individual melody track will be selected based on the number of high-pitched note events present on the track in comparison to the other tracks. Also, tracks will be eliminated before the algorithm runs if they are on Track 10, the standard track for percussion, or if they contain less than 45% of the note events in comparison to the other tracks. The final track will have note events spanning 45% to 100% of the music file, and contain more high-pitched notes in total throughout that track in comparison to the other tracks. This track will be the melody.<br><br> Results of the project indicate that melody extraction based on this definition of melody have only an 80% success rate – which is not sufficient as ground truth melody data for MP3 melody extraction. The error present is not in the algorithm but rather in the entire definition of melody itself. The definition of melody as the track with the highest pitched notes is too broad of a generalization.<br><br>

CRYSTAL RADIO
Jorge Giraldo
Tappen High School, Tappen, ND, USA

I wanted to build a radio because of my interest in how radio’s works. In<br><br>my research of different types of radios I found this simple crystal radio project more interesting because of the few parts it needs, and it can be built in a short time out of things you can find around the house.<br><br>I believe that this radio will work.<br><br>The crystal radio uses only a few parts, and needs no batteries or other power sources. The radio uses the energy of radio waves sent by radio transmitters. However, because they are usually far away, and we have a few hundred feet of wire for an antenna, the amount of energy we receive is measured in billionths of a watt. The human ear can detect sounds that are less than a millionth of even that and because of the sensitivity to sound, we should be able to hear the faintest sound of the radio wave.<br><br>First I used about 50 ft of stranded wire for an antenna and normal headphones. I didn’t get any sound. After using a TV antenna, I could hear some noise. I found out that the location where I was testing didn’t have a good signal that even the local television and some local radio stations do not come in very good. Then I tested closer to a local radio station, used a better antenna, changed the normal headphones to a more sensitive earpiece, I finally got sound from a radio station.<br><br>

STRESSED OUT!
Keri Elizabeth Hernandez
Ellendale Public School, Ellendale, North Dakota, USA

The purpose of my experiment is to test different airplane window shapes and determine which shape produces the least amount of stress through the process of photoelasticity.<br><br> My hypothesis is that the circular airplane window shape will produce the least amount of stress when tested with the 3-kg weight.<br><br> Cut and assemble all but one side of the frame of the polariscope as specified in the materials list, diagram, and procedure steps. Line the top and bottom of the inside of the polariscope with felt, creating two slits on each side of the gap, with the first slit distanced 5cm, and the second distanced 10cm. Insert the polaroids into the outer slits, one on each side of the gap. Insert the 1/4 wave plates into the remaining slits, one in each. Connect the remaining side of the polariscope with the 1-inch hinges. On each of the six pieces of Lexon plastic, drill a 32 bit hole 2.5cm in from one end (centered), and 5.5cm in from the other end (centered). Cut out the following shapes, one each piece: elliptical, circle, square, triangle, rectangle, and diamond. Cut them so they are centered when looking through the polariscope. Drill a 32 bit hole in the same location on each of the wooden blocks listed in the instructions. Test each of the six shapes in the polariscope (see procedure and diagram for details) and photograph the unstressed and stressed versions for comparison.<br><br> The elliptical shape was shown to have a total fringe count of 2. This shape is followed by the circle, triangle, diamond, rectangle, and square. These results were derived from comparing fringe count, stress concentration, and stress distribution.<br><br> From this, I conclude that my hypothesis was incorrect. The elliptical airplane window shape produced the least amount of stress.<br><br>

CAN A FUEL CELL FLY?
Cynthia Susan Spahn
W.T. Woodson High School, Fairfax Virginia, United States of America

The purpose of this experiment was to determine if it is feasible to construct a PEM fuel cell that could power a model airplane. Experiments were conducted to determine the effects of running the fuel cell off of air in comparison with pure oxygen. Following these experiments a fuel cell was designed with a weight of 4.27oz and a power output of 3.47W. With this weight and power output it is feasible that a model plane could fly, powered by this fuel cell.<br><br> The first tests were designed to account for the conditions the gas would be used under in the air. It was determined that the effect on the efficiency using air was not substantial enough to outweigh the problems caused by supplying the fuel cell with pure oxygen while flying. A fuel cell was then designed that replaced the usually heavy endplates of a fuel cell with thin aluminum. Leaving the ends open with the exception of the hydrogen container solved the plaguing problems of water accumulation and airflow.<br><br>

INNOVATIONS IN PROSTHETICS FOR COMPLETE AND PARTIAL PHALANGES APPROXIMATION OF COMPLEX ARCS AND SIMULATION OF HUMAN MOVEMENT IN ENGINEERING
Brandon Joseph Peart
Hillcrest High School, Midvale UT, United States of America

Due to either accident or birth defect, many individuals require the use of an operational or cosmetic prosthesis in order to compensate for disabilities, minimize social consequences, and improve self-image. Phalangeal prosthetics is presently restricted to either operational or cosmetic supplementation, owing that balancing these two elements is problematic. The pursuit of this prosthesis is partitioned into two phases; the creation of a joint that maintains integrity, resembles relative dimensions of and simulates the behaviour of a phalanx; and the application and modification of the joint to convert it into a prosthesis.<br><br> The joint was developed following the design cycle. Summarily, this consists of; recognizing a problem or need, brainstorming to accumulate potential solutions, developing a solution, producing the solution, testing the potential solution through the scientific method, and determining problems with the chosen solution. Using materials selected from the material matrix, mathematical models, CAD systems, wood working machinery, and metal fabrication as dictated by the design briefs and experiment logs, several builds of a functional prototype of the joint were constructed and tested. The structure operates as a hybrid suspension and cantilever structure with controlled, variable discrepancies in the support strands lengths. Analytic, empirical, and observational data from experimentation encouraged reformation of the strand organization to better imitate the movement of human phalanges.<br><br> The current build accomplishes the primary design brief. As reconsiderations and revisions are integral to the innovative process, the joint is prepared for further development, application of an electronic control module, and conversion to a prosthesis.<br><br>

IRIS RECOGNITION FOR INDIVIDUAL IDENTIFICATION
Nina Maria Huffman
Langley High School, McLean, VA, USA

The purpose of this project was to create an accurate iris recognition system inexpensive enough for widespread personal use. I constructed a prototype system by combining the CCD camera from an inexpensive web cam with a 35mm camera lens placed inside a box between two light sources behind a diffuser to provide uniform illumination. The light sources and camera lens were behind a glass window and circular polarizer to minimize reflections. A small wire frame square hangs centered in front of the camera while a larger one resides on the surface of the system. The subject positions himself so that the squares appear to be aligned and the same size. If done correctly, the subject’s iris should be at the focus distance of the camera and approximately in the center of the image. I collected five 16-frame video clips of one eye from each of 99 subjects. I developed and implemented iris recognition algorithms using Matlab. The algorithms convert the images to black and white, register and average the 16 video frames to reduce noise, and enhance the image to bring out the patterns in the iris. The iris is then located using Hough transforms to find the iris, pupil, and eyelids, and is extracted from within these boundaries. Next, the iris is converted to normalized polar coordinates to account for variation in iris size and rotation between images. A test statistic based on circular-convolution is computed and compared to a threshold to decide if two images are from the same subject. I wrote a data-reduction program that compared all possible pairs of images and calculated the probabilities of correct acceptance and incorrect acceptance. The results showed a crossover rate of 1:15, which is high for a practical system. I found that the errors resulted from images that were out of focus or had low contrast. Performance could be improved by increasing the illumination to improve contrast, by adding an auto-focus capability, and by using a camera with better resolution to produce higher quality images.

DISTILLATION: HARNESSING THE SUN TO SAVE LIVES
Glenn Michael Wade
Valley High School, Hoople, ND, USA

The purpose of this project was to develop a solar distillation device efficient enough to maintain a stranded airline passenger’s life. First, the type of solar energy that would be used had to be determined. Then the designs for the distillers and the condensers had to be developed. All the tanks were then built and tested for leaks. After sealing all leaks, they were then painted with the design colors. The tanks were then tested with all possible combinations of distillers and condensers with both a 25 percent fill and 50 percent fill of the distillers. Also, distiller number 2 was tested for the production of pure water based on the type of backing used. The distillers were filled with a salt water solution to simulate the type of water that would be used in the ocean. In order to test the distillers, they were placed in the floatation devices, and placed under a 250 watt infrared heating lamp. The condensers were attached with a two foot long, half inch thick clear tubing to the designed locations and placed into the cooling tank. The cooling tank was used to simulate the ocean and how it would cool the condensers. The combinations were tested every thirty minutes until two hours passed and then the totals were taken. Each combination was tested twice and then averaged.<br><br> Conclusions: The best combination was distiller number 2 with an aluminum backing, filled 50 percent, and attached to condenser number 2. <br><br>

THE LIFT ASSIST
Blake LaWayne Price
Happy High School, Happy Texas, USA

A geriatric help device, the Lift Assist, was designed and tested on both able bodied and elderly people with a certified EMT present. The device is designed to help an elderly person safely rise from a seated position. It is cost effective and was designed with ergonomics, durability, usability, serviceability, and cost in mind. The device was tested on able bodied people to ensure it’s safety prior to testing on the elderly. Elderly people testing the device were timed rising from a chair without the aid of the device and while using the device. On average, the time required to rise from the sitting position for people over age 65 was cut by 51%. A student t - test showed that the reduction in time was significant. Elderly individuals testing the device gave it an overall rating of 4.4 on a 1-5 scale, indicating that they felt the device was suitable for people in their age group. The Lift Assist is far cheaper than a conventional lift chair, which ranges from $500 - $1700.

A CLEAN BREAK A POLYCARBONATE-CLAY NANOCOMPOSITE AS A GLASS SUBSTITUTE
Blake Allen Campbell
Stevens High School, Rapid City, SD, USA

Glass has always been prized for its transparency in windows, but when broken, creates sharp shards capable of causing injury or death. The goal of this project was to create a polycarbonate-clay nanocomposite possessing equivalent transparency of polycarbonate, but having increased rigidity suitable for replacing vehicular windows. Variables studied included percent clay, mixing temperature and time. Controls were established by heating and mixing pure polycarbonate at the selected temperatures.<br><br> Mixing temperatures studied (200ºC, 210ºC and 220ºC) had little effect on the transparency of the nanocomposites. Conversely, the transparency of the pure polycarbonate controls decreased with increasing temperature. The data suggests that 15 or 30 minute mixing-time resulted in a more transparent nanocomposite than a mixing time of 7.5 minutes. There is a trend which indicates that 0.5% clay content is more transparent than 1.0% or 2.0%. Surprisingly, visual spectrometry indicated that the nanocomposites have greater transparency than the pure polycarbonate controls. <br><br> The nanocomposites absorbed more ultraviolet light than pure polycarbonate. This raises some interesting application possibilities in windows.<br><br> There was a significant increase (P value = 0.029) in yield strength of all polycarbonate-clay nanocomposites compared to the pure polycarbonate controls. The P value approaches significance (P value = 0.055) when comparing rigidity between the two groups.<br><br> A highly significant (P value = 0.000) difference exists in the thickness of compressed films made from pure polycarbonate versus the nanocomposites. The increased thickness of film made from the nanocomposites indicates a greater resistance to flow. This may provide a correlation to strength. <br><br>

COMMUNAL APTITUDE EVOLUTION SYSTEM FOR AUTONOMOUS ROBOTS CAESAR
Jessica Lauren Malone
Berea High School, Berea Ohio, United States of America

Distributed intelligence in robotics is an area that has tremendous potential to yield many benefits. Robots with the ability to autonomously communicate with each other to share data and analytical tasks would exponentially increase robotic performance and deployment efficiency.<br><br> This project researched the area of communal aptitude evolution for autonomous robots. Communal aptitude evolution combines distributed intelligence with autonomous robotic communications to create an environment for robots to function as one intelligent entity. Three separate autonomous robots with the ability to wirelessly communicate and share analytical tasks, data, and experiences were developed. Each robot has stereovision system, speech synthesis, and wireless communications capabilities. To facilitate the experiments, the robots share a common set of basic mechanical and analytical functionality as well as a common communication protocol.<br><br> Data was collected using a micro-controller/PC based monitoring system that monitors and saves all communication between robots for analysis and real time display. A voice activated control system was used for real time control and communications with the robots.<br><br> Each robot was trained to identify separate sets of images and colors using an Artificial Neural Network based vision system. The experiments successfully demonstrated that each robot had the benefit of the collective knowledge of all three robots. It was successfully demonstrated that as individual robots develop, the entire community of robots realizes the benefits automatically. <br><br> The research results proved that communal aptitude evolution for autonomous robots is a concept that can be utilized for tremendous benefits as we expand our use of robots. <br><br>

UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE: DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION, AND FLIGHT OPTIMIZATION
Stephen Joseph Carlson
American Fork Highschool, American Fork, Utah, United States of America

The motivation behind my project was to create a portable, easy-to-fly, unmanned aerial vehicle capable of carrying electronic payloads, such as video surveillance equipment. This was a 2nd year project in which I made significant steps and advances over my former project. Advancements over the previous year's project included an auto-stabilization system and a totally new aircraft design that could be collapsed for transport.<br><br> As the autopilot and aircraft development processes required the use of different disciplines of engineering, this project came to be from essentially two projects: Aerodynamic and Mechanical Engineering for design of the vehicle, while Electrical and Computer Engineering were required for the autopilot. Implementing such disciplines required interaction with students and professors in their respective fields of engineering.<br><br> The ultimate result of the project was a vehicle capable of flying for a suitable amount of time and carrying payloads, such as wireless and digital camera systems. The vehicle also met the criteria for being collapsible and user friendly. The autopilot evolved to become an attitude and altitude stabilization system. However, the ability to follow GPS waypoints and other autonomous parameters are quickly becoming feasible.<br><br>

AN ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT BUILDING CONFIGURATIONS ON WIND TURBINE EFFICIENCY
Logan Mark Skelley
Joplin High School Joplin, Missouri USA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effect of different urban terrains, comprised of four different building configurations (control with no buildings, parallel building configuration, angled building configuration, and random building configuration), on the efficiency of a wind-driven turbine. It was hypothesized that the wind turbine would be most efficient in the angled building configuration, because of the turbulence and drafts created, than in the other three building models. To test this hypothesis, a wind tunnel was built and the four different urban terrain models were studied at airflow speeds of 10, 20, and 40 kph. A digital photo-tachometer (R-1620C) allowed determination of the revolutions per minute of the turbine propeller in the differing wind speeds and with the four different urban terrain models. The results obtained did not support the hypothesis that the wind turbine would be most efficient in the angled building configuration; however, the results did reveal that the parallel building configuration was the least obstructive to air flow. Based on the results obtained, the parallel building configuration would provide the best setting for wind turbine placement in an urban environment. The study suggests that the placement of wind turbines in urban settings could be both practical and efficient.

NEWTON VS. BERNOULLI: WHO CAN LIFT IT? AN ANALYSIS OF THE COMPONENTS OF LIFT
Flannery Elizabeth Woodward
Beaufort High School, Beaufort, SC, USA

The purpose of this science experiment was to determine whether Newton’s 3rd Law or Bernoulli’s Principle attributes more to the total lift created by airfoils with different performance characteristics. I formed the hypothesis that for higher performance airfoils Newton’s 3rd Law would attribute more to the lift created than Bernoulli’s Principle, and for lower performance airfoils Bernoulli’s Principle would attribute more to the lift created than Newton’s 3rd Law. I tested this hypothesis by constructing five airfoil sections: NACA 0012 high performance airfoil, NACA 2412 lower performance airfoil, flat 0000, upper chord of the 0012, and lower chord of the 0012. I was given access to a wind tunnel that could be used at home. I calibrated force probes to translate volts into ounces of lift and drag. I used a Pitot tube to measure airspeed in the wind tunnel. First, I recorded the airspeed in clear air to make sure that it would remain constant. Then, I recorded airspeed above and below the airfoil sections. Finally, I recorded the lift and drag being created. My results showed that Newton’s 3rd Law did not attribute more to lift in higher performance airfoils. Bernoulli’s Principle only attributed more to lift than Newton’s 3rd Law at 0deg. angle of attack in lower performance airfoils. At a 5deg. angle of attack, Newton’s 3rd Law accounted for more of the lift. These results were different from my hypothesis, but they were accurate and they make sense upon further examination and allowance for error.

DIMINISHING STRUCTURAL STRESS OF ROLLER COASTERS
Bethany Ann Vitaris
Massachusetts Academy of Mathematics and Science, Worcester, MA, USA

The purpose of this research was to determine the shape of roller coaster supports that would result in the least amount of structural strain and to conclude if there was an advantage to adding support cables to the structure in an attempt to further reduce structural strain.<br><br> I designed a steel roller coaster structure with three interchangeable support columns of varying shapes and gauges of steel. Each set of supports included metal eyelets where wire cabling could be added and all six columns were equipped with strain gauges. A coaster car was fashioned and a series of tests were set up to measure the strain on the structure as the car completed its run. The tests were then repeated after the addition of cables to the supports. Wheatstone bridges and logger equipment were used to measure the amount of strain encountered by the structure at the two chosen test locations.<br><br> After 240 separate runs, test data clearly showed that the round supports were the most structurally sound, resulting in the least amount of measurable structural strain. The addition of support cables further reduced the structural strain. <br><br>

AUTONOMOUS ROBOTIC ARM WITH NETWORK CAPABILITIES: A DEPENDABLE CRANE AND MOBILE CONSTRUCTION SYSTEM.
Jennifer Lee Worley
Keyser High School, Keyser, WV, USA

The Purpose of my project is to develop a self-contained Robotic Arm that can function as a construction crane. To achieve this, minimal external hook-ups and placement of the central processing unit in the arm were the center of its development. This would enable the crane to operate alone or in unison with other equipment constructing manned or unmanned structures.<br><br> A crane with a hand or gripper on each end was essential. This configuration will allow the arm to attach itself to a rover or structure. The only external connection is to obtain power and that is accomplished through the gripper.<br><br> Embedding magnets in the objects to be gripped allowed the arm to orientate itself for proper alignment with the use of hall-effect sensors. Power needed to be cut from the working grippers to prevent short circuits. This was accomplished with solid state relays.<br><br> A 40kHz Infrared Remote-Control Receiver Module and a television remote control unit, simulated wireless networking. A Flex Sensor was placed on each joint. Monitoring the change in resistance prevented overextension of the arm.<br><br> Force Sensing Resistors placed in the grippers controlled gripping energy. A Digital Thermometer/Thermostat monitored the temperature for proper operation. An Ultrasonic Range Finder provided the ability to detect objects.<br><br> Once a reliable method of arm orientation was realized, applications became unlimited. Placing the computer in the arm and only requiring an external power hook-up enabled the arm to function alone or in unison with other equipment.<br><br>

ACCELERATED ANGULAR SCANNING IN HOLOGRAPHIC DATA STORAGE
Philip Alejandro Muñoz
School of Science and Technology, Beaverton OR, US

Holographic memory presents a range of opportunities for the future of data storage. Its greatest strength is its immense capacity, which can exceed 50 TB on a 5¼” disk. The chief contributor to the high capacity lies in the multitude of multiplexing techniques, whereby several pages of data can be stored on the same location. Perhaps the most robust of these techniques is angular multiplexing, where the angle of entry distinguishes the separate holograms. Unfortunately, current angular scanning systems are large and cumbersome. My goal is to design a system that can scan very rapidly through a range of angles.<br><br> To achieve this, I used a specially modified reference beam to scan the data. By expanding and then focusing this beam with lenses, the cylindrical beam becomes a cone. By obscuring the majority of the beam with a rotating disc, the beam scans through the range of entry angles once every complete revolution.<br><br> To assess the effectiveness of this system, a holographic plate is prepared. A pair of arbitrary data pages is recorded at a single point with different reference angles. This point is illuminated by the modified reference beam, and the emergent beam is analyzed as a superposition of the two original data pages.<br><br> Projections of scanning algorithms and data rates have been explored. This technique is expected to yield a retrieval rate of up to 126 times today’s standard, while requiring one fewer degree of control. Additional testing will explore possible applications to optical processors.<br><br>

THE NAUTICAL RAMJET- AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO TORPEDO PROPULSION
Jason Arel Strauss
North Shore Hebrew Academy High School, Great Neck, NY, USA

Ramjet and Scramjet technology offer the capacity for higher speed. The aerospace ramjet is a decades-old concept dating from the early 1900’s. A more unfamiliar form of ramjet propulsion is the nautical ramjet. Surrounding water enters the diffuser which converts its energy into pressure. At the mixing chamber, gas bubbles are injected. A converging nozzle reconverts pressure to velocity, and the bubbles add to the speed. Increased flow velocity at the nozzle exit is the basis of the ramjet’s thrust.<br><br> The goal of this project was to calculate the feasibility of a ramjet-propelled torpedo with a liquefied gas supply. The project included three distinct phases: the ramjet tow pool, Matlab program editing, and the theoretical torpedo design. <br><br> Ramjet tow experiment readings were in accord with ramjet theory. After 27 trials of the Matlab program, optimal torpedo design revealed the following data:<br><br>D nozzle m air flow Range U a F Thrust Efficiency*<br><br>0.218 m 1.6 kg/s 10.8 km 30 m/s 6700 N 61.11%<br><br>*compared to adiabatic compression<br><br> According to the Matlab simulation, the torpedo should produce enough thrust to overcome drag and maintain a speed of 30 m/s with a payload of 150 kg. Finally a 3D modeling program (SolidWorks) was used to visualize the torpedo’s proportions. The ramjet torpedo computer model runs at 60 Knots (30 m/s), with a range and payload comparable to existing modern torpedoes, which run at 40 Knots (20 m/s). <br><br> In summary, this project has proven the nautical ramjet to be a useful form of propulsion with a place reserved in the future of maritime propulsion. <br><br>

DEVELOPMENT OF A NON-PRESTRAINED DIELECTRIC ELASTOMER ACTUATOR
Rupak Chakraborty
L.V. Hightower High School, Missouri City, TX, USA

Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs), also known as ‘artificial muscles’, are flexible materials that deform in the presence of an electric field. While DEAs have many benefits over other actuators, current configurations require DEA ‘prestraining’ to increase actuator strength. Prestraining, or the stretching of the elastomer over a rigid frame, reduces the actuator’s flexibility and overall substantiality. In addition, the induced stress relaxation caused by prestrain is severely detrimental to actuator lifetime. <br><br> It has been suggested that prestraining may bias the orientation of the polymer backbones in the elastomer such that the chains tend to lie perpendicular to the applied electric field, and that the chains might be more resistant to breakdown in this orientation. This research proposes an alternative method, compression molding, to induce a net planar molecular orientation in the elastomer during the manufacturing process. <br><br> Silicone elastomer films of 50µm thickness were compression molded between hot platens (150°C) and room temperature platens (23°C) under high shear flow. After molding and post-curing, a voltage ramp was used to measure dielectric strength in 72 samples, each 1cm in diameter. Breakdown strengths ranged from 16 to 183 V/µm. Although the two methods yielded dielectric films with comparable breakdown strengths, dielectrics manufactured through compression molding showed an overall three-fold improvement over prestrained elastomers. Because compression molding potentially eliminates the need for prestraining, compression-molded DEAs could be feasible for applications which demand a high degree of flexibility.<br><br>

RUN SILENT, RUN SMOOTH: THE EFFECT OF NOSE SECTION GEOMETRY ON ENERGY LOST TO DRAG
Joshua Jarrett Feingold
John Handley HS, Winchester VA, USA

This research was aimed at discovering which geometry for the nose section of a submersible composed of simple shapes (i.e., ellipses, cylinders, and cones) - as opposed to full-hull teardrop geometry - is ideal. To examine this, I designed two test apparatuses - the second after the first yielded unsatisfactory results - which allowed me to determine which of the noses caused the least drag, with hull and tail remaining as constants. The two versions of the test yielded different results. The second, improved version showed that the longest elliptical form (major axis = 4 x minor axis) lost the least energy to drag. From this the only logical conclusion is that, for this case, a greatlly elongated nose section is preferable to a hemispherical or shorter one. However, these results seemed somewhat questionable due to imperfections in test procedures, and I am currently developing a third test method and appartatus to eliminate this error.

TAMING THE QUAKE’S SHAKE USING MAGNETORHEOLOGICAL FLUIDS FOR STRUCTURAL SUPPORT AND SEISMIC MITIGATION
Kyle Wilson Downum
Welch High School Welch, OK, USA

Magnetorheological fluids, or MR fluids, are liquids that harden or change shape when subjected to a magnetic field. The purpose of this experiment was to determine if magnetorheological fluids could be used to help stabilize buildings during simulated earthquake activity. It was hypothesized that the properties of MR fluid would improve the stability of structures during such simulation. The procedures were as follows: MR fluids were manufactured and placed in an electromagnetic damper. The dampers were attached to the base of a structure modeling a four-story building. The structure was placed on a waterbed and a weight was dropped from a height of 30 cm to simulate seismic activity. The amount of the structure's vibration was measured using the height of the water splash in a container attached to the top of the structure. The process was repeated with 1, 2, 3, and 4 dampers activated. The height of the splash ranged from a mean of 31.5 mm (0 dampers activated) to 10.5 mm (all 4 dampers activated). ANOVA results gave a p-value of less than .01 adding strong statistical evidence to the conclusion that the activation of MR dampers increased the stability of the structure. As the number of dampers activated increased, the mean height of the splash decreased. Future studies would include perfecting the damper model. A better technical design for the dampers should further increase the stability of the structure.

AERODYNAMICS AND LIFT
Paul Michael Sitler
Westfield Highschool, Westfield, Ma, United States

The purpose of this experiment was to show what kinds of pressure changes occur on an airplane’s wing in flight. The Aerodynamics of flight is a science that many people have misunderstandings about. This experiment demonstrates what occurs on a wing in terms of pressure to create lift. The hypothesis is that the vacuum created by accelerated air over the top of the wing, is a more significant contribution to lift than the slight increase of pressure on the bottom (which is due to a change of momentum of the air). To prove the hypothesis, a closed-circuit wind tunnel was built with three manometers. The manometers measured several things. They measured the velocity of the wind inside the wind tunnel. They also measured the pressure difference of both the top and the bottom of the wing versus static pressure inside the wind tunnel. The results were then graphed and they proved the hypothesis. There is definitely a greater pressure difference over the top of the wing than the bottom. The Bernoulli lift (pressure decrease on top) was always present. The Reaction lift (change in momentum on bottom of wing), however, was only present at increased angles of attack. This proves the hypothesis that the Bernoulli Lift is the main contributing factor in lift. <br><br>

QUERY BY HUMMING
Benjamin Min-Jia Chang
Sewanhaka High School, Floral Park, New York, USA

Query-by-Humming (QBH) systems allow a user to retrieve a specific music file by humming rather than searching using the traditional systems of classification by title, artist, composer, or genre.<br><br>This QBH system searches through the melodic contours of MIDI files rather than MP3 files. The benefits of MIDI files are that they provide a clean numerical representation of music, and are much smaller than MP3 files. A small database of only three MIDI files was used, as the probability of various MIDI melodic contours matching up together and producing a ranked list skewed towards the top increases as the number of MIDI files increase. The pure melody tracks of these MIDI files are obtained through the melody extraction algorithm that was previously developed (project continuation). It is augmented slightly to produce an array containing the values “-1,” “0,” and “+1,” each corresponding to lower, same, and higher respectively. Frequency is calculated using the real fast Fourier transform.<br><br> A notable difference between current QBH systems and this QBH system is the ability of this particular QBH system to expand and mutate rather easily. This system was developed with the mindset that a rhythmic analysis section could be easily inserted, as well as further pitch analysis. The windowing technique used is quite rudimentary and as its own separate function, can be interchanged with other window functions.<br><br>

NANOSCOPIC CONTROL OF PROTEIN ORGANIZATION
Madelyn Meng-Ling Ho
William P. Clements High School, Sugar Land, TX, USA

Tissue engineering needs to provide cells with cues necessary for their organization and biofunctionality. The structure and composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM), which contains proteins, has been shown to have a drastic effect on cell behavior. A critical protein in the ECM is fibronectin (Fn), which is a prominent adhesive protein for cells and will undergo spontaneous fibrillogenesis under the influence of the high surface charge of sulfonated polystyrene. To direct protein organization and cell adhesion, I engineered nanopatterned surfaces. A novel, time-efficient and inexpensive method of engineering nanopatterns utilizes immiscible polymers and the ion mill. Using these engineered gold/silicon nanopatterns, the morphology of the Fn formed on the surfaces was directly related to the underlying nature of the substrate, demonstrating that proteins do not adsorb onto metal substrates. The organization of the Fn was directly influenced by the interactions of the polymer and the substrate nature of the nanopatterns, where the molecule avoided the gold domains, adsorbing only to the silicon domains. Plated cells were shown to be sensitive to the structure of the protein with the cell filopodias attaching to the adsorbed Fn. The cells became more rounded in appearance and well attached as the amount of adsorbed Fn on the surface increased. Therefore, the adhesion of cells is controlled with an engineered surface, which is essential to future advances in tissue engineering. This can also lead to improvements in the engineering of coated metal implants.

FAHRENHEIT: TEMPERATURE BIOTELEMETER
LoriLei Chavez
Bernalillo High School, Bernalillo NM

In this project a biotelemeter was used, a biotelemeter is a pill shaped device that can pick up AM radio signals. The objective of this project is to determine whether a biotelemeter can predict accurate temperatures when compared to a standard thermometer.<br><br>The hypothesis is that the biotelemeter will transmit a one hundred percent accurate temperature. The first step in this project was the construction, the directions to the construction are on the biotelemeter website. After the biotelemeter is constructed then the experimentation begins. Four different days were selected and six different times during each day. On each day at the selected time the temperature was read on the thermometer, and then from the biotelemeter. The way the biotelemeter works is that it is placed near an antenna of an AM/FM radio, the biotelemeter transmits a series of clicks to the radio and the number of clicks transmitted per minute determines the temperature. After all the data was collected it is recorded and graphed.<br><br> Data that was recorded showed that the biotelemeter had a 5:6 accuracy ratio. In conclusion the purpose of this project was to determine the accuracy of the biotelemeter and the hypothesis was it would transmit one hundred percent accurately. The data that was recorded showed that my hypothesis was only half correct being that it came out four times wrong. Some mistakes that occurred is that the biotelemeter only recorded wrong temperatures when the first times were experimented. This lead to further investigate the biotelemeters defects.<br><br>

DESIGNING AN INSTRUMENT FOR GENETIC TESTS THE OPTICAL WAVEGUIDE
Matthew Edwin Trusheim
Breck School, Golden Valley, Minnesota, USA

Genetic testing is an exciting new field in medicine today. However, not every physician has access to genetic tests, due to a lack of interpretive expertise and affordable apparatus. The goal of my project was to engineer an inexpensive instrument, which I named the Optical Waveguide (OWG), for genetic testing that adapted gel electrophoresis to a planar waveguide (PWG). Gel electrophoresis is a proven method for genetic testing, while the PWG is an effective fluorescence detector. Hypothetically, combining these two technologies would results in an inexpensive method for genetic testing with a digital output. Several design aspects were considered: gel casting method, loading method, type of gel, tube diameter, voltage, run time, dye type, staining method, and DNA:dye ratio. The PWG was modified in two areas: a new light shutter was added and a connector was fabricated to accommodate tube gels. A tube casting method with polyacrylamide gel in 5 mm tubes was found to be the easiest to perform. SYBR green intercalating dye was found to be best for use in tubes when used with a pre-staining technique. However, the tube gels did not run consistently. Future work will involve determining ideal voltage, run time, and DNA:dye ratio to solve the inconsistent gel runs. The result of the first phase of my project was a workable prototype. The modifications that were made to the PWG resulted in an OWG architecture that was proven to work for tube gels. In this regard, the project was successful.

IMPAXX: DESIGNING BETTER PLAYGROUND SURFACES WITH FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS
Nicholas Samir Ekladyous
Cranbrook Kingswood Upper School, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan

Most playground surfaces that have good head impact attenuation are not firm and stable and are not easily accessible by all especially the handicapped.<br><br>The purpose of this project was to design a new playground surface that limits head impact injury from falls and is also accessible to individuals with mobility concerns. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was used to design and develop a new engineered playground surface that optimizes both objectives. G-max was used to assess head impact injury criteria. F-max was measured by dropping a 5kg metal headform with a tri-axial accelerometer on various test surfaces at various heights. A "Firm-Ability" index was developed that combines firmness and stability into a single index. A Rotational Penetrometer was used to measure the Firm-Ability. Firmness was tested by first measuring the amount a pre-loaded caster intrudes into a surface. Stability was measured by rotating the pre-loaded caster 360 degrees in the surface and measuring the additional intrusion. (6) Types of conventional surface materials were evaluated along with new engineered surfaces. Several design iterations were evaluated using MSC/NASTRAN Finite Element Analysis software. Static linear analyses along with buckling analyses were performed.<br><br>Results show FEA can be used to develop an engineered surface that is superior for impact attenuation and accessibility compared to conventional surfaces. Predicted Buckling Eigenvalues showed good correlation to maximum g-load testing. IMPAXX ranked highest for total design efficiency which includes the combination of: Maximum G-load Attenuation, Maximum Firm-Ability and Minimum Surface Thickness.

REACTION TIMER

This experiment was designed to build an accurate reaction time tester (Reaction Timer) that could be used on or by an average person. The goal was to use the completed device to test as many people as possible to produce complete results.<br><br> The Reaction Timer was built using a hard hat, circuit boards, and several DIP chips. The stimuli for vision, hearing, and touch were made with light-emitting diodes, an astable multivibrator circuit, a pager vibrator, and the appropriate circuitry.<br><br> When the Reaction Timer was finished, testing was done on individuals between the ages of 18 and 77 so that different age brackets and genders could be compared. The testing was done so that each person would have the same constants.<br><br> In both men and women, the sound test produced the quickest reaction, and the touch tests resulted in the slowest reactions. Adult males between the ages of 33 and 47 had the quickest reaction time overall. On average, men were quicker than women except for ages 63 to 77.<br><br> The Reaction Timer has the potential to be used in many different applications. Different variables or stimuli could be used, the timer can be remeoved from the hard hat in order to be used in different conditions, and the timer could be connected to a computer with the appropriate hardware.

THE DESIGN AND EVALUATION OF MULTI-FREEWING AIRCRAFT
Ryan Thomas Olson
Southwest Virginia Governor's School, Dublin, VA

The main purpose of this project was to demonstrate the feasibility of building a multi-freewing aircraft. The project evaluated the interaction between adjacent freewings of an aircraft. In order to accomplish this goal, measurements of lift, the use of smoke to evaluate the airflow, and photogrammetry tests were performed.<br><br> The initial studies of freewings were conducted. It was concluded that in order to properly test the freewing concept, higher wind tunnel velocities would be required. Formulas were used to determine the increase in power and fan rpm necessary to achieve velocities in the 25 mph range. After successful wind tunnel modifications, the wind tunnel was temporarily modified for smoke testing. Photogrammetry tests were used to compare effect on angle of attack with various wing stagger and separations. Smoke tests were video-recorded to evaluate flow patterns under similar conditions. Three pairs of airfoils were chosen and fabricated to be used for lift testing in the wind tunnel. The wing pairs were tested at selected rotation angles, stagger, and separations. Studies were then conducted in which the center of rotation was varied from 12 to 24 percent.<br><br> It was concluded that the desired stagger for multi-freewings was 0.625c and the separation was 0.75c. It was discovered that the center of rotation should be very close to, but not exactly on, the center of lift. It was also concluded that the ratio behind and in front of the center of rotation should be less than 1.2.

THE EFFECTS OF THE MASS OF THE COMPONENT PARTS OF A TREBUCHET ON ITS RANGE OF PROJECTION
Jonathan Hale Shanklin
Westview High School, Martin, TN, USA

This project's purpose was to determine what mass of a trebuchet's component parts will produce the greatest range of projection. After thorough investigation of the subject, a hypothesis was formed that the greatest range of projection would be produced by the greatest possible mass of the trebuchet's component parts. The project consists of one control test and one hundred and twenty experimental tests. The variable is the mass of the trebuchet's component parts. By adjusting the mass of the trebuchet's counterweight in 1-kg increments and the mass of the trebuchet's throwing arm in 0.1-kg increments, the overall distance of the trebuchet's projection is affected. The set control from which all experiments are deviant consists of a counterweight mass of 22.727kg and a throwing arm mass of 4,225kg. The resulting distances obtained from the experiments will be measured in meters. The results from the past months of research and testing have yielded several correlations between the components involved and the resulting distances. Distance was found to be directly affected by one of the components, and indirectly affected by the other, with combinations as well. The data and the results, however, have not supported the hypothesis set forth at the beginning of the experiment. Other solutions have been found to be more efficient, but the results gathered may not be representative of all possibilities. Further testing and revisions would be required to show direct correlation between the hypothesis and the results of the data gathered.

THE FUNDAMENTALS OF SKATEBOARDING
Blake Hunter Clifft
Camden Central High School Camden, Tennessee

The skateboard tests consisted of: a sliding test, which used a hand rail; elasticity and flexural test, which used a servo driven electric balls crew machine; a hardness test, which used a Brinell Hardness Machine; an abrasion test, which used a fifty pound lead weight; and a moisture content test, which used a Wagner L606 Moisture Meter. The wooden skateboards proved to be better on all tests over fiberglass, composite, and aluminum skateboard decks.

FASTER, STRONGER, CHEAPER THE 'INVECTOR SYSTEM' INCREASING FUEL-EFFICIENCY IN JET ENGINES BY INSTALLING 3 NEW PARTS.
Bradley James Peterson
Riverton High School, Riverton, Utah, United States of America

The project "Faster, Stronger, Cheaper" is the testing of three original parts that could be installed in a bypassing jet engine to increase the engine’s fuel efficiency, top speed, and acceleration. The three parts used in tandem make up the ‘InVector System’ (Internal Thrust Vectoring System). The first of the three parts is called the ‘Director.’ This is nothing more than a double-sided nozzle that can change the path of the airflow. The second piece is the ‘Maintainer’, which is a set of interior cowlings that keep the exhaust gasses flowing in a specific path. The third and most critical piece is the ‘Helix N2 Turbine.’ The HN2 turbine blade is simply a standard N2 turbine blade that has had its shape modified to run at different efficiencies across different locations on the blade. In essence, the ‘InVector’ acts like a transmission for a jet engine, but has no fast moving parts. <br><br>Brad developed a formula that calculated approximately how much more efficient an engine with the ‘InVector’ would be than a standard jet engine. The mathematics were prepared in such a way that only one variable was needed to be inserted into the calculations to give the appropriate answer. The single independent variable was the position of which the ‘InVector’ was running, which gave the dependant variable of the shaft RPMs. After mathematical analysis, it was discovered that the ‘InVector’ could improve fuel efficiency by 8%-16% depending on the engine type.<br><br>

AERODYNAMICS AND RACING...WHAT A DRAG
Steven J. Schmidt
MLS-Mohall High School, Mohall, North Dakota

In this experiment, I am testing various body shells for 1/12 scale remote control race cars to discover which body shell would yield the best overall aerodynamics. The testing required a controlled wind source so I developed a wind tunnel for testing. Once the wind tunnel was complete, I tested each body for drag, downforce (front and rear). I concluded that the body that produced high downforce without a high drag force would provide the best results during race performance. I achieved an easy comparison between the bodies by calculating a downforce to drag ratio.<br><br> <br><br>A good body shell would allow the car to enter and exit corners at optimal speed, thus increasing the speed around the track. A well made body will also allow the car to achieve very high speeds on straight sections of the track due to the minimal drag. Two cars with equal capabilities that had different body shells with different characteristics will perform differently throughout the various situations on a racetrack. A car with low downforce and drag will reach higher speeds in straight sections of a track than a car with high downforce and low drag. Although the car with low downforce will reach higher speeds in straight lines, it will be the slower car overall because the car with higher downforce will be able to negotiate corners at much higher speeds due to the downforce, thus making it faster overall since the track is not in a straight line.<br><br>

ALDEHYDE AND ALDEHYDE-METHANOL MIXTURES AS A POTENTIAL FUEL FOR A DIRECT OXIDATION FUEL CELL
Laura M. Janvrin
Blue Valley North High School, Overland Park, KS, USA

Fuels cells seem to be an ideal method of producing efficient and environmentally friendly energy. Hydrogen, the ideal fuel, is hard to produce, transport, and store. A possible solution would be to further develop direct oxidation fuel cell technology to function on alternative fuels, most likely from the hydrocarbon family and a derivative of natural gas. It was anticipated that running a Direct Oxidation Fuel Cell (DOFC) on aldehyde and aldehyde-methanol mixtures would lead to a higher voltage and power output. To test this, DOFCs were run on 0.25M, 0.5M, and 1M methanol as well as 1M and 3M acetaldehyde at 23 deg. C, 40 deg. C and 60 deg. C. A DOFC was also run on 1:1, 2:1, 1:2, and 1:3 methanol(1M)-acetaldehyde(1M) mixtures and a 1:1 methanol(1M)-acetaldehyde(3M) mixture at the same temperatures. In all fuel formulations, increasing the operating temperature of the fuel cell was found to be directly related to an increase in performance, as indicated by an increase in current rates and power outputs. Acetaldehyde was shown to have potential as a fuel in a direct oxidation fuel cell, but adding acetaldehyde to methanol did not seem to improve the overall performance of the fuel cell. At each temperature, the fuel mixtures of methanol and acetaldehyde had significantly lower current rates and power outputs than 1M methanol at the same temperature. However, the 1M acetaldehyde solution and the 2:1 and 1:1 methanol-acetaldehyde(1M) mixutres at 60 deg. C showed similar results as the 1M methanol solution at 23 deg. C, indicating the possibility of the acetaldehyde and mixtures being suitable fuels in some applications.

SMART SEAT: A SAFER CHILD'S CAR SEAT
Jordan Michael Krell
Plankinton High School, Plankinton SD, USA

The goal of my project is to keep a child safe in the family vehicle at all times, whether the vehicle is moving or not. In 2005, 41 American children died from hyperthermia, and in the past ten years 290 children have died from hyperthermia. The Smart Seat will save lives with two main features: 1) it will alert the driver and others that a child has been left unattended in his or her car seat with the ignition off for a period of time. 2) It will alert the driver and occupants when a child has unbuckled him or herself or if the seat belt became unbuckled for any reason while the ignition is on. <br><br> <br><br>To detect the presence of a child, I used a weight sensor that measures the force of the child, against the bottom of the Smart Seat. I developed a rolling surface sensor to guarantee that the weight, or force reading is accurate no matter where the child is in the seat. The force between the bottom of the car seat and the rolling surface sensor is the force that is measured. A Hall-effect sensor, which detects magnetic fields, was installed in the buckle apparatus of the car seat harness. Neodymium magnets were imbedded in the belt buckle clip. The practicality of the seat has undergone a real-world test. In mass production, the Smart Seat would be an economical solution to saving the lives of children who perish as a result of “I forgot.” <br><br>

THE POWER OF A VORTEX
Andrez Benito Montoya
Alamogordo Senior High School, Alamogordo New Mexico, United States of America

In this project the purpose was to study if compressed air or water pumped through a small domestic vortex tube will be able to produce cold and hot air or water that can be utilized in everyday life.<br><br> The 30 gallon air compressor or a submersible pump provides the input to the vortex tube through a 3/8” hole at its center. The vortex tube has two outputs, each measured using two cooking thermometers one on each output of the tube, hot and cold. The air compressor ran at 87 pounds per square inch and the submersible pump at 4.25 gallons per minute. <br><br> The vortex using water failed because the water temperatures on either output showed no variance. On the basis of my tests the pump does not create enough pressure so the vortex does not warm and cool the water.<br><br> The vortex tube using air pressure was successful! The maximum temperature reached was 101.1ºF on the hot output and 77ºF on the cold output using the 7/64” hole in the dime. It was only proven when the washer/dime with a smaller diameter of hole replaced the ½”diameter washer. The smaller diameter washer was needed to increase the efficiency of the vortex tube, by increasing the air pressure inside the tube. The air was pumped in at 87 pounds per square inch at 63ºF. The washer reduced the air flow increasing the pressure of the vortex, resulting in the molecular separation of hot and cold outputs. <br><br>

AN IN VITRO STUDY OF AEROSOL DELIVERY USING CARINA MODELS
Abhiram Ramaswamy Bhashyam
Bethel Park High School, Bethel Park, PA, USA

The purpose of this research was to determine if a change in the delivery gas of an aerosol to heliox would enhance aerosol drug delivery through an obstruction following the first bifurcation of the lungs. Trials were performed on a respiratory model consisting of a modeled mouth, carina, and trachea. A specified dose of 1.5 M NaCl solution was delivered to the unobstructed and obstructed carina models while varying the delivery gas (ambient air or heliox). Deposition in the left and right bronchi was measured simultaneously. It was determined that heliox enhances drug delivery to the lung by as much as 69% in the right bronchus and significantly higher in the left bronchus. In addition, confounding factor tests confirmed the validity of heliox’s effects. The importance of these results in relationship to improving aerosol drug delivery in obstructed lungs is subsequently discussed.

STRESSED OUT AGAIN!
Keri Elizabeth Hernandez
Ellendale Public High School, Ellendale, North Dakota, United States

The purpose of my project is to determine if sulfuric acid will increase the amount of stress produced by Lexan plastic, the material airplane windows are made of.<br><br> I hypothesize the sulfuric acid will increase the amount of stress produced and the stress will progressively increase over the time periods of 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours when load tested with 3-kg.<br><br> Cut and assemble the polariscope according to the diagram and procedure list. Also set up the heating chamber and desiccator according to the procedure list and photographs. Drill each of four Lexan pieces according to the procedure. Load test each Lexan piece in the polariscope and photograph prior to experimentation for comparison reasons. Place the Lexan pieces into the heating chamber for 24 hours at 120 degrees F at 100% RH. Then, remove each specimen, lightly coat with 90% sulfuric acid, and place them into the desiccator. After each time period of 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours, remove one of the Lexan pieces and place it in the water bath for two hours, dry with lens paper, load test with a 3-kg weight in the polariscope, and photograph each.<br><br> My results showed that on each Lexan specimen the stress patterns did change slightly and stress did increase in different areas. In order of the first Lexan piece to the fourth, the fringe counts changed for each piece as follows: 3.35 to 7.43, 5.84 to 8.34, 4.09 to 5.84, and 4.84 to 6.86. The differences of increase are 4.08, 2.5, 1.75, and 2.02. As for a progession of stress over time, no significant or visible observations gave evidence to such results.<br><br> From this, I conclude that my hypothesis was both partially correct and incorrect. The sulfuric acid did increase the amount of stress, but no progressively increasing stress occurred between specimens.

RIGHT ANGLE COUPLING: THE THEORY OF COUPLING WAVE-GUIDES AT A RIGHT ANGLE ON THE NANO-SCALE.
Trinity Ann Romney
Riverton High School, Riverton, UT United States of America

Optical computer processors are an essential evolution to the creation of increased processing power without increased heat buildup. While nano-scale in-line coupling of fibre optics (wave-guides) has been accomplished, I found no research indicating it has been physically attempted at right angles, which will be necessary if optical processors are to become a reality. <br><br> <br><br> Working with current researchers and reviewing research from the past several years, I determined that there are several potential approaches to coupling wave-guides at 90° angles, but none have been evaluated against one another, and various elements of these potential approaches could be combined to create more effective approaches.<br><br> <br><br> By using 3mm glass rods I simulated multiple iterations of a right angle coupling. Iterations were created from rods cleaved at a 45° angles, straight rods, and simulated ring resonators. By evaluating data gathered from various combinations of these elements, I have determined the couplings with the greatest functionality at the macro-scale, and thus the highest potential for application at the micro-scale, and then the nano-scale. <br><br>

WOOD ARCHES HAVE A DIFFERENCE?
Shannon Lee Klein
Wishek Public School, Wishek ND, United States of America

I performed this experiment in hopes of finding in greater detail the strength of the common arch and the difference in strength, if any, in the variation of the arch. To aid me in learning this I designed 8 different arches with varieing diametric measurments and designs. I believe that the under support arches will be the strongest and most efficent, and also that the arches with the 7 diametric centimeter measurement will be more efficient. Also I Beleive that the standard style arches will be most efficient, and also that the braced arches will out perform the freestyle arches. I first positioned two heavey-duty construction supports 64 centimeters off the ground and 6.5 centimeters apart for the testing of the 7 diametric centimeter arches. I then proceded to test all four 7 diametric centimeter arches adding weight at 500 gram intervals I continued this until each arch gaveway. I then repositioned the saw horses so that they were still 64 centimeters off the ground but 8.5 centimeters apart for the testing of the 9 diametric centimeter arches. I then tested the 9 diametric centimeter arches exactly as before also adding weight at 500 gram intervals. I then modified my apperatus so it had side-supports also and tested all of the above arches with the modified apperatus. I then performed three trials off the procedure to get more accurate results. What I found was that the braced arches were much more structurally efficient, also the under-support arches out performed the over-support arches and the standard style arches out performed the keystone style arches.

SMART CANES FOR THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED
Brittney Dyanne Black
Black Homeschool, Williston, North Dakota, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to prove the concept that a “smart cane” could be developed which can aid in the mobility of visually-impaired users. I hypothesized that a “smart cane” could be engineered which can aid in the mobility of visually-impaired users. <br><br> I acquired two sensors to sense obstacles in front of the user and to monitor the ground level. Then the cane circuitry was developed, which was a six-step process: (1)Circuit diagram drawn using SuperCAD software, (2)Circuit built on bread-board, (3)Components drawn on scanned copy of circuit-board, (4)Components soldered on circuit-board, (5)Cane hardware designed and built, (6)Sensors re-soldered on circuit-board after cane assembly.<br><br> After cane completion, three subjects were informed of the features of the cane, blind-folded, and instructed to complete four tasks: (1)Walk over curb from sidewalk to street, (2)Walk over curb from street to sidewalk, (3)Maneuver around obstacles in room, (4)Maneuver through doorway. All tasks were performed ten times, and each test was scored as a pass or fail. A test was considered a failure if the user touched any obstacles with their body.<br><br> The cane worked exactly as it was engineered to, although there were some sensor limitations. However, the subjects were able to maneuver quite successfully. None of the subjects passed less than 7 of the 10 tests per task.<br><br> I conclude that my hypothesis was correct. A “smart cane” was successfully designed which proved that a cane equipped with sensors and circuitry can aid in the mobility of a visually impaired person.<br><br>

LIFT WITH A TWIST
Sarah Elizabeth Harrison
Bluebird Christian Academy (home-school), Whitehall, MT, USA

This project investigates the stalling characteristics of two different wing designs. My intention was to find out if washout, a built-in upward twist on the trailing edge, increases aileron effectiveness during a stall. The theory was that the lessened angle of attack at the tip of the wing results in delayed stalling over the aileron; thus allowing the aileron to be in effect longer.<br><br> To test my hypothesis, I constructed one wing with washout and one wing without to be used as the control for the experiment. Then, the two wings were flown at the same velocity in a wind tunnel. First, I brought the control wing to its stall angle and recorded my observations. Next, the washout wing was brought to the control wing?s stall angle and the results were documented. From the photographs, I could see that the washout wing?s aileron maintained smooth airflow at the same angle which the control wing had been fully turbulent.<br><br> I determined that washout does indeed have a positive affect on aileron effectiveness because a pilot would for a brief period have use of the ailerons in a stall. This supports my hypothesis and explains the reason why so many of modern airplanes have washout in their wing design.

NANOCOMPOSITE ENZYMATIC ELECTRODES FOR BIOFUEL CELL APPLICATIONS
Daniel Clayton Appel
Eldorado High School, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA

Enzymatic biofuel cells are a very attractive means of efficiently converting chemical energy to electrical energy. The incorporation of biomolecules and novel nanomaterials allows for improved electron transport in micro/nano scale portable power generation applications. The unique electronic properties of carbon nanotubes make them ideal for use in devices such as bioelectronics, biosensors, biomedical diagnostics, implants, MEMS, bioreactors, optoelectronics, and power patches/textiles.<br><br> Experimentation focused on direct electron transfer between enzymatic active sites and electrode surfaces using various methods to optimize electrode power densities. Work was centered on triphase gas diffusion cathodes (GDE), including experimentation with multi-walled nanotube/carbon black/teflonated carbon black mixture, and atmospheric parameters to optimize gas diffusion electrode efficiency. <br><br> I hypothesized that using multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWNT) composite electrodes, I could attain power densities greater than vitreous carbon or disperse carbon black electrodes using physically adsorbed fungal laccase. Experimental electrodes were tested in an electrochemical cell with a Pt reference electrode and a Ag/AgCl counter electrode.<br><br> Fungal laccase GDE cathodes using carbon blacks produced open circuit potentials of 1.03V, and 110uW power; MWNT/carbon black composite electrodes generated 93uW. The miniature biofuel cell was fabricated from rubber washers and plastic caulk tips. The carbon black GDE cathode and mediated glucose oxidase anode produced open circuit potentials consistent with other research. Future work will hopefully include single-walled carbon nanotubes as a high surface area microelectrode material, as well as continued miniaturization of biofuel cell electrodes and whole cell designs for portable mico/nano power generation applications.<br><br>

DOMES: THE PROS AND CONS OF TRIANGULATION
Ryan Benjamin Rainville
Rutland High School, Rutland, Vermont, United States of America

<br><br> After discovering the system of frequency triangulation used in domes, I wanted to discover how it affected dome mass and support capacity of the dome. Using dome mass, support capacity, efficiency, and overall structure as the basic criteria, my objective was to<br><br>find what frequency of triangulation provided the best overall dome. <br><br> To accomplish this task I designed a dome with a primary structure using five and a half inch coffee stirrers as model beams and hot glue at junctions. I created four primary structures so that the diameter(approx. 21 inches), height, and curvature remained uniform. I left one dome in the simple form, then triangulated the others with 2, 3, and 4 frequency triangulation respectively. I massed all the domes to find their densities, and then built a device to test support capacity. Working with wood and plaster of Paris, I designed an apparatus that would allow pressure to be applied to the upper regions of the domes. Using a combination of bricks and massing tools for accuracy, I found each dome’s maximum carrying ability. From the experiment’s quantitative and qualitative results, in conjunction with calculations, I found the three frequency dome to be the best structure. It allowed some flexibility while supporting a large amount of mass and gave the best ratio of support per gram of dome mass.

FUME HOOD FOR THE SCIENCE LAB-PHASE II, IMPROVING AIRFLOW
Erik Michael Knutson
Edinburg Public School District 106, Edinburg, North Dakota, United States

My engineering goal was to perfect airflow in the device I built last year as Phase I of my two-year project. This year's project focused on airflow. Last year the device funtioned with the door closed, but this year, I wanted it to funtion with the door open to allow for hands-on use, while evacuating fumes efficiently.<br><br>I constructed a baffle system and installed it in the rear of the device. The baffle system demonstrated Bernoulli's principle, faster moving fluids have lower pressure, drawing fumes to the rear.<br><br>After I constructed the baffle system, I balanced the fans. Before balancing, the bottom fan pushed faster than the negative draw from the top. This problem pressurized the fume hood causing the fumes to leave through the open door in the front. Adjusting the pulleys obtained the desired speed of the roof fan, dramatically improving results.<br><br>To test, smoke-releasing fireworks were ignited in the chamber (seven inch opening), which cleared in nearly one minute. Only a small amount of smoke was detected when disturbed.<br><br>Our science lab now has a working fume hood.

ABSTRACT BLAZE BATTLING 'BOTS
Gabriel Carson Elder
Highland High School, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA

Every year, there are over 300,000 house fires. They cause a total of $5.9 billion in damage, which is only a fraction of the devastation that is caused by house fires. Most house fire deaths occur when the victim is unaware of the fire. Half of all fire related deaths occur between 10pm and 6am, the time that most people are asleep. However, only one fifth of house fires occur in that time frame. The most effective fire fighting system would target fires that occur when the human inhabitance are not aware of the fire.<br><br> This project creates an autonomous system to fight fires when they start. A detection system would be used to detect a fire in a home. The robot will respond to the fire alarms in the house. It will go to the room in which a fire alarm has been triggered. Once it reaches the room, it will begin to scan the room for a fire. It will use an ultra-directional flame flicker sensor to locate the fire.<br><br> For demonstration purposes, the robot has been outfitted to operate within display parameters. The display area represents a room in a house. Several beacons are setup as mock fires. The robot will find the beacon within the display area, and give visual indication that it has found it.<br><br> The robot was able to successfully find the beacon in the display area, and demonstrate its abilities. While simple in principle, this system has endless possibilities for improvement. If further developed, this system could become a mainstream system for fighting home fires.<br><br>

RESIDENTIAL COGENERATION
Alex J Doll
Mandan High School, Mandan, ND USA

The main purpose of this project was to maximize the potential energy lost by current heating systems. <br><br> The efficiency of Residential Cogeneration was determined by combining the results from several experiments. The first experiment was fuel consumption vs. duration of run time. This was found by measuring a specific amount of fuel going into the engine, then measuring the amountof time the engine would run. The test showed that the engine would run for 7 minutes on 4 fluid ounces. The second experiment was the air temperature going into the engine vs. the air temperature coming from the engine. This experiment was conducted by measuring the relative air temperature both entering and leaving the engine, then subtracting the two figures. The test results showed that the engine was taking in 47 degree air and was exhausting 129 degree air resulting in a delta "T" of 82 degrees. The third experiment was determining the cfm of the engine. This experiment was conducted using an Alnor Model #150 electronic balometer to measure the cubic feet of air passing through the engine every minute. The test resluts showed that the engine was moving 270 cfm or cubic feet of air per minute. The fourth experiment was finding the flow of water passing through Yammy. This experiment was conducted by timeing how it took to fill a two-gallon bucket. The test results showed that the flow rate through Yammy was two gallons in 5:45 or roughly 20.87 gallon per hour.<br><br> In conclusion, I found that Residential Cogeneration was 83.62 % efficient; the engine by itself was 55.66% efficient, the engine with Yammy was 68.46% efficient, the engine with Yammy and the ganerator was 72.55% efficient, and the entire system was 83.62% efficient. This means that a home with Residential Cogeneration could consume 15-20 percent less fuel. I must also give recognition to Delton Doll.

TELEVISION CAMERA WIPER SYSTEM
Cody Alan Fleckenstein
New Salem High School, New Salem North Dakota, United States of America

After noticing water spots on the T.V. camera lens, it bothered me, so I came up with a mission to figure out how I could remove them. My engineering goal was to develop a wiper system that could be attached to a television camera and successfully remove the unwanted rain or snow, so that it would not be seen during the broadcast of that event on the news or television taping. After going through many diffrent designs and motor assemblies I successfully came up with my first wiper system that successfully removed unwanted rain and weather spots from the camera lens. After successfully using this at local and regional science fairs I developed the latest model I call the "Dry Swipe" and in the process of contacting invention submission corporation and plan on patenting this wiper system.

PRESSURE BRAKING YEAR TWO
Alexander Winslow Mavrogordato 
Hilton Head Prep,Hilton Head Island, SC

The purpose of this experiment was to design a more efficient brake light system for a vehicle. The new model was based on a one word system. The word “STOP” is associated with the stages of braking and the brake pressure applied at each stage. A combination of constant and flashing Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) was used to indicate the amount of pressure being applied to the brake. <br><br> The design consisted of four levels of braking: light brake (letter S), medium brake (letter T), hard brake (letter O) and emergency/no traction brake (letter P). The LEDs were placed in an ascending slope linear design. The word stop was used because it is universal and anyone can understand it . A brake simulator was built in order to illustrate all of the different braking possibilities and scenarios. <br><br> In conclusion, this new brake light gives the driver more information allowing for better driving decisions. No longer will a driver have to differentiate between a light tap and a life and death braking situation on the basis of a single brake light system. <br><br><br><br><br>

CATALYTIC GROWTH OF ZIRCONIUM OXIDE NANOWIRES AND THEIR ELECTRON FIELD EMISSION
Michael Edward Coulter
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland OR, USA

One-dimensional nanostructures have received much attention in recent years due to their novel physical properties. Zirconium oxide is currently used as a coating to improve electron field emission sources in field emission microscopes. To improve the resolution of field emission microscopes, a smaller diameter tip can be used; nanowires have possible applications to this end. The purpose of this project was to synthesize zirconium oxide nanowires and to test their field emission properties for this application. Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) and Laser-assisted CVD were used to synthesize these wires. In the conventional CVD procedure, silicon substrates and zirconium oxide powder mixed with graphite were placed in a quartz tube inside a tube furnace. The furnace was brought to a growth temperature for varied amounts of time. For the Laser-assisted CVD a Nd:YAG laser was used to vaporize a zirconium target. This procedure deposited zirconium on the silicon substrates. The rest of the procedure was kept the same as the conventional CVD. The substrates were characterized with electron microscopy. Thin curved nanowires were formed with conventional CVD and straight nanorods were formed with laser-assisted CVD. Preliminary electron field emission tests have been completed but no conclusions can be made from them at this time.

THE BAKER AIRCHAIR 2004: A MANIFOLD MULTI-TERRAIN HOVER PLATFORM
Eric Charles Baker
Southeast High School, Oklahoma City Oklahoma, United States

This year's project goal was to create a newly designed multi-terrain hover platform that was self contained. The platform is powered by battery packs mounted on the craft itself. These battery packs are the power source for all of the electronics on the manifold. <br><br> <br><br>The hypothesis states that if the required battery packs, remote control receiver, and four total fans attached to the newly designed hover-platform are lightweight enough, the hover-platform will achieve lift. It also stated that if the remotely controlled fans are installed properly and powerful enough, the platform can be maneuvered in multiple directions by use of remote control. Another experiment was added after the hypothesis was written whereas mass was equally distributed on the platform to test the strength (power) of the fan.<br><br> <br><br>The platform hovered with ease proving the first hypothesis but rotated in a clockwise motion. The remotely controlled fans did not move the platform therefore rejecting the second part of the hypothesis. As to the final test, up to 500g could be added to the platform before it could not achieve lift.<br><br> <br><br>The clockwise movement of the platform was created by the counter-clock wise movement of the fan in the platform itself. This was because the platform had no anchor, therefore the rotation of the fan had to be offset by the rotation of the platform. The remotely controlled fans were not strong enough to counter the rotation of the platform, therefore the fans had no control over the unit.<br><br>

CELLULOSE INSULATION VIABILITY: THE DEVELOPMENT OF FLAMMABILITY AND CORROSION TESTING PROCEDURES.
Luke Andrew Nowlin
Grove High School, Grove, Oklahoma, USA

The use of cellulose insulation in the modern construction industry is growing in popularity compared to other more conventional types of insulation. Questions to be asked. Is this type of insulation flammable? Does the cellulose cause corrosion to pipes, wires or surrounding metal structures? <br><br> It is hypothesized that the insulation will be corrosive to metals, the insulation will be flame resistant, and the different brands of insulation will all act similar to each other. <br><br> An environmental chamber was designed from a school laboratory digital oven. Corrosion effects were tested in the environmental chamber for six weeks. Humidity and temperature were closely monitored. Samples of metals were placed in different containers of cellulose insulation. Samples of metals were compared for corrosion by weighing before the test and after the test to find the percentage of weight loss during the test.<br><br> The flame tunnel was built from metal, glass & hardy backer board. The flammability test was done using a torch and the flame tunnel to find the spread of flame in a fifteen minute interval. <br><br> The pH test was done to determine the level of pH. Acidic pH would cause more corrosion. Cellulose was blended with water, warmed, soaked for 24 hours then pH was tested.<br><br> The hypothesis was supported. The different brands of insulation acted similarly to each other for the most part. One insulation was extremely set apart in both corrosion and flame test. However, it was not the same insulation in both cases. <br><br>

DEVELOPING A TWO PART THERMO SETTING EPOXY RESIN INFUSED WITH NANOPOX-XP TECHNOLOGY: SYNTHETIC STEEL
Brent William Tyler
Hilton Head Prep, Hilton Head Island, SC, USA.

The purpose of conducting this experiment was to develop a synthetic material using chopped Kevlar fibers and various percents of Nanopox-XP Silicon Dioxide. The two materials were infused into a two-part thermo-setting epoxy resin in an effort to develop a material that was hypothesized to be much stronger than the Laminating L-135 base resin. <br><br> The results of this experiment are as follows: the L-135 resin which was infused with 0% silicon dioxide held up very well for not having any reinforcement. The L-135 resin with 23% silicon dioxide did not perform as well as the L-135 resin which only had 18%. This is due to the problem of incomplete curing of the chemicals, creating extremely weak spots throughout the substance. The resin, which was infused with both silicon dioxide and with chopped Kevlar, was able to endure more force than any of the other materials by a large order of magnitude. All of the materials strength were tested with an originally designed apparatus. <br><br> In conclusion, the synthetic Kevlar blended material proved to be the best choice as reinforcement. The application of such technology could dramatically enhance the overall safety records associated with the transportation industry.

AIRFOIL DESIGN
Ashley Brianne Sicard
Windsor High School, Windsor, Vermont, United States of America

The focus of this project is airfoil design and the effects of thickness and angle of attack on lift. Through background research, I hypothesized that as the thickness of an airfoil increases and as the angle of attack increases up to the point of a stall, then the lift would also increase.<br><br> To test my hypothesis, I used “FoilSim”, a program that compares airfoil designs and angles of attack. As I altered the angle of attack up to 21 degrees, the lift would increase up to the point of a stall and, independent of the thickness of the wing, the maximum lift would always occur at 16 degrees. To confirm these simulated results, I built my own wind tunnel that was able to demonstrate lift but could not accurately determine a numerical value for lift. Due to this limitation, I acquired access to a local college’s research facility. Using their wind tunnel, force stem system and machine shop, I made and tested airfoils with 5% and 15% thicknesses as determined by the percentage of the chord. The thinner wing exhibited a maximum lift of 0.3633 N at an angle of 37.98 degrees, while the thicker wing exhibited a maximum lift of 0.2280 N at an angle of 35.31 degrees. From these various experiments, I was able to conclude that lift does increase as the thickness increases, though there are minimal affects overall. Additionally, as the angle of attack increases up to the point of a stall, the lift increases significantly.<br><br>

ROBOTS TO THE RESCUE: THE EFFECT OF SENSOR TYPE ON THE DETECTION OF LIFE SIGNS
Brian Edward Pinkham
Stone Bridge High School, Ashburn VA, USA

In years to come, Urban Search and Rescue Robotics (USAR) will effect most major search and rescue operation around the world. For a USAR robot to be practical, the most effective life detecting sensors must be used. <br><br>In this project a mobile robot was designed, created, and programmed which could autonomously navigate and search for life. The robot was equipped with different sensors to look for signs of life: heat, motion, and color (red). Each sensor was tested individually against a control group of all the sensors used simultaneously in an array. In each test, the robot was sent out to search for a person wearing red clothing and moving around on the ground, and the time needed to find the person was recorded.<br><br>The results showed the individual sensors were 32% to 43% faster than the array using all of the sensors. This did not support the hypothesis that: if an array of sensors were used, the amount of time needed to find the life would decreased. Two explanations for this have been identified. First, it takes twice as long to collect data from all the sensors then it does from just one. Second, at least two out of the three sensors in the array must indicate the presence of life in the same direction. This does help filter out extraneous and erroneous recordings, however, this too often resulted in correct sensor readings being disregarded due to varying sensor sensitivities at different distances.<br><br>

DEVELOPMENT OF A FUNCTIONAL KNEE BRACE FOR PATIENTS WITH MEDIAL OR LATERAL COMAPRTMENT SYNDROME
Andrea Lynn Sims
Mecosta Osceola Math Science Technology Center, Big Rapids MI, USA 

The main goals of this project were to create a functional knee brace that would provide stability to the knee, correct medial or lateral compartment syndrome, and prevent hyperextension while maintaining free movement of the knee. <br><br>As the brace is a custom-fit brace, the first step was to cast the patient's leg and create a plaster model. Then a one-quarter inch piece of polyethylene was thermoformed around the model to give an exact fit to the patient's leg. The brace was cut to shape out of the plastic and the hinges and straps were riveted into place. After testing was completed using a Goniometer, the brace was found to be effective in stabilizing the knee and preventing hyperextension. <br><br> This brace is different from others because it uses different lengths of uprights to achieve the three points of pressure that are needed to push the knee into the correct position. Single axis hinges were used. This does not correct either compartment syndrome but still provides stability to the knee.<br><br> It was found that the brace did restrict flexion. The knee in natural flexion was measured at 332.5 degrees for the lateral side and 336.5 degrees for the medial. With the brace, however, flexion was measured at 293.5 degrees for the lateral side and 295.4 degrees for the medial side. As it is this brace doesn't correct lateral or medial compartment syndrome because the correct hinges were unattainable.<br><br>

ELECTRONIC RANGERS: ASSISTANCE FOR VISUALLY IMPAIRED CANINES
Ryan Benjamin Rainville
Rutland High School, Rutland, Vermont, USA

Canine blindness is a relatively common, often genetically caused, problem. Many<br><br>owners oppose putting their animals down, yet visually impaired canines can often have<br><br>problems avoiding obstacles in their home environment. The purpose of this experiment is<br><br>to use obstacle sensors, such as optoelectronic infrared rangers, to help blind dogs move<br><br>about safely.<br><br>My first prototype idea was to use a pyroelectric infrared detector (PIR) with an<br><br>infrared LED, a microcontroller, and a piezoelectric buzzer. The goal was to have the<br><br>LED positioned to reflect infrared light off of obstructions so that the PIR sensor would<br><br>receive the light and trigger the piezo buzzer. The design did not give the desired results,<br><br>however, and I researched other options.<br><br>In my second prototype I used an infrared ranger and replaced the piezoelectric<br><br>buzzer with a cell phone vibrator. A microcontroller was used, as well as parts measuring<br><br>vertical acceleration to help the device know when the dog was moving. Tests were also<br><br>performed to show that the device was successful at detecting common indoor<br><br>obstructions. <br><br>The component parts can be placed on a harness or even a collar and I researched<br><br>aspects of classical conditioning to confirm that dogs would understand the warning<br><br>system and respond accordingly. I also tested the device on a blind dog to ensure that it<br><br>was comfortable and functional.

VOLTAGE GENERATION USING AN OSCILLATING FABRIC
Julie Christina Sung
Hopkinton High School , Hopkinton, MA, USA

Power harnessed from the wind, a renewable, non-polluting energy source is an important aspect of the world's future energy policy. Today's wind conversion devices use a vertical or horizontal axial rotating mechanism. These rotating windmills are controversial because of poor aesthetics and alleged detrimental effects on avian wildlife. The goal of the project was to construct a non-rotational wind-to-electric energy conversion device utilizing a flexible oscillating fabric.<br><br>The technique for energy conversion is based upon Faraday's Law that states any change in the magnetic environment of a coil will induce voltage. Various copper coil patterns were affixed to the fabric and oscillated in magnetic fields created by neodymium magnets. It was hypothesized that higher voltage would be produced in a bipolar magnetic design due to greater differential in magnetic flux. The fabric was affixed to a stationary rod on one end and allowed to oscillate +/- 30 degrees from the center axis, mimicking a conventional flag on a pole. Magnetic fields in the proximity of the oscillating end were presented in a unipolar N-only configuration and a bipolar N-N configuration. Voltage data was collected at regular time intervals by a computerized probe connected to the coils while oscillating the fabric. <br><br>The results demonstrated that the bipolar design generated significantly greater voltage (p<0.05), supporting the hypothesis. The findings could be used to optimize the power harnessed from the wind using a flag as the medium.<br><br>

THE FOURTH STATE OF MATTER THE CAUSES AND EFFECTS OF A PRETILT BIAS IN NEMATIC LIQUID CRYSTAL MESOGENS
Tori Paige Loke Chu
The Charter School of Wilmington, Wilmington, DE, USA

In 1888, a substance with two melting points and an undetermined state was discovered. Now known as a liquid crystal, it is used in liquid crystal displays (LCDs). Since the computer industry is expanding, companies must create more efficient displays with greater performance, while remaining cost efficient and labor efficient.<br><br> One way to improve liquid crystal display performance is by varying an angle called pretilt. When a charge is applied to a liquid crystal substance, its elongated molecules align along a common axis. However, if the molecules rotate in different directions, bright lines called disclination lines form, making the display unappealing. To remedy this, the molecules are given a pretilt bias. In this project, liquid crystal cells were fabricated with substrates that had been exposed to different amounts of UV radiation, producing varying pretilts in order to determine how pretilt magnitude affects other properties of liquid crystal displays. Conclusions include:<br><br> • Pretilt is induced by oblique exposure of organic alignment materials to polarized UV light.<br><br> • The chemical structure of the polymer side chains determines the response of the liquid crystal molecules.<br><br> • While pretilt eliminates disclination lines, increased pretilt causes inferior switching properties, contrast, transmission, and voltage holding ratio. Cells without pretilt have disclination lines and high switching voltages, but symmetrical and wider viewing angles.<br><br> • An intermediate pretilt would optimize most LCD properties. Optimum pretilt depends on the type of display.<br><br> • Based on this research, optimum pretilt can be determined for a twisted nematic liquid crystal display.<br><br>

CAN'T TOUCH THIS WALL AUTONOMOUS WALL FOLLOWING WITH DISTANCE SENSORS
Jonathan A Gray
Gray Homeschool, Marlboro, NJ, USA

The purpose of this project was to determine the best method of programming an autonomous robot to follow a wall using distance sensors. A robot was constructed with distance sensors on one side and the front. It was programmed with four different wall-following algorithms that used one sensor, and four that used two sensors. Each of these eight algorithms was tested for speed and accuracy of the robot.<br><br> <br><br>A wall was constructed with progressively sharper corners along its length. For the experiment, the robot was run along the wall with each of the eight algorithms. The speed at which the robot proceeded along the wall and the distance it progressed before it touched the wall were recorded. Ten trials were conducted for each algorithm to ensure consistency of results.<br><br> <br><br>The data collected from the experiment show that there was a tradeoff of speed for accuracy. The algorithm that directed the robot to drive in a wide arc towards the wall and turn away when it was too close was found to be the best algorithm using a single sensor. This distinction was based on its superior accuracy, as accuracy is more highly valued for wall following than speed.<br><br> <br><br>With the addition of the second sensor, three of the algorithms had perfect accuracy. The fastest of these three was the algorithm that instructed the robot to go straight until it was too close or far from the wall. This algorithm was thereby identified as the best algorithm for autonomous wall following.

SIMPLIFYING THE PREPARATION OF HEMOSTATIC AGENTS
Allison Lindsey Lloyd
Friendswood HS, Friendswood, Texas, USA

In order to engineer a medical device for the purpose of bringing the use of better medicines to battlefield and emergency situations, I began the process of invention by researching the different medicines most effective for the coagulation, or clotting of blood. Many hemostatic medicines are not applicable for use in these situations due to the complexity of the preparation process. I chose two medicines whose preparation could be simplified simultaneously, using only one central design. My intention was to create a new device that would simplify the preparation and administration of several different types of medicines, a “universal” device. I chose Novo7 and Floseal, studied their preparation instructions, and began brainstorming to find a solution to my dilemma. I reviewed each sketch I drew to find problems, which I attempted to solve with the next sketch. When my ideas repeatedly became more complicated I returned to the original preparation instructions for the medicines, and instead of simplifying each separately, then comparing them, I did the reverse and found a solution to my problem. The resulting product, when compared to the original kits, not only reduced the number of steps for the preparation of each medicine, but also significantly decreased the number of separate parts needed for the process. In conclusion, I believe my hypothesis was correct in stating that a “universal” medical device could be invented to simplify the preparation of hemostatic agents for use in battlefield and emergency situations.

AERODYNAMICS OF WIND POWER
Jessica Stephanie Aquino
United Magnet of Engineering & Technology; Laredo, Texas (U.S.A)

United States and South America have strong wind energy available and have been developing projects for its utilization. The cost of wind energy is not present in all parts of earth, this happens because different weather and geographical factors. The wind energy utilization is basic a study about pressure or force on any surface. This is the first idea about it or to transfer the kinetic energy from air molecules in transit to some surface or blade. <br><br> Using these concept Wind turbines, like aircraft propeller blades, turn in the moving air and power an electric generator, which supplies an electric current. Modern wind turbines fall into two basic groups; the horizontal-axis variety, like the traditional farm windmills used for pumping water; and the vertical-axis design, like the eggbeater-style Darrieus model, named after its French inventor. Modern wind technology takes advantage of advances in materials, engineering, electronics, and aerodynamics. Wind turbines are often grouped together into a single wind power plant, also known as a wind farm, and generate bulk electrical power. Electricity from these turbines is fed into the local utility grid and distribute to customers jsut as it is with conventional power plants. What if we were to change the shape of the propeller blade? Would there be a difference in the amount of energy the windmills would supply? Aerodynamics does make a difference when it comes to testing the amount of energy a windmill will supply. The windmill that worked the best was the windmill in the shape of triangular blades.

DEVELOPING ATMOSPHERIC RESPONSIVENESS FOR A ROBOTIC HOT AIR BALLOON
Gabriel Carson Elder
Highland High School, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA

Human pilots have flown hot air balloons since their advent. The pilot controls the balloon through a burner system, which heats air inside the envelope. By controlling the heat of the envelope, the pilot controls the lift, and altitude of the balloon. This project aims to replace the human pilot in control of the balloon with a computer while retaining all principles of flight. The electronic systems of a 1/4-scale hot air balloon developed as part of this project rely on an array of sensors to accomplish this task. By implementing temperature sensors, an altimeter, and an advanced computer algorithm, the robotic balloon is able to react to atmospheric changes and fly without human control. <br><br> The first portion of this project was the development of the hardware and software systems necessary to achieve autonomous flight. One by one, sensors, communication devices, and the controls of the balloon were integrated into the system. Each device plays a key role in the operation of the balloon and flight analysis. Temperature sensors gather data used to calculate lift. An altimeter provides the balloon with essential altitude data used to guide the balloon. An electronic servo operates the burner system of the balloon. Finally, a wireless link transmits this data to a laptop computer.<br><br> After completing several autonomous flights, the balloon has shown its ability to consistently fly without human control. This system, with applications in aerial surveillance, atmospheric data collection, or geographic studies, has proven to be feasible and comprehensive.<br><br>

DEVELOPMENT OF A PLANAR PERFUSED TUMOR BIOREACTOR
Lucas Hudson Hofmeister
MLKing Academic Magnet, Nashville TN, USA

To advance in vitro cancer research I have designed and developed a three dimensional bioreactor that simulates the in vivo environment by creating a capillary bed to be coated with endothelial cells for very precise experiments. One crucial aspect of cancer research is the study of the interaction between tumor cells and stromal cells and the host during tumorigenesis and extravasation. I seek to learn how tumor cells and fibroblasts coordinate the recruitment of circulating immune cells(leukocytes and monocytes).<br><br> Preliminary testing of the device included the growth of cells in the bioreactor, and subsequent testing them for things such as polarization. Initial tests also included testing the flow rates in the bioreactor by monitoring the movement of fluorescent beads in solution. In order to facilitate cellular growth on PDMS, Poly-d-lysine is used to coat the bioreactor surface. Once the desired cellular behavior is achieved, I will attempt to reproduce the results from a previous experiment performed in a transwell tissue culture system by introducing immune cells in one set of channels, and the introduction of a chemokine into the other side of the perfused bioreactor system. The reaction of the immune cells as they are recruited and migrate across the endothelial membrane can then be observed. A tumor mass may also be grown in an alternate bioreactor design, and its recruitment of immune cells carefully monitored. <br><br> These tests showed that flows in the bioreactor behaved as expected from calculations. These tests also insured that the IL-mec cells could remain adhered to the surface under high flow rates, as well as mimick their physiological behavior. From these works we can conclude that it will be possible to fabricate and apply the engineered planar perfused tumor bioreactor. The planar perfused bioreactor will be an effective tool for in vitro cancer research, specifically for the study of leukocyte transendothelial migration.

PREPARATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF A SUPERPARAMAGNETIC POLYMER NANOCOMPOSITE FOR BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS
Nicole Rachelle Brenner
Lawrence High School, Cedarhurst, NY, USA

A moldable biocompatible magnetic polymer has been created for the first time. Magnetic nanocomposites of FDA-approved polymers Polymethylmethacrylate(PMMA)+Clay20A+Fe2O3 and Ethylene vinyl acetate(EVA)+Clay20A+ Fe2O3 were developed by reacting clay20A with Fe(CO)5 and then brabending the clay-iron mixture within the polymers.<br><br> Transmission Electron Microscopy of the nanocomposite shows evenly distributed Fe2O3 on exfoliated clay platelets within PMMA. An average iron-oxide nanoparticle diameter of 3.28 + 0.8 nanometers was measured. Vibrating Sample Magnetometry (VSM) revealed superparamagnetism, especially of brabended composites. Mossbauer spectroscopy determined Fe oxidation is +3 and corroborated VSM paramagnetism via symmetrical peaks. Thermogravimetric Analysis showed a reduced rate of decomposition in the materials containing iron-oxide as compared to PMMA+clay20A without Fe2O3. Dynamic Mechanical Analysis revealed decreases in modulus (37% with EVA, 11% for PMMA) for both polymer+clay+Fe2O3 nanocomposites. A cytotoxicity assay determined non-toxicity of materials 24 hours after cell plating. Osteoblasts were plated onto the composites and analyzed after four days of incubation. Cell proliferation on the iron-oxide nanocomposites increased by double to triple the amount as compared to the controls (polymer and polymer+clay20A). <br><br> These nanocomposites hold great promise for use in prosthetic joints and nonunions as a modality to enhance bone growth through the utilization of magnetic fields. <br><br>

THE MANY SIDES OF STRENGTH?
Shannon Lee Klein
Wishek Public School, Wishek ND, United States of America

Vaulted arches are used in almost every building providing slanted surfaces that shed precipitation and other elements. However as I studied vaulted arches I observed two main variations the number of sides and the vertical dimensions. I was therefore inspired to test these vaulted arches and find which vaulted arch is the most efficient in both Standard and Linear Structural Efficiency tests. To start my experiment I created 5 each of 7.5cm vertical dimensioned 2,3,4,5,6, and 7-sided vaulted arches using the formula, Degree Joint Angles = 180 /(Number of Sides x 2). I also created 5 each of 3.75cm vertically dimensioned 2,3,4,5,6, and 7-sided vaulted arches. I then recorded the mass of each vaulted arch for later use in calculating the structural efficiencies. Next I proceeded to place the vaulted arches on a preformed apparatus, with bank supports and braced sides, one at a time and added weight directly in the center starting at 4 kg, a weight that all arches were capable of holding, and adding weight at 500 gram intervals until each arch gave way. After the experimentation I calculated the Linear and Standard Structural Efficiency of each vaulted arch. What I found was that the 6-sidded 3.75cm vertically dimensioned vaulted arch had the greatest linear and standard structural efficiency, and so the arch that you would want. However I also found that the 7-sided 3.75cm vertically dimensioned vaulted arch came in a close second and therefore would also recommend as a possible alternative to the 6-sidded variation.

THE USE OF CONDUCTIVE CONCRETE IN DEICING AND CATHODIC PROTECTION OF BRIDGES
Alyssa Renee Jenkins
Kalamazoo Area Mathematics and Science Center, Kalamazoo Michigan, United States

The goal of this research experiment was to test the effectiveness of the different uses of conductive concrete. Due to the worsening state of many of our nation’s bridges and roadways, there is an increasing need for preventative action against further deterioration. Conductive concrete has the potential to replace corrosive deicing chemicals as well as provide Cathodic Protection to reinforcing steel in bridges. <br><br>Conductive concrete is a concrete mixture containing conductive materials causing it to conduct electricity when hooked up to a power source. An experiment was conducted in order to determine the heat produced by the conductive concrete through resistance over a period of time. Another experiment was aimed to verify that the requirements for an effective Cathodic Protection system were met. The conductive concrete showed both a positive correlation between time and heat increase and met the requirements for a Cathodic Protection system, proving it to be an effective solution in those areas for our bridges and roadways.<br><br>

BENDING SPACETIME IN THE BASEMENT
Maria Kathleen LaGasse
Rome Catholic School, Rome N.Y., USA

The purpose of my experiment is to create a device based off that of Henry Cavendish’s. I do not want to copy his experiment fully but want to incorporate modern techniques into it to try to better it. I hope to, with this newly improved torsion balance, measure the gravitational constant. My hypothesis is that the balance will rotate towards the other objects and my device will show gravitational attraction. I don’t think my results will be as accurate as Henry Cavendish’s but feel that they will come close.<br><br> In my experiment I have a Plexiglas box set up with a balance supported and attached to the box’s top. On either side of the balance are 2 nonmagnetic and dense weights of equal mass. Fixed on one side of the balance is a mirror and attached to the side of the box is a laser pointer pointed directly at the mirror. I then fixed the laser so that it reflected straight back at itself. On either side of the balance, somewhat perpendicular to it are two more nonmagnetic, dense weights of equal mass sitting on foam boxes. <br><br> Using this apparatus and the formula F=GmM/d^2 I found the gravitational constant. I found it to be 1.9388 X 10^-6 N-m^2/kg^2. The accepted value of the gravitational constant is 6.670 X 10^-11 N-m^2/kg^2. I was considerably off on my calculations and I concluded that my hypothesis was somewhat correct but due to other underlying variables I was considerably off of the expected outcome.<br><br>

DEVELOPMENT AND DESIGN OF AN ALL TERRIAN, OMNIDIRECTIONAL PLATFORM WITH OBSTACLE CLIMBING CAPABILITIES.
Christopher Jon Olsen
Valley Central High School Montgomery, NY, USA

Many people throughout the world have physical handicaps that confine them to wheelchairs. Although these mobile platforms allow their users to achieve a basic level of freedom, no one wants their independence to be controlled by the limits of a mechanical device. Unfortunately, even the most advanced wheelchairs can be stopped by a curb or small obstacle, and their maneuverability in tight spaces is severely restricted by their physical configuration. These limitations not only affect the freedom of the user but make it impossible for the chair to function in an intuitive manner. As a result, this study was an attempt to develop a wheelchair that can function in all environments, and provide the natural movement patterns that we take for granted, so that the people who are forced to rely on them as their only means of mobility can focus their energy on where they're going and not how they're getting there. The unique articulated wheel system that was developed not only allows for true omnidirectional motion, but through a system of rotary and linear actuators, allows the wheel pairs to act in a coordinated stepping action when presented with curbs and other obstacles. A scaled prototype of the system was built and tested on a variety of simulated terrain types. The new device proved able to negotiate irregular surfaces, climb curbs and steps, and move in any direction at will, providing the basis for an assistive platform that more closely approaches the natural capabilities that non-disabled people enjoy.

ENHANCING AUTONOMOUS NAVIGATION CAPABILITIES OF A ROBOT
Thomas Lyle Wentz
Wentz-Simmons Homeschool, Silver City, NM, USA

The purpose of this project was to build and compare a robot that uses only obstacle avoidance to a robot that uses obstacle avoidance combined with goal seeking for autonomous navigation. This type of research is useful for developing robots to be used at disaster sites, war zones, and hazardous areas of exploration. A simple roving robot was built and equipped with a light sensor and five ultrasonic rangefinders and programmed in two configurations---one with obstacle avoidance only (Robot 1) and the other with obstacle avoidance and light seeking (Robot 2). Each robot was tested 18 times in two arenas, one arena more difficult than the other in design. The robots’ actions in the arenas were observed and counted. Each robot had to complete an arena within 10 minutes, and if the robot completed the arena early, the completion time was recorded. The performance of the robot that incorporated both light seeking and obstacle avoidance behaviors was more consistent than the one with obstacle avoidance only. It completed both arenas a higher percentage of the time, ran into and moved walls less, and did not get stuck as much but was slower because it had to pause for light seeking. Neither robot damaged itself significantly. Further research could include alternate forms of goal seeking and obstacle avoidance as well as incorporating bounded-autonomy on a more mobile robot chassis.

CAN NANO-TECHNOLOGY SOLVE THE PRODUCED WATER PROBLEM
Brittni Briann Romero
Socorro High Sc hool, Socorro, NM, U.S.A

<br><br>New Mexico produces over 100 million barrels of contaminated water each year. This water comes from active oil and gas wells and is referred to as produced water. This produced water is contaminated with salts and hydrocarbons. In this water the concentrations of the total dissolved solids (TDS) ranged from 18,000 to 180,000 ppm. This research addresses the possibility of using produced water for irrigation. A nano-technology membrane is capable of remediating some of the produced water to a level acceptable for irrigation. The heavily contaminated water is not acceptable for irrigation after the reverse osmosis process. The migration of the salt ions past the nano-technology membrane can be attributed to a number of phenomena. One such phenomenon is imperfections in the crystal structure of the membrane. No one has measured the extent of these imperfections. Monte Carlo analysis was used to determine the distribution of the imperfections in the nano-technology membrane by testing various imperfection distributions versus the measure performance. The result of the Monte Carlo analysis is the first attempt at characterizing the imperfections within the nano-technology membrane. It is possible to improve the performance of the nano-technology membrane by reducing the fluctuation in the imperfection distribution.<br><br>

How does the rate of spin affect how much a baseball curves through the air? <br><br>This experiment tested the hypothesis that the higher the rate of spin, the larger curve. The steps conducted included: 1)assembled the model, using a 1 x 12 board, 6 floral hangers, fine wire, and rubber bands. 2) suspended the baseball with the rubber bands so that it hung straight and didn't spin. 3) twist the ball 15 times. 4) a)Stood directly over the intersection of the wire, 10 cm above the wire. b) Observed from 45 degree angle and 30 cm from the edge of the board 4) Let go of the ball and marked its farthest point out from the center. 5) Recorded the data in seperate tables for part A and B. <br><br>6) Repeated at least 5 times at 15, 25 and 40 rotaions. The results from this experiment supported the hypothesis. At 15 rotations the average movement was .762 cm. At 25 rotations the average was 1.0795 cm. At 40 rotations the average was 1.4605 cm. In conclusion, the faster the rate of spin will equal a greater affect on the movement of the baseball.

BIOMIMETICS: EMULATING NATURE
Nathanael James Macias
John L Chapin High School, El Paso, Texas, United States

Biomimetics is the study of nature to create better machines. The purpose of this project was to explore Biomimetics through the development of a robotic ant that emulated the ant’s movement and sensory functions. <br><br> To create this robot, I utilized a printed circuit board. This circuit board controlled the movement of the robot. Flexinol wire (muscle wire) provided the robot with the ability to move. The flexinol’s wire unique ability to contract and expand like real muscle, allowed the robot to be small, compact, and light. A push button was utilized to interrupt the electrical signal being sent from the circuit board to the legs of the robot. <br><br> The only two successful runs were 12 and 13. After, trail number 13 the robot did not detect the object. While reinstalling the muscle wire a leg was bent, causing the leg to be higher than the rest, considerably slowing the robot down. <br><br> It is possible to create a robot that mimics an ant’s sensory functions and movement. However the pushbutton I used was not sensitive enough to detect the object frequently when the robot ran into it. An ultrasonic sensor though would have been more efficient. <br><br> <br><br>

INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION EXPERIMENT TO MEASURE EFFECTS OF ATOMIC OXYGEN ON SPACECRAFT MATERIALS
Lily Roberts, Catherine McCarthy
Hathaway Brown School, Shaker Heights OH, USA

One of the most detrimental effects of low Earth orbit (LEO) exposure on spacecraft materials is atomic oxygen (AO) erosion. Therefore, in order to design high-performance spacecraft, the AO erosion yield of polymers being considered for spacecraft applications must be understood.<br><br> Forty-one PEACE (Polymer Erosion and Contamination Experiment) Polymers were exposed to the LEO environment for four years on the exterior of the International Space Station (ISS). The purpose was to obtain mass loss and fluence measurements to calculate AO erosion yield values for a wide variety of polymers. <br><br> Erosion yield values for each polymer were computed based on mass loss due to space exposure, density, exposed area, and AO fluence in LEO. In addition, error analyses were conducted to determine the fractional uncertainty in each erosion yield value.<br><br> Erosion yield values were determined for 35 of the PEACE Polymers. For the other six, the actual erosion yield was greater than the calculated value because the AO eroded through all the layers of the polymer.<br><br> The PEACE Polymers experiment is unique because it includes the widest variety of polymers ever exposed to identical LEO conditions for a long period of time. Therefore, these erosion yield data are extremely valuable for future spacecraft design.<br><br>

INSULATION NATION
Robert Joseph Brust, Luis Salinas, 
Del Rio Freshman School, Del Rio, TX

Insulation Nation is a project that is used to determine temperature changes from an empty box, which is placed in a freezer, to a box lined with insulation, which is also subjected to the same temperature. Our hypothesis is that the box with double the insulation will have double R- Value, therby cutting the temperature in half.<br><br> We started out be coming up with the materials we were going to need to perform our experiment. We needed 6 boards of wood that had a length of 19 inches and a height of 11.5 cm. We also needed 24 screws and several hinges, caulking, 2 large sheets of insulation that were a centimeter thick, and a thermometer. We constructed the box in which we were going to perform our study. The boxes original temperature was 60°F. We then placed the box inside of the freezer which had a temperature of 32°F. We then would check the temperature every 5 minutes. After checking the temperature, we would then add a layer of insulation to the box. We repeated this method 4 times until we had gathered our goal information. This project had several variables like the temperature the boxes were going to be exposed to, and the number of layers that were going to be placed inside of the box. Another variable is the time spent inside of the freezer, which was 30 minutes.<br><br> The results were better than we had expected. Everytime we doubled the insulation in our box, the heatloss was cut in half and then some. So in the end our hypothesis was correct.

MAXIMIZING STRUCTURAL EFFICIENCY THROUGH MATERIAL ANALYSES
Nathan Phillip Van Winkle, Riley Hickman, 
Liberty High School, Hillsboro, OR

This project is focused in analysis of the material properties of wood and their application to maximizing the strength to weight efficiency ratio of a cantilever structure. This cantilever structure must support a static load of up to 15kg, 40 cm away from fixed attachment base. Structural efficiency was defined as the maximum load supported at failure divided by the structure’s mass. This efficiency score was used to compare structures. Wood was tested in a compression load frame, its deflection and failure strength measured. Intrinsic wood properties such as for moisture content, grain width, and density were measured. Mechanical property testing data was used to calculate the elastic constant. Euler’s formula was employed to examine buckling criteria of compression members. Twenty species of woods were examined, along with five adhesives. The data was examined for properties most in applicable to the design of the structure.<br><br> Particularly relationships between; density and load, efficiency and elasticity, grain width and load, and moisture content and efficiency where found to be prevalent. These relationships where applied in the construction of test structures, with the best glue for fastening; determined by testing. Structures where constructed, analyzed and improved through the use of Euler’s formula and mechanical properties data. . Grain continuity was identified as a major factor for the supportable load of a member. The resulting structure using woods and glues, with properties of low weight and high strength, had an efficiency of 1500+, constructed of 9.3g of wood, and withstood a 15kg static load.

THE BRIDGE PROJECT
Lewis Glendal Owens, Alvaro Lopez, Stephen Cantu
Del Rio High School, Del Rio,Tx, UNITED STATES

The bridge project was made to see which bridge out of the four chosen: Girder, Arch, Truss, and Rigid frame, would have the highest efficiency when put to the test. Through a series of procedures, it is possible to find out the exact efficiency of each bridge. First you must gather all the materials necessary in order to begin. We made each bridge as closely related to the actual bridge as possible. After the bridges are complete weigh them. Then one by one test them. The way you test the bridges is by placing the eight inch block on the roadway, and pull on it with a fishing scale to see how much weight it can hold before collapsing. Next find the efficiency of each bridge by dividing the amount it held up y the amount it weighed. At the end of the project, we found out that not only did the Girder Bridge support the most weight, but also had the highest efficiency in doing so. The Truss Bridge was the second place holder who had the second highest efficiency and held the second most weight. The Arch Bridge was the third spot holder who had the third highest efficiency and that held the third most weight. Lastly the Rigid Frame Bridge came in last. Not only did it have the lowest efficiency, but also held the least amount of weight. In the end the Girder Bridge was the most efficient with an efficiency of 182.02.

ENGINEERING AND TESTING A HYBRID GASOLINE ELECTRIC VEHICLE
Ryan Marcus Young, Elliott Belden
Winona Senior High School, Winona, MN, USA

In recent years, auto manufacturers have been developing cars that utilize a hybrid drive system using an electric motor to supplement a gasoline engine. Because of the growing popularity and environmental and economic benefits of hybrid gasoline with electric assist vehicles, the purpose of this project is to explore the feasibility, practicality, and benefits of a hybrid drive system based on an electric drive motor with gasoline recharging system. After designing, constructing, and testing our hybrid electric drive vehicle, we can conclude that most of the engineering goals were achieved. The vehicle construction goals of utilizing an aluminum frame and an integrated safety roll cage were both met in the construction of the vehicle’s frame. The vehicle specifications were also met as the vehicle successfully can transport the weight of one person during driving and the body shell achieved a low coefficient of drag during wind tunnel testing. The electric drive and gasoline recharging system were tremendously successful at increasing the power output, also fulfilling our engineering goal of a primarily electric hybrid drive system. The drive system was able to convert the 2.5 hp and .2 ft/lbs torque the gasoline engine generates into the 1.9 hp and 12.6 ft/lbs torque put out by the electric motor, indicating that the electric drive/gas recharge drive system has many potential uses. Because of the silent running, low heat signature, and high torque output of the electric drive system, this type of hybrid system is ideal for military applications where stealth is important.

NEAR INFRARED UPCONVERSION PHOSPHORS FOR BIOMEDICAL IMAGING
Matthew Raigosa, David Ortiz, 
Weslaco East High School, Weslaco, TX

Imaging of living tissue is a major challenge in modern biomedical science. Near infrared light (NIR) is promising because it can penetrate tissue effectively. Upconversion luminescence is the process of a gadolinium oxide absorbing infrared photons, combining two, and emitting one red photon. The problem that was addressed was whether the upconversion luminescence properties of samarium doped gadolinium oxide phosphor could be used to image specific portions of living tissue. The phosphor was prepared by precipitation from a solution of mixed nitrates, followed by calcining at 800°C and grinding and sorting by size. Imaging experiments were carried out in the digestive system of freshwater snail. Our results indicate that this imaging method can be useful in diverse living tissues. The pottions of the digestive system were imaged through the use this method.

THE ROAD BEST TRAVELED
Ross Maxwell, Mathew Smart
Del Rio High School, Del Rio, TX, USA

The purpose of our project was to determine what form or soil reinforcement helps to keep a raised terrace in place with the least compacting, no additions to the terrace, layered mats (geogrids) or a retaining wall. Our hypothesis was that the dirt pile with retaining walls would hold up better than the other two dirt piles. To perform our experiment, we built three piles of dirt with the same dimensions. We put four layers of mats into one pile, built retaining walls on the second pile, and made no additions to the third pile. A piece of pipe was put through the center of each pile to measure the height as it compacted and spread. We then used an ATV to drive over each pile for ten minutes for 93 days. Marks were made on the pipes to record the height of the dirt piles. After 93 days, the control pile of dirt had dropped from 24 to 21 inches. The dirt pile with the layered geogrids had dropped from 24 to 22 3/4 inches. The dirt pile with the retaining walls had dropped from 24 to 22 inches. Our results showed that the pile with the layered mats had the least spreading and compacting. Although the retaining walls did not allow the dirt to spread, the weight of the ATV in one spot caused the pile to compact. The mats allowed for minimal spreading and distributed the weight of the ATV at each layer, preventing the pile from compacting.

ENHANCING HYDRODYNAMIC PERFORMANCE
Adam Kelby Mitchell, Bradley Allen Odell
Muskogee High School, Muskogee, Oklahoma, United States

This experiment is designed to increase the efficiency of movement on or in water by means of compressed air being pumped through a perforated hull. As a body moves through a fluid, interaction between the two forces causes the body to lose acceleration. Due to the viscosity of the fluid, in this case water, a certain amount of drag is placed upon the body in motion. We hope to reduce the amount of drag caused by friction, by separating water from the hull of a vessel with a fluid that has less viscosity. <br><br>To perform our experiment we constructed a large testing apparatus to accurately display the amount of drag on two model boats. We created a current in the lower portion of the box that forced back each model boat to display the amount of drag created by movement over water on a visible gram scale.<br><br>After recording the results of multiple tests, we found that the modified bodies’ performance was superior to that of the unaltered. From our results, we concluded that forcing air through the boat’s hull while the boat was in a current separated some amount of water from the surface of the boat. This displacement of water in turn reduced the amount of drag on the boat. As a result, the model boat with the perforated hull pulled less grams than the unaltered boat on every test where conditions where the same.<br><br>

SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIMENTS TO EVALUATE ATOMIC OXYGEN AND ULTRA-VIOLET RADIATION DAMAGE TO MANMADE MATERIALS IN LOW EARTH ORBIT
Maura C. Lillis, Christiane A. Youngstrom, Allison L. Rapoport
Hathaway Brown School, Shaker Heights, OH, USA

Atomic oxygen (AO), a natural species in earth?s atmosphere, is formed when ultraviolet rays photo-dissociate oxygen molecules. It erodes functional polymeric surfaces of spacecraft. A series of space experiments was designed and implemented to address this. In a team collaboration spanning five years, each year addresses a different aspect. Current experimental design included testing 41 polymers for their AO erosion yields. These materials were selected for the 2001 Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE 2) for a 1.5-year exposure to AO and ultraviolet (UV) radiation from their current location mounted on the exterior of International Space Station (ISS). Additionally, another set of polymers, MISSE 5, will be sent to ISS in 2003 for one-year exposure to AO only. Current research objectives are: 1) Design second experiment (MISSE 5) to evaluate only AO erosion of polymers in LEO; 2) Perfect novel techniques required for analysis of all polymers; 3) Prepare second experiment for flight; 4) Perform qualitative post-exposure analysis of experiment launched in 2001. Data obtained in this current research year includes the perfection of salt and mica dusting to facilitate erosional measurement. The 53 samples of MISSE 5 have undergone fabrication and characterization for launch, possibly in the summer of 2003. Additional data obtained thus far is the on-orbit observational analyses of MISSE 2 samples on ISS. Of the 41 samples, approximately 22 samples appear to have been either eroded or UV darkened. The international space community awaits the publication of this data for consideration in the design of new materials to be flown in LEO.

FAST ROPE DESCENT SYSTEM (FRODS)
Kurt Alfred Brendley, Omar Bohsali
McLean High School, McLean, Virginia, USA

Fast-roping is a means for soldiers to quickly descend from aircrafts. The approach also produces many injuries, some even fatal. The Fast Rope Descent System (FRODS) is a device that greatly enhances both safety and speed of descent, while reducing production and life cycle costs. Since many soldiers simultaneously use a fast rope, designing a working FRODS is challenging due to the unprecedented weight range on the working side of the rope – from nearly zero to many hundreds of pounds. Five FRODS configurations were tested by dropping a 10-pound weight from a height of thirty feet multiple times. System performance was modeled based on the capstan equation. Dependent variables – device drop velocity and acceleration – were measured using a digital encoder and a stopwatch. Four of the five devices performed poorly, either dropping too fast or too slow as weight on the working end was varied from 0 to 50 pounds. In the fifth prototype, the interior nodes of FRODS were spring-loaded. This provided sufficient dynamic range of motion for FRODS to descend the suspended weight at controlled speeds throughout the entire dynamic range of working end loads. For the fifth device, drop speeds varied from 1 ft per second (slow descend) to 10 ft per second (fast descend). The modeled data was, in all cases, within one standard deviation of the mean of the experimental data. The final results showed that FRODS would enable a soldier and equipment to safely descend, even should the soldier become injured.

USING INTERSECTING DIFFERENTIAL TANGENT LINES TO INVESTIGATE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF PARABOLIC BOW WAVES
Franklin James Parker, Ryne Marcus Kahan
Mason High School, Mason, Texas, USA

The purpose of this project was to study how the parabolic bow-waves of boats can indicate various capabilities of differing hull designs. Four hull designs were cut from 2x4 yellow pine, sanded and painted. A tow tank was designed, set up, and each hull model was photographed at speeds including one mps, 0.75 mps, 0.5 mps, and 0.25 mps. After being tested, 20% weight was added to each hull, then tested and photographed again. Also, a mathematical model was built (ideas were formed and described with formulae—all of which were proven independently) for use in analyzation of the parabolic bow-waves. The three mathematical characteristics were: the distance from origin to point of linear-tangental intersection, the angle of linear-tangental intersection, and the area between the tangent lines and parabola. The results from these characters were used to draw conclusions about the capabilities of each hull. Each hull was found to have its own unique advantages and disadvantages. The futuristic, Zumwalt design, was found to be the most efficient design at higher speeds, but it was also the most unstable and fluctuated greatly with the addition of weight. The tanker design sacrificed speed and efficiency for stability and weight-carrying capacity. The straight and curved bow designs performed very similarly in most areas, except with the weight addition at higher speeds. This project gives a greater understanding of maritime engineering because of its novel way of studying water disturbance in relation to hull design.

ENGINEERING SOFTWARE TO DIGITALLY ANALYZE GENETIC TESTS FOR HPV
Stephen Walter Trusheim, Daniel Mokhtari, 
Breck School, Minneapolis, MN

Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common cause of cervical cancer in women; however, current methods for diagnosing types of HPV are time-consuming and expensive. Our goal was to develop software that automates the process of diagnosing gel-electrophoresis genetic tests for HPV. Our software implemented five algorithms to quantitatively analyze gel images:<br><br> - An algorithm to vertically orient a gel;<br><br> - An algorithm to determine the boundaries of gel lanes;<br><br> - An algorithm to decrease background noise;<br><br> - An algorithm to determine the base-pair location of DNA bands on the gel image; and<br><br> - An algorithm to correlate the base-pair locations of DNA bands on the gel with a database of HPV types to diagnose the type of HPV a patient has.<br><br> Our program accurately diagnosed possible types of HPV within the top five most highly correlated options in 47% of cases analyzed, and accurately diagnosed the actual type of HPV that a patient had in 19% of cases. In the future, we will program a three-dimensional model to increase accuracy of HPV identification. Our research forms the basis of an exciting new model for genetic testing that will decrease the cost of analyzing genetic tests and provide more objective and more immediate results to patients.

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF ANTENNA GENERATION USING GENETIC ALGORITHMS AND POLYNOMIAL COMPONENT OPTIMIZATION
James Henry Notwell, Andrew Duchi, Erich Kreutzer
Upper Arlington High School, Upper Arlington, Ohio, United States

The purpose of this project is to compare two methods of optimization--genetic algorithms and polynomial component optimization. The engineering goals are to first build a 6-element Yagi antenna capable of interfacing with the cell phone grid; second, to create an optimized antenna with genetic algorithms; third, to create an optimized antenna with polynomial component optimization; and finally, to compare the two optimized antennas. Five starting antennas will be produced using previously discovered equations to define the lengths of the reflector and driven element, as well as the distance between these elements. The lengths of the other elements and the distances between them will be pseudo-randomly generated. The performance of each antenna will be evaluated and these data will be used in the genetic algorithms and the polynomial component optimization. These processes will produce antennas designed to produce more directional gain. The directional gains, measured directly in front of the antennas, produced by each of the original antenna are: 6.23 dBi, 3.37 dBi, 2.95 dBi, 3.49 dBi, and 1.65 dBi. These were used to create two optimized antennas; genetic algorithms produced an antenna with a directional gain of 12.05 dBi while the polynomial analysis produced an antenna with a directional gain of 7.18 dBi. With these results, the engineering goals have been reached. An antenna generated using a standard formula for creation of a Yagi antenna produced a directional gain of 6.97 dBi. Thus both the genetic algorithm and the polynomial component optimization techniques surpassed the performance of a standard Yagi antenna.

THE OPTIMIZATION OF A MICROBIAL FUEL CELL
Damien Walsh, Sam Sohlden, 
Sycamore High School, Cincinnati, OH

The purpose of these experiments was to understand how differing environmental conditions, specifically the presence versus absence of oxygen or nitrate, affect the biofilm formation by the metabolically versatile bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We also tested the biofilm forming capacity of four isogenic mutants that are predicted to enhance the electrigenic properties of this organism in a microbial fuel cell (MFC). The mutants: (i) overproduce electronically conductive polar pili (D pilT), (ii) limit electron flow through the anaerobic respiratory pathway, (D nirS), (iii) are unable to disperse from biofilms once they are attached, D bdlA), and (iv) have an impaired ability to undergo cell-cell communication that limits polysaccharide production in biofilms, (D lasI), respectively. <br><br>The results of the glass tube experiment did positively determine that it is possible to regulate gene expression through environmental conditions (growth surface, nitrate, and aerobic/anaerobic). Results have also shown that it is possible to determine which genetic mutations enhance biofilm production. It was observed that the lasI mutation showed the highest biofilm formation using a glass growth surface under anaerobic conditions. Since we now know which genetic mutants produce a higher amount of biofilm the next step would be to test how these mutants perform in a microbial fuel cell. In conclusion, we supported our hypothesis by demonstrating that differing mutations directly effect biofilm formation, when exposed to different environmental conditions.<br><br>

A STRAIGHT FLIGHT TO THE TOP: PHASE THREE
David Kenneth Wagner, Paul Andrew Lopez
J.M. Hanks High School, El Paso, Texas, United Sates of America

The reason for this project, and the two projects of the past two years, was to design, create and make our own amateur missile. This years project is centered more on what type of body will do best for a missile we ourselves can control. Our problem was, what design would be most efficient in speed, height and distance. We built 6 missiles, 3 of the design that did best last year (a quickly tapered missile), and 3 of a new design we came up with this year (a slowly tapered missile). Our hypothesis was that we thought that the slowly tapered rocket would perform better. After building the missiles we went to the outskirts of El Paso, Texas to Horizon City. There in the desert area, we launched our missiles at precisely a 16-degree angle. We recorded the height, distance and speed the missiles flew at after we launched each of them. From our data we took an average and learned that the fast tapered body flew at a distance of 724.00ft a height of 228.66m and a speed of 75.246ft per second. The slowly tapered flew at a distance of 730.66ft a height of 349.66m and a speed of 71.494ft per second. By the results we were able to clearly see the slowly tapered did better than the quickly tapered missile. WE learned that our hypothesis was correct, the new design did in-fact out perform last years design.

The goal of the Iris engineering project was to create a mobile robot that replicates animal behavior in the sense of self-preservation with optimal efficiency. Specifically, it was necessary for the robot to be able to seek out and obtain light energy to be converted and stored as electrical energy. It would also have to defend itself from possible threats. Based upon the determination that light would be the easiest obtainable energy source, energy searching and collection was focused accordingly. As a means of control, logic, and information processing, a Basic Stamp microcontroller was employed in conjunction with a controller board. A body was created out of .10 in. thick acrylic, for its light weight and strength. To accomplish the task of determining where the highest concentration of energy was sourced, light-to-frequency converters were interfaced with the controller board. A 4.8V 500mAh battery pack was interfaced with the controller board as a means of storing energy. Two 7.2V solar cells @ 100mAh each were wired to the battery pack in parallel in order to collect energy. An infrared proximity detector circuit was also wired to the controller board as a means of object avoidance. Two miniature yet powerful servo motors were used to obtain optimal power and speed, while minimizing current drain. A defensive spike mechanism was created, taking into consideration electrical efficiency. The Basic Stamp microcontroller working together, these separate parts allow for the Iris robot to function autonomously, both collecting its own energy and defending itself from attack.

For centuries, throughout times with no rain, the rusty old windmill was the only salvation for farmers and ranchers. With the coming of technology, windmills have slowly become obsolete. The main engineering goal of this project was to convert an old style water pumping windmill into an energy producing wind turbine. <br><br>The idea was to convert an old style windmill’s principle of torque to the wind turbine’s principle of RPMs. The blades of the water pumping windmill spin at the speed of the wind and the blades of the turbine spin at 4 to 6 times the speed of the wind, so therefore a 4 to 1 ratio conversion was completed. <br><br> The bench test produced equivalent results, as compared to that of a wind turbine. The constructed 12 V alternator produced the average power of 100 W for 200 Ah, with a total of 2.5 kWh daily. However, the reading, when placed on the tower, showed the alternator produced less electricity due to the drag of the blades and gearing up. This test showed an average power of 68 W for 136 Ah, with a total of 1.7 kWh daily. These tests proved that the alternator accomplished the purpose of producing enough current to be efficient. <br><br>In conclusion, the charm of the old style windmill can still remain, if the rusty old windmill is converted to a more advanced wind turbine more useful to today’s farmers and ranchers.<br><br>

A NOVEL METHOD TO MEASURE THE SPEED OF SOUND IN THE CORNEA
Aman Sarup, Palak Patel
Ossining High School, Ossining, New York, U.S.A.

More than one million L.A.S.I.K. procedures were performed in the United States in 2004, and this number is growing rapidly. However, inaccurate measurement of corneal thickness prior to surgery has led to an 18% failure rate. The speed-of-sound in the cornea is of vital importance in ultrasonic determination of corneal thickness. This study developed a novel method to measure a more accurate speed-of-sound in the cornea in its physiological state and with varying hydration levels. Fresh corneas (N=38) were suspended in temperature regulated Dexsol preservation media and scanned at 35 MHz in different media concentrations at 33°C. The mean speeds-of-sound measured were 1605 M/Sec in 100% media, 1585.8 M/Sec in 75% media, 1581.3 M/Sec in 50% media, 1580.1 M/Sec in 25% media and 1571.7 M/Sec in 0% media (pure water) respectively. With increasing hydration, the corneal thickness increased, while the speed-of sound-decreased. (P<0.05) The calculated speed-of-sound in the cornea of 1605 M/Sec was found to significantly affect the calculated corneal thickness (p<0.001). The study further quantified the effect of corneal hydration on four ultrasonic properties (N=60). The most significant change in ultrasonic properties in relation to hydration was found to be in attenuation, with a Post-Hoc analysis confirming a statistically significant correlation between all hydration levels (P<0.001). This allowed the development of a mathematical model to detect the level of corneal hydration, making the determined speeds-of-sound for the particular hydration level directly applicable. The results of this study developed an improved method for measuring corneal thickness and can significantly reduce the growing failure rates of LASIK surgery.

ENGINEERING A CHIP BASED BIOSENSOR FOR PROTEINS AND PHOSPHATES

North Shore Hebrew Academy High School, Great Neck, NY

Biosensors today are expensive and impractical; therefore it is necessary to create a cheap, multi-functional sensor. The purpose of this project is to improve molecular imprinting so that in vivo use can soon become a reality. Molecular imprinting is a practical, efficient and cheap method for producing a sensor that can detect proteins for a wide array of applications, such as: clinical diagnostics, and detecting biological warfare agents. This project focuses on engineering a selective biosensor using Fibrinogen and Fibrin by means of two dimensional molecular imprinting into a self assembled monolayer (SAM). Physiological applications of the sensor tested were then tested using Cancer Markers such as Carcinoembryonic Antigen and Prostate Specific Antigen. These proteins were imprinted into a thiol SAM on a gold plated silicon wafer, enabling the sensor to detect the target analyte and differentiate between multiple proteins. This sensor was proven to only have an affinity toward the target analyte when Fibrinogen was imprinted; Fibrinogen gave an over 200% greater response than the cross tested Albumin and Fibrin. Due to the similar responses between the half sized imprinted chip and the full sized imprinted chip, it has been concluded that the sensor is small enough to be placed onto the end of an endoscope for in vivo utility. The target analyte was also tested within a solution of blood plasma. Positive results proved the specific selectivity of the biosensor for the target analyte among many other proteins.

IMPROVING THE FEASIBILITY OF AVALANCHE GAIN X-RAY DETECTORS
Elie Joshua Bochner, Shai Chester, 
Yeshiva University High School for Boys, New York, NY

Flat panel x-ray detectors for digital radiography have been used in the clinic for nearly a decade and enable the rapid acquisition of high-resolution x-ray images with excellent contrast. However, current detectors are optimized for imaging applications that use high detector entrance exposures to produce large signals capable of overcoming the electronic noise associated with the thin film transistor (TFT) readout process. A novel indirect x-ray detector concept, referred to as SHARP-AMFPI (Scintillator – High-Gain Avalanche Rushing Photoconductor), utilizes variable x-ray to charge conversion gain from a thin layer of amorphous selenium (a-Se) to create a detector compatible with multiple dosage radiographic procedures. However, variations in the TFT array’s surface topography result in non-uniform conversion gain, which dramatically decreases the quality of produced images. We propose to use thin-films of polyaniline (PANI-EB), an intrinsically conductive polymer, as a planarization layer between the a-Se and ITO pixel electrode on the TFT array. Using a contact angle measurement device, we determined the optimal cleaning method to improve the wetting of the ITO substrate with the PANI-EB solution. The surface topography and thicknesses of spun-cast PANI films on various substrates were measured with atomic force microscopy, and the attenuation of the film-covered substrate’s surface corrugation was similarly monitored. The results of this study suggest that polyaniline films could be utilized to planarize the TFT array in SHARP-AMFPI; however, further work is needed to determine if PANI thin films are best suited to create a flat-panel x-ray detector with variable gain.

NON-CLASSICAL WETTING BEHAVIOR OF VARIOUS LIQUIDS ON CARBON NANOTUBE SUBSTRATES
Anusuya Meenakshi Ramasubramanian, Hung-Bing Tan, Benjamin Wang
William G. Enloe High School, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA

The efficient transport of small volumes of fluid through microchannels has become increasingly important with the emergence of new microfluidic technologies. Multiwalled Carbon Nanotube (MWCNT) substrates offer a significant potential for use as a lining for micro-pipes since they were found to exhibit large contact angles for water, implying low adhesive forces along the interface. Further, systematic empirical studies of contact angle as a function of surface tension energies of various pure liquids and glycerol-water mixtures indicate that the nature of liquid wetting on MWCNT substrates is non-classical; i.e., the wetting not only depends on the surface energy of the liquid but also on the liquid’s ability to resist interaction between the “stressed” pi-bonds of the MWCNTs and organize itself on the MWCNT surface. The surface energies of the MWCNT substrates were also determined using different theoretical models, offering an entirely new perspective on their wetting properties as related to their unique structure. Understanding the nature of contact angle, surface energy, and their relationship to the surface chemistry of MWCNTs, will allow these substrates to be used in various microfluidic applications including compact, low power microvalves and pumps in biology, lab-on-a-chip chemistry, and high-performance electronic cooling.

CONSTRUCTION OF A CONTRAST-ENHANCED BRAIN-MIMICKING HYDROGEL AND SIMULATION OF THE MECHANICAL EFFECTS OF IMPLANTABLE BRAIN ELECTRODES
Rohit Anish Ramani, Neil Pathak, 
Half Hollow Hills High School East, Dix Hills, NY

Implantable brain electrodes can be studied to restore motor function in paralyzed patients. Deformation induced around electrodes is believed to reduce their viability through the foreign body response. However, developing electrodes that minimize deformation is challenging because the mechanical aspects of deformation are poorly understood and non-animal tissue models for testing electrodes are unavailable. Development of pre-clinical models for testing electrodes can assist in understanding this clinical problem. This study had two objectives: 1) Development of a novel brain mimicking hydrogel using photopolymerizable polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer that contains alginate microspheres with enclosed gadolinium contrast agent. 2) Simulation of the electrode-tissue interface to analyze the mechanical effects induced by the electrode. The study used novel bulk metallic glass (BMG), a material more flexible than traditional metals for the simulation of the electrode. Our results indicated that BMG electrodes have great potential because they are able to bend in accordance to tissue displacement of the brain, thereby limiting deformation. We successfully constructed a novel brain mimicking hydrogel, and rheological testing showed that its elastic modulus was approximately 1.2 kPa, which is similar to that of a normal human brain. The model is beneficial because the hydrogel produced distinct bright spots on the MRI. The presence of isolated spots of brightness can facilitate the visualization of tissue deformation caused by electrode insertion via comparison of pre-insertion and post-insertion images. This brain-mimicking model has the potential for improving understanding of deformation of the brain from electrode implants to assist patients suffering from paralysis.

AN ANALYSIS OF THE WETTING PROPERTIES OF POLYCAPROLACTONE AND TECOPHILIC NANOFIBERS
Madhav Chopra, Kurtis Feng
Hoover High School. North Canton, Ohio, USA

Specially made nanofiber wound dressings are great contributions to the field of nanotechnology and medicine. However, these bandages are not equipped with non-wetting pads that prevent the bandages from sticking to the open wound. The main purpose of this experiment is to investigate the wetting properties of polycaprolactone and tecophilic nanofibers with respect to creating a hydrophobic pad for possible wound dressing applications. Polycaprolactone (PCL) and tecophilic are electrospun together in order to create an ideal hydrophobic surface. PCL is used because it is a biodegradable polymer that is widely used in the medical field. Likewise, tecophilic is an ideal polymer to use because it is also used in the medical field with very few possible allergic reactions from human beings. It is hypothesized that as one increases the gap distance of the electrospinning apparatus, the diameter of the nanofibers will decrease, which will result in a hydrophobic nanofiber mat. Static, advancing, and receding contact angles are measured with a contact angle machine in order to determine the degree of wettability. SEM images are taken to scrutinize the precise values of the different diameters of the nanofibers as a result of the varying gap distances. Overall, the data supported the hypothesis; there is an optimal range in the gap distance where the nanofibers had the greatest degree of hydrophobicity. Thusly, there is a strong potential that the material created can be used as a non-stick pad for nanofiber wound dressings or other non-wetting applications.

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TRIANGLE SIZE AND WIND RESISTANCE

Mason High School, Mason, TX, U.S.

This project in its present form is the result of experimentation with extreme wind blown on different sized triangles composing Geodesic Domes. The purpose was to see if the various sizes of the triangles, determines the level of survivability to withstand severe stress. By using an anemometer to measure wind speed, an air compressor, and a wind tunnel to hold the various sizes of domes, it was possible to document damage levels at certain variables of time. <br><br> Research and experimentation provided information leading to the assumption that the more complex the dome’s structure, the more structurally sound it is; therefore, the smaller the triangles the more stable it is. Because of its sleek design the small triangles in the dome produced a much greater degree of building survivability than the large triangles at all degrees of wind resistance and time.<br><br> Compared to the rectangle, of which most modern construction is based, the triangle is superior in all respects. With this comparison, one can clearly see the difference domes could make in building survivability, especially in frequent hurricane and tornado areas. One could also question if the cost of insurance would lessen with such a structurally sound building. <br><br> In all aspects, the geodesic dome, especially with the smaller triangles, provide a much more efficient structure. In the future, it can be assumed that the efficiency of the geodesic dome will shadow attractiveness, and domes will appear much more frequently throughout our society.<br><br>

CONTROLLING THE CRYSTALLIZATION PROPERTIES OF POLY[ETHYLENE OXIDE] THIN FILMS
Hatty Hong, Vivek Kuncham
Manhasset High School, Manhasset NY, USA , Wheatley, Old Westbury NY, USA

It has always been assumed that thin polymer film cannot crystallize due to confinement by the surface (Rabolt, 1996). In this study, we were able to refute this claim and show for the first time that in fact crystallization can be increased in a thin film, due to surface nucleation. The purpose was to investigate surface-induced crystallization of poly[ethylene oxide] in confined geometry of thin films and properties as a function of film thickness, surface nanopatterns, and nanoparticles. Melting point was also was tested as a function of film thickness, an important parameter that characterizes semi-crystalline polymers which has never before been measured in thin films. Nanopatterns and nanoparticles acted as nucleating agents, facilitating a greater degree of crystallization. Melting temperature depression and shear modulus decrease were observed with decreasing film thickness. Thin films will crystallize, however with properties different from the bulk material that can be controlled through nucleating agents in surface-induced crystallization.<br><br>

CHARACTERIZATION OF A SYNTHETIC MICROBIAL PATHWAY FOR THE PRODUCTION OF BIOPLASTICS
Shuo Cory Li, Mingjuan Lisa Zhang, 
North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, Durham, NC

With rising fuel prices and increasing environmental waste, attention has turned from petroleum-based plastics to renewable and biodegradable alternatives, specifically bacterially synthesized bioplastics (polyhydroxyalkanoates, or PHAs). PHA plastics can exhibit a myriad of properties depending on its monomer composition. The great advantage of such a versatile family of bioplastics is its potential application from consumer products to military armaments and medical materials. One such bioplastic is comprised of two monomers—3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) and 4-hydroxybutyrate (4HB). Because of the desirable elastic properties of 4HB, which contrast greatly with the brittle qualities of 3HB, maximization of its naturally low production rate will be an essential step in the production of PHA-based bioplastics in an economically competitive fashion. A mathematical metabolic flux model was built in order to determine the effects of genetic promoters on enzymes in the polymer-producing pathway. Both a potential active site and a correlation between monomer binding energy and PHA synthase activity were found computationally, giving validity to the computational characterization of the 3HB/4HB-PHA synthase complex. The construction of a novel poly(3HB-co-4HB) pathway in recombinant E. coli has been undertaken and all required genes have been isolated from native bacteria. Two plasmids with different inducible promoters have been created and transformed into E. coli and will soon be followed by polymer extraction and analysis. Using mathematical, computational, and experimental methods, we have discovered key engineerable targets that regulate copolymer composition and have built the framework for future construction of high 4HB-expressing bacteria.

CONTROLLING THE NAVIGATION OF DAPHNIA MAGNA WITH THE ADDITION OF MAGNETIC BACTERIA AND MAGNETIC STIMULI THROUGH AN ARTIFICIAL FLUID SYSTEM
Shane Michael Silpe, Robert Levokove, 
Long Beach High School, Lido Beach, NY

This project engineered a method for the control of the movement of Daphnia magna with the addition of magnetic bacterial species (Magnetospirillum) and a rotating magnetic field. Magnetic bacteria are known for their tendency to produce magnetite and be attracted to magnetic fields. The ability to control the movement of living material without detrimental effects to the host organism could have myriad applications in the fields of oncology, virotherapy, and bioremediation. Magnetic bacteria were cultured from local beach sand. The bacteria were tested for magnetic properties by suspension in a nutrient broth medium and exposure to a 600 gauss field. The Daphnia were divided into two groups, exposed and unexposed to magnetic bacteria for 48 hours. Samples of D. magna with and without the bacteria were placed into a clear PVC maze with three right angle intersections at different points. D. magna were divided into groups which were placed into the maze in trials possessing a magnetic field and half were placed into control trials absent of any additional magnetic field. The rotating magnetic field was generated by attaching magnets to rotating frame that allowed the magnetic field to create a pull towards the designated beakers. The travel time of Daphnia to reach the destinations was recorded as well as which of the four beakers they traveled to. The results were deemed statistically significant using an unpaired t-test, supporting a 99% confidence level, therefore using magnetic bacteria and magnetic stimuli can be used as a controlling agent.

EFFECT OF EXTRA BINARY AMPLITUDE SHIFT KEYING TO ENCODE INFORMATION ON THE RELIABILITY OF A FIBER-OPTIC COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
Tuan Anh Ho, Andrew Kindle Abraham, Andrew Michael Kennedy
Langley High School, McLean Virginia, U.S.A.

The purpose of this experiment was to test the applicability of Extra-Binary Analog Shift Keyed modulation to fiber-optic communication systems. It was hypothesized that if coded binary information were converted into a quaternary (base-4) signal, then digital data could be reliably sent/received over a fiber-optic. The advantage of extra base-symbols is that more binary data bits can be transmitted in the same cable at the same symbol transmission rate, thus increasing maximum potential bandwidth, with financially-conservative hardware (cheaper than wavelength-division-multiplexing). Using a D/A converter to encode binary data, the signal format uses discrete-amplitude levels to distinguish between four base-symbols (0, 1, 2, 3). With copper-wire systems, signal noise distorts the signal and causes receivers errors; with a fiber-optic cable, noise/electromagnetic interference do not cloud a signal transmission. Upon designing and building the test system using IC chips and a fiber-optic cable, the system was tested for reliability. The system was designed to be connected to a standard RS232 (serial) port on a computer, which could precisely and accurately read and transmit raw digital data. Using a software data-transmission terminal, a string of random numbers was transmitted through the system and was received by a receiving computer. The data was then logged into MS Excel, where the sent data and the received data could be checked for errors. From this data, the Bit Error Rate was determined. The results were promising with a <0.008% BER for binary and quaternary. The experiment was performed at 300 bps, 2,400 bps and 19,200 bps.

ORIENTATION AND DIFFERENTIATION OF ADULT DENTAL PULP STEM CELLS ON ELECTROSPUN FIBER SCAFFOLDS
Yesha Maniar, Julie Chang, 
Herricks High School, New Hyde Park, NY

Oral surgeons continue to seek more efficient methods for treating osteonecrosis and repairing teeth. Dental engineering techniques have been stymied by several key factors: immune rejection of allografts by the host, donor site morbidity of autologous grafts, and the loosening of synthetic tissue scaffold implants. Therefore, the development of a bone and dentin scaffold with the use of polybutadiene (PB) oriented fibers would overcome these obstacles and induce dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) to form biomineralized deposits of calcium phosphate, a main component of bone. We used 10-8 mol/L dexamethasone to stimulate DPSCs differentiation into osteoblast-like cells in our induced samples. Our study employed electrospun PB fibers that provided a stiff environment for DPSCs to differentiate. Furthermore, these fibers created a flexible scaffold template to ultimately mold bone and dentin. By adjusting fibers to various thicknesses (2.5±0.70 µm and 11.3±1.3 µm), we determined factors that influenced DPSCs behavior, including the hardness and thickness of fibers and dexamethasone induction. These factors affected the proliferation rate, differentiation capacity, and biomineralization of the DPSCs. Our study determined that hardness is not the only factor in inducing differentiation of DPSCs, but also the shape and size of the fibers. We also found that dexamethasone may not be necessary to induce DPSCs, but rather we can rely on the mechanical properties of fibers. The results from this study will be crucial in the development of an ideal scaffold that can be molded easily and provide an environment for the DPSCs to proliferate and survive.

DNA ELECTROPHORESIS ON MODIFIED SILICON SURFACES IN THE PRESENCE OF ELECTROOSMOTIC FLOW
Joan Young Rho , Maanasa Indaram
The Wheatley School, Old Westbury, New York, USA

Current electrophoretic methods, such as gel and capillary electrophoresis, are the primary means of separating DNA. However, there are drawbacks to each of these methods. Performing electrophoresis on a flat silicon chip promises to alleviate these drawbacks, allowing for fast, efficient, automated results of high resolution quality.<br><br>In order to make this new type of electrophoresis a viable technique, the presence of electroosmotic flow (EOF), a current causing DNA to flow in the opposite (negative) direction, must be reduced significantly. This project studies the effects of using different modified silicon surfaces in order to decrease EOF and optimize electrophoretic separation. Using confocal/ fluorescent microscopy, the flow of DNA in an ionic TBE buffer concentration of 0.001 X TBE on all surfaces in the presence of an electric field was observed. Electrophoresis runs were performed several times on surfaces PVP, PS, OTS, UTS and hydrophilic silicon that can serve as separation media. Finally, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) scans of the different surfaces were taken before and after each electrophoresis run in order to detect any erosion or changes of the surface. This aspect of the research has important implications for capillary electrophoresis as well.

ENGINEERING SYNTHETIC OSCILLATORY GENE NETWORKS AT THE POPULATION LEVEL
Sagar Indurkhya, Nicholas Tang
The NC School of Science and Mathematics, Durham NC, USA

In 1999, Elowitz and Leibler demonstrated the successful design and construction of a small scale artificial genetic network out of functional components. Our work studies population level gene networks, overcoming barriers such as cell lifetime and stochastic perturbations while serving as an elegant framework for the design and construction of large synthetic gene networks. We have designed a novel multistage genetic oscillator, the X-Verter, which operates at the population level and synchronizes the periodic expression of a gene. <br><br> Our work details both a computational and experimental approach to analyze gene networks. We have developed an open source simulation engine that supports diffusion between localized stochastic cellular models. Spatial and temporal configurations of the population are handled by a flexible engine that allows for the simulation of a variety of genetic regulatory networks both at the single cell and population level. This enables the testing and prediction of gene networks, including the X-Verter.<br><br> A series of experimental assays was performed to characterize specific parameters of the quorum sensing receiver devices used by the X-Verter. Computational characterization of signaling molecule degradation rates was performed as well. We are now assembling the X-Verter in the laboratory for experimental evaluation.<br><br> The X-Verter represents one of the most complex artificial biological systems ever designed. Applications for our framework include: cell programming, rapid response to biological terrorism, massively parallel bio-computing frameworks, non-invasive tumor targeting, regulated gene therapy and the characterization of natural biological systems to advance the rapidly developing field of synthetic biology.<br><br>

JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EAR: AN INVESTIGATION OF OSSICULAR MECHANICS
Matthew Joseph Detmer, Joseph Mangum, 
Piedra Vista High School, Farmington, NM

The purpose of this experiment is to determine the relationship between the number of bones contained in the middle ear of an animal and the efficiency of sound transmission. The hypothesis is that the tree bone middle ear of mammals does transfer sound more efficiently that the one bone middle ear of reptiles.<br><br> Researchers state that the model conducts sound better because it uses a simple lever and fulcrum system for efficiency. However one source claimed the bone structure was of secondary importance. He felt it is the increased sensitivity of the inner ear hairs (stereocilia) that allow mammals to experience greater hearing than reptiles and other animals.<br><br> For the experiment a "middle ear" was constructed from the eardrum to oval window. Turkey bones were used to simulate the ear bones, two different sized file folder suspension frames were used to support the middle ear parts; "eardrums" were constructed from kitchen parchment paper stretched over needlepoint sewing frames; and a stylus was made from simple materials to measure the amount of sound waves transferred through the middle ear.<br><br> The results show that the tree bone model does conduct sound significantly better than the single-bone model which supports the hypothesis. This means that properly aligned multiple ear bones are superior to single bones for conducting sound.

Earthquakes are quick jolts of the earth's plates that cause extensive damage to buildings, resulting in the death of people who live and work in these buildings. The purpose of this project is to save people's lives and limit the amount of damage done to a building's structure in the event of an earthquake. The idea we tested is a new form of base isolation that separates the base of the buildng from the earth by using solid spheres.<br><br> To begin our experiment we needed to create a model earthquake. We created a shake table by using a sheet of steel that sits on thrust bearings which would allow the ground to move as it would in the event of an actual earthquake. Electric actuators were wired to a programmable logic controller which caused the shake table to consistently move equally in different directions. Bases were then constructed, one that would be secured to the ground and the other one on a free-moving base isolated by bearings and stabilizers. Our first model buildings were made from "Jumbling Tower" blocks. After trials were run using these models, we then scaled them up and ran additional trials.<br><br> The results of our testing showed that buildings could withstand earthquakes better if built on a moveable base. However, the larger the mass of the model, the better it withstood the trials.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF DENSITY FLUCTUATIONS ON POLYMER INTERFACES
Hyeyeon Choi , Aaron Long
Half Hollow Hills High School East, Dix Hills, NY, US

We have found that supercritical CO2 and ethane can compatibilize polymer blends. We performed contact angle goniometry and found that the Young's contact angle decreased along the supercritical transition region in the Pressure- Temperature phase diagram. A corresponding increases in the interfacial width because the same region using X-ray reflectivity. We hypothesized that this behavior was due to the increase in the density fluctuation of the CO2 which is known to occur at these points in the pressure-temperature phase diagram. These fluctuations are a universal phenomenon and hence the compatibilization mechanism is generally applicable to all polymer interfaces.<br><br>In order to prove this assumption, we then attempted to;<br><br>1) Observe crystallization of PE at the ethane/polymer interface. Here results showed an increase in crystallinity when the samples were annealed in ethane.<br><br>2) Determined whether a broadening could also be observed at the interface between a polymer and an evaporated metal film. The increased porosity of the film enhanced diffusion of the metal across the interface. <br><br>PE data showed that melting point was decreased with exposure to supercritical fluids, thus increasing porosity. We proved that polymer metallization was optimized by first exposing the polymer substrate and then exposing the metal layer. Therefore, adhesion at polymer and polymer-metal interfaces can be improved by exposure to supercritical fluids.<br><br><br>

In today’s world there are specialized electronic gadgets for almost every aspect of our life. The simplify life by giving us conveniences like immediate communication or thousands of hours of music all at the press of a button. Unfortunately all of these devices have unique power requirements and thus each one comes with its own charger, competing for the sparse number of electrical outlets and cluttering your desk with miles of rarely used cords. What if you could use a single, convenient platform to charge all of your electronic devices without the need of any specialized chargers? This is what we attempted to invent using the concept of wireless energy transfer.<br><br> This project explored the possibility of using electromagnetic induction to induce a current from a primary coil in the platform to a secondary coil built into the electronic device. A model was built which proved the concept feasible; however there remain obstacles to overcome before the device is completed. With this set up it would be possible to charge multiple devices simply by setting them on or near the charging “pad”. Not only would this clean up your desk at home, but there is a chance that the concept could be expanded to charge electric cars in your garage and nearly any other electronic device.<br><br>

ELECTRICITY LOAD FORECASTING USING THE SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE
David Dengyu Wang, Adam Charles, Yuriy Novodvorskiy
Stuyvesant High School, New York, NY, USA

The New York Independent Systems Operator uses a neural network model to forecast electricity loads throughout New York State. Our task was to demonstrate that the Support Vector Machine is a more powerful tool for the purpose of generating these forecasts. <br><br> The neural network utilizes a collection of hidden internal nodes which apply varying weights to inputs and optimizes the particular series of nodes which ultimately becomes the model. The SVM iterates input vectors to some VC dimension using a specified kernel function, allowing a complex regression problem to be solved with a single hyper plane. <br><br> Due to the nature of the problem, the overall problem was segmented first by zones defined by the NYISO and then by season. Preliminary runs demonstrated that models segmented according to time of year optimized results by reducing the need to address dynamic year-long climate variations. This segmentation was found to be optimal when performed by season, in which specific climate trends are isolated while preserving an adequate amount of data to train and test on. Climate and load values were utilized in various combinations in accordance with the relevant zone and season, ultimately generating multiple day-ahead electricity load forecasting models. <br><br> In conclusion, our SVM model was able to marginally outperform the neural network model in mean absolute error. However, the final recommended SVM model is unable to accurately predict anomalies in load trends, which occur during major holidays. A separate SVM model is proposed to forecast special cases.<br><br>

BUILDING ENHANCED BIOSCAFFOLDS: IMPROVING THE STABILITY AND WOUND-HEALING PROPERTIES OF BIOCOMPATIBLE SCAFFOLDS USING HYDROGELS AND ELECTROSPUN FIBERS
Michelle Theresa Leonetti, Salonee Shah, 
Long Beach High School, Long Beach, NY

An important goal of the bioengineering community is the design of biocompatible and chemically stable scaffolding materials that can replace damaged tissue in a wound and accelerate the biological processes essential to healing. We investigated the extent to which two hydrogels increase cellular proliferation and accelerate the migration of adult human dermal fibroblasts: (1) gelatin cross-linked with microbial transglutaminase in ratios of 250:1, 25:1, 5:1 (gelatin:mtGase) and (2) hyaluronic acid stabilized with laponite clay. Hydrogels are ideal matrices due to their high permeability that facilitates the diffusion of metabolites necessary for cell growth. Rheology was performed to assess the properties of the physical and chemical cross-linking of the gels. We also investigated whether scaffolds composed of electrospun fibers with bilayer angles can encourage cells to migrate in a particular direction, with the ultimate goal of directing cells to the site of the wound. The fibers were electrospun at angles of either 45º or 90º in order to create a 3-dimensional substrate composed of more than one plane and to create junctions between the angled layers of fibers that would test a cell’s preference towards a certain direction. Our results suggest that a bioscaffold composed of the moderately stiff gelatin hydrogel (25:1) and electrospun fibers with a bilayer angle of 90° would facilitate wound healing to a greater extent than other bioscaffolds. The future implications of our bioscaffolds are not limited to wound healing, but can be applied to broad disciplines such as scar reduction, burn treatment and organ transplants. All of these fields are in dire need of improvement by the introduction of a more effective method of healthy cell growth and regeneration.

USING NANOPARTICLE FILLERS TO ENHANCE THE PROPERTIES OF POLYMER THIN FILM LUBRICANTS
Abigail Esther Maller, Lauren Goldstein
Stella K. Abraham High School for Girls, Hewlett Bay Park, NY, 11557 USA

We produced a high-performance polymer by adding nanoparticles to polystyrene. Atomic Force Microscopy measurements of phase segregation of Polystyrene (PS) and Poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) in a solution containing 1% gold nanoparticles showed an increase of the polymer modulus by more than 50%.<br><br> By measuring the rate of hole growth of a bilayer of PMMA over PS films containing gold and palladium nanoparticles and C-POSS, we obtained a universal relationship between the radii of the particles, the polymer radius of gyration and the effective viscosity of the new nanocomposite. Control of thin film viscosity with nanoparticles can create more effective polymer lubricants that will be able to withstand the high shear forces of miniature devices such as MEMS, and for use in outer space, where the lack of gravity dewets lubricant films.

DESIGNING A SINGLE NETWORKED WEBCAM CAPABLE OF ROTATING AND TILTING TO VIEW MULTIPLE ROBOTS
Amanda Sarah Hersh, Rogaite Shafi, Dilruba Akther
Yeshivah of Flatbush Joel Braverman High School, Brooklyn, New York, USA

Teleoperation is the control of an object over a distance. One of the more common types of teleoperation is the control of a robot that is out of sight from the user. The robot is viewed by a camera, such as a webcam, and will appear on the operator’s computer. Currently, it is possible for a single webcam to view a single robot. This project was designed to allow a single webcam to rotate and tilt to view multiple robots when activated by a person on a personal computer. <br><br> A webcam was positioned on a platform which rotated to three pre-programmed positions. A BS2p24/40 Demo Board, or circuit board, was wired to control two DC motors. This circuit board was connected to a computer and instructions were programmed in PBASIC. An Ethernet chip was placed on the circuit board, allowing it to communicate with an individual on the internet. The individual could choose a pre-programmed position, which is where the robots would be located. A graphical user interface was developed to allow the operator to view the robots. <br><br> This webcam allows for businesses to be more efficient as they would only need to purchase and program one webcam, thereby saving time and money. This project would also allow for one webcam to view a series of robots being sent into the battlefield as well as view robots being activated to handle hazardous waste, disarm explosives and search for victims in natural disasters. <br><br>

NOVEL SPHEROID CULTURES OF HEPATOCYTES FOR MAXIMIZED LIVER-SPECIFIC FUNCTION
Cathy Hsi Chen, Alexander Joseph Mullen, 
Oxford High School, Oxford, MS

The purpose of this experiment was to develop a way to maximize liver-specific function in order to increase the potential of bioartificial liver machines and in vitro liver experimentation. Research has shown that developing hepatocytes in spheroid culture can enhance structural stability. <br><br>Prospective methods of inducing spheroids were considered. By encouraging clumping formation through polymer coating of wells and rocking motions, the physical motion and collision between cell particles could theoretically form hepatocytic spheroids. Also, dissolving polymers in the cell medium solution could increase the longevity and regularity<br><br>This arrangement was intended to aid liver-specific cell function through increased membrane contact, mimicking the environment in the body. <br><br> The results of the experiment showed that hepatocytes cultured in albumin- and ELP-PEI-coated wells developed spheroid formations. Hepatocytes dislike attaching to albumin, a relatively slippery polymer, and therefore resort to clumping with each other to form spheroids. Similarly, positive charges in the ELP-PEI polymer discourage hepatocytic attachment. <br><br> Cultures that spread across the surface of the well, PBS, produced lower concentrations of urea (6.543 µg/mL/day) than those that formed spheroids, albumin and ELP-PEI (8.025 µg/mL/day and 7.654 µg/mL/day). <br><br> With the addition of the polymer, the cultures had longer spheroid “peak” times. This is likely because the polymer provided another surface to which the cells could attach, thereby increasing overall spheroid stability.

HYDROGEN PRODUCTION BY UREA ELECTROLYSIS
Christopher Alan Pang, Edbert Li, Michael Wu
Watchung Hills Regional High School, Warren, NJ

Hydrogen gas can be produced from water electrolysis, but to make hydrogen a feasible alternative, the production efficiency needs improvement. The electrolysis of urea, a small organic compound found in urine, takes 0.37 V, about one third of the 1.23 V electric cell potential needed to electrolyze water. We engineered an electrolytic cell that oxidizes urea to produce hydrogen. In our experiments the potentials for the electrolysis of urea and water were about 2.0V +/- 0.2V when a model carbon based electrolytic cell was used. This confirmed the need for a new design and the use of different electrode materials. In our modified cell, expensive platinum electrodes found in commercial electrolytic cells were replaced with nickel and stainless steel gauzes. These different electrodes were systematically tested over a series of trials for each electrode at varying voltages. Variables such as the concentration of KOH in solution, and the operating temperature were also individually controlled or varied during separate trials. The performance of the cell was analyzed in terms of the minimal amount of current needed to begin electrolysis and the overall amount of hydrogen produced per energy input. Using the electrolysis of water as a control, we investigated which materials and operating conditions resulted in the greatest production of hydrogen.

REMOTE ACTIVATED CHIP-BASED DRUG RELEASE SYSTEM USING NANOPARTICLES AS AN ANTI-CANCER THERAPEUTIC
Lara Arielle Fourman, Sanchita Singal, Mili Mehta
Plainview-Old Bethpage John F. Kennedy High School, Plainview, NY

The pharmaceutical industry is constantly searching for methods that allow drugs to be delivered as a direct response to a specific stimulus, in which the locus of delivery is in the vicinity of the required region. A unique thermo-reversible hydrogel, F127 modified with dimethacrylate (DMA), that can deliver drugs at physiological temperatures was synthesized. Nanoparticles which are specific for targeting human body cancer cells were absorbed by this hydrogel. To test the toxicity of nanoparticles on cells, slides of stained and fixed cells treated with nanoparticles were obtained to be examined under the confocal microscope. The toxicity of nanoparticles with different diameters and coatings was measured using the MTT assay. It was found that nanoparticles with smaller diameters and folate coatings were most toxic to the cancer cells. The release rate of the nanoparticles from the hydrogel was measured as a function of temperature with the hydrogel releasing approximately 3 µL nanoparticles per hour. Exposing this drug delivery system to cancer cells would effectively inhibit MCF7 cell proliferation. By grafting this nanoparticle-loaded hydrogel onto a thermoelectric module, the release of the drug would be controlled. Thus, a successful temperature sensitive hydrogel was synthesized that releases cancer-targeting nanoparticles which inhibit cancer cell proliferation, thereby engineering a controlled drug delivery system.

CONTROLLING METAL/POLYMER ADHESION: THE ENHACEMENT OF MICROLITHOGRAPHY AND THE FORMATION OF NANOWIRES
Jacob Charles Loewenstein, Brienne Kugler
HAFTR High School, Cedarhurst NY, USA

Metal/polymer adhesion in thin films is crucial in the formation of circuitry, yet difficult because of weak Van der Waals attractions between the metal and polymer. Current micro-lithography is neither cost-effective, accurate, nor environmentally friendly. We developed a method to control polymer/metal adhesion by altering polymer surface topography using supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2), a â€œgreenâ€ solvent. We tested metal/polymer adhesion using peel test, atomic force microscopy, X-Ray reflectivity, and water and metal contact angles. In amorphous polymers, scCO2 forms low-density regions, interlocking the metal and strengthening adhesion. In crystalline polymers, scCO2 induces greater crystalline structure, weakening adhesion. Selecting where scCO2 penetrates polymer surfaces controls metal adhesion, with applicability in creating microcircuit boards. Additionally, POSS nanoparticles retained miscibility and strengthened PMMA adhesion by increasing polymer surface area.<br><br> To date, there has been no method of fabricating uniform, smooth nanowires. This research exposed electrospun fibers to scCO2, producing smooth surfaces (seen via SEM), thereby strengthening metal/polymer adhesion. Thus, we discovered how surface morphology, scCO2, and nanoparticles play a role in the process of metallization. We developed a viable method of microlithography by using these factors to control adhesion and form uniform, inexpensive nanowires by metallizing electrospun fiber scaffolds exposed to scCO2.<br><br>

THE PELTIER EFFECT: ELIMINATING THE USE OF FREON IN AUTOMOBILE AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEMS
Tyler Glen Lyon, Chad Robert Thornley, and Daniel Rees Winegar
Riverton High School, Riverton Utah 84065, USA

The purpose of our project is to explore the possibilities of replacing current Freon based air-conditioning systems in automobiles. We hypothesized that if we implement thermoelectric cooling based on the Peltier effect, then we could create a solid-state air-conditioning system that would eliminate current Freon based systems. We estimate that our system could potentially save 7.8 billion gallons of gasoline annually. This system could also eliminate an estimated 492 million pounds of hydrocarbons, 3.7 billion pounds of carbon monoxide, and 252 million pounds of nitrous oxides on vehicle emissions. Because of our air-conditioning system, gas mileage would increase by four miles per gallon, and horsepower would increase by approximately 6%.<br><br> We assembled our first model and found that it didn’t work. Then we analyzed the unit design and drew up new schematics to fix the problems. By reconstructing our first model and acquiring a few more items, we built a second model that worked and cooled the testing environment. We encountered more problems and fixed them by repeating the analytical and rebuilding processes, which included rethinking, redesigning, and rebuilding. This allowed us to complete our third model, which proved to be most capable of cooling the environment.<br><br> From our current design, we were able to consistently cool down our test environment at least 4 degrees below ambient. Based on our results we determined that by improving heat dissipation, improving the transfer of cold, and with maximizing our input power, we could increase our cooling capacity and make our hypothesis viable.

NOVEL CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM FOR AUGMENTED COGNITION VIA DISCRIMINATION OF MULTIPLEX QUANTUM CLUSTER DISTRIBUTIONS
William Fan, Edward Nguyen
School of Science and Technology, Beaverton, Oregon USA

We unify certain principles of quantum mechanics with standard techniques in signal processing to create a novel quantum classification algorithm for augmented cognition systems. Current augmented cognition methods must consider invasive methods of data collection in order to obtain less noisy data for accurate classification decisions. The dual problems of dimensionality and variability in EEG data from a non-invasive neural data collection approach necessitate the emergence of highly accurate classification algorithms for valid application to classification tasks. We develop a quantum classification algorithm based on a two class 32 channel EEG dataset from a simple target/distracter image recognition brain computer interface. Main obstructions to meaningful classification of this data include the high variability and challenging dimensionality. In response, our methodology utilizes Schrödinger's equation with a scale space probability function to derive the gradient of a potential function. Method of steepest descent, or gradient descent, on this potential gradient isolates robust minima which we then designate as the centers of quantum clusters in Euclidian space. Convergence is measured to establish quantum cluster boundaries. We draw a discriminant line inside each quantum cluster and combine the discriminant lines from each quantum cluster in piecewise fashion to construct a nonlinear discriminant. In this paper, we describe the design of this novel classification algorithm, written in MATLAB. The algorithm evidences a statistically marked classification accuracy improvement over standard methods such as linear discriminant analysis or support vector machine in ROC analysis. A two proportion z test also demonstrates the statistical significance of our results.

IMPROVING THERMAL STABILITY OF MMA RESINS BY MELT BLENDING WITH MODIFIED ORGANOCLAYS
Jonathan S. Hefter, Andrew Joshua Song
Davis Renov Stahler Yeshiva HS: 700 Ibsen Street, Woodmere, New York 11598

Flammable paints, coatings and adhesives may quicken the spread of fire and lead to increased fatalities. The vast majority of these paints, coatings, and adhesives are all acrylic-based. Recent advances in polymer composite engineering has made it possible to mold automobiles made entirely of Thermoplastic Olefins (TPO). This technology promises to produce cars that are light, inexpensive, and resistant to corrosion; however, repair of these cars relies on the use of acrylic resin adhesives, known to have low temperature flash points. This can be extremely dangerous in a crash, causing other polymer components to ignite as well. A polymer nanocomposite, prepared by free radical polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA), displays improved thermal stability when intercalated in clay. Since acrylic resins have similar chemical groups to methyl methacrylate polymers, it was hypothesized that clays may also increase the thermal stability of the adhesive resins. Since it is not possible to synthesize the resins within the clay galleries, the resins were melt mixed with functionalized organoclays. Transmission electron microscopy found that the clay, Cloisite 6A, was able to achieve more than 60% degree of exfoliation with the resins. Tests with cone calorimetry found that the compound had acquired greatly enhanced thermal properties. The specific heat increased by a factor of 3, the average mass loss rate decreased by a factor of 2, the average heat release rate decreased by a factor of 2, and the material did not have a flashpoint. These improved properties did not affect the material’s adhesion and represent a major advancement in the safety of acrylic materials. Due to large commercial interest in this new material a patent disclosure has been obtained.

SWITCHGRASS: A SOURCE OF BIOFUELS AND FIBERS
Mallory Ruth Busso, Lauren Raycraft, 
Kalamazoo Area Mathematics and Science Center, Kalamazoo, MI

A research team examined the chemical properties of Panicum Virgatum L. fibers to determine their potential for dual use in bio-refinery and paper making processes. A sample of Panicum Virgatum L., more commonly known as Switchgrass, was obtained after the 2009 harvest. Students conducted standardized tests commonly used in the pulp and paper industry. Switchgrass fibers were extracted from the raw material sample through autohydrolysis. Tests were then conducted on the Switchgrass raw material and pulp. The results from the chemical analysis of Switchgrass were compared with the average data for other raw materials. From the technical point of view, the fiber dimensions and properties of the Switchgrass pulps tested indicate that Switchgrass is potentially a useful material for papermaking. From this research, it is also evident that the combination of Switchgrass autohydrolysis (as the bio-refinery process) and use of the Switchgrass fibers in papermaking is very possible in the future.

DETERMINING THE SOLUBILITY PARAMETERS OF END-GRAFTED POLYSTYRENE IN SUPERCRITICAL CO2
Chelsea Gloria Gordon, Feini Qu
Half Hollow Hills High School East, Dix Hills New York, USA

Supercritical fluids (SCFs), or substances that are raised above their critical points in both temperature and pressure, make excellent solvents for previously insoluble polymers. The question being explored concerning this phenomenon is if chi, or the interaction parameter between the solvent and the solute, changes as SCF pressure changes. In other words, the goal of the experiment is to determine if pressure can be used as a variable in changing solvent quality.<br><br> To obtain the chi values, polymer brushes of three different molecular weights were created by spinning end-functionalized (COOH) polystyrene onto silicon wafers. The samples were then placed in a vacuum oven overnight in order to attach one end of the polymer to the silicon substrate. Samples were exposed to supercritical carbon dioxide at a constant temperature of 36 degrees Celsius and pressures of 700 psi, 1,200 psi, and 1,450 psi. Ellipsometer readings in conjunction with atomic force microscopy provided measurements of film thickness. A computer simulation was then employed to determine the chi value for each pressure.<br><br> The data collected proves that as the pressure increases, the polymer extends further from the surface, resulting in a greater film thickness. In addition, the chi value between polystyrene and supercritical CO2 decreases as the pressure increases, resulting in a better solvent quality at the highest pressure used (1,450 psi). Thus, it can be concluded that the solvent quality of a supercritical fluid can be changed if its pressure is altered, a unique property that conventional organic solvents do not exhibit.<br><br>

COMPRESSION POWER
Steven Martinez, Brandon Mesa
Spring Creek High School, Spring Creek NV, Elko

Our Project consisted of testing the output of a fixed amount of gasoline under different compression ratios. Through our research we already knew high compression gasoline engines make more power as the compression goes up. What we didn’t know was if that that extra power is a result of more gasoline being burned because there is more oxygen in the combustion chamber, thus giving no boost in efficiency. The other possible explanation for the increase in power is as the compression of gasoline increases the potential energy of the gasoline being compressed goes up, being more efficient. In order to figure out if compression increased efficiency or not we compressed a fixed amount of gasoline at different compression figures.<br><br> To accomplish this we constructed a spark plug assembly complete with cylinder and compression piston. Using a fish scale we were able to find the compression pressure exerted on the piston as well as the output pressure exerted on the piston after the gasoline went under compression. We then plotted our results on an x y plane x being compression work and y being output work. We then ran a linear regression on our points and got a line with a slope of 1.22. This means that for every unit of work compressing the fuel air mixture .22 more units of work is given after combustion.<br><br>

DAVID VS. GOLIATH IV: ROAD TRIP STYLE
Brittney Espinoza, Jessica Gomez, Amanda Gonzales
Americas High School, El Paso, Texas, United States

Many automobile accidents occur when weather conditions become harsh. Black ice forms on roads when freezing temperatures strike an area, often causing vehicles to lose traction and skid. Hydroplaning occurs on wet roads, usually when rain begins to fall. The project's purpose was to cut down on the accidents that occur due to black ice and rain. We hypothesized that if we constructed roads with skid reducing patterns, then vehicular skidding would be reduced more than if we had used different materials to construct the roads.<br><br> For black ice control, we made 3 sets of (material) roads: each had sodium chloride, calcium chloride, or magnesium chloride. We made another 3 sets of roads: each paved with a chicken wire pattern, a triangle pattern, or a tire tread pattern. Our control was a set of normal strips of cement. We induced ice-like conditions soaking models in water and placing outside overnight. We ran a remote control car on the roads, increasing speed until proportional with that of a real car, and braked immediately when speed was reached. We collected data and recorded observations. The same procedures were followed for the hydroplaning group except that the material set used asphalt, cement, and flagstone sections of road. The test groups were exposed to water before running the remote control car on the roads.<br><br> In both experiments, the tire tread pattern allowed less severity and displacement in the car’s skidding. This patterned allowed for more traction in both the black ice and hydroplaning trials.<br><br>

BLACK ICE
Anna Lee Allcorn, Nicholas Flores, 
Olton High School, Olton, TX

Every year thousands of people are victims to accidents caused by ice on roads. This prompted our pursuit to engineer a road that is freeze resistant. In this pursuit, we tested different road materials and created a layering technique that would resist freeze. We then tested our layering technique and provided energy for the heating element that was embedded in the layers. In order to make our technique applicable to current road construction, we created feasibility models, determined exact placement and ratio of layering, and defined the materials of each layer in such a way that they would be in compliance of the Department of Transportation interstate road regulations. We have engineered and specifically addressed concerns within the design, construction, and cost of our road layering technique in order to make this product readily available.

THE INCORPORATION OF NANOFIBER MATERIALS IN AIR FILTRATION APPLICATIONS
Albert Roberts Christian, James Z. Wang
Hoover High School, North Canton, Ohio, United States of America

The transmission of diseases via airborne bacteria is a concern within most scientific labs, hospitals, and common households. Currently, filters designed to remove bacteria measuring 2 - 3 micrometers are expensive, and the availability is limited. Trials have been developed to evaluate affordable air filters modified with a nanofiber layer and their effectiveness of removing airborne particulates in the range of 0.3 - 1.0 micrometers. The first stage of the project was to design and create an apparatus that would allow nanofibers to be spun onto a rotating drum to form nanofibers with filtration abilities. Gap distances consisted of 12 and 16 cm, while percent solutions included 14%, 17%, and 20% Nylon 4/6 in formic acid. The second stage was to test the altered filters within a wind chamber device that provided a controlled environment. It was hypothesized that the 20% Nylon 4/6 solution spun at 12 cm would produce the filters most suited to filter airborne nanoparticles. The efficiency of the air filter was determined by subtracting the post-filtration mass from the pre-filtration mass, providing the mass of oil filtered by the nanofiber filter. The nanofiber samples gained noticeably more mass than the controls. After analyzing the data with the JMP Multiple Variable Analysis software, it was concluded that the 17% and 20% samples showed statistically significant gains in comparison with its counterparts, while the gap distance did not correlate with mass increase. It was also noted that the oil particles showed coalescence by beading up on the filters.

Maglev trains use the alternating attraction of magnets on the bottom of the car, or in the guide way, to propel the vehicle, unlike normal trains which use an engine. In this experiment a maglev train was built with modifications on the use of the magnets. Our hypothesis was that the train with the most mass would have the greatest velocity.<br><br> The experiment involved building a permanant maglev train, and then testing it to see if mass would affect the velocity of the train (with or without felt) after going down a slope.<br><br> Masses in increments of twenty grams were added to the maglev, and the velocity measured with a motion sensor.<br><br> For the maglev velocity without felt, the maglev with 40g had the highest velocity with 0.244 m/s. The next highest average velocity was the maglev with 100g, then 80g, 20g, 120g, 140g, 60g, 160g, and then 0 grams. The maglev with the highest velocity with felt was the one with 0 grams at a velocity of 0.052 m/s. It then went 40g, 60g, 20g, 100g, 120g, 160g, 80g, and 140 grams.<br><br> The data did not support our hypothesis. We predicted that more mass would make the maglev go faster, but there was no trend in the maglev without felt, and somewhat of a trend in the other maglev.

A STRAIGHT FLIGHT TO THE TOP: PHASE TWO
David K. Wagner, Paul A. Lopez
J.M. Hanks High School, El Paso, TX, US

The reason for this project was to test different designs of missiles and how the air would affect their flight. Our problem that we encountered was, what design would be able to perform the best. By this we mean what missile would fly the highest, fastest and farthest. The method we used to find this was to build six different kinds of missiles with different and yet the same variables. The variables we used were a tapered body, wings, straight fins and slanted fins. Our hypothesis was that we thought the winged tapered straight-fined missile would perform the best. After we built the rockets we went out to Horizon, which is about 1.5 miles east of El Paso. We tested the all six rockets two times each. We used the Estes Model Rocket Altitude Finder to determine the height of the missile, and measuring tape to find the distance. While the missile was in the air we timed it. Next we divided the distance it traveled in yards by how many seconds it flew and then found out the speed in yards per second. From our data that we collected we were able to determine that the straight fined, tapered body design did the greatest flying a distance of 1,122ft, an altitude of 97m and speed of 187ft per second. Our hypothesis was incorrect. The winged straight-fined tapered body did the worst with a height of 27m, a distance of 45ft and speed of 15ft per second.

OPTIMIZATION OF PLATINUM NANOPARTICLES FOR PROTON EXCHANGE MEMBRANE FUEL CELLS USING PULSE ELECTROCHEMICAL DEPOSITION
Andrew James Touloukian Swoboda, Ryan Dennis Lindeborg, 
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science & Technology, Alexandria, VA

The high cost of platinum (Pt) is the major barrier hindering the commercialization of hydrogen fuel cells. This research focused on the optimization of various fuel cell production parameters to maximize performance with minimal platinum loading. Precursor solution, solvent concentration, voltage, deposition time, purity of the solution, and type of solvent were varied to maximize the deposited platinum surface area on a fluorine-doped tin oxide electrode. Platinum surface area and efficiency were measured with cyclic voltammetry, while scanning electron microscopy demonstrated physical characteristics. Pt deposition with a new precursor solution, H2Pt(OH)6, was superior to a previous supporting electrolyte of H2PtCl6. Also, 5mM of H2Pt(OH)6 deposited more platinum than 1mM. Decreasing the voltage during deposition was associated with improved Pt loading, with a nadir at ±0.25V. Increasing deposition time, as shown in previous studies, increased Pt nucleation sites. Purging impurities from the supporting electrolyte with an inert gas did not provide any benefit. Finally, a new solvent of 20% by volume mixture of 2:1 HNO3/H2SO4 yielded more platinum surface area than H2SO4 alone. Ultimately, the fuel cell parameters of 5 mM H2Pt(OH)6 in 1.5M H2SO4 proved best in performance testing, providing a new and exciting direction for future research.

SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF PALLADIUM NANOPARTICLES
Cheryl Schonbrun, Michelle Forman
Stella K Abraham HS for Girls, Hewlett Bay Park, NY USA

Palladium nanoparticles are important catalysts with optical, electronic and magnetic properties determined by their size; however, their structure is relatively unknown. We synthesized PdC12 by one-phase and two-phase methods and determined by TEM nanoparticle sizes of 4 and 2 nm, respectively. Only the two-phase spread as a film on water. Electronic diffraction confirmed FCC structure with an ao equal to that of bulk Pd, showing particle size doesn't distort lattice structure. High resolution TEM, displaying planes of Pd atoms, corroborated the ao and confirmed a truncated structure. EXAFS produced a similar ao but with particle diameters half of that determined by TEM. Re-examination of EXAFS indicated that much of Pd-S intensity was coming from Pd atoms not in the nanoparticle, consistent with published results that these reactions don't go to completion. ESR measurements show a large magnetic moment for the two-phase particles as predicted theoretically for small nanoparticles. The magnitude of the moment is a function of the synthesis procedure. These particles are therefore ideal catalysts; their large surface-to-volume ratio makes them chemically reactive, while their magnetic moment allows them to be removed once the reaction is complete.

UNDERSTANDING AND APPLYING NANOFIBER TECHNOLOGY IN AIR FILTRATION APPLICATIONS
Theodore John Rogers, Albert R. Christian
Hoover High School North Canton, Ohio USA

Each day people are subjected to foreign microorganisms that can potentially cause illness if that person's immune system cannot fight off the attacker. Airborne bacteria are an example of these harmful organisms. Many filters available that can stop bacteria are extremely expensive. However, the application of nylon nanofibers could improve the efficiency of an air filter at a low cost. Voltage, gap distance, and polymer concentration were studied to determine how they affect the qualities of the nanofibers. All three of these variables were investigated with the goal of minimizing bacteria permeability of air filters. No significant relationship exists between voltage and mass, gap distance and fiber diameter, and polymer concentration and mass. However, significant relationships do exist between gap distance and mass, and polymer concentration and fiber diameter. The greater the gap distance, the lower the mass of the fibers collected on the collection plate. There is a direct relationship between the polymer concentration and fiber diameter. Furthermore, a multiple linear regression established significant relationships among all three variables and the fiber diameter produced. The pore size is inversely proportional to time, as the fibers will cover the void areas with their random distribution. The addition of Nylon 4/6 nanofibers to traditional air filters is currently being investigated. This is expected to inhibit the recirculation of sub-micron particles, such as bacteria, throughout an enclosed area.

COTTON GIN OF THE FUTURE
Mitchell Bradford, John Phillips, Andrew Watkins
St. Joseph Catholic School, Greenville, MS

The purpose of this experiment was to build an energy efficient cotton gin run partly on water. A water-powered cotton gin would be more energy efficient and would help the environment at the same time.<br><br>The hypothesis was that the gin could not run solely on water power because there is not enough pressure in this small-scale model. If used with the technology of the world and an open water source with high water pressure, though, it would work fine. <br><br>To begin constructing the gin, we slid five saws onto a shaft with spacers in between and welded them to the shaft. After that we took two round blocks of wood and cut six slots into it to slide the brushes in. After the brush and the saws were constructed into place we began to build the frame. The rectangular frame is made of iron and encased by wood. We placed a one horsepower motor on the lower part of the frame. On the lower back side of the gin we built a water wheel that demonstrates we can actually conserve energy which is a problem that has been facing cotton ginners for years. <br><br>Our project was a success, in that it ginned the cotton well for a small model. It removed most of the seeds and debris that were originally embedded in the cotton. Our hypothesis was correct. There wasn’t enough pressure to turn the gin.<br><br>In conclusion, our project was satisfactory. We were pleased with the results of the cotton gin. If applied to a large scale, our idea would work because of the increased pressure of a large body of water. Also, other alternative energy sources could be used. This is a step towards a cleaner nation.

EXPLORING THE CAPABILITIES OF STIQUITOROBOT
Renee Ann Baker, Jennifer A'mir Townsend
UNC-Charlotte, Charlotte North Carolina, U.S.A.

Stiquito is a six legged robot and can walk without human control. The possibilities of this robot are endless. Finding a way to make the robot walk on water and host a camera that’ll transmit pictures wirelessly through wood, concrete, and brick can prove this. It was hypothesized that by adding rubber material or a rubber spray and by finding a floatation device would enable the Stiquito to walk on water, and by constructing and mounting with a video camera to transmit pictures wirelessly through wood, brick, and concrete. The 1st experiment tested possible materials that could serve as a protectant for Stiquito’s body by finding conductivity and testing those that passed by putting them in water. Once the conductivity was measured, the electrical spray proved to be the most effective. Next, a test was conducted to find out which floatation device was the best to use. A ½ X ½ in of square foam piece proved to work the best allowing the Stiquito to walk on water. In the 2nd experiment, tests were conducted to find out whether a camera hosted on Stiquito will transmit pictures wirelessly through wood, brick, and concrete. Stiquito and the camera were taken to wood, brick, and concrete buildings to test the transmitted picture quality. The results were put into one of five categories: clear, ¾, ½, ¼ clear, and unclear. The results showed wood was best to transmit pictures through, with concrete, and last, brick. The results show what is needed to be improved upon to enable Stiquito for public use. The research can be used as guide to people who continue these experiments so that Stiquito may detect items in the water by sensors or in disasters.

DESIGNING A SYSTEM FOR VERSATILE SEMI-AUTONOMOUS ROBOTS
Ashish M. Bakshi, Eshin Jolly
Manhasset High School, Manhasset, New York, USA

The use of mobile robots in situations that are dangerous or cost-inefficient for humans has recently been gaining momentum. A number of robotic solutions have been developed by government or corporately-funded projects for anti-personnel mine detection, surveillance/reconnaissance, search-and-rescue operations, and other uses, but these efforts have resulted in proprietary-designed robots that are too expensive for wide-scale use by non-military organizations. The goal of this study was to design and build a system for mobile robots that combines the versatility of the large robots, the accessibility of small robots, the control of remote-operated bots, and a degree of mobile autonomy, all within a single versatile, cost-efficient design. Additionally, the system must be flexible, unlike prior robotic efforts, to allow for different hardware configurations and software add-ins for specific tasks. The methodology included the design and construction of a prototype mobile robot with onboard PC capabilities through a Mini-ITX standard-based motherboard, Sonar, IR, and other sensors controlled through an OOPIC microcontroller, treaded platform, wireless communication link, base station, and the designing of a custom software solution (in Visual Basic.NET) to control the entire system, including manual and semi-autonomous navigation, video transmission, and data processing. Though some compromises had to be made, the prototype robot and software solution designed met the project goals for versatility, price (total cost less than $1000), and software and hardware expandability/portability (open, non-proprietary design, allowing for hardware addition or replacement) – resulting in a solution that is affordable for use for a wide range of operations.

EARTHQUAKE AND FIRE RESISTANT STRUCTURES
Ivan Labastida, Esat Cavdar, 
Harmony Science Academy Houston, Houston, TX

This project has two factors; fire and earthquake safety against structures.<br><br>Earthquake: Thousands of people die each year because of earthquakes. We want to see if the building structure will affect the stability of the building against earthquakes. Models of earthquake resistant buildings constructed of unattached wooden blocks were stabilized using several structural modifications: overlapping blocks, building height, buttresses, base isolators (marbles in a box), and roofs and cross braces. Experiments were conducted on a homemade earthquake machine. Buildings of overlapped blocks on a base isolator were most stable. <br><br>Fire: Fire kills 4,000 and injures more than 25,000 people each year. NaHCO3 and KHCO3 have fire-extinguishing characteristics and we wanted to experiment their effects if mixed with paint. 2 trials were conducted; the first trial was conducted with small amounts of NaHCO3 and KHCO3, the second experiment with large amounts. In the first trial NaHCO3 was weighed out into 4.2g, 8g, 12g, and 16g into foam cups. 50ml of paint were added into the cups. Same was done with KHCO3 but only 4.2g. It was not possible for big amounts of ash to be combined with paint and still keep its texture. After the woods dried the wood were painted respectively, left to dry and were burn under constant controllable flame. Recorded the time when the wood caught fire. Same procedures were done in the first trial except trial 10g KHCO3 and 20g NaHCO3 were weighed. Paint with 10g KHCO3 took the longest time to catch fire.

USING NANOPARTICLES TO ENHANCE POLYMER PROPERTIES FOR IMPROVED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: SPACE LUBRICANTS TO NANOLITHOGRAPHY
Sean Kshitij Mehra, Jeffrey S. Reitman
Jericho High School, Jericho, NY, USA

High performance polymers are in increasing demand by industry. Dewetting is a major problem for space lubricants. We propose that nanoparticles might be able to stabilize lubricants, such as PDMS based silicone oil. We tested this hypothesis by spincasting various nanocomposite solutions and observing dewetting. In each instance, nanoparticles reduced lubricant dewetting. We then analyzed evaporation rates, interfacial tensions, and viscosities for each solution. We showed that nanoparticles can both increase and decrease these properties. The data was incorporated into a model to predict the stabilization of lubricants by specific nanoparticles. <br><br>In nanolithography, polymer masks will soon approach molecular scales. When they do, the glass transition and modulus are expected to decrease, degrading resolution of the features. Using our derived model, we incorporated ODT/Au nanoparticles into monodisperse PS films. Nanopillars were patterned in polymer matrices, with and without filler, using contact printing. Shear modulation force microscopy revealed an increase of modulus and TG. <br><br>Our research serves as a foundation for future work regarding the stabilization of industrial polymers and will help create a general model of the effect of nanoparticles on polymers.<br><br>

NEED A LIFT? COMPARISON OF ORIGINAL WINGTIP DESIGNS
Christopher James Todd, Erik Bruce Kurtz
Hilton Head High School, Hilton Head, SC, USA

This project was designed to test airfoil performance by comparing original wingtip designs. An important issue that this problem addresses is increasing the horrendous fuel economy of commercial airliners by making airfoils more efficient. It was expected that design number 5 would create the most amount of lift and the least amount of drag because the design models the right triangle design that is often seen on other aircraft. The ratio determining efficiency was found by dividing lift over drag of ten different wingtips. <br><br>The experiment was conducted using a wind tunnel equipped with a scale to measure lift and drag in grams. Basic shapes were constructed, such as an oval, triangle and square, from balsa wood that could be fitted onto the tip of one side of the airfoil. A rectangular wingtip was placed on the opposite side as a control. After testing, it was concluded that several designs—the triangles and ovals—had a lift to drag ratio less than 1, indicating that more drag was being created than lift. Other designs—the squares and box-shapes—had a ratio greater than 1. The highest ratio was 1.25, design 8. This design utilized a square at the edge of the airfoil that created hardly any drag due to minimized surface area. It captured a majority of the air that falls off of the wing. Afterward, design 8 was moved forwards from the back of the wing to find its most important placement to improve fuel economy.<br><br>

This was determined by comparing lift to drag ratios. The experiment was conducted using a wind tunnel equipped with sensors to detect the amount of lift and drag created by the model wing placed inside of the wind tunnel. <br><br>We created ten different basic geometric shapes out of balsa wood that were to be fitted onto the tip of one side of the model wing. We placed a constant rectangular wing tip on the opposite side of the wing that remained there throughout experimentation. After testing all ten different shapes we found that several designs had a lift to drag ratio less than 1, meaning that that wing tip created more drag than lift. Other designs had a ratio greater than 1. The highest ratio was 1.25, and that was design number 8. This design placed a square wing tip at the back end of the wing, where it created hardly any drag due to minimized surface area and because it captured a vast majority of the air that falls off of the wing.<br><br>Our thanks go to the 8th Air Force Museum in Savannah, Georgia for letting us use their wind tunnel and to Jim Todd whose personal connections convinced the museum to let us experiment using their device. <br><br>

THE RUBIK'S ROBOT
Patrick D Loftus, Nathan E. Shepherd, Zachary J. Hansen
Bingham High School, South Jordan, Utah, United States of America

There are basic concepts to understanding and solving the Rubik's Cube. The cube consists of six different colors. By applying 90 or 180 degree turns upon the various faces of the Rubik's Cube you begin to solve it. To solve the cube one needs to follow a sequence. In each sequence there are many different sub-sequences, which are used to solve the cube. We have created a robot that can perform these operations. The basic structure of this robot is made out of K'nex. The Rubik's Cube is mounted directly in the center of the robot. Arms made out of K'nex turn the faces of the cube. The arms are turned by five different motors, which are connected to different kinds of actuators. Theses actuators are air powered and controlled by an air tank. They control the inward and outward movements of the arms. These motors and actuators are wired into a Multitech Interface. This interface is connected to a computer. Using a program we have written, which uses the basic multitech script, we are able to control the robot. Using CdS photocells sensors or encoders we are able to make the motors turn only 90 degrees. By programming the sequences into the computer we are able to solve a Rubik's Cube with a robot.

APPLICATIONS OF FARADAY SHIELDING
Sirish Veligati, Chelsey Bartlett, Barron Roberts
Saint Joseph Central High School, St. Joseph, MO

The purpose of this investigation was to explore applications of Faraday shielding. This was accomplished through the optimization of Faraday shield designs, engineering of an MRI-compatible adaptable Faraday shield device, and protection of living organisms from UV rays using electroplating techniques. To determine electromagnetic shielding optimum or resonance, Faraday shields of differing metals (resistivity) and designs (inductance) were exposed to a fixed microwave frequency and then altered in capacitance to determine effects of capacity on resonance. In applying Faraday shield properties to an MRI machine, designs of different encasements: cloth, laminate, and bare, were tested for their shielding efficiency. For bacterial applications, different methods and metals of electroplating were used to compare survival rates of bacteria exposed to UV light. These 3 applications were investigated to determine the possible uses of Faraday shields in non-electrical purposes.<br><br>It was found that increases in resistivity significantly decrease the shielding efficiency, use of Crossed designs significantly increases shielding efficiency, and increases in capacitance significantly decreases shielding efficiency of aluminum designs. In MRI applications, laminate encasement had the highest shielding efficiency of all other encasements. In bio-electroplating, it was found that electroplating has negative effects on bacteria, both exposed and unexposed to UV radiation.

Our project is to determine which electromagnetic properties are the most efficient at converting electrical potential energy to kinetic energy. To do this, we plan to use different configurations of coil geometry and size along with different properties of electromagnetics. We also hope to lighten he technology so that it can be used in practical purposes.<br><br> This technology can be used for military weaponry along with other means of initial propulsion suck as rocket launching or replacing steam catapults on aircraft carriers with electromagnetic ones. Right now, the technology is far too heavy to be used in conventional military means. We plan to not only make it more efficient, but also make the technology as light as possible to make it more practical for military purposes.<br><br>

DEVELOPING A NON-INTRUSIVE METHOD FOR MEASURING WALL INSULATION
Rachel Marie Jenkins, Mark Poczontek, 
D.H. Conley High School, Greenville, NC

We built a 16 x 15 x 16” box made of Styrofoam, and a 16 x 18” wall sample. We conducted four tests using combinations of the wall sample and insulation. These tests provided us with data from surfaces of known R-Values. The tests consisted of heating the box for ten minutes with a 60 watt light bulb and measuring temperature with an indoor-outdoor thermometer. We measured the highest temperature the box reached and found the temperature the box cooled to after two hours and plugged the data into Newton’s Law of Cooling. Using the k-values we solved for and the known R-Values, we were able to develop a linear relationship between the two. By determining the relationship from graphical analysis, we used the k-values to successfully predict the R-value of surfaces of unknown R-Values. After conducting tests on surfaces of unknown R-Values we researched what the R-Values of the tested surfaces should be. Once we had the suspected R-Values we compared them to the R-Values we solved for and found our results to be conclusive.

INCREASING THE EFFICIENCY OF A ROBOTIC SYSTEM USING A VISUAL AID PROGRAM
Christopher Denis McCann, Richard Odlum
Yorktown High School, Yorktown Heights, New York, USA

This project involved developing a program that allowed a robotic arm system to dynamically locate objects by interpreting its surroundings using a web camera, rather than assuming the position of the object. The program was further developed to run utilizing two robots simultaneously. The web camera was able to find objects in real time by identifying large areas of color as ‘blobs,’ and then further defining them by shape and size. Using the information obtained by the camera, the system calculated locations for the objects using trigonometry, and gave them an (x,y) coordinate in real space. Using the calculated position, the robot will attempt to carry out the given task. The success rate of these systems was tested against a non-vision robot, a sighted human, and a blindfolded human.<br><br> The experiment found that adding a vision system increased the rate of task completion by 40%, and a two robot system increased success rate by an additional 5%, as well as increasing the work area. This experiment illustrates that adding a visual interpretation system to a robot will allow the robot to correct for minor changes in the environment and therefore increase productivity.<br><br>

STIRLING ENGINES

Marion Harding HS, Marion, OH, USA & Wynford HS, Bucyrus, OH, USA

The original engineering goal was to build a Stirling engine that powered a Stirling refrigerator from simple parts so that the design could be duplicated in developing nations. The decision was made to use bicycle parts because they are readily available all over the world. The consequences of restricting the resources were that the materials available for the piston head design could not withstand the temperature that the engine reached. Therefore, the engineering goal was reconsidered and changed to focus on the Stirling refrigerator. The refrigerator was successfully built and a small, but measurable temperature difference was observed. This result encourages future work that would lead to the creation of a Stirling refrigerator. This work would include further investigation of materials and construction methods. Following this research a practical implementation of a Stirling refrigerator powered by a Stirling engine would be possible.

MAKING THE BEST BETTER: OPTIMIZING THE TIO2 SEMICONDUCTING LAYER FOR APPLICATIONS IN DYE-SENSITIZED SOLAR CELLS
Amy BC Tang, Anjali Das, 
Westview High School, Portland, OR

Titanium dioxide dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are promising inexpensive, environmentally friendly alternatives to silicon cells, but their low efficiencies have prevented commercial application. This three part study investigated the fabrication of DSSC semiconductors by analyzing the effects thickness, soaking time in dye, and addition of TiO2 nanobelts had on module efficiency and optimized each variable to improve cell performance. <br><br>DSSC’s were fabricated and efficiency calculated based on open circuit voltage, short circuit current, maximum fill factor and area of the device illuminated. These values were found by examining input voltage’s effect on current through the device. After comparing various thicknesses, it was found that a 45-micron thick semiconductor maximized cell performance. This thickness was then applied to cells that were soaked in dye for varying times. 41.5 hour soaked DSSC samples were 1000 times more efficient than 21.5 hour ones. To determine the effect of TiO2 nanobelts on cell performance, DSSC’s with semiconducting layers made of industry standard TiO2 particles were compared to TiO2 nanobelts only and another with a 5 wt% nanobelt-nanoparticle hybrid. When thickness and soaking time was fixed at their efficiency maximizing values, the TiO2 hybrid semiconductor was nine times more efficient than the original TiO2 layer and 69 times more efficient than nanobelts alone. <br><br>The application of this study allows DSSC module efficiency to surpass that of silicon solar cells while costing one-fifth of their price, allowing them to compete on the photovoltaic market and making them a viable energy alternative of the future. <br><br>

C.O.R.B.O.S. COMPUTER OPERATED ROBOTIC BLIND OPENING SYSTEM
Joshua Sheridan Roark, Derek Breal, Adam Johnson
Mercy Cross High School, Biloxi, Mississippi,USA

The objective of this project was to demonstrate how sunlight, electrical, and mechanical energy can be used to accomplish simple tasks without human intervention. If light energy can be converted into mechanical energy and connected to blinds, then the blinds can be opened without human intervention to awaken someone in the morning.<br><br> Background research and a general model design were completed. The model consisted of a window in a frame, mini-blinds and a robot housing a computer, an electric motor, and various sensors. After constructing the robot, the light sensor, motor and touch sensors were attached to the computer. Final assembly took place, and the display unit was tested to insure the desired results.<br><br> In the robot, a computer continuously monitors light intensity using a light sensor. When the intensity reaches one of two preset values (approximately those of an average sunrise or sunset), the computer activates an electric motor. Through a gear mechanism, the rotation of the drive shaft opens or closes the mini-blinds, dependant upon the intensity of the light. When pressed, the other touch sensor functions as a "snooze" feature. After a preset amount of time, the blinds reopen.<br><br> In a second phase, the robot was replaced by solar cells which monitored the light intensity in the same way. The computer was activated and opened or closed the blinds.<br><br> The objective was accomplished. Light energy can be converted into mechanical energy and transferred to blinds, which can be opened and closed without human intervention.<br><br>

EFFECTS OF LATERAL PNEUMATIC SUSPENSION ON IMPACT FORCE REDUCTION
Christopher H. Seman, Cody L. Webb, Ryan N. Lynn
Burkburnett High School, Burkburnett, TX, USA

The purpose of this project is to design a lateral suspension unit that decreases impact force by decelerating vehicle passengers. During collisions, the deceleration rate affects the force. We hypothesized that a lateral pneumatic system would decrease the deceleration, thus lowering force.<br><br> The force enacted in the cabin was calculated with a given distance, impact velocity, and constant mass. The collision unit was released from a ramp and its impact force was measured with an accelerometer. The calculated deceleration and the accelerometer's deceleration reading were used to calculate force for the collision unit and the cabin.<br><br> During testing, we discovered that increasing time/distance reduced force. By increasing these factors, deceleration is lowered. The pneumatic suspension allowed the cabin to decelerate longer, whereas the fixed cabin shortened time/distance, leading to higher deceleration and force.<br><br> Our hypothesis was correct. Pneumatic suspension lowered the force. Without suspension, force equaled 133.816X N. With suspension, force equaled 42.16X N. Let X be a constant mass. Assuming X is a real, positive number, closure supports lower force yields for suspension. For further studies, suspension for side impacts could be investigated. In this experiment, controlling temperature and testing results during different weather conditions would be favorable.

ULTRASCALE MODELING OF SUPERCAPACITORS FOR ELECTRICAL ENERGY STORAGE
Jonathan Linden Bryan, Linus Liang, 
Oak Ridge High School, Oak Ridge, TN

Given today’s energy crisis and the United States’ dependency on foreign oil, not only are local alternative energy sources a top priority but also cleaner and more efficient means of storing this energy. Currently, electrochemical energy storage (EES) systems offer significant relief in energy demands but are not advanced enough to account for the projected doubling in energy usage in the next 25 years. Further developing these current systems will also fall short of tomorrow's energy requirements. Thus, new ideas and materials are needed for significant breakthroughs to be made in EES devices. To achieve such breakthroughs, new designs must first be developed and tested. Here, we devised and simulated a plausible design using realistic models of nanoporous carbon material and an electrolyte with large-scale molecular dynamics simulations on massively parallel supercomputers. The resulting data were analyzed using a combination of visualization programs and other processing scripts to decipher the intricate relationship between system temperature, energy, electric potential and ultimately describe the functioning parameters of electrochemical energy storage system where no chemical bonds are involved. Through this research we obtained a detailed atomistic understanding of the fundamental processes that occur between the electrodes and electrolytes and a general direction for EES systems in modern capacitors energy storage devices.

SEISMIC MANAGEMENT OF UNDERWATER PIPELINE SYSTEMS UTILIZING NICKEL-TITANIUM ALLOY CONTROL GATES
John Thomas Thurmon, Rhett Lee Rumery, Lucas James Cavin
Chillicothe High School, Chillicothe, Missouri, United States

Recently there has been found large pockets of methyl hydrate, which were produced by deep sea methanogenic bacteria Methanococcus jannaschii. Thus creating the potential for the release of large volumes of gas from the seafloor, causing considerable seismic activity. This could cause an interruption in the deep sea oil-pipeline operation. This poses the question of how pipeline systems can be improved based on safety as well as mechanical simplicity. This project utilized several different developmental phases. First of all, a method to detect seismic activity had to be developed. The second phase was to develop a system to control the flow of a pipeline with a Nitinol valve. In the final phase both systems were combined to create a circuit which would detect seismic activity and automatically control the pipeline valve. Seismic activity is detected by an electromagnetic coil from a 15 inch diameter underwater speaker. The speaker produces an Alternating Current from the cone, which had to be converted to Direct Current in order to trigger the relay, which in turn causes the Nitinol valve to open and close the pipeline. From this, pipeline systems are able to detect seismic activity, and then can control valves in order to prevent loss of substances within the pipeline as well as to prevent the destruction of the surrounding environment. The system was found to be an excellent method to control the flow of a substance within a pipeline during seismic activity.

DOES WING/BODY TYPE HAVE AN AFFECT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF AN AIRPLANE?
Glenn Allen Traner, Jared Michael Loebs
Francis Howell North High School, St. Charles, MO

The purpose of the experiment was to test different wing configurations and test how the wing types affected the plane’s flight characteristics. The two body types used in the experiment were the conventional wing and tail configuration, as well as a delta wing (without tail) configuration; a lifting body design was also developed and the frame was built, but the other two plane types consumed too much time so the lifting body was left as a work in progress.<br><br>The first sets of tests were non-powered glides off a spring loaded ramp, launched down a hill. This presented a few problems when data was collected because weather conditions and the different weights of the planes. Nevertheless the data was collected. Both planes were tested multiple times at different initial velocities (determined by how far back the spring was pulled, this is one reason weight was an issue).<br><br>The conventional wing was launched at 9.25 m/s, 15.75 m/s, and 20.42 m/s. The delta wing was launched at 10.25 m/s, 10.9 m/s, and 17.72 m/s. In conclusion the wind had the most effect on the delta wing creating a stall, and the conventional wing flew the best under the given conditions.<br><br>Work is continuing on the experimentation and in the very near future the planes will be tested with the appropriate experimental controls and in a controlled environment. Another possibility for the experiment is to test the planes with a small jet engine to determine flight characteristics during longer duration flights.<br><br>

FINDING THE FAULT: HAZARDS IN AIRCRAFT WIRING
Brittany Baker, Sydney Chamberlin
Jordan High School, Sandy, Utah, USA

Arcing can occur in wires when there is a fray in the wire or its insulation, thus disrupting the flow of current which in turn causes a change in impedance. Aircraft wiring is especially susceptible to damage due to the extremes in G-forces, air pressure, humidity, and temperature changes that it is exposed to during flight. Currently, the most common method of finding aircraft wiring faults is through manual inspection using a mirror and a flashlight. This procedure is very time consuming and often fails to locate potentially hazardous faults.<br><br> The purpose of this experiment is to locate a hazardous fault condition in aircraft wiring prior to complete failure. The hypothesis is: it is possible to locate a hazardous fault condition on aircraft wiring using a time domain reflectometer (TDR).<br><br> For the experiment pairs of identical wires, damaged and functional, were connected to the TDR, and the TDR sent an electrical pulse down the wire. Part of the signal was reflected back and the TDR measured this reflection. A software program called Matlab was then used to create graphs of the TDR data that had been recorded for each set of wires. The first graph plotted the average voltage of the good and bad wires, the absolute value of the difference between the good and bad wires, and the standad deviation of the difference. The second graph plotted the impedance of the line. The graphs were analyzed and predictions were made concerning the location of a fray. In all cases where a fray could be visually confirmed, the actual location of the fray was within 0.6 m of the predicted location. From the results, there was sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis. The TDR is extremely sensitive, but does not operate at 100% accuracy. The TDR can correctly identify the area of hazard, making it possible to fix the wire by replacing the section of the wire containing the potential fault.

DIESEL, CORN OIL, OR MIXTURE: WHICH FUEL TYPE WILL RUN OUR FARM TRACTOR FARTHER AND LONGER?
Amanda Lynne Chapman, Fred Leon Grubb, IV
Musselman High School, Inwood, West Virginia, United States

The purpose of this project is to determine which of three different fuel types; corn oil, diesel, or a 50% mixture will run our farm tractor farther and longer. Our hypothesis is that if we combine diesel and corn oil fuel at a 50% mixture rate, then the tractor will run farther and longer than using the diesel and corn oil fuels, exclusively.<br><br>First, we set up and marked a tractor course and measured the lap distance. Then we processed corn oil into a fuel, letting it set for 12 hours. An alternative fuel tank and line was attached to the tractor. On three different days a trial was conducted on each fuel type, rotating the sequence of the fuels, to determine how far (in laps) and how long (in minutes) the tractor ran on ½ gallon of each fuel at 1500 RPMs with the same driver. The tractor had to be reprimed and towed to the starting line after each trial.<br><br>In both time and distance, the mixture fuel outperformed the diesel and the corn oil fuels in the total and mean measurements.<br><br>In conclusion, our hypothesis was correct-that if we combine diesel and corn oil fuel at a 50% mixture rate, then the tractor will run longer and farther than using the diesel and corn oil fuels exclusively. The mixed fuel was the most efficient fuel for our farm tractor.<br><br>With the increasing costs of fuel, it appears that alternate fuel sources must be considered for everyday use.<br><br>

HOVER DUCK

Lowery Freshman Center, Allen Texas, United States

The problem that proposed this experiment was to make a homemade hovercraft that supports 157 pounds,and is powered by an electric 110 mph,7.5 amp leaf blower. Although the testing weight was 157 pounds, the scientists were able to test up to 300 pounds.This experiment involved the hovercraft being tested for speed capabilities of the homemade hovercraft over various surfaces such as grass, concrete, hardwood floor, and carpet.<br><br> In order for the test to be conducted, a thirty-foot area was sectioned off. The hovercraft was to be pulled across the thirty-foot area. A white fifty-foot nylon rope was used to pull the hovercraft across the finish line by two constant people. Another constant of 157 pounds was placed on the hovercraft. This was a reasonable weight to test on each surface, as it was not too heavy yet not too light. Another person timed the hovercraft from the starting point to when the hovercraft completely passed the finish line. This method was used on each surface ten times. <br><br> The hypothesis was that the hovercraft would have the fastest times on hardwood floor. The hypothesis was indeed correct. The hovercraft operated sluggishly on carpet, grass, and friction was higher on the concrete, because the surfaces absorbed the air rather than let it out of the skirt.<br><br>

STEALING FROM NATURE
Todd Michael Ollre, Robert Graham, Cameron Stadtfeld
William B. Travis High School, Richmond, TX

The purpose of Stealing From Nature is to use biomimicry to design and test and environmentally sustainable, energy efficient and self powered commercial building. The natural substance we are “stealing” from is the use of biomimicry. The ventilation seen in the project is the byproduct of the system of passive heating and cooling seen in Sub-Saharan termite mounds. To test the architectural design, a two foot by two foot by three foot model was assembled using one eight inch particle board, wood glue, and silicon caulking. The model contains six floors, a roof and attic structure, and cool and hot air chambers and vents specific to the design. Holes were then drilled into one side of the building, two on each floor, to insert the temperature probes. The model was set up in an eleven by eight foot by eight and a half foot room (LxWxH). A 1,000 watt theatre light was then set up to shine directly on one face of the building. Readings of temperature were taken using Logger Pro and probes at 90 minute intervals; 90 minutes for heating, 90 minutes for cooling. After analysis of the data, the trends of our experimentation have shown cooler temperatures at faster rates using the whole system of ventilation. In conclusion, the structural ventilation system yields an increased rate of cooling as well as overall lower temperatures in the 90 minute intervals.

BACTERIAL FUEL CELLS: UTILIZING E. COLI'S METABOLISM TO PRODUCE ENERGY
Quinn Alexander Morris, Courtney Henrietta Fox, May Liu
The North Carolina School of Science and Math

A fuel cell is an electrical device that convers fuel and an oxidant into electrical energy. This team studied bacterial fuel cells (BFCs), a special type of fuel cell that uses electrons produced during bacterial respiration to produce electrial energy. These electrons are harvested using a mediator, which captures the elctrons produced and carries them to the electrode. Using low-cost and readily available materials, BFCs provide a source of renewable energy. Three E. coli-powered fuel cells connected in series produced 1.316 volts. Once this voltage was achieved, studies were shifted to increasing voltage. Different combinations of components were tested, showing that a combination of dialysis tubing membrane, graphite electrodes, and a methylene blue mediator produced the highest voltage.<br><br>Previous studies suggested that low g-forces caused increased performance in BFCs. To test the effects of g-forces on the output of the BFCs, six were designed and flown abord a Orion 30.1 Sub-Orbital Sounding Rocket. One series of fuel cells indicated an incerse relationship between voltage and g-forces, whereas data from the second series were inconclusive. Future studies will be focused on improving the current by testing the effects of cell size on current, as well as the effects of anaerobic conditions on the output of the BFC.

Long Beach High School, Long Beach, NY; Jericho High School, Jericho, NY, USA

Future advances in tissue engineering depend upon discovery of optimal cellular architecture to ultimately control the organization and morphology of cells. The extracellular matrix (ECM), through its organization of proteins and polysaccharides, provides the necessary platform to guide cell morphology. Fibronectin (Fn), an excellent adhesive protein in the ECM, undergoes spontaneous fibrillogenesis when contacting 28% SPS on silicon substrates. It is additionally important to understand differences among the organization of adhesive proteins (Fn), and non-adhesive ones (albumin), and non-protein molecules (glucose), all present in the ECM. <br><br>The present research focuses upon different modalities using micropatterning to impact cell morphology through protein and polysaccharide organization on silicon and gold/silicon substrates. Results showed that Fn, albumin, and glucose all organized on SPS stamped or coated Si or Si/Au substrates. However, cells only organized on the Fn matrix, did not adhere to albumin, and adhered yet formed no distinctive patterning on glucose.

Chillicothe High School, Chillicothe, Missouri, USA

The project was conducted in an effort to engineer a prosthetic device for above-knee amputees. It was inspired by a local scuba diver who attempted to swim and dive without any aid. He experienced trouble with both buoyancy and movement. The project had two prototypes before the current phase. These were simply to test designs for knee joints and to improve on the natural kick of the leg. The third prototype was constructed using the harness of an actual prosthesis. The test was tested with a human test subject to show comfort, usability, and how the efficiency compared to a normal leg. The design includes ad reverse knee hinge, which allows the amputee to use the full power of their leg without wasting any energy. The most powerful portion of the underwater kick is the downstroke and during the downstoke of this model the joint locks for provide maximum thrust.

Our engineering goal was to create a three-axis CNC (Computer Numerical Controlled) machine and to gain experience in the field of CNC robotics and engineering. This technology takes drawings of three dimensional objects and converts it to a code. The machine will take the code and cut an exact copy out of wood or metal. <br><br>The purpose of our project was to lower the cost of the construction of a CNC machine so that the average homeowner could afford to buy it. With our design we limited the cost to less than one-thousand dollars and made a CNC machine that was just as efficient as its corporate counterpart. Although it made construction marginally more expensive, we decided to make the circuit boards from scratch so that we would be able to diagnose any problems that might arise and fix them.<br><br>Learning to read electrical schematics, functions of the circuit board components, soldering and wiring were all vital parts in this project.<br><br>We chose to design a table that could be built with common woodworking tools yet is very stable.<br><br>Great care must be used to get the axis rods parallel. This allows the components to move freely and accurately.<br><br>The end result is a CNC machine that cost less than five percent of a commercial CNC machine, while still maintaining very close tolerances.<br><br>

POLYCAPROLACTONE-CHITOSAN NANOCOMPOSITE BIOMATERIALS FOR WOUND HEALING AND TISSUE ENGINEERING
Ashish Mohan Bakshi, Wilfred Wong
Manhasset High School, Manhasset, NY; Herricks High School, New Hyde Park, NY 

Over the past several decades, polymers have been widely applied in biomedical fields. Wound healing and tissue engineering applications require biodegradable scaffold materials that function as a template for cell adhesion and proliferation and possess suitable mechanical and biocompatible properties. Thus far it has been difficult to combine these characteristics and maintain a low production cost.<br><br> Polycaprolactone (PCL) is a versatile, synthetic, semicrystalline, biodegradable polymer with favorable mechanical and thermal properties for material production. However, its intrinsic hydrophobicity limits its potential as a biomaterial. Chitosan is a natural, semicrystalline polymer that exhibits excellent biocompatibility but poor physical properties and thus requires intensive processing to meet physical requirements.<br><br> In this study, two approaches for engineering composite materials – traditional polymer blending and nanoscale engineering of layered clay composites – were combined to create optimized PCL-Chitosan-Clay blends for biomaterials applications. PCL crystallization phenomena were first studied in this project using spun-cast thin-films, to observe the crystalline morphology. Clay nanoplatelets were found to induce dense spherulitic nucleation, potentially improving blending. Analysis of solvent-cast composites indicated successful blending. Nanocomposite blends exhibited significantly improved biocompatibility versus the PCL control and PCL-Chitosan samples and improved mechanical and thermal properties versus Chitosan and non-nanocomposite blends.<br><br> PCL and Chitosan were successfully blended and combined with nanoclays without further chemical modification. PCL-Chitosan-Clay nanocomposites have demonstrated great promise as optimized biomaterials.

HOVERCRAFT SYMMETRY AND LIFT/LOAD CAPACITY
Samantha Lindesy Saenger, Amy Duong
W T Woodson, Fairfax, Virginia, USA

A hovercraft attains its hover when air is forced into a flexible skirt where it is trapped, forming a high pressure, circulating column of air called a plenum chamber. The pressure from the plenum chamber forces the hovercraft off the ground until a small gap forms between the skirt and the ground when air escapes, as this continually occurs and equilibrium is formed. <br><br>It was hypothesized that a circular hovercraft, because it exactly matches the shape of the plenum chamber, would maximize the amount of air in its skirt being formed into the plenum chamber thereby giving it the greatest lift when compared to non-circular crafts with the same skirt volume. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that there is a direct relation between symmetry and lift/load capacity. After building and testing six hovercrafts (circle, oval, square, rectangle, equilateral triangle, and isosceles triangle) the best performing hovercraft turned out to be the square, bearing 10kg more than the circle. Aside from this however, there was a direct correlation between symmetry and lift/load capacity found after analyzing the data from this experiment. After research and experimentation, it was discovered that a temperature difference in the two days the circle and the square were tested accounted for this deviation as colder air is denser and can bear more weight for the same volume. When tested at the same temperature the circle out-lifted the square<br><br>

THE PELTIER EFFECT: ELIMINATING THE USE OF FREON IN AUTOMOBILE AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEMS
Tyler Glen Lyon, Daniel Rees Winegar
Riverton High School, Riverton Utah, United States of America

Our purpose is to replace the current compressor based and to take advantage of the abilities of a Peltier effect based solid state by engineering an air-conditioning system that would be more efficient, more economical, and more environmentally friendly.<br><br>Advantages of a Peltier effect air-conditioning system are numerous. When polarity of the current is reversed, the heat exchange reverses and the unit can be used as a heater (independent of the engine block).

REVOLUTIONARY PLASTICS: SURFACES THAT SELF-STERILIZE
Kara Allyn Morgenstern, Miki Duruz
Long Beach High School, Long Beach, NY, USA

The increase in the amount of disease spreading throughout public buildings such as schools and hospitals has become a major concern in the public health sector today. This project in its present form focuses on the 'retrofitting' of existing buildings to create surfaces that are capable of self-sterilization.<br><br> Our pior research indicates that when added to water-based polyacrylic paint, 0.5mL to 2mL of 500ppm colloidal silver (health food store) effectively acts as an anti-microbial agent. This year, the colloidal silver, which was originally in an aqueous solution, was centrifuged to leave only a silver pellet. Through the process of dehydration, all water was removed from the solution by adding an anhydrous solvent (methanol). The solution was mixed into a homogenous solution and then added to epoxy glue. We injected varying concentrations of the solution using a sterile syringe, at 0.01 mL increments, from 0.01 mL to 0.2 mL, into 5 grams of epoxy glue material. The control sample had no colloidal silver solution added to the 5-gram epoxy material. Four samples were made for each concentration, in this manner. The epoxy was allowed to harden overnight and after hardening, was left out in a normal building setting to allow for interaction and potential growth to occur. Using a sterile cotton swab, each plastic material was swabbed and plated onto McConkey agar plates. Plates were sealed with 3M Masking Plate Tape and incubated at 37oC for 48 hours. Plates were observed only and the growth was analyzed and counted using a colony counter. We found that 0.2 mL of colloidal silver in 5 grams of epoxy was still the most effective concentration in eliminating bacterial growth. The sterilizing effect of the colloidal silver was maintained in the finished products. We believe that discovery of an antibacterial plastic product could revolutionize efforts to create safe, germ-free surfaces.

Our purpose is to replace the current compressor based and to take advantage of the abilities of a Peltier effect based solid state by engineering an air-conditioning system that would be more efficient, more economical, and more environmentally friendly.<br><br>Advantages of a Peltier effect air-conditioning system are numerous. When polarity of the current is reversed, the heat exchange reverses and the unit can be used as a heater (independent of the engine block). It is also more efficient because it is completely electrical and runs off the alternator of a car, which runs about sixty percent more efficient than the current compressor system. It is more economical because it would cost less to maintain.

PHOTOTROPIC NANOTECHNOLOGY VIA MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC PROPULSION
Gleb Kuznetsov, Charles McGuire, Lai Xue
West High School, Salt Lake City, UT, United States

The MHD Phototrope combines technologies of magnetohydrodynamic propulsion and photovoltaic cells in a single unit able to rotate and orient in response to light. The project involves mathematical analysis, design considerations, and component experimentation with the aim of establishing operation on the macro scale and demonstrating increase in efficiency with decrease in scale. <br><br> Optimization considerations lead to a circular design for the MHD channel with one electrode concentric to the other. A magnetic field is established externally via permanent magnets for experimentation. Two or more photovoltaic cells are carefully wired so that the cell(s) receiving the greatest photon radiation pressure determines the direction of electric current flow. Upon immersion in an electrolytic fluid, ions serve as charge carriers between the electrodes and are acted upon by the magnetic field according to the Lorentz Force principle, yielding net motion of water.<br><br> Leading up to the materialization of the final design, each component is tested independently. A circular MHD demonstration is used to establish the relationship between current input and work output. A battery-powered prototype demonstrates implementation of the MHD engine. Circuitry operation is demonstrated using an analog model. The battery-powered prototype is then converted to being powered by a single photovoltaic.<br><br> With basic operation established on the macro scale, power conversion data and a physical dimension proportionality argument demonstrate increase in efficiency with decrease in scale. Absence of moving parts and no logical processor requirements for basic operation make shrinking the system limited only by developments in micro and nano scale engineering.<br><br>

COMPUTER ANALYSIS OF BACTERIAL COLONY GROWTH OVER TIME
Devin Lane, Ben Buford
Benson Polytechnic High School, Portland OR, 97266, USA

MicroKit is a project designed to quickly and accurately count the number of bacterial colonies in a culture plate and record this data over time. It was conceptualized as a system that would not require human intervention outside of initial setup and manipulation of the data. All data is saved in the project, meaning that any calculations can be performed on demand.<br><br>MicroKit is organized into two major sections, MicroCount and MicroLink. MicroCount is a computer software application that performs the image capture, data recording and image analysis. It is also capable of automatically controlling a microscope to obtain a higher resolution image of the culture plate, but for our purpose we generated pictures of bacterial colonies using a computer and analyzed these. After the data is captured, MicroCount analyzes each image by first applying user specified preprocessing routines to prepare the image for recognition. After the image is prepared, the number of colonies are counted and recorded. This data can then be used by other plugins to prepare summaries or other statistical analyzations.<br><br>MicroLink is a USB-based hardware device that connects the computer to the microscope. Through this device the computer is given direct control over the microscope’s functions. The device receives commands directly from the MicroCount program and turns on the appropriate relay to toggle the motor that will produce the movement indicated by the program. MicroLink is designed to work with any motorized microscope, but an adapter must be made for each new microscope model.

THE DETECTION OF ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE AND C-REACTIVE PROTEIN USING A MINIATURIZED ELECTROCHEMICAL BIOSENSOR FOR CLINICAL AND FUTURE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS
Joanne Helen Wang, Benita Tjoe
Hathaway Brown School, Shaker Heights, OH, 44122, USA

The purpose of this research is to develop effective and inexpensive biosensors to detect the biomarkers Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), an indicator of bone and liver disease, and C-Reactive Protein (CRP), an indicator of risk of heart attack and stroke. Simultaneous detection of both biomarkers is important because patients with heart disease are more likely to have liver disease. The biosensor prototypes were miniaturized versions of previously developed sensors capable of ALP and CRP detection. Miniaturization was advantageous, allowing for increased sensitivity of the sensor which permitted detection of significantly lower body levels. It was also attractive because patients only yield a few microliters of blood for diagnosis. Using a three-electrode sensor, a simplified single-step reaction was developed to detect ALP. The exact same sensor prototype was used to detect CRP. However, there were small modifications the electrodes of the ALP and CRP sensors. Iridium was added to the carbon working and counter electrodes of the ALP sensor to reduce interference from other electrochemically active substances in a body system. With the same purpose, the carbon working electrode of the CRP sensor was modified to have a permselective membrane after the enzyme tyrosinase was immobilized on it. At about 37ºC, ALP was electrochemically detected at human body levels (10-300 IU/L). Over a voltage window of -0.7V~0.4V versus a Ag/AgCl reference electrode, cyclic voltammetry quantified ALP through analysis of current output of phenol oxidation. At about 25ºC, i-t scans were primarily used to quantify CRP, which was detected at low concentrations (1-4 mg/L), through detection of hydrogen peroxide. A good linear relationship between amount of CRP and the sensor’s current output was found. A good logarithmic relationship between amount of ALP and the sensor’s current output was found. Further research with the sensor indicated the sensor was capable of accurately detecting levels of ALP in human serum. Future research will include developing the sensor's capability of detecting CRP in human serum, along with other biomarkers.

DEVELOPING A CONTROL METHODOLOGY FOR EFFICIENT TINTING OF ELECTROCHROMIC WINDOWS TO SQUINT...OR TO TINT: YEAR III
Ananth Ram, Arun Venkatraman
R.C. Clark High School, Plano, TX, United States of America

Electrochromic windows are special glasses that contain an electrochromic substance that darkens when a small voltage is applied. By using the variables of user-set goal temperature, internal temperature, external sunlight, and sunlight transmitted in through the window, a stable control mechanism can be developed to regulate the tint of the electrochromic window.<br><br> A control methodology for the EC window tinting was derived from experimental data, which was then programmed with Q-BASIC. To observe the program in action, a real-time simulation was run with the program which outputted the Needed IPVC (NIPVCO) value. When the NIPVCO value was compared graphically with temperature over cycles, the result was an inverse relationship. The ration between differential temperature and the NIPVC value was consistent, having a standard deviation value of only 0.002519324. Based on the low standard deviation value, the program worked as a stand-alone control system.<br><br> In order to simulate a real internal environment more accurately, another enclosure was built to house a water cooling system. The EC window with the control program in combination with the cooling system proved to be more effective than the cooling system working alone by making the temperature drop lower and closer to the set goal temperature. The developed methodology can be further generalized by integrating more variables that will allow for a more flexible and applicable usage of the window. The eventual objective is to apply the control method into a microcontroller which can then by put to use with an EC window. <br><br>

SILICON METAL-INSULATOR-SEMICONDUCTOR FIELD-EFFECT TRANSISTOR PROTOTYPES FOR SRTIO3 MISFET FABRICATION
Colin Patrick Drummond, Daniel McKeon
Breck School, Minneapolis, MN, USA

This paper details an attempt to fabricate a metal-insulator-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MISFET), using a strontium titananate (SrTiO3) substrate. The MISFET for our project was designed to induce a change in the superconducting temperature of the transistor, made possible since doped super-cooled SrTiO3 aquires the property of superconductivity. This effect creates a potentially valuable component in microelectronic fabrication of superconducting devices. <br><br><br> We first fabricated a MISFET prototype using a silicon substrate. We were unable to characterize the electrical capabilities of our first prototype because of sonication. Since sonication dislodged gold from the substrate, we altered our procedure so that we only sonicated before sputtering and then stored the substrate between depositions to keep it clean. The second difficulty we encountered was a faulty QCM crystal, which we were able to replace.<br><br><br> On our SrTiO3 substrate MISFET prototype, we made a few changes to the procedure. We changed the way we loaded the masks and we substituted aluminum for the point contacts in the second prototype, because there was lower resistivity between aluminum and SrTiO3 than there was between gold and SrTiO3. Due to the fragility of the SrTiO3 substrate, we had to elevate the mask above it, which caused problems when evaporating aluminum onto the substrate. We increased the radius of the coil to match the radius of the aluminum wire, but since the tungsten could not be coiled tightly enough the aluminum melted out of the coil.<br><br>

This project demonstrates how it is possible to create a Wireless Power Source by using a transmitting antenna. The device takes electrical energy through the antenna which then converts them to electromagnetic waves (hertz waves). The Hertz waves are then received by a receiving antenna and converted back into usable electricity. A primitive version was origianly done by Heinrich Hertz in the late 1800's.

USING SUPERCRITICAL CARBON DIOXIDE TO ENHANCE POLYMER COMPATIBILIZATION AND METALLIZATION IN ULTRA-THIN FILMS
Chelsea Gloria Gordon, Feini Qu
Half Hollow Hills High School East, Dix Hills, New York, United States

The thermodynamic properties of polymers preclude blending and hinder polymer metallization by inducing dewetting. This study examines the effects of Supercritical Carbon Dioxide (scCO2) on polymer compatibilization and metallization. Samples composed of both Polyethylene (PE) and Deuterated Polystyrene (dPS) were exposed to scCO2 at points along the density fluctuation ridge. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) measurements revealed a sharp decrease in the melting point and contact angle of PE/dPS blends, and Dynamic and Static Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry data verified that phase homogeneity was achieved by exposure to scCO2. Samples of pure Polystyrene (PS) and PS with gold (Au) nanoparticles were also prepared and exposed to scCO2. Chromium (Cr) was then deposited on the polymer surface through vapor deposition. X-Ray Reflectivity and AFM images confirmed that the addition of Au nanoparticles to the films and the exposure of these films to scCO2 improved Cr adhesion. Calculations showed a decrease in interfacial tension of up to 32% and X-Ray data indicated increased interfacial width in metallized samples. These results indicate that scCO2 is able to improve the compatibility of previously immiscible polymers as well as facilitate metal adhesion following vapor deposition. This technology can be applied on a large-scale level in the future to create higher quality and longer lasting products.

TWO-CYCLE ENGINE EMISSIONS
Scott Anthony Horton, Tom Bereza, Aaron Ridenour
Pennfield High School; Harper Creek High School, Battle Creek, MI, USA 

The goal of this experiment was to look at five emissions gasses for the ever-fading two-cycle engine, with the hopes of improvement. To do this the experiment was set up to test emissions by using five different gas/oil ratios with five different mixing oils. The different ratios ranged above and below the manufacturers recommended. The oils included petroleum base stock oil, a synthetic blend oil, and three organic oils; corn oil, peanut oil, and canola oil. For the analysis of the data collected in this experiment, three hypotheses were created. The first hypothesis analyzed the change in the five exhaust gases as we varied the type of oil used in the gas/oil mixture. The second hypothesis analyzed the change in the five exhaust gases as the gas/oil ratios were varied. The final hypothesis was an argument to prove that the change in exhaust gases was due to the varying in oil types or fuel ratios, not due to a change in the engines mechanics. <br><br>The results we found from our experiment showed that there was a difference between each of the different oil types. It also showed that different oil ratios had no effect on the engines emissions, and that the engine did not change from the beginning of the testing to the end of the testing. <br><br>

DESIGNING A RIGID RADIOPAQUE HYDROGEL FOR BIOMEDICAL APPLICATION
Mohan Gautam, Ankuri Desai
Sachem High School East, Farmingville, NY, USA

The purpose of this investigation was to determine the suitability of a PEO-PPO-PEO triblock copolymer, sold by BASF® as F127, as a replacement of the nucleus pulposus. The nucleus pulposus normally acts as a ‘shock absorber’ in the spine, but can become herniated and push on nerve fibers, causing lower back pain. The surgical implications involving F127 were studied through its thermal expansion. Its viscosity was studied to determine its comparison to that of the nucleus pulposus. F127 was combined with Iron Pentacarbonyl in attempt to magnetize the former. F127 was also combined with minimal multi-chained F127 (which is much more expensive and stronger) to strengthen single-chained F127’s stress resistance. Significant expansion was demonstrated at 37°C, showing F127’s potential to be injected into the body as a liquid, whereupon it would naturally expand to fill the nucleus pulposus cavity. A novel viscometer was built which showed the viscosity of F127 to match that of the nucleus pulposus, and a combination of F127 with Iron Pentacarbonyl resulted in the latter’s decomposition to Fe within the polymer, leaving iron nanoparticles. If the polymer was inserted into the body, Iron’s high molecular weight would cause a deflection of x-rays, enabling it to be located within the body via x-ray imaging. The polymer showed a significant increase in resistance to stress with only a 3% addition of multi-chained F127, which is more cost effective to use than pure high molecular weight F127. <br><br>

LEBENMONITOR: PROTECTING THE MASSES FROM THE SILIENT KILLER
Michael Getahun Hailemariam, Brook Kassa
Piney Woods School, Piney Woods, MS, USA

The Lebenmonitor watch is designed to detect and contact emergency centers when a patient’s blood pressure reaches an abnormal level leading to heart failure. As the blood pressure goes to a danger zone (systolic blood pressure of 160mmHg or higher or diastolic blood pressure of 100mmHg or higher) using its GPS, the watch will locate the nearest healthcare center and contact it using the transponder. <br><br> The Lebenmonitor started in May 2005 and is still continuous. The first part of the project was to study the five main parts: the heart monitor receiver, the chest strap, the GPS, the transponder, and the programming. Then come the designing and connecting the parts to accomplish the purpose of the project.<br><br> The receiver in the watch will read the radio signal from the strap around the chest to determine the current heart rate. The GPS locates the site of the patient and sends the information to the transponder installed. The Lebenmonitor uses a transponder with microcontroller interface called U3280M.. The transponder is programmed to keep the location of the person until it receives a message from the heart monitor receiver. After the transponder gets the warning through data compression, it will send the information with the patient’s medical history to the satellite by higher frequency. <br><br> The patient is required to have a subscription with a service provider. When the transponder sends the information to the satellite, the satellite will check the identification and sends for help to the nearest emergency center. <br><br> In conclusion, in this time where high blood pressure is the leading cause of death, people must be able to go anywhere and feel safe about their high blood pressure. The Lebenmonitor will accomplish this purpose as a life saving machine. <br><br>

SOCIALLY INTEGRATED ROBOTS: SUSTAINABLE ROBOTIC COGNITION IN A SOCIOECONOMIC MODEL
Pascal Anthony Carole, Remy Gerard Carole, Aaron Thomas Maturen
Saginaw Arts & Sciences Academy/Heritage High School, Saginaw, Michigan, USA

This project proposes an innovative shift in robotic social cognition by developing socially integrated robots. The sustainability of such robotic cognition is tested by building and observing the operation of four robotic types within a socioeconomic model. All components have been conceived, designed and built by team members - four robot types (Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta), a Base Station and a System of Government. Alpha (Explore Bot) maps the field, identifies obstacles and relays this to its robot-partners through the Base Station. Beta (Crane Bot) loads and unloads Gamma (Transport Bot). Delta (Guide Bot) beeps to guide the visually impaired through areas mapped out by Alpha. It signals loud noises to the hearing impaired by flashing a strobe light sequentially with sound waves. The Base Station regulates the SIR society, monitors Potential Energy (PE) usage and liaises with human society. The Government provides community structure for robotic cooperation, such as a reward system in which SIRs can recharge PE after successful task completion. At inception, SIRs can do their specified tasks. As they share and access environment data, collaborative capability increases. Results indicate that Blue Tooth technology, serial and parallel communication, digital and analog electronics and programming in C and C++ have been successfully applied. Robots demonstrate collaborative and task-specific functionality and can therefore reduce human labor hours and assume caregiver roles to some extent. The intercommunication and reward systems proved to be suitable for motivating robotic cooperation. Recommendations have been made regarding possible enhancements to the system.

THE EFFECTS OF SUPERCRITICAL CARBON DIOXIDE ON POSS NANOPARTICLE SEGREGATION AND THE METALLIZATION OF PS AND PMMA THIN FILMS
Jamie Erin Rosengard, Brienne Ashley Kugler
Half Hollow Hills High School West, Dix Hills, NY 11746, USA

Metallization has become integral to the world of electronics. Unfortunately, the current method is problem laden, and does not generate samples with the greatest productivity. This experiment aims to determine whether nanotechnology and Supercritical Fluid(SCF) Technology can rectify this dilemma. We utilize POSS nanoparticles and scCO2 on polystyrene(PS) and polymethyl-methacrylate(PMMA) thin films to test these two processes. Nanoparticle segregation is mandatory to metallization; therefore, we also study under what circumstances POSS best segregates. <br><br> Data obtained from Atomic Force Microscopy(AFM) indicated several important conclusions regarding segregation. According to pictorial data, PS was more effective than PMMA in facilitating POSS segregation. Furthermore, it is apparent that increased concentrations of POSS allowed for an increased amount of segregation. Finally, we conclude that samples at thicknesses of 1500 Å produce the most significant amount of segregation due to the low density layer at the sample surface created by scCO2 exposure. Our experimentation also yielded significant conclusions regarding metallization. While the addition of POSS and SCF exposure decreased tension in PMMA samples, they did not significantly alter it within PS samples. Because the latter displayed greater POSS segregation, we conclude that POSS and Chromium, the specific metal used, are incompatible. <br><br>

THE CAPTURING AND UTILIZATION OF WASTED ENERGY - A SECOND YEAR STUDY
Janelle Marie Goettman, Michelle Elise Alfert
Burkburnett High School, Burkburnett, TX, United States

The purpose of this project is to introduce and improve upon a globally efficient way of reusing wasted energy. This project is the result of a need to find a more cost-effective and efficient alternative to current energy uses. This experiment proved to be most prone to our capabilities and interests. Once again, parallel to last year’s study, we know that in the most productive hands, this idea can become a nationwide, even universal, approach to improving the existing energy efficiency of our vehicles. Our goal in this project was to engineer and develop a system that would capture and utilize the wasted energy required to bring a forward moving vehicle to a stop, and then utilize that wasted energy to assist that vehicle in regaining forward motion. <br><br> Our idea was tested by the construction of two different prototypes, each designed with the same objective, but different techniques meant to achieve this objective. Project 1A focused on a predominantly primitiv e electrical approach using an attached motor as a generator for electrical energy that could be stored until needed. Project 2A reverted back to a predominantly mechanical approach using a large flywheel to store energy and momentum. These two projects did indeed accomplish our goal, but both with their own advantages and disadvantages. <br><br> Project 1A produced a potential efficiency of 66.4%. Project 2A resulted in a 51.6% potential efficiency while in all actuality of our experimentation, its actual efficiency proved to be 8.57% whereas Project 1A produced an actual efficiency of only 1.2%. Both projects ran smoo thly and were able to initiate the wheel in regaining its forward motion without any assistance from the motor. However, an even higher efficiency could be achieved in lab quality prototypes.<br><br> Our goal was indeed accomplished in both of the different projects constructed. Our objective was to capture and store normally wasted energy, and use it to resume a vehicle in forward motion using electrical or mechanical means. Each system required no manual operation that wasn’t potentially adaptable with a higher abundance of resources. Optimistically, we would like to place this fundame ntal idea into the most productive hands that will refine this idea and distribute it to the general public.<br><br>

NEW GYPSUM-BASED COMPOSITE: A SUSTAINABLE ALTERNATIVE TO POLYURETHANE WASTES
Douglas da Silva Vallada
Fundacao Escola Tecnica Liberato Salzano Vieira da Cunha, Novo Hamburgo, BRASIL

The consumption of polyurethane (PU) has experienced a constant increase because of the excellent properties and durability, which has promoted the accumulation of large amounts of waste. In order to provide a destination to this waste, this project aims at verifying the physical, mechanical and chemical properties of the new composites produced from polyurethane wastes, in one or more compatible matrices. Thus, I collected samples of wastes from the manufacturing process of shoe soles (PU-A) and technical parts in polyurethane (PU3). For the application in the composite, I submitted the wastes to the grinding and micronization processes and determined their characteristics through techniques, such as, scanning electronic microscopy and thermogravimetry. I selected as matrix a gypsum with quick setting time. After applying the wastes in the matrix and production of test specimens, I analyzed the morphological structure of the composite and verified its mechanical strength. In the compressive test, I tested four substitution percentages of gypsum mass, by waste: 0, 10, 15 and 20%, with the water/gypsum ratio from the normal consistency (0,54) and hand molding. For the impact test, I maintained the same water/gypsum ratio, form of molding and the contents of 0, 10 and 15%. I verified that the increase of the waste content causes a decrease of the compressive strength, being the better results obtained with the composite of PU3. On the other hand, the PU-A conferred toughness to the matrix, increasing considerably the impact strength as the waste content was increased.

UNIAXIALLY ALIGNED ELECTROSPUN NANOFIBERS
Ales Stejskal
Letohradske Soukrome Gymnazium, Letohrad, CZECH REPUBLIC

One of the most promising methods for fabricating polymer nanofibers is electrospinning which in the conventional arrangement provide randomly ordered nanofibrous layers. This work performs a modification of a collector electrode in the electrospinning process to reach uniaxially aligned fiber structure. Specifically a rotating cylinder with the fully conductive surface (type A) and wire cylinder (type B) were used as collectors. It was purpose to determine successfulness of aligning by utilizing of these cylinder collectors.<br><br> Nanofibers were fabricated in apparatus for electrospinning. At first randomly ordered nanofibers were obtained on a plate electrode. Then experiments with rotating cylinders type A and B were performed to obtain uniaxially aligned nanofibers. Obtained samples of nanofibers were scanned by electron microscope. Then exact image analysis was done to evaluate percentage successfulness of aligning of the both methods and to get the average diameter of the nanofibers too.<br><br> The fibers made onto the plate electrode and cylinder electrodes A and B have average diameters (391 ± 82) nm, (367 ± 87), (463 ± 89) nm, respectively. In total, 64 % of the aligned nanofibers by the fully conductive surface cylinder felt within the range of (90 ± 10)° . However, 94% of the fibers prepared onto the wire cylinder felt in the same range. This way was verified the both types of rotating cylinders can align fibers into one direct but the wire one is much more convenient for aligning of nanofibers.<br><br>

THE DIAGNOSTIC ANALYSIS WITH VISIBLE LIGHT OF ACETONE COMPARED TO GLUCOMETER DETECTION AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF ACETONE RELATED VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS
Elizabeth Sara Ross
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, FL

A laser spectroscopic device was made in order to centralize on glucose-acetonic breath biomarkers and individual spectral fingerprints needed to detect absorption range through varying the angle of incidence and reflection of the devices windows. The device measures gas chromatography though a cavity ringdown spectrometer, concave nucleometers, and mirrors coated with gallium arsenide and aluminum. The light source was through spectrometer, laser vectral lamp, and helium cadmium laser and detects the maximum path length and optical transmission that the light can absorb through the breath. Through the manipulation of output light intensity of dual wavelength acetone planar laser induced neon, and the radiation of the cavity enhanced diode laser, the carbonyl compounds are detected. To prove the matter that breath is more effective than that of blood, blood sugar in milligrams per deciliter are simultaneously taken with intensity of breath absorption after glucose ingestion measurements are taken and reflected into the initial breath of the subject compared at parts per billion. The absorbed reflections of each breath and blood measurement correlative with increased ingestion are tested proving that the optical device is mathematically proportional to the engineered optical device.

PROSPECTIVE THERMOELECTRIC TELLURIDES

Nowadays, we observe a boom in alternative power resources and according to Hubbert’s theory production of oil is near to its peak and devices based on thermoelectric effects begin to be requested and used. Formerly, it was not the case for their high price and poor efficiency. Research on thermoelectric (TE) materials can enhance the efficiency and thus increase the applicability. This project is focused on thermoelectric effects, research of the prospective crystalline materials which are usable for thermoelectric applications, preparation and practical construction of Peltier element, used as a thermoelectric cooler or generator.<br><br>Synthesized materials based on telluride compounds (focused on "novel ternary telluride" comparing with Bi2Te3), were identified by XRD. After hot-pressing the samples were characterized by the measurement of Seebeck coefficient, Hall coefficient and electrical and thermal conductivity with the aim to calculate so-called figure of merit ZT. This coefficient parameterizes the efficiency of thermoelectric devices.<br><br>The results of measurements of undoped "novel ternary telluride" show high level of Seebeck coefficient but rather low electrical conductivity. Thus the aim was to increase the conductivity and eventually develop TE material with higher efficiency then the state-of-art materials. In following steps the original "home-made" Peltier element is going to be constructed from these materials and the conversion efficiency of this element is going to be measured.<br><br>This project has its significance in exploration of new TE materials, which prospectively can replace nowadays used materials based on tetradymite structure.

CATALYTIC OXIDATION OF 2-BUTANOL UTILIZING SIZE-SELECTED PLATINUM NANOPARTICLES
Elaine Zhou
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, FL

2-Butanol, an industrial solvent and product of fermentation, is currently disposed of through incineration, an inefficient process contributing to an increase in CO2 in the atmosphere. Catalytic oxidation proposes a more efficient alternative, and is a reaction that simulates that in fuel cells. Two factors were studied – catalytic activity and effect of particle size and morphology on activity. Polymers dissolved in toluene produced inverse micelles that were loaded with platinum metal salt. Various sizes and shapes were created by varying the polymer and metal loading. This solution was deposited on nanocrystalline support (g-Al2O3) and annealed at 375C, forming a powder catalyst eliminated of the carbon from the polymer and chlorine from the salt. In a packed-bed mass flow reactor, the reactant gas reached the catalyst in a furnace, as a mass spectrometer recorded output gases. In all samples, maximum conversion (100%) was reached ~180°C, more easily than without catalysis. Butanone, CO2, and water were the major products, indicating both partial and complete oxidation. Size and shape seemed to play a combined role in catalysis. Most scientific literature shows that an increase in surface atoms increases catalytic activity. Rather, an overall trend with an increase in Nc/Nt correlated with an increase in onset temperature was observed. A greater number of platinum atoms in contact with the support g-Al2O3 seems to degrade catalytic efficiency. Since catalysis makes up 90% of all chemical synthesis processes and nearly 20% of our GNP relies on catalysis, it is vital to develop a deeper understanding of these nanoparticles.

WAYS OF MAKING FERRITE CLUSTERS WITH FRACTAL STRUCTURE AND THEIR APPLICATIONS
Nadzeya D. Shaikouskaya
Gymnasium #22, Minsk, Belarus

In my work I suggest to use new compositional materials instead of inductance coils. Such materials have high Q-factor (low resistance) and unit size is about 500*500 micrometers. They consist of three parts: metal species which conduct electric current, matrix which connects components and branched out magnetically soft component which plays the role of a coil core and has fractal structure.<br><br>Main purpose of my research is to make a fractal structure and to use it as a core for micro coil. I investigated if it is possible to create fractals with the help of different kinds of magnetic fields (homogeneous and inhomogeneous, permanent and alternative) created by permanent magnets, magnetized needles and electromagnets. Magnetic fields force the ferrite species attract to each other and merge into clusters. Having done the calculations of the cluster’s dimensionality I was able to define whether cluster is fractal or not. Dimensionality was calculated by the analysis of cluster photograph which was converted into a black and white image.<br><br>In this way I managed to produce several clusters with fractal structure, which have fractional dimensionality wedged between 1 and 2. Making series of experiments I found an optimal ways of creation of clusters with fractal structure. The best result is obtained while using inhomogeneous alternative magnetic field.<br><br>

DESIGNING AND CREATING A MODULAR CONCUSSION DETECTION AND ALERT SYSTEM
Ashton Rhys Wackym
University School of Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI

Background: High linear acceleration values produce traumatic brain injury (TBI); however, lower rotational acceleration values will also cause TBI. No real time, mesh-compatible, modular concussion detection system (MCDS) exists.<br><br>Hypothesis: A modular concussion detection system can be used to detect and analyze both linear and rotational impacts and alert a trainer when the threshold for TBI is exceeded.<br><br>Methods: The MCDS collects x,y and z accelerations and calculates rotational acceleration in the x, y and z planes. Data continuously streams to the computer if the switch is in the “on” position or analyzes data until a threshold is exceeded, which initiates transmission. Once exceeded, a warning pops up, and a text message alert is sent to the trainer and parent of the recipient of the traumatic impact. The system then returns to its original recording state.<br><br>Results: Both the hardware and software designs were successful. The prototype is larger than a production model but proves implementation. The hardware design succeeded in transmitting a wireless signal that is hardly hindered by the enclosure. The software was encapsulated and permits the execution of all software components through a single script. The readings were tested and verified by connecting MCDS to a force sensor attached to a suspended spring and setting that spring in simple harmonic motion. Force and acceleration were obtained independently and compared.<br><br>Conclusions: Concussion detection should be an integral part of sports and other potentially concussive activities. A more compact model of MCDS can be produced by prefabricating a circuit board with all the necessary components. MCDS aims to make activities safer via a direct, comprehensible, affordable and innovative means.

DESIGN OF AN OPTIMIZED DISTILLER FOR PRODUCTION OF ETHANOL FROM BANANA WASTE
Cristhian Andres Nunez-Vanegas
Centro Educativo Maria Inmaculada, Limon, COSTA RICA

Every year Costa Rica disposes 20% of the total banana production, equivalent to 420,000 tons. Fruits that are non-compliant with export standards in the Limón area in Costa Rica, where majority of banana agro-industries are located, are discarded outdoors. Associated effects include production of lixiviates, insect proliferation and foul odors. According to publications ethanol production could be one of the options to make the most of it. However, the efficiency of the process associated with distillation is a limitation for the applicability of this option. This research presents the design, construction and testing of a functional specialized prototype for the extraction of ethanol from fermented banana syrup, since there are very few industry-level distillers for this purpose. The results obtained showed a 30% reduction in energy usage versus the models described in previous research. Unlike industrial distillers for ethanol production from bananas, the prototype created in this study develops a continuous process, from the injection of the fermented syrup to the output of the residual syrup and ethanol extraction, without the need for any interruptions during the process, thus avoiding unnecessary energy loss. The distillation design includes a single distillation tower, unlike many industrial processes that work with segmented distillations. This allows for cost reduction during the construction of the prototype. The heat gradient is controlled with 3 thermometers selectively located on strategic points of the flow, It is equipped with two heat exchangers intended to condense the distilled ethanol and heat the fermented syrup injected to the distillation column, thus achieving the reutilization and recovery of energy.

ISOTROPIC VERSUS ANISOTROPIC VIOLIN SOUND POST MATERIALS: AFFECT ON VIOLIN RESONANCE USING YOUNG'S MODULUS
Samantha Carly Skaller
Brewster High School, Brewster, NY

Playing a stringed instrument sparks the interest of how the sound is made, and what can make it better. The small manipulation of sound post placement transforms the sound, but what happens if the material of the sound post is completely changed? With the help of experienced mentors in the fields of violin making and audio-recording the experiment was made possible. Categorizing each sound post as either isotropic or anisotropic, the materials I chose to use include: Spruce wood, maple wood, carbon fiber, nickel, titanium, PVC, nylon, and polyurethane. After inserting a new sound post consistently inside the violin, I bowed each string of the violin with a consistent pressure and speed inside a professional sound studio. Using a spectrum analyzer, the visual pictures of the sound waves showed the frequencies of the harmonics each string produced with each sound post. An ideal yet implausible sound wave would have consistent peaks of the same height. After gaining the data, I graphed the findings and interpreted them. There were no trends between the behavior of the sound post materials and Young’s modulus. The differences between the behavior of isotropic material and anisotropic material were minimal thus drawing conclusions from a musical perspective. Musically, one sound post could produce a bright sounding upper register (maple wood) or a deeper sound (PVC.)

EFFY: THE CELL PHONE FOR CHILDREN
Charlota Blunarova
Gymnazium, Vyskov, Vyskov, CZECH REPUBLIC

I helped to find a perfect cell phone for my 8 years old cousin. It turned out to be very hard to find a cell phone perfectly satisfying child and parent needs. Therefore I decided to develop novel cell phone EFFY aimed at the age between 5 and 9 years which well fits the children psychology. The designed cell phone has innovative circular shape, which allows comfortable manipulation with both hands.<br><br> <br><br>I have designed the complete 3D model in CAD application and printed the master model by the rapid prototyping method. Then I casted all parts from silicon by the vacuum method. Based on my request, the company manufacturing cell phones provided EFFY with the electronic unit, which allows basic functions. The EFFY phone in its present form was successfully tested and its benefits demonstrated in co-operation with various children and their parents.<br><br> <br><br>The contributions of this project are twofold. First, the design study of the novel cell phone was realized to cover the children's aesthetic and ergonomic requirements as well as to help the whole family, especially of cautious parents. The phone can also be managed by pre-school children, who cannot read yet. Thanks to two pre-set phone numbers intended for calling parents, it makes this cell phone an ideal choice as the very first phone for children. Secondly, the functional prototype of the cell phone was built. It demonstrated playful EFFY appearance, unconventional shape, easy manipulation and functions.

INVESTIGATION OF NEW MATERIAL FOR NON-VOLATILE MEMORIES
Sona Bohacova
Gymnazium Pardubice, Dasicka 1083, Pardubice, CZECH REPUBLIC

Modern technologies are connected with rising need to store data. Therefore new materials which meet demands for better properties are subject of research. The aim of my work was to investigate properties of the Sb80Se20 thin films to determine possibility of its use in optical and electrical memories. <br><br>The thin film was deposited on glass substrate by flash evaporation method. The temperature-dependent sheet resistance measurement (van der Pauw technique) was carried out to investigate the suitability of the material for electrical memories. Optical reflectivity was measured to detect optical contrast between optical reflectivity of amorphous and crystalline state. Results were compared to Ge2Sb2Te5 which was found the best so far. <br><br>The difference between sheet resistance of amorphous and crystalline state was bigger than in case of Ge2Sb2Te5. The phase transition temperature was 176.2 °C which is by 34 °C more than for Ge2Sb2Te5. The optical reflectivity measurement showed that optical contrast was bigger than that of Ge2Sb2Te5.<br><br>Big difference of sheet resistance of both states enables easy reading of the data. Moreover, higher transition temperature leads to bigger stability of the film. It indicates applicability of the new material for electrical memories. Results of optical reflectivity measurement lead to the conclusion that bigger optical contrast makes Sb80Se20 more convenient for optical memories than Ge2Sb2Te5. To summarize, my project has shown that the new material Sb80Se20 is promising for improvement to data storage both in electrical and optical memories.

HARNESSING WASTE KINETIC ENERGY THROUGH FOOTWEAR FOR THERAPEUTIC USE
Tara Sowrirajan
Cherry Creek High School, Greenwood Village, CO

Electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) is a form of electrotherapy that uses electrical impulse to elicit muscle contraction. It is used to relax muscle spasms, prevent and decrease disuse atrophy, re-educate muscles, and for rehabilitation purposes with muscle injury. The effectiveness of physical therapy depends on the frequency of application - the expense and inconvenience involved acts as deterrents and thus the complete benefits are never attained.<br><br> Walking requires quite a lot of energy, most of which is wasted while maneuvering ourselves from one foot to another. The potential of harnessing this waste energy has widespread benefits. The goal of this experimentation was to use piezoelectric materials placed on the bottom of the foot to directly power EMS to aid in muscle rehabilitation. When pressure is applied to piezoelectric materials, the resulting high voltage, low intensity electric pulses meet the standards required for EMS.<br><br> A spring loaded system that applies substantial force on the piezoelectric crystal in a grill lighter produces ~50 kV electric pulses. Two circuit designs were utilized to create multiple levels of intensity. The first used two transformers, and the second involved the use of diodes to drop the voltage to different levels. Accurate measurement of the magnitude of voltages at different settings was difficult due to technical limitations, but the proportionality between different intensities was confirmed qualitatively and with an oscilloscope. The device timed the EMS pulses with the walking cycle so as to maximize muscle strengthening and rehabilitation in an efficient, pragmatic, and green method.

ALUMINA NANOPARTICLE MEDIATED PATHWAYS IN CANCER CELLS
Amber Tang
Lakeridge High School, Lake Oswego, OR

Alumina nanoparticles in cancer cells are shown to induce autophagy, which may be regulated to promote cell survival or trigger apoptosis. The confocal analysis indicates that a majority of alumina nanoparticles colocalized with LC3, an autophagic marker in HeLa cells, but not lysosomal trackers. The formation of autophagy at an early stage was also successfully blocked using a PI3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin. This treatment did not affect phagocytosis of alumina nanopartices by HeLa cells. To keep alumina nanoparticles and their carried payload in autophagosomes, a lysosomal inhibitor of ammonium chloride was used to block the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes. As a result, the amount of autophagosomes increased in HeLa cells. Further study was performed to evaluate the link between TLR4 receptor signaling and autophagy induced by nanoparticles in Hela cells. The results show that TLR4 recognizes nanoparticles and triggers autophagy in cancer cells. The demonstrated alumina nanoparticle-mediated autophagy provides an alternative pathway to deliver cancer therapy drugs into tumor cells.

MULTI-PURPOSE DEVICE DESIGNED FOR PHYSICAL EFFECTS ANALYSIS
Martin Olejar
Communication Engineering High School, Prague, Czech Republic

Engineers, technicians and teachers need to analyze and measure a number of physical phenomena and their effects. Often the instruments they use are designed to perform one special function and require a computer support. To alleviate this situation I have developed a standalone device that is capable of performing many measurement functions for research and education purposes.<br><br>Specifically, my task was to design a PC independent device that is capable of providing multimode measurements. The core of the system consists of a band-pass filter tunable to various exponential sequences of frequencies. The operations of the system oscillators, generators, spectrum analyzers, and analyzers of complex impedances are based on this tunable filter.<br><br>The system is capable of measuring frequency and voltage using built-in oscilloscope and spectrum analyzer. This system is also capable of generating signals of required frequencies.<br><br>All measured data can be saved in the system memory and visualized using an interactive LCD. The proposed system can be expanded using external modules and a built-in serial interface.<br><br>This system was designed to be integrated into engineering curricula at high school and junior college levels. Its role is to improve the process of education. <br><br>

THE VEHICLE EXTREME TEMPERATURE ALARM SYSTEM WITH CELLULAR DISPATCH FOR UNATTENDED CHILDREN
Laura Catherine Delaney
Lemon Bay High School, Englewood, FL

My project, The Vehicle Extreme Temperature Alarm System with Cellular Dispatch for Unattended Children, was developed to reduce the number of deaths of unattended children in cars with extreme temperatures. This device is a unique, stand-alone device that can be used to save lives. This project was broken down into the Designing, Manufacturing, and Testing Phases.<br><br>The Designing Procedure encompassed preliminary brain-storming all the way up to the mechanical assembly. The best stand-alone device was laid out, and the design and manufacture followed. Once the device was complete, it was ready for testing. The testing procedure involved testing each of the component’s reliability and testing the entire system for reliability. <br><br>The tests performed show that when proper logic is applied, a usable, life-saving device can be created. This created device was able to alert a parent via cell phone 85% of the time when there was an unattended child in a dangerous situation. This device was able to detect an empty car 100% of the time when temperatures were extreme. Besides being used as a device to help save unattended children from injury or death from hyperthermia or hypothermia, this device can also be used to save children in school buses or senior citizens left in vehicles. No one wants to see anyone suffer by being trapped in an extremely hot or cold vehicle.

LUNARCRETE
Sergio Alexander Parra
Mill Creek High School, Hoschton, GA

This experiment was designed to reflect how the physical and chemical differences between lunar concrete and standard terrestrial concrete would affect the compressive strengths of the concrete and how those results may affect the feasibility of future construction on the Moon. <br><br> Triplicates of four concrete mixes were made so as to have all possible combinations between “terrestrial” and “lunar” concrete. Idealized mass ratios of aggregate to cement to water were also used to make the samples. After 13 days, wherein the samples cured and dried, the samples were tested for compressive strength via a compression testing machine, where compressive strengths were recorded and the experiment was concluded.<br><br> The “lunar” concrete mix, a blend of JSC-1 Lunar Soil Simulant, Calcium Aluminate cement, and distilled water, outperformed the “terrestrial” concrete, a blend of graded sand, Portland cement, and distilled water, in terms of compressive strengths. <br><br> In terms of both aggregate and cement performance, graded sand performed much better bonding with Calcium Aluminate cement than did the JSC-1 Lunar Soil Simulant, but the JSC-1 Lunar Soil Simulant performed much better than the graded sand in terms of bonding with the Portland cement. <br><br> Such conclusions may be used to further support the goals to revisit the Moon in the near future. The use of lunar resources on the Moon itself lowers many costs associated with returning, and the fact that concrete produced there can support more weight than standard commercial concrete allows for less concrete to be produced and still yield the expected results.

INFLATABLE STRUCTURES FOR EARTH AND SPACE APPLICATIONS
Jodie Leigh Tinker
Covenant Christian Academy, Huntsville, AL

Inflatable structures are tension structures that need internal pressure in order to have stiffness and strength. Inflatables can be hardened or rigidized for additional strength following inflation, and they have many potential space and earth-based applications. Advantages of inflatable structures that make them desirable include their low weight, small packaging volume, and low cost. However, there are several challenges involved in the use of inflatable structures, including (1) design and manufacturing, (2) packaging, (3) controlled deployment, and (4) rigidization for long term survival and use. <br><br>The purpose of this project was to address the challenges above by designing, building, and testing thin film inflatable structures. Methods were developed for fabricating inflatable tubes, using spray and pour foam to harden the structures, performing stiffness and strength tests, and achieving controlled inflation in air and vacuum conditions. Data from load-deflection testing of foam-rigidized tubes showed that stiffness increased for higher foam density, increased film thickness, and shorter tubes. Load-deflection testing of air-inflated tubes showed that stiffness increased for higher pressure, increased film thickness, and shorter tubes.Deployment testing of air-inflated tubes in atmospheric conditions showed pressure buildup prior to unfolding or unrolling, and pressure relief after these events. In addition, air flow rate controlled the deployment rate. Both frictional deployment control and velcro devices were successful for providing slow and stable deployment in atmospheric and vacuum conditions.<br><br>This project successfully addressed several challenges involved in the use of inflatable structures, and these results could further advance inflatables technology.

THE EFFECT OF PLURONIC AND HYPERTHERMIA ON CANCER CELL PERMEABILITY
Jennifer Dara Huang
Hathaway Brown School, Shaker Heights, OH

Radiofrequency ablation is a clinical treatment for tumors unsuitable for surgical removal. During ablation, a needle electrode is inserted into a tumor under imaging guidance and the tumor is heated to 90ºC. While tumor cells located near the electrode receive a lethal heat dose, distant cells may receive sub-lethal heat and remain viable. Sensitizers increase cell susceptibility to hyperthermia and can be used to increase ablation effectiveness. This study investigates the effect of a thermosensitizing surfactant called Pluronic on cancer cell permeability, suspected to be one mechanism behind its sensitizing activity. Four Pluronics (L10, L61, L64, P85) with different structural properties were examined.<br><br>Membrane permeability was assayed by measuring uptake of 10kDa fluorescent dextran (FD) in rat colorectal cancer cells. Cells were pre-exposed to Pluronic for 0, 20, and 40min at 37°C followed by an additional 20min of incubation at 37°C or 43°C. The effect of heat alone, Pluronic alone, and Pluronic at 43°C was studied.<br><br>Compared to no treatment, heat controls yielded a maximum FD increase of 285% (t=40min). L10, L64, and P85 alone decreased FD uptake. L61 alone increased absorption but yielded less than heat controls. When exposed to 43°C, L64 and P85 produced an increase of 416% and 282% (t=40min). L10 yielded a 266% increase (t=60min), but L61 was less effective than heat controls at all times. <br><br>The unique activity of each Pluronic may be attributed to differences in molecular weight, or poly-ethylene-oxide/poly-propylene-oxide ratios. Amplified cellular permeability by Pluronic may improve the effectiveness of tumor ablation therapy.

SENSITIVITY OF POLYANILINE/TITANIUM DIOXIDE GAS SENSORS TO AMMONIA
Dev Raj Nair
Pulaski Academy, Little Rock, AR

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the most sensitive polyaniline/TiO2 ammonia gas sensor. Incorporation of nanomaterials into sensors helps to increase the surface area and therefore the chemical sensitivity of these sensors is an important contributor to the advancement of gas sensing. Ammonia sensors are used in different applications such as clinical diagnosis, industrial process, food technology, fertilizers, farms and environmental pollution. Three types of polyaniline sensors were constructed in the experiment. One sensor only used pure polyaniline, the second sensor was made of polyaniline loaded with 30% titanium metal oxide, and the third sensor was made of polyaniline loaded with 60% titanium metal oxide. The resistivity values for each sensor were measured without exposure to ammonia gas. Then, the changes in resistivity of the sensor were measured when exposed to the ammonia gas with respect to time. The ammonia gas concentration of all trials was controlled to be 60 ppms of ammonia. The influence of the metal oxide incorporation into polyaniline was tested for ammonia gas sensitivity. The hypothesis of the experiment was: as the titanium oxide concentration in the nanocomposite increases, the resistivity should also increase. In the experiment, it was demonstrated that the 60% metal oxide- polyaniline film was the most sensitive, the pure polyaniline film was moderately sensitive and the 30% metal oxide- polyaniline film was the least sensitive.

HARD-TEMPLATING SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF MESOPOROUS AND ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTIVE CARBON NANOFIBERS
Jianyang David Yin
Raffles Junior College, Singapore, SINGAPORE

This study aims to synthesize mesoporous and electrically-conductive carbon nanofibers, which would be very useful for fuel cells and sensing applications. A two-step synthetic route was applied to achieve this goal. In the first step, amphiphilic surfactant molecules were used as the structure-directing agent (also referred to as the 'soft-template') to fabricate silica materials with highly ordered mesoporous structures. Notably, a new static synthesis protocol was developed to well control the particle morphology of the mesoporous silica, and two types of nanofibers with different mesostructures (SBA-15 and SBA-6) were successfully prepared. In the second step, the pre-synthesized mesoporous silica nanofibers were employed as the 'hard-template' to prepare mesoporous carbon nanofibers. Briefly, furfuryl alcohol, the carbon source, was introduced into the pores of the silica template, where it was polymerized in situ and then carbonized to produce an intermediate silica/carbon nanocomposite. Silica was finally removed from the composite by dissolution in NaOH solution, yielding pure carbon materials. Both the silica and carbon materials were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), N2 sorption characterization and X-ray Diffraction (XRD). Interestingly, the obtained carbon materials successfully replicated not only the mesostructure but also the fibrous morphology of the mesoporous silica template and exhibited many desirable properties. The resultant mesoporous carbon nanofibers were as long as 10-20 um with diameters of 50-300 nm, and possessed large surface area (~ 1100 m2/g) and high electrical conductivity (~ 65 S/cm). These mesoporous carbon nanofibers are currently being developed for sensing application.

OIL POLYMER SORBENT WITH MAGNETIC PROPERTIES
Mahira Mayis Safaralizade
''Young Talents'' Lyceum of Baku State University, Baku, AZERBAIJAN

Modern technological processes concerning the oil refining, transportation and reservation of oil products are the main reasons of global pollution of water surface. From this point of view, the elaboration of cheap technological methods of water cleaning is necessary. The aim of this project is to provide a material with magnetic properties for thin oil films removal from water surface. <br><br>The material has been obtained on the basis of a porous cross-linked structure polymer that was synthesized on the basis of industrial polymer by chemical treatment in Baku State University. The magnetic properties in this polymer were created by chemical coprecipitation of a water solution of FeCI2/FeCI3 iron salts. In laboratorial experiments the medium-viscosity oil from Ramani oilfield (Apsheron) was used. <br><br>The dependence of sorption capacity from sorbents amount, sorption time and also from application cycle has been researched. It has been confirmed that the amount of absorbed oil has been increased by increasing the amount of sorbent and maximum oil sorption can be observed at the beginning of the process (during the first hour). The obtained data allow to conclude that sorbent can be successfully regenerated and repeatedly used. <br><br>The study shows that the obtained composite with magnetic properties has a high sorption capacity towards oil and oil products, can be effectively used for thin oil films removal from water surface. Moreover, the obtained composite can be also offered for water purification from different pollutants.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF ECO-FRIENDLY LANDSCAPING PAVERS USING INCINERATOR ASH
Leandra Marie Craigmile
Lincoln High School, Thief River Falls, MN

The purpose of this project was to determine if adding incinerated ash to a concrete composition would alter the compression strength endpoints on landscaping pavers, using different amounts of concrete and ash in each set of bricks. The experimental hypothesis states, if landscaping pavers are made of a traditional concrete composition, and a series of concrete and incinerated ash compositions, then the compression strength endpoint between the 5:1 ratio composition and the traditional concrete composition will not be statistically significant. Fifteen bricks were made of each composition, traditional concrete, and an incinerator ash and concrete composition at a 1:1 ratio, a 3:1 ratio, a 4:1 ratio, and a 5:1 ratio. The bricks were broken and the compression strength endpoints were recorded. The hypothesis was accepted because the results showed that the traditional concrete composition had a mean average of 660 psi; while the ash and concrete at the 5:1 ratio had and average of 612 psi. This experiment indicated that using environmentally friendly products that would otherwise be put into a landfill will not effect the overall strength so much that the bricks are not substantial. If used for the purposes of landscaping or sidewalks the concrete and ash bricks would be strong and substantial.

SUBSTRATE MODIFICATION OF HEXAGONAL BORON NITRIDE MONOLAYERS AND ANALYSIS WITH TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY
Andrew Samuel Ylitalo
Stillwater Area High School, Stillwater, MN

The recent isolation of monolayers of Hexagonal Boron Nitride (h-BN)—a graphitic material—has opened it to nanoscale applications; however, h-BN’s inertness has limited its potential for chemical alteration. This study sought to overcome that limit and expand h-BN’s applications.<br><br>Given h-BN’s semiconductor nature, the deposition of metal vapors was investigated on the surface and edges of h-BN monolayers for potential nanoscale electronics applications. Edge atoms were presumed to attract metal deposits due to their reactive dangling bonds, so edges were created in the lattice by drilling holes with the electron beam of a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). H-BN samples were then immersed in a metal vapor. Analysis with Scanning TEM and Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy revealed Molybdenum and Aluminum nanoparticles adsorbed to the h-BN surface, but the TEM’s lack of aberration-correction limited resolution and analysis of deposition along edges.<br><br>The adsorption of these metals to h-BN demonstrated the potential to chemically alter h-BN’s surface and, with metals, potentially alter electronic properties for nanoscale electronics applications. Although holes could not be shown to attract metal deposits, they could be used in physical filtration of large molecules. Physical filters require uniform hole sizes, so hole-growth under electron-beam irradiation was modeled using differential equations to guide precise hole-drilling. The lack of adsorption to hole edges observed suggests that smaller molecules would not be adsorbed while passing through, so the pressure drop would remain low. With further research, h-BN could be used to make such selective monolayer filters for military and industrial applications.

MONITORING AXONAL GROWTH THROUGH LYMNAEA STAGNALIS IN THE PRESENCE OF AN ELECTROSTATIC FIELD
Marissa Leeann Gorena
Weslaco East High School, Weslaco, TX

This project was conceived in order to find out if the presence of an electrostatic field would have an impact on the direction in which an axon grows. The experiment was conducted as follows, an adult snail was dissected and the ganglia were placed in a Poly-L-lysine coated petri dish then went through a culture process. A camera was placed on top of the cultured neurons were which were placed on top of a plastic rod beside the Van De Graaff generator, and monitored for three hours every thirty minutes. The data was collected through pictures taken at the intervals and later were observed more closely, and measured through a high powered microscope. The hypothesis stated that, if cultured neurons are exposed to an electrostatic field their axons should grow towards a positive charge, thus producing a possible step forward in the recreation of neurological pathways to the brain involving a prosthetic in humans. The conclusion to the experiment was created through the results, thus validating the hypothesis.

RARE EARTH BASED MULTICOLOR EMITTING NANOMATERIALS: SYNTHESIS AND POTENTIAL ANTI-COUNTERFEITING APPLICATIONS
Yue Yin
The Experimental High School Attached to Beijing Normal University, Beijing, CHINA

Ultra luminescence ink has been largely used as an anti-counterfeiting technique in the designs of paper money of RMB. However, this has not effectively prevented counterfeit currency in China. As far as I am concerned, the current ultra luminescence ink is based on down-conversion principle and restricts the colour control, which exposes paper money to counterfeit. Thus I began the study on the improvement in anti-counterfeiting materials. Firstly, by way of adding different concentrations of Tm3 + ion activator to NaYF4 matrix sensitized by Yb3 + ions, I compared two methods of synthesizing up-conversion materials by rare-earth doped: co-precipitation method and Metallic organic complex high temperature heat decomposition method. Then I researched the appearance, dimension, phase, purity and ultra luminescence feature of products invented by those two methods. In order to optimize the two methods, I changed activator such as adding Er3 +, Tm3 + or Ho3+ and fine-tuned reaction conditions. In this way, the shape and size, luminous color and intensity and other properties of the up-conversion nano-materials by rare earth doped could be regulated. Based on the above experiments, using high temperature heat decomposition method, we succeeded innovatively in the compound of synthesis of both the up-conversion and down-conversion properties of nano-particles through a simple method. Such nano-particles can generate fluorescence emission excited by ultraviolet or infrared, thus has potential anti-counterfeiting applications. I have also proved this through a sample experiment.

SUPERHYDROPHOBICITY IN PLANTS OF PUERTO RICO
Maria Cristina Sepulveda
Southwestern Educational Soceity, Mayaguez, PUERTO RICO

The field of biomimetics has been inspired by nature to artificially reproduce biomimic polymer films to be able to develop new useful materials. The rose petal is known to have a unique surface structure which causes a drop of water on its surface to be spherical in shape and not roll off even when the petal is turned upside down. There are nanostructures that provide the necessary roughness for superhydrophobicity and high adhesive force with water. The purpose of this investigation was to find other plants that exhibit the petal effect and duplicate their structures with a silicone polymer. <br><br>Many plants were tested for the petal effect. Of these, six were chosen to conduct the study. Their structures were studied using images from a scanning electron microscope looking for similar microstructures as the rose petal. A duplicated sample of their surface structure was obtained by producing a silicon polymer imprint. A duplicated imprint was tested for the petal effect and the structures were studied with images from a SEM.<br><br>Results indicated that other plants exhibited similar behavior and structures as the rose petal. Their structures were able to be duplicated successfully since the petal effect was present on the duplicated samples. In addition, water was able to be used to adhere two surfaces together. The observation of the petal effect could serve as an inspiration to develop simple methods for fabricating biomimic polymers with superhydrophobicity and adhesive properties. Nature provides the blueprints for innovation in nanotechnology.

INVESTIGATION ON WETTABILITY AND MICROSTRUCTURE OF MOSQUITO'S BODY SURFACE & MIMICKING RESEARCH
Yuxing Yao
The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China, Beijing, CHINA

This paper aims at revealing the relationship between surface microstructures and biological adapted wettability on mosquito, in order to realize the mimicking research on functional interfaces. In experiments, the water-repellency on mosquito’s eyes, wings and legs in a fogging environment is observed by optical microscopy, and measured by contact angle meter. It is observed by scanning electron microscopy that different parts of mosquito’s body, such as water-repellent eyes, wings and legs, are composed of different topological microstructures. This paper demonstrates an important dependent relationship between the micro-nanostructures and biological adapted wettability. Based on this relationship, a artificial surface has been successfully fabricated by mimicking the micro-nanostructures of mosquito’s eyes. This artificial surface realizes the excellent water-repellency or self-cleaning. This result is significant to the practical application.

ANTI-FOLDING BIONIC UMBRELLA
Xiuming Yu
Senior High School Affiliated to Jiangsu Educational Institute, Nanjing city, Jiangsu province, CHINA

The umbrella is one of daily necessities in our daily life. In order to prevent the rain and sunshine, the current umbrella structure and the clinkerbrick texture of umbrella cover makes it very difficult to keep balance in windy days, and sometimes turnover when facing heavy wind. Inspired by the shape of the aquarium golden arowana, this problem can be effectively solved through opening some holes in the umbrella cover.<br><br>The umbrella cover is designed into upper and lower layers. The upper scaly layer can effectively block the rain and sunshine, and the lower umbrella cloth is evenly covered with small round holes, which can enable the wind to go through the umbrella. On this basis, with repeated experiments, the symmetrically designed vent wind area is added, reducing the differential pressure on the both sides of umbrella cover, and making the umbrella easier to handle in windy days. After repeated testing and modification, the final submitted design can effectively prevent the umbrella turnover in case of heavy wind. The large umbrella or awning made of this umbrella cloth in the outdoor competitions and exhibitions can be very safe; and raincoats using this material can improve human comfort. The product based on this design has great promotional value.

BIOCOMPATIBLE ZIRCONIA NANOPOWDERS: THE SCALABLE SYNTHESIS OF AN ADVANCED MATERIAL FOR DENTAL APPLICATION
Yi Yang
Beijing Huiwen Middle School, Beijing, Beijing, CHINA

Stabilized zirconia, one of the most important ceramics with unique mechanical, processible and biocompatible performance, has been used as a dental material since 1990s. However, because of its exclusive nature, it is relatively difficult both to control the particle size exactly during recent industrial procedure and to machine the shape in dental application. Therefore, a new, homogeneous and scalable process is needed to meet the requirements of the expanding dental restoration market.<br><br>In this study, yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) was fabricated via a two-step hydrothermal reaction. With concentration of metallic ions less than 0.2mol/L, the mixed solution of yttrium nitrate, zirconium oxynitrate and urea was treated under 80°C for 8 hours and another 180°C for 16 hours. After that, the monodisperse and tetragonal-phased YSZ nanopowders with ca. 8nm of diameter was then fabricated. The preparation process can be scaled into 1L .<br><br>Next step, a thin silica layer of ca. 5nm was coated onto the as-prepared nanopowders according to Stöber method, which may improve the aesthetic appearance of the nanopowders. Such process can also be scaled up to 1L .<br><br>Finally, the as-prepared nanopowders were molded using isostatically pressing, combined with a high temperature sintering. This work provides a low cost and environmental-friendly method to fabricate monodisperse and tetragonal YSZ nanopowders, which are satisfying for dental application. By optimizing the condition parameters, this procedure is easy to be scaled up for industrial production.

TOWARDS MORE EFFICIENT VERY-LARGE-SCALE INTEGRATED NETWORKS: INCREASING THE DEGREE OF PARALLELISM AND SEMICONDUCTANCE IN SINGLE-WALLED CARBON NANOTUBE DEVICES
Yosyp Shvab
T. C. Williams High School, Alexandria, VA

The potential beneficial uses of Single-Walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have been well known and researched for nearly a decade. Creating Field-Effect Transistor (FET) devices that employ SWNTs has been a widely researched – and largely successful – goal. Recently, devices utilizing a single nanotube as the semiconducting agent have been known to reach a Terahertz switching frequency. However, two main challenges are known when constructing SWNT FETs. First, when growing nanotubes, it is very difficult to control the alignment of the fullerenes. For the desired devices, a high degree of parallelism is vital. Second, standard nanotube growth yields only ~33% semiconducting tubes, the rest being completely metallic (conducting), or in rare cases insulating. For a high speed, functioning device, a very large proportion of semiconducting tubes is desired. Both of these challenges have been researched independently, and some solutions have been proposed. However, in order to achieve near-mass production with minimized error, a sustainable and repeatable solution is needed. The following research proposes a unique combination of two recent, independent and groundbreaking ideas; one focuses on parallelism and the other on semi- conductance. With a newly devised recipe and procedure for the growth and treatment of nanotubes post-growth, a significant qualitative and quantitative improvement can be observed in both the density of aligned nanotubes per micrometer, and their respective semiconductance. Growth is done in vacuum on a quartz substrate as opposed to the more conventional silicon-oxide for improved electrical effects. Devices were lithographically etched directly onto the substrate.

CREATING AN INEXPENSIVE HOMEMADE LAPAROSCOPIC SIMULATOR
Megan Virginia Waples
University School of Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI

Simulation tools are becoming increasingly prevalent and vital in the medical field. Employed in the education of medical residents, simulators improve clinical hand-eye coordination and familiarization with surgical instruments. Practicing physicians also use simulators to maintain and perfect their skills. Despite their increasing use, simulators remain expensive and are not affordable for developing countries. Physicians in developing countries would benefit from having access to an effective and inexpensive simulator, as it would improve physician training and positively impact patient care. <br><br>My research last year involved studying the correlation of video game performance and simulator ability. Inspired by this work, I designed and created a less costly alternative to the laparoscopic simulation box. I then developed a test utilizing the homemade simulator and the professional simulator for four population groups: students, adults, nurses, and surgeons. Each test subject performed an identical exercise on each simulator and completed a brief survey regarding their opinions of the two simulators. Test subjects were asked for suggestions on improving the homemade simulator. After evaluating quantitative, observational, and survey data, I modified the original prototype to improve functionality.<br><br>The qualitative and quantitative results statistically demonstrated that the homemade simulator was as effective as a training tool as the professional simulator. As the homemade simulator is over tenfold more affordable than the professional simulator, it could be very beneficial to the medical field, especially in developing countries.

ANALYSIS OF PARALLEL VERSUS RECIPROCAL HANDLE ORIENTATION ON A HANDCYCLE
Wilson Jennings Brown
DeRidder High School, DeRidder, LA

The purpose of this project is to find out which style of handles, parallel or reciprocal, is the fastest for hand cycle use. The hand cycle tested is designed for paraplegics to ride.<br><br> <br><br>The hypothesis is reciprocal handles of a hand cycle will be faster than parallel handles in on-road and off-road tests. <br><br> <br><br>The test consisted of a subject riding on one of the 3 set tracks, which included the 50 meter long off-road course, 160 meter on-road, and the 20 meter on-road, as fast as they could in which they were timed. Then the subject would do the same course, but alternating the style of the handles. Whether the subject tested the parallel or the reciprocal first, in almost every case, they were faster with the parallel.<br><br> <br><br>The results of the test show that mean of the times were faster with parallel handles (1.1 seconds faster in the 20 meter on-road course, 1.85 seconds faster in the off-road 50 meter, and 5.28 seconds faster in the 160 meter on-road). The reciprocal handles, however, were preferred by the subjects when they were cruising at a leisurely pace.<br><br> <br><br>In conclusion the hypothesis was disproved in that the parallel handles were faster. Sources for this were found on the internet, interviews, and several books.

Purpose:<br><br>The purpose of this project is to determine which ratio of cement to sand makes the strongest concrete. <br><br>Hypothesis:<br><br>The predicted outcome was that the strongest concrete block would be the one of highest cement percentage, with 80% cement/ 20% sand.<br><br>Procedure/Materials:<br><br>Fifteen concrete bricks were made in wood frames, composed of sand and Portland cement in the following ratios (out of 2000ml): 20% sand/ 80% cement, 30% sand/ 70% cement, 40% sand/ 60% cement, 50% sand/ 50% cement, 60% sand/ 40% cement. Each brick, placed between two sturdy workbenches, had weight added to it in a bucket hung from it until the brick failed.<br><br>For the second test, the plastic cylindrical molds used to make the bricks were 10.16cm x 20.32cm. After 7 days, the bricks were compressed in a hydraulic press until failure.

Most of the underpasses in the city are constructed using the symmetric structure.In normal condition,there is no ventilation in the middle of such kind of underpass.(but actually there is very little wind).Thus when passers-by come into the underpass,they'd get a feeling of wet and cold as well as frequently smell something unpleasant,which is not only bad for the maintenance of instruments but also for people's health.While this design can overcome all the weaknesses above.<br><br>Under the circumstances of the same current speed in the approach, the two sides' pressure are both the same and the lacking of wind in the transverse path.Such kind of design is based on the knowledge of hydrokinetics, the design puts forward the two types of underpasses: the leading type and the comprehensive type.<br><br>Theory of the leading type: the current from the right approach is blocked by V-shaped shielding board and thus altered to the left side, forming one-way current through.<br><br>Theory of the comprehensive type: the curtailment of space in the right approach and the blocking of V-shaped board make the current speed faster and the air pressure smaller, while the left current is altered to the right side because of the resistance in the straight direction, thus forming resultant of forces which promotes the current to flow to the right side.<br><br>Thanks to the ingenious use of natural wind, the design needn't consume any other resources which cannot be regenerated.It can also protect the environment and save the limited energy.

WATER-BASED RAPID PROTOTYPING AND TOOLING SYSTEM
Ka Yi DING
Shun Tak Fraternal Association Yung Yau College, Hong Kong, China

Water-Based Rapid Prototyping and Tooling System (RPT) is a new and environmental friendly solid freeform fabrication process. In the Water-Based Rapid Prototyping process, droplets of water are extruded from a micro-dispensing valve and deposited onto specific regions of an x-y table. Within a sub-zero forming envelope, the droplets are frozen rapidly on the previous layer and the part is built from the bottom in a layer-by-layer fashion. However, the melting of ice part under room condition limits the practicality of this system. The second part of this study was aimed to investigate the feasibility of using the ice parts for the casting process. To avoid the melting of the ice part, the tooling making process is performed under a sub-zero environment. The silicone and catalyst are first kept in a freezer to let it cool down. Afterwards, the silicone-catalyst mixture is poured around the ice pattern which has been already put inside a container in advance. After the silicone is cured, the cured silicone mold with ice part embedded is put under room condition to melt the ice part. Finally, molten (or uncured) material, such as 63Sn-37Pb solder alloy, wax, epoxy, polypropylene (PP), polyurethane (PU) or polystyrene (PS), is poured to fill the cavity of the mold and a component can be produced. The quality of the fabricated components has shown that RPT is a reliable rapid prototyping and tooling system.

OPTIMIZING NANOMETER-SCALE FEATURES
Kiwook Lee
Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, Aurora, IL

Electron beam lithography is a key technology to create precise nanometer structures as designed. Through e-beam lithography, electrons are focused into a resist layer to create the design. However, some electrons are scattered back to the resist causing changes in the original pattern. In order to create precise patterns, the pattern must account for the additional dose of the backscattered electrons. A silicon-on-insulator wafer was coated by negative resist, patterned by e-beam lithography, and developed by chemicals to keep only the exposed parts. The pattern consisted of a large annulus with a small pillar at the center. A pillar height, influenced by the radius of the annulus and the amount of electron dose, was measured by atomic force microscope. Pillar heights with the 350 µC/cm2 electron dose stayed to full height until 14.5 µm radius and dropped rapidly after it. Without proximity effect, the first pillar was formed at 893 µC/cm2 electron dose with a height of 125 nm and its height increased as the electron dose increased. The data points from these patterns were then inserted into a Gaussian equation to calculate the constant beta. This beta constant will be used to optimize features of 100 nm or larger.

BIOENGINEERING THE LUNG: DETERMINING IDEAL OXYGEN CONCENTRATIONS TO STIMULATE STEM-CELL GROWTH ON A TRANSPLANTABLE LUNG MATRIX
Jessica Ryvlin
Breck School, Golden Valley, MN

Breakthroughs in stem-cell technology open the possibility of seeding patient-specific human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) onto a decellularized lung matrix to bioengineer a lung for human transplant. This study proposes an optimal oxygen environment for hiPSC growth and suggests a novel mesenchymal induction technique that may be applied when bioengineering hiPSC-generated transplantable lungs. <br><br>Bioreactors were engineered to culture human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) on decellularized mouse lung matrices under three oxygen conditions: fetal oxygen (5% O2), normal oxygen (21% O2), and a switch from fetal to normal oxygen levels to mimic oxygen concentrations at birth (5-21% O2). Results suggest that hMSCs grow well in 21% oxygen, which is advantageous since a special 5% oxygen incubator will not be required to bioengineer lungs. Results also suggest that expensive commercially produced growth factors required by hiPSCs for differentiation into lung epithelial cells can be replaced with hMSCs, since growth factors required by hiPSCs were expressed by hMSCs. Furthermore, hMSCs may be preferable to commercially produced growth factors since hMSCs are less expensive than commercially produced growth factors, allow for targeted flow of growth factors, and produce a constant secretion of growth factors. Work to determine optimal oxygen conditions for mesenchymal induction has not been carried out prior to this study.

THE USE OF AN INERTIAL ELECTROSTATIC CONFINEMENT FUSION REACTOR IN MEDICAL TREATMENT AND IMAGING
William Wellborn Jack
Hudson High School, Hudson, OH

An IEC fusion reactor is a device which uses an electrostatic potential well in a high vacuum environment to ionize deuterium gas and accelerate the deuterium ions through a central point in a high vacuum chamber. Some of the high energy deuterium ions collide and carry out the following reaction: D+D -> He-3 + n. The neutrons emitted from the reactor can be used to initiate (n, y) reactions in target isotopes, producing new isotopes as the end product of the reaction. Therefore IEC reactors, in theory, could be used to produce medical radioisotopes in an inexpensive, safe, and portable manner. Two novel techniques of medical imaging that center around an IEC reactor were developed: Ag-108, which decays via positron emission 2.85% of the time, could be produced in an IEC fusion reactor and used in PET scans. Additionally, the neutron bombardment of Gd-157 in a patient’s body and subsequent gamma emission could replace traditional isotopes used in SPECT scans and lead to a greatly reduced radiation dose to the patient. This project revolved around the construction of an IEC fusion reactor optimized to test the viability of these proposals. The reactor was designed to be expandable, portable, and capable of demonstrating the production of isotopes. After review of data from neutron detection tubes, as well as from a liquid scintillation detection system, it was concluded that IEC fusion reactors are viable platforms for radioisotope production, and could be highly useful in the fields of medical imaging.

A NEW INNOVATION IN FOOD PRESERVATION

A food storage bag has been created that provides the consumer a convenient way to remove oxygen, inhibit mold growth, and keep food fresh longer. The bag relies on oxygen removal by means of oxidizing iron powder. The exterior of the bag is a film with low oxygen permeability. The bag’s unique seals allow the consumer to easily initially open the bag, in order to place food inside, but also allow the consumer to reseal the bag using a simple tape seal. A color changing oxygen sensor provides an easy way for the consumer to ensure the safety of food stored inside the bag. Comparisons have been made to other commercial products, and decreased mold growth has been observed in all cases. Additional experiments have shown the ability of consumers to effectively seal the bags and the ability of bags to maintain long shelf life prior to use. Applications where this oxygen removal bag could be of use include fresh produce, meats, cheeses, breads, and pastas. This product may also have implications when inhibiting aerobic bacteria growth.

THE EFFECT OF CARBOHYDRATE BASE ON A POLYMER WOUND/BURN APPLICANT WITH VARIOUS LEVELS OF POLYETHYLENEGLYCOL DIACRYLATE
Nicholas Joseph Neill
Saint Vincent-Saint Mary High School, Akron, OH

The goal of this project was to create a malleable, yet durable wound/burn applicant that had the ability to absorb large quantities of water and the ability to absorb and then release a therapeutic agent. The main methods included in this experiment were the attachment of a double bond methacrylate group, via Fischer esterification, the attachment of polyethyleneglycol diacrylate, through a simple polymerization, and finally lyophilization of the end product. The average water absorbency for the pectin samples with .3 mL of polyethyleneglycol diacrylate was 721.53%, while alginate samples with similar levels of polyethyleneglycol diacrylate had an average water absorbency of 615.00% . The pectin samples with .4 mL of polyethyleneglycol diacrylate had an average water absorbency of 499.53%, while alginate samples with similar levels of polyethyleneglycol diacrylate had an average water absorbency of 490.83% . The pectin samples with with .5 mL had a water absorbency of 253.00%, while alginate samples with similar levels of polyethyleneglycol diacrylate had a water absorbency of 334.03% water absorbency. Both pectin and alginate samples with .3 mL of polyethyleneglycol diacrylate could absorb and release median quantities of therapeutic agent. Both pectin and alginate samples with .4 mL of polyethyleneglycol diacrylate could release large quantities of therapeutic agents. All samples with .5 mL of polyethyleneglycol diacrylate could release minimal amounts of therapeutic agent, but these samples had the highest durability. It was found that alginate is the most suitable carbohydrate base for a carbohydrate based wound/burn applicant. The aforementioned data and statistics involving the pectin wound/burn applicants was obtained during the 2010-2011 school year. This data and statistics was used to compare the characteristics of the alginate wound/burn applicant.

NETWORKS OF ULTRASMALL PD/CR BILAYER NANOWIRES: A NEW TYPE OF HIGH PERFORMANCE HYDROGEN SENSOR
Henry Kai Deng
Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, Aurora, IL

Hydrogen sensors have become the subject of intensified studies in recent years due to their tremendous importance to hydrogen fuel applications. Increased experimentation on hydrogen sensors has demonstrated that palladium-based hydrogen sensors are very promising. Recent studies have shown that nano-palladium sensors are very quick and efficient; in particular, one research group came up with a new fabrication method that allowed for the creation of quick and highly cheap nanowire network sensors. In this study, palladium/chromium (Pd/Cr) nanowire network hydrogen sensors were created using the novel fabrication method and then tested at varying hydrogen concentrations. The fabrication method utilizes the design of commercially available filtration membranes to create a nanonetwork structure. By layering nanoscopic amounts of palladium and chromium onto the membrane, a nanowire network structure of palladium/chromium bilayer can be formed. The new sensors are able to take advantage of the benefits offered by the nanowire network design while improving on previous sensor designs. The first major advantage our Pd/Cr sensor has is a full range of hydrogen concentrations; it solves the 3% saturation issue found in the pure Pd sensor. The second major advantage the new sensor has over the pure Pd sensor is a significantly shorter response time. Finally, the bilayer sensor is less expensive to manufacture than the previous sensor while still maintaining the high efficiency design.

ANTIMICROBIAL SILVER NANOPARTICLE COATING FOR TOUCH SCREEN DEVICES
Isabella Flynn Sparhawk
St. Vincent- St. Mary High School, Akron, OH

There is a definite need for this project. Hospitals have integrated touch screens into their daily work, and many people own a touch screen device. Due to the warmth of the device and the repeated use and contact with the hands, touch screen devices can be easily contaminated with bacteria. Silver has been used because it exhibits antimicrobial properties. First a polyurethane coating was selected because of its durability, solvent resistance, abrasive resistance and clear properties. Then silver nanoparticles are added.In liquid form, the silver nanoparticles appear to be a dark grey color, however, when dispersed into the clear coating it remains clear, due to the small “nano” particle size.  The silver nanoparticles are added proportionately in the amounts of 0.05%, 0.10%, 0.20%, 0.30%, 0.40% and 0.60%. <br><br>After the silver nanoparticles have been thoroughly mixed in, the coating is applied onto the glass slides. A scientific glass slide was used to simulate a touch screen. To perform the application, clamp the glass slide to the draw down table and place a size 10 Mayer rod at the top of the slide. Using a pipette, drop 5 drops of the silver nanoparticles embedded clear coating at the top of the glass slide and pull the Mayer rod across the glass slide. This creates an even, thin coating with the particles evenly dispersed. For each level (0.05%, 0.10%, 0.20%, 0.30%, 0.40% and 0.60% silver) 12 slides were coated. They were then placed in an oven at 200 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 minutes. Then a standardized test was performed to determine the coatings inhibition of bacteria. The results showed that the silver nanoparticles coating did inhibit the growth of bacteria. The 0.20% is the most effective in regards to both inhibiting bacteria growth and cost.

FABRICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF POLYMERIC SOLAR CELLS VIA SPRAYCOATING
Rohan Virang Shah
Plano East Senior High, Plano, TX

A polymeric solar cell is a photovoltaic device quickly and easily produced with polymers as opposed to the more demanding processes required to fabricate efficient silicon solar cells. Conventional fabrication methods rely on spin coating solutions of polymers in organic solvents to produce the active areas. While effective in producing quality solar cells for research purposes, this method imposes limitations on the size of the solar cell and provides limited control over thickness and composition of the spun layers. Additionally, to spin coat multiple layers, one must first be certain that the underlying layers will not be harmed by the solvent being spun. To address these limitations, we gradually built layers of polymers without damaging underlying layers of polymer. As the sub-layers are unharmed, it becomes feasible to produce devices with differing morphologies layer to layer.<br><br>While developing this method, we characterized the films formed by differing combinations of organic solvents, concentrations of solution to air sprayed, and combinations of Poly 3-Hexylthiophene (P3HT) and Phenyl-C61-Butyric-Acid-Methyl-Ester (PCBM) layers. The resulting films were characterized by analyzing their roughness, thickness and uniformity. With the best combination of processing conditions, we produced solar cells with various active layer morphologies, ranging from simple bilayer structures to more complex bulk heterojunctions. We found that the power conversion efficiencies and voltage current characteristics of these cells are 139.5% more efficient than spincoated solar cells. These results have opened possibilities for producing larger, more complicated devices while remaining mass producible and cost effective.

POTENTIAL OF BENTONITE-BASED GEOPOLYMER COMPOSITES IN ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS
Myriah Lynn Sylvester
Greybull High School, Greybull, Wyoming, USA

Geopolymerization is a geosynthesis that allows for products to exhibit the most ideal properties of rock forming elements. Some of these properties could include hardness, chemical stability, and longevity that is equal to natural geologic longevity. Bentonite is a relatively soft stone, formed over geological time by the natural alteration of volcanic ash. It is composed of plate-silicate minerals, and belongs to the group of minerals known as alumino-silicates. This research will look at bentonite as a composite additive. Properties of these geopolymers will be compared to determine if the addition of geologic components provides increased applications for polymers and polymer composites.<br><br> To evaluate the effect of bentonite on different polymers, many different tests were run. The first step was to make the composite by adding bentonite to the polymer during the formation process. After the polymer had been formed, two temperature tests, a flammability test, a corrosion test, and a force test were done. <br><br> From the initial results, it can be concluded that bentonite does have an affect on the polymers’ characteristics. However, these differences do not show enough evidence to substantiate one polymer from the other.<br><br> Continuing experimentation is focused on developing geopolymer composite matrices and the effects of variation in bentonite percentage. These results may lead to a more definite conclusion.<br><br>

GET YOUR HEAD IN THE GAME AGAIN WITH ALARMS!
Sara Bea Moore
Great Mills High School, Great Mills, MD

Fifty-four full-scale rapid repeated drop tower impacts in three orthogonal orientations on sports helmets lined with corrugated cardboard, green CONFOR™foam, and “off-the-shelf “ standard Styrofoam helmet lining were conducted in a student-designed NOCSAE compliant helmet drop tower made from recycled materials. Acceleration onset slope, average acceleration over time, and Gadd Severity Indices (GSI) were compared with the intent of characterizing the predictability and repeatability of the material performance under rapid repeated loading conditions. Evaluation of the impact data showed that the corrugated cardboard and CONFOR™ foam GSI properties showed less propensity for head injury than the Styrofoam for rapid repeated top of head impacts. Further, the Styrofoam peak accelerations exceeded those of the cardboard and CONFOR™ foam by 17% and 73% respectively and the onset slope of the cardboard and CONFOR™ foam were significantly reduced, supporting the conclusion that the cardboard and CONFOR™ foam are better suited for head protection under rapid repeated impacts. The results of testing were then used to support development of ALARMS (AcceLeration Alert, Recording, and Monitoring System) which relies on materials with predictable and repeatable response characteristics to reliably provide a visual and audible indication of when the helmet material has reached its structural protection limit and must be replaced. In addition, ALARMS records and identifies the severity, duration, and number of player head impacts to facilitate on-the-scene triage to mitigate the risk of continued activity for players who may appear unhurt, but whom have actually experienced severe or traumatic brain injury (TBI) events.

STUDY ON POLY(ETHYLENE TEREPHTHALATE) / POLYPROPYLENE MICROFIBRILLAR COMPOSITE
Chun Hei LAM
Shun Tak Fraternal Association Yung Yau College, Hong Kong, China

Nowadays, there are considerable supplies of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and polypropylene (PP) in the form of postconsumer scraps. These wastestreams of PET and PP could be a low cost source of raw materials for forming polymer blends. This study aims to develop a PET/PP microfibrillar composite that can be processed by conventional molding methods. PET/PP blends of different PP species and compositions were compounded and extruded through a round die of 2 mm diameter using a twin screw extruder to produce PET fibre/PP matrix composites. It was found that high PET content, high draw ratio and low compounding temperature favored the formation of PET fibres. Moreover, voids and cavities were formed in the composite due to different thermal contraction of PP and PET and to the volatiles given off during the extrusion process. Tensile tests showed that the strength of the composites first increased and then dropped off as the amount of PET was increased. Under suitable processing conditions, the PET/PP blend having a composition ratio of 10/90 has the highest strength, with an improvement of 18% compared with the pure PP. The ultimate objective is to develop a technology for recycling PET and PP.

FEELING FUZZY? II
Samantha Nicole Coday
The Academy of Science and Technology, The Woodlands, TX

The purpose of this study was to identify the reliability and practicality of using fuzzy logic and automatic controls in order to simulate the regulation of the amount of hydration in a human system. The amount of dehydration was simulated through the use of dye; this concentration was measured as it left “the body.” The electrical components assembled measured the concentration of the dye. The fuzzy logic program then used the concentration to administer fluids into the system. The overall validity of the system created was tested through 50 trials of dye insertion at selected times. The amount of time it took to completely remove the dye from the system was calculated for each trial. The average time for clearing during all fifty trials was 1.14 seconds ± .57s. These results provide evidence that support the validity of the system tested. The future applications of this system and autonomous controls in general include: the safe administration of pain-killers and antibiotics. The application of control systems in medical environments have the potential to reduce over prescription and human error.

THE SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF UNIFORMLY-SHAPED GOLD NANOPARTICLES
Samantha Rose Reeves
Hathaway Brown, Shaker Heights, OH

The synthesis of well-defined nanomaterials, in terms of their size, shape, crystal structure and morphology, is of great importance to the envisioned applications. For example, as the size of a particle decreases, its surface to volume ratio increases and the catalytic properties of the nanoparticles are enhanced. Additionally, this is desirable when using expensive metals such as gold (Au) as a catalyst in chemical applications. Unfortunately, synthesizing well-defined nanopartics remains a significant challenge. <br><br>In this project, we are interested in developing an understanding of how to synthesize uniformly-shaped metal nanoparticles. Shaped Au nanoparticles were grown using a seed mediated growth technique. Aqueous solutions of tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide and sodium borohydride were initially added the solution of tetracholorauric acid. This resulted in the formation of small sized ‘seed’ particles. Particles of different shape were then made by changing the ratio of tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide, ascorbic acid, and the seed particles. Particles of cubic, triangular pyramid, spherical, and bipyramid shape could all be formed with different number concentrations depending on the ratio of the parameters. Using various characterization techniques such as transmission electron microscopy, X-ray Diffraction, and UV-Visible light spectroscopy, we assessed the different shapes and attempted to tune the process so that only a single shape could be produced. The results of our efforts, as well as potential applications and remaining challenges, will be presented.

EGFR-TARGETED GOLD NANOPARTICLE CONSTRUCTS FOR CANCER NANOMEDICINE
Trent Kaveh Navran
Solon High School, Solon, OH

‘Targeted Nanomedicine’, a highly refined way for treating tumors selectively at a molecular level, involves development of nanoparticle constructs that can deliver therapeutic payloads specifically to tumor tissue while minimizing uptake and systemic side-effects in healthy tissues. Tumor-selective delivery of the particles can happen initially through enhanced permeation through the leaky tumor vasculature and then by active binding and uptake mediated by tumor cell-specific receptors. To this end, my research focuses on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) surface-decorated with peptide ligands with high affinity to Epidermal Growth Factor Receptors (EGFRs). Gold has high chemical resistance, strong electron absorption, tunable optical and photothermal characteristics, and tailorable payload delivery avenues. EGFR upregulation has been implicated in signaling pathways that mediate cancer growth, survival and aggressiveness, in a variety of cancers. Hence EGFR-targeted AuNPs can provide an efficient platform for cancer-targeted nanomedicine. <br><br>AuNPs of controlled diameters were developed via galvanic replacement reactions from silver seeds and characterized by Dynamic Light Scattering and microscopy. The AuNPs were surface-decorated with EGFR-targeting GE-11 peptides using gold-thiol chemistry. Peptide-modified AuNPs were studied in vitro for their targeting efficacy on EGFR-overexpressing A-431 epidermoid carcinoma cells. The results indicate that the peptide-decorated AuNPs target A-431 cells significantly more compared to unmodified AuNPs, resulting in EGFR-mediated uptake. Optimized EGFR-targeted AuNP constructs can be potentially used in photodiagnostic imaging, photothermal therapy and phototriggered drug delivery applications cell-selectively in EGFR-overexpressing tumors.

ECOLOGICAL AGENTS EFFECT ON SYNTHETIC TANNING OF TILAPIA FISH SKIN
Priscila Oliveira Andre
ETEC Carmelino Correa Junior, Franca, SP, BRASIL

My research is on tanning of Tilapia fish skins, which is considered an exotic skin. My project is an innovation for the tannery industry since it seeks the optimization of processes that use alternative products which minimize the waste that harm the environment, by using clean technologies. The focus of my research was to verify if it is possible to use ecological tanning agents, replacing or minimizing the use of chrome and obtain products with the same characteristics and resistance of the leather processed only with chrome. My main goal was to select different tanning agents for Tilapia fish skin, producing clean technology. My specific goals were to: 1) select different tanning agents, apply and I conduct testes to verify performance based on color analysis and plates characteristics; 2) test shrinkage resistance in hot water (retraction test); 3) test different re-tanning agents used in the process based on the experiments conducted with different tanning agents; 4) compare the results of re-tanned skins, based on tear and elasticity resistance, softness, stuffing, and color characteristics of plates. The experiments were conducted in my school laboratory, where I used tanning agents such as aluminum sulfate, titanium oxide, polymeric resin and vegetable tannins, while physical tests were conducted in a partner research laboratory. This research proves that it is possible to use greener tanning agents and obtain products with very close characteristics desired from industrial tanning agents obtained through chrome treatment. It is a technique that can be adopted in the industry to produce quality products and will contribute to using greener processes.

THE FABRICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF TOP AND BOTTOM GATED CARBON NANOTUBE FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTORS USING PRINTED ELECTRONICS
Harsha Sudarsan Uppili
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland, OR

This study attempted to ascertain whether high-performance transistors could be fabricated at room temperature, on flexible substrates, while using a low-cost inkjet printer. Printed electronics enables low cost, large area electronic systems. Organic semiconducting transistors exhibit low operating currents due to poor electron and hole mobility values (< 1 cm^2/V-sec). These transistors require high voltage power supplies (~30 V) for operation, thus making them unattractive for low-power applications, one of the primary technology requirements in printed electronics. In addition, the fabrication of organic semiconducting transistors using printed electronics typically requires a high temperature (>100° C) step in the process flow. Randomly oriented semiconducting Carbon Nanotubes with high electron and hole mobility values (>10 cm^2/V-sec) are an attractive alternative semiconducting material for the fabrication of high performance transistors. An innovative process technology was developed to fabricate Carbon Nanotube transistors on plastic sheets at room temperature. A low cost inkjet printer was used to define transistor source-drain metallization on both aluminum and plastic substrates. This study successfully demonstrated fully-functional, Carbon Nanotube transistors fabricated at room temperature with hole mobility values as high as 680 cm^2/V-sec, operating voltage less than 2 V, and ON/OFF ratios as high as 14,620. A phenomenological model describing the transistor characteristics was developed and used in a SPICE simulator to simulate an inverter logical operation. The unique room temperature processing of devices on a flexible, transparent substrate allows for transistors-on-anything.<br><br> <br><br>

AN ORGANIC THIN FILM TRANSISTOR AND ELASTIC ORGANIC SOLAR CELL BASED ELECTRONIC SKIN FOR BIOCHEMICAL AND TACTILE SENSING
Ryota Ishizuka
Greenwich High School, Greenwich, CT

Organic Thin Film Transistors (OTFTs) are low-cost and scalable electronics that have been limited by their dependence on external power sources. The development of stretchable Organic Photovoltaic Devices (OPVCs) would allow for solar harvesting on non-planar surfaces of textiles, vehicles, and buildings or integration into such OTFT electronics to provide portable energy. This study demonstrates flexible OTFT pressure sensors powered by elastic OPVCs, which may serve as electronic skin mimicking tactile sensing for artificial intelligence. Compressive strains were applied to a PDMS elastomer of OPVCs with e-GaIn liquid metal top contacts and grapheme oxide base layers, creating elastic film buckles. PDMS substrate and thin film thicknesses were analyzed by Spectral Reflectance, SEM, and EDS to optimize outputs. Optimized elastic OPVCs generated 0.56V at a PCE of 2.56% while stretched to 120%, paralleling production from conventional rigid OPVCs. Compression of the PDMS dielectric in OTFT pressure sensors produced changes in device capacitance and output current corresponding to the applied pressure. Sensitivity was maximized with varying substrates, organic semiconductors, and electrodes. OTFTs detected minute pressures of 500 Pa with a rapid response of 0.2 seconds. Adaptability of OTFT applications was demonstrated through a biosensor OTFT with laminated flow cell that converted the binding of negative biomolecules to current changes. Label-free detection of trace elements of biotin and SDS was achieved with CuPc surface passivation films, which potentially allow for multiple analyte discriminating sites. The novel elastic, collapsible, and robust OPVCs may serve as off-grid power for a new generation of flexible and self-powered consumer and biomedical devices.

There is a group of people in our society who are not able to turn pages while reading because of their disabilities or limited mobility. Such problems often discourage the disabled from reading. If these people had a device that could help them turn the pages easily, the process of reading would become much more convenient. The goal of my project is to invent a machine that would have a low cost and could be used widely (especially for the disabled).<br><br> The device uses a page-twisting wheel simulating the human hand and a pendulum-bar simulating the human arm to accomplish the page-turning process just as human beings do. When the user touches the micro-switch with any part of the body or makes a sound to the sound-sensor, the two micro-motors will drive the pendulum-bar and the page-twisting wheel to revolve to the page. After twisting, they¡¯ll be driven in reverse to take the page to the other side of the book. And the linkage-clamps driven by another two micro-motors will link and clamp the pages that have been turned.<br><br> This device could solve the problem of page-turning for more people than the disabled, for example, musicians who need to practice passages of music over and over again, professional typists and so on. It should be easily accepted because of its simple operation, low cost and usefulness.<br><br> <br><br>

IMPROVING THE EFFICACY OF ORTHOTICS FOR NEUROPATHIC FOOT ULCERATIONS
Isabelle Cicely Gill
Nicolet High School, Glendale, WI

Over half of all non-traumatic lower extremity amputations in the US are caused by neuropathic foot ulcerations, a problem affecting 25% of diabetics. These wounds are treated by removing pressure from them through the use of orthotics. Neuropathy prevents these patients from being able to feel any pressure, so they are unable tell if the orthotic is in fact reducing pressure. It is known that 86% of these amputations could have been prevented by patient education and appropriate footwear. The current test of the effectiveness of an orthotic is to wait a couple of weeks and see if the wound improves; however, if it has worsened, it can greatly increase the chance of infection and amputation. The purpose of this project was to design an inexpensive device that gives orthotists information about how much pressure is on wounds with and without orthotics so they are able to make the necessary modifications immediately. This was accomplished using a force-sensing resistor in a circuit that incorporates an inverting op-amp to linearize the output of pressure shown to the orthotist. The device also has a 3X zoom feature that shows higher resolution at lower pressures. The device has been proven effective and responses received from doctors have been very positive. It offers immediate feedback on the efficacy of an orthotic at removing pressure from an ulceration. This will decrease the likelihood of amputations because doctors will not need to wait for a wound to change to determine if an orthotic needs modifications.

Optimized elastic OPVCs generated 0.56V at a PCE of 2.56% while stretched to 120%, paralleling production from conventional rigid OPVCs. Compression of the PDMS dielectric in OTFT pressure sensors produced changes in device capacitance and output current corresponding to the applied pressure. Sensitivity was maximized with varying substrates, organic semiconductors, and electrodes. OTFTs detected minute pressures of 500 Pa with a rapid response of 0.2 seconds. Adaptability of OTFT applications was demonstrated through a biosensor OTFT with laminated flow cell that converted the binding of negative biomolecules to current changes. Label-free detection of trace elements of biotin and SDS was achieved with CuPc surface passivation films, which potentially allow for multiple analyte discriminating sites. The novel elastic, collapsible, and robust OPVCs may serve as off-grid power for a new generation of flexible and self-powered consumer and biomedical devices.

TILTING CAR - DEVELOPMENT OF A CONCEPT
Andreas Hauge
Danielsen Videregaaende Skole, Bergen, Hordaland, Norway

The aim of this project is to develop a car that tilts inwards when driving through a curve, so that the resultant of the centrifugal force and the force of gravity always work perpendicular on the seats of the car. This is supposed to give a more comfortable drive, as the driver and passengers no longer will experience being pulled outwards when the car drives through a curve.<br><br>This project consists of two parts. The first part describes the physical forces on a car driving through a curve, and presents a formula for calculating the appropriate tilting angle. The second part of the project develops the tilting car. In the development process different solutions to the task are presented, evaluated, and improved or exchanged with other solutions. The tilting system consists of two main parts; the framework and body of the car and the hydraulic system which makes the car tilt. In addition there are different components and details described that are necessary for the car to function, such as an accelerometer and a simple control system.<br><br> <br><br>The result of the project is a description and several drawings showing the main features of the car. The tilting system is developed in a satisfactory manner. However the car needs to be developed further if it is going to drive the road, as there are unsolved problems. For example, the car is heavy, large, and limited in space inside. The final question is if anybody is interested in buying such a car.

THE CONSTRUCTION OF ROTOPLAN MODEL
Romas Vitautovich Gaylyus
Aginsk Secondary School No. 2, Aginskiy Buriatskiy AO, p. Aginskoye, Russia

This work is the result of experiments for creating simple lying machines. The first idea was to construct a model glider. At first, it wasn’t planed to extend the research then to construct simple paper gliders and then more complicated gliders. Afterwards when the volume of theoretical material had increased the problems of more complicated models of gliders, helicopters and plans became interesting we decided to construct a model of rotoplan. If you look at a rotoplan from the side, it is not difficult to notice its resemblance to a plane. This profile fuselage became the main support for the further development of the model. Then we were interested in the power sets, used in air modem. While working it was decided that, the only reasonable solution was the use of the axle model in helicopters, because during the fly reactive moments of the same carrying screws mutually balance as the screws revolve in contrary directions with the same speed. This model solved one more problem: the arrangement of the tail end. They are of no use. The model was practically ready, only while planning the incorrect position of the screws reduced slightly aerodynamic quality of the model. One more difficult task appeared before us – to set at the model machine deforms. At first researches we managed to construct a simple scheme of a machine deforms. After that some experiments were made. The model was ready.

EFFECTIVENESS OF DIFFERENT POLYSTYRENES IN BICYCLE HELMETS
Rosie Watters
Trinity Anglican School, White Rock, Queensland, AUSTRALIA

Every year, hundreds of thousands of cyclists are killed or seriously injured due to brain or spinal damage in crashes. Helmets play a huge role in decreasing these injuries, so this experiment tested the force reducing abilities of different polystyrenes, to make sure the safest possible polystyrene can be used in helmets in order to minimise injury. The experiment also examined the value of the polystyrene once it had been involved in a collision.<br><br> The experimental apparatus consisted of a head shaped mass, which was dropped onto a piece of polystyrene, simulating a head on collision. A force platform located underneath the polystyrene took transmitted force readings every millisecond throughout the collision. Using this set-up, polystyrenes of different densities and thicknesses were compared, different momentum collisions were investigated, different shaped masses were experimented with and the effect of multiple collisions on the same area of polystyrene was tested.<br><br> It was found that the 25mm thick and low density polystyrene was the most effective at reducing peak force. The experiment also demonstrated that if the polystyrene was permanently deformed during the collision then it reduced the peak force more than if it remained visibly unchanged (showing almost elastic properties). The key finding was that once polystyrene has had a significant impact, its subsequent peak force reducing ability decreases by approximately 35%. This means that after a large impact, a helmet will be less effective and should be replaced.

CAN RECYCLED RUBBER MATERIALS BE USED IN CONCRETE TO: REDUCE ENVIRONMENTAL AND LANDFILL WASTE, REDUCE PETROLEUM USAGE, AND REDUCE THE CARBON FOOTPRINT WHILE IMPROVING THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF BRIDGES, ROADS AND BUILDINGS?
John Charles Boykin
St. Peter Chanel, Bedford, OH

Can recycled rubber materials be used in concrete to, reduce environmental and landfill waste, reduce petroleum usage, and reduce the carbon footprint while improving the infrastructure of bridges, roads and buildings?<br><br>Recycled rubbers were tested in structural concrete to see if recycled rubbers could be used as an additive to improves properties and reduce environmental waste. Recycled rubbers were obtained, reduced in size and shape to less than 6mm particle sizes. The recycled rubbers were measured, weighed and prepared for testing at 5% of the concrete mixture. The recycled rubbers and concrete mixtures were tested under many conditions that included, heat, freeze chemical testing, environmental testing, acid base, and solvent, impact and crush test. The tests were run ten times for repeatability and reliability. The test results indicate adding recycled rubber material to concrete did improve or maintain major chemical and structural properties of the concrete. The use of recycled rubbers in concrete can help reduce environmental waste and landfill waste. It can help reduce petroleum usage in concrete production by replacing rubber for concrete. Using recycled rubbers in concrete can reduce the number of landfills that are generated while improving roads and bridges and reducing greenhouse gas generation. The use of recycled rubber in concrete increased the abrasion resistance by 7%, reduced the crush break off weight by 10%, reduced the gasoline absorption by 7% and maintained the gravel test at 5%.

INVENTION OF THE UVIEW PROTECTOR: REDUCING YOUR RISK OF SKIN CANCER
Ethan Thomas Butson
The Illawarra Grammar School, Mangerton, New South Wales, AUSTRALIA

Abstract<br><br><br>This project aimed to invent and characterize a dosimetrically accurate Ultraviolet (UV) sensitive badge, which provides a unique educational tool to significantly improve people's knowledge about UV radiation.<br><br>Processes involving characterization of physical and UV absorption properties of radiochromic films were performed to find optimal conditions for UV analysis. After finding the best method for analysis for UV dosimetry and the optimal scanning and production methods, the new UView Protector film badge was developed. This involved the construction of a multi-layer style badge with a colour coded top layer simulating various UV exposure levels surrounding an inner “active, UV sensitive” section for visual colour matches. Optimal construction processes and characteristics were measured and performed. <br><br>The UView Protector was tested and found to be an accurate UV dosimeter within 7%. The badge was used to measure UV exposure levels of primary school students. This facilitated two purposes: 1. Improving the knowledge of children concerning UV exposure i.e. when, where and the level they were exposed to. Results showed that on average, UV questionnaire results improved from 45% correct to 91% correct after use of the UView Protector. 2. It provided an immediate visual and qualitative measure of UV as well as measuring accurately within 7% through scanning analysis. <br><br>A new accurate (within 7%) UV measurement badge was successfully created. This device, the UView Protector, was also found to significantly improve the knowledge about UV for primary school aged children.

CREATING A RADIATING STRUCTURE FOR BREAST CANCER SELF-DETECTION USING MICROWAVES
Sheila S. Chandrahas
Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science, Denton, TX

Approximately 20% of breast cancers go undiagnosed and undetected. Current methods of breast cancer detection are highly invasive, expensive, and can be quite inaccurate. Early detection of breast cancer is the best way to fight the disease and survive. My ultimate objective in this research is to create a handheld structure that could be used in breast cancer self detection. ldeally, this structure will be in a radiating, dome shape and have sixteen dipole antennas that will be able to detect cancerous tumors within the breast tissue using microwave radiation.<br><br>Microwave radiation would be the most patient friendly way to detect breast cancer because microwaves are non-ionizing. This means that microwaves do not carry enough energy per quantum to ionize from an atom; they are a type of<br><br>electromagnetic radiation that only have enough energy to excite a molecule. This study will use the Ansoft Softwares HFSS, HFSS Antenna design kit, and SolidWorks. HFSS is a finite element method solver for electromagnetic structures and stands for high frequency structural stimulators. The first step in this process was to figure out the ideal microwave frequency that would be optimal in order to detect a tumor. Using HFSS, I gathered that a frequency of 1.2 GHz would be optimal. After building antennas to function at the desired frequency, I experimented with breast phantom recipes to further test the development of this device.

ANTI-OSCILLATION SYSTEM -AN ADVANCED SHOCK ABSORBER IN VEHICLES
Ying Kit NG
TWGHs Wong Fut Nam College, Hong Kong, China

Cars bring us a lot of convenience. However, there are still many things we can improve to make our journey a more comfortable experience. Existing shock absorbers in vehicles use dense fluid as a damping device (fixed damping coefficient) and it does not best fit all road conditions.<br><br> In order to overcome this problem, the Anti-Oscillation System uses a Motion Detector to detect the vertical motion of the vehicle body. A computer collects the information and generates suitable signals to the Interface. The Interface controls the current passing through a damping device, thus adjusting the damping force that is used to dissipate the vibrational energy of the suspension spring. With continuous monitoring of vibration and real time adjustment of the damping force, the suspension spring goes back to the equilibrium in the shortest time without further oscillation. In this way, critical damping is achieved.<br><br> Experimental results show that my system can eliminate most of the unwanted shocks of the suspension spring of the vehicle. With the assistance of a computer, my system can provide an accurate damping force by a feedback mechanism.<br><br> My system may be improved to fit extreme road conditions such as rugged roads in the forest. The driver only needs to select among prewritten programs, without any adjustments of hardware. My system may also be modified so that it can be used as any type of shock absorber for different purposes.

LITTLE NEEDLES! THE FABRICATION OF GOLD BIOCOMPATIBLE MICRONEEDLES WITH DISSOLVABLE NANO-SCALE TIPS FOR THE TREATMENT AND DIAGNOSIS OF MALIGNANT CELLS
Michelle Songin Park
R.L. Turner High School, Carrollton, TX

Microneedles serve as a mechanism for painless drug delivery restricted only to the epidermal layer. This limitation arises due to immediate drug release upon contact and the microneedle’s non-biocompatible chemical composition. To solve for these limitations, a novel microneedle structure was fabricated allowing for a method of in-vivo, minimally invasive treatment of malignant cells. <br><br> Microneedle arrays were fabricated using SU-8 spin coating and planarizing. Because gold is a benign biocompatible chemical composition, the arrays underwent Cr-Au sputtering and Au electroplating, solving for the first limitation. The slightly tapered microneedles were plasma etched creating a hollow structure; however, the sharp microneedles were coated with polydimethylsiloxane to create molds for dissolvable nano-scale tips. The molds were reversed and a layer of PVA:PVP:Water was applied to create dissolvable tips, solving for the second limitation. A total of eighteen trials were completed to find the most successful ratio of PVA:PVP:Water with medium viscosity, maximum mold formation, and solid tip structures. Before complete solidification, the dissolvable nano-scale tips (0.5:7:2.5) and the slightly tapered microneedles were attached. Drug diffusion was deemed successful after observing uniform dispersion of red-dye in electrode gel representing malignant tissue. <br><br> The development of biocompatible microneedles assures a method of in-vivo treatment and diagnosis of malignant cells that is feasible and effective. My treatment maximizes precision of drug delivery leaving absolutely no harm to healthy cells and only eradicating malignant cells such as cancer and tumors, ultimately saving the millions of lives lost due to detrimental effects of modern day cancer treatments.

A humanoid robot always means expensive and unavailable, what preclude students from carrying on the study in this area. The first aim of this project is to provide a general humanoid robot system/platform suitable for study. The goal of my study on dynamic balance function is to explore a new control avenue of humanoid robots¡¯ walking with a natural gait and self-adaptation of uneven surfaces, needing less calculating and energy.<br><br> Being different from the traditional theory based on previous mathematic solution of movements, this project has proved the possibility of a response-based realization of walking on two legs. A two-axis gyro was used to tell the attitude of the body. Two groups of sensors on feet can capture the state of touching the ground. The signals from these receptors were synthesized, therefore the robot can keep a dynamic balance and adapt to uneven surfaces by itself. Without computing the inertia and gravity work on it, the robot can figure out the direction Zero Moment Point (ZMP) placed, and then responds to keep in a stable standing state. Above the level of response-programs, a general behavior and state-recognition program is always working, so that the system can realize its falling down or other changes in the situation, and then choose a proper countermeasure to take.<br><br>

DESIGN AND EVALUATION OF A CELL-PHONE COMPATIBLE WIRELESS ELECTROCARDIOGRAPH
Catherine Wong
Morristown High School, Morristown, NJ

The purpose of this study was to design and evaluate a low-cost wireless electrocardiograph compatible with a Bluetooth-capable cell phone. Development continued prior work on a wireless stethoscope, also used over the cell-phone platform. The current device allows for cardiac examination by a remotely-located physician via cell-phone through transmission of an EKG (electrocardiogram) image, targeted towards impoverished or inaccessible areas lacking adequate local healthcare services where the recent near-ubiquity of cellular networks would allow for the implementation of a cell-phone based device. However, design also considered potential applications for remote examination even in developed areas, with focus on maximum platform compatibility for Bluetooth-enabled cell-phones. <br><br>The general prototype construction involved two components, a Bluetooth-enabled microprocessor board to process the analog EKG signal, and instrumentation amplifier circuitry. Multiple prototype amplification circuits were developed to minimize electrical noise interference and reduce externalized components to increase stability and clarity of the resultant EKG signal. An additional prototype circuit was developed through modification of a printed circuit board schematic initially intended for audio amplification. Analog data was sampled on the microprocessor board and transmitted wirelessly to a cell-phone, where a separate Java platform was developed to graphically display dynamic EKG output. <br><br>The final prototypes developed successfully allowed for a three-lead EKG cell-phone display, and significantly reduce size and cost in comparison to existing EKG designs, suggesting broad-ranging potential applications for remote and chronic healthcare monitoring and screening over cellular networks.

Purpose<br><br>In this project, my goal has been to build a device which can monitor a home and contents for safety and security. The effectiveness of the device hinges on its ability to make the correct response to a range of possible stimulants. Moreover, it must be easy to operate with no complicated installation. The cost should be modest so materials and hardware need to be standard and widely available. Emergent communications technologies are, fortunately, becoming more affordable (and effective). Importantly, the device must be able to perform the optimal number of functions without compromising its overall utility or low cost. Hence the device is tentatively entitled, "Total Equip".<br><br>Procedures<br><br>The procedures involved in completing this project were many. The issue of materials for construction of the shell and moveable parts was one of the first to be addressed for the prototype; cheaper materials (such as a rubbish bin) proved adequate. Mechanical decisions were also time consuming. However electronics and programming proved the most demanding in terms of skills, time and finance.<br><br>Observations<br><br>The device has been effective in trials but testing has not been extensive enough to explore all the variables.<br><br>Conclusions<br><br>As automated home monitoring devices with linkages to outside computers (office, police or security firm) become commonplace, the emergence of WiFi and mobile phone technologies creates the possibility of making this function mobile. This project seeks to explore the possibilities. <br><br>

DETERMINING IF MAGNETOSPIRILLUM MAGNETOTACTICUM CAN BE USED TO KILL TETRAHYMENA PYRIFORMIS VIA MAGNETICALLY INDUCED HYPERTHERMIA AS A BASIS FOR ALTERNATIVE CANCER TREATMENT
Anurag Narain Mathur
Academy of Science, Sterling, VA

Traditional cancer treatments kill many healthy cells, causing numerous side-effects. This research attempts to rectify this issue by establishing a basis for an alternative cancer treatment using M. magnetotacticum, a bacteria that magnetizes iron particles in its environment creating “biological nanomagnets”. In theory, using an alternating magnetic field, or magnetically induced hyperthermia, causes the biological nanomagnets to vibrate, increasing the temperature of the surrounding area enough to kill cancer cells but not healthy cells. The protozoa T. pyriformis was used as a model for cancer cells because both are killed at 43o Celsius. Last year, E. coli K12 was tested with T. pyriformis as the sole control. No experimental testing was conducted last year. This year, a more accurate method for determining non-viability was instituted as well as testing with a new control (T. pyriformis only), the original control (E. coli with T. pyriformis), and the experimental (M. magnetotacticum with T. pyriformis). On a microscope slide, equal amounts of T. pyriformis and M. magnetotacticum were combined and the percentage of non-viable T. pyriformis was counted. This slide was then suspended over a spin plate, set at maximum speed, creating an alternating magnetic field. After 10 minutes, the slide was removed and the T. pyriformis’ non-viability was again determined. As a control, T. pyriformis was tested independently as well as with E. coli K12. The results show that, when combined with M. magnetotacticum, there is an increase of 28.21% in the non-viability of T. pyriformis. In contrast, trials with only T. pyriformis and with E. coli showed an increase in non-viability of 1.92% and 3.13% respectively. These findings could possibly be translated over to cancer cells, meaning that this treatment could be used to target and treat solid tumors. While more research must be conducted regarding biocompatibility, this research has suggested that there is a foundation for such a treatment.

COLLAGEN-HYALURONIC ACID MEMBRANES FOR TISSUE REGENERATION
Nilesh Atul Kavthekar
Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, Aurora, IL

It is not currently possible to restore injured tendons and ligaments to normal function using conventional tissue transplanted. Due to inherent problems with replicating tendon and ligament insertion sites into bone, limited allograft donors, and high cost for transplantation, scaffolds for tissue regeneration are highly sought to completely repair injured tissue with cells from the body of the patient. Collagen and hyaluronic acid (HA), components of the fibrous tissue that compose tendon and ligament, can interact to produce a composite membrane that functions as such a scaffold.<br><br><br>This study compared untreated collagen-HA (Control) membranes with membranes with added electronegative solute. Components studied for each membrane type were mechanical (tensile) strength, membrane surface topography, and seeded human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) growth.<br><br>Mechanically, unmodified collagen-HA membranes were significantly stronger than NaCl-treated collagen-HA membranes. Treated membranes also had a logarithmic decrease in water contact angle over time, displaying hydrophilic properties. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the membranes showed flat surface topography on unmodified collagen-HA membranes, while NaCl-treated collagen-HA membranes had more non-uniform surface topography. Due to higher cell affinity for wet, microscopically non-uniform surfaces, these results indicated that in theory cells would attach and proliferate more readily on NaCl-treated membranes than on Control membranes. hMSCs remained viable on all membranes tested 14 days post-seeding, and reached near-confluency on both unmodified and NaCl-modified membrane surfaces. In sum, this investigation demonstrated the efficacy of collagen-HA membranes as devices for ligament and tendon regeneration.

AN INVESTIGATION OF THE POROSITY AND MORPHOLOGY OF FUSION-BONDED EPOXY
Rachel Alexandra Strauss
Roanoke Valley Governor's School for Science and Technology, Roanoke, VA

Corrosion of steel in transportation structures due to chloride infiltration costs the United States approximately $8.3 billion per year. The most common method of protecting the steel is through the use of fusion-bonded epoxy coatings. The effectiveness of epoxy is unclear as various studies have produced controversial findings. The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the porosity of fusion-bonded epoxy samples extracted from various bridges. This was achieved by the use of a Scanning Electron Microscope to examine the cross-sectional area of the epoxy samples. J-Image data analysis software was then used to calculate the porosity percentage. This percentage was then compared with other predetermined characteristics of the epoxy such as glass transition temperature, corrosion potential (indicative of corrosion activity), and surface porosity. The epoxy was shown to be much more porous then previously assumed. The percentage of voids comprised anywhere from 4.2% to 39.5% of the total cross-sectional area. There appeared to be a correlation between cross-sectional porosity, corrosion potential, and glass transition temperature. There was no apparent correlation between cross-sectional porosity and surface porosity. The cause of the high porosity is speculated to be either 1) a result of inconsistencies in the manufacturing process (such as uneven bar temperature at time of coating application) which leads to incomplete curing of the epoxy coatings or 2) gas entrapment during the coating process. This porosity in the epoxy coating can then lead to an increased diffusion rate of corrosion-causing contaminants such as chlorides, oxygen, and water.

GRAVITY PRESSING ROLLER SKATE
Rong Huang
Bengbu No.2 Senior Middle School, Anhui Province, P.R.China

The traditional roller skate consists of skate body and pulleys. It is pushed forward by a component force of the reactive power produced by the alternative side-backward pressing of the feet. In this case, the self-gravity of people cannot be utilized properly.<br><br>According to the knowledge of mechanical transmission, I designed and manufactured two sorts of gravity pressing roller skates. <br><br>The skate takes hinge and center pin as its pivot point respectively and forms movable frame by spare parts. The body and chassis of it can make relative motion. Through rack and gears, the self-gravity of people's body can be transformed into rotation force, which thereby drives the wheel to run forward and the people to slide forward.<br><br>When driving the skate, people are only required to make alternative steps of their feet, which makes the gravity to act on the skate body alternatively and produces continuous drive force with less strength consumed.

EMPIRICAL FORMULA FOR PREDICTION COEFFICIENT OF FRICTION
Matthew B. Emig
Clay High School, Green Cove Springs, FL

Tribology is defined as the science of interacting surfaces in relative motion. Ali Erdimir’s 2000 study found links between coefficient of friction and percent ionicity. To expand upon Erdimir’s research, this study attempts to develop a mathematical model to predict coefficient of friction using mechanical properties. Fifteen well known material properties were obtained for twenty-one solid crystalline structures. To analyze correlations between properties and friction coefficient, a Principle Component Analysis was performed. This demonstrated that molar weight and melting temperature have the highest correlation to coefficient of friction. An initial formula was then created and analyzed resulting in an inaccurate two property model. To increase the formula’s accuracy additional properties were introduced based upon their level of correlation to coefficient of friction. As more characteristics were introduced the accuracy increased. To further explore this trend all fifteen properties were included in the formula, resulting in the best representative model with an R2 value of .923 and an average error of .036µ. While accurate, this formula was too cumbersome for common use. The formula was reduced to eight variables to increase its usability. The properties used include melting temperature, molar weight, Mohs hardness, ionic potential, electronegativity difference, cation charge, cation radius and density. The reduced formula has an R2 value of .675 and an average error of .074µ. This formula, with further research, will be able to predict coefficients of friction for use in a database that will aid researchers and manufacturers to expedite the selection of materials for product development.

THE EFFECT OF THE PARTIAL SUBSTITUTION OF CEMENT WITH A RECYCLED POZZOLAN ON CONCRETE COMPRESSION STRENGTH
Jon Andrew Gustafson
Sherando High School, Stephens City, VA

A recycled pozzolan, in this case fly ash, is used as a substitute for cement and the resulting concrete compression strength is measured. The hypothesis was if a recycled pozzolan is added, then the compression strength of the concrete will increase because the fine particle size of fly ash fills small voids. Samples were cast substituting different amounts of fly ash and were allowed to cure. They were then loaded to failure. The results show that fly ash strengthened the concrete up to a level of 10% cement replacement. The results support the hypothesis. The results of this experiment show that the use of fly ash can make concrete stronger. Cement production has a huge environmental impact because cement production creates one kilogram of carbon dioxide as a byproduct for every kilogram of cement produced. Since fly ash is a byproduct of the coal industry, its use produces no additional carbon dioxide and offers a green alternative to ordinary concrete.

HELPING THE BLIND TO SEE THROUGH TRANSCRANIAL STIMULI
Lucas Remoaldo Trambaiolli
Colegio Mater Amabilis, Guarulhos, Sao Paulo, BRASIL

Statistics show that the amount of totally blind in the world tends to increase quantitatively, reaching 75 million by 2020. So, this study aims at developing a prototype to help most of the totally blind to distinguish initially some forms and colors (black and another color, depending on the patient's reaction). <br><br> More than 75% of the visual deficiencies occur either in the eyeballs or in the optical nerves. In these cases, the electric activity in the visual cortex still exists, and consequently the person can perceive some points of light or flashes. The apparatus developed to deal with this deficiency sends electric pulses to the patient's visual cortex and induces the formation of these points of light. When organized, these points of light are capable of producing some simple images, depending on the amount of electrodes. <br><br> Initially, nine electrodes are being used. Thus, the user will be able to perceive basic forms, as squares and triangles, simple letters as "L" and "I", in addition to contours and obstacles. <br><br> The major difference between this research and others that have been conducted recently is the utilization of transcranial stimuli is that the user will not need any surgery to use the equipment. All it takes is to position the electrodes in the skull surface, on the visual cortex area. It is a great progress not to need surgery, because this avoids the risk of infections, traumas and body rejection to the material, among other problems. Another advantage is that this allows the user to remove the equipment at any time like for example, before sleeping, to take a shower or at any other moment. <br><br>

CELLOIDOSOMES®: A JOURNEY TOWARD THE BIOENGINEERING OF ARTIFICIAL MICRO-GLANDS AND MICRO-BIOREACTORS
Samantha Marie Marquez
Maggie L. Walker Governor's School for Government and International Studies, Richmond, VA

The cornerstone of my research project lies in the ability to design/fabricate 3D organized cell structures we call Celloidosomes®. By definition, the Celloidosome is a "living capsule" with a biomembrane shell (tissue/biofilm) and a core that acts as a container/reservoir. Novel microfluidic protocols were used as platforms to engineer multiple-emulsion templates and direct the cell assembly onto liq-liq, liq-gas, or liq-gel interfaces. This new paradigm in cell architecture enables the design and engineering of biological structures based on a "bottom-up strategy". These systems are ideal models for Bio-microreactors, Artificial Micro-Glands, and Tissue Engineering. We provide evidence for the unique functionality of the Celloidosome structure with key examples: 1) Celloidosomes as tissue building blocks (NIH-3T3 fibroblasts) without necrosis during tissue formation, in addition to a proof of concept demonstrating a novel artificial microgland (HepG2 @ NIH 3T3 Celloidosome), and 2) using chemotaxis and electrostatic driving forces, Bacteria and Yeast Celloidosomes were bioengineered (3D biofilm microbag) with applications in water treatment, Biosensing, Bioremediation, Bioconversion, and selective extraction of radioactive heavy metals. For the first time, we show evidence of two-cell, two-layer Celloidosome: a unique symbiotic cooperation between algae and bacteria to create a hybrid-Celloidosome.

TIRE RECYCLING
Luiz Henrique Martins
Instituto Biosfera, Goiania, Goias, Brazil

Useless tires are usually discarded in the environment or burnt contributing to general environmental pollution. Also, periods of heavy rain are frequent in Brazil and floods are very common. <br><br> A study was accomplished to create a new form of destination to useless tires. The main goal of this research was to develop a product that is capable to produce an environmental benefit using useless tires, and at the same time, to avoid discarding them in the environment. <br><br> When using tires, still water accumulated in them can be a focus of harmful insects like Aedes Aegypti, which is a major health problem in Brazil. Initially the tires I used were cut in a specific way to avoid the accumulation of water in their interior. Then I used these cut-tires to develop high durability draining tubes. The goal of these tubes is to act in urban draining, rural draining as well as sewages coating and drains. Such tubes increase the surface of drainage of the soil. <br><br> Practical experimentation demonstrated that the tire-based draining tubes I developed could be an important instrument for urban drainage, mainly in cities with great impermeability in the surface of the soil and occurrence of floods. <br><br>

COMMERCIAL GLAZES: THEIR AFFECTS ON THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF CERAMICS
Anthony Reed Smith
Greybull High School, Greybull, WY

Glazes are the fundamental source of strength in ceramics. They are capable of eliminating porosity, providing heat and shock resistance for everyday household use. Many ceramicists mix their own glazes but more and more are turning to commercially made glazes. One concern with commercial glazes is their stability. The goal of this experiment was to test commercial glazes for strength, heat and shock durability, and chemical leaching. <br><br> The first step was to produce the test pieces. This was done by “throwing” the pieces on a potter’s wheel. Each cup was produced using approximately one pound of red stoneware clay. The walls and floor of the cups were compressed well to insure stability. The tiles were a thrown, wide, bottomless cylinder that was well compressed and then allowed set up and cut into smaller tile pieces. These along with the cups were fired in an electric kiln to Cone 04 (approximately 1050° C) with a hood vent above the kiln to ventilate the room. <br><br> The dry glazes were then mixed below a hood vent while wearing latex gloves and a NIOSH/MSHA/OSHA approved respirator to prevent inhalation of toxic chemicals. The test pieces were glazed by dipping into the solutions to insure a uniform application. These were then fired quickly to Cone 5 (approximately 1200° C) and then a 15 minute hold was entered into the firing schedule to insure further growth of mullite crystals. <br><br> The test pieces then underwent a series of testing to insure resistance to chemical leaching, heat and shock durability, and strength. The results of the testing confirmed the hypothesis that most commercial glazes are suitable for utilitarian ware. However, variations in the chemicals included in glazes will affect the strength and durability of the piece.

BRACING SYSTEMS: INVESTIGATING THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT BRACING SYSTEMS ON THE LATERAL LOAD CAPACITY OF A STRUCTURE
Megan Catherine Russell
Buckeye Valley High School, Delaware, OH

Buildings are constructed mainly of vertical and horizontal members. These members effectively resist vertical loads. Buildings also need to resist lateral loads which may be caused by wind or seismic activity. The purpose of the experiment is to determine which type of bracing system is most effective at resting lateral forces. The hypothesis is that shear walls will withstand the most force, given the testing method.<br><br>The initial intent was to investigate seismic loading, but no testing facility was available to test under dynamic loading. However, building codes translate dynamic seismic loads into an equivalent lateral force – the method used for this experiment. Structures were constructed with different bracing systems – diagonal braces, “K” braces and shear walls – using aspen wood. The structures were tested at Terracon to determine the ultimate load capacity of each structure, and the type of failure.<br><br>For each sample, the ultimate strength of the structure was determined by the maximum force resisted. The structural system with the shear walls resisted the most force – 520.44 Newtons. The structural system with the diagonal bracing resisted 249.10 Newtons. The structural system, with the “K” bracing, resisted 382.55 Newtons.<br><br>The experiment supported the hypotheses. The larger quantity of material in the sheer walls provided the strength needed to increase the load resistance. In addition to the amount of material, the joints between the shear walls and the structure had a greater surface area creating the strongest connections. These components made for a stronger structure.

OPTIMIZATION OF CARBON NANOTUBE-BASED CFX PRIMARY BATTERY PERFORMANCE: ROLE OF FLUORINATION
Richard Nipun Gunasena
duPont Manual Magnet High School, Louisville, KY

The recent development of Li-CFx (Lithium Carbon Monofluoride) batteries with Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotube (MWCNT) cathode material greatly improved the existing technology. Through the course of this experimentation it was tested to see if a specific intermediate degree of fluorination of MWCNTs produces an optimum energy capacity for Li-CFx batteries. The production process for CFx electrodes encompasses the use of Carbon Monofluoride, fully fluorinated carbon, which greatly disrupts the crystalline structure and limits available binding sites for the lithium ions. The preliminary hypothesis stated an intermediate degree of fluorination will increase the energy capacity of Li-CFx since an intermediate fluorination provides more sites for the Lithium ions increasing the energy capacity. In order to conduct the experiment’s fluorination process of MWCNTs a split ring, capacitivly coupled, RF plasma system (13.57 MHz, Max. power of 600W) with CF4 gas was used. Then two batteries one primary, one secondary, were assembled in an Argon filled Glove Box with lithium metal and CFx cathode and anode material with O.5M LiBF4 in PC:DME (1:1) as a electrolyte. Then the assembled batteries were connected to an ArbinTM Battery Cycler. The cycler data depicted primary batteries as having an optimum energy capacity at full fluorination unsupporting the hypothesis, while secondary batteries depicted an optimum energy capacity at 2 hours of fluorination therefore supporting the hypothesis. Full fluorination provided enough sites for one discharge therefore increasing the energy capacity of primary batteries. But for secondary batteries undergoing charge/discharge cycles lithium intercalation occurred further limiting the available binding sites therefore decreasing the energy capacity.

THE ULTIMATE DELIVERY PACKAGE: IMPLEMENTING COMPOSITE HYDROGELS FOR USE IN CELL AND DRUG DELIVERY APPLICATIONS
Japbani Nanda
Walter Tresper Clarke High School, Westbury, NY

In the world of biomaterials, hydrogels such as Pluronic F127 have come to be known as potential candidates for use in the field of medicine. Regenerative medicine and drug delivery can both benefit from these hydrogels. In this study, the properties of Pluronic F127 (PF127) were enhanced using natural hyaluronic acid (HA) and gelatin to aid in the creation of successful cell and drug delivery systems. Using green fluorescent protein-labeled adult human dermal fibroblasts, a three-dimensional cell delivery system was created through cell encapsulation. It was found that cells prefer stiffer gels and gelatin is necessary for cell survival in PF127 gels (p = 3.14 x 10^-5). Also, a novel agarose cap that helped prolong the use of the gel during encapsulation studies was independently designed and utilized. Drug delivery was studied using HA-PF127 hydrogels of optimal strength at the ratio of 1:80 HA to PF127. Through encapsulation of salicylic acid (SA) and methylene blue (MB) dye in the hydrogels and UV-Visible Spectrophotometry, it was found that the concentration of SA and MB dye in samples taken for drug release analysis increased logarithmically with time. Higher initial concentrations of SA led to a faster rate of release. MB mimicked the release kinetics of SA through both the increasingly blue hue of the samples with time and absorption studies using UV-Visible Spectrophotometry. These studies highlight the successful utilization of these composite hydrogels for multiple purposes in medicine and a multitude of other areas.

NANOSCALE PATTERNED COATING OF PLLA FOR USE WITH SOFT TISSUE IMPLANTS
Joshua David Bocarsly
The Lawrenceville School, Lawrenceville, NJ

The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a commonly injured ligament that does not heal well on its own. To date, there is no good solution to an ACL rupture; however, polymer resorbable scaffold artificial tendon and ligament replacements are in development to greatly decrease healing time, pain, rehabilitation time and reinjury risk associated with serious soft tissue injuries. These devices are typically made of poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA) or another similar biodegradable polymer, and as a result the body does not integrate well with a lot of mechanically unsuitable scar tissue is formed when they are used in vivo. I redeveloped a method for coating hard, robust materials with bisphosphonate monolayers to work on mechanically fragile, low working temperature polymers like PLLA. I also significantly decreased the cost of the process and the time it takes to complete. Bisphosphonate monolayers have been shown to improve tissue integration with biomedical devices in vivo, so this is a promising step towards the realization of effective soft tissue implants. Furthermore, I demonstrated that this cell-friendly coating can chemically induce spatially controlled fibroblast spreading on a surface. Specifically, stripes of this bisphosphonate coating ranging in width from 5 microns to 150 microns induce cell elongation in the direction of the pattern either within the stripes (for thicker stripes) or on top of the stripes (for thinner stripes). Furthermore, actin stress fibers within the elongated stripes are aligned with the stripes. This is a promising result, suggesting that such coatings on the surfaces of artificial tendons and ligaments may be the key to regenerating healthy soft-tissue (organized collagen rather than randomly deposited collagen, which is scar tissue).

STUDYING BONE MATRIX FORMATION VIA BIOENGINEERING APPROACH
Karan Babbarwal
duPont Manual Magnet High School, Louisville, KY

Bone injury has been a major issue affecting the population with more than 900,000 yearly cases in the United States alone. While the body is able to regenerate bone tissue effectively in young, healthy individuals, the process is dramatically deterred and even inhibited as individuals grow older. The senior population is constantly faced with bone related injuries and diseases that can shorten lifespan and disturb the quality of life. 60% of bone injuries seniors face are located at the hip, which various studies have shown can drastically reduce an individual’s physiological condition. The purpose of this project was to create an in vitro platform that could be used for bone studies. This novel platform would allow for the discovery and optimization of regenerative pathways as well as assist in the formation of drugs targeting the skeletal system, with an approach focused upon efficiency and cost effectiveness. After the platform was successfully created, its validity was tested through an experiment observing the adaptability of differentiated osteoblasts. It was hypnotized that these bone cells would be able to adapt to increased amount of stress and produce an equivalent amount of bone matrix when compared to control (no stress), as previously shown by accredited studies. The hypothesis was support by observing the corrected total cell florescence and through the t-test which showed no significant difference between the control pressure and the experimental pressure (p-value of 0.3801.) In conclusion, the bone study model was validated and further studies are being conducted studying the effects of mechanical pressure on bone growth. The model is also being prepared for R&D usage.

APIUM GRAVEOLENS AS NATURAL COOLANT
Jose Arnaldo Carbo
Colegio Maria Auxiliadora, Carolina, PUERTO RICO

The purpose of this research is to prove that celery extract acts as natural coolant for automobiles. This idea came from reading that commercial coolants have components that are harmful to the skin and pollute the environment. Since its components are not of the best quality, it affects the engine of the car causing mechanical damage. For this research, a comparison of commercial coolant versus natural coolant (celery as base) was done. The celery solution was filtered and poured into 3.8 liters containers. At the laboratory, freezing and boiling point tests were measured. Afterwards, a real life test in a vehicle engine using the celery aqueous coolant was done. First, the old coolant in the engine was drained; the radiator flushed with water and dried with compressed air. The radiator was filled with 6.8 liters of celery coolant for the first test. A scanner was connected to the engine and the car started. Temperatures were recorded every two minutes from the fourth to the twelve. The engine was run to 2.500 revolutions and temperatures recorded every minute from the first to the third. After deceleration, temperatures were recorded every two minutes from the fourth to the twelve. The engine was turned off to cool down. This whole process was repeated using celery coolant prepared with methanol and commercial coolant. The results showed that natural aqueous coolant can be used in motor vehicle engines, it is eco-friendly and non toxic. Calculations were made to prove the cost-effectiveness of natural coolant.

A LIFE-SAVING DESIGN IN AUTOMOBILES - THE PLANAR ENGINE

Car manufacturers always claim that their cars are safe. However, the number of deaths or severe injuries in traffic accidents remains over 100,000 a year in the US. Usually, the bulky and incompressible engines, which are installed inside the crumple zones in front of the compartments push towards the drivers during the accidents. The drivers will be injured and clamped between the engines and the seats.<br><br> <br><br>The problem can be solved by installing the internal combustion engines inside the chassis. During frontal collisions, the crumple zones can be efficiently compressed, increasing the time of impact and reducing the force added on the passengers. By removing the rigid engines from the crumple zones in front of the compartment, the problem of secondary trajection can also be solved. To be installed inside the chassis, the engine must be very thin.<br><br> <br><br>The project investigated the feasibility of reducing the thickness of the engines by considering the dimensions of their internal parts. The maximum thickness of the newly designed engine is about 5 inches. A model of the Planar Engine was developed to demonstrate its operation.<br><br> <br><br>Apart from safety, stability of the car also increases because the center of gravity is shifted to a lower position at the center of the car and spare power supply is provided by two separate crankshafts. Flexibility is enhanced since more room is left in the compartments and in the crumple zones. The size of the crumple zones can be reduced because their effectiveness is greatly increased.

INTELLIGENT CONTROL OF DOOR MIRRORS THROUGH BLIND SPOT MONITORING
Gabriel Artur Mineiro
Escola Técnica Estadual Monteiro Lobato, Taquara - RS, Brazil

The number of accidents motivated involuntarily in great urban centers and roads come increasing of preoccupying form. Many of these accidents that happen, mainly in the urban centers, involve cars and motorcycles. Such statistics generally are consequences of the attention lack of the drivers, that when moving of displacement track does not see the presence of one another vehicle located in the region of blind spot of the driver. This region is produced between the angle of vision of the driver and the vehicles’ mirrors. This research has the objective to develop a system composed of electronic sensors, electronic controls for the door-mirrors and visual and sonorous alerts that offer a bigger safety to the driver of the vehicle when he is taking the decision to move of track. For the execution of this research initially bibliographical research had been made, simulation of the studied circuits and assays in laboratory for later implementation of the prototype. With the results of the tests made in the final prototype the perfect functioning of exactly can be observed since, with the positioning of the new angle of the mirror is possible to see the region of the blind spot better and what it has in inserted of fast form and the insurance besides have a low cost for acquisition and rank, proving the initial expectations of the project and showing that the use of this system can work together for the reduction of involuntary accidents for the blind spot.

Long-term allograft survival in transplantation has been relatively unchanged for 25 years. One reason is the lack of systems-biology-level pathway analysis to identify rejection injury mechanisms, as existing analysis methods are limited in analyzing such complex processes because they cannot account for interactions between signaling pathways that cause rejection.<br><br>To analyze rejection at a systems-biology-level, I developed a novel pathway analysis method – inter-pathway impact factor (IPIF) analysis – that accounts for inter-pathway interactions. Using this method, I analyzed renal transplant biopsy data. Comparison of my method with three existing ones showed that my method has the highest statistical power and identifies the most biologically relevant pathways. I identified novel p38-, IL12-, and IL23-mediated signaling pathways and validated them in independent kidney and lung datasets. Identifying these pathways allowed for proposal of a novel rejection model that incorporates monocytes and aforementioned cytokines. This model was validated statistically by gene deconvolution in whole blood taken at time of rejection, suggesting that identified pathways are causal as well as significant. I identified an existing drug to inhibit IPIF-predicted pathways and hypothesized that the drug would reduce graft inflammation. This was validated in mouse model, in which the drug reduced graft infiltration more effectively than current standard of care Cyclosporine.<br><br>In sum, I developed a highly relevant, powerful method that can globally analyze existing genomics data from diverse conditions such as rejection, identify injury pathways, and generate easily testable hypotheses. I used it to propose time-specific rejection mechanisms and novel treatment for long-term rejection.

AN ADVANCED BIOMIMETIC HAND USING ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING
Holly Catherine Erickson
Los Alamos High School, Los Alamos, NM

Current prosthetic limbs are primarily comprised of mechanical parts and gears using traditional subtractive machining and manufacturing. As a result, mobility and many basic functions are limited. Current prosthetic limbs take substantial time to make, are very limited in flexability, and are mostly hand-made. However, if methods could be developed to create a prosthetic hand using additive manufacturing, the field of biomimetics could be radically transformed. By replicating key aspects of the human hand such as bones, tendons, nerves, skin, etc., there would be no need for traditional mechanical parts, allowing for greater range of motion, function, and appearance. Additive manufacturing is a new and upcoming field. Therefore, development of a modified 3D printer that would directly print all of the different materials required for building biomimetic hands could revolutionize the development of custom prosthetics. Using 3D scanning technology, measurements could be taken for a certain person and could be rapidly programmed into the printer, allowing the prosthetic device to be made in just a couple of hours. This new technology for a biomimetic prosthetics could be used in war zones, third world countries, and even local hospitals. Although this use of additive manufacturing is looked at through the perspective of biomimetics, there is virtually no limit to the applications of this new technology.

A NEW FRONTIER IN BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING: EX-SITU BIOENGINEERING OF HEPATO- & NEURO- CELLOIDOSOMES®
Samantha Marie Marquez
Maggie L. Walker Governor's School for Government and International Studies, Richmond, VA

The new field of bioengineering is based on the application of methods from mathematics and physics to solve problems in life sciences using engineering's own analytical methodologies. While traditional engineering applies these fields to the design and manufacture of inanimate structures, bioengineering uses the same sciences to study many aspects of living organisms. Two years ago, we pioneered a cell-architecture process for the design of core/shell multicellular structures based on a "bottom-up strategy." This unique 3D organized cell structure is, by definition, a "living capsule" with a biomembrane/tissue shell and a core that acts as container or reservoir. We call it: Celloidosomes®. Currently, we are exploring applications in the field of regenerative medicine toward two major targets: The Ex-situ Bioengineering of artificial Liver micro-glands: HepatoCelloidosomes (HC) for liver repair/reconstruction and, The Ex-situ Bioengineering of neural-networks: NeuroCelloidosomes (NC) for the repair of degenerated neural tissue/transplantation. Our process is based on the cell-self-assembly on Liquid-Liquid, Liquid-Gel, and/or Liquid-Gas interfaces by using capillary microfluidic technologies to design complex emulsions. HC was designed using Hepatocyte Cells (HEP-G2) as a core/gel, and Fibroblast cells (NIH-3T3) as a shell. This new bioartificial gland could be used for the engineering of in-vitro liver tissues. We were able to optimize/tune the metabolic secretion of proteins such as Albumin by controlling the core-shell structure. NC was fabricated with the use of Neural-Cortical cells’ self-assembly on gels/bubbles. We demonstrated the NC's viability and ability to form neural networks in-vitro. This revolutionary concept has not been reported before.

AN ADVANCED BIOMIMETIC HAND USING ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING
Holly Catherine Erickson
Los Alamos High School, Los Alamos, NM

Current prosthetic limbs are primarily comprised of mechanical parts and gears using traditional subtractive machining and manufacturing. As a result, mobility and many basic functions are limited. Current prosthetic limbs take substantial time to make, are very limited in flexability, and are mostly hand-made. However, if methods could be developed to create a prosthetic hand using additive manufacturing, the field of biomimetics could be radically transformed. By replicating key aspects of the human hand such as bones, tendons, nerves, skin, etc., there would be no need for traditional mechanical parts, allowing for greater range of motion, function, and appearance. Additive manufacturing is a new and upcoming field. Therefore, development of a modified 3D printer that would directly print all of the different materials required for building biomimetic hands could revolutionize the development of custom prosthetics. Using 3D scanning technology, measurements could be taken for a certain person and could be rapidly programmed into the printer, allowing the prosthetic device to be made in just a couple of hours. This new technology for a biomimetic prosthetics could be used in war zones, third world countries, and even local hospitals. Although this use of additive manufacturing is looked at through the perspective of biomimetics, there is virtually no limit to the applications of this new technology.

CONSTRUCTION AND UTILIZATION OF A TWO-SPACE MECHANICAL LUNG MODEL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF AIRWAY RESISTANCE IN INFANTS WITH PULMONARY DISEASES
Veena Iyengar
Bellarmine Preparatory School, Tacoma, WA

Monitoring lung mechanics of infants with pulmonary diseases can provide useful information to clinicians selecting mechanical ventilator settings and titrating drug dosages of bronchodilators. The objective of this study is to determine the viability of the “curve peeling” method to estimate the lung mechanics parameters of a two-space lung model. A mechanical lung model simulating the lung mechanics of an infant with severe Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia was constructed. A high speed video camera displayed the existence of pendelluft during mechanical ventilation in this lung model. Passive exhalation flow-volume curves were generated and analyzed using “curve peeling” technique. Lung compliances and airway resistances were also determined independently for comparisons. Differences existed between parameters of lung mechanics determined using “curve peeling” and the independent measures of compliance and resistance. The results showed that the time constants of the two-space lung model must differ by at least 3 orders of magnitude before that “curve peeling” method provides measurable results. Also, there was remarkable evidence of a dependence of the “fast space” on the “slow space” during passive exhalation. Additional studies are needed to refine the mathematical models applied to the lung during passive exhalation to obtain more accurate results when using the “curve peeling” technique.

SYNTHESIS, CHARACTERIZATION, AND BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION OF A NOVEL BIOMATERIAL FOR POST-LUMPECTOMY BREAST RECONSTRUCTION
Shyam Venkateswaran
Herricks Senior High School, New Hyde Park, NY

Reconstructive surgeons are seeking safe, viable, and cost-effective biomaterials for post-lumpectomy breast reconstruction. In a lumpectomy, only the tumor-containing portion of the breast is removed. Pluronic® copolymers, containing poly[propylene oxide] (PPO) blocks flanked between two sets of poly[ethylene oxide] (PEO) blocks, can form thermo-reversible hydrogels and may serve as space-filling and bioabsorbable scaffolds; however, they possess poor mechanical strength and limited stability.<br><br> Pluronic F-87, PEO61PPO40PEO61, was diacrylated through an end-modification reaction with acryloyl chloride (DAF-87). 1H NMR spectroscopy confirmed 80% modification. Hydrogels (30% w/v DAF-87, 70% phosphate buffered solution, 0.05% w/v photo-initiator Irgacure 2959) were UV photo-cross-linked. Viscosity testing confirmed the success of the chemical cross-linking reaction. Oscillatory rheology tests were performed on samples with various cross-linking densities and a hydrogel with a storage modulus similar to that of adipose tissue was obtained. To test mechanical stability, cross-linked and uncross-linked hydrogels were swollen in ionic solution. Cross-linked hydrogels were intact for three weeks, whereas uncross-linked hydrogels degraded within hours, exhibiting promise for reconstruction of the breast. Biological evaluation, testing mouse 3T3-L1 pre-adipose cell viability and cell growth, revealed that DAF-87 hydrogels were not cytotoxic and promoted cell viability and growth, with an intact hydrogel, through the MTS assay. A novel biomaterial was successfully engineered for applications in space-filling reconstruction of various body cavities and tissue engineering.

OPTIMIZATION OF PLATLET-TARGETED MULTIFUNCTIONAL NANOVEHICLES FOR VASCULAR DISEASE DETECTION AND THERAPY
Gurbani Kaur
Hathaway Brown School, Shaker Heights, OH

Vascular thrombo-occlusion is the major pathologic event in vascular diseases. Current therapies focus on rapid thrombolysis by intra-vascular administration of clot-dissolving drugs. However, this leads to short plasma half-life, insufficient drug concentration at the clot site, and non-specific drug action elsewhere causing hemorrhagic side-effects. This research sought to overcome these problems by designing a nanoparticle delivery platform that encapsulates the drug to increase its half-life and binds specifically to clot-associated activated platelets for site-selective drug release and therapy. I designed a liposomal nanovehicle surface-modified with two peptides (GRGDSP and DAEWVDVS) for dual receptor (integrin GPIIb-IIIa and P-selectin) targeting on clot-associated platelets. The interaction between peptide-decorated liposomes and platelets was studied in a parallel-plate flow chamber by fluorescence microscopy. The effect of varying the relative peptide ratios at constant total peptide density was studied to optimize the peptide decoration for maximizing platelet-binding ability. The results establish that multi-targeted liposomes bind and stay retained on platelets significantly more than mono-targeted ones (p<0.05, N=10, Student’s t-test). Maximum platelet-binding was noted at 60 GRGDSP: 40 DAEWVDVS decoration. Liposomes decorated with this ratio also demonstrated greatest retention of 95% in middle and 92% in high shear-stress conditions at the conclusion of the 15 minute retention period. These results suggest potential applications of such liposomes in targeted delivery of imaging probes and drugs to vascular disease sites for enhanced detection and therapy.

GREEN ENERGY: SYNTHESIS, CHARACTERIZATION AND SOLAR CELL APPLICATION OF ZINC-OXIDE NANO-STRUCTURES
Swetha Vanathy Shutthanandan
Richland High School, Richland, WA

The dye sensitized nanoparticle solar cell (DSNSC) is one of the new types of solar technology that converts solar energy into electrical energy. Titanium dioxide is the typical nano material used in DSNSC. However, because of its very low electron mobility, TiO2 based solar cell suffer from electron recombination effects at the cell which reduces the overall efficiency. As such, scientists have been trying to discover new materials to overcome this issue. Zinc Oxide based nanostructures have shown some promising effects in this direction. In this work, several different nanostructures of ZnO were synthesized using “self-catalytic assisted Vapor-Liquid-Solid” growth process. Different types of nanostructures such as wires, rods, flowers, and sheets were formed on the substrates depending on their location in the synthesis glass tube. These nanostructures were first synthesized on silicon substrates to understand the growth behavior. These nanostructures were characterized by using X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy for surface composition, Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry for bulk composition and porosity, and Helium Ion Microscopy for morphology/structure. Once the optimum deposition condition was obtained, these nanostructures were deposited on a conductive tin oxide glass slide to use in the DSNSC as a main electrode. Four different DSNSC were fabricated using these nanostructures. For comparison purposes, two additional DSNSC were fabricated using commercially available ZnO and TiO2 nanoparticles. The I-V characteristics of these cells were obtained for three different lighting conditions (sunny day, cloudy day and inside). DSNSC fabricated from nano-wires showed the largest efficiency, while the cell synthesized from nano-flower showed the least efficiency.

SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF SOLID LIPID NANOPARTICLES AS A TRANS-BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER VEHICLE
Xunyi Wang
Davis Senior High School, Davis, CA

In recent years, rapid advances have been made in the areas of new imaging particles and novel therapeutic agents targeted towards cells inside the brain. However, delivery of these imaging probes/drugs into the brain has been a great challenge due to the blood brain barrier (BBB). The purpose of this project is to develop a nanocarrier capable of delivering these compounds across the BBB. Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (SLNs) are an excellent choice for this objective because their biocompatibility and their reported success in crossing the BBB. Unlike polymeric particles which can often contain toxic monomers and residual traces of organic solvents, Solid Lipid Nanoparticles are an ideal choice due to the biodegradability of their components and the avoidance of organic solvents during their synthesis. In this experiment, SLNs were prepared through the microemulsion method as described by Peira et al.[1] Herein, SLNs sizes were optimized to an ideal size range and stealth characteristics were achieved through a polysorbates coating, both of which according to previous literature also has a positive effect in the uptake of Solid Lipid Nanoparticles across the Blood Brain Barrier and prolong blood circulation time by evading the reticuloendothelial system.[2] The SLNs size and shape were characterized by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Particle stability of Solid Lipid Nanoparticles with polysorbates-80 coating were demonstrated when the sizes of the Solid Lipid Nanoparticles remained within the ideal range after lyophilization.

ENGINEERING A NOVEL HYDROGEL MATRIX FOR BONE CELL REGENERATION
Sneha Subramaniam
Westborough High School, Westborough, MA

Current techniques for bone regeneration are invasive, expensive, and pose risks of infection and foreign bone rejection. Thus, the goal of this project was to develop a low-cost, low-risk method to promote and support localized human bone regeneration.<br><br> The effect of using a microbial transglutaminase (mTG) crosslinked gelatin hydrogel as a scaffold in human dental pulp stem cell (DPSC) differentiation for bone regeneration was studied. Different concentrations of mTG were crosslinked with gelatin to create soft, medium and hard substrates. DPSCs were cultured and differentiated on the substrates for 7, 14 and 21 days with and without the chemical induction medium dexamethasone. Scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive x-ray analysis after 21 days indicated that the cells produced biomineralized deposits on the scaffold irrespective of chemical induction and gel stiffness. The biomineralized deposits were found to have high concentrations of calcium and phosphate and quantitative real time PCR assays indicated that cells, which were expressing osteocalcin and alkaline phosphotase, were in fact differentiating into osteoblasts and not dentin. Further experimentation showed that the hydrogel was capable of promoting biomineralization without direct interaction with stem cells.<br><br> Thus, the hydrogel has the potential as an injection, to promote bone growth in patients with osteoporosis or small bone fractures. This was demonstrated when the hydrogel was implanted in a tooth crack and biomineralization was observed within 3 days. Future work requires the investigation of the chemical properties of the mTG gelatin scaffold to understand the cause of biomineralization.

DISCOVERING THE EFFECTS OF COATED FE3O4@TIO2 NANOPARTICLES ON DNA CLEAVAGE
Justin Howard Boganey
Chicago High School for Agricultural Sciences, Chicago, IL

Conventional cancer therapeutic processes may be deleterious to the human body. Titanium dioxide nanoparticles, however, possess particular properties that may give rise to a potentially safer therapeutic alternative. Titanium dioxide nanoparticles are capable of cleaving DNA. The effects of coated Fe3O4-TiO2 nanoparticles on DNA cleavage was observed. Solutions consisting of DNA fragments possessing the E6 gene were exposed to bare, Alizarin Red S (ARS)-coated, and ARS-DNA-coated nanoparticles within sodium phosphate buffer. Half of each solution was illuminated, while the other half was isolated from light exposure. These samples were run on an agarose gel to determine the extent of DNA cleavage. Samples containing the ARS-DNA coated nanoparticles exhibited the most DNA cleavage, and samples that were illuminated exhibited more DNA cleavage than their non-illuminated counterparts. Illumination and ARS-coating act together as catalysts of nanoparticle DNA cleavage. Further studies of Fe3O4@TiO2 nanoparticles should be done to contribute to the development of a non-deleterious therapeutic alternative to conventional cancer treatment.

REGULATORY SIGNATURES OF CANCER CELL LINES INFERRED FROM GENE EXPRESSION DATA
Jayanth Krishnan
Mahopac High School, Mahopac, NY

Gene expression data describing mRNA levels in cancer cells lines is available. However, molecular regulatory mechanisms responsible for these changes are poorly understood. I developed a rationale approach to infer regulatory mechanisms governing changes in gene expression by integrating data sets of protein/DNA interactions, protein-protein interactions and kinase-substrate interactions collected from prior studies. <br><br>I first utilize data obtained from genome-wide ChIP-X experiments to connect aberrant mRNA expression levels of the NCI-60 cancer cell lines to the transcription factors most likely regulating them. Transcription factors are then "connected," using known protein-protein interactions, to form cancer specific sub-networks. Within these sub-networks I assess the enrichment for kinase substrates to infer the kinases regulating the complexes. By implementing hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis on data obtained for the regulatory mechanisms, I identify groups of signatures associated with certain cancer families. Following the path, from gene expression to transcription factors to kinases, I provide greater understanding of the regulatory cell signaling mechanisms behind the observed changes in mRNA levels in the NCI-60 cancer cell lines. By comparing regulatory signatures and by conducting a quantitative analysis between the dis-regulated genes and the genes associated with FDA approved drugs, drugs are inferred for each cancer.

CAROTENOIDS FOR A CURE: ZEAXANTHIN PRODUCTION BY THE HYDROXYLASE ENZYME OF CHLAMYDOMONAS REINHARDTII
Erin Elizabeth Hollander
Cedar Shoals High School, Athens, GA

Age-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of irreversible blindness among elderly in the developed world. Multiple studies have linked the decrease of blood plasma zeaxanthin to a significantly increased risk of AMD. The insufficient consumption of zeaxanthin by Americans could be remedied if a major food product was transformed to produce zeaxanthin. <br><br> In this project, the hydroxylase enzyme of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was extracted to determine the efficiency at which the enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of zeaxanthin from beta-carotene. RNA was first extracted and used in reverse transcription to make cDNA. PCR was accomplished using a titanium taq polymerase. The two segments of the hydroxylase enzyme, KpnI-XhoI and XhoI-XhoI, were extracted from a gel electrophoresis of the PCR. The KpnI-XhoI segment was ligated into pBluescript plasmids and used to transform Escherichia coli. The resulting colonies were screened to determine which had incorporated the recombinant plasmid, and the successful colonies were grown. The XhoI-XhoI segment was then ligated into plasmids extracted from the successful colonies and used to transform E. coli. A second colony screening revealed a colony with the completed plasmid incorporated. In the final E. coli transformation, both plasmids coding for the hydroxylase enzyme and plasmids coding for beta-carotene were used to transform E. coli. The carotenoids were extracted from successful colonies. Thin-layer chromatography revealed a distinct line of zeaxanthin, meaning the hydroxylase enzyme successfully catalyzed the synthesis of zeaxanthin and making the hydroxylase enzyme of C. reinhardtii a viable option for transformation of a major food product.

FINDING AN EFFICIENT METHOD TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF WILDFIRE WITH MINIMAL ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE CEASE FIRE; AN ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY METHOD TO CONTAIN WILDFIRE
Mary Elizabeth Cromwell
Good Hope School, Frederiksted, St. Croix, USVI

In 2005 alone there were 66, 552 reported wildland fires in the United States. While this number may be the lowest reported since 1960, the numbers of acres burned were among the highest, a total of 8,686,753 acres. This would indicate that the current methods used to extinguish wildfires are not effective. Because of this I attempted to find a more effective and environmentally friendly method to reduce the spread of wildfires. To do this, I ignited bundles of hay treated with the flame retardant materials Flame Stop I-DS and Flame Stop II, along with water and an untreated bundle. My results proved Flame Stop II to be the most effective fire retardant. It consistently extinguished the flame with minimal smoke in a shorter time-frame than the other materials. Flame Stop I-DS also proved to be an efficient fire retardant; however, it took longer to extinguish the flames than Flame Stop II, and generated larger amounts of smoke. As a further study I would suggest using other organic materials, packing them into bundles, treating them with Flame Stop II, and testing them with the same procedure used in this experiment. I would also suggest using larger bundles of hay, and placing them side by side to see if this increases their effectiveness as a barrier. <br><br>

PREDICTION OF TYROSINE SULFATION IN VIRAL GPCRS; SUBVERSION OF HOST RESPONSE BY VIRUSES
Nikhil Venkata Ragha Kotha
Mira Loma High School, Sacramento, CA

The binding of ligands to GPCRs on cell surfaces induces processes inside the cell. Viruses have vGPCRs, a subfamily of GPCRs that help viruses instead of normal cells. Tyrosine sulfation is a post-translational modification known to occur in only some GPCRs that increases their affinity to ligands. Recently, it has been hypothesized that tyrosine sulfation is likely to occur in vGPCRs, something that has never been explored before, and this is the basis for my research. I hypothesized that tyrosine sulfation is probable to occur in 3 vGPCRs – ECRF3 from Herpesvirus Saimiri (HVS), K2 from Swinepox Virus (SWPV), and Q2 from Sheeppox Virus (SPPV). This study utilizes various computational methods to predict the probability of a tyrosine residue being sulfated in the 3 vGPCRs. Using a position-specific scoring matrix, amino acid sequence alignment, and analyzing other characteristics of tyrosine sulfation, I found my hypothesis to be correct for all 3 vGPCRs. The implication of this result is that since tyrosine sulfation is likely to occur in these vGPCRs, their binding to ligands is being strengthened and therefore their viruses are being enhanced without our knowledge. Future applications of this study primarily include obtaining physical evidence of tyrosine sulfation in the 3 vGPCRs and then developing specific receptor-ligand antagonists to counteract the effects of tyrosine sulfation on the viruses.

SPEED BOOSTER SYSTEM FOR GLIDERS
KARAN SHARMA
APEEJAY SCHOOL, SHEIKH SARAI, NEW DELHI, INDIA

The purpose of this project was to develop a new speed booster system for gliders that uses energy of the flow of air to increase the speed of the glider. The underlying principle being the Equation of Continuity. <br><br>The booster system was integrated with the wing contour, so as not to hamper the aerodynamic structure of the glider. Two wooden glider models of same shape, size, weight and wingspan were used for the experiments. The gliders are made of light wood material and tapering plastic tube with open ends was fitted to the under surface of each of the wings of one of the glider model, to serve as a booster.Both the gliders were tested for flight capability and were allowed to fall freely from the same height. It was seen that the glider with booster system covered more distance. Further both the glider models were subjected to a jet of air from a blower. The angle of deviation from the normal was measured. Assuming the thread to be of unit length; the sine of the angle gave the lift and cosine of the angle gave the drag. This was repeated with different designs of the booster to identify the optimum shape that gives the maximum lift/drag ratio.The lift/drag ratio was found out to be more for glider with booster system and less for the glider without. We can conclude from these small-scale experiments that such systems if designed would be successful on life-scale machines. <br><br>

MICRO-MAGNETIC ROTOR PUMP FOR CONTROLLED FLUID TRANSPORT
Manjari Randeria
Upper Arlington High School, Columbus, OH

A mechanism for controlled fluid transport through a 15-μm wide channel, achieved with the assembly of a rotor pump and its exquisite control using external magnetic fields, is demonstrated in this project. The first step in fabrication of this device is etching a micro channel, using projection photolithography, onto a silicon chip with pre-patterned Permalloy microdisks and microcavities. Next, an aqueous solution containing 8.5-μm spherical magnetic rotors and nonmagnetic tracer particles is introduced into the channel. Joystick control of weak external magnetic fields allows for the manipulation of the spherical rotors along the patterned microdisks and into the microcavities, where the spherical rotor is held in a magnetic trap. The rotor is then spun using a time dependent external magnetic field that generates fluid flow through the micro channel. The fluid velocity is measured by tracking the tracer particles through the channel using digital image correlation techniques. The fluid velocity is found to increase linearly with the number of trapped spinning spherical rotors as well as with the frequency of the external magnetic field. The effectiveness of this novel design for transporting and trapping spherical magnetic rotors and the possibility of scaling down to submicron sizes has the potential for designing complex fluid networks for specialized lab-on-chip devices.

THE AIR CONDITIONER AND ITS USE IN A HOUSE
Ojel Luis Rodriguez
Colegio De La Salle, Bayamon, PUERTO RICO

The scarcity of water resources is a great worldwide problem. The main objective of this research was to know how much water can be extracted from an air conditioner machine and if that water can be recycled. Two air conditioners with capacity of 4KW and 8KW where used. A 1.9cm PVC pipe and a container were installed to each air conditioner in order to collect the water extracted from the air. The air conditioners were turn on for 10 hours during 15 consecutives days. Daily the amount of water generated were measure in liters. Both extracted 110L of water, but 8KW air conditioner extracted twice the amount of water generated by air conditioner 4 KW. This result tends to sustain the hypothesis that a greater capacity of the air conditioner will extract the large amount of water. The water collected in both systems was used in a drip irrigation system to be used in the landscape. The containers were installed to each air conditioner were perforated and connected to a faucet. The faucet was used to regulate the flow of water that irrigated the garden. A 6mm hose with seven auto regulated droppers was connected to the faucet in the container in order to irrigate a greater area simultaneously. This system can be an economical way of recycled water that prevents waste of the resource and also helps to save money in the water bill.

USE OF SPRAY ADHESIVES FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF 3-D CAPILLARY ORIGAMI MICROSTRUCTURES
Mithi Alexa de los Reyes
North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, Durham, NC

In the past, the field of microengineering has been limited to largely two-dimensional wafer techniques, such as etching and lithography. The method of “capillary origami”—using the surface tension of an evaporating water droplet to fold a flexible membrane into a three-dimensional polyhedron—has shown promise as a way to create fully 3-D microstructures. However, the membrane re-opens past a critical evaporation point, and previous attempts to prevent this re-opening have proven to be expensive and time-consuming. We therefore investigated the use of various spray adhesives in keeping these origami microstructures closed. Three characteristics were measured: efficiency, tackiness, and strength of the adhesive. Measurements of these parameters point to 3M™ Super 77™ Spray Adhesive as an optimal adhesive for spraying microstructures. Furthermore, we designed a new method to calculate adhesive strength by using an analytical balance to measure force applied by a micrometer to a microstructure. We also developed procedures to create uniformly-sized microstructures and to accelerate the folding process. These novel procedures, combined with the measurements that indicate 3M™ Super 77™ as an optimum adhesive, suggest a potential method for the mass-production of truly 3-D microstructures.

3D SILHOUETTE LASER SCANNING: THE DIGITAL RECONSTRUCTION OF REAL-WORLD OBJECTS INTO POINT CLOUDS
Brandon Lee Reavis
Cody High School, Cody WY, USA

The engineering goal of this project was to develop a three dimensional scanner that uses concepts similar to those used by silhouette methods of 3D scanning, but does not have standard silhouette scanning’s limitation of only being able to recognize the outermost contour of the object. A secondary goal was to keep it cost efficient unlike the 3D scanners in existence today, by producing it for approximately $400. <br><br> It uses two laser line-generating diodes to illuminate a narrow region of an object in a dark environment. This contour is then captured by a webcam that is placed in a position where the beams of the lasers are perpendicular to the direction in which the camera is pointing. Then the object rotates and the lasers move to different positions, making new contours visible to the camera. This process continues, until finally, the computer processes all of the bitmaps from the camera and constructs a 3D point cloud. The position of each 3D point is determined by the laser’s position, the object’s rotation at the time of the photo, and the position of the red pixel in the processed image.<br><br> With the C# language, I developed an original application to control the scanner with the parallel port and take pictures of the object’s contours using WIA (Windows Image Acquisition). After the scanning process is completed, it displays the scanned object as a point cloud with DirectX9, enabling the user to rotate the virtual object in three dimensions to illustrate the object’s geometry.

SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF COMPOSITE PLASTICS FROM THERMOPLASTIC STARCH AND NANO-SIZED CALCIUM PHOSPHATE FOR FILM PACKAGING
Miguel Arnold Silverio Reyes
Philippine Science High School- Main Campus, Quezon City, Metro Manila, PHILIPPINES

Thermoplastic starch (TPS) is a cheap and biodegradable starch-based plastic which exhibits poor mechanical properties. The project aims to use nano-sized calcium phosphate as filler for thermoplastic starch to improve these properties and produce a composite plastic which can substitute for commercial film plastics such as low-density polyethylene (LDPE). <br><br> Calcium phosphates were produced from the precipitation of calcium nitrate-tetrahydrate (Ca(NO3)2•4H2O) and phosphoric acid (H3PO4). The calcium phosphates were subjected to microwave irradiation for 15 minutes to form nanoparticles. TPS was produced by mixing 65% cornstarch, 22% glycerol and 13% distilled water by mass. The nanoparticles were co-extruded and molded with TPS at ratios of 0%, 1%, 5% and 10% by mass. Tensile strength, elongation percentage and water absorption of the composite plastics were tested in three replicates. <br><br> The trend between the composite’s tensile strength and water absorption versus increase in percentage calcium phosphate follow a geometric progression, showing that at 5% nano-sized calcium phosphate, the composite achieves its optimum properties. T-tests, at 5% level of significance, showed that there is a significant improvement over the tensile strength, elongation percentage and water absorption of the 5% composite compared to pure TPS but there is still a significant difference between the properties of the 5% composite and LDPE.<br><br> The study showed that nano-sized calcium phosphate as filler for TPS yields a composite plastic with improved mechanical properties compared to pure TPS. Having biodegradable plastics with improved mechanical properties will encourage the use of such materials over non-biodegradable petroleum plastics.

A ROBUST HUMAN FALL DETECTION WIRELESS SYSTEM
Nathaniel G. Varghese
Folsom High School, Folsom, CA

Motivation: One third of people over age 65 in USA fall every year; the average healthcare cost due to fall related injuries is ~$20,000 per year per person. In many falls, timely help is more critical than the damage due to the fall itself. Automatic fall detection and alerts can help provide immediate response which can avoid long term medical conditions for elderly people. <br><br>Goals: My project is a system designed to automatically detect a human fall and wirelessly send an alert to a remote monitoring station. It improves existing solutions in this domain by the automatic nature of the fall detection, improving the robustness of the solution through a unique algorithm that reduces false alerts and making the system wireless.<br><br>Hypothesis: I can improve the robustness of fall detection by implementing a 4-step algorithm that follows the physics of a human fall<br><br>Method/Materials: The system consists of two modules - a local Fall Detection Module and a Remote Monitoring module. Both are built based on the Arduino Uno platform. A 3-axis accelerometer is used for sensing the fall and XBee radios are used for wireless communication. LEDs are used to visually indicate the occurrence of various alert conditions. The main algorithm for fall detection involves detecting the four stages of a natural human fall by sensing the acceleration changes that occur. This algorithm is coded in the fall detection Arduino system. Many false and true fall conditions are tested by me doing reals fall tests onto a mattress with the device strapped to my body. Various hardware parameters are tuned for making system more robust. <br><br>Results: The system was built successfully and tested under various fall conditions and the results validated the hypothesis

EFFECTS OF POLYCAPROLACTONE AND UV TREATED POLY (METHYL METHACRYLATE) ELECTROSPUN FIBERS ON OSTEOGENIC DIFFERENTIATION OF DENTAL PULP STEM CELLS
Manita Singh
Canyon Crest Academy, San Diego, CA

The use of polymers to construct sustainable 3D biomimetic scaffolds resembling the extracellular matrix (ECM) possesses great potential in tissue engineering. Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) can be plated onto scaffolds and induced either chemically (through the use of dexamethasone) or morphologically to differentiate into precursors of bone. This study investigates the effects of Polycaprolactone (PCL) electrospun fibers and UV treated Poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) electrospun fibers on DPSC differentiation and biomineralization. The polymers PMMA and PCL were chosen due to their intrinsic rigidity, abundant availability, and biocompatibility, in addition to their low toxicity and minimal eco- cost. PMMA scaffolds were subjected to UV plasma treatment to increase the hydrophilicity of the scaffold, while the intrinsic hydrophilic properties of PCL did not warrant modification.<br><br>Confocal microscopy images of both polymer scaffolds show the cells’ actin cytoskeleton adhering to the fibers, and analysis of vinculin-stained focal adhesion sites collectively signify the success of UV plasma treatment to create adhesive PMMA scaffolds. This modification allows for the creation of more focal adhesion sites, which is a crucial factor in stimulating osteogenic expression. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and mercury lamp images indicate that PMMA nanofibers and PCL fibers of random orientation were the most successful scaffolds to induce DPSC differentiation. This study has identified the optimal PMMA and PCL scaffold characteristics for the morphological induction of DPSC differentiation into osteoblasts without the aid of a chemical inducer.

SIMPLIFYING SODIS: REDUCTION OF UV-IMPEDING TURBIDITY THROUGH MACROSCOPIC FILTRATION
Sarah Joyce Flaherty
Westdale Secondary School, Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA

This project facilitated the application of SODIS (solar water disinfection) by reducing the turbidity of water to less than or equal to 30 NTU. A simple filter of readily available material was designed to remove macroscopic contaminants to enable effective SODIS in varied settings.<br><br>The preliminary design consisted of a square of common clothing fabric secured over the mouth of a PET (polyethylene terephthalate) water bottle using a threaded water bottle cap with the center removed. Water was filtered as the bottle filled. This was intended to simplify the SODIS process by eliminating the flocculation, sedimentation or mass filtration process which is currently used to reduce turbidity.<br><br>The turbidity of various synthesized mixtures of water and commercial plant mix was measured using a turbidity tube. These mesurements were compared to turbidity levels post-filtration.<br><br>Based on the results of this testing the design was revised. The improved design consists of an uncapped plastic collection bottle filled with unfiltered water, and then capped with a modified cap and at least two layers of fabric (cotton and polyester fabrics were sucessful in testing). The unfiltered water is transferred into an open PET bottle through the filter cap, if necessary by compressing the plastic collecting bottle, and then is capped. <br><br>The improved design shows promising results when filtering both synthesized mixtures and water samples from the field, consistently reducing turbidity to less than or equal to 30 NTU. The design could progress to further field trials where it may prove a valuable tool for providing potable water in a practical, economical, and environmentally responsible manner.

THE EFFECT OF CHEMICAL CROSSLINKING ON THE STRUCTURAL AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX-FIBRIN HYDROGEL SCAFFOLDS
Erica Budina
Medford High School, Medford, MA

Heart disease is currently the leading cause of death worldwide. Solubilized extracellular matrix(ECM) is a promising scaffold material that can be utilized to repair damaged areas of the heart. The goal of this project is to create a crosslinked cardiac ECM-fibrin hydrogel scaffold that mimics, as closely as possible, the properties of healthy native myocardial tissue. The approach was to chemically crosslink ECM using the crosslinkers ribose, genipin, and transglutaminase and add fibrin to further improve its mechanical properties. <br><br> This study was conducted in three phases that sought to crosslink solubilized ECM, ECM and fibrin hybrid scaffolds,and study cell viability within the scaffolds. The degree of crosslinking was evaluated by microscopy for evidence of fiber formation, visible light spectroscopy, and free amino group assays. A uniaxial stretching test was also performed to study the stiffness of ECM-fibrin formulations. <br><br> The presence of shifts and peaks in the absorbance spectra and the observance of fiber formation via imaging confirmed crosslinking in genipin, ribose, and transglutaminase formulations. The Young’s modulus was increased from 2.6kPa in fibrin-only formulations to 10kPa in ECM-fibrin formulations crosslinked by transglutaminase. When cells were seeded, 57% survived in control samples. Scaffolds crosslinked with 500:1 ECM to TG, 100mM ribose, and 200mM ribose maintained similar cell viability. <br><br> This study has created a novel scaffold material by crosslinking ECM using various crosslinkers and by adding fibrin. Furthermore, it has also established a method that enables the manipulation of the physical and mechanical properties of ECM hydrogels without significantly affecting cell viability.

PROTECTION BEGINS WITH DETECTION: SHIELDING RADIATION WITH ALTERNATIVE MATERIALS
Andrew Charles Doherty
Taunton High School, Taunton, MA

X-rays affect living organisms. These X-rays are considered to be relatively safe, however every X-ray exposes a person to some radiation, specifically electromagnetic radiation. Radiation is energy that travels through space as either waves or high-speed particles. The purpose of this project was to test different types of shields to prevent exposure to radiation. This was completed by placing different materials in between an X-ray machine and a dosimeter. The dosimeter gave quantitative data in regards to the amount of radiation that penetrates each material. Eight different materials were tested five times each and at two different heights. While the X-ray machine was at 20 SID (source to image distance) the lead had the lowest average mR (the unit of dosimeters) reading. Copper also supplied significant radiation protection. While the X-ray machine was at 40 SID bone had the lowest average mR reading with lead very close behind. The fluoroscopy test was also confirmed. Doctors perform fluoroscopy to patients in order to locate specific organs or vessels because it is very difficult to locate certain body parts during the X-ray process. Barium contrast is ingested while the iodine contrast in injected intravenously. Both of these enhance the X-ray photograph by “lighting up” the area. This was confirmed by injecting each liquid into foam and placing it under the X-ray machine. The picture displayed each contrast as a large white square, which lit up the area white. The data generated during this experimentation supports my hypothesis.

THE SKID LID HELMET HELPER
Claire Longcroft
Collingwood School, West Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA

Cycling is the fastest growing method of travel in North America, given its associated environment, economic and health benefits; unfortunately, this increase in cycling has lead to an increase in serious head injuries. In cycling accidents, the head is hit 38% of the time, as high as 55% in the case of children. As a result, cycling head injuries account for 10% of all children’s trauma death. In an effort to reduce the occurrence of head injuries as a result of cycling blunt force trauma to the brain, the Skid Lid Helmet Helper was developed: a gel–filled cranial cap to be worn under a standard cycling helmet that absorbs the force of a cycling collision. Utilizing tests based on national standards, device effectiveness was measured through the release of different weights onto the helmet from different heights and observation of the extent of the impression left by the collision. 240 tests were completed using Skid Lids constructed from gel and foam, both of which were compared to a control lacking Skid Lid protection. The gel Skid Lid resulted in greater than a 70% impact reduction and the foam Skid Lid resulted in approximately a 45% impact reduction. Clearly, the use of a gel Skid Lid can help to reduce the likelihood of traumatic brain injury after experiencing blunt force trauma. Although the Skid Lid was designed for use as a cycling accessory, it also has applications in other sports such as skiing and hockey and the construction industry.

CRITICAL POINT OF VIEW: A SYSTEM FOR IN VIVO MONITORING OF LUNG SOUNDS IN CRITICAL CARE PATIENTS
Kelles Diane Gordge
Great Mills High School, Great Mills, MD

Rapid detection and diagnosis of abnormal lung sounds is a key component of critical patient care. The basic stethoscope remains relatively unchanged after 70 years and provides no means of quantitative analysis or medical record documentation. This project uses the Systems Engineering Approach to create a system that continuously monitors and analyzes lung sounds in a critical care environment, to develop a means of visually identifying abnormal lung sounds, and to create a new scalar for tracking the extent of pulmonary edema.<br><br>Previous work addressed digital signal processing of lung sounds using a stethoscope in a high-noise environment. This year focused on the analysis of in vivo lung sounds using a modified endotracheal tube and targeted detection and quantification of new or rapidly changing “crackles” associated with pulmonary edema. Phase I developed models of abnormal lung sounds to define acoustical characteristics for subsequent computer recognition. Phase II developed a repeatable simulator for testing prototype hardware. Phase III integrated acoustic hardware with an endotracheal tube, which I termed the “Tracheaphone”. Phase IV created the computer algorithm for crackle recognition based on frequency shifts within the Fast Fourier Transform of the acoustical signal. I also developed a new physiological parameter (Crackle Density Indicator) that can be used to scale and track the severity of pulmonary edema.<br><br>Results indicate the system will be applicable to critical care units, as well as wide range of areas where the standard stethoscope cannot be used including aeromedical transport, military field hospitals, and ambulance transport.

INTRACELLULAR ION CHANNEL DRUG POTENCY ASSAY: ENSEMBLE MEASUREMENTS OF MITOCHONDRIA DEMONSTRATES POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL LIPID BILAYER PLATFORMS
Emily To
Oak Grove High School, San Jose, CA

Ion channels and transmembrane proteins are crucial in regulating many physiological processes. Scientific and sensing measurements of ion channel conductance depicting activity often utilize lipid bilayers and Patch Clamp, which have great shortcomings in application. This experiment uses a bilayer formation system that integrates the measurement electronics within the fluidic controls. The system enables commercial operation of the platform, a step toward applications of ion channel measurements for remote sensing and pharmacological studies requiring minimal operator involvement.<br><br>Most studies of ion channels have used patch clamp, an in-vitro pipette-based method able to electrically measure the ionic flux through a single ion channel. Traditional patch clamp, though, has many drawbacks; most important to this study is that it is unable to access and study mitochondrial ion channels.<br><br>An alternate method is the reconstitution of ion channels into artificial lipid bilayer platforms. The bilayer, high in resistance to electrical currents, provides an ideal environment for the study of ion channels. Advantages of the platform include their simplicity, ease of use, low cost, and highly controllable biological environment. This technique has not otherwise been practiced commercially prior to this study.<br><br>Bilayer platforms were created from acrylic plates following a modified stencil of a previously studied platform. A pin-tool mechanism formed the bilayers and read ionic flux. Results obtained reflect the efficacy of the platform as a suitable alternative to Patch Clamp in its ability to read, characterize, and isolate multiple ion channels with ease. The experiment was conducted with mitochondrial ion channels as a model channel with identifiable characteristics.

Neural injuries of the brain and spinal cord may induce a loss of motor and cognitive functions. There are currently few treatments for such disorders seeking to restore damaged faculties. Neural grafting is a promising alternative treatment focused on replacing damaged cells through implantation. Silk scaffolding may serve as an effective structural support for these grafted cells due to its structural integrity, biocompatibility, and low cost. This study seeks to assess the viability of electrospun silk fibroin mats as a growth surface for Neural Stem Cells (NSCs). <br><br> Silk fibroin electrospun sheets were obtained from a University. NSCs were cultured on SF mats in 90 wells for a period of 8 days with 6 control wells. Cells were assayed for metabolic activity on days 1, 4, and 8 with MTT. Differentiation was assessed using MAP2 and GFAP antibodies and Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate, staining for neuronal and astrocytic markers.<br><br> NSCs displayed successful proliferation and differentiation on SF sheets. MTT data suggests slight inhibition of NSC growth, possibly due to difficulty in cellular adherence; however, the curve of metabolic activity suggests differentiation. Immunofluorescent staining for both GFAP and MAP2 displayed successful differentiation, indicating the development of viable neurons and astrocytes.

PROMOTION OF WOUND HEALING VIA A NOVEL HYDROPHILIC DRESSING
Mallory Claire Madfes
Greenwich High School, Greenwich, CT

Prolonged length of the inflammatory phase of wound healing increases the likelihood of infection. Recent studies, however, have pointed to the unique properties of the Fibroblast Growth Factor 10 (FGF-10) and Chondroitin Sulfate (CS) as a means to accelerate initial wound healing processes. FGF-10 is produced naturally and is dispatched to a wound site, where CS acts to stabilize and improve its function. Candida albicans (CA) are fungal pathogens that are causal agents of infection in humans. CA infections have become a major health concern, where more than 15% of individuals with weakened immune systems have superficial infections of the skin or mucous membranes. Current treatments for Candidiasis are limited to the use of orally administered antimycotics that include Flucanozole (FLUC), however adverse drug reactions are of concern. This research focuses on creating an alternate path for the delivery of FLUC directly to the wound site, with simultaneous delivery of CS to promote FGF-10 function. An innovative wound dressing was created that included effective concentrations of FLUC and CS. A novel elution methodology was devised to measure time release of these agents into an aqueous medium. Results indicate that the maximum rate of FLUC and CS elution from the wound dressing occurs in the first hour of application (127 µg/hr & 0.62 mg/hr, respectively), where more than 60% of each active ingredient is time released during a time that is most critical in the wound healing process. The remaining FLUC & CS are delivered after 10 hours, after which time the dressing should be replaced.

INFLUENCE OF BONE ADAPTATION AND LOADING ON STRESS FRACTURE SUSCEPTIBILITY
Anthony Joseph Spalding
Marian High School, Mishawaka, IN

Fatigue, or stress, fractures are a very common problem among endurance athletes and military recruits. These fractures generally stem from a suddenly increased, repetitive use of a certain bone, usually in the leg or foot. This research analyzes patterns of a stress fractures and micro-damage in rat tibiae and ulnae. The bones are subjected to uniaxial cyclic compressive loading at about 70% of the average failure load. That is twenty-five pounds for the tibiae and five pounds for the ulnae. After the bones are loaded, they are stained using a barium sulfate solution to highlight the damage and imaged using a micro-CT scanner. The hypotheis that the rat tibia will exhibit a greater fatigue life and different damage patterns compared to the ulna/radius when loaded in cyclic uniaxial compression ex vivo due to being more adapted to mechanical loading is correct. Imaging of the bones has confirmed that the adaptations of the tibia such as shape and cross-sectional are, contribute to the differences in strength between it and the ulna/radius.

THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT MEDIATORS AND ELECTRODE CONFIGURATIONS ON THE EFFICIENCY AND LONGEVITY OF A MEMBRANE-LESS, ENZYMATIC BIOFUEL CELL OPERATING UNDER PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS
Kalina Anna Misiolek
John Adams High School, South Bend, IN

Medical implants are a part of daily life for many people all around the world, and in some cases, are necessary to keep people alive. However, many of these medical implants must have some sort of power source, and that power source is currently a conventional battery. It is widely known that batteries have a limited life, and must be either recharged or replaced. In either case, this creates the need for countless invasive surgeries. A possible alternative that would not require replacement is a membrane-less, enzymatic, glucose-oxygen biofuel cell.<br><br>Ideally, an implanted glucose-oxygen biofuel cell would simply rely on a steady supply of glucose and oxygen from the blood stream. However, there are still problems with the cell such as its short operational lifetime and erratic power output that must be improved before the cell is put to practical use. The objective of this study was to improve the efficiency and longevity of the biofuel cell, primarily by investigating different mediators. <br><br>A biological fuel cell was constructed using a PVC tee with a cap containing two slits into which carbon cloth electrodes were inserted. A circular tube was connected to each end of the tee through which an aerated 0.5M Dextrose and Ringer’s solution flowed past the electrodes. The entire cell operated in an incubator at a physiological temperature. The electrodes were attached to a computer interface and a computer, which calculated the energy output of the cell. Various electrode configurations and mediators were examined. It was found that all three of the mediators tested produced enough energy to power an 8µW pacemaker or a standard 221µW bionic ear; however, further tests are to be done to try to improve the stability of the power output.

NATURAL GAS SEPARATION USING THERMALLY REARRANGED POLYMERS: CHARACTERIZING MORPHOLOGICAL CHANGES OF HAB-6FDA POLYIMIDE STRUCTURES
Advaith Anand
Liberal Arts and Science Academy, Austin, TX

The pre-treatment of natural gas is the world’s largest industrial separation. Polymer<br><br>membranes are increasingly effective in replacing the inefficient traditional amine<br><br>absorption process of natural gas separation and Thermally Rearranged (TR) polymers have<br><br>superior properties over traditional polymers. The purpose of this research was to study the<br><br>morphological changes in TR polymers and identify novel parameter relationships which<br><br>will produce the best TR polymers for gas separation. In this study, the variables, treatment<br><br>temperature and holding time, were chosen as they control the free volume elements (which<br><br>strongly influence transport properties). The second phase of this project attempted to find<br><br>the correlation between treatment temperature and shrinkage, to determine which<br><br>temperatures would result in TR polymers applicable for mass scale production. The TR<br><br>polymers used in this research had the HAB6FDA structure and were synthesized by<br><br>chemical imidization. Temperatures and hold times that maximize transport properties were<br><br>found. As temperature and holding time increased, free volume for -CI increased, but<br><br>decreased for -TI. A direction relationship between temperature and shrinkage was found as<br><br>well, so -TI polymers would be better suited for mass production. Furthermore, an optimal<br><br>conversion temperature existed between 350°C and 400°C for -Ea, resulting in superior<br><br>transport properties and minimal shrinkage. In summary, this research helped find the ideal<br><br>parameters and relationships to maximize transport properties and aide natural gas<br><br>producers in creating an economical and energy efficient gas separation tool.

HYDROGELS FOR REHABILITATION OF THE HERNIATED SPINE DISC
Adi Friedman
Leo Baeck, Haifa, ISRAEL

A high percentage of humans suffer from a severe fracture of the spine known as “herniated disc”, which is usually caused by wrong movements of the back, as e.g. hard physical work including lifting of heavy objects. Medical treatments of the herniated disc conventionally involve complicated and sometimes risky surgeries. The development of minimal invasive methods is thus the main objective of the project presented.<br><br>This goal is achieved by injecting a specific “smart” hydrogel (Pluronic F127) directly into the vertebral disc. The mechanical properties of the hydrogel are designed to resemble the properties of the natural cushion that sits between the spinal vertebras. After curing, the hydrogel would gradually dissolve while in parallel new tissue growth would be stimulated by adding a Fibrinogen protein, forming a semi-interpenetrating network. <br><br>A series of in-vitro measurements were carried out: (i) The hydrogel mechanical properties as a function of temperature were measured and found adequate to support the vertebras. (ii) Dissolution of the hydrogel over time was verified and measured. (iii) Cell-growth stimulation was indeed observed and measured. (iv) A critical issue is related to the changes in viscosity. The hydrogel would be in a gel-like state when heated to body temperature, but would become liquid again under small temperature decreases. To avoid this unfavorable property, improvement of the stability under cooling by exposure to UV light [to be illuminated after hydrogel injection into the body] was suggested and measured.

HARNESSING THE MEISSNER EFFECT OF SUPERCONDUCTORS TO BUILD AN ANTIGRAVITY ELECTRICITY GENERATOR
Alexander Martin Dutton
Dutton Homeschool, Davison, MI

The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether an electrical generator could be built that was free from the forces of gravity and friction. To achieve this effect, the experiment attempted to harness the Meissner Effect of superconductors, which causes magnetic fields to be expelled from the interior of a superconductor when in the presence of an external field.<br><br>The device was built by making a ring of neodymium magnets embedded in a sheet of Lexan™,(which was light enough to levitate freely above YBCO disks). This ring was attached to a fan motor using a set of springs, which naturally stretched slightly to lay flat on the superconductors at room temperature, but then retracted when the magnetic ring started levitating. The magnetic ring was then briefly rotated above the superconductors as the fan spun, in order to induce a current in nearby inductors made from coils of copper wire connected in series. The current was to be measured qualitatively using an LED light and quantitatively using a multimeter.<br><br>While no working generator was achieved, it was not due to the theoretics of the experiment, but rather engineering problems such as spring resonance, placement of the inductors, and the induction core materials. Individually, the magnetic ring was successfully levitated, and current was induced in the coils of wire, but never together. Therefore, as the theoretical abilities of the generator are possible, there is no reason to believe it is not possible to build one given more time and materials.

THE ALGAE-MOBILE 3: BIOACTIVE ENERGY AND CARBON DIOXIDE FILTRATION IN THE EXHAUST OF A CAR
Param Jaggi
Plano East Senior High School, Plano, TX

The world today faces various problems of global warming and pollution that has created an atmosphere full of 5,000 tons of carbon dioxide. The primary source of atmospheric pollution is traced to vehicle emissions that are extracted from the exhaust system of an automobile. The purpose of the research was to create a device (The Algae-Mobile 3) to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the exhaust and simultaneously create a source of energy through the internal pressure of the exhaust system. The device was designed to capitalize upon the flow of carbon dioxide from the 'exhaust valve' which resonates through the muffler and eventually through the exhaust at a rate of approximately 32 mph. <br><br>After initial testing to grow and formulate the Chlorella algae, the algae was attached to the aluminum-alloy blades on a custom built carbon dioxide turbine. The overall device was built and created to maximize upon the potential to create a source of energy while simultaneously decreasing levels of vehicle emissions through the photosynthetic rate of the algae. The device was tested on an actual combustion engine which provides for real-world applicability. <br><br>After testing, the device decreased the carbon dioxide levels by approximately 61%. This was perpendicular to the production of approximately 320 kilowatts of energy which was stored in an external power source. It can be concluded that the Algae-Mobile 3 can provide for sustainability for a world that is in need for a cleaner environment and an alternative source of energy.

HETEROLOGOUS EXPRESSION OF OLEFIN SYNTHASE GENE IN ESCHERICHIA COLI
Suman Gunasekaran
James Madison Memorial Senior High School, Madison, WI

Microbial biosynthesis of direct-replacement hydrocarbons is an attractive alternative to petroleum-based fuels. The olefin synthase (ols) gene that can biosynthesize hydrocarbons, namely α-olefins, has been identified in cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. However, PCC 7002 is not very efficient for large-scale production. Therefore, given its many desirable characteristics, E. coli was investigated as a heterologous host for ols.<br><br> Previously, I have shown that the entire ols does not successfully translate in E. coli, and I have isolated the problem(s) preventing ols translation to a three-domain region (ACP2-ST-TE) at the C-terminus of ols. The goal for this continued research was to determine the sequence preventing translation of ACP2-ST-TE. Because ribosomes are prematurely dissociating during translation of ACP2-ST-TE, aberrant protein would be produced, whose size corresponds to the point in the ACP2-ST-TE sequence where translation is terminated. To isolate this protein, a new plasmid was engineered to contain ACP2-ST-TE as an N-terminally tagged polyhistidine fusion. After being expressed in E. coli, the polyhistidine-tagged product was separated on SDS-PAGE gels. The protein product produced had an apparent molecular mass of 71 kDa, about 7 kDa less than that of ACP2-ST-TE. The sequence corresponding to this protein was verified to contain a stop codon in the +2 frame. During translation of ols, ribosomes are believed to frameshift one frame leftward, leading to termination at this +2 frame stop codon. Frameshifting could be the result of ribosomes stalled at “hungry” codons, calling for limited aminoacyl-tRNA. Future research in protein sequencing will help determine if ribosomal frameshifting or another problem is preventing ols translation.

DESIGN OF A NOZZLE BEAM CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION REACTOR AND SYNTHESIS OF TITANIUM DIOXIDE NANOPARTICLES
Nicholas Hugo Rivera
Stuyvesant High School, New York, NY

The synthesis of thin films and nanomaterials is crucial to the advancement of technology. Current methods of synthesizing thin films of complex oxides such as strontium titanate fail to keep the titanium atoms sufficiently oxidized. Therefore this study is taken to explore a more efficient synthesis of complex oxide thin films. A chemical vapor deposition reaction chamber is designed using freely expanding nozzle jets in order to make use of the fact that molecules in such jets are in nearly collisionless environments, allowing for a higher pressure of oxygen over the substrate without an increase in dust formation. The reaction chamber is built and then tested using titanium isopropoxide and oxygen as precursors. Several samples are synthesized for 3 hours at 970 K. Growth rates of 330 μm/hr are observed and nanoparticles of sizes on the order of 20 nm are observed. The formation of these nanoparticles is analyzed on the basis of collisions in the high pressure chamber of the reactor and steric effects and leads to a method of producing smaller nanospheres. The synthesis is run again and leads to nanoparticles on the order of 10 nm. Finally, an alternate design is proposed for the synthesis of crystalline thin films in which the precursors are kept from mixing until they reach the substrate.

ENHANCING ALGAE CULTIVATION USING AN INNOVATIVE PHOTOBIOREACTOR
Aheli Chattopadhyay
Foxborough High School, Foxboro, MA

The proposed research topic has been a three-year effort. The first year’s research focused on reducing carbon dioxide in the air by a sequestration technique. Last year, carbon dioxide was biosequestered to grow photosynthetic algae that could be used as fuel; the project tested the effects of carbon dioxide absorption on algae growth in a photobioreactor, a controlled photosynthetic system.<br><br> This year, the focus was to develop an innovative photobioreactor design that had a continuous wavelike shape to aid in fluid mixing and utilized a light reflective mirror to maximize absorption of sunlight by algae. An experiment was set up to simulate the photosynthetic settings for algae production using plastic transparent tubing. To compare the effects of light exposure and photobioreactor shape on algae growth, two additional photobioreactors were designed. The second photobioreactor was similar to the first, except no light reflective mirror was used. The third model was built traditionally using individual tube segments.<br><br> A spectrophotometer was used to test the changes in light absorbance of algae samples from each photobioreactor. Using Beer’s Law, algae cell concentration was calculated, and the photobioreactor with the most algal growth was determined. The photobioreactor with the wavelike structure and light reflective mirror had the most growth at the end of the experimentation period, proving the hypothesis correct. <br><br> Future applications of the project include varying nutrient availability in order to increase lipid content in algae cells, and reducing cost of algae dewatering and oil extraction processes.

OPTIMIZATION OF THE CELLULOSE ALGAE SODIUM CHLORIDE BATTERY
Karim Kharbouch
Bridgeport Regional Aquaculture Science and Technology Education Center, Bridgeport, CT

Metal based batteries are resource dependent and environmentally harmful. Cellulose based batteries have a low manufacturing cost, are flexible and completely biodegradable. However, they are limited in performance due to the terrestrial plant cellulose fiber’s low surface area. It is suggested that utilizing marine macro-algae cellulose will improve the capacity of the battery due to the increased surface area observed in its structure and that of the paper made from it. The purpose of this experiment is to develop a flexible, biodegradable algae cellulose battery that has a higher energy capacity than the existing terrestrial plant cellulose batteries. Gracilaria tikvahiae (Gracilaria) and Laminaria saccharina (Kelp) were used to construct the two algae batteries; a third battery constructed of terrestrial plant cellulose was used as a control. After multiple trials, a novel technique was developed to turn the algae into unique uniform paper sheets without damaging the cellulose fibers. The battery discharge was measured in milliamps over one hour and the capacity, milliamps-hour per gram, was calculated. The Kelp battery demonstrated a capacity of 0.0537 milliwatt-hours per gram. The Gracilaria battery had 0.0342 milliwatt-hours per gram and the cellulose battery had 0.0372 milliwatt-hours per gram. Additionally, the Kelp battery had the longest time interval per milliamp; 1.845 milliamps for 47 minutes. The data shows that Kelp cellulose increases the capacity of the battery by 44.4% over the terrestrial cellulose cell. When connected in a series, three Kelp cells produced 2.1 volts, surpassing the voltage of an AA battery by 0.6 volts.

THERMAL ANALYSIS AND KINETIC MODELLING OF A NANOTECHNOLOGY-BASED BONE CEMENT
Laurent Fradet
Seminaire de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, Quebec, CANADA

Vertebroplasty is a procedure used to consolidate vertebral compression fractures, which are constantly growing in number due to the ageing of the population. The biomaterials that are injected into the trabecular bone are responsible for three major clinical complications, which are risks of cement leakage, thermal necrosis of tissues, and chemical necrosis of tissues. The goal of this experiment was to test a new formulation of bone cement based on nanoparticles of tungsten (produced by Inductive Coupled Plasma) as the radiopacifier in an attempt to reduce the clinical complications experienced with the currently used biomaterials, studied in a previous project. Thermal analysis of the nano tungsten bone cement has been carried under Differential Scanning Calorimetry. Also, a kinetic model of the reaction has been used to determine the relative activation energy of the cement’s polymerization reaction. The kinetic model was based on the heat flow obtained during isothermal DSC procedures. The studied parameters related to specific clinical problems. The different samples studied varied in nano tungsten concentration in order to define which would be the optimal. It has been concluded that the concentration of nano tungsten does not affect significantly the maximal temperature reached during polymerization. Also, the concentration of 15% excess nano tungsten contained the smallest concentration of cytotoxic residuals, reducing chemical necrosis. The curves obtained by kinetic modelling proved the concept of our heat production-based experimental model, even though the relative activation energies calculated with it varied because of the variation in the samples weight.

SIMIS-GA: IMPACT MINIMIZING SYSTEM FOR GYMNASTICS FLOOR
Paula Szuster Sarue
Escola Brasileira Israelita Chaim Nachman Bialik, Sao Paulo, SP, BRASIL

In previous Olympic Games, 83% of gymnasts that were on the podium for floor exercise had already presented serious injuries throughout their career, which is common among gymnasts. Thus, I asked myself how I could solve this without modifying the characteristics of gymnastics. I attacked the problem in 2 steps – in the first one I analyzed the performances of these gymnasts on the floor using statistic frequencies to verify the positions of the maneuvers’ landings. I found out that 81% of the landings were on the four corners of the floor, characterizing these spots as risky areas. I concluded that, once athletes don’t continue the movement after the risky maneuver, it’s not necessary to have a floor that provides bounce on corners. In the second step, I studied the floor’s structure to measure the problem with mathematical precision. I got samples of the foams that compose the floor and applied resilience and compression tests, initially using a prototype that I built. However, the results presented a large margin of error and proved to be inconclusive to elaborate a mathematical analysis of the materials’ properties, leading me to repeat the tests in certified laboratory. With these results, I discovered the amount of force exerted by the floor on a risky maneuver landing and compared it with standards considered as healthy (4.59 times the body weight). The values of dissipated energy are of 50% and 29% of the mechanical energy, which in a risky maneuver is 1090J and 630J, respectively. I concluded that the reaction force of the floor is 186 times bigger than the standard established (F≤4.59xBW) and that the floor’s structure on the corners must immediately be substituted. This floor structure change will not affect in anyway the characteristics of the sport.

DETERMINATION OF THE OPTIMAL BARIUM SULFATE CONCENTRATION IN A BONE CEMENT
Laurent Fradet
Seminaire de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada

Osteoporosis is a disease currently affecting 1.4 million Canadians and is a growing concern because of the ageing population. Its main consequence is an increase in the risks of fracture, especially vertebral compression fractures. A procedure, vertebroplasty, is dedicated to the treatment of these fractures. My project’s objective was to modify the biomaterials (bone cements) injected during vertebroplasty to solidify the fracture vertebral bodies in order to make them safer. Three main objectives were fixed, all related to a clinical problem due to the biomaterials injected during vertebroplasty: augmenting the radiopacity of the bone cements (the radiological visualization is capital for detecting potentially dangerous cement leakage), reducing the heat production of the cements during their polymerization (causing a thermal necrosis of tissues), and reducing the residual monomer content of the cements (causing a chemical necrosis of tissues). Other properties of bone cements have also been investigated. The experiments were conduced using a Differential Scanning Calorimeter to analyse the polymerization kinetics of the bone cements and an X-ray machine was used in order to perform radiopacity tests. Different samples of bone cements were studied in which the concentration of barium sulfate, one of the cement’s constituents, was varied. Our results showed that an increase in the barium sulfate’s content (40% w/w of the cement’s powder) would lead to a better radiological visualization and a smaller heat production than the currently used bone cements, therefore minimizing the risks of undetected cement leakage and thermal necrosis of tissues following vertebroplasty.

EFFECTS OF OXYGEN PLASMA ON BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS
Bilge Zeren Aksu
Ankara Science High School, Ankara, TURKEY

This study aims to ascertain the effects of oxygen plasma on biological systems under certain conditions to test the applicability of plasma treatment on model biological systems; and to propose a therapeutic approach for medical applications. For this aim, the current plasma technology was used to test oxygen plasma’s effectiveness at cellular level in bacterial and fungal decontamination of surfaces. Plasma treatment was applied to bacteria, yeast and moulds under a variety of conditions. Notably, 99.90% reduction was observed, after plasma treatment at 100 W power-30 min duration conditions, in the microorganism load on steel surfaces. The study of damaging effects of oxygen plasma, on these microorganisms, was followed by investigation of this damage at molecular level, and enzyme catalase was selected as a target enzyme. The efficacy of plasma was shown quantitatively by loss of enzymatic activity. Total results thus demonstrated the effect of oxygen plasma both at cellular and molecular level. These results indicated that plasma exposure could be damaging to cancer cells. We theorized that if catalase activity can be decreased by plasma action, peroxide would accumulate in the cytoplasm and this would damage the cells with high oxidative species content, namely the cancer cells. Thus, our results imply that oxygen plasma might be used as a tool for therapy of cancer tissues, especially superficial tissues such as skin. The application of plasma process for cancer therapy will be possible by the development of plasma compatible medical devices with novel designs that are suitable to apply plasma to human skin.

DEVELOPING A THERMO/HYDROCHROMIC ROADWAY PAINT APPLICATION TO INCREASE DRIVER AWARENESS DURING HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS
Nicholas Michael Huey
Camdenton High School, Camdenton, MO

During 2009, 55,733 automobile accidents were recorded in Missouri alone, resulting in 321 fatalities and many more injuries. Across the United States,5 1/2 million traffic accidents were reported, injuring 2,217,000 people and killing 33,808 (2009 Missouri State Highway System Traffic Crash Statistics). The total sum of economic toll that these accidents inflicted was 230.6 billion dollars. Of all of these wrecks, an unrecorded number are a direct result of inclement weather, namely precipitation accumulation. Many drivers remain unaware of the dangerous conditions that they drive in, and as a consequence, do not take the necessary precautions while driving on the roadways. Thermochromic paint warns of dropping temperatures while water-sensitive coatings may give visual clues to the presence of precipitation. This project examines the effectiveness of thermochromic additive, water sensitive glaze and standard highway paint in warning of hazardous road conditions. <br><br>Standard road paint was mixed with thermochromic slurry and applied to an asphalt surface. A hydrochromic glaze was then applied over the top of the thermochromic paint for water indication. The paint was then subjected to above and below freezing temperatures, with and without water and monitored for color change and temperatures at which the color change took place. Simulations of roadways with this new paint design were created and used to assess the effect of these color changing paints on driver reaction to hazardous road conditions. Two designs were created, the second one utilizing the ability of hydrochromic paint to change color with water, without water, and with ice. The results of both experiments utilizing these different designs were analyzed and compared for effectiveness. <br><br>After examining the results of this study, it was concluded that thermochromic and hydrochromic paints initiated a significant difference in the driver’s recognition of ice on the road. With a P value of less than .0001, thermochromic and hydrochromic paints seem to draw the attention of those within the vehicle to the ice, and thus increase awareness of icy conditions on the roads.

SELF-AUTOMATED LUBRICATION (SAL)
Patrick Kieran Corbett
St. Patrick's College, 25, Coleraine Road, Maghera. Co. Derry. Northern Ireland

A major problem which arises in manufacturing conveyor systems is bearing malfunction. Most of this failure in the system is due to lack of lubrication leading to excessive wear of the bearings. Overcoming the problem in continuous online manufacturing processes involved a very labour intensive manual procedure involving the application of lubricant to individual bearings. Existing procedures involved a very expensive, twice weekly, manual application of lubricant thus necessitating the need for a more efficient self-automated lubrication process.<br><br> The initial prototype which was capable of detecting individual bearing position, involved a method of delivering small drops of lubricant into compressed air, forming an oil-air vapour, which was subsequently projected onto the bearings through an injector system. However, this system placed major limitations on the volume of lubricant that could be applied to individual bearing systems. Further research, development and trialing produced a more effective and efficient system known as SAL (Self Automated Lubrication). This system was not only capable of detecting bearing position on the conveyor system but was also capable of delivering adequate lubrication relative to the bearing size. <br><br> The savings to the company associated with reduced bearing replacement, labour costs associated with routine maintenance and downtime on machinery were very significant. The SAL has now been effectively applied across all of the manufacturing conveyor systems within the factory complex. As the volume of lubricant can be accurately regulated, significant savings have also been made in the overall amount of lubricant used per unit time.<br><br>

STOICHIOMETRIC LASER-INDUCED BREAKDOWN SPECTROSCOPY (LIBS) ANALYSIS FOR SIMPLE AND COST EFFECTIVE PRODUCTION OF OPTICAL QUALITY CERAMIC YTTRIUM ALUMINUM GARNET (YAG)
Matthew Leong Chun
Jericho High School, Jericho, NY

Yttrium Aluminum Garnet, YAG (Y3Al5O12), is the most common gain medium in solid-state lasers for military applications (hazardous materials detection, designators, rangefinders), biology (surgery, tumor therapy, wound healing), nuclear energy, space exploration (Mars rover), ecology (pollutant detection), and industry (welding). Ceramic YAG produces larger, more homogeneous samples than current commercially produced single-crystal YAG, for higher quality lasers. However, fabrication is challenging, requiring 0.1mol% precision of the Al2O3/Y2O3 starting powder ratio. In this study, the potential of Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) for the measurement of the Al2O3/Y2O3 starting powder ratio was evaluated to improve the production process by (I) determining the role of density on LIBS spectral stability and (II) verifying LIBS sensitivity to the Al2O3/Y2O3 ratio. A student-constructed LIBS system analyzed mixtures of Al2O3 and Y2O3 nanopowders with varying stoichiometries, Matlab programming analyzed spectra, and plasma theory was utilized to calculate plasma temperatures and create a theoretical model comparing LIBS-measured elemental ratios to actual stoichiometries (r^2=0.573, r=0.76). This LIBS study (I) identified denser, sintered samples to be optimal for LIBS analysis and (II) strongly evidenced LIBS potential for stoichiometric analysis of Al2O3 and Y2O3 powders. With further improvements to the LIBS setup combined with other stoichiometric techniques, increased sensitivity can be achieved for lower-cost and 100x faster production of ceramic YAG that is 1.5x stronger, 3x tougher, and can include 5x higher dopant densities than current single-crystal YAG. Extended further, this study can prove valuable for production of all transparent ceramics.

WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO SLOW DOWN THE EFFECTS OF A COLLAPSING BUILDING?
Catharine Rose Scoboria
Berks Catholic High School, Reading, PA

The purpose of this study was to determine if dampening devices could reduce the effects of a collapsing building. In a tall structure the force of the falling floors causes a "pancaking" effect resulting in total collapse. Could pancaking be eliminated using simple devices to decelerate the falling structure? The methods investigated were pneumatic, energy absorbing, and elastic dampers. A model was used to study how each method slowed the falling structure. The model was instrumented to measure the force, position, and acceleration of the falling structure. A force sensor measured each damper individually. A motion sensor tracked the position, velocity and acceleration of the top structure when released at a certain height above the floor.<br><br> The values measured using the model to simulate a real structure were graphed and evaluated. The weight of the falling structure in the model was 22 N. Assuming a safety factor of five, the required decelerating force (upward force of dampers) must not exceed 110 N or 27.5 N per device with four devices per floor. <br><br> The damping force needs to overcome the kinetic energy of the moving structure. To keep the damping force less than five times the weight of the falling structure the deceleration must not exceed four times gravity, or 39.2m/s^2.<br><br> All but one of the dampers, both individually and attached to the structure, satisfied the minimum requirements for deceleration. The measured values of 28N for the pneumatic dampers were very close to the safety limit.

CREATING POROUS TIO2 NANOPARTICLES TO IMPROVE THE CHARGE CARRIER EFFICIENCY OF PHOTOELECTROCHEMICAL CELLS
Ayush Gupta
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland, OR

Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSC) provide a cheaper alternative to silicon based solar cells. The anode of DSSCs consists of a semiconductor (TiO2) dyed with a photosensitive dye to increase its light absorbance spectra. Current TiO2 application methods create multiple porous layers that improve its overall light harvesting efficiency. However, the layers lack structural uniformity, thus impeding electron movement to the conductive coating due to absence of a diode. To alleviate this problem, I used micelles in solution (polyvinyl alcohol) as a nanoparticle template, and a solid-state micellar template (porous alumina) to control the size of the TiO2 particle precipitate. These fabricated nanoparticles were then applied to glass slides, dyed with tetra (4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin, and attached to a counter electrode to create the cell. The cell was then connected to a potentiostat to collect data. TiO2 obtained from the dry alumina reaction yielded a 46% increase in open circuit voltage over the control and an 11% increase over previously published research, while also decreasing the rate of charge recombination in the cell. The method using the solid state template fabricated a unique porous (TiO2) nanoparticulate which was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. This helped improve the overall charge carrier efficiency of the DSSC while maintaining low manufacturing cost. This novel approach of fabricating TiO2 highlights a new process to create DSSCs allowing them to be further optimized for energy production and eventually increase viability of solar energy as a renewable energy resource.

Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) are vital technological breakthroughs in the fields of nanolithography and surface science. Both microscopes rely on delicate, sharp-tipped probes with radii of curvature (RoC) <50nm to scan the samples and provide viable images of atomic structures. The production of probes with such high standards has caused major inconveniences for 30 years. <br><br>The purpose of this project is to develop a facile process to fabricate functional tungsten probes and to compare their characteristics when produced by the single-step and two-step dynamic electrochemical etching methods. The goal is to introduce a simplistic method that would decrease the cost of the probes while maintaining high standards in probe specifications.<br><br>Cuurently, the most efficient method to produce probes is Dynamic Electrochemical Etching. In this project, an enhanced Dynamic Electrochemical Etching process has been introduced, incorporating a new step in the process to ease the use of thick (radius >125um) wires.<br><br>An RoC of 25nm or less was routinely fabricated when the novel Two-Step Electrochemical Etching (TEE) process with an etching wire radius of <90um was adopted. Furthermore, in a financial case study it was shown that the production of 42 probes in the lab using the TEE method would equal the cost of purchasing one probe “off-the-shelf.” <br><br>This technological advancement can further facilitate and accelerate the study of the electric properties of different materials, the fabrication of nano-structures at the atomic level, and the study of living cells, along with other applications.

POWER FOR THE POOR
Pieter Christiaan Berning Luyt
Harriston School, Harrismith, Free State, South Africa

This project was developed to satisfy the need for cheap, environmentally friendly, and sufficient electricity generation. Many rural people, especially African people, lack the advantage of having electricity, primarily because they cannot be reached by the power grid.<br><br> Various methods were explored to solve this problem; only one met all the criteria (cheap, environmentally friendly, sufficient electricity). This method combines wind power and miniature hydroelectric generation. The method was achieved by setting up a hydroelectric cycle (two storage tanks in the customary fashion – one elevated over the other, pipes connecting the two tanks, and a Pelton wheel to convert the flowing water into electricity). The water is pumped back to the elevated tank using a windmill.<br><br> Bernoulli’s equation was used to calculate the theoretical energy output as function of water flow rate and height of tank above the ground. It was found that the 100% efficiency (cannot be achieved, but serves as a maximum value) of this system is 3531.6 kWh.

CREATING POROUS TIO2 NANOPARTICLES TO IMPROVE THE CHARGE CARRIER EFFICIENCY OF PHOTOELECTROCHEMICAL CELLS
Ayush Gupta
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland, OR

Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSC) provide a cheaper alternative to silicon based solar cells. The anode of DSSCs consists of a semiconductor (TiO2) dyed with a photosensitive dye to increase its light absorbance spectra. Current TiO2 application methods create multiple porous layers that improve its overall light harvesting efficiency. However, the layers lack structural uniformity, thus impeding electron movement to the conductive coating due to absence of a diode. To alleviate this problem, I used micelles in solution (polyvinyl alcohol) as a nanoparticle template, and a solid-state micellar template (porous alumina) to control the size of the TiO2 particle precipitate. These fabricated nanoparticles were then applied to glass slides, dyed with tetra (4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin, and attached to a counter electrode to create the cell. The cell was then connected to a potentiostat to collect data. TiO2 obtained from the dry alumina reaction yielded a 46% increase in open circuit voltage over the control and an 11% increase over previously published research, while also decreasing the rate of charge recombination in the cell. The method using the solid state template fabricated a unique porous (TiO2) nanoparticulate which was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. This helped improve the overall charge carrier efficiency of the DSSC while maintaining low manufacturing cost. This novel approach of fabricating TiO2 highlights a new process to create DSSCs allowing them to be further optimized for energy production and eventually increase viability of solar energy as a renewable energy resource.

BIOFUEL CELLS MADE WITH NANOPARTICLES AND ENZYMES FOR BIOIMPLANTS AND BIOSENSORS
Adriel Sumathipala
Broad Run High School, Ashburn, VA

The future of personal healthcare opens possibilities for early prevention and therapeutic intervention with implanted biomedical devices. These devices could reside inside an artery or organ to continuously monitor internal biological status and alert or take corrective action. Such in-vivo bioimplants/biosensors require an electrical power source. Glucose could be harnessed as a fuel to provide this energy. This research investigated a glucose biofuel-cell made with enzyme-catalysts and carbon-nanotubes (CNT) to understand the impact nanoparticles have on generated power.<br><br>Biofuel cells were made with enzymes glucose-oxidase/catalase (anode) and laccase (cathode). To test the transfer of electrons liberated by the redox reaction at enzyme active sites facilitated by conducting particles, four biofuel cells were constructed with different conducting particles in each electrode; long CNTs, short CNTs, graphite and silicon.<br><br>Biofuel-cell performance in generating electricity was tested by measuring voltage and current for a 0.05 mol/l glucose-fuel solution. The mean output powers for cells containing long CNTs, short CNTs, graphite, silicon, and control (no conducting particles) were 90.11 μW, 1.39 μW, 0.17 μW, 0.13 μW and 0.04μW, respectively.<br><br>The enzymatic biofuel cells with conducting particles converted chemical energy to electrical energy. The size and geometry of the additive particles influenced power generated. The biofuel cell with long CNTs gave the best performance, better than the cell with short CNTs (p<0.05). Long CNTs have a smaller diameter and longer length, which may facilitate more efficient electron transfer and thus give better performance. Future work includes methods in electrode fabrication to increase reaction surface area and electron transfer.

REMOT BIOLOGICAL THERMOMETER AND SENSOR
Mc Allen Reonel Sales Cacacho
Cagayan National High School, Tuguegarao City, Philippines

The Remote Biological Thermometer and Sensor (Remote BTS) is used to measure the temperature of object by transmitting its signal in the form of clicks to an FM radio receiver twenty meters away.<br><br> It consists of semiconductors, capacitors, resistors and coils of magnet wire arrayed on a circuit board by soldering. There are two sections of the device: the sensor circuit that senses variations in temperature and generates signals in the form of clicks, and the transmitter circuit that superimposes the signal for transmission to an FM radio receiver. Thus, continuous transmission of signals can be done by remote and can be recorded on tape.<br><br> When the signal diode of the sensor circuit is placed, for example, on the base of either thumb, it will measure the body temperature. This is determined by counting the number of clicks in one minute monitored by the FM radio and referring it against a calibrated table of equivalents in degrees Celsius.<br><br> Several trials were conducted in obtaining the temperature of randomly picked patients in hospitals. The data were compared with clinical and digital thermometer readings.<br><br> The results of the F-test using both the manual and microstat computation yielded an F-ratio value of 0.01 which is less than the critical value of 5.49 at 0.01 level of significance. This means that there is no significant difference between the temperature reading of the device compared with clinical and digital thermometers.<br><br>

THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN EFFECTIVE WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORK FOR A FLOOD MONITORING SYSTEM
Abdulla Ahmed Almazrooa
Al Andalus Private School, Jeddah, Western, SAUDI ARABIA

Numerous cities around the world are overpopulated and therefore flooding has become a serious problem. Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, suffered from extreme floods in 2009 that caused more than 100 fatalities. The main cause was heavy traffic jams that occurred during the rains and the lack of a system that is capable of monitoring floods in an urban environment. This project aims at the development of a wireless sensor network dedicated to optimal flood monitoring. Sonar, microphone and accelerometer sensors were tested and evaluated in a simulated environment for use in rainfall rate estimation, the critical component for forecasting floods. Sonar data showed multiple sound waves reflected off of simulated raindrops. The microphone data showed a 15:1 signal to noise ratio (SNR). This is an indication that microphone and sonar sensors are capable of efficient rainfall rate estimation, as they allow for the accumulation of more accurate data. The accelerometer shows a 4:1 SNR, which is too low for viable results. In addition, sonar and microphone devices are more efficient than traditional rainfall rate sensors. For example, Rain gauges require frequent maintenance, especially when deployed in a desert environment. Future works include developing a working prototype that would incorporate these sensors and be deployed in the Jeddah region. These could eventually be linked to the emergency systems and divert traffic patterns from life-threatening situations. The implications of this tool are to save material possessions and most importantly lives, in this local community and around the world!

EHEART: ECG SIGNAL PROCESSING SYSTEM FOR AUTOMATIC DETECTION OF CARDIAC ABNORMALITIES
Vamsi Chunduru
Capital High School, Olympia, WA

Signal processing is becoming ubiquitous through mobile devices, from personal computers to smart phones. This capability can be harnessed to implement advanced biological signal processing systems—hitherto limited to pricey, advanced medical systems—in an affordable and accessible manner.<br><br>Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) is a predominant medical tool to diagnose cardiac problems through the interpretation of heart’s electrical activity. It is characterized by specific deflections, P-Q-R-S-T, whose attributes viz. duration, frequency, amplitude, etc., correlate to specific electro-muscular activities of the heart. Deviations of these indicate potential cardiac abnormalities.<br><br>eHeart is a signal processing system developed to analyze ECG for specific attributes, compare with ‘normal’ values, and map deviations to potential cardiac abnormalities. Using peak detection and threshold comparison methods, the ECG data file is analyzed to identify the deflections. Statistical methods are applied to compute specified ECG parameters. Finally, these parameters are compared with normal values and deviations are mapped to known cardiac abnormalities: Hypertrophy, Hypokalemia/Hyperkalemia, Arrhythmia, Myocardial Infarction, and Ischemia. These deviations trigger alerts based on patient history and personalized settings. <br><br>eHeart was developed in MATLAB. Normal & known abnormal ECG data were used for testing, calibration, and validation.<br><br>Looking forward, eHeart is intended towards becoming an integrated medical system running on a portable device such as a smartphone, allowing for personal medical alerts, remote monitoring, and ‘real-time' feedback between doctor and patient, becoming accessible, affordable, and revolutionizing medical care.

TARGETED THERMAL ABLATION OF CANCER CELLS USING BIOSURFACTANT COATED CARBON NANOTUBES
Joy Shuang Zeng
Poolesville High School, Poolesville, MD

The experimental use of nanoparticles to destroy cancer cells in photothermal therapy (PTT) is a promising technology that could lead to effective, targeted cancer treatments. This project investigated the use of a new nanoparticle formulation for improved, targeted cancer therapy. Specifically, we investigated the use of hyaluronic acid-5β-cholanic acid (HACA)-coated single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) for PTT of cancer cells. SWCNTs are suitable nanoparticles for use with PTT because they generate heat from near infrared (NIR) light that passes through biological tissue. HACA is a biosurfactant which renders SWCNTs soluble, non-cytotoxic, and targeted to cancer cells. For these reasons HACA-coated SWCNTs (HACA-SWCNTs) show promise as cancer cell-targeted PTT agents. This project was an initial step in the process of evaluating HACA-SWCNTs for PTT of cancer cells. Targeted SWCNTs coated with HACA and non-targeted SWCNTs coated with phospholipid-poly(ethylene glycol) (PL-PEG) were compared for killing efficiency in in vitro experiments with SCC7 (murine squamous cell carcinoma) cells. SCC7 cells were also separately treated with either HACA-SWCNTs or NIR radiation. Initial results showed that targeting SWCNTs with HACA increased their thermal ablation efficiency during PTT by almost 20% when compared to PL-PEG SWCNTs. Additionally, HACA-SWCNTs and NIR radiation were confirmed to be non-cytotoxic to cells when not coupled with each other. These experiments demonstrated the benefit of targeting SWCNTs to cancer cells by coating them with HACA and suggested that HACA-SWCNTs have potential as effective PTT agents. Further experimentation and optimization could lead to the development of a new, effective cancer therapy.

This project deals with the theory, the design and the construction of a new type of inertial sensor. An inertial sensor is a device which is capable of measuring its orientation in relation to a reference coordinate system. Former inertial sensors incorporated gyroscopically stabilized devices based on the fact that once a gyroscope is in motion; it forces its axis of rotation to a fixed position in space. But since these systems are based on mechanical sensors, typical inertial sensors tend to be bulky, heavy and require intensive maintenance. Also gyroscopic systems can sense in only two axes, being unable to detect rotations around the gyroscope’s axis of rotation. <br><br>The sensor here presented does not make use of any mechanical system to create a fixed reference system. Instead, it senses the orientation of the earth’s gravitational and magnetic fields and derives a fixed coordinate system from these vectorial values. <br><br>The sensor hardware, which measures only about 60 cubic centimeters, is attached to a host computer by means of a USB co nection.

IMPROVING THE HEAT CAPACITY OF HOMEMADE SOLAR OVENS
Raquel Candace Redshirt
Shiprock High School, Shiprock, NM

I decided to conduct a science project to explore heating differences in solar oven lining materials as an extension of my previous project: “Does a Homemade Solar Oven Really Work?” I tested two lining materials: black paper and aluminum foil. I changed the solar oven lining between experimental conditions to determine which oven would achieve a higher and a more constant temperature. I built two solar ovens according to the same structural design but varied the oven lining. I hypothesized that the black construction paper would achieve a higher and more constant temperature reading. I placed the two ovens into direct sunlight and recorded oven temperature every 20 minutes over the course of 6 hours, repeating the experiment 4 times. I graphed oven temperature readings over time and compared average maximum temperatures between materials. Black construction paper had the highest recorded temperature (254°F), while the foil condition recorded a maximum temperature of (227°F). However, I discovered that the aluminum foil lining heated up faster, due to a lower heat capacity. I concluded that the black construction lining reached a higher and more constant temperature due to its heating properties. Thus, it is best to use black paper to line homemade solar ovens when seeking to obtain a higher and more constant heat within a homemade solar oven. With the information I gained from this project, I can improve the performance of homemade solar ovens, which are relatively inexpensive and sustainable heating machines.

FABRICATION AND COMPARISON OF PLASTIC AND METAL FERROELECTRIC CAPACITORS FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS
Fatimah Ghassan Alajaji
Alfaisaliah Islamic School for Girls, Alkhobar, Eastern, SAUDI ARABIA

Current silicon-based technology has many down-sides, including low physical flexibility, high cost, problems with scaling, and high power consumption. The use of polymeric substrates as a substitute for silicon presents a considerable opportunity for Saudi Arabia, with its abundant petrochemical infrastructure. In this research, an all-polymer ferroelectric capacitor is fabricated based on the functional polymer poly(vinylidene fluoride trifluoroethylene) [P(VDF-TrFE)] on a substrate of polyethylene napthalate [PEN], with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrene sulfonic acid) [PEDOT:PSS] electrodes. P(VDF-TrFE)’s easy deposition on a wide range of substrates and processability at low temperatures makes it ideal to act as the ferroelectric layer in the capacitor. It was developed primarily by utilizing a spin-coating technique for each layer, followed by heating/annealing periods. The performance of these all-polymer devices was studied and compared to baseline metal devices on a silicon substrate. Specifically, the hysteresis and switching current responses were studied. The apparatus was built 5 times and tested 30 times each. These novel devices showed a tremendously improved coercive field [Ec] value of 6V compared to earlier research by Xu et. Al., with all-polymer capacitors displaying an Ec of 13V. The all-polymer capacitors also exhibited comparable performance to ones with metal electrodes. As they provide an alternative for silicon-based capacitors, these devices have countless uses in the field of Information Technology (IT), which has become an integral part in our daily lives. Future IT applications could include logic/memory, RFID tagging, and sensors.

CALCULATIONS OF OPTIMIZED GRAPHENE ELECTRODES IN HIGH PERFORMANCE ORGANIC TRANSISTORS
Yuebi Hu
Stuyvesant High School, New York, NY

Finding a facile and reliable method to transfer graphene from a growth substrate (usually copper foil) to target substrates is the first step towards using graphene electrodes in commercial electronic devices, especially organic field-effect transistors. The previously reported inking elastomeric stamping method consumed a total of 47.5 hours. Optimized conditions identified in this research decreases annealing time by 93.3% and waiting time by 82.6%, reducing the initial procedure by 18.5 hours for a 40% decrease in total production time. In this investigation, p-type dibenzotetrathienocoroene and rubrene transistors were made with these graphene electrodes. These transistors show a significant improvement in electronic properties, as corroborated by theoretical density functional theory (DFT)calculations. Typically, electron mobility increased by over 300% and on-off ratio increased by 1000% when compared to transistors made with gold electrodes—the current optimal metal electrode material. Further calculations were completed to verify this efficiency increase and propose an induced semiconductor behavior after graphene electrodes are doped using bromine and iodine. This newly optimized method for transferring graphene and its application as a semiconductor allow the electronic and physical properties of large-scale arrays of single-layer graphene to be exploited in a new generation of more environmentally friendly electronics.

DNA: NANO CHICKEN WIRE
Christopher Parsons Kelly
Little Rock Central High School, Little Rock, AR

As a nanomaterial, DNA has potential as a material for developing new medical and manufacturing technologies, such as creating an organic coating for objects to be placed into a living being. This could be done by creating a DNA lattice, a structure that can self-assemble based on the complementarity of DNA strands. The goal of this project was to compare how well different types of sequences form a DNA lattice structure. The hypothesis was that DNA composed of unique, random sequences would self-assemble into larger structures than DNA composed of alternating purine and pyrimidine bases. Eight synthetic DNA oligonucleotides were designed, four with intercomplementary random sequences (B set), four with intercomplemetary alternating purine-pyrimidine sequence (Z set), with 50% G:C content and carrying 5’-GTAC linkers. Primer sets, in triplicate, were denatured and annealed. Two-thirds of each annealed sample was ligated, then half of each ligated sample was cut by Rsa I (cleaves at GTAC). A negative control was constructed using two non-complementary primers from each set. All samples were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The negative control did not produce high molecular weight structures. The Z primer set self-assembled into complexes larger than the individual primers. However, an error in Z-set primer design resulted in a two basepair mismatch in one arm of the cruciform structure. Thus, it is unclear whether failure to form high molecular weight lattices was due to the alternating purine-pyrimidine sequences or the two base mispairing. High molecular weight lattices were produced by the complex/unique sequence primer set.

EVALUATION OF POLYVINYL-ALCOHOL POLYMERS AS AN EFFECTIVE SHIELDING MECHANISM AGAINST IONIZING RADIATION INDUCED DEGRADATION IN COTS MICROCONTROLLER DEVICES
Christopher Louis Panuski
North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, Durham, NC

As aerospace technology advances, we are continually driven further into the abyss of space. Consequently, the effects of cosmic ray radiation have become a major factor to account for when designing efficient and effective high-altitude systems. Due to the rising costs, decreased availability and growing age, outdated radiation hardened parts require a feasible alternative. Thus, the integration of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) microcontrollers (MCUs), such as those tested in this project, has become vital for the development of current and future aerospace electronics systems. Due to the possible risk of single event upset (SEU) and ionizing dose accumulation, polymers shielding mechanisms for these components are being researched. Polyethylene has shown promise as a possible shield; however, it lacks the required strength to be integrated into structural aircraft components. Here, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) shielded microcontrollers, noted for their structural integrity and chemical comparability to polyethylene, were subjected to a total ionizing dose (TID) device failure test in a Co-60 irradiator. Additionally, computational stopping power results for each material were calculated using SRIM software. SPENVIS, a space particle modeling software, was subsequently used to relate the experimental data to a practical aerospace environment. PVA proved to be ~50% more effective than HDPE in terms of extending device lifetime and over 20% more effective than aluminum at attenuating galactic cosmic ray particles; however, SEU testing is needed to provide upset cross-section reduction information. With an unshielded lifetime of ~1 year, results also demonstrate the viability of COTS microcontroller usage in short-term high radiation applications.

ELEVATING WHEELCHAIR SEAT
Richard William Entwisle
Canford School, Wimborne, Dorset, England

Modern electric wheelchairs have given disabled people much more freedom, but users are still very disadvantaged by a lack of height. Despite the 1995 British Disability Discrimination Act, reception desks are often at head height making communication and writing very difficult, and library shelves and supermarket displays are often out of reach. My design is an electric wheelchair modified to allow the whole seat to be raised and lowered electrically.<br><br>In designing the chair I felt it was very important that when the seat was raised the wheelchair should be completely stable and still able to move forwards and backwards. To help achieve stability I lowered the centre of gravity of the wheelchair by moving the batteries closer to the floor and to the rear of the chair. I considered various methods for raising the seat looking for a mechanism that was reasonably light, smooth in its operation, free of parts that might jam, with relatively little forward/backward movement on operation, and which was cost effective for mass production. I designed a parallel lever mechanism, which satisfied most of these criteria and looked at powering it with either a hydraulic ram or an electro-mechanical actuator. Although the hydraulic ram would have been able to raise the seat more quickly, the extra cost, weight and complexity made it impractical, and I fitted the wheelchair with an electric actuator.<br><br>The modified wheelchair now allows for the whole seat including the arm-rests and foot supports to be raised by upto 25cms.<br><br>

COMPARISON OF TRANSVERSE DAMAGE BEHAVIOR IN NANOREINFORCED AND NON-NANOREINFORCED GFRP
Hanan Naji Al-Ali
Dhahran Ahliyya School, Dammam, Eastern, SAUDI ARABIA

Composite materials have beneficial applications, especially in aerospace and automotive technologies, due to their desirable properties, which include overall low weight and high strength. Adding nanoreinforcements to composite materials could potentially improve the thermal and electrical properties contained therein. However, few studies focused on the effect of the carbon nanotubes (CNT) on the mechanical properties on multi-scale laminates. It is important to study the transverse damage behavior in a multi-scale laminate because every aspect and property need to be assessed. Therefore, this scienctific research project focused on fabrication of two Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) +45 -45 laminates using the vacuum infusion method; one with nanoreinforcements and one without nanoreinforcements. The effect of reinforcing the matrix of the GFRP with 0.1 wt% of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), using ultrasonic mixing on the material’s mechanical properties was investigated. Five samples were prepared and a simple tensile test was applied using the universal testing machine to identify the shear strength. The shear strength is directly related to the bulk matrix and the matrix-fiber interface of the material, which are the phases aimed by the process to reinforce with CNT. Experimentations showed that the nanoreinforced samples exhibit around 5-10% more damage than the non-nanoreinforeced samples. This shows that nanoreinforcements do not improve the mechanical properties of a composite material, as was hypothesized. In future works, we hope to study the effect of changing the amount of carbon nanotubes that are added and the exact methods of adding them.

COMPUTER-AIDED TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATIONS

The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether a simple two-channel electroencephalography (EEG) appliance could be used to detect phonemes, which are the smallest segments of sound that comprise words. The phonemes measured were those that study subjects were thinking, but not physically speaking. Locked-in patients who cannot speak or otherwise physically communicate could benefit greatly from having a non-invasive system to communicate verbally. A two-channel EEG appliance was constructed to measure brain activity. Nine healthy, English speaking volunteers, wired with non-invasive electrodes over Broca’s area of the brain (the left temple), were tested to see if the phonemes they were thinking could be effectively detected. The subjects were seated in front of a computer where phonemes were displayed on the screen and they were asked to think of verbally communicating the phoneme for the short time it was displayed.<br><br>Two sets of data were collected by detection software: a trainer set and a test set. Each was comprised of 20 iterations of six known English phonemes. The signals recorded for each phoneme were preprocessed with a Fast Fourier Transformation to improve signal detection. The experiment revealed that four of the six phonemes could be sufficiently distinguished. The EEG system in its present form was not found to be adequate to sufficiently detect phonemes that can be used to identify unspoken speech. A software based methodology for band-passing, pre-processing and classifying brain signals was developed within the OpenVIBE environment that can be used for future studies.

IMPROVING CELLULAR TRANSFECTION EFFICIENCY FOR NON-VIRAL GENE THERAPY
Mary Rose D'Agostine
McKinley Senior High School, Canton, OH

This project tests the effects heparin (a commonly used anticoagulant drug) on the rate of cellular transfection when used with synthetic delivery vectors for gene therapy. Research at a local University as involved improving the nanospheres as a delivery system for DNA, the DNA must first be combined (complexed) with linear poly-ethylenimine (LPEI) to stabilize and protect the DNA during the process. Heparin is a drug that separates the DNA from LPEI and is utilized when completing nanosphere loading and release studies. My hypothesis was that the addition of heparin would improve cellular transfection efficiency because the decomplexed pDNA would more easily enter the nuclei of targeted cells. In this experiment, small amounts of DNA complexed with LPEI are encapsulated inside the engineered nanospheres which are suspended in feeding media over fibroblast cells. In some wells heparin was added, to determine if the drug has any effect on cellular transfection efficiency when compared to wells without heparin. After desired incubation time, the cells plates were imaged and analyzed, comparing the number of transfected cells versus the total number of cells. Results were inconclusive, having done three separate trials all having somewhat varying results. It was not obtained whether or not heparin influences transfection rates. Studies will continue this summer to explore the effect of heparin on cellular transfection efficiency using non-viral delivery systems. Improving the efficiency of cellular transfection is a critical component for future use of non-viral vectors for gene therapy.

OPTIMIZATION OF HYDROXYAPATITE BIOCERAMICS DEPOSITED BY SUSPENSION PLASMA SPRAYING
Mathieu Fradet
Seminaire de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, Quebec, CANADA

Hydroxyapatite (HA, Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) is a material very often used to cover orthopaedic implants. Because of its excellent biocompatibility and osteoconductivity, HA helps to promote a quick initial osseointegration and a high interfacial bond between orthopaedic implants and bone. Nevertheless, it is still hard to control the characteristics of HA coatings, since their properties are determined by numerous processing variables. Also, the cost of HA coated orthopaedic implants is often very high. The objective of this project is to optimize the characteristics of the HA coatings used for orthopaedic applications. In this optic, the production of HA was improved by determining the best precursor’s proportions for its synthesis. Also, the feasibility to use high frequency suspension plasma spraying (HF-SPS) as an innovative deposition process to cover orthopaedic implants with HA was studied. Composition analyses have been carried by x-ray diffraction (XRD). The HA samples were analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to detect possible traces of contaminants. The biocompatibility of the HA was investigated by performing mice preoteoblasts cultures. The results show that HA produced with an excess of 9% H3PO4 is more crystalline and purer than traditional HA. Also, it has been demonstrated that HA nanocrystals formed with a 9% H3PO4 excess better resist to the high temperatures of HF-SPS. Nevertheless, some contaminants coming from the plasma torch are sprayed along with the HA, leading to a decrease in the HA samples biocompatibility. Therefore, manufacturing a plasma reactor in a way that would minimize the deposition of contaminants would be the next step to make HF-SPS a suitable alternative to produce HA coatings for orthopaedic devices.

DIAMOND SYNTHESES WITH NOBLE GASES THROUGH HOT FILAMENT CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION
Antonio Rodolph Bighetti Mei
Escola Americana de Campinas. Campinas, Sao Paulo. Brazil

The purpose of this project was to investigate the influence of Helium, Neon, and Argon gases on the formation and product of a diamond coat through the hot filament chemical vapor deposition process (HFCVD) and develop cheaper ways of creating diamond coats for commercial use. The characteristics of the diamonds created were analyzed through three main procedures: SEM images, Raman Scatterings, and photoluminescence tests. The hypothesis advocated that the addition of these gases will adulterate the product and may distort the diamond’s crystal lattice structure beyond recognition. <br><br>Most diamonds grown with more then 60% of a noble gas were discarded because their crystallites structure was too greatly adulterated. These samples were found to be DLCs, also known as Carbon like Diamonds. Generally, as the concentration of the noble gasses increased, the following major characteristics became present: the temperature of the substrate fell, the diamond grew faster. Specifically, Neon, at an optimized concentration, tends to stretch the crystals from an average width of 2 ìm to an average of 8 ìm; whereas Argon and Helium tend to from an amorphous structure at high concentrations (approximately above 70%).<br><br> These diamonds can be created at relatively low prices compared to natural diamonds, yet they still retain all the characteristics of natural diamonds: hardest material, according the Moss scale of Hardness, good insulators, can withstand astronomical temperatures, and are not rejected by organisms. Thus, they can be implemented in mere cutting utensils or used as implants to restore fractured bones.<br><br>

OPTICAL TACTILE SENSORS FOR MEDICAL PALPATION
Pencilla Lang
A. B. Lucas Secondary School, London, Ontario, Canada

The goal of this project is to design and prototype a fingertip-like tactile sensor for medical palpation. Doctors use palpation for many purposes. Stiffness provides information on the health of tissue (softness for cysts and hardness for tumors and scars), and aids in locating arteries and tying sutures. In minimally invasive surgery, endoscopic tools and surgical robots prevent surgeons from using palpation directly, hindering efficacy and increasing duration of procedures. Tactile sensors are required to reproduce the sense of touch and manipulate objects in a manner similar to the human fingertip. Such sensors can also enhance other remote manipulation applications.<br><br> The prototype sensor utilizes two new approaches: deformability and vision-based sensing. Hemi-spherical shells were fabricated by moulding silicone and geometric patterns were applied to the inner surface. A vision system detects the pattern and tracks the motion of features. The images are thresholded and skeletonized to segment the pattern. Pixels in the skeleton pattern are further segmented into groups of pixels representing intersection points or connecting lines. A graph model of the pattern topology was formed, and matched with a topological model of another image to determine matching features. After finding matching features, the motion of features is calculated. The resulting motion can potentially be used with a physics based model of the shell to determine deformation and forces. Alternative methods to creating deformable patterns were explored, including experimentation with the deformation of optical thin films through colour space. The prototypes demonstrate the feasibility of this optical tactile sensor design.

ROBOTS DON’T SUNBURN: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF UVB PROTECTIVE FACTORS
Jacob John Weaver
Highland Secondary School, Dundas, Ontario, CANADA

Overexposure to ultraviolet rays causes skin cancers and cataracts. People purchase expensive products presuming they will be protected from the sun. However, this may not be true. The health, financial and societal costs are substantial. The hypothesis is that all sunscreens, sun blocks and sunglasses are not equal and one brand might outperform another. Further, the hypothesis questioned whether a more expensive product would provide the extra protection one associates with increased cost and whether the higher sun protection factor (SPF) would provide enhanced protection over a sustained period. The effectiveness of each product is related to its ability to block UVB rays and prevent overexposure to skin and eyes. This hypothesis was tested by utilizing multiple product samples. <br><br>The procedure involved passing a sensor under five dishes; two control stations and three containing test samples. Several standardized controls were used to eliminate some of the variables associated with this project. These included using a continuous UVB light source and a robotic arm with a UVB sensor. The light was projected through the test samples and the robotic arm moved across the stations taking accurate readings at predetermined positions at regular intervals eliminating the human error factor during testing. Results were compared and analyzed to determine product durability, effectiveness and length of protection. <br><br>The hypothesis was incorrect. The products tested provided the same protection with slight variations under test conditions. Cost and brand is not a factor in product effectiveness therefore cheaper products may increase utilization by society at large.

CONTROL OF BLINKING IN COLLOIDAL QUANTUM DOTS USING A NON-MAGNETIC METAMATERIAL
Indroneil Roy
Francis Lewis High School, Fresh Meadows, NY

Fluorescence intermittency or “blinking” in semiconductor quantum dots hinder their advancement in applied uses as efficient size-dependent single photon sources for modern communications. The solution to control blinking was to utilize a non-magnetic anisotropic metamaterial that causes hyperbolic dispersion. Hyperbolic dispersion theoretically leads to infinite photon density of states that causes an increase in the rate of spontaneous emission through radiative decay pathways. Anisotropy was achieved by fabricating a metamaterial with three periods of titanium dioxide and silver such that the dielectric constant parallel to the plane of light polarization becomes negative, resulting in hyperbolic dispersion. Signal processing was used to determine blinking statistics of quantum dot samples on metamaterial and glass control. Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) was used to determine the lifetimes of both quantum dot samples. Previous research has experimentally found that inverse power-law dependence of intensity as a function of frequency of events indicates fluctuations in the emission spectrum of quantum dots, causing blinking. This research has concluded that with blinking statistics not showing an inverse power-law relationship along with a decrease in lifetime causing increase in spontaneous emission, the metamaterial has controlled, if not suppressed blinking.

TITANIUM DIOXIDE NANOFIBERS AND UV LIGHT PROTECTION
Jennifer Maria Reyna
Petra Mercado Bougart High School, Humacao, Humacao, PUERTO RICO

In this investigation titanium dioxide nanofibers (TiO2) also known as titania, were manufactured. The precursor solution consists of titanium (IV) propoxide, polyvinyl (acetate) as the polymer, acetic acid as a catalyst and dimethylformamide (DMF) as a solvent. To produce these nanofibers the electrospinning technique was used. After obtaining the nanofibers from the solution these are transfered to an oven at 450˚C for 30 minutes. After the nanofibers were sintered in hot air, various characterization tests were performed: X-ray diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and electrical current measurements. The TiO2 nanofibers have many applications, but the problem for this investigation was: Will a titanium dioxide nanofiber mat be effective protecting a nanofiber from ultraviolet light (UV)? The hypothesis was that a titanium dioxide nanofiber mat will be effective protecting a nanofiber from ultraviolet light (UV). To determine how effective the titania nanofibers mat was protecting from the UV light, a silicon plate (SnO2 nanofiber) was connected to a voltmeter to measure how the current flows through it in the presence and absence of TiO2. When the test was performed, UV light was used to determine if the titanium dioxide nanofiber can avoid UV light from reaching the SnO2 nanofiber. It is also evaluated how the nanofiber responds when the UV light is on or off and when it is off inmediately after being on. In this investigation the changes were evidenced and it was observed how the titanium dioxide nanofiber had an effect on the tin oxide nanofiber.

SMART: STATIC MICROPHONE ARRAYS FOR ROBOT TRACKING
Benjamin Alexander Schmidt
Centre Wellington District High School, Fergus, Ontario, Canada

The purpose of this project was to create a tracking system capable of estimating the angle of a receiver relative to a sound source using a stationary array of directional microphones.<br><br> First, I designed and tested a variable-frequency source and developed circuitry to allow a computer to measure the amplitude of the sound signal received by a microphone. I also needed a housing for the microphone that ensured that its sensitivity was directional. I evaluated many designs by using a computer-controlled turntable to measure the amplitude of the sound at increments of 7.5 degrees relative to the source. I simulated static arrays of smaller numbers of sensors by using a subset of this data, and developed an algorithm based on a polynomial regression to estimate the azimuthal angle of the sound source. Based on my simulation results, I built a radial array of sensors using seven microphones spaced 35 degrees apart, which I tested with different sensor housing dimensions and sound frequencies. The most accurate and precise angle estimations were obtained with a sensor housing consisting of a 4cm long tube and a cone with a 10.5cm diameter mouth, using a sound frequency of 2150 Hz. <br><br> The culmination of this project was a static array that could estimate the direction of the sound source with an accuracy of plus/minus 3 degrees. A similar system using directional radio antennae could be used to track wildlife, cellular phones or a robot exploring in hostile terrain.<br><br>

INVISIBILITY TWO STEPS CLOSER: AN ANALYSIS OF CYLINDRICALLY CONFINED DIBLOCK COPOLYMERS AND GOLD NANOCOMPOSITES FOR METAMATERIALS
Julia Beth Abelsky
North Springs Charter High School, Sandy Springs, GA

Scientists have been experimenting with the idea of invisibility since the 1950’s and the fictional concept came much closer to reality with the recent scientific research and latest technological developments in the new field of materials science. There are several studies currently ongoing dealing with invisibility but an invisibility cloak is still yet to hit store shelves. <br><br> Using Polystyrene-poly (methylmethacrylate) and under spherical and cylindrical confinement, it was possible to create a carpet cloak that manipulates the electromagnetic response of the surface and bends optical waves around the covered material. This diblock copolymer successfully cloaked objects under various frequencies of light- radio waves, in the microwave frequency range, infrared waves, and part of the visible spectrum (up to 550 nm). Invisibility is truly now two steps closer to reality.

THE EFFECTS OF MECHANICAL NANOPATTERNS ON HUMAN STEM CELL DIFFERENTIATION
Zohar Bachiry
Yeshiva University High School for Girls, Holliswood, NY

Stem cell research is particularly important because of its potential as a mechanism for regenerative medicine. In this study, dental pulp stem cells were plated on mechanical nanopatterns, which are scaffold-like surfaces on the nano-scale that contain both hard and soft topographies. Previous experimentation in scientific literature includes patterns of the micro-size, which are larger than the cells themselves, so they could maneuver and settle easily over the surfaces. This study, however, researches the effects of patterns of varying hard and soft topographies over an area smaller than the cells’ diameters. Moreover, the stretching of the actin fibers over these mechanically heterogeneous substrates was assessed and compared to their reaction on unpatterned surfaces. A further goal was to investigate if these mechanical nanopatterns would affect cell function; in particular, differentiation and biomineralization. Nanopatterns were created by spin-casting polymer blends onto a substrate made of silicon, and then sputtering away the thin films with an ion mill, thereby engraving a pattern into the silicon substrate. Confocal imaging showed that the actin fibers conformed to the shape of the patterns, resulting in an increase in the modulus of the cells; their actin fibers thereby hardened, which is an indicator of differentiation. The patterns also decrease the rate of biomineralization, but few mineral deposits are still found. Therefore, this evidence suggests that the patterns induce the cells to differentiate without the use of chemical inducers. This holds great potential in being able to strategically induce cells to differentiate for specific patients’ ailments and repair tissues.

OPTIMIZATION OF GRAPHENE SHEETS AS ELECTRODE MATERIALS FOR DYE-SENSITIZED SOLAR CELLS
Rahul Kumar
Germantown Academy, Fort Washington, PA

Graphene, a monolayer of sp2-bonded carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice, was investigated to elucidate its potential as an electrode material for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC). In this work, graphene sheets of varying areas were synthesized upon rectangular pieces of copper foil using the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique. Three types of DSSC devices were then created: (i) TiO2/Graphene/glass substrate as the anode and Pt/glass substrate as the cathode, (ii) TiO2/FTO/glass substrate as the anode and Graphene/FTO/glass substrate as the cathode, and lastly (iii) TiO2/FTO/glass substrate as the anode and Pt/glass substrate as the cathode with the purpose of comparing the efficiency of the graphene based solar cell with respect to that of the fluorine tin oxide (FTO) based solar cell. It was hypothesized that the control group, containing fluorine tin oxide as the electrode material, would have a lower efficiency as the graphene material has a higher transparency to incoming light and can be used on a wider variety of substrates. <br><br> It was shown that a successful large-scale graphene monolayer with functioning electrical properties can be synthesized utilizing the CVD process. The DSSC with a FTO-based electrode exhibited the greatest filling factor of all configurations, refuting the initial hypothesis. In order to increase the filling factors and efficiencies of graphene-based solar cells, the synthesis of the graphene monolayer needs to be further optimized. Overall, this experiment has allowed for us to understand the viability of the graphene monolayer as an electrode material in a DSSC.

BURITI FIBER. AN ALTERNATIVE TO STYROFOAM
Thiago Rodrigues de Anchieta Silva
C.E.F.M Dorgival Pinheiro de Sousa, Imperatriz, MA, BRASIL

Expanded polystyrene, commonly known as Styrofoam, comes to our homes in various forms. The problem is the damage it causes to the environment and the difficult acceptance for recycling. One of the problems of polystyrene is its composition: 98% air and 2% plastic. This means that, when melted, the final volume of the Styrofoam falls to 10% of what was collected. For this reason, most of the cooperatives and companies in the sector of recycling do not accept donations of small quantities of the product.<br><br>To reduce the amount of discarded material, I propose to use Mauritia flexuosa Buriti fibers as an alternative material to thermal insulation. The Buriti fibers are collected from their straw and therefore are renewable. Thus, their use is economically and environmentally viable and sustainable.<br><br>Laboratory tests showed the coefficient of thermal conductivity, by subjecting a heat flow in walls of the same shape, made of different materials: one of polystyrene and one of Buriti fiber. The coefficient determined for the fiber was 0,15W/m.K , whereas the Styrofoam coefficient is 0,13W/m.K.<br><br>I determined the specific temperature heating a mass of Buriti fiber with a greenhouse. I replaced the data in the fundamental equation of calorimetry, which resulted in 1100J/kg.K.<br><br>The physical-thermal properties of the Buriti material buriti proved to be a good alternative to Styrofoam. Its use is an alternative to reduce the environmental impacts of the modern world. The Mauritia flexuosa, is a specie widely used in food and traditional crafts of the pre-Amazon and Amazon regions. Future researches in this area can combine traditional local knowledge and science and technology, in favor of sustainable development.

ALUGLASS – NEW THERMOSTABLE MATERIAL FOR ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
Tsimafei Malakhouski
Public Educational Institution "Soligorsk Gymnasium #2", Soligorsk, BELARUS

I was thinking on substituting the expensive thermostable alloys of manganin and constantan, widely used in the production of electrical appliances, with a new inexpensive, and at the same time thermoatble material. It is known that the resistance of metal increases with the increase of temperature, but the resistance of semiconductor decreases with the increase of temperature. This fact led me to the hypothesis: if I melt metal and semiconductor, the dependence of the resistance on the temperature in this new alloy will be insignificant. <br><br>While experimenting to prove the above hypothesis, I received a new thermostable material by melting aluminum and glass including silicon oxide. In the results of 50 experiments series I identified the optimal 3:5 mass ratio for aluminum and glass to get aluglass. The crystallization of the alloy in a uniform electric field makes its resistance less dependent on temperature. I calculated the strength, resistivity and temperature coefficient of resistance and matched the data with tabular values. <br><br>I found that aluglass has a low temperature coefficient of resistance α = 0,000156 K-1, which is 21 times lower than that of aluminum. The resistivity of the produced material is 3 times lower than that of manganin and constantan. The strength of the material is 1.5 times higher than that of aluminum. <br><br>I consider that aluglass can easily substitute manganin and constantan alloys in manufacturing of electrical appliances. In addition, this low cost material may be produces from recycled pressed aluminum cans and cullet to solve some ecological problems.

STRONG SOIL: SAFE ROADS
Sarah Nicole Telehey
Trinity Christian School, Williston, ND

My question is how do sub-surface soils affect paved streets? My hypothesis is that the stronger the soil, the stronger the road. For this project, I received permission from the Williston City Engineer. He gave me specific roads to test. These roads include the following: County Road 9 which has a high percentage of oilfield trucks, East Dakota Parkway which has an average percentage of oilfield trucks, and the intersection of 18th St. W. and 14th Ave. which has no oilfield trucks. Then I went to each of these locations to find a California Bearing ratio (CBR) to quantify the strength of the soil. To do this, I used a dynamic cone pentrometer and a hammer drill. First, Lonni Fleck and my dad used their vehicles to set up traffic control. Next, I used the hammer drill to drill a hole through the pavement until I have hit soil. Then, I took the dynamic cone pentrometer and I recorded the penetration it made into the soil until I have gone 90 cm. (900 mm.) into the soil. This gave me my CBR. Then I filled the hole up with bentonite. My results were that County Road 9 had a CBR of 27 and 4, East Dakota Parkway had a CBR of 7 and 30, and 18th St. W, 14th Ave. had a CBR of 7. My conclusion is that the roads with stronger sub-surface soils were stronger than the roads with weak sub-surface soils. Therefore, my hypothesis was correct.

PRICKLY PEAR CACTUS MUCILAGE USED TO FILTER COPPER SULFATE FROM WATER
Heya Kaakeh
West Lafayette Junior/Senior High School, West Lafayette, IN

Copper can pollute water after corrosion of copper pipes, mining, discharge from industries,and smelting copper. The United States Environmental Protection Agency’s limit to copper sulfate is 1 ppm. Prickly pear cactus has mucilage that contains carbohydrates and that are able to attach to arsenic and make an arsenic-mucilage complex which swells and becomes heavy, unable to dissociate during the diffusion of water. Can Prickly Pear cactus mucilage filter copper contaminated water? Prickly pear cactus were diced. The parenchyma cells (white flesh between skin) were potato pressed releasing the mucilage that was used to filter the copper contaminated water. Beginning and final copper level results were tested by a liquid copper testing kit. Different techniques to extract the mucilage from the Nopal have been tried. Preliminary results shows that the mucilage has filtration capabilities.

ENDOCYTOSIS OF ORTHOPEDIC WEAR DEBRIS BY OSTEOBLASTS: PARTICLE SIZE-, TREATMENT TIME-, AND UPTAKE PATHWAY-DEPENDENCIES
Ian A. Hardy
Northern Utah Academy for Math, Engineering & Science, Layton, UT

Wear debris particles generated by the articulation of orthopedic implants have been implicated in implant loosening. Prior research has demonstrated that osteoblasts endocytose debris particles. The aim of this research is to confirm that osteoblasts endocytose particles of varying size, observe endocytosis of particles over time, and determine the effect of particle endocytosis inhibition on cell viability and membrane integrity. MG-63 cells were used as a model of primary osteoblasts. Fluorescently-tagged polystyrene microspheres of precise sizes were used as a surrogate for wear debris. Particle size and treatment time effects were observed using confocal microscopy. Membrane and nuclear stains were also used to better define particle uptake and localization. Transmission electron microscopy was used to confirm uptake. Images were analyzed to determine relative particle position inside cells. Various cytoskeletal and endocytosis inhibitors were used to determine pathway-dependency of particle uptake and the resulting changes in viability and membrane integrity. Data showed particle size-, treatment time-, and pathway-dependency of particle endocytosis. As treatment time increased, the number of particles present within the cells increased. Greater numbers of smaller particles were endocytosed than larger particles. When osteoblasts were treated with particles and endocytosis or cytoskeletal inhibitors, lactate dehydrogenase release decreased, indicating increased membrane integrity. Certain inhibitor treatments also increased cell viability. These data indicate that particle endocytosis is dependent on particle size and treatment time, and that the negative effects of orthopedic debris on bone cells could potentially be resolved by inhibitor treatment.

THE ACTUATOR
Michael David, Alexander Peters
Glenlon-Norfolk School, Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA

The purpose was to create a practical device that passively exercises the lower legs to help prevent blood clots, Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), in wheelchair-bound individuals of any age. The secondary purpose of the device is to improve range of motion of the lower legs and speed the recovery of their leg action. It is hoped that this invention would help to prevent Deep Vein Thrombosis, and allow some people to even use their legs again through use of passive, or active, movement of the leg muscles. The Actuator is a simple to use, easy to install invention that does a great job of keeping the user’s legs in motion while using the wheelchair. It is a portable device that attaches to the front of any wheelchair. Through passive or active motion a person's legs are exercised while the wheelchair is in motion. The inventor's grandmother had developed DVT's in 2005, and passed away because of them. Had she been given an Actuator it may have prevented the terrible way she died. Her death was the driving force behind the project. The idea for this project really started at this time when I was 13 years old, and now I have had a chance to make that dream a reality. The project is dedicated to her memory. Over the time period that this project has been in process I have come to realize the true potential of this invention. I truly believe that it will revolutionize the way that we treat people in wheelchairs, and the way people in wheelchairs can treat themselves.

REPLICATION OF DANAUS PLEXIPPUS SCALES FOR USE IN DYE-SENSITIZED SOLAR CELLS
Elsa Rachel Kunz
Saint Joseph Central High School, Saint Joseph, MO

The goal of this investigation was to examine the properties of the Danaus plexippus wing to obtain a microstructure photoanode for use in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Monarch wings were observed under FESEM microscope. They were then pretreated to remove chitinous substances and dipped into a precursor solution of tetraetyhlorthosilicate (TEOS). The butterfly wing was sintered onto a titanium dioxide pasted substrate of indium tin oxide glass (ITO). A blackberry dye was added, and energy output (mv) was measured and compared to a control DSSC. It was found that the DSSC without the wing yielded a higher performance. This was contributed to the raised thickness structure between the anode and cathode in the cell. Relative intensity data was gathered from a spectrophotometer to measure light changes of each step of the cell construction process (i.e. substrate; substrate and titanium dioxide; substrate and titanium dioxide, and wing, etc). However, the scale geometry from the FESEM exhibited the roof-tile pattern evident in light-trapping butterflies. Therefore, it was concluded that the Danaus plexippus wing is a viable option for a biomimetic model of scale geometry for use in future solar cells.

SENSOR FOR ORGANIC RESIDUES ON ALUMINUM SURFACES
Christoph Wiesinger

For the process of rolling aluminum sheets, oils are required to lubricate the sheet surface.<br><br>In many cases it is essential for the metal surface to be generally clean of oil or other organic substances to prevent costly problems at further working steps. (e.g. soldering, welding, painting)<br><br>Therefore the aluminum sheets are cleaned by passing through an oil-removal procedure, which is decreasing in effectiveness over time. It is possible that the oil-removal process is not effective enough, increasing the risk of customers dissatisfaction and product reclamation. Furthermore, there is no adequate measurement system in place able to obtain sufficient quantitative information about the amount of residual organics on sheet aluminum surfaces, with only a few mg on each m2.<br><br>The developed system works in the following way: The oils and lubricants on the sheet surface are evaporated/decomposed by heating the aluminum surface at selective points under hermetic conditions. The emerging vapor/decomposition mixture is then passed into a high sensitivity flame-ionization detector, which is able to gather quantitative information about the organic compounds in the vaporized mixture and hence about the contamination of the aluminum sheet. <br><br>The system is able to produce highly accurate information about the amount of organic residues on the sheet surface, saving time and money for aluminum producers. The calculated detection limit is only a few µg/ m2.<br><br>The current stage of experimentation shows that this system already obtains the required information as a discontinuous laboratory setup, which could serve as the forerunner of a highly accurate inline process monitoring system.

LAYER-BY-LAYER SELF ASSEMBLY TO DEVELOP DNA BASED BIOMATERIAL FOR FUEL CELL APPLICATION
Kimberly Renee McRae
Spring Valley High School, Columbia, SC

Direct methanol fuel cells are the best contenders of alternative energy. Low efficiency occurs when methanol leaks through the membrane to the cathode. Layer-by-layer self-assembly is an environmentally friendly and inexpensive method of creating multilayer thin films. The cornerstone of this research was to create a DNA based biomaterial for fuel cell application. Poly (amine hymaline), Poly (acrylic acid), and DNA were sequentially assembled onto a substrate at conditions with pH levels of 4 and 7, and NaCl concentrations of 0M, 0.1M, and 0.5M. The frequency shift was measured after every layer using a Quartz Crystal Microbalance. The absorbance of the material, using optimum conditions, was measured using a UV-vis spectrometer. The surface morphology was examined using an Atomic Force Microscope. It was hypothesized that a pH of 7 and NaCl concentration of 0.5 M, DNA would be the optimum conditions. The following parameters were used to come to the conclusion of the optimum conditions; the greatest frequency and intensity shift, and surface roughness. The study showed that a pH of 7; t(22)= -9.19, p<0.001, and a NaCl concentration 0.5M allowed the most DNA to deposit; t(14)= -15.11, p<0.001. It was hypothesized that this material would be able to modify the Nafion™ membrane for use in fuel cells. SEM images of film thickness were taken, and the Nafion™ membrane achieved the desired thickness under the prior conditions.

SENSOR FOR ORGANIC RESIDUES ON ALUMINUM SURFACES
Christoph Wiesinger
HTL Braunau, Braunau/Inn, AUSTRIA

For the process of rolling aluminum sheets, oils are required to lubricate the sheet surface.<br><br>In many cases it is essential for the metal surface to be generally clean of oil or other organic substances to prevent costly problems at further working steps. (e.g. soldering, welding, painting)<br><br>Therefore the aluminum sheets are cleaned by passing through an oil-removal procedure, which is decreasing in effectiveness over time. It is possible that the oil-removal process is not effective enough, increasing the risk of customers dissatisfaction and product reclamation. Furthermore, there is no adequate measurement system in place able to obtain sufficient quantitative information about the amount of residual organics on sheet aluminum surfaces, with only a few mg on each m2.<br><br>The developed system works in the following way: The oils and lubricants on the sheet surface are evaporated/decomposed by heating the aluminum surface at selective points under hermetic conditions. The emerging vapor/decomposition mixture is then passed into a high sensitivity flame-ionization detector, which is able to gather quantitative information about the organic compounds in the vaporized mixture and hence about the contamination of the aluminum sheet. <br><br>The system is able to produce highly accurate information about the amount of organic residues on the sheet surface, saving time and money for aluminum producers. The calculated detection limit is only a few µg/ m2.<br><br>The current stage of experimentation shows that this system already obtains the required information as a discontinuous laboratory setup, which could serve as the forerunner of a highly accurate inline process monitoring system.

EXPLOITING OSMOSIS FOR BLOOD CELL SORTING WITH MICROFLUIDIC DEVICES
Vinay Ashok Raj
duPont Manual High School, Louisville, KY

Blood is a valuable tissue containing cellular populations rich in information<br><br>regarding the immediate immune and inflammatory status of the body. Blood leukocytes<br><br>or white blood cells (WBCs) provide an ideal sample to monitor systemic changes and<br><br>understand molecular signaling mechanisms in disease processes. Blood samples need to<br><br>be processed to deplete contaminating erythrocytes or red blood cells (RBCs) and sorted<br><br>into different WBC sub-populations prior to analysis. This is typically accomplished<br><br>using immuno-affinity protocols which result in undesirable activation.<br><br>An alternative is size based sorting which by itself is unsuitable for WBCs sorting<br><br>due to size overlap between different sub-populations. To overcome this limitation, using<br><br>controlled osmotic exposure to deplete and/or create a differential size increase between<br><br>WBC populations was investigated. Using a new micro-fluidic cell docking platform, the<br><br>response of RBCs and WBCs to de-ionized (DI) water was evaluated.<br><br>Time lapse microscopy confirms depletion of RBCs within 15 s and creation<br><br>of >3μm size differences between lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes. A flow<br><br>through micro-fluidic device was also used to expose different WBCs to DI water for 30,<br><br>60 and 90 s to quantify cell loss and activation. Results confirm preservation of ~100%<br><br>of monocytes, granulocytes and loss of ~30% of lymphocytes (mostly CD3+/CD4+) with<br><br>minimal activation. These results indicate feasibility of this approach for monocyte,<br><br>granulocyte and lymphocyte (sub-populations) isolation based on size.

HOW POP BOTTLE CONCRETE IS AFFECTED BY THE WEATHER
Brandon Lee Herrick
Franklin Public Schools, Franklin, NE

The purpose of my project is to see if my Pop Bottle Concrete is affected by different weathering conditions. Pop Bottle Concrete has already proved to be just as strong with the pop bottle pellets added, but I am curious to see if the weather will affect the strength. I hypothesize that the samples in the hot climate would dry out, becoming brittle, and cracking at a lower psi then the control climate. I also hypothesize that samples in the cold climate will not fully harden because of the lack of heat for drying time. I also hypothesize that in all climates the Pop Bottle Concrete will act equally as the control cylinders in the same climate. I made 18 concrete samples that contained both plastic pellets and nothing for the control. I let them sit for a week in normal 60°F weather to simulate perfect poring conditions. After the 7-day time trial I split them up into their different climate zones to sit for another week. 6 samples went into a cold climate area (-10°F), 6 samples stayed in the control climate area (60°F), and 6 samples went to a hot climate are (100°F). After two weeks, I took the samples and crushed them under a hydraulic press and measured them in psi. In conclusion the plastic concrete did overall better in all of the climate zones. The concrete reacted the same in every climate zone, but the plastic concrete had a higher compression average on every climate test.

ECO-FABRIC FROM BLENDED FRAGRANT SCREW PINE (PANDANUS AMARYLLIFOLIUS) LEAF FIBERS AND COTTON
Elson Ian Nyl Ebreo Galang
Philippine Science High School- Southern Mindanao Campus, Davao, Davao del Sur, PHILIPPINES

Cotton-polyester fabric is manufactured to alleviate increase in cotton prices. However, polyester production faces issues such as denaturalization of materials, energy usage, and increase in carbon footprints. The purpose of the study was to find indigenous fibers which can become a new standalone fiber for fabric production or as a blend with cotton to produce a new all-natural fabric. Ultimate leaf fibers from the tropical fibrous plant Pandanus amaryllifolius (Pandan, belonging to screw-pine family) were extracted through retting and the basic properties of the fiber were assessed, revealing the following: low breaking strength, good cohesion, good fineness and a staple length of 13.11 inches. Economic value was also determined by calculating its fiber yield, which was found to be 7.1%, the highest among the current commercially used fibers. An 80/20 Cotton-Pandan Philippine Tropical Fabric (PTF) was produced at the country's textile research institute and assessed on weight, breaking strength, pilling resistance and dimensional change, and color fastness to rubbing, perspiration and laundering. Results of each analysis were compared with the Philippine National Standard for PTFs. The newly produced fabric of Cotton-Pandan fabric showed the following properties: fabric weight ideal for blouses and pants, good breaking strength, exhibits shrinkage, has low pilling resistance, good colorfastness and non-staining ability. The results proved that the ultimate fiber from P. amaryllifolius cannot be a standalone fiber for fabric production but it is a good and economically sound blend to cotton for the production of a new PTF.

H.E.R.E. HUMAN ENDANGERMENT RECOGNITION EQUIPMENT: A POSSIBLE METHOD TO REDUCE FATALITIES CAUSED BY CHILDREN BEING LEFT INSIDE OF VEHICLES
Kelly Maria Shelts
Bartlesville High School, Bartlesville, OK

This project is H.E.R.E., an acronym for Human Endangerment Recognition Equipment, a study on a possible method to reduce fatalities caused by children being left inside of hot vehicles. The goal of the project was to create an alarm that will sound if the level of CO2 and temperature inside a vehicle reach a certain point and to perform tests to determine what the levels should be. The test included five test subjects: two adults, two canines, and one minor. The subjects were asked to sit inside of the test vehicle with the sensors for 20 minutes in the first test, and 40 minutes in the second test. The data collected from the tests included fluctuations in O2, CO2, and temperature. The results from the second test were used in the development of the conclusion and the programming of the prototype. The data collected showed no significant change in oxygen percentage, but significant fluctuations in CO2, supporting the feasibility of this method in a real life situation if CO2 was the determinant. A prototype was then made using a Vernier SensorDAQ, a Vernier CO2 sensor, and a Vernier temperature probe. This device was programmed with Labview software and attached to a light and buzzer system that was activated when the level of CO2 exceeded 900 parts per million and the temperature surpassed 90 degrees Fahrenheit. The prototype was tested and proven functional.

INNOVATIVE USE OF ANAEROBIC EFFECTIVE MICROORGANISMS FOR NATURAL RUBBER LATEX COAGULATION
Suppachai Nindum
Khunhanwittayasan School, Khunhan, Sisaket, THAILAND

Field latex coagulum, cup lump rubber widely used in various industries, has generally been prepared by using formic acid as coagulant. However, the acid causes some drawbacks such as high cost, time-consuming coagulation, toxicity, and environmental harm. In this study, the coagulation of NR latex, using anaerobic effective microorganisms (EM) was examined. The effective microorganisms derived from wastes of fruits and vegetables were investigated. There were three major findings. First, both types of effective microorganisms could coagulate NR latex effectively in a very short time, 10 times faster than the coagulation using formic acid, and 360 times faster than that degraded biologically. Second, determined based on the ISO standard test method, the properties, dirt content, ash content, volatile matter, nitrogen content, initial plasticity (P0), plasticity retention index (PRI) and Mooney viscosity of the cup lump rubber derived from EM were not significantly different from those properties of the cup lump rubber samples derived from traditional formic acid; however, they showed much higher qualities of the rubbers, compared to the cup lump rubber coagulated without the coagulants. Last and, perhaps, most important, the coagulation of NR latex through anaerobic effective microorganisms also helped rubber farmers reduce the cost of production (roughly 50%), compared to the production by formic acid. The findings suggest that the cup lump rubber produced through anaerobic effective microorganisms should be of use to both individual rubber farmers and industrial sectors.

A NOVEL FIBER OPTIC SENSOR FOR THE DETECTION OF DIABETES IN POOR COUNTRIES
Charlotte Wang
The Mississippi School for Mathematics & Science, Columbus, MS

In poor countries, blood glucose meters and urine glucose tests are not affordable or not readily available. Millions of diabetic people remain undiagnosed until complications become life threatening. An affordable, easy-to-use, and non-intrusive glucose sensor is needed to save people in poor countries from undetected diabetes. The objective of this research project is to develop a novel fiber optic glucose sensor to measure the glucose level in urine for noninvasive, rapid, and convenient diabetic screening. The glucose sensor is based on high sensitivity fiber loop ringdown technology in conjunction with selective chemical coating to achieve high sensitivity and low false alarm urine glucose level screening. In this presentation, the results to demonstrate the scientific feasibility of the fiber glucose sensor (Phase I) are presented. The sensor is as small as a fiber line and will be affordable for people in poor countries.

PREVENTING TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURIES FROM HELMET TO HELMET COLLISION, BY USING NASA PRODUCED MEMORY FOAM AND REDIRECTING ENERGY ABSORBED DURING IMPACT
Taylor-Alexandria Miracle Dorsey
Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Baltimore, MD

A wide range of head injury risks are present in sports, especially in football. These risks can escalate into actual injuries; which can lead to permanent brain damage. Current data shows that permanent brain damage can occur at 10 g’s or higher. The emphasis of this research focus on the energy absorption capacity of elastic foam to drastically reduce energy transferred to the brain from collisions. Brain/Skull structures were simulated using testing dummies by redirecting energy would help lower the risks of these injuries from collisions to the brain. Specific impact points can be determined by calculating the forces of collisions transferred to the brain. Experimental and simulated calculations were performed including G-force, momentum, speed of impact, and mass of the helmet test apparatus design to reduce skull and brain injuries. The methodology included five different prototypes to test for functionality of the different elastic materials and their effectiveness on stopping and redirecting energy to the skull/brain injuries. The experimental studies contained front, side, rear, and top impacts.<br><br> The reduction the accelerometer reading within the test dummies head structure was significant reducing the G-forces beyond 50% rate for most professional and collegiate helmets at g-forces of 50 or higher. The most significant impact of the research findings is that the elasticity physics calculation supported the reduction of energy transfer from the helmet to the test dummy skull/ brain structure. The experimental results showed promise toward reduction G-forces with specific designed helmets with the capacity to absorb and redirect energy.

USING WASTE TELEVISIONS AND CRT TUBES IN HEAVYWEIGHT CONCRETE FOR RADIATION SHIELDING
Muhammet Can Sayar
Private Beylikduzu Fatih High School, Istanbul, marmara, TURKEY

Electronic waste is increasing day by day in parallel with the advancements in technology. This waste causes great environmental problems globally. Today, LCD televisions are replacing tube televisions in all countries of the world. Similarly, CRT monitors of the computers are being replaced by LCD monitors. Most of the electronic waste is used as raw materials of another product after being recycled. In this research, television and CRT screens, which make up 20% of the world’s electronic waste, were used. The back glass of the television and CRT screens were processed and made ready to use. First, the dimension of the grains was decided. CEM I 42.5R cement, which is used in heavyweight concrete, was preferred. Similarly, sand whose grains are smaller than 2 mm was used. In all the concrete series, different percentages (in terms of weight) of glass were used, with the ratio of water/cement always remaining at 0.6. From the samples that were prepared, the concrete series of different thickness were obtained. <br><br> The mass reduction coefficients of the concrete series that were obtained in different percentages were found out by using Cs-137 source. The mass reduction coefficients were found as; 26,8202 in 0%, 27,7656 in 10%, 28,5878 in 20%, 29,1869 in 30% , 30,2151 in 40%, 31,4666 in 50% and 32,5260 in 60%. It was found out that the mass reduction coefficients increased in proportion to the percentage of glass. In addition, the pressure endurance values were measured by using cube samples. Thus, we have shown that waste television and CRT tubes that can cause an environmental disaster can be recycled.

SUPER-EGG : SIMPLE AND INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY FOR TRADITIONAL PRESERVED FOOD
Mohammad Pandi Alam
SMA Negeri 2 Jombang, Jombang, Jawa Timur, INDONESIA

Salted duck egg is very popular, healthy and traditional preserved food in Indonesia and another Asian countries. However, the traditional process is time consuming and less controllable which in<br><br>general lead to shorter expiry and lower quality. Moreover, it also requires more human works (brushing process, etc) and sometimes chemical additive as KNO3.<br><br>In this project, a new method based on steam equipment to make salted duck egg as preserved food is developed. The invention is enable producing salted-egg in much-shorter time with longer expiry and better quality. The newly developed mechanism can be adopted using home equipment like rice-cooker. On other hand it can also be scaled-up to be a dedicated "steam equipment" suitable for salted-egg home industry.<br><br>It is argued that the method has several advantages : speed up the process (from 12-14 days to 1-2 days); producing desired taste through temperature control; more cost-effective either for personal use or home industry; and no need of chemical additive nor booster at all.

NON-NEWTONIAN BULLET RESISTANT
Amira Moustafa Badran
Dar El Tarbiah American School, Cairo, EGYPT

My aim is to experiment the non-Newtonian liquid and measure all its conditions and control its variables to prove that it is a suitable form of liquid that can be filled in a bullet proof vest and, at the same time, cheap and comfortable to the wearer. I, first, experimented the liquid and exposed it to temperature conditions and other variables. I researched the thickness required in order to resist a bullet and I provided some kinds of bullets that require a certain velocity. I used the viscometer, to measure viscosity, and a thermometer, to measure the room temperature. After I have put water in a big bowl/container and added corn starch until the water became extremely tough to stir. I felt an initial resistance by the fluid which was slowly released as soon as I stopped forcing pressure on it.I, then, concluded that a thick mixture of cornstarch and water behaves like this: move slowly and it can be stirred easily, pound it suddenly and its locks up into a dry solid. The mixture of cornstarch and water turned out to be a typical non-Newtonian liquid that is simply done and cheaply bought .If a fluid turns to solid when force is applied to it, then it makes much more sense to ‘wear it’ as an armor ,and that's what I am trying to prove in my project.Fluids of this sort could be applied to a bullet resistant body armor, for their ability to absorb the energy of a high velocity projectile impact but remain soft and flexible while worn.

SAVE THE THREE-LEGGED DOGS: MYOELECTRIC PROSTHETIC'S FOR DOGS
Moriah Ka'iulani Jenkins
Molokai High School, Ho'olehua, HI

50,000 dogs loose a limb each year. These limb amputations are due to diseases such as canine bone cancer (osteosarcoma), accident caused limb trauma, and other factors. This is a problem for dogs everywhere. The trauma factor of losing a limb alters the dogs balance and causes problems in their gate. My science fair project this year is “Could a myoelectric limb be beneficial and reduce trauma in dogs with an amputated limb?” I researched the possibilities of a Myoelectric Prosthetic currently only used for humans. A Myoelectric Prosthetic uses electromyography signals or potentials from voluntary contracted muscles within the user’s amputated limb on the surface of the skin to control the movements of the prosthesis, such as limb flexion and extension. A myoelectric limb utilizes the remaining neuromuscular system of the limb to control the functions of an electric powered prosthetic. The prosthetic connects to the amputation by a self-suspending socket with pick up. My project assimilated this information and adapted it to the anatomy of the prosthetic so it would apply to a dog. This year I made revisions to my 3D model of what the limb would look like for a fore limb, hind limb, and paw amputation. To do this I used Google-Sketchup. As part of my continuation project, I also created a working prototype of a myoelectric prosthetic incorporating a new technology called Muscle Wire.

DOOR STOPPER HINGE
Chun Hei Lau
Tsuen Wan Government Secondary School, Hong Kong, HONG KONG

There have been many different kinds of devices for keeping a door from shutting accidentally; from the simple door wedge to the very sophisticated hydraulic device that is built in to the door. All these devices have their restrictions and can vary widely in costs and installation methods. <br><br>This new invention –“Door Stopper Hinge”, combines the functions of a wedge and a door hinge to satisfy different purposes. This device is installed onto a door just like an ordinary butt hinge and does not require drilling holes into walls or floors. It also solves the common problem of having a lost door wedge.<br><br>The “Door Stopper Hinge” operates by opening the door to the desired and preset angle. The door will automatically stay opened at that angle without it closing accidentally. This works due to an innovative and specially designed lath installed inside the shaft of the hinge. To close the door, a lever installed by the shaft of the hinge is lifted and the door can be swung closed.<br><br>The building cost to make this product is very low as its structure is simple and easily manufactured. Users also only need to install one “Door Stopper Hinge” to replace one of the traditional butt hinges on the door without having to remove the whole door.<br><br>This device can be installed in all doors that are fixed by hinges and can solve many daily problems and prevent accidents that are caused by doors being closed accidentally.

ENGINEERING E. COLI FOR BIOSYNTHESIS OF HYDROCARBONS
Suman Gunasekaran
James Madison Memorial Senior High School, Madison, WI

Biosynthesis of hydrocarbons is a promising alternative to the continued extraction and processing of fossil fuels. Bacteria can convert fatty acids into unsaturated hydrocarbons such as olefins, which can be used as a biofuel or a chemical building block. Our goal is to genetically modify Escherichia coli (E. coli) to produce olefins by incorporating a heterologous olefin-forming enzyme (OFE) that is involved in the biosynthesis of olefins in cyanobacteria. The gene encoding the OFE was cloned into an engineered expression plasmid that coupled OFE translation to a kanamycin resistance gene. The plasmid was transformed into E. coli DH10B and OFE translation was detected by monitoring growth in the presence of kanamycin. OFE protein expression was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis. When a plasmid containing OFE gene (~9kb) was transformed into E. coli, cells were susceptible to all levels of kanamycin, indicating that the OFE was not fully translated. Since olefin synthesis uses three steps, fatty acid loading, elongation, and decarboxylation, the OFE gene was divided into three corresponding DNA segments and individually cloned. E. coli expressing the loading unit and elongation unit, both individually and together, was resistant to kanamycin and produced proteins of expected size. However, the decarboxylation unit was not successfully expressed in E. coli even when it was divided into two subunits. These results have demonstrated that the decarboxylation unit is not readily translated in E. coli and must undergo protein engineering before producing olefins. To improve the translation efficiency, mutations will be introduced into the decarboxylation unit sequence. With increased translation efficiency, the OFE gene will be expressed in E. coli and enable olefin production.

ON SHAKY GROUND: A STUDY OF STRUCTURAL STRENGTH DURING EARTHQUAKE SIMULATIONS
Jose J. Gomez
Saginaw Arts and Sciences Academy, Saginaw, MI

The purpose of this experiment was to determine which type of structure was the strongest during earthquake simulations. Ultimately, the goal was to apply this research to apartment building-sized structures for application in high-risk residential areas. <br><br> Three types of structures were modeled and tested in this experiment: untrussed structures, x-braced structures, and central-tube structures. Untrussed structures were the control, and represent buildings with no built-in reinforcement. X-braced structures are more commonly used in high-risk areas, and tube structures are also used for similar situations. However, tube structures are often applied in skyscrapers because they reduce the need of internal columns, providing much more open space (which can be used as office space). This led to the hypothesis that the x-braced structure would be the strongest, the tube the second strongest, and the cube structure the weakest. <br><br> A shake table was designed and created to test each building, and a motion sensor and accelerometer were used to capture data. The data recorded suggest that the hypothesis was partially supported; the cube structure was clearly the weakest, but the x-braced and tube structures were quite close. Unfortunately, the shake table failed before conclusive data could be recorded on the tube structure. However, the tube structure was cheaper to construct than the x-braced structure, and it is still possible that it will prove to be as strong, if not stronger.

THE PLANT KINGDOM AS A NATURAL ALTERNATIVE FOR CAR MOTOR OIL, PHASE II
Katia Yarie Hernandez - Gomez
Jose Campeche High School, San Lorenzo, PUERTO RICO

Motor oil is a high cost petroleum product that causes serious contamination problems and it is very difficult to dispose of it. For these alarming reasons in Phase I of this research a plant leaves car motor oil was created. It demonstrated to have the same lubricating characteristics, performance and effectiveness of commercial motor oil from petroleum derivates such as 10-W-30 and 10-W-40. Phase II of this investigation intended to find out if there can be a suitable performance of a car engine simulator using the plant leaves motor oil. The hypothesis was that the plant leaves motor oil will maintain a similar or an equal effective and functional performance of a car engine simulator, just as car motor oil based on petroleum does.<br><br> <br><br>Three car engine simulators of 500 RPM, 1,200 RPM and 3,100 RPM were prepared to perform tests on temperature and protection against machine parts wear. These tests indicated the lubricating effectiveness of the two types of motor oil, their resistance at high temperatures and their properties to prevent damages such as breaking, wearing, melting or deforming the moving machine parts. The temperature tests of the different machines had a difference of only 0.37°F, 1.5°F and 10°F respectively between the two types of oil. None of the three car engine simulators suffered any measurable damages with the two types of car motor oil. The conclusion was that the plant leaves motor oil maintained an equal effective and functional performance of a petroleum based car motor oil.

IMPROVED PORTABLE BURN TREATMENT UNIT: TESTING SIMULATION
Gabriel Francisco Justiniano
Guamani Private School, Guayama, PUERTO RICO

Conventional burn treatments require the cleaning of wounds using a therapeutic whirlpool. Can a portable burn treatment unit be used to treat small burns as effectively as a full sized whirlpool? The hypothesis is that a small prototype will be able to duplicate the variables of the normal sized whirlpool and be effective in the simulation tests that it will undergo. Instead of submerging the patient into the whirlpool ,even if it is a small burn, the prototype can be placed around the burned area and water will flow inside its contact chamber treating the wound. To be able to do the work effectively the portable unit needs to be capable of performing the same therapeutic treatment as a standard whirlpool providing adequate water and temperature. After investigating the operating conditions of a normal whirlpool, a prototype was built. It was verified that the appropriate operating conditions were achieved. The prototype was then tested by a series of simulations to determine if it was able to duplicate the variables of a full sized whirlpool. Based on the work and observations, a portable effective Burn Healer was built. It can be concluded that the unit was able to duplicate the variables of a full sized whirlpool and was effective on the simulations it underwent.

A NEW NOTEBOOK COMPUTER CPU COOLING DEVICE
Shaoxuan Wang
Xuejun High School, Hangzhou, China

With CPU speed going faster and faster, heat generated by CPU is also increasing. If the CPU temperature is too high, interfering signal will be produced. It may damage internal components, resulting in a decrease in CPU speed, or even computer crash. Nowadays, as the notebook size is getting smaller and smaller, heat dissipation becomes more prominent. Heat dissipation has always been one of the largest technical bottlenecks in designing notebook PCs.<br><br>The goal of my project is to explore the possibility of designing such a device, which enables fast cooling of CPU to solve the problem mentioned above.<br><br>The cooling device designed by me consists of a heat collector, a centrifugal brushless micro liquid pump and a radiator. They are all integrated. The heat collector attaches to the surface of the CPU tightly. A micro liquid pump, which was rebuilt from a brushless micro motor, with methanol as the medium, transfers heat generated on CPU to the heatsink to dissipate heat. Its advantages are: small size, long life span, fast heat dissipation, no switching-over sparks and no electromagnetic interference, moreover, the motor and the pump are integrated.<br><br>The CPU temperature used to exceed 80 degrees Celsius very often. Now using the cooling device, we can keep the highest temperature below 45 degrees Celsius. The result of heat dissipation is prominent. Therefore this is a new, highly effective notebook CPU cooling device.<br><br>

PLGA NANOPARTICLES ENCAPSULATING ANTI-VASCULAR SMALL MOLECULES FOR THE TREATMENT OF BREAST CANCER
Evan C. Smith
Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, Baltimore, MD

Cancer, the rapid division of cells due to an imbalance of division and apoptosis, can form malignant tumors and metastasize readily. Myriads of medical complications from malignant tumors may prove life threatening. Anti-Cancer formulations range from cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs, to radiation, to surgical excision; however, for various reasons some or all of these treatments may be futile. Commonly, chemotherapy is one of the most promising treatments and is often a first line of defense. Doxorubicin and Acriflavine are small molecule drugs that inhibit angiogenesis which starves cancerous tumors of necessary oxygen and nutrients; however Acriflavine and Doxorubicin are still dangerous to healthy cells and are associated with toxicity. Toxicity can prove lethal and can greatly reduce quality of life for patients. Controlling the drug release profile can potentially reduce the damage to healthy non-target cells and increase the quality of life for patients. With this intent, we sequester the drug by nanoparticle-encapsulation in a hydrolytically degradable polymer, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). Sequestering the free drug limits systemic toxicity making the drug safer. Additionally it provides a slow controlled release that would reduce the frequency a patient would have to visit their doctor for injections, increasing convenience and reducing healthcare costs. The physical characterization of the drug-encapsulated PLGA nanoparticles as well as the drug release profiles will be discussed in this presentation for their use in breast cancer treatment.

PROTECTION OF WOODEN MATERIALS AGAINST UV RADIATION USING ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY SESAME AND JOJOBA OILS
Yunus Ibrahim Alayli
Private Fatih High School, Istanbul, Marmara, TURKEY

Factors like photochemical degradation affect wooden materials. UV light enters into reaction to start the color change and degradation of lignin.In this study,black poplar (Populus nigra) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) trees that grow in our country were chosen.150 samples with the dimensions of 65x60x5mm from the trees mentioned above were prepared.These samples were submerged in the jojoba and sesame oils of different proportions. The same thing was repeated with natural oils modified by ZnO and TiO2.A similar procession was applied with varnish in order to compare the UV effect.Then, the samples that dried were kept under UV light for 100 hours.Then, the color change that took place on the wood samples was measured by Data Color 110 color spectrophotometry device based on the CIELAB Standard (1976).According to the results of the measurements, the color difference for the black poplar was measured as (DE 6,38).The best mixture for it was found to be 5% jojoba oil and 95% sesame oil. It was measured as (DE:5,49) in the mixture of 5% ZnO/95% jojoba oil.It was measured as DE: 3,73 for the pine in the mixture of 5%TiO2/95% sesame oil.It was DE: 3,77 for sesame oil mixture.When all of the results that were obtained were evaluated,The best mixture of natural oil for the poplar was determined as 5% jojoba oil /95% sesame oil.The best mixture for the pine was found to be 5% ZnO/ 95% jojoba oil.Moreover, the surface chemistry and SEM examination of the best pine sample (5% ZnO /95% jojoba) and poplar sample (5% jojoba oil/95% sesame oil) were carried out by FT-IR.All of the measurements in the study were performed in the BioNano Technology Center of Fatih University.

FANTASTIC CORN PLASTIC: THE EFFECT OF VARIOUS ADDITIVE MATERIALS ON THE TENSILE STRENGTH OF CORN STARCH BIOPLASTIC
Kurt Robert Dunham
Cookeville High School, Cookeville, TN

Converting the sugar in corn and other starch-based plants into polymer bioplastics offers an environmentally-friendly, renewable alternative to making plastics from toxic petroleum oil. However, one frequent criticism of corn starch bioplastic is that it is brittle and not as strong as petroleum-based plastic. Fantastic Corn Plastic was an experimental study testing the effect of various additive materials on the tensile strength of corn starch bioplastic. Samples of corn starch bioplastic film were created using three different additives: glycerol (#1), sugar (#2), and glue (#3). The absence of an additive served as the control (#4). A test of tensile strength was performed on each sample of bioplastic, with three trials conducted for each experimental group. The results showed that the use of additive materials altered the properties of the bioplastic film, and in some cases, made it stronger. The additive, glue (#3), produced samples of bioplastic film with the greatest average tensile strength (4.9 MPa), followed by (#2) sugar (3.7 MPa), and finally, (#1) glycerol (0.3 MPa) when compared to the control (#4) (2.8 MPa). The results highlight the importance of additive materials in changing the properties of bioplastic. The strength of the glue and sugar additives and the flexibility of the glycerol additive suggest that testing a combination of additives should be studied in the future. In an effort to end America’s dependence on foreign oil and to better promote renewable, green technologies, creating plant-based bioplastic that possesses satisfactory tensile strength for a myriad of industrial applications remains one of the top challenges facing America’s bioplastic researchers.

EFFECTS OF EXCESS HEAT GENERATED BY UV LASER IRRADIATION ON THE EXPOSURE PROCESS OF PHOTOSTRUCTURABLE GLASS
Ellie Katherine Hara
Palos Verdes Peninsula High School, Rolling Hills Estates, CA

Glass-Ceramics are a commonly used material, found in, for example, mugs and stove tops. A new machining method is the Direct-Write method: a stationary pulsed UV laser and a sample moving on the x, y and z axis. The UV laser induces the incorporated Ce3+ ions to eject photoelectrons that are then trapped in the glass. The next steps of the machining process uses said trapped electron. A possible problem with this method is the photon absorption also generates heat, which may reverse the photoelectrion ejection process<br><br> This project investigates the effect of manipulating the laser energy distribution, and thus the heat, on the material exposure (formation of trapped electrons) as measured by optical absorption spectroscopy. The energy distributions are a set of 10008 points on a spreadsheet that define the amplitude profile of the deposited energy. A Cary5000 spectrophotometer was used to measure the absorption of the electron at 250-290 nm.<br><br> Out of the seven amplitude distributions tested, two having the profile of Triangle and Columns showed signs of being more efficient that the current process used, Top Hat with Columns being more efficient than Triangle. <br><br> I believe Columns was more efficient because the profile has five columns dictating when the laser is turned on punctuated by spaces that lets the sample cooled down, thus decreasing energy available for the reverse reaction. By knowing how to better use the laser to trap electrons, scientists can create complex structures more efficiently with less energy wasted by inducing the reverse reaction.

APPLICATION OF SLIME MOLDS TO INFORMATION ENGINEERING
Sho Yoshida
Ritsumeikan Senior High School,Kyoto,JAPAN

In this study, use of the gintelligenth myxomycete Physarum polycephalum (slime mold), widely used in information engineering and other fields, was assessed and applied to robotics. Intelligence was defined as a predictive capacity based on memory. In the experiment, myxomycete colonies were partially irradiated from four opposing directions to investigate movement by negative phototaxis.<br><br>Movement of slime molds was consistently observed to be opposite to the direction in which light had been irradiated most recently. The findings illustrated that slime molds were capable of memorizing and avoiding a light source when the movement of that light source was predictable.<br><br>By using this property, a robot was created using slime molds as biotic components for intelligence. Importantly, the robot is controlled by slime molds and is free of any human or electronic-circuit control. When wall position information is conveyed in the form of light, slime molds memorize the information and avoid the walls in subsequent moves. The robot only has three possible moves (forwards, backwards and sideways). While these are simple, they are sufficient for exhibiting intelligence through memorization and prediction.<br><br>The application of slime molds to the control a group of robots for exploration and the formation of a biotic robot transportation network was attempted.

THE MEMORY OF THE FUTURE: EFFECTS OF THERMAL ENERGY ON MAGNETORESISTIVE RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY (MRAM) SWITCHING
Jean Michelle Juang
Corona del Sol High School, Tempe, AZ

Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM) is globally believed to be the true universal memory because of its tremendous advantages over other memory types in terms of density, speed, power consumption, and durability. A MRAM is comprised of an array of magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ), which are trilayer structures composed of a free electrode, a tunnel barrier, and a fixed electrode. This trilayer provides the basic memory cell by allowing the spin polarization of one of the electrodes to be switchable by application of a current while the second electrode is fixed as a reference layer. Depending on the relative orientations of the two magnets, the resistance of the trilayer will vary between a high and low value, allowing data to be stored as a 0 or a 1. In this article, a current-voltage (I-V) curve was taken on the MRAM device to determine the switching resistance and switching current. Each measurement was taken in a temperature range of 4 to 300K to explore the temperature dependence of induced magnetoresistance. The results show the switching current only varies by 13%, which indicates that the MRAM can be suitable for use in a low temperature environment. This unique characteristic of the MRAM device will invite further research on its use in supercomputers and space exploration.

This project is to develop a manufacturing method for an innoxious and eco-friendly insulator and a wallpaper made of Typha orientalis fruits. The project is composed of two parts. One is to manufacture the panels and papers in a chemical-free way. The other is to conduct experiments to find out whether Typha fruits and the panels and papers have suitable properties as an insulator and wallpaper, which include low heat conductivity, incombustibility, non-toxicity, and high degree of air purification.<br><br>We apply the Korean traditional method to manufacture the chemical free panels and papers. The Typha fruits are softened by boiling them with wood-ash water and are pasted with natural glues extracted from Hibiscus roots.<br><br>The heat conductivity is 0.036W/mk for the fruits and 0.041W/mk for the insulating panel, low enough to replace styrofoam, the most commonly used insulator. Panels made of the fruits show incombustibility, measured by the total heat release rate. The rate is 9.23MJ/m2 for the panels and 3.95MJ/m2 for the fruits. But a styrofoam panel's rate is 24.04MJ/m2. The toxic gas emission in combustion tests is relatively tolerable. The CO emission is 70ppm from the burn panel and 72ppm from the fruit, which is much lower than 272ppm from a styrofoam panel. No other harmful gases were detected. The Typha fruits, panels, and papers perform a purification function, verified through an experiment measuring the degree of formaldehyde absorption. <br><br>In conclusion, the products showed some very suitable properties as an insulator and wallpaper.

SURFACE MODIFICATION USING HYDRO-PHOBIC/PHILIC PROPERTIES FOR MICROFLUIDICS
Jeongsoo Lee
111, Baekyang Gwanmun Ro, Busanjin-Gu, Busan, Korea

Lab on a Chip(LOC) technology is that which integrates diagnosis and analysis work of a sample or drug, which has been performed in a conventional laboratory, on a single chip. LOC technology has several advantages in biological application due to its capability of reducing the amount of sample or reagent volume, facilitating the portable or immediate analysis and diagnosis. <br><br> For the successful performance of Lab on a Chip technology, first of all, it is essential to miniaturize each element constituting the chip, but the most key technology is that which effectively transfers, separates and mixes an organic sample or a reagent, usually present in a liquid type, in a minute element. To achieve this, various methods have been studied such as capillary phenomenon, electro-wetting, themo-capillary, and magnetic field. <br><br> The controlling of wetting property based on hydrophobicity and hydrophobicity of surface is an effective and simple one enabling control of flow of a fluid in a minute unit. In this paper, we present simple method to control the motion of fluid within micro-channel by selectively modifying the surface property using plasma treatment and hydrophobic polymeric microstructure. To do that, we directly made Polydimethylsiloxane(Hereinafter called as PDMS) channel and observed a change of the flow of a fluid in the channel the properties of whose surface changed by plasma and a hydrophobic structure. It could be found that, through this study, the control method using hydrophilicity and hydrohhobicity was simple and efficient, and the author could directly experience micro/nano technology which becomes influential recently.

WOUND GEOMETRY PLAYS ROLE IN WOUND CLOSURE FOR HUMAN KERATINOCYTES
Isaiah Paul Mitchell
James Madison Memorial High School, Madison, WI

Chronic wounds have high social and economic costs, motivating the development of improved treatments for these non-healing wounds. Understanding the environmental factors and cues that direct keratinocyte migration in dermal wound healing can help researchers develop these treatments. This study examines the effect that wound shape has on wound closure and, more specifically, what characteristics of different shapes account for the changes in keratinocyte behavior. A 2D in vitro model of wound closure was created using cells seeded around polydimethylsiloxane fences which were then removed, allowing the created ‘wound’ to close. Wounds were stained and imaged daily to measure percent closure. Initial results showed strong correlations between an increase in wound perimeter and an increase in percent closure, possibly due to a greater number of cells along the leading edge. By evaluating the effects that wound geometry has on keratinocyte migration, researchers can incorporate these findings into a model of keratinocyte function during dermal wound healing, in order to develop improved chronic wound treatments.

ECO-CONCRETE: A GOOD USE FOR THE RICE HUSK
Werner Nicolai Wasen
Liceo Dr. Anibal Acosta Estape, Rio Branco, Cerro Largo, URUGUAY

The cascareras are fields where rice husk accumulates as waste and is burned, polluting the atmosphere, increasing global warming; making fields unproductive and forcing residents to move because of pollution. This situation has led many people to consider what to do with this waste and how to make it useful. The husk of rice, due to its high silica content, is practically chemically inert, so I thought it might be a good lightweight aggregate to produce concrete, appropriate for the manufacture of prefabricated housing. This material, composed of sand, rice husk, Portland and some additives, underwent several tests, such as test-tube, concrete slump test, Brazilian test, study of thermal and moisture insulation and corrosion by acids. <br><br>Thus I found that I had obtained a lightweight concrete, suitable for making manufactured homes. It is a thermal and moisture insulator, because the peculiar form of rice husk causes the formation of air bubbles that break the capillaries formed during the setting of Portland and it is responsible for the concrete moisture absorbing. It can be used in two ways: first, homes formwork, which is an assembled formwork reinforced with mallalux, filled with eco-concrete, suitable for use with a light ceiling, and a traditional concrete structure which must be used in the case of opting for ironed ceiling. Second, houses of prefabricated panels, which are made in factories in vibrated panels filled with Eco-concrete.

PREPARATION OF MAGNETIC NANOVESICLES FOR BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS
Shelby Chi Yuan
University High School, Tucson, AZ

Nanovesicles, or liposomes, are versatile delivery vehicles studied for their biomedical applications. If made magnetic, liposomes have the potential to address problems regarding biomedical imaging, diagnostics, therapeutics, and theranostics. Unlike typical systemic delivery of most drugs and contrast agents, the magnetic property of the liposomes would allow for localized and controlled drug release preferentially to diseased tissue. I hypothesize that if 100 nm liposomes are coated with iron oxide nanoparticles, the liposomes will display magnetic properties, ideal for biomedical applications.<br><br>Liposomes were prepared using dried synthetic lipids with an amine head group serving for iron oxide formation. Liposome samples were made magnetic through the process of coating or encapsulating with iron oxide nanoparticles, prepared by oxidizing ferric chloride. Magnetic properties of liposomes and iron particles were analyzed through: reaction to a strong magnetic field, Light Microscopy under magnetic field, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).<br><br>Data analysis suggested formation of magnetic iron-coated liposomes. In the presence of a strong magnetic field, the liposomes accumulated in the vial near the magnet. TEM indicated the presence of uniformly sized iron particles in the lipid membranes. MR images indicated the presence of iron oxide and its effects as a negative contrast agent with the liposomes. <br><br>The liposomes proved to be responsive to a strong magnetic field, showed evidence of iron oxide particles on the lipid membrane with TEM, and displayed effects of negative contrast agent in MRI. These nanovesicles demonstrate potential for localized and controlled drug and contrast agent delivery.

Stephen Giovanny Mendez
Intermedia Nueva Aguada, P.R.

This research deals with the problem of how to improve the safety of the engineer with sound amplifiers and modulators in places of high noise contamination. The hypothesis were: the facilities of the Electrical Power Plant will exceed the sound regulations when monitored. The conventional cap of work, modified with a digital sound amplifiers modifier will provide a better work instrument in places of high noise contamination.<br><br>The following methodology was designed. Ten different points were selected at each point sound test were done for one minute period each test. Then the 5 areas whit the highest average points were identified: 96.9db, 97.0db; 96.0db; 98.0db; 95.5 decibels.<br><br>The measurements taken were compared with the limits establish by O.S.H.A. A digital amplifier modulator cap was designed (C.A.M). A sound modulated amplifier was installed to a conventional cap in the ear protection area.<br><br>To measure the effectiveness of the cap it was placed in a soundproof acrylic box leaving outside the sound modulated amplifier. The sound meter was near the headphones. Three areas were chosen from the previous selected ones to test the C.A.M. to determinate if it is a more effective work tool than the conventional cap. Results indicated 60%-65% noise reduction with the C.A.M.<br><br>Different to the traditional covering the C.A.M. protects the workers from noise, but also helps them to listen outside sound without taking off the earphones. This enables engineers and workers to do a more effective work in places of high noise contamination.<br><br>

THE TITAN: ELECTRONIC LOCK AND KEY MECHANISM
Horisane Bohane Marivate
St. Alban's College, Pretoria, Gauteng, South Africa

The Aim Of the project was to create a lock and key system that,could be installed in any door and, increase the effort recquired to overcome the system(to the point where it became redundant to even try to overcome the system). The lock and key system that was created has the ability to store a code on memory chips attatched to the lock and key. When the key is inserted into the door, the lock compares the code it has in memory to the one it finds on the key. Assuming they match, the lock randomly generates a new code and stores it to both devices before locking/unlocking the door(depending on the previous state of the lock).If the codes do not match, the door does not respond. Like other Standard lock and key systems, the Titan can be installed in just about any door and can use more than one key. This, Patented, system has the potential to become wireless and mobile.

NEWSPAPER AND PLASTIC: A NEW CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL
Veronica Delgado
Ana Roque de Duprey High School; Humacao, Puerto Rico

In Puerto Rico, 11,000 tons of solid wastes are generated per day (5.4 pounds per person each day). A considerable volume of this waste consists of newspaper and plastics. This amount could be significantly reduced if it is possible to recycle both of these materials. This situation motivated this research project. The purpose was to design and test a new construction material that combined the use of recycled newspaper with recycled plastics of several kinds. In this research project, it was intended to demonstrate that if newspaper is crushed and mixed with water and the resulting moist paste is mixed with minced plastic, it is possible to obtain a new material which is similar in consistency to particle board and which can be used as construction material for countertops, tables, and similar uses. Depending on the type of plastic with which the crushed newspaper was mixed with, it was possible to obtain materials of different textures and characteristics, allowing for a variety of uses. As a product of this research, three new materials were obtained, all lighter, less water-absorbent, less flammable, and more resistant to breakage than commercial particle board. The possible exploitation of this new material is recommended as a way of reducing throw-away wastes and reducing the use of wood.<br><br>

FUNCTIONALIZED CELLULOSE NANOCRYSTALS: AN EFFECTIVE ANTIMICROBIAL AGENT
Janelle Tam
Waterloo Collegiate Institute, Waterloo, CANADA

The ability of bacteria to rapidly mutate in conjunction with excessive use and misuse of antibiotics has produced deadly superbugs that have turned into a major health problem. Thus, non-toxic, biocompatible anti-microbial agents that use general physical inhibition mechanisms and thus are not susceptible to antibiotic resistance are being sought.<br><br>Removal of the amorphous regions of cellulose yields cellulose nanocrystals (CNC): cheap, abundant, stable, non-toxic and water-dispersable nanoparticles with an abundance of surface functional groups and a large surface area. Two types of nano-silver coated cellulose nanocrystals were synthesized, one using NADH and the other, polypyrrole (PPy) as the reducing agents (referred to as CNC-Ag and CNC-PPy respectively). Their anti-microbial properties were tested on Escherichia coli. When compared to silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), the minimum concentrations required to kill bacteria (minimum bactericidal concentration) were 30x and 60x lower for CNC-Ag and CNC-PPy-Ag respectively. As well, both CNC-Ag compounds required lower concentrations to inhibit the growth of bacteria in comparison to zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, copper, silicon dioxide, and AgNPs. This is likely because Ag-NPs coated on the surface of CNCs had a higher surface area and stability, and hence were more available to react with and kill bacteria. These compounds could be used in a wide variety of applications, ranging from wound dressings to home appliance disinfection. Both the synthetic processes and final product are environmentally friendly; thus, this approach offers a green solution that addresses the need for more environmentally friendly anti-microbial agents that are effective at killing bacteria.

RATIONAL METHOD OF COAL GASIFICATION
Yan Yurievich Prokopenko
Secondary School #35, Vorkuta, Republic Komi, RUSSIA

In my work I suggest one way of solving the problem of irrational coal usage as well as the method for its mining. The content of the project is to process coal into methane underground without access of air (in contrast to methods of coal gasification proposed earlier) and then to deliver it to consumers. Modernization of production will help to avoid traumatic injures, to decrease lung diseases of people working and living in proximity to mines. This work is very important, because the suggested method of cool gasification into methane is profitable as for environment as for economy: a) The usage of methane as a fuel doesn’t produce anhydride sulphide, as coal does, containing sulphuretted hydrogen and sulphur, and as a result, the possibility of acid rains, caused by burning of methane and its mixture with water contained in the air, reduces very much; b) Underground gasification excludes any disturbance and pollution of the upper Earth cover; c) Coal reserves on our planet will be enough for than 1000 years, if they mine 3 milliard of tons a year, it means they will be able to produce about 1,7*1015 cubic meters of methane. Besides they can mine natural methane, accompanying coal, in addition it is plus 0,67*1015 cubic meters. The whole amount of produced methane is about 2,37*1015 cubic meters or 2,37 quadrillion cubic meters; d) They also can produce except methane: hydrogen, nitrogen, ammonia, carbon bisulphide, hydrogen sulphide, argon, helium etc. I suggest gas transporting by pipeline (the cheapest mean of transport).

A STUDY OF THE CAPTURE RATE QUANTIFICATION ON MAGNETIC NANO PARTICLES FOR BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS
Shikah Duwihi A Alshuwaish
Altarbia Alislamia Schools, Riyadh, SAUDI ARABIA

Magnetic nano-particles have been undergoing studies because of their unique properties. Although functionalization of such particles has been used to substantiate their use in novel technologies like pathogen detection and drug delivery systems, a quantitative study of the capture rate has never been undertaken. In order to develop these technologies, it is essential to quantify the number of entities that have been captured by the magnetic particles. The objective of this project is to determine how different variables affect the capture rate of magnetic nano-particles for their use in biomedical applications. Two experiments were conducted to prove the possibility of attaching biological or non-biological entities to magnetic particles. First, E.coli was used with the amount of bacterial fluid and E.coli antibody as variables after being incubated for 16 hours at 37 degrees and then checked under the microscope to quantify the capture rate of the magnetic beads. Second, fluorescent filled polymers that were diluted 1=100 microliters were attached to the magnetic beads using streptavidin and biotin bond. It was noticed that there was an increase in the capture rate with an increase in the variables. The capture rate was successfully quantified and a direct relationship between the variables and the capture rate was determined. This study is a leap towards developing novel technologies that will revolutionize today’s biomedical applications by providing numbers that can be used in modeling the sensitivity of applications such as Lab on Chip Devices and drug delivery systems.

THE STUDY OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF NOVEL OPTIMIZATION OF DIGITAL IMAGE CORRELATION TO OBTAIN ACCURATE FULL-FIELD DISPLACEMENT MEASUREMENTS
Alma Amad Alhussaini
Dhahran Schools, Khobar, SAUDI ARABIA

In the field of Mechanical Engineering, displacement of material can be used in identification of mechanical properties. When heterogeneous materials are subject to loads, they deform and their mechanical properties can be understood when local displacements are measured. In this research study, the main goal was to optimize a process called Digital Image Correlation which measures local displacements by comparing images of a specimen before and after loading. Recently, Digital Image Correlation has become a popular method because of the low cost of imaging devices. It is considered as a new method which, in comparison to standard methods such as the cross-head and strain gauge displacement method, can give full-field measurements. Optimization of DIC is essential in order to improve the accuracy of the data obtained when compared to the strain gauge method. In this study, the speckle pattern and subset sizes are parameters that were tuned in order to optimize the DIC process based on a specific testing apparatus. The three specimens tested: epoxy, aluminum, and steel were speckle patterned and displaced using the microstrain machine. Images taken via the CCD camera were later used for numerical comparison before and after displacement. When graphed, the larger subset size was closest to the ideal line obtained from Finite Element Method which suggests improved accuracy. It has been concluded that using a larger subset size and applying a speckle pattern from a greater distance leads to more accurate displacement estimation than the cross-head displacement and strain gauge methods. Findings show that using DIC methodology will assist in identification of material properties using inverse methods.

RAPID PRODUCTION OF ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE MATERIAL FROM LOCAL WASTE AND MUSHROOM MYCELIA
Divya Gourish Sirdeshpande
Hempfield High School, Landisville, PA

Last year, it was shown that a novel porous material can be “grown” from mushroom mycelium and local farm wastes such as biosolids from an anaerobic digester. Mushroom mycelia are nature’s recycling system. They grow by digesting waste and forming a chitinous polymer which is the major component of the mycelium hypahe. This polymer is used as a “glue” to bond biosolids to form a porous material that has properties similar to StyrofoamTM. This material is superior to materials such as expanded polystyrene because a) they are made from local waste, b) they can be made with one-tenth the energy, c) this material is biodegradable. However, it took about 5 weeks to grow this material. This made the process impractical and economically less feasible.<br><br>In this work, the same material has been prepared in just 5 days. This material is superior in strength to the one made last year by 2 times. This has been achieved by a) by cultivating mycelia from mushroom tissue and producing the porous material from a liquid spawn, b) optimizing two different strains of mushrooms – Pleurotus and Grifola and, c) by combining the waste solid mix that resulted in a higher C:N ratio and higher lignin content. The mycelia were able to colonize the waste solid mixture within 5 days.<br><br>Porous materials were prepared from density ranging from 0.08 to 1.2 gm/mL. Pleurotus mycelium grew well in the solids mixture containing biosolids as high as 40% biosolids. Because the Pleurotus mycelium are dimitic, the porous materials were less stronger than the material produced from Grifola mycelium by one-half. The Grifola mycelia are trimitic which makes the porous substance stronger. Since the mycelia are made from a chitinous polymer these materials do not burn and are water resistant.

PIEZOELECTRIC ENERGY HARVESTING FROM HUMAN BREATH FOR BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS
Rohan Palanki
W.P. Davidson High School, Mobile, AL

The use of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film was investigated for generating piezoelectric energy via human breath. PVDF film of three different thicknesses (110 microns, 52 microns, and 28 microns) were subjected to an air flow rate of 75 l/min. It was observed that film thickness affected the amount of voltage generated from the PVDF film, with the thinnest film generating the highest voltage. Furthermore, the generated voltage increased with film surface area. These results were utilized to fabricate a device that uses human breath to generate electrical energy. In particular, SolidWorks software was used to design each component and the final design was assembled using commonly available materials. The efficacy of the device to produce a voltage with inhalation and exhalation was tested via a program written in LabView. Experiments indicated that this device could distinguish between normal breathing and simulated restrictive ventilatory abnormality. A simple bridge rectifier circuit was built to convert the alternating current to direct current. Experiments were conducted to quantify the amount of energy generated from human breath while exercising. It was shown that this multipurpose device could be used as a diagnostic tool for respiratory ailments as well as an energy device to power ultra-low-power biomedical devices that , utilize radio frequency identification (RFID) tags.

SURGICAL SPINAL INSTRUMENTATION: ASSESSMENT OF CROSS-LINK DESIGN BASED ON SHEAR STRENGTH
Hanya Marium Qureshi
Pulaski Academy, Little Rock, AR

A cross-link is a trans-connector for rods and screws on each side utilized in spine surgery, preventing torsion during ambulation and strengthening the construct. The experiment’s goal was to design a custom cross-link for an obese patient to withstand 36 Nm of torsion. Eight simulations were run on a Finite Element Analysis software, four for each of two materials: Cobalt Chrome and Titanium Alloy. The cross-links were modeled as either circular (9mm or 7mm) or elliptical bars (9mm x 7mm and 7mm x 9mm). It was hypothesized that a Cobalt Chrome cross-link would meet the torque requisite at a smaller cross-sectional area (CSA). The null hypothesis stated that a Titanium Alloy cross-link may meet the torque requisite, but not necessarily have the smallest CSA. Each variation’s success was determined by whether or not the maximum shear stress seen was less than the shear yield stress of the selected material. Four of the simulations passed, and four failed. One of the Titanium Alloy constructs passed, as did three of the Cobalt Chrome constructs. The simulations modeling the 7mm and 9mm diameter circular cross-links had the largest and smallest maximum shear stress values respectively. The simulations modeling elliptical cross-links all had similar maximum shear stresses. Statistical analysis showed that the diameter was much more significant than material, which was statistically insignificant. However, material did affect the angle of deflection. It was concluded that the circular, 9mm diameter, Cobalt Chrome cross-link would be the best option for the obese patient.

INVESTIGATION OF THE ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES OF METAL/PYRITE (FES2) JUNCTIONS (II)
Ivy Y. Chang
Hamilton High School, Chandler, AZ

The nontoxic semiconductor pyrite FeS2 appeals to us as a good candidate for solar cells because it has a desirable bandgap of 0.95 eV that collects most of the solar light spectrum and is composed of inexpensive materials. The electrical properties of metal/pyrite junctions characterized the contact and pyrite materials parameters important to photovoltaic research. A number of metals (Al, Au, Cr, Fe, Ni) were deposited on pyrite (FeS2) and the current-voltage characteristics of the metal/pyrite contacts were measured with variance in temperature. All diodes successfully showed a decrease in current with temperature. Gold and nickel exhibited low-resistance, non-rectifying behavior, making them excellent candidates as Ohmic contacts in the fabrication of pyrite solar cells. Aluminum, chromium and iron formed rectifying, Schottky barriers. The characteristics of these contacts were fitted to the equation I=Io(eqV/nkT-1). Since the ideality factor was found to be much greater than 1, it was concluded that thermionic emission does not dominate at room temperature. To characterize the Schottky barrier height and doping concentration of the pyrite material, capacitance-voltage measurements will be made. This requires contacts with less current flowing, so measurements can be performed at cryogenic temperatures (300 K-4K). The intercept of the line formed by plotting C-2 vs. Voltage is equal to the barrier height. The doping concentration is inversely proportional to the slope of the line. Future studies consist of depositing semi-transparent metals (~5 nm) to enable the entrance of light and quantify the efficiency of the photovoltaic processes.

SEEING CANE FOR BLINDS
Robert Varga
Csepel-Sziget Secondary School of Technology, Budapest, Hungary

Nowadays the sensitivity for social problems is very important question. That is why the goal of this innovation was to secure more chances for blinds in the society.<br><br>The developed cane was based on the experiences of blind people. According to them, the biggest problem in transport is obstacles placed on walls (e.g. bank machine, wall-mount phone boxes, etc.). The so called seeing cane consists of a traditional white cane, a vibration motor and car radar using ultrasonic waves.<br><br>A traditional white cane cannot perceive the obstacles mentioned, but the properly adjusted ultrasonic sensor fixed on the developed cane can warn its user for the on-coming danger. The sensor - if there is an obstacle in its way - gives signs by the help of a vibration. The sensor built in the handle perceives the obstacle from 5-foot distance and as its user approaches it the vibration gets stronger. This is very useful for those people who are not only blind but deaf as well. During the development of the seeing cane I needed precise data about the visible area of the sensor. I determined the angle of sight with a digital camera by a 30*30cm cardboard-paper.<br><br>Using the seeing cane, the visually handicapped people can use their white cane as their most important and developed sense, i.e. their hearing.<br><br>Besides its simplicity and low cost, according to the tests the blind people do not bump into the obstacles placed high and they can avoid serious injuries, which can help to improve their self-confidence in transport and the quality of their life. This innovation would ease millions of people’s life.

ENHANCEMENT OF DESALINATION WITH TITANIUM AND ZINC OXIDE NANOPARTICLES
Emily Anne Walter
Notre Dame Academy, Park Hills, KY

This research was conducted to determine whether suspended metal oxide nanoparticles would enhance water desalination by evaporation. This was done with the use of a light box in which control (saltwater) and experimental (salt water + nanoparticles) samples were heated simultaneously under matched conditions of energy intensity and time. Zinc oxide and titanium dioxide were present in two proportions. For zinc oxide, although the differences were not statistically significant for the sample sizes used (n = 5), in 8 of 10 cases more water was distilled with the nanoparticles present. Titanium dioxide was substantially more effective, with differences in the averages amounts distilled statistically significant (p < 0.001). More water was distilled in the experimental time frame with the higher proportion of 0.2 grams to 100 mL of saltwater. These experiments show promise for improving solar distillation of seawater to obtain freshwater by suspending metal oxide nanoparticles in the system.

SAVE THE SKIN YOU’RE IN! PREVENTION OF SKIN CANCER WHILST OPTIMISING VITAMIN D SYNTHESIS
Ethan Thomas Butson
The Illawarra Grammar School, Mangerton, AUSTRALIA

This project provided a complete assessment, measurement and educational tool for the analysis of solar Ultraviolet Radiation (UV). Specifically, this work designed methods to find the optimal amount of UV a person should be exposed to, for minimisation of health risks, such as skin cancer (too much UV) or vitamin D deficiency (too little UV). At present, above 60% of Australians and 20% of US Citizens will develop skin cancer in their lifetime. Moreover, above 30% of Australians and 40% of US citizens are currently vitamin D deficient. The Opti – D calculator package provides the necessary tools to significantly reduce these numbers and could save billions of health dollars by educative prevention of these solar UV related diseases. <br><br>Measurements were made to calculate standard UV exposures and well as UV transmission properties through clothing. Global UV index databases where accessed and manipulated to calculate and ascertain UV exposure levels worldwide to produce global UV exposure indication software for analysis and education of current UV exposure requirements for optimal Vitamin D synthesis. New and novel Opti – D UV dosimeters were developed which provide a quantitative measure of UV exposure required for Vitamin D synthesis. This allows the user to accurately receive the correct amount of UV exposure for their skin type for optimal health benefits. A UV exposure time calculator was also developed to predict the time required for solar UV exposure for optimal health benefits.

GUIDE FOR THE VISUALLY DISABLED
Pablo Tinoco da Silva
Colegio de Aplicacao Emmanuel Lentisinins, Rio de Janeiro,Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

The Guide for the Visually Disabled is made up of squared tiles with parallel undulations, sensitive to the touch of a foot, in which each kind of surface has a different meaning. When the parallel undulations are in the same direction the person is walking, his or her feet will not have any kind of difficulty to step on it normally, and he or she will understand that it means go ahead. When the parallel undulations are crossed this means attention and by being so they will not allow him or her to step on it normally. After the attention signal, there will be the elevated stop-circles of a 3 cm diameter each, meaning that there is a crossroads ahead. After the signal meaning stop, there will always be a plate, located on the right, with a text written in Braille indicating the place where the visually disabled is and where he or she will have to head for. The plate will have information such as where the nearest payphone is, the name of streets, bus stops and so on. On crossing the street, the visually disabled person will be sure to be stepping on wrinkled lines made of rubber.

USE OF POLYMER SUBSTRATES TO REGULATE THE DIFFERENTIATION OF MOUSE EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS
Benjamin Thomas Lei
Arlington High School, LaGrangeville, NY

Proliferation without differentiation is essential in stem cell culture, enabling potential for various medical treatments. Gelatin (porcine-derived) and feeder (mouse embryonic fibroblasts) layers maintain pluripotency of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) in traditional cell culture. Gelatin and feeder were replaced with synthetic polymer thin films: poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), poly(4-vinylpyridine) (P4VP), poly(styrene-co-4-styrene sulfonic acid) (SPS), and two different thicknesses of polybutadiene (PB), 200Å and 2000Å, spun cast onto silicon and glass wafers. I hypothesized that the distinct chemical and physical properties of the polymers, thus the acidity and hardness of the synthetic substrates, would affect mESC differentiation. Confocal fluorescence staining and atomic force microscopy were performed to analyze mESC growth. Relative Young’s modulus was calculated for mESC surfaces and extracellular matrices to study differentiation and interactions between the mESCs and substrate. Cell hardness is an indicator of differentiation; the two different thicknesses of PB caused different relative moduli in mESCs and demonstrated that substrate mechanics can regulate differentiation. SPS, an acidic polymer, supported proliferation without differentiation for at least five passages, while P4VP, a basic polymer, was not successful, showing that stem cells prefer an acidic substrate. The results indicate that polymer thin films alone can be used to control mESC differentiation, and hence can be used as a substrate for expansion and delivery of stem cells. Since SPS supports mESC growth in the absence of gelatin and feeder, it is an inexpensive candidate for replacing xenogeneic culture components, decreasing the risks of contamination by retroviruses or pathogens.

ENHANCING QUANTUM DOT SOLAR CELLS WITH METAL NANOPARTICLES
Alexander Jordan McBride
McBride Homeschool, Medford, NJ

Quantum dot solar cells (QDSCs) have tremendous potential for low cost energy conversion, however, current efficiencies are too low for commercialization. Plasmons, which are generated when incident light excites charge density oscillations within metal nanoparticles, have two characteristic properties: intense light scattering, and enhanced electromagnetic fields. These properties are proposed to benefit quantum dot (QD) photovoltaics, by increasing the optical pathway of incoming light, electromagnetic field induced QD absorption enhancements, and resonate energy transfer between plasmons and QDs. <br><br> This project introduced gold and silver nanospheres, with varying diameters (20, 40, and 80 nm), and silver nanoplates, into quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (CdPbS, CdS, CdSe, and CdS/CdSe QDs). Quantum dot photoelectrodes were prepared by an in situ chemical bath deposition technique on metal nanoparticle treated titanium dioxide electrodes. A polysulfide electrolyte was used as the redox mediator, with a copper (I) sulfide treatment for the counter electrode catalyst. After 160 QDSCs were fabricated, and thoroughly characterized, metal nanoparticles significantly enhanced QDSC photovoltaic performance. <br><br> Addition of silver nanoplates tripled CdS/CdSe solar cell efficiencies, from 0.4%, to 1.2%. Absorption measurements on QD photoelectrodes, with metal nanoparticle treatments, verify that plasmon-induced enhancements are responsible for the photovoltaic improvement. Overall, this experiment successfully meshed the field of plasmonics with quantum dot solar cell research, introducing a promising avenue for low-cost, and clean energy production.

Manuel Ramos Hernandez, Quebradillas, Puerto Rico

The fire scene is too dangerous or not suitable for fireman to enter in structures after the fire, this may cause loss of lives. So, there is a need to design a fireman robot that can assist fireman to save lives and avoid putting them in dangerous situations. The robot (WD-1) designed for this research was able to indicate the conditions of a structure after a fire, it moved with exact instructions, indicated the locations of victims for their immediate rescue, detected and put out the fire with build-in fire extinguisher. WD-1 was developed in stages, to make the body an aluminum frame was used and WD-1 was built around it. In the second stage; the bi-directional mechanism was developed using sensors.<br><br> On the third stage; the appropriate wheels were selected. On the fourth stage; dc volts requirements study was done. In the last stage the movement mechanisms were tested. WD-1 was a functional robot. It was possible for it to move across difficult areas, turn around without using movement axis and detect smoke. It can be concluded that it is possible to create a fireman robot with the actual aerospace technology. A projection to this work is that the robot will be prepared to work efficiently even at high temperatures, communicate without wires, detect the presence of toxic gases, chemicals or radiation and detect victims even under conditions with poor visibility. <br><br>

RESEARCH ON PRODUCTION OF ISOFLAVONE AGLYCONES FROM SOYBEAN BY MICROBIOTECHNOLOGY
Anh Thao Nguyen
Chu Van An National High School, Hanoi, VIETNAM

Isoflavones are phytoestrogens, which have many health benefits such as preventing cancers, reducing risks of heart diseases and menopausal symptoms, improving bone health, etc. In soybean, isoflavones exist in two forms: glycosides (IG) and aglycones (IA). Compared to IG, IA are more bioavailable, due to their higher capacity of being absorbed to the body, but the typical level of IA in soybean isoflavones is quite low (1-5%). IG can be biotransformed to IA by enzyme Beta-glucosidase, which is excreted by some type of bacteria and mold during fermentation. The purpose of this study was to produce a functional food product containing a high level of IA by submerged fermentation for prevention of cancers, reduced risks of heart diseases. The strain of Bacillus subtilis VN20 having a high biotransformation efficency of IG to IA (79.6%) was isolated and selected. The amount of IA in the soymilk extracted from germinated soybeans with submerged fermentation at a temperature of 42oC for 28 h was 12.45 mg/100g (7.4 times higher than non-fermented soymilk). After filtration, concentration, and spray drying, the amount of IA in the obtained powder is 297.9 mg/100g (accounting for 76.2% of the total isoflavones). Additionally, the protein level in the powder was 49.2%, an increase of 41.8%, trypsin inhibitor decreased 76.8%, raffinose decreased 94.3% and stachyose decreased 90.3% compared with those of original soybean.

THE PAIN RELIEVING BELT FOR HEALTH
Piyaporn Yoosuk
Klonglanwitaya, Kumpangphet, THAILAND

The pain relieving belt for health is designed to relieve back pains, e.g., from muscle ache, strained ligaments and over-stressed muscles, as well as abdominal pains, e.g., from abdominal cramp, belly ache and abdominal and back pain caused by menstruation. The project originated from witnessing the severe pain of local women who do not have much opportunity to be treated by physical therapy, especially a hot massage therapy. The equipment is based on a concept that heating increases flow in blood vessels and that, in the meantime, massaging increases flexibility and relaxing the muscle. The pain relieving belt for health is composed of a control box, heating element, a vibrating system and an orthopedic back support. The equipment is designed in 3 models for different uses. The first design has a simple pattern of the heating element and a movable vibrating system. In the second design, the heating element is coiled around the vibrating spots to simulate massaging with a bag of heated medicinal herbs. The third design aims for a better stress relaxation in muscle by harmonizing the pattern of the heating element with the pattern of human muscle. <br><br> Experiments were carried out on a group of local women with back and/or abdominal pains that required treatment. All volunteers preferred to make use of the equipment 3-4 days a week and all reported some degree of improvement. The most suitable temperature for the group tested was 75oC at the heating element and 40oC at the skin contact. The equipment is worn as an inner belt covered by a tight fitting orthopedic back support belt. To simulate a spa condition, the level of heat and the strength of vibration can be varied to suit the individual user. Typically, a therapy session may take 20-30 minutes and a timer can be set as preferred. For further applications, the heating system can be used along with aromatic herbal oils to release a fragrance to create the effect of an aroma therapy.

ONE STEP AT A TIME: A DEVICE TO HELP CRUTCHES AND WALKING AIDS ON SAND & MUD
Erin Alison Nolan
Wirral Grammar School For Girls, Bebington, UNITED KINGDOM

After many years with a close friend who uses elbow crutches I realised that there were problems in the use of walking aids on soft terrain, like sand and mud. Because the ferrules/tips are so small and yet receiving up to the full bodyweight of the users they create very high pressures so they sink down and find it very difficult to lift them back out again. Walking aid users often struggle with balance and mobility so will trip over as a result of trapping their ferrules in the ground if not just become tired very quickly. This is especially important as areas of conflict, illness and disaster, where walking aids are prevalent, coincide with areas of desertification and flooding AND the world population is becoming increasingly elderly (increasing aid usage).<br><br> I tried and tested many different shapes and mechanisms and my final design evolved as a unique shape of a hemisphere with a particular fin. This means a significantly larger surface area in a shorter width (less of a trip hazard when swinging the walking aids forward) with curves for ease of retrieval. The fin however prevents users slipping backwards upon initially putting the device on the ground at an angle (as is the case with large hemispheres otherwise) and cuts through the terrain so minimal suction is created when trying to lift out of wet terrains like mud or saturated sand. The shape allows a smooth rolling motion (for comfort and minimal wear) that ferrules do not.

THE NEW SOURCE OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY FROM TREES
Supachoke Haruhansapong
Princess Chulabhorn's College Trang, Trang, THAILAND

Natural Electricity produced in plants is taken into consideration for developing clean power source. Electricity is naturally produced by electron-tranfer reactions between Mg and Cu in the electrolytic liquid of plants' vascular bundle. An electricity-producing instrument can be constructed by modeling this natural mechanism.<br><br> This instrument imitating electricity production in plant was made and connected to fluid flow tubes (known as vascular bundle). The instrument consists of Mg and Cu plates exposed to vascular bundle liquid. The electricity produced was measured by a multimeter. Of prime important, the instrument was designed to be easily repeated and rebuilt.<br><br> The results of the instumental tests showed that there were differences in the quantity of electricity by monocotyledon and dicotyledon plants. For instance, Banana tree provided higher voltage than Apocynaceae or Teen Ped (Cerbera Odollam G). The factors found affecting electricity production in plants were pH level, surface area of Mg and Cu plates, time, trunk height, gap between Mg and Cu plates, distance between a pair of galvanic cells, and arrangement of cells. <br><br> The experiments are the preliminary study of clean electricity from plants. The study shows the possibility of the clean and environmentally friendly energy source that can promote sustainable living. People can have electricity even in the deep forest.

ASSEMBLY OF MAGNETIC PARTICLES AND MAGNETIC HOLES INTO 1D, 2D, AND 3D PHOTONIC CRYSTALS
Michael Leonard Janner
Redlands East Valley High School, Redlands, CA

Photonic crystals are structures with a periodic index of refraction that can prevent the propagation of light within a certain range, known as the band gap. This photonic effect occurs only in dimensions with the appropriate periodicity, so it is therefore possible to create photonic structures that act in only specific directions. The objective of this experiment is to fabricate one-, two-, and three-dimensional photonic crystals and to manipulate the assembly of these structures so that their morphology and photonic response may be controlled.<br><br>Porous silica-coated iron oxide nanocrystal clusters were used as building blocks for magnetically responsive 1D photonic chains, which could be reassembled into 2D photonic labyrinths by increasing concentration and magnetic field strength. 3D crystals proved harder to achieve due to the low uniformity of the magnetic clusters, so polystyrene beads were placed in a ferrofluid so that they would act as magnetic holes and could be assembled into not only 1D chains and 2D labyrinths, but also 3D magnetic photonic crystals with high interior order. Patterned templates were created from polydimethylsiloxane and polyurethane and were used to control the exterior shape of the photonic crystals.<br><br>The ability to fabricate photonic assemblies with precise control over the structure, diffraction wavelength, and directions of diffraction marks a development that will allow photonic crystals to be created for highly specific purposes with narrow constraints for the photonic properties. Such crystals may find use in applications including flexible computer and television displays, color-changing clothing, and photonics-based computer chips.

ACTIVE WINDOWS SHIELDS A HELPFUL SOLUTION TO SAVE LIVES IN BUILDINGS EMERGENCIES
Abdulaziz K Ghunaim
Assrary High School, Riyadh, Central, SAUDI ARABIA

In Saudi Arabia, people place metallic bars on windows of homes and residential buildings to secure them from burglaries. These shields are found to be very dangerous in case of a fire, due to obstructing inhabitants from using these windows as emergency exits. This results in significant delays in evacuation time in case of fire. <br><br>This research aims to find a solution to satisfy both requirements. First, reduce the time required for evacuating the building in case of emergencies to prevent fatalities and excessive damage. Second, maintain proper security measures to prevent unauthorized entries. This would be achieved using “Action Windows Shields” (AWS) based on the following hypothesis. If windows could be used as emergency exists, time for evacuating inhabitants would be reduced which would result in less number of fatalities and reduced damage to homes. <br><br>AWS enables regular window shields to be controlled (open/close) using flexible joints and an electrical lock mounted on top of windows frames. The lock is connected to fire smoke detector system via a control unit. The window lock would unlock automatically when fire is detected. Thus, allowing inhabitants and fire fighters to evacuate the building safely.<br><br> The hypothesis was tested using a sample of 20 different buildings (within each, 5 randomly selected spots were chosen for testing). The times needed to reach the nearest window and the nearest door were measured. The results showed that AWS significantly reduced the time required for evacuating building in case of emergencies by 55%. In addition, AWS maintained proper security measure for homes and buildings.<br><br>

ANTHOCYANINS AND THEIR EFFECTS ON DYE-SENSITIZED SOLAR CELLS
Taylor Aaron Hobbs
Success Academy, Cedar City, UT

The purpose of the experiment was to discover ways to improve the cost/efficiency ratio of Dye Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSC’s) using anthocyanin based fruit dye as the primary light harvester. Also, to test the hypothesis that if the levels of anthocyanins in these natural DSSC’s is increased, the efficiency of the cell will also increase. Solar cells were constructed in a lab in the traditional fashion outlined by Michael Grätzel, the inventor of natural DSSC’s. The structure of the DSSC’s included two slides of FTO conductive glass, sandwiching a Titanium Oxide (Titania) paste and fruit dye mixture, as well as a iodide electrolyte and graphite. All of this was clamped together by two binder clips on each side, making the glass have an offset placement, exposing the inside of each piece of glass on either side in order to take measurements and readings. For the experiment, several different fruits were used as the primary ingredient in the dye, including blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, hawthorne berries, and bilberries. After construction with the varying fruits, readings of voltage and conductivity were taken, as well as measurements of total area of the cell. The efficiencies of .25% (blueberries), .27% (strawberries), .51% (blackberries), 1.51% (hawthorne) and 1.57% (bilberries) were found. Other cells were constructed prior to using controlled methods of construction, yielding up to 3.5% efficiency from bilberries. The results show potential in creating low cost alternatives to typical DSSC materials that are still highly efficient, and also support the hypothesis.

A DYNAMIC ANALOG CONCURRENTLY-PROCESSED ADAPTIVE CHIP
Malcolm Christopher Ross Stagg
Alberta Distance Learning Center, Calgary Alberta, Canada

The purpose of this project is to overcome the limitations of current neural network chips which generally have poor reconfigurability, and lack parameters for efficient learning. A new general-purpose analog neural network design is made for the TSMC 0.35um CMOS process. Parallel processing is possible with a massive array of independent cells, concurrently processing data. This allows the network to quickly recognize information in various applications. With support for multiple learning algorithms, arbitrary routing, high density, and storage of many parameters using improved high-resolution analog multi-valued memory, this network is suitable for vast improvements to the learning algorithms. Such improvements allow learning to interact with routing for a network which is not bound to a fixed layout. Other improvements include the interaction of multiple learning algorithms to learn partially by pattern, and partially by feedback. Modified Backpropagation learning used with the learning rate parameters allows important data to be reinforced and retained, and insignificant data to be labile, providing improved learning speed. In addition to introducing the planned design for chip implementation, an op-amp prototype is created on a PC board. This prototype allows further development at cell-level, as well as a demonstration of the operation of the CMOS chip. SPICE is used for simulations of the CMOS circuit cells to determine accuracy and input/output range. Neuron circuits were found to be accurate, as was the Gilbert multiplier when input range was restricted. Neuron and synapse circuit design is complete, now in the simulation and layout phase.

The Binary System Prototype Precursor works as a mathematics game, played with 2-players; this project targets a larger aim, allowing 4 players to compete at the same time, including new and better resources to clarify the project. <br><br>It intends do demonstrate binary functions of a machine. This electric device has a similar function of a Q&A game, it consists of logic questions, thus it’s a didactic game that attempts to teach the players, stimulating any age or grade students. The game’s questions and answers can be rearranged to several possible ways, making the game more accessible to either younger or older players. <br><br>The prototype works as a Q&A game. The first column contains questions with 6 answers each and with only one correct answer. If the player gets a correct answer, he / she will led to the next question, until reaching the last question correctly, a device is activated giving a prize to the player. This game can be played with 4 players at the same time. <br><br>Only one of the players can win the prize, so when the last question is reached, only the first player who replies it correctly will win the prize. If any player answers a question incorrectly, he / she will get a sound and light alert and will have to repeat all the questions from the beginning, getting very behind the other players.<br><br>

MULTI GENERATING ENERGY SYSTEM
Gabriel Soto
Luis Munoz Marin High School, Barranquitas, Puerto Rico

The high consumption of electricity has taken human beings to an excessive use of fossil fuel and it is in danger of disappearing. Besides this, fossil fuel pollutes and damages the delicate balance of our environment. The purpose of this research was to develop an energy system prototype that produces sufficient electricity for domestic consumption by using natural renewable energy sources such as the wind, sun and water.<br><br> This model was designed taking into account the necessity to recycle and store water. Water was pumped from a lake or primary underground deposit, by a hydraulic pump. This pump was activated by a windmill and water was stored in a secondary tank located at a higher level. The windmill was connected to a generator that produced electricity. A solar cell bank also produced electric power, which was stored together with the windmill batteries for further use. The secondary tank was also connected to a water pick up system, similar to a cistern. The fall of water, provided the necessary motor power to move a hydraulic turbine. It was connected to a generator to produce electricity that was stored in the same batteries. <br><br> This last source of electric power can be used in moments that the production of electric power is poor or null in the windmill or the solar cell bank. Once the prototype was assembled, outdoor tests were conducted. Under normal environmental conditions the system was able to maintain a satisfactory production of energy. These results confirmed the hypothesis.<br><br>

EARLY DETECTION OF G-FORCES USING SENSORY HELMETS TO ASSIMILATE FORCE DATA LIKE A REAL HELMET TO HELMET COLLISION
Taylor-Alexandria Miracle Dorsey
Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Baltimore, MD

A wide range of head injury risks are present in sports, especially in football. These risks can escalate into actual injuries; which can lead to permanent brain damage. Current data shows that permanent brain damage can occur at 70-100 G's or higher. The emphasis of this research focus on making easier for the sidelines (coaches, players, etc;) to monitor the players when they have these helmet to helmet collisions. Using force sensors in the frontal lobe position of the helmet, force data would be immediately calculated and transferred to a wireless device, such as a tablet/computer, that is positioned off the field. Preventing football concussions, this will help identify early detection on the field because there may not be any outwards signs or symptoms of a concussion. The athlete may continue to compete without anyone realizing that he/she is injured. The goal is to do a Impact Simulation Test to measure the helmet to helmet collisions based on force being provided by the sensors on the changing of the resistance. The experimental study will consist of the control variable being the helmet without the sensors,the independent variable is the changing of the G-forces that is being applied, and the dependent variable is the placing of the force sensors. The players are at a risk if they are experiencing 70-100 G's, and 90-100 G's are effects of a early stage of concussions/ TBI's.

STUDY OF GLASS PACKAGE INCORPORATION TO MANUFACTURING TILES AND BRICKS STRUCTURALS
Isabela Reis Carrer
Escola SENAI Mario Amato, São Bernardo do Campo, SP, Brazil

I analyzed the performance of a type of Argillite, a ceramic commonly used in the pottery region of Itu – SP, combined with four different glass packing compositions: 3, 5, 7 and 10%, applied on real industrial production conditions. The results indicated that as the percentage of glass in the mass increases, it decreases the after burn TRF – Turbine Rear Frame (up to 950ºC after 30 hours), the drying critical point and the drying retraction, and it increases the drying TRF (110ºC), linear dilation, the superficial porosity and the water absorption. MEV analysis images show that the glass reached partially the softening point and it reacted with the mass forming crystals, without enough fluidity to cover the pores. However, most of the grains have angular edges e produce counter-molds for the mass impression with associated tiny fissures caused by the expansion of two different materials inducing the increase of superficial porosity and the decrease of the after-burn TRF.

A NEW ALTERNATIVE FOR THE RELIEVE OF MENSTRUAL PAIN
Sharon Midori Acevedo
Liceo Ponceno, 2825 Ave. F.D. Roosevelt, Ponce, Puerto Rico 

This investigation presented the design of an abdominal girdle, "Thermo-Press", to relax and to smooth the pains during menstrual period. Dysmenorrhea or menstrual cramping is one of the most common problems seen in women's health care. An estimate 50% of menstruating women are affected and this condition is most common between the ages of 15 and 25. Menstrual cramps may be accompanied by backage, fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, and headaches.<br><br> The materials used on the design of the girdle were a pad which provides heat and an air pump which provides pressure on the abdominal area. The girdle has velcro straps that help secure the pad and the pump in place so they don't present any damage, risk, or discomfort.<br><br> The "Thermo-Press" girdle was given to a group of fifteen women to be used through their menstrual period. Each of the participants received an orientation of how to use the "Thermo-Press" girdle. Later a questionnaire with seven questions was given to them in order to be answered with the information required. The data was gathered and analyzed. The information obtained demostrated that most of the participants felt better when they made used of the "Thermo-Press" girdle and because of their own experience they will recomend the use of it to other women.

CORNBOARD
Philip Schmidt
Fenelon Falls Secondary School, Fenelon Falls Ontario, Canada

This project examines fibreboard composed of corn stalk residue and manufactured particleboard to determine whether the fibreboard has comparable physical properties. <br><br> To test the corn fibreboard, or Cornboard, trials were completed side by side with particleboard. These tests include abrasion, machining, water resistance, strength, and flammability. Cornboard was shown to share similar machining and abrasion properties as particleboard.<br><br> In the water trials, samples were submerged for a specified length of time, the samples were then removed and their weights taken to establish the amount of water absorption. In the case of particleboard, it had absorbed 17.7 grams of water, or 42% of its own mass in water after two hours of submersion. After two hours had elapsed, Cornboard had only absorbed 10.3 grams of water, which is 32% of its own mass in water.<br><br> For strength and flame tests, samples were suspended over a dial indicator for the former, or a tea light for the latter. With strength tests a consistent weight was suspended over the center of the sample, and then the deflection was measured. With Cornboard, deflection was 20.3 thousands of an inch between three trials, particleboard deflected an average of 22.3 thousands of an inch. With flame tests, particleboard ignited after 4 minutes; Cornboard did not ignite after an hour of exposure to the flame. <br><br> Conclusions that can be drawn are this: cost efficient, environmentally friendly fibreboard can be constructed from corn residue that is comparable in all aspects to production particleboard. <br><br>

ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY: AFFORDABLE SOLUTIONS
Andrea Rosenthal Finch
Good Hope School, Frederiksted, VI, USA

People with disabilities are often in need of Assistive Technology devices to improve their functioning and independent living skills. The purpose of this Science Fair Project is to create inexpensive forms of Assistive Technology devices that are equally effective as commercially purchased devices. Commercially purchased devices are often too expensive for a lower income person with a disability to afford. In the continental United States, the Medicaid program pays for such devices for lower income people; however, due to the lack of adequate funding for the Medicaid program in the U.S. Virgin Islands, many people with disabilities do not receive the services and devices that are necessary for their daily living. This project demonstrates that by using imagination, one can create the same devices as those sold in catalogues for a more reasonable price. Fifteen devices were created, ranging from devices for positioning to communication aids to tools for every day living. These devices were created with an 88% decrease in price from those commercially sold. The devices created were proven to be equally capable of performing the same needed functions as those purchased.

NOISE-PROOF HEADPHONE
Jiayao Zhou
Jinyuan High School, No.2169, Xincun Rd., Shanghai,China

The primary objective of this project was to solve the problem of voice communication in the environments of high noise levels. This equipment, using a pressure transducer against the jugular skin of human body, captured the vocal vibrating signals generated by the human resonant cavity and propagated through the media of human body. The obtained signals were modulated for transmitting, and finally were received and transformed back to the original vocal signals by acceptor in the noise-proof headphones. The combination of the voice acquisition method of high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the conventional headphone is better for the voice communication and hearing conservation in the high-noise environment. The technological drawback of piezoelectric ceramic is also discussed in this paper. The sensor part was composed of several single sensors with different frequency response . Their harmonic peak superposed to a frequency response within the range of 80 to 6k Hz. The use of composite sensor was to overcome the narrow frequency response of single sensor. A treatment of electronic circuit compensation and composition was added at the rear-end. This kind of design could overcome the drawbacks of high-frequency attenuation and low intelligibility of using single sensor. What¡¯s more, the sensor was placed in a rectangular cavity (resonant frequency=1kHz) with its edge mounted by a spring in order to kill some non-relevant frequency and also to enhance the voice character of the obtained signals.

ROLLA/CLEAN - A PAINT ROLLER CLEANER AN EFFECTIVE AND EASY TO USE HOUSEHOLD TOOL
Jason David Lowe
Lancaster Royal Grammar School, UK

My project demonstrates a concept that was born out of a need to effectively clean used decorating rollers, with a minimal mess to the person decorating and their household environment: normally a tedious and time-consuming task.<br><br> <br><br>After use, the dirty roller is placed in a cylindrical container and subjected to mains water pressure. The water is aimed at an angle onto the full length of the roller, via a column of jets at regular intervals. The action of the jets causes the roller to spin in the cylinder relatively fast, so that it sheds the water and emulsion mix. The roller is cleaned in two ways: firstly by mains pressure, forced through fairly small diameter jets, and secondly by the centrifugal force acting upon the roller.<br><br> <br><br>My device is supplied with mains pressure tap water through a hose from the cold-water tap. The device seats snugly into the sink’s plughole, thus ensuring that any soiled water is self contained and disposed of down the drain.<br><br> <br><br>The design and research process has progressed via a series of practical prototypes. With each, I have been able to address technical and aesthetical issues arising from the previous model.<br><br> <br><br>This project has not been my A-Level Design and Technology coursework and so I have been developing it in my free time. From conversation with my parents and other adults about decorating, I feel that there is both a need and a potentially large market for this easy to use and effective product.<br><br>

CONSTRUCTION OF A FUNCTIONAL, DURABLE AND EFFICIENT PHOTO-ELECTRIC UNIT THAT WORK OUT OF THE SUN
Emmanuel Carpena
Radians School, Cayey, P.R. , 00737

This project is about the activation of photo-cells, which are hidden in a dark environment, from the sunlight. In the experiment, we want to prove scientifically, the loss of efficiency and the loss of voltage in a photo-cells being activated by the light of the sun reflected by mirrors. To prove this, a model was constructed, consisting of five corners with a mirror at 45º and six sampling points, where the voltage from the activated photo-cell was measured and compared with the control group established at the begining of each tests. These tests were repeated at different days and different times. The results shows that: the photo-cell were activated after five turns of the light and that the loss of efficiency increase after each turn.

GLABENATOR: AN ADVANCED ALTERNATIVE AND AUGMENTATIVE COMMUNICATION DEVICE
Apurv Mishra
DAV Public School, Bhubaneswar, Orissa, INDIA

<br><br><br> This device “Glabenator” has been developed to act as an Advanced Alternative and Augmentative Communication solution. It targets on the person who need support of communication either due to physical or technical reason. The device is based on a new concept of directional displacement of a point in the skin just above the eyebrows as a data source. AFSDCS (Advanced Forehead Skin Deformation Coding System) was developed to analyze the displacement of the positional indicators and find POMAD (Point of Maximum Displacement).<br><br> The sensor is fabricated on the basis of innovative rod bending concept to detect the movement of POMAD.The displacement of the skin causes the rod to interrupt opto-interrupter respective to the direction of displacement. Thus using the data from POMAD displacement the contraction of Corrugator Supercilli and Frontalis muscle is detected. The user contracts these muscles voluntarily to interact with the device.<br><br> The data from the sensor is processed and forwarded to the RF data transmission section which transmits this data. The receiver forwards the data to the micro-controller which is used to select and surf the menu. The motherboard comprises of Voice IC, Computer Cursor Control and LCD Display. Glabenator costs around 30 USD comparing to the present devices which are very costly.<br><br> Thus Glabenator being simple, compact, comfortable, innovative and cheap can make the Alternative and Augmentative Communication affordable by the common man in cases of communication disability .It can be also used to zoom lens and operate computer in space.<br><br>

BLIND NAVIGATION
Steven A. Gasior
St. Joseph Secondary, 5555 Creditview Rd., Mississauga, Ontario CANADA

The project is the result of the experimentation with the deciphering of audible tones generated by a navigation invention that acts as “second eyes” to relay information about the wearer’s surroundings. Blind people are given greater mobility, firefighters in dense smoke filled buildings can find survivors or divers can locate objects in muddy waters.<br><br> Through experimentation we found sounds having a frequency of 350-700 Hz worked best! . An apparatus named URNS “ultrasonic ranging navigation system” was built and tested by using a difference in amplitude and frequency in either the left or right ear. The URNS uses an array of ten head mounted sensors that scans a 180-degree arc and can measure distances up to 3 meters. One mode of operation alerts the person if an object is present within 1 meter of them. It generates a tone representing the objects location to the ear on the side the object is located. If no objects are present then no tone is made. <br><br>The second mode calculates the rate of position change of an object and identifies in which general area it is located by signalling a tone representing that sector. As a person is walking the program anticipates stationary and moving objects so the person can! avoid them. <br><br>With training and practice URNS can be used to navigate situations in which navigation by sight is made difficult either by environment or a physical disability. <br><br>

ILLUMINATION KIT FOR REMOTE PLACES
Paulo Henrique Marques de Oliveira
Colegio Militar de Manaus, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil

The project was born from my observations on the Urubus River, in the Amazonian River region, where I used to fish with my father. Watching the rim and its houses, I observed many traditional small diesel night-lamps, commonly used in this region. These lamps discharge a black smoke, which is very harmful to health, and are a big danger of burning down the houses, most of which are made of straw. Besides that, diesel is an expensive fuel for local families, who survive through fishing and family plantation. I remembered seeing on a television program a pedal operated energy generator. I started my project based on a car alternator as an energy generator. <br><br> Combining simple materials such as a US$15 30A Alternator and a US$1 wooden bike hoop (to build an amplification box), allowing me to run several tests, and tryouts with different materials, until I found the right ones. The energy generator unit is composed of an alternator and a wooden bike hoop connected together by a leather strap. To substitute regular lamps and decrease the energy consumption, I combined nine LEDs.<br><br> Combining all the materials I was able to develop this project that generates light through pedaling, proving that the theory base was right, and producing a cheap and practical Illumination Kit for a price within US$50 to US$70.<br><br>

EMBEDDED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ROBOT
Colin Patrick O'Flynn
Westdale Secondary School, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada

A method of testing different algorithms is required when working with artificial intelligence. These algorithms can be tested on a computer, but a computer is only able to simulate the input and output to the artificial intelligence, whereas a mobile robot will provide real-life inputs. The engineering goal of this project was to explore the possibility of constructing a mobile robotic development platform for neural networks that would allow testing of neural network algorithms and the development of new algorithms. <br><br>The resulting system used a backplane architecture, where circuit boards plug into one main board (the backplane). The circuit boards communicate between each other using a communications protocol designed specifically for this system called the StannBus. The resulting design is modular and expandable, as different boards can be plugged in as required. Currently the system has three boards: the processor board that is dedicated to running the neural network, the output board, and the sensor board. All hardware and software that may be needed when testing artificial neural network algorithms, such as a colour camera, an ultrasonic rangefinder, a random number generator, the physical storage medium for the neural network, the software that allows access to the storage medium in a structured manner, as well as the software that will generate the weight and neuron lists used in neural networks is provided. <br><br>It is possible to create a robotic development platform for artificial neural networks. The framework of this project allows expansion for more research into artificial neural network algorithms.<br><br>

While grafting black pepper onto Colubrinum (Piper colubrinum Link), it had been noticed that freshly cut Colubrinum can attract the “Oriental fruit fly” (OFF). Therefore, to exploit local plant to trap the OFF, the alluring effect of seven species of local plants; namely Holy basil (Ocimum sanctum Linn.), Wan-chuk-mot-look (Curcuma comosa Roxb.), Plu-pa (Piper aurantiacum Miq.), Toi-ting (Ruellia Tuberosa Linn.), Tropical almond (Terminalia catappa Linn.), Phlai (Zingiber cassumunar Roxb.), and Colubrinum had been investigated. The plant parts, trap designs and period of time best attracted the OFF were also investigated. The best alluring effect to OFF was found while using Colubrinum stem with the bottom-gate trap during 9 to noon. A low-cost and easy-to-make trapping glue was formulated by mixing natural rubber latex, cooking oil, and fluid from crushed Colubrinum leaves at the volume proportion of 1:8:4. By using Thin Layer Chromatography, methyl eugenol was found to be a component of the crude extract from Colubrinum leave. Dichloromethane was found to be the best solvent, comparing to hexane and methanol, extracting methyl eugenol from Colubrinum leave. <br><br> The use of alluring agent extracted from Colubrinum can provide an alternative to insecticide hence lessened chemical residue on our environment and especially our food.

EFFICIENCY ENHANCEMENT OF PLASMA LOUDSPEAKER
Gabor Nemeth
Pálfy János Technikal Secondary School 5000 Szolnok Hungary 

In everyday life the dynamic sound radiators have become an important part of human life considering both listening to music and entertainment. But this kind of speaker has a lot of disadvantages, like harmonic and partial distortion and radiates only one direction.<br><br>In order to receive the more perfect sound of acoustic instruments, or the singing voice, we have to use a transmitting channel, in which the scale of distortion is negligible. One way of eliminating this harmful effect is to establish some kind of plasma in the air. The plasma is an ionized gas in the fourth aggregate, which, in this case is generated as corona-discharge. From the survey results it has turned out that the instrument transmits clearer sound, and has greater performance, than the previous plasma sound radiators. Its further advantage is that it expressively demonstrates such applications of theoretical plasma-physics.

Drying up the laundry during rainy season is one of the most common problems faced by people living in monsoon prone countries. In addition, countries that are near to the equator are exposed to direct ultra violet (UV) light. UV light may damage the fabric on garments.<br><br> To solve these problems, a special device called a Cyclone Dryer is invented. It is made based on the concept of heating, air circulation and drying. The prototype size is 4ft X 3ft X 2ft that is suitable for normal clothes. It has twelve 100-Watt bulbs, an exhaust fan and six air vents on the side. The heat produced by light bulbs and the exhaust fan creates air circulation to circulate heat and remove all moisture. Twelve 100-Watt bulbs were chosen as the heating element based on research that was done to find the optimum number of bulbs to dry the clothes. Plywood was chosen as the best material after research was done. The cost to build the Cyclone Dryer is much cheaper than other dryers in the market, making it affordable for everyone.<br><br> The time taken to dry 6 pieces of garments was 17 minutes whereas 16 pieces took 43 minutes only.<br><br> As a conclusion, the Cyclone Dryer was effective to dry clothes in a short time and it also has great commercial potential in international marketing, as it is useful household appliance.<br><br>

“FINDING AN ALTERNATIVE INSULATING MATERIAL FOR SPACE SHUTTLES” "BURNT TO A CRISP"
Mary Elizabeth Cromwell
Good Hope School, Christiansted, St. Croix, USVI

No astronauts want their life to be put at risk because an inadequate insulating material was used to protect their space shuttle. For this reason I have attempted to find an insulating material with superb insulating qualities to replace silicon as the insulating agent for a space shuttle. I tested kapton polyamide film, and nomex tape to see if they would prove to be better insulating agents than silicon. While nomex failed drastically, kapton proved to have superb insulating qualities. Silicon did show resistance, but it shed when exposed to the heat. That shedding has caused fatal accidents in the past, hence the need for an alternative insulating agent. As a further study I would suggest testing to see if kapton could be used as a shield for the silicon to prevent the silicon from shedding. <br><br>

HEATED WATER AT LOW COST. THE CONSTRUCTION OF A SOLAR HEATING WITH RECYCLING MATERIALS USING THERMO-SOLAR ENERGY AS A TOOL TO CONFRONT SOCIAL PROBLEMS.
Allon Rozansky
Escola Brasileira Israelita Chaim Nachman Bialik, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil

In Brazil there are electric showers in most residences and this is very expensive for the low-income population. I chose solar energy application as a source generator after verifying the main energy sources applied around the world and the current energetic crisis that hits human beings. The detailed study on conventional solar heatings let an essential part of its components be replaced by correspondent elements made by recycling materials. The viability and durability of each component was checked based on evidences of light and heating resistance.<br><br> The heating is basically formed by a structure of PVC pipes, two litter bottles of PET, tubes of toothpaste and water box. The capacity of heated water content will depend on the size of the solar collector that is constructed. Optimization of available solar energy led to the study of the orientation and inclination of the collectors in relation to the position of the sun and residence where the equipment will be installed. The heating water is stored in a tank that is thermically isolated by materials that avoid heating loss for the environment. The piping system that links the collectors is made of PVC traditional pipes which are commonly used in residential hydraulical installation.<br><br> In environmental temperatures in spring(an average of 71F to 84F), the prototype showed a heating potential of 66 per cent in average in Sao Paulo, reaching 113F. The total cost invested in the system was about 25 dollars, showing to be a practicable alternative of energy production and cost reduction, considering that the average expense with electric shower for a four member family is approximately of 7.50 dollars a month, which corresponds to 5 per cent of the Brazilian living wage.<br><br> This project can contribute to a social improvement, an environmental preservation, a reduction in the greenhouse gas emanation-CO2, and the future possibility of job creation.

GRASS TRIMMER ROBOT - RCG-1
Bruno Marques Prescott
Colegio de Aplicacao Emmanuel Leontsinis, BRASIL

Trimming the grass, such a simple thing, can become tiresome, boring and stressing as time goes by.<br><br> Many people have a lawn at home, and they always need to trim it. Most of them don’t like or just don’t have time to spend almost a hole day with this kind of job. And also some companies that use to be decorated with lawns, they must usually pay somebody only to take care of it.<br><br> In both cases, people always complain about the cost of this service that concerns the electric expenses.<br><br> Nowadays, the electrical trimmers spend about 300/1.200W (if it works with nylon), which demands a cost of US$ 75,00/US$ 300,00; if it’s a trolley model (working with blades) the costs go from 500 to 2.500W, with prices from US$ 250,00 to US$ 600,00.<br><br> Considering all these points, I created the robot aiming the reduction of the electrical costs. That’s why all the system is based on rechargeable batteries, which when compared to any of the trimmers used nowadays, presents a cost 0,04% less than a normal one, or less than 1W of electrical energy consumption, that is necessary to charge the batteries.<br><br> Another kind of trimmer, very used, is the one that runs on fuel, that is more economic than the above mentioned one, because fuel is not as expensive as electricity. On the other hand, the cost of a trimmer like this is from US$ 900,00 to US$ 2.000,00, what makes them more expensive than the electrical ones. Also, this kind of trimmer works based on a fossil fuel, and today I believe we must protect this kind of energy. The operator needs a special course to manage these machines, because they are so dangerous. Most of these courses are very expensive, because it’s necessary to have an individual instructor and these are paid by the hour. There are also some other costs that must be taken into consideration, related to buying special protections for the use of the two above mentioned kinds of trimmers, such as: overalls, boots, glasses and gloves.<br><br> Thinking about all these points, I have created a robot able to trim the grass, the RCG-1, to make the job easier and to reduce the costs. It is commanded by radio waves, works with rechargeable batteries, there is a micro-camera in it to have a good view of the way where it goes, avoiding crashes, damaging the plants or even itself. It can also be controlled by a PC. I built it to be practical and to last longer.<br><br>

CLEAN-N-GOOD FRUIT PROTECTOR
Suprawee Pongthongcharoen
Suranaree Wittaya School, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand

In present days, there is considerably a large amount of insecticide being used in the agricultural industry. The usage of insecticide has increasingly and inevitably caused pollution to the natural environment. This project presents the alternative to reduce the usage of insecticide. By using the specially designed tool proposed here, the way of protecting fruits from insects by wrapping up on its branch is more convenient, efficient, and no insecticide. The agriculturalist can use this tool from the ground to wrap fruits on its tall branch with pre-installed plastic bags. This helps prevent accident from climbing up trees to manually wrap fruits. In addition, this tool can be used up to four wraps in one setup providing better time efficiency, approximately more than 2 fruits per minute. The performance of wrapping fruits is averaging at 95 percents. The wrapped fruits obviously show the better quality both in appearance and taste. The most importantly, there is no insecticide used in order to protect fruits from insects, making the earth a better place to live for everyone.

GRID COMPUTING FOR EVERYONE
Ryo Kanbayashi
Tsukuba University Sakado High School, Sakado City Saitama Prefecture, JAPAN

This research demonstrates how grid computing can be made accessible to general users. A large proportion of personal computers in society are idle for a large part of the time, and the computing power they represent goes unutilized. The present work was undertaken in an attempt to tap these resources through the use of grid computing techniques, which may seem inaccessible to general users. This project has now been launched, addressing the strong demand for grid computing projects in Japan.<br><br>The project has involved the development of distributed matrix computation software, which was initially applied on the author's campus in order to utilize available computing resources. After the software was fully developed, the Collatz Counter-Example Search Project for Mersenne Prime Number Candidates (Collatzanti-example@home) was launched, representing the first individually driven Internet-based distributed computing project in Japan. Now, approximately 40 computers in residences of general users are contributing to the project using a screensaver or tasktray-resident program written in C and Visual Basic. As a result, a calculation that would have taken 2 years using a single computer has been completed in only 5 months. More importantly, this demonstrates that grid computing can be expected to become more accessible to general users in the future.<br><br>

CARRUEDNERGY: "THE NEW SOURCE OF ELECTRIC ENERGY"
Wilmarie Fuentes-Payan
Bonifacio Sanchez Jimenez High School

This research focused on the effective utilization of mechanical energy in a highly transited highway. The project proposed the installation of cylinders leveled in the pavement close to the tollbooth of highways. The idea was that the mechanical energy generated when cars pass by can be used to produce electric energy through generators and transformers. The electric energy produced would be stored in a battery and it would be enough to lighten the highways. The title of the project is Carruednergy “the new source of electric energy. The problem was, will a system of cylinders installed in the pavement close to the tollbooths of highways produce enough electric energy as the cylinders move when cars pass by at a speed of 35 mph or more? The hypothesis established that the cylinders system installed leveled in the pavement close to the tollbooths of highways, will produce enough electric energy to lighten the highways. There are three basic steps in the procedure: installation of the cylinders and of a system of pulleys connected to a piston and to rails to provide support to the system, installation of cables, connection of the system to a transformer, a generator and a battery to storage the energy to be used in the lighting system. This system will help the environment and the economy because, it will represent a great saving compared to the outrageous investment required to maintain the actual energy system. The energy generated in this way may be used for other purposes also.<br><br>

SWIMMING SILICON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A THERMAL-ELECTRICALLY COOLED LIQUID SUBMERSION SYSTEM
Issa Samih Ashwash
The Good Hope School

Computer components are increasing productivity at a rapid rate; performance doubles almost biannually. Unfortunately, greater performance is paralleled by greater electrical consumption and heat-creation. This causes a dilemma: the only way to increase performance is to increase heat, but heat can damage components and affect their performance. This project is intent on creating a thermal-electrically cooled liquid submersion system for heat-sensitive computer components and comparing that system to the standard heatsink/fan combination. It is believed that the cooling system can cut temperatures by as much as 50%. As a passively cooled system, temperatures were decreased by a significant 10-15% (especially when considering there is no active cooling). With the introduction of a thermal-electric cooler, temperatures were cut by 20-25%. Thus, this project is successful in that it developed a system significantly cooler than the heatsink/fan combination. However, temperature differences were not as apparent as expected because a lower-wattage cooler was used. Further study mandates the design of an in-case cooling system for the current ATX form factor and the soon-to-be-released BTX form factor.

THE ALKALI FUEL CELL IN A CAR
Adam Ayesh Shanah
AlMaaref School, Amman, Jordan

I investigated an alternative source of energy because in the next few generations fuel as we know it will run out, also that this fuel we use is very pollutant to our atmosphere. With fuel cells all this could change. Using research and investigations in our school laboratories to see how the fuel cell would work and what can be done to improve it note that the alkali fuel cell is communally used by NASA in their space missions I’m attempting to put it in a car and give the car maximum efficacy. Since hydrogen can not be found here we had to work with normal hydrogen in its gas state by adding zinc to a sulfuric acid and collecting the hydrogen produced I used sulfuric acid because it will produce two moles of hydrgoen for each one mole.<br><br>Using the alkali fuel cell each molecule of water which forms produces about 1.226 volts which was found only water and electricity are produced in this reaction. Using an electric motor it runs the car, the car has basic aerodynamics to improve efficiency in every way possible. The alkali fuel cell is a lot better to use in cars and is very possible to be the future of automobiles as we know yet only producing water and electricity will make a safer and cleaner earth.<br><br>

DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION A WIRELESS POTABLE WATER METER AND SYSTEM
Patricia Torres
University Gardens High School, San Juan Puerto Rico

During the past years there has been a steady increase in the cost of water served by the Water and Sewers Authority of Puerto Rico (A.A.A. by its name in Spanish),The high of water escapes and the continuous sabotage of water meter's have generated a crisis, affecting most of the consumers in Puerto Rico, The hypothesis for this proyect was that using a new wireless digitalized water meter will improve the service and decrease the costs of drinkable water. The expertise of an electronic technician, a civil engineer,a electrical engineer and a mechanical engineer was very useful for the construction of this new water meter. The water meter, called "CONRESCA" because of its Spanish name (meaning remote no - cable), is a special meter that generates its own energy and communicates with a central wireless system using new technology.This meter was constructed and tested and it proved to be much more effective than the one now in use by the A.A.A. Table and graphs were used to ilustrate the results of using "CONRESCA" regarding the amount of water and the time it takes to register it and the relationship between voltaje and time. Future projections include presenting a proposal to the goverment showing that by using this water meter throughout Puerto Rico the consumers can reduce their water expenses.

WIRE TENSION TESTING SYSTEM II
Juan Manuel Arechaga
Escuela de Educacion Tecnica "Don Luis Bussalleu"-Rojas-Buenos Aires-Argentina

In 2001 a wire tension testing machine was designed and constructed for didactic use. In the current phase, the investigation began with the aim of building up a better version of the machine, which had been made in 2001, and whose functionality, exactitude and rank of operation allowed its use in some professional fields. <br><br>That is why, the machine was redesigned in 3 successive stages: mechanical optimization, electronic optimization and computer science optimization. In all the stages, the redesign was based on the analysis, correction and optimization of the systems from the results observed in the 2001 machine. Therefore, the mechanic and electronic measuring system was investigated, designed and tried in specifics laboratories in materials tests areas of the prestigious research centers. The electronic system of data acquisition was optimized and tried using modern techniques of low noise.<br><br>Finally, a new software was developed using National Labview 6.0. The redesign also included improvements of the parts manufacturing process. <br><br>This new development let us increase the rank of operation from 60kg to 200kg, diminish the medium error of measurement from the 11 to 3% and to increase the functionality of the machine remarkably, maintaining dimensions, weight and cost of the previous design approximately. <br><br>The results were verified with internationally calibrated machines demonstrating that the aims had been reached, obtaining a machine with greater functionality, greater rank of operation, and minimum error.

PHOTO-CELIS ACTIVATION BY MIRRORS
Emmanuel Carpena
Radians School, Cayey, Puerto Rico, USA

This project is about the activation of photo-cells, which are hidden to the sunlight. The purpose of this research is the use of the sunlight as an alternate source of energy. Although the functionality of the photo-cells is been proved, its effectiveness is limited to the fully exposition to the sunlight. The installation and the maintenance of photo-cells, in the roof of buildings is risky and complicated. The experiment, try to prove the photo-cells can be activated in a remote place, hidden to the sunlight, using mirrors. The photo-cell will generate energy, if the mirrors are place in the appropriate angle and the path of light is not interrupted by any obstacle. To prove this, a model was constructed placing mirrors in adequate angles, inside the passageway to reflect the light to the photo-cells. At the end of the research, the photo-cells were activated by the sunlight that was reflected by the mirrors. In addition, it was demonstrated that the photo-cells can be activated by artificial source of light.

WATTS UP WITH TORQUE! MULTIPLE ROTORS: A HIGH EFFICIENCY WINDMILL DESIGN
Dayna Marie Walker
St. Mary's Catholic Secondary School, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada

The purpose of this project was to determine if multiple rotors would increase the electrical output of a horizontal axis windmill. A laboratory scale windmill was designed and built. Torque, the force created by the rotating windmill axis, was used to turn the axle of three sizes of DC motors and generate electricity. Electrical current in mAmps and electrical force in mVolts were measured and electrical energy in mWatts calculated.<br><br>The experiment was designed to measure the effect of the independent variables (rotor size, placement, number, fan speed, motor size) on the dependent variables (wind speed, RPM, mAmps and mVolts). Wind speed was measured with an anemometer, RPM with a tachometer and mAmps and mVolts with a multimeter. Twelve rotor variables were tested at two fan speeds, using three sizes of DC motors. Each measurement was repeated ten times. RPM and wind speed were used to calculate tip speed ratio. Statistical analysis was performed to assess the quality of the data collected.<br><br>Multiple rotors produced more electricity than a single rotor and operated at lower wind speeds. Adding a second rotor produced the largest increase (over 2000%) in electricity generated.<br><br>Overall, three 28 cm rotors, placed side by side, with offset blades, coupled to a 12 V DC motor produced the most electrical energy. This rotor combination consistently had the highest tip speed ratios and produced the most electrical energy at both fan speeds and with all three motors. However, the addition of a third rotor only increased the amount of electricity generated by two rotors by an average of 29%.

DESIGN PARAMETERS AFFECTS BUILDING RESISTANCE TO RALEIGH, LOVE AND SHEAR WAVES UNDER SIMULATED EARTHQUAKE EVENTS
Wilmarelis Perez
Colegio Radian, PO Box 371298, Cayey, Puerto Rico 00737-1298

In this research an earthquake simulator and scale models were constructed to test if design parameters such as a base insolator or stilts affects buildings resistance to induced waves of the Raleigh, Love and Shear type. Data was collected on the time buildings resist to collapse in each trial. <br><br>The results show that the best construction which perform satisfactorily under all the waves was the one with interior fortification and not the one with a base isolator as expected. The later,did not perform as well as the buildingwith interior fortificationand the building held by stilts when subjected to Raleigh waves. Under Shear waves buildings with stilts and the one with fortifications have similar performance in the simulator. The implications of the findings in structural engineering is discussed.

LIQUID ENERGY: PROTOTYPE FOR GENERATING ELECTRICITY FROM WAVES & TIDAL CURRENTS
Austin James Shelton III
Father Duenas Memorial School, Mangilao, Guam

This project was developed to determine whether or not electricity could be produced and harnessed from the flow of current caused by drainage of water brought into a lagoon by wave action. As Guam and many other places in the world struggle through tough economic times and increases of oil prices, many families need inexpensive ways to obtain electricity. <br><br>I built a machine out of recycled materials from junkyards and named it “Liquid Energy”. By creating a triangular frame with a sheet metal funnel, the current is forced toward a propeller mounted on to the lower drive unit of an outboard motor. The current causes the propeller to turn, spinning a pulley system with a 12-volt, 60-amp car alternator. After a twelve-volt car battery excites the alternator, the alternator puts out voltage to charge the battery. <br><br>Several tests were conducted at various beaches where the current flows in one direction all-day. I took readings from the voltage meter to find that the alternator put out a constant average of 12.02 volts. By attaching a 300-watt direct current to alternating current power converter to the battery, I was able to run a 25-watt light bulb and a small fan at the same time while the alternator was still charging the battery. Using Watt’s Equation, I found that the alternator was putting out an average 2.08 amps to power appliances such as the light bulb and fan. <br><br>

"PAR - III" - PAVING OUR FUTURE
Gina May Gallant, Kelly Road Secondary School 
Prince George, British Columbia, Canada

For three years, the basic principle of this project was based on a natural occurring bonding process taking place between the plastic and asphalt since they are both hydrocarbon based molecules. This occurs under our present paving process making a new and improved material, which will reduce cracking and rutting that causes major repairs to our present road structures, reducing the long-term costs. Using the scientific method and multiple technologies PAR was taken to the development stage. This is a new revolutionary paving material that incorporates the use of recycled plastics from landfills as a partial replacement of aggregate. With the use of recycled plastics it will reduce the accumulation in landfill sites, making it an environmentally friendly pavement. By studying and applying many of the present testing and development methods to this product, the end result achieved a balance between business and the environment.<br><br>As project coordinator the job of developing the blends, operating conditions for blending, percentages of plastics and temperatures for mixing and laying were developed. 7.5 tons of donated ground recycled number 2 plastics were used. A process of adding the plastic to the mixing plant was achieved, because the project had merit 2 test patches were done. Results of the 2nd test patch were good and a road was paved. The road is being monitored and data is being collected in a unique way, it was developed for this project based on measurements and observations. Evaluations of core samples were done using the ASTM Marshall methods, for compression, air voids, density, stability and flow. The results from these core samples show extremely positive results, which can be found in the project report.<br><br><br><br>

PROXIMITY FIRE ALARM
James Julian Malin
Oakham School, Oakham, Leicestershire, UNITED KINGDOM

The Proximity Fire Alarm can position a person in a building during an emergency. In the case of a fire, the main control screen will indicate the position of a person/persons within the building. A screen indicates if an individual room is on fire, thereby allowing the rescue teams to view a safer passage through the building.<br><br>Once a fire has been discovered in a building, it is evacuated and a register is called to ensure that everyone is out of the building. Emergency teams have to systematically check through each room for the trapped person/s, with everyone’s lives potentially in danger.<br><br>The Proximity Fire Alarm works by using a RFID transmitter unit, which is integrated into a watch or employee ID card. The system is activated by skin contact when wearing the watch and by a tilt switch on the employee ID card. This ensures that if a watch/ID card is left in a locker, no signal will be transmitted.<br><br>Each room within a building will have a RFID receiver, which is encased in a flame retardant material. This receives signals given off by the RFID transmitter, which are passed through a LAN cable. The software then transfers the location of individuals, within that building, onto a plan of that building and displays the information.<br><br>In an emergency, the monitor indicates exactly which room a person/s is located along with any medical information held for that person/s. This will benefit the emergency teams by saving both life and time.<br><br>

STUDY OF LOW-CYCLE FATIGUE OF HEAT-TREATED AL-MG ALLOYS
Nayomi Zuleika Plaza
Eugenio Maria de Hostos, Mayaguez, Puerto Rico

Aeronautical industries require recyclable materials with maximum strength, minimum thickness and lowest cost such as Al-Mg alloy 5182, which is used in beverage can tabs and reinforcement members. Since the AA 5182 is heat treatable its mechanical properties can be improved by heat treatments. The Al-Mg tabs were heat treated within a temperature range between 170ºC to 450ºC beginning with solubility and then aging treatment to be fast cooled later for retaining the formed microstructure. The tabs were tested in low-cycle fatigue, which consists of imposing a cyclic deformation until the material breaks. To support former results, sample topography was viewed with an Atomic Force Microscope; the fractures were analyzed using a stereoscope and microhardness was measured. The alloy’s fatigue strength, measured by the number of loading cycles, increased in the first two hours of exposure to the aging treatment at any temperature. The maximum resistance was reached at 2.5 hours. After this time, it dropped in all treatments except for the treatment at 270ºC where it decreased gradually. The pattern of the fatigue strength increase could not be defined due to the irregular geometry of the tab, which affected the type of fracture and the number of cycles. In the microstructure, the formation of precipitates at heat treatment low temperatures (170ºC and 270ºC) caused a low fatigue resistance in the material. However, high temperatures (370ºC) facilitated a precipitate dissolution reinforcing the aluminum matrix and making it more resistant. For statistic results, metallographic analysis should be applied to all samples.

THE FUTURE IS FLYING LOW III
Gaetan Kristian Kenway
Marystown Central High School, Marystown, Newfoundland, Canada

The purpose of the experiment is to determine the best dihedral angle for a wing flying in ground effect and to use these research findings to construct a model wing in ground effect craft (ekranoplan). A prediction was made that the dihedral angle of -5 degrees would have the highest average lift to drag ratio.<br><br> To test the wing, a self constructed wind tunnel capable of measuring lift and drag on a wing was used. Five different dihedral angles of (5,0,-5,-10,-15 degrees) were tested. Each dihedral angle was tested at six different angles of attack (0,1,2,3,4,5 degrees) and at five different height percentages (10%,20%,30%,40%,50%) For each test combination, the lift and drag for the wing were recorded and the lift to drag ratio was determined. The data was collected via a computer through a control program written specifically for this application. <br><br> After analysis, the dihedral angle of +5 degrees, proved marginally to have the highest average lift to drag ratio, followed closely by the 0 degree dihedral angle. Contrary to my prediction, the dihedral angle of -5 degrees did not exhibit the highest lift to drag ratio.<br><br> The conclusion drawn is that a dihedral angle of 0 degrees would be the most useful, since a positive dihedral angle would not be practical for a wing in ground effect craft.<br><br> The findings of this project along with that of previous years, have culminated into the innovative design for a model ekranoplan. <br><br>

THE ROADCONSTRUCTION'S EFFECTS ON THE DRIVING CONDITIONS FOR CARS
Robert Henriksson
Hjalmar Lundbohmsskolan, Kiruna, Sweden

In Kiruna city, Sweden, there are two road sections which, in my eyes, appear to be traffic hazards. They consist of one roundabout with a roadway angled outwards and one slope with a pedestrian crossing. For the slope I calculated the increase of braking distance due to the decline. For the roundabout I calculated the decrease in the maximum speed, due to the roadway being angled outwards, a car can keep when turning, without the tires loosing the grip.<br><br>The purpose of this project was to create a basis from which further judgment could be made to determine if the constructions of the road sections are dangerous, considering traffic matters.<br><br>The calculations were conducted with formulas, which I myself made, and friction coefficients which I received from VTI (the Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute). The roundabout was compared with two fictitious roundabouts with the same dimensions, one plain and one with the roadway angled inwards. In the calculations, I have also made comparisons for different tires, velocities and states of the road, like icy, wet or dry asphalt.<br><br>The results show clearly that when roads are constructed with an angled roadway it affects the driving conditions for cars significantly, especially if the tire friction is low. Consequently when the roadway is angled wrongly the construction becomes more or less a traffic hazard as the case is with the road sections I have scrutinized.

MULTIBIKE
Renato Angulo Chu
Holy Trinity School, Lima - Peru

The purpose of this work was to address, through technology, the need for employment in Peru.<br><br> <br><br>MutliBike has as an objective to improve the standard of living of the people in question and to look for new strategies for generating employment. For this reason, the use of the technology I designed and constructed could be the key to helping to break the difficult crisis Peru is navigating. This project addresses the problem of using mechanical energy in places where electric energy is scarce. Mechanical energy driven by a person using a bicycle using their locomotion made the blades of a blender move, and in this way, it was able to blend. After accomplishing this task, I adapted a revolution-counting system so that those who use this project can obtain the distance they have traveled and, in addition, know how many revolutions it takes to blend fruit. My new project (MultiBike) will contribute to the development of employment in our country by means of a simple plan, and solve various problems. Entrepreneurship, the sale of diverse products, service sector work, and a reasonable salary are covered. <br><br>Furthermore, I propose techniques to create enterprises using simple machinery. If unemployed people follow my system they will be able to see improvements in their economic future.<br><br>

ANALYSIS OF HYDROPHOBICITY ON COMMON LEAVES AND FABRICATION OF HYDROPHOBIC SURFACE
Jeong Soo Lee
Korea Science Academy, Baekyangkwanmunro111, Busanjingu, Busan, South Korea

A water drop can have different shapes depending on surface properties, which are typically characterized by contact angle. When the contact angle is larger than 150 degrees, the surface is called superhydrophobic, as can be easily found in the surface of a lotus leaf. A superhydrophobic surface has a number of unique properties including self-cleaning effects.<br><br> Recently, people have tried to mimic the surface of a lotus leaf by forming various micro- and nanostructures using different techniques. The motivation of this study is thus to measure the hydrophobic properties of many natural leaves and to fabricate artificial superhydrophobic surfaces.<br><br> It is well known that there are two main factors that determine hydrophobicity: surface topography and chemical composition. <br><br> First, I measured contact angle and surface topography of various natural leaves (Lotus, Taro, Oxalis, Rose petal, White Mangolia, Indian rubber tree, Bowstring hemp, etc) using scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results demonstrated that the surfaces have different micro and nanostructures.<br><br> Second, I made replicas of natural leaves using two polymers (polystyrene (PS) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)) to examine the relation between surface material and hydrophobicity.<br><br> Finally, I fabricated an artificial superhydrophobic surface via soft lithography using a hydrophobic polymer, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The fabricated surface showed an average contact angle close to 150 degrees.<br><br>In conclusion, the hydrophobic nature of many natural leaves was measured and then compared with other replicated or artificially created polymer structures. This study will add to our understanding of how nature has evolved to attain an optimized system and provide a simple route to create artificial superhydrophobic surfaces.

HIGH-SPEED FSO DATA LINK
Jan Svab
High school of Jaroslav Heyrovsky, Prague, Czech Republic

This project describes solution of FSO data link for interconnecting computers or computer networks using Ethernet interface.<br><br> FreeSpaceOptics (FSO) is device using modulated optical beam through the air to obtain optical communication. It works near as the fiber, using LASER or LED to transmit data, but it is transmitted by the air. FSO device has very low latency, because data are processed real-time and transferred at the speed of light. FSO device is very suitable for interconnecting networks in big cities, because the transmission isn't affected by electromagnetic noise from different transmitters, is very fast, full duplex but also is not much reliable for longer distances. Communication distance of FSO is limited by power of transmitter, depends on parameters of used optics and also on weather conditions. Laser transmitter can reach few kilometers, but in strong fog loosing connection. Infrared wavelength has better performance in fog, but not unlimited.<br><br> My project shows modularized solution for low-cost FSO. Modules are: Control board, Transmitter and Receiver. In current configuration of modules device offers speed of 10Mbps full duplex, communication range of 1km, 10BASE-T Ethernet interface with auto-negotiation (according to IEEE 802.3 standard), powering over Ethernet, remote monitoring of link quality.<br><br> Control board is based on Intel Ethernet PHY transceiver, Xilinx CPLD and Texas Instruments MSP430 MCU. Receiver and transmitter design is often adjusted according to needs of specific link. I've got several designs of both of these boards.<br><br> As a useful addition I also created power supply for powering over Ethernet with embedded web server for monitoring signal quality, link status and logging of link parameters. Web Server is also based on TI's MSP430 MCU.

PERSONAL VTOL VEHICLE THE CONCEPT OF COUNTER-ACTING TORQUE EFFECT POSITIVELY
Mohamed Zohair Ammar
Modern Education Schools, Cairo, Egypt

My idea is to create a new personal aerial transportation vehicle. It depends basically on thrust vectoring for its control. Imagine taking the tail boom, tail unit, rotor blades, landing skids and rotor head off a helicopter, so what is left is simply the pod which contains the passengers and the engine. This is basically what this vehicle does to make current VTOL (vertical takeoff and landing) transport more street-friendly. The first question to come to one’s mind is “can you still make it fly without them?” My answer to that is yes, and my proof is the scale model I am building to practically prove that this is possible.<br><br>I am using a ducted fan which is internally mounted for thrust generation, and the vehicle as well as the model will have the capability of flying as well as boat and car capabilities: it can travel on water, on the road or in the air, all merged into one vehicle. The concept I am using to eliminate the tail rotor and unit is completely new and relatively unorthodox. I will be counter-acting the torque effect by varying duct ratio. By this concept the thrust I will be using to level out the vehicle is working in the same direction as the main thrust, therefore in this case I have managed to make torque work with me positively, which doesn’t happen in a normal helicopter, in my opinion much more efficient. That is in brief what this project is about.<br><br>

TOW AND GO FENCE POST HAMMER
Phil Alexander Cowan
Yarm School, Yarm Stockton on Tees England

The trailer mounted Tow and Go fence post hammer has been designed to enable it to be operated quickly and easily with the maximum versatility. Its basic purpose is to hit fence posts into the ground as quickly and effectively as possible as well as being an all in one unit, capable of every fencing requirement. The main advantages of the unit are that it is low weight, can be towed by a variety of vehicles, including quad bikes, an important factor when the weather is wet and the ground soft, plus low ground pressure tyres ensure minimal ground impression. Additionally the Tow and Go hammer is small and compact and able to access difficult places with ease. <br><br>The numerous pieces of equipment that need to be transported from one job to another can be accommodated in the trailer and as it has its own engine to power the hydraulic unit, there is no need for tractor hydraulics. The whole unit is trailer mounted and can be towed by any vehicle with a tow bar. You no longer have to own a tractor to place fence posts into the ground.<br><br>

FLOOD PLUG
Jack Tovey
Lancaster Royal Grammar School, Lancaster, Lancashire, UK

Flooding is a major world-wide problem for buildings. Most buildings have low level airbrick ventilation systems that provide a circulating flow of air preventing damp rising into the building. If the building is in a flood risk area the ventilation system allows floodwater to enter the building though the airbricks in the walls. This water can then rise through the floorboards, flooding and damaging the building. <br><br> The project aim was to design an easy-to-fix, cost effective cover for airbricks, which would automatically close flood water access to the building via the airbrick, but which would allow normal ventilation in no flood conditions. <br><br> Research found that existing airbrick covers had to be closed manually. There were no automatic devices. In the UK, 80% of people flooded have no advance warning of impending flooding. Floods often happen during the night or when people are away from their home. <br><br> The initial design was based on using a polystyrene float that would rise up inside a pipe with the flood water, closing the airbrick. <br><br> The first working model was produced from recycled underground piping and a polystyrene cylinder. It was tested by partial immersion in a river. This design worked well, proving the principle was sound. However, it needed to be improved in terms of size and shape. <br><br> The second prototype was made from wood, but in manufacture would be injection moulded. It works in all conditions, fits airbricks of all shapes and sizes and locations where there is zero clearance underneath the airbrick.

MACHINE TOOL CLEANER DEVIDE
Rosa Iliana Vinas Oliva

It's known that a machine tool at a machine shop, right after it has been used, it needs and requires an efficient cleaning in the less possible time, as well as guarantee an easy and not dangerous job for who have to clean them. A machine tool is a device designed to shape metal materials in order to make machinery pieces. Once one uses a machine tool, remain a lot of fins, grease and dust, hard to clean and dangerous to the eyes if one is not protected.<br><br>After searching and not finding appropriate information about a device cleaner for complex systems or tool-machines, I realized that there was not a simple and suitable mechanism with a full satisfaction or warranty in a well done job in cleaning, which is required.<br><br>So, it was designed a machine that uses few and effective mechanical principles. The goal was build it as easy as possible. Using a pressure-air vacuum cleaner and an electromagnet, we can remove metal fins, quickly and safe.<br><br>The DLMH 19/1 is a device that works by air pressure, based on the Principle of Venturi (more speed, less pressure). To reinforce its functions, it has an electromagnet to draw wastes as steel or iron, after the machine tool has been used. This also has a lubricant system to support the mechanism device and avoid a deterioration of the machine tool. the DLMH19/1 model is being made at the workshop of CBTIS 13 (my school), using it's own tools there.<br><br>If the prototype succeed tests, will benefit DGETI system, which my school belongs to, because there are hundreds of them and all they have the same problem.<br><br>

AUTOMATIC SEPERATING GARBAGE CAN 
Won-Tae Kim
Daejon Daeshin HighSchool, Daejon, South Korea

As industries develop tremendously, pollution has increased at a more rapid rate than before. <br><br> This no doubt is mainly caused by various kinds of waste. Therefore the recycling of domestic and industrial garbage has been a great concern to many nations of the world. <br><br> To solve the above mantioned problem, most countries have been trying to seperate waste into various items such as metal, can bottle, paper and so on. As most of waste classification, however, has been done by the hands of disposers the work is unable to be carried out efficiently.<br><br> This project makes up the disadvantages of old fashioned methods for gathering and sorting out waste. An Automatic Seperating Garbage Can (A.S.G.C) equipped with a built-in device in the basket doesn't require any electric power to operate the dust bin. Once A.S.G.C is given any kind of messy garbage the built-in device in the container is able to senxe the differences of its weight, elasticity and the power of air resistance and sorts out a wide range of waste immediately for itself

HARDENING WHY DO NAILS BEND WHILE DRILLS BREAK?
Mats Liu
Bessemergymnasiet, Sandviken, Sweden

Both nails and drills are made of steel and the differences between them are carbon content and heat treatment. Nails are manufactured of steel wires with low carbon content. The material is deformation hardened but soft and easy to bend. Drills are made of steel with relatively high carbon content. The material is hardened and annealed to great hardness but still brittle. When a drill meats a harder material, it will be broken! How do we combine these properties to get a better material which is both hard and tough? The answer is heat treatment.<br><br>Through three different heat treatment experiments, we could see how steels properties could be brought into line with our needs. One of them was case hardening. Specimens of steel were heated at 825-925ºC. By diffusing carbon into the outer layer of the steel, a hard case with relatively high carbon content was formed while the core of the steel stayed tough. This gave us a hardwearing metal which will not shatter.<br><br>Specimens were prepared by means of various tools and studied with microscope. Hardness was measured according to Rockwell- and Vickers method. I also wrote a computer program to simulate carbon content in steel after case hardening.<br><br>

Cagribey Anatolian High School, Ankara, TURKEY

In this project, a two-phase loop thermoelectric CPU cooler has been designed and materialized, and features of it have been searched. The CPU used in the tests is INTEL Pentium 4 CPU 1.70 GHz and its dimensions are 3.1cms*3.1cms. The effect of using this system was compared with the effects of using the water cooler and the aluminium fan cooler. The comparison illustrates that the water cooler can create a maximum of 34.6 OC temperature difference between hot and cold side of the thermoelectric module while this value reaches a maximum of 50.6 OC in two-phase cooler. Additionaly, two-phase cooler can keep CPU at 9OC, five times lower than the values of the aluminium fan cooler, and it can provide two times faster operating than the aluminium fan cooler does.

Sometimes new domestic flooring does not have a flat, even and smooth surface. This scenario usually causes problems to the buyer when he or she decorates their home as the furniture will not be properly set in place. Uneven flooring also contribute towards the hindrance of domestic movement, and gives bad effects in the interior design aspect. Based on previous year's research, some innovations and upgrading were done. This year's project enhanced certain aspects of the project. It is also accompanied by a smart screen, which displays different types of surface including the percentages of its differentiation. These mechanisms are able to assist developers in identifying the uneven flooring through the audio and visual concept. SMART TRACK II now operates using 9 V rechargeable batteries and this helps in reducing the cost and enhancing the endurance of the contraption. SMART TRACK II also uses a remote control to make it easy to handle. All the information about the floor level is send using a wireless system from SMART TRACK II to the smart screen. The size of SMART TRACK II is further reduced.

INCREASING EFFICIENCY OF ROTORCRAFT BY USING Y-SHAPED WINGLETS
Nokiloz Gia Maghaldadze, Davit Khatiashvili
42th Physical-Mathematical School

We have decided to try to increase rotorcrafts' efficiency by introducing simple but interesting idea which would change propellers' output, in particularly lift generated by it. The concept rose when we were observing the usage of winglets on some airplanes and results that they give. Difference between the pressures on upper and lower surfaces of the wing creates natural airflow that makes its way to the tip of the wing, curls upward and forms vortices. In most airplanes and all helicopters for Increasing Lift and efficiency longer wingspans are used, we decided to prove that winglets are much better alternative. We started searching for similar things for helicopter rotors and found out that nobody has really implemented this idea and we have decided to check what kind of effect Y or T-shaped winglets would have if placed at the end of the rotor blades. For our research with help of Tbilisi Aerospace Manufacturing factory we have made test bench on which we placed electric motor mounted propeller. Test bench had a digital dynamometer (Fourier Systems inc. product Multilog with its force sensor) that was transferring data (Lift force) to the computer in a real time. Using this bench we have made various experiments on different blades (normal and winglet-ended) at different angular speeds and angles of attack. Most of the results we got showed that desired Lift was achieved on less angle of attack while using propellers with winglets. <br><br> After seeing that using our concept gave us desired results, we've decided to make a helicopter model that would visualize how effective our concept is.<br><br> So, by making observations on airplanes, we have introduced the new and simple idea of using winglets for tip-vortex reduction that gave us efficiency increase, that appears in Lift rising and mass reduction.

PERIOLAX AS SUBSTITUTE OF FIBERGLASS
Mario Ho Zhang, Ricardo De Levante, Miguel Vergara
Instituto Panamericano, Panama, PANAMA

Fiberglass is a widely used thermal insulator in Panama constructions. Although it is a very good thermal insulator, substances like silica and styrene are used in its manufacture. Fiberglass products are prone to disperse in tiny particles that irritate the respiratory airways. Besides these substances are strongly associated to diseases like silicosis, which may cause permanent damage to the nervous system. Because it is hazardous connotations, we decided to explore alternative thermal insulators that are not as dangerous as the fiberglass. After considering various types of thermal insulators, we created our own with cellulose as the base, without the need to use toxic chemicals. By using shredded newspaper sheets as the basis for our cellulose insulator, we tested several combinations with other fire-retardants like wool and sodium borate (a substance that causes mild skin irritations, but only if exposed to large amounts) by exposing them to a controlled fire source. From the tested combinations, the one that included the three substances above mentioned, was the most effective, stopping the ignition of the mixture when exposed to fire. We call this mixture Periolax. We also compared our insulator with a fiberglass-based insulator, running an experiment with a light bulb as a heat source and wooden boxes resembling small scaled buildings. The temperature difference between the fiberglass box and the Periolax box was 1oC, favoring the Periolax as insulator. Our results suggest that our insulator is as effective as the fiberglass and did not include toxic components.

A DEVELOPED CLEANING SYSTEM FOR CIRCUIT PRINTING POLLUTED WATER
Yixin Li, Haozhi Ma, Yichen Yuan
Zhengzhou Foreign Lauguage School, Zhengzhou, Henan, CHINA

A new cleaning system is developed based on the Chinese patent entitled with "A kind of cleaning technique for circuit printing polluted water". Two key innovations are conducted as :(1) Dipping of different acidic or basic solution into the porous ceramics and (2)Microwave treatment on the as-used blocked porous ceramics. During the dipping process, the pH value within the porous ceramics can be arbitrarily modified corresponding to the zeta potential of the harmful ingredient in the polluted water. Agglomeration and adhesion of the harmful ingredient is enhanced at the pH value close to its isoelectric point. Cleaning process is thus improved. During the microwave treatment, hybrid effects of high frequency electric vibration and local microwave heating perform. Complicated interfacial effects and tunneling phenomena may appear. The block items within the as-used porous ceramic can be readily removed. Therefore the porous ceramics can be easily cleaned and re-used. Compared to the traditional blowing method, the microwave treatment shows many advantages such as high reliability, low pollution, and much cleaner etc. By the application of above-mentioned improved technique, the cleaning efficiency of the developed cleaning system can be increased by 10%, and the cleaning precision can be increased by 8%.

ALGAE-BASED ATMOSPHERIC REVITALIZATION FOR ZERO-G AND AEROSPACE APPLICATION
Alexander Jahan Rabii, Alexander Raymond Crisara, 
L C Anderson High School, Austin, TX

The objective of this project is to find if algae can replace chemical desiccants for atmospheric revitalization on the International Space Station (ISS). The hypothesis is that the algae based system would obtain 50% efficiency of the desiccant system. The problem this project focuses on is water loss. Desiccant based systems are limited to removing small amounts of CO2 gas from cabin air so electrolysis is used to create a safe level of oxygen in the cabin. Due to electrolysis, desiccant systems lose 25 liters of water per day. The algae system doesn’t use electrolysis and loses 2.8 liters of water per day to evaporation (which can be recaptured). <br><br> The procedures involve building a control (desiccant based) and experimental (algae based) devices for atmospheric revitalization. The testing procedures involve measuring each device's efficiency of carbon dioxide sequestration and oxygen production, with maximum CFM air flow rate, and water loss.<br><br> The data showed the algae based system was more efficient than the desiccant system, achieving a concentration of O2 over 58,000 within the first 30 minutes of operation. The desiccant system only achieved 55,750 PPM after 3 hours of operation. The algae based system sequestered CO2 to a concentration of 800 PPM from a beginning value of 5,000 PPM in the first 30 minutes of operation, the desiccant system sequestered 2,500 PPM of CO2 after 5 hours of operation.<br><br> The conclusion is that the algae based atmospheric revitalization system achieved 50% efficiency of the current desiccant system, proving the hypothesis correct.

IMPROVEMENT OF THE EFFICIENCY OF PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS THROUGH THE COVERING OF SILK OF NEPHILA CLAVIPES
Sandra Itzel Gomez, Lorena Gomez, Dania Lyew
Instituto Sun Yat Sen- Centro Cultural Chino Panameno, Panama, PANAMA

A common problem faced in the use of photovoltaic cells is the effect of temperature in the device efficiency: as the temperature of cell panel increases, its efficiency drops. An approach to solve this problem is to use materials with high thermal conductivity in the back surface of the cell panels. We tested if the use of silk from a tropical spider (Nephila clavipes), as part of the solar cell’s back sheet could increase the cell’s efficiency, by transferring the excess of heat cooling down the device. We studied the relationship between the cell’s output voltage and current as functions of the temperature of the solar cells’ panel by using spider silk from N. clavipes, which is known to have a high thermal conductivity (416 W/m2K ,Wang et al. 2012); we also used a digital multimeter DT- 830B, a solar simulator, a control cell model and solar cells (9,78 cm x 6,98 cm) with different amount of silk layers (8, 14, 20 and 26). When cells were threated with spider silk, we found a marginal improvement of the cell efficiency at temperatures above 40°C (23.88% in control cells and 25.11% cells with silk layers); however, at temperatures below 40°C, the cells without the silk layer showed a higher efficiency value (28.62% control cells and 26.07% cells with silk layers). Further studies are needed to verify whether the improvement values in the cell efficiency are significant as well as the replicability of this work at different scales.

Purpose of the project<br><br>Though the human locomotory system is perfect in doing what it is meant to do, it’s frustrating how limited we are in terms of speed and endurance. <br><br>The purpose of our project is to prove that the use of human power while running can be easily improved. The cheetah is nature’s most perfected model of using power to gain speed. If humans had elastic muscles doing the effort while running (like the cheetah does) the energy lost in the useless oscillating up-and-down movement would be conserved, improving endurance and speed.<br><br> Procedures used<br><br>Springs are used in our apparatus to give elasticity to the leg’s main joint, the knee. <br><br>Tested both with and without elastic joints, a robot provided useful information for the project; the actual data is presented below. The robot moves in a simplified but similar way to the human and it is built to test if adding springs will indeed make a difference. As a result of the encouraging measured data, the final mechanism was built and is being tested.<br><br> Data<br><br>The test robot reached a speed of 0.028 m/s without springs and a speed of 0.044 m/s with springs added.<br><br> Conclusions <br><br>This project uncovers in a very visible way the fact that even tough humans are very limited in terms of running, it’s not because of the lack of power but because of the way it is used, and that a very simple mechanical apparatus can make a great difference. In the same way, elasticity can be used in other applications to reduce energy consume in oscillating movement.<br><br>

We specialized on steel suitable for reactor pressure vessels. Thanks to our supervisor, we were able to get 24CrMoV5-5 steel (It is used for high pressure vessels). It is very similar to reactor pressure vessel power steel.

We used the least square method to determine the transition temperature on 44,5°C. We used this data to carry out theoretical lifetime calculation of the pressure vessel after irradiation by neutron flux.<br><br>The shift of the whole curve was significant – almost +40°C per year. It is only a theoretical calculation but we must say that experimental verification is needed. The shift has to be considered when a reactor pressure vessel is constructed, because of the radiation embrittlement which is caused by the neutron damage and the possibility of a fracture.

ENGINEERING AN OPTICAL CELL TO IMPROVE LITHIUM-ION BATTERY SAFETY
Alejandro Jose Fenn, William Andrew Engel, 
Breck School, Minneapolis, MN

Metal-particle contaminants present a pressing safety concern for all lithium-ion battery markets, since contaminants can lead to short circuits and explosions. We engineered an optical cell that will enable lithium-ion battery manufacturers to develop protocols for ensuring lithium-ion battery safety. The optical cell that we designed functions like a standard lithium-ion battery; however, we designed the cell with a viewing window that allowed for visual examination of metal-particle contaminant dissolution and re-plating that causes short circuits and explosions. We experimented with techniques to incorporate copper, iron, and nickel contaminants onto the positive electrode and then used microscopy coupled with ImagePro Plus time-lapse photography to measure dissolution rates and visualize re-plating of metal contaminants on the negative electrode. Results confirmed the optical cell functioned like a standard lithium-ion battery. Also, results showed that copper dissolved and re-plated rapidly, while nickel did not, suggesting that nickel contaminants have potential to cause latent short circuits. These results support a report by Sony that indicated nickel was the cause of the 2006 lithium-ion battery recall. No conclusions on iron could be made due to poor electrical contact. Our results also showed that fluctuations in voltage seen during testing of metal contaminants was not due to poor cell functionality since optical cell without contaminants showed no voltage fluctuation. This suggests that voltage fluctuations may be used as indicators of the presence of metal-particle contaminants during quality control.

The global trend towards environmental protection has fostered the search for materials derived from renewable resources with low environmental impact for the development of polymeric films used in packaging. In this context, the purpose of this study was to develop potentially biodegradable films based on nanobiocomposites of sodium alginate extracted from Macrocystis pyrifera algae native to the Patagonia region, and reinforced with clay or ash from the volcano Puyehue.<br><br>We designed a method for efficient leaching of alginic acid extraction from brown algae and conversion of the same to sodium alginate. All raw materials were characterized chemically and by infrared spectroscopy. The morphology of the algae and the nanofillers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy.<br><br>All films were obtained by dissolution of alginate (5%) in distilled water at controlled pH (pH 10), followed by evaporation of the solvent. Control films (without load) were produced in this way, using glycerol as a plasticizer (40% by weight of alginate). Reinforced films were obtained by addition of clay or ash (0-3% by weight of alginate). The use of ultrasound to assist the suspension of the materials has shown to be a crucial step in the process. Mechanical properties and biodegradability studies were also carried out.<br><br>The results confirmed that the combination of alginate and plasticizer clay or ash is a promising strategy for the development of potentially biodegradable polymer films.

The main purpose of the project was to engineer new flux technology Super Galvaniz line with all capital investment commercial advantages over the conventional galvanization to produce cost effective, high corrosion resistant, advanced formable and greener sheet coil. The idea was to galvanize coil using twice less Zn (in comparison with existing methods) with the addition of trace amounts of Al.<br><br>The innovation of the project was an optimization of the new flux chemical usage to produce ultra-thin Super Galvaniz coating. The flux chemical composition, line speed and Al composition in the Zn bath were worked out. Then degreasing, pickling and cooling units operational parameters were optimized accordingly. Atomic adsorption spectroscopy (AAS 200), corrosion studies unit (CE 105), HCl based weight loss, salt spray (ASTM B 117) and reflectance measuring (ASTM E 903) methods were used for experiments.<br><br>Optimal chemical composition of the flux was identified to be 58% ZnCl2, 13% NH4Cl at the drying temperature of 120° C. Flux application allowed to reach 6.5% Al on the final product coating. Product was tested in laboratory and in real conditions in all steps of technology optimization process.<br><br>New approach allowed reducing minimum Zn on final product up to 40 g/m2, what is 2 times less than existing methods.

NANOFABRICATION WITH FOCUSED SUNLIGHT
Ye Zhao, Weichao Zhai, 
NUS High School of Mathematics and Science, Singapore, SINGAPORE

We report a novel and economical technique of using focused sunlight in the modification of Copper Oxide (CuO) nanorods. Sunlight was focused onto CuO nanorods through a hybrid system comprising of a refractive telescope with a microscope lens aligned along the principle axis of the telescope. Sufficient intensity of the focused sunlight resulted in the rise in temperature of the CuO nanorods and hence structural modification. The sunlight irradiated CuO nanorods sample displayed a variety of morphologies at the different regions of the irradiated spot, a result of higher light intensities at the central regions as compared to the fringe regions of the spot. The corresponding Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) photographs and the micro Raman spectra taken of these regions demonstrate a spatially resolved conversion of CuO nanorods to Cu2O nanoballs. High resolution tunneling electron microscope (HRTEM) and selective area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of the as-grown and modified nanostructures also verified this conversion. In addition, the analyses revealed the polycrystalline or single crystalline properties of the obtained Cu2O nanoballs, which have not been achieved by conventional laser pruning methods previously. Thus, sunlight assisted patterning of nanorods proves to be an unsophisticated and environmentally friendly alternative for the modification of nanomaterials for possible applications.

Based on the problem affecting some patients who suffer from poor health conditions, who are unable to acquire effective,low-cost, and specialized devices for the monitoring of their vital signs, at a first stage we created a basic prototype for a modular thoracic strap, with the capacity of automatically monitor the patient’s vital signs, and simultaneously transmit the information to the attending physician.<br><br>During that first research, we determined the electronic components and appropriate materials for the optimum operation of the strap and the patient’s ergonomics.<br><br>In the current project, the design of the new device improves the ergonomic and electronic features. The device operates in three stages. The first stage consists of the collection of data,carried out through three specialized sensors:one for body temperature; a flexion sensor used to capture diaphragm movements,so as to pick up the respiratory rhythm; plus a cardiac sensor,which receives the signs emitted by the heart and captured during the diastole and systole cycles. The data obtained by the sensors is immediately processed in order to establish ranges,used by a microcontroller to send a signal on the patient’s health status, caused by a cardiac,temperature,or respiratory problem. The information is transmittedby means of a Bluetooth signal towards a smartphone that uses the Android operating system,and shown through an application especially designed for that platform. The information is simultaneously transmitted by way of a radiofrequency signal towards an electronic armband worn by the healthcare attendant,forwarding the results and warnings through light signals,in the case of any deficiency in the patient’s health.An additional mechanism was added so the patient could call in an emergency.

Climate changes are a topic that topic that worry the population allover the world, especially in the tropical and subtropical areas of the globe. Many things have been created in order to prevent damages on the buildings and houses when these atmospheric phenomena arrive. The problem is that not all of them are safe enough and they do not work during all types of condition. This is why this research intends to create new and improved storm panel shutters that can help prevent greater damages to the structure of the buildings and that can work in all sorts of situations.<br><br> A design was prepared based on simple and common storm panel shutters, but with several differences. Two coats of the "lexan" material were added. One coats closes vertically and the other closes horizontally. In order to make them more versatile, fire alarms and detectors were added with a battery devise in case of a fire so they can open automatically.<br><br> After completing this research it was found that there is a possibility of improving the common storm panel shutters design. This new style can help prevent catastrophes during climate changes or emergencies.<br><br>

Controlled by a MCU, servomotors make the waist and tail swaying in suitable angles, which makes a better ability to accelerate and to turn around. Meanwhile, the pump to pump water into or out from a capsule to control the fish fluctuating 15 degrees up. The simulated fish uses tail's swaying to boost, which resolves the problem of disturbance caused by current, noise made by propeller and makes the energy used more effectively.The robofish is covered by simulated shark skin so as to reduce resistance of water, to save energy, to prevent algae's attachment and to increase swimming speed. The simulated shark skin is a kind of polypropylene material mixed with capsicum powder. There is a wireless video camera and a device of avoiding barrier using sonar system in the front of the fish. Therefore, real time underwater image can be transmitted and the fish can obviate obstacle and navigated automatically. Diving depth of the fish depends on the ability of resisting pressure of the material.According to a mathematic model and simulation through a model called MATLAB, angles of waist/tail cooperative swaying are 15 degrees/20 degrees when being advance.In comparison with a boat model with the same weigh, volume and power (with propeller) in a professional institution, the simulated fish has higher push ability and higher speed.<br><br>IMAGE IN THE ORIGINAL

Fundacao Escola Tecnica Liberato Salzano Vieira da Cunha, Novo Hamburgo, RS, BRASIL

This is the study of the impregnation of nanoparticles of zirconium oxide and silver in dressings that could activate the skin blood flow, by heating the skin, and have antimicrobial action, speeding up the healing and assisting in the treatment of illnesses. Its production involved the preparation of solutions of  ZrO2 and Ag nanoparticles for impregnation in the fabric rayon, in concentrations of 10g/L and 30g/L, respectively. These nanoparticles, measured in Mastersizer, presented sizes of 448 nanometers (ZrO2) and 119 nanometers (Ag). The test of Franz cell was made during 3h to inquire if nanoparticles would penetrate the skin, which could be dangerous, and the result was that it does not offer risks. Tests of MEV and EDS indicate adequate distribution of nanoparticles in the fabric. The dressing was sent to an industrial testing site, where the test of antimicrobial action was made, whose result indicate that it had total bacterial inhibition (Staphylococcus aureus) and partial (40%) fungal (Aspergillus niger). The test of the cutaneous heating was evaluated with termographic chamber, heating a bar of aluminum and depositing the dressing and the rayon, being the temperature controlled for 12min.

DEVELOPING A URINE TEST FOR TULAREMIA THROUGH THE USE OF CIBACRON BLUE-CORE SHELL NANOPARTICLES TO SEQUESTER THE BACTERIAL ANTIGEN TUL4
Rithvik Raju Prasannappa, Sameer Singh, 
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Alexandria, VA

Tularemia, commonly known as rabbit fever, is a disease caused by the bacterium Francisella tularensis. Hunters, landscapers, and farmers are at risk to get tularemia in the US, Northern Europe, and Russia. Historically, this disease is known as a potent biological weapon, as it is highly infectious when inhaled and because mortality rates are extremely high in untreated patients. However, methods to diagnose the disease are extremely inefficient and accompanied by many safety hazards. Here we propose new, non-invasive diagnostic method that reduces the time necessary significantly while eliminating any safety risks. We propose to use Cibacron blue-core shell nanoparticles as the technological platform for a new method of diagnosing Tularemia from a urine sample. Previous research has shown that antigens released by Francisella are present in the urine sample of an infected patient. To test our hypothesis, the nanoparticles (which isolate small proteins from the sample) were incubated in a synthetic urine with the Tul4(17kd), a highly immunogenic antigen released by Francisella. Proteins bound to the nanoparticle beads were then separated by SDS-Gel electrophoresis, and examined by a western blot, verifying that proteins bound to the particle included the Tul4 protein. From this experiment, we were able to conclude that using nanoparticles to sequester the Tul4 antigen from a urine sample is a viable alternative method of diagnosing Tularemia. This new procedure bypasses any previous risks involved in the handling of Francisella bacteria, shortens the time of diagnosis to two hours, and eliminates the risk of false positives.

DESIGNING AND CHARACTERIZING ZINC OXIDE NANOTUBE BASED HYBRID SOLAR CELL
Enes Guney, Ahmet Rasit Yildirim, 
Private Beyliduzu Fatih Science High School, Istanbul, Marmara, TURKEY

Today, fossil fuels are not renewable energy resources. Fossil fuels are quite harmful to the environment. Therefore, people in the world have started to use renewable energy resources. What inspired us in this study is the sea sponge (Tethya aurantia). Sea sponge obtains the silicic acid from the water a few hundred meters deep. This acid is transformed to silicium dioxide or silica with a mechanism where chemical energy is used with high efficiency and where silicatein enzyme functions as a catalyst and it obtains three-dimensional structures. The most important application field of this technique will be photovoltaic solar cells that can work more effectively. Present solar cells are produced in high temperatures that necessitate more energy and in low pressure. In the process that takes place in the sea sponge with high energy efficiency, there is no need for intensive energy. It will be possible to produce simple and cheap solar cells by imitating the mechanism in the sea sponge and by using zinc oxide instead of silicium. <br><br> First, ITO was cleaned. Then ZnO nanotubes were placed on it. Then the P3MeT thin film was coated electrochemically. Finally, it was coated thermally by Al. Then the characterization of the produced cells was carried out. The cell efficiency and cell parameters were determined. As a result, it was observed that zinc oxide nanotubes increased the efficiency of the cells about fifty per cent.

School named after Academician Zarifa Aliyeva, Baku, AZERBAIJAN

Development, investigation and application of nanotechnologies in oil and gas industry not destroying ecological balance and providing enhancement of efficiency of production and drilling is of a great importance worldwide.<br><br>With the aim of development of nanotechnologies for enhancement of efficiency of exploitation of strongly exhausted and watered oil fields we put new tasks to investigate a number of performance characteristics of these fields and development of nanotechnologies on the base of new compositions.<br><br>In the project we give systematic summary of principally new methods of improvement of main rheological parameters of extracted fluids using nanotechnologies and suggested mathematical model - “effect of supersmall concentrations at supersmall sizes”.<br><br>Experimental investigations of “NANO-SAS” (SAS – surface active substance) conducted earlier showed that at fixed sized of nanoparticles a dependence of surface tension () of a solution on concentration is convex downwards (concave) function having characteristic minimum point in various compositions of nanoparticle solutions in the area of ultra-small concentrations that is explained by the “effect of small concentrations”. Earlier theses investigations have been conducted for nanoparticles having sizes 100-160 and 40-60 nm. The results of present investigations carried out in the frame of this project showed that minimum of  value decreases more with decreasing the sizes of nanoparticles to 20-40, 10-20, 5-10 and 1-5 nm. So we discovered experimentally double (synergetic) effect “supersmall concentrations + supersmall sizes” of nanoparticles in “NANO-SAS” system. <br><br>The results of the investigations allow cutting costs of expensive chemical reagents at oil and gas fields developments.<br><br>

AIR QUALITY PROMOTION: THE USE OF THE ZNO/U.V PHOTOCATALYTIC SYSTEM IN THE ANALYSIS AND CONTROL OF MICROBIAL PATHOGENS PRESENT IN CONTAMINATED INDOOR ENVIRONMENTS
Gabriel Nascimento da Silva Santos, Paulo Ricardo Maciel Nascimento, 
Escola Santa Teresinha, Imperatriz, MA, BRASIL

The impact of the indoor air quality on human health and well-being of people who attend artificially acclimatized environments has been a significant subject at the Public Health area since 1970. Several factors like level of air humidity, temperature and maintenance of conditioners can favor to a considerable rise in the concentrations of chemical and biological pollutants in the air. This is a problem that concerns world science, because it's increase brings harmful threats to human health. Thus, we achieve promotion of air quality in closed acclimatized environments reducing the concentrations of main biocontaminants (bacteria and fungi) in those places through construction of photocatalytic system ZnO/U.V, providing a better conditions to growing occupants from these environments. For this, we immobilized a suspension containing ZnO on the intern surface of the clilindric fotorreactor of glass and then, then introduced an ultra violet lamp in the center of the reactor. We cataloged 25 acclimatized places and collected microbial samples (before the reactor's application) to check the contamination levels. When the contaminated air was forced to pass for the photocatalytic reactor, we found a significant inactivation of the pathogens, with 97,8% of reduction to bacteria and 96,8% to fungi on average. The results obtained, showed the analyzed places were biologically contaminated and that 92% of the occupants from these environments had their health affected by that contamination, as demonstrated the qualitative questionnaires applied to this population. All these experiments prove the possibility to use the ZnO/U.V system to analyze and control the excessive proliferation of microbial presents in the air from closed places.

MP3 PLAYERS AND NOISE-INDUCED HEARING LOSS
James Dawson-Smith, Marcus Littlewood
Scotch College, Hawthorn, Victoria, Australia

Could MP3 players harm your hearing? Are Australians using MP3 players at levels that are too loud for too long? The aim of this study was to determine if boys in Scotch College and people in the wider community are using MP3 players (iPods and i-Rivers) in a way that could damage their hearing. A survey of 263 people investigated the average daily volumes people used with their MP3 players. It also asked questions about tinnitus, MP3 player usage and awareness of risk of hearing loss with MP3 player usage. In laboratory experiments, the dBA levels that corresponded to the average daily volume levels used were measured. Using the information from the survey about daily hours of use, the dBA levels were converted into equivalent 8-hour dBA levels. This allowed a comparison to the Occupational Health and Safety acceptable noise exposure limit. Results showed that 52% of those surveyed used their MP3 players "unsafely". On average males were using higher equivalent 8-hour dBA levels than females. "Unsafe" MP3 users reported having tinnitus more often than "safe" MP3 users. The majority of people were aware of a risk of hearing loss through MP3 player usage. However, just over half were not worried about it.

A STUDY ON IMPROVING EFFICIENCIES OF PULSED ELECTRO-MAGNETIC LINEAR ACCELERATORS
Woo_Han Ong, Gao Guangyan
Raffles Institution, Singapore, Singapore

A study examining how efficiencies can be improved in pulsed electromagnetic linear accelerators whereby a coil is used to create a magnetic field was done experimentally by modifying and testing out a self-constructed working model, which was powered by a 7200 micro-Farad 450V capacitor bank charged to 100V; switched by a SKT160/120C Thyristor; accelerating a 38mm long, 15g cylindrical steel projectile. The optimum placement of the projectile was first found, before methods of improving efficiencies such as reducing eddy currents and guiding of magnetic flux were introduced. It was hypothesized that eddy currents could be reduced through the slotting of the barrel and the projectile and that the magnetic flux could be guided by the wrapping of iron laminations around the solenoid. The result was a 38.98% gain in efficiency. The results of these experiments are useful in applications whereby an electromagnetic accelerator can be used, which possibly includes advanced space propulsion, hypervelocity impact simulations and for defense.

USING STOICHIOMETRIC CALCULATIONS TO ANALYZE THEORETICAL YIELDS OF ROCKET PROPELLANT
Ethan Allan Steward, Joshua Clemens, 
Northwestern School, Mellette, SD

The engineering goal of this project was to establish, by the use of stoichiometric calculations, the optimum ratio of oxidizer to fuel in KNO3/C12H22O11 rocket propellant. Using stoichiometry, we found that a ratio of 87% KNO3 to 13% C12H22O11 should yield, theoretically, complete combustion of the propellant. We also tested several other combinations of the fuel and oxidizer. Several methods were implemented to test these theories with varying success.<br><br>Our initial idea was to test the thrust of rocket engines with the different fuel compositions. First, we built an engine casing from PVC and a nozzle from pressure hardening rocket nozzle mix. Upon testing, we discovered that the PVC melted because of the extreme heat produced by the burning propellant. Consequently, we abandoned PVC and switched to a stronger material. Steel engine casings worked well during further testing. The digital scale used to measure engine thrust, however, failed. We decided to use a more straightforward and accurate mode of testing after these setbacks.<br><br>To achieve the best possible mixture of the propellant components, we dissolved them in water. The water was then driven off, and the propellant ground to a fine powder and dehydrated. Then it was tested for efficiency by burning it in a fume hood and finding the mass of the remaining propellant. <br><br>Through extensive testing, we found that the optimal ratio for this propellant is 65% to 35%. Therefore, we have proven that stoichiometric ratios do not always result in the best and most useful reactions.

VALIDATING THE SMARTBANDAGE: COMPUTER MODELING THE DIAGNOSTIC POTENTIAL OF AN OXYGEN-SENSING NANOPARTICLE-EMBEDDED POLYMER
Charlotte Nina Keeley, Emily Jane Keeley, 
Charlottesville High School, Charlottesville, VA

After embedding oxygen-sensitive nanoparticles in thin film polymers, the resulting problem approached in this experiment was how to measure the SmartBandage’s response to oxygen in a wound bed. As there is limited imaging technology to assess nanoparticle fluorescence in tissue, a computer model was developed. The behaviors of fibroblasts, monocytes, and endothelial cells were programmed with varied numbers of capillaries and wound depths. A simulated SmartBandage depicted the diffusion of oxygen throughout the wound by fluorescing.<br><br> A two-way analysis of variance proved that wound depth did not significantly impact the percentage of the wound that healed and that proximity to and number of capillaries in a wound bed are more important to healing. These results verified the validity of the model in relation to an actual wound. <br><br> One-centimeter-diameter wounds were made on the dorsums of two mice by a qualified scientist. BF2dbmPLA nanoparticles were dripped onto one of the wounds and the fluorescent reaction was measured. The trials on mice confirmed the efficacy of the oxygen-sensitive nanoparticles and proved that the nanoparticles do not significantly impact the process of wound healing. Healing time in vivo was comparable to healing time demonstrated by the computer model.<br><br> The potential of the SmartBandage as an oxygen-sensitive diagnostic tool was confirmed with both in silico and in vivo testing. The results achieved dictate future research and validate that the SmartBandage targets the most important factor in wound healing and could serve as a diagnostic tool that not only detects, but also differentiates oxygen levels.<br><br>

SWITCHABLE INFRARED-REFLECTING GREEN WINDOW
I-Hui Lee, Yu-Ching,Chao, 
Taipei Municiple LiShan High School, Taipei City, Taiwan(R.O.C), CHINESE TAIPEI

In this project, a switchable window based on Cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) is fabricated to balance the quality of life and global trend of energy conservation.<br><br>CLC is a mixture of nematic liquid crystal and chiral material, possessing the characteristic of selective reflection in a specific spectral range. By adjusting the concentration of chiral material in CLC, the spectral range of reflection can be shifted to the infrared while maintaining high transparency in the visible. Apart from the spectral range of reflection, the CLC also exhibits bistable states, the first transparent state (selectively reflects a spectral range), the scattering state (rejects all spectral range), and the second transparent state (allows all spectral range) sequentially upon appropriate bias.<br><br>We found the following mixtures present to be the best two working CLCs. The mixture of 20% S811 and 80% E7 reflects infrared from 700 nm to 900 nm with high transparency in the visible. The mixture of 30% S811 and 70% E7 reflects infrared from 1200 nm to 1500 nm. Under increasing bias, the CLCs can (1) reflect up to 70% of infrared with a maximum of 80% transparency, reducing the air conditioning need in summer, (2) reject 70% to 75% of infrared and visible light simultaneously, serving as a blinder to improve the functional performance of the room, (3) reflect only 40% of infrared and visible light, reducing the heating requirement in winter, (4) control transmission efficiency of sunlight so as to effect the daylight illumination in a room.

THE RATE OF LEAD (II) HYDROXIDE DEPOSITION IN A CONCRETE WATER HOLDING TANK: AN INVESTIGATION OF WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS IN THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES
Shamoon Syed Rizvi, Shujat Khan
East Meadow High School, East Meadow, NY

Concrete has been utilized in aqueous applications, but there has been no analysis performed to test the possible effect that they may have on the water. Concrete contains heavy ions such as Lead (II) Hydroxide, Pb(OH)2, which disassociates into lead and hydroxide. A statistical investigation was performed which revealed that there is a direct correlation with an R-value of .7893 between the number of third world countries that have implemented concrete irrigation and the number of annual lead intoxication cases. To test the presence of Lead (II) Hydroxide in the concrete and its readiness to excrete into the solution, water was held in smaller scaled tanks to simulate those used in third world countries over a 30-day period and the concentration of the lead ion was measured each day. The average rate of secretion was calculated by using the derivative of the logarithmic function gained from the data set. An overall increase of 2.55 ug/L of lead present inside the water was seen with an R-value of .9268. The EPA suggests that water is contaminated when the lead concentration exceeds 10 PPB; a condition achieved by day 28. If extrapolated, the lead concentration is theorized to reach an alarming 15 PPB by day 72 if held idle. It was theorized that a thermo-setting polyurethane film may decrease the amount of deposition if applied to the surface of the tank. Over a 10-day period, the data showed that there was a 61.3% decrease in the deposition of Lead (II) Hydroxide.

MAGNETIC FE3O4 NANOPARTICLES AND THERMOREVERSIBLE PLURONIC® F127 FOR LOCALIZED HYPERTHERMIA AND SUSTAINED ANTI-CANCER DRUG DELIVERY, YEAR TWO
Michelle Chencheu Liu, Sarah Wang, 
duPont Manual High School, Louisville, KY

This research aims to develop a novel, localized cancer treatment that is both multi-functional and minimally invasive. Previously, the theoretical treatment design was established to involve an injectable complex composed of magnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) and thermoreversible Pluronic F127 (PF127) for combined low-heat hyperthermia and sustained drug delivery. Further studies were conducted to (1) characterize sustained drug release from PF127 using Doxorubicin (DOX) as a model drug, and (2) analyze IONP heating in a tissue model. DOX release from PF127 was observed in an agar (2% w/w) model over a five-day period. PF127 was found to release DOX at a slower rate than water. A repeated-measure ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey test revealed that at the 0.05 significance level, DOX remaining in PF127 was significantly greater than in water, and there was an increasing trend of difference between group means over time. A growth curve model also determined that DOX in water decreased 20.49% faster per hour than that in PF127 . A tissue model study was conducted to analyze IONP heating in tissue. According to a one-way ANOVA, heating of various IONP concentrations were significantly different without tissue. However, a repeated measure ANOVA and growth curve model showed that heating of various IONP concentrations were no longer significantly different in tissue, indicating that tissue restricted IONP heating. Though IONP concentration could be increased to overcome this behavior, high levels of IONPs can be toxic to the body; therefore, other parameters such as AEM field power should be optimized.

WATER POLLUTION REDUCTION USING AN ALTERNATIVE TEXTILE FIBER SOFTENER
Alannah Siqueira Guerrero, Isabel Cristina Brito de Albuquerque, Tayla Cardoso Perfeito
Escola Tecnica Estadual Getulio Vargas, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP

The active principle of fabric softeners belongs to the class of quaternary ammonium salts, which, as the name says, present nitrogen amoniacal in their composition. This component causes the formation of light foams and is used in metabolizing of sub-aquatic seaweeds, which in excessive presence of this nitrogen, starts to grow in an uncontrolled way, covering the surface of water and making photosynthesis impossible in the depths, phenomenon known as eutrofization, which is one of the main forms of aquatic pollution in our country. <br><br> The goal of this research is to develop an alternative to industrial textile fiber softeners that will be less aggressive to aquatic environment. Initially bibliographical surveys were conducted to understand all stages of the process of cloths washing and softening in domestic environment. During these surveys the answer to initial inquiry was obtained: soap is an anionionic tensoative, in other words, when in aqueous solution it releases a cation (generally cation sodium) and its apolar part acquires negative character, negative loads that remain in the cloth even after it´s dried, causing repulsion of fibers and their consequent interlacement. Fabric softener is a cationic tensoative, thus, when in aqueous solution it releases an anion (generally chlorinate anion) acquiring this way positive character; and when in touch with negatively loaded fabric it's able to neutralize it, making it soft. In order to reduce environmental impact, a simple electrode of copper was used, which is able to “pick up electrons” from the already used fabric softener, reactivating it so that it can be re-used. In addition we have produced a basis for softeners different from the one generally used in industry, since it is composed of only four grammes of ammonium quaternary (for each hundred millilitres of basis) and it is animal fat free, being therefore less pollutant.

STAND STILL! HOW TO REDUCE OSCILLATION IN BUILDINGS
Noel Amado Vera-Gonzalez, Javier F. Morales-Gonzalez, 
Colegio San Ignacio de Loyola, San Juan, PUERTO RICO

The objective of this investigation was to determine which type of damper, either a tuned liquid column damper (“TLCD”) or a tuned mass damper (“TMD”), is more effective in reducing oscillation in a building. For such purpose, a shaker table and a building frame were designed and built. Applying a constant back-and-forth movement to the shaker table for a fixed period of time (15 seconds), (i) a TLCD filled with liquids having different viscosities, and (ii) a TMD using different masses, were placed in different locations of the building model. To record the data, the average displacement of the oscillating system was first determined without a damper, and then under each different scenario following the same procedure.<br><br> <br><br>According to the data obtained, the performance of the TLCD consistently improved when filled with the liquid with the highest viscosity and when placed in a higher floor of the building. The lowest average displacement of 10.0552cm was recorded with the chocolate syrup, the liquid with the highest viscosity. A calibrated TMD, in terms of mass and location within the building’s structure, can be more effective in counteracting the oscillating motion of the building than the TLCD. Nevertheless, the mistuning or off-optimum damping significantly reduced the effectiveness of TMD. The TLCD produced constant results with most of the liquids, making it a more effective damper on average. The TLCD resulted more effective than the TMD due to the inherent properties of the liquid which allow the damper to synchronize with the building’s oscillating movement.

THE REDUCTION OF RADIATION EXPOSURE THROUGH ALTERNATIVE CARBON-POLYMER SHIELD SYSTEMS
Talysa Renae Stockert, Leah Hoblit, 
Greybull High School, Greybull, WY

Radiation is energy given off in the form of waves or small particles of matter. It is found in many forms throughout the universe. Radiation is used for valuable medical technology, science, communications, industries, military operations, and many other important uses. Because radiation is used in many ways, people are exposed on a daily basis. Exposure to high levels of radiation can cause lasting injuries or even death. Thus, it is important that we are protected from these harmful rays.<br><br> Experimentation was designed to find a lightweight and effective material that would block radiation. It was hypothesized that the presence of carbon in the matrices would decrease the radiation counts. Carbon was chosen because carbon rods are used in nuclear reactors to help control decay rates. Two polymer shield systems, polystyrene and polyurethane were used in the research. Various percentages of carbon were added to each matrix. Each sample was cut into ½ inch thick pieces for testing. Using a counter and a Cs-137 source of beta/gamma radiation, the material was tested and results were recorded. Further analysis included testing pieces of standard blocking substances to compare the effectiveness of the polystyrene and polyurethane. Background radiation was used to determine the standard deviation of each test.<br><br> After all data was recorded, comparisons were made between the two shield systems. Polystyrene matrices generally showed a reduction in beta emission exposure of 68% compared to a reduction by the polyurethane of 55%. The addition of carbon improved the blocking in polyurethane, but had marginal affects on polystyrene. Density of the matrices seemed to have the largest impact on results. Comparisons also noted that the polystyrene material was more effective at blocking radiation than standard blocking materials currently in use. This could make polystyrene shield systems a preferable alternative to more expensive and heavier technologies now applied to nuclear reactor facilities.

ECOLOGICAL BLOCKS WITH PRESSURE WITHOUT BAKING
Martin Uranga Vega, Delfina Frolik
Colegio San Ignacio, Tandil, ARGENTINA

Due to the potential environmental pollution by agro-industrial activities (feedlots and quarries) it was decided to characterize their effluents and assess the pontential impacts of each.<br><br>There is bibliographic evidence on the problem that arises because “wastes from feedlot and quarries, exposed to the enviroment can contaminate it”<br><br>From the information obtained it was decided to develop a non-contaminating product mitigating the effects of feedlot and quarries wastes. This product is a construction block made by implementing a pressure system, thus avoiding the use of fossil fuels.<br><br>The objective was to develop a block by compression using both components, and then analyze their physical and microbiological characteristics, beginning from the hypothesis:<br><br>It is posible to make a high quality non-contaminating block from feedlots and quarryng of mineral exploitation, by using a pressure system with no high baking temperature required.<br><br>In this way, it was made a non-contaminating block that carry out the necessary characteristics to consider as a construction block, getting higher quality and mechanical resistence than a common block, reducing the enviromental impact caused by the original components. The use of feedlot feces (composted along one year) was economically profitable, and also increases the quality of the medium. It is important to highlight that this block offers some facilities for the construction, because is not necessary the use of portland or perform a plaster, as binding mode, due to the quality of their terminations. This green block has a very low density compared to common ones.

PREPARATION OF HYALURONIC ACID NANOPARTICLES WITH A. CHICA FOR APPLICATIONS IN WOUND HEALING
Lorraine da Silva Campos, Vanessa Estefano Uriza, 
Escola Americana de Campinas, Campinas, Sao Paulo, BRASIL

Nowadays, nanotechnology is a valuable tool to deliver drugs site-specifically. The objective of the research is the preparation and characterization of Hyaluronic Acid (HA) nanoparticles with and without the Arrabidea chica (A. chica) extract for wound healing applications. The investigation focuses on the role that different flow rates, masses and organic solvents have on the polydispersity, mean diameter and charge (zeta potential) of the empty HA nanoparticles as well as the drug release and elasticity of the particles with the A. chica extract. If the HA particles have a nanometric size (increased surface area) and a narrow polydispersity, then they will enhance the wound healing processes because the interaction with the skin layers is more efficient, thus promoting the gradual release of the A. chica, triggering the immune system response to the injury. The optimal numbers derived from the HA nanoparticles in the control group were reproduced in the following experiments containing A. chica. Finally, the HA nanoparticles with the extract were tested for the gradual delivery of the compound, derived from measurements in the spectrophotometer, deformation capacity (elasticity), measured with an extruder and for its effects on the chorion membrane of an egg with respect to angiogenesis. Thus, stable HA nanoparticles were formed by nanoprecipitation and cross linking by ADH, mediated by EDCl. The incorporation of the vegetal extract in the HA nanoparticles was possible. Therefore, based on these statements, the postulated hypothesis must be accepted; size, polydispersity, zeta potential, drug delivery and elasticity are all relevant for the correct activity of the particles produced in relation to healing of skin lesions and promotion of tissue regeneration.

DECOLORIZATION AND FREE FATTY ACID EXTRACTION OF WASTE COOKING OIL BY ADSORPTION, PERCOLATION, AND GAS STRIPPING
Widya Adidharma, Lingga Adidharma, 
Laramie Senior High School, Laramie, WY

Waste cooking oil disposal is problematic and hazardous to the environment. The purpose of this project is to propose a method to refine this problematic waste cooking oil by exploring which separation technique (bentonite adsorption, silica gel and sandstone percolation, or carbon dioxide stripping) is most effective for free fatty acid (FFA) extraction and oil decolorization. We also investigated the effects of CO2 stripping parameters and the amount of solid separating agent on the separation performance.<br><br> Procedures for each technique were developed. For CO2 stripping, CO2 was bubbled through oil in a three-necked flask under vacuum. For percolation, oil was filtered through a solid agent in a burette. For adsorption, bentonite and oil were mixed before being filtered through a fritted tube. To determine the performance of these separation techniques, the decolorization of the oil was noted and the FFA content of the oil was determined by titration.<br><br> The experimental results show that bentonite adsorption was most effective in oil decolorization. Surprisingly, bentonite was also most effective in FFA extraction, decreasing the FFA content of oil by 87.234%. We found that the more the solid agent used, the more FFA was extracted. The percolation and CO2 stripping also decreased the FFA content, but by smaller percentages. Furthermore, only two of the CO2 stripping parameters significantly affected the FFA extraction. <br><br> Due to the promising results of this preliminary study, we believe that our research will lead to the development of an effective and environmentally benign method of refining waste cooking oil.

MULTI-LAYERED OPTICAL DATA STORAGE SYSTEM
Rodrigo Luger, Giuliano Sider
Escola Americana de Campinas, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil

The objective of this experiment was to design and construct a working model of an experimental and novel method for a data storage cell in computers. Classical data storage mediums can be eventually broken up in their fundamental components to form individual cells containing only two possible data values. This project strove to make a model of a new data storage system that is not limited to a short range of binary values in each of its data storage cells. The data storage cell designed and constructed in the project uses a disc with areas of differing opacity and shines a beam of infrared light across the disc to obtain a subsequent voltage reading that represents the “information” stored in the disc. The information is simply stored in the form of the level of opacity of each orifice in the disc, which was recorded with semi-transparent cellophane paper. This data cell is composed of multi-layered stacks of cellophane in each orifice in the disc; each orifice has a specific opacity, and a different data value is stored in it.<br><br>Before the project’s original objectives were close enough to completion, many tentative models and implementations of this data storage system were designed and built. The final model displayed the disc’s information in the screen of an oscilloscope in the form of voltage values. This final model was effective in meeting the most rudimentary design aspects and the conceptual propositions conceived in this project for a next generation data storage system for computers.<br><br>

SWITCHGRASS: A SOURCE OF BIOFUELS AND VALUE-ADDED BYPRODUCTS
Mallory Ruth Busso, Lauren Raycraft, 
Kalamazoo Area Mathematics and Science Center, Kalamazoo, MI

A research team examined the chemical properties of Panicum virgatum L. for its use as a biofuel as well as the use of its biorefinery byproducts. Following the 2009 harvest, a sample of Panicum virgatum L., more commonly known as Switchgrass, was obtained. The fibers underwent several treatments, such as sodium carbonate impregnation, autohydrolysis, and Kraft pulping. Following the treatments, samples were subjected to a four step bleaching process including hypochlorite bleaching, peroxide extraction, oxygen extraction, and a second peroxide extraction. Selected samples then underwent ultrasonic treatment as a possible means of breaking apart the amorphous regions of the crystals. Next, samples underwent enzymatic hydrolysis with Cellulase. Nanocrystals were analyzed from the enzymatic hydrolysis. Black liquors and waste produced from the treatments were used to extract biofuels and byproducts such as ash, lignin, biosilica, fibers, distillate, xylose, and nanocrystalline cellulose that can be used in various industries. Results were analyzed by comparing results to that of softwoods, hardwoods, and wheat straw in similar testing as well as to industry standards. The Switchgrass produces minimal waste in the biorefinery process through its value-added byproducts.

Conventionally pedal wheel and flywheel have teeth on them, which holds the chain in place. This chain transfers the energy to the flywheel in fragments or in the form of small packets of mechanical energy. Thus, this chain caused a lot of problems.When the chain is replaced by a shaft which drives the bicycle, it becomes a lot easier in riding the modified bicycle because chain, which caused a lot of trouble, is completely eliminated .So we came up with the idea of replacing the chain with the shaft.The ratio between the front and the rear gear was 1:3. This means that the front gear had exactly 3 times the no of teeth as the no. of teeth the flywheel has. Also when the pedal wheel makes one revolution then the rear wheel will make 3 complete revolutions. Now the shaft was mounted on ball bearings that helped to overcome the frictional force. This shaft was connected to both sides with the help of pinions.. Now when the pedal rotates, the bevel gear makes the pinion rotate which, in turn rotates the shaft at right angles with the pedal wheel. Now the pinion at the other side of the shaft made the gear on the flywheel rotate which ultimately made the cycle move.The final outcome was that our cycle showed better performance than ordinary bicycles.At last all this explains that the conventional chains can be replaced with a shaft. The shaft is connected to the bevel gears with the help of pinions. This pinion rotates with the Gears at right angles to each otherAll this now leads to only one conclusion that this shaft is the only substitute to the chains. It is durable, No lubrication required, sleek and compact, reliable and energy saving. <br><br>So shift to Shaft

An anti-termite material from natural resources has been investigated. The investigation is focused on the soursop leaves extract since the soursop tree is widely planted in our local village. The anti-termite material was made from the powder of soursop leaves soaked with methanol. The termite resistant compound has been in particular applied to the papers made from rice straw pulp. The effectiveness of soursop extract leaves as a natural preservative for rice straw paper has been investigated by observing its physical characteristics (tensile strength, frictional resistance) and also termite resistance test. The data was collected from rice straw papers with soursop leaves extract, with regular water and without anything. It is argued that the soursop leaves extract might be appropriate to realize paper from rice straw that is non-toxic, environmental friendly and low cost, but with good enough quality.

This project is about silanol synthesis which can be useful for making silicon materials, by observing the fact that if nanocomplex contains Fe, those particles are re-collectable by utilizing its magnetism. Almost oxidation's method were underwent with powerful oxidizer, but those methods include toxic by-products and low yield. Recently, there are some researches about silane oxidation with Au nanoparticles. Most of those cases have disadvantages of slow reaction velocity and inconvenient reuse.<br><br>So as we synthesized the catalyst Fe nanoparticles with nailed Au nanoparticles, we can get these have high reactivity on silane-oxidation, and also nanocomplexes of Fe nanoparticles are available for collect and reuse by applying Fe's magnetism.<br><br>Fe nanoparticles hardly acted as a catalyst, but Au/Fe oxide nanoparticles' catalytic function is remarkably excellent, whose Au nanoparticle acts as functional group.<br><br>Synthesis of Metallic Nanocomplex that containing Fe does not use existing method of Au/Fe oxide Nanocomplex synthesis method. This synthesis need low cost and simple process mechanism. Also, Nanocomplex we synthesized showed high yield as a catalyst of silane-oxidation.

A unique volcanic mudflow breaker dam has been designed and prototyped. The design is a significant modification of the conventional one with two main purposes. First is to reduce the speed and bulk mass of volcanic mudflow flowing along the river, and secondly is to improve the safety of traditional sand and rock miners while at the same time it increases the amount of mined materials. The project was conducted through direct observation, literature studies, simulation and prototyping. The observation was focused on the Gendol river at Yogyakarta which was attacked by terrible mudflow from last year Merapi Mt.'s eruption. The design and prototyping are based on the mechanical physics. The simulation has been performed using mini replica at the lab scale flume facility. It is argued that the design works well to slow down the speed and to break the concentration of mudflow as its main conventional function. Additionally it benefits the local sand / rock miners, in which their activities at the same time contribute to reducing the amount of mudflow deposits and its future dangers along the river.

STOPPING POWER!: THE USE OF NON-NEWTONIAN FLUID AND RECYCLED PAPER AND PLASTIC TO STOP A PROJECTILE AND POSSIBLY BE USED IN A BULLET PROOF VEST, PHASE IV
Alec Joseph Lamirande, Preston Jackson, 
Cloquet Senior High School, Cloquet, MN

Non-Newtonian fluids are a liquid and a solid at the same time (Pike, 2008). The question is what non-Newtonian mixture of cornstarch, and recycled plastic/paper creates the greatest force reduction? The hypothesis is that non-Newtonian fluid and a mixture of recycled newspaper and plastic will reduce force over either recycled mixture alone. The force reduction for each of the four concentrations (1.25, 1.5, 1.75 and 2.0 ml/ml) of cornstarch and water alone were tested. For each of these four concentrations, two concentrations of recycled paper fiber [5 and 10 grams (g) per corn starch mixture] and recycled plastic (20 and 70 g) were used. Next, using the optimum concentrations of each, two concentrations of non-Newtonian fluid mixed with water (1.5 and 1.75 ml/ml) were each mixed with varying combinations of a blend of recycled newspaper/plastic (2.5/10, 5/20, 7.5/30 g/g). Each mixture was poured into a zipper bag and placed on a force meter; a 450 g steel ball was dropped from 40 centimeters, and measured in Newton’s. The hypothesis was supported, mixtures of paper/plastic significantly reduced force over corn starch alone, and when corn starch was individually mixed with recycled paper and/or plastic, but not for all concentrations. The concentration of 1.75 ml/ml of corn starch and water when added to a mixture of 7.5/30 (g/g) of plastic/paper, significantly reduced force over all other concentrations and mixtures, p< .001. Environmentalists and engineers will benefit from knowing that mixtures of recycled paper/plastic in a non-Newtonian fluid are a sustainable viable alternative.

ENHANCED COOLING OF MICROELECTRONIC DEVICES BY USING THE THERMOACOUSTIC EFFECT
Pen-Yuan Hsing, Wei-Kang Huang
Taipei Municipal Lishan Senior High School, Taipei, Taiwan R.O.C.

In this project, the characteristics of the thermoacoustic engine were first studied using the "Acoustic Laser" concept. A passive thermoacoustically enhanced convection engine capable of improving the cooling effect of microelectronic devices was then proposed. This design has the advantage that no additional energy input is required, a contrast to the usage of mini-fans in today's computers. A testbed combining a heated NiCr wire with a glass tube was used to examine the overall cooling effect. In order to evaluate its performance, we measured the following parameters: radiation, convection, conduction, and acoustic radiation. We found that the heat caused by today's microelectronic devices is sufficiently high to trigger the thermoacoustic effect. Based on this finding, we designed a new configuration to utilize this thermoacoustically enhanced convection to significantly lower the temperature. Our approach has a potential application to tackle the heat problems caused by the rapidly advancing microelectronic devices.

DYE SENSITIZED SOLAR CELL: A COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT DYES
Abraham Galindo, Yunfei Liu, 
Americas High School, El Paso, TX

The purpose of this project is to see if a dye sensitized solar cell, that mimics the process of photosynthesis, can be created to generate electricity. Once the cell is created, this project will also compare different types of dyes, with it being hypothesized that the English ivy plant will create the most efficient dye. The solar cell will be created with the use of two glass slides. The top slide will be the anode, while the bottom slide will be the cathode. A nanocrystal titanium oxide solution was created by mixing titanium oxide nano crystals and a surfactant. The solution was then pasted over the anode. The layer was then dipped into the corresponding dye solution, which is created by simply crushing the dye ingredients. A layer of carbon was then added to the cathode acting as a catalyst,and both slides were then attached. An electrolyte was then used to help the cell work continuously. The voltage and current were measured with the use of a multimeter, and an ANOVA test was used to compare the different cells. A solar cell that mimics the process photosynthesis was created, and Raspberry had the highest efficiency. The English Ivy dye, however, was ineffective due to the inadequate binds between the titanium dioxide and the dye, which limits the flow of electrons. Raspberry, Blackberry, and Cranberry had a higher efficiency due to their abundance of anthocyanin. Dye sensitized solar cells are a promising energy alternative, due to their customizability, the abundance of the materials they contain, and their low cost.

TARGETED DELIVERY OF IRON OXIDE NANOPARTICLES FOR USE IN MAGNETIC HYPERTHERMIA CANCER TREATMENT
Samip Dharmendra Patel, William Hairfield
Roanoke Valley Governor's School for Science and Technology, Roanoke, VA

The focus of this project was to develop a targeted delivery system of iron oxide nanoparticles (NPs) to pancreatic cancer cells, thereby making the cells vulnerable to magnetic hyperthermia. In preliminary tests, the viability of cellular uptake of NPs was examined with the hypothesis that NPs coated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) would be taken up by the cells and would respond to a magnetic field. To synthesize NPs, ferric salts and ammonium hydroxide were mixed under a nitrogen atmosphere. BSA was diluted (1g/20mL), combined with the NPs and sonicated to conjugate BSA to the NPs. Standard culture media without any added NPs served as a control. Cells were then added to the solutions and incubated for 24 hours. Cells were harvested, reconstituted in phosphate buffered saline, and placed on petri dishes next to a neodymium magnet. Cell migration was observed and recorded using a microscope. The control cells had no response to the magnet. The cells exposed to bare NPs initially exhibited movement due to NPs clumping around the cells rather than entering them. Any cells missed by the initial movement remained static. The cells exposed to BSA conjugated NPs exhibited the most constant and most total movement. NPs were also visible inside the cells under the light microscope. Thus, the hypothesis that the BSA-coated particles would display the most effective cellular uptake was supported. In future studies, use of antibody coated NPs to target pancreatic cancer cells will be explored.

THE PORTABLE EMERGENT PIPING DEALER
Guo Yuanyuan , Zhang Xu,Xiao Xiao
No. 1 Middle School of Yuanjiang City,Hunan Province,China

It is very common in the Dongting Lake areas that the solid dike is collapsed because of ant holes in it. During flood season in every year, with the increase of the flood level,the dike body is emptied because of the piping, resulting to final collapse of the dike and breach of the polder. The diameter of the piping hole is only several centimeters at first, but enlarges very quickly. The traditional piping dealing method is to use sand and rock from other places to construct a diversion pile, which is both time- and cost-consuming. The portable emergent piping dealer invented by us can control the piping in several minutes. Its working principle is to use the holed steel pipe cap to replace the sand dike, the steel net and geo-membrane to substitute the sand and gravel layer to diverse the water and keep the sand from flowing away, to regulate the seepage regulator in accordance with the water pressure to resist the water pressure, which forms a diversion pile very quickly to control the piping at its initial status. Having been assessed by the water resources department of Hunan Province, the portable emergent piping dealer meets the real requirements of piping control and is planned to spread in the whole province. Our invention has become a magic weapon in flood fighting in the Dongting Lake areas.

NEAR-INFRARED LIGHT BIOSTIMULATION: A NOVEL APPROACH TO THE OPTIMIZATION OF INDUSTRIAL BIOSYNTHESIS
Ray Zhou, Ruchita Gupta, 
Amador Valley High School, Pleasanton, CA

Near-infrared (NIR) light biostimulation is a recently discovered cellular mechanism which describes the enhancement of cell activity via NIR irradiation. It has been applied in low level laser therapy for wound healing, tumor treatment, and other clinical purposes. In this study, we speculate the existence of a similar mechanism in industrial microorganisms, and instead its applications instead for the mass production of biopharmaceuticals. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first comprehensive study on such a speculation.<br><br>We experimentally assessed the effects of NIR LED irradiation on cellular respiration in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker’s yeast). Carbon dioxide produced as a byproduct of respiration was measured by evaluating water displacement in a partially-vacuumed container over time. Cell cultures exposed to low-power LED light reported a two-to-threefold increase in total respiration, compared to cultures cultivated in darkness. Moreover, a follow-up experiment was conducted which confirmed that this increase was not merely an effect of heating. <br><br>Through further literature survey and genome analysis, we confirmed the existence of two NIR photoacceptors in all analyzed industrial microorganisms: cytochrome c oxidase (COX) in eukaryotic species and cytochrome bd in prokaryotic species. The universality of these photoacceptors suggested that NIR light biostimulation may be applied to the mass production of a broad group of pharmaceuticals, ranging from antibiotics to recombinant bioproducts. Our study thus demonstrated that NIR light biostimulation, achieved through low-cost LED irradiation, has the potential to provide a both versatile and cost-effective approach to the optimization of industrial biosynthesis.

THE EFFECT OF SUCROSE ON THE SUSPENSION TIME OF THIGMORHEOLOGICAL FLUID AND A NEW THEORY ON THE CAUSE OF ITS RHEOLOGY
Ji Han Hyo, Seung Yun Park, Ji Yun Hyo
Tianjin International School, Tianjin, CHINA

Rheological fluids are fluids which will greatly increase their viscosity when placed under specific stimuli. Rheological fluids are often used in shock absorbing mechanisms such as dampers or bumpers. Including the thigmorheological fluid that was invented by the science fair participant last year, there are currently four different kinds of rheological fluids. They are electro-, magneto-, photo-, and thigmorheological fluids. Among these four, only one of them was able to become commercialized due to the common problem of limited suspension time. One company has succeeded in eliminating the suspension time and therefore is in monopoly of the rheological fluid industry. The research seeks to eternalize the suspension time of thigmorheological fluid. Since only in TR fluids are particles denser than the solution, addition of solute into the solution easily increased the density of the solution. After successfully eternalizing the suspension time of TR fluid, experiments were done to see how efficiently the new TR would absorb shock. The result was successful as well. The new TR fluid would absorb almost twice as much shock as the original TR fluid. More research is suggested to be done on measuring TR fluid’s shear force.

Currently, 39 million people are blind and 90% of the visually impaired live in LEDCs. The goal of this project is to design efficient, inexpensive methods and devices to assist the blind in navigation and dexterity. They will primarily rely on ultrasonic rangefinders to determine the distance between the user and obstacle. Feedback is provided through vibration motors and Piezo speakers that enable both tactile and audible warnings. Two devices, the H.A.N.D. and the Ranger, were created as a result of this project.<br><br> Tests were taken through two methods, a timed run through an obstacle course and a dexterity test where subjects locate three objects on a table. The H.AN.D. focused on dexterity first and navigation second, whereas the Ranger was solely dedicated to navigational accuracy.<br><br> For the navigation obstacle course test, it is recorded on average that subjects with the H.A.N.D. were 4.416 seconds slower than those without. As for the dexterity test, the subjects wearing the H.A.N.D. took 6.412 seconds longer than the control. Although it may imply that the H.A.N.D. does not enhance navigational capabilities, subjects were less prone to colliding into obstacles and practiced more caution. The Ranger decreased user speed by an average of 0.7125 seconds but decreased their rate of collision by 47% when compared to the rate for the control. Blind and non-blind test subjects commended the easy-to-use functionalities of the devices and their effectiveness. In conclusion, Project S.U.N. proved helpful to the test subjects in both navigation and dexterity.

ANALYSIS OF THE THERMIC CONDUCTION AND THE FORMATION OF THE CONDENSATION INSIDE A WALL
Paola Cantarelli, Alessio Gaimarri, Arianna Marelli
Liceo Scientifico "Gaspare Aselli", Cremona, ITALY

The project’s aim at the analysis of heat and water vapour density flux on the walls of a room in order to stop the development of condensate which can lead to mould growth. A square room filled only the air, without openings and surrounded by air has been considered. The room was in a state of heat-flux-equilibrium (between the inner and the outer temperature) and of water-vapour-flux-equilibrium (between the inner and the outer pressure). After having analysed relevant physical laws on conduction, diffusion and critical pressure, a mathematical model of the room was built and transferred on the electronic sheet. It was composed of our parts: temperature; pressures; critical pressures; comparison sheet with the comparison between pressure and critical pressure in order to find where condensation will develop. In a wall made of bricks, condensation in the corners (with further possibility of moult growth); a layer of thermal insulator was inserted into the walls, placed in different positions. The best solutions was proved to put cork outside the brick-wall: in fact, its central and inner position didn’t stop the phenomenon of condensation. The most useful features of the work are: the opportunity to modify easily the values of the parameters connected to inner and outer temperatures and pressures; the possibility to compare in a relatively short time different solutions and to choose the best one.

MYINSUL.IN: DECISION SUPPORT FOR INPATIENT PHYSICIANS MANAGING HYPERGLYCEMIA
Annelise Cummings, Alexander Eskil Harding, 
Cleveland High School, Portland, OR

Problem: Inpatient physicians need a quick, reliable, and accurate tool to navigate complex guidelines for managing hyperglycemia.<br><br>Solution: We created a HIPPA-exempt web application called MyInsul.in. Our tool provides physicians with immediate access to standard clinical insulin dose guidelines related to patient's mass, BMI, disease state, and drug use. <br><br>Objectives: Engineer, revise, and validate the use and effectiveness of our tool. <br><br>Methods: MyInsul.in is available in mobile and full-sized versions for initiating and managing basal-bolus regimens in accordance with guidelines provided by the teaching hospital. Physicians were encouraged to actively use MyInsul.in starting December 1st. Data was aligned with stakeholders: web analytics (engineers), perceptions (physicians), glycemic compliance (hospital quality committee), and case studies (patients). <br><br>Results: Web analytic data confirms that our tool was used, but less than would be expected given the number of patients on the ward. Physicians attributed fewer barriers to management of hyperglycemia after the introduction of our tool. The overall unit’s glycemic control was not significantly different from historical data. The case studies suggest that physicians who used MyInsul.in had patients with better control than physicians who relied on sliding scale. <br><br>Conclusion: MyInsul.in was effective in reducing barriers to managing hyperglycemia when used. MyInsul.in improved residents’ knowledge about hyperglycemia, and initiated discussion about clinically relevant quality measures to assess glycemic compliance. However, MyInsul.in is in the early stages of adoption suggesting that further intervention and education is necessary to improve hospital glycemic control.

ULTRA-SENSITIVE DNA DETECTION BY EGFET USING GAN NANOWIRES GATE
Ching-Ying Lu, Ting-Yu Chen, 
Taipei Municipal First Girls' Senior High School, Taipei, CHINESE TAIPEI

DNA-hybridization based detection techniques are widely developed due to their promising applications in genetics, medicine and drug discovery. However, current DNA detection techniques based on labels or reagents are time-consuming, environmentally-harmful and complex to implement. In this study, we have successfully demonstrated a label-free extended-gate-field-effect-transistor (EGFET) sensor utilizing a GaN-nanowires electrode with DNA probes immobilized, capable of specific DNA sequence identification. The principle behind the design is based on the change in surface potential and charge transfer after hybridization. GaN nanowires, being bio-compatible, provide direct transfer path and high surface area, thus offer an unprecedented opportunity of DNA sensing with high sensitivity. In addition, our EGFET design facilitates easy assembly and operation of DNA detection. Comparative studies on complementary and non-complementary DNA were performed to verify the specificity of the sensor. By adapting GaN nanowires structure, the assay time of DNA was shorten to within thirty minutes. Moreover, our sensor displayed an ultra-high sensitivity in the level of attoM: three orders of magnitude higher in resolution than that of current DNA detection methods.

Environmental pollution in our planet has increased alarmingly in the last ten years. Our city, Comodoro Rivadavia, and also many other cities in our country and in the planet, has not been an exception. It is estimated that a four-member family disposes daily of 2 or 3 plastic containers which are thrown into refuse dumps in the outskirts of the city, causing great trouble since it takes between 100 to 1000 years for PET plastics (polyethyleneterephthalate) generally used in containers (such as those of soda, mineral water, yogurt, sparkling water, ice cream, among others) to degrade, producing excessive accumulation of this material.<br><br>In view of the environmental problem derived from this, we have decided to develop a project of ecologic tiles aiming at minimizing the environmental impact resulting from the disposal of these plastics.<br><br>This recycling process starts with the collection of plastic material, followed by selection and cleaning in order to eliminate impurities such as remains of the product carried in the container or soil, which may affect the quality of the product. Then we shred it into small pieces which are placed in a mold to be taken to an electric furnace at 320º C, where it is left for approximately 10 minutes.<br><br>The product obtained is a recycled plastic tile with the following characteristics: ecologic, cheap, and aesthetically good, having great comparative advantages with respect to other similar ones.<br><br>

In 2010, the Brazilian Government announced that approximately one million Brazilians were waiting to receive artificial limbs provided by the SUS (Brazilian Government Unified Public Health System). The difficulty for the SUS to deliver these prostheses is due to their high cost, which is related to the materials used to produce them. Even the cheapest prostheses are too expensive for patients who depend on Government’s help. Given the impact of non-use of orthopedic prostheses, our research aims to develop a low cost orthopedic prosthesis with a similar quality to the most expensive one produced nowadays.<br><br>We designed the REVO FOOT II with recyclable materials that reduced its cost substantially. Then, we did static tests with the prototype, according to ISO 10328, that proved our prosthesis has higher resistance and impact absorption than ISO rules requires. After that, we tested our prototype “in vivo” with an amputated patient, which showed REVO FOOT II had its dynamic answer reduced. It allowed more stability to the patient during the swing phase of gait. All these results proved that the prototype has higher resistance and impact absorption than the prosthesis made from carbon fiber, changing the modulus of elasticity of the material during the human gait and making a conversion of tensions. We estimated the prosthesis durability by Goodman’s method and this showed very interesting results. The cost to produce the REVO FOOT is about US$ 80.00. Thus, this innovative product becomes accessible to most low income patients and can positively impact the lives of amputees, improving their self-esteem, promoting independence and social reintegration.

Rusting of iron is an undesirable problem which causes metal structures to be weakened and sometimes destroyed leading to economic loss. <br><br><br> Various preventativemethods are often used for treating iron objects from rusting, but seldom do they focus on the remedy for rusted objects. The initial idea of our project ‘Rustworthy’ is to treat rusted iron objects instead of brand new ones, which is very important in the conservation of historical structures.<br><br><br> During our research, we discovered that tannic acid reacts with rust to form insoluble iron-tannate complex, which acts as a protective layer to prevent further rusting. Therefore, in our investigation, we optimized the concentration of tannic acid, the main ingredient to enhance the effectiveness of the coating. We also made improvement in the adhesion and smoothness of the coating by adding phosphoric acid and ethanol respectively.<br><br><br> The effectiveness of protective coating is determined by rust indicator test. The better the effect, the less blue area is observed. The adhesion of coating is determined by observing the appearance and scraping the surface. The optimum composition of our reagent ‘Rustworthy’ is 20 gdm-3 tannic acid, 0.71M phosphoric acid and 15% v/v ethanol.<br><br><br> Possible applications of “Rustworthy” are to apply on domestic ironware and to protect rusted iron antiques while preserving their original features. <br><br><br> The advantages of Rustworthy are, firstly, it can make use of rust to achieve self-sustaining protection against further rusting so as to achieve conservation and secondly, it is a safe and easy-to-use method to treat rusted objects.

DEVELOPING SOFT MICRO-STENCIL LITHOGRAPHY FOR THE FABRICATION OF ELECTRODES ON NANO-MATERIALS
Youbin Kim, Waqarul Islam
Stuyvesant High School, New York, NY

We developed a novel microfabrication procedure to construct metallic nanostructures by deposition through a suspended soft polymer stencil lithography mask. The stencil mask is produced using two types of polymer layers that are spin-coated onto a planar silicon substrate, after which submicron patterns are etched into the polymer via microlithography. The patterned polymer layers, which form the soft micro-stencil (SMS), are subsequently separated from the substrate by etching away the bottommost sacrificial polymer layer. Employing a micro-manipulator, the SMS can be aligned to nanoscale materials. Metal evaporation through the exposed apertures of the SMS forms electrodes that contact the target sample in a highly customizable manner. Optical and atomic force microscopy reveals that the minimal achievable gap size is around 2 microns, and the maximal diffusion of the deposited metal electrodes is less than 150 nanometers. This distance of metal diffusion exhibits more than an order of magnitude improvement over conventional micro-stencil lithography, which uses non-flexible metal stencil masks. The SMS lithography developed in this work provides a new resistless lithography procedure that can fabricate highly customizable nanoscale electronics devices even on non-planar flexible substrates and substrates are sensitive to chemical treatment. In this way, SMS lithography provides not only a new method of creating nanoscale devices, but also electrically characterizing previously untestable nano-materials.

NEXT GENERATION NUCLEAR FUEL CONSTITUENT RELIABILITY ASSESSMENT: APPLYING ANALYTICAL STRESS MODELING TO TRISO PARTICLES
Sirui Ma, Jason Xiong
Oak Ridge High School, Oak Ridge, TN

The current need for energy innovation places nuclear technology, such as the theoretical reactor designs of the Generation IV initiative, in a spotlight of worldwide importance. Tristructural-isotropic (TRISO) fuel particles are a primary fuel constituent in these theoretical reactor designs, namely the proposed High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactor. Understanding and quantitatively assessing the mechanical reliability of TRISO fuel particles is vital to the implementation of reactor designs that operate using TRISO-based fuel components. This study explores the application of underlying differential equations and closed-form solutions required to calculate the fluence-dependent stress distributions generated within the three layers of TRISO fuel particles under a variety of operation conditions, such as those modeled by the PARFUME benchmarking code. The resulting information is used to evaluate the mechanical reliability of the particle constituents as a function of fluence. This model, which is developed in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, is validated by comparing calculated results with those provided in published benchmark studies. A reliability assessment is conducted on a one particle system, and the results of the assessment agree with expected levels of probability of survival. This validation allows for expansion of our model to more complex and realistic cases that exceed the parameters of the current benchmarks, as well as novel incorporation of the fourth layer, a silicon carbide matrix. The study has produced a modeling tool for the TRISO particle with the purpose of distributing this user-friendly software tool to other researchers in the nuclear energy field.

THE FUTURE OF LIGHTING: IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF ORGANIC LIGHT-EMITTING DIODES (OLEDS)
Robert Scott Dorn, Saeed Hakim-Hashemi, 
Breck School, Golden Valley, MN

We engineered novel photo-luminescent thin-film structures that can be applied to OLEDs to make OLEDs more efficient than LEDs. OLEDs are the cutting edge of lighting because they are easy to fabricate, are inexpensive, have excellent black and white contrast, and can be printed onto flexible surfaces. The thin-films we engineered were similar in design to graded-architecture OLEDs nearest to the cathode. The thin-films consisted of a spacer layer sandwiched between a cathode and an emissive layer, which was composed of a hole-transporting fluorescent material doped with a phosphor. We tested different thicknesses spacer layers to determine the thicknesses that best prevent energy lost as heat while maximizing visible light emission, we also experimented with aluminum cathodes, because aluminum is a good conductor and is cost effective. Photoluminescence ratios suggested that the optimal spacer-layer thickness that should be used with an aluminum cathode is 29.0 Å with an efficiency of 322%. Because efficiency using aluminum cathodes was improbable, we experimented with molybdenum oxide as a novel application for a cathode because it is transparent and is a better charge generator than aluminum. The optimal spacer-layer thickness that should be used with a molybdenum oxide cathode is 27.0 Å with efficiency of 18.8%. Additionally, we reversed the structure of our molybdenum oxide thin-films to mimic positioning in the structure of stacked OLEDs, which gave an efficiency of 19.6% with a 36.0 Å spacer layer.

"BREAKTHROUGH" - A SAFETY GAS VALVE BOX ACCESS LOCKING MECHANISM
Caron Maire Malone, Daniel Evans, Barbara Fleming
Rathmore Grammar School, Belfast, Northern Ireland

The project aimed to develop an innovative locking mechanism for gas valve boxes. The box is a device that protects gas valves from weathering and unauthorised access. Companies use a variety of locking mechanisms, all causing inherent problems. The traditional and most widely used steel locking screw is slow to install and remove, prone to rust and fusion from weathering, and is susceptible to clogging. <br><br>Currently there are over 15,000 boxes in the Northern Ireland Gas network. Specialist operator time spent opening and closing faulty boxes adds significantly to the overall operating costs. <br><br>Initial research focused on modifying the complete locking mechanism. However, this option would be prohibitively expensive across the whole system. Extensive testing of existing installations concluded that the central design flaw in the valve box was the steel bolt that secures the lid. Extraction of a fused bolt can create a potential spark with serious consequences in a gas escape. <br><br>Four main aspects of the mechanism were considered, namely, the material used in the bolt, design of the bolt, costs associated with installation and extraction, and the degree of integration with the existing mechanism. <br><br>The final solution involved replacing the steel bolt with high density Polyethylene thus overcoming dangers from sparks. The original screw-in threaded bolt was replaced with a push-in pin with shear-off head. Overall maintenance and extraction time was reduced by 85% thus contributing to significant savings. Additional benefits included recyclable potential, cheaper unit costs and a range of other applications in the utilities sector.<br><br>

Our project consists on improving the quality of people's life who suffer severe motion disabilities like quadriplegia worsened with aphasia. <br><br> The initial idea was to carry out an orthopedic bed, with nonexistent market characteristics, whose movements could be led by disabled.<br><br> To achieve it an electronic device was designed and built to understand signals emitted by the patient to a microphone. These are encoded by means of a binary code and according to the combination received by the device, the wished order is executed. <br><br> The project has possibilities of controlling the bed (the movement on its spare parts) or the environment (lighting, television, air conditioning, etc). The handling of the bed consists on the free movement of its parts, the storage of presettled positions ( to be used automatically ) and its later execution, besides it also adds rehabilitation exercises. <br><br> A prototype was built to determine the mechanical resistance of the bed practically, that made the use of the forces exerted by the engines improved and the effectiveness of the handling , by means of voice pulses, with people that suffer from quadriplegia with aphasia was proved. This allowed us to check the flexibility of the system, which can be commanded, not alone with the voice, but also by means of blows or taps to the microphone. <br><br> An electronic device of control was obtained, adjusted to conventional orthopedic beds this gives the system special characteristic, contributing deeply to the psychological aspects of the patients.

PREDICTING CORROSION ON STEEL FOUND IN HOSTILE MARINE CONDITIONS WITH THE USE OF POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE
Anthony Pascual, Jr., Connor Romero
Ovey Comeaux High School, Lafayette, LA

All marine vessels and underwater metal structures in all types of natural waters are subject to corrosion. Can corrosion be prevented from happening and can it be detected before it becomes a problem by use of nondestructive techniques? The purpose of this experiment was to investigate a means to predict corrosion in steel located in marine hostile conditions by use of potential difference using a voltmeter and a reference electrode. Furthermore, the study consisted of trying to determine what treatment would be best to coat steel to inhibit corrosion. The treatment consisted of protection without the worry and expense of replacing sacrificial anodes, but rather with a fixed permanent sacrificial anode. <br><br> Cold Roll Steel (144 pieces) were prepared in combination: no protection, preparation (phosphoric acid and sand blasting), sacrificial protection, and marine based paint. Samples were placed in marine hostile conditions ranging from 100 ppm to 1.2 ppt salinity (water samples collected in Louisiana). Potential difference was measured every four days for 44 days. Salinity, temperature, and pH were also measured every four days. The mass of each of the prepared samples were recorded before and after experimentation.<br><br> Ttest using EXCEL was performed (p-values < 0.05) were considered significantly different. The data collected suggests that by using a volt meter and reference electrode that signs of corrosion could be detected at an early stage. The treatments that showed the least significant difference in voltage drop over the 44 day period was in combination with marine paint. The results analyzed suggests that steel boats traveling through low salinity waters would best be treated with phosphoric acid pretreatment, sacrificial protection, and marine paint.

Is it possible to improve asphalt with a material that is currently polluting our environment as Polyethylene Terephtalate (PET)?<br><br>Ecologically improve asphalt basically consist in adding waste of PET recycle process to the asphalt to improve its most important properties. The waste of the PET recycle process is about 80% of the bottle. This project is an example of a new and a very good idea for a sustainable development project.<br><br>To know if the plastic was improving the asphalt, we ran 3 standards tests that are made to all modified asphalts. The first one is penetration, which consists to apply a standard force to the asphalt. Without PET, asphalt was too soft (69mm) and when we added PET it result harder (37mm), from that we can conclude that modified asphalt is almost twice as hard as normal asphalt. Softening point, which consists in determining the temperature where asphalt changes its state. Common asphalt changes at 48.4°C and modified asphalt changes at 64.1°C, a great improvement that allows higher temperatures and fewer changes. And the most important is Torsion, which consist in applying a torque of 180° and check the angle of recovery after half an hour; this test tell us how resistant is the asphalt to forces. From the result, the asphalt passed from 0% to 15% of elasticity. All the results are in the range required by INVIAS (national authority), so our project could be used in regular streets.

MODELING AND CHARACTERIZATION OF NOVEL HEUSLER MAGNETOCALORIC EFFECT ALLOYS
Yiwei Li, Mathilda Marie Lloyd, 
Oak Ridge High School, Oak Ridge, TN

In response to the current global energy crisis, new and more efficient refrigeration technologies must be introduced. Magnetic refrigeration, which utilizes the Magnetocaloric Effect (MCE)—a second-order phase transformation involving the interaction between fundamental electron spin behavior and a magnetic field, creating a temperature change—promises to be much more efficient and environmentally-friendly. The Shape Memory Effect (SME)—a first-order phase transformation induced by changes in magnetic field—can also be paired with the MCE, resulting in the Giant Magnetocaloric Effect (GMCE), an even larger temperature transformation. However, because current MCE materials are too costly or hazardous to be commercially applicable, the project goal was to fabricate novel MCE materials that are both effective and abundant through ab-initio modeling and high magnetic field experimentation. Based on trends predicted by first principals modeling, selected bulk samples of the Heusler family alloys were both analyzed with Differential Scanning Calorimetry and tested in a 9-Tesla magnet for possible GMCEs. One of the eight selected samples demonstrated a distinct GMCE. In addition, a strong relationship between alloy stoichiometry and the MCE and SME transformation temperatures became evident, and may be used as a basis for future synthesis of MCE materials.

MANUFACTURING A CERAMIC FILTER THAT IS DURABLE AND ECOLOGIC FOR FILTERING MOLTEN METALS
Gurcan Gurses, Alper Yanilmaz

Today, in the production of metals and steel in industry, ceramic foam filters have been used frequently. Since they contain polymer foam in their structure, they are very expensive. The pre-sence of polymer foam in the filter affects the mechanical, thermo mechanical and chemical properties of the filter negatively. <br><br> In this project we aimed to manufacture a foamless ceramic that was free of the disadvantages mentioned above. In the production, the local raw materials (kaolin, magnesia and quartz), binders [Hydroxy propyl methylcellulose (HPMC), methylcellulose (MC), carboxy methylcellulose CMC)] and lubricants (Magnesium stearat) are mixed in different mass ratios to obtain three samples of ceramic mud. In the samples, the masses of kaolin, magnesia and quartz were held constant. The mass percentages of binders and lubricants were 0,2% in the first sample, 1% in the second one, and 2% in the third one. <br><br> Then the mud samples were shaped using an injector. These samples were dried and sintered. Finally the samples were analyzed by using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) instrument and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The specimens were tested according to their ability to withstand pressure and thermal shock, their ability to allow water to flow.<br><br> The results of the specimens were compared among themselves. The best results were obtained with the specimen 3 (the specimen with 2% of binder and lubricant). <br><br> We were pleased with the results because we managed to make a foamless ceramic filter that was ecologic, economic and was manufactured using local raw materials.

DEVELOPMENT OF A CONTINUOUSLY VARIABLE TRANSMISSION
Hendrik Petrus Becker, Kieran George Mace
St John's College, Johannesburg, Gauteng, South-Africa

Considering the inherent inefficiency of the conventional motor vehicle transmission system, the initial focus of the project was to find alternative means of power transmission from a motor driven source to a variable speed output. Early on in the development process it was decided that a continuously variable transmission system would be implemented, that utilised two hollow half-toroids bridged with a continuously adjustable transfer wheel. Initial small scale prototypes displayed gearing ratios relating the drive and slave wheels of approximately 1:0.3 and 1:3, occurring in infinite variation between. Thus, the objective of the project was to design a transmission system that allowed the input power to remain constant while varying the output speed and torque continuously.<br><br>The concept came about by assessing the economy of a general motor vehicle, and observing the recurrent trend in optimal efficiency at certain peak power inputs. Operating on the presumption that a standard discrete transmission system may not allow for the engine to remain within this bracket, a system was designed to facilitate an infinitely fine adjustment in gearing ratio to allow seamless control over output. Fundamentally, the constant power supplied to the drive wheel is converted via an intermediary transmission wheel, whose angle of incidence upon the two toroids dictates the ratio of input to output. This process has led to a simple, robust design that fulfills the intended variable continuity constraint of the prototype.<br><br>

This project is to investigate the suitability of the soft spongy material obtained from the cassava stem core to be used as a substitute for polystyrene. Polystyrene is used widely as thermal insulation materials for food storing. Toxic from the polystyrene container can be released and then absorbed by the food. This can be harmful to the users. In addition, the polystyrene is not biodegradable. <br><br>The cassava stem core that we use was obtained from the middle part of cassava stems. It is the pith - soft sponge-like central cylinder of the stems of most flowering plants tissue. It has better heat insulating features than polystyrene. Its biodegradable nature can be expected to reduce the pollution of the environment if used widely in the future. We have conducted some experiments to test its ability and suitability in thermal insulation. From the experiments, we found that the cassava stem core could be a better alternative to polystyrene because it has lower thermal conductivity compared to polystyrene, low density, does not produce toxic gases when burnt, elastic biodegradable. We believe that further studies should be carried out to see its potential in the variety of angles to replace the universal human reliance on petroleum-based polystyrene.

INNOVATIVE THICKNESS MEASUREMENT OF BIOLOGICAL TISSUE BY USING MAXIMUM BUBBLE PRESSURE METHOD
Chao-Hsi Lee , Yung-Chieh Chen

The thickness of skin graft has deterministic influences on the success of graft surgery. Current experimental measurements of skin graft thickness involve complicated specimen preparation processes followed by optical microscopic examination, which are time-consuming and may incur inaccuracy due to possible damage. Here we propose a novel measuring method which incorporates Pneumatic gauging with maximum bubble pressure method. <br><br> The physical operation relies on the following principles: when the tip of a needle connecting to a catheter system is placed close to the object to be measured, the air pumped forward from the catheter system becomes impeded by the subject. The resulting backflow pressure opposing the air flow causes an increase in air pressure within the catheter and inflates the bubble connected at the other end. Distance between the needle tip to subject is attained when the bubble reaches hemispherical shape. In practice, a two-needle design was used, each approaching simultaneously from each side of the object. A micrometer was then used to read the distance between the two needle tips, from which the object thickness was derived by subtracting the thickness of the air spaces pre-calibrated using cover glass with known thickness.<br><br> The system implemented was capable of measuring thickness on soft thin films with high accuracy. In addition, since the sensitivity of the bubble is relatively high, with the viscosity and density of the liquid adjustable, it has the potential of enhancing the resolution of other pneumatic gauging devices.

Nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) is an emerging biodegradable, renewable biomaterial that possesses superior physiochemical properties. Surface modification of NCC allows for its use in a plethora of applications including water purification and drug delivery. Current sewage and water treatment plants are unable to remove trace amounts of pharmaceutical compounds from drinking water, posing new, unknown threats to humans and the environment. In this project, beta-cyclodextrin was grafted to NCC and the drug-capturing abilities of the NCC-CD complex in a water treatment setting were proven. As a negatively charged molecule with anti-microbial properties, NCC also has the potential for applications in drug delivery. Transdermal bioadhesives represent one such system; however, the side effect of skin irritation, as well as difficulty with skin adhesion, are problems that require solutions. NCC is a non-toxic molecule which does not irritate skin and can be modified to function as a bioadhesive. This compound was incorporated into a transdermal bioadhesive and drug release tests were conducted to test its performance in drug delivery. Properties for the membrane were also optimized. Membranes with NCC were prepared that could encapsulate and release 40-50% of drug added. Further results demonstrated that membranes with a higher weight percents of NCC and higher crosslinking densities captured and released more drug. This research represents important first steps in investigating the properties of NCC for applications in the pharmaceutical and biomedical fields; the advancement of such green technology will serve to safeguard human health and the environment for a sustainable future.

THE USE OF NANOPARTICLES TO DECREASE THE COEFFICIENT OF REFRACTION IN OIL RESERVOIRS FOR IMPROVING 4D SEISMIC SURVEYS
Sarah Hasan Al Abdullatif, Rund Tawfiq
Dhahran Ahliyya schoolds, Dhahran, SAUDI ARABIA

While current oil recovery rates are relatively low, ranging below 40%, costs of drilling are relatively high, at approximately $42,000 a day. The purpose of this project is to examine more accurate methods of determining the exact location of fluids in oil reservoirs. Fluids can be found more effectively by using nanofluids with 4D Seismic surveys in order to improve oil recovery rates in a cost-efficient manner. A Pickering emulsion was created with fumed Alumina nanoparticles, to alter the compressibility of the oil-water mixture. It was hypothesized that in a Pickering emulsion, the compressibility of the fluid will increase, thus decreasing the sound velocity and altering the coefficient of refraction. It is assumed that with significant alteration in the coefficient of refraction, seismic surveys would be able to locate fluids underground. In the Pickering emulsion, the speed of sound was measured using a sound source and a hydrophone. After calculating the speed of sound, density of fluids, and sound impedance, the coefficient of refraction of the oil-water interface was found to be -0.5667056599, while the coefficient of refraction of the Pickering emulsion was -3.317272084. With a difference of 2.750566424, the change in the coefficient of refraction is sufficient for sound equipment to detect the location of the fluids. Thus we concluded that the addition of nanoparticles is an improvement over current methods and would increase oil recovery rates and reduce costs.

PETIVERIA ALLIACEA, PIMIENTA RACEMOSA, CURCUBITA MAXIMA AND CARICA PAPAYA AS COPTOTERMES FORMOSANUS PLAGUE CONTROLLER
Jose Miguel Martinez Morales, Hector Luis Diaz Morales, 
Escuela Superior Bethsaida Velazquez Andujar, Ponce, PUERTO RICO

Commercial pesticides are highly toxic and produce environmental pollution. The purpose of this investigation was to create an organic biodegradable pesticide that could control plagues effectively without producing pollution. The hypothesis was: if the concentration of the extracts from: Petiveria alliacea, Pimienta racemosa, Curcubita maxima and Carica papaya is higher, then they will be more effective controlling the Coptotermes formosanos in its nest. The leaves extract of Petiveria alliacea and Pimienta racemosa, the flower extract of Curcubita maxima and Carica papaya peel extract were individually prepared as organic pesticides. In addition, two control groups were selected: purified water and a commercial pesticide. The extracts were prepared in concentrations of 100% and 50%. These extracts were applied to each of the termite’s fractioned nests. These extracts concentrations were added to different plants of Phaseolus vulgaris to determine if they could negatively affect the plants. The two most effective extracts Carica papaya and Pimienta racemosa were combined and this mixture was also applied to the termites’ nests and the Phaseolus vulgaris. All the extracts were also mixed together and the mixture was applied to the Phaseolus vulgaris plants and the termite’s fractioned nest. An HPLC (High Definition Liquid Chromatography) was done to each extract to determine if they had alkaloids, heavy metals, or other toxic materials. The data analysis evidenced that the mixture of the extract of Pimienta racemosa and Carica papaya was the most effective to control the plagues in 18 minutes without affecting the plant. The hypothesis was accepted.

In the U.S. today there are just under one million patients on kidney dialysis. The patients have to endure more than twelve hours a week hooked up to a machine that resembles a refrigerator. Kidney dialysis is a filtration process of the blood. This process is normally performed by the kidneys but when the kidneys are nonfunctional or only functioning partially then an alternative is needed. The available treatment, although lifesaving, can come with unwanted side effects. Although twelve hours may not seem like an immense amount of time, the machine is performing what would take the kidney two days in about four hours. This rapid process can severely damamge the red blood cells, which carry oxygen, and leave the patient feeling lethargic and sick. Our process is a truly portable treatment that is better for the body and less damaging to the red blood cells. The patient would carry the artificial kidney while receiving a slower, more natural cleansing process.

POTENTIAL LATERAL FLOW TEST DESIGN FOR THE DETECTION OF PARALYTIC SHELLFISH POISONING
Taylor Jade Seitz, Chelsea Marie Parrocha
Polaris K-12 School, Anchorage, AK

A major concern in Alaska is the presence of Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP). This impacts the communities all along the Alaskan seaboard (which equates to over 1/3 of the US coastline). This has a direct impact on the Alaskan fishing industry, which as of 2009 harvested 52 percent of the commercial seafood in the United States. Due to its influence on the Alaskan economy and sustenance, the study and development of a lateral flow test to detect PSP’s notorious toxin (saxitoxin) was implemented. The creation and concept of the dipstick is to allow commercial fisheries and local fisherman the ability to access immediate results displaying if their yield is contaminated with PSP. The principals of ELISA were used in the creation of the test. Using chicken antigen as the model compound of detection, the engineering of the dipstick was tested in three phases. Through each phase, alterations in the dipstick involved the manipulation and placement of the blotting and nitrocellulose paper, as well as the placement and amount of antibodies used. All three phases of the test showed design flaws. However, results of the tests demonstrate the progression and improvement of the lateral flow test’s design and thus moves the study to a promising future in creating a dipstick that will effectively identify PSP. In the future, with additional time and financing, the further development and perfected design of the lateral flow test is obtainable.

The relatively new field of rheology deals mostly with rheological fluids and their applications. Rheological fluids are fluids whose viscosity greatly increases when the right kind of external stimulus is inflicted on them. <br><br> Two kinds of relatively unknown rheological fluids, thigmorheological fluid and electrorheological fluid, are studied to determine if the fluids really have noticeable effects as shock absorbers. Two experiments were done on each of the fluids to figure out their right kind of stimuli. Throughout the experiments, it was shown that the thigmorheological fluid, at its saturation point, has considerable rheology when a substantial amount of impulse is inflicted on it and that the electrorheological fluid, also at its saturation point, has rheology when placed under an electric field. In addition, two experiments were done on the duration of the fluids to suggest a novel way to increase their duration. We hypothesized that by creating a convection flow within the fluids, their duration will increase. This hypothesis proved to be correct. However, starch started to melt after a certain temperature. Therefore, it is suggested that under temperatures within the melting point of starch, convection flow can be created to increase the duration.<br><br> From the data and the known properties of starch, we developed a theory to explain the cause of rheology in thigmorheological fluid. Although it is shown that thigmorheological fluid and electrorheological fluid could be used as shock absorbers that could replace expensive magnetorheological fluid, further study is suggested to eternalize the fluids duration for more practicality.<br><br> <br><br>

Since most of Thai workers are relied heavily on agricultural industries, there are a number of potential environmental impacts associated with agricultural activities if they are not properly managed. For instead, people usually burns unwanted flora or agricultural by-product waste which causes the run-off of nutrients to ground surface and also contributes to greenhouse gases emissions. Thus, it is our goal to find an environmentally friendly alternative to the unwanted flora and agricultural by-product waste to manufacture compressed particleboards which would be beneficial not only to the environment but also to our society in general.<br><br> The initial idea was to determine which types of wastes would produce the most effective and environmentally friendly material for compressed particleboards. In this study, three types of wastes were selected including giant mimosa, aged mango and rice straw which are generally found the most in our neighbor area. We found that the giant mimosa was suitable for particleboard because it is not only surpass the industrial-grade particleboard standard, it can prevent termite and fungus better than others, as well. Next, to find a suitable binder in considering of the particleboard property improvement and the cost effective in manufacturing, three different types of glues, Urea-Formaldehyde (UF), polymeric di-isocyanate (pMDI) and Latex, were selected. The results of our project found that there were two options for making the compressed particleboards that meet the industrial standard. The mixture of giant mimosa and pMDI had high quality but costly, on the other hand, the manufacture of giant mimosa and Latex had less quality but more less expensive in manufacturing.

The purpose of the project was to find out if eliminating the eaves on a modern roof can make the roof more hurricane resistant. Students researched hurricane wind strengths of the past 10 years in the Atlantic coast of Texas and effective hurricane resistant roof designs. Roofs were hand sketched, then designed using Auto-CAD and then built. They were tested in a student built wind tunnel. The structure that presented the least failure was the third structure with the innovative roof design. In conclusion our data supported our hypothesis. In fact if one removes the eaves off a structural roof the empirical probability of is close to 0 compared to the structure with eaves which gave us an outcome of close to 1. Using the empirical probability formula, “P [G(X) < 0] =∑/y P [G(X) < 0|D = y] P [D = y]”, we determined the failure rate. Hurricane Resistant Roof Design 3 “Control” gave us a 33% of structural collapse, Hurricane Resistant Roof Design Adjustment A gave us a 40% structural collapse, Hurricane Resistant Roof Design Adjustment B gave us a 20% structural collapse.

RED DIRT BRICKS AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO CLAY: CLEANING THE ENVIRONMENT WHILE BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOMES
Christian Joel Bracy, Robert Harry Thompson
Good Hope School, Fredricksted St.Croix, U.S.V.I. 

Waste stinks (in more way than one) and so does homelessness. The purpose of this project was to find a way to construct reliable red bricks and to compare them to traditional clay bricks. Using various amounts of stabilized red dust, instant cement, and water, we created red brick mixtures, which were sun-dried and then compared with clay bricks. We tested their strength and how much water each brick absorbs. The best red bricks were composed of 2/3 solids, most of which being red dirt. This occurred because too much cement causes excessive stiffness, and too much water makes it nearly impossible for the bricks to dry. Having the water and cement balance each other out, along with ample red dirt, nearly perfected the mixture. I would be interested to see someone else make construction or other types of purposeful materials out of other types of waste, or to see what common materials can be added to the red dirt bricks to make them stronger and more resistant to water absorption.<br><br>

Eco-Hybrid House: Sustainable combination of energy sources, without ecological damages. This experiment studies the effect of combining fuel cells, desalinated sea water and solar panels in the operation of a solar house.<br><br>Two hypothesis were set: First, if there is a relation between the use of solar panels and the energy produced by a fuel cell, then the energy production or energetic efficiency can be increased. Second, if there is a relation between the type of water used and the electrolysis process in an Eco-Hybrid House, then the use of desalinated sea water will be as efficient, or more, in producing voltage as destilled water.<br><br>To test this, electric voltage measurements are taken in scale models with and without fuel cells, then voltage measurements produced by fuel cells with batteries recharged with solar panels are also taken. Finally, electric energy and hydrogen production measurements using destilled water and desalinated sea water, with solar panel-recharged batteries are compared.<br><br>After completing the experiment, it proved that a solar house could be more efficient in producing electric energy when combining fuel cells with solar panels. The capacity to produce electric voltage increased with this combination as much as 47.6% in comparison with solar panels alone. Also, fuel cells were 11.17% more efficient in producing electric voltage with desalinated sea water. This enhances the viability of exploring new combinations of energy sources, with low or no negative ecological impact, a real: Eco-Hybrid House.

NANO-TEXTURE BASED TRANSPARENT SUPERHYDROPHOBIC COATING FOR ANTI-ICING APPLICATIONS AND FOR THE WELFARE OF THE MILITARY AND AERONAUTICS INDUSTRY
Dana Abulez, Devyani Shekhawat
Little Rock Central High School, Little Rock, AR

Ice and snow buildup on planes is common, yet potentially deadly. It can cause lag, decreased visibility, increased fuel consumption, and even a crash. This is why it is important to engineer surfaces, particularly glass and aluminum surfaces, to be superhydrophobic. The purpose of this study was to create samples of an aluminum surface with tungsten nanorods, and a glass surface with zinc oxide nanorods; the nanorods are what give the surfaces superhydrophobic properties. The tungsten surface was created by first anodizing and chemically etching the aluminum. Next, a Magnetron Sputtering Gun was used to deposit the tungsten on to the modified aluminum. However, the zinc oxide surface was created by using pulsed laser deposition with nitrogen gas. After the surfaces were prepared, small drops of water were dropped onto the samples and their contact angles were recorded. A contact angle indicates wettability, and therefore superhydrophobicity. A large contact angle is equivalent to low wettability; thus, the surface is more hydrophobic. An angle above 90° is hydrophobic. An angle above 150° is superhydrophobic. It was hypothesized that the aluminum would become superhydrophobic, while the glass would simply be hydrophobic as a result of the pyramidal tips of the tungsten nanorods versus the flat hexagonal tips of the zinc oxide nanorods. The tungsten nanorods exhibited greater hydrophobic properties than the zinc oxide nanorods and thus could be further utilized for anti-icing applications with an average contact angle of 135.9° as opposed to zinc oxide’s average of 125.1°.

Synthetic wax has been used in fruit coating because it provides a barrier to moisture and oxygen for the fruits, allowing the fruits to have a longer shelf life. However, it is expensive and is usually imported to be used in Thailand. Therefore, alternative coating substances are needed to be explored. This project studies a possibility to use the mucilage derived from lemon basil seeds (Ocimum canum sims), a common plant found in Thailand, for fruit coating. This mucilage is used as food additives to increase the food stickiness and as ingredients in weight loss diets. The extracted mucilage is dehydrated to form films, and their mechanical properties are examined. This dehydrated film is then rehydrated into solutions with three different concentrations, 0.5%, 1%, and 2% (weight/volume), and are used to coat rose apples. The coated fruits are measured for their weight loss, respiration rate, ethylene producing rate, and total soluble solid content. In addition, the quality of the fruits is analyzed using sensory evaluation in terms of freshness, glossiness, odor, crispiness, taste, and overall satisfaction. These properties are compared to those of the fruits without coating and with synthetic wax coating. The results indicate the potential to apply the lemon basil seed mucilage as a safe and inexpensive fruit coating substance.

MODIFICATION OF SUNFLOWER STALK EXTRACTS WITH BORIC ACID AND THEIR USAGE AS HIGH PERFORMANCE INSULATION MATERIAL
Tahsin Azizagaoglu, Alihan Zenginer, 
Private Cag Fatih High School, Istanbul, TURKEY

Nowadays the importance of heat, sound and fire isolation increases day by day. In particular, heat insulation helps in minimum use of energy. It is also becoming significant in that it prevents the global warming caused by fossil fuels. Sound insulation materials are used to prevent noise pollution in this century. The material to be used in insulation needs to be highly fire resistant. In this study the aim was to put to good account the sunflower stalks left in the agricultural land. At first the fire resistance of the sunflower stalk extract was changed through boric acid. Then these extracts were turned to blocks in hot press by using adequate binding agents. Then technical properties like the fire resistance, heat transfer coefficient, sound absorption coefficient and water absorption rate of the acquired material were measured. According to the measurements, the acquired material turned out to yield especially heat transfer coefficient, fire resistance and sound absorption coefficient standards. The acquired material turned out to be adequate for heat, fire and sound insulation in houses, flats, offices and education buildings when these technical properties were taken into account. Thus it was shown that the sunflower stalks which were not put to good account for years in our country could be used efficiently in sound and fire insulation.

<br><br> Leather benefit companies receive from their customers a sample of leather that must be reproduced, in a large scale, with the same color and texture of the sample. Frequently, there is a disparity between the customers and companies opinions about what is the right color.<br><br> So, when it occurs, there is a loss of hundred meters of leather. This happens because colors are visually evaluated and each person has a different perception of them. In medium-sized brazilian companies this loss is about USD 600,000.00 a year.<br><br> In order to solve this problem a software was developed using international colorimetry standards. It allows to resolve and quantify small differences of color.<br><br> The results obtained with this software, were highly satisfactory in typical samples of leather os Vale dos Sinos region.

CONSTRUCTION OF FOLATE CONJUGATED SYA/J6 ANTIBODIES TO TARGET SHIGELLA FLEXNERI TO SPECIFICALLY INFECT COLORECTAL CANCER CELLS
Manjot Sangha, Dennis Xu, 
Iroquois Ridge High School, Oakville, Ontario, CANADA

Colorectal cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed malignancy in the United States. It is also the second most frequent cause of cancer death in the United States constituting 10% – 15% of total cancer deaths. We propose a novel bacteria-based therapeutic model for the non-invasive treatment of early stage colorectal cancer and the potential to replace chemotherapy treatments. <br><br> It has been shown that some cancerous colonic epithelial cells overexpress the surface protein folate receptor alpha (FR1) which is negligibly expressed on non-cancerous colonic cells. Our model involves the surface modification of Shigella flexneri bacteria with folate conjugated SYA/J6 antibodies to increase the bacteria’s affinity for cancerous cells. The bispecific conjugate will be able to bind to both the surface LPS of Shigella flexneri via the SYA/J6 antibody and the FR1 of cancerous cells via the coupled folate. This will provide the modified bacteria with a greater number of binding sites for cancerous cells, as opposed to non-cancerous cells, increasing the likelihood of infection of the cancerous cells. <br><br> Folate was coupled with the antibody and the conjugates were characterized by spectrophotometric analysis. An ELISA and immunomicroscopy were used to confirm the binding of the conjugates to both the S. flexneri surface LPS and Caco-2 colorectal cancer cells, respectively. Results showed evidence for the practicality of folate-SYA/J6 conjugates that merit further testing.

L.C. Anderson High School, Austin, TX

The purpose of this scientific investigation was to develop an improved life-support system (atmospheric & waste-water revitalization) for long duration space-flight that utilizes algae. The primary engineering goal of this project was to reduce the amount of water consumed during atmospheric and waste-water revitalization, a common problem that hinders currently used electrolysis and desiccant based systems on the International Space Station (ISS). The procedure included designing and testing (evaluated gas transfer rates, water loss, and other traits used to identify overall efficiency of life-support system) a prototype algae based life-support system and a scaled, control, life support system based on current technology used on-board the ISS. The data collected indicates that the prototype algae based life-support system consumed 48% less water during operation, while revitalizing cabin air (in sealed test chamber) at a rate 68% greater than the control life-support system. The algae based life-support system, in addition to producing potable water, also produced a nutrient-rich, consumable, algal byproduct. In conclusion, as a result of the data collected, the hypothesis was proven correct. A closed-loop system that could efficiently utilize algae to replace current life support systems and effectively reduce water consumption was successfully developed and validated through scientific processes.

BAMBOO-BASED COMPOSITES FOR EARTHQUAKE-RESISTANT BUILDING MATERIALS
Andrey Irawan Halim, Reyner Jong, 
Santa Laurensia High School, Tangerang Selatan, Banten, INDONESIA

Many places in the world lie on the areas that are vulnerable to earthquake. Many small or big earthquakes had happened, causing massive damages to building and endanger the human lives inside the building. It is known that the mass death is mostly due to the collapsed buildings than the earthquake itself. The housing in such areas is therefore expected to be able withstand the earthquake. Such building materials are unfortunately not affordable for most people around the world. In this research we propose bamboo as an alternative material for earthquake-resistant buildings. Because there are more than 1500<br><br>species of bamboo around the world. Also, bamboo plants release 35% more<br><br>oxygen than woody trees, while some species of bamboo use only up to 12 tons carbon dioxide from the air per hectare. Moreover, bamboo grows very fast compared to woody trees. An excessive use of bamboos will not cause deforestation.<br><br>In this research, we investigate in detail several structures of bamboo-based composites as substituting materials for main parts of earthquake-resistant buildings. From our experimental results bamboo has high elasticity, tensile strength and also very lightweight. The experiments have been performed for bamboo-based composite materials made from woven bamboo fiber and crushed bamboo stems with various structures. The characteristics of each structure (tensile, bending, compression strengths) were measured. It is argued that each structure can be used as different parts of the earthquake-resistant building.

Metals having chemical and electrochemical reactions with their surroundings can go bad and become unusable, It’s called corrosion. Many metals, especially iron, undergo corrosion when exposed to air and water. 1/10 of all metallic materials produced every year becomes unusable and it’s not possible to recycle them. Loss caused by corrosion costs billions of dollars every year.<br><br>This study presents the results of corrosion resistance of ground blast furnace slag GBFC, chrome slag CS and corn stems ash CSA.<br><br> In this study, GBFC, CS and CSA, produced as a result of some procedures, are mixed with pitch in different portions.Then the iron plates were coated with this mixture. Coated and uncoated plates were undergone corrosion in NaCI solution. The plates were put into NaCI solution and the potential differences were measured. Our aim to do so was to reduce the potential difference. If the potential difference reduces, therefore the corrosion reduces. <br><br>Whereas the potential difference of the coated iron electrodes is zero volt. According to these results, no corrosion occurred on the iron plates that were left in corrosive surroundings. <br><br>The results of this study show that GBFC, CS and CSA prevent corrosion. <br><br>If the substance is used <br><br>Billions of dollars’ loss is prevented<br><br>A profitable use of GBFC which is environmentally harmful, can be made and the nature can be protected<br><br>An economical use of CS, which is thrown away can be gained<br><br>Some profit can be gained from CS that are left to be rotten in fields.

THE CONVERSION OF SOLAR ENERGY UTILIZING PHASE-CHANGE MATERIALS
Kevin Clair Cheatham, Andy Scott Magstadt
Greybull High School, Greybull, Wyoming, USA

There is a great need for new sources of energy around the world. Nonrenewable fossil fuels are becoming increasingly expensive and more scarce every year. It is the purpose of this research to develop efficient conversion of solar energy through phase changing materials (PCM's).

THE CONVERSION OF SOLAR ENERGY UTILIZING PHASE CHANGE MATERIALS AS A MEANS OF ELECTRICAL GENERATION
Kevin Clair Cheatham, Andy Scott Magstadt
Greybull High School, Greybull, Wyoming, USA

There is a need for a new source of energy. It is the purpose of this project to develop a method of converting solar power into usable energy. This energy would be stored using phase changing materials (PCMs). These materials would allow the thermal energy to be transferred to a steam engine. This changes thermal energy to mechanical energy that has a potential to produce electricity. This would be a widely available source of power that is clean, renewable, and cheap. <br><br> Through research, four different phase-change materials were chosen. These PCMs were tested for efficiency and applicability. Calcium Chloride Hexahydrate (CaCl2 6H20) was chosen based on these areas. It proved to gain and lose heat the most rapidly of the four, which would allow for quick heat transfer in the final apparatus.<br><br> As focusing the sunlight directly onto the water can also produce steam, this project also seeks to determine whether or not the use of phase change materials would be a more efficient method of heat transfer. Therefore, experimentation was conducted in two separate trials, one with water and one with the PCM. Each fluid was heated by focused radiation from the concave mirror to determine heat transfer efficiency.<br><br> In the apparatus, there are five basic parts. The concave mirror focuses the sun’s radiation onto the heating chamber holding the PCM. The heated PCM then travels through the heat exchanger, transferring its heat energy to the steam engine. Finally, a pump circulates the PCM throughout the apparatus.

The paddle cactus (Opuntia Ficus Indica) is a natural resource which appears as an interesting production alternative for the arid and semiarid region of Chuña. Yet in our region, only the fruit is used in making jams. Our research arises from the intention to make use of the paddles that are currently discarded.<br><br>We found that in other countries the paddles are used to make beauty products.<br><br>Since data gathered from different observations that the group performed, it may be concluded that there are several factors that contribute to the lack of use of the pads as a raw material (for example in the cosmetic industry) among our community:<br><br>- Lack of information;<br><br>- No policies related to processing, marketing nor trading cactus’ pads products.<br><br>- Little joint work among different actors<br><br>Based on the precedent evidences, we decided to make use of the cactus’ paddles to produce cosmetic products like moisturizing body cream, after sun replenishing gel, shampoo, hair conditioner and liquid soap. <br><br>We processed the paddles to extract the mucilage and add ethylic alcohol to conserve the product as a gel. Then we used that gel as the base for making the other beauty products mentioned above.<br><br>From 500 g of paddles, 500 ml of water and 5 ml of ethylic alcohol we obtained 1,000 ml of gel approx.<br><br>As a result of our project, the community changed its vision regarding the value of the cactus’ paddles seeing now this as a business opportunity.

After having approached the topic of recycling in our classroom, we grew much interest on the subject, which led us to some visits to recycling centers and plants. <br><br>Using the opportunity, we have developed a scale model of a recycling plant and presented it in the Sciences Fair of our school. While building the model, we have used, among other materials, old electronic devices (considered scrap) which we disassembled and used some of the parts in our scale model, according to our needs. <br><br>Thus, there was hardly any need for investment. The two-story model measures about 1m² and it has 15 miniature machines connected to 6 or 12 volts and remotely controlled. <br><br>Through time we have improved the initial project, including more miniatures and focusing on society awareness about the importance of separating garbage for recycling and of commitment with the environment. That is how the Specific Center for Recycling and Community Education project started: a center in charge of screening and processing domestic garbage, which uses alternative energy sources (solar and wind) and offers lectures on environment education, stating our commitment towards the well-being of people and the environment. <br><br>

MICROFILTRATION PROPERTY OF CHICKEN EGGSHELL MEMBRANE AND POTENTIAL USAGE IN PORTABLE WATER FILTERING DEVICE
Anh Trong Nam Hoang, Huong Vu, Linh Do
Hanoi-Amsterdam High School, Hanoi, VIETNAM

This work investigated the microfiltration property of chicken eggshell membrane (CESM), focusing on researching its structure, physical and mechanical characteristics, bacterial filtration and potential usage. Scanning electron micro-images of CESM confirmed a micron porous structure with several layers of intertwining fibers, which has a potential for bacterial filtration. A single membrane can tolerate a maximum air pressure of 0.54 bar. When CESM is applied in a holder, the water flow rate is linearly dependent on pressures over 1–5 bar and decreases as the number of membranes increases. Microfiltration tests with tap, rain, and ground water were conducted, showing a consistently high efficiency of bacterial filtration. Noticeably, in filtered water culture samples by CESM, an overall bacterial decrease of 94–100% was recorded. Standard analysis further confirmed such reduction of harmful bacteria, especially Total Coliform (99–100%) and Salmonella (100%). After infrared drying, CESM still maintained its microfiltration characteristic. A unique hemispherical holder with a radius of 16.5 mm and total height of 30 mm, suitable for typical CESM, was developed. Each holder has 50 holes with a radius of 1 mm, offering a total filtering area of 157 mm2. Preliminary tests on the self-designed model demonstrated an adequate filtration speed for future applications (approximately 1 liter in 8 hours at 1 bar). Further improvements were implemented, increasing the filtering area with 3 holders. In conclusion, CESM has a great potential of becoming an efficient and novel microfiltration material.

FABRICATION OF HOLLOW POLYMER NANOFIBER MEMBRANES VIA CO-AXIAL ELECTROSPINNING FOR WATER PURIFICATION
Aileen Yee-Ru Huang, Renee Beach, 
Plano Senior High School, Plano, TX

The majority of Earth’s water cannot be drunk or is inaccessible, and a skyrocketing global population has begun to strain fresh water resources. Thus, membrane filtration has emerged as an efficient and cost-effective alternative for water treatment. Hollow nanofibers have properties such as a high surface area-to-volume ratio and a high packing density, and therefore are the ideal material to be used in membranes.<br><br> Co-axial electrospinning--a derivative technique of electrospinning, where an electric potential difference is applied to a liquid to eject the liquid as a nano-sized jet--generated nanofibers possessing concentric layers (a polymeric shell and a core made of an alkane mixture). <br><br> Polyacrylonitrile (PAN), polysulfone, Matrimid 5218, and polybenzimidazole (PBI) polymers were selected for electrospinning. The cores of the fibers were dissolved or evaporated. Except for PBI, all polymers produced hollow nanofibers, which were then bundled together to construct membranes through which water could travel from one end to the other by capillary action. The membranes successfully filtered Rhodamine B and FD&C Blue No. 1 dyes from water. <br><br> The filtrates from all trials were placed under UV-visible spectroscopy to quantify the membranes' effectiveness. Results showed that the membranes filtered dyes with high efficiency, proving it is a practical means of water purification. Future potential applications include desalination, membrane pervaporation, enzyme filtration, filtering heavy metals from water, and filtering viruses from the bloodstream.

Colegio Cientifico de Costa Rica, Sede San Carlos, Florencia, San Carlos, Alajuela, COSTA RICA

Micropropagation as a means to cultivate is an important technological option for Costa Rica, generating faster production and better quality. As part of this technique, the cultivation of carrot callus is very important; due to its high cost, it requires a careful control on growth to ensure its optimum performance. However, the existing methods used to measure the size of callus are inconvenient, for their destructive character or for their inaccuracy. <br><br>The purpose of this project is to develop a nondestructive method to measure the volume of callus in vitro, as precise as the destructive methods and make it work as a technique to monitor and evaluate the callus’ growth. <br><br>The research consisted of evaluating 10 carrot calluses weekly during ten weeks. Four methods to measure the size of callus were used, two destructive: the area and the volume (real value), and two nondestructive: formula for the area of the callus, and six formulas prepared for the volume of the callus. Then, a comparison was made between the data obtained from the formulas that were developed and the actual volume of the callus. <br><br>When this comparison was made, it was observed that the formula that best adjusts to the volume of the callus is the formula derived from the volume of the ellipsoid, which uses three dimensions of the callus: height (a), length (b) and width (c). <br><br>With the help of this formula, a computer program was developed, which allows automating the calculations and the necessary process to calculate the volume of the calluses produced in vitro. <br><br>The formulas used that derive from the volume of the ellipsoid have the greatest concordance with the actual volume of the callus produced in vitro, and from these formulas, the most accurate is the one that uses the three dimensions of the callus: length, width and height; therefore, it can be implemented as a method to measure the volume of callus. <br><br><br>

HOW MUCH ENERGY HAVE YOU SPENT TODAY?
Isil Purali, Destina Buyukgenc
Ankara Ayranci Anadolu Lisesi, Ankara, TURKEY

Obesity is a serious health problem particularly in developed countries. In addition to its primary discomfort and morbidity it may cause several secondary diseases like diabetes, cancer, digestive and movement disorders. In treatment of obesity it is essential to establish a slightly negative balance between the energy intake and the daily energy need to provide a weight loss. In order to prescribe an efficient diet daily energy expense and the energy supplied by the daily food intake must be calculated. It is not very difficult to calculate the energy supplied by the foods. However, calculation of the daily energy expense is not an easy task. Present, work aimed at firstly finding a signal which could be used to monitor daily physical activities of a person and secondly to process the recorded signal so that activities could be classified and evaluated to calculate the daily energy expenditure. We have used a tiny 3D accelerometer to monitor physical activities of a person and developed a set of algorithms to process the acceleration signal, for calculation of the energy expenditure. By analyzing the signal we could extract, active and passive, laying, standing, walking and running periods of the subject with a reliable precision. By assigning appropriate constants it is possible to calculate the daily energy expenditure of the individual precisely. The proposed method is user friendly and superior to the conventional ones on several aspects. It is very easy to harness the device and the algorithms can define a quantitative output which could be used for individualized diets. Conventional energy charts are based on the mean values obtained from a population. They have wide ranges and do not represent personal changes. However, our results are precise and specific.

A ONE-LEAD ELECTROCARDIOGRAPH WITH DIGITAL TRANSMISSION AS COMMUNICATION TOOL AND AFFORDABLE FIELDWORK DEVICE FOR FIGHTING CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES
Joao Ramos, Luis Fresco, Wellingthon Almeida
Escola Secundaria c/3 Ciclo Dr. Mario Sacramento, Aveiro, PORTUGAL

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the main cause of death or disability worldwide, killing 17 million people each year. Since therapeutic options for these diseases are limited, prevention plays a critical role in minimizing victims of CVDs. In the modern developed world, raising awareness and stimulating lifestyle changes are therefore essential actions to decrease deaths by CVDs and improve the world’s citizens overall health. Meanwhile, most developing countries, which have a worrying lack of medical resources, need cheap and reliable means of diagnosis. Accordingly, the goal of our project has been to help fight death and disability rates due to CVDs, adopting two different strategies, both relying on the design and construction of a one-lead electrocardiograph prototype with digital transmission, e.g. for monitoring on a common laptop computer: in developed countries, using Science and Technology to capture the public’s attention, show people in public sessions a signature of their working heart and therefore suggest the need to protect it; in developing countries, such a cheap, portable, energy-efficient and easy to reproduce device may be a solution for the fieldwork of healthcare professionals. A weak electrical signal collected from a patient was amplified (AD8221 from Analog Devices), filtered (active band-pass filter), processed (PIC16F876 microcontroller from Microchip) and graphically represented (Oscilloscope.dll). Besides explicitly demonstrating the working principles of commercial ECG devices and being a state-of-the-art functional prototype of a Telemedicine system with clinical application, our device has proven to be versatile and reliable as instrument for attaining the aforementioned goal.

The purpose of our research is to make poor country which can't using electricity get their economic self-sufficiency with the help of incubator which is produced by appropriate technology. Our incubator doesn't need electricity because it use hot pack and insulation.<br><br> In 1st experiment we have 3 types of incubator. <br><br>1. Graphite insulation with sodium acetate hot pack.<br><br>2. white styrofoam with graphite insulation and sodium acetate hot pack.<br><br>3. graphite insulation with hot water.<br><br> Result is graphite insulation with hot water is the best of them. The problem of 1st experiment was lack of ventilation system and high humidity.<br><br> In 2nd experiment We added red clay insulation and iron powder hot pack. We have experiment to compare insulations, and to compare sodium acetate hot pack and iron powder hot pack. As a result, red clay insulation is to keep temperature longer than the others to keep proper humidity. Iron powder hot pack lasts longer than sodium acetate hot pack. But sodium acetate can be reused while iron powder can't. And sodium acetate is more cheaper than iron powder about 10times. Therefore sodium acetate is proper for heating metod instead of electricity.<br><br> In 3rd experiment we have an experiment to find optimal amounts of water and sodium acetate. As a result, water 2L with sodium acetate 1500g show 38.9 which is the most proper temperature. And we made equipment to roll the eggs for prevent losing heat and convenience.<br><br> Our specific point is that we use red clay insulation and reusable sodium acetate which is eco-friendly and economical. In conclusion, by using sodium acetate, hot water, red clay insulation, we can make an incubator which can help economical neglected countries to achieve self-sufficiency in their economical part.

ANGLE INDICATOR (ATOR)
Sarah Sofia Yahya, Awis Qarni Fadil, Ricca Rahman Nasaruddin
Muar Science Secondary School, Muar, Johore, Malaysia

Angle Indicator (ATOR) is specially created to measure the angle of a surface. In the beginning, ATOR is built to measure the basic angle in construction such as 0, 45 and 90 degrees. However, to expand its usage, the mercury tube in ATOR is rotatable to measure all angles. The ATOR can accelerate time and it is very sensitive in determining the accuracy sharpness of the angle. Moreover, it is equipped with sound and light censors which help to accelerate in determining whether the angle is accurate or not. This device function with a circuit which uses mercury as a connector. Mercury-filled tube will be connected to the circuit using metal rods and wyres. At the exact angle, mercury will be at the horizontal position and the circuit will be connected. ATOR can be used at the construction site and also at the furniture factory. The sloping position of the bricks and the furniture surfaces can be detected faster and it can be solved easily. To use the ATOR, we need to choose the angle of the surface that we want to measure and put the ATOR on the surface. Inside the ATOR, mercury will touch the tube’s both ends that was made of metal rods, if the surface is at the right angle that we had chosen. Automatically, the L.E.D will produce light and the buzzer will be sounded. In a nutshell, this prototype can be used to measure the surface with any angle.<br><br>

MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES AND THERMALLY-RESPONSIVE POLYMER FOR HYPERTHERMIC CANCER TREATMENT AND SUSTAINED DRUG DELIVERY
Sarah Y. Wang, Michelle Liu, 
duPont Manual Magnet High School, Louisville, KY

A novel cancer treatment method was designed using a combination of iron oxide nanoparticles and Pluronic F-127 (PF127). Iron oxide nanoparticles have magnetic properties and can be heated under alternating electromagnetic (AEM) field to a temperature at which tumor cells can be destroyed (41~45°C). In case tumors cannot be completely destroyed by heat alone, iron oxide nanoparticles will be combined with PF-127 for sustained drug delivery. PF-127 is a polymer that shows thermoreversible, concentration-dependent gelation properties when prepared in aqueous solutions. PF127 as a gel is an attractive drug delivery vehicle due to its zero-order release properties. PF127 can release drugs to treat remaining tumor cells for long-term treatment. This method would be minimally-invasive and targeted to the cancer area, minimizing the negative side effects present in traditional cancer treatments. <br><br>As a preliminary study, the gelling and heating properties of iron oxide nanoparticle/PF127 mixtures were tested to provide treatment specifications. Gelation studies showed PF127 at 18% (w/w) gels at ~28°C, which is ideal for the cancer treatment as it is injectable at room temperature and should form gel upon injection (37°C). Studies also showed iron oxide nanoparticles had little effect on gelation temperatures of PF127. Heating performance studies showed a decrease in nanoparticle heating with the addition of PF127. Among iron oxide nanoparticle concentrations of 0.01-0.05% (w/v) mixed with PF127 at 18% (w/w), 0.05% (w/v) showed the most effective heating performance with an average ΔT of ~7°C. <br><br>The combination of iron oxide nanoparticles and PF127 for cancer treatment should allow for initial tumor-specific hyperthermia treatment and long-term sustained drug delivery.

SYNTHESIS OF NANO-STRUCTURED GRAPHENE COMPOSITES WITH HIGH-SURFACE-AREA AT SOLID STATE
Katie Xin Gao, Charles Liang
Carmel High School, Carmel, IN

Graphene, a single atomic layer of graphite that can be found in a pencil, is an exciting material with great promise. In this study, high specific-surface-area (SSA) (in m²/g) graphene composites were synthesized. Due to Van Der Waals forces, each graphene layer possesses a strong affinity to restack back into graphite. To solve this problem, six novel micro- and nano-particles with varying weight percentages were introduced to function as spacers that anchored onto and between graphene oxide sheets during the process of exfoliation of graphite oxide before chemical reduction. This led to high SSA graphene with sizable pores desirable for ion transport when used as supercapacitor electrodes. The SSA of the synthesized graphene composites significantly increased from pure graphene’s SSA of 143 m2/g to our highest achieved SSA of 890 m2/g, which utilized 2% content of EC600 COOH as spacers. Our results revealed to be superior to most other graphene composite results reported in recent literature. We also achieved, using 2% EC600 COOH/graphene composite, a specific capacitance of 96 F/g at a current density of 0.1 A/g through electrochemical testing in a two-electrode system and a specific capacitance of 233 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g through electrochemical testing in a three-electrode system. Our results suggest that micro- and nano-particle spacers with many functional groups utilize strong hydrogen bonds to prevent the restacking of graphene sheets, thus leading to the formation of nano-structured graphene composites with high SSA desirable in many applications, one of which being supercapacitors.

TOWARD ARTIFICIAL ENDOSPORES: INTRODUCING VERSATILITY AND FUNCTIONALITY TO LIVING CELLS BY BIOMIMETIC FORMATION OF SIO2-TIO2 NANOCOMPOSITE SHELLS
Jimin Hwang, Yeonjung Yoon, 
Korea Science Academy of KAIST, Busan, SOUTH KOREA

Spores in nature have shells that protect cells and induce dormancy. Since 2009, there have been ventures of artificial spore formation using materials such as SiO2 and TiO2. However, each material has disadvantages. The Si-O bonds of SiO2 spores are too strong to introduce new functionalities, and TiO2 spores have low viability. Therefore, we attempted to exploit both SiO2 and TiO2 in forming artificial spores to complement each part and enhance the functionality and versatility of living cells. First, we formed artificial spores using the Layer-by-Layer (LbL) method. The LbL method, a method of forming multilayers by alternately immersing the designated surface into positively and negatively charged electrolytes, is advantageous because of its biocompatibility. Because previous LbL methods were not applicable to nanocomposites involving multiple precursors, we designed effective procedures through repeated pre-experiments on gold plates and Chlorella cells. According to the procedures, Chlorella cells were encapsulated with SiO2-TiO2 nanocomposites. The next step was to verify that SiO2 and TiO2 aggregated on individual cells, and that those cells were viable. After that, we further analyzed the characteristics of SiO2-TiO2 artificial spores. The SiO2-TiO2 artificial spores displayed resilience to heat and stability without division. Functionality was introduced to the shells by post-functionalization with catechol groups and magnetic functionalization with Fe3O4 nanoparticles. These characteristics of SiO2-TiO2 artificial spores can be utilized in developing stable and controllable cell-based biosensors. Furthermore, those benefits may be applied to store unicellular organisms in seed banks all over the world and thus contribute to environmental conservation.

Aurea E.Quiles Claudio, Guanica, Puerto rico

There is a worldwide problem because of the lack of potable water for all people and there is also a worldwide energy crisis. The purpose of this investigation was to construct a solar desalinator of seawater that can satisfy the needs of water for domestic use. A solar desalinator model was designed using common and low cost materials. The model consisted of glass panels glued together in a specific way and into a particular shape. It used magnifying glasses to increase the solar radiation that went into the tank of seawater. <br><br> The effectiveness of this model was determined through different tests to the desalinated water obtained using it. The obtained desalinated water was tested for pH, conductivity, alkalinity, nitrates presence, disolved oxigen and salinity. The same tests were done to seawater, distilled water and potable water to compare the results for those obtained with desalinated. The results of the tests evidenced that desalinated water had excellent qualities, sometimes better than those of potable water. <br><br> The contributions of this solar desalinator are its viability and low cost and that it can be accessible to coastal territories. Due to the characteristics of design and function of the solar desalinator it is a great alternative to conserve the environment and reduce energy consumption.<br><br>

This new Linux-based medical engineering technology allows precise correlation of reconstructed 3D ultrasound images with standard mammography images improving diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.<br><br> We designed then engineered a novel system of “full-field” 3Dimensional breast ultrasound based on existing 2D ultrasound equipment and advanced NDI 3D spatial position sensing technology. We zapped software “bugs” and solved many interesting engineering problems to produce multi-planar reconstructed breast tissue images which can for the first time, be directly correlated with standard mammography images. We then demonstrated that this new 3D diagnostic breast imaging system can be installed in conjunction with existing 2D ultrasound and mammography equipment without expensive modification.<br><br> We created diagnostic 3D reconstructed ultrasound images using our turkey breast tissue phantom, then directly correlated these images with digital mammography images.<br><br> We are proposing a commercial “fusion” version of this prototype which retains the technical advantages of this new 3D breast imaging system but makes practical advances based on manufacturing sophistication.<br><br> There are important advantages to the patient, reviewing radiologist, surgeon, oncologist and the Health Care System of The Matrix Probe System. These include more accurate serial tumor volume measurements to improve breast cancer treatment planning as well as substantial medical imaging cost savings.<br><br>

Expanded Polystyrene (Styrofoam) is one out of many materials which is not very friendly with nature; it isn’t biodegradable. Since polystyrene is a dangerous pollutant, taking up to one thousand years to decompose and incorporate itself into nature, solutions need to be found in order to reduce the contamination produced by this material. One of these solutions is to recycle polystyrene by using it in the construction of house roofs. Ease of dissolve polystyrene in gasoline opened the possibility to reuse this material not biodegradable. The goal of this experiment was to observe the feasibility of polystyrene wastes, paper and gasoline in the creation of a weather-proof sheet which could be used to build house roofs in the rural areas of Puebla, Mexico. The sheet was made of a mixture of 200 gr. of expanded polystyrene, 480 gr. of paper and 240 gr. of gasoline. Laboratory trials were carried out in order to evaluate the sheet’s resistance and durability. Results indicate that the sheet has a resistance of 3 tons. above a flat, and 2 tons. above a hollow area. Apart from its ecological benefit, the polystyrene roof can be very useful to control the indoor climate of houses. The new material were evidence where assessed their mechanical properties, flammability, absorption, and superficial homogeneity mainly to demonstrate its feasibility

There is also a height control of the device to level it up with the bed.<br><br>The transformation system from chair to bed or vice versa can also be used to do exercise as some movement routines can be programmed by means of its logic controller. Another advantage worth mentioning is that this chair can stand vertically improving blood circulation and preventing crusts.<br><br>After the research carried out we arrived to the conclusion that people who cannot walk by themselves and always depend on a third person or on complex machines, could lower such level of dependency by using this new technology not available in the market.<br><br>

THE PLASTIC WE WILL USE IN THE FUTURE (FROM OBTAINING BIOPLASTICS NOPAL MUCILAGE)
Xhail Pineda Gonzalez, Leonor Garcia Vicuna, 
Official Preparatory Annex to the Normal School of Teotihuacan, Colony. Nva., Teotihuacan, MEXICO

All cacti are called nopales (Opuntia tomentosa). The mucilage is a polymer composed of polysaccharides like pectins. The high concentration in some species of cactus and viscous characteristics, suggest a considerable potential as a feedstock for the production of plastic films (PP). Such membranes are materials that solidify at environment conditions and are made up of organic polymers and a plasticizer such as polyethylene glycol compound. The purpose of this study is to improve the use of this plasticizer in the preparation of a PP with mucilage from cactus and characterize their behavior. Remove the thorns, no water is liquefied and then to 3500 centrifuged rpm for 10 minutes. After mucilage is mixed with a plasticizer. Is set to dry on a Teflon drying oven at 40 º for 18 hours<br><br> The results showed that glycerol is the compound that gives the best characteristics of the PP, so it is not necessary to use high molecular weight polyethylene. The membranes obtained are relatively hygroscopic and final moisture balance with a 76% environment relative humidity is inversely proportional to the concentration of polyethylene glycol. The mechanical behavior of the films corresponds, in general, to an elongation proportional to the force applied on them to stretch to a maximum value (up to 32%), after which a break up occurs. As concentration increased, the elongation of the membranes increased and the strength to tighten it was minor (up to 0.46%). The tensile strength of films decreased as the concentration of plasticizer increases.

People who use conventional wheel chairs will take profit from a device that will facilitate their transference from the wheel chair to the bed.<br><br>Current devices such as mobile cranes or winches mounted on beds are not practical devices and therefore, after some time, are no longer used.<br><br>Our project consists in a multi-purpose wheel chair controlled by electric engines which can turn into a bed to sleep or doze off, or can be used by the sick person or user to move to his/her regular bed by means of an in-built turning system.<br><br>Both the chair and the bed can be moved by means of an electric command that can be easily handled by the user. There is also a height control of the device to level it up with the bed.<br><br>The transformation system from chair to bed or vice versa can also be used to do exercise as some movement routines can be programmed by means of its logic controller. Another advantage worth mentioning is that this chair can stand vertically improving blood circulation and preventing crusts.<br><br>After the research carried out we arrived to the conclusion that people who cannot walk by themselves and always depend on a third person or on complex machines, could lower such level of dependency by using this new technology not available in the market.<br><br>

The purpose of the present project is to increase the Qm(mechanical quality factor) value of the piezoelectric materials. Stiffness can be improved by gamma radiation exposure and this will increase the Qm value of the piezoelectric material.<br><br> <br><br>Some of the PZTs (Lead Zirconate-Titanate) were fabricated (at a electro ceramics laboratory) via mixing, drying, twice calcination and ball milling, dry pressing, sintering, electroding, drying and polarizing. The rest of the sample materials were obtained from waste lighters and these materials were gamma irradiated in exposures of 10-700 kGy. Then their capacitance, resonance and anti-resonance values were measured. The decrease of the capacitance between 4,05-16,84 percent which was observed to be directly proportional to the dosage of the radiation exposed, and the increase of the resonance and anti-resonance frequencies affect the stiffness positively which is directly proportional to the mechanical quality factor that was increased from 5,92 to 16,81 as radiation exposure was increased from 10 to 700 kGy. The tests were repeated two weeks later and the results were the same as before.<br><br> <br><br>Since the piezoelectric materials generate electricity by vibration and pressure differences, a system that was designed for the shaft bearing, placed on a motorcycle’s rim and was tested with different cycles and pressures applied to the shaft bearing. The results showed that electrical energy generated was directly proportional to the cycle number and the amount of the pressure applied.

Yarely Chiselle Davila-Vazquez, Yelitzzah Michelle Fernandez Rodriguez, 
Escuela Especializada en Bellas Artes, Humacao, PUERTO RICO

The purpose of this study was to determine, which will be the most effective polymer, Poly(ethylene) Oxide with a linear molecular structure, or Cellulose Acetate with a non-linear molecular structure, for the production of fibers adding antibiotics and using the electrospinning method. According to this statement the following hypothesis was established: The linear molecular structure polymer, Poly(ethylene) Oxide, will be more effective in the production of fibers than the polymer with a non-linear structure, Cellulose Acetate, adding antibiotics and using the electrospinning method.<br><br>The design used in this study was an experimental one. Through the electrospinning method, a high voltage was used to create an electromagnetic field between the polymer solution and the collector plate. This was done to overcome the surface tension of the drop resulting in a fine jet, of which the residue was the fibers with antibiotics added in the collector plate. The following variables were determined: dependent variable, the effective production of fibers; independent variable, types of polymer used; control variables, the amount of: polymers, solvents and antibiotic.<br><br>The data obtained and analyzed in tables, graphics and images, reflected that the hypothesis was accepted. The linear molecular structure polymer, Poly(ethylene) Oxide, was more effective in the production of fibers, than the polymer with a non-linear structure, Cellulose Acetate, adding antibiotics and using the electrospinning method. It was also concluded that when the molecular weight of the linear structure polymer, Poly(ethylene) Oxide, was increased there was a better production of fibers.

Fatih Ekrem Gulce, Onur Can, 
Izmir Fen Lisesi, Izmir, TURKEY

The production of multifunctional new materials is important for the synthesis of different functional new compounds and their polymerization, copolymerization and creation of composite using different techniques. In this study, the electrochemically synthesis of the new conducting copolymers and polymer composites based on polyaniline (PANI) that is one of topics of research in recent years and will be used in electrochromic devices was aimed. To the best of our knowledge, a study related to the electrochemically copolymerization of aniline and o-phenylenediamine in the presence of metal salts such as Cu(NO3)2 ve AgNO3, and the investigation of conductivity and electrochromic properties of this polymer composites has not been published. The homopolymers of aniline and o-phenylenediamine are synthesized and their spectroelectrochemical and electrochemical behaviors are investigated 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. For the modification of electrochromic properties of PANI, aniline was polymerized in the presence of o-phenylenediamine and metal salts such as Cu(NO3)2 or AgNO3. The presence of copolymerization is determined by comparing the voltammograms of PANI, POPD, and PANI-co-POPD in monomer free 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. Cu(NO3)2 or AgNO3 salts are increased the rate of polymerization. The polymer composites are generated in the presence of Cu(NO3)2 or AgNO3 salts. The electrochromic properties of the resulting polymers in the presence of metal salt are different than the electrochromic properties of the resulting polymers in the absence of metal salt. The metal salts finding in the polymerization media increased significantly the optical contrast that is the one of the electrochromic property performance criteria.

VERSATILE COLOR IDENTIFICATION AND LUMINANCE CONTRAST DETERMINATION USING A TRILUMINATE SOURCE
Ian Preston Cannon, Rickystan Batane Savaiko
Redeemer Baptist School, North Parramatta, New South Wales, Australia

This design project in its present prototype form, is a portable photometric instrument that determines the luminance contrast between two adjacent surfaces. The initial idea was to design and construct a color identification instrument to aid vision impaired and color blind people who constitute over 5% of the world's population. The idea was expanded to enable the instrument to retain the luminance reflectance values of two consecutive surfaces, integrate these values into an appropriate algorithm and then display the luminance contrast of these two surfaces.<br><br> The prototype is a triluminate colorimeter, using red, green and blue LED's for illumination, with a 45/0 degree geometry measuring the diffuse reflectance. It divides the RGB color palette into 729 well-defined divisions with a universally recognized color name assigned to each division. The LCD display also shows RGB, CYMK, hue, saturation and luminosity values. The prototype is battery-powered and requires no computer interfacing, unlike most expensive colorimeters and spectrophotometers.<br><br> The instrument's ability to determine the luminance contrast between two adjacent surfaces is a world first for any photometric device. National building codes specify that stairways, handrails, signage and even door handles in public accessible areas must have a specified luminance contrast to assist the vision impaired. This prototype will enable on-site measurements to be made which are presently impractical.<br><br> It has been requested of us that we develop a mathematical synopsis on luminance contrast algorithms which could become an international standard. This algorithm is used in our triluminate colorimeter.

Pharmaceutical contaminants, such as naproxen, gemfibrozil, and the anti-depressant Prozac have been found in drinking water. They pose a serious threat to human health and wildlife, as the negative effects of ingesting trace amounts of these drugs over long periods of time are still unknown. As this is a recent problem, present water purification techniques are either too costly or incapable of removing low concentrations of drugs from drinking water. This project proposes functional magnetic nanoparticles as a viable option to detect and remove these contaminants. They are only 50-500nm in diameter and thus have a large surface area to volume ratio, which allow them to bind effectively to drug molecules. Their supra-paramagnetic character allows for recapture and reuse, making this a cost-effective method. Our research focuses on the synthesis, characterization, and evaluation of these nanoparticles, using procaine hydrochloride as a model drug. Stable functional magnetic nanoparticles were successfully synthesized, and they were capable of capturing trace amounts of pharmaceutical contaminants with a 63.7% recovery rate. In addition, the nanoparticles were found to shrink at low pHs and swell at high pHs; hence they can be easily manipulated by varying the solution conditions. Once the effectiveness of these nanoparticles has been optimized, this water purification method can be used for the complete elimination of pharmaceutical contaminants in drinking water. Thus, it has the potential to significantly impact the health of society and the environment.

The main problem of the dairy products industry is the determination of the milk quality bought from suppliers who add water to the milk seeking higher profit. This addition of water to the milk may cause serious health and economic damages.<br><br> The main procedure to avoid this type of adulteration is measuring milk at its freezing point, with an equipment called cryoscopy, because there is a direct relation between the milk adulteration level and its freezing point. <br><br> However this equipment has operation and credibility limitations due to its low technological degree. Based on these facts, we developed a micro-controlled cryoscopy, joining new functions and features configured through an intuitive and functional menu, making it more efficient, adaptable and competitive. <br><br> To make this project possible, we conducted a thorough study of all the variables involved, such as: positive and negative aspects of the current equipment, theoretical basis of the topic, the main difficulties of equipment users, the technology to be used, the testing methodology and the projects’ viability. <br><br> During the development, the project was adapted several times, modifying and joining new characteristics to the equipment, always aiming to solve the existents problems. <br><br>As a result we developed a prototype that attends the proposed objective, including not foreseen characteristics like the interface with the computer and the printer and the detection of possible mistakes in the test development, which made the equipment more reliable, practical and adaptable to the real needs.<br><br>

Our objective was to develop a project that could be useful to our school. Within our main issues there was the lighting of our indoor court. <br><br> The indoor court is used for several events such as lectures, speeches, graduation and plays. We always have to change the position of the spotlights, and due to their height and position; it’s a difficult and dangerous procedure.<br><br>In order to solve this problem we developed a wireless radio control system that could control the position of the spotlights, eliminating all the risks.<br><br> Our work was divided in two parts. We developed the wireless radio control, and developed the mechanical parts. The wireless radio control consists of the transmission and the reception of signals. We used a joystick to control the four directions (up, down, left and right) for the transmission. The equipment we developed generates a binary electrical signal for each position of the joystick. This signal is sent to a decoder that generates a code and sends it to the transmitter. This transmitter modulates (ASK Digital modulation) and sends the signal trough the air carrier frequency of 433MHz. The receiving part listens and receives the signal and sends it to the decoder, which demodulates it, generating an electrical signal that goes to the power drivers. These drivers are responsible for the movement of the motors that actually move the spotlights. <br><br> The mechanical part was assembled on a metal structure, and this part consists of two motors for the vertical and horizontal controls.<br><br>

Engine dimensioning consists in an essential task to efficient use of electrical power when transforming it to mechanic work. Due to its complexity, students, and professional personnel of the area need a facilitated methodology, once its misuse causes disturbs in the deployment network.<br><br> Intending to maximize efficient use of electric power, and natural resources from which it comes, we have formulated the following hypothesis:<br><br> 1) It’s possible to help professional personnel, and enterprises in the complex task of engine dimensioning by developing an application to optimize such process.<br><br> 2) The viability of the proposed solution is testified by the simple internet access, enhanced usability, and good market acceptance, once there is no similar product comprising all the real needs.<br><br> Searching for answers, it was created SisDiMo, which helps in electric three phased engines dimensioning suitable to actuate charges, considering several criteria, start, regimes, and applications, with or without transmission system. It aggregates viability conference of the existing engine, presentation of the engines technical data by a diverse database, extended glossary, and description of technical concepts related to the subject.<br><br> Beyond the potential already highlighted, the viability of the application is comprised by its optimized segment-pioneer methodology, dynamic system easy to use, and the creation of customizable environment to each user; such aspects where highlighted as of major importance according to a pilot enterprise where the tool was implemented.<br><br>

ERGO-NET PHONE - A FULLY ADJUSTABLE PUBLIC PHONE WITH INTERNET ACCESS
Lucas Rocha Sodre, Wellington Lima Queiroz Barbosa
Colegio Santo Americo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil

In brainstorming sessions, we realized that public phones in Brazil are positioned in a predetermined height, adequate only for people of average stature. There are very few public phones for non-standard height people, dwarves, children, or wheelchair users. On the other hand, in Brazil most public phones are placed in shell-like shelters, making it very difficult for visually impaired people not to bump into them. Thus we decided to develop a fully adjustable public phone, with internet access, that can be used by people of any height, including wheelchair users. The equipment is always in the upward position, with the protective cover closed, and the shelter raised. The protective cover avoids damages due to vandalism or bad weather, whereas the retractile shelter prevents unwanted bumping. When the user steps on the frontal base of the equipment, the shelter is opened. The net phone starts to come down until the light sensor (LDR) detects an interruption of the laser beam caused by the user’s head. At this very moment, the net phone stops, matching the user’s stature. After that, the user inserts a phone card to start using the equipment. When the phone call or internet access is over, the user withdraws the phone card and the net phone returns to its original position, upwards, with the protective cover closed, and the shelter raised.<br><br> The equipment was thoroughly built with alternative materials such as bicycle parts, aluminum and iron tubes and plates. Cars’ windshield and electric windows motors were adapted to turn on the mechanical power. The control is done by the open-source interface GogoBoard, assembled by the group members, programmed with the Logo language (autonomous mode). The project relies on mobile communication network and on photovoltaic cells for capturing solar energy, and so, it does not require electricity or fixed telephone network. Thus, it can be installed even in isolated locations.

In our project we developed a set of swelling sleeves for the use of handicapped people. The purpose of the project is to help people who suffer from extreme physical disability, mental retardation and brain paralysis at high levels. <br><br>The suit we developed will help solve two of the problems these people suffer from: one of the problems is physical hypo- sensitivity or hyper- sensitivity.<br><br>The second problem is shortening of tendons. As a consequence of the inability to move the limbs, the tendons shrinking and become shorter. That prevents the joints from straightening. <br><br>Presently, these problems are treated with touch- care physiotherapy. The physiotherapists apply pressure on the patients with different accessories in order to make them sense their body limits. <br><br>The pressure sleeves we developed work on the same principles of applying pressure on the body. The suit is computerized and has obvious advantages over the current treatment: <br><br>1) The air pressure in the sleeves is controlled by sensors system, and a computer program which we invented. This allows gradual treatment, which is suited to each patient according to the necessary pressure level. <br><br>2) One physiotherapist can treat a few patients simultaneously, by using a few suits at a time. That way every patient receives more treatments, and they become more effective.<br><br>3) The treat is accompanied by visual- stimulation which works according to the sleeves’ inflation. It enlarges the quantity of stimulation, and provides enjoyable treatment. It also helps the patient to create eye- limb contact. <br><br>

THE USE OF BIOFUEL IN A GASOLINE ENGINE
Xiong Zhao, Christopher Foster
North Park Collegiate-Vocational School, Brantford Ontario, Canada

This project is a study on whether the use of biofuel as an additive in gasoline has a positive effect on the performance of a gasoline engine. Acetone was also added to the hybrid fuel above to determine whether it improves engine efficiency and fuel economy. <br><br> The biofuel was produced through transesterification of vegetable cooking oil. The process yielded methyl esters of fatty acids and glycerol. These liquid components settled into layers and were separated by decanting. The methyl ester biofuel was then washed using distilled water to remove impurities. Finally, the product was mixed with gasoline to produce the hybrid fuel. Three fuels were tested using a four stroke gasoline engine: commercial-grade gasoline, gasoline with biofuel, and gasoline/biofuel with acetone. They were compared in power output, engine exhaust emissions, and fuel consumption. <br><br> The use of biofuel in gasoline increased engine power output by 10% and lowered fuel consumption by 13%. The emission of hydrocarbons was decreased by 21%, and nitrogen oxide emission was increased by 440%. In contrast, the use of acetone within the hybrid fuel lowered engine power output by 7%. Fuel consumption was not affected, and nitrogen oxide emission was further increased by 33%. <br><br> Biofuel, as an additive, was found to be beneficial to gasoline. It increased engine power and fuel efficiency. Acetone was found to be an undesirable additive within the hybrid fuel. <br><br>

A LOW COST ELECTRONIC DEVICE FOR MONITORING THE SEEDING PROCESS EFFICIENCY
Luciano Gaspari, Marcos Federico Bosso
I.P.E.M. N° 80 "Dr. Luis Federico Leloir" - Berrotarán - Córdoba - Argentina

Goal: Designing an economic system to optimize the seeding process efficiency, which can be adjustable to any seeder, and which cost doesn't exceed 50 per cent of the cheapest one available in market.<br><br>The methodology was based on the Hypothetical-Deductive method implementing a “trial and error" sequence. The existing models were researched (costs and features) and it was probed that these models were not being used massively in Argentine due to their high cost. Observing the causes of the failures, it was decided to seed a solution for each of the outlets of the seeder. Several alternatives to the solution were development a implementing without satisfactory results. Finally an infrared modulated link was used; it works with a 2 seconds sampling time which determines a maximum seeding fail of 3.9 meters at a 4 miles/hour seeding speed. This period of time is checked by a timer, which restarts when each seed is detected. After 2 seconds without detection the seed, a sound and visual alarm is activated, indicating the tractor driver which furrow is in trouble. A control subsystem actioned by the hydraulic lever was designed so that the system works only at seeding. Conclusion: The developed system showed 100 per cent of reliability tested in the field. Its sale price was fixed in U$S 525.-, 40.3 per cent of the cost than cheapest available in Argentine. A quick amortization was also made evident.<br><br>

AN IMPROVISED ARTIFICIAL LIMB
Mihir Tandon, Riddhiman Yadava
Modern School, Vasant Vihar, New Delhi, India

A large number of disabled persons are deprived of the benefits of presently available appliances because of their inability to access them or to afford them.We have designed a simple artificial leg for above-knee amputees which is affordable as well as easily constructible even by village artisans. Our artificial leg is made from easily available material like:hollow, mild steel pipes (the kind that is used for fencing), cycle springs, foam and rexine. The cost of making our artificial leg is only Rs. 550/- i.e. US$ 11.46 (assuming 48 Rs. = 1 US$). Our Prosthesis is light and weights only about 2.5 kgs. <br><br>Our artificial limb has several features – it has a mechanical knee-joint, which consists of a hinge for unidirectional movement and three springs. The two side-springs help flex the knee with little effort and the central spring helps the knee to automatically revert back to its normal position after flexion. Our artificial limb is especially suited for children as the leg length is adjustable to accommodate changes in leg length with growth. Toes that bend like human toes have been provided with the help of a hinge on our artificial foot. This helps the user to walk more normally and also to get up after squatting on the ground. Finally, with the help of a few simple measurements of the amputee stump, the socket can be custom made for a proper fit. The socket fits the stump in such a way that there is an air cushion of one to one & half inch at the bottom of the socket. This prevents the appearance of friction sores. Also, holes have been punched in the socket to provide ventilation to the stump.<br><br>We have successfully tried our improvised leg on several human subjects both children and adults. In fact, on the very first trial, subjects who had walked only with the help of crutches for over a decade were able to use our leg comfortably. Our artificial leg allowed them to carry out the functions of walking, sitting, squatting on the floor and climbing steps with ease. With our improvised artificial leg we hope to make a difference in the lives of above-knee amputees by providing them with the mobility they have been deprived of. <br><br>

DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF AN MECANICAL ARM
Luis Rene Aponte, Jose Alberto Lozada
Colegio Radians: Box 371298 Cayey P.R., 00736

The idea of making this proyect came while doing an RC car that would do the same function: to help disabled people reach objects. But when you think about it, its harder to control than an arm and its harder to give it maintanace. The idea was discussed and it was decided to do the arm. The arm was made by doing the design using 3D Cad modeling software. The assembly of the arm consisted of the gripper's preparation, the circuit assembly and the terminations. The result was an arm easy that was used friendly and accesible to build. With it, we concluded that it is possible to build an arm with accesible materials.

A smart water irrigation system is developed to achieve exceptional water irrigation efficiency through the application of an innovative irrigation system. The developed system has two main coupled components, namely, photo electric irrigation system and frost-fighter system. This system is basically reads the weather elements (temperature, humidity, sunlight) to control its operational plans.<br><br>The idea of this project was originated based on the fact that the shortage of water in Jordan should be resolved by adopting proper irrigation systems to save water and minimize evapotranspiration rates. Since, the agriculture sector consumes alot of our limited drinking water resources. Farmers need help to keep up their business and at the same time there is a great need to save water based on the fact that our lives and the lives of next generation depend on the water we save. This dilemma dictates our brains to come up with this project.<br><br>Farmers need to upgrade their irrigation system by using the technologies of the new era. The upgraded system utilizes the use of renewable energy resources to control the operation of the irrigation system. From an engineering perspective, this project build a fully-automated irrigation system to achieve better water control, operation, and management of irrigated water, which ultimately save water as follows;<br><br>It is anticipated that the use of this low-cost smart irrigation system will save water as our first priority, provide beautiful garden, healthier plants, and less damage to crops during frost. Another benefit would be a typical saving alot on water bills.<br><br>

CETis No 156, Tijuana Baja California, Mexico

The huge increase of people in the cities and the ecologist’s nonsense are the causes to these alarming results. So we have the water average use for each habitant per day is 382 liters according to this statistics it’s been created this project. System use for help to relive the world shortage of water and like the cost of process and transportation of water to the final users. This system is utilized to control the excessive waste of water from a shower, by recycling in others services at home like the toilet. Works with an AC/DC 12 v transformer that activates one sensor and one relay which transmit AC voltage to a timer program that activate the electromagnetic valve and permit the water pass. Program the work time of the sensors for an adequate bath, when the sensor detects presents the water pass and if doesn’t detect the water pass stop. The system comes with a deposit of water wish is a fill valve and sand filter for major solids, hair and grass tramp. Using a pump to suction water from the deposit controlling by a electronic switch having lower waste of water. This system help to reduce the world shortage of water, providing to the user a system that reduces individual and global economic cost, can also control the use and water waste for children and is good for major persons and persons with problems of paralysis by controlling the time of bath and the pass of water by sensors.

STUDY OF SAFE AND COMFORTABLE ELECTRIC WHEELCHAIR THAT OVERCOMES ROAD CONDITIONS -DEVELOPMENT OF A WHEEL THAT CAN EASILY CLIMB CURBS-
Kentaro Yoshifuji, Yuki Miura ,Takeshi Hino
Nara Prefecture Oji Technical High School

The objective of our project is to develop an electric wheelchair wheel that can climb a curb that runs in the same direction of travel. Since running in the roadway is dangerous, our goal is to design a machine which can climb those curbs quickly and safely.<br><br>As the background of our project, two years ago our high school successfully developed a new wheelchair called the -WANDER- that remains horizontal on any slope with the Level Control Device. But it cannot get over a bump or curb. We achieved our goal by developing the wheel and combining it with WANDER.<br><br>Among the designs we tried, a wheel which had a spindle design and wheel with hooking device worked well, except the problem that the width of machine gets to large with the former, and that the Level Control Device could not stabilize the wheel chair because the traveling speed was too fast with the latter.<br><br>As a result of our experiments, we have come to the conclusion that a combination of the two designs would be the best one, and we designed a new wheel, called "the half-moon" type.<br><br>The prototype experiment told us that the new design could also climb the difference at a slow fixed speed, and we think it is the most suitable one. As an application, we made the new version of WANDER with the ghalf-moon wheelh.<br><br>We hope that this wheel will help wheelchair users live a comfortable and convenient life in the future.<br><br>

Ondrej Krabs, Petra Hakova
SPSSE Liberec (High School of Mechanical Engineering), Czech Republic

This project was created for transport companies to decrease the number of the not fully loaded trucks. The aim of this study was to develope a new type of the internet freight exchange that could remove the language barrier among the system operators from the different European states and create the system for both carriers and shippers.<br><br>The program was created in PHP and MySQL code and thanks to this technology the offered freights are translated to English, German and Czech languages. By using this system it is possible for any carrier to react on the shipment in the model of auction in the specific segment of time and to spare time and money for phoning. Moreover, the system is enables to link to the railway, ship or air transport. <br><br>It was established the cooperation with a big European transport companies and the net created. Afterwards the program was activated and offered to thousands of shippers who began to load their freights into the database. The system managed to reload the 2 700 trucks with 52 600 tons road freights on the railway thanks to the precreated carrier net and to decrease a pollutant emissions volume into atmosphere, which would be produced by road carriers. <br><br>Originally theoretical student project has shown to be useful even for specific needs of carriers and shippers.

Parkskolan, Vintergatan 17, Ornskoldsvik, Vasterrlands Lan, 89 36 SWEDEN

The group has in a ”simple” way designed and manufactured a well functioning model of a very complex engine type: a turbojet engine.<br><br> The turbojet engine is a type of aircraft engine that can, in a brief manner, be described in three (3) parts:<br><br>1. A turbine forces air into a combustion chamber<br><br>2. In the combustion chamber, fuel is combusted which increases the pressure in the chamber.<br><br>3. The pressure/volume-work drives another turbine that is directly linked, through a common shaft, to the first turbine.<br><br>Hence, the air intake is increased in the compression stage (1) and the combustion (2), whose exhaust is the net energy produced.<br><br>This turbojet engine is constructed from a variety of materials; everything from ordinary steel to the more exclusive material titanium. All parts are designed and constructed by the team (in both 2D and 3D blueprints), using the software Solid Works. Most of the parts are also manufactured by the team, with the exception of some titanium welding, which was outsourced for security purposes.<br><br>

Ulverston Victoria High School, Springfield Road, Ulverston. Cumbria. England. 

The project brief required us to specify, design and build an affordable and accurate digital acoustic velocimeter capable of measuring the “speed of sound in water”, which could be used by Marine Scientists and Acoustic Engineers alike. The device also needed to be commercially viable.<br><br>Existing analogue devices have obvious intrinsic limitations, such as temperature instability, calibration problems, large power consumption and handling difficulties. <br><br>A range of options were explored including mathematical modelling and Continuous Transmission Frequency Modulation.<br><br>The final solution involved the use of high speed electronic circuitry combined with a Transducer/Reflector mounting. The accuracy of the device was assisted by using low expansion super-alloys and a single pulse acoustic transmitter.<br><br>Testing produced such a consistently high degree of accuracy that the results required independent validation by more sophisticated equipment. <br><br>The current design offers potential for further refinement using more sophisticated software and advanced numerical methodology to increase accuracy by at least a further 400%. <br><br>This device offers significant potential for improving the accuracy of current sonar equipment and can be produced commercially at low cost. It is also capable of being used in a range of other applications, including salinity meters, flow meters, positioning of oil rigs at sea and fluid pressure sensors in hazardous environments. It also offers the possibility of ‘Homeland Security’ and ‘post-conflict scenario’ applications in mine-clearance.<br><br>

THE HYDROGEN ECONOMY FUTURUM NOSTRUM
Daniel Robert Femerstrom, Christopher Cheah Mollen
Ebersteinska Gymnasiet, Norrkoping and Ostergotland, Sweden

“We want to help the world.” That is a tough task for young students; “but”, we thought, “wherein lies the problem?” Not in the lack of innovative ideas, rather in the lack of knowledge among common people, among whom the power to change things really lay. The problem we addressed was: “how can we solve the energy crisis?” Our approach would be to spread the knowledge of the one solution: The Hydrogen Economy. We reduced the problem to: “How can we spread the knowledge to as many as possible?”. To reach a great audience we chose to write a book encompassing all knowledge about The Hydrogen Economy worth knowing to common people. To reach them directly we held exhibitions and lectures. To catch attention on the exhibitions we built a fuel cell powering a propeller. This missionary work never ends until we have reached The Hydrogen Economy; thus far we have written the book and held exhibitions and lectures in our school, our hometown: Norrköping, and in the capital of Sweden: Stockholm, where we have raised many eyebrows and managed to pass out the knowledge of the future to a great lot. We will exhibit in the US too, at the ISEF in Indianapolis, where we hope to find a greater audience. We believe we have done a great deal to speed up the development towards a sustainable, environmentally clean and secure future society, and will do even more if the book is released.

The project arises from the necessity from mass media for people with difficulties in the speech and motor problems. From this problem an electronic device is developed that records and reproduces words or phrases of different ways. Also to having external switch that allows the use to people with motor difficulties. Technically, it is a system made up of integrated circuits, which main component is a microcontroller of PIC family. This allows to store sounds, words or messages in memories and the stored information can be reproduced when pressing a key. Physically is constituted by a keyboard that measures 20 xs 30 centimeters, with a small box that includes an audio system whose weight makes it easily independent and transportable. The keyboard includes big bellboys, easily manageable for those people who besides to have difficulty to communicate, can suffer motor difficulties. We can say that this device fulfills the raised functions. Also arises from the investigation that the number of people with different capacities in our means reaches 10% of the population; not existing in the market a device of these characteristics. It´s possibel the use of this device in those people who suffer a temporary or definitive discapacity. <br><br>
