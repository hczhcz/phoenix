AZADIRACHTA INDICA (NEEM): APPLICATIONS OF A BIOLOGICAL SUBSTANCE
Thai Thanh Doan
Coon Rapids Senior High School, Coon Rapids, Minnesota, USA

Various extracts from Azadirachta indica (Neem), a tree found in eastern tropical countries, are known to be insecticidal and anti-septic. It was hypothesized that Neem oil and leaves would inhibit the growth of seven species of non-pathogenic bacteria. The oil would also have an insecticidal effect. The Kirby-Bauer method was used to test the non-pathogenic bacteria. Filter discs, coated with Neem oil, were positioned evenly throughout an inoculated agar lawn, incubated for 24 hours, and then measured every 24 hours thereafter for zones of inhibition -- areas of successful microbe inhibition via the oil. Due to the fact that the lipid was heavy in nature, a maximum inhibitory capacity test was devised. The oil and leaves were submerged into inoculated nutrient broth solutions for signs of inhibition via translucency differences. Results of both tests do not indicate inhibitory effects. <br><br>Approximately 100 plants each of four vegetable plant species were grown from seeds in a plant study. Healthy plants were isolated after 45 days and were treated with a light atomization of the Neem oil. After one day of treatment, the plants exhibited a corrosive, sheared appearance – an affliction which killed all the plants after 5 days.<br><br>In conclusion, Neem oil and leaves are severely limited, if not entirely suppressed as antibacterial substances, for there was not one instance where the substances inhibited the growth of any microbe. The plant study is inconclusive – the plants were adversely affected by the Neem oil and could not be subject to predation by insects.<br><br>

CAN HOYA CARNOSA SPECIES BE SEXUALLY REPRODUCED AND MAINTAINED IN FL.? IF SO, WILL THE PEST RESISTANT GENE BE PASSED ON TO THE F1 GENERATION?
CRYSTAL LYNN SWARTZFAGER
WILDWOOD HIGH SCHOOL, WILDWOOD, FLORIDA, USA

The purpose of this project is to promote genetic variation in the Hoya carnosa species through sexual reproduction, while identifying a unique trait in the Hoya carnosa that will give the breeding program direction. Can a Hoya carnosa be sexually reproduced and maintained in Florida? If so, will the pest resistant gene be passed to the F1 generation? Hoya carnosa can be sexually reproduced and maintained in Florida therefore pest resistance could be the factor responsible for this success and the pest resistance passed on to the F1 generation. <br><br>First Hoya carnosa flower reproductive organs were positively identified under a microscope. Next the insect population carried out pollination naturally. After 2-3 weeks the matured pods burst and the seeds were collected in a net pod bag. The seeds were placed on soil in an 8 inch pot, where they germinated at the following rates: set 1-90%, set 2-100%, set 3-80%. Though germination rates were high set 1-22 plants, set 2-48 plants and set 3-20 plants were tested. 92 plants were exposed, for five-weeks, to mealybug and scale. Daily observation showed no infestation of mealybug or scale. <br><br>Conclusive evidence of pest resistance was not derived from this experiment. Continued monitoring of the three sets of plants and exposure to mealybug and scale is required. Certainly research suggests that specific genetic traits, pest resistance, can be passed onto offspring, and these traits should be used to direct the breeding program. Genetic variation through sexual reproduction ensures conservation of Hoya carnosa. <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br>

ANTIBIOSIS AND TOLERANCE TO GREENBUGS, SCHIZAPHIS GRAMINUM IN SORGHUM
Curtis Justin Odgers
Wameo High School, Wamego, KS, USA

This is an investigation into the defense mechanisms of sorghum to a financially destructive pest, the greenbug. Over a four-day period known numbers of greenbus were allowed to feed in small cages on the sorghum leaves. After this amount of time they were counted to see the reproduction potential in an antibiotic variety of sorghum. Also the damaged caused by their feeding was measured. This measurement displays the tolerant traits of sorghum plants against the relatively new virulent biotypes of greenbugs. The damage was measured with a SPAD (Soil Plant Analysis Development) chlorophyll meter. The more tolerance a sorghum variety has, the lower the loss in the damaged area. The sorghum varieties tested in this experiment were Cargill 607E, Cargill 797, and NC+ 272. The Cargill 607E claims to have antibiotic traits while cargill 797 claims to have tolerant traits. NC+ 272 was used as a control because of its susceptibility to biotype K greenbug damage.<br><br> From the data collected it can be concluded that greenbugs caused a drastic amount of chlorophyll loss in all of the sorghum varieties. The tolerant variety, Cargill 797 had definite tolerant traits in the second trial. It had on average 20% more chlorophyll after the four days than the susceptible NC+ 272.<br><br> The antibiotic variety Cargill 607E held true to its claim of having antibiotic characteristics. It can be seen that at the 20-greenbug cages the variety lost some of the characteristics.

COMPARATIVE INVESTIGATION OF REPLICATION PROCESSES IN WILD-TYPE AND MUTANT STRAINS OF CABBAGE LEAF CURL VIRUS: A TWO-YEAR STUDY
Rachel Lauren Zelkowitz, Lake Brantley High School
Altamonte Springs, Fl, USA

The purpose of experimentation was to conduct an indepth comparative investigation of replication processes within the wild-type and mutant strains of Cabbage Leaf Curl Virus (CLCV). 140 mustard plants were mechanically inoculated with CLCV, 40 with the wild-type strain, 40 with the mutant strain, and 40 with a mixture of the two strains. 20 plants were left untreated to serve as controls. A time-course study was conducted in which samples were collected several times over a 21-day period. The samples were analyzed utilizing polymerase chain reaction and electrophoresis gel techniques. Experimentation yielded anomalous results in that no clear pattern of the progression of replication of the viral combinations emerged. <br><br> Two other assays were performed in an attempt to further explain and validate the initial results. The first involved mechanically inoculating zinnias (nonhost plants) with wild-type and mutant CLCV to determine if the viral DNA would still be detected. Experimentation yielded positive results, indicating that at least initially, the inoculum itself is detectable by PCR and electrophoresis gel analysis. The second phase tested the hypothesis that the area of the leaf from which a sample is taken influences the final reading. Plants were mechanically inoculated with wild-type, mutant,and mixed strains of CLCV. Samples were taken in accordance to leaf zones (determined by vein patterns) and again subjected to PCR and electrophoresis gel analysis. Results are still pending. In all cases, further experimentation is recommended in order to confirm results.

LICHENS AS BIOINDICATORS OF AIR QUALITY IN JUNEAU, ALASKA
Nellie Joy Olsen
Interior Distance Education of Alaska, Galena, Alaska, U.S.A

This project's purpose was to investigate if location relative to downtown Juneau, Alaska affected the abundance, species composition and the metal content of lichens. Research indicated that with increased distance from development lichen abundance, number of pollutant sensitive species, and tissue levels of nutrient metals would increase, while levels of pollutant metals would decrease.<br><br> The coverage of lichens and bryophytes was evaluated on the trunks of Alnus rubra in 10 sites on a transect beginning at the south end of downtown Juneau and continuing southward for 6 miles. Additionally, two samples of Platismatia glauca were gathered at mile 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6 on this transect and at an undeveloped site elsewhere in the Juneau borough. This lichen was analyzed for Ca, Mg, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Ni, and Zn by atomic absorption spectrometry.<br><br> Microenvironment greatly affected alder trunk vegetation and any effects of air pollution were undetected. Ca, a nutrient, and the pollutants Pb and Cr had significant correlations at the 99% confidence level supporting my hypothesis. Cd, Cu, Mg, and Zn did not have significant trends. Ni was elevated at mile 1 and 2 but unexpectly low at mile 0.<br><br> My results suggest a two-fold conclusion. My tissue analysis did detect increased levels of pollutant metals in the vicinity of downtown Juneau. However, the alder survey did not detect a correlation between lichen abundance and community composition and distance from development. Thus, any decrease in air quality has not drastically affected the health of these lichens.<br><br>

DOES THE COMBINATION OF CORN GLUTEN MEAL AND SUNFLOWER HULLS IN VARYING RATIOS CREATE A NEW EFFECT IN HERBICIDAL POTENCY?
Timothy Jon Guldan
Cathedral High School, New Ulm MN, USA

The purpose of this project is to attempt to enhance corn gluten meal by combining it with sunflower hulls. Corn gluten meal is a natural pre-emergent herbicide that is effective against dandelions, crabgrass and other common weed seeds. Sunflower hulls are known for stopping established growth upon their decay on the ground. An example of this is under a sunflower bird feeder. Combining these two will hopefully create an all natural herbicide with effects on both seedlings and established dandelion plants, the ultimate natural herbicide.<br><br> I combined corn gluten meal and sunflower hulls in ratios of 0:4, 1:3, 2:2, 3:1, and 4:0. I hypothesized that the ratio of 1 part corn gluten meal to 3 parts sunflower hulls would prevent the most dandelions from surviving. This was supported in the non established plots.<br><br> Unfortunately, the sunflower hulls did not effect the established plantings. Quite the contrary, it was more effective as a pre-emergent than corn gluten meal.<br><br>

CAN IMMUNITY FROM CHOLERA BE OBTAINED FROM A GENETICALLY ENGINEERED PLANT?
Tara Elise Barrett
Lincoln Park Academy Fort Pierce, FL U.S.A.

The purpose of this project was to see if mice who had taken extracts from a transgenic tobacco plant, that was genetically engineered to be immune to cholera, would become immune to the disease.<br><br> The procedure of this experiment entailed two processes. The first process was to feed the mice the extracts from the genetically engineered tobacco plant, while the the control group received extracts from a natural tobacco plant. After a week of incubation, blood samples were taken from the mice by the qualified scientist, and the ELISA procedure was conducted to test for antibody production. When antibody production was shown as positive in the mice that received the transgenic tobacco extract, the next step was put into play. In this step the mice were broken into 10 groups. Out of the 5 groups who originally received extracts from the transgenic tobacco plant, only 3 of those groups actually received the cholera toxin. Out of the 5 groups that did not receive extracts from the genetically engineered tobacco plant, 3 of those groups also received the toxin. For a week they were observed, and their food was weighed. The researcher was watching for a decrease in appetite among the mice who received the toxin, but did not have the immunization, and for their recovery.<br><br> The results of my experiment indicated that the mice who had received the transgenic plant extract were not affected by the cholera toxin as hypothesized. However, the mice that received the toxin and not the transgenic plant extract did experience a loss of appetite also as hypothesized, but recovered quickly within two days. The results show that tobacco and other plants could possibly be genetically engineered to carry immunity to a certain bacteria or virus and people could ingest its extract by some means and receive immunization, which would be much more cost-effective than the immunization methods of today.

THE EFFECTS OF SEED TREATMENTS IN TUBERIZATION OF POTATOES
Heather Renae Messick
Sargent High School, Monte Vista, CO USA

When potatoes are planted, fungicides or “seed treatments” are applied to seed pieces to protect from disease during tuberization (the process whereby the seed piece sprouts and new tubers develop.) I wondered if seed treatments not only protect from disease, but also increase tuber size, uniformity and yield. My hypothesis was that seed treatments would increase yield, size, and uniformity, and the most effective treatment would be a combination of two biological seed treatments, Kickoff and SP1.<br><br>I applied two synthetic seed treatments, Maxim MZ and 6%, and two biological seed treatments, Kickoff and SP1, plus a combination of the Kickoff and SP1, to mini-tubers of Cherry Reds, Texas Line Norkotah 278's, and Yukon Golds. After treatment, I planted the tubers in pots and placed them in a greenhouse with regulated lights and watering system. After nine weeks’ growing time, I harvested the tubers and recorded the growth.<br><br> I found that the use of seed treatments did increase tuber size and yield. The Maxim MZ was the most beneficial treatment in yield, uniformity, and size in both the Cherry Reds and the Yukon Golds. The seed treatment, 6%, was that most beneficial for the Texas Line Norkotah 278s. <br><br> If the use of a seed treatment can increase tuber yield, then a grower can conserve resources. By using a seed treatment to increase his yield, it is possible to get a larger crop with the same resources. Water could be conserved and efforts to fight the Colorado drought can be enforced. <br><br>

DETERMINATION OF PAST MERCURY LEVELS IN AIR FROM WOOD
Jennifer Nell Becnel
St. James High, St. James Louisiana, USA

To see if a correlation exists between mercury concentrations in air using biomonitors (lichens) from previous years and cork taken from tree wood during the same period. Tree cork samples were taken from sites previously used in biomonitoring and analyzed for mercury using a Bacharach 50B Mercury Analyzer System employing EPA method 7471A. Cork samples were dated using tree ring data. In addition to taking samples for the desired sample date, samples were taken from the cork for years preceding and subsequent to the desired sample date to determine whether or not variations occured throughout the entire cork. Preliminary data indicates a correlation between new mercury data obtained from tree cork samples for the time period of fall,1998-spring,1999, and mercury data obtained from an earlier study using lichens during the same time period. Many more analysis are being conducted to ensure the statistical viability of the earlier results and at present no definite conclusion can be made.

XANTHOMONAS CAMPESTRIS PV. VESICATORIA; A STUDY OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EXTRA CELLULAR MATERIAL AND HEIGHTENED HOST RESPONSE
Lauren Marie Smith, Rampart High School
8250 Lexington Drive Colorado Springs, CO 80920

Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria, a highly pathogenic bacterium, causes multiple plant diseases including bacterial spot of tomato. Extra cellular polysaccharides (EPS) have been associated with host responses triggered by bacteria such as X. campestris. Some strains of X. campestris, hrp mutants, do not cause bacterial spot of tomato. The objective of the experiment was to determine the strain for which cell free supernatant was the most effective in inducing host response in tomatoes (cultivar Agrist 761) to protect against bacterial spot caused by the pathogen. The hypothesis was that supernatant from each stain would result in fewer bacterial spots and that hrpG would be the most inhibitory of the strains. To measure effectiveness of protection against bacterial spot, mature tomatoes were exposed to the filtrated extra cellular material of hrpG, hrpE1, and wild type Xcv 75-3. A control group was exposed only to water to gauge bacterial spot disease on tomato not exposed to EPS. 24 hours after the application of supernatant, plants were inoculated with Xcv and placed in a humidifer chamber to incubate for 10 days. Data were collected through examination of randomly selected leaflets from plants representing each stain and water control. Averages were calculated for the quantity of bacterial spot for each treatment and evaluated to establish which strain of EPS was most succesful in intiating host responses and preventing disease. Data indicated that every strain of extra cellular material treatment resulted in fewer bacterial lesions, or induced host response and that hrpG was the most inhibitory of all strains. A comprehensive scientific understanding of Xanthomonas campestris and the process of naturally preventing bacterial blight would significantly alter the world enviroment.

INVESTIGATIONS OF THE FERN LIFE CYCLE AND ITS IMPLICATIONS
Arie Anne Schiller, Central Lee High School
Donnellson, IA, U.S.

The purpose of this project is to investigate the sexual stages of the fern life cycle under changing environmental conditions.<br><br> Experiment 1: Placed Ceratopteris spores in petri plates. Watched for growth then measured diameters of gametophytes. Added 0.5 ml. of nitric or sulfuric acid separately to petri plates, each with pH level of 4.5. Completed two trials (10 gametophytes per trial) for each plate containing different acids and collected data weekly.<br><br> Experiment 2: Followed same procedure, but after gametophytes developed sporophytes, counted the number of sporophytes weekly.<br><br> Experiment 3: Poured agar into petri plates. Placed fern spores onto poured plates. Ten days later, collected gametophytes and observed antheridia. Once fern sperm released, added environmental acids to sperm cells at pH levels ranging from pH 7.0 (neutral) to pH 4.0, both sulfuric and nitric acid. Measured length of time sperm swam under acidic conditions.<br><br> Experiment 4: Poured melted agar into petri plates. Placed Ceratopteris spores of one variety in center of plates. Once spores germinated, producing males, removed any hermaphrodites. Planted spores of Polka-dot hermaphroditic gametophyte variety. Gametophytes placed at distances of 1 cm - 2 cm in vertical line from earlier planted male gametophyte. Plates placed on elevated angles, inclinations ranging from horizontal to 90 degrees, at 10-degree intervals. As sporophytes developed, phenotypes recorded.<br><br> Gametophytes of ferns were affected under acidic conditions and sporophyte development did not occur under acidic conditions. Sperm viability was reduced as concentration increased. As inclinations increased, cross-fertilization decreased.<br><br>

GROWTH REGULATORS OF AGROBACTERIUM TUMEFACIENS: PHASE III
Sara Jo Weirather, 2493 Peach Orchard Rd., Montrose, IA, USA, 52639
Central Lee High School, Donnellson, IA, USA, 52625

Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a crown gall pathogen that causes the formation of large galls on infected plants, attacks plants in over sixty families. It is a soil borne bacterium that infects plants through wounds or roots. Biological control agent, Agrobacterium radiobacter strain 84, produces an antibiotic substance which slows most strains of bacteria. Tomato plants are hosts which are susceptible to most strains of bacteria.<br><br>Experiments were conducted to see which time of application of Agrobacterium radiobacter strain 84 best controlled growth of Agrobacterium tumefaciens in tomato plants. Three application times were tested: before cancer injection, at time of cancer injection, and after cancer injection. Measurements were taken every four days over a three month period. Results showed that application at time of cancer injection best controlled gall growth while application after time of cancer injection least controlled gall growth.<br><br>

A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF JUNIPERUS SPP. IN THE BIG HORN RANGE
Casey Albert Lipp
Greybull High School, Greybull, WY, USA

This research uses morphology and genetic fingerprinting to investigate junipers in the Shell Canyon area of Wyoming. This information could provide evaluations of species distribution and the extent of hybridization amongst local species. During fieldwork, it appeared there were more species of juniper than literature suggested. These were identified as distinct from known species through morphology, indicating possible expansion of certain juniper species or hybridization. One goal of this research was to identify juniper species residing in NW Wyoming. Samples were collected and morphological traits compared to known regional species. Traits included: coloration differences, leaf types, scale structures and over-all tree appearance. Each individual tree was photographed to aid in comparison. This showed morphological differences between species and determined species distribution. A second goal was to show genetic evidence of hybridization. Current research states that hybridization is possible, but there is no solid evidence to support this hypothesis. To gather evidence, a DNAeasy plant kit was used to extract DNA. Once extracted, primers were added and PCR was used to increase DNA concentration. After PCR, restriction enzymes were added to product DNA fragments for fingerprinting. This product was loaded into agarose gels and put through electrophoresis. Processed gels were stained and de-stained until banding was visible. The results of this research show a strong possibility of hybridization among juniper in the Shell Canyon area, as well as evidence of habitat expansion of species not normally associated with this region. This information should be used as a basis for additional research, perhaps finally solving the mystery that lies within the leaves of the Shell Canyon juniper.

DIAGNOSIS OF PREGNANCY IN CATTLE (PUNYAKOTI PREGNANCY TEST)
Varun Kumar Nagaraja
Sri Vani Public School, Bangalore, Karnataka, India

The project attempts to develop a simple bioassay for diagnosing pregnancy in cattle based on a unique technique practiced in ancient Egypt (ca 2200BC). Papyri recovered from excavations in Egypt during 1898 AD reveal that the pregnancy status of woman can be diagnosed by assessing the germination response of barley and wheat seeds when soaked with urine of the woman. This project explores the possibility of extending this technique to diagnose pregnancy in cattle. The urine of cows was diluted with water in 1:4 ratio. Wheat, paddy (monocots) and green gram (dicot) seeds were soaked in the diluted urine in petridishes. Seeds were also soaked in distilled water (control). It was observed that the seeds treated with diluted urine of the pregnant cow strongly inhibited in their germination and seedling growth compared to those treated with diluted urine of non-pregnant cow and water.The possible causative factors for inhibition of seeds by the urine of pregnant cow were also investigated. The urine samples of pregnant cows were found to have relatively higher concentration of urea and surprisingly of ABA- a plant hormone! It is likely that these chemicals are involved in inhibiting germination and growth of seedlings.Based on these results, a field level diagnostic kit is proposed to be of a great practical use in the rural areas of developing countries.Such a kit also helps in easily identifying the repeat-breeders and thus saves millions of dollars that is not being realized due to unavailability of simple diagnostic tools.

THE EFFECT OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD ON THE GERMINATION OF THE PHASEOLUS VULGARIS
Yamil Javier Colon
Colegio Marista, Guaynabo, Puerto Rico

This investigation studied the effect of the magnetic field on Phaseolus vulgaris' germination. The hypothesis was that the magnetic field would accelerate the process of germination in the Phaseolus vulgaris. A total of 15 Phaseolus vulgaris seeds were exposed to a static magnetic field that varies between 257G and 266G, and the results were compared with the control group, which consists of another 15 Phaseolus vulgaris seeds not exposed to the magnetic field. The temperature remained constant for both groups.<br><br> The aspects taken into account were: the length of the stem, the mass, the length of the roots, leaf quantity, time of germination, the width of the stem, and the presence of the growth hormone gibberellin. In the length of the stem the mean of the control group was 18.18cm. and the experimental group 1.7cm. In the mass of the plants, the mean of the control group was 3.42g and the experimental group was 1.57g. In the length of the roots the mean was 8.7cm. and the experimental group was 1.47cm. In leaf quantity the mean was .73 and in the experimental group was .07. In the width of the stem, the mean of the control group was .32cm and in the experimental .21cm. 80% of the control group plants germinated, and .07% of the experimental group germinated. In the presence of the Gibberellin hormone, on a scale from 1 to 10, the control group had a mean of 6.8 and the experimental group had a mean of 2. <br><br>

A TRANSGENIC SCREENING APPROACH TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ARABIDOPSIS MUTANTS DEFICIENT IN THE SYNTHESIS OF PHOSPHOENOLPYRUVATE CARBOXYLASE KINASE
Bryan Armando Lemus
Dr. Michael M. Krop Senior High School, Miami, FL, USA

This research develops an efficient way of producing a population of mutant plants deficient in the synthesis of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase kinase (PPCK), a protein kinase vital to the C4 photosynthetic process, but whose function in C3 plants is unknown. The creation of this mutant population provides a means to decipher PPCK function, since characteristics of these plants will reflect their lack of PPCK. In order for the population of plants to serve its purpose it has certain characteristics: full deficiency in the function of the gene family, the availability of a mutation marker for subsequent identification, physical stability of the mutation throughout multiple generations, and a lack of unrelated mutations. The approach taken consists of saturating the genome of a population of plants with mutations by random insertion of foreign T-DNA. The T-DNA serves as both a mutagen and a stable mutation marker. PCR and gel-blot methods were developed to screen a transformed population of 60,480 lines and to identify individual mutants. Complete mutation of the gene family was achieved through multiple genetic crosses of independently-transformed lines. Genomic Southern blots with T-DNA probes confirmed the lack of any unrelated mutations. Attempts to purify the kinase from mutant tissue showed that heterozygotes maintain the ability to synthesize PPCK, whereas homozygotes do not. Levels of malate and corresponding kinase levels were measured throughout a 24-hr period in wild type and homozygous mutant plants. PPCK/malate assays suggest that the kinase is involved in Arabidopsis in C4-like biochemistry, discarding the possibility of a vestigial presence. The created population provides a definite basis for the determination of PPCK function in C3 plants and the related evolutionary implications. In addition, the transgenic screening methods presented here provide a foundation for the effective creation of mutant populations for any gene of interest. <br><br>

A COMPARATIVE STUDY ON THE MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TRAPPING MECHANISMS OF CARNIVOROUS PLANTS
Justin Phillip Hirsch
Horace Mann School, Riverdale, New York, United States of America

Due to nutrient-deficient environs, carnivory in plants has evolved separately, several times. The Drosera (Droseraceae), Dionaea (Droseraceae), and Sarracenia (Sarraceniaceae) adapted by modifying their leaves into trapping mechanisms. These mechanisms produce extra-floral nectar, additional pigmentation, and digestive enzymes in order to attract and digest nutrient rich quarry. Scanning Electron Microscopy has revealed shared and specific features among the modified leaves. All the plants are grouped under the order of Nepenthales, implying that certain characteristics will be shared. Since the Dionaea and Drosera are in the same family, Droseraceae, their modified leaves should demonstrate having more in common with one another than either does with the Sarracenia. Characteristics shared may prove to be an advantageous adaptation and evolutionarily successful to these plants. Likewise, those features unique to plants may become obsolete. While they all catch their prey, each uses a different method of doing so. The Dionaea uses an active method with trigger hairs activating a shut mechanism while the Sarracenia has a passive mixture of hairs and hairless regions causing the victims to slip down to the eel trap region. It appears that the Drosera is a combination of both the Dionaea and the Sarracenia with a passive aggressive form of allowing the prey to get caught up in the sticky mucous and then the digestive glands actively move towards the flies to help in digestion. Accordingly, each of these species has a number of shared characteristics which will aid in the continued longevity and evolution of carnivory in plants.

RAPID VEGETATIVE PROPAGATION USING BENZYLADENINE SOLUTION
Tiffany Nichole Swann
Houston County High School, Warner Robins, Georgia, USA

Everyday gardeners as well as commercial growers need an efficient method to produce new plants from their original stock. Previous experimentation has shown misting to be a reliable method of application of the plant hormone Benzyladenine (BA). This experiment focuses on which concentration of BA produces the highest percentage increase. The hypothesis is that ramets misted with 800 parts per million (ppm) BA solution will yield the highest percentage increase. Six groups of 75 equally mature ramets of Hemerocallis cv. “Stella De Oro” were planted in a random block design. Six concentrations of BA solution, consisting of 0 ppm (control), 10 ppm, 100 ppm, 800 ppm, 1,500 ppm, and 3,000 ppm, were prepared. Two milliliters of Regulade, a surfactant used to allow absorption of BA, were added to each solution, including the control group. Solutions were stirred with magnetic mixers and stir bars for equal periods of time. Each ramet was misted with 8 mL of solution, which was adequate to wet all leaves. The plants were allowed to grow for 103 days. The number of new ramets produced was recorded. The control group increased by 13%; the 10 ppm group, 9%; the 100 ppm group, 54%; the 800 ppm group, 52%; the 1,500 ppm group, 40%; and the 3,000 ppm group, 45%. The group of ramets yielding the largest percentage increase was the 100 ppm concentration group, but it should be noted that only slightly lower results were recorded for the plants treated with 800 ppm BA.

WHAT ROOT SUPPORT MEDIA PERFORMS BEST IN THE HYDROPONIC ENVIRONMENT?
Thomas Lee Powell
Trinity Catholic High School, Ocala, FL, USA

Hydroponics is the art/science of growing plants without soil. This practice is very ancient and was used by the Natives of South America, the Egyptians, the Aztecs, and the Babylonians. Over time these great empires died out, and the knowledge of hydroponics was lost. Recently Europeans and Americans rediscovered it for use in research laboratories. More recently hydroponics has been widely adapted for food production. A review of hydroponic literature shows that little research has been done on the suitability of various media for the hydroponic system. The focus of this project is to study the effectiveness of the various media. <br><br>Procedure. The hydroponic system was constructed and stocked with pea seeds. These were placed in one of six different media (gravel, organo, bioballs, lavarock, hydroton, and styrofoam) and automatically watered. The control media was gravel because it was the superior media in the last study. Plant growth rate, crop yield, plant mass, and plant production rates were recorded.<br><br>Observations and Data. Data analysis showed gravel to be the superior growth media in terms of plant growth rate, total crop weight, plant mass, and plant production rate. Lavarock and bioballs also showed good crop yield. Organo and styrofoam were found to support unwanted algae growth. <br><br>Conclusion. While several of the media tested showed acceptable properties for hydroponic propagation, gravel showed clear superiority in the parameters examined (growth rate, crop yield, plant mass, and plant production rate). Possible reasons were discussed and future areas of inquiry suggested. <br><br> <br><br>

NATURAL OILS AS ALTERNATIVE POTATO SPROUT INHIBITORS
Dona Sarah Sharma
Sunnyside High School, Sunnyside, WA, USA.

OBJECTIVES: 1) To determine which citrus and mint oils inhibit sprouting in potatoes. 2) To determine which application method is the most effective. 3) To determine if the citrus and mint oil treatments affect the nutritional quality of potatoes.<br><br>METHODS: Grapefruit, lemon, lime, orange, tangerine, peppermint and spearmint oils were individually applied to Russet Burbank, Red and Norgold potatoes using misting, thermal aerosol and wick applications. Sprout length and weight were measured over a three-week period. Glucose was measured spectrophotometrically and starch was measured qualitatively with IKI. Treated potato sprouts were planted to observe changes in growth.<br><br>RESULTS: 1) Both citrus and mint oils inhibited sprout growth in treated potatoes. 2) Misting and thermal aerosol applications were more effective than wick application in preventing sprout growth. Only the wick application allowed sprouts to grow on the treated potatoes. All the untreated potatoes had sprout growth. 3) Treated Russet Burbanks showed the least sprout growth while sprout growth in Red potatoes was significantly higher. 4) Glucose content in the treated potatoes was generally higher than the untreated potatoes. 5) Both misted Norgolds and Russet Burbanks had qualitatively more starch than the untreated potatoes.<br><br>CONCLUSION: Misting and thermal aerosol applications of the natural oils inhibited sprouting in all three potato varieties. Lime oil was the most effective sprout inhibitor in all three varieties in the wick application but the results were not statistically significant. Sprout weight differences were not statistically significant. There was more glucose in the grapefruit-treated Russet Burbanks compared to the other varieties and the controls.<br><br>

DISPROPORTIONATE GROWTH RATES OF ROOT AND SHOOT TISSUE IN MAIZE, ZEA MAYS
Philip Christopher Redding
Cookeville High School, Cookeville, TN USA

The goal of this project was to determine if proportional growth of root and shoot tissues is isometric or allometric during early development of maize, Zea mays. Also tested were the effects of genetic variety and environmental conditions on proportional growth. Aztec and Silver Queen varieties were planted at two sites with different soil types and environmental conditions. Plants were randomly sampled from each site 7, 14, 22, 28, and 44 days after planting. Maximum lengths and wet and dry weights were measured for roots and shoots. Genetic variety did not significantly affect shoot:root proportions, but site conditions did. The relationship between shoot and root biomasses was allometric with a transition from faster shoot to faster root growth around 10 g total biomass regardless of variety or site.

IDENTIFYING QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI (QTL) ASSOCIATED WITH LEAF YELLOWING OF LOLIUM PERENNE
Emma Lucy Smith
Aberaeron comprehensive school, Wales UK

High palatability and digestibility make Lolium perenne highly valued for dairy and sheep forage systems. Plants lose their green colour through the genetically controlled process of senescence. My objective was to conduct a study into the genetic variation in green leaf retention in a population of plants extensively mapped with various genetic markers. Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) or clusters of genes influence leaf yellowing, as numerous enzymes are at work in a sequential manner during senescence. <br><br>As the plants in the study all experienced the same environment only a small proportion of the phenotypic variation could be attributed to environmental influences alone. Two experiments were conducted to collect the phenotypic data. One experiment involved the use of a Chromameter whereby numerical values relating to different parameters of colour were assigned to cut samples of grass. The SPAD meter experiment involved measuring relative chlorophyll content of leaf blades attached to different plants. By utilising software called Map QTL, the probability of linkage between leaf yellowing and a particular marker position was estimated. <br><br>Numerous QTL were found to be controlling leaf yellowing. In addition the action of the different genes involved were also established; some were found to be dominant, recessive or even heterozygous disadvantage. Such research has economic and environmental implications: from reduction in general costs to the reduced application of fertilisers. There is also opportunity for extended research: investigations into the effects of marker assisted selection of stay-green QTL to investigating the effects of different temperatures on the QTL expressed.

BREAKING SEED DORMANCY OF NATIVE WILDFLOWERS: PHASE II
Kathryn Lyn Sanford, Wilson High School
Reading, PA, USA

The approach of this study was to evaluate the effect of smoke on seed germination of Midwestern wildflowers. Prior to the intervention of man, prairie fires were a part of the natural ecosystem of the Midwestern prairies. It has been observed that increased germination frequently occurred after these fires. Using smoke to accelerate seed germination could aid in the re-establishment of prairie wildflowers and benefit growers by reducing greenhouse production time.<br><br>The seed species used in this study included: Echinacea purpurea, Echinacea pallida, Echinacea paradoxa, Echinacea tennesseensis, Ratibida pinnata, Rudbeckia subtomentosa, Rudbeckia fulgida, Liatris mucronata, Chelone oblique, and Callirhoe bushii.<br><br>Three types of smoke were tested: (1) smoke generated from burning three native Midwestern grasses, (2) Kirstenbosch® South African smoke, and (3) Wright’s Liquid Mesquite Smoke®. Fifty seeds from each seed species were soaked in the treatment solutions prepared from each type of smoke.<br><br>The Kirstenbosch® smoke showed positive results by increasing germination rates. The results for the other types of smokes depended on the concentration of the treatment solution.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF EXCRETED ANTIBIOTICS UPON PLANTS
Basil Harbi Shadfan
Keystone School, San Antonio, Texas, USA

Since the 1920's, antibiotics have been widely used all over the world. It has been found that the modern water treatment plants around America have not been completely filtering antibiotics taken and excreted by humans and livestock, and now the antibiotics are entering our water supplies.<br><br> The purpose of this project was to add amounts of quinacrine, chloroquine, metronidazole, and oxytetracycline, similar to levels found in fields receiving recycled manure and run-off water, and determine their effects upon corn, soybean, wheat, and lettuce growth. I hypothesized that plant growth would be stunted and seed production would be reduced in the presence of antibiotic laced soil.<br><br> It was expected that antibiotics have an effect upon plants. The results showed that treating the plants with a mixture of antibiotics did prove to have a negative effect on the plant size, root length, root weight, and stem weight (p<.001). The results also showed that treating the plants with individual antibiotics had a negative effect as well. Two different concentrations were used, a 10 ppt solution and a 20 ppt solution. The 10 ppt solution proved to have negative effects, limiting root growth and damaging the plants. The 20 ppt solution was similar, only more extreme. Looking at the reproductive cycle of plants with the Brassica rapas, it was shown that antibiotics do have an effect on the reproduction of plants, limiting the number of flower buds grown.<br><br> This project indicates that the pervasive use of antibiotics on humans and livestock can potentially diminish crop yield by hampering growth.

THE EFFECT OF BRADYRHIZOBIUM JAPONICUM INOCULANT ON YIELD, HEIGHT, NODULE FORMATION, AND POD COUNTS OF GLYCINE MAX
Taysha Lee Short
Millcreek- West Unity, West Unity, Ohio, USA

The purpose of the experiment was to determine whether inoculating soybeans is beneficial. The hypothesis of the experiment was that inoculated beans would produce higher yields than the non-inoculated beans and it would be worth the extra money inoculating the seed.<br><br>The experiment consisted of an acre field test plot of soybeans. Nine rows were inoculated and nine rows were non-inoculated. The inoculant was Bradyrhizobium japonicum. The pattern after the beans were planted was the first three rows were inoculated, the next six were non-inoculated, and the next six after that were inoculated, and the last three were non-inoculated. Plant height, pod growth, and nodule formation were recorded during experimentation and yield was calculated afterwards. A 7 gallon bucket was strapped in the hopper of the combine to collect the inoculated and non-inoculated beans.<br><br>The hypothesis was supported. The inoculated soybeans produced 23 bushel per acre while the non-inoculated soybeans produced only 12.5 bushel per acre. T-tests showed a significant difference between the two groups for height (p<=.002), number of pods (p<=.04), and nodule counts (p<=.04). This research shows the effectiveness of using inoculants to help farmers increase yields.

THE RATE OF INFESTATION OF PARASITOIDS (BRACON CEPHI) AND WHEAT STEM SAWFLY (CEPHUS CINTUS) ON SPRING WHEAT COMPARED TO BARLEY
Laine Frances Lybeck
Joplin-Inverness, Joplin Montana, U.S.A

Wheat stem sawfly dominates mostly spring wheat, but recently has been spotted in different types of winter wheat. When feeding on the inside of the stem the sawfly damages the phloem tissue, affecting the transfer of nutrients to the head of the plant, and leaving dark areas below nodes of ripening plants. The only natural biological control (parasitoid) reducing wheat stem sawfly is the Braconid wasps (Bracon cephi) and (Bracon lissogaster). The purpose of this research was to observe if the rate of infestation of parasitoids (Bracon cephi) and wheat stem sawfly (Cephus cinctus) on spring wheat is different compared to barley. Six fields were located for this experiment, three fields of Harrington barley, one field of Fortuna, Lew, and Hi-Line spring wheat. Four samples were taken from the west of each field, each individual stem was analyzed for no sawfly infestation, sawfly infestation, sawdust with sawfly, sawdust with out sawfly, stem cut, stem uncut, and parasitoid (wasp). No significant difference occurred between the rate of sawfly infestation in field one of Harrrington barley statistically compared to Fortuna spring wheat (p=0.550, df=6). Also there was no statistical significance between the rates of sawfly infestation of Lew spring wheat compared to Hi-Line spring wheat (p=0.006, df=6). The rate of sawfly infestation in barley is rising at the same percentage as in the spring wheat, therefore barley is not an effective control as farmers in the community thought.

PHYTOREMEDIATION OF SOLVENT CONTAMINATION USING LEMNA GIBBA
Blake Robert Wilde
Fremont High School, Plain City, UT, U.S.

A plume of solvent-contaminated water occurring during and after World War II has caused a contamination problem in the peripheral areas surrounding Hill Air Force Base. Engineers have estimated that the remediation process will take over 30 years. Hill Air Force Base is currently remediating contaminants in shallow aquifers using physical processes. There is a need for remediation processes for seeps and springs surrounding the area. Phytoremediation is the process of remediating unwanted contaminants from the biosphere using plants. Lemna gibba (duckweed), a plant known to remove contaminants in sewage lagoons in third world countries, is used in this experiment as a phytoremediatory organism. A slow-flowing maze was constructed to simulate springs, seeps, and retention ponds. Stagnant trays were used to represent ponds with no outlets. Polluted aqueous solutions containing solvents and other solvent-like chemicals were added to the slow-flowing maze and the stagnant trays. Lemna gibba was then added and left for periods of time. The aqueous solutions were monitored for changes in pollution levels. All variables were controlled at the same pollution levels as the variables. It was clear that lemna gibba phytoremediated the polluting contaminants. The difference between the control and the variable was the net remediation.

WONDER DRUG: A BROAD-SPECTRUM ANTIBIOTIC SUBSTANCE FROM SIBUKAU TREE (CAESALPINIA SAPPAN LINN.)
Eigen Israel M. Rara
Integrated Developmental School of MSU-Iligan Institute of Technology, Philippin

A broad-spectrum antibiotic substance is obtained from Sibukau tree (Caesalpinia sappan Linn.). The crude component was first extracted with pure methanol, methanol and toluene (3:1), pure water and by boiling the plant materials in water for one hour. The crude extracts from the different parts of the plant: trunk, leaves (fresh and dried), and fruits (rips and unrips) were compared as to the presence of the antibiotic substance. Results showed that the dried leaves contain the highest concentration of the active substance followed by the trunk. Methanol is the most effective extracting solvent.<br><br>Initial purification of the antibiotic substance was done by gravity column chromatography eluted step-wise with methanol:hexane. Isocratic elution followed using methanol:hexane (6:4 v/v) with silica gel as stationary phase. All fractions were monitored by thein layer chromatography. Final purification was done by HPLC. The active principle has a retention time of 12.78 minutes using a reverse phase eilica gel eluted with methanol-hexane (6:4 v/v). Active fractions revealed effective antibiotic activity against all test microorganisms (Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) showing a similar pattern of potency as that of the commercial antibiotic Streptomycin.<br><br>FT-IR spectrophotometry revealed the presence of polar groups that validates the solubility of the compound in methanol and is therefore polar. Our initial suspicion is that the active compound likely to contain a peptide-like structure.

EFFECTS OF NON-POINT SOURCE POLLUTANTS ON CONSTRUCTED COASTAL MARSH SYSTEMS
Sarah Brittany Bounds
Mercy Cross High School, Biloxi, MS, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to examine the ability of constructed marsh systems modeled after Gulf Coast marshes to filter non-point pollutants, and study the effects of non-point source pollution on the marsh environment. <br><br> An original pump and reservoir system was designed to simulate tidal flow. Twelve “mini-marshes” were constructed using mud and water from an intertidal marsh, and the marsh grass Spartina alterniflora. Prior to experimentation, the marshes were maintained for one month, allowing adaptation and algae film formation. Predetermined doses of fertilizer, animal waste, and used motor oil were then added to the marshes to simulate non-point source pollution. Quantities of pollutants were calculated based on real-life observations. Salinity, temperature, and water levels were monitored on a nearly daily basis, and visible changes in the Spartina alterniflora and biofilms were documented. Samples of reservoir water were taken immediately after treatment, ten, and twenty days. Hydrocarbon, fecal coliform, and extensive nutrient analyses were run. <br><br>Constructed marshes were proved to be an effective filter of animal waste and phosphate. The combination of chemicals in fertilizer makes it an especially dangerous pollutant because it can completely alter the marsh ecosystem, chemically and physically; levels of potentially harmful compounds actually increased in fertilizer treated marshes. Weed killer in the fertilizer appeared to inhibit normal plant function. The marsh environment least successfully filtered the motor oil. While the oil did not clearly harm the Spartina, it affected their immunity to fungus and microscopic life. <br><br> <br><br>

THE POTENCY OF BRASSICA RAPA POLLEN
Neha Chauhan
Snider High School, Fort Wayne, IN USA

The purpose of this experiment is to determine if pollen can still fertilize as well as fresh pollen after a period of time.<br><br>At the beginning of this experiment, 108 plants were planted in 6 quads with 4 compartments each. Two seeds were put into each cell to provide as a back up. These seeds were watered daily and kept under an artificial light.<br><br>Twenty-four plants were planted in intervals of one week for the next month. After about two weeks, I collected pollen from one set of the plants. I immediately pollinated two other sets of 24 plants to serve as a control. These plants were marked as Week 0. <br><br>Every week after that, I pollinated a new set of plants with the stored pollen. As the seeds were ready to be harvested, I dried the reservoir out and prepared to count my seeds. Since different numbers of plants came up, I decided to count my seeds as seeds per pod. I then took my data and analyzed it.<br><br> <br><br>First, I had a run a program that gave me a description of my statistics. This program also calculated my standard deviations. Even though they were different numerically, I had to check whether or not they were different statistically. I ran Bartlett's Test and Lavene's Test and those tests showed that my deviations were statistically the same. ANOVA was the next program run and it showed that week's data were different than any other week's.

THE EFFECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL VARIATION ON STOMATA COUNTS
Catherine Genevieve Fontana, Divine Child High School
Dearborn, MI, USA

The purpose of this experiment is to determine which canopy of an oak tree contains the most stomata in the given area of a leaf from the specific canopy. Environmental variations, such as carbon dioxide amounts and light exposure are all variables that affect the count of the potential stomata. <br><br>To conduct this experiment, obtain 100 leaves from the upper, middle, and lower canopies of an oak tree. Then, create epidermis peels from the left side of the main vein of the leaf and examine under 400x power.<br><br>There is an average stomata count of 56 stomata in the lower canopy, 69 stomata in the middle canopy, and 70 stomata found in the upper canopy.<br><br>This proves that the upper canopy’s leaves do contain more stomata in relation to the lower and middle canopies. These results can prove that the upper canopy is the healthiest canopy.<br><br>

ANOTHER SHOCKING DEVELOPMENT: THE EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENT ON THE GERMINATION AND GROWTH OF BRASSICA RAPA
Chelsey Cierra Spriggs
Renaissance High School, Detroit, MI, United States

The purpose of this project was to determine whether there is an optimum period of time that Brassica rapa can be exposed to electric current to improve the yield of plants and minimize adverse effects. Control and four variable groups of 50 seeds were examined for a period of 15 days.<br><br>Planters for each variable group received 6 volts of current generated from batteries in circuits, with lead wires buried 10cm below the surface of the soil. Variables were based on the length of time that current was supplied and determined by different expected stages of plant development: emergence of the embryonic root (24 hours, Variable 1); cotyledon emergence (3 days, Variable 2); development of the first true leaves (5 days, Variable 3); and opening of flower buds (15 days, Variable 4).<br><br><br>Plants were observed and measured daily for germination rate, development, and any anomalies in the plants. Variable 1 yielded 46 plants (92), compared to 24 plants in Control (48%); matured at a faster pace; and had 230% more flowers and 270% more axillary buds than Control. Other variable groups had germination rates in the range of 65-75%; bud and flower yields were greater than Control but lower than Variable 1. Variables 2-4 also displayed significant anomalies in height, internodal length, leaf size and shape, and mortality.<br><br>This project showed that current applied to the embryonic root could improve germination rate and flower yield in Brassica rapa. This suggests a potential benefit for agricultural yield of Brassica crops.

THE EFFECT OF SIMULATED HERBIVORY ON INFLORESCENCE, ACHENE, AND BASAL ROSETTE PRODUCTION IN BOLTONIA DECURRENS, AN ENDANGERED SPECIES
Jessica Lynn Arnold
Edwardsville High School, Edwardsville, Illinois, U.S.A.

The purpose of this project was to determine if simulated herbivory affected the production of inflorescences, achenes, and basal rosettes in Boltonia decurrens,an endangered species. Fifty bolted B. decurrens were collected in May, and planted in pots 10cm x 10cm x 35cm. One month later, twenty two pairs, were selected by height. Two plants were determined to be another species and four were damaged. These six plants were removed. One plant from each pair was used as a control. The other plants were clipped to 50% of their original height to simulate mammalian herbivory. Plants were maintained during the summer. Five inflorescences from each plant were collected and the mean number of achenes per flower was determined. The inflorescences were counted on each plant. Total achene production for each plant was calculated. Basal rosettes were also counted. Thirteen pairs of plants produced reliable data. Inflorescences in the other pairs were lost due to collection problems. The t-test for non-independent samples at a confidence level of .05 and 12 degrees of freedom (t=2.179) showed that there was no significant difference in the quantity of inflorescences, achenes or rosettes produced by the controls and the clipped plants. The simulated herbivory had neither a positive nor a negative effect. Clipping late in the plant's growing season, therefore, is not an effective technique for the propagation of this species.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF AUXINS AND ELECTICAL STIMULATION ON PLANT ROOT GROWTH IN THE PRESENCE OF GRAVITY
Kavita Vasant Betkerur
Hoover High School, Canton OH, Stark County

Auxin is a plant hormone that allows roots to grow downward with gravity; a process known as gravitropism. Naturally, the root creates electrical potentials because of the fluxes of ions through the membrane. An outside electrical field causes changes in the surface potentials, which causes the root to grow against gravity. The problem that is being tested is the effect of auxins and electrical stimulation on root growth in the presence of gravity. The hypothesis is that there will be more curvature against gravity when both factors are affecting the root. <br><br> In order to make this comparison, there are four setups containing a root submerged in water for an observation period of twenty-four hours. The setups are as follows: control growth of root, root treated with auxins, root stimulated with an electrical field, and one pretreated with auxins and then electrically stimulated. The experiment will be measured by the degree of curvature and length of growth. The root in the electrical field showed significant curvature against gravity and the auxin treated roots had minimal curvature against gravity. When both electrical fields and auxins are applied to the root, the roots had minimal curvature against gravity. This leads to the possible conclusion that the electrical fields stimulate the auxins and cause them to be distributed symmetrically in order to achieve straight growth. The importance of the project is to establish as to which factors are responsible for the roots response to gravity. <br><br>

EFFECTS OF CORN STEEP LIQUOR ON WEED SEED GERMINATION
Jennifer Elizabeth Goedhart
Unity Christian High School, Orange City Iowa, USA

This project was designed initially to answer the question of whether corn steep liquor (CSL) would prevent weed seeds from germinating. Further experimentation led to testing its effects on grass growth. Three main experiments were used to answer the above questions. In the first experiment spotted spurge was grown on agar with corn steep liquor added at concentrations from 0 to 40 percent. This experiment was unsuccessful because no spurge germinated at any concentration. In the second experiment, the germination of redroot pigweed and crabgrass sown on filter paper saturated with concentrations of CSL varying from 0 to 33 percent was tested. Increasing concentrations resulted in 100 percent inhibition of seed germination and seedling growth. Seedling growth was more sensitive than germination in pigweed, with an 86 percent reduction in seedling growth at 3.3 percent CSL. The CSL effect on the germination of wild radish and buckhorn plantain could not be determined because of the low germination at all CSL concentrations. The third experiment tested the effect of CSL on established perennial ryegrass regrowth. Increasing the concentration from 0 to 400 grams per square meter resulted in a 17 percent increase in dry matter produced after three weeks. In conclusion, since the CSL both inhibited weed seed germination and increased grass growth, this inexpensive and locally available product may serve as an environmentally friendly and valuable part of a weed and feed program for turf.

BURNING BRUSH: AN URBAN DILEMMA...AN AGRICULTURAL OPPORTUNITY
Kate Elizabeth Klinkerman
Memorial High School, Victoria, TX, United States

There is a continuous need to dispose of the brush in Victoria County. There are already 400,000 cubic yards of brush piles that have accumulated. The hypothesis for this project was that if brush is collected at an agricultural location and burned, then the quality of the soil will be improved. To test this hypothesis, an experiment consisting of four different treatments was designed. These were actual burning on site, application of ashes, a comparison to a standard fertilizer rate, and a control site with no treatment. Each treatment being tested was replicated three times to validate any results drawn. A 15 by 20 foot site was staked off and twelve smaller plots were mapped out using string, each site measuring 5 feet by 5 feet. An initial soil sample was taken to establish a base. Wood was burned for the on site burning and ashes plots, fertilizer was spread on the fertilizer site, and seed was planted on all twelve plots. Four weeks after planting, more soil samples were taken from each plot and sent for testing to see if there was any effect. These results showed that the burning brush on site treatment and the ashes treatment did improve the soil by statistically increasing 5 macro nutrients - nutrients that all plants require to grow. While this is beneficial to slightly acidic and highly acidic soils, both of these treatments can also be detrimental to the soil by increasing the alkalinity on neutral and high pH soils.

A TAXONOMIC REASSESSMENT OF THE PHAEOPHYCEAEN (BROWN ALGAE) ORDERS ECTOCARPALES AND SCYTOSIPHONALES BASED ON RIBOSOMAL SMALL SUBUNIT (18S) DNA SEQUENCES
Sudeep Banerjee
Clovis West High School, Fresno California, USA

Evolutionary relationships within the Class Phaeophyceae (brown algae) have long been a source of discussion and speculation. Previously the Orders Ectocarpales and Scytosiphonales had been defined as sister orders, however recent analysis of the Order Scytosiphonales nullified its existence and grouped these species within the larger Order Ectocarpales. This taxonomic hypothesis has been put forth with limited taxon sampling. Due to apparent morphological differences and molecular data based research, I predict that sufficient speciation has occurred so that Scytosiphonales is monophyletic and sister to the Ectocarpales. After selecting a set of morphologically diverse species for the Orders Scytosiphonales and Ectocarpales, I chose Laminariales as outgroup set based on taxonomic divergence. After undergoing DNA isolation, purification with Phase Lock Gel, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), PCR Purification, Cycle Sequencing, Cycle Sequence Reaction Purification, lyophilizing and finally sequencing I obtained DNA sequence of two species, other taxa was collected from GenBank. The data was analyzed and presented using parsimony and maximum likelihood. Although the species from Order Scytosiphonales formed their own clade, they were not independently monophyletic of the entire Order Ectocarpales, disproving my hypothesis. This experiment based on the 18S SSU strongly suggests the nonexistence of the Order Scytosiphonales. Because previous studies, based on alternate DNA regions, have indicated that sufficient speciation had occurred, perhaps the level of conservation on the small subunit is too great to make valid analysis of this ordinal divergence. The original tree which separated Order Scytosiphonales and Ectocarpales based on morphological differences is also nullified based on this experiment.

EFFECTS OF ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS ON PLANT HEIGHT
Bridger Westcott Bach
Park City High School, Park City, UT, USA

This experiment was done to determine if electromagnetic energy would effect plant heights. I made three electromagnets by wrapping 32awg magnetic wire around three ten pound iron rods and wired them to a 3.6 amp 24 volt dc current power supply. The number of wire wraps around each rod determined the varying intensity of EMFs. I have a 2 wrap, 1 wrap and a 1/2 wrap electromagnet. I germinated radish seeds and planted the sprouts in thirty-two 4 cm ceramic pots. Eight plants were placed on four glass plates and place on the three magnets and one control rod. The plants were placed under 2 GE 48 inch wide spectrum grow lights for 15 days and I measured plant height daily at 6:00pm. The plants were watered from the bottom daily. I unplugged the light to simulate night and day and recorded their height in centimeters while observing the stems and leaves for any differences.<br><br> At the end of fifteen days, the average plant heights were very close. The growth rate of the plants on the 2 wrap magnet was minimally higher.<br><br> Through research and this experiment, I have learned many things about plants, electromagnets and the effects EMFs have on plants. If I had to draw a conclusion, I would say that the plant height differences between the plants over the control rod and those grown over the magnets were not significant enough to draw any meaningful conclusions

NATURAL SUBSTITUTES FOR PH INDICATORS THAT UTILIZE THE POWER OF ANTHOCYANINS
Arjun Gopalratnam
Charter School of Wilmington, Wilmington, Delaware, United States of America

The purpose of this project is to find substances that are environmentally safe and that can serve as better pH indicators of titration points than phenolphthalein. Natural substitutes found through experimentation will help the environment by promoting the “green movement”.<br><br> Solutions of different pH levels are placed in the columns, and extracts of possible indicators are placed in the rows of well plates. Natural indicators are deemed to be successful when there is a distinct change in color between acids and bases. Well-performing indicators are further tested in solutions of every pH level from 7 to 14 to examine more precise color changes. Also, different parts of plants are tested to see if indicator components only exist in certain segments (i.e. skin, flesh, leaves).<br><br> The leading contributors to the success of natural indicators are the anthocyanin pigments in plant cells. Anthocyanins are the molecules in a plant that contribute to its color and are affected by varying pH levels, as discovered in this project.<br><br> This experiment is successful in proving the hypothesis, as it shows that many natural substances can determine whether a solution is acidic or basic. Some indicators can even clearly differentiate between various basic pH levels. It is also shown that anthocyanins play a significant role in the substance’s ability to identify acid from base and are often more accurate than phenolphthalein. These indicators cost significantly less and are also environmentally friendlier than phenolphthalein, a known carcinogen. These factors make the use of natural pH indicators more attractive for school and industry use.<br><br>

This experiment determined whether Clonex Cloning Gel, Olivia's Cloning Gel, or Doc's Cloning Gel stimulated through distilled water and moist sand will create a clone of a kalanchoe, carrot, or snake plant cutting. It compares the effectiveness of the three gels, while comparing which plant produces the most clones when grown in plant root stimulants. It also tries to determine whether distilled water or moist sand will provide a better growth medium for the cuttings.<br><br> My experiment involved twenty-seven petri-dishes. Each petri-dish was an environment for three plants, covered in a cloning gel, rooting in a growth medium. First, I cut twenty-seven small snake plant and kalanchoe cuttings with a scalpel. With a borer, I cut the core of a carrot out, which was cut into twenty-seven one-inch pieces. Nine carrots were dipped into Clonex, Olivia's, and Doc's Cloning Gels. Nine snake plant pieces were dipped into the three gels, as well as nine kalanchoe pieces. Three carrots that were dipped in Clonex gel were submerged into water, three into gel, and three into moist sand. I repeated this process with all of the cuttings. Each cutting was submerged into a growth medium and held in a 20 mL petri-dish, which was held in a 100 mL petri-dish. The larger petri-dishes held approximately 2 mL of water, excluding the cuttings submerged into the sand. The cuttings submerged into the water and cloning gels were stored in an incubator set at 30°F. The other cuttings were stored underneath a large lamp. Once the cuttings rooted, the pieces were moved to a pot, surrounded by potting soil, and given water daily.<br><br> In conclusion, Olivia's Cloning Gel produced the most plant pieces, the kalanchoe plant was the easiest to clone, and the sand provided a better growth medium.

HOW CHILLING TIMES AND AUXIN APPLICATIONS AFFECT ROOT INITIATION OF CRANBERRY CUTTINGS?
Katie Bartula
Plymouth North High School, Plymouth, MA, USA

Cranberries (Vaccinium marcrocapron Ait.) go through a dormant period from October through early May. It was hypothesized that cranberry cuttings exposed to a greater amount of chilling time and uxin rooting hormone that contains IBA (Indolebutyric Acid) would produce a greater number of roots more quicly than the control cuttings. It was also hypothesized that application of a second rooting hormone, NAA (Naphthalene Acid) would produce a greater number of roots more quickly than the control cuttings but the measurement of root weight would be larger than the IBA group.<br><br>Cranberry cuttings were removed from a commercial bed immediately following harvest. They were then subjected to chilling times of 0, 2,4,6, and 8 weeks at 3 degrees Celsius, and were planted with either NAA, IBA, or no (control) rooting hormone. These results suggest that cranberry growers can start their bogs earlier in the season to increase the number and quantity of roots and improve the uniformity of rooting.

THE MEDICINAL EFFECTS OF DEVIL’S CLUB, OPLOPANAX HORRIDUM
Brittany Noel Hales
Polaris K-12, Anchorage, Alaska, U.S.

The medicinal effects of devil’s club were researched and examined. Devil’s club is a member of the ginseng family, Araliaceae, and ginseng is known to have medicinal uses. I hypothesized that devil’s club would exhibit antibiotic properties. I tested devil’s club infusions, decoctions, tinctures, and extracts of both root and inner bark against known antibiotics (Tetracycline, Streptomycin, Gentamicin, Chloramphenicol, Kanamycin, Vancomycin, and Naladixic Acid) in nutrient agar plates inoculated with nonpathogenic Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus. I measured the zones of inhibition that formed around sterile disks soaked with the devil’s club preparations. The zones of inhibition of the antibiotic sensitivity disks were also measured. None of the devil’s club preparations had an affect on E. coli, but the decoctions, tinctures, and extracts inhibited the growth of B. cereus. All of the antibiotics had an effect on both types of bacteria, except for Vancomycin, which didn’t have any affect on E. coli. The devil’s club inner bark tincture showed the largest average zone of inhibition for B. cereus (8.19 mm). My results show that devil’s club does exhibit antibiotic properties.

THE ALLIUM GENUS AS A BIOLOGICAL CONTROL (YEAR THREE)
Michael Thomas Jacobsen, Laurel-Concord High School
Laurel, Nebraska, USA

The Allium genus (garlic and onions) has long been known as having therapeutic effects. This researcher analyzed these effects in a high school research lab. Specifically, microbiological and entomological effects of extracts from the genus were analyzed. <br><br>For this year’s research, the chemistry and the insect repellant abilities of garlic were investigated. For the chemistry investigations, separation of the garlic compounds was achieved with a thin-layer chromatography stationary phase and a WD-40 mobile phase. Furthermore, alternative extracts, steam-distilled and oil extracted, were shown to have antibacterial effects.<br><br>For the insect repellant investigations, two key organisms were studied. First, the Bean Leaf Beetle, a significant Nebraska soybean defoliator, was studied. Soybeans were sprayed and data was recorded on BLB defoliation prevention. Second, the Cabbage Butterfly, an organism dependent on the fast plant Brassica rapa, was studied. Cabbage butterfly oviposition (egg-laying) prevention was researched. Oviposition measurement was achieved by using spray procedures, and then counting the eggs deposited. <br><br>The therapeutic effects of the Allium genus shown here and in the literature make isolation of the key compounds important. In economically frugal situations, these procedures may be useful for those wanting to study this genus. Additionally, this genus may have importance in pest management as an insect repellant.<br><br>

PLANTS WITH A PURPOSE - THE ROLE OF PHYTOREMEDIATION ON NON-POINT SOURCE GLYCOL AND HYDROCARBON POLLUTION IN JEFFERSON PARISH CANAL BOTTOMS
Elizabeth Anne Lopez
East Jefferson High School, Metairie LA, USA

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects that plants in Jefferson Parish drainage canals have in water purification by removing glycol (anti-freeze) and refined lube oil pollution through the process of phytoremediation.<br><br>This project focused on automotive nonpoint source (NPS) pollution in urbanized areas that travels into storm drainage canals, and how natural processes, such as phytoremediation, may help reduce pollution. Originally this project began as an attempt to find and identify NPS contamination caused by draining / leaking antifreeze and used lube oil from neighborhood vehicles. After three trials, the local canal water was found to be surprisingly void of detectable glycol / hydrocarbon contamination. After some study, it became apparent that there were processes in action that were aiding in the removal of contaminates from the canal water. These processes included dilution, evaporation, degradation from weathering, biodegradation from bacterial action, and phytoremediation from plant life. <br><br>The procedure used in this study involved “harvesting” canal bottom plants and then introducing water spiked with known concentrations of oil and glycol added into their systems. After 5 days, 100ml was drained and the oil and glycol concentrations were determined. Loss of contaminates was attributed to phytoremediation. Tests were run in triplicate, with one plant and soil control, and one water spike control.<br><br>

THE PRODUCTION, PURIFICATION, AND REBINDING OF THE EXTRINSIC PROTEINS TO PHOTOSYSTEM II
Jessie R. Azure
Rolette High School, Rolette, North Dakota, United States

Photosynthesis is the process in which light energy from the sun and water undergo chemical reactions to produce glucose and oxygen. The extrinsic proteins of photosystem II are extremely important to oxygen evolution in the photosynthetic cycle. By gaining an understanding to this process by studying and experimenting with these proteins, it is desired to gain structural and functional data. In this project, photosystem II from Chlamydomonas reinharditti and Escherichia coli were purified and manipulated to produce the extrinsic proteins linked to photosystem II. The cells were grown, harvested, and run through a column to extract photosystem II and the extrinsic proteins. Photosystem II was then later washed to remove the extrinsic proteins. The extrinsic proteins grown in E. coli cells were then rebound to photosystem II. SDS-PAGE gels were conducted to confirm the presence of the proper proteins. Preliminary oxygen assays showed photosystem II with removed proteins had lower oxygen rates than photosystems with extrinsic proteins fully intact. Oxygen production assays also indicated that attempts to rebind the purified and produced proteins proved to be unsuccessful. In the future, research will hopefully lead to the successful rebinding of the extrinsic proteins to photosystem II. It will also include further study of the extrinsic proteins gaining structural, as well as mechanistic data by finding which amino acids are involved in oxygen production.<br><br>

THE INTERACTIVE EFFECTS OF SOIL NUTRIENTS, NATURAL FERTILIZER, AND SULFENTRAZONE ON THE GROWTH AND MATURATION OF TRITICUM AESTIVUM AND BRASSICA KABER - PHASE 6
Adam Richard Wohl, Minot High School - Magic City Campus
Minot, ND, United States of America

This study was conducted using a 2x3x4 design. There were two field soil conditions: balanced soil and nutrient-deficient soil; and three seeding conditions: noncompetition, intra-species competition, and inter-species competition. Additionally, four soil treatments were applied: control, natural fertilizer, sulfentrazone herbicide, and a combination of fertilizer and herbicide. Natural fertilizer amounts were based on nitrogen analysis of the manure and soil. There were a total of five replicates of each condition in two runs, which were over-planted with wheat and vernalized wild mustard seeds, then thinned to ensure the desired ratio. Each run was conducted for seven weeks, with log notations on plant growth and environmental conditions. Maximum available natural light was provided to the plants, supplemented daily using grow lights. The plants were watered every fourth day through sub-irrigation for one hour, with additional moisture given to the soil surface, if needed. After the study, the plants were photographed and staged, heights were recorded, and biomasses were obtained. Wheat maturation was greater in balanced soil conditions. Both types of competition negatively affected plant growth, but the effect was more notable in the intra-species competition. The fertilizer plus herbicide combination treatment increased wheat growth in the nutrient-deficient soil (compared to the control condition), thus indicating the positive effects of additional nutrients and limited competition. Wild mustard growth was significantly hindered by the herbicide. Statistical analysis with the F-value, t-test, ANOVA, and MANOVA tests on the SAS and SPSS Systems confirmed these results (confidence level 95%).

HOW DO FERTILIZED FIELD PEAS AFFECT THE POST SEEDED WHEAT CROP?
Drew Larson
Mott, Regent High School, Mott, North Dakota, USA

Field peas is a legume crop that fixates nitrogen. The plant lives in symbiosis with nitrogen fixing bacteria. The crop is beginning to be used in rotation with wheat for advantage of fertility in Southwest North Dakota.<br><br>I was curious to find out how the fertilized field peas affected the outcome of the post seeded wheat crop. Did fertilization make more or less nitrogen podding on the peas? If so, what was the outcome in the post seeded wheat crop?<br><br>I started a continuation project by fertilizing and seeding Gunner Wheat in the field pea test plots. The crop was sprayed and then harvested and four samples were taken from each of the four filed pea test plots. The samples were analyzed at our local elevator and also sent to North Dakota State University, Department of Cereal Science. I was able to find which plot was the most economical due to greater protein levels and higher milling qualities.<br><br>After analyzing my data, my conclusion and my hypothesis were the same. My gain in fertilization came not in the field pea crop, but in the post seeded wheat crop. With plot one fertilized with 11-52-0, my pea plant’s fixation raised the available nitrogen in the soil, therefore increasing the wheat’s protein level. Due to the higher protein content of the wheat, higher loaf volume, lower ash content, and better milling qualities were recorded.<br><br>

DEVELOPMENT OF A SALINE TOLERANT SAFFLOWER BY APPLYING A NEWLY FORMULATED IN-VITRO METHODOLOGY
Brian Lee Fisher
Mandan High School, Mandan, ND, USA

This experimentation will create a saline tolerant Safflower plant through the use of plant cell culturing. Since plant cell culturing is very specific for not only every species but also every cultivar, an effective methodology needed to be established for the cultivar used in this experiment. This methodology for culturing this cultivar of safflower was formulated through the research of different types of cell culturing. The plant tissue culture methodology for plant germination, regeneration, and selecting of the saline tolerant cells has already been performed. Therefore the methodology that needed to be defined was for shoot proliferation and root initiation. The methodology that was found would then be applied to creating the saline tolerant Safflower. <br><br>After testing methods of shoot formation and root initiation, it was observed that the elongation media for shoot formation had a negative effect on the callus. It was concluded that the callus should be cultured on rooting media where it will form shoots and roots. This method for rooting then became part of the methodology for culturing. This method can be used to create the saline tolerant Safflower through successfully selecting for the saline tolerant cells and rooting them into a plant. <br><br> This experiment made extraordinary accomplishments not only in creating a newly formulated methodology but also in rooting a plantlet. Since this plantlet has developed roots, it can be transferred to soil and will mature into a saline tolerant Safflower that can grow in saline seeps effectively. <br><br>

THE EFFECT OF CUPROUS OXIDE CONCENTRATIONS IN BOTTOM BOAT PAINT ON HYDRILLA VERTICILLATA’S STEM LENGTH, COLOR, ROOT LENGTH, AND NEW STEM GROWTH
Thomas Hampton Freeman
Spring Valley High School, Columbia, South Carolina, United States of America

The purpose of this research was to find the effect of cuprous oxide concentrations on the height, color, and root length of Hydrilla verticillata. Since the 1960’s, hydrilla an aquatic weed, has invaded lakes, rivers, and ponds by congesting the area. It was hypothesized that differing concentrations of cuprous oxide would have differential effects on the condition of the hydrilla. Four ten gallon tanks , which were assigned a specific cuprous oxide concentration (0%, 39%, 42%, 66.5%), were divided into four separate testing areas, and ten hydrilla stalks were planted in each area. Planks of wood painted with boat paints containing the various concentrations of cuprous oxide were placed in the aquariums. The planks of wood were left alone to float in testing areas for a period of 35 days with observations made weekly. It was found that height was unaffected. Initial stalks from all testing areas changed from green to brown or black. Root length in the control and 39% were significantly longer than that of the 42% and 66.5% groups at the 95% confidence level. Also, amount of new growth was significantly greater in the control and 39% groups compared to that of the 42% and 66.5% groups at the 95% confidence level.

ANALYSIS OF A POSSIBLE APHID TOXIN IN ZUUIKI TARO (COLOCASIA GIGANTEA), YEAR 3: CONTINUED TOXIN ISOLATION AND PROGENY TESTING FOR TRAIT-TRANSFERENCE ...
Richard Jean Rodrick
Kapaa High School, Kapaa, Hawaii, USA

The purpose of this study was to attempt to isolate the substance in Zuuiki taro responsible for aphid resistance and to analyze two progenies from a successful C. esculenta x C. gigantea cross for the transfer of the anti-aphid trait from the Zuuiki parent.<br><br> For the hybrid testing, five hulis (vegetative stock) each of Bunlong, Zuuiki, (C. esculenta x C. gigantea) #1 and (C. esculenta x C. gigantea) #2 were planted in individual 6” pots and allowed to grow for four months. Bunlong host plants were also planted and infested with aphids. After 4 month, stems from each of the four plant types were cut and placed among the infested Bunlong plants. Aphids were allowed to migrate onto the test stems for one week. After such time, aphid infestation levels were recorded and analyzed.<br><br> For the toxin isolation a crude Zuuiki extract was made then subjected to TLC. Using a solvent combination of 25mL Chloroform, 5mL Methane and 0.3mL Acetic Acid, 3 distinct fractions were obtained. Fraction solutions were then brushed onto Bunlong stems and placed amongst the aphid infested plants. Aphids were then allowed to migrate onto the test stems.<br><br> Based on the data collected it was shown that both of the hybrids are significantly more aphid resistant than the Bunlong. Also, the hybrids exhibited the same degree of aphid resistance as their parent, Zuuiki. For the toxin isolation, it was found that, although there was an apparent difference between the fractions, there was no statistically significant difference between the fractions. However, each fraction was significantly different from the control.<br><br> <br><br>

MINERAL UPTAKE AND ACCUMULATION IN LOWLAND TARO (C. ESCULENTA V. MAUI LEHUA) AS AFFECTED BY ELEVATED LEVELS OF COPPER SULFATE -- YEAR 3 STUDY
Whitney Takeo Haraguchi
Kapa'a High School, Kapa'a, Hawaii USA

The purpose of this project was to find out two possible effects of copper sulfate on treated lowland taro: 1) will elevated but non-toxic levels of copper sulfate in the water increase copper concentration in the taro leaves; and 2) will elevated copper levels affect the uptake of other micronutrients.<br><br> Top-cuttings (hulis) were planted in pots filled with perlite and placed in 5 gallon buckets with water to simulate lowland conditions. The plants were allowed to grow for 2 months while being fertilized every 2 weeks. After 2 months, the plants were then transferred to buckets filled with 8 liters of water. Half of these were given the copper treatment of 250 ppm while the other half were left untreated as the control. Plants were allowed to grow for 4 weeks. After 1 week, leaves were harvested and flown to UH-CTAHR at the Agricultural Diagnostics Service Center, in Honolulu.<br><br> Concentrations of copper, calcium, potassium, magnesium, manganese, iron, boron, phosphorus, sodium and zinc were determined via Inductively Coupled Plasma/Atomic Emissions Spectroscopy (ICP/AES) using an Atom Scan 16 with an automated robotic sampling system and Thermo-SPEC Sequential Analysis software. Tissue analyses were repeated 4 weeks after treatment.<br><br> Based on the results, the first hypothesis was proven correct, as the first week’s data showed elevated copper content in the taro leaf tissue samples. However, after 4 weeks, the copper content in the taro plants dropped to normal levels which indicate that the plants stabilize in time. The opposite of the second hypothesis was observed, with elevated levels of all minerals except calcium in the leaf tissue samples from the plants treated with copper sulfate. Again, however after 4 weeks, all mineral content in the leaves dropped to normal levels.<br><br>

DO NEGATIVE IONS AFFECT PLANT GROWTH AND NUTRIENTS?
Rachael Ann Scott, NWMHEA
Senatobia, MS USA

The purpose of this investigation was to prove that negative ions cause plants to have more iron and increased metabolism; therefore the plants grow more rapidly than plants grown without the ionizer. It's a method of growing plants more efficiently.<br><br>I exchanged rooms from last year. I planted 16 cucumber and 16 pepper seeds on May 1, 2002, in two separate south facing rooms near a window. They received the same amount of water and sunlight. Only one room had a negative ionizer. I checked them daily and made notes of any changes. <br><br>The seeds beside the negative ionizer germinated only 2 1/2 days before the seeds without it. The cucumber plants beside the ionizer appeared healthier, flowered and produced fruit 3 weeks earlier than the cucumber plants grown without it. Some plants without the ionizer died before they flowered. <br><br>I then planted 4 kale plants. I put 2 in each room. The ones beside the negative ionizer grew bigger and firmer. The kale grown beside the negative ionizer had a higher content of iron, which resulted due to the increase of electrons in the air for the plant to absorb. Photosystem II had more electrons to produce ATP and NADPH.<br><br>This investigation shows that the negative ionizer increased iron uptake and metabolism in the plants.

FRACTAL NATURE OF PLANT VASCULAR SYSTEMS
Kathleen Suzanne Hanson
Clear Brook High School, Friendswood, TX, USA

Fractal analysis can be used to optimize crop genotypes in soils where nutrients and water are scarce. Plant lines with high root fractal dimensions, indicating extensive branching and an increased ability to thrive, are bred further and productivity is increased.<br><br>The purpose of this experiment was to find if the root systems of Phaseolus lunatus (lima bean) plants are fractal in nature and how the plants and their fractal nature are influenced by changes in availability of fertilizer and water.<br><br>Experimentation was conducted by growing lima bean plants under varying water and fertilizer regimes. After three weeks the plant root systems were examined and analyzed to find their fractal dimensions and properties.<br><br>The number of roots present increased with decreasing water availability, showing that when resources are restricted, plants produce more roots to extend into their surroundings and obtain the necessary water. Root diameter also decreased with decreasing water, thus increasing the surface area to volume ratio of the roots and allowing for increased external area for water intake.<br><br>Phaseolus lunatus roots were found to exhibit a fractal structure. Resulting fractal dimensions generally ranged from 1.42 to 1.62, agreeing with previous research of crop root systems. The fractal dimensions of the roots increased with decreasing water availability, supporting the idea that plants produce roots with higher fractal dimensions in response to decreased water to maximize resource intake efficiency. The fertilizer amounts used in this project created no significant difference in the plants or their fractal dimensions.

PROTEOLYTIC ENZYME PRODUCTION IN THE INSECTIVOROUS PLANT SUNDEW (DROSERA ADALAE) IN RESPONSE TO PREY STIMULATION
Samuel James Asarnow, Oregon Episcopal School
Portland, Oregon, USA 

Insectivorous plants, including the sundew, Drosera adalae, have come under study because of the unique ways in which they have adapted to the marshy, nutrient-poor environment in which they live. These plants trap insects on their leaves, digesting them with a proteolytic enzyme, and using the proteins in the insects to supplement the nutrients in the soil. This experiment attempted to determine whether the proteolytic enzyme is stored in the sundew’s leaf or produced only after the sundew captures an insect. A fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) was placed on a leaf and the leaf was removed from the plant after 0, 24, 48, 72, 96 or 144 hours. The enzymes were extracted from the leaf, and a piece of filter paper containing the enzymes was placed on a petri dish containing a milk-protein jelly (the proteolytic enzyme digests the protein in the jelly, changing the jelly’s color slightly). After 24 hours, the ring of color change around the filter paper was measured, and the ring’s area calculated. The total areas were compared using t-tests, and it was determined that the amount of enzyme present in the leaf increases until the fly has been on the leaf for around 48 hours. After the fly has been on the leaf for 48 hours, the enzyme level remains constant until it has been on the leaf for 144 hours, which was the longest period of time tested.

THE EFFECT OF GROWTH RATE ON THE COMPETITIVE SUCCESS OF EPIPHYTIC CRUSTOSE LICHENS
Christa Ruth von Behren
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland, OR, USA

Epiphytic crustose lichens compete with each other for space and resources. It has been suggested that the growth rate of a lichen thallus could affect its competitive success. A fast growing thallus may have an advantage over neighboring thalli. In this study, the relative growth rate of a lichen was compared to its thallus area, which is a measure of competitive success. Crustose lichens on four hawthorn (Crataegus rosacae) trees were observed in two trials. Only lichens in two-thallus interspecific competitive encounters were studied. Boundaries between neighboring thalli were analyzed using a geometric method, and inferences were made about relative growth rate. Five species were analyzed in eleven competitive encounters. Four patterns of growth were discovered. Results indicate that a high growth rate can be a competitive advantage. It was found that the results of succession among crustose lichens can be predicted with a geometric analysis.<br><br>

Lake Brantley High School, Altamonte Springs, Florida, USA

The purpose of the experiment is to determine the effects of the fungus, Paecilomyces fumosoroseus, on a mustard seed plant’s immunity to cabbage leaf curl virus. The protocol for the experiment is to grow and cultivate 72 mustardseed plants. Cultivate Paecilomyces fumosoroseus (PFR) onto agarose gel dishes, and run through a hemocytometer to distinguish the number of spores. Spray PFR solution onto 24 plants. Then produce “Actigard™” solution and spray onto 24 plants. Allow the remaining 24 plants to be used as a control. Permit the solutions to cultivate on the plants and expose whiteflies to the cabbage leaf curl virus (CLCV). Distribute ten flies per plant and allow to live in the environment. Allow two to three weeks for the virus to show. Visually collect data on the number of affected plants. Take circular samples from the youngest leaves and run PCR on the samples. Run the treated specimens through an electrophoresis gel bed and collect data.<br><br>Visual analysis revealed that the control group yielded 13 plants with active CLCV; the actiguard group yielded 11 plants; the PFR group yielded 7 plants. Statistical analysis evidences PFR’s superiority as a barrier to CLCV over “Actigard™”. At the alpha = .05 level, the rate of infection between the control and “Actigard™” groups is not statistically significant (P=.2819), whereas it is statistically different between the control and PFR groups (P=.0395). In conclusion there is a statistically significant difference in the effectiveness of the methods to prevent the cabbage leaf curl virus.<br><br>

A STUDY OF THE RESISTANCE OF NATIVE SPEARMINT TO VERTICILLIUM WILT AS COMPARED TO BLACK MITCHAM PEPPERMINT AND SCOTCH SPEARMINT
Maggie Sara Fairhurst, Tanya Marie Lazenby
North Toole County High School, Sunburst, Montana, United States

During testing, our goal was to determine if there was a significant difference between the kinds of proteins produced in Native spearmint, Scotch spearmint, and Black Mitcham peppermint when all are infected with Verticillium dahliae. Agrose gel electrophoresis was used to profile the proteins in the different mints. However, being unable to determine any visual difference between these proteins, the project was extended to plate tests. Three plate tests were performed: the droplet test, the filter paper test, and the conidia test were performed to determine if the plant extract had an effect on different stages of verticillium growth. While performing these tests, different dilutions were used on both stem and leaf material to determine if they produced an effect on the pathogens growth. Since contamination posed a problem in this test, the project was extended to another phase. Part three consisted of redoing the droplet test, but also adding a count test to determine if there was a difference in the number of bacteria present in the different parts of the plants and in the different kinds of mint. Upon completion of the experiment, it was found that there was a significant difference in the bacterial counts between the three varieties of mint. There was also a significant difference in the bacterial counts between the leaf and stem tissues. In the fungal core diameters there was a significant difference between the varieties, but not between the leaf and stem tissue.

SUPPRESSION IN BRANCHING IN TREES
Senthalir P, Sharanya S
Avila Convent Matric. Hr. Secondary School, Coimbatore 641 025 Tamil Nadu, India

Neem Oil, besides possessing insect-growth disruption properties also acts as suckericide in Tobacco (Joshi,1986). Therefore its effect on suppression of branches in Ecalyptus tereticornis was assessed, as it will help in maximizing stem Biomass. In the first experiment lateral branches of the selected trees were pruned. Neem oil concentrations of 80%, 40%, 20%, 10% and control (untreated cut branches served as control), were applied on leaf axils of the pruned branches. In the experiment 2 regenerated branches were re-pruned and two Neem oil treatments viz., 100% and 80% were applied with control. In the third experiment the apical shoots were topped and treated with 100% Neem oil along with control. Data on regeneration, and branch length were recorded on 20th, 30th & 60th days after the treatment and subjected to statistical analysis following the Panse and Sukhatme (1967).<br><br>In the first experiment, regeneration of branches was suppressed and there was a parallel between the magnitude of suppression and concentration of Neem oil. Compared to control, the percent reduction in branching at 80% Neem oil was 41.6%. In the second experiment pruned and regenerated lateral branches exhibited severe repression in regenerating ability (81.8%) under 100% concentration relative to control. In the third experiment, coppicing percent of the apical shoot in control was as high as 176% as against 3.75 % under 100 % oil. Reduction in coppicing shoot was 98.3%. By pruning the lateral branches, wasteful consumption of photosynthesis can be precluded and stem bio mass maximized.<br><br>

ALLELOPATHY IN THE RHIZOSPHERE OF SALICORNIA VIIGINICIA
Gwendolyn S Reeve, Allison Gale
Savannah Country Day School, Savannah, Georgia

In previous experiments, extracts of several marsh plants were found to exhibit allelopathic effects on seed germination and growth. Subsequent experiments on marsh plant root, shoot, and seed homogenates localized the inhibiting compound(s) in the shoots, but not in root and seeds. We concluded that release of plant allelochemicals into the environment was not a continuous process and therefore had limited environmental impact. To further our study of marsh plant allelochemical activity we explored the microenvironment of the rhizosphere. The purpose of the experiment was to isolate and identify nitrogen fixing bacteria on S. viiginicia roots and examine the bacteria for allelochemical activity. The procedure involved inoculation of plant roots on nitrogen free media and identification of isolated bacteria by Gram stain, morphology, motility, oxygen-requirement, and API strips. The bacteria were then examined for release of toxins by their inhibition of growth on other bacteria. Results identified the genus of the bacteria and displayed a variation in toxicity. In conclusion, we identified chemical communication among bacteria in the rhizosphere of S. viiginicia. Application of bacteria allelochemicals may be beneficial to agricultural and forestry industries.

ECTOMYCORRHIZAL INOCULATION OF ANISOPTERA THURIFERA AND SHOREA GUISO IN RED SOIL: GROWTH AND PHOSPHORUS DYNAMICS
Jenny S. Aggangan, Joy Charisse O. Bulan, Cheryll Anne S. Limos
Philippine Science High School - Diliman Campus, Quezon City, Philippines

The increasing demand for dipterocarp wood prducts worldwide is causing a rapid decrease in extractable hardwood resource, decline in forest acreage, irreversible loss of biodiversities. Current trends in Philippine Forestry focus on the establishment and survival of forest plantations under degraded sites, and selection of fast-growing genotype through ectomycorrhizal inoculation. This study aims to assess the effect of ectomycorrhizal inoculation on two species of dipterocarps.<br><br>Following a Randomized Complete Block Design with 12 replicates, Anisoptera thurifera and Shorea guiso rooted cuttings were inoculated with mycelial beads containing either Pisolithus PTG, Pisolithus H6394, or Astreus sp.<br><br>Astreus sp. yielded the highest root colonization (38%, p<0.05), height increment (86%, p<0.05), fine root (51%), coarse root (27%), shoot (43%), and total dry weight (40%) in A. thurifera over the control. In S. guiso, Pisolithus H6394 gave the highest (100%) hieght increment. A strong positive relationship between mycorrhizal infection and shoot P uptake (r^2=0.68) denotes that higher P absorption occurred where highest root infection took place. Astreus-inoculated plants had the highest shoot P uptake (41%) while PTG-inoculated treatments obtained the highest fine root P concentration (0.370 mg, p<0.015) and uptake (0.273 mg, p<0.01).<br><br>Astreus sp. established the most suitable symbiotic relationship with A. thurifera. Pisolithus sp. 2(H6394) showed the most significant interaction with S. guiso based from the positive growth responses and root colonization.

SUB-NUCLEAR LOCALIZATION OF THE UNKNOWN PROTEIN, MUO10.12, AND THE CHROMATIN REMODELING FACTOR, HIRA, IN A. THALIANA
Joshua Harris Egan, Jason Pellegrino
Manhasset High School, Manhasset, NY, USA

DiGeorge Syndrome (DGS) is the second most common cause of congenital heart disease after Down Syndrome that causes neural, facial, and cardiovascular defects in humans (Epstein, 2001). HirA is a highly conserved gene that produces a protein that is part of a nucleosome assembly complex acting as a transcriptional co-repressor, which is also implicated in the pathogenesis of DGS. (Magnaghi, 98; Lorain, 2001; and Sharp, 2001) Genetic and biochemical studies demonstrate a role for HirA and an unknown protein, Muo10.12, in knox homeobox gene suppression, genes that are required for stem cell fate in plants (Jackson et al., 94 and Timmermans, 2003). The purpose of this study was to localize the expression of this unknown protein in respect to HirA in order to determine its role in the development of Arabidopsis. Muo10.12-CFP and HirA-YFP fusions were constructed and then inserted into A. Tumefaciens vectors in order to transform Arabidopsis. Successful construction of the vectors was insured by PCR screening, and orientation was tested through restriction enzyme digests. Gold particle gun bombardment was then used to insert the correctly constructed vectors into A. cepa cells. Fluorescent microscopy confirmed the expression of the Muo10.12-CFP and HirA-YFP vectors, thus ensuring successful expression of the fluorescent proteins when applied to Arabidopsis. These data support the belief that Muo10.12 may also play a role in the suppression of stem cell fate in plants and possibly the pathogenesis of DiGeorge Sydrome; however, future studies will investigate their sub-nuclear localizations.

SAVING THE SAGUARO FOREST: THE EFFECTS OF ANTIBIOTICS ON ERWINIA CACTICIDA
Rachael Ann Charles, Carolyn Quigley
Salpointe Catholic High School, Tucson, Arizona, United States

Erwinia cacticida is a bacterium which causes a disease in saguaro cacti called bacterial necrosis. Bacterial necrosis rots away tissue of a cactus, eventually killing the plant. Common treatments have not been scientifically proven effective and often do not stop the progression of the disease. This project attempted to find a treatment for Erwinia cacticida through the use of antibiotics.<br><br>The first step of the experiment was isolating the bacteria from host tissue in several saguaros. Then, the bacteria was cultured and injected into prickly pear pads to test for pathogenicity. Finally, the bacterial isolates were treated with two antibiotics, Oxytetracycline and Streptomycin, to determine sensitivity. <br><br>To statistically analyze the results, a Two-Way Analysis of Variance and Tukey’s Post-Hoc Test were used. There was a significant difference in colony growth found between the control group and the treatment group and also between the different dosages of antibiotics. However, there was not a significant difference in bacterial growth between the two antibiotics. This means that the antibiotics hindered bacterial growth equally. In addition, the concentration of 300 parts per million was determined to be the most effective dilution tested.<br><br>Based on this information, it has been determined that antibiotics can be used to kill Erwinia cacticida. To prove that antibiotics could effectively treat bacterial necrosis in living cacti, infected tissue samples and cacti must be tested. This experiment was a crucial step in ensuring the protection of the saguaro forest from the devastation of this deadly disease.<br><br>

ROLE OF PHENOLS IN HEMEROCALLIS SPP. ( DAYLILY) RESISTANCE TO RUST FUNGUS PUCCINIA HEMEROCALLIDIS
Karishma Saini, Angele Karen Saini
Houston County High School, Warner Robins, Georgia, United States Of America

Phenolic compounds have been recognized to play an important role in the defense mechanism and resistance of many plant species to fungal pathogens. The study of phenolics, therefore, offers an excellent insight into the understanding of host-parasite relationship and the nature of resistance in plants. In the present experiment, the possible relations between the content of phenolic compounds and disease resistance to rust fungus Puccinia hemerocallidis have been studied in susceptible and resistant cultivars of daylily.<br><br> Daylily plants of rust susceptible cultivar Mauna Loa and rust resistant cultivar Lori Fain were used in the experiment. Phenolic compounds and total phenols were measured in the healthy plants and the plants inoculated with urediniospores. The phenolic compounds in the plant samples were analyzed with a High Performance Liquid Chromatograph(HPLC) and the total phenols were measured using a Beckman Coulter DU640 spectrophotometer.<br><br> The measurements showed enhanced amounts of phenolic compounds in both the resistant and susceptible cultivars inoculated with urediniospores. The production of certain phenolic compounds was, however, slightly more pronounced in the resistant cultivar as compared to the susceptible cultivar. It is also possible that the phenolic compounds are produced much quicker in the resistant cultivar in response to the initial penetration by the pathogen thus making them more resistant to further advances by the fungus. We, therefore, argue that both the quantity and the speed with which the phenolic compounds are produced in response to the pathogen are important in the disease resistance of the daylilies. We are planning to measure the phenolic compounds as a function of time as the disease progresses after the initial inoculation by urediniospores. <br><br>

A STUDY OF THE POSSIBLE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS ON HIPPODAMIA CONVERGENS FROM EXPOSURE TO GENETICALLY ALTERED GLYCINE MAX
Andrea Michelle Rucker, Carmella Cassandra Scott
Yazoo City High School, Yazoo City, MS, United States of America

The purpose of this experiment is to compare the possible detrimental effects of the delta endotoxin gene of Bacillus thuringiensis(Bt) and the Roundup Ready gene on beneficial organisms within the ecosystem, such as Hippodamia convergens. Hippodamia convergens, or ladybugs, are one of several species in the family of Coccinellidae. Bacillus thuringiensis is an insecticidal bacterium, marketed worldwide for control of many plant pest. Once Bt has been injested in the gut, the active protoxin of about 60 kD in size is cleaved by gut protease. This toxin is termed delta endotoxin and causes lethal septicemia. Roundup Ready are products of biotechnology used to control weeds without killing the crop itself. It is hypothesized that Hippodamia convergens will be detrimentally effected by the genetically altered Glycine max or soybeans. In Phase I, genetically altered soybeans and natural soybeans were planted and exposed to Hippodamia convergens. In Phase II, the experimental group which contained the Roundup Ready soybeans and natural soybeans were treated with a Bt solution. As a result of the experimentation in Phase I, the majority of the ladybugs were attempting to escape from the Roundup Ready soybeans. However, the number of ladybugs that were trying to escape from the natural soybeans were fewer. As a result of Phase II, the majority of the ladybugs gravitated away from the Bt saturated Roundup Ready soybeans. The number of ladybugs trying to escape from the Bt saturated natural soybeans were fewer.. The Roundup Ready soybeans had the greatest detrimental effect on the ladybugs. This conclusion is beneficial to the agriculture community; it suggests that the altered Glycine max is capable of repelling beneficial insects. In this situation, the beneficial insect destroys the harmful aphids that destroy the soybean. Therefore, it should not be used in the eradication of pest.

THE EFFECT OF TRANSPIRATION ON CORN YIELDS
Kristi A. Brown, Bridget J. Sloan
Delavan High School, Delavan, Illinois, USA

The purpose of this science fair experiement is to determine whether the number of stomata changes based on the yield of corn.<br><br>Cut five sample leaves for each corn variety. Put each sample in a brown paper bag, on each bag write the number of leaves on the lant and the variety. Paint a 3 cm. square of clear fingernail polish on each corn leaf, allow to dry for 20 minutes. Peel off dry fingernail polish square and put the square on a slide, cover with slip cover. Place the slide on the stage of the microscope with low power on. Count number of stomata visible. Record all information for all leaves.<br><br>In conclusion the hypothesis was proved incorrect, the corn varieyt Golden Harvest 9247, which had the highest yeild had the lowest stomata count. The results showed that there was no relationship between the yield and stomata count. The corn variety with the highest stomata count had the fifth highest yield. A number of factors could have affected these results. The time at which the samples were taken could have influenced the number of stomata. Since only five samples were taken from each variety the number of stomata could have changed on other leaves. Also, after the experiment, it was discovered that the variety Golden Harvest 9247 was modified, which could have affected the stomata count. In the future, the project could be expanded by taking samples at different times in the day and at different times during the growing period.

WHO ARE YOU? THE ISOLATION OF ANTIBIOTIC SUBSTANCES IN FLOWERING PLANT SEEDS
Sarah Beth Beth May, Karianne Danese Wood
Mexia High School, Mexia, TX, USA

In our project we endeavored to isolate the compounds containing antibiotic properties in the seeds of three flowering plants. It was difficult to formulate a hypothesis because we did not know what compounds were present in the different kinds of seeds, therefore, we could not say which ones would have antibiotic properties. <br><br>To isolate the compounds, first we made an extract of the seeds: German Chamomile, Sweet Basil, and Blue Mink Ageratum by crushing 2g of seeds and mixing that with 20mL of water. Then to separate the compounds in the extracts, we ran them through electrophoresis from the middle of the gel to determine the charge of the compounds. In order to see the bands we dyed the extracts with 4 different dyes, iodine, methyl blue, methyl red, and toluidine blue. Then we cut the gels into segments and placed them on Petri dishes streaked with E. coli bacteria. These segments contained antibiotic compounds: German Chamomile, segments 1 and 4, Sweet Basil, segments 1 and 3, and Ageratum, segments 1,2, and 3.<br><br>In our project, we isolated the compounds in the seeds that contained antibiotic properties and determined their charge and relative size. With our resources, we could not determine what those compounds actually were, however, we are one step closer to potentially discovering a new antibiotic.

POPOLO PUNCH: EXTRACT FROM SOLANUM LEAVES INHIBITS FUNGAL GROWTH
Chivas H. K. Wakuta, Jenae M. M. Reyes
Kamehameha High School, Honolulu HI

Solanum americanum, known as popolo in Hawai‘i, was widely used among the Hawaiian herbalists to treat sore throats, wounds, and bacterial infections. Recently, a study found anti-dermatophyte properties within a Solanum extract. The purpose of this research project is to evaluate anti-fungal properties within a Solanum extract that can possibly be used against the plant-plaguing fungi of Hawai‘i. We hypothesize that if there are anti-dermatophyte properties that accompany the Solanum’s medicinal capabilities, then it will have an anti-fungal characteristic toward plant-plaguing fungi. A leaf extract from Solanum plants grown on the island of Kaua‘i was found to be inhibitory towards the growth of a common fungus, Sordaria fimicola. The extract was then tested against three agricultural fungi isolated from a papaya, a heliconia, or anthurium. The Solanum leaf extract proved to also be inhibitory towards the fungi isolated from the heliconia and anthurium. A dosage response against the two agricultural fungi showed a dose-dependent inhibition of fungal growth even when the extract was diluted to 1% of its original strength. From our research we have found a potent fungicide that may fight Hawai‘i’s plant plaguing fungi, and be of significant value to Hawai‘i’s agricultural and horticultural economy.

ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY GROWTH UNIT III - A STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY ON PLANT GROWTH
Michael Ivan Judson, Nelson Radmall
Pleasant Grove High School, Pleasant Grove, UT, United States 

This project is a study of the effects of artificial gravity (centripetal acceleration) during specific time intervals during the early stages of plant growth. Through this experimentation we wanted to determine whether or not the effects of artificial gravity continue after the artificial gravity vector has been removed; Specifically we wanted to find whether or not the plants continued to grow at an accelerated rate. We hope that through theses results a system can be developed to efficiently simulate gravity in space. We also through this research wish to continue to uncover the specific processes of gravitropism.<br><br>In these tests we grew six different groups of wheat seedlings. Five of the groups were â€œgravistimulatedâ€ for a different 27-hour period during the 135-hour total growth time and the sixth served as a control group. At the end of the total growth time we measured and compared the lengths of each of the roots. We also used light microscopy to compare the placement of cellular organelles in each group of seedlings<br><br>In our experiments we found that the plants did continue to exhibit accelerated growth rates even after the artificial gravity vector was removed.<br><br>This project also included building an apparatus that is scheduled to fly on board the space shuttle to test the effects of artificial gravity on wheat seedling growth. This experiment will be able to test the effects of artificial gravity without a vector of Earthâ€™s gravity present.<br><br>

PERPLEXING POLKA DOTS A STUDY OF POLYGENIC INHERITANCE IN MUTATED CERATOPTERIS RICHARDII
Jennifer Dawn Harper, Valerie Star Friedmann
Jefferson County High School, Dandridge, TN, USA

The R3BETAV242 and R3BETAV39 strains of recessive polka dot Ceratopteris richardii (C-fern) were crossbred to produce an F2 generation for study. The expected F2 generation consisted of a 3:1 ratio of polka dot to wild type C-ferns. This ratio is expected because the researchers hypothesized that the polka dot mutation is controlled by polygenic inheritance based on observations made in Phase One of the experiment. Crosses using 242 hermaphrodites, regardless of the source of the sperm, produced all polka dot sporophytes in the F2 generation. Likewise, all wild type sporophytes were produced by 39 hermaphrodites with no regard to the strain of sperm used. Polygenic inheritance explains the crosses between two 242 strains and two 39 strains as well as the cross between a 242 hermaphrodite and a 39 male, however the cross between a 39 hermaphrodite and a 242 male leads the researchers to believe that there is yet another aspect controlling the expression of the polka dot trait. The current data indicates that the polka dot mutation is controlled not only by polygenic inheritance, but also by cytoplasmic determinants.

ISOLATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF POSSIBLE ALLELO-CHEMICALS IN BUFFALO GRASS (BUCHLOE DACTYLOIDES) AND TI (CORDYLINE TERMINALIS), 2ND YEAR STUDY
Carrie Gemma Esaki, Jeremy K. M. Albano, Samuel I.H. Moats-Messing
Kapaa High School, Kapaa, Hawaii, USA

This project was a 2nd-year study conducted to isolate and characterize chemicals responsible for the allelopathic behavior of Ti (Cordyline terminalis) and Buffalo Grass (Buchloe dactyloides). Such behavior was detected in the previous year study.<br><br> Additionally, to address questions that arose from the previous year, the pH of both species was tested to determine its effect on seed germination. Also, possible allelo-chemicals in the roots were tested for, using root extracts. <br><br> Tests showed that pH levels were within the suitable range for seed germination. However, results showed that the roots did in fact inhibit seed growth, hence were earmarked for future studies. <br><br> Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) was used to isolate chemicals from crude Ti and Buffalo Grass extracts. Fractions were dissolved in water and mixed in an agar gel solution. Mung bean seeds were sown into the gel plates and biomass measurements taken after three days. Results showed that the Ti-4 and Buffalo Grass-2 fractions had the greatest significant differences compared to the control.<br><br> The Ti-4 and Buffalo Grass-2 fractions were thus subjected to various TLC characterization assays. The TLC results determined that there seems to be a single compound in each extract and, using logic and the process of elimination, it was further determined that the compounds are most likely short-chain acid lipids with an amine branch somewhere along the chain. Because both plant species had identical results (positives and negatives), it was deduced that the allelo-chemicals in both are either identical or very similar.<br><br>

INDUCTION OF AGE RELATED RESISTANCE IN PLANTS THROUGH ABIOTIC STRESS
Jason Lee Aramburu, Mandeep Singh Mangat
Keystone School, San Antonio, Texas, USA

The purpose of this project is to determine if an increased resistance to viral and bacterial attacks in tomato plants is related to the amount of SA present in the leaves, if the plant’s age plays a role in its ability to defend against the aforementioned attacks, and if ARR can be induced by stimulating the production of HSPs. <br><br> The tomato plants were initially stressed by flooding, drought, UV light, and oxygen, which were to stimulate the formation of HSPs and SA and infected with TMV or A. tumefacien. The HPLC measured the concentration of SA in the different groups, and the area of the TMV infected leaves and depth of galls on A. tumefacien infected plants were measured using software. A 1D gel electrophoresis determined the size and percent increase of specific proteins.<br><br> Experimentation showed that the infected, stressed, young plants did as well as the infected, old plants at resisting the pathogen. The young infected plants displayed more symptoms of infection than any other group. In addition, old plants had the highest SA concentration.<br><br> After analyzing and interpreting the data, it was determined that age does confer a broad-range resistance to viral and bacterial attacks in plants. However, SA alone is not responsible for conferring increased resistance to the plants as evident by the HPLC tests. Finally, it was determined that pretreatment of young plants with abiotic stresses does induce viral and bacterial resistance equivalent to ARR in young plants, along with protein enhancement similar to that which is caused by age. Therefore, it is possible that disease resistance developed during the aging process is a function of certain protein development rather than SA concentration, a development that can be initiated by certain limited stresses.<br><br>

A STUDY OF LIGHT-WEIGHT HYDROPONIC MEDIA FOR POTENTIAL USAGE IN SPACE
Thomas Lee Powell
Trinity Catholic High School, Ocala, FL United States of America

Hydroponics is the art/science of growing plants without soil. This practice is very ancient and was used by the Natives of South America, the Egyptians, the Aztecs, and the Babylonians. Over time these great empires died out, and the knowledge of hydroponics was lost. Recently Europeans and Americans rediscovered hydroponics for use in research laboratories. More recently hydroponics has been widely adapted for food production. Much hydroponic research today is involved in the adaptation of hydroponics to the micro-gravity environment of space. The focus of this project is to study effectiveness of the various light-weight media. <br><br> Procedure. The hydroponic system was constructed and stocked with pea seeds. These were placed in one of six different light-weight media (Gravel, Oasis, Bioballs, Volcanite, Filter floss, and Sponge) and automatically watered. The control media was gravel because it was the superior media in the last study. Plant growth rate, crop yield, plant mass, and plant production rates were recorded.<br><br> Observations and Data. Data analysis showed Oasis and Volcanite to be the superior growth medias in terms of plant growth rate, total crop weight, plant mass, and plant production rate. Gravel and Bioballs also showed good crop yield. Sponge was found to disintegrate and support unwanted algae growth. <br><br> Conclusion. While several of the media tested showed acceptable properties for micro-gravity hydroponics, Oasis and Volcanite showed clear superiority in the parameters examined (growth rate, crop yield, plant mass, and plant production rate). Possible reasons were discussed and future areas of inquiry suggested. <br><br>

BOTANICAL PESTICIDES: DO THEY WORK?
Jennifer Marie Herig
Lawton Chiles High School, Tallahassee, Florida, United States Of America

The purpose of this project was to find out whether garlic, citrus oil, or basil can be used as botanical pesticides. Liquid solutions were made using each of the three substances, and a fourth control substance(water). The experiment was conducted on tobacco hornworms, which were ordered from a science supply company. The majority of the ordered hornworms died of unknown causes, so in order to conduct the experiment,the remaining hornworms were allowed to complete their lifecycle. The moths mated and laid eggs, and once the eggs matured into larvae, the experiment was conducted. Tomato leaves were used as the carrier for the pesticides. <br><br>A tomato leaf was soaked in a solution for 10 minutes, and was placed, along with a leaf that was not soaked, in a container containing one hornworm. This procedure was repeated for each solution. Three hornworms were tested for each of the four solutions. For the basil solution, the first hornworm did not eat the leaf with the solution or the control leaf. The second and third hornworms did not eat the leaves with the basil solution on them, but they ate the control leaf. For the garlic solution, the first and second hornworms ate both leaves, but the third hornworm did not eat either of the leaves. The citrus oil and control solutions both produced the same results, with all three hornworms from each group eating both leaves. This data shows that basil was the most successful substance for repelling hornworms from tomato plants. <br><br>

AN EXAMINATION OF ANTIOXIDANTS AND THEIR CHANGES DURING THE RIPENING STAGES OF A STRAWBERRY GUAVA
Nicholas Michael Duncan
Springstead Highschool, Spring Hill, FL, United States

The purpose of this project is to examine the capacity and activity of antioxidants of a strawberry guava and changes during the ripening stage. The procedure of this project started with the folins assay where folins reagent was added to the samples followed by sodium carbonate. Samples were then diluted and then placed in a spectrophotometer. The oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay (ORAC) started with a sample of guava and flourascene was added followed by the free radical AAPH. Samples were placed in a F-Max detector and the results were compared to a standard curve of trolox. The High Performance Liquid Chromatography assay (HPLC) started by fractionating the guava samples in order to obtain the needed compounds. The samples were then placed in a HPLC vial and the then placed in the machine. In conclusion to the experimentation and observations of this project, it is concluded that the hypothesis was accepted and rejected. Since the results from the HPLC did not give much evidence to the increasing trend of the concentration of antioxidants and total soluble phenolics, the results from the ORAC assay and folins assay was used for a conclusive analysis. The results from the folins assay showed that the hypothesis was correct. On all seven days of the ripening stage the antioxidant capacity increased, where on day 0 it was at 917.2 ppm an on day 7 it rose to 1084.3 ppm. In the results of the ORAC assay it was revealed that the hypothesis stated was incorrect. The average day results showed that on day 0 the average was 13.74 _M TE/g. and on day five results it increased all the way up to 22.07 _M. The results of day seven showed that the trend no longer was increasing. With a drop of 4.15 _M to get an average result of 17.92 _M TE/g it was observed that the hypothesis was incorrect. The decrease in the ORAC assay had a larger difference between day five and day seven then it did in the folins assay.

THE EFFECT OF NITROGEN LEVELS ON THE PROTEIN SYNTHESIS OF BACILLUS THURINGIENSIS IN ZEA MAYS L.
Courtney Zasha Monique Rumala
Westgate Christian Academy, Spring Hill, Florida, United States

This experiment was designed to determine if nitrogen levels effect the protein synthesis of bacillus thuringiensis in Zea mays L. This experiment tested non-BT corn, Thuricide treated corn and BT corn groups. Thirty (30)BT plants and Twenty (20) non-BT plants were grown in a temperature-controlled greenhouse. The BT plants were also treated with different levels of nitrogen. One group had a level of 100 and another group had a level of 200. When the plants obtained 4 to 5 leaves, they were cut and transferred to petri-dishes for the fall armyworm to feed on. Larval feeding lasted 14 days for each group of plants and fresh plant cuttings were provided daily. After testing each group, the larvae were weighed and the calculations were recorded. Based on the results, the larvae that fed on the Thuricide treated corn had a mortality rate of 80% and the BT 100 treated corn had a mortality rate of 50%. The BT corn had a mortality rate of 40% and the Non-BT corn had a mortality rate of 20%. Last but not least, the BT 200 group had a mortality rate of 0%. Therefore my hypothesis was determined to be correct. Using less than a level of 100 can have a lower mortality rate and using a level of 200 or higher can cause a lower mortality rate. I also believe that the BT 200 didn’t have a mortality rate because the high nitrogen level converted to high energy levels for the fall armyworm. <br><br>

SUN AND SHADE ACCLIMATION OF THE PHOTOSYNTHETIC APPARATUS IN GYMNOSTOMUM AERUGINOSUM
Adam Douglas Yock
Breck School, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA

In this project, light adaptability was assessed by comparing chlorophyll ratios (chlorophyll a/ chlorophyll b) and the ratio of thylakoid proteins in sun- and shade-acclimated moss (Gymnostomum aeruginosum). Lower-order species, such as moss, are known to lack light adaptability, but the adaptability of moss proteins has not been reported.<br><br> Moss thylakoids were isolated from moss collected from the banks of a small rivulet located in St. Paul MN. The chlorophyll ratios were calculated from spectrophotometer measurements, and the protein ratios were determined by gel electrophoresis.<br><br> The hypothesis that the chlorophyll ratios of sun- and shade-acclimated specimens would not change was supported (p = 0.8868). Shade-acclimated moss demonstrated a four-fold increase in the amount of total chlorophyll, chlorophyll a + chlorophyll b (p = 0.0050). Contrary to the hypothesis, shade-acclimated moss demonstrated a significantly higher LHCp/RCp ratio than sun-acclimated moss (p = 7E-2). This indicates that Gymnostomum aeruginosum did adjust thylakoid proteins to differing light conditions. The fact that all samples for each specimen came from the same thylakoid isolation and the low yield of shade-acclimated moss proteins could have caused the apparent discrepancy of protein ratios.<br><br> Further research could explore this apparent discrepancy between the expected lack of change in chlorophyll ratios and the unexpected change in the ratio of thylakoid proteins in moss. This should be done using several thylakoid isolations per specimen to determine the significant change in protein ratios between sun- and shade-acclimated moss demonstrated in this project.<br><br>

EFFECTIVENESS OF BIOFUMIGANTS VERSUS NATURAL ANTAGONISTS FOR MELOIDOGYNE INCOGNITA MANAGEMENT IN LYCOPERSICON ESCULENTUM
Matthew Jess Richardson
Walton High School, DeFuniak Springs FL, United States of America

Experimental design of this two-part project focused on testing biological nematode control agents. Part I determined susceptibility to Meloidogyne incognita of three plant species, Lycopersicon esculentum, Brassica oleracea, and Clitoria ternatea; and the effectiveness of Steinernema feltiae to deter nematodes. Part II evaluated biofumigant effectiveness of foliage incorporated into soil. It was hypothesized combination of Clitoria and Steinernema as most effective. Steinernema would be more effective alone than biofumigant mulch alone.<br><br> Part I (twice tested) consisted of 84 plants equally divided into three species groups further divided into three treatment groups (Steinernema Feltiae, Meloidogyne incognita or both) grown under identical conditions. For Part II, 84 Lycopersicon esculentum plants were transplanted into foliage mulch of Lycopersicon, Brassica, and Clitoria groups. Steinernema feltiae and Meloidogyne incognita treatments were applied in some groups. Plants received identical conditions. Top and root weight, gall index data were recorded. <br><br> Part I data suggested Brassica and Clitoria were resistant to the Meloidogyne incognita infestation, Lycopersicon was not. The Steinernema feltiae inconsistently changed infection rates in Brassica, Clitoria, and Lycopersicon. Part II data revealed Brassica oleracea and Clitoria ternatea mulch were nematode deterrents. <br><br> Clitoria and Brassica are effective biofumigant mulches. Steinernema feltiae was not consistently an effective nematode deterrent in soil or mulch. Biofumigants can be important in crop rotational systems to decrease damage to susceptible crops such as Lycopersion esculentum. Further, addition of organic matter to soil provides natural fertilizer. Biofumigants and natural antagonists are not harmful to the environment, humans, plants, or wildlife.<br><br><br>

GREEN MANURE VS. MELOIDOGYNE CHITWOODI
Heather Renae Messick
Sargent High School, Monte Vista, CO, U.S.A. 

Growing potatoes in the agriculturally reliant San Luis Valley of Colorado is a way of life. Recently, that lifestyle has become threatened by the increasing presence of Meloidogyne chitwoodi, or the Columbia Root-knot nematode. I wanted to see if green manure plants could be used as management tools to reduce the soaring number of Columbia Root-knot nematodes. I grew barley, radish, rye, mustard, and sorghum-sudan grass for six weeks. To find if it was the shoots or the roots of the plants that affected the nematodes I separated the plant parts and then incorporated 40 grams of plant matter into 1000 grams of nematode infested soil. I repeated this process with the roots and the shoots three times each and with the addition of the Controls, placed the 36 resulting pots in incubation for 17 days. Then I took samples from the pots and sent them to Oregon State University for nematode extraction and counting. I received the results that of the five green manures tested, the Moravian 14 barley was the most nematicidal with the root trials showing 53.87% mortality. That number increased to 79.58% mortality in the barley shoots, leading to 66.73% average. The roots contributed an increase of 3784 free-living (beneficial) nematodes and with the 10,577 from the shoots, Moravian 14 barley averaged a 7,181 free-living nematode increase. Based on my results, although green manures may not totally eliminate nematodes, it appears they may reduce populations sufficiently enough that chemical control may then be more effective.

EVALUATING NOVEL POTATO GERMPLASM FOR POTATO VIRUS Y
Nicole Marie Thomas
Sierra Grande School Blanca Colorado USA

Are lines that are breed for PVY resistance able to express that resistance? It was believed that potato crosses that are developed from wild type and PVY resistant germplasm, will show varying degrees of resistance to PVY. <br><br> The breeding program potato crosses will show varying degrees of resistance to PVY and will test positive for the virus using mechanical or physical inoculation. Not all crosses made from germplasm will be highly resistant, but some will demonstrate degrees of resistance. The procedure was to plant 5 tubers from each variety, including controls. Next, transplant three aphids from PVY positive control plants to the first two plants of each variety set, including the control variety. Then, leave middle plants of each variety as a control. Mechanically inoculate the last two plants of each variety. <br><br> Run ELISA tests on the leaves of all plants to check for virus presence, and then harvest four tubers from each plant, and break dormancy using Gibrillic acid. Plant harvested tubers in winter plots. The data showed that in the first growing season after inoculation, none of the novel potato varieties tested positive for PVY or showed physical properties for PVY infection. When the plants were retested a month later the same results were shown, with only control plants testing positive. <br><br> After the second testing the results were the same. When the tubers were tested in the winter plots the results showed that six of the varieties were highly resistant, and the rest expressed low to moderate resistance. <br><br>

WHICH LOCAL RANGE PLANT HAS THE HIGHEST NUTRITIONAL CONTENT?
Tara Janae Elkins
Grants High School, Grants, New Mexico, USA

The Cattle Industry is a very important part of the southwest's economy. However, in our rapidly modernizing world, it becomes harder every year for small herd ranchers to stay in business. In order for our local cattleman to make money, they need to increase their production on an already tight budget. To do this, they need to know which feed will benefit their cattle the most. This experiment was conducted in order to determine which local range plant has the highest nutritional content. It was predicted that Fourwing Saltbush is the most nutritious warm season plant in our area. Western Wheatgrass was speculated to be the most nutritious cool season plant. In order to test this, samples of eight different range plants were collected and identified. The samples were ground with trichloroacetic acid to break them down into a milky suspension, each sample was digested and put through a series of tests to determine their protein, glucose, and amino acid content. After the experiments were completed, it was determined that Bottlebrush Squirreltail is the cool season plant that contains the most protein at 28.8%, the most essential amino acids (containing 5), and one of the highest amounts of glucose at 150 mg/dL. Sideoats Grama was found to be the warm season range plant that contains the second largest amount of protein at 18.8%, the most essential amino acids (containing 4), and one of the highest amounts of glucose at 100 mg/dL. In conclusion, in both instances, the hypothesis was proven incorrect.

TREATMENT OF XANTHOMONAS CAMPESTRIS PV. VESICATORIA INDUCED BACTERIAL BLIGHT WITH UV-ALTERED BACTERIOPHAGES
Lauren Marie Smith
Rampart High School, Colorado Springs, CO USA

Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria (Xcv), a highly pathogenic bacterium, causes multiple plant diseases including bacterial spot of tomato. Bacteriophages are viruses that infect and lyse specific bacteria. Application of phage suspensions to tomato crops is a somewhat effective treatment for prevention of bacterial spot, however, an undetermined amount of UV light alters the phage so it is ineffective at preventing disease. The objective of the experiment was to determine how much UV exposure Xcv specific bacteriophages can tolerate and still prevent bacterial blight on tomato. The hypothesis was that the phage suspension could be exposed to up to 6600 microJ/cm^2 (60 sec.) and maintain the majority of its protective benefits. Phage suspensions altered by varying amounts of UV light were applied to mature tomato plants prior to inoculation with the pathogen Xcv. A control group was treated with water to gauge bacterial spot on tomato not exposed to phage. Data were collected through examination of randomly selected leaflets from plants representing each treatment. Averages were calculated for the quantity of bacterial spot for each treatment. Experimental trials demonstrate that the phage mix can be exposed to up to 6600 mJ/cm2 and still retain the majority of its efficacy. Average bacterial blight disease level data and mean percentage disease control data indicate the seven-strain phage mix loses 50% of its efficacy (LD 50) at 7,831 microJ/cm^2. A better understanding of the UV–phage interaction is vital to develop treatments that enhance the effectiveness of viral therapy in commercial crops.

ANTIMICROBIAL PROPERTIES OF TEXAS NATIVE PLANTS
Cathleen Rose Garcia
Douglas MacArthur High School, San Antonio, TX, United States of America

It can be traced back into time that plants have been used to treat ailments and diseases; therefore, those plants used most likely contain some antimicrobial properties. The purpose of my experiment was to find out if the native Texas plants I selected possessed any antimicrobial properties. I hypothesized that some of the plants would resist bacterial growth and have antimicrobial properties.<br><br> This year I tested 12 Texas native plants. In conducting my experiment, I punched out and sterilized discs of Bibulous paper. Second, I prepared the plant mixture. I performed the steps to prepare for inoculation of the bacteria. Next, I dipped the discs into the plant mixture for two seconds, and I placed them on known pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria in petri dishes for a 48-hour incubation. Finally, I measured the zones of inhibition.<br><br> My hypothesis proved to be correct; in fact, all my plants displayed a zone of inhibition to at least one bacterium. Blackfoot daisy (Melampodium leucanthum) and Mealy blue sage (Salvia farinarea) showed 8 mm zones to non-pathogenic bacteria (largest zones recorded). Most importantly, zones of inhibition were found by 9 Texas native plants tested against Staphylococcus aureus, a known pathogen.

REVOLUTIONARY EXPRESSION OF CALCIUM-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASES FROM ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA USING SITE-SPECIFIC RECOMBINATION
Ravi Bharat Parikh
Lecanto High School, Lecanto, Florida, USA

Site-specific recombination (SSR) is theorized to generate highly accurate products as compared to other recombination protocols. Manipulating specific attB/P and attL/R sites between entry clones, donor vectors, and a universal-expression based destination vector, SSR maintains gene purity and increases efficiency in cDNA insert expression.<br><br> The aim of this study was to establish the viability of SSR as a recombination protocol specific to active kinase expression by expressing Calcium-Dependent Protein Kinases (CDPKs) extracted from Arabidopsis thaliana in E. coli cells.<br><br> CDPK gene sequence was verified using restriction enzyme digestion analysis. Inserts were amplified using Adapter Polymerase Chain Reaction. Amplified (400 ng/ul) CDPK genes were ligated to the pDONR vector using BP Clonase and were subsequently sequenced. LR recombination between pDONR and the universal expression vector pDEST24 was performed. Optimal expression conditions were determined, and proteins were affinity purified using glutathione sulfotransferase. CDPK genes were expressed from pDEST24 in E. coli BL-21 cells.<br><br> SSR occurred successfully for all inserts assessed. One gene was expressed in E. coli BL-21 cells at 150 ug/ul according to acrylamide gel analysis. Optimal bacterial strain, inducement period, and temperature conditions were determined for CDPK expression.<br><br> This study documents the first successful SSR-based recombination of a CDPK using the devised protocol. Results indicate that SSR is a viable and efficient protocol for expression of active kinases in vitro, thus establishing a novel procedure in kinase-based genetic recombination. CDPK-specific results from this study could be utilized in substrate assays in the model species A. thaliana.<br><br>

THE ROLE OF MELATONIN IN PLANT RESISTANCE TO DISEASE AND STRESS
Albert Yu Tan Wu
Keystone School, San Antonio, Texas, USA

Melatonin is a principal hormone secreted by the pineal gland. The synthesis and release of melatonin is stimulated by darkness and inhibited by light, and also rises and falls on a daily circadian cycle. Although no role for melatonin is currently understood for a plant species, it is believed that it may be involved in plant photomorphogenesis and adaptations of plants to seasonal and environmental changes. <br><br>The purpose of this project was to determine if melatonin plays any role in plant resistance to viral attacks and stress and to determine if its effect will be more pronounced during the dark cycle rather than the light cycle.<br><br>Corn and wheat plants were given various melatonin solutions and underwent a heat stress to determine the role of melatonin in promoting plant resistance. Tomato plants were infected with tobacco mosaic virus and exposed to various periodicities, as well as 500 ppm of melatonin. Melatonin levels were also measured using the ELISA method.<br><br>After analyzing and interpreting the data, it was concluded that melatonin does promote resistance to disease and stress. The corn and wheat grew taller in the presence of melatonin and appeared to repel the effects of heat stress and germinated more quickly with the increased amount and exposure to melatonin. The size of the lesions created by the tobacco mosaic virus was smaller when melatonin was applied to the leaves of the tomato plants. The tomato plants infected and grown within longer dark cycles demonstrated increased resistance to disease. The results of this project suggest that melatonin, when applied exogenously or developed endogenously in the plant through increased dark cycle, plays a significant role in plant resistance to stress and disease.<br><br>

MMHC AND GROWTH RATES IN PEAS
Camille Elisabeth Wendlandt
School of Science and Technology, Beaverton, Oregon, United States of America

Maximum Moisture Holding Capacity, or MMHC, is the maximum amount of water a species of seed can absorb per unit dry mass. I began to wonder with what percentage of its MMHC a pea seed needed to be saturated to grow at its greatest rate, so I set up an experiment to discover this. I found the MMHC of Oregon Sugar Pod II Pea seeds to be 118.25% and then saturated 11 populations of 20 seeds each with different percentages of this value. The moisture levels ranged from 0% to 100% with intervals of 10%. Each population was planted in a dish of low-moisture soil and its germination and growth rates were measured for 16 days. Two days before the first seeds sprouted, I began adding small, equal amounts of water to each of the dishes daily so they would remain alive throughout the data-taking period. I hypothesized the seeds would grow at their greatest rate when saturated to about 40% of their MMHC. After the experimentation period, I discovered the seeds that grew most quickly were those that had been saturated with only 20% of their MMHC, while seeds saturated to 60% MMHC showed about half that rate of growth. Although the rates of growth were affected by moisture in the soil, they indicated that pea seeds could grow at greater rates when exposed to smaller, rather than larger amounts of water.

NOVEL USES OF DATE SEEDS
Harshini Ramachandran
Shri B S Mootha Girls Senior Secondary School, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India

Date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) has been found with human civilization since 5000 B. C. India annually imports large quantities of dates, most of it with seeds. The seeds of this nutritious fruit are mechanically separated and discarded. The purpose of this project was to study date palm seed powder (DPSP) and find out several possible uses for this wasted material.<br><br> <br><br>Nutrient analysis by UV and atomic absorption spectro photometry as well as several other test procedures showed the presence of phosphorus, potassium and several other minerals. Experiments have been carried out and the data analyzed to show an increased growth yield of the test plant. This makes it a potential candidate for bio-manure.<br><br> <br><br>The DPSP is also rich in vitamins A, C, E and has high fiber content. Hence, experiments have been done to probe its possible use as a cosmetic agent.<br><br> <br><br>The high content of carbohydrates, proteins and vitamins indicate that it has a potential to be used in health drinks.<br><br> <br><br>The report concludes that date palm seeds, which are wasted currently in large quantities, can be put to use in a variety of ways.<br><br>

COMPARATIVE GROWTH EFFICIENCY OF BRASSICA RAPA IN VARIED CORN COB CHARCOAL COMPOSITIONS
Megan Arvee G. Soriano
Waipahu High School, Waipahu HI, USA

Charcoal has properties that are beneficial to plants; for example, its porosity allows for retaining moisture in the soil. The purpose of the experiment is to determine if charcoal affects plant growth. Brassica rapa was chosen as a model plant because of its short life span. It was hypothesized that if the corncob charcoal was mixed with soil, then the groups with 20 to 40 percent composition will have a greater dry mass and seed count than the control group. The independent variables are the varied charcoal compositions. The dependent variables are the plants’ dry mass and seed count.<br><br> 40 seeds were planted per soil condition; they were grown, pollinated, and dried. Dry mass and seed count were totaled. It was found that Groups 3 and 4 (20 and 40 percent charcoal composition respectively) did statistically better than the control for the seed count; Group 3 produced 496 seeds, giving a 95% significance on a Student T-test, and Group 4 produced 461 seeds, which has 99.5% significance. However, Group 3 showed a 50% data significance on the dry mass data, while Group 4 proved had 99.5% data significance.<br><br> These statistics prove my hypothesis false. Since Group 3 produced 50% accuracy for the dry mass and 95% for the seed count, the data might have been due to chance. However, Group 4, with the 20% charcoal composition, showed 99.5% confidence in both tests. Further research of charcoal effects in later progenies on their DNA structures will be done in the future.

RHIZOBIA INOCULATION OF WHEAT: A SURROGATE HOST FOR SLOWLY ESTABLISHING PRAIRIE LEGUMES
Thai Thanh Doan
Coon Rapids High School, Coon Rapids, MN, USA

Worldwide nitrogen consumption continues to increase each year. Continual expansion toward the production of nitrogen fertilizer could prove counterproductive, seeing as environmental nitrogen pollution and deposition would increase as a result. Nitrogen fixing nodules form on the root and stem systems of various prairie legumes via infection of mutually symbiotic N2-fixing bacteria, known as rhizobia. Variances in legume germination rates led to devising a method for possible rhizobia sustainability through rhizopheric establishment of the bacteria in wheat. Eight winter wheat cultivars were inoculated with a mixed strain of rhizobia, and monitored for 28 days for viability. Cultivars Seward and Roughrider maintained the highest level of bacteria, suggesting potential as individual hosts.

INFLUENCE OF LEAF CHARACTERISTICS ON 'SUDDEN OAK DEATH' SUSCEPTIBILITY
Allison Marie Blackwell
Gold Beach High School, Gold Beach, Oregon, United States

Sudden Oak Death (SOD) is caused by the plant pathogen Phytophthora ramorum. SOD was first discovered in the United States in 1995 and has since spread to twelve counties in California and one in Oregon. Counties where SOD has been identified are all located in the coastal fog belt. SOD can be transmitted from plant to plant by arial movement and by infected bark, rainwater, and soil. Thirty-eight plant species are now known to be susceptible to Phytophthora ramorum.<br><br>'Wettability' is the ability of a leaf to retain water on its surface. In humid areas, plants possessing leaves with greater wettability may have a higher risk of developing certain bacterial and fungal pathogens. The purpose of this research was to determine if wettability is a determining factor in which plant species become infected with SOD and which do not.<br><br>Five species known to be susceptible to SOD and five that were not known to be susceptible were selected for testing. Two measures of wettability were used: (1) grams of water retained per square centimeter of leaf area, as determined by a leaf submergence test and (2) the tilt angle required for a leaf to shed a water droplet from the top or bottom leaf surface.<br><br>Leaves known to be susceptible or of unknown susceptibility were exposed to Phytophthora ramorum to see if there was a correlation between wettability and P. ramorum-caused leaf necrosis. A surfactant was also applied to leaves of susceptible species to assess the effectiveness of a surfactant in reducing wettability and leaf necrosis.

DELAYED DEVELOPMENT: A STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF PACLOBUTRAZOL ON VARIOUS PLANT SPECIES
Jennifer Lee Nagel
Dekalb High School, Auburn IN, United States of America

This study is the result of experimentation regarding the effects of Paclobutrazol treatment on common plant species. It was designed to determine the effectiveness of treatment through subirrigation, applied in of varying concentrations and manners. Analytical experimentation was also completed to observe the possibility of residual build-up in plant matter. <br><br> The first stage of experiments implemented Brassica Rapa as a plant species. Tests were run with varying concentrations of Paclobutrazol, and were administered in a single application and also through daily application. The method of administration included subirrigation, surface application, and spray application. Furthermore, fertilizer and varying water sources were used in some test groups. The next phase of testing eliminated many of the test groups, and only studied the effectiveness of subirrigation as opposed to surface application. Also, more common bedding plants were used. To analyze Paclobutrazol concentrations within individual plants at the end of treatment, HPLC was utilized. <br><br> The more refined tests produced more discernable results. The Brassica Rapa were too sensitive to the Paclobutrazol, and in the stronger concentrations, the Paclobutrazol proved to be herbicidal. Rather than lower the concentration, which obstructs the likelihood of practical application, tests were refined with a narrowed focus using a different treatment regimen and plants such as petunia, snapdragon, and calibrichoa. With these plants, correlation existed between plant height, diameter, shoot fresh weight, length between internodes, leaf area, and concentration in plant matter. Subirrigation produced desired results; this study led to the prospect of continued study of residual effects of Paclobutrazol. <br><br>

CLONING CDNA OF A PREDICTED GENE IN THE 'EVERGROWING' LOCUS OF PEACH ('PRUNUS PERSICA')
Chelsea Lynne Reighard
South Carolina Governor's School for Science and Mathematics, Hartsville SC, USA

The identification of dormancy-related genes in peach ['Prunus persica' (L.) Batsch] adds new insight in understanding dormancy of deciduous trees. The recessive allele in the 'Evergrowing' gene ('EVG') triggers unusual behavior in peach. These mutant evergrowing peach trees do not follow the same dormancy pattern of other woody plants. The lateral buds of affected trees go into dormancy, while their terminal buds continue to grow. The mutant 'EVG' locus contains a large deletion affecting at least six potential genes including a Calcium Binding Protein (CaBP) gene. The first objective of this project was to isolate the 3' and 5' ends of the CaBP cDNA from the peach rootstock 'NemaRed', a normal, deciduous phenotype, to verify the predicted intron and exon structure of the gene. The second objective of the project was to compare isolated cDNA to the genomic DNA sequence to determine if the correct region of the genome was isolated. A linear amplification protocol previously used on MADS-box genes was used to obtain the 3' end, and a standard PCR protocol was used to find the 5' end. The resulting cDNA was then cloned and sequenced. Despite repeated efforts to isolate the CaBP gene transcript, it could not be found in a June sample; however, this gene was expressed in an October sample of another peach rootstock. From these results, we postulate that the gene was not expressed in the summer RNA sample and is potentially expressed only during dormancy-inducing conditions in the fall. Future research plans are to collect samples monthly for analysis using the same methods to try to elucidate this gene's pattern of expression.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRESSURE WATER POTENTIAL DEVICE AND ITS APPLICATION TO MEASURING THE CRITICAL RANGE UNDER WATER DROUGHTY STRESS
Pengfei Cao
Beijing No.65 High School, Beijing, P. R. China

The purposes of this study are as follows: First, the xylem water potentials of some wild and home plants were measured by using the pressure water potential device made by myself. Second, while plants are under water droughty stress, the relationship between leaf water potential and the other physiological parameters had been analyzed synthetically to determine the critical range (plants could endure limitary).<br><br> According to Kramer's theory, the pressure water potential device was designed and developed. Then twelve kinds of plants were tested. In addition, under the situation of controlled the soil water content by myself, the relative curves between leaf water potential and soil water content in plenty of plants were drawn. Furthermore, combining with transpiration rate and plasmolysis trend, the critical range had been analyzed and determined.<br><br> The data showed the gradients of decreasing water potentials clearly. While plants are under water droughty stress, the difference in potentials reducing gradually was discovered. A conclusion was made that the critical range was 0.1-0.2 Mpa from top to base of stem, relative water content (RWC) reduced to 24%-26%.<br><br> The results of experiments showed the xylem water potential had been measured accurately without any harm to plants. And the conclusions are close to plant's physiology in natural condition. What's more, the critical range can be used to determine the proper time to supply plants with water. Combing with the thermal pulser made by myself, the study is helpful to develop an automatic water supply device.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF BOWIE COUNTY SOIL SERIES ON SOYBEAN GROWTH
Elizabeth Catherine Bledsoe
Pleasant Grove Hight School, Texarkana, Texas, USA 

The effects of different soil samples on soybean growth in Bowie County, Texas were examined. Soil series were taken from thirty-five locations in Bowie County, Texas to determine which would yield the best growth. Soil samples and equal numbers of soybean seeds were placed in separate pots and subjected to the same growing conditions. It was hypothesized that the thirteen soils in Bowie County that were loamy and well drained would display the most growth. Plant growth was measured throughout the four week experiment. After comparing the final yield and plant conditions, evidence to support the hypothesis was not found. The soils that were more clay-like instead of loamy were found to grow the best.

MODERN LYCOPERSICON ESCULENTUM MILL CULTURES; A WAY TO OVERCOME HUMAN OVERPOPULATION PROBLEMS
Gustavo Antonio Rodriguez
Colegio De la Salle. Bayamon, Puerto Rico

Human population growth creates the need for high efficiency sowing in the least amount of time possible. Therefore, it is important to know what medium allows a better production of Lycopersicon esculentum Mill (tomato). It was hypothesized that if 30 plantlets of equal size are sowed, varying the medium only; then the plantlets in the hydroponic medium will show a better development. To test this hypothesis ten Lycopersicon esculentum Mill (tomato) plantlets were potted in three different mediums (vegetal compost, soil and hydroponic), two plants for per pot. Hydroponic growing medium consisted of a mixture of moss and Perlite. Nutrients added included Acetic acid, Magnesium sulfate, Calcium nitrate and Tomato formula 4-18-38 in water. Irrigation and light factors were kept constant for all the mediums. Plant height, stem diameter, quantity and size of tomatoes as well as flowering occurrence were recorded. Analyses of Variance (One-Way ANOVA) were performed to test for significant differences between sowing mediums for the variables measured. The media that evidenced a significantly better development was the hydroponic, thus the formulated hypothesis was accepted. <br><br>

EFFECTS OF MINT, CREPPING CHARLIE, AND MARIGOLD EXTRACTS ON AGROBACTERIUM TUMIFACIENS AND SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE.
Amber Elyse Hughes
Buean High School, Sierra Vista, Arizona, USA

First I decided to use Mint, Creeping Charlie, and Marigold extracts on Agrobacterium tumifaciens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae because these plants all showed to have certain anti-bacterial characteristics. The Agrobacterium tumifaciens is a tumor causing bacteria that attacks plants in the rose family, which just happens to be a large source of where our crops come from. Both Agrobacterium tumifaciens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were chosen because I was interested in seeing if the plant extracts would make a difference on either eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells. The broth and good were made up, measured with distilled water along with the plant extracts. After the tubes and liquids were sterilized, I then inoculated them with either Agrobacterium tumifaciens or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Both racks of forty tubes were incubator over night, and then twenty drops of Formaldehyde were added. The results were then gathered with a colorimeter. Each tubes liquid was placed into a clear block to go through the colorimeter. All of the results were collected and then averaged. To determine weather the results were correct or not, I did another test using agar instead of broth. The end results showed that the plants extracts did nothing to the growth of the bacteria on the agar. I think this is due to the fact, in the liquids the bacteria and plant extracts could float freely as if they would do so in the air.

THE EFFECT OF LAGUNCULARIA RACEMOSA (WHITE MANGROVE) BARK EXTRACTS ON INFECTIONS CAUSED BY STREPTOCOCCUS ORALIS, STREPTOCOCCUS PYOGENES, STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS AND E. COLI.
Abimael Cruz - Maldonado
Junior High School Luis Muñoz Marín

Believers in natural medicine use gargles of Laguncularia racemosa (White mangrove) to cure throat infections. The investigator considered that Laguncularia racemosa bark peelings extracts are effective in inhibiting the growth of Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli bacteria which are present in throat infections. This investigation was made with the pure extract and with three extract dilutions (1/10, 1/100 and 1/1000) of Laguncularia racemosa bark peelings. Each of these samples was then inoculated separately into a culture of each type of bacteria cultivated in a TSA medium. The results demostrated that only the pure extract of Laguncularia racemosa inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria; but there were no visible effects over Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Escherichia coli. The ivestigator intends to use, for future research, other varieties of mangrove as for example: Conocarpus erectus, Rhizophora mangle and Avicennia germinans to corroborate the inhibiting growth effects (if any) on these four and some other kind of bacteria.

RELATIONSHIPS AMONG ENVIRONMENT, DURATION AND NUTRIENTS USED IN THE ROOT INITIATION OF THE SOLANACEAE/SOLANUM TUBEROSUM (WHITE POTATO): PHASE III
Lee Ellen Carter
Central High School, Macon, Georgia, USA

I decided to use seven different rooting agents/solutions in Phase III on the plant propagation of the white potato (Solanaceae/Solanum Tuberosum). From the seven rooting agents/solutions used in this experiment, Auxin, B-1 vitamins, B-6 vitamins, coconut milk, Folic Acid, salt and the control-distilled water, I hypothesized that Auxin would be the most suitable agent to produce roots in the shortest amount of time on the cuttings.<br><br>I began the eperimentation by cutting twenty-one eyes off of the potatoes. After filling twenty-one small cups with 5 mL of fine sand, I placed the eyes half-way into the fine sand. I prepared the solutions by taking 1.2 grams of each hormone/chemical and vigorously stirring this into 500 mL of distilled water. Each of the seven agents were put into separate plastic containers and kept in a refrigerator. I fed every plant each day with their prospective rooting agent, and the productivity of each agent on the potato plant piece was recorded. After the plant cuttings began to grow roots, they were transported into small pots filled with potting soil. These plant pieces were fed with 10 mL of the same solution.<br><br>The conclusions, from three different tests, were that the B-1 solution propagated the majority of the potato pieces, with the aid of sand, soil and environment. The ingredients in this solution helped give the proper nutrients needed to propagate the small cuttings into new plants.<br><br>I conducted a watch glass experimentation with each of the seven solutions for a twenty-four hour period. I hypothesized that salt would have the highest evaporation rate; therefore, having an effect on the plant cuttings fed with the salt solution. I poured 5 mL of each solution into seven separate watchglasses, which were put in the exact location of the plants. After the twenty-four hour period, I concluded that the salt had evaporated, while residue was left on the other six watchglasses.

STUDIES ON THE PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS OF THE RED MANGROVE (RHIZOPHORA MANGLE) AERIAL ROOTS AT PUERTO MOSQUITO BAY, VIEQUES PUERTO RICO
Viviana Colon-Pagan
Casiano Cepeda High School, Rio Grande, Puerto Rico

Mangrove are trees that possess morphological and physiological adaptations specially suited to let them grow in salty overflowed grounds. The mangrove tree under study is the Red Mangrove (Rhizophora mangle). Its roots in stilts extend from the branches and the trunk to the water. This research intends to analyze the role of Red Mangroves aerial roots in tree oxygen flux. Does R. mangle aerial roots produce more oxygen when dry or wet? The hypothesis is that the aerial roots are more active in photosynthesis, while wet roots appear to be more active in cell respiration.<br><br> The experiments were performed at the Puerto Mosquito Bay Natural Reserve in Vieques, Puerto Rico. Four (4) stations were established and roots' oxygen intake measured at each station. Measurements were made using a Vernier Oxygen Sensor and a TI-83 silver plus graphic calculator.<br><br> Results showed that when wet, aerial roots are more active absorbing oxygen, but they also exhibit some oxygen release at a lower rate. The opposite is also true when the roots are dry. Further research is needed to fully describe the physiological mechanisms responsible for the switching in the roots' oxygen flux.

STUDY ABOUT THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF SOME TREES FROM PUERTO RICO TO THE PRESENCE OF TILLANDSIA RECURVATA ( BALL MOSS )
Zaimarie Varela - Class
Emilio R. Delgado , Corozal Pueto Rico

Tillandsia recurvata is an herbaceous epiphyte from the Bromeliaceous family.Its growth is very dense with fine and sharp leaves that twist themselves.This research dealt with the susceptibility of some trees to Tillandsia recurvata.It was expected that all susceptible trees to Tillandsia recurvata possessed a rugose bark.To develop this investigation information about Tillandsia recurvata and some trees from Puerto Rico was gathered.Research literature indicated that Tillandsia recurvata can destroy trees in a long term period.Field visits were made to find out what type of trees were susceptible to Tillandsia recurvata and then pictures were taken of them.The observations were summarized on charts.It was found that after studying thirty three (33) species of trees,chosen at random , fifteen (15) of them had smooth bark and plentiful foliage without the presence of Tillandsia recurvata.Eighteen (18) of the thirty three (33)species had Tillandsia recurvata on their branches and trunk.It was also found that those eighteen (18) trees had rugose bark.Three (3) of the eighteen (18) trees with Tillandsia recurvata were ''maga'' tree (Montezuma speciosissima) , ''ceiba'' (Ceiba pentandra) , and prickly palm (Acrocomia media).These trees are endangered species.Therefore it is necessary to do something about this plague before it destroys more trees.There are many countries that have special methods to eliminate Tillandsia recurvata but there's nothing similar in Puerto Rico to protect our trees.

POTENTIAL INSECTICIDAL ACTIVITY FOUND IN SPATHODEA CAMPANULATA FLOWER BUD
Julissa Raquel Gonzalez-Villegas
Sotero Figueroa Junior High School , San Juan, Puerto Rico

The use of plants as household remedies has been widely documented. Several researches have been developed for the search in plants of medicinal new sources as of substances to control plagues of economic importance. Spathodea campanulata is an ornamental tree with beautiful flowers and it is used in the landscape designing for wide areas. Although the tree is commonly used there's no special use recorded for the liquid inside its flower bud. This study pretended to find out if it is possible to use the liquid inside the Spathodea campanulata flower bud as an insecticide against Entom pterigota (common termite). Four concentrations were tested: pure, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, using water as solvent. Water was used as control. Each solution was applied to four (4) different plastic plates containing four (4) termites each in a simulated habitat. Tests were performed for each solution separately. Time of mortality, insect mortality and temperature were recorded for each test. Results demonstrated an inverted relationship between time of mortality and solution concentration; and a direct relationship between mortality percentage and solution concentration. The more concentrated the solution the less time of mortality and greater mortality percentage.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF ROSETTE AGE ON SURVIVAL AND FECUNDITY OF BOLTONIA DECURRENS, A THREATENED WETLAND SPECIES
Jessica Lynn Arnold
Edwardsville High School, Edwardsville Illinois, USA

The purpose of this project was to determine if the age of Boltonia decurrens rosettes affected their survival in the field. Fifty rosettes, grown from seed, were kept in a greenhouse. The mature rosettes were placed outside to maintain their health. A second group of 50 newly formed rosettes was collected. All vegetation was removed from a 6 m x 5 m plot at the Watershed Nature Center, and all rosettes were transplanted. Nine 5 m transects, .5 m apart, were marked. One year old rosettes were designated Group A 1-50, and newly formed rosettes were designated Group B 1-50. The rosettes from the two groups were planted alternately .5 meter apart. Wire cages, 15 cm x 15 cm x 6 cm were placed over the newly planted rosettes to prevent disturbance by animals. Cages were removed in April and survival of the plants was noted. Monitoring of the plant's height, health, flower production, and rosette production was completed monthly. Only 36% of Group A rosettes survived until October while 62% of the Group B plants survived. This was a significant difference as shown by the t-test. Rosette production between the two groups was almost equal although older plants produced rosettes earlier. Flower production data was incomplete. Therefore, introducing greenhouse cultivated B. decurrens into a natural environment does not appear to be an advantage in re-establishing this threatened plant in wetland areas.

PHYTOREMEDIATION OF TRICHLOROETHYLENE USING LEMNA GIBBA: PHASE II
Blake Robert Wilde
Fremont High School, Plain City, UT, US

As a result of historic dumping of solvents, a contaminated plume exists in the peripheral areas of Hill Air Force Base in Ogden, Utah. The superfund site is currently being remediated using the pump and treat method. There is a need for a primary method of treating seeps and springs. There is also a need for a secondary or tertiary method of treating groundwater. The main contaminant of concern is trichloroethylene (TCE), a possible carcinogen. Phytoremediation is the process of removing contaminants from the biosphere using plants and their associated microorganisms. Lemna gibba (duckweed) is a plant known to phytoremediate contaminants such as sewage, heavy metals, and explosive wastes. It is important to know the fate of phytoremediated xenobiotic contaminants in order to determine the contaminated plant’s effectiveness, risk, and quantifying it’s impact on the environment. The experiment focuses on identifying which type of phytoremediation occurs when Lemna gibba is applied to an aqueous solution containing TCE: phytovolatilization, phytoextraction, phytodegradation, and/or rhizofiltration. Headspace gas chromatography was used to test for phytoremediation and rhizofiltration. Plant tissue analysis using headspace gas chromatography was used to test for phytoextraction and phytovolatilization. Metabolite analysis using headspace gas chromatography was used to test for phytodegradation. All variables are controlled. Phytovolatilization occurred when Lemna gibba was applied to a spiked aqueous solution of TCE.

INVESTIGATION OF VERTICAL TRANSMISSION POTENTIAL OF CABBAGE LEAF CURL VIRUS: A THREE-YEAR STUDY
Rachel Lauren Zelkowitz
Lake Brantley High School, Altamonte Springs, FL, USA

The purpose of experimentation was to determine whether the wild-type strain of Cabbage Leaf Curl Virus could be transmitted vertically from the parent to the F1 generation in three species of plants. Four sets of 48 Fast Plants, two sets of twenty-four mustard tendergreen plants, and three sets of twenty-four kidney beans were planted and infected with CLCV using Bemesia argentifolia vectors. Presence of the virus was confirmed utilizing polymerase chain reaction and electrophoresis gel techniques. <br><br> All infected beans failed to produce seed. An assay utilizing mechanical inoculation with differing inoculums was performed to determine if seed production was contingent on inoculum source. Infected plants again failed to produce seed, suggesting that CLCV may interfere with the reproductive process of the bean. Seed from infected mustard tendergreens and Fast Plants was collected and planted to produce the F1 generation. Results show evidence of a 0% infection rate in the Fast Plant F1 generation, though statistical analysis indicates that this does not differ significantly from the infection rate in the parent generation. A search for the final repository of CLCV detected the virus in immature pod and seed tissue and mature pod tissue of mustard tendergreens. Statistical analysis suggests that there exists a significant difference between infection rates of mature and immature tissue. Additional research is being conducted both to further analyze this discrepancy and to locate other repositories of CLCV linked to reproduction (such as pollen). At present, no conclusions may be drawn concerning vertical transmission of CLCV. <br><br>

DETERMINATION OF THE MOST EFFICIENT CONSTRUCT FOR INSERTION OF THE GUSA GENE INTO BMS MAIZE CELLS: OPTIMIZING CONDITIONS FOR PROTEIN PRODUCTION IN TRANSGENIC SWEET MAIZE
A. Noel Suri
Harding High School, St Paul, MN, USA

Most research pertaining to the production of transgenic maize has involved animal feed maize, and little work has been done with sweet maize used for human consumption. Almost 30% of sweet maize, worth $600 million annually,is lost to diseases, pests, and herbicides, and it is imperative that mutants of sweet maize resistant to these destructive factors be identified. This study addresses that problem and, as a first step, attempts to determine the most appropriate construct for genetically modifying Black Mexican Sweet (BMS) maize cells. It compares the efficiency and effectiveness of 3 constructs of the pCambia series – 1301, 1301-35S, and 1301-Ubi – by determining the transient expression level of the reporter gene, gusA, contained in them. It was hypothesized that this gene would have the highest expression level in construct 1301. The procedure involved the preparation of MS2-D media for culturing BMS cells, addition of the antibiotic hygromycin, and preparation of 88 plates. DNA plasmids of the 3 constructs were then isolated from E.coli, and restriction digests carried out to confirm the identity of the plasmids. The constructs were then introduced into the BMS culture cells using biolistic bombardment (repeated 7 times/construct), and the expression of the GusA protein detected using 2 methods: histo-chemical staining, and GusA activity assay. Results of the histo-chemical staining indicated that the number of colonies of the maize cells using construct 1301 was 208% and 395% higher than the corresponding numbers for constructs 1301-35S and 1301-Ubi. Analysis of the GusA activity assay results indicated that the average rate of increase of the GusA protein in the BMS maize cells for construct 1301 was 236% and 1459% higher than that of 1301-35S and 1301-Ubi. Both results, therefore, indicated that construct 1301 had the highest concentration of the GusA protein, and, as a result, the highest expression of the gusA gene.

THE EFFECTS OF PRIMING ON VEGETABLE SEED GERMINATION
Kathryn Lyn Sanford
Wilson High School, West Lawn, PA, USA

The approach of this study was to evaluate the effect of priming on vegetable seed germination. Seeds spend a significant amount of time (lag time) absorbing water from the soil in order to begin the germination process. By priming seeds prior to planting, they were able to germinate earlier since the germination process was initiated but stopped before radical (primary root) emergence occurred by removing the seeds from the priming treatments. Seeds were then dried to near their original weight for storage until sowing. The method of priming used in this study utilized soaking the seeds for specified times to allow the germination process to begin. <br><br> The seed species used in this study included: Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato), Capsicum annuum (pepper), and Zea mays (corn). Three treatments were used in this research along with a control, which had no soaking period. These treatments included: polyethylene glycol (Peg8000®), Potassium Phosphate (KH2PO4), and distilled water, all used as a priming solutions at either 1, 3, or 5 day periods. The Peg8000® and potassium phosphate were used to supply seeds with nitrogen and other nutrients essential for protein synthesis during germination.<br><br> The general trend was that the distilled water priming and the Peg8000® priming, showed positive results by reducing the germination lag time once seeds were planted. The priming method used in this study is cost-effective and can enable technology deficient countries to use priming as an inexpensive way to enhance their crops. <br><br>

WHERE CORN GROWS
Jason Christopher Buss
Southeastern High School, Augusta, IL, USA

The purpose of this experiment is to determine which state soil grows corn the best. The state soil for each state will be used to determine the best soil for growing corn. The exhibitor hypothesized that Washington’s state soil will grow corn the best due to its continuous high rankings for yield over the last several years.<br><br> To perform the test, soil samples were gathered by sending letters to each state requesting a one gallon sample of each state’s soil. After obtaining the samples the experiments were conducted; three separate growth tests were performed with two plants in a four inch pot for each soil sample received. Leaf collar, height, and biomass of each plant were then measured.<br><br> The exhibitor concluded that the state with the best state soil for growing corn is Indiana. Indiana was the only state to have an average biomass over 3g. So, Indiana has the best soil, given the local conditions. Other environmental factors will effect how well the soil can grow corn in its natural environment.<br><br>

NEED WEED?
Howard Keith Bynum
Andrews High School, Andrews, Texas, USA

The purpose of my experiment is to determine if the aquatic Spiny Naiad (Najas marinas), is capable of being both food and fertilizer. The experiment involved invertebrate earthworms and vertebrate goldfish being fed pondweed. Fish received pondweed, a mix of fish food and pondweed, and fish food only. The worms were fed pondweed, a mix of pondweed and cornmeal, and only cornmeal. The study is to determine which subsets of animals gained the most weight after several weeks. The fertilization process was to determine if the Najas marinas has any effect on the growth of Winter Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The results showed that the goldfish lost weight: Spiny Naiad Fish 29.4 grams, Half and Half was 32.1 grams, and the control at 33.2 grams, which shows that the Spiny Naiad is not suitable as goldfish food. The earthworm results were: Cornmeal only at 30.9 grams, half and half 31.9 grams, and pondweed only at 32.5 grams; therefore a suitable food supplement for the worms. The wheat showed excellent results. Group I: average height of the two tanks that received 5 grams of Spiny Naiad was 28.7 cm, 2.5 grams of Spiny was 25.9 cm, and with no Naiad was only 17.7 cm. Group II showed heights in respective groups of: 27.5 cm, 21.6 cm, and 18.1 cm. Lab analysis showed Naiad high in Calcium (29.26%), Zinc (959ppm) and Iron (619ppm). Clearly, Spiny Naiad has definite future possibilities for harvesting and using as a plant fertilizer.

PROPAGATING ORCHIDS THROUGH NATURAL METHODS
Pita Malota Gurr
Leone High School, Pago Pago, American Samoa

The purpose of my project, "Propagating Orchids Through Natural Methods", was to experiment with various methods of propagating dendrobium orchids to determine if orchids could be reproduced naturally.<br><br>For years, I have been growing orchids in our family's greenhouse, propagating them through laboratory methods. I wanted to discover a simpler method of multiplying orchids so that my experiment could be replicated by a novice grower.<br><br>After researching orchid propagation methods, I carried out three experiments. For experiment I, I removed leafless orchid canes from plants growing in our greehouses, and placed them on a table. Keikis (small orchid plants) began to grow on the canes, and I cut the cane between keikis and planted them into pots of clean, crushed, volcanic rock.<br><br>For experiment II, I propagated orchids by separating them when they became overcrowded in their pots. I cut the rotted and aerial roots to two inches, dipped the roots in a solution, and planted the orchids into pots filled with volcanic rocks.<br><br>For experiment III, I propagated orchids with a full cane and a single keiki at the end. If the canes developed a single keiki at the end of it, I planted the entire cane and keiki into a pot of volcanic rocks.<br><br>I repeated experiment I 476 times; experiment II, 900 times; and experiment II, 847 times.<br><br>From the three experiments I conducted, 95-100% of the orchids survived. I was able to prove my hypothesis was correct: dendrobium orchids can be grown through natural methods.

Chen Ling
Jincai Senior High School, senior three, Shanghai, China

Objective: To prove the effects of portulaca on anti-aging in fruit flies and mice respectively and to prove the possible causes of portulaca's good effect on anti-aging.<br><br> Methods: In this experiment, fruit flies and mice were divided into portulaca group and the control group respectively for observing their life-span and testing some physiological functions and biochemical parameters which are closely related to life-span, such as cold-resistance, heat-resistance, the flying ability, SOD activity, and Lipofuscin, etc.<br><br> Results: (1) The life-span of the fruit flies was longer, the death rate in the cold (or heat) condition and the level of Lipofuscin of the fruit flies were lower, and the SOD activity of the fruit flies was higher in the purtulaca group than that of those in the control group (p<0.05). (2) The time of rod climbing was longer, the level of Lipofuscin in liver and brain was lower, and the SOD activity in liver and brain of the mice was higher in the portulaca group than that of those in the control group (p<0.05).<br><br> Conclusion: The result of experiments suggested that feeding portulaca could improve the above functions of fruit flies and mice. And portulaca also could result in a good effect on anti-aging. Whether it has the same effect on human beings depends on further study.<br><br>

FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS: AN OPTIMIZED METHOD FOR FLUORESCENT TAGGING OF FULL-LENGTH GENE PRODUCTS OF UNKNOWN FUNCTION FROM ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA
Michelle Louie
Kings Park High School, Kings Park, New York, United States of America

Arabidopsis thaliana is a model system in botany. Increasing what is known will lead to enhanced productivity in plants of economic and cultural importance and provide fundamental knowledge. <br><br> Although the genome of Arabidopsis has been successfully sequenced, the function and intercellular location of the gene products remains unknown. The purpose of this project was to establish an optimized protocol for fluorescent gene tagging to study the intracellular localization and function of the proteins in Arabidopsis. The establishment of a refined protocol will enable systematic characterization on a large scale.<br><br> Fluorescent Tagging of Full-Length Gene Products (FTFLP) focuses on proteins of unknown function, tags them internally, and utilizes the native gene regulatory sequences. FTFLP constitutes (1) selection of a functionally unassigned gene, (2) prediction of its protein structure, selection of fluorescent tag insertion site, (3) amplification in two parts, (4) introduction of fluorescent tag, (5) bombardment of gene into plant tissue, (6) analysis of expression patterns and localization. The subcellular distribution of a protein is used to determine its role in the cell. <br><br> The protocol was generated and tested with the gene, At1g07040 and control construct, TY2. After FTFLP was conducted, gel electrophoresis confirmed that products of the correct size were generated, indicating that At1g07040 was successfully isolated, amplified, purified, and tagged with YFP. The control construct was bombarded into onion plant tissue and localized in the plasma membrane, indicating involvement in intracellular transport. <br><br> An optimized protocol was developed consistent with the goals of this project and the principles of functional genomics. To date, this protocol has never been performed elsewhere in the world. <br><br>

FRUIT QUALITY OF PRUNUS PERSICA (L.) BATSCH TREES INOCULATED WITH PEACH LATENT MOSAIC VIROID
Duy Duc Nguyen
Governor's School for Science and Math, Hartsville,South Carolina, United States

Surveys indicated that consumers would be willing to pay more for better fruit quality in stone fruits such as peaches. Coronet peach trees [Prunus persica (L.) Batsch] inoculated with Peach Latent Mosaic Viroid were shown in past studies to increase fruit yield. The objective of this study was to find out whether it also increased fruit quality. Results showed no significant differences existed for weight and % soluble solid content between PLMVd-inoculated fruits and non-inoculated fruits. Significant differences were found for firmness, pH, and acidity. The titratable acidity was higher whereas the pH was lower for PLMVd-inoculated fruits. Firmness was also better for PLMVd-inoculated Coronet peaches. Furthermore, it took four days longer for PLMVd-inoculated fruit to go from commercial ripe to soft ripe than the non-inoculated fruit giving farmers more time to pick their fruits. Initial results indicated that PLMVd-inoculated Coronet peaches did have better fruit quality than the non-inoculated control peaches.

THE EFFECTS OF CYTOSKELETAL DISRUPTING AGENTS IN GOSSYPIUM HIRSUTUM
Carol Margaret Eisenstat
John F. Kennedy High School, Merrick, NY, USA

This research examines whether the manipulation of cytoskeletal elements during the cotton fiber initiation phase of ovule development in Gossypium hirsutum can result in increases in fiber production. Cytoskeletal disrupting and stabilizing agents can either promote or interfere with cytoskeletal function. The application of taxol, a microtubule stabilizing and promoting agent, to developing ovules resulted in a significant increase in fiber number early in development, but this increase was not sustained to the termination of the experiment. Application of oryzalin, a microtubule disrupting agent, resulted in a significant decrease in fiber production. Taken together, these data are consistent with the hypotheses that proper function of microtubules is required for cotton fiber production and that there is a narrow “window of opportunity” during fiber initiation when fiber production can be increased. Disruption of microfilaments in fiber, through the application of cytochalasin, results in the largest reduction in fiber production. This provides the first evidence that microfilaments, in addition to microtubules may play a role in determining which epidermal cells will become cotton fiber. Results from these experiments indicate that fiber production can be increased using techniques (pharmacological or molecular) that augment cytoskeletal element in developing cotton ovules.

INOCULATION STUDIES WITH GAEUMANNOMYCES GRAMINIS VARIETY GRAMINIS ON ZOYSIAGRASS VARIETIES
Alexander Kenneth Biholar
Plano Senior High School, Plano TX, United States of America

The first objective was to determine an effective single leaf assay of Gaeumannomyces graminis variety graminis (Ggg) that produces comparable results to the ectotrophic root infecting fungus (ETRI) assay. The second objective was to identify a variety of Zoysiagrass that has a genetic resistance to Ggg. <br><br> <br><br> The ETRI assay consisted of inoculating 28 Zoysiagrass varieties with Ggg, and allowing the fungus to grow for 23 days before looking at each cleaned plant under a stereoscope to determine the extent of the Ggg growth. The single leaf assay was performed by placing eight leaves of each of the 28 varieties into a container of water agar amended with Streptomycin Sulfate and mixed Ggg inoculant. Measurements of the disease growth were taken at four, seven, and 44-days.<br><br> <br><br> All methods showed variety J-36 as being resistant to Ggg. The results produced in the four and seven-day single leaf assays were too erratic in order to be used as an effective assay, however the 44-day assay showed comparable results to the ETRI assay. <br><br> <br><br> The single leaf assay will benefit researchers, by providing a technique that effectively produces results comparable to the ETRI assay while reducing the physical testing space and cost of performing an assay of Zoysiagrasses.<br><br> <br><br> Planting Zoysiagrass variety J-36 will reduce the number of fungicidal applications required to control its growth in the long run and provide an effective, environmentally safe, and inexpensive means of Ggg control.<br><br><br><br><br>

AN ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF VARIOUS NITRATE LEVELS ON PLANT TISSUE CULTURES
Ryan Richard Brock
Lakeview High School , Columbus NE, USA

To test the effect of various nitrate concentrations on the viability of plant tissue cultures, many tests will be performed. The goal was the optimum concentration of nitrates for certain plants being cultured. The results of these tests may then be related to genetic engeneering in attempts to decrease the time required for cultures to grow and new generations formed. <br><br> The results expected were that the plants would show an increase in growth as nitrates were added until a certain concentration was reached. Beyond that concentration, the plant cultures’ growth was expected to decrease as the nitrates become overly concentrated and begin to burn the plants.<br><br> Learning sterile technique was necessary, as any contamination in the cultures could affect the tests’ results. Seeds were sterilized by flaming the pods. The seeds were then removed and transplanted onto growing media. The media, jars, and culture tubes were sterilized using an autoclave, and tools were sterilized with a bacti-cinerator. <br><br> The media was mixed by adding nitrate solutions in place of distilled water. Plants were transplanted from their growing jars into individual tubes for testing. Changes in height and chlorophyll were recorded. The plants were removed from the tubes and the second tallest viable leaf was removed for chlorophyll reading. <br><br> In conclusion, plants with lower levels of nitrates showed better growth than those without nitrates and those with higher nitrate concentrations. The exact level for optimum growth is yet undiscovered. Further testing may show more accurate figures as to that concentration.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF ELEVATED CARBON DIOXIDE TENSION ON THE PRODUCTION OF L - ASCORBIC ACID IN BRASSICA RAPA
Mei Ling Liu
Saginaw Arts and Sciences Academy, Saginaw, Michigan, USA

The purpose of this project, "The Effects of Elevated Carbon Dioxide Tension on the Production of Ascorbic Acid in Brassica rapa", is to test to see whether different concentrations of carbon dioxide affect L ¨C ascorbic acid production. Based on the previous researches, I hypothesize increased concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will increase the quantity of L ¨Cascorbic acid plants produce. However, if the carbon dioxide concentrations are too high, it would have adverse effect on the plants, instead of a positive effect. Additionally, the effects of different concentrations of oxygen have been tested for the production of L ¨C ascorbic acid. <br><br> Data indicates Brassica rapa that are grown in the 1000, 3200, and 10000 ppm of carbon dioxide environment produce a greater quantity of L ¨C ascorbic acid, compared to the other plants that are grown in the normal room temperature. Evaluating the average heights of a group of Brassica rapa that grown in the different environments, statistic test indicates the plant heights were not significantly different (p> 0.05). <br><br>

THE INCREASE OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY WITH AN INCREASE IN CHLOROPHYLL IN PANICUM VIRGATUM (SWITCHGRASSS)
Jordan Leigh Costello
Hamilton High School, Chandler, Arizona USA

The purpose of my experiment was to find a way to decrease the cost and increase the efficiency of biomass as a means of alternative energy. It was hypothesized that through a feeding of a chlorophyll and water mixture, switchgrass would be able to produce more energy. To do this, 3 groups were tested: grasses watered with 0%, 10%, and 25% chlorophyll concentrations. After germination, one of the two pails of the 10% and 25% chlorophyll concentration grasses was not given chlorophyll anymore, but only water to try to increase cost efficiency. After the first phase, the grass was put in an oxygen bomb calorimeter to determine the amount of energy that each group of grass produced. I concluded that the grass given the chlorophyll greatly increased its energy yield: comparable from 3 to 6 times the amount of the grass fed without the chlorophyll mixture. This proves that altering switchgrass can increase the amount of energy produced and subsequently decrease the cost of this form of energy.

LOCATION OF GENES INFLUENCING WAX COATINGS ON BARLEY SPIKE TISSUE
Megan Marie Wolf
Mandan High School, Mandan, ND USA

There are more than 1000 morphological marker genes identified in barley and less than half have been located to chromosome. Only a small portion of that half has been mapped to a specific chromosome sight.<br><br>This study was conducted to determine whether or not markers in barley are actually different markers or if they are the same marker expressing a different allele. Markers first had to be morphologically and molecularly linked and then screened to determine their placement on the Barley chromosomes.<br><br>The first step was to score the F2 plants growing. To obtain the molecular markers DNA Extraction procedures were preformed. Then they were used to prepare a PCR template for each sample. Once the PCR was finished with its cycles gel electrophoresis was done. Pictures were taken so the gels could be scored and compared with the morphological markers. <br><br>Loose linkage was found with two populations: cer-zt and cer-zb. Cer-zt is located within 30.3 cM of Bmag0134 and cer-zb is located within 48.5 cM within Bac0113. None of these morphological genes had been previously mapped in barley chromosomes. Once this linkage was found it was determined that the markers are in fact separate markers.This information will to be helpful to geneticists as they manipulate genes to develop barley with improved agronomic and quality traits. <br><br>

EFFECTS OF NITRATE ON THE CIRCADIAN PHOTOSYNTHETIC RHYTHM IN CYANOTHECE SP. PCC 8801, A UNICELLULAR DIAZOTROPHIC CYANOBACTERIUM
Uan-Chen Yen
The Affiliated Senior High School of NKNU,Kaoshiung, Taiwan

Cyanothece sp. PCC 8801 is a unicellular, photosynthetic and diazotrophic cyanobacterium. It is also the first prokaryote shown to exhibit circadian rhythm which consists of photosynthetic and nitrogen-fixing oscillations. Although it has be known that the photosynthetic and nitrogen-fixing rhythms are temporally separated, very little is explored about their possible interactions or causal relationships between these two systems. In the current studies, a growth chamber equipped with a dissolved-oxygen (DO) meter was used to continuously and automatically record the DO variation in the culture. The data clearly indicated that, in the nitrate-rich medium, there were similar diurnal and circadian photosynthetic rhythms in Cyanothece sp. PCC 8801 as well as in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, a non-nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium. In the nitrate-free medium, however, Cyanothece sp. PCC 8801 presented a different DO pattern, which included a circadian respiration rhythm in the dark period. When nitrate, an inhibitor of nitrogen fixation, was added into the medium, the diurnal respiration rhythm disappeared and the diurnal photosynthetic rhythm was significantly affected. Moreover, the circadian photosynthetic rhythm was also suppressed. These results reveal that there is a strong correlation between the rhythms of photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation in Cyanothece sp. PCC 8801.

THE PESTICIDAL ATTRIBUTES OF NOXIOUS WEEDS
Andrew John Friskop
Hankinson High School, Hankison, ND

PURPOSE: To determine if the flowers of noxious weeds can be beneficial to the agricultural industry. Also, to observe the potential usage of the flowers as an antifungal agent and naturally safe insecticide.<br><br>PROCEDURES: Collected three different types of weed flowers (Curly Cup Gumweed, Perennial Snow Thistle, and Canadian Thistle) along with two chemicals (Servin insecticide and Mancozeb fungicide). Weed dilutions and chemical application rates were then prepared.<br><br>TEST PLOT STUDY: Chose a 15x65 foot area to conduct a three-month wheat test plot study to apply solutions onto an acual agricultural environment and then analyze the plants for their physical attributes and agricultural value.<br><br>PATHOGEN STUDY: Tested five types of weed flower extractions (Water, Enthonal, Methanol, Acetone, and Alkaloid) on fungal pathogens' growth. Additionally, tested the water extractions' abilities to fend off attacks of Stagonospora nodorum on wheat plants. <br><br>INSECT STUDY: Completed two tests in this study to directly and indirectly observe the actual impact of the natural solutions on meal worms, red flour beetles, and the Indian meal moth larvae.<br><br>ENVIRONMENTAL STUDY: Observed the effects of the solutions on beneficial annelids (night crawlers and wonder worms), and also on the soil nutrient levels. <br><br>CONCLUSION: After observing all aspects of this research study, I found that Curly Cup Gumweed was the superior solution. In addition several aspects of the project were found to possess statistical significance. Overall, I feel that the flowers of noxious weeds can be used as a safe and effective alternative to commercial pesticides.

ACCELERATING THE FAST PLANTS
Andrea Dawn Melcher
Northwestern High School, Kokomo, Indiana, United States

The purpose of the project was to determine the optimum balance of humidity and soil pH for the growth of Wisconsin Fast Plants. The effect on growth was observed by growing some plants in a room with average humidity (61-64%) and some in a room with higher humidity (73-76%). In each of these locations there were plants grown in soil treated with lime to reach a pH of at least 8.0, acidic soil treated with acid rain from sulfuric acid to reach a maximum pH of 6.0, and untreated soil that was approximately neutral. A highly significant difference was found for the height of the acidic and high humidity test group (t-test=4.20>t0.001=3.646), as well as for the stem diameter (t-test=7.925>t0.001=3.690) and the number of leaves (t-test=3.35>t0.01=2.750). The high humidity with untreated soil group showed significant results in height (t-test=2.10>t0.05=2.042) and in stem diameter (t-test=2.19>t0.05=2.048) and highly significant results in number of leaves (t-test=4.51>t0.001=3.646). High humidity/basic results were significant in height (t-test=2.44>t0.05=2.042) and highly significant in number of leaves (t-test=3.61>t0.01=2.750). The average humidity and acidic soil results were significantly different for average number of leaves (t-test=2.67>t0.05=2.042). All of the significant t-test results were lower than that of the control and were reinforced by the yellow-green appearance of the high humidity plants and the brown color of their cells. Therefore, deviation from neutral soil and average humidity does not accelerate or improve the growth of Wisconsin Fast Plants in any of the measured parameters.

THE EFFECT OF ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION ON PLANT GROWTH
Kimberly Renee Hardeman
Lewis County High School, Vanceburg, KY, USA

Electromagnetic fields are found everywhere on the Earth; some are natural and others are man-made. These fields may inhibit or influence plant growth. It is believed that by increasing the strength of electromagnetic fields that surround plants, plant growth will increase. This experiment was designed to either prove or refute the hypothesis. Through the process of growing numerous corn plants and changing the voltage of each plant's electromagnetic field, the researcher has came to the conclusion that plants grow best within their own natural fields and without any extra outside influence. The data showed that Plant Five, which had no artificial field, grew the most, while Plant Four, which had the highest strength of electromagnetic field of six volts, grew the least. Thus refuting the researcher's hypothesis.

THE EFFECT OF NACL STRESS ON THE GROWTH OF TOMATO PLANTS
Crystal Monique Richardson
Massaponax High School, Fredsericksburg VA, United States

The purpose of this experiment is to see the reaction of various amounts of a NaCl solution on the height and growth of tomato plants. The three levels used in this experiment are 0% NaCl solution, 5% NaCl solution and 10% NaCl solution. In the experiment height will be measured along with other qualitative measurements in a series of observations. The NaCl solutions were made by mixing water with 0%, 5% and 10% table salt in the solutions. The solutions were put in each of the eight trials. After the solution was put in the trials from that point on no more of the solution was added and the tomato plants were watered normally. By the end of nine days all of the plants that were exposed to the NaCl solution had died. The plants that grew the tallest were the control plants (0% NaCl solution). The plants that were next in height were the 5% NaCl solution. The plants that grew the least were the 10% NaCl solution. My hypothesis was proved wrong because I predicted that only half of the 5% tomato plants would die and all of the 5 %NaCl plants died. I also thought that because the plants continued to be watered normally, instead of applying the NaCl solution daily, then it would not have such a great effect on the plants.

METHODOLOGY OF PHYTOMINING BY GROWING AVENA SATIVA AND MEDICAGO SATIVA TO NUCLEATE GOLD NANOPARTICLES FOR NANOAPPLICATIONS
Rachael Ann Scott
N.W.M.H.E.A., Como, MS, USA

This experiment created gold nanoparticles in an environmentally friendly methodology through the use of phytomining. The objective of this study was to determine if easily grown crop plant cultivars, Avena sativa (oat) and Medicago sativa (alfalfa), could uptake and sequester gold nanoparticles. <br><br> The mining process uses harsh chemicals to extract gold from the ore and does not recover 100% of the gold. The ions of gold are wasted because they are too small to mine. The gold mixed with chloride or cyanide leaches into the soil around the tailings causing pollution. <br><br> All together, I grew 150 Avena sativa and 390 Medicago sativa for two weeks. For a comparison, I had a control to observe if the plants grown in the gold chloride saturated soil died, had stunted growth, or any ill effects at all. They both had the same germination and appearance, except those treated with the solution had a slightly faster growth rate. The HAu(III)Cl 3H O rich environment simulated contaminants in the tailings from a mine. <br><br> I performed my tests at the USDA. I prepared 12 plant specimen slides using silver staining reagent. The reagent increased the size of the gold 100-500 fold. I observed the gold in the root vascular system of the plants grown with HAu(III)Cl 3H O. The gold was stored in the plant cell's vacuoles.<br><br> This methodology inexpensively mines economically important elements while ridding the soil of contaminants. It needs further studies to determine all the possible applications of the gold nanoparticles.

The Effects of Genetic Modification with the Bt Gene on Corn's Ability to Resist Disease<br><br>Flemmig, Emma L.<br><br>Glidden-Ralston Community School, Glidden, IA<br><br> <br><br> The purpose of my project is to determine if genetic modification with the Bt gene will affect corn’s (Zea mays) ability to resist disease. The disease used for the experiment was Northern Corn Leaf Blight (Exserohilum turcicum). <br><br> My research was conducted in a field. There were fifteen varieties of conventional seed corn planted. Fifteen more varieties were planted; these fifteen were the exact same varieties as the other fifteen with only one difference: genetic modification with the Bt gene. Two rows of all thirty varieties were planted. One row of each variety was separate and served as the control group. The other thirty rows were inoculated with Northern Corn Leaf Blight.<br><br> I measured the plants’ lesions from the leaf blight. At harvest, I measured each row’s weight and moisture level. I found the average surface area damage and yield for each variety. I used this data to compare the Bt varieties to the conventional varieties. <br><br> The data I collected showed no significant patterns of damage. Some Bt varieties had higher yields and less surface area damage than the conventional varieties; some conventional varieties had higher yields and less surface area damage than the Bt varieties. Overall, some groups of similar varieties showed more resistance to the leaf blight than others.<br><br>

TRANSLATABILITY OF GENE FUNCTION BETWEEN PLANT SPECIES: FROM ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA TO NICOTIANA TABACUM
Moriah Katherine Nachbaur
Crystal Springs Uplands School, Hillsborough CA, USA

To investigate the conservation of gene function among plant species, the translatability of two, morphology-governing genes, BREVIPEDICELLUS LIKE (BPL) and NO APICAL DOMINANCE (NAD), was examined. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana lines overexpressing the BPL gene exhibit dwarfism and short flower pedicles; lines overexpressing the NAD gene display reduced apical dominance. In a previous year,a new, in-vitro transformation protocol was developed from a published method and used to introduce the overexpressed Arabidopsis BPL and NAD genes into Nicotiana tabacum. This year, the phenotypes of these T1 generation transformants were examined, and transgene expression was verified through RT-PCR analysis. The expected, Mendelian inheritance of these transgenes was confirmed through Chi-square assessment of T2 generation seedlings. Overexpressing the Arabidopsis BPL and NAD genes in Nicotiana tabacum produces stable, heritable, architectural effects similar to those found in the analogous Arabidopsis thaliana overexpression lines. Such translatability suggests that comparable genetic mechanisms regulate plant morphology in evolutionarily divergent species. The preliminary results of this project contribute to the growing evidence that Arabidopsis phenotypes are translatable to other flowering plants, validate the specific use of Arabidopsis thaliana as a model species, and demonstrate that Nicotiana tabacum may be a useful second species in which to investigate other Arabidopsis lead genes.

ABSTRACT SEPARATING PHOTOSYNTHETIC PIGMENTS USING CHROMATOGRAPHY
Zachery Lemuel Goad
Heizer Freshman School, Hobbs, New Mexico, US

Plants are important because they take carbon dioxide and water and change them into oxygen and chemical energy in a process called photosynthesis. In order to photosynthesize, they must capture the sun's energy to use as its own. The leaves of plants have a variety of pigments to absorb the energy of the sun. Different pigments are able to capture the different wavelengths of light. Chromatography is a method used to separate these different photosynthetic pigments found in leaves.

DOES BURNING MATTER?: PHASE II THE EFFECT OF POST-HARVEST BURING ON SUGARCANE YIELDS UNDER STRESSFUL CONDITIONS
Tate Benton-Michael Guillotte
Catholic High School, New Iberia, Lousisiana, USA

The purpose of this project is to determine if post-harvest burning will increase sugarcane yields. Combine harvesting was introduced to Louisiana farmers in 1995. The combine cuts the cane into small sections called billets. The billets along with the leaves are then placed on a slatted elevator chain. When the cane and the leaves reach the top of the elevator, an extractor fan remove the leaves from the billets and blow them onto the harvested field. The billets then fall off the elevator and into the loading wagon. It was hypothesized that the unburned patch with lime would have higher nutrient levels in the soil, higher average soil temperature, higher pre-harvest yield estimates, and higher test numbers at the mill compared to the burned patch. To test the hypothesis, he selected a patch and divided it into four sections. He burned one half and did not burn the other half of the patch. Following the burn, the experimenter fertilized one-half of both the burned and unburned sections. He then conducted four experiments. In the first experiment, he took soil samples from each patch and compared the nutrient levels. In the second, the experimenter measured the average soil temperature during a twenty-four hour period in each of the four sections. In the third, he conducted a pre-harvest yield estimate to determine the average stalk population, the average sugar content, the average sugar per acre, and the average tons per acre of each patch. In the fourth experiment, the experimenter harvested each patch and hauled the sugarcane to the mill for sugar extraction. Then he compared the mill's test data for each patch.<br><br>The first experiment supported the hypothesis, but the second, third, and fourth experiments did not support the hypothesis. The experimenter concluded that post-harvest burning does not increase sugarcane yields and lime application does increase sugarcane yields.

A STATISTICAL VALIDATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DORU TAENIATUM (GOLDEN-WINGED EARWIG) AND HARMONIA AXYRIDIS (ASIAN LADYBIRD BEETLE) AS BIOLOGICAL CONTROLS OF SIPHA FLAVA
Scott Brian Perry
Wellington Community High School, Wellington, Florida, USA

This project was designed to see which predator the Doru taeniatum (Golden-Winged Earwig) or the Harmonia axyridis (Asian Ladybird) is the more effective predator of Sipha flava (Yellow Sugarcane Aphid). The results of this project will help growers determine which one is the more effective natural biological control.<br><br> The project used statistics to analyze the data during the testing period, which included about 18 days of data collection. T-tests were done to determine different bits of information about the three different test plant subjects: aphids without predators, aphids and earwigs, and aphids and ladybirds. The different groups were also compared in a two sample t-test. This test allowed for a statistical comparison of the similarity or dissimilarity of the different applications. A Waller-Duncan Multiple Mean Separation Test was also performed, which coincided with the t-tests. Through analysis of the findings the research proved that the two biological controls were very similar to each other in terms of the amount of aphids on a plant on any given day. Also, the two biological controls were nothing similar to the plants without any predators on them at all.<br><br> By determining the differences or similarities of the three test groups the researcher was able to conclude that the biological controls were effective. This knowledge helps support the theory of rearing and releasing these natural biological controls out into the wild. This project, therefore, has important application to commercial growers.<br><br>

ADAPTATIONS OF PLANTS TO DROUGHT IN THE TROPICAL DECIDUOUS DRY FOREST AT ESTERO DEL YUGO, MAZATLAN SINALOA, MEXICO
Julia Edith Briones Tirado
Centro de Bachillerato Tecnologico Industrial y de Services No. 51, MEXICO

How does a tropical forest resist from seven to eight months iwthout water? When water is limited resource, nature is capable to make some extraordinary adaptations to correct problem. The tropical deciduous dry forest has different characteristics, but it generally grows in places where there is a warm tropical eather, it is called shot forest because it has from eight to twelve meters of height. It is called deciduous because the main characteristic of this form of adaptation, the trees drop their leaves during the dry period, but the raining season comes the leaven starts to grow again. The lost of leaves is the most visible to water scarcity, but it is not the only one. All the tree components like roots, flowers, leaves and other, have to have mechanisms to save water, this is to conserve and preserve life. This investitation project has a purpose, to create and ecological conscience, because this special type of forest is unknown, not only in Mexico, all over the world it has been destroyed, and it is in danger of extinction, because with do not understand the meaning of it. Learning to value this diversity of plants and animals that live in this forest, and also the adaptation efforst that they make to keep existing all over the year, will teach us to preserve them for our future.

PLANT TISSUE CULTURING
Randy William Hudson, Justin Tyler Whitlatch
Meigs High School, Pomeroy, Ohio, United State of America

The purpose of this project was to determine, when culturing Venus Flytraps and Boston Ferns under identical conditions, which plant will have a higher success rate in terms of growth and production. Tissues of Venus Flytraps and Boston Ferns were cultured in solid Murashige mediums and in liquid Murashige mediums. The experiments were preformed in a hortizontal laminar flow hood in the tissue culture lab. In solid Murashige mediums, Venus Flytraps were more successfully cloned and more successful in mass production of the plant than the Boston Ferns. However, the Boston Ferns had a much higher success rate in the liquid Murashige medium than in the solid medium. The results of the present research has significant economic value in horticulture. The tissue culture method produced large amounts of healthy plants rapidly, which was demonstrated in the actual mass production of both plants for sale in a fund-raising project at the school.

TRANSLOCATION OF MRNA THROUGH GRAFTING GLYCINE MAX
Laura Denise Johnson, Angelica K. Liu
Upper Arlington High School, Upper Arlington OH, United States of America

This study investigated if Glycine max, soybeans, have extracellular translocation of mRNA from the rootstock to the grafted scion and if so, whether the genetic material would influence the phenotypic or genotypic traits of the subsequent leaves and seeds. By grafting soybean plants that have unique characteristic, this study was able to determine if certain traits translocated to the scion thus indicating movement of genetic material. These varieties included xanthophyll deficient- lacking the xanthophyll protein; food grade- large, white hilum beans; field grade (conventional)- small, black hilum beans; and Round-up Ready- resist to the Round Up herbicide. <br><br> <br><br>230 grafts were made over the course of six month; 120 of which were for seed production and the remaining 110 were used for leaf growth. The hypothesis was; mRNA and genetic material can be translocated from the rootstock of a soybean plant to a grafted scion. The null hypothesis stated the translocation would not occur.<br><br><br>The hypothesis was accepted, the null was rejected, since the conventional scions on food grade plants produced seeds with hilum color and size consistent with the traits of the food grade plants. This implies a phenotypic change. <br><br> <br><br>This information can be applies in the ever-growing world of genetic research; and can help lay the foundation for the developing field of genetic engineering, more specifically mRNA translocation. This study will be extended to study more proteins and traits to gain a more comprehensive understand of how substances, especially genetic material, moves through the body of a plant<br><br>

TRANSLOCATION OF MRNA THROUGH GRAFTING GLYCINE MAX
Laura Denise Johnson, Angelica K. Liu
Upper Arlington High School, Upper Arlington OH, United States of America

This study investigated if Glycine max, soybeans, have extracellular translocation of mRNA from the rootstock to the grafted scion and if so, whether the genetic material would influence the phenotypic or genotypic traits of the subsequent leaves and seeds. By grafting soybean plants that have unique characteristic, this study was able to determine if certain traits translocated to the scion thus indicating movement of genetic material. These varieties included xanthophyll deficient- lacking the xanthophyll protein; food grade- large, white hilum beans; field grade (conventional)- small, black hilum beans; and Round-up Ready- resist to the Round Up herbicide. <br><br> <br><br>230 grafts were made over the course of six month; 120 of which were for seed production and the remaining 110 were used for leaf growth. The hypothesis was; mRNA and genetic material can be translocated from the rootstock of a soybean plant to a grafted scion. The null hypothesis stated the translocation would not occur.<br><br><br>The hypothesis was accepted, the null was rejected, since the conventional scions on food grade plants produced seeds with hilum color and size consistent with the traits of the food grade plants.

GERMINATION OF ASPHODELUS BENTO-RAINHAE UNDER DIFFERENT CONDITIONS CONTRIBUTION TO ITS PRESERVATION
David Jose Ascensao Filipe, Ana Gomes Barata
Escola Secundaria com 3o Ciclo do Fundao, Portugal

Asphodelus bento-rainhae is an exclusive endematic of Serra da Gardunha being first described by A. R. Pinto da Silva in 1956. In what concerns its status of conservation it is considered to follow the criterion of UINC (1994) which classifies it as an area of an occurrence inferior to 5000 Km2 and an area of occupation inferior to 500 Km2, in a unique place. It is not surprising then it is mentioned as a priority in the II suplement of Habitats Directive.<br><br>For this investigation the seeds of the plant have been subjected to different conditions where the controlled variable was the temperature. The germination has been carried out in Petri dishes and after they have been transplanted to plastic PET vases. With this research assignment we can contribute to the preservation of Asphodelus bento-rainhae and to a better knowledge of its germination conditions and life cycle.<br><br><br>

STUDY ON DROUGHT RESISTANCE OF AGROPYRON DESERTORUM UNDER OSMOTIC STRESS
Ruo Si Wang, Pu Ke
NO.2 Xue Yuan Xiao Jie, Xi Cheng District, China

Our project is a part of plant hardiness research. The initial idea was to observe the change of content of relative water of leaves, proline, content of soluble sucrose, the activity of protective enzymes system and the membrane penetrability of Agropyron desertorum, in the hope of completing the Drought-resistant physiology theory. After knew Institute of Botany Academic Sinica had done some similar research on Agropyron mongolicum Keng, we considered that using the Agropyron mongolicum Keng¡¯s data as contrast is more useful. Consequently, we compared the Agropyron desertorum¡¯s data to Agropyron mongolicum Keng¡¯s data, expect to select which Agropyron cultivar¡¯s drought resistance is better.<br><br>We submerging Agropyron desertorum seedlings roots with PEG solution, and observe the change of content of relative water of leaves, proline, content of soluble sucrose, the activity of protective enzymes system and the membrane penetrability, and compare them to Agropyron mongolicum Keng(surveyed and supplied by Institute of Botany Academic Sinica). <br><br>The results showed that, Agropyron desertorum¡¯s drought resistance is better than Agropyron mongolicum Keng; Perhaps Agropyron mongolicum Keng's main Drought-resistant physiology is different from Agropyron desertorum . And we still need to study about whether or not the Agropyron desertorum is fit for planting on the mongolia prairie in a large scale and whether or not Agropyron mongolicum Keng's main Drought-resistant physiology is different from Agropyron desertorum.<br><br>

"PEA"FECT PLANTS HYDROPONICALLY GROWING PISUM SATIVUM PEAS IN CARBONATED WATER
Paul Jay Painter, Ryan Routier
Harding County High School Buffalo, South Dakota United States of America

The purpose of this purpose is to determine how various amounts of carbonated water will affect the growth of Pisum sativum peas in a hydroponics system.<br><br> A hydroponics set-up was created. PVC pipes were filled with clay pebbles to anchor the roots of the Pisum sativum peas that were placed in drilled holes at the top of the pipe. Pumps criculated the water and nutrients while the plnats grew. The control group received only tap water. Group one received 500 mL of carbonated water twice a week whille tap water was added to reach the designated fullness. Group two received 1000 mL of carbonated water twice a week whille tap water was added to reach the designated fullness. The height, number of leaves, color, ans the number of blossoms, peas, and pods were recorded in our data book on every Monday, Wednseday, and Thursday throughout the experiment. Carbon dioxide tests were also taken throughout the experiment.<br><br> The results showed that group two had a higher average height, average number of leaves, and a greater amount of blossoms, peas, and pods than both the control group and group one. Group one had a higher average height, average number of leaves, and a greater amount of blossoms than the control group.<br><br> Group two grew the best, while the control group grew the worst. The carbonated water distributed to group one and group two enhanced the the rate of photosynthesis providing more ATP and sugar allowing the the plants to grow more efficiently, at a faster rate. In conclusion, carbonated water stimulates the growth of Pisum sativum pea plants.<br><br>

SUPERSIZE THOSE VEGGIES
Laura Rice Hayman, Emily Lois Hayman
Ballard High School, Louisville, KY USA

Do you want to supersize your vegetable garden? Most people would say yes. To discover how, the effect of different growing mediums on overall basil and tomato plant growth was tested hydroponically. This method of growing plants without soil is quick, affordable, and popular. The knowledge obtained would be beneficial to enlarge produce size, decrease time, and help feed people everywhere.<br><br> In this experiment, plants grew six weeks in a controlled environment. Tested growing mediums included: soil (control), vermiculite, coco-peat, stonewool, and peat moss. Twenty basil seeds per medium were planted in styrofoam cups, containing wicks, and hanging from a jar of 300 mL fertilized water. The same was done for 20 tomato seeds- two per jar. In total, 100 seeds of each plant were used. <br><br> Plant height (mm), width (mm), and number of leaves was measured each week. Quality was also recorded for each.<br><br> Basil results showed that peat moss prospered over stonewool, soil, coco-peat, and vermiculite, respectively. Tomato results showed peat moss thrived over coco-peat, stonewool, soil, and vermiculite, respectively. Peat moss did best because it retained the most moisture. Vermiculite did worst due to lack of root support.<br><br> Peat moss was concluded to be best when supersizing hydroponic vegetable gardens. With this conclusion, plants’ needs can be better accommodated by effectively controlling the growing medium. The experimental results are even more important, because hydroponic use is widespread and continues to grow in popularity. Additionally, hydroponics will be much more needed as soil resources slowly deplenish on Earth.

A STUDY OF POISON IVY EXTRACTS AND THEIR EFFECTS ON TEST ORGANISMS
Tyler William Smith, David Scoville
American Fork High School, American Fork Utah, USA

Pentadecylcatechol, the active compound in poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans) causes an immune response upon contact with human skin. Other mammals, however, are unaffected by the toxin. The intent of this project was to test T. radicans to determine its antimicrobial and anti-tumor qualities. <br><br>Extract was obtained from the leaves of T. radicans in two forms—a methanol fraction and a hexane fraction. Drugs were made from these extracts by suspending them in solution with DDH20 and either ethenol or DMSO (dimethol sulphoxide). A third drug was made using 3-Pentadecylphenol (urushiol), a stock chemical with a structure similar to that of Pentadecylcatechol. This was used as the positive control in the experiment. <br><br>Three kinds of microbes (Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus) were cultured and then inoculated with these three drugs in 96-well plates. The well plates were read with a spectrophotometer at the time of inoculation and again 24 hours later. A similar assay was conducted using cancer cells (HeLa) and normal cells (3T3) as test organisms. <br><br>The results show that only C. albicans, a fungus, was the only affected species. The methanol fraction was the only effective drug. These results could explain the efficacy of using T. radicans as a traditional way to treat fungal infections among Native Americans. 3-Pentadecylphenol, the positive control, was ineffective against all species. Therefore, it is unlikely that urushiol is the active agent against fungi.<br><br>

INDUCTION OF HOST PLANT IMMUNITY TO VIRUS BY AN INSECT BIOLOGICAL CONTROL AGENT: A TWO YEAR STUDY
Rajiv Bahl, Christopher Beckman
Lake Brantley High School; Altamonte Springs, Florida; United States

The purpose of the experiment is to determine the effects of the fungus, Paecilomyces fumosoroseus, on a mustard seed plant’s immunity to cabbage leaf curl virus. The protocol for the experiment is to grow and cultivate 72 mustardseed plants. Cultivate Paecilomyces fumosoroseus (PFR) onto agarose gel dishes, and run through a hemocytometer to distinguish the number of spores. Spray PFR solution onto 24 plants. Then produce “Actigard™” solution and spray onto 24 plants. Allow the remaining 24 plants to be used as a control. Permit the solutions to cultivate on the plants and expose whiteflies to the cabbage leaf curl virus (CLCV). Distribute ten flies per plant and allow to live in the environment. Allow two to three weeks for the virus to show. Visually collect data on the number of affected plants. Take circular samples from the youngest leaves and run PCR on the samples. Run the treated specimens through an electrophoresis gel bed and collect data. To futher prove the effectiveness of the PFR run the plant smaples through a Transmission Electron Microscope to visually see the virus.<br><br>Using the Transmission Electron Microscope method, the virus was shown to be prevalent on the “Actigard™” and control plants. While using the same method no traces of the CLCV virus was found on the PFR treated plants. Therefore, in conclusion there is a statistically significant difference in the effectiveness of using PFR as opposed to the chemcial agent “Actigard™” in preventing the cabbage leaf curl virus.

THE EFFECTS OF TAXOL AND ORYZALIN ON COTTON FIBER QUALITY IN G. HIRSUTUM, VARIETY MD51
Nikhil Gupta, Amrit Das
Manhasset High School, Manhasset New York, United States of America

Globally manufactured cotton represented approximately 20 million tons in 2003 (World Cotton Council, 2004). Microtubule production is hypothesized to play a key role in the synthesis and depostion of crystallized cellulose; therefore, the study looked at the effects of exogenous applications of Taxol (microtubule promoter) and Oryzalin (microtubule inhibitor) on cotton fiber quality in G. hirsutum, in regards to four economically relevant qualities: fiber diameter, cell wall thickness, birefringence and length. Chemical agents were administered to four groups of plants: No Treatment, Control (0.1% DMSO), Taxol, and Oryzalin. Flowers were anthetically tagged and fibers harvested from 10-40 DPA. Fiber diameter and wall thickness were measured using bright light microscopy. Birefringence was measured using polarized light microscopy, and length was measured using a ruler. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software with an ANOVA (p< 0.05). It was found that Taxol increased fiber cell wall thickness by 60%. Birefringence increased by 63% with the addition of Taxol. "No Treatment" fibers experienced dynamic growth between 20-30 DPA while "Taxol Treated" fibers exhibited growth between 20-40 DPA, thereby doubling the period of dynamic growth. The results indicate that not only are MT's involved in the development of cotton fibers, but an addition of MT's creates a superior quality cotton fiber. Results also help to better understand Taxol’s role in plant biochemistry, thus allowing researchers an increased window of opportunity for genetic manipulation of the fiber.

CROSS-POLLINATION BETWEEN TRANSGENIC AND NONTRANSGENIC PAPAYA PLANTS
Leanne Ta, Sharon Lum
President William McKinley High School, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA

This project is the result of tests done to determine the outcrossing rates between transgenic and nontransgenic plants in three different fields, approximately 0.08, 0.14, and 0.12 acres in size. Leaf samples were taken from each of the 129 trees in the three combined fields. These samples were submerged in a stain called X-glucuronidase. Approximately 10 ìL of this stain was used for each leaf sample. The reaction between the coat protein found in transgenic plants and the X-glucuronidase stain indicated that the plant was transgenic by causing a blue stain to appear. Nontransgenic plants do not contain a coat protein and therefore, were unaffected when exposed to the X-glucuronidase stain. Fruits were then harvested from nontransgenic plants to determine whether or not outcrossing had occured. The embryos from these fruits were extracted and submerged in the X-glucuronidase stain as well. Results from the tests suggested that 65% of the papaya trees in the fields were transgenic trees. Of the remaining trees, all but one were hermaphrodites that self-pollinated before transgenic pollen could reach them. The outcrossing rate from transgenic to nontransgenic hermaphrodites was approximately 1%. Due to the fact that there was only one nontransgenic female, there was not a sufficient amount of data to determine outcrossing rates among female plants.<br><br><br>

ELECTRIFYING GREEN BEANS
Amy Elizabeth LaViers, Erin Tyrell
Jefferson County High School, Dandridge TN, United States

“Electrifying Green Beans” examined DNA amplification fingerprintng (DAF) as a technique to test for relatedness between green bean cultivars. The cultivars used are the following: Blue Lake Pole, Blue Lake Bush, Mountain White Bush, Dwarf Bush, and Giant Stringless Bush beans. DNA was extracted from plants and amplified using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). DAF uses short (5-10 nucleotides) arbitrary primers to create products that can differentiate closely related organisms. After gel electrophoresis and silver staining, DNA bands common to all cultivars will be present (monomorphisms), whereas others will be unique to one or more cultivars (polymorphisms). Differences in products indicate variation in nucleotide sequences between cultivars. Genetic differences result in some cultivars being bush beans whereas others are pole beans and so on. By comparing these findings, the relatedness and the differences of the cultivars can be observed.<br><br>

TRADESCANTIA ZEBRINA: A NEW ORGANIC SOLUTION FOR CROPS
Edgar Eduardo Vaglio, Antonio Jose Jimenez
Liceo Experimental Bilingue, Turrialba, Cartago, Costa Rica

The project's main objective consists on the development of an organic pesticide, made from the plant Tradescantia zebrina in order to control plagues, such as clothes moth larva, bugs and maggots efficiently in crops such as corn, tomato and cucumber.As well to determine the field of applicability of the pesticide. <br><br>The elaboration process consists of several steps: processing the plant after drying it during a maximum of 22 days in a green house, (or an oven).<br><br> The next step is to process it in a mill in order to prepare an extract made from the dried plants and boiling water's dissolution. After that with a filter bag, the bran (dreg) will be separated from the liquid that will later be used as an organic controller of some large ants called “zompopas” (atta cephalica).<br><br> Following the previous steps, the pesticide and the bran were ready to be proved in the selected crops. After keeping a record of daily observations,the data suggested that the pesticide had to be improved because the rain had washed it out from the crops. After some research the team concluded that we had to add Aloe vera, to give it adherence to the plant and therefore make it resistant to rain and other weather conditions.<br><br>This pesticide is very useful and safe, since it does not harm the environment or people’s health and it is very economic. Besides, its effect on plagues is not by means of intoxication, instead it is by undernourishment.

KUDZU: THE VINE THAT SWALLOWED THE SOUTH
Douglas Bo Broadwater, Alyssa Crouch
Glenwood School, Phenix City, AL, USA

The purpose of this experiment is to determine if kudzu can be used to make alcohol and if that alcohol in turn can be used to power a small combustible engine. If this works, we will then compare our product to a typical airplane fuel to see which is more efficient, less expensive, and easier to make. <br><br>The kudzu will most likely make alcohol, because it is high in starch, and it should run in the engine because the engine normally runs on methanol, which is simply another type of alcohol. <br><br>We chopped our kudzu root into pieces and placed them in a 5-gallon bucket with water and enzymes, and then later we added yeast to complete the fermentation process. We distilled our mash and what we got was 120 proof alcohol. We knew this was not strong enough, so we distilled it again and got 160 proof alcohol, which would not run a model airplane engine (which takes methanol), but did run in a 4-wheeler engine (which takes gasoline). <br><br>We did not have enough kudzohol left to effectively compare it to gasoline, but we feel certain that it would have been more efficient than gasoline, and is, without a doubt, more environmentally friendly. For long term use, the gasoline engine would have to have some adjustments made to accommodate the kudzohol we would be using, but it will run because the carburetor injects the alcohol into the cylinder as a combustible vapor, as opposed to a liquid.

The culture of lemon affronts a diversity of phitosanitarian problems that affect their production. Micropropagation test have been developed to obtain germoplasm without microorganisms through in vitro culture. Two periods of asepsis test - fresh and dried seeds - were made to know the treatment that will eliminate contamination, and optimize germination and growing. These tests also included treatments with different chlorine concentrations (disinfectant agent) and time intervals.<br><br>Another test of germination was to know the effect of the hormones benzylaminopurine (BAP), and butiric indole-6-phenol acid (AIB) on lemon seeds.<br><br>For micropropagation, the explants previously obtained were exposed to different combinations of BAP, AIB, and naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), by the Taguchi Method (1950). Also with this method, an experiment of the effects that nutrients have on growing was made, where the explants were exposed to different concentrations of saccharose and ammonium nitrate.<br><br>The application of two asepsis treatments with chlorine solution (NaCIO 1%) and between them a stimulation phase of drying, were effective for germination and a good growing. The effect of 1 ml/l of BAP without AIB on the seeds was the best for germination.<br><br>For massive micropropagation the medium with the best growing, rotting and branching<br><br>had the concentration: BAP .5 ml/500 ml; AIB 1 ml/500 ml; ANA .05/500 ml. The best development of explants is observed under the lowest concentrations in saccharose and ammonium nitrate.<br><br>Long exposition of seeds to chlorine solution can affect the growing. The concentratoin of each hormone must be different to obtain the best effects in micropropagation.<br><br>

BACTERIA HYSTERIA: HOW FAST DOES THE BACTERIUM XYLELLA FASTIDIOSA MOVE THROUGHOUT A PLANT AND WILL IT MOVE IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION?
Melanie Nicole Amerson, Jenna Marie Grogan
Spalding High School, Griffin GA, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine how fast the bacterium Xylella Fastidiosa moved throughout a plant and if it would move in the opposite direction (from tip to base instead of base to tip). We injected 9 muscadine grapes, 8 periwinkles, 3 French Hybrid grapes, and 4 citrus plants with a known xylella culture on the tips and bases branched and labeled them with colored tape. We then waited two weeks and took the first, third, and fifth leaf of each branch and labeled them by thier plant number, branch number, and leaf number. They were weighed, surface sterilized, chopped, and streaked onto prepared media. The left over juice was put into tubes to be tested with ELISA. After two weeks we viewed the plates to see if any bacteria appeared and recorded all positive and contaminated plates. ELISA tests were then run and we recorded the positive data it gave us. These isolation steps were repeated with all plants alternating even and odd leaves.<br><br>The data showed that the farthest the bacterium moved in the plants was 566.42 millimeters. There were positive plates from leaves that were injected on the tip. This showed us that the bacterium moved in the opposite direction. The bacterium tested positive in all the plants except for the citrus. These results disproved our hypotheses by showing us that the bacterium moved farther than the 100 millimeters we predicted and also that it can move in the opposite direction than it normally does.

THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT GROWING CONDITIONS ON THE FIRMNESS, DIAMETER, SUGAR CONTENT, AND PH OF RIPENING GRAPE BERRIES
Megan Kathleen Bartlett
F. W. Springstead High School, Spring Hill, Florida, USA

Grape clusters, of the wine variety Cabernet Sauvignon and the table variety Autumn Royal, were subjected to five treatments and their development was assessed over time through berry firmness, diameter, pH, sugar content and titratable acidity (TA). These treatments were: full sun exposure,shade, bagging with foil to reduce the transpiration rate, reduction of cluster size to three berries, and partial-sun exposure as a control. I expected that full sun clusters would ripen first, with the least firmness and TA and highest pH, diameter and sugar, followed by the 3-berry clusters,with faster ripening from the reduction of crop load,then control, shade and bagged clusters, which would ripen last due to their limited water and nutrient uptake. There was no statistically significant (using chi-squared analysis) treatment that increased development the most. For the wine grapes, bagged clusters had the least softening, pH, and sugar and the most TA of all treatments,as predicted. Reducing cluster size hurt softening, unexpectedly. Berry sun exposure had little benefit and may even be harmful, especially for the sun-sensitive table grapes. In the table grapes, bagged clusters were the firmest, followed by 3-berry, control, shade, and sun clusters, respectively. There were significant differences between all groups, except 3-berry and control. I correctly predicted the results of the sun, control, and bagged clusters, but I assumed the shaded ones would not soften as much, and that the 3-berry ones would soften more. Removing berries may reduce transport to the damaged cluster, and this variety is very sun -sensitive. There was no significant difference for sugar levels, but bagged clusters had the most TA, as expected. There was no difference in either variety for diameter, rate of change in diameter or firmness, or pH. Because pH values are logarithmic, they may not show variation well. Diameter and rates of change may not be heavily affected by environment as long as resources are adequate.

ENHANCING A NATURAL SYSTEM TO INCREASE SOIL FERTILITY
Courtney Zasha Monique Rumala
Westgate Christian Academy, Spring Hill, FL, United States of America

<br><br> <br><br><br><br><br> The first study was designed to determine an easier and effective inoculation technique for the nitrogen-fixing actinomycete, Frankia. The second study was designed to determine the effectiveness of alder leaves used as a bio-fertilizer.<br><br> For the first study, 200 alder trees were grown. The 1st control group received sterilized soil and the 2nd control group received sterilized liquid phosphate buffer. The 1st testing group received soil infected with Frankia and the 2nd testing group<br><br>received liquid containing spores suspended in phosphate buffer. Based on my results, the Soil Inoculum was determined to be an easier and more effective inoculation technique.<br><br> For the second study, 80 grass “plots” were separated into four different treatment groups. The 1st group was treated with field soil, 2nd group was treated with Oil-Dry, the 3rd group was treated with a synthetic fertilizer, and the 4th group was treated with diced alder leaves, which served as a bio-fertilizer. Based on my results the Bio-Fertilizer proved to be a better and more effective method for use as a fertilizer. <br><br> For the third study, eleven soil samples were collected from around the state of Florida. Each soil was nitrogen depleted and water extractions were obtained in order to indicate the presence and concentration of Frankia. The water extractions were applied to alder seedlings and as a result nodulation occurred.<br><br>

FREE RADICAL REDUCTION WITHIN THE GLYCINE MAX WITH AEROPONICALLY INDUCED ANTIOXIDANTS
Justin Andrew Townley
Okaloosa Walton College Collegiate High School, Niceville, Florida, USA

Research concerning antioxidants and plants has been promising. In an effort to create a plant that is useful for human consumption, selected antioxidants were added to plants to create an exceedingly beneficial product. The antioxidants L-ascorbic acid, alpha-tocopherol, and Glutathione were added to the plant Glycine max. Results indicated that the plants uptake of the antioxidants varied. The alpha-tocopherol and the L- ascorbic acid exhibited significant intakes. The plants were deprived of all nutrients except for distilled water and the selected antioxidants. Ensuring that the plants were not receiving nutrients and/or benefits from the soil, I designed and built aeroponic systems to induce the antioxidants and support the plants in a soiless environment. All plants that received antioxidants showed significant increases in overall height, root length, fresh and dry weight, and total antioxidant activity. The most significant results were observed from alpha-tocopherol and L-ascorbic acid concentrations .02% and .04%. Evaluation of the total antioxidant activity was expressed through the ABTS/H2O2/HRP method. This is an inhibition method where ABTS when combined with horseradish peroxidase, phosphate buffer pH 7.0, and hydrogen peroxide creates the relativity long-lived free radical cation ABTS+. When samples containing antioxidants are added, they inhibit the end point reaction, which is a blue green color formation. This process was observed through a spectrophotometer at 414nm. The lag time for color formation is directly proportional to the total antioxidant activity. These tests indicate that the plants are absorbing the antioxidants with positive effects and that soil is not a factor.

AUGMENTED IMIDACLOPRID: IMPROVING PEST MANAGEMENT; INCREASING PLANT HEALTH
Austin Hensel
Lincoln Park Academy, Fort Pierce, Florida, USA

The purpose of this project was to determine if 2-n-propylpiperidine increased the effectiveness of the insecticide Imidacloprid and if the application of Imidacloprid augmented with 2-n-propylpiperidine resulted in healthier plants.<br><br> Based on previous years’ research that 2-n-propylpiperidine is an effective insect attractant and the belief that plants with fewer pests have a higher probability of health, it was hypothesized that augmenting Imidacloprid with 2-n-propylpiperidine would increase the Imidacloprid's effectiveness and result in healthier plants.<br><br> The procedure involved equally dividing 144 tomato plants into four replication groups and further dividing them into four treatment areas per replication group. Treatments of distilled water, 2-n-propylpiperidine, 2-n-propylpiperidine and Imidacloprid, and Imidacloprid were applied to insect trap paper attached to stakes. The stakes were placed in the tomato field, one per treatment area, and collected weekly. Attracted whiteflies were totaled for 10 weeks. The plants’ height, number of inflorescences and flowers were recorded and the tomatoes were totaled and weighed.<br><br> Results support the hypothesis. The 2-n-propylpiperidine and Imidacloprid solution attracted a statistically significantly larger total of whiteflies and produced plants that were statistically significantly higher in both the number of fruit and also in the weight of fruit than the Imidacloprid, 2-n-proylpiperidine, or distilled water treatments.<br><br> It can be concluded that augmenting Imidacloprid with 2-n-propylpiperidine increases Imidacloprid's effectiveness and results in healthier plants. This major new discovery is extremely beneficial to the agricultural industry, especially organic farming, as it reduces the amount of insecticide necessary, diminishes insecticide resistance, saves costs, and results in less pollution.<br><br>

A TWO YEAR STUDY ON THE PHOTOREACTIVATION OF CHLAMYDOMONAS REINHARDITI AND EUGLENA GRACILIS: PHOTOLYASE'S ROLE IN DNA REPAIR
Nadine Sfeir
Lake Brantley High School, Florida, United States

Repair of DNA damage induced by UVBR (Ultra Violet B Radiation) was investigated with Chlamydomonas reinharditi and Euglena gracilis. Due to the rapid decline in stratospheric ozone concentrations and the associated increase in ambient UVBR has shown to have deleterious effects on living organisms. This year's experimentation focused on several procedures. The most concentrated, focused around isolating photolyase via a monochrometer, testing different dilution factors, examining the shielding effect through exposure, and testing at 650nm and 450nm, investigating the effectiveness of these wavelengths towards the photoreactivation of Chlamydomonas and Euglena. In order to validate the previous year's results a kill curve was tested and next a photoreactivation procedure was tested several times. By using a monochromator to isolate the various wavelengths on the light spectrum the organisms are exposed for calculated times. After photoreactivation and incubation, the growth of the organisms reflects the appropriate wavelength at which photolyase is ignited therefore repairing the DNA damage caused by the UVBR exposure. In both Euglena and Chlamydomonas 450nm of blue light showed to be most effective in the reactivation process, with a 97% regeneration with Chlamydomonas and 63% with Euglena. The possibilities to use photolyase as a defense mechanism against harmful UVBR are endless. With this proposal the next objective is to extract the enzyme and observe its functions with different organisms.

QUACKWEED
Yun Liu
Houma Jr. High School, Houma, LA

The purpose of this project was to find out if duckweed could survive in a high salinity environment. Duckweeds are tiny aquatic plants found all over the world. They grow on the surface of still fresh water ponds and lakes and form the base of many aquatic ecosystems. I believed that they could not survive in a higher salinity environment. Duckweeds of the specie Lenma minor were used in the experiment. They are one of the smallest specie and also the most common. The Lenma minor were grown in 4 different salinities (0, 5, 10, and 15 ppt) for three days and 2 salinities (0 and 10 ppt) for 8 days. Afterwards, the duckweeds were weighed for its dry weight after drying in a dry oven. Chlorophyll was also measured from another set of duckweed grown in 2 salinities (0 and10 ppt) for 2 and 8 days.<br><br> In the end, the results supported my hypothesis that the duckweed could not survive in high salinity water. It appeared that the duckweed could survive in waters with salinities up to 10 ppt for a course of three days. They were unable to survive in the 15 ppt water showing that they could not tolerate very high salinities. However after 3 days, growth in 10 ppt water began to decline. The duckweed growing in the 0 ppt water continued to grow throughout the experiment. Chlorophyll contents rose steadily throughout the course of the experiment for the duckweed in the 0 ppt water and dropped drastically in the 10 ppt water. Therefore, Lenma minor can survive in waters up to 10 ppt through a course of three days, but not for longer periods of time.

PEROXIDASE ACTIVITY IN FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
Javid Gulmahamad
McArthur High School, Hollywood, FL, United States Of America

Many studies in the past have shown that peroxidases can reduce lipid peroxidation (Chopra, 2000). The leading causes of death are heart disease (Folden, 2003), liver failure (Graminex, 2004), diabetes (Upritchard, 2000), and Alzheimer’s (Goldstein, 2001) which are all linked to oxidative stress. Our bodies wear down in old age because of lipid peroxidation. Therefore, it is imperative to discover new ways to replace these essential enzymes. Comparative tests, a DOT-Blot, colorimeter, and an electrophoresis assay were conducted to confirm the presence and location of peroxidases. The experiment tests various vegetables and fruits to find which ones have peroxidase enzymes and the location of the peroxidase within the vegetable or fruit. <br><br> In the DOT-Blot assay location of these enzymes were confirmed and resulted in Musa acuminata (banana) ranking highest having the most peroxidase activity followed by Raphanus sativas (radish). Brassica rapa (bok choi) ranked third and Daucus carota (carrot) fourth. The Mann-Whitney statistic was applied followed by a comparative analysis. Since, Us = 180.5 < U.05 = 181, do not reject the null with a .05>p>.10. <br><br> In the colorimeter assay radish and Averhoa carambola (starfruit) both ranked first followed by carrot in third and bok choi in fourth. There was a significant difference in the absorbance of light (565nm) of the fruits and vegetables since, a T = 3.341101 > T = 2.145, reject the null. The electrophoresis assay identified the various peroxidase enzymes in each fruit and vegetable. In conclusion, radishes had the highest level of peroxidases followed by carrots and bok choi in a comparative analysis of all assays. <br><br>

THE CARBON WARS: CARBON VS. TILLAGE, PART 2
Kate Marie Gearhart
Unioto High School, Chillicothe, Ohio, USA

Soil carbon can be lost in the form of carbon dioxide, CO2. Carbon dioxide is released from soil during soil respiration and when soil is disturbed. As carbon is lost, the amount of organic matter in the soil decreases, causing declines in soil quality and crop yields. The purpose of this project is to determine if a trend exists in CO2 loss during the growing season for corn and soybean crops. The hypothesis is as follows: If the soil has been disturbed by traditional tillage methods, then CO2 release will be higher than in no-till or conservation till methods, and CO2 loss will follow a bell shaped curve during the growing season. The bell curve is anticipated because crop growth activity is the highest in mid-summer during pollination and seed fill stages. To test this hypothesis, soil respiration tests were preformed in four different tillage types and fencerows in six fields on three farms. No-Till, Chisel Plow, Strip Till, and Conventional Till were tested. Soil respiration rates were calculated and results were analyzed. Because the experiment involved actual field tests, this project was performed in an environment that was not completely controllable. Several factors in an outdoors environment, including weather, can change rapidly and unpredictably. Due to varying results, this experiment is inconclusive. Only the Conventional Till samples and some No-Till and Strip Till samples followed a bell shaped curve. Also, tilled samples released the least CO2 on average throughout the summer, contrary to published research. <br><br>

HOYA OFFSPRING: CROSS-POLLINATED OR SELF-POLLINATED
Crystal Lynn Swartzfager
Wildwood High School, Wildwood, Florida, United States

The purpose of this study is to prove that the Hoya carnosa not only naturally crosses within its own species, but is also out-crosses with other species of Hoya. <br><br>Five plants were selected from the offspring Sets 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7 and a leaf was taken from each plant. A small portion of each leaf was crushed; filter papers soaked up the plant material then were added to a slit in the gel slabs. The slabs were placed in the electrophoresis machine for 6 hours. Enzyme reagent solutions were mixed PGM and PGI, NAD and TPI, each solution was added to a separate slab in a clear glass container and placed in a dark area to react.<br><br>All offspring had the same maternal parent plant, Hoya carnosa. Sets 1,2,4,5 and 6 were all Hoya carnosa parent plant crossed with Hoya carnosa parent plant X. The enzyme movement across the gel showed that the sets 1,2,4,5,and 6 all matched the maternal parent plant and the parent plant X. Therefore the Hoya carnosa cross-pollinated within species. Remarkably different were the results for set 7. The known maternal parent plant was Hoya carnosa parent plant; however the PGM enzyme reagent proved that the offspring was the result of an out-cross-pollination with another species of Hoya.<br><br>Isozyme genetic markers prove that Hoya carnosa is a cross-pollinating species, within species and it also out-crosses with other species of Hoya. There is not genetic evidence of self-pollination.

WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF PH LEVEL OF SOIL ON PLANTS?
Lena Brodsky
Henry Grady High School, Atlanta, Georgia USA

The purpose of the experiment is to find the effect of the varying pH levels of soil on plants. The first procedure was to buy fifteen seperately potted plants. Then I placed the plants in an area of equal sunlight and seperated them into three groups, five in the control group, five in a group in which acidic substances would be added, and five to which basic substances would be added.<br><br>The next procedure was to water the plants, giving 250 ml of water to the groups of five.This step was repeated each day, but with an addition of an amount of acidic or basic substance, making the amounts equal to each plant and an equal amount of vinegar (acid) to the acid group as the amount of baking soda (basic) to the basic group. <br><br>The first amount of vinegar/baking soda was .63ml in 50 ml of water. Each day the amount of acidic/basic substance increased, until the final amount of 5 ml in the same amount of water.<br><br>Data was recorded for the plant growth and health. The final data showed that there were two healthy acidic plants, although two had yellow leaves, three had wilted flowers, and one was dying. There was one healthy basic plant, four of the plants had spotted leaves, three had wilted flowers and two were dying. All of the plants in the control group were healthy.<br><br>The results show that a strong amount of basic pollution is more harmful to plants than an acidic substance, although both caused the plants to die.

SURVIVING PRODUCTION QUOTAS AND FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS: THE EFFECTS OF TILLAGE REDUCTION ON SUGARCANE YIELDS IN FIRST YEAR STUBBLE.
Tate Benton-Michael Guillotte
Catholic High School, New Iberia, Louisiana, USA

The purpose of this project is to determine if tillage reduction will increase sugarcane yields. Previous research has found that reducing tillage can help control some diseases in other crops and reduce the need for subsoiling in dry weather. The issue of tillage reduction with respect to yield has not been addressed in sugarcane. It was hpothesized that tillage reduction would not affect yields in the pre-harvest soil sample study, the pre-harvest yield estimate study, or the harvest study. To test the hypothesis, the experimenter selected a six acre patch. There were three treatments types: no-till, medium till, and full till. Each treatment was replicated six times within the test patch. The experimenter fertilized all treatments the same and then conducted three studies. In the first, the exerimenter took soil samples from each treatment and compared the nutrient levels. In the second, the experimenter conducted a pre-harvest yield estimate to determine the average stalk population, avearage stalk weight, and the average brix of each treatment. In the third, the experimenter harvested each treatment and hauled the sugarcane to the mill for sugar extraction. Then the experimenter compared the mill's test data for each patch. In the first study, the no-till treatment had higer nutrient levels. In the second study, the no-till treatment had the highest stalk weight and sugar content, but had the smallest stalk population. In the third study, the no-till treatment did not test highest in all mill fields, but it did produce the most pounds of sugar. The experimenter conducted a stistical test on all data collected and found that the pounds of sugar recovered (the source of a farmer's income) had a statistical significance of P < 0.0235. The experimenter's cost analysis study discovered an average increase of $52.06 per acre net income. Using this data, the experimenter concluded that the experiment rejected his hypothesis, proving that tillage reduction does affect sugarcane yields in first year stubble.

TABERNAEMONTANA PANDACAQUI POIR (PANDAKAKI) AS RICE BUG (LEPTOCORISA ACUTA) ERADICATOR
Daisy Bayani Galapia
Sinait National High School, Sinait, Ilocos Sur, Philippines

The rice bug Leptocorisa acuta attacks rice plants during the milky stage resulting in poor production of grains unfit for human consumption. <br><br> This study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of using Tabernaemontana pandacaqui Poir (pandakaki) in eradicating the rice bug during milky stage of the rice cycle.<br><br> The stems and leaves of pandakaki were gathered, washed and chopped into small pieces. From 2kg of these leaves and stems, 75ml of juice was extracted. Three hundred rice bugs were also collected from the rice field using insect catching net and put in a jar covered with cloth. The extracted juice was used in 5 treatments with varying concentrations. Each treatment had a total volume of 30ml. <br><br> Fifteen pots with rice plants were prepared and allowed to grow until milky stage. Each pot was placed in a rectangular cage measuring 40cm x 40cm x 70cm, which was covered with fine-meshed nylon screen. Twenty rice bugs were then put inside. These pots were divided into 5 sets of 3 cages each for the administration of the 5 treatments. Mortality of rice bugs in each treatment was computed and the ANOVA and DMRT were used to determine whether significant differences in mortality of rice bugs exist among the treatments.<br><br> The study showed that pure pandakaki extract is as effective as the commercial pesticide in the eradication of rice bugs since both caused almost the same mortality rate. Cost-wise, pure pandakaki extract is cheaper, and considering ecological impacts, is more environment-friendly than chemical pesticide. <br><br>

ANALYZING THE EFFECT OF THE NON CO2 CONSTITUENTS IN CAR EXHAUST ON PLANTS
Eric Victor Griego
Carbon High School, Price, Utah, USA

The purpose of this project is to determine the effect of carbon dioxide and the non carbon dioxide constituents found in car exhaust on plants in the proportions found in car exhaust.<br><br> The plants (Brassica oleracea, Brassica rapa, Cucumis sativus, Abelmoschus esculentus, and Lycopersicon esculentum) will be given regular doses of car exhaust and carbon dioxide of the same carbon dioxide content (155 liters). The plants will be divided among three cells for each of the gases (carbon dioxide, car exhaust, and ambient air only as a control) being introduced. <br><br> The beneficial aspects of the higher carbon dioxide concentration will be shown in the plant growths for all the plants. The detrimental effects of all the non carbon dioxide constituents in the car exhaust should be evident in the plant growth from all the plants exposed to car exhaust. This will give for a comparison that will show the net effects of carbon dioxide and the non carbon dioxide constituents on plant growth.<br><br> <br><br>

THE USE OF SEAWEED COMPOST AS AN ORGANIC FERTILIZER
Augusto Raul Perez
Colegio San Jose, San Juan, Puerto Rico

ABSTRACT:<br><br>In this research seaweeds were used as organic fertilizer. A total of six cubic feet of dry seaweeds were collected from Pinones Beach in Carolina, Puerto Rico. To produce the seaweed compost, a process of microbiological decomposition was used. They were washed with water, exposed to the sun until dried, and shredded in small pieces. Three plants were used in the experiment: Kidney Beans (A) (Phaseolus Vulgaris), Coriander (B) (Coriandrum Sativum) and Basil(C) (Ocimum Basilicum). Three soil types were used. First, Common backyard soil, was used as control. Second, the control soil was mixed with a commercial fertilizer whose chemical composition is known and finally the control soil mixed with the seaweed manure. Twenty seven plants were used. The plants were placed on a backyard. Twelve of the twenty seven plants germinated. In groups 1(A), 1(B) and 1(C), plantations using clay soil (control), did not sprout. Also, the Kidney beans did not germinated in any of the three soils. First, with a minimum time and effort (eighty days of composting), the seaweeds released enough nutrients which promoted the growth of basil and coriander plants. Second, it was scientifically demonstrated that the only cause for the plant growth in groups 3(B) and 3(C) was the nutrients released from the seaweed compost. Results encourage future investigations, which could lead to proving scientifically the utility of using seaweed compost, and thus the opportunity of converting a nuisance to public beaches into a solution to the need of an ecological use of farmlands.<br><br>

DO YOUR VEGETABLES PUMP IRON?
Charlton Claire Starcke
Seguin High School, Seguin, TX, USA

Do Your Vegetables Pump Iron? - Squash, radishes, broccoli, and carrots were grown in two soil groups. One group, the control, grew in a generic soil (Top Notch Premium Soil Mix) with no additives, while the other group of vegetables, the test group, grew in the same base soil, to which iron supplements had been added. After fertilizing the test group with Hi-Yield IRON Plus -11% Ammoniacal Nitrogen, 13% combined Sulfur, and 16% Water Soluble Iron- the specimens were cultivated under ideal conditions, including necessary sunlight and plenty of water. Once the vegetables produced fruit, an Iron-in-Foods laboratory experiment was done to analyze the iron content of each vegetable in each group. Color standards where contrived using iron(III) chloride hexahydrate, and run through a spectrophotometer to determine the percent transmittance- the amount of light that can pass through a certain solution. This data was then used to form the standard curve. After the vegetable samples were tested, they too, were run through the spectrophotometer to obtain their percent transmittance which would then be compared to the predetermined standard curve. Three of the four vegetables’ iron concentration increased, while the carrot’s iron content did not. These results did not support my null hypothesis. The iron fertilization did increase the amount of iron in the sample vegetables grown. While differences in the iron concentrations were not vast they were measurable and evident.

THE ANTI-MICROBIAL PROPERTIES OF APHANIZOMENON FLOS-AQUAE, A SPECIES OF MICRO-ALGAE FROM UPPER KLAMATH LAKE
LueAnn Melinda Zaske
Klamath Union High School, Klamath Falls, Oregon, USA

My project focused on a botanical phenomenon in my community: Yearly algal blooms in Upper Klamath Lake, a 324 square-kilometer hyper-eutrophic lake in Southern Oregon. My research question was whether this local nuisance had hidden benefits. I found a scientific article regarding anti-microbial effects of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae (AFA), the most predominant species of algae in this lake. This particular species is non-toxic, in contrast to other algae.<br><br>Bacterial growth of environmental samples (lake, soil), saliva, S. aureus and E. coli was assessed by culturing on Petrifilm. Culturing bacteria from the lake sample in the presence of AFA showed reduced growth. Water and methanol extract from AFA were tested against these bacteria. Anti-microbial effect was found in both extracts. This was confirmed on data from AFA samples collected across the growing season over several years. <br><br>Of particular interest was my observation that the AFA water extract inhibited the growth of E. coli. This is novel data, as the scientific paper only reported an effect in the methanol extract. The most predominant component in the water extract is Phycocyanin. Since Phycocyanin is present in the photosynthetic system of all blue-green algae, and since no effect was found in the water extract in the previous study of AFA, this suggests a unique property in AFA from Upper Klamath Lake. Further work is in progress to identify these novel component(s) in high and low molecular weight fractions of the water extract. It is possible that this may contribute to the benefit of the lake’s ecology. <br><br>

MECHANISMS OF FLOWER-STALK LAY-DOWN AFTER FERTILIZATION AND RE-ERECTION AFTER SEED MATURATION IN DANDELION
Miho Ishikawa
Yachiyo Shoin High School, 727 Murakami, Yachiyo, Chiba Prefecture, JAPAN

The flower stalk of a dandelion grows upward until blooming, but lays down after blooming. It then re-erects itself when the seeds mature and elongates further to release the seeds. I investigated the mechanisms involved in the lay-down and re-erection of flower stalks. Lay-down did not occur when flower buds were removed before flowering, or when fertilization was arrested. However, the lay-down was observed after indole acetic acid (IAA) treatment of flower. HPLC analysis showed that transportable IAA was synthesized remarkably in the flower after fertilization. Re-erection of flower stalks occurs following seed maturation. At the same time the thickness of the flower stalks increases remarkably and the transpiration of water from the flowers decreases, suggesting that water transport from flower stalk to the flower becomes blocked before re-erection. As I thought that the increased turgor pressure in the flower stalk might be a possible cause of re-erection, the transport of red pigment used for food coloration through vascular bundles from the flower stalk to flowers was tested. In young flowers the pigment was transported from root to flower through vascular bundles but such transportation was blocked when seeds matured. A remarkable morphological change due to cell necrosis but not due to absciss layer was observed in the vascular bundle connecting the receptacle and seeds. These results indicate that, in dandelions, IAA is involved in the lay-down phenomenon of flower-stalks, and that re-erection and elongation of the stalk during the seed maturation phase are regulated by increased turgor pressure.

A CORNUCOPIA OF A GREEN SALAD OF COVER CROPS: SOLICAM PHYTOREMEDIATION
Holli Joy Linman
Hotchkiss High School, Hotchkiss, Colorado, USA

Will phytoremediation work on a persistent herbicide?<br><br>In the summer of 2004, some vegetables that were being grown in a former apple orchard in Western Colorado were distorted, dieing, or dead. When this area had been planted in apple trees, it was sprayed with a herbicide. This phenomenon was occuring where the previous tree rows had been. <br><br>The researcher filled 192 pots with contaminated soil and 192 pots with noncontaminated soil. These were planted with six different seed varieties to see which cover crop would phytoremediate the herbicide the best. The seeds were: vetch, garden peas, buckwheat, fava beans, oats, and field peas. Pots were treated with compost, incorporated activated carbon, and sprayed-on activated carbon. A set of untreated pots was used as a control.<br><br>The plants that grew in the contaminated soil turned white and many died. The plants were allowed to grow for approximately six weeks. The plants were then cut off. The plant matter was weighed, chopped up and incorporated back into the soil. Cucumber seeds were planted into the pots.<br><br>The cucumbers that sprouted in the contaminated soil soon turned white and died. The plants that grew in the compost lived the longest.

THE IN VITRO PROPAGATION OF A. PALMATUM AND ITS VARIOUS CULTIVARS
Michael Bernert James Bernert
West Linn High School, West Linn, Oregon, United States 

This project sought to develop a protocol for the in vitro propagation of Acer palmatum. The numerous factors affecting the success of in vitro propagation, in conjunction with the lack of published material concerning A. palmatum make this an imposing proposition. A protocol would allow A. palmatum specific genetic, environmental, and stress studies to be carried out. <br><br> In trial #1, 400 tubes, containing eight different media compositions, were prepared. Trial #1 failed to provide any conclusive data due to 97.45% contamination. However, it provided two successful samples which acted as models for further research. Trial #2 tested the effect of three different media compositions on explant growth. Greatly improved procedures aided by numerous controls attempted to curb and identify contamination sources. Contamination occurred at 100% in trial #2, but it showed the primary source of contamination was the explants. <br><br> Trial #3 tested the effect of whole vs. partial buds as well as varying lengths of explant exposure to bleach on contamination. Trial #3 showed that the contamination rate for whole buds was not affected by sterilization time in 10% bleach. Because the survival rate for partial buds was much higher than whole buds, the outer bud scales seem to be a substantial contaminate. Trial #4 will test the effect of using new growth as explants on contamination. Further trials will be conducted as necessary. <br><br> This research suggests that A. palmatum can be grown in vitro and that a protocol can be developed. Despite progress, further research is necessary.<br><br>

WHAT MECHANISM DOES THE BACTERIUM XYLELLA FASTIDIOSA EMPLOY TO PROGRESS THROUGHOUT THE XYLEM? WHAT CONCENTRATION OF GELRITE IS OPTIMAL FOR VIEWING THE BACTERIUM'S MOVEMENT?
Melanie Nicole Amerson
Spalding High School, Griffin Georgia, USA

The purpose of this project is to find out if the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa uses an as yet undiscovered mechanism to move through the xylem of a plant. Also, to find which concentration of Gelrite is optimal for viewing the bacterium's movement. I took four cultures and made cell suspensions for each one, and also made different concentrations of Gelrite media. After these were made, the cell suspensions were placed on the plates with various concentrations of Gelrite that was found to be the most favorable for viewing under the microscopes. These concentrations and PW were placed into the Petri dishes and four-chambered coverglass systems. Cell suspensions and dilutions were then placed on the media in Petri dishes and coverglass system. I then viewed the plates under the Leica DMIRB microscope with the Openlab computer program. Pictures and video were taken and analyzed.<br><br>The qualitative data showed me that the mechanism X. fastidiosa employs to progress throughout the xylem is still unknown. My hypothesis on the mechanism cannot be proved or disproved. However, my hypothesis regarding the Gelrite concentration was. The .3% was favorable along with many other concentrations such as .5% all the way to 1.1%. The proper conditions must be met before the bacterium's morphology can be determined. Some conditions that must be met are as follows: proper media, proper thickness of the media, a fresh culture, and proper temperature. The process of finding these conditions is trial and error and takes time to determine what is best. <br><br>

THE STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF POLKA DOT AND WILD TYPE CERATOPTERIS RICHARDII BY ELECTROPHORETIC PROTEIN COMPARISON 
Anna Pilishvili
Forest Hills High School, Forest Hills NY, United States

The polka dot mutation in Ceratopteris richardii is a remarkable mutation that allows the gametophytic and homozygous sporophytic stages of plants to portray a unique polka-dot appearance. The slightly reduced life span and the clumping of organelles around the nucleus suggest a possible disturbance of the cytoskeleton by the mutation; however, a concrete knowledge of the mutation is nonexistent. Thus, this experiment focuses on comprehending the mutation’s role in the Ceratopteris richardii cytoskeleton. Actin filaments are involved in the process of cytokinesis and the microtubules are involved in chromosomal separation during cell division. If these functions were inhibited by the polka dot mutation, C-fern cell reproduction would be halted. Furthermore, the possible disruption of the intermediate filament proteins (which anchor organelles in place and provide mechanical support) was hypothesized. Electrophoresis trials enabled the comparison of wild type (control) and polka dot C-fern proteins. The protein comparison clarified the polka dot phenotypic expression as involving not only the intermediate filaments but the entire cytoskeleton.

CHEMICAL RESTORATION OF CHLOROPLAST FUNCTION AFTER HEAT DAMAGE
Casey Renee Morgan
Latta High School, Ada, Oklahoma, United States

The purpose of this experiment was to examine how varying periods of heat exposure to which chloroplasts are exposed affect the rate of photosynthetic activity. An additional purpose was to determine whether chloroplast function could be restored after being subjected to heat damage. A final purpose was to examine the use of various chemicals to restore the photosynthetic function of chloroplasts.<br><br> It was hypothesized that heat would diminish and/or destroy the function of chloroplasts, and increasing thermoperiods of heat exposure would cause greater impairment of chloroplast function. It was also hypothesized that the chemical 1,5-diphenylcarbazide (DPC), an artificial electron donor, could restore chloroplast photosynthetic function after heat damage.<br><br> Chloroplasts were isolated from spinach leaves. The chemicals DPC, 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethyl urea (DCMU), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were added to reaction tubes containing the chloroplast suspensions. Chloroplasts were heat damaged in a water bath at 55°C for 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 minutes. The chloroplast tubes were exposed to a bright light and absorbency was read every minute for five minutes. Photosynthetic activity was measured by using the reduction of blue 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) into a colorless solution. Light absorbency was tested before and after light exposure using a spectrophotometer. <br><br> The results supported the hypotheses and indicated that increasing thermoperiods of heat exposure did significantly impair the chloroplast photosynthetic function. It also demonstrated that chemicals, especially DPC, can help repair the function of the chloroplasts after becoming heat damaged.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF SOIL PH VALUE ON TRITICUM AESTIVUM L.'S GROWTH
Stacey Lee Vosters
North Daviess High School, Elnora, Indiana, United States

The pH level of a soil is the measure of hydrogen ions that are present in the soil. The pH scale runs from 1 to 14 with 7 being neutral. If a soil pH value is from 7-14 then it is considered to be alkaline or basic, but if a soils pH level is 1-7 then it is considered to be acidic. Several different types of tests can be done to determine a soils pH value such as a simple test that can be done at home with a basic test kit or samples can be sent to a labatory where a more complete soil analysis can be made. This technological advancement allows the American farmer to be able to produce enough food for America and many other countries. <br><br> During my research, I discovered that the pH value of a soil affects the crops ability to extract nutrients from the soil. Therefore I believe that the lower the pH the less the wheat growth will be. <br><br> The results of my project differed greatly from my hypothesis. When I finished my project I came to the conclusion that the lower pH valued group grew better than my groups with a higher soil pH. My test group A had the greatest average growth of 179 grams, but also had the lowest pH value. Test group B grew the next best with an average growth of 169.4 grams, while test group C grew the least with an average growth of 166.6.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF TRICLOSAN DIOXINS (TD’S) FROM BIOME CHEMICAL SOIL RUNOFF BIOACCUMULATION: AN INVESTIGATION FOR AN INNOVATIVE USE OF CRINUM AMERICANUM AS BIOREMEDIATION
Zachary Mason Sandoval
Dr. Michael M. Krop High School

Triclosan is a chemical used in detergents, pesticides, and household products. It has never been proven if Triclosan runoff is destroying local biomes in the Florida Everglades. The purpose is to observe Triclosan’s effects on vital microscopic and chemical properties. If harmful, the study will try to use Crinum americanum to reverse its effects.<br><br><br> To conduct my research in test one, four groups (one being the control) of different Triclosan amounts (10, 100, and 1,000 ppm); were administered to the samples once and observed for nineteen days. Using the CBL Probes (Phosphorus, Nitrogen, Oxygen); the changes in chemical levels were observed using population counts and probe data. In addition, the Enviro-viewer microscope allowed careful observation of the microscopic population changes of Florida Green Algae, Paramecium, Anabaena, and Caulerpa bruchypus. In study two, the same testing procedure was repeated with the addition of adding sprouts of Crinum americanum.<br><br><br> At the completion of this experiment, the conclusion formulated was that the higher the Triclosan runoff ppm increases have a +.6 correlation to increase growth rate of pervasive plants such as Caulerpa bruchypus, which also causes vital gasses to become “unbalanced”. When sprouts of Crinum americanum are added, the normal balance of the biome is preserved (+.5) and the effects of Triclosan are better silenced. This project proves the theory that Triclosan in fact impacts biome stability and that botanical species can directly serve to rebalance their harmful effects and perhaps other chemical carcinogens (such as in chemical warfare) as well as for pharmaceutical development. <br><br>

THE USE OF BIOCONTROL AGENTS AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO FUNGICIDE FOR THE PREVENTION OF THE GROWTH OF FUSARIUM GRAMINEARUM ON SEED CORN
Nicole Elizabeth Frisk
Mankato West High School, Mankato, MN, USA

The purpose of my experiment was to test a new biocontrol for inhibiting the growth of the fungus, Fusarium graminearum. The biocontrol consisted of bacteria found in a previous experiment conducted at the University of Minnesota. In my experiment, I compared the biocontrol to a commercially available biocontrol, TJ1300, a seed treatment/fungicide, Maxim/Apron, and a control (sterilized seed in sterilized soil. First, I mixed the bacteria (in liquid agars) together in a sterilized beaker to make the new biocontrol. I disinfected four-hundred kernals of seed corn in a bleach solution. I then separated the corn into groups of one-hundred kernals. I treated each of three groups with a different treatment and left one group untreated as a control. I planted the treated seeds in flats with soil inoculated with Fusarium graminearum. I planted the untreated seeds in sterile soil. Each flat had fifty seeds with two flats for each treatment and the control. Finally, I allowed two weeks for plants to sprout and recorded the results. The first time I conducted this experiment, the seeds were grown in a greenhouse where they were kept at 75 degrees F. After two weeks, 91% of the corn treated with the Maxim/Apron, 99% of the corn treated with TJ1300, 94% of the corn treated with the biocontrol mixture, and 89% of the control germinated. This data shows that both biocontrols were more reliable for controlling the fungus than the chemical treatment, Maxim/Apron.

GROWTH OF PLANTS IN RESPONSE TO DIFFERENT WAVELENGTHS OF LIGHT AND ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS
Christian Aric Larsen
Bountiful High School, Bountiful Utah, United States of America

The purpose of this project was to see if different wavelengths of light and electromagnetic fields had any effect on the growth of plants. In order to do this I obtained the use of two lasers, of different wavelengths, one at 632.8 nm, and the other at 910 nm, used mostly for medical therapy, and an electromagnet used for the same purpose.<br><br> The growth of the plants, or the height, was measured in centimeters, and the energy applied to the plants through the lasers and electromagnet was measured in joules. Seven plants were planted and allowed to grow for six weeks. Each of the seven plants were given specific combinations of lasers and electromagnets, with one being a control. Five joules of energy was given to each plant, each night for three weeks, and measurements were taken once every five days. <br><br> After the three week period elapsed and the data was organized, a significant difference in height between the plants was observed. The plant to which the 632.8 nm laser was applied grew to be the tallest, 34.2 cm. The plant to which only the electromagnet was applied grew to be the shortest, 23.7 cm. But the plant to which both the 632.8 nm laser and the electromagnet were applied grew to be the second shortest, 24.2 cm. The control plant grew<br><br> With this data I concluded that different wavelengths of light did affect the growth of plants, and that the 632.8 nm laser made the plants grow taller because it was at a lower frequency, closer to the blue-green frequency of light which plant naturally use. I also concluded that the electromagnet didn't effect the growth of the plants.

THE EFFECT OF CAFFEINATED WATER ON A SEED'S ABILITY TO REPAIR ITSELF FROM DNA DAMAGING UV RAYS
Brady L. Thompson
T.H. Bell Junior High, Ogden, Utah, USA

The purpose of the project was to test whether caffeine would inhibit the G2 arrest phase in seeds exposed to UV light. Exposure to UV light causes DNA damage which forces the seeds into G2 arrest. Caffeine is an efficient inhibitor of checkpoints that are activated by DNA damage. Radish and grass seeds had a shorter germination period than other seeds available to me at the time. These seeds were placed in wells according to the amount of UV exposure they were to receive. During the UV damage, the seeds were in contact with their appropriate liquid which they were also watered with over the course of the 10 day observation period. The liquids used were distilled water, 194.2 mg caffeine/ml water, and 388.4 mg caffeine/ml water. My data showed that the dose 194.2 mg caffeine/ml water did inhibit the G2 phase and increased the number of seeds germinated. The 388.4 mg caffeine/ml water dose was found to be toxic to the seeds. This led me to conclude that controlled amounts of caffeine inhibit G2 arrest allowing seeds to continue to grow even though they are damaged. <br><br>

INVESTIGATING THE PROPERTIES OF ENDOPHYTIC BACTERIA IN BRASSICA RAPA
Hilary Anne Peterson
Conrad Weiser Area High School, Robesonia Pennsylvania, USA

Microbial infestations result in millions of dollars of loss in the agricultural industry each year. Naturally occurring endophytic bacteria may supplement a plants chemical immune response to microbial invaders. This project researches endophytic bacteria residing in Brassica rapa. <br><br> Leaves were randomly gathered from the plant set, detoxified in a dilute bleach solution followed by a hydrogen peroxide solution and shredded aseptically. Isolation streaks were used to show the existence of an endophytic microbe population. Disk-diffusion testing (Kirby-Bauer method) with a liquid culture of the endophytic population and soil bacteria was used to determine the ability of the endophytes to defend against soil microbes. The disk-diffusion test results indicate the endophytic microbe population is effective in inhibiting growth of the soil microbial population. The initial point of plant inoculation was investigated by applying attenuated bacterial slurries onto the flower. <br><br> The endophytic microbes exhibit a symbiotic relationship with the plant leaves. The microbes may enhance the defense system of the plant and are provided a safe growth environment by the plant. Exploitation or enhancement of the symbiotic relationship could be developed to improve agriculture crops yields while reducing the dependence on chemicals. <br><br>

FLORA DIVERSITY COMPARISON-RIPARIAN RESTORATION PROJECT
Natalie - Benally
Wingate High School- Fort Wingate, NM- United States

-Abstract-<br><br>The purpose of this project was to analyze plant diversity and abundance in a riparian zone with and without tamarisk and to monitor changes after Tamarisk is removed. Two sites were established, one with and without tamarisk. Changes and the amount of vegetation were monitored by the Greenline/Cross-section transects. First, a box was set up at both sites with the channel running through it. The monitor walked the Greenline transects, which run along the channel, and recorded the number of steps, and the dominant plants in that area. When the monitor observed a change in dominant plants occurred, the monitor stopped; recorded the steps and the dominant plant in the area. When that was done, the monitor moved on to the next area and recorded what dominant plants were found there. This also applied to the Cross-section transects, which actually run across the channel, as well. After completing all transects for both sites, the percentage of vegetation was found using this formula: <br><br>Percent of vegetation=# of steps to each individual plant<br><br> (# of steps to each plant added together) X 100<br><br>This method would show whether or not differences in the riparian zone’s vegetation diversity and abundance existed. After percentages were calculated, charts and graphs were made for comparison. Eight species of plants were found in the tamarisk-invaded site and three were non-native to New Mexico. Ten species of plants were found at the non-tamarisk site and all were native.<br><br>

KUDZU: THE ULTIMATE INVADER: ALLELOPATHIC STUDY OF PUERARIA LOBATA ON THE GERMINATION OF QUERCUS PALUSTRIS AND SELECTED VEGETABLES
Lindsay Marie Stewart
Grove High School, Grove, Oklahoma, USA

Pueraria lobata (Kudzu) is one of the most aggressive growing vines in the world. Today an estimated 7 million acres of land in the southeast United States are infested with Kudzu, killing native vegetation through crowding and shading. The purpose of this research is to determine if the chemicals released from the Pueraria lobata (Kudzu Vine) will effect the percent of germination and survival rate of the Quercus palustris (Pin Oak) acorns and selected vegetable seeds. <br><br> It was hypothesized that the Kudzu leaves, stems and roots will produce allelochemicals, therefore decreasing the germination rate of the acorns and vegetable seeds. <br><br> To determine this three separate plant chemicals were prepared by mixing distilled water with the Kudzu leaves, stems, and roots. Selected vegetable seeds (Green beans, summer squash, and cucumbers) were moistened as need with the plant chemicals in four trays with 10 seeds each. One group only received distilled water. Quercus palustris (Pin oak) acorns were collected and put into cold stratification for 30 days. Four trays with forty acorns in each were moistened as needed with the kudzu chemicals until germination. <br><br> The results were that the Kudzu did produce lower germination rates in the vegetable seeds and the pin oak acorns. The leaf leachate had the strongest allelopathic effect. <br><br>

EBB, FLOW, AND RAFTING- IT'S NOT THE COLORADO! HYDROPONICS PART II
Lauren Marie Maloney
Plymouth North High School, Plymouth MA, USA

Hydroponics is a cost effective way to cultivate plants by utilizing a higher planting density per acre to yield more per acre than soil grown plants. Hydroponic systems are used to grow crops in places where land is contaminated, limited, or has other unfavorable conditions. The purpose of this project was to compare the growth of dwarf/bush bean plants (Phaseolus vulgaris) using an Aggregate Culture, to the growth of dwarf/bush bean plants using a Liquid Culture. The hypothesis was that the Ebb and Flow Method would grow larger plants than the Rafting Method, and also that the resulting seeds would germinate healthier and faster when sowed in rockwool as compared to perlite. Various mass measurements, the number of leaves, the stem length, and the leaf length were collected. Standard Benjamin Moore paint chips were used to compare leaf color. The dwarf/bush bean plants grown in the Ebb and Flow System had a larger average stem length and higher average root masses than the average of the dwarf/bush bean plants grown in the Rafting System. The Rafting System had longer average leaf lengths and plant greenery masses than the dwarf/bush bean plants grown in the Ebb and Flow System. Continuation of data collection may alter or support this conclusion.

OXIDATIVE DNA DAMAGE DURING SYMBIOSIS BETWEEN SINORHIZOBIUM MELILOTI AND THE ALFALFA PLANT
Balaji V. Sridhar
Cherry Creek High School, Greenwood Village, Colorado, USA

Sinorhizobium meliloti, a bacterium, fixes inert atmospheric nitrogen into usable ammonia for its plant host. The bacteria work symbiotically with plants by eliciting root nodule formation on the alfalfa plant. During this infection process, the oxidative elements in the environment affect the bacteria and cause damage to the bacterial DNA. It is hypothesized that the bacteria have mechanisms to quickly repair these mutations and are able to successfully complete symbiosis. <br><br> The goal of this experiment is to remove known repair genes to discover if there is actually any oxidative DNA damage during symbiosis. The genes recA, uvrA, sufC, and mutS were knocked out for the experiment. If Sinorhizobium is exposed to oxidative damage and does not have the necessary proteins encoded by these repair genes, it may not survive.<br><br> The uvrA, and recA were successfully transformed and knocked out of the Sinorhizobium chromosome. It was found that bacteria deficient in the recA and uvrA gene are sensitive to UV light, suggesting DNA damage did occur. When these mutants were placed on sterilized plants, growth of the plant did occur. The same was true of the wild type (used as a control) suggesting that some contamination occurred during experimentation even after sterilization.<br><br> Once it is possible to identify oxidative damage during symbiosis, the results can be applied to the human system. The alfalfa and Sinorhizobium system is similar to that of the Brucella pathogen and the human cell. If it is possible to target and remove similar DNA repair genes in the pathogen it will not be able to infect the human cell.<br><br>

EXAMINING FOREIGN GERMPLASM TO CONTROL FUSARIUM HEAD BLIGHT
Kimberly S. Richards
Walter Murray Collegiate, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan

North American barley production is threatened by Fusarium Head Bright (FHB). FHB results in yield reduction, decreases value of grain, and poor seed quality. The fungus produces a mycotoxin which is toxic to humans and animals and unwanted in the brewing industry. Breeding resistant cultivars is an effective strategy to manage FBH, but faces challenges as resistant genes are dispersed in the genome, quantitative trait loci are inconsistently detected among environments, and most QTLs for resistance result from pleiotropic effect of morphological and developmental genes. Ten phenotypic traits and DNA profiles for 72 newly identified resistant barleys were examined. Analysis of RAPD and ISSR gel images revealed 107 polymorphic bands against 117 primers, and the genetic variability among the 72 barley accessions was considerable. Relationships were found between agronomic and morphological traits and mycotoxin content and FHB germplasm similarity occurred related to region of origin (Western Russia, Central Asia, Asia, and North America); no similarity was found for any FHB resistance factors. Comparison of dendrograms using ISSR and RAPD primers revealed similar clusters of geographic origin, but not disease or plant traits. I found significant differences between two row vs. six row and between hulled and hulless barleys for several phenotypic and disease traits. Using this information will aid barley breeding programs and reduce the crop’s genetic vulnerability to FHB.

THE ALLELOPATHIC EFFECT OF THE ALBIZIA PROCERA TREE ON PANICUM MAXIMUN
Niomi Michelle Rodriguez-Santa
CROEM School, Mayaguez, PR

The term allelopathic effect is defined as the harmful or beneficial effects that one plant has over another. The objective of this investigation was to determine what part of the Albizia procera produces the allelopathic effect on Panicum maximun, and which chemical components can be associated with this effect. The experimentation done to test the hypothesis, consisted of two phases: the identification of the tree parts (leaves, trunks and roots) of Albizia procera that could produce the allelopathic effect, and the separation of the chemical components present in the extract of the Albizia procera. For the first phase, four groups of plants planted in flowerpots were used, one for the control group and three for the experimental groups. The experimental plants were sprinkled with extracts from the trunk, leaf and roots of Albizia procera, separately. The extracts were prepared using methanol, water and 10 grams from each part of the plant. The results obtained demonstrated an allelopathic effect, mostly produced by the leaves. For the second phase, the extract of Albizia procera leaves was tested with a Gas Chromatography using GC-MSD. The mass of the components in the chromatogram was used as a characterization method. According to this data, some possible fragments compatible with common herbicides, such as CF3, Cl, and N were identified. Findings of this research offer an environmental friendly alternative to control tropical weeds without using chemical herbicides. In a third phase, the extract will be tested on the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance to identify the components.

THE EFFECT OF BARK PEELINGS AND MARROW EXTRACTS FROM THE FOUR TYPES OF MANGROVES IN PUERTO RICO ON INFECTIONS CAUSED BY STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS. (PHASE II)
Abimael Cruz-Maldonado
Padre Anibal Reyes Belen High School, Hatillo, PR

Believers in natural medicine use gargles of different types of mangroves of Puerto Rico to cure throat infections. Knowing that many bacteria are becoming resistant to antibiotics it is important to find out alternatives to cure infections. The investigator considered that the extracts obtained from the bark peeling and the marrow of the mangroves: Laguncularia racemosa (white mangrove), Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove), Conocarpus erectus (button mangrove) and Avicennia germinans (black mangrove) are effective inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus which is present in throat infection. Different extracts from the bark peeling and the marrow of the different types of mangroves were made. Each one of these samples was then inoculated separately into a TSA cultivated medium of the Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. The obtained results proved that the extract of the bark peeling from the Laguncularia racemosa (white mangrove), Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove) and Conocarpus erectus (button mangrove), inhibit the growth of the Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. The marrow extracts from Avicennia germinans (black mangrove), Lagunularia racemosa (white mangrove) and Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove) inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. The marrow of Conocarpus erectus (button mangrove) and the bark peeling of the Avicennia germinans (black mangrove) did not inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. A future study could be made to find out the active ingredients in each of the extracts from all four types of mangroves that inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus.

ENVIRONMENTAL DIFFERENTIATION OF PINUS CONTORTA ON SERPENTINE SOIL
Sheila Marie Van Prooyen
Gold Beach High School, Gold Beach, Oregon, USA

Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) is a major conifer species in North America. Five races of lodgepole pine are recognized. The Del Norte race is found on serpentine soils in Del Norte County, CA. A lodgepole pine population is located in Curry County (OR) on serpentine soil, but the taxonomic status of this Red Flat population is unknown. The purpose of this project was to compare the morphology and DNA of the Red Flat population with three other P. contorta populations: southern Cascades lodgepole pine, southwestern Oregon/northwestern California shore pine and one Del Norte population. <br><br> Needle length, twist angle, and twist direction and bud length and width were measured to compare the populations. Soil samples were collected and analyzed for pH. Elemental analysis by neutron activation was run on both soil and needle tissue samples to determine elements present and their concentrations. Analysis of variance, Chi-square, and cluster analysis were used to analyze results. DNA was isolated from bud tissues. PCR was run on DNA with a specific lodgepole primer. Gel electrophoresis was run and gels were stained to visualize the DNA bands. The number of DNA base pairs in each band was calculated and populations were compared with cluster analysis. <br><br> Most morphology and genetics tests indicated a close relationship between the Red Flat population and the Del Norte race. Soil analysis indicates the Red Flat and Del Norte populations are found on similar soils, which may be the factor determining similar genetic differentiations levels.

THE EFFECT OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD IN THE GERMINATION AND STEM INCLINATION OF THE LYCOPERSICON ESCULENTUM MILL AND PORTULACA OLERACEA PLANTS.
Luis Alberto Vega Otero
Colegio Congregación Mita, San Juan, PR

Electromagnetism is the part of physics that studies the electromagnetic field: a field composed of an electric and a magnetic field. This research investigates the effect of an electromagnetic field in the germination and stem inclination of Lycopersicon esculentum Mill and Portulaca oleracea plants. The hypothesis established that the quantity of germinated seeds exposed to the electromagnetic field was less than the ones not exposed. Also, these exposed plants showed a stem inclination to the electromagnetic field. For this investigation two groups of seeds were prepared: one as the control group with no interaction with the electromagnetic field, and the other as the experimental group where the germinated seeds were exposed to the electromagnetic field. The electromagnetic field was created with a 12 volt battery and rolled cables connected on top of the boxes with the plants. At the end of five weeks, the researcher measured the height of the plants as they grew up, and calculated the degree of stem inclination in all the groups. It was found that the experimental group showed less quantity of germinated seeds than the control group, and a stem inclination was observed in the germinated seeds exposed to the electromagnetic field. This concludes that the created electromagnetic field affected the quantity of germinated seeds and its degree of stem inclination of both studied plants. As a future investigation the quantity and diameter of the leaves and other qualitative and quantitative properties in a long period of time can be studied.<br><br>

Buckminsterfullerenes, C-60, were discovered in 1985 at Rice University. The affect of C-60 on plants has not been determined. The experiment was performed to determine the affect that C-60 plus two other nanoparticles, TiO2 and SiO2, have on Wisconsin Fast Plants.<br><br> Four independent hydroponic growing systems were set up with 2L of distilled water and 285mL of a commercial fertilizer solution to grow Wisconsin Fast Plants. The mass and length of 30 sprouted seeds were collected and put into the tanks. A control tank with no added chemicals was used and concentrations of 5ppm, 1ppm, and .1ppm of the test chemicals were added to the other three tanks. After a growing period of 2 weeks, the seeds were measured for length and mass. <br><br>A T-Test showed a 91.61% difference of length between the Control and 5ppm tank in the SiO2 test group, a 98.02% difference in the 1ppm tank, and a 95.65% difference in the .1ppm tank. There was a 92.42% difference of mass between the Control and the 5ppm tank, a 97.38% difference in the1ppm tank, and a 97.36% difference in the .1ppm tank. <br><br> A T-Test showed a 44.56% difference of length from the Control in the 5ppm tank in the TiO2 test group, a 52.45% difference in the 1ppm tank, and an 83.82% difference in the .1ppm tank. There was a 60.26% difference of mass from the Control in the 5ppm tank, a 69.09% difference in the 1ppm tank, and a 96.79% difference in the .1ppm tank. <br><br> A T-Test showed a 99.88% difference of length between the Control and 5ppm tank in the C-60 test group, an 80.05% difference in the 1ppm tank, and a 70.83% difference in the .1ppm tank. There was 99.49% difference of mass between the Control and 5ppm tank, a 46.77% difference in the 1ppm tank, and an 87.73% difference in the .1ppm tank.<br><br>

RAPID AND REVERSIBLE PHOTOBLEACHING IN A GREEN PLANT, THE SPIDERWORT BOAT-LILY, TRADESCANTIA SPATHACEA (FAMILY COMMELINACEAE)
Philip Christopher Redding
Cookeville High School, Cookeville, Tennessee 

Rapid and reversible photobleaching of leaf color occurred in intact and detached leaves of Tradescantia spathacea after exposure to 1.5-22.0 klux incandescent light. The bleaching effect was positively related to both intensity of incident light and time of exposure. Photobleaching was induced by blue light and, to a lesser degree, red light. Apparent chlorophyll content was inversely correlated with bleaching. Because of its rapid, reliable, and repeatable photobleaching response, T. spathacea may be a good model organism for additional research on cellular mechanisms of photoprotection. <br><br>

A COMPARATIVE STUDY FOR MARKETABILITY OF THE F1 GENERATION OF CUCURBITA PEPO
Laura Jo Bruner
Pettisville High School, Pettisville, Ohio, United States of America

The American producer and consumer need knowledge of the contribution of Cucurbita pepo to a healthy diet. Will commercially produced F1 hybrids of Cucurbita pepo possess the comparable characteristics of the industry’s standards of sugar content, dry matter, and yield in order to achieve consumer acceptability and profitable marketability? The F1 hybrids of Cucurbita pepo were hypothesized to possess acceptable characteristics to be produced in a commercial breeding project. The breeding program consisted of the harvesting and preparing of eighty fruit for testing. The evaluation of the characteristics included the Brix test for sugar content, the dry matter test for texture, and percent yield. The data supported the hypothesis. All the F1 hybrids when compared to the industry standards gave the indication for profitable marketability and consumer acceptability based on the characteristics tested. The F1 hybrid with the lowest percentage of Brix was higher than the standard by 2.70%, the lowest percentage of dry matter was higher than the standard by 0.45%, and the lowest percent yield of pounds of fruit per plot was 2.95 lbs. higher than the standard. The analysis of variance compares the statistical differences between varieties within a plot and the unaccounted error which cannot be attributed to the variety. The analysis of variance indicated the varieties of Cucurbita pepo that would continue to be studied in a commercial breeding project.

IN SEARCH OF A NATURAL TREATMENT FOR PUCCINIA HEMEROCALLIDIS
Kyle James Yawn
Warner Robins High School, Warner Robins, GA, USA

Puccinia hemerocallidis (daylily rust) has been in North America for four years. This fungal disease has devastated the gardens of thousands of daylily growers. Currently no fungicide has been approved for the use on daylily rust and no natural remedies are known. The purpose of this project is to find an environmentally safe, method to make daylilies more resistant to this. Soluble silicon was chosen because it has shown resistance to fungi before with no side effects. The hypothesis of this experiment is, if a potassium silicate, a sodium/potassium silicate and an ammonia silicate is applied to the daylily ramets that have a history of daylily rust, then the silicates will make the ramets more resistant to the rust. One-hundred and twenty Hemerocallidis cv. ‘Pardon Me’ and 120 Hemerocallidis cv. ‘Stella De Oro’ were planted in five plots equally. With in each plot they were futher divided into 4 sections which, at random, received one of the applications. The applications were applied once every week at 80ml of 1 part silicate to every 100 parts water. These were sprayed onto the foliage of each ramet. Water was applied to the other section in each plot at 80ml as a control group. After nine weeks the pustules of rust spores were counted. The ammonia silicate averaged less pustules than any other application on either cultivar. These results confirm the hypothesis that the application of a silicon solution can help daylilies resist infection. Further experimentation is planned to determine the optimum methods.

NUTRACEUTICAL INTERVENTION OF THE NFKB PATHWAY TO REDUCE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF INFLAMMATION AND TUMORIGENESIS
Aaron Tuc-Lon Cheung
South Carolina Governor's School for Science and Mathematics; Hartsville, SC; US

This research project investigates the pathways by which nutraceuticals are able to prolong physical endurance. Nutraceuticals are naturally occurring compounds that have health-promoting properties. The nutraceuticals in this study have previously been shown to prolong physical endurance. However, the specific pathway by which they did this is unknown. Cytokines are chemicals released during inflammation that have been found to reduce physical performance and affect cancer development. The hypothesis that was tested in this research was whether the nutraceuticals were able to prolong physical endurance by inhibiting the NFKB Pathway, a pathway that ultimately results in cytokine production. If the specific pathway by which these nutraceuticals act upon is pinpointed, it may be possible to more effectively and efficiently inhibit the same pathway in the future. Coincidentally, inhibition of the NFKB Pathway inhibits activation of the IKB molecule, which has been shown in previous research to significantly increase cancerous tumor growth and size. Therefore, if the nutraceuticals are able to inhibit the NFKB Pathway, they may also be possible candidates for cancerous treatment. Tests were conducted on mice macrophages determining the extent to which three selected nutraceuticals, Astragalus, Curcumin and Muscadine, inhibited cytokine production. The nutraceuticals were then introduced to Luciferase-transfected mice macrophages to establish whether they inhibited cytokine production via the NFKB pathway. The results strongly suggested that both Astragalus and Muscadine were significant inhibitors of cytokines via the NFKB Pathway. However, Curcumin had no measurable impact on cytokine inhibition.

THE HORMESIS PHENOMENON: IMPLICATIONS FOR USING LOW DOSES OF HARMFUL AGENTS TO STIMULATE PLANT GROWTH
Jordan Dexter Crafton
Uniondale High School, Uniondale New York, USA

Over the past couple of years, there have been concerns regarding the authenticity of harmful chemicals at large doses becoming beneficial when given in small doses. Those applications involving the induction of harmful physical/chemical agents that are harmful at larger doses which are beneficial at smaller doses is known as hormesis. <br><br> My research primarily focused on shocks of radiation and temperature. In the first pretreatment, in which Glycine max seeds were sterilized and germinated over 24 hours at which they were planted in oasis horticubes. These horticubes were placed in small planting pots so they could fit directly under the mouth of a fire extinguisher, which allowed me to blast the seeds with 1-second spurts of Cold CO2. It is common knowledge that plants can die due to excessive coldness caused by frost, therefore “Cold Shock” was only administered every other day allowing the seeds 24 hours to recover from each shock and only until seedling growth was visible. The second pretreatment consisted of administering “Cold Shock” once and exposing the seeds to a minute exposure period of UV-C (Extremely Dangerous Ultraviolet Radiation) which was 10 minutes. The same treatment was performed, however the exposure period was changed to a much larger dose which was 20 minute. <br><br> Each pretreatment consisted of a control group and an experimental group that way I was able to observe how the Glycine max seeds reacted in varying environments. These treatments have shown that the true purpose of hormesis is not to harm the organism but to make it operate at optimum efficiency. As a result of the minute dosage periods of UV-C and minute shock periods of Cold Shock that plants exhibited a significant increased growth cycle when comparing them to the control group.<br><br>

ORGANIC FERTILIZERS AND THEIR EFFECTS ON THE PINTO BEAN PLANT
Bryce William Robinson
American Fork High School, American Fork, Utah, USA

Animals housed on pastures urinate and defecate all over the plants they feed and live on. Nitrogen is an important element in plant nutrition and in the ecosystem. This study deals with plant growth affected by animal excrements. Also, mass spectrometry analysis is used to observe the nitrogen cycle from the plant to the animal, and isotope ratios of 15N and 14N. Urine and Feces nitrogen aid in plant growth and health. Given urines properties of nitrogen concentrations, it can be harmful to the plants. Deficeincies become present in those plants not receiving sufficeint amounts of the animal excrements. In beginning this expirement, pinto bean plants were germinated in vermiculate Growing media. hydroponics was selected as the growing media for the study. Control solutions were made by creating complete fertilizer solutions. For the urine and feces solution, a complete solution was created and the animal excrement was added. Growth was measured for treatments of 0, 10, 50, and 100ml of urine and fecal from alpaca, goats and horses. The plants were analyzed in a mass spectrometer to find isotope ratios between 15N and 14N. For growth, the urine for all the animals is quite detrimental in high concentrations. Plants receiving small amounts of urine grew well, but showed signs of deficeincy. Feces helped plants in health and growth, however, they did not match up to growth of the control plants. in comparison with the mass spectrometer data, high 15N numbers correlated with poor growth. in conlusion, animals urine gives plants nitrogen they need, but extreme amounts kill the plants. feces aid in growth and health of plants because they contain the appropriate ratio between 14N and 15N that plants prefer.

THE KILLER IN THE GARDEN: THE ALLELOPATHIC EFFECTS OF ACER SACCHARUM MARSH, CORNUS FLORIDA L., AND MAGNOLIA GRANDIFLORA L.
Amanda Josephine Compadre
Little Rock Central High School, Little Rock, AR, United States of America

This experiment was designed to determine if common landscape trees have allelopathic effects against lawn grasses and garden plants, and to identify the structure of the most allelopathic compound. The hypotheses were that common landscape trees have allelopathic effects against both lawn grasses and garden plants, and these effects are produced by unique compounds. Leaves from three common landscape trees, the maple (Acer saccharum Marsh), the dogwood (Cornus florida L.), and the magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora L.), were used to make the extracts. Then, a screening experiment was conducted with two concentrations of each extract on radish and rye seeds. A bioassay directed fractionation was then conducted to determine to location of the most allelopathic compounds. The most allelopathic compound was isolated and injected into a Gas Chromatogram/ Mass Spectrum. The results of the screening showed that at both concentrations all three extracts were significant in inhibiting the growth of the radish and rye seedling. The results of the experiment also showed that the inhibition of germination rates was more pronounced with rye seeds. The results of the bioassay directed fractionation confirmed the results of the screening experiment, and the most allelopathic compound was found in the dogwood extract and named CF3. The more allelopathic compounds were found to be very polar since their location was towards the bottom of the thin-layer chromatography plates. Thus, water could easily leach the allelopthic chemcials of decaying leaves into lawns and garden. In addition, compound CF3 was identified as a glycoside compound.

EFFECT OF CHLOROPHYLL CONTENT ON EXTENT OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS
Yun Song
Herschel V. Jenkins High School, Savannah GA, USA

Photosynthesis is an essential process for both aquatic plants and other organisms in their environs: it provides plants with food and animal life with oxygen. In lakes and rivers where oxygen levels are low, planting an abundance of aquatic vegetation with high photosynthetic rates may raise oxygen levels. Because being able to examine leaf color (a greener color indicates higher chlorophyll content) to determine an aquatic plant’s photosynthetic rate would be simplest, the effect of chlorophyll content on the rate of aquatic plant photosynthesis was examined. Chlorophyll converts light energy into chemical energy necessary for photosynthesis, so it was hypothesized that higher chlorophyll content would provide for a higher rate of photosynthesis. Elodea and Acorus Variegatus were used for the research. Extent of photosynthesis was measured through water pH variations caused by each plant. Because increases in pH are due to CO2 consumption during photosynthesis, a plant with greater pH increases must also have a higher rate of CO2 consumption, and thus greater extent of photosynthesis. Elodea was found to cause much larger pH increases than Acorus Variegatus. Chlorophyll content was measured by extracting chlorophyll from plant leaves using MgCl2 and methanol, and measuring absorbance values at 650 nm and 665 nm using a spectrophotometer. Chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b contents were then calculated using absorbance values. Both chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b contents were higher in Elodea than in Acorus Variegatus. Therefore, chlorophyll content affects photosynthesis: higher chlorophyll content results in greater extent of photosynthesis.

`OHELO: INHIBITION OF BACTERIAL GROWTH
Jessie Ann Ka`iulani Pa`ahana
Kamehameha High School, Honolulu, HI USA

The purpose of this project is to test for the medicinal properties of Vaccinium reticulatum, commonly known as ohelo in Hawai'i. Historical accounts confirm that the leaves of the ohelo were made into a tea and administered to patients to treat throat congestion by Hawaiian medicinal practitioners or kahuna laau lapaau. Therefore, the leaves were the source for the extract used for biological and analytical testing. A biological survey using bacterial bioassays were conducted to evaluate the inhibition of bacteria grown in vitro on LB agar by ohelo extract. The fact that such outstanding inhibition zones were detected against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, some of which surpassed the inhibiting abilities of penicillin, implies that this plant may be an important addition to the medical world. These results in relation to the emerging concern that gram-positive antibacterial agents are rare, and those bacteria that can be subdued are developing an increasing resistance to those antibiotics. Prominent inhibition zones led to the second part of this project, which was to identify the antibacterial component within the chemical composition of the plant. Thin Layer Chromatograms were conducted to visually display the various molecules, which make up the ohelo extract. Current experimentation is attempting to identify which of these molecules are responsible for the inhibition of bacterial growth. If the component of interest can be identified and synthetically replicated, it could significantly reduce the growing epidemic of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

AN ECOFRIENDLY APPROACH TO CONTROLLING THE FILARIASIS AND DENGUE FEVER VECTOR, AEDES POLYNESIENSIS, IN AMERICAN SAMOA
Andrew Pati Ah Young
Tafuna High School, Tafuna AS

The present phase of the study aimed to evaluate and confirm the toxicity of turmeric rhizome (Curcuma longa) and nonu (Morinda citrifolia) leaf extract compared with malathion and pyrethrin formulations against Aedes polynesiensis larvae. The collection of larvae was done by placing containers filled with rainwater and yeast in locations conducive for Ae. polynesiensis breeding. Extracts were made using a traditional extraction method; fresh turmeric rhizomes and nonu leaves were blended separately in dechlorinated water using a blender, and filtered through a fine cloth. Pesticide concentrations were prepared according to the amount of active ingredients present in each pesticide in addition to recommended doses. <br><br> Mortality data were noted every 24 hours, compiled and analyzed using a POLO-PC computer program to identify lethal concentrations for each solution. After analysis, results indicate that LC50 value for turmeric, nonu, malathion and pyrethrin in 24 hours were 1.79 ml/L, 11.9 ml/L, 0.3 ppm and 2.95 ppm. Low concentrations of malathion and pyrethrin were toxic to Ae. polynesiensis larvae, primarily because they are neurotoxin poisons that kill pests by disrupting their nervous system. Results also indicate the effectiveness of extracts of turmeric and nonu as larvicides against Ae. polynesiensis. Although low concentrations of plant extracts displayed less mortality, they did, however hinder the development process of Ae. polynesiensis. Results clearly suggest that natural compounds present in turmeric and nonu extracts are promising larvicides against Ae. polynesiensis and could be useful in the search for newer, more selective, and biodegradable larvicidal agents to be used in official combat programs and at home. <br><br>

PLANT GERMINATION AND GROWTH IN FLYASH-AMENDED SOIL
Natalie Marie Schuetz
Notre Dame Academy, Park Hills, KY, United States of America

The effects of flyash on the germination and growth of the crop plants wheat and radishes were tested between the months of January-March 2005. Twenty-four Styrofoam cups were filled with potting soil and/or a concentration of 5%, 10%, and 20% potting soil and flyash. Wheat and radish seeds were then planted and placed in a greenhouse where they were observed and watered as needed over a period of twenty days. After the twenty-day observation period, the plants were uprooted. Wet and dry masses of roots and leaves were determined separately. From the results, it was found that concentrations of flyash in the presence of potting soil tend to retard the germination of plants. The height of the plants was not affected by the concentration of flyash present in the soil. In addition, the average leaf mass of wheat had no considerable differences with the exception of the leaf mass of plants in 20% flyash, which was greatly reduced. The average leaf mass of radishes showed no pronounced difference, regardless of the flyash concentration. The average root mass of wheat was enhanced in 5% and 10% concentrations, whereas the average root mass of radishes showed no noticeable difference. It was concluded that concentrations of 5%-10% flyash in the presence of potting soil can successfully sustain the growth of crop plants.

DETERMINING GAMMA SENSITIVITY OF DOUBLE MUTANT ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA FOR DNA REPAIR GENES XPF AND ERCC1
Vibha Mahendra
Mira Loma High School, CA, USA

This project is meant to determine Arabidopsis thaliana sensitivity to ionizing radiation in plants that are mutant for the DNA repair genes XPF and ERCC1. XPF produces a protein that works in a complex with another protein, ERCC1, to repair DNA that has been damaged by ionizing radiation. The first hypothesis states that it is the defective XPF protein in the XPF/ERCC1 complex that inhibits the DNA repair. This hypothesis implies that the damaged DNA cannot be corrected with mutant XPF, regardless of whether or not ERCC1 endonuclease are present. The second hypothesis still recognizes that the XPF protein is defective/absent, but instead attributes the uncorrected DNA damage to ERCC1, which, without its active partner XPF, inhibits additional proteins that would otherwise repair the damaged DNA. <br><br> The purpose of the experiment is to identify and irradiate Arabidopsis that are mutant for both genes, to determine whether or not the absence of XPF coupled with the presence of ERCC1 causes gamma sensitivity in these plants. Through PCR, gel electrophoresis, restriction digests, irradiation tests, and plant growth from irradiated seeds, preliminary data indicates that the second hypothesis is incorrect. It appears that plants that are double mutant are equally, if not more, gamma sensitive than those that are mutant for only the XPF gene. <br><br>

NEW CHALLENGES TO FIGHT AGAINST FUNGAL DISEASES OF PLANTS
Zuzana Tvarùžková
Gymnázium Kromeriz, Kromeriz, Czech Republic

The objectives of this work were to detect fungicidal effects in some plant extracts and their mixtures on intact plants. Plant extracts from 17 species of medicinal plants were tested for their effect against powdery mildew on barley (Blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei) under glasshouse conditions. Extracts were tested in the following concentrations: 2.5%, 10%, 20% and their two-component and four-component mixtures and mixtures of extract 20% + surface activator GREEMAX and extract 20% + olive oil. All treatments created from plant extracts showed statistically significant suppression of powdery mildew development. <br><br>Plant extracts of Abies balsamea (L.) Mill showed the highest fungicidal effect. The treatment was effective under all concentrations tested, especially in mixture with olive oil. Other effective treatments included extract from Lavandula officinalis Chaix et Kitt., Ptelea trifoliata L. with oil, and Allium sativum L. all in mixture with oil and Ligusticum changxiong Hort. <br><br>Thirteen plant extracts from a total of seventeen tested showed increased fungicidal effects when in combination with plant oil. <br><br>The highest fungicidal activity was obtained when four plant extracts were combined: Alium ursinum, Pinus nigra Arnold, Ligusticum changxiong Hort. and Schisandra chinensis (Turcz). Addition of GREEMAX to this mixture increase the fungicidal effect compared to original extracts as well as when in mixture with plant oil.<br><br>

EFFECTS OF INDOLE-3-BUTYRIC ACID ON WILD AND DOMESTICATED GRAPEVINE ROOT FORMATION
Sun Qiu
Greenwood Laboratory School, Springfield, Missouri, USA

Wild grapevines are good genetic materials to generate new grape cultivars with higher hardiness. The goal of this experiment is to find a better method of propagating three wild grapevines. I investigated effects of indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), which is a plant rooting hormone, on root formation on hard-wood cuttings of three wild grapevines (Vitis acerifolia, Vitis aestivlalis, and Vitis rupestris)in comparison with one domesticated grapevine (Vitis vinifera).<br><br> I collected 120 hard-wood cuttings of each grape species and grouped them into 12 bundles. I dipped 3 bundles in each of the four IBA solutions of 0ppm, 1000ppm, 10,000ppm, and 100,000ppm for 3 replicas and buried the solution-immersed ends in soil. I recorded the number of roots on each cutting and performed data analysis.<br><br> The data showed that the highest concentration of IBA resulted in the highest number of roots in two wild grapevines. Vitis aestivalis did not form any roots for any concentration. Vitis acerifolia had no roots for 0ppm, average of 0.86 roots per cutting for 1000ppm, 3.66 for 10,000ppm and 12.5 for 100,000ppm. Vitis rupestris formed 2.7 roots per cutting for 0ppm, 2.8 for 1000ppm, 10.2 for 10,000, and 15.3 for 100,000ppm. Vitis vinifera had average of 2.2, 10.2, 6.2, and 16.8 roots per cutting for 0ppm, 1000ppm, 10,000ppm, and 100,000ppm, respectively.<br><br> In summary, dipping hard-wood cuttings with IBA solution of 10,000ppm is adequate for rooting two wild grapevines (Vitis acerifolia and Vitis rupestris). Rooting behavior is also different among the four grape species.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF WOUNDING ON THE INDUCTION OF AGROBACTERIUM TUMEFACIENS
Nahid S. Shaikh
Lawrence High School, Cedarhurst, New York, USA

Two trials were carried out in this experiment to prove that the production of a phenolic compound, acetosyringone, by Arabidopsis seedlings could occur and be quantified without the use of wounding. Plants were infected with the A348virE-gfp strain of Agrobacterium tumefaciens with a virE-Green Fluorescent Protein (gfp) fusion. This fusion enabled the release of acetosyringone to be monitored. Whenever the plant released acetosyringone, the bacteria on the plant’s root hairs would fluoresce green. In this experiment it was found that plants release acetosyringone without wounding, but less than wounded plants and can be quantified using flow cytometry.

THE EFFECTS OF ELEVATED HUMIDITY ON THE RATE OF PLANT GROWTH
Hudson Taylor Dunn
Wolford High School, Wolford, North Dakota

In this experiment the effects of elevated humidity were demonstrated on a group of twent-eight bean plants. Prior to the experiment, it was hypothesized that the plants grown under increased humidity would grow at a faster rate than those grown under normal conditions. Sixty bean sees were sprouted and split into two groups. One group of thirty was placed in a plexi-glass terrarium to be grown under elevated humidity levels. The other group was used as the control and was grown under normal conditions. Both groups of plants received equal amonts of water and sunlight. During the experiment it was observed that two of the bean seeds placed in the terrarium did not sprout. The plants grown under elevated humidity grew much faster than those grown under normal conditions. These results suggest that humidty is an important factor in determining the growth rate of beans.

IMPACT OF LICHEN (XANTHOPARMELIA CHLOROCHROA) TOXICITY ON ELK POPULATIONS- POSSIBLE ROLE OF CLIMATE
Erin Dianne Michelena, Amy Kathleen Feller
Greybull High School Greybull, Wyoming USA

On Feb. 8th, two cow elk were found that could not rise and run when approached. As Game and Fish field crewmembers searched, the number of elk affected increased to nearly 300, scattered around the department’s Daley Ranch wildlife habitat area near Rawlins, Wyoming. Scientists found Xanthoparmelia chlorochroa in the stomachs of affected elk. The hypothesis was that climate would play a role in varying usnic acid levels in the lichen. <br><br> Lichen was obtained from Wyoming department of Game and Fish. The lichen was grown under four different temperature conditions (freezer, refrigerator, room temperature, and in an Environmental Chamber) to see if variations in temperature had any affect on the toxicity of the lichen. The conditions were maintained for a two- week period. <br><br> Usnic acid was extracted from the lichen by placing a total of 1.0g of dried, crushed lichen into a 25 mL flask. Next, 7.0 mL of acetone was poured into the same flask. The resulting mixture was then filtered by gravity, and the filtrate was collected in a 10 mL flask. The acetone solvent was then evaporated, leaving behind the crude usnic acid. The crude material was re-crystallized from acetone and ethanol and the yellow crystals that formed were collected by vacuum filtration and dried. Finally, the yellow needles of usnic acid were weighed and results were converted into percentages. The same procedure was repeated for each sample of lichen. <br><br> It was found that the hypothesis was correct. Climate seemed to have a greater effect on the acid levels in the lichen when the climate was much cooler than normal. We are able to indicate that climate was a possible factor in increasing the acid levels that were in the lichen. These results may contribute to a final answer to the “Red Rim Elk Mystery”. <br><br>

UNDERSTANDING ROLES OF GENE FAMILIES THROUGH STUDIES OF GENE AT1G68780 IN ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA DEVELOPMENT
John James Hutchison, Varun Rajendra Hippalgaonkar
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando Florida, United States

Arabidopsis thaliana is a plant often used in biological experiments. Scientists make use of its relatively small genome, short life cycle, and compact growing area in expirements. Too Many Mouths (At1g80080) is a gene in Arabidopsis that plays a role in a position-dependent signaling pathway that controls the plane of patterning divisions. It is also suggested that TMM plays a role in signal transduction. TMM is in the same gene family, coding for a protein similar in structure, to gene At1g68780, the gene being studied. The role of At1g68780 in Arabidopsis is unknown to scientists therefore the knowledge of its gene family is limited. Methods such as DNA isolation, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to further understand this gene. Gene At1g68780 is predicted to play a role in asymmetric divisions, having a similar function to that of TMM but not having a redundant role. Initial results indicate At1g68780 plays a role in the stomatal shape, elongation or distortion of guard cells was noticed when gene was not expressed, or possibly in the division of stomata in the epidermis of the Arabidopsis leaf. The initial results indicate that At1g68780 plays a role in the stomata, but its role was not the same as the role TMM plays. Irregularity in stomatal shape during the closing stages was noticed, these stomata were incapable of closing properly. Additionally, this study provides information for and increases the understanding of the relatively unknown topic that is gene families, giving indications that gene family members do not have redundant roles. This study can further help scientist understand tissue development in plants aswell. Because of At1g68780s structural similarities to defense mechanisms in plants this research will help scientists understand plant defense mechanisms allowing them to help stop pathogens interfering with plant growth. The research conducted also contributes to the study of plant tissue, essential to furthering success in agricultural fields.

BIODIESEL: FUELS OF THE FUTURE
Darrick Richard Ohr, Harold Klausner
Woodlin School, Woodrow, Colorado, USA

The purpose of our project is to grow Canola and Brown Mustard, apply nitrogen and sulfur to each plant type, and observe the growth and overall appearance. Analyze each biofuel ratio and oils for temperature, viscosity, and cloudiness. Plant cultivars of Canola and Brown Mustard seeds. Vary the amounts of sulfur and nitrogen. Examine the cultivars overall appearance. Mix different ratios of diesel to biofuel oils. Test for viscosity, cloudiness and illumination on the different oils. The plants height, leaves and condition were observed, measured, and on appearance. None of the Canola plants died. Changing the amount of applied sulfur did not show any affect on the Canola’s growth, leaves, or height. Applying equal amounts of sulfur and nitrogen (6:6) was the most productive ratio for Brown mustard. The cloud point and pour rate were analyzed. Palm Oil is the only oil not recommended for any type of biofuel mixture below freezing, although it may be suitable for warm temperature locations. Blue-Sun Soy and used restaurant oil were suitable to the 50 percent mixtures at below zero temperatures. The researchers conclude that the most suitable choice of biofuel use in 0 to -10 degrees Celsius conditions, Iowa soy oil can be used up to a 50:50 ratio with conventional diesel.

THE EFFECT OF SUPPLEMENTAL PLANT SIGNALING COMPOUNDS ON STRESS RESPONSE IN ORYZA SATIVA
David Brooks Kaufman, Khannan Kameshvaran Athreya, Basil Harbi Shadfan
Keystone School, San Antonio, Texas, USA

As one of the world’s staple crops, Oryza sativa now sustains Asia’s billions of people and can be found in nearly every country in the world. Yet, continually fulfilling the gargantuan demand for rice is a task yet to be accomplished. Rather than altering the environment to suit its needs, one can more easily affect the stress protein production of the rice, causing it to more effectively counter various environmental stresses. The purpose of this project is to increase the health and prosperity of Oryza sativa by enhancing its ability to produce stress proteins and, thus resist drought, hypersalinity, and excessive heat, through exposure to the supplementary plant signaling compounds Jasmonic acid, Salicylic acid, and Abscisic acid. By supplementing the naturally occurring plant signaling compounds, the ability of Oryza sativa to resist environmental stress will be enhanced, thus promoting increased stress protein production, longer life, and better overall health. After six days of exposure to the various stresses, it was found that Jasmonic was most effective in resistance of heat and drought stresses while Abscisic was most effective in resistance of salt stress. Gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometer tests showed an increase of chlorophyll with exposure to stress and a subsequent decrease upon introduction of an acid, suggesting that, with the enhanced protein production, energy was diverted away from chlorophyll production. Statistical analysis showed significance, meaning that the aforementioned methods of plant treatment could lead to more reliable and continuous rice production in the face of the ever-changing environment.

Juneau Douglas High School, Juneau, Alaska, United States 

The purpose of this experiment was to discover how age and succession type affect forest overstory and understory composition. <br><br> We chose eight sites to survey, located throughout Juneau. Four sites had been logged (examples of secondary succession following disturbance) and the other four had been covered by the Mendenhall Glacier (examples of primary succession following disturbance). The vegetation in each survey plot was quantified based on tree height, type, diameter, stem count and density, crown depth, vegetation cover, wood, and litter cover. <br><br> Our results did not support our null hypothesis. Variation between the two successional types was significant, as was variation between different-aged sites. In the understory of all sites forb, fern, and shrubs initially surged, with reduced growth as stand age increased. We noticed a higher tree density in primary succession sites than secondary. Especially in the younger primary succession sites, density lessened with stand age. <br><br> In primary succession sites, trees were taller, thicker, and grew faster than trees in secondary succession sites. Primary succession sites showed mostly alder, followed by willow and spruce. Secondary succession sites primarily contained hemlock, followed by spruce and red alder. <br><br> This study shows how two major disturbance types affect development of wildlife habitat. Also, the study is important documentation of plant re-growth in logged sites of varying ages. Study results can be used by professionals interested in effects of clear-cut logging on Southeast Alaska's forests. It can help predict the successional habitat types that support certain plants, and ultimately, certain animals. <br><br>

ULTRASONIC FREQUENCY APPLICATIONS IN THE FIELD OF PLANT DEVELOPMENT AND PROPAGATION
Joel Winchel Sorensen, Jeremiah Huber
Greybull High School, Greybull WY, United States

This experimentation tested the affects of ultrasonic frequency applications on Wisconsin Fast Plants. The hypothesis was that these frequencies would enhance the overall growth of the plant. If effective, food production could be increased dramatically without the use of chemicals and other earth-harmful materials. The first test series involved growing these plants and exposing them to ultrasonic frequency generator. Plants were exposed for predetermined time intervals. A different group of the plants were unexposed as a control. The growth of the plants was recorded periodically. The second test series involved exposing germinating Fast Plant seeds to ultrasonics. This was done to determine if the frequencies had any effect on germination rates. The seeds were placed in a beaker with a paper towel. Half of the seeds were exposed, the other half were not. The lengths of the roots to the stem were recorded. Supplemental experimentation involved radish exposure to ultrasonics to determine if there was a similar pattern in different species. Half of the radishes were exposed to ultrasonics at the first sign of sprouting, and the other half remained unexposed for use as a control. Both exposed and unexposed radishes were uprooted at staggered times to allow for weight and height measurements. A similar pattern was apparent in all testing. Plants that had been exposed to ultrasonics were characteristically larger than those that were not exposed. It was concluded that ultrasonic frequency applications do enhance a plant's overall growth, and increases their potential for survival.

CLONAL REPRODUCTION OF NATIVE AND ENDEMIC PLANTS IN HIGH RISK OF EXTINCTION IN THE HIGH ANDEAN ECOSYSTEMS OF CHILE
Camilo Jose Farias, Ivan Alexis Gaete, Franco Andres Colon
Liceo Domingo Herrera Rivera, Antofagasta, Chile

Opuntia Sp (Cactaceous), Cristaria Sp (Malvacea) and Acantholippia Sp (Verbenacea) are three vegetable species that grow at 1.600 m above sea level. Many of these plants have a high potential as producers of phytochemicals that can be used in medecine. Man with industries and mining has dangerously damaged the High Andean Ecosystems of the Region of Antofagasta, which has affected enormously the native flora, leaving it at high risk of extintion; it is for this reason that development of a method of merisystemic weave culture for the clonal reproduction of these plants, with the purpose of preserving the biodiversity of the native and endemic vegetation, is very important. The vegetable material, near to ground samples, was collected in San Pedro de Atacama (22°55' South latitude, 68°12' West longitude) and it was then taken to Antofagasta. The culture medium was prepared using the liquid component of filtered earth with agar. Six pieces of stem of 0.5 cm in length were cut, sterilized and seededin wide mouth bottles, these were put in an incubator under fluorescent light (300 - 700 nm) for a period of eight hours daily. Three clones of Opuntia Sp, two of Cristaria Sp and two of Acantholippia Sp were obtained of the total incubated. The designed protocol of micropropagation was efficient for the production of clones in the three species studied.

THE SOLANIUM NIGRUM PLANT: NATURAL ANTACID
Alondra Mar Abrams, Debbiann Centeno
Colegio Evangelico Capitan Correa, Arecibo, Puerto Rico

The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the idea that the extract of Solanium nigrum was a natural antacid just as our grandparents used to say. To carry out this investigation the stem, leaves, and flowers of the Solanium nigrum plant were used. Four different masses of Solanium nigrum plant were measured(6.7g, 7.7g,14g, and 21g). Each sample was boiled separately for four minutes in 50mL of distilled water. The aqueous solutions were left to rest. A sample of 0.5mL of each aqueous solution was used to measured its pH. The pH of 0.5mL of hydrochloric acid was measured. Each of the four aqueous solutions of Solanium nigrum were mixed with HCl and the pH was measured. The pH of the distilled water,the HCl, the aqueous solutions, and the plant extracts were also measured. The results showed that the four aqueous solutions neutralized the pH of the HCl. The pH of the HCl changed from 2-3 to a pH of 7. These results make it possible to conclude that the aqueous solutions of Solanium nigrum are effective to neutralize the pH of the HCl, and therefore the alternate hypothesis proved to be true.<br><br> <br><br> <br><br>

THE INFLUENCE OF MYCORRHIZAL AND FERTILIZER TREATMENTS ON TREE SEEDLINGS IN FIRE-AFFECTED SOILS
Michael R. Olson, Chad A. Schlottmann
Gold Beach High School, Gold Beach, OR, USA

Tree planting success after a wildfire may be poor due to the changed environment. Wildfire-affected soils can have increased pH, reduced native mycorrhizal inoculum, and decreased nutrient levels (especially nitrogen). Planted tree survival and growth may be increased with mycorrhizal inoculation and/or fertilizer application at the time of planting. Research on the effectiveness of these treatments for Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine planted on a range of soil burn severities is lacking. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of slow-release fertilizer (24:10:6 plus micronutrients) and/or mycorrhizal inoculation at the time of planting on the first-year success of planted Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine on sites with low, medium and high soil burn severities. Treatments were applied to rows of 10 trees and replicated three times in each burn severity. Measurements included mortality, budbreak, nitrogen and carbon content, shoot growth, root and stem volume growth, diameter growth and percent latewood. <br><br> Nutrients were more limiting on these sites than native mycorrhizal inoculum. No treatments increased survival; fertilizer treatments increased growth significantly compared to control and mycorrhizae-only treatments. Non-fertilizer treatments (control and mycorrhizae-only) had significantly greater numbers of mycorrhizal root tips per cubic centimeter of root volume.

CARBONIC ANHYDRASE: EXPRESSION IN DIOSCOREA AND MOLECULAR EVOLUTION IN ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA, ORYZA SATIVA, AND DIOSCOREA SPECIES
Heather Ann Casper, Benjamin Alan Pollack
Plainview-Old Bethpage John F. Kennedy High School, Plainview New York, U.S.

The Dioscorea genus is made up of a group of monocotyledonous plants comprising the "true yams”. Yam is an important staple crop, which is made up mainly of carbohydrates but also constitutes an important source of proteins which make up 1-3% of the fresh tubers (Gaidamashvili et al., 2004). This research uses Dioscorea alata, D. villosa, D. bulbifera, D. dodecaneura, and D. nipponica to determine the expression profile of the enzyme, carbonic anhydrase (CAH), in varying structural components of yams. This profile was determined by conducting PCR amplification of cDNA samples and analyzing them through gel electrophoresis and sequencing. Using the extracted CAH sequences from the Dioscorea species and CAH amino acid sequences from the international database, GenBank, of Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa, this project infers evolutionary relationships between the three taxa. Determining the evolutionary history of CAH allows for a better understanding of the evolution of the Dioscorea genus as a whole.<br><br>CAH expression was confirmed in the tubers of D. bulbifera and D. dodecaneura, and in the leaves of D. bulbifera. However, CAH absence was confirmed in the leaves of D. alata, D. villosa, D. dodecaneura, and D. nipponica, and in the shoot tips of all five species. The phylogenetic tree which was developed shows that D. bulbifera leaf and tuber sequences contain the same version of the CAH gene, and a highly similar version to D. dodecaneura. Surprisingly, it also indicates that instead of each version of the CAH gene being more similar to corresponding versions in different taxa (orthologous relationships) as was expected, it is most similar to copies within its own taxa (paralogous relationships). These results indicate that the CAH gene replicated after speciation occurred in the three taxa (Dioscorea, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Oryza sativa) not before as was expected.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF ALLELOCHEMICALS PRODUCED BY LEPIDIUM LATIFOLIUM ON SELECTED CROPS GROWN IN NORTH TOOLE COUNTY, MONTANA
Chris Lee McFadden, Ben Harmon Dubbe
North Toole County High School, Sunburst Montana, USA

The purpose of Study 1 was to determine if there are allelochemicals produced by Lepidium latifolium (perennial pepperweed) that effect the germination and early growth of selected crops grown in North Toole County, Montana. The purpose of Study 2 was to determine if there are any water soluble chemicals produced by perennial pepperweed that affect the germination of the selected crops. The selected crops include: Triticum aestivum (Wheat), Hordeum vulgare (Barley), Cicer arietinum (Chick Peas), and Brassica napus (Canola). In Study 1 perennial pepperweed was grown for 30 days. At the end of this period, the weeds were mixed into the soil and the selected crops were planted. Height was recorded daily, and after 15 days, vegetative dry weight, final height, and number germinated were calculated. In Study 2 a leachate was produced with the soil that perennial pepperweed had been growing in for 30 days. We then placed seeds from each of the selected crops into petri dishes with a double layer of filter paper. Each dish was then watered with 10 mL of the leachate. After 10 days the number germinated was recorded. Results from Study 1 showed that perennial pepperweed had a significantly negative effect on the overall growth, daily height and final vegetative mass of wheat and barley. A significantly negative effect was also found on the final vegetative mass, and overall growth of canola. In Study 2 we found that the leachate significantly reduced the number of seeds germinated for all of the selected crops. <br><br>

PUERARIA LOBATA (KUDZU): A PESTICIDE?
Tyler R Rowland
Maclay School, Tallahassee, Florida, United States

Pea aphids are small, green insects that cause numerous problems to crops. Aphids have been known to suck juices out of plants, causing them to wilt or grow slowly. Kudzu is an extremely hardy plant that has caused a great deal of damage to many plants and man-made structures. Its large leaves prevent smaller plants from obtaining sunlight, and its large roots have the capacity to uproot large trees. The purpose of this project is to determine if the extraction from kudzu roots and leaves can be used as an effective pesticide on aphids.<br><br> Two C3 plants, green beans, were placed on separate sides of a tank. The plant designated as the control was untreated and placed at the right of the tank; the plant designated as the test was lightly sprayed with kudzu extract and placed on the left on the test tank. Aphid behavior was observed for two hours and thirty minutes. The trial would be repeated multiple times using kudzu leaf and plant extract. Plants treated with the leaf extract were host to about ten percent fewer aphids than those not treated; plants treated with the root extract also attracted about ten percent fewer bugs than those not treated. No behavior changes were observes.<br><br> The kudzu extract appears to have caused fewer aphids to harm the plants. Further experimentation is needed to confirm its possible use as a pesticide. Repetitive data in future experiments could lead to an agricultural use of the kudzu as an effective pesticide.

ACER PALMATUM IN VITRO YEAR 2
Michael James Bernert
West Linn High School, West Linn OR, United States

This is the second year of a 4-year attempt to propagate Acer palmatum (Japanese maple) in vitro. Acer palmatum is a recalcitrant woody species that is difficult to culture in vitro. J.L. Fernández-Lorenzo et al. is the only research team to publish on the successful propagation of an A. palmatum cultivar. My project built on previous work to state more comprehensive procedures.<br><br>Six experiments, numbered six through eleven, attempted to find the conditions that promoted shoot development in A. palmatum cultures.<br><br>Some highlights include:<br><br>-In experiment 6, A. palmatum "Red dragon" cultures grown on woody plant medium supplemented with .045 uM thidiazuron (WPM+.045 uM TDZ) experienced 67% reactivity.<br><br>-In experiment 8, A. palmatum "Sango-kaku" cultures achieved 86% reactivity.<br><br>-In experiment 9, shoot development was recorded in 40% of meristematic A. palmatum "Sango-kaku" cultures.<br><br>-In experiment 11, 72.7% of the reactive "Sango-kaku" cultures grown on WPM+.045 uM TDZ showed shoot development after just 13 days.<br><br> <br><br>This experimentation helped isolate explants, cultivars, and growth regulators that make the culture of A. palmatum in vitro possible. Numerous challenges still need to be addressed. These challenges include the perfection of media, broadening effectiveness to multiple cultivars, and developing hardening off procedures. Overcoming these challenges and finalizing a protocol will provide a new tool to growers, breeders and scientists interested in Acer palmatum.<br><br>

Zane Trace High School Chillicothe, OH U.S.A.

A genetically modified soybean, Nutrium(R), has been developed to have 5% less linolenic acid than other soybeans. The purpose of this project is to determine if the loss of linolenic acid is compensated by an increase in another unsaturated fatty acid, and if the genetic modification will persist in the next generation. The hypotheses are that the Nutrium(R) will have 5% less linolenic acid than Roundup Ready(R), that the loss of linolenic acid is compensated by an increase in linoleic acid, and that the genetic modification will persist to the next generation. Ten samples of each of the following were analyzed: First-generation and second-generation Nutrium(R) and Roundup Ready(R). Crushed soybeans were extracted with hexane. Sodium methoxide was used to form the methyl esters of the fatty acids. The methyl esters were analyzed using a gas chromatograph. The average percentage and standard deviation for each principal fatty acid was calculated. The percent of linolenic acid of first-generation Nutrium(R) is 2.4% which is 4.3% less than Roundup Ready(R), within 1.5 standard deviations of the 5% in the hypothesis. The percentages of linoleic and oleic acids show no significant change. The compensation hypothesis was incorrect. Only two saturated fatty acids (palmitic and stearic) show a slight increase of 1%. The first-generation and second-generation Nutrium(R) has the same linolenic concentration but the linoleic acid concentration is significantly greater and the oleic concentration is smaller than those in the first-generation Nutrium(R). The genetic modification may not pass completely to the next generation.

SEEING RED TOMATO PRODUCTION RESPONSE TO REFLECTIVE RED WAVELENGTHS
John Jacob Register
Austin High School, Austin, Minnesota

Early organic tomatoes capture a higher price on the fresh market in Minnesota. Red colored mulches have been reported to give increased numbers, size and earliness of fruit. <br><br>The use of red and black mulches were tested along with a control (no mulch), in three organic plots each containing ten Whooper® tomato plants. Growing conditions were kept constant, for the three plots, that were separated by ten foot blue grass buffers to reduce disease transference. Weights of each tomato were made on a digital scale and then categorized by weight. Quantity and weight results were recorded by date and plant number. <br><br>The number of tomatoes harvested in the first two weeks was considered “early harvest” data. The control plot produced 5.1 tomatoes per plant; the red plot had 2.9 and the black plot 2.3, in the early harvests.<br><br>The control plot produced ten more tomatoes per plant than the red and 16 more than the black plot by the end of the season. The control also produced 11,146 grams more total volume of fruit than the red and 17,873 grams more than the black plot. There was no benefit to using a red colored mulch. <br><br>Blight was a severe problem on all plots this season. Organic controls of blight will be part of future studies as well as comparing different varieties of tomatoes to see if any may have a genetic disposition for better usage of reflective red wavelengths. Indeterminate and determinate varieties will be compared.<br><br>

EVALUATION OF PESTICIDAL PROPERTIES OF A NOVEL COMPOUND
Taylor Beth Hoskins
Lincoln Park Academy High School, Fort Pierce, Florida, U.S.A

The purpose of this experiment was to investigate whether the novel compound Knock-Out Big 6 Plus had the potential to inhibit the growth of plant pathogenic fungi and plant parasitic nematodes. The researcher chose this experiment because plant pathogens and parasitic nematodes reduce crop yields, and an environmentally safe product is preferable over chemical nematicides and fungicides.<br><br> The researcher planted 36 bell pepper plants in soil inoculated with Phytophthora capsici and 36 bell peppers plants in clean soil. The plants were then pre-drenched with 0%, 15%, and 25% Knock-Out Big 6 Plus. The researcher also planted 36 tomato seedlings in soil inoculated with root knot nematodes and 36 tomato seedlings in clean soil. The tomato plants were pre-drenched with 0%,15%, and 25% Knock-Out Big 6 Plus.<br><br> Following the experiment, the researcher measured the stems of the pepper plants inoculated with Phytophthora capsici and recorded the gall ratings for the roots of the tomato plants inoculated with root knot nematodes. Treatment 6, with an average disease rating of 0.0, was the most effective in controlling the Phytophthora capsici as well as the most effective in controlling the root knot nematodes with an average gall rating of 0.8. This was less than the average gall ratings of treatments 1 through 5. Treatment 6 was inoculated, non pre-drenched, and treated with 25% Knock-Out Big 6 Plus.<br><br> Data from test results do not support the hypothesis. The original hypothesis was that the most effective treatment for the bell pepper plants planted in Phytophthora capsici infested soil would be no pre-drench and 15% Knock-Out Big 6 Plus. The most effective treatment for the tomato seedlings planted in soil inoculated with root knot nematodes would be non pre-drenched and 15% Knock-Out Big 6 Plus. To improve this experiment, the researcher would use different percentages of Knock-Out Big 6 Plus.

HOW DOES MUSIC AFFECT PLANT GROWTH?
Steven Rene Bordelon
Science & Math Acadamy, P.O. Box 482, Vacherie, LA 70090 

For my project, I wanted to observe if music actually affected the growth of plants. I wanted to investigate whether my hypothesis is correct that sound waves will most likely affect the size and growth of plants.<br><br>First, I purchased plants of the same type. Then, I placed all the plants in the same window facing the same sunlight exposure daily. They were all watered at the same time every other day. Two of the plants wer exposed to no music (group 3). Two more of the plants were exposed to heavy rock music (group 20, while two others were exposed to only piano music (group 1). The plants were kept in front of speakers, and the music was kept on continuously at a low, but audible volume.<br><br>According to my results, the plants that were shown to have the most growth were the plants that were exposed to the louder heavy rock music. Although all of the plants did show some signs of growth, the plants from group 1 showed the highest rate of growth in height.<br><br>

VERIFYING GREENHOUSE TECHNIQUES USED TO TEST POTATOES FOR SUSCEPTIBILITY TO POWDERY SCAB
Michaela K. Kaiser
Sargent, Monte Vista CO, United States

The disease, powdery scab, caused by Spongospora subterranea is difficult to recognize in potato foliage and no adequate control measures for root and tuber infection exist. This situation is aggravated by the widespread cultivation of susceptible varieties. New control measures are urgently needed. Screening potato cultivars for resistance to powdery scab on a small scale in the greenhouse as a preliminary, or in place of field evaluation, would be a useful first step.<br><br>Greenhouse techniques were utilized to produce infection and symptom development of powdery scab on three different potato varieties with high (NDC5281-2R), medium (Yukon Gold), and low (Rio Grande Russet) susceptibilities to powdery scab. Potatoes were grown in three different soil treatments; non-infested soil, naturally infested soil, and artificially infested soil. Watering was consistent and temperature was similar to field conditions.<br><br>Results compared previous field and greenhouse trials and checked for correlation. Differences between use of naturally infested soil versus artificially infested soil were analyzed.<br><br>Results indicate that greenhouse testing for powdery scab susceptibility is possible. Greenhouse results were similar to field results in regards to relatively ranking of the varieties tested for powdery scab symptom development. The limitations of a summer growing season are not a factor in the greenhouse and a potato disease is not introduced into fertile un-field soil. Factors such as temperature and water need more consideration for optimum greenhouse results. These techniques can be immediately applied to the cultivar development program in the early screening of new germplasm for powdery scab resistance. <br><br>

INVESTIGATING BIO-CONSERVATIONAL TECHNIQUES AS SOLUTIONS FOR DECREASING ECONOMIC PRODUCTIVITY. PHASE II: THE EFFECTS OF TILLAGE REDUCTION ON SUGARCANE YIELDS.
Tate Benton-Michael Guillotte
Catholic High School, New Iberia, Louisiana, USA

The purpose of this project is to determine if tillage reduction will increase sugarcane yields in different phases of growth. Previous research has found that reducing tillage can help control some diseases in cotton, soybeans, and peanuts. The issue of tillage reduction with respect to yield has not been addressed in sugarcane. It was hypothesized that the No-Till treatments would not affect yields in soil sample study, yield estimate study, or a harvest study. To test the hypothesis, the experimenter selected a 12 acre patch and divided it into six treatments. Each treatment was replicated six times within the test patch. The experimenter conducted three studies. In the first study, the experimenter took soil samples from each treatment and compared the nutrient levels. In the second study, the experimenter conducted a pre-harvest yield estimate to determine the average stalk population, average stalk weight, and the average sugar content of each treatment. In the third study, the experimenter harvested each treatment and extracted the sugar. In the first study, the No-Till stubble treatment had higher nutrient levels and the No-Till plant treatment had lower levels. In the second study, the No-Till treatments did not have the highest stalk weight and sugar content, but the No-Till plant treatment had the largest stalk population. In the third study, the No-Till treatments did not test highest in all mill fields, but the No-Till plant treatment did produce the most pounds of sugar. The experimenter also conducted a cost analysis and discovered an average increase of $158.57 per acre in net income by using No-Till in plant cane. No-Till in stubble cane resulted in an average decrease of $339.55 per acre net income. The experimenter concluded that the experiment rejected the hypothesis, proving that tillage reduction does affect sugarcane yields in plant cane and in second year stubble. A statistical analysis was conducted and the stalk weight was significantly different within the different treatments.

BIOSUPPRESSION OF PHYTOPATHOGENS AND ANALYZATION OF THE RHIZOSPHERE INTERACTIONS
Chris Chaeha Lim
John B. Connally High School, Austin Texas, US

Phytopathogens around the world cause billions of dollars in damages, affecting important crop and fruit plants. Fusarium spp. is among one of the most damaging fungal plant pathogen. However, there are no completely effective methods to control such diseases.<br><br>Microorganisms that show antagonism againt such disease may have the capabilities to suppress them in situ and thereby provide a way for control. Such methods are appealing becasue of their friendliness to the environment. To properly utilize and understand this method of suppression, a careful look at the rhizosphere is necessary, where complex biological and chemical interactions are carried out.<br><br>In this experiment microorganisms were isolated, identified, and tested for antagonism against Fusarium in vitro. Then they were cultured and coated onto seeds planted into disease-infected soil-beds. The suppression-capable microorganisms reduced symptoms and protected seeds from the pathogen. Population interactions and chemical pathways relating to the suppression were tested and observed as well, revealing changes in dynamics with presence of chemicals produced by the pathogen.

THE EFFECTS OF ALIZARIN YELLOW ON RAPID PERICYCLE AND MERISTEM GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF MACBRIDEA ALBA: AN INVESTIGATION FOR A NOVEL METHOD OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
Zachary Mason Sandoval
Dr. Michael M. Krop High School

A recent problem for farmers worldwide is growing plants with less medium and in turn having a faster quota gain. Significantly, many nations such as Togo, Australia, and parts of the United States have seen substantial decreases in production totals. The purpose of this study is to observe the effects of Alizarin Yellow on Macbridea alba (White birds-in-a-nest), which has a similar Pericycle and Meristem structure to sweet corn (Zea mays) and wheat (Triticum spp.). <br><br> In part one, four treatments of different Alizarin amounts (20, 40, 60, and 80 ppm) and a control were administered to the Macbridea alba sprouts for 24 hours. Then changes in the plant were recorded once every week for 19 weeks. Using the CBL Probes, changes in chemical ion levels were collected in the medium space (Nitrogen and Oxygen). In addition, the raw weight (in grams) was collected for each sprout. The mean length changes (cm) for stems and root system were a focus in the study. This same procedure was repeated in two replication groups.<br><br> The data showed a significant positive correlation (+0.43) between accelerated plant growth and Alizarin Yellow treatments for 60 ppms. Moreover, plants were most successfully grown in the 60 ppm making it the most effective treatment of all tested. This project creates a way to accelerate agricultural production using a safe and effective chemical. Such application can be used to feed astronauts in space, military troops oversea, or used in developing nations where space is scarce and growth factors available are limited.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF VARIOUS PLANT GROWTH MEDIA ON SYNTHETIC SEED GROWTH THROUGH CLONING AND SHOOT ENCAPSULATION OF SAINTPAULIA IONANTHA
Neela Devi Thangada
Keystone School, San Antonio, Texas, USA

Faster propagation may be the solution to issues like world hunger and restoration of species. Researchers are looking at cloning facilitated with synthetic seed technology to produce higher yields. <br><br> The aim of this study was to determine which plant growth medium was most efficient for fastest propagation and highest survival of cloned synthetic seeds of Saintpaulia ionantha (African violet). The hypotheses were that fastest germination would take place in perlite medium and the highest survival rate in vermiculite medium. <br><br> The procedure consisted of two phases, both performed under a laminar flow hood to prevent contamination. Phase one consisted of the excision of seventy African violet explants at the meristem and leaf petiole. The explants were placed in Murashige and Skoog Agar Medium. Cultures were observed for six weeks until shoot primordia growth developed, signaling phase two of experimentation. During phase two, sixty shoot primordia with meristem were excised and then encapsulated with 2% sodium alginate and calcium chloride solution. Subsequently, synthetic seeds were placed in three different media: perlite, vermiculite, and potting soil. Observations were based upon fastest propagation and highest survival of synthetic seeds. <br><br> Statistically, no differences among these growth media appeared for fastest germination. In conclusion, the hypothesis that perlite produces the fastest germination was proved incorrect. However, statistical evidence showed vermiculite medium was beneficial for highest survival rate.<br><br> Producing higher yields in a shorter period with synthetic seed technology is ideal for addressing major issues like world hunger and conservation of endangered species like the African violet. <br><br>

CREATING POST-TRANSLATIONAL SWITCHES FROM VARIOUS STEROID RECEPTORS
Jia_Ren Liew
Raffles Junior College, Singapore

The floral ABC model describes how floral-organ is determined spatially. The combinatorial action of the three classes of ABC homeotic genes determines the organs that will develop at each particular region of the flower. Most of the ABC genes encode for MADS box type transcription factors. However, much remains to be revealed about the regulatory transcriptional cascades downstream of the ABC genes leading to floral organ control. To investigate downstream targets of ABC genes, we aim to create a system of independent switches utilizing various mammalian steroid hormone receptors. We produced plasmid constructs containing cDNA clones encoding for various Ligand Binding Domain (LBD)-coding regions of the steroid receptors and a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) reporter gene. These plasmids were then bombarded into leek epidermal cells to determine the effectiveness of the nuclear localization and thus their suitability as switches. From our results, Androgen and Estradiol Delta N Delta C Receptors demonstrate high potential as switches as they show distinct nuclear localisation upon hormone treatment and exhibit specificity in hormone binding in leek epidermal cells. Thus a potential double switch system can be implemented along with transciption factors of MADS box genes to control expression of downstream cascades. This system will be widely applicable to other transciption studies in plants.

This is being done by genetically engineering the over expression of the gene AVP1, which plays a pivotal role in auxin transport. Specifically, it is hypothesized that plants exposed to abiotic stresses will show enhanced AVP1 expression compared to plants in ideal or normal conditions. In order to monitor the localization of AVP1 in plant tissue, the promoter for AVP1, pAVP1, was inserted in front of the sequence for BETA-Glucuronidase (uidA), GUS reporter gene. A 1.5 kb fragment of AVP1 promoter was amplified using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and cloned into vector pGEM-T. After it was digested with XbaI/BamHI, the AVP1 promoter fragment was transferred to the plant vector pBC308, in front of the GUS reporter gene. The final construct has been transformed into plants using agrobacterium mediated floral dip method. The plants have been screened in order to select healthy transgenic plants for testing.

MYCOREMEDIATION OF HEATING OIL CONTAMINATED SOIL BY PEARL OYSTER MUSHROOMS (PLEUROTUS OSTREATUS) TO ALLOW PLANT GROWTH
Cailey Ann Neary
Juneau Douglas High School, Juneau, AK, USA

The purpose of my experiment was to discover if the presence and length of growing time of Pearl Oyster Mushroom culture in heating oil contaminated soil affects bean plant height and mass. My hypothesis was that the longer the Pearl Oyster Mushroom culture is grown in oil-contaminated soil before the bean plants are planted, the taller the beans will be and the greater their mass will be. I planted 15 bean plants in three tanks containing oil contaminated soil, one with mushroom culture that was allowed to ferment for three weeks beforehand, one with mushroom culture that had fermented for two weeks and one without mushroom culture. I then measured the bean plants every other day throughout the experiment and recorded the mass of the bean plants at the end of the experiment. <br><br> My conclusion supported my hypothesis that bean plants grown with mushrooms that had fermented longer grew taller and had more mass than those with shorter mushroom fermentation. While the bean plants grown without mushroom culture did not sprout at all the average height and mass of the sprouted bean plants in the three week tank was 11.32 and 2.36 g. The average height and mass of the bean plants in the two week tank was 3.42 cm and 2 g. This data could be useful in discovering less expensive ways to deal with soil polluted by leaking oil tanks or pipes. <br><br>

THE POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION OF MUTANT AND WILD TYPE CYTOSKELETAL COMPONENTS IN CERATOPTERIS RICHARDII THROUGH FLUORESCENT AND HISTOLOGICAL STAINING
Anna Pilishvili
Forest Hills High School, Forest Hills NY, United States

Polka dot mutation in Ceratopteris richardii causes an expression of a brilliant phenotype. It is believed that the cytoskeleton of the fern is affected by the mutation; however, tangible knowledge of the mechanism of the mutation is nonexistent. This research involves the meticulous analysis of the Ceratopteris richardii cytoskeletal filaments and their interactions with one another. Rhodamine phalloidin staining technique was utilized to accent the actin filament bundles within the polka dot and wild type c-fern cells. Fluorescence microscopy enabled the collection of data that helped deduce the extent of polka dot mutation’s involvement with the actin filaments. For microtubule clarification, Safranin O and counterstain Fast Green staining methods were implemented. Lastly, DAPI staining process was applied to enunciate the intermediate filament proteins in wild type and polka dot Ceratopteris richardii. It was hypothesized that microtubule and actin filament fractions of the cytoskeleton would be affected by the polka dot mutation in the greatest degree with some involvement of intermediate filaments. The results indicated marked differences in actin filament distribution and further portrayed absence of intermediate filaments in the wild type C-fern. <br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF BUCKMINSTERFULLERENES ON HYDROPONICALLY GROWN BRASSICA RAPA IN VARIED ENVIRONMENTS (YEAR TWO)
Lindsay Mallissia Liles
C.H. Yoe High School, Cameron Texas, U.S.A.

Buckminsterfullerenes, C60, were first discovered in 1985 at Rice University. C60 research increases as C60 becomes more applicable to varying fields of science. C60 plant research, however, is in its infancy. This study investigates the effect of C60 on hydroponically grown Brassica rapa plants.<br><br> To test CO2 production rates of the plants exposed to C60, a growing chamber and data collecting system was set-up. Trials using 30 seeds were exposed for 24 hours in both Light and Dark environments to varying concentrations of C60 as well as a Control (distilled water). <br><br> Using a T-Test, the Dark C60 concentrations of 5ppm, 1ppm, and .1ppm affected the CO2 production rate with a 96.04% significant difference between 0-6 hours, 99.97% difference between 6-12 hours; 98.24% difference between 6-12 hours; 97.29% difference between 0-6 hours, and 95.60% difference between 6-12 hours, respectively. <br><br> In the Light C60 concentrations of 5ppm, 1ppm, and .1ppm, the CO2 production rates were 98.24% different between 0-6 hours, 99.87% different between 6-12 hours, 99.95% different between 12-18 hours; 97.44% different between 6-12 hours; 96.35% different between 6-12 hours, 96.95% different between 12-18 hours, and 99.10% different between 18-24 hours, respectively. <br><br> To investigate the effects of C60 on plant roots, photographs were taken after 48 hours of exposure with a stereoscope. 5 sites were chosen around the meristem and measured for thickness in mm of the root border cells. Root border cells in the 5ppm Light concentration and 1ppm Dark concentration were significantly wider. Root lengths measured in mm after exposure were not significantly different.<br><br>

INVESTIGATION OF POSSIBLE NUTRITIVE SOIL VALUE OF TAMARIX RAMOSSISIMA
Katheryn Ann Smith
Malta High School, Malta, MT USA

Tamarix ramossisima(saltcedar), is a large invasive shrub that infests drainage systems in the U.S., replacing native plants and grasses. Saltcedar increases soil salinity and releases salt accumulated in its tissues, forming a crust above and below ground, hindering native species. <br><br>The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the possible nutritive value of Tamarix ramossisima for soil and native plants, and to investigate soil nutrients that are present in soil where saltcedar grew and in interstitial soil nearby.<br><br>Soil samples were taken from the Fort Peck areas where saltcedar grew and nearby areas with no saltcedar growth. I used the soil samples to grow nine native plants, each planted in twenty-one conetainers of each soil type. The plants were kept in a growth chamber and watered weekly with (distilled) water. Before thinning, plants were counted to record the number germinated. Plants were measured in centimeters to record growth. Wet and dry weights were recorded of each plant type for each soil. Plants grown in the soil where saltcedar was present demonstrated higher overall weights. Average heights recorded show plants grew taller in the saltcedar soil. Soil analysis results showed the salt content of the interstitial soil was .29 mmho/cm, whereas salt content of saltcedar soil was .47 mmho/cm.<br><br>More research would be needed to determine the cause of increased height in the saltcedar soil. It is possible that saltcedar may leave nutrients in soil beneficial to native plants, although the presence of the plant hinders the growth of native plants.<br><br>

TISSUE CULTURE ROOT DEVELOPMENT WITH GROWTH HORMONES "ROOT ON WITH GROWTH HORMONES"
Chelsea E. Obrebski
Hamilton Freshman School, Hamilton, Ohio USA

This study was undertaken to determine which concentration of growth hormone in a leaf disc and explant tissue culture would produce the best adventitious root growth. If a mid level concentration of auxin, .005 mg/ml, produces the best adventitious root growth development, then the plant’s natural auxin in addition to the highest level of growth hormone, .01 mg/ml, may reach levels toxic to the plant. Two herbaceous plants were selected to propagate, the first using leaf discs of the Peperomia obtusifolia, and the second, explants of Sinningia speciosa. Leaf discs and explants were cultured on half strength Murashige & Skoog medium with five different levels of auxin; .001 mg/ml, .0025 mg/ml, .005 mg/ml, .0075 mg/ml and .01 mg/ml. Indole-3-acetic acid was selected for the leaf discs and indole-3-butyric acid for the explants. Five trials were conducted for each concentration in both cultures. A control was five tissue cultures each of the leaf disc and explants on growth medium with no auxin. Cultures were incubated for 4 weeks for the leaf disc and 3 weeks for the explants at 25 degrees Celsius with 16 hours of light (100 watt bulb) and 8 hours of dark. The greatest adventitious root growth occurred in the .001 mg/ml concentration for the leaf disc and the .01 mg/ml concentration for the explant. The hypothesis was proven incorrect, as the mid level concentration of the auxin, .005 mg/ml, did not encourage the best adventitious root growth, nor did the highest level concentration of an auxin, .01 mg/ml, reach toxicity.<br><br><br>

STUDY OF THE EXTRACT OF THE LEAVES OF THE RUE CHALEPENSIS AS A NATURAL INSECTICIDE AGAINST THE COCKROACHES BLATELLA GERMANICA.
Francisco Jose Gotay
Colegio Maria Auxiliadora, Carolina , Puerto Rico

This research main purpose was to find an insecticide against cockroaches using the rue plant. First, the rue plant was taken to the laboratory to work with it in the preparation of two extract, one of ground leaf and one whole leaf. To prepare the whole leaves extract 10g were weighed using a digital scale. Leaves were mixed with 500ml of distilled water and boiled for 10 minutes. The mixture was filtered and, after cooling, it was placed in a plastic container. For the ground extract, leaves were crushed using a blender and mixes with 500ml of distilled water previously warmed for 10 minutes. The mixture was filtered and, after cooling, it was placed in a plastic container. After obtaining the extracts of the rue whole leaves and ground leaves, the work with cockroaches was continued. 36 cockroaches were trapped and placed in three fish tank that were prepared using soil and hamster bedding straw. Tank A was spayed daily with solution of ground leaves. Tank B was sprayed daily with solution of whole leaves. Tank C was sprayed with water (control). After a week of daily observations the ground leaves extract was more effective, because it killed the cockroaches after 2 days. The whole leaves extract was effective, but only after 7 days.

COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE USE OF EXTRACTS OF PADINA ALGAE SP, HALIMEDA SP, AND GRACILLARIA SP AS NATURAL HERBICIDE FOR THE CYPERUS ROTUNDUS.
Kevin E. Molina
Colegio Maria Auxiliadora, Ave. Sanchez Castano blq. 122. Carolina Puerto Rico 

The purpose of this research is to ascertain the possible use of certain algae as a natural source of herbicides. According to literature some species of algae may be used based on their alkaline pH properties. Three species of algae stands out as possible alternatives: Halimeda sp, Padine sp, Gracillaria sp. To prepare an extract of each algae a digital scale was used to weigh 100g each of whole algae tissue. This tissue was processed in a blender with 200 mL of distilled water and the solution was filtrated using commercially available filters paper. The solutions were stored in plastic containers properly identified after the pH for each solution was measured. A fourth solution was made by combining equal weights (33.3 gm) of each specie in 200 mL of water. To test the solutions an area in which Cyperus rotundus ,a common weed that usually grows in acidic soils, was selected and divided in 10 sections. The sections were sprayed daily during a period of 20 days with the solutions. After 20 days of observations the best solution in eradicating the weed turned out to be the combined extract. Our results suggests that neutralizing the acidic conditions in which C. rotundus grows with algae extracts is an effective way to control weed growth and avoid environmental damage from commercially available herbicides. Future studies will attempt to explore additional factors that might be present in the mixture that are not explained on the basis of pH alone.<br><br>

M. SATIVA, A SUSTAINABLE AND NATURAL TECHNIQUE FOR THE REMEDIATION OF HEAVY METAL CONTAMINATION
Keely Ann Goodgame
San Jon School, San Jon, NM, United States

Phytoremediation is a group of technologies that use living plants to reduce, remove, degrade, or immobilize contaminants. Compared to alternate remediation strategies, phytoremediation is relatively inexpensive and well accepted by the public. Phytoremediation may be the only econcomically feasible and sustainable choice for many areas throughout the world that cannot afford conventional remediation techniques. <br><br> In addition to the removal of hazardous metals and compounds, phytoremediation could be utilized to “mine” precious metals. It has been well-known for some time that plants can uptake gold from soils. Some living systems not only uptake metals but they also reform new compounds, often as nanoparticles. Gold nanoparticle formation in living alfalfa plants has been documented (Gardea-Torresdey, 2002). <br><br>This experiment will elucidate the utilization of living Medicago sativa, (alfalfa), as a sustainable, economical, aesthetically pleasing, in-situ technique for the remediation of heavy metal contaminated water and soil. Alfalfa plants were grown in media containing 75, 150 and 300ppm; Sr, Cu, Cd, Pb, Ag, Cr, and Pt for four days. The plants were harvested and the metal uptake analyzed using an ICP-MS. Plant stems were analyzed utilizing a SEM for Pt content, with WDS/X-ray mapping. The alfalfa significantly (p<0.001) hyper-accumulated Sr and Pt, with the plants containing as much as 25 times the amount found in the soil and the controls. The WDS/X-ray mapping documented Pt uptake and possible nanoparticles formation in the stems. This indicates that the use of living alfalfa plants to remediate heavy metal contamination is a promising and viable technique.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF AN APPLIED MUCOID LAYER ON WINTER WHEAT GERMINATION AND EMERGENCE UNDER DROUGHT- LIKE CONDITIONS AND COLD TEMPERATURE EXTREMES
Kari Lynn Gillespie
North Toole County High School, Sunburst, Montana, United States of America

The purpose was to determine if a mucoid layer from camelina applied to winter wheat seeds will increase emergence rates under drought-like conditions and cold conditions and germination rates under varied water levels. <br><br> It was hypothesized that treated seeds would have increased germination levels under varied water conditions and increased emergence rates under drought-like and cold conditions. <br><br> A protocol for removing camelina’s mucoid layer and applying it to winter wheat seeds was first developed. Groups of 100 treated and untreated seeds were placed in Petri dishes with paper toweling and varied amounts of water (0 milliliters, 5 milliliters, 10 milliliters, and 15 milliliters). Germination rates were counted after 24 and 48 hours. For the water variance emergence study, 40 seeds were planted for each water level; 0 milliliters, 10 milliliters, 20 milliliters, and 40 milliliters and given that water amount after three days. This was repeated giving the pots 20 milliliters of water initially. For the cold study, pots were either given initial water (20 milliliters) or none, and then placed in the freezer for 24 or 48 hours. Upon removal, pots without initial water were given 20 milliliters 1 hour after removal.<br><br> There was a significant decrease in emergence levels in the 40 milliliter group that received initial water. In the seeds that were given 10 milliliters of water, there was a significant increase in germination rates. There was a significant increase in emergence rates of treated seeds when given initial water and exposed to 24 hour freezing conditions.

ALLELOPATHIC TENDENCIES OF DIFFERENT PLANT PIGMENTS
Hillary M Lansdowne
Bonneville High School, Ogden, UT, US

The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether or not different pigments of leaves possess allelopathic compounds, which affect the growth of various plant species. It was predicted that red leaves, which contain anthocyanins and catechins would have the most toxic effect on the growth of seedlings. The extracts were taken from the leaves to isolate the allelopathic compounds. Over a period of six days the seedlings were exposed to the leaf extracts and their growth was monitored. It appeared that the leaves containing anthocyanins(red pigment) effected the growth of the seedlings most. The roots from seedlings exposed to the red pigments were small compaired to the control seedlings. The red extracts seemed to have a negative effect on the seedlings growth. These findings could be used in developing natural herbicides, which could help control invasive species.

EFFECT OF ULTRAMICRO-ACTIVE CALCIUM FERTILIZER ON TOMATO GROWTH AND PHYSIO-BIOCHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS
Yuechen Zhong
Beijing No.101 Middle School,Beijing,China

Calcium is an essential element for growth of crops.However, the traditional calcium fertilizers, mainly consist of calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate and calcium phosphate, normally are insoluble in water, so it they can not be absorbed by crops. The ultramicro-granule active calcium fertilizer is more active and soluble, and easier to be absorbed by plants because of its high content of calcium and ultramicro size. <br><br> In the present experimental work, the effect of the ultramicro-granule active calcium fertilizer was tested on the tomato, including yields and physio-biochemical characteristics. By comparison with the blank control, it turned out that with the ultrafine active calcium fertilizer, tomato yield increased as much as 49.61%, and the contents of vitamin C and carotene in fruits had increased 48.84% and 285.81%, respectively. The physiological and biochemical assays of the tomatoes supplied with the calcium fertilizer showed that the contents of chlorophyll in leaves and calcium in roots, stems and leaves were substantially elevated, In addition, the specific activities of nitrate reductase and glutamine synthetase were enhanced, especially in the seedling and fruit phases. Therefore, the conclusion is that the ultramicro-active calcium fertilizer can enhance the activities of the key enzymes in N metabolic pathway and the photosynthesis of the plant, not only dues it stimulate the growth but also improves the quality of tomatoes. <br><br> From literature survey, no similar studies on ultramicro-granule active calcium fertilizer used in crop planting have been found so far.

ORGANIC MENDEL: A GENETIC COMPARISON OF ORGANIC AND INORGANIC PLANTS
Carla Jane Harper
Del Rio High School, Del Rio, TX, USA

Since everything starts at a molecular level if there are any genetic differences between inorganic and organic plants, then organic plants should be healthier. Yet if there are no differences between them genetically, then why spend more money on something if there is no difference between the two.<br><br> The problem is this, if there are genetic differences between inorganic and organic plants, then there is a possibility that one is healthier than the other. Yet if there is no genetic difference (and everything starts on a molecular level) then why spend more money on the term “organic” if they do the exact same thing for a person’s body as inorganic produce does.<br><br> My procedure is as follows:<br><br>1. Extract DNA from vegetables<br><br>2. Add a Restriction Enzyme (EcoRI)<br><br>3. Conduct Electrophoresis<br><br>4. Stain gels and let sit<br><br>5. Analyze gels and compare<br><br>6. Record Results<br><br> The results from my experiment showed that there are minimal and minute differences between inorganic and organic vegetables, by a mere difference of millimeters.<br><br> I believed there were no genetic differences between organic and inorganic vegetables. With the conducting and results from electrophoresis, my hypothesis was proven true. Even with minimal differences, that is not enough evidence to show actual genetic distinction. I believe with no genetic difference that is conclusive to say that inorganic and organic foods are nutritionally equal and taste the same.<br><br>

EFFECTS OF NITROGEN ON CORN, PHASE IV, NUTRIENT STUDY
Brandon David Wilson
West Central Valley High School, Stuart, IA, United States

There is no agreed-upon nitrogen application rate. Many who, in search of higher yields, apply excess nitrogen thereby reducing their yields. It is important to be as nitrogen efficient as possible. It is being questioned whether there is economic value to the application of higher nitrogen levels, even if there is a disadvantageous effect on the yield. The purpose of this project is to determine at which nitrogen level corn has the highest yield, and if there is a correlation between nitrogen level and nutrition value of the corn. It is hypothesized that all nutritional values and density will vary directly with the nitrogen level, and the yield will increase followed by a peak then a decrease. The plot was divided into 10 blocks 17.5 by 15 feet with six feet between each block. Nitrogen was applied at 25 pound increments to plots. The corn was planted at rates of 30,000 plants per acre. Three rows of each of the sample blocks were harvested. One gallon of each sample was collected. As the nitrogen level increased there was only an appreciable correlating trend between the nitrogen level and starch content. The yield increased to the 150 pound level where it peaked at 226.75 bushels per acre. Starch was the only nutrient level to show a correlating trend. All data is statistically sound. The hypothesis was supported in that the yield did increase, peak and, gradually decrease. Starch content was the only nutrient value to show correlation to nitrogen level.

FREE RADICAL INHIBITATION AND ALLEVIATION BY ANTIOXIDANTS TO PREVENT AGRICULTURAL DEVASTATION FROM UNFAVORABLE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS WITH THE LYCOPERSICON ESCULENTUM…
Justin Andrew Townley
Okaloosa-Walton College Collegiate High School, Niceville, Florida, USA

After experimenting with the relationship between plants and antioxidants and observing positive effects, this experiment was designed to see if the antioxidants enhanced plants were more resilient than the control that received no antioxidants. The testing procedure was designed to see if the antioxidants could suppress or alleviate the effects of increased free radicals that were brought on by the extreme environmental conditions of a hurricane and drought. The ABTS/H2O2/HRP method was used to test for antioxidant levels in the plants. The antioxidants used were a combination of three:<br><br> .01% solution of Alpha-Tocopherol<br><br> .01% solution of L-Ascorbic Acid<br><br> .01% solution of Glutathione<br><br>~Making one solution containing all three antioxidants together to form a .03% solution of antioxidants. During the hurricane, 80% of the plants were damaged. Of these plants, the set that received the combination antioxidant solution before the hurricane recovered at a rate of 73%. They had less breakage and regained new growth faster than the control. The drought experiment produced plants that survived without water for up to 3 weeks longer before succumbing to the lack of water. The surviving fruit from the Lycopersicon esculentum continued to remain fresh for nearly 3 months. The antioxidants extended the life of the picked fruit, thus opening up the possibility of an important economic impact on the shelf-life of produce. Also, the ability to apply this to fields of crops is not only easily applicable, but it is also economically feasible<br><br>

SEARCHING FOR NEW SOURCES OF ANTIBIOTICS
Lourdes Desiree Alicea
Colegio Nuestra Senora del Carmen, Hatillo, Puerto Rico

Indiscriminate use of antibiotics has developed pathogenic bacterial strains with resistance characteristics towards them. Due to this situation, it is necessary to search for new antibiotics. The antimicrobial activity of plants has been recognized and this research tries to investigate that if Pluchea carolinensis has chemical substances with antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae, then, bacterial growth will be inhibited. A sample of 125g of grinded Pluchea carolinensis in 90mL of sterile water are used to investigate its antimicrobial activity over the Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Two Thioglycolate liquid medium tubes, one with 2mL of Pluchea carolinensis solution and the other without it, were inoculated by the use of two transference loops of 10 µL, with one colony of Staphylococcus aureus from a blood agar culture. Other two Thioglycollate tubes were equally prepared, but with one colony of Klebsiella pneumoniae coming from a MacConkey agar culture. After 24 hours of incubation at 37°C, one colony from each tube was transfered to four Petri dishes of blood agar. Then, they were incubated for 24 hours at 37°C. It was observed that 60% of the growth of S. aureus was inhibited by Pluchea carolinensis, but Klebsiella pneumoniae did not show any inhibition. It appears that Pluchea carolinensis has chemical substances with antibacterial activity over S. aureus, but not over K. pneumoniae. A plant extract may have diverse antibacterial effects over bacteria depending on its concentration, extraction methods of the active substances and type of bacteria to be attacked.

KUDZU VS. NITROGEN: EFFECTS OF INOCULANTS ON THE NITROGEN USE RATE OF PUERARIA LOBATA AS COMPARED TO KNOWN LEGUMINOUS PLANTS
Lindsay Marie Stewart
Grove High School, Grove, OK USA

Pueraria lobata (kudzu) is a rapidly growing perennial leguminous vine that has researchers over the past fifty years shifting from propagation to eradication. Perhaps our economy could reap greater benefits from utilization rather than eradication.<br><br> One characteristic of legumes is that they have a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. These bacteria are called Rhizobia, which have the ability to transform atmospheric nitrogen into nitrogen in the soil for the plant to use.<br><br> Inoculating insures that there are enough of the proper Rhizobium bacteria to help form root nodules that convert nitrogen from the air in the soil.<br><br> The purpose of this research is to determine if Pueraria lobata (kudzu) is an efficient nitrogen-fixing plant, with and without inoculants compared to other nitrogen fixing legumes.<br><br> It was hypothesized that kudzu will be an effective nitrogen-fixing plant with and without inoculants, and kudzu will produce more nitrogen with inoculants and also that all plant types will be more efficient nitrogen consumers with the inoculants.<br><br> To determine this three different inoculants were applied to the seeds of alfalfa, field peas, kudzu and soybeans prior to planting. One group used was a control without inoculant. After two months of growing, the soil and plant tissue was tested for nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. <br><br> The hypothesis that kudzu would be an effective nitrogen fixation plant is not supported. Nitrogen fixation was not observed in kudzu.<br><br> The hypothesis that kudzu would produce more nitrogen with inoculants was supported. The kudzu tissue nitrogen levels were higher in all inoculants groups as compared to kudzu in the control group.<br><br> The soybeans were the most efficient nitrogen-fixating plant tested during the time frame of the experiment. Alfalfa was the second most efficient with fie

STUDY OF FIBONACCI PATTERNS IN COMMON FLOWERS OF PUERTO RICO
Angel Adrian Aponte
Francisco Morales High School, Naranjito, Puerto Rico

<br><br> The purpose of this investigation is to determine if there is a high index of patterns of Fibonacci in the common flowers of Puerto Rico. The patterns of Fibonacci in the petals of the flowers are known as “Numbers of Fibonacci or Golden Section” in honor to the Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci.<br><br> <br><br> This series of numbers is present in different natural events. There are several problems postulated in this investigation: Does a high index of patterns of Fibonacci exist in the flowers of Puerto Rico? If it is true, which is the most common number? Will the color, the flower type or the size be related with this phenomenon? <br><br>These patterns of Fibonacci help scientists in the Botanic discipline, to classify plants according to common characteristics.<br><br> <br><br> This investigation began with the observation of flowers that exhibit these patterns and flowers that didn't exhibit them. Each one of the samples of flowers was photographed and observed rigorously. Once the facts were abridged, the data was organized into tables and graphs. According to the results, the conclusion was that these patterns are present in the flowers of Puerto Rico, that the number that repeats most is five and the color is violet. The size and the flower type are related with these characteristics.<br><br> A significant observation about red flowers was that they have four petals when they are small, but when they grow they develop five petals. This relationship between color and number of petals is peculiar for each plant species. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> <br><br>

The purpose of this project is to synthesize hail damage by artificial defoliation. Analysis of corn yield will be correlated with proposed insurance payments made by crop hail insurance companies. The hypothesis for this project is that artificial corn defoliation will cause a decrease in yield similar to that of the insurance claims and possibly, a greater increase in yield loss at certain growth levels.<br><br> Six plots of corn were planted for two tests. Each plot had three rows and each row had twenty-five plants. Included in each test plot were a control row, 50% defoliation row and 100% defoliation row. Each of two plots were cut at the V6 stage of corn growth. Two more plots were cut at the V8 growth stage. The last two plots were cut at the V10 growth stage. Once these plants had grown into maturity, hand harvesting was done. The yield was placed in separate seed corn bags. The yield from each plot was counted. <br><br>Calculations of estimated yield were also done.<br><br> The results indicated that artificial defoliation hail synthesis yields were similar to suggested insurance claims. The only variation was in test plots that were defoliated in the V6 growth stage. Insurance companies do not cover damage sustained throughout the V6 growth stage of corn. It is concluded that the corn does have a yield loss at this stage. It is possible that the insurance companies should change their rate of payment. However, further investigations are necessary to support this claim.<br><br>

Title: Effects of Natural Chemicals on the Seed Dispersal of Tribulus Terrestris<br><br>Objective: To find what natural chemicals retard the seed dispersal of Tribulus terrestris.<br><br>Methods: Hardness, cloth retention, and shear force were determined. Thorn penetration, rubber retention, and seed dispersal were performed on old and new bicycle tires. Seed dispersal was performed on boots.<br><br>Results: In the rubber retention strength experiments, the cinnamon in a 10% concentration was the most effective in hindering the embedding abilities of the seeds. In the seed compression test, the cloves in a 25% concentration was the most effective in softening the seed and making it easier to crush. In the thorn penetration test, the orange rind in a 10% concentration stayed in the tire the longest. In the cloth retention strength test, the nutmeg in a 10% concentration was the most effective in weakening the seeds’ ability to stay embedded in the cloth.<br><br>Conclusion: In the cloth retention test, the nutmeg was the best inhibitor. In the rubber retention strength test, the cinnamon solution had a similar effect. In the seed compression test, the puncturevine seeds soaked in cloves were crushed more easily. In the thorn penetration test, the orange rind decreased the embedding power.<br><br>

PRODUCTION OF INTERLEUKIN-13 (IL-13) IN TRANSGENIC PLANTS FOR IMMUNOTHERAPY OF TYPE 1 DIABETES
David Wang
A.B. Lucas Secondary School, London, Ontario, Canada

Type 1diabetes (T1D) is a chronic, life threatening, autoimmune disease. Currently there is no effective therapy for this disease. Accumulated evidence suggests that Tlymphocytes including T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper 2(Th2) play a crucial role in T1D development. The disease is primarily mediated by Th1 lymphocytes that synthesize inflammatory cytokine interferon ã (INF-ã), whereas the Th2 cells, which produce anti-inflammatory cytokines, have a beneficial, protective role. Thus, induction of selective deviation (skewing) of harmful Th1 responses towards a protective Th2 phenotype using Th2 cytokines such as IL-13 represents the most promising antigen-specific therapeutic approach. The objective of this study is to produce large amounts of IL-13 in transgenic plants and test if the plant-derived cytokines can be used for oral administration to treat T1D. The human IL-13 gene was cloned and fused with the bacterial CTB gene encoding the mucosal carrier CTB protein that will facilitate effective delivery of the CTB-IL-13 recombinant protein to the gut mucosal cells. CTB-IL-13 and IL-13 were cloned into a plant transformation vector under the control of a constitutive expression promoter. Low-nicotine tobacco was used for Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation. PCR analysis confirmed the presence of the transgenes in the transgenic plants. The expression of IL-13 and CTB-IL-13 in the transgenic plants was demonstrated by northern blot hybridization and western blot analysis. The availability of transgenic plants producing IL-13 and CTB-IL-13 recombinant proteins provides a solid foundation for the development of a plant-based, safe, cost-effective, oral therapy for treatment of T1D.

ION CHANNEL BLOCKERS
Kaitlyn Anne Feeley
North Attleboro High School, North Attleboro MA, USA

Research indicated that studies of mice with Cystic Fibrosis, when treated with the spice turmeric, suggested that the spice is an ion channel blocker (Cystic Fibrosis is caused by a faulty ion channel). Ion channels allow the transport of ions across a cell's membrane. Ion channel blockers can effectively disrupt this movement.<br><br> Gravitropism is a process whereby hypocotyl cells grow in response to gravity, caused by the hormone auxin and calcium. Calcium must move freely through the cells for gravitropism to occur. Thus, if the turmeric suppresses the calcium and the hypocotyls do not grow downwards, it would indicate that it is an ion channel blocker. First zea mays kernels were germinated. When their hypocotyls were 2-3cm long, the kernels were rotated 90 degrees and agar, with concentrations of EDTA (a chelating substance), Calcium Chloride (calcium encourages the process), or turmeric was placed on the tips. Hours later, the roots exposed to turmeric had not bent and grown downwards but had grown in directions other than down, a good indicator that turmeric is an ion channel blocker.<br><br> To test the effectiveness of turmeric, kernels were again germinated, until their hypocotyls were 2-3cm long. They were then rotated and agar with concentrations of Verapamil (wasp venom, an ion channel blocker) or turmeric were placed on the hypocotyls. After 18 hours, the turmeric appeared to have suppressed the calcium just as well as the Verapamil had. From these results, turmeric's usefulness should be considered as a possible alternative therapy for Cystic Fibrosis.

USE OF DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY FOR ASSESSMENT OF WHEAT LEAF COLOUR CHANGES
Zuzana Tvaruzkova
Gymnazium Kromeriz, Kromeriz, Czech Republic

I evaluated the changes of leaf colour in 30 cultivars of winter wheat registered for growing in the territory of the Czech Republic in the growing period following the flag leaf appearance. For this purpose I used the Histogram tool of Hewlett Packard photo smart hp 315 digital camera software. I worked with Lab (CIE L*a*b*) color model in which every color is represented by luminosity (L), a green/red component (a), and a blue/yellow component (b). I created paramether L+a for assessment the leaf color changes effected with wheat genotype, various wheat leaf insertions, different terms of evaluation and infection with leaf diseases.<br><br>I found statistically highly significant differences in L+a levels under the influence of all factors. The L+a levels of fully physiologically active leaves could be found between 10.0–20.0, the first changes due to the ageing indicate levels between 25.0–40.0, more significant ageing was characterized with the increase of levels up to 50.0–60.0 and dead leaves with no green colour had L+a near 80.0 finaly. <br><br>Winter wheat cultivars Bill, Batis, Svitava, Semper, Vlasta, Ludwig and Sarka quickly losed original green colour in both infected and disease-free plots. These genotypes belong to different groups of early or late ripening. It seems to be probable that leaf green colour change is completly indepedent trait. <br><br>The results L+a analysis were confirmed with fluorescence as the standard method for the assessment of leaf photosynthetical activity. <br><br>

'OHELO: PHASE II - IDENTIFY BIOACTIVE COMPOUND ANTIBIOTIC EFFECT OF NATURAL PRODUCTS ON BACILLI SP.
Jessie Ann Ka'iulani Pa'ahana
Kamehameha Schools - Kapalama Campus, Honolulu, HI, USA

Historical accounts confirm that the leaves of ‘öhelo (Vaccinium reticulatum) were made into a tea and administered to patients to treat throat congestion by Hawaiian medicinal practitioners or kahuna la‘au lapa‘au. Therefore, the leaves of ‘öhelo were the source for the extract solubilized in ethanol (EtOH) used for biological and analytical testing in phase I that produced prominent growth inhibition zones against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. The purpose of phase II of this project is to isolate and identify the biologically active antibacterial component in ‘öhelo and evaluate its effectiveness at inhibiting the germination of spore-forming gram-positive bacteria and the growth of anti-biotic resistant microorganisms. <br><br>Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was conducted to separate the individual components of the ‘öhelo extract. Individual fractions were removed from the TLC plates, resolubilized in EtOH and tested against suspension cultures of Bacillus subtilis and the spores of Geobacillus stearothermophilus. Of six fractions isolated from the TLC plates, one fraction (Rf=0.9732) inhibited the growth of these bacilli in agar diffusion and suspension culture assays. Ongoing experimentation is focusing on determining the molecular structure of the active component and its effectiveness against antibiotic resistant bacteria and the germination of bacterial spores.

ARABIDOPSIS PHOSPHOLIPASE A1'S: NOVEL SEQUENCE ANALYSIS AND STEPS TOWARD FUNCITONAL CHARACTERIZATION
David Andrew Levary
Parkway Central High School, St. Louis MO, USA

Phospholipases play broad roles in plant signal transduction, cytoskeletal rearrangement, membrane trafficking, and degradation. This research focuses on phospholipase A1s (PLA1s), an understudied class of phospholipases. Via a bioinformatics approach, a putative PLA1 conserved domain has been discovered and a number of PLA1 candidates identified. Biochemical and physiological characterization is being pursued for At1g30370, a putative PLA1 with predicted mitochondrial localization. In this work, a transgenic strain of Arabidopsis, generated using T-DNA as an insertional mutagen, has been isolated that appears to be deficient in At1g30370 protein product. Sequencing of the insertion’s left and right border flanking sequences has revealed that there are in fact two inverted T-DNA insertions located approximately 200 bp above the coding region as well as a sequence replacement running from 50-30 bp above the start of the gene. The finding appears to be consistent with phenotypic observations of the mutant plants revealing shortened developmental cycles and substantially reduced rosette formation. Northern and Southern blotting is currently being employed to definitively correlate At1g30370 gene expression level and phenotypic response.

DESIGN OF A NOVEL WAVE REACTOR FOR IN SITU CULTURING OF CHLAMYDOMONAS REINHARDTII PHASE I. EFFECT OF WAVE MIXING
Caroline Janet Lang
Independence HS, Yardley, PA, USA

Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a potential source of renewable energy. Culturing the algae in a sulfur-deficient medium alters regular photosynthesis to produce hydrogen instead of oxygen. One of the major roadblocks to hydrogen production, though, is the development of efficient, large-scale photobioreactors. For the current project, a novel bioreactor was designed. This reactor could be scaled up for in situ culturing of C. reinhardtii. In the bench scale version, a 50-gallon aquarium was fitted with a wave generator I designed to simulate the wave action of oceans or bays. Light was provided by two 40-watt fluorescent tubes on a 12 hour light/12 hour dark timer cycle. Temperature of water in the aquarium was also controlled. The bioreactors themselves were polyethylene bags that rode on top of the water and were stirred by the wave action. Two experiments were conducted to determine the impact of wave mixing on C. reinhardtii. In the first experiment, it was hypothesized that cell density would be greater in the wave reactor than in the control reactor, which floated on still water (no waves). Cell density, as measured with a homemade spectrophotometer, was greater (P < 0.03) with the wave mixing. A second experiment measured the effect of wave mixing on the flagella of the alga, since mechanical mixing is known to shear the delicate flagella. It was hypothesized that phototaxis would be impacted negatively by wave mixing. Phototaxis was measured with image analysis of time-lapse photography. Wave mixing did not affect the phototaxis of C. reinhardtii.

Research for this project was prompted from an interest in the way plants grow, and in how to achieve a more improved way to grow plants that are healthy at a quicker rate. This interest resulted in the creation of a project on how the different wavelengths of light affect the rate of photosynthesis in plants. The hypothesis for this experiment, if a longer wavelength is used, then the photosynthesis rate will become faster, was drawn from researching the topic. <br><br> Photosynthesis rate was determined by measuring the average growth of each set of Chinese mung bean sprouts. These beans were placed under four different colored lights, in example, red, green, blue, and white. The sprouts were watered everyday for three months. They were measured once a week and recorded in a data log.<br><br> Throughout the experiment the white light’s plants were the healthiest and longest in sprout length, followed by the red plants, then the green, and last the blue. During the third month both the green and the blue plants died. The white light’s plants remained the healthiest accompanied by the red with its plants not as healthy as the white’s. <br><br> The white light was added to see if a mixture of wavelengths would lead to any interesting results. The results of this project complimented the hypothesis, which stated if a longer wavelengths is used, then the photosynthesis rate will become faster. The longest wavelength, the red light, caused the most growth. <br><br>

DETERMINATION OF CYANIDE CONTENT IN PHILIPPINE CASSAVA (MANIHOT ESCULENTA)
Oliver Glenn Villarin Hernaez
De La Salle High School, Concord, California, United States of America

Cassava is a staple crop in many third world countries that is an edible but poisonous plant. It produces a cyanogenic glucoside called linamarin. Using the picrate test method, cyanide levels from the cassava root, leaf, sap, and flour were determined. Linamarase enzyme was used to enhance linamarin hydrolysis. The question being answered was: “Is the hydrogen cyanide content of the Philippine cassava root, sap, leaf, and flour samples, over the toxic level of thirty ppm?” Picrate paper and phosphate buffer paper with pH of 6.0 were prepared with the use of filter paper. In conducting the experiment, phosphate buffer paper was placed in a film canister and 0.1 mL of linamarase was added. A sample was added followed by 0.5 mL of water. After that, a picrate paper was inserted before the container was sealed and set at room temperature overnight. A color chart was used to determine the cyanide level in ppm. Ten samples of each kind, roots, leaves, sap, and flour, were tested. Sample averages were 23.5 ppm for the roots, 15.5 ppm for the leaves, 8.0 ppm for the sap, and 7.0 ppm for the flour. These are below the danger level of 30 ppm. Testing the total cyanogenic glucosides through varieties of cassava samples would conclude which type of species of cassava have higher levels of cyanide. The picrate test method is essential in determining cyanogenic levels in cassava plants to ensure the safety of populations consuming cassava crops.

Finally, to test the teas for their insecticidal properties.<br><br>Procedures: Collected 20 teas (10 black and 10 green), and prepared solutions by blending 10 grams of tea with 200mls of distilled water. (20:1)<br><br>Plant Study: Compared four barley seeds for root and shoot growth, and germination percentage of the plants, while using tea as a growth promotant.<br><br>Pathogen Study: Tested twenty teas for their inhibitory properties on three pure cultures of bacteria.<br><br>Insect Study: Introduced tea solutions to mealworms and giant mealworms and timed their fatality rate to determine the insecticidal properties of tea.<br><br>Caffeine Extraction: To determine the caffeine content of teas and observe their correlation to the test results.<br><br>Conclusion: For the plant study, nineteen of the twenty teas promoted the growth of barley, as compared to distilled water. In Kirby Bauer, all of the teas had an inhibition zone of 19-25 millimeters in diameter. For the insect study, green tea had the fastest fatality rate, as compared to black tea. The caffeine content of black tea had almost twice the amount of caffeine, compared to green tea. Overall, I feel that tea has the potential to be used as a growth promotant and pesticidal agent.<br><br>

AUTUMN OLIVE: IDENTIFICATION, CONTROL, AND UTILIZATION
Patricia Jean Sefton
Parkersburg High School, Parkersburg WV, USA

Initially, control of the invasive Autumn Olive plant (Elaegnus umbellata)was sought. However, after further research the potential usefulness of the nitrogen fixing bacteria Frankia as a potential soil innoculate became clear. So both areas were studied. First the control of the plant, then the utilization of the plants root nodules in aiding the growth of other plants.<br><br> After some research, it was discovered that similarities in behavior were shared between strains of Frankia and tuberculosis. Antibiotics that would destroy tuberculosis, would have a similar effect on Frankia. Rifamycin was chosen to be used in the autumn olive seeds to prevent or stop root growth. In the experiment 150mg of the drug for every 250mL of water was selected. The drug was expensive so minimal use was chosen. Growth was determined by root length and measured every 2 weeks after germination. Presented in the project is how growth rates were effected by adding the antibiotic. This area proved the vital role the bacteria played in the success in the plant. <br><br> Next, utilization of the plants root nodules for agricultural benefit was studied. This was accomplished by digging up Autumn Olive trees and removing the large nodules on the roots. Then nodules were placed in a food processor and added to soil mediums where beans (legumes) and carrots (non-legumes) were growing. Presented in the project are the effects the bacteria played in aiding growth of both plants.<br><br> The results were interesting as well as beneficial to humanity. With a deeper understanding of our microscopic friends, herbicides can be abandoned, but at the same time so can fertilizers.<br><br>

SUGAR LEVELS IN APPLES INCREASE WITH TIME
Joshua David Wade
Sherando High School, Stephen's City, Virginia, United States of America

The question that was answered in this experiment was “How does time affect the amount of sugar present in apples?” The independent variable in this investigation was time and the dependent variable in this experiment was the amount of sugar present in apples. The hypothesis was that if more time passes, then more sugar will be present in the apples.<br><br> The hypothesis was tested using three tests on four different types of apples. First, the circumference of each apple was measured in millimeters. Then a quarter sized slice of skin was removed using a knife. Pressure was tested with a penetrometer. Juice was collected during the pressure testing with an eyedropper. Then this juice was put on the handheld refractometer. The apple was cut in half horizontally and the top half was placed in a pan that had iodine in the bottom to soak for two minutes. The apple was then compared to the starch-iodine index. The results were recorded and the process was repeated until all apples had been tested. <br><br> Results proved the hypothesis by showing a correlation between time and sugar levels. The starch-iodine test showed that more sugar is present as time progresses. This test measures the amount of starch in apples because iodine stains the starch. As starch in the apple turns to sugar less staining occurs. However, the pressure testing results and soluble sugar results did not agree with this starch-iodine test. While there are discrepancies, there is evidence enough for support of the hypothesis.<br><br>

OPTIMIZING TISSUE STERILIZATION IN CYPRIPEDIUM REGINAE MERISTEM CULTURE
Joseph Paul Dexter
Green Mountain Union High School, Chester, Vermont, United States of America

Cypripedium reginae (Showy Lady’s Slipper) is an impressive terrestrial orchid native to northeastern North America. While meristem tissue culture has developed into a widely used form of orchid micropropagation, an effective meristem culture technique remains to be developed for C. reginae. Determining a sterilization procedure for tissue explants that kills contaminating microorganisms without severely damaging the explants is critical to developing an effective meristem culture method for any orchid species. In this investigation, C. reginae explants were cultured axenically on Steele’s (1995) modified Harvais (1982) medium. Prior to culturing, the explants were treated with sodium hypochlorite in varying time intervals and concentrations. In the cultures that did not become contaminated, the tissue degradation caused by each sterilization procedure was observed and compared to determine which had the smallest impact on the quality of the explants while still eliminating all contamination. <br><br><br> A baseline sterilization procedure of 0.60% sodium hypochlorite for 30 minutes was initially derived from Steele’s (1995) recommendations for sterilizing C. reginae seed. This was expected to represent the optimal sterilization technique for C. reginae tissue. However, it was demonstrated that sterilization procedures deviating from the baseline seem considerably more effective. Specifically, it appears that increasing the concentration of the sodium hypochlorite concentration while decreasing the sterilization time minimizes explant damage compared to using lower concentrations for a longer period of time. A provisional mathematical model for the relationship between explant damage and sterilization procedure has been developed. <br><br>

IN SEARCH OF A NATURAL TREATMENT FOR PUCCINIA HEMEROCALLIDIS PHASE III
Kyle James Yawn
Warner Robins High School, Warner Robins GA, USA

Puccinia hemerocallidis, commonly known as daylily rust, has only been in North America since the fall of 2000. Not much is known about it and there is currently no fugicide that specifically lists "daylily" and "rust" on its label. Many harmful chemicals are being used to treat this fungus. In past studies with daylily rust, the application of silicate solutions helped cause resistance to the rust and an ammonia silicate did this better than others that were tested. The varying concentrations of ammonia silicate were applied in this experiment to try and find an optimal mixture for resistance to daylily rust. A plot was laid out with 160 daylilies of the cultivar “Miss Lucille”. They were divided into groups of 4 and each group was randomly assigned one of five application concentrations, 5 g/L, 10 g/L, 15 g/L, 20 g/L, and a control group that received water. Rust infected plants were introduced. The pustules on the underside of the foliage of each plant were counted to reveal its resistance to the rust. The applications worked very well with the highest concentration, 20 g/L, working the best. The untreated control group averaged over 6 pustules per plant, while the 20 g/L concentration averaged one pustule per four plants. The chlorophyll content of the plants was also measured using a SPAD meter. The chlorophyll content of the treated plants was higher than the untreated control group, and gradually rose as the concentration of ammonia silicate increased to 20 g/L concentration.

SOIL MOIST VS. VERMICULITE
Margo L Woodall
TGU-Granville, Granville, North Dakota, U.S.A

My research question, To what extent does rooting powder affect the rate of growth of geraniums? I had three control groups in my experiment; soil, soil moist, and vermiculite. I also had three test groups; soil with rooting powder, soil with soil moist and rooting powder, and soil with vermiculite and rooting powder. These groups were placed under a growing light in a growing cart. I monitored them 5 times a week, and I watered them 5 times a week. My hypothesis for this experiment was, soil moist with rooting powder would grow at a rate faster, than the vermiculite with rooting powder and the plain soil with rooting powder. My conclusion was that my hypothesis failed. Soil moist with rooting powder had rooted well. Yet, vermiculite with rooting powder had grown more in the experimental process. If I could do this experiment again I would test for a longer amount of time. My procedure was, cut geraniums, poke them into wet soil, place them into growing trays, monitor their growth, and record all data into my log book.

HOW MUCH SAP COULD A SAPSUCKER SUCK IF A SAPSUCKER COULD SUCK SAP?
Lia-Lucine Lara Cary, William Colin Read
Jensen Beach High School, Jensen Beach, FL, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine what factors encourage Aphyrapicus varius to bore holes in particular species of trees. It was hypothesized that the sapsuckers would prefer trees with thin bark, soft bark, sweet sap, and greater amounts of sap over trees with thick bark, hard bark, little amounts of sap, or sap with decreased sugar content. Trees chosen with sapsucker holes were Australian Pine, Black Olive, and Tropical Almond trees. Trees chosen without sapsucker holes included Gumbo Limbo, Orange Tree, and Pigeon Plum trees.<br><br>A core sampler was inserted into each type of tree and a cross-section taken of the sample. Bark thickness was directly measured from the cross-section. A probe was swung as a pendulum providing equal force during each test. The penetration distance of the probe was used a measurement of bark hardness. Sap was collected from equal numbers of holes in the trees using a pipette, and the sap quantities compared. Equal amounts of sap were diluted with equal amounts of water and frozen. Freezing time was used as a measure of the sugar content in the sap.<br><br>It was determined that sapsuckers choose trees based on soft bark, sweet sap, and large amounts of sap. The results indicated that thinner barks did not play a part in the sapsucker’s targeted species. Identification of the features that sapsuckers use to target is the first step in finding a strategy to protect certain ornamental trees from the damaging effects of the inflicted wounds.<br><br>

DIRECT EVIDENCE OF THE SYMPLASTIC PATHWAY IN THE TRAP OF THE BLADDERWORT UTRICULARIA GIBBA
Sonya Di-Chiao Juang, Tanya Chun-Chiao Juang
Wu Fu Jr. High School, St . Dominic High Sch., Kaohsiung, Taiwan Chinese Taipei

To capture prey, Utricularia gibba, a unique aquatic angiospermic carnivorous plant, is equipped with specialized bladders containing bifid/quadrifid glands for nutrient absorption. Several studies have focused on the nutrient absorption and subsequent transportation in the bladderworts; more specifically, the apoplastic pathway has been demonstrated employing radioactive uranium salts. Nevertheless, the symplastic pathway has not been unambiguously demonstrated. Herein we initially used food dyes as tracers to monitor the absorption processes by light microscopy. We then confirmed the observed symplastic pathway using another vital tracer carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA). CFDA itself is a membrane permeable dye which is converted into carboxyfluorescein (CF) by cytosolic esterases. Since CF is membrane impermeable, it serves as a reliable fluorescent tracer of the phloem symplast. The absorption and transportation of the CFDA inside the traps were observed using epifluorescence microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Our data clearly suggested that the tracers were transported through different tissues in the following order: terminal cells, stalks, pedestal cells, basal cells, surrounding epidermal cells, nearby leaves and finally stems. The process was found to be light sensitive, suggesting that it is energy dependent. The uptake of the fluorescent dye was observed within seconds while that of food dyes required 2 to 3 hours. Thus, CFDA provides better resolution while the food dyes afford prolonged tracing procedures. Taken together, the findings lead us to conclude that the symplastic pathway is an important transportation process, which has never been shown, in this carnivorous plant.

UNDERSTANDING LEUCINE-RICH REPEATS AND THEIR ROLES IN GENE FAMILIES THROUGH THE STUDY OF GENES AT1G68780, AT1G13230, AND AT428560 IN ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA DEVELOPMENT
John James Hutchison, Varun Rajendra Hippalgaonkar

Arabidopsis thaliana is one of few organisms with its genome fully mapped. This map is a valuable tool, helping to determine specific gene functions. A number of gene functions in Arabidopsis have been determined including, (At1g80800) TMM, which is known to play a role in the asymmetrical division in the epidermis of plant leaves; however, there has never been in a conclusive study of genes At1g68780, At1g13230, and At4g28560. It is important to study the genes as a group, because they are all leucine-rich and in the same gene family. The concepts and understanding of gene families has seldom been the subject of a concentrated focus, thus adding to the knowledge of gene families is vital for the understanding of genetics as a whole. After additional data collection, the idea that At1g68780 had a role in the formation of stomata was strengthened. Recent chlorophyll extractions also indicate the mutant plants may also be chlorotic, containing less chlorophyll in their leaves. When genetically crossed with a mutant TMM the resultant offspring have a radically ney phenotype. The generation of plants was red, stunted, and seemed to be more susceptible to fungi. This indicates a possible strong correlation and large overlapping function for the two genes. Observations of mutant At1g13230 have indicated that the gene plays a role in development. When the gene is knocked out, the plant grew larger, much more rapidly. Lastly, the gene At4g28560 appears to play a role, similar to that of TMM's, in the division of cells on the epidermis of the leaf. This was documented by what was observed as a high frequency of smaller epidermal cells. The structural similarities between the genes studied and innate defense mechanisms in plants, and animals, make understanding how these specific genes and the gene family work, important to the overall understanding of cellular communication. The experiments increase knowledge of genes and gene families, and provide a base for future research.

Iquique is located at the Pacific coast inside the Atacama region. Its deserted soils provide a high degree of salinity. The quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) is a pseudo cereal with a high resistance against environmental factors like salinity and water stress. For this reason we investigated if the quinoa is suitable for plantations in areas where sweet water is scarce. We focused on the hypothesis that the quinoa is capable to germinate under irrigation with water that contains high salt concentrations. <br><br> In order to address the hypothesis, we investigated the germination of quinoa seeds and the development of plantlets in Petri dishes under irrigation with sweet water mixed with 0 %, 50 %, 75 %, and 100 % of seawater. Our results showed that 100 % of seawater inhibited the germination of quinoa seeds (96 h after irrigation), but 50 % and 75 % of sea water induced a degree of germination similar to the irrigated control (P < 0.05).<br><br> We conclude that the quinoa adapts to high salt concentration in the water used for irrigation. The quinoa could therefore be a promising seed for costal regions with sufficient access to seawater, but limited access to sweet water. We are presently investigating the complete life circle of the quinoa under controlled conditions. <br><br>

THE EFFECT OF NITRATE CONCENTRATION ON THE GROWTH OF ALGAE BLOOMS AND EPIPHYTES IN CORRELATION TO THE HEALTH OF AQUATIC LIFE INDIGENOUS TO THE CHESAPEAKE BAY
Gabrielle Marie Strike, Anup Myneni
York High School, Yorktown, VA, United States of America

The purpose of this experiment is to investigate the adverse effects of nitrates on the health of Chesapeake Bay ecosystem as a result from the growth of algae blooms and epiphytes. During the two weeks of experimentation, four tanks containing 0 stockings of nitrate concentrations (tank A), 2 stockings of nitrate concentrations (B), 4 stockings of nitrate concentrations (C), 5 stockings of nitrate concentrations (D) were tested for varying levels of oxygen content, nitrogen content, aquatic light reduction, and epiphyte growth. At the end of the two week period the results confirmed that higher levels of nitrate concentration increased the growth of algae blooms and epiphytes, thus creating a malignant environment for submerged vegetation and marine life. <br><br> <br><br> The nitrate levels at the end of the two weeks increased more in tank D than in the other three tanks, including tank A. This showed that increased nitrate concentrations lead to an even higher level of nitrogen. The oxygen levels at the end of the two weeks originally increased in all tanks, but began to decrease after the first few days of testing. As more nitrates were introduced into the tanks, the oxygen levels both increased and decreased more sharply and rapidly. Ultimately, at the end of experimentation, the tanks with the most nitrates had the lowest levels of oxygen present. As nitrogen amounts in the tanks increased, the growth of algae increased dramatically, increasing the amount of light reduction. At the end of the two weeks, the slides placed in the tanks to monitor epiphytes were removed and the light reductions through the slides were measured using a light meter. The results of the test showed that the tanks with the most nitrates also had the highest number of epiphytes present. <br><br>

TISSUE REGENERATION CAPACITY OF THE PLAN GRAPTOPHYLLUM PICTUM ON LUMBRICUS TERRESTRIS
Celines Acevedo-Milan, Jose L. Mercado-Santiago
Jose A. Castillo Junior High School, Sabana Grande, PUERTO RICO

Graptophyllum pictum is commonly known as caricature plant, and it has anti-inflammatory properties. The reviewed literature shows that this plant has a big variety of pigments and three chemical components: glycosides, aromatic lipids and emollient substances. From the very beginning a toxicity test was done with the big shrimp larvae at second stage (Macrobrachium rosenbergii). In the experimental groups there was no mortality for the used specimens for both concentrations of the plant extracts. There was just a behavioral change of aggressiveness, but after a 6 hour period everything was back to normal. The Thin Layer Chromatography tests revealed the presence of five chemical compounds. The presence of Vitamin E and C was suspected in the plant because of it’s medicinal properties. Chromatographic strips done with these vitamins demonstrated that ratio fronts were very similar to the ones obtained for the plant extract. During the regeneration tissue capacity tests a 50% concentration of the plant extract and a 100% concentration of it were used. With both concentrations the tissue regenerated faster than in the control group. The specimens of Lumbricus terrestris in experimental group 1 regenerated in three days, but the ones in experimental group 2 regenerated in only one day. It can be concluded that the extract of the plant Graptophillum pictum decreased the regeneration time of the skin cells of the earthworm (Lumbricus terrestris). It is planned to use this plant as a medicine to regenerate epidermis and dermis tissue in human beings.

EFFECTS OF AN ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT ON PHASEOLUS VULGARIS ELECTROBEANS
Elizabeth Murphy Czura, Colby Foss
Hilton Head Preparatory School, Hilton Head Island, SC 

The objective of this experiment was to observe and record the effects of an electrical circuit on bean growth, germination, and leafing, compared to bean growth in its natural state. It was predicted that an electrical current would stunt the growth of the bean plants and that the naturally grown beans would surpass the growth of those that were included in the electrical circuit. <br><br> The first step in this experiment was to set up both the electrical system and the plant system. A lightbulb was placed in the circuit, whose illumination verified circuit flow. Once this was performed, growth was recorded every other day for ten days.<br><br> The average growth of tray A, the natural growing beans, was 7.14cm occuring over seven days. The average growth for tray B, the beans that grew in an electrical current, was 8.75cm. The data showed Tray B on average grew higher, due to the electrical current.<br><br> The hypothesis was rejected because the electrical current stimulated the growth of the bean plants rather than stunting the development. The beans closest to the wires of the electric circuit in Tray B grew taller than the other plants in Tray B.<br><br> The relevance of this experiment is how the anions and the cations in the electric current react with the charges of the soil and fertilizer (nitrogen) and its effect on the ability of nutrients to reach plants and, in return on plant growth.<br><br>

DEHISCENCE AND DISPERSAL OF THE POPPING POD (RUELLIA TUBEROSA L.)
Suksun Itthipanyanan, Tanongsak Chinaroonchai, Krongrath Suwannasri
Triam Udom Suksa School, Bangkok, Thailand

The Popping pod plant (Ruellia tuberosa L.) has the long-subcylindrical capsule with the lock area for seed dispersal at the tip. The specific position at the tip is required for water absorption to unlock the mature capsule for seed dispersal. With safranin-O and iodine solution w/ 70% sulfuric acid staining, the lock area consists of different types of fiber cells. The tissue in water absorption position is composed of cells with high pectin content, while cellulose is the major component in the cell wall of cells in other regions. These characteristics are thought to be important for dehiscence mechanism of Popping pod. When the Popping pods are separated into 4 groups according to pod length, group A (1.60-1.79 cm.), group B (1.80-1.99 cm.), group C (2.00-2.19 cm) and group D (2.20-2.39 cm), it is found that group C is the largest group and shows optimum kinetic energy shared among valves and seeds. The energy enhances seeds to scatter at the highest velocity and the farthest distance. This supports the natural selection theory as the Popping pods in group C are the most common pod length in the population we studied.

THE EFFECT OF GOETHITE AND CO2 LEVELS ON BRASSICA RAPA
Rachel Elizabeth Delevett, Lauren Staci Powell
Rockdale Magnet School for Science and Technology, Conyers, GA, USA

Goethite, a mineral found in Georgia red clay was discovered on Mars, and is known to form only in the presence of water. Additionally, the presence of concentrated carbon dioxide, suggest the possibility that conditions for plant growth could exist or have existed on Mars. This research aims to model these conditions to test if plant growth occurs. The hypothesis stated that if goethite was added to the soil and the CO2 concentration was high, then the plants would show no differences or improvements in health and height when compared to the control. Varying levels of both goethite and CO2 were tested by creating six controlled environments of increasing amounts of CO2 (400-5000ppm). Within each CO2 environment, six levels of Goethite (0-5% by mass) were added to soil samples. Six Brassica rapa seeds were planted for each Goethite level and allowed to grow for 5 weeks. CO2 levels were adjusted weekly to remain consistent. Height, color, leaf number, flower number, and stem strength were measured weekly. The data was statistically analyzed and showed some statistical differences between groups when CO2 levels were compared, but no statistical differences among groups when goethite levels were compared. This seems to support the possibility that plants can successfully grow at increasingly high levels of CO2. The importance of goethite in the soil has not been defined.

Andrews High School , Andrews TX, USA

There have been different experiments testing the effectso of music on plants. In our research we found tests there were mixed opinions as to whether music affected the plants. We decided to experiment on common plants, tomatoes and peppers. Instead of playing different types of music to the plants we wanted to see if the lyrics would make a difference upon the growth rate and the germination of the plants. We decided to play classical, rock, and rap to groups of five tomato plants and five pepper plants. Within eah category there were two groups. One group was exposed to positive lyrics, the other negative, We performed this test three times to verify our results.<br><br> Each group was rotated through the same cycle of twelve hours of muic per week. When the groups were not listening to music thry were kept in a greenhouse. The greenhouse and the testing area had the same environment so that this would not corrupt our results.<br><br> Our results showed that the music benefited to all of the test groups. The classical group showed the best results, the rap group did the second best, followed by the rock group, and lastly, the control group. There was not a sufficient amount of difference between the positive and negative groups to determine that the lyrics affected the plants. We have come to the conclusion that music helped the plants in their overall health.
