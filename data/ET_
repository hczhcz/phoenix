It is estimated that Americans use more than 380 million gallons of gas every day. According to experts, if everyone bought the most fuel-efficient car available, the U.S. would save about l.47 billion gallons of gasoline each year! The purpose of this project is to determine if it is plausible to match the gas mileage (MPG) of the most fuel-efficient car currently on the road, by EPA standards.<br><br>Two cars were tested, the first vehicle tested was rated by the EPA as the most fuel efficient vehicle on the road in 2007 and the second vehicle tested was my own personal vehicle. The goal was to match the gas mileage of the first vehicle by increasing the MPG of my vehicle using various methods. Both were tested with no additives. The remaining tests were performed on my vehicle. Seven different additives/methods were performed. Acetone was also tested from 1 oz. - 3 oz. (ounces per 10 gallons) in .5 oz. increments to determine its maximum efficiency. The Scan Gauge II (digital MPG gauge) was hooked up both cars so the MPG would be read with the same meter. Each test was run three times to obtain an average. All the gas was drained out of the fuel tank; then 5 gallons of gasoline was poured into the empty tank. The appropriate amount of additive was added to the fuel (1/3 tank). The trip button was reset to “0” before driving the same route to include 50 combined city/highway miles. The Average MPG button on Scan Gauge II was pressed. Then the data was recorded.<br><br> <br><br>My hypothesis proved to be true. Adding 2.5 oz. Acetone per 10 gallons of gas matched the combined city/highway MPG of the first vehicle. When the “Condensator” was added to the vehicle, along with the Acetone, a consistent 2 MPG was attained, exceeding the total combined MPG of the first vehicle, and most hybrid EPA estimates. I would have tested the CO2 emissions also, but I could not locate the proper equipment.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF A SAILOR'S MASS ON THE SPEED OF A LASER RADIAL SAILBOAT IN VARIOUS WIND CONDITIONS
Reguli Elisabeth Granger
Science Center Home School, St. Petersburg, Florida, USA

This project determines the ideal mass for the skipper of a Laser Radial sailboat in three different wind speeds (5, 10, and 15 knots), by figuring out how mass affects the speed of this boat.<br><br>I gathered data by sailing timed trials with various masses added to my current mass, testing from 57 kg to 77 kg. I sailed 10 trials for each mass at every 2.5 kg interval, and completed these runs in the three wind speeds of 5, 10, and 15 knots, representing light, medium, and heavy wind.<br><br>I was able to tabulate and graph this data, thus finding an equation relating mass to boat speed for each wind speed. This plus my data points led me to conclude that in 5 knots, the smallest mass, 57 kg, is most desirable as the boat traveled the fastest. In medium-strength wind (10 knots), 67 kg is the most ideal. Furthermore, in 15 knots, the mass of 77 kg resulted in the fastest boat speed. All the data which I collected was graphed in sinusoidal patterns, resulting in equations of y=1.17sin(0.0803x+3.76)+1.95, y=0.63(0.3228x+5.03)+3.71, and y=1.53sin(0.0704x+1.5)+3.5707 for 5, 10, and 15 knots respectively.<br><br>The results of my project can be applied to all Laser Radial sailing. Sailors can use this information to compute which wind speed will work best for them. Sailors may then concentrate practice at that determined speed, thus indicating whether they need to gain or lose a significant amount of mass for competitive purposes.

FUELING THE FUTURE
Suman Nag
Brookwood High School, Snellville Georgia, United States of America

America’s dependency on OPEC for petroleum fuel and the detrimental effects of fossil fuels on the environment have led scientists to investigate domestically produced alternative energies. Solar energy is the ultimate source of alternative energy but the massive revolution that is required to switch to solar energy needs an intermediary stage of transition. This seems to be the use of biofuels. <br><br> The core of this two-fold project involves the derivation of ethanol from sweet potatoes, a crop that gives more carbohydrates than corn (the currently popular ethanol source) and regular potatoes. However, in order to ferment ethanol from the carbohydrates, yeast is required. <br><br> There are three industrial strains of yeast that desire to partner with the ethanol business. In order to determine the most economical strain, each of the three industrial strains, a widely used academic strain and Baker's Yeast (control) were tested for growth rates under varying temperatures and glucose concentrations. It was hypothesized that under both conditions, there will be a peak of optimal growth. <br><br> First, the 250mL YPA growth media was made in accordance to glucose concentration. For example, if 2% glucose was needed, then 10mL of 50% glucose would be added to 240mL of YPA. Five test tubes each received 40mL of the media and 0.4mL of a respective yeast strain (in this project, the experiment was performed blind to relieve bias). The tubes were put into temperature controlled water baths. <br><br> Absorbance of light was measured with a spectrometer every hour. Doubling time was calculated to determine growth rates. The data indicates that under both conditions, strain 6 exhibited fastest doubling times. Optimal conditions are under 15% glucose at 33 degrees Celsius with a range as high as 35 degrees Celsius. <br><br>

USING SOLAR CONCENTRATION FOR ETHANOL PRODUCTION
Jeffrey Daniel Fahland
Wrenshall High School, Wrenshall, MN, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to construct an apparatus that would maximize yield by using free energy to the greatest advantage. The hypothesis is by using a parabolic curved dish; ethanol should be able to be distilled from a mixture by focusing reflected solar energy onto a boiler. This process may avoid the use of excessive amounts of energy that is normally needed in industrial ethanol production. The substance produced should be flammable to the extent that it will burn in an open container. Purification to the point of being able to be used as a motor fuel is beyond what I am trying to do at this time. The free energy that will be used is the sun’s energy. The successful use of solar energy to distill a mixture of fermented plant material and water into ethanol should be the result.<br><br> The procedure is as follows: 1. Build a polar mount to mount the reflector on and to steer the apparatus with. 2. Construct a binary refluxing fractional distillation unit. 3. The distillation unit was attached to the dish and aimed towards the sun. <br><br> In conclusion, I believed that ethanol could be produced by using the sun instead of burning fuel or using electricity. This method successfully distilled ethanol that would burn in an open container, using only solar energy for the distillation process.<br><br>

TRANSESTERIFICATION: THE CHEF OF FUELS
Christopher Ernie Lopez
Taos High School, Taos, NM, USA

It is in the best interest of America to develop alternative renewable energy resources, thus decreasing our dependency on foreign oil. The objective of this experiment was to determine whether soy bean oil (SBO) would be converted into an alternative renewable fuel (Bio-Diesel) by esterification. This may lead to solutions of such problems: the disposal of used vegetable oil, the depletion of fossil fuels, and decrease air pollution. <br><br> It is hypothesized that heating SBO repeatedly will affect the level of esterification to Bio-Diesel (BD). It is also hypothesized that as the % BD proportioned with Fossil-Diesel (FD), increases caloric output and decreases hydrocarbons.<br><br> The procedure was begun by preparing a titration standard for the SBO. Next the catalyst (sodium methoxide) was prepared. 100 mL of SBO was heated to 171°C for 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes for 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 times. The SBO samples chemically reacted with sodium methoxide at 48-54°C for 50 minutes. The sample gravity separated at 22°C for 72 hrs. Congealants were removed from the BD. Caloric output, viscosity, density, pH, and % transmittance were determined for BD, FD and proportioned BD/FD solutions. <br><br> The collected data shows that as the SBO is heated repeatedly for up to 120 minutes (5x each), the BD % yield increased from 80.01 to 84.4. The caloric output was higher in the 20% BD/FD than all the other samples. The amount of hydrocarbons emitted was lower in the BD. <br><br> It is concluded that SBO can be used as an excellent source for BD synthesis with a good % yield. This will reduce the amount of hydrocarbons and eliminate waste vegetable oil. The data collected and interpreted does support the hypotheses and are therefore accepted as presented. <br><br>

DEVELOPMENT OF AN EFFICIENT THERMOACOUSTIC ENGINE YEAR III: OPTIMIZING COMPONENTS OF A TRAVELING WAVE ENGINE
Daniel Lawrence Murphy Jr.
Episcopal High School, Jacksonville, FL, United States

The purpose of this investigation was to determine what factors in the design and operation of a traveling wave thermoacoustic cycle (TAC) engine will increase its power density and efficiency. The thermoacoustic cycle is accomplished by the rapid heating of gas parcels taken from a cold-side reservoir and periodically injected into a combination waveguide-heat exchanger. The violent expansion of each gas parcel generates an acoustic wavefront that is controlled and vectored by the waveguide to do work on a reciprocating mechanism converting the acoustic energy into electrical energy. This technology has the potential to become a practical means for harvesting thermal energy that is presently wasted or economically unable to be used because TAC engines run off any heat source whatsoever and contain only one moving part. An engine was built from stainless steel and aluminum materials. The testing included characterization of the engine-generator performance in several working fluid mixtures. Engine performance was optimized for each working fluid by adjusting operating temperatures, pressures and waveguide and inertance tube geometry. The performance in the various working fluids was compared. Factors inhibiting the production of power in the TAC were found to include the heating mechanism and the amplitude of the original sound wave. The engine produced a maximum of 0.707mW electric power and substantially more acoustic power. The optimum inertance length was found to be 5cm. A positive correlation with power production was found between waveguide length, static pressure, and temperature.

SOLVING THE HYDROGEN STORAGE PROBLEM: METAL AMMINES AS A HIGH DENSITY CARBON-NEUTRAL HYDROGEN CARRIER
Ariah Aram Klages-Mundt
Winona Senior High School, Winona, MN, USA

The consumption and pollution of fossil fuels has led to a search for alternative energy sources for electricity and transportation. Use of renewable sources and carbon sequestration could be applied to generating hydrogen as a sustainable, non-polluting, energy carrier. Due to problems with current hydrogen storage, the metal ammine Ca(NH3)8Cl2(s) offers a high density solution to the search for formidable hydrogen storage materials. The purpose of this research was to analyze the properties of this ammine pertaining to hydrogen storage and demonstrate its potential. No information was found in a literature search on the use of this compound for hydrogen storage. The goals were to meet DOE guidelines for hydrogen storage using Ca(NH3)8Cl2(s) and make improvements over studied hydrogen storage techniques. The compound was tested for sorption and desorption of ammonia to CaCl2(s) and enthalpy change accompanying the release of ammonia. CaCl2(s) was shown to experimentally absorb 55.08% ammonia by mass resulting in a net hydrogen density of 9.778% by mass. Volumetric hydrogen density was 0.12 kg/L; Energy density was 14.12 MJ/L. This shows improvement over other types of hydrogen storage and exceeds DOE goals. Subsequently, vehicles can travel over 650km using standard 14-gallon tanks. Ammonia was released from Ca(NH3)8Cl2(s) through three steps completed upon reaching 280ºC, which is more favorable than other metal ammines. The materials are inexpensive and the process is completely renewable. All-in-all, further research is needed to verify results and formulate a more extensive scientific basis for this compound before a prototype system can be developed.

PHASE THREE: FINAL FABRICATION AND TESTING OF A FULL-SCALE WORKING PROTOTYPE LANDSAILER THAT USES A SET OF PAIRED SYMMETRICAL SELF-ADJUSTING WINGS FOR SALES
Christopher Brennan Long
Angel's Rest Homeschool, Pearisburg VA, USA

The purpose of this activity was to evaluate if a proprietary dual-wing assembly can be applied to landsailers. <br><br>The first phase (2005) focused on the design and construction of a quarter scale radio-controlled model that demonstrated the feasibility of applying a wedge-controlled dual-wing to a landsailer. Successful model testing led to the design and initial fabrication of a full scale prototype in phase two (2006). Initial testing demonstrated that the wing mounting single-bearing system provided inadequate vertical support for the wing. The redesign of this system became the major activity of phase three in 2007.<br><br>Phase three activities:<br><br>Redesign and fabrication included the addition of triangular bearing stabilizing struts and a tapered wing configuration was designed and fabricated to allow the use of steel-cable wing shrouds attached to a wing-top bearing. Micro-turbulators were positioned on the surface of the redesigned wing to allow the wings to operate at higher angles of attack to the relative wind without stalling.<br><br>Initial testing demonstrated that the following three changes were required: (1) the main bearing location was moved forward to allow improved weather-vaning; (2) the wing top bearing was replaced with one of higher quality to reduce shroud-induced drag; (3) additional counterbalance weight was added to horizontally balance the wing assembly. <br><br> Testing continues at the local airport as of this abstract date with current results leading to the conclusion that a dual-wing configuration provides a stable and safe wind-powered vehicle in light to moderate winds.<br><br>

EFFECTS OF IMPURITIES AND SURFACE SENSITIZATION IN OXIDE PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS.
Ishaan Guptasarma
University school of Milwaukee, Milwaukee Wisconsin, USA

New photo-elecro-chemical solar cells are a technology being developed to find alternatives for expensive silicon solar cells. These are made by sandwiching naturally dyed semiconductor oxides and an electrolyte between transparent conductive glass plates. In this project, I have performed experiments to better understand the process of conversion of light to electric charge, and the mechanism of charge transfer in these cells. <br><br> The project presented here is continued from the previous year. Last year, I had fabricated and compared the properties of photocells made with different oxides and dyes. This year, I have performed further experiments to better understand some of my unusual observations, and to provide a plausible hypothesis regarding the mechanism for these observations: (a) I have further investigated the observation of a significant ‘storage effect’ observed last year in some cells. I had observed that some cells held charge for up to 10 minutes after the power source (a controlled light source) was removed. I have confirmed that cells made from oxides with impurities or defects store charge for longer time. Is the storage due to an intrinsic capacitance of the cell? I constructed an oscillator circuit along with a frequency counter circuit using commercially available op-amps, using which I have confirmed that the capacitive decay time constant of the cell is at a few microseconds, compared with photo-generated electrons which last for several hundred seconds (10^8 times longer). I will present my experiments and ideas to explain these observations. (b) As a control group, a batch of cells were dyed with water. It was discovered that photovoltaic effects are observed even with oxides dyed with only water, suggesting that surface sensitization does not need plant dyes (which are photo-biodegradable) or other synthetic dyes (which are expensive), with possibilities for new applications.

FOOD OR FUEL: IS COOKING OIL AN EFFECTIVE SUBSTITUTE FOR DIESEL FUEL?
Lauren Michelle Cardenas
Del Rio Freshman School, Del Rio, Texas, USA

The title of my project is “Food or Fuel: Is Cooking Oil an Effective Substitute for Diesel Fuel?” The purpose of my project is to determine if biodiesel fuel made from cooking oil is an effective substitute for diesel fuel. My hypothesis is that biodiesel can be used as an effective substitute for diesel fuel. I think it will have less emission, the same viscosity, fewer miles per gallon, and cost less.<br><br> For my procedure, I have two studies. In Study 1, I made biodiesel. First, I poured used cooking oil, power service additive, kerosene, and gasoline through a strainer in a large barrel. Then, I stirred the mixture and ran it through filters. In Study 2, I tested for the viscosity of the fuels. I found the viscosity by dropping a marble into a container filled with one of the fuels. I timed the marble’s course.<br><br> My hypothesis was mostly correct. I concluded that making the biodiesel actually costs less than buying a gallon of diesel fuel. According to my viscosity test, the biodiesel resulted in having a slightly higher viscosity than the regular diesel. I decided that my hypothesis was incorrect about miles per gallon. Actually, the biodiesel had more miles per gallon. After extensive research, I found that only huge metropolitan areas tested for emissions. Unfortunately, my town is not a huge metropolitan area. However, I did find on several Internet sites and books that biodiesel does give off less emissions than regular diesel fuel.<br><br>

BIOFUELS: OILY ALTERNATIVES?
Amanda Joy Rock
Wray High School, Wray, Colorado, USA

The purpose of this project was to determine whether oil variety had any impact on biodiesel quality, efficiency, and horsepower. The researcher hypothesized that oil variety would have little, if any, impact on biodiesel quality, efficiency, and horsepower. The researcher created biodiesel in a laboratory using canola, corn, peanut, and vegetable oils using the transesterification process. Three trials of each biodiesel were be made and transported to Wagner Equipment Company in Denver, Colorado for testing in the Scheduled Oil Sample (S.O.S.) laboratory. The biodiesel was be tested for appearance, PPT, sludge, water, centrifuge solids, sulfur content, specific (API) gravity, and metal content. The results showed that the API Gravities of the biodiesels were consistently lower than the petroleum diesel sample. The centrifuge solids of the biodiesel samples were moderately to considerably higher than industry standards but some samples were of the same quality as the petroleum diesel sample. Sulfur contents in the biodiesels were consistent, meeting industry standards for low sulfur fuel but not for ultra-low sulfur fuel. The appearance of all biodiesel samples and the petroleum samples were similar – clear and gold – and all samples were negative for visual evidence of water, sludge, or other visual sediment. The researcher concluded that the biodiesels had consistently higher horsepower, but overall quality suffered because of the lack of a filtering system. The researcher accepted the hypothesis that oil variety had little impact on biodiesel quality, efficiency, and horsepower because all results were similar regardless of the type of oil used. <br><br>

INVESTIGATION OF A LIGHTWEIGHT SOLAR STIRLING POWER SYSTEM FOR EARTH AND SPACE APPLICATIONS
Nathan Michael Tinker
Covenant Christian Academy, Huntsville, AL USA

The purpose of this project was to investigate a modified solar-powered Stirling engine fitted with a lightweight Fresnel concentrator and linear alternator, to generate electricity for lunar surface and earth applications. The thin Fresnel lens provides focused solar energy to heat the engine. Lightweight, reliable power system designs are needed for future space and portable earth-based applications.<br><br> The Stirling engine was adapted for generating electricity by installing a lightweight linear alternator. Magnets and lightweight coil designs were tested to discover the effects of magnet and coil parameters on electrical output. Fresnel lens performance was characterized to discover the effects of lens size, focal length, and groove geometry on energy collected. Full system tests in ambient sunlight were performed with the modified Stirling engine and concentrator assembly. <br><br> The lightweight Fresnel lenses were effective for heating the Stirling engine, and lens size was the dominant factor affecting concentrated energy. Output voltage increased linearly with increasing engine operating temperature, and repeated runs for each operating temperature (100°C, 150°C, and 200°C) with a 33.02 cm lens yielded consistent voltage outputs. The output voltage also increased with increasing magnet strength, and the Neodymium magnet had the most strength per unit weight, compared to ceramic magnets. Lightweight coil designs were also effective, and output voltage increased consistently for increasing coil length (number of winds).<br><br> The results achieved in this project indicate that the adapted solar Stirling system with lightweight Fresnel concentrator and lightweight alternator components shows considerable potential for future lunar missions and earth applications.<br><br>

WIND: THE NEW AUTOMOTIVE ENERGY
Oliver Scott Beard
Christian Academy of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky, United States of America 

<br><br> Starting with just crude materials, this experiment overcame all of the obstacles and all of the pessimism about the inefficiency and the increased drag and proved without a doubt that a wind turbine system mounted within an electric car can transform the forced wind energy of a moving vehicle into useable electric energy. Gathering data via voltages per ten kilometers per hour, the experiment placed a homemade wind turbine onto an automobile and introduced it to incremental speeds up to 120 kilometers per hour. Thus, the results confirmed this newly developed wind-to-electric system could truly generate enough electricity to regenerate the useless electric cars of today and revolutionize it into the car of tomorrow. Furthermore, the feasibility of such a car of tomorrow was made greater with data proving this system could provide the needed 220 volts for an electrically powered car at speeds run on federal highways. Yet, remember that this experiment demonstrated the clear possibility of a working wind-to-electric system with just parts found rusting in the trash. So, think about the possibilities this project has in the future with lighter, stronger turbine blades; larger, more powerful generators; and a beneficial variable pulley system for either slow daily commute or high speed road trips. The car of tomorrow, featuring this inexpensive wind-to-electric system, will rid the world of today’s car pollution, the hazard of exploding fuel cells, and the increased reliance on an ever-depleting, money-stealing oil supply. Truly, the future sees a cleaner, safer, and more optimistic tomorrow.

ETHANOL FROM CELLULOSE
Robert Edmund Steinbock
Saint Xavier High School, Louisville, Kentucky, United States

For commercial cellulosic ethanol production to be economically viable and efficient, ethanol yields need to be maximized. In achieving this goal, a cheap and readily available biomass with the highest ethanol yield per unit mass must be identified. The most efficient biomasses will maximize fermentable sugars derived from cellulose and hemicellulose and minimize the lignin framework. Therefore pine, a soft wood, should yield more ethanol than the hard woods sycamore and red oak per unit mass, and newspaper, a supple material, should yield more ethanol than printer paper, construction paper, and cardboard per unit mass.<br><br> Biomasses of uniform particle size were treated with an acetic acid-sodium acetate buffer of pH 5 and cellulase from Aspergillus Niger and Trichoderma. The hydrolyzed mixtures were filtered, neutralized, and inoculated with Zymomonas mobilis. Ethanol concentration of distillate was measured with an Anton Paar density meter, and yield per unit mass was calculated.<br><br> As hypothesized, pine yielded the most ethanol per unit mass among woods; however, construction paper yielded the most ethanol per unit mass among papers. Newspaper surprisingly yielded the least ethanol among paper biomasses, but this may be due to its unintentionally unsealed fermentation process. <br><br> Changes in pH after fermentation and hydrolysis correlate with ethanol yield and support a higher ethanol yield for newspaper. The buffer pH tended to decrease as ethanol yield increased. Because Zymomonas mobilis yields acetic acid in fermentation, the change in pH after fermentation tended to decrease with increased ethanol yield. More testing, however, is needed for conclusive results.<br><br>

EXPLORATION RESEARCH ON INTEGRATED METHANE AND BIO-HYDROGEN PRODUCTION DEVICE FROM WASTEWATER OF LIVESTOCK BREEDING FARM
Xiaoyu Yang
Zhengzhou Foreign Language School, Zhengzhou, Henan, China

In order to produce hydrogen from poultry breeding wastewater, a device and some experiments were designed in the laboratory. First, single factor and orthogonal tests were used to determine the optimum conditions of producing hydrogen by photosynthetic bacteria. The optimum conditions were found to be temperature of 30¡æ, pH 7.0, illumination intensity of 1600lux and the sewage density of 5687mg/L. Then, after referring to literature, consulting with experts, and analyzing and comparing with the current auxiliary heating cluster case type biogas system, the combination of bio-hydrogen production technology and the methane production technology from the poultry breeding wastewater was explored, and the device of bio-hydrogen production from wastewater with the existing methane production was made. It is concluded that the new system can produce hydrogen and methane simultaneously almost without providing any extra energy and substrate. Finally, the preliminary model device of integrated methane and bio-hydrogen production was designed, which paved the way for alleviating the energy crisis, and fully and rationally utilizing renewable resources.

CAN ETHANOL BE DERIVED FROM CROPS AND WEEDS BY FERMENTATION?
Zachary Ryan Molin
St. Joseph High School, Greenville, MS, USA

The objective of this project was to determine if ethanol could be produced from crops and weeds by the process of fermentation. Although corn grain is currently used to produce ethanol, there are many other types of grain and plant parts which also may be used. Alternative sources of fermentable plant materials may be useful to the ethanol industry.<br><br> Three different yeasts with thirteen different plant material sources from weeds and crops were tested. The fermentation of sucrose by the three yeasts was used to establish the conditions for the experiment. The release of carbon dioxide from the fermentation process was measured at 24 and 48 hours from the start of the experiment. The reaction was also tested at different temperatures to see how increased temperature would affect the process. <br><br> The results showed that crops and weeds could be used in fermentation to produce ethanol. The fermentation rate increased with increasing temperature. Higher temperatures should have been tested to determine the maximum rate for each of the yeast types. These results indicated that fermentation requires energy input to get the reaction going at a higher rate. Soybeans and corn were the crops that produced the most ethanol.<br><br> This project demonstrated that ethanol could be produced by fermentation of several crops and plant materials as well as from weeds. This means that there are several potential alternatives to corn grain for ethanol production if needed.<br><br>

Arnaldo Gabriel Monroig
Academia Nuestra Senora de La Providencia, San Juan, Puerto Rico.

There has been an increase on the pollution levels in the big cities of the world due to the discharge of toxic gases caused by the combustion of automobiles. Because of this activity and the capability of promoting sustainable development by generating less or no environmental damages, this research intends to create a new and improved catalytic converter.<br><br>The objective of the present work was to evaluate the present catalytic model. The engineering design used by this new catalytic model has the modality of four escape and one combination of pure and mixed metallic salts that serve as gas converters produced by the combustion of the fuel used by the engines of automobiles.<br><br>Several metallic nets made out of Gold, Silver, Nickel, Palladium, Rhodium and Platinum, were used to reinforce the traditional method of catalysis. This new catalyst, unlike the traditional catalysts, does not need to be preheated to activate by a fast starting; the reaction is instantaneous.Equally, the price of this new catalyst is of lower cost, more durable and has greater effect. <br><br> <br><br>After completing this research and the assemblage of this innovative method it was found that the catalytic converter causes the gases that result from combustion such as CO, HC, NOx, N2, O, turn to CO2, H2O, NOx, N2 and O2 which are less toxic and the NOx is treated by a fourth alternate escape route, lowering the catalytic temperature.<br><br>

OIL CRISIS? SAVONIUS AND HORIZONTAL AXIS TURBINE ELECTRIC POWERED CARS
Kristi Marie Williams
Mid Buchanan R-5, Faucett Missouri, USA

This project is a study to determine if electric powered cars, modified by the inclusion of Savonius and Horizontal axial turbines would produce sustainable, self-regenerative energy to provide an endless source of electricity, making the vehicle self-sufficient and independent of fossil fuels. A series of strategically placed electro-magnetic wind turbines (Savonius) and rotating turbines on axles generate electricity during vehicle movement to develop a self-sufficient vehicle. Brushless DC motors attached to various wind blades were tested for maximum efficiency. The Savonius turbines were then located in the engine compartment and on the rooftop. Horizontal axial turbines were developed by building custom rotors and mounts. Different gauge magnet wires were wound into coils and tested with even numbers of magnets spinning on the axial driven rotors, generating sustainable and renewable electricity. Original tests on each scale unit were with fully charged batteries to determine vehicle time and distance capabilities. Tests were repeated each time Savonius or Axial turbines were added to the unit with additional statistical data accumulated on amps drawn versus amps produced, length of travel time, and distance of travel. Statistical data summarized for the project indicates that thermodynamics involved with self-regenerating electric cars can minimized by utilizing simple, efficient, inexpensive turbines that produce 120% or greater of the electrical requirements. High technological rechargeable batteries without memory are not affected by constant charging during vehicle movement, furthering research opportunities to insure energy and economic independence for humankind through development of sustainable, self-regenerating electric vehicles.<br><br>

HEAT TO HYDROGEN: TESTING THE EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE ON BACTERIAL HYDROGEN PRODUCTION
Taras Dreszer
Georgianna Bruce Kirby Prep., Santa Cruz, CA, USA

Due to problems with petroleum-based fuels, hydrogen could be a possible replacement energy source. Since no practical way exists to get hydrogen gas without using other energy sources, this project investigates biological hydrogen production via anaerobic bacteria that break down organic waste into hydrogen gas. The purpose of this project was to find out if maintaining the bacteria at 30 degrees Celsius (optimal bacterial growth temperature) to increase growth and gas production could achieve a net gain in energy over growth at room temperature. Bacteria were fed blended cornstalk in a glass 250 ml flask. The apparatus was completely filled with water. Two conditions were tested, one at room temperature, and one incubated at 30 degrees Celsius. Bacteria (Clostridium acetobutylicum) were isolated by heat shocking, and cultivated in a sucrose and distilled water solution. Biogas was measured and estimates of hydrogen were made based on research. 16.2 ml of biogas was produced by the room temperature condition, and 20.6 ml of biogas was produced by the incubated condition, meaning that it would take far more energy to incubate the organic waste than would be gained. According to these results, not nearly enough hydrogen would be produced to power transportation through converting all of the cornstalk in the US. However, with certain improvements, this could become a practical energy source. Though the hypothesis was rejected and the project did not show that this energy source was a practical one, this method could still play a valuable role in replacing fossil fuels.

GENETIC MODIFICATION OF CLOSTRIDIUM THERMOCELLUM AND THERMOANAEROBACTERIUM SACCHAROLYTICUM FOR EFFICIENT CELLULOSE DEGRADATION AND ETHANOL PRODUCTION
Sujay Tyle
Pittsford Mendon High School, Pittsford, NY USA

Ethanol, as a renewable biofuel, is gaining a strong foothold globally due to its environmental, social and economic advantages. However, ethanol production currently uses an expensive and unsustainable agricultural raw material- corn. For ethanol to be a feasible alternative energy source, readily available raw material lignocelluloses should be used in an efficient one phase microbial conversion process – main focus of my research. <br><br>Dual microbial systems capable of producing ethanol, in single step co-culture process, include C. thermocellum, responsible for producing cellulase enzyme and metabolizing hexose, and T. saccharolyticum, responsible for metabolizing pentose. My investigations focused on genetically modifying, enhancing cellulase activity and combining microbes’ capabilities to increase ethanol production rate and yield.<br><br>C. thermocellum’s cellulase producing capabilities were tested on various cellulosics, demonstrating that a mixture of crystalline cellulose and hemicellulose supports higher cellulase yield. <br><br>An uncharacterized gene cluster of C. thermocellum, encoding five genes with significant cellulatic characteristics, was discovered and investigated. Gene 5, predicted to encode a potent enzyme, was cloned and verified. Protein expressed from the clone was tested on various cellulosic substrates, and demonstrated a high efficiency in degrading crystalline cellulose, classifying Gene 5 as a rare exo-enzyme: a significant finding. <br><br>Moreover, C. thermocellum and, T. saccharolyticum were attempted to be genetically modified. Being anaerobic both needed special conditions. C. thermocellum was unable to be transformed with the plasmid, pIKM1, but T. saccharolyticum was successful. Future work would include over-expressing cellulase enzymes such as Gene 5, and eliminating byproducts like lactates and acetates.<br><br>

LOW ASPECT RATIO ROTOR BLADES FOR APPLICATION TO HELICOPTER NOISE REDUCTION
Andrew Donald Durkee
York School, Monterey California, USA

The purpose of this project is to determine if the noise produced by helicopter rotor blades can be reduced by using low aspect ratio rotor blades with winglets. It was hypothesized that low aspect ratio rotor blades with winglets would produce less noise than that of high aspect ratio rotor blades. Further it was hypothesized that the 5:1 aspect ratio rotor blade would be the quietest and that a slight upward trend would be observed in the 2:1 aspect ratio rotor blade. In order to test this hypothesis, a test chamber was built that would spin polyurethane foam rotor blades in a circle. The test used a sound level meter to measure the sound level and a photogate to measure the rotational speed of the rotors. A lift equation and several assumptions based on basic wing theory were used to calculate the relative noise level of each rotor size. After testing, it was shown that the 10:1 aspect ratio rotor was quietest with a source sound level of 46.5 Db. The 2:1 aspect ratio rotor was the loudest with a source sound level of 52.9 Db. It was concluded that the general hypothesis was correct in that low aspect ratio rotor blades can be quieter than high aspect ratio rotor blades, and that as the aspect ratio gets very low the rotor blade starts to get louder. It was also noted that the specific hypothesis was wrong in that the 10:1 aspect ratio rotor blade was quieter, not the 5:1.

STUDY ON STABILITY DEVICE OF UNMANNED RADIO CONTROL HELICOPTER IN CHANGING FLIGHT ATTITUDE (PITCH AND ROLL)
Zhen Bao
The High School Affiliated to The RenMin University of China,Beijing,China

Unmanned helicopter is a kind of aerial robot in the sky. However, it is difficult to operate the unmanned helicopter remotely. In order to simplify the operation, I inputted Zero-signal into the feed back circulation of original 'co-pilot CPD4'. And use them as a standalone closed control system. Now, the purpose of this standalone closed control system is to keep the helicopter into horizon. Then, I want it to follow the attitude signal which is send from operator automatically. I design and make a two axes mechanical radio control attitude setting system ,this mechanical system can set an angle between the infra-red attitude detect sensor and the main rotor. Two systems worked together (closed control system & attitude signal setting system) in order to form a novel flight attitude control system, this system can control and Stabilize the flight attitude automatically according to the attitude signal that I send to it. So control the attitude of RC helicopter with this system (Device) is just like taking it with your hands.(with the original control system, operator can just control the attitude movement. But with this device, operator can use transmitter to set a attitude signal, the attitude movement of helicopter will be controlled by this device automatically).<br><br> After many practice I realized, the attitude control systems are similar in many aircrafts, so it can be used in Stabilizing pitch and roll for almost any R/C aircraft.<br><br>

MAGLEV ASSISTED ROCKET LAUNCH PROPELLED BY A HALL-EFFECT LINEAR ACCELERATOR
Adam Matthew Fuhrmann
Heritage High School, Leesburg VA, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine if a maglev rocket vehicle propelled by a Hall-Effect linear accelerator could increase a rocket’s launch energy by a significant amount. This concept was tested by constructing a scale model acceleration track with magnetically propelled rocket vehicle. Originally a maglev track was to be used for testing; however, without means of electrodynamic stabilization, achieving a stable magnetic levitation was impossible on this small scale. Instead, a conventional train track was used. A stationary rocket launch was used for the control values and the launch with acceleration track augmentation was the experimental. Testing the motor track without firing the rocket was also conducted in order to focus on the linear motor’s operation. Each of the tests were recorded with a camera and were analyzed frame-by-frame to extrapolate parameters such as velocity, acceleration, force, work, power and kinetic energy. A comparison was made between the kinetic energy of the conventional rocket launch and the energy after using the acceleration track. The results show that motor increased the launch energy by an average of 4%. However, the results are inconclusive due to factors such as the unexpected weight of the vehicle as well as the weakness of the motor’s electromagnet. The data showed that a majority of the motor’s work went into the vehicle’s energy as opposed to the rocket’s. By increasing the power of the electromagnet and cutting down on the vehicle’s weight further testing would most likely show a larger increase in efficiency.

FROM FRIES TO BIODIESEL
Ethan Daniel Erickson
West Central Valley High School, Stuart IA, USA

With the rising cost of diesel, the demand to find a cheaper way to produce biodiesel has increased. Used cooking oil bio-diesel has become more popular because fast food restaurants just throw the cooking oil away. Making biodiesel with it is a better alternative. Even the by-product, glycerin, has many uses. The purpose of this experiment is to find if bio-diesel can be made from used cooking oil, gel temps, yields, and test it in a vehicle. It is hypothesized that biodiesel can be made and will be more cost effective to make than regular diesel. The Procedure includes first, filtering the oil. Then, remove all the water. Next, find out how much lye is needed, by titration, to transesterfy the oil. Prepare the sodium methoxide. Then, heat the oil and mix in the methoxide. Now, allow the oil and glycerin to separate for eight hours. Finally, wash the biodiesel and heat it to remove water. The biodiesel had an average crystallization point of 15.5 degrees C, and an average gel point of -2 degrees C. The yield of the third batch had the highest yield of 73%. The cooking oil biodiesel would perform well in warm temperatures that do no go below 3 degrees C. If the temperature goes below that, then, the biodiesel will gel up. The biodiesel has a very high yield when enough lye is added to react all of the cooking oil. This project would apply to anyone that has equipment that runs on diesel.

IMPROVEMENT OF A SINGLE-CHAMBER MICROBIAL FUEL CELL UTILIZING A NOVEL CONCEPT FOR A HYDROPHOBIC COATING AT THE CATHODE AND THE INCORPORATION OF GRAPHITE GRANULES AT THE ANODE
Sikandar Singh Porter-Gill
Gaithersburg High School Gaithersburg, MD, U.S.A

Microbial Fuel Cells (MFC) are a rapidly evolving field of alternative fuel research due to the rising cost of energy and the threat of global warming. MFCs have widespread potential in transportation, as battery substitution for remote areas, and as a source of power to homes and industry. MFCs generate electricity from the oxidation of organic matter by anaerobic microorganisms. This reaction generates electrons that travel to the anode, generating a voltage that can drive current through a load, producing power. My research uses wastewater as the source of microorganisms and the energy source for the reaction, demonstrating the potential for environmentally beneficial power generation.<br><br>For this project, I designed and built a new Vertical Single Chamber Microbial Fuel Cell (V-SC-MFC), incorporating graphite granules at the anode. This design produces no-load voltage equivalent to carbon cloth used in most conventional two-chamber MFC's. This novel V-SC-MFC shows an increase of 17% power density to the previous two-chamber design. <br><br> <br><br>Using Nafion-117®, a proton conducting membrane at the cathode, yields a two-fold increase in no-load voltage compared to other membranes tested. The hydrophobic coating, 502-IBA, is a fluoroaliphatic polymer that gave equivalent power to the more expensive and labor-intensive PTFE fluoropolymer that is used presently.<br><br> <br><br>This research demonstrates new technologies that can significantly improve the power output and reduce the price of a wastewater fueled MFC. These advances may lead to a commercial application of this form of alternative fuel that could benefit society.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF CARBON DIOXIDE ENRICHMENT ON THE GROWTH OF CHLORELLA
Scott Edward Potter
Carbon High School, Price Utah, United States of America

This study was done to determine if carbon dioxide enrichment would increase the growth of the algae chlorella and also determine the degree to which algae growth would increase. To test this idea the carbon dioxide concentration of flasks containing chlorella and growth media was increased. The carbon dioxide concentrations of the flasks in the three trials ranged from 0 milliliters to 27.5 milliliters of additional carbon dioxide. The suspensions were then grown for seven days under fluorescent lights. Cell counts of the beginning and end cell concentrations of each flask were taken after the growth period using a standard microscopic counting chamber. The results from this experiment show an overall trend of increased growth along with increased carbon dioxide concentration. There are however many factors and uncontrolled variables that must be considered before any concise conclusion can be made. Continued work must still be done to show the effect of carbon dioxide enrichment on chlorella.

SOL-TILE: THE POWER OF GREEN MODELLING DYE-SENSITIZED SOLAR CELLS TO DEVELOP A SOLAR ROOFING TILE
David Anthony Joseph Castelino
St. Aloysius Gonzaga Secondary School, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada

Depletion of non-renewable resources and rising demands for energy stresses the importance of non-toxic and renewable bio-sources of electricity. The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) reveals the capability in utilizing chemical dyes to replace silicon in crystalline solar cells. DSSCs, invented by Michael Grätzel, incorporates a combination of (N719) dye-sensitized nano-crystalline titanium dioxide film, iodine electrolyte solution and carbon-counter electrode, situated between two conductive glass plates. However, the high cost and minimum efficiency of these solar cells are limiting factors that prevent these solar cells from becoming a major sustainable bio-resource.<br><br>This project focuses on maximizing the efficiency and stability of a DSSC that utilizes naturally occurring organic extracts. Techniques and materials used to optimize efficiency of the DSSC were analyzed and used to design an efficient and cost-effective solar material. Organic anthocyanin and chlorophyll pigments contain porphyrin rings which, when exposed to light, provide excited electrons for photosynthesis. These pigments were extracted and utilized as a replacement for toxic N719 synthesized chemical dye in the DSSCs.<br><br>Forty-two organic solar cell prototypes were constructed and tested with a voltmeter under various incandescent light sources. Photon-to-voltage efficiencies were calculated for the prototypes, yielding average efficiencies of 14%.<br><br>Various materials and procedural techniques that were found to maximize efficiency were incorporated to successfully design a solar tile material utilizing organic dyes. This unique and cost-effective solar tile integrates the natural process of photosynthesis to efficiently produce electrical energy, as an affordable alternate to silicon solar cells.<br><br>

AQUA-FLIGHT
Steven Adam Gasior
St. Joseph Secondary, Mississauga Ontario, Canada

Aqua-Flight is a reconnaissance vehicle that possesses the capability of both aerial flight and underwater travel. This can provide users with a tool to acquire real time data of marine environments from a remote location. To accomplish aerial flight, the vehicle utilizes a tilting propeller to duct air under the wings’ middle section, providing the initial lift and to decrease surface water tension and hydrodynamic drag. This unique thrust vectoring action provides the necessary force to move the vehicle forward and above water. Tests have demonstrated a larger lift to drag ratio, enabling the Aqua-Flight to gain altitude at low ground speeds. Once airborne, the vehicle uses ground effects to gain air speed. A full payload is projected to be 7lbs, allowing a variety of sensors to be mounted. Aqua-Flight is equipped with dual wing tip rudders, providing lateral stability and control while in flight and during submerged travel. Testing demonstrated more torque was obtained using both wing-tip rudders at low airspeeds than conventional tail rudders. This is critical to properly pilot the vehicle. When submersed, the wingtip rudders rotate 90 degrees, parallel to the wings, and provide underwater stability and control. Aqua-Flight descends and ascends at a minimum 5-degree angle to obtain forward motion without the use of mechanical propulsion thus allowing for an energy efficient means of travel. While submerged, Aqua-Flight could analyse depths and collect data before regaining flight to return to the operator.

THE NERDY TREE: ADAPTING TREE MORPHOLOGY FOR PHOTOVOLTAIC PANEL ARRANGEMENT
Eden W. Full
John G. Diefenbaker High School, Calgary, Alberta, Canada

The Nerdy Tree utilizes nature as an adaptive model for designing an effective photovoltaic panel arrangement to collect optimum levels of solar radiation, with applications in alternative energy. Although widely used, conventional photovoltaic solar panel arrangements are significantly inefficient, consisting of a motorized single-panel system tracking the sun at perpendicular angles. To overcome this problem, The Nerdy Tree arranges photovoltaic panels in a stationary manner, minimizing energy self-consumption. The arrangement is thus based on the morphology of white spruce (Picea glauca) coniferous trees. In ideal environmental conditions with direct exposure to solar radiation, the white spruce species is an appropriate test genus due to its upwardly-angled branches, which are arranged to capture an optimal percentage of incident solar energy by gibberellin-auxin hormone interaction. Phenotypes ideal in appearance with consistent exposure to solar radiation were selected for morphological analysis, with a study focus on branch angles and needle location. Results from the phenotype analysis were implemented into the structural design of The Nerdy Tree to determine ideal angles and locations of photovoltaic panel placement. During 6-hour exposure periods, a scale system was tested in comparison to a motorized single-panel system under ideal outdoor conditions. Results indicated a mean increase of 268% in electrical output over a motorized single-panel system with equivalent surface area and theoretical power. Therefore, The Nerdy Tree is capable of increasing the performance of current photovoltaic panel technology by decreasing construction and maintenance costs, and increasing electrical efficiency in sustainable development.

MAXIMIZING WIND POWER: CONSIDERING THE EFFECTS OF SOLIDITY AND WING SHAPE ON THE PERFORMANCE OF A VERTICAL AXIS WIND TURBINE
Parker Prescott Owan
Home School, Tucson, Arizona, U.S.A.

Conceptually, wind power as a viable source of renewable and sustainable energy is gaining renown and offers a solution to the current power demand epidemic throughout the world. Nonetheless, only 0.7% of the power produced in the United States comes from wind. One way to increase that percentage is to make wind machines efficient and practically available. Therefore, this experiment tested the effects of lift and drag blade designs for a vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT).<br><br> The theoretical application of a wind turbine generating electricity for a home requires the machine to increase power output with increasing wind velocity and have high efficiency. My drag-based turbine created high starting torque combined with a low starting speed (7 mph), but efficiency was less than that of the lift-type design. The lift-turbine had a higher effectiveness because the blade velocity began accelerating past the wind velocity above 15 mph; however, the starting speed was higher (9-12 mph). Overall, the lift-based machine’s performance was more desirable than the drag device’s due to the lift apparatus’s ability to capture more power at higher wind speeds.<br><br> The impact of these findings is tremendous if one can find a method of combining the low startup speed and high torque benefits from the drag based system with the improved efficiency benefits of the lift-based system. The resulting wind turbine would capture the most energy possible over the wide range of wind characteristics visible at my home, which represents most residences.

The purpose of this project is to find another source of alternative fuel or ethanol by using coconut sap. This is the first ever techniques introduce for coconut sap to be made as an alternative source of fuel. Furthermore, coconut sap is obviously cheaper than petroleum. <br><br> <br><br>1 liter of coconut sap was fermented for four days in a closed container at room temperature. Each day, 200ml of coconut sap is taken from the closed container then have been distilled. Only one sample is distilled for each day. The process of distillation is conducted by using Rotavapor. All samples were distilled at 175 vacuum (mbar) for bp at 40 degree Celsius to ensure that the distillation product is the ethanol.<br><br>Based on the data collected, the ethanol produced by the coconut sap is increase starts from day zero until day three, and then decrease at day four. Fermented coconut sap produce the highest rate of ethanol at day three, which is 37% of ethanol is produced.<br><br>Coconut tree is the non-season plant. So, it will always produce the sap throughout the season although in bad weather. As a result, we can ensure the supply of the coconut sap for the industry in producing of ethanol from the coconut.<br><br>

GOT GAS? HYDROGEN PRODUCTION USING MICROBES
Cody Ray Campbell
Imlay City High School, Imlay City, MI, United States

This project focuses on using waste products to produce hydrogen gas. Milk was mixed with anaerobic sludge from the waste water treatment plant and then sealed in an apparatus to encourage hydrogen production. The hydrogen gas was collected in a Mylar balloon connected to the apparatus. The purpose is to inexpensively produce mass quantities of hydrogen for fuel.<br><br> This experiment uses Clostridium strain bacteria to break down sugar, and in doing so releases hydrogen. The bacteria break down the sugar in the milk and produce gas which collects in the Mylar balloon. Composition of the gas collected was determined by using the gas to power a miniature fuel cell car. <br><br> The first apparatus failed to collect gas. The second apparatus produced 0.5 ft^3 of gas in 15 hours. Once tested, 3 ml of gas caused the miniature fuel cell car to move 25" (63.5 cm). Calculations show there were 1679 Joules of energy in the gas collected in the balloon. This amount of energy is enough to power a 1000 watt electric heater for 1.7 seconds or move a 3000 pound car with the same properties as the miniature car 0.76 meters on a flat surface.<br><br> This project is a step toward more inexpensive and environmentally friendly fuel sources. This process is a good option because it is using substances we dispose of everyday to make one of the most promising new fuel sources.

THE EFFECTS OF LEADING-EDGE SINUSOIDAL TUBERCLES ON WING PERFORMANCE
Gabriel James Plano
Sleepy Hollow High School, Sleepy Hollow, New York

The purpose of this experiment is to determine if bumps on the leading edge of a wing can increase its coefficient of lift or decrease its coefficient of drag at any angles of attack. Angle of attack is the angle between a wing and the flow of air around it. Two models were fabricated out of foam and epoxy and tested in a wind tunnel. One model has a straight leading edge and the other has sinusoidal bumps on its leading edge. These bumps decrease in amplitude toward the tip of the wing. The forces of lift and drag on both models were measured in a wind tunnel at angles of attack from zero to eighteen degrees.<br><br> The scalloped model had a lower drag coefficient than that of the straight model at angles of attack from four to eighteen degrees, and its drag coefficient was on average 14.8% lower. The scalloped model's lift coefficient was greater at all angles except 16 degrees, and its lift coefficient was on average 20.9% higher. Also, the decrease in lift after stall for the scalloped model was much less sudden than it was for the straight model. The aerodynamic efficiency, or lift divided by drag, of the scalloped model was greater at all angles of attack. The applications of this data are that an airplane with scalloped wings would have greater fuel efficiency, longer range, the ability to maintain lower speeds during takeoff and landing, and the ability to recover from stall more quickly.<br><br>

IT'S A WONDERFUL LIGHT: AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF A FLUORESCENT SOLAR CONCENTRATOR
Bryce William Cronkite-Ratcliff
Crystal Springs Uplands School, Hillsborough, California, USA

This project examines the viability of one alternative form of solar concentration, the Fluorescent Solar Concentrator (FSC), as a more efficient and inexpensive method of photovoltaic (PV) solar power production. The potential advantages of this concentrator system are many, including decreased cost per unit energy output, small dependence on the angle with respect to the sun, and reduced heat dispersion problems in silicon (Si) PV solar cells.<br><br> I constructed a FSC by coupling a Si PV cell to the edge of each of various sheets of fluorescent acrylic. I conducted several experiments to examine the effect of different dyes, thicknesses, geometrical configurations, and other factors on the power output of the FSC system. I compared the data with a mathematical model, which was used to explore extrapolations of the FSC in geometry and dye performance. Finally, I examined the economic feasibility of the FSC using extrapolations of the model. I also conducted experiments to compare the photovoltaic power generation of the FSC with two geometrical optics concentration methods (a mirror array and a Winston cone).<br><br> In comparing the FSC with other concentrators, the FSC is found to be a superior concentrator for Si PV cells. The FSC used in this project achieved concentration factors of 4 and material costs about ½-2/3 compared to a conventional bare Si PV cell system. With better dyes and improved plate mediums, the cost-benefit ratio could become much more favorable, allowing the FSC to become an important technology for a future of renewable energy.<br><br>

My science fair project is about combining crude glycerin, a natural by-product of biodiesel, with natural biomasses to observe the effect of the crude glycerin on the materials when burned. I hypothesized that glycerin would have a positive effect on the biomasses by allowing them to burn longer. I also hypothesized that I would be able to create burnable blocks by mixing my materials.<br><br>I conducted my experiment by chopping up the biomasses, adding set amounts of crude glycerin and mixing them together. I then placed the mixtures into molds that I made and allowed them to compact and dry. I decided to also create amalgamation blocks by combining each of the different biomasses together with crude glycerin. The blocks were burned under a fume hood with 20 mL of water placed above the burning material. I recorded the highest temperature the water rose, and figured approximately the calories produced. I also recorded percent of matter decrease and the length of the burn. The biomasses were also burned without crude glycerin for the control group.<br><br>When recording my observations and looking at my graphs, I saw a dramatic increase in the initial mass and length of burn produced when the biomasses were combined with glycerin. I concluded that the biomasses combine well with crude glycerin and, when burned, produce more heat. I believe, in the future, we will have excessive amounts of crude glycerin, and it can be used as an alternative heat source.<br><br>

COMPARING VERTICAL-AXIS AND HORIZONTAL-AXIS WIND TURBINES
Nicolas A Aguilar
Solon HS, Solon, Iowa, U.S.

Wind turbines, representing two distinct turbine categories, and a universal generator, were built to compare horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWT) with vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT) for small-scale applications or residential use. The output of the generator for each turbine was measured in RPM by a tachometer and by measuring power delivered to a load, with load resistance chosen to maximize power on the I-V curve. To compare turbines, results were normalized with respect to the swept area of each turbine, and efficiencies were calculated. Higher efficiencies were attained by the VAWT in steady wind conditions. In small-scale, residential use, wind turbines often have limited tower height and nearby trees or buildings, creating winds with inconsistent speed and direction. To measure the effect of turbulent winds, the turbines were driven by wind from five different directions using probable shifts to estimate gust efficiencies. VAWT turbines again were more efficient than HAWT. This is likely because VAWT accept omni-directional wind. In conclusion, my experiment suggests that for homeowners VAWT are a better renewable alternative than HAWT because they are more efficient and operate omni-directionally.

CYANOBACTERIAL FUEL CELLS: CONVERSION OF LIGHT ENERGY INTO ELECTRICITY BY COUPLING PHOTOSYNTHETIC CO2 SEQUESTRATION WITH RESPIRATION IN A FUEL CELL
Kartik Madiraju
Marianopolis College, Montreal, Quebec, CANADA

In the wake of the energy crisis and global warming, it has become necessary to find non-toxic, efficient, and renewable alternative energy resources as well as efficient methods of carbon dioxide sequestration. This is because non-renewable resources such as oil are being consumed at an alarming rate, releasing carbon dioxide, one of the leading contributors to the Greenhouse Gas Effect. Research towards an ideal energy resource has led to the development of various power generators including Aeolian, hydro, nuclear, and biomass. However, though renewable, these are either inefficient (wind power), or very hazardous (nuclear energy). As yet, few carbon dioxide sequestration methods have been developed significantly. <br><br> Bacteria have been used to produce electricity in my previous projects. The objective of this project was to produce electricity and simultaneously sequester CO2 by coupling photosynthesis with respiration using a cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC6803 in a fuel cell. <br><br> The data obtained revealed that for electricity production, the optimum cell concentration was 3x10^9 cells/ml and the optimal light intensity was 10000 lux. Electricity production in complete darkness was ~4-fold lower than that in the presence of light, indicating the dependency of power output on photosynthesis.<br><br> The maximum power attained was 0.4 microwatts, which sustained for 24 h with concomitant sequestration of 0.14 micromoles CO2. <br><br> This technology has the potential to simultaneously address the Energy Crisis and the Greenhouse Gas Effect with applications on a large scale as a renewable energy source and as a method of cost-effective CO2 sequestration, without polluting our environment. <br><br>

BIODIESEL FUEL FROM SURF DIATOMS
Ashiyah Melyne Cays Vesterby
Sequim Senior High School Sequim, WA United States

High fuel prices and concerns about depletion of the world's non-renewable resources has prompted researchers to seek new alternatives to traditional petroleum fuels. A potential alternative is biodiesel. Biodiesel is the result of plant oils mixed with alcohol and a catalyst in a chemical reaction known as esterification. Surf diatoms were examined in the 1930's as a potential source of biodiesel oil, but studies were abandoned as petroleum based diesel fuel was, at that time, less expensive. The goals of this research project included extraction and esterification of surf diatom oils into biodiesel fuel, and construction of culture containers with passive light systems to economically grow surf diatoms at depths below 1 meter in the water column. Surf diatoms were collected from the Strait of Juan de Fuca using a phytoplankton net. Diatom oil was esterified using a procedure modified from Lewis et al (2000). Resulting fatty acid methyl esters were identified with a GC/MS. Results show variations in biodiesel composition depending upon the collection date and diatom assemblage. Saturated fatty acids were more plentiful than unsaturated fatty acids (as compared to traditional biodiesel oils) and contain more fuel energy. A culture chamber with a passive light transport system was designed and constructed in which to grow diatoms one meter down in the water column. The chamber was inoculated with diatoms and placed within a fish farm for two weeks. Culture chamber contents were then evaluated.<br><br>

DO ROTATING CYLINDERS CREATE LIFT? IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MAGNUS EFFECT IN WING DESIGN
Matthew Clark Searle
Olympus Senior High School, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate that rotating cylinders can generate lift as predicted by mathematical models and explore applications of rotating cylinders in wing design. The primary hypothesis was that a rotating cylinder will generate lift in an air stream. The secondary hypothesis was that the addition of a rotating cylinder to an airfoil will increase the airfoils ability to create lift. <br><br>The project consisted of building a wind tunnel, a rotating cylinder, and airfoils. Lift created by the cylinder was initially measured by the change in height between rotation and non-rotation in a constant air stream. A cylinder and airfoil were combined to create a prototype wing. This prototype was inverted in the wind tunnel and downward lift was measured on a scale with and without cylinder rotation. The rotating cylinder rose 1-2 cm and the stationary cylinder had no change in position. The stationary cylinder/airfoil generated an average lift of .289 N in the presence of a 215 mph wind stream. The rotating cylinder/airfoil generated an average lift of .333 N. <br><br>The primary hypothesis was correct. A rotating cylinder in an air stream generates lift. The secondary hypothesis was also proven. The incorporation of a rotating cylinder in an airfoil increased lift. On average, the rotating cylinder/airfoil generated .04 more Newtons of lift than the non-rotating cylinder/airfoil. The combination of a rotating cylinder and an airfoil may lead to development of a wing with increased lift efficiency and overall lowered threshold velocity for flight. <br><br>

ONE WING, THREE SHAPES CAN CHANGING WING SHAPE (CAMBER) IN FLIGHT INCREASE EFFICIENCY
Mathew Tyler Robison
Muskogee High School, Muskogee, Oklahoma, U.S.A.

One Wing, Three Shapes<br><br>Matt Robison<br><br>Muskogee High School, Muskogee, Oklahoma<br><br> Can a wing be made that could change shape during flight and achieve the better efficiency for each aspect of flight? This type of plane would reduce atmospheric pollution, transportation expense and improve utility. My hypothesis: one wing can perform multiple tasks by changing shape (camber) during flight. <br><br> I built an air foil that would be able to morph into different shapes. I developed several skins that would be stretchable to accommodate the different airfoil cambers but could still maintain some rigidity to avoid shape change under stress. One for testing purpose was applied. I cut strips of plastic and attached these to the wing surface to demonstrate the air flow over the wing. I fashioned a wind source to test the wing in three different cambers and recorded the data. I measured each wing shape for chord length, thickness, mean camber line and measured camber. Visible efficiency and Drag were observed. Lift was computed. I tested three different cambers of the airfoil, Fast wing: Camber: -0.25, Lift: - 31lbs. Combo wing: Camber: 0.1875, Lift +23 lbs Lifting wing: Camber: 0.25, Lift +31 lbs.<br><br> My experiment demonstrates a dynamic wing built on the basis of variable camber could be a huge asset in the reduction of atmospheric pollution as well as cost efficient by expanding the utility of each vehicle. Layered metal, fabric, nano technology or a combination will determine the viability of this project. <br><br>

"POLICE DEPARTMENT CAN ALSO USE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY VEHICLES": DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW GENERATION OF HIGHWAY PATROLS.
Michael Gabriel Rodriguez
Jose Gautier Benitez High School, Caguas, Puerto Rico

Highway police officers are a specialized team created primarily for the purpose of overseeing and introducing traffic safety compliance on roads and highways. Their mission is to reduce collisions and make the highways as safe as possible. They drive from one side of the highway to the other one enforcing the rules of the road.<br><br> The purpose of this investigation was to design a completely new highway patrol powered by electric energy. The idea of integrating alternative energy to drive the highway patrol arises mainly for the necessity of reducing contamination and the dependence of petroleum. To make the prototype, SolidWorks 3D software was used to design all this new invention. After months of work the prototype of a new generation of highway patrols is now presented.<br><br> The D-One is a new highway patrol with a great futuristic design; it is lighter than conventional police cars and is environmentally friendly because it will be powered by electric energy. To extend the running time of this vehicle, a custom charging system was added. The BCEI System is a new technology that was developed to recharge a section of the batteries using the rotation of the rear tires. To increase the safety level of this vehicle, a custom seat belt was designed and some other security elements were added around the car body to protect the life of the police officers in case of an accident. Excellent aerodynamic features are the last characteristic of this amazing highway patrol.<br><br>

THE DEVELOPMENT OF A LOCALIZED FINITE DIFFERENCING COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS PROGRAM
Robert M. Parrish
Chamberlain High School, Tampa, Florida, USA

The purpose of this project was to develop an in-house Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) program that used unstructured Delaunay meshing and the localized finite differencing method to accurately predict fluid flow around arbitrary objects. The CFD algorithm evaluated the impulse of each element on its neighbors due to static and dynamic pressure. The overall flow characteristics were found by integrating many impulses evaluated over short timesteps. Results from the CFD were compared to wind tunnel tests of pressure, velocity, and aerodynamic force acting on a NACA 4407 airfoil.<br><br> <br><br>A wind tunnel with interchangeable test sections was built to allow collection of flow direction, pressure, and aerodynamic force measurements using telltales and smoke streamlines, a U-tube manometer, and a balance system. Pressure and flow direction values were processed with a Wind Tunnel Visualization program coded by the researcher for the purpose of providing comparable graphical results to the CFD. Aerodynamic force values were converted to scaled lift and drag coefficients and compared to values predicted by the CFD.<br><br> <br><br>Pressure and velocity fields predicted by the CFD were found to be highly comparable to real world wind tunnel data, especially at or below 15 degrees Angle Of Attack (AOA). Aerodynamic force values in the CFD and wind tunnel showed similar trends, but CFD results diverged at high AOA due to a lack of consideration of viscosity and turbulence in the solving algorithm. The CFD demonstrates the potential benefit of the localized finite differencing method, with provision for enhanced distribution equations and 3D flow solving. <br><br>

SHOWER DRAIN WATER HEAT RECOVERY THROUGH SUBMERSIVE HEAT EXCHANGER
Alexander Fung
De La Salle High School, Concord California, United States of America

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the practicality of using warm shower drain water to preheat the cold water supply through a submersive heat exchanger, thereby reducing the amount of hot water needed and thus saving energy. All tests involved simulating the conditions of a 40°C and 9.5 liters/min (2.5 gallons/min) shower. Three heat exchangers were built:<br><br> 1) An externally wrapped model utilizing a copper line wrapped around a metal P-trap: The warmed water output was routed to the shower cold water inlet. An energy savings of 3.6% was achieved. This represents an annual cost savings of $5.10 for a typical family (assuming four 8-minute showers per day and natural gas price of $1.3418 per therm). <br><br> 2) A submersive model utilizing a straight copper line submerged in warm shower drain water in an acrylic box: The warmed water output was routed to the shower cold water inlet. An energy savings of 7.5% and an annual cost savings of $10.65 were achieved.<br><br> 3) A submersive model utilizing a coiled copper line: Three tests were conducted by routing the warmed water output to the shower cold water inlet and/or the water heater. The best test yielded an energy savings of 17.1% and an annual cost savings of $23.60.<br><br> My experiment has shown that a significant amount of energy can be recovered from the shower drain water. Future models should aim for higher efficiencies by using tighter copper coiling and concentrators to channel drain water to maximize heat transfer.<br><br>

FREE ENERGY IN YOUR OWN BACK YARD, PT. 2
Brian Joseph Sutterer
Terre Haute North Vigo High School, Terre Haute, Indiana, United States 

My goals in this year’s project were to run a Stirling Engine off of the heat transferred up through the ground for an extended period of time, as well as to construct an electrical generation system for the engine and measure its output. I first constructed a modified version of last year’s heat transfer system, changing the pipe diameter to 6”. I then constructed a box with a removable lid that sits partially in the ground and surrounds the pipe at the top, as well as provides protection from the weather. I then constructed the electrical generation system using a series of magnets attached to the flywheel of the engine and mounted wire coils. To test the output of the generator I used a light bulb with a rheostat attached to it as the heat source, adjusting the rheostat to get the desired temperature difference for the engine. I ran tests with a temperature difference of 4 degrees Celsius, 5 degrees, and so on, up through 15 degrees. I measured the voltage output for each test, and then used that data to calculate other aspects of the system. Overall I was successful in getting the engine to run off of the transferred heat from the ground. The average current produced by the generator was about .5mA, average peak voltage was about .22V, and the average power was about .07mW. These numbers may seem useless, but the entire system can be added to, e.g. more coils and stronger magnets.

AIRFOIL EFFICIENCY AS DETERMINED BY CAMBER
Justin Alexander Spahn
Deer Valley High School, Antioch, CA, USA

Through experimentation I attempted to understand how the aerodynamic performance of wings is affected by changes made in wing curvature. The measure of a wing’s curvature is called camber, and in laymen’s terms is determined by the maximum distance from the top (dorsal) surface of the wing to the bottom (ventral) surface. I created three small airfoil (or wing cross-section) models using balsa wood, keeping all variables but camber constant. Each wing was made with an arbitrary camber ratio, with one being relatively larger than the rest, one relatively smaller, and one in between. Each wing was tested for ten seconds in a well designed home-made wind tunnel at approximately 9.5 km/hr. with a calibrated force sensor. The wing of smallest camber produced the greatest average lift, the wing of greatest camber produced negative lift, and the wing of medium camber produced a lift reading in between those of the other two. Based on this data, it can be concluded that wings of relatively small camber ratio have a greater lift capacity than wings with larger ratios, and wings with too great a ratio do not have a lift capacity.

CATALITIC CONVERSION OF GLYCERIN INTO SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS USING PRESSURIZED THERMAL REACTION
Rodgrick G Hickman
Noxubee County High School, Macon Mississippi, United States

In recent years, scientists have given a vast amount of attention to bio-diesel fuel (BDF) as an alternative fuel. It has been reported that for every 100 gallons of BDF produced there is 10 gallons of glycerin produced. However, as the production of BDF increases, an effective and acceptable conversion of glycerin must be produced. Glycerin has been a very useful product in items such as cosmetics. But, with BDF as a future alternative fuel, one must consider that the increase production of BDF is inversely proportional to the dollar value of glycerin. Therefore, this project’s purpose was to evaluate an effective and acceptable use for glycerin by the catalytic conversion of glycerin into sustainable products using pressurized thermal reaction with variances in the alkaline catalyst and the temperature. <br><br> The reactor used in this study was a Parr Series 4575 High Pressure/High Temperature Reactor.<br><br> The results for liquid samples after reaction of glycerin at varying temperatures of 300°C, 325°C, 350°C and 375°C for a reaction time of 60 minutes with 0.1 g, 0.2 g, 0.3 g, and 0.4 g NaOH, control, 0.0 g NaOH were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. This study reported the yield of lactic acid when treated by an alkaline pressurized thermal treatment of glycerin as directly proportional to the amount of NaOH added. This study also reported an unidentified peak, using a Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry an unidentified peak resulted with a 91% probability in favor of propylene glycol.<br><br>

EFFECTS OF RENEWABLE GASOLINE EXTENDERS ON FUEL LINE
Melissa Renee Snow
Patrician Academy, Butler, Alabama, USA

This project is to determine the effect renewable gasoline extenders have on the flexibility of fuel line in an engine. It is hypothesized that methanol, ethanol, and turpentine will most adversely affect the flexibility of fuel line.<br><br> Test sample racks were constructed first, then a beam balance tester was built. 120 tubing samples were cut 10cm long. Test each sample three times using quarters and pennies for weight to cause a thirty degree deflection in the tubing and record the numbers of coins. Fuel mixtures for the tests are 100% gasoline, methanol, ethanol, turpentine, canola oil, and castor oil and mixtures with gasoline and 50% methanol, ethanol, and turpentine, 15% castor oil, and 10% canola oil. One set of tubing samples are exposed only to air as a control group. Immerse a set of tubing samples in each fuel mixture for two weeks and repeat bend tests. Repeat three more times for a total immersion of eight weeks.<br><br> The air, methanol, ethanol, and canola oil caused only a slight change in flexibility. 100% castor oil caused a decrease in flexibility. The other fuel mixtures caused increases in flexibility and were in order of least to most change, gasoline, 10% canola oil, 15% castor oil, 50% turpentine, 50% methanol, 50% ethanol, and 100% turpentine.<br><br> The results of this project partially supported the hypothesis in that the methanol, ethanol, and turpentine mixtures did in fact have the greatest effect on the flexibility of fuel line.

THE INVENTION OF THE AIR-POWERED ENGINE
Joseph Levi Melton
Wilcox/Hildreth High School Wilcox,NE United States

A 2-cycle internal combustion engine is to operate off of a force of some type of compressed air or other gasses. The engine is to have an intake and exhaust port. An electronic valve in route of the intake port is activated in sequence to the crankshaft’s timing pattern. This electronic valve’s activation length is determined by how the cam has been constructed. The cam is to trigger a current by the pressing of some type of switch, in sequence, the current is sent to open the valve. As the cam releases the switch, the valve closes. Once the valve is closed the compressed air expands out through the exhaust ports upon the return of the piston. These ports could have a valve set to the sequence of the crankshaft in order to open and close in timing. The excess air is either returned to the atmosphere cleaner than before, due to the filters inline, or could be recycled back through the system. <br><br> The engines speed is adjusted by the amount of pressure that is released into the cylinder. The engines air tank has an air compressor mounted to it. This compressor is operated off of a 12V battery. This battery could be charged by an alternator, if put to use in a vehicle. The preferred lubricant for the internals of this engine is vegetable oil. For this being possible, the fact is, the engine does not heat up, therefore, the vegetable oil will last an excessive amount of time without maintenance. <br><br>

OPTIMIZING THE CONDITIONS FOR PROTON EXCHANGE MEMBRANE FUEL CELLS
Kartik Shastri
Lexington High School, Lexington, MA, USA

A fuel cell is the cleanest energy source, with water as the only emission in the process. The capacity of fuel cells is key in making them economically feasible for larger applications. The current study furthers research in fuel cell technology by seeking to find the optimal fuel pressure and internal temperature at which a Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell should be operated, so as to output the highest voltage. A workbench was built consisting of a fuel cell, fuel tanks, a temperature controller, and regulators, within a control circuitry. The internal temperature was increased from 25°C to 75°C in measured intervals. At each interval, pressure was increased from 20 psi to 80 psi at increments of 20 psi each. This procedure was repeated to find the optimal conditions across four channels of resistance. In the Control (no resistance), the optimal conditions were 80 psi and 50°C, in Channel 1 (10 Ohms) and Channel 2 (1 Ohm) they were 80 psi and 75°C, and in Channel 3 (.3 Ohms) they were 80 psi and 50°C. These results allow for a significant increase in voltage for the PEM fuel cell. Along with this, an electrochemical model was proposed to explain the underlying process. Generally, fuel cells are used in stacks of multiple cells; further highlighting the magnitude of these results; miniaturization being another significant implication.

DRAG REDUCTION USING MICRO-BUBBLES
Thomas Howard Frederick
Tullahoma High, Tullahoma, TN, United States

The purpose of this project was to study the effects of micro-bubbles in the fluid layer next to a boat hull and to evaluate if bubbles would reduce the drag experienced by the hull as it moved through water. <br><br> A boat model and a water table were used to investigate the change in drag. The change in drag was measured by comparing the flow pattern on the bottom of the boat and wake behind the boat, before and after the micro-bubbles were applied to the boat hull. Photographs and video were used to make this comparison.<br><br> An important flow parameter in this type of flow is the Reynolds number, (Re = density x Velocity x Length / viscosity). The Reynolds number for the unmodified flow was calculated based on the regular water density and viscosity. Then the modified flow Reynolds number was calculated based on lower density water (with bubbles). This allowed the effective Reynolds number (with the bubbles) to be reduced. Therefore, the skin friction drag was shown to be lowered on the boat hull with the micro-bubbles. <br><br> It was observed that micro-bubbles do affect the flow patterns on the bottom of the boat. At the same time, they had no visible effect on the size of the wake behind the boat. The latter was postulated to be due to the small scale of the experiment.

WASTE OR FUEL
Michael Benjamin Stoess
South Oldham High School, Crestwood Kentucky, United States

<br><br> The purpose of this experiment was to find out if a vegetable oil could be used to fuel a diesel engine and if so how does it compare to traditional fuels. To conduct the experiment a 1985 Mercedes-Benz was converted to run on three fuels, vegetable oil, diesel and biodiesel. Each fuel was used to test the cars performance in zero to sixty tests, and gas mileage tests. <br><br> The hypothesis was that biodiesel would yield the fastest time in the zero to 60 tests, diesel would be second and vegetable oil third. On the gas mileage tests it was hypothesized that diesel would give the greatest mileage, biodiesel would come second and vegetable oil third.<br><br> On the zero to 60 tests the diesel fuel did the best with an average time of 18.02 seconds, Biodiesel was next, and then vegetable oil. On the miles per gallon test, diesel was again the best with 25.47 average miles to the gallon. <br><br> My hypothesis during this experiment was partially supported, It was expected that the diesel would do the best on gas mileage but not as good on the zero to sixty test as the biodiesel. The only down side to this experiment is that it is time consuming and expensive to get started. But once into the project the price seems to level out. <br><br>

SPLITTING WATER ON DEMAND PHASE II (INNOVATIONS IN AUTOMOBILE FUEL)
Paul-Patrick Perseo
Eldorado High School, Albuquerque, New Mexico, U.S.A.

Research conducted during last years project found an electrolyte mixture, when electrolyzed, enhances the production of hydrogen. It also allowed only the hydrogen to be collected. This researcher realized that this would be an ideal way to use electrolyzed hydrogen, without oxygen, safely as a fuel, or a carbon fuel enhancer for internal combustion engines. A new type of electrolyzer was then built, capable of delivering a large amount of electrolyte to a small electrolysis tank that could be installed in automobiles. It is self cleaning and regulating and can use contaminated electrolyte. This Specialized Hydrogen Electrolyzation System (S.H.E system) was hypothesized to either produce enough hydrogen to fuel an automobile engine completely on demand and/or by using a variation called the Hydrogen Hybrid Injection System (H.H.I system) for safely injecting hydrogen into the gasoline fuel or the air intake system, creating a hydrogen hybrid automobile that would get better gas mileage, more horsepower, and less hydrocarbon emissions. Results for the first part of the hypothesis were only 50% successful. The H.H.I. system produced only enough hydrogen at room temperature to enable the car to run at idle speed and only up to 1500 RPMs. The second part of the hypothesis proved to be 100% successful when injecting hydrogen into the fuel line or the air intake system. In conclusion, it is believed that future studies using H.T.E. combined with the S.H.E. or H.H.I. systems will enable this researcher to run the car, on hydrogen, completely on demand.

PORPHYRIN-NANOSTRUCTURE BASED WATER-SPLITTING SYSTEMS
Melissa Ann Hatch
Rio Rancho High School, Rio Rancho NM, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine if variations on the classic water-splitting system using porphyrin nanostructures as photosensitizers would increase efficiency of hydrogen production. Aqueous solutions were prepared using distilled water, ETDA (electron donor 2), colloidal platinum (electron carrier), anthracene carboxylic acid (electron donor 1), and porphyrin and porphyrin nanostructures (photosensitizer). Solutions were tested by varying materials and concentrations including iridium colloid, platinum colloid, and types of porphyrin and porphyrin nanostructures. Each solution was tested by purging with argon gas to remove excess gases and then irradiating with a tungsten-halogen bulb (solar light imitation) for 90 minutes. Samples of the gases produced were drawn off by syringe at 10, 30, 60, and 90 min. These samples were analyzed using a GCMS to determine the percentage of hydrogen produced. The hypothesis was not supported as there was no significant difference in production between the different nanostructures used in test solutions. There was also no significant difference between the SnT3PyP-Pt colloid nanostructures (beads) and a plain SnT4PyP porphyrin. Further research would include testing the solutions over longer intervals; varying the types of nanostructures and porphyrins; and determining the amount of energy produced by the solution compared to energy input.

The purpose of the project was to formulate a novel solid rocket propellant to be more environmentally friendly, non-corrosive, to be significantly more cost effective than present solid rocket propellants and to investigate the effect of pressure on the burn rate of the propellant. <br><br>Empirical as well as theoretical experiments were conducted to optimize as well as to model this propellant. The propellant was formulated on a novel Epoxy based binder with Potassium Nitrate oxidizer. To asses the performance of the propellant two experiments were conducted, burn rate at ambient pressures and burn rate at elevated pressures. First the propellant grains were manufactured. The grains were then loaded into specially built rocket engine. The engine was connected to a pressure transducer, which was then interfaced to a four channel data logger. The engine was then was ignited and pressure readings were recorded. Various nozzle sizes were used to stimulate different pressures ranging from 0.1 Mpa to 11.2 Mpa.<br><br>The results from the test firing were used to calculate the pressure exponents, characteristic velocity, burn rate coefficient and the specific impulse of the propellant. These results successfully fulfilled the aim of the project. It was observed that the burn rate is directly proportional to the pressure and that aluminium greatly improved the propellant’s performance. <br><br>To date this formulation is one of the safest, cheapest and most reliable rocket propellants. It has the potential of saving aerospace companies a substantial amount of money. <br><br>

BIODIESEL: A REFINED PROCESS
Chelsea Ann Duhon, Sharis Nicole Steib
Science and Math Academy, Vacherie, Lousiana, United States

Biodiesel is an environmentally friendly and cost effective alternative to diesel and gas that we, as humans, use everyday. Biodiesel does, however, have some limitations that we hope to overcome. Diesel has a freezing point, or point of viscosity, of approximately -33*C, but biodiesel has an approximate point of 4*C.<br><br> When biodiesel becomes this cold, it reaches is point of viscosity and begins to gel and crystallize. Adding reducing agents while processing the biodiesel will allow the point of viscosity in the biodiesel to be reduced. This will allocate the biodiesel to stay in its liquid form. <br><br>The purpose is to design a method to effectively refine the process and resulting product of biodiesel. This can be accomplished by achieving a few engineering goals: to lower the freezing point of highly concentrated biodiesel and enhance the fragrance of burned biodiesel, all while being environmentally friendly. <br><br>Since turpentine, methanol, and vinegar are environmentally friendly and show a similar molecule structure as other less-friendly reducing agents which have low freezing points, we believe that turpentine, methanol, or vinegar will reduce the clouding point of biodiesel. <br><br> Prepare the biodiesel using KOH and methanol along with the selected oil. Wash the mixture after it has been blended and has settled for at least 24 hours. Add the selected amount of turpentine, methanol, apple zest, and/or orange zest. Use a temperature probe and spectrometer to determine the cloud point of the solution. Use a bomb calorimeter to determine the combustibility of the biodiesel, and a gas chromatography machine to determine the components that make up biodiesel. <br><br>

REFORMATION OF LANDFILL GAS FOR POWER PRODUCTION WITH A FUEL CELL USING ACTIVATED CHARCOAL
Curtis James Peterson, Raymond Ehlers, Sean Skyllingstad
Crescent Valley High School, Corvallis, Oregon, United States

Landfills create large quantities of methane gas that have the potential for generating electricity. The gas also contains hydrogen sulfide, which can become corrosive and makes the gas hard to utilize. Landfill gas at Coffin Butte Landfill near Corvallis, Oregon, is currently being burned in internal combustion engines, which produces electricity at a 30% efficiency rate. The engines constantly break down due to hydrogen sulfide and excess gas is flared off. Activated charcoal has been found to be an effective adsorbent for many substances. The objective of this experiment was to determine if activated charcoal can effectively remove hydrogen sulfide from the landfill gas. A granular form of activated charcoal was inserted in a PVC tube and the tube was connected to a direct stream of landfill gas. A flow meter was used to obtain a rate of 4L/min. Hydrogen sulfide concentration was measured every seven minutes using gas detection tubes. Tests using 15 g of charcoal showed no detectable amounts of hydrogen sulfide in filtered landfill gas for 28 minutes. There was a gradual increase of hydrogen sulfide up to 2 ppm at 56 minutes. After 56 minutes the charcoal gradually lost effectiveness. Activated charcoal was shown to effectively remove hydrogen sulfide from landfill gas. Removal of this corrosive chemical allows the gas to be used in fuel cells for more efficient production of electricity, reducing both pollution and waste. Use of activated charcoal presents an exciting, commercially viable means to create energy from landfills.<br><br>

METHANE GAS PRODUCTION

The purpose of this project is to determine the amount of methane gas that is produced from the waste of beef cattle, hogs, and chickens; what factors affect the methane production, and what animal waste produces the most methane gas in a controlled environment. After many attempts, successful production and collection of methane gas was achieved. Three different forms of animal waste (beef cattle, hogs, and chickens) were used.<br><br> The method of producing and collecting methane gas was improved from the method of former Alden-Conger students. This process allowed the production and collection of the gas using twenty ounce bottles, a simple hose and water. The production of methane gas is a result of an anaerobic process involving volatile solids, acid bacteria, and methane formers called methanogens. <br><br> In the experiment it was observed that the chicken waste produced the highest yield of methane gas at the fastest rate. The total amount of methane gas produced by chicken waste was 394 mL, compared to a total of 340 mL from beef cattle and 130 mL from hog. It was concluded that this is a result of the chicken waste containing more nitrogen than the cattle or hog waste. It was also concluded that the amount of waste excreted from a chicken at one time is far less than that of beef cattle or hogs; therefore the amount of chickens necessary to make a profit from collection of methane gas would be greater than that of beef cattle.<br><br>

AN ECONOMICAL METHOD OF CONVERTING OIL SHALE INTO LIQUID FUEL USING SOLAR ENEGRY
Luna Irshaid Al Taher, Nader Hirmas
Modern Montessori School, Amman, Jordan

The aim of our experiments was to find a cheap unconventional source of energy in the form of liquid fuel from oil shale using solar power. We had previously heard about oil shale that can burn on its own, so we decided to find an economical way of utilizing it.<br><br>To begin with, many Physical experiments were executed on the stone, beginning with the first experiment; determining the specific heat capacity (C) of the stone by the method of mixtures (98.27cal/g.Co). The next experiment was to find the amount of energy emitted from the stone by burning it under a beaker of water to find the temperature reached. A dangerous smell was released and the stone took a very long time to burn. Therefore, the third experiment aimed at heating the stone in vacuum to remove all complex organic compounds, which resulted in leakages and an incomplete condensation of gases. The final experiment was executed to find out the temperature at which the stone starts producing fumes. The initial temperature was 30owhere as the maximum was 374o Celsius.<br><br>Furthermore, designs followed to build up Unit B (Converting Unit). We tried to heat the stone using fractional distillation. Since all gases were viscous, the beads of the fractionating column forced the gases back down, contributing to the next design; the same process without glass beads. Since it took a long time to heat the stone, a sand bath was used to decrease the time needed for the stone to heat up. Also, there were three types of gases that condense at different temperatures. Three condensers were used to condense each type, and the overall unit was made from red copper as it heats up and cools down quickly.<br><br>Finally, Unit A (Solar Unit) is summarized by using a parabolic dish covered with a layer of aluminum that can direct the sun rays to a focal point. Unit B was connected at that point and liquid petroleum was extracted. It was found out that about 94 grams of stone gave out 12.5ml liquid fuel. By simple calculations, about 1.2 tons of stone are equivalent to one barrel of petroleum.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF AIR CHANNELS ON THE LIFT OF AIRCRAFT
Walter Patrick Rosas, Jacqueline Elizabeth Rosas
Centreville High School, Clifton, VA, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine if placing ridges onto the top surface of an aircraft wing would control the airflow over the wing and allow for manipulation of the critical angle of attack for the wing. Being able to increase this angle corresponds with greater lift which makes the aircraft more maneuverable, able to carry more weight, land and take off over shorter distances, and fly under less power.<br><br> This experiment was performed using Styrofoam wings, each with a different incrementation of ridges on the upper surface, and testing for the critical angle of attack using a Plexiglas wind tunnel designed and constructed by the team. The angle at which the test wing was placed was increased until no extended lift could be maintained, at which point the wing stalled and dropped to the bottom of the wind tunnel. The greatest angle at which the wing sustained lift for each trial was taken as data to test the hypothesis that placing the ridges at the closest intervals would direct the air in the shape of the airflow and allow for the greatest increase of the critical angle of attack.<br><br> The data gathered fully supported the hypothesis, as the wing having the ridges at 1.8 centimeter intervals resulted in the largest critical angle of attack. In addition, the data trends demonstrated that the ridges being placed at smaller intervals directly led to an increase in the critical angle. The large increase of this angle experienced between the trials with ridges spaced at 12.50 and 6.25 centimeters provided evidence that if the intervals are too large then the ridges have only a minimal effect, but as smaller channels are created, the effect they have on reducing turbulence around the wing increases. It can, therefore, be concluded that the incorporation of the theory researched in this experiment would be of great benefit in future aircraft designs for producing airplanes capable of achieving superior lift. <br><br>

One of the main problems faced in any kind of accidents, where local geography makes first aid access difficult, is the crucial time between the accident and the arrival of the professional to give the first attendance. So, we had the idea to develop a type of vehicle that could not only arrive quickly in any place where there are victims, but also take a professional who could give assistance to the victims in less time, increasing this way, their survival possibilities.   <br><br> Our project aims the construction of an amphibious vehicle of fast displacement with hybrid drive - underwater propeller and air propeller for the purpose of emergency rescue in accidents which involve seas, rivers, lakes, quagmire and sanded areas. The vehicle can transport a paramedical staff, a fire brigade, first aids kits, and a stretcher, allowing first aid procedures to start in the vehicle.  <br><br> Our project accelerates the process of attending victims in places of difficult access, which is done today by using helicopters or motorboats, reducing the time between the accident and the arrival of the rescue team, and therefore the beginning of first aid procedures.

A NOVEL ADVANCED BRAKE LIGHT WARNING SYSTEM TO PREVENT VEHICULAR TAILGATING ACCIDENTS
Tanay David Delima, Nikhil Khosla
Dhirubhai Ambani International School, Mumbai 400 098, Maharashtra, India

Around 65% of all vehicular accidents are caused by tailgating. This experiment attempts to find out whether it is possible to prevent tailgating accidents by giving the driver in the rear vehicle additional time to apply his brakes and stop safely when the car in front stops.<br><br>At present in cars, the rear brake lights come on when the brakes are applied. If an additional rear light of a different colour comes on in the lead vehicle, when the accelerator is released prior to the brakes being applied, it would inform the driver in the car behind of his intention to stop, giving him additional time to respond and bring his car to a safe stop.<br><br>We mounted two lights on a board. In mode 1 the red light comes on when the brake is pressed. In mode 2 an additional amber light comes on when the accelerator pedal is released before applying the brake pedal. A digital timer starts when the researcher presses his brake pedal and is stopped when the subject presses his brake pedal. This records the time taken by the subject to respond in both modes.<br><br>The experiment was performed on 134 subjects. The data was statistically analyzed and conclusively shows that when the subjects were forewarned by an additional light coming on just a fraction of a second earlier, their response time was significantly reduced. <br><br>A simple rewiring in cars can prevent these accidents with its consequent loss of life and financial costs. <br><br>

The task we wanted to accomplish was to develop a control system capable of independently preventing intended collisions of airplanes with either buildings or terrain objects.<br><br>The first step was to determine a suitable control technology for our demands.<br><br>Because of various technical advantages we decided to use fuzzy-logic.<br><br>In order to meet as many dangerous situations as possible we created three modes, each with different input signals.<br><br>Mode 1 deals with excessive rates of descent towards terrain, using altitude and rate of descent.<br><br>Mode 2 prevents collisions with obstacles higher than the current altitude of the aircraft (buildings, cliffs, etc.).<br><br>Mode 3 uses airspeed towards and distance from the obstacle to prevent the aircraft from directly hitting the obstacle while its position is above the upper edge of the object.<br><br>All input data is gained from terrain data bases and satellite navigation.<br><br>After processing the data in using the fuzzy-logic-control a percentage of maximum allowed g-load is obtained. This acceleration is further used to reduce rate of descent and to initiate an appropriate climb in order to prevent a collision.<br><br>Although developed to prevent intended collisions our system is also capable of preventing accidental collisions (CFIT - Controlled Flight Into Terrain).<br><br>After developing the modes we verified our considerations by numerical calculations and by simulating all three modes with a proper software program.<br><br>The result is a control system applicable to many different aircraft types with only slight changes of the control parameters.<br><br>

HOMEMADE BIODIESEL PRODUCTION AND EFFICIENCY IN A TROPICAL CLIMATE
Manuel H. Garcia-Cartagena, Ilianell M. Valle-Gutierrez
San German Interamerican High School, San German, PUERTO RICO

The purpose of this research was to determine if production and efficiency of homemade biodiesel fuel manufactured from used cooking oil, sodium hydroxide aqueous solution and methanol, modifying formula and procedure to fit tropical climate was possible. Part I of this investigation included manufacturing biodiesel from: used cooking oil, sodium hydroxide aqueous solution (50% purity) and 20% methanol (99%+ purity). Biodiesel production procedure was adjusted down to nine steps; NaOH was used in aqueous solution. GC-MS and NIR tests were performed on the non filtered, research and commercial samples, which resulted comparable. One hundred thirty-five (135) biodiesel gallons were produced, in 3 batches of 45 gallons each, over the course of one week. Part II evaluated efficiency with biodiesel, B 50 and diesel. Efficiency was measured by comparing 3 different trials for each type of fuel, per 30 gallon tank. Data analysis performed on Excel to evaluate differences in average performances were significant (á.05): diesel (Mean = 409.66, SD = 8.33), B-50 (Mean = 402.33, SD = 4.51, Biodiesel (Mean = 362.66, SD = 1.57). According to these results there is a difference on vehicle performance, (miles traveled per tank), depending on the type of fuel used. Results suggest a positive outcome for homemade biodiesel production using used cooking oil, methanol and NaOH aqueous solution in tropical climates, although there is less efficiency in vehicle performance when using biodiesel, than B 50 or diesel fuels. Biodiesel is cost effective, lubricates and cleans engine components and is less harmful to environment.

ETHANOL SYNTHESIS FROM DIFFERENT BIODEGRADABLE HOUSEHOLD WASTE PRODUCTS
Bailey Renee Leppek, Derek Austin Kramer
Cherry Creek High, Centennial CO, USA

Environmental, economic and political issues have brought up the need for a cleaner, renewable fuel to replace oil. Most ethanol used today is generated from corn; however, it can be made from literally any organic matter. The purpose of this experiment was to determine which common household plant waste (paper, pine needles, assorted dead grass, live grass, sticks, dead leaves, corrugated cardboard, and non-corrugated cardboard) produces the most glucose when reacting with cellulase. From the amount of glucose produced, the amount of ethanol that could be made can be estimated. <br><br>One gram of each material was allowed to react with cellulase in water for 30 minutes. Solutions were tested with 3-5 dinitrosalicylate (an indicator for simple sugars) and read in a spectrophotometer to quantify absorbance. A standard glucose solution curve was used to convert absorbance to glucose concentration for the test group. Different kinds of leaves (maple, apple, oak, cottonwood, aspen, ivy, and Russian olive) were also tested and compared to determine if some leaves produce more glucose than others. <br><br>The order, from most to least, of glucose produced was: apple leaves, maple leaves, cottonwood leaves, aspen leaves, oak leaves, pine needles, ivy leaves, live grass, dead grass, sticks, Russian olive leaves, corrugated cardboard, regular cardboard, paper. It was determined that the type of tree affects the amount of glucose a leaf produces. Because both cardboards and paper produced so little glucose, it would make more sense to recycle them back into paper than to make ethanol from them. <br><br>

PRODUCING ELECTRICITY USING GEOTHERMAL ENERGY

Humans must resort more to renewable energies to minimize the effects of global warming. This research aims at building a hybrid electricity plant between a geothermal plant and an OTEC (Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion) plant. If NH3 could expand immensely because of geothermal heat, then enough electricity could be produced while making use of the drop in the NH3 gas temperature to regulate the temperature of a greenhouse instead of traditional cooling systems.<br><br>Since Ammonia has a low boiling point of -33,3 °C and a high coefficient of expansion {one cubic ft of NH3 liquid at 15°C expands to 850 cubic ft of gas}. That makes it able to turn a turbine with a delta T as low as 20°C. <br><br>Therefore, drilling a well of 2 km in depth with a gradient of 3°C/ 100m should be able to give enough heat to obtain a delta T of 60°C, knowing that water will be used only as a heat conductor. By making it a closed cycle, the NH3 gas drop in temperature will be used to regulate the temperature of a greenhouse. A miniature turbine engine was built and exposed to Ammonia vapor at a 50°C. The failure of that experiment emphasized that pressure will be needed in the turbine engine. Using the temperature drop as a variable, the plant's efficiency computed was 10.39 %, a value much higher than the 4% obtained in OTEC plants. In conclusion, this research indicates that this plant promises a salubrious energy source. <br><br>

PRODUCTION OF ETHANOL FROM RECYCLED PAPER
Emilie Grace Gelpi, Erin Elizabeth Contini
Saint Joseph's Academy, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, United States

The purpose of this experiment is to find an alternative fuel source through the conversion of recycled paper to ethanol. Ultimately, the total amount of crude oil which can be recovered has a finite limit. For instance, there is a total of 1500 billion barrels of recoverable crude oil in the world; however, if global consumption stays the same as it is now, production will decline by 2010. Therefore, it is imperative that ethanol be utilized as an alternative to diminishing fuel.<br><br> Traditionally, ethanol is produced from corn and sugar cane; conversely, this experiment uses recycled paper to produce ethanol. The paper was first collected, then shredded, and finally pre treated. During the pre treatment process, cellulose’s complex cell structure was broken down into fermentable sugars. Three types of pretreatments were administered to the recycled paper. The first pretreatment involved different concentrations of the enzyme, spezyme. The other two pretreatment processes dealt with treating the recycled paper with different concentrations of diluted sulfuric acid. However, the third pretreatment process varied from the second in its addition of a higher heat and its better suited environment for the enzymes. All pre treatments yielded a percentage of fermentable sugars, yet the third pretreatment involving the diluted acid concentrations produced the highest percentage of fermentable sugars. Once the sugars were produced, they were fermented with the assistance of yeasts. Finally, the product was distilled to reach the final result: ethanol.<br><br>

Cora Bigliola de Renault, Rocha, Uruguay

The main objective of the research was to create an alternative fuel from a raw material renewable, so that this replaces derivatives of petroleum, and it be ecological as well.<br><br>This project takes us to the obtaining of gaseous hydrocarbons from a biofuel made from vegetal oil and methanol, the biodiesel. For this procedure was necessary the elaboration of a homemade apparatus, which could make the transformation. The carried out process within the apparatus is the well-known catalytic cracking (technical of synthesis that never had been applied to biodiesel before).<br><br>These gaseous hydrocarbons are the turn out to pass steam of biodiesel through hot catalysts (porcelain and nickel), putting this steam under a minimum pressure of 3 atmospheres, turning all biodiesel in these gaseous hydrocarbons, being the real yield of this process the 100%.In theory the obtained gases are a mixture of alkenes y alkynes.<br><br> The applications can vary from the simple uses in the home or in automobiles, until the complex military or industrial uses. <br><br>The use of these gases of vegetal origin it favors the preservation of environment when establishing a cycle in the carbon, whereas when using fossil fuels we released to the atmosphere the carbon that is underneath the terrestrial crust adding every day tons of this substance to air. With this the problems such as fuel shortage, pollution by gases, energy crises, etc; they can be solved with the simple fact to use these gases. Having the fulfilled objectives and the benefits at sight we can affirm that the manufacturing of this alternative fuel is sustainable.

CREATING A WAY FOR CONSUMERS TO COMPARE THE ECONOMIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN E85 AND GASOLINE AT THE PUMP
Adam Lee Broderius
Glencoe-Silver Lake High School, Glencoe, MN

This project developed a way for the consumer to compare the economic differences between E85 and gasoline at the pump. E85 is a blend of gasoline and ethanol that ranges from 70 to 85 percent ethanol during the year. This means the consumer is faced with a price and percent ethanol difference.<br><br> The goal was to create an easier way to calculate an anticipated E85 price without using a paper, pencil, and calculator. The anticipated price is based on the gasoline price and percent ethanol. <br><br> My hypothesis was that with continued testing, monitoring, and research of the ethanol industry, I would be able to create a way for the consumer to quickly determine if the price spread between E85 and gasoline is fair and economical.<br><br> Six stations were chosen to obtain samples from with three each being the same brand. I labeled one, "Brand X" and the other brand "Brand Y." The stations were chosen based on a realistic route that my neighbors and other residents in the area drive to and from work. Eight samples were gathered over a period of seven months. The gasoline and E85 prices were also recorded.<br><br> The anticipated price spreads varied significantly as did the percent ethanol in the fuels during the year. I developed a slide rule during the process that would work well for a consumer to carry in their vehicle. It has space for advertising to help cover the printing cost.

HARNESSING SOLAR ENERGY, YEAR FOUR: INCREASING THE EFFICIENCY OF A HYBRID POLYMER PHOTOVOLTAIC CELL WITH ZINC OXIDE NANOFIBERS IN VARYING LENGTHS
Nathan McKay Monroe
Episcopal High School of Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL

The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effects of varied length zinc oxide nanofibers on the efficiency of a polymer photovoltaic cell. It was hypothesized that increasing nanofiber length would increase efficiency, until the fibers surpassed polymer thickness. ZnO increases efficiency by promoting exciton dissociation. An increased surface area of ZnO should further increase efficiency.<br><br> The slides, precoated with indium tin oxide, were cleaned to remove any dust or impurities. A nucleation layer of zinc acetate was spin-coated onto the slides. The slides were annealed at 300 C. The nanofibers were grown from a zinc nitrate solution at 70 C from 0-30 minutes in 5 minute increments. Scanning Electron Microscopy was used to prove that fiber length was associated with growth time. The polymer P3HT was spin-coated onto the slides at 2000 rpm. The slides were annealed at 180 C in nitrogen. Layers of aluminum and bathocuproine were applied via thermal evaporation. The slides were tested using a solar simulator and a semiconductor parameter analyzer.<br><br> The data supported the hypothesis. Increasing fiber length increased efficiency until a maximum at 25 minutes growth time. The solar device with fibers grown for 25 minutes had an efficiency 4.39x greater than the control. The p-value was practically zero. This project has an enormous application. The polymer is a liquid, allowing it to be painted onto any surface. It can also absorb more wavelengths of light. Finally, it can be produced cheaper than standard solar panels, requiring no special temperature or pressure.

HARVESTING THE WIND
Ryan William Dennis Blanford
Carroll High School, Dayton, OH

The purpose of this project was to determine which blade pitch angle was most effective in harvesting wind energy with a wind turbine. It was hypothesized that the lower pitch propellers will produce the higher generator power output until the pitch angle causes blade drag that slows the propeller down. In order to test each pitch angle, a variable pitch blade was mounted to a generator and then it was placed in front of a wind tunnel. While testing, the generator was put under four different resistors and a light emitting diode (LED). The tests displayed a decreasing power pattern, where pitch angles near 0° created the most amount of power and pitch angles near 90° created the least amount of power. In conclusion, it was proven that lower pitch angles created more power than higher pitch angles.

SOLVING THE HYDROGEN STORAGE PROBLEM: COMPACT HYDROGEN STORAGE IN NH3 COMPLEXES
Ariah Aram Klages-Mundt
Winona Senior High School, Winona, MN

Hydrocarbon fuel problems have led to a search for alternatives. Renewable sources and carbon sequestration could be applied to generating hydrogen as a sustainable, non-polluting, energy carrier. Ammine (NH3) complexes such as Ca(NH3)8Cl2(s) and Mg(NH3)6Cl2(s) offer a high-density solution to the search for formidable hydrogen storage media. A variety of complexes were examined to determine storage potential and circumvent hydration problems related to Ca(NH3)8Cl2(s), a hydrogen-rich, but moisture-volatile, storage material. A high-yield process was established for compound production utilizing a porous rayon support. NH3 release was tested using thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Compounds were characterized using x-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and infrared spectroscopy (IR). XRD and IR depicted Mg(NH3)6Cl2(s) formation, corroborative of experimental hydrogen densities: 9.293% gravimetric, 0.1123 kg H2/L volumetric, and 13.22 MJ H2/L energy, exceeding Dept. Energy goals and allowing vehicles to travel 650 km using standard 53 L fuel tanks. Three stages of NH3 release were observed and completed upon 330ºC; with an NH3-decomposition catalyst, hydrogen is released at relatively low temperatures (300ºC) with 22.05% parasitic energy loss of hydrogen release, substantially lower than liquid hydrogen. A 1:1mol mixture of Ca(NH3)8Cl2(s) and Mg(NH3)6Cl2(s) drastically lessened the extent of hydration problems while presenting the possibility for higher hydrogen densities and lower energy loss inherent through hydrogen release. The materials are inexpensive in comparison to gasoline per energy released and take advantage of existing infrastructure while offering a renewable storage/release cycle.

EMERGENCY POWER GENERATION FOR PEM FUEL CELLS IN REMOTE LOCATIONS
Yu Linlin Huang
Pettisville Local Schools, Pettisville, OH

Current methods of hydrogen production are expensive and ineffective for quick, on-the-site hydrogen generation. This is especially a problem for third-world countries or secluded areas. The purpose of this project is to formulate a quick and inexpensive method to chemically generate hydrogen in remote regions by reacting zinc or sodium borohydride with hydrochloric acid. The prediction was that sodium borohydride reacting with hydrochloric acid will produce the most hydrogen in the shortest amount of time with the least amount of materials. Varying masses of solid zinc and solid sodium borohydride were reacted with aqueous hydrochloric acid to produce gaseous hydrogen by downward displacement. The least amount of materials needed to produce enough hydrogen to power the Polymer Electrolyte Membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) was first determined. Then, the least amount of each reactant respectively was used to generate hydrogen to power the PEMFC. A multimeter was used to determine the voltage output and a stopwatch was used to determine the total running time of the fuel cell by each material. It was determined that Sodium borohydride is more efficient for on-the-site hydrogen generation. 0.1 grams of sodium borohydride supplies more power to a fuel cell than 20g of zinc. Sodium borohydride is also more cost efficient. The results of this project can be used to determine the most efficient chemical for on-the-site hydrogen generation.

THE EFFECTS OF WATER ELECTROLYSIS ON AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE, PHASE TWO
Jonathan Boyd Soli
Alden-Conger High School, Alden, MN

The objective of this project was to engineer a system that uses the gases produced by the electrolysis of water to improve the performance of a single cylinder four-cycle internal combustion engine. An electrolysis apparatus was attached to the air-intake of a 3.5hp lawnmower engine and through a series of tests fuel consumption, emissions, electrical and mechanical power, and cost were analyzed and compared to the same engine operating without H2+O2 gas. The hypotheses were that the H2+O2 would reduce gasoline consumption and harmful emissions at a reasonable cost.<br><br> <br><br>The electrolysis apparatus utilized 21 stainless steel electrode plates suspended in electrolytic solution. Tests were performed over a range of solution concentrations to determine electrical efficiencies and production rates of hydrogen and oxygen.<br><br> <br><br>The electrolysis apparatus produced H2+O2 at rates ranging from 4.7-110.5 L/hr and obtained an average efficiency of 76.3%. H2+O2 lowered the engine’s fuel consumption as expected. Emissions and power efficiencies varied depending on engine speed and the amount of H2+O2. <br><br>This project has proven it is possible to improve performances of an engine by adding the products of water electrolysis. Fuel efficiency improvements of 22.7% with a 28.6% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions were obtained. With optimization of fuel carburetion and system design, this technology could be applied to many types of combustion engines.

WASTE FRUIT AS AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE OF ENERGY
Malvina Alicia Kowalik
North Atlanta High School, Atlanta, GA

The purpose of this project was to gather energy from rotten fruit by means of a fuel cell. My hypothesis was that fruit with a lower pH level would generate more electricity than fruit with a higher pH level. I believed that lemons would generate the most electricity, followed by grapes and bananas, respectively. The number would increase when adding a growth medium.<br><br>I built a fuel cell using two plastic bottles with lids and a plastic pipe. I drilled a hole, having the same diameter as the pipe, near the bottom of each bottle. I poured nutrient agar into the pipe, let it solidify, and inserted it into the holes. Salt water was poured into each bottle. I then placed a platinum electrode into each bottle, connecting them each to a wire. Running each wire through its respective hole in the bottle lids, I attached them to a multimeter. The voltage was measured until the numbers became stable. I added the blended rotten bananas to one bottle and water to the other, measured the pH, and measured the voltage over a 12-hour period, doing the same with rotten lemons and rotten grapes. I then shredded a potato, added three tablespoons to the bananas, and measured the change.<br><br>In my results, the salt water alone had a voltage of 15 milliVolts. The grapes reached 227 milliVolts, the lemons reached 287 milliVolts, and the bananas reached 148.7 milliVolts. The shredded potato increased the voltage by 25 milliVolts.<br><br>My hypothesis was correct.

GO GREEN: OUT OF THE FRYER, INTO THE FUTURE
Christopher Ernie Lopez
Taos High School, Taos, NM

The days of horse and buggy for transportation are a thing of the past, (so we think) unless the fuel pricing trend reverts. In last years project soy bean oil was used as a sole source of Bio-Diesel (BD) synthesis. That led to this year’s project, “A comparative analysis of % yield in BD synthesis resulting from canola, peanut and corn oil triglyceride macromolecule cracking (degradation) by heating and catalyzation using a standard methyl esterification process.” It is hypothesized that as the vegetable oils are batch heated, then various changes will occur (viscosity, % yield, % transmittance and caloric output).<br><br> Experimentation was conducted as follows: heat oils for 720 min. at 171°C, extracting samples every 90 minutes. Methyl esterify the respective samples with sodium methoxide as a catalyst. Upon completing the methylization process, allow samples to gravity separate for 96 hours and decant BD. Test BD for densities, % transmittance, viscosity, pH, ignition/burn time, caloric output and calculate % yield.<br><br> The following prevalent patterns were observed: the BD from raw canola had the highest % yield of all oils sampled (raw and heated). However, the use of raw vegetable oil to synthesize BD is not economically feasible. The heated corn oil BD ranked first of the heated oil trials. Peanut oil had the highest caloric output.<br><br> It is concluded that raw canola BD had the highest % yield with decreased viscosity and density. The highest BD % yield from the heated oil was corn. Corn and canola both tied for the best BD caloric output. The viscosity and caloric output did not support the hypothesis and is therefore rejected, hence more, the data from the heated corn oil supported the hypothesis and is therefore accepted. This is a true testament to, "Going Green - Out of The Fryer and Into The Future of Bio-Diesel Synthesis".

A SOLAR STIRLING POWER SYSTEM UTILIZING A THIN-FILM CONCENTRATOR FOR LUNAR APPLICATIONS
Nathan Michael Tinker
Covenant Christian Academy, Huntsville, AL

Lightweight power systems are needed for future lunar missions. The purpose of this project was to investigate a solar-powered Stirling engine fitted with a lightweight thin-film concentrator, to generate electricity for lunar surface applications. The thin-film concentrator provides focused solar energy to heat and operate the engine, and enables the system to be lightweight and deployable. A major problem anticipated for operation of a solar power system on the lunar surface is the effect of lunar dust on concentrator performance.<br><br> Different 46 cm diameter concentrators (thin-film parabolic reflector, aluminum parabolic reflector, and thin-film and acrylic Fresnel lenses) were tested to discover which produced the highest concentrated energy. Dust experiments were performed with 15.24 cm acrylic Fresnel lenses to determine the effect that lunar dust simulant has on lens concentration. Full system tests in ambient sunlight were performed with three concentrators and the Stirling engine.<br><br> The best performing concentrators were the 46 cm acrylic Fresnel lens and thin-film parabolic reflector, having concentration ratios of 92 and 58, respectively. Lunar dust simulant caused a major reduction in Fresnel lens concentration performance. For example, a 50 g/m2 layer of dust resulted in an 83% loss of concentrated energy. In full system tests, it was discovered that voltage output varied approximately linearly with engine temperature, reaching a peak value of 317 mV. <br><br> Results indicate that lightweight thin-film concentrators appear feasible for powering a solar Stirling system for lunar applications. However, further development is needed to prevent the accumulation of lunar dust on the concentrator.

GLYCERIN ABSORPTION AND COMBUSTION FOR ENERGY PRODUCTION

Keota High School, Keota, IA

After conducting research last year on the effects of crude glycerin when combined with biomasses for a heat source, I discovered the natural by-product of biodiesel allowed biomasses to obtain a larger mass and burn longer. As a continuation project for this year, I tested three types of crude glycerin on six different biomasses. I hypothesized that the absorption rates of each biomass would vary and act as natural filters for glycerin. An accurate amount of energy produced would be found using a calorimeter.<br><br> I conducted my experiment by testing woodchips, wood pellets, corn stalks, corn cobs, prairie grass, and oat hulls with soybean-based glycerin, canola-based glycerin, and animal-fat glycerin. 20 grams of each biomass was allowed to absorb with 280 grams of glycerin to discover absorption rates. The initial soybean-based glycerin and excess glycerin of absorption tests from woodchips, cornstalks, and prairie grass were sent to an REG lab to be chemically analyzed. I discovered what each material filtered out of the crude glycerin. The glycerin-imbued biomasses were combusted in a calorimeter and a control group was also tested. Energy produced per gram of material was calculated. <br><br> Creating cost competitive raw materials that are cheaper than coal was found to be possible by adding mass to the same volume, producing a heating value. The discovery of what natural biomasses combine the best with crude glycerin and produce the most energy results in an economical and environmentally viable source for this by-product of biodiesel.

The project compares the quantity of methane contained in the biogas produced by the anaerobic digestion of equine manure and turkey manure. The method is a three-step process: producing biogas, transferring the biogas to a pressurization container, and burning the biogas.<br><br> Biogas is a byproduct of naturally occurring anaerobic bacteria digesting the manure. The primary components of biogas are methane and carbon dioxide. Methane is the only combustible significant component of biogas.<br><br> During the test procedure, the biogas from each type of manure is collected using a water displacement technique to minimize contamination from outside air. The biogas is then transferred to a flexible container which is pressurized and connected to a burner. Water is heated by the burning biogas and the temperature is monitored from the initial application of heat for ten minutes. The temperature data from the different biogas sources is compared.<br><br>The equine manure produced 1.85 times the biogas produced by the turkey manure. The methane generated by the equine manure averaged 6,993 calories. The biogas produced by the turkey manure could not sustain a flame during the test. The equine manure produced a greater volume of biogas with a higher methane concentration than the turkey manure.

ALGAE: FUEL OF THE FUTURE
Ethan Daniel Erickson
West Central Valley High School, Stuart, IA

In the past several years, energy has become a major concern. Over the course of the research in alternative fuels, scientists have hypothesized that they can extract oil from algae. This year’s project is entitled “Algae: Fuel of the Future.” The purpose of this experiment is to discover what environmental conditions obtain the highest density of algae and highest oil percentage. It is hypothesized that the highest density of algae will be obtained from a clear tub fertilized with wet hog manure, and the highest oil percentage will be obtained from the clear tubs with 20-10-20 fertilizer. To complete this experiment, first, build “raceway” testing containers, add algae to containers, test clear vs. colored containers, test hog manure vs. nitrogen and fertilizer, harvest the algae after experiments, and finally, calculate the densities and BTU’s. The clear containers had average growths of .286 grams per liter compared to the green containers that had a growth of .084 grams per liter. However, the fertilizer averaged out to .230 grams per liter compared to the hog manure at .502 grams per liter. After running a bomb, it was found that algae fed hog manure produces 20.22 BTU’s per gram, while the fertilized algae gave off 17.13 BTU’s of heat per gram, and the switchgrass at only 16.42 BTU’s per gram. In conclusion, the clear growing environment combined with the nutrients of the hog manure are what the algae need to grow, both to reach maximum density, and contain the highest percentage of oil.

THE APPLICATION OF HUMPBACK WHALE FIN MORPHOLOGY TO A STANDARD AIRFOIL: REVOLUTIONIZING SLOW FLIGHT AERODYNAMICS
Andrew Kipling Miller
Western Alamance High School, Elon, NC

The purpose of this experiment was to apply the tubercle projections on the leading edge of a Humpback whale pectoral fin to a standard 2412 NACA airfoil and to test the resulting flight characteristics. Different frequencies of tubercles along the airfoil were compared. <br><br> Four laser cut foam NACA 2412 airfoils were tested in a homemade wind tunnel. The airfoil dimensions were 6 inch chord by 24 inch span. The control wing was the standard airfoil (C) with wings 2 through 4 having tubercles spaced at 1.5 (HF), 2.5 (MF), and 5 inches (LF) respectively. Lift and drag were measured at angles of attack of 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 degrees. A digital force meter recorded 120 data points for each setting.<br><br> The data showed that all wings with tubercles exhibited more lift than control. The HF and LF wings exhibited 30% more lift than C at higher angles of attack. Drag data showed 37% and 16% increases for the LF and MF wings, while the HF and control wings produced equal drag. The HF wing had a 19% efficiency advantage over the C and MF wings and a 43% advantage over the LF wing. <br><br> The results indicate that placing tubercles on the leading edge of a standard airfoil significantly enhances lift. Close spacing of tubercles along the edge does not affect drag compared to control. Adding tubercles to the leading edge of a wing holds promise as a useful vortex generator for low speed flight and underwater applications.

IDENTIFYING IMPURITIES AND ION-EXCHANGE PURIFICATION FOR THE PRODUCTION OF BIODIESEL
Alexander Amaya
John T. Hoggard High School, Wilmington, NC

Biodiesel is a type of alternative fuel that is produced by transesterification of vegetable oils or animal fats. Biodiesel is quickly becoming one of the most popular alternatives to diesel fuel because of its many features, including great gas mileage, natural lubricator, and less sulfur. In my research I am identifying impurities using an NMR and purifying the biodiesel by way of ion-exchange, in order to identify and get rid of such impurities as glycerin, monoglycerin, diglycerides, and triglycerides. I am using an NMR in order to determine if using ion-exchange for the purification decreases the amount of impurities in the substance. I decided to purify 0.5 L, so based on the ratio I used .56 g of resin. I put the resin in a tube big enough to support the resin beads as they swell, but skinny enough to form a few layers. I only made one pass through the bed of resins, and tested to see if it reduced the percentage of impurities. The NMR proved useful to find the percentage of impurities in the solution of biodiesel, but it lacked a way to identify what the impurities were. But through my NMR spectrum, I found that there were fewer impurities in my ion-exchange batch than my water-wash batch. The water-wash method is a very good method for beginners and people who homebrew their biodiesel, but the future of purification lies in ways to minimize down-time, increases efficiency, and minimize cost. Right now the answer to that question lies in ion exchange resins, because it uses no water, only needs one or two passes through the bed of resins, it’s self-regenerated, and is relatively cheap.

WOODEN WONDER
Marco Francesco Facciola
St. Thomas High School, Pointe-Claire, Quebec, CANADA

The goal of my project was to see if it was possible to design a fully functional wooden bicycle. The idea came to me, after hearing stories about my grandfather’s adventures in World War II and how he had to make wooden wheels for his bicycle because of the shortage of rubber at the time.<br><br>As I embarked on this project I decided to first design the chain, because the dimensions of the chain determine the dimension of each proceeding part. I had to physically test each piece of the chain to withstand the required force. I then had to calculate the radius of each sprocket so that the teeth were perfectly spaced, otherwise the chain could slip off or possibly break.<br><br>I then proceeded to design the frame which I first got the dimensions from my bicycle. I then calculated every force on the different components. I the glued plants of wood, in certain grain direction to make the joining block’s as strong as possible.<br><br>I then made the wheels, the ratchet system, the pedals, handle bars…<br><br>The ratchet system allows me to coast with the bike. <br><br>After completing the bicycle I rode it and it worked well. I plan to upgrade it and make wooden brakes along with stabilizing the wheels. I plan on taking my design and making it more efficient by reducing the amount of material used for example making wooden tubing.

ADVANCED VERSION ANTI-DRINK DRIVING DEVICE (AVADD)
Kung-Ho Yu

Advanced Version Anti-drink Driving Device (AVADD)<br><br>In Hong Kong and around the world, numerous road accidents are caused by drink driving, leading to many minor and serious casualties and deaths. Currently in most cities, drivers are breathalyzed only after an accident or a driving offence. However, this would often come too late in preventing accidents at the first place.<br><br>This research is to confer and design an Advanced Version Anti-drink Driving Device (AVADD) to effectively prevent drink driving. The research proceeded according to the design process. After the tests, we analyzed the merits and the weaknesses of the products available in the market. We designed and made a competitive finished product. <br><br>AVADD will be a sophisticated and unique device. It consists of three components, a breathalyzer, a body sensor and an air-extracting device. By fitting a breathalyzer to the ignition system, the ignition will be automatically locked and vehicle cannot be started if the driver has a breath alcohol concentration above a pre-set safety level. The sensor is installed on the steering wheel to ensure drivers grip the wheel instead of holding other devices, such as air plumps that may possibly cheat the system. The air-extracting apparatus is an independent testing device which constantly checks the alcohol vapour concentration level inside the vehicle to avoid others starting the cars. If it detects a high concentration level, it will set off an indicator to alert other drivers and the police. The effectiveness of AVADD is surely better than any other similar products in the market.

THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF ETHANOL FROM BIOMASS VIA GENES OF CLOSTRIDIA
Sujay Tyle
Pittsford Mendon High School, Pittsford, NY

Current ethanol production is slow and cannot utilize all parts of biomass (lignocellulose and hemicellulose). Thus, complete biomass conversion to ethanol as a liquid fuel by the thermophilic and anaerobic Clostridium thermocellum offers a novel solution to the world's current dependence on petroleum. However, when utilizing the whole organism, degradation products such as lactates and acetates are formed, slowing ethanol production. The solution is finding which gene of C. thermocellum is responsible for one-step biodegradation into ethanol, and utilizing that gene - thereby eliminating the drawbacks. With the investigations reported here, ethanol could cost less than $0.25/gallon, and be viable for sustainable development. <br><br> The largest cellulosomal gene cluster of C. thermocellum was found, containing Genes 1-5. Sequence Homology found that Genes 2 and 5 contained properties similar to cellulases, enzymes responsible for the biodegradation. These genes were cloned, and their proteins were expressed, as verified by electrophoresis. The reducing sugars assay on various hemicellulosics and crystalline cellulose indicated Gene 5 was responsible for the significant breakdown of crystalline cellulose, Avicel, linking Gene 5 to a rare exo-enzyme. Utilizing a turbidity analytical technique on Avicel, Gene 5 was found to have significantly more degradation abilities than C. thermocellum. <br><br> Thus, Gene 5 could be utilized as the enzyme to produce ethanol from biomass, which could serve as the key to the global energy crisis. Thus a novel, cost-effective, efficient, one-step technology which reduces emissions and byproducts, making it environmentally friendly, and creates new jobs for industrial ethanol production, has been developed.

CH4 OPTIMIZATION OF BIO-WASTE VIA MICROBIAL FUEL CELL CONTROL
Llewellyn Timothy Falla
Northern Collegiate Institute & Vocational School, Sarnia

Microbial fuel cell (MFC) pioneer Bruce Logan stated “energy is the single greatest environmental challenge facing humanity”. The time is now to identify and develop an energy portfolio that includes carbon-neutral and renewable energy systems. Potential systems include the generation of methane gas from the anaerobic decomposition of animal waste. <br><br>In my previous work, methane gas was generated from the anaerobic decomposition of dairy cow manure. It was found that methane gas production stopped when the pH of the animal waste reached 5.3. Further to my previous study, I have now experimentally determined the optimum pH for gas generation to be between 6 and 8. It was hypothesized that if the pH of the animal waste was controlled by the removal of hydrogen ions, then methane production would be maximized. <br><br>A home designed two chambered MFC was used with a Nafion®-117 Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM). The PEM was used to transfer hydrogen ions out of the anode chamber and into the cathode chamber. Increased gas production was evident with the use of the MFC. A larger surface area of the anode electrode also resulted in increased gas production and greater voltage. However, the significant excess of other cations present in the anode chamber dominated the PEM efficiency. In this study it was shown that it is possible to simultaneously generate methane gas and electricity using a MFC.

AERODYNAMIC EFFICIENCY: REDUCING FUEL EMISSIONS THROUGH INNOVATIVE AIRCRAFT DESIGN
Philip Laurenz Riessner
Bert Bowes Junior Secondary School, Fort St. John, British Columbia, CANADA

Between 2.7% and 3.5% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions are produced by commercial aircraft, the configuration of which has not changed much in the past forty years. Between ten and thirty percent of these emissions result during takeoff, the bulk occurring at higher altitudes. The purpose of this experiment was therefore to design an aerodynamic aircraft that would reduce fuel emissions and increase fuel efficiency during take-off, by generating greater lift, and at cruising speeds, by reducing drag. Five balsa-frame planes were built, four of which were my own original designs incorporating research into body shape, wing design and tail configuration. The fifth was a model of the standard plane, against which the innovative aircraft were tested in a wind tunnel at angles of attack of 0°, 16° and 35° and wind speeds of 25kph, 40kph and 55kph. Each test was done three times for accuracy, resulting in a total of 270 tests. Measurements were recorded using a Dual Range Force Sensor connected to a laptop; results were verified using Computational Fluid Dynamics. Results confirmed my hypothesis that the teardrop-shaped aircraft, the Arrow (lift/drag ratio of 3.41), outperformed the Standard plane (3.14). Performing third was the Scorpion (forward-swept flying wing with delta wing tail) with 1.77 followed by the Dauntless (flying wing) with 1.01 and the Ace (A-frame, forward-swept flying wing) with 0.35. Due to its aerodynamic shape, aircraft such as the Arrow would reduce fuel emissions and, the simple teardrop shape would be inexpensive to build.

PASSIONATE PASSIVITY: DEVELOPMENT OF A HIGH-PRECISION PASSIVE PHOTOVOLTAIC PANEL TRACKING SYSTEM
Eden W. Full
John G. Diefenbaker High School, Calgary, Alberta, CANADA

Conventional active photovoltaic panel tracking systems require complex and expensive maintenance, while current passive tracking techniques are imprecise, slow and environmentally-hazardous due to their chemical vapourization processes. Thus, both systems are respectively impractical when frequent maintenance demands cannot be met and efficiency is very low. Passionate Passivity develops a novel high-precision and fast-reactive passive photovoltaic panel tracking system that optimizes solar radiation collection through bimetallic thermal expansion, hydraulic restrictor control and dual-axis flexibility, decreasing calibration complexity for applications using maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms. This environmentally-friendly system is the first to introduce dual-axis tracking in passive methods, constructed from common, cost-effective materials. A scaled functional model is assembled to analyze angle alignment accuracy, efficiency and net power output of the design, under a controlled seven-hour exposure environment of artificial light conditions simulating standard temperatures and geographically-proportionate solar movement. The hydraulic restrictor control employs calculations and physical testing to ensure system optimization in a created mathematical computer model, allowing for geographic latitudes, MPPT algorithms and additional data to be inputted for basic calibration. The designed passive system optimizes energy collection, matching conventional active tracking in virtually 100% efficiency according to the panel rated output, while decreasing maintenance frequency and complexity. Results indicate that full angle alignment accuracy has been achieved. Utilizing the calibration model, Passionate Passivity proves to be a potential cost-effective, environmentally-friendly, yet simple solution to optimized tracking in photovoltaic panel systems, particularly for developing countries and mass energy farms in sustainable development.

HOVER! A STUDY ON THE DESIGN OF HOVERCRAFTS
Spencer Paul Rhoton
Burkburnett High School, Burkburnett, TX

The purpose of this project is to find what design of hovercraft is best suited to recreational activities on land. This will provide helpful information to hovercraft enthusiasts and hobbyists who are looking to build a hovercraft for recreational use. I have hypothesized that the most simple, lightweight, and circular design will make the best (based on hover distance and load capacity) recreational hovercraft.<br><br> What design makes the best recreational hovercraft was answered by building three small versions of hovercrafts, just big enough to ride, with differently shaped bases. The hovercrafts were placed on different surfaces, given different loads, and tested to see how movable on that surface they were. Then this data was analyzed and the best shape concluded upon.<br><br> Along the way I found out that in addition to the shape of the hovercraft the skirt and weight distribution are extremely important aspects of the design. The shape can affect both of these factors, but they can also work independently meaning more research could easily be done on this subject.<br><br> My initial hypothesis was incorrect, that the most simple, lightweight, and circular design would make the best (based on hover distance and load capacity) recreational hovercraft. I found this to be untrue because the most consistent in the load to hover distance tests and the most moveable craft was the rounded rectangle design which is not the most simple or circular design I tested.

AMELIORATING OBSTACLES TO THE COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION OF THE DIRECT METHANOL FUEL CELL
Joseph Ghilarducci O'Rourke
John Adams High School, South Bend, IN

The Direct Methanol Fuel Cell (DMFC) is a renewable, relatively non-polluting alternative energy source that is capable of fulfilling rapidly growing world demand. The primary remaining obstacles to mass-production are methanol crossover, carbon monoxide poisoning of the catalysts, and carbon dioxide evolution at the anode. Data show that it is possible to overcome current barriers to DMFC utilization. The various examined techniques could be used to produce a cost-effective and renewable energy source. <br><br>The effects of methanol concentration and environmental temperature on DMFC power output were examined. The relationship between temperature and mass transfer and crossover evaporation was also explored. Gold aids in the oxidation of water to ameliorate carbon monoxide poisoning and increases oxygen reduction rates. Methanol concentration and temperature trials were repeated with Au-retrofitted DMFCs and compared to the standard DMFC. Potential curves for both DMFCs were generated and compared. Generally, the addition of gold yielded dramatic increases in power output. <br><br>The influence of a methanol fuel flow of various rates through the anode chamber was investigated. Effects of hydrogen peroxide, an oxidant of carbon monoxide, on power output were also studied. DMFCs were fueled passively with various concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. Long-term studies featuring hydrogen peroxide actively added to a fuel solution after some hours of operation were also conducted. These experiments were modeled with a differential equation. Data show that hydrogen peroxide usage is only beneficial under certain conditions because of its rapid decomposition on platinum and especially gold catalysts.

THE EFFECT OF TIDAL GENERATOR DESIGN ON POWER OUTPUT
Michael S Finneran
Chantilly High School, Chantilly, VA

Alternate sources of power must be developed to replace fossil fuels that are quickly being depleted and are harmful to the environment. This project harnesses kinetic energy found in the oceans’ tides and converts this energy to electric power. Ample research has been done using the energy created by the in and out motion of the tides but the unique aspect of this project captured the kinetic energy found in the rise and fall of the tides. The project simulated the rise and fall movement of the oceans’ tides, the development of a float and pivot arm assembly, and the creation of three drive shaft designs. A challenging aspect of the design dealt with ensuring the drive shaft turned continually in the same direction during the entire rise and fall tidal cycle. This was critical to optimize the collection of energy. The control case consisted of a direct connect drive shaft that provided a continuous flow of electrical current output measured in milliamps. Two other drive shaft designs were evaluated including a string and weight design and a spring design that both accumulated and stored the converted kinetic energy as potential energy over several tidal cycles. The stored energy in the string and weight, and spring drive shaft designs was released and converted to useable electrical power upon demand when needed. The resultant data proved my hypothesis that the most efficient design was the string and weight driveshaft. Power output indicated that further research should be done in this field.

THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT ENZYMES ON THE CONVERSION OF CELLULOSIC BIOMASS TO SUGAR
Abhinav Ram Mohan
Chantilly High School, Chantilly, VA

The current project evaluates the effect of three different enzymes in the conversion of cellulosic biomass (tapioca) to sugar. The initial idea was to determine which type of enzyme used had an effect on the amount of sugar produced from the cellulose of tapioca. Success with the enzymes and the enzymatic conversion of tapioca cellulose to sugar eventually led to experimentation to compare the efficiency of sugar production from corn to that of tapioca because the sugar produced can eventually be used to produce ethanol.<br><br> Three trials were done with the cellulose of tapioca and one with corn. Alpha Amylase, Bacterial Amylase, and Amyloglucosidase were the enzymes used in this experiment. The amount of the sugar made was measured in terms of percentage yield of the cellulosic crop, in this case Tapioca. The effective concentration of 2.00mL of Bacterial Amylase was found to yield 62% sugar from the cellulose of tapioca. The amount of cellulosic biomass used was relative to the amount of sugar produced in the end. In the final comparison between corn starch and the cellulose of tapioca, tapioca produced 9.50% more sugar than corn starch. The enzyme Bacterial Amylase assisted in producing the most sugar in all of these trials.<br><br> The contributions of this project are twofold. First, the amount of sugar produced by the cellulose of tapioca was found to be equal to that reported in the literature (by barrel at 331.490 kilograms). Second, for 7 grams of sugar used, 3.6 grams of ethanol was produced. Corn is a staple food in many countries, and if corn is continually used to make ethanol, it would eventually lead to a greater price hike due to the obvious risk of its scarcity. The recent increase in oil and commodity prices only makes cassava-based ethanol more viable and an economical choice.

ELECTR-YEAST-ITY; AN INVESTIGATION IN ELECTRICITY PRODUCTION IN SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE
Arfa Nawal Aijazi
South Lakes High School, Reston, VA

Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) hold promise as a sustainable biotechnological solution to future energy needs. The MFC constructed has two compartments, the anode and the cathode, divided by a proton-exchange membrane. The anode contains an aqueous solution of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and a carbohydrate substrate, while the cathode contains distilled water and is exposed to oxygen. The conditions present in the anode allow the yeast to undergo cellular respiration. As the anode has limited oxygen (the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain), a metal electrode accepts electrons from the reaction, while the positive ions continue to flow into the cathode. This results in a negative charge buildup in the anode and a positive charge buildup in the cathode, a difference in electrical potential that results in voltage. The purpose of this research was to determine the best electrode, the best substrate, and the relationship between the substrate type and the rate of respiration. Six metal electrodes were tested: copper, aluminum, zinc, nickel, tin, and lead and four substrates were tested: dextrose, fructose, sucrose, lactose. The results show that as the resistivity increases, the voltage decreases, confirming that materials of higher resistivities inhibit the flow of electrical charge. The use of monosaccharides (dextrose and fructose) yielded higher voltages and higher CO2 outputs (indicator of cellular respiration) while, disaccharides (sucrose and lactose) were either unable to be metabolized or metabolized less effectively by the yeast. These results further indicate the potential of yeast as an alternate energy fuel.

Activity assays in 0.015M Mg+2 demonstrated a linear observed rate of 0.0024 AU/min in the presence of 0.122 mg Cellulase which represents a rate of 0.0237 moles glucose/min and a specific activity of 0.068 The objective of this experiment was to investigate a plan outlined by President Bush in his 2007 State of the Union address to trim the US dependency on foreign oil by increasing research on alternative fuels. Cellulosic ethanol that originates from perennial grasses as Cellulose is one such alternative fuel, however, it’s commercial availability is plagued at this time by the slow hydrolysis of Cellulose by the enzyme Cellulase. This project investigates the possibility of increasing the catalytic rate of Cellulase on hydroxyethyl cellulose with a divalent cation cofactor (Mg+2). A new variation of a colorimetric assay was developed beginning with the preparation of a standard plot that correlated the production of glucose. The slope of this line provided the response expected for the liberation of glucose from Cellulose in the activity assays and was found to be 0.1014 AU per micromole glucose. Activity assays in the absence of magnesium illustrated a linear observed rate of 0.0025 AU per minute with 0.364 mg Cellulase enzyme. Taken together with the slope of the standard curve, this demonstrated an activity of 0.0247

The purpose of this project was to find an alternate fuel to be used for heating homes in place of coal, oil, natural gas, wood, and propane.<br><br> To conduct my research I first collected the cattail grass, smooth brome grass, and oat straw. I then spread the grasses and straw across separate flat surfaces to allow them to dry evenly. I then collected the rabbit, goat, and cattle manures. These were spread across separate flat surfaces to allow them to dry evenly as well. The grasses, straw, and manures were stirred every day until they dried evenly.<br><br> The burning portion of this project was done by measuring 50mL of water into the pan. The sample was then weighed, recorded, and placed in the burning dish. The starting temperature of the water was then recorded and the sample was lit with a burning stick. Once the flames settled the highest change in the temperature of the water was recorded. The steps for burning were repeated for each sample and combined sample.<br><br> In conclusion the cattail grass proved to burn at the highest average temperature and produced the highest average amount of calories. The oat straw had the next highest average temperature and average calories produced. The smooth brome grass was the lowest of the grasses for temperature and calories produced.<br><br> The manures had the lowest temperatures, and produced the least amount of calories but burned the longest.<br><br> None of the combined samples produced more calories than the individual grasses or manures.

PURPOSE: To produce biodiesel from canola and sunflower seed oils. Secondly, to chemically analyze the biodiesel derived from canola and sunflower oils. Finally, to test the fuel efficiency and heat output of the biodiesel.<br><br>PROCEDURES: Collected five gallons of four different types of seed oils (refined canola, unrefined canola, refined sunflower, and unrefined sunflower). Obtained methanol and potassium hydroxide. <br><br>Biodiesel Preparation: Prepared eight gallons of biodiesel by adding the proper quantities of seed oil, methanol, and potassium hydroxide to a beaker while stirring and adding heat. Completed the process by washing the biodiesel. <br><br>Chemical Analysis: Tested the Kinematic Viscosity, Pour Point, Oxidative Stability, Moisture Content, Acid Value, and Specific Gravity of the biodiesels in addition to performing a basic viscosity test. <br><br>Fuel Efficiency and Heat Output: Used a Reddy Heater and a Raytek® Non-Contact Temperature Gun to determine the heat output and fuel efficiency of the biodiesels.<br><br>CONCLUSION: In the chemical analysis, I found that the Refined Canola biodiesel met the specifications for the ASTM standards the best, while Unrefined Sunflower met the fewest ASTM standards. In the fuel efficiency and heat output tests, Unrefined Sunflower had the best fuel efficiency and the highest average heat output, while Refined Canola was the least fuel efficient biodiesel and had the lowest heat output. The overall best biodiesel was Refined Sunflower, while Unrefined Canola was the lowest quality biodiesel. Overall, I feel that biodiesel is an excellent substitute to petroleum diesel and has many potential applications other than the traditional diesel engine.

THE USE OF ANTENNA PIGMENTS FROM MARINE ALGAE FOR SENSITIZATION OF PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS
Ashiyah Melyne Cays-Vesterby
Sequim High School, Sequim, WA

Solar energy is essentially inexhaustible, available worldwide and gnenerates no harmful pollutants. Solar cells are devices which convert energy from the sun into electricity through the photovoltaic (PV) effect. Most current PV cells are made of silicon. Other proposed cells include thin film semiconductors and dye-sensitized Gratzel cells. Gratzel cells produce enrgy by a method similar to photosynthesis. Goals of this research focused on dyd-sensitized photovoltaic cells: analysis of antenna pigments from marine algae for light absorption capacity, evalutaiton of pigments and semiconductor materials for masimum voltage production under open circuit conditions, and determination of the maximum power generated under closed circuit conditions, and determination of the maximum power generated under closed circuit conditions by the optimum combination of pigments and semicondctors.<br><br>Antenna pigments representing three algae Divisions (Chlorophyta, Phaeophta, Rhodophyta) were extracted and evaluated for light absorbance maxima. Dye-sensitized Gratzel cells were constructed using extracted pigments. Tests sere run on combinations of pigment extracts and semiconductor materials (titanium dioxide, zeolite, 50/50 mixture) under open circuit conditions. Closed circuit tests were then run using the semiconductor titanium dioxide and pigment extracts. Power curves were plotted and the maxima evaluated. Algal chlorophylls from green algae showed a 17% higher power output than phycobilins from red algae.<br><br>Gratzel cells sensitized with marine algae antenna pigments appear to exhibit 10% of the power output of silicon cells. Construction of these Gratzel cells is 10% the cost of silicon cells. Unlike silicon cells, they exhibit power output under very low light conditions and retain a charge after the light source is removed.

THE EFFECT OF WINGLETS ON SINGLE SURFACE--FLEX WING--HANG GLIDER INDUCED DRAG
Ariel Lyn Evans
Sussex Central High School, Georgetown, DE

This project represents the first of three steps in developing a winglet for a Falcon 2, single surface, flex wing hang glider. This is an attempt to reduce wing tip vortex induced drag and increase reach of the aircraft. In this initial phase I studied the fluid dynamics of a Falcon 2 wing, in a water tunnel of my design, and tested my first prototype winglet.<br><br> I constructed a model wing from aluminum sheeting, attached streamers to the trailing edge and recorded the observed flow rear of the trailing edge at 0, 5, 10, & 15 degrees positive pitch. I then fitted my test model with prototype winglet #1 and recorded the change in fluid flow rear of the wing at the same angles of attack. The data collected was visual and recorded as such.<br><br> Test winglet #1 did alter the wing tip vortices on my test model. The vortex was moved further back behind the trailing edge, smaller in size, and its onset delayed. However, the addition of the winglet caused stalling of the wing at a lower angle of attack, more induced drag across the wing as a whole, and possible instability in flight.<br><br> In conclusion, test winglet #1 has shown that wing tip vortices can be affected on single surface hang gliders by the addition of winglets. In phase two I will attempt to improve aerodynamic performance of the wing / winglet combination.

MINIMIZING THE VOLUME OF THE UNKNOWN REGION OF POSSIBLE SV POSITION PROBABLILITY DENSITY DISTRIBUTIONS: APPLYING ELECTROMAGNETIC EMISSIONS OF MULTIPLE CELESTIAL BODIES TO OPTIMIZE THE ACCURACY OF A UNIVERSAL POSITIONING SYSTEM
David Benjamin McMillon
Saginaw Arts & Sciences Academy, Saginaw, MI

This research optimizes the accuracy of a new, innovative Universal Positioning System (UPS), which is similar in ways to a modern Global Positioning Systems (GPS). Instead of using timing-based pseudoranges from signals from satellites, this UPS consists of a detector onboard a [lost] space vehicle that applies the electromagnetic emissions coming from many celestial bodies for pseudorange measurements. For any trilateration system, accuracy depends on two factors: the Pseudorange [quality] Factor, and the Geometry [quality] Factor, or the geometrical configuration of the emitter positions relative to the space vehicle position.<br><br>Included are two mathematical proofs and five experiments in which calibrated instruments representing the real situation; for example, a halogen bulb represented a star, and was placed in multiple positions while being detected by a solar cell, representing the position of the detector onboard the space vehicle. In the first experiment both the Inverse Square Law and Parallax methods were examined as potentials to improve the accuracy of the Pseudorange Factor. The second experiment modeled the importance of the pseudorange measurement by showing how increasing pseudorange qualities yield increasing position estimation accuracy. Experiment Three showed the importance of the Geometry Factor; the results implied that having better quality pseudorange measurements does not necessarily improve accuracy when the Geometry Factor is poor; therefore, being extremely important, accuracy can be increased greatly with an optimal Geometry Factor. The fourth experiment proved that if and only if a pseudorange error is present, adding celestial emitters increases accuracy by optimizing the Geometry Factor. Finally, the fifth experiment showed how calculus-based iteration techniques cause the improved estimated position to converge to a value very close to the true position.<br><br>This is successful research, showing that the Parallax Method, optimal geometry, great numbers of celestial emitters, and these iteration techniques can vastly improve the accuracy of the system. The great advantage this UPS has over GPS is that its Geometry Factor can be optimized, and can be used throughout much of the universe.

DEFLECTION OVER DISASTER: METAL DEFLECTION DEVICES TO PREVENT AIRPLANE ENGINE DESTRUCTION, PHASE II
Katrina Jane Stine
Hilton Head Preparatory School, Hilton Head Island, SC

A self designed metal deflection device was created last year in order to minimize the damage to airplane engines during collisions with birds. The purpose of this year's experimentation was to test that same device's impact on the aerodynamics of the engine. The device was placed in a homemade wind tunnel to determine the turbulence created by the device as air moved through it at high speeds. This experiment was conducted by attaching ribbons on the device and a leaf blower was used to create 289km/h winds aimed at the center of the device. In addition, tests using a spring scale determined how much drag the device created. The drag was measured by suspending the device while it was hooked to a spring scale and the leaf blower was utilized to create the high velocity winds. The metal deflection device was also tested using a tennis ball machine (individual balls simulated birds) and proportional cutouts of the wing and cabin of the aircraft to see if the tennis balls would hit either the cabin or wing when fired at the device, which was rotated with the point up and to the right. This experimental design was used to model real life bird collisions with aircraft engines. The collision testing occurred when the device was mounted on a fence with scale cut outs of the wing and cabin placed accordingly on the fence. Tennis balls were fired at the center of the device and the deflections were recorded. <br><br> Overall the wind tunnel testing was successful because the air was able to flow quickly and smoothly around the device and the drag testing showed that the device caused 1.3 Newtons of air resistance. Also the majority of tennis balls, 83%, deflected down and away from the wing and cabin. Overall this innovative device proves to be an inexpensive and efficient means of protecting airplane engines and passengers from a potential disaster.

A NOVEL PROCESS TO HIGHLY IMPROVE THE BIOETHANOL PRODUCTION
Christoffer Norn
Lyngby Technical High School, Kgs. Lyngby, DENMARK

In 2007 the bioethanol-industry produced 24.5 billion liters of ethanol and 15.4 billion kg of distillers dried grain with solubles (DDGS) – a left-over which can be used for livestock feeding. This co-product does however contain enough carbohydrates to increase the total bioethanol production by 12.2%, thus giving it a huge potential impact on the process economy. <br><br>The current application of DDGS is associated with a series of problems (high content of fibers, sulfur, phosphorous, possible presence of mycotoxins and high batch variation), that reduces its market value. To avoid some of these problems and to increase the bioethanol production, I have developed a novel protease-based process for simultaneous pretreatment of fibers and protein extraction. This new method can also be used for non-corn derived DDGS.<br><br>The pretreatment increased the yield of C5/C6-sugars during an enzymatic hydrolysis with a factor of 3.3 and 1.7, respectively.<br><br>By screening eight different commercial enzyme products, three were chosen for the hydrolysis of pretreated fibers. Different reaction conditions, i.e. enzyme ratio, pH, temperature, enzyme dosage and reaction time were evaluated with response surface and ternary mixture designs. Using optimal conditions, a total sugar yield of 58% was obtained.<br><br>The hydrolyzed DDGS was readily fermented with Saccharomyces cerevisiae giving approx. 94% yield based upon fermentation of glucose derived from cellulose. <br><br>The proteolysate enhanced the hydrolysis of the pretreated fibers, resulting in approx. 87% sugar yield, which is very promising for future development.<br><br>Next step is to characterize which substance(s) is/are responsible for this important effect.

THE AIR BATTERY
Joseph Christopher Church
Woodrow Wilson Senior High School, Washington, DC

The Air Battery<br><br>Abstract:<br><br> The purpose of this experiment was to design an apparatus that could store energy in the form of compressed air. The final apparatus would be an air battery in which charging and discharging would be in the form of electrical current. I hypothesized that if I could create a prototype of such a device, then I would be able to demonstrate the practicality of this type of storage battery. <br><br> During the course of this experiment I created numerous prototypes based on a design of my own invention that utilized a steel canister connected to a single turbine/pump, mechanically coupled to a generator/motor. When the compressed air is released through the turbine, the generator outputs electrical current. If perfected, the process could operate in reverse as a motor driven pump. The latest prototype is a functioning, self-contained battery and a means of discharge. Due to the complexity of pump designs, recharging the compressed air battery is limited to manually recharging with an external hand pump. <br><br> Initially, a modest overall efficiency of just under 0.50% was reached for the discharging process, with the turbine operating at 1.14% efficiency, and the generator at 43.3%. Refinements are being evaluated.<br><br> The resulting apparatus demonstrates that energy can be stored in the form of compressed air. The experimental results suggest that the design has potential for practical application. Throughout my experimentation, I was able to identify numerous areas where improvements could be made.

THE EFFECT OF ANGLED WINGLETS ON AERODYNAMIC LIFT
Morgan J Watson - Morris
John Jay Science and Engineering Academy, San Antonio, TX

Aerodynamic lift is created by unequal air pressure as an aerofoil travels through air. A winglet is a small, usually vertical, wingtip extension used to combat drag-inducing vortices. Last year’s experiment showed that downward facing winglets increase lift more than upward facing winglets. This year, the effect of adding downward facing winglets, at different angles, on the amount of aerodynamic-lift generated is investigated.<br><br> Planes were tested in a homemade variable wind speed wind tunnel. To control for the lift generated by different lifting areas on the wing, winglets were designed and cut so that the vertical lifting area was the same size and shape for all of the planes regardless of winglet angle. To control for differences in weight among the planes, lift is calculated as: plane weight divided by wind speed. <br><br> One plane was tested without alteration, five planes were tested with and without winglets, each trial provided fifty observations of wind speed (measured in volts generated by an impeller) taken at 10 second intervals during flight. <br><br> Using data from the unaltered plane, results from all other planes were calibrated. The differences in plane lift ratios showed that winglet angle affected the lift generated. However, the optimum winglet angle is 75° not 90°.<br><br> Fitting winglets at the appropriate winglet angle could result in planes being able to (i) go farther and faster, (ii) carry more weight on the same amount of fuel, and (iii) take off and land in less space and at lower, safer, speeds than at present.

FROM BIOMASS TO ETHANOL: USING TRANSFORMED YEAST SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE FOR CELLULOSIC DEGRADATION AND ETHANOL FERMENTATION
Junxing Chen
Clayton Valley High School, Concord, CA

One of the biggest obstacles in current cellulosic ethanol production is the initial conversion of cellulose into sugar before the yeast converts the sugar into ethanol through fermentation. Thus, the goal in this project is to genetically engineer the fermentative yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae using cellulase genes so it can degrade cellulose and ferment ethanol in a one-step process.<br><br>Cellulases that catalyze the process of cellulolysis are found in white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium and brown rot fungus Postia placenta. Such cellulase genes CelF (endocellulase), CBH1(cellobiohydrolases), and BGL1 (beta-glucosidases) that can disrupt the crystalline cellulose into monosaccharides will be amplified from pure brown rot fungus DNA and genetically knocked into the genome of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The PCR reaction replicates CelF, CBH1, and BGL1 with the flanking sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes MAL1, HIS3 and RAD1 as overhangs. During transformation the cellulase gene cassette with its flanking sequences will target a homologous recombination to replace the yeast genes MAL1, HIS3 and RAD1.<br><br>The yeast was incubated at 37 degree on growth medium Yeast Extract Dextrose and cellulose medium after recovering in SOC broth. After two weeks all growth mediums showed distinct colonies of growth. This result indicated that cellulose degradation and fermentation of cellulose to ethanol are carried out by recombinant yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae displaying cellulolytic enzymes.

HYDROGEN: IT'S ALL DOWN HILL
Christy Marie Farnsworth
Paonia Senior High School, Paonia, CO

The purpose of this experiment was to show that regenerative braking in a truck does generate significant electricity which could be run through an electrolyzer and stored as hydrogen. To conduct this experiment a trailer was redesigned and upgraded to simulate regenerative braking at a 1;40 scale. The 4 wheeler/trailer combination weighed 1 ton, while a semi weighs 40 tons. Trial runs were conducted on a 2.5 mile section of road with a 7% grade. Next, an electrolyzer which could handle 4 v DC was used to turn electricity into hydrogen. It was a 1:25 ratio for the electricity used in the electrolyzer versus the electricity generated in a trial run with my model. The hands on trial run of this trailer shows that the amount of electricity generated by trucks with regenerative braking descending from west bound Eisenhower Tunnel and Vail Pass could be used to power the County of Delta, Colorado; a population of 31,000. If converted to hydrogen, one truck would generate 50,000 cubic centimeters of hydrogen per minute. The magnitude of the effect that regenerative braking in trucks can have on the world today is truly amazing. This is just two passes in Colorado. The results of this experiment indicate that my hypothesis should be accepted that a truck with regenerative braking can travel down a slope and convert the braking energy to hydrogen for later conversion to electricity or to be used as hydrogen.

THE MOTION OF THE OCEAN: A STUDY OF WAVE ENERGY ON ST. CROIX
Ashlee Erica Douglas
The Good Hope School, Frederiksted, St. Croix, VIRGIN ISLANDS

Energy is a major component in human life, like carbon and water. A major topic discussed today is the depletion of fossil fuels and finding other alternatives to supply energy needs, while also not degrading the environment. One possible alternative energy source is ocean energy. The objective of this experiment is to find out if there are any potential areas surrounding St. Croix that have enough wave energy to produce a substantial supply of potential power. The hypothesis was if there was an area that had a minimum of 5,000 W/m, then that area was suitable for power generation. The basic materials used were the wave height measuring device, the wave counter, and a life boat. The main procedure was going to the beach locations and going out a distance of 15 meters and at the shoreline and counting the number of waves that passed through a certain point in 1 hour and measuring the height of 50 waves. These two pieces of data were used in the wave energy formula:<br><br>P= p x g^2 x a^2 x T<br><br>_____________<br><br>8 x pi<br><br>The results showed that Hay Penny (South shore) had the most potential power with 2363 W/m, Butler’s Bay (West) had 948 W/m, Cane Bay (North) had 329 W/m, Solitude Bay (North-east) had 225 W/m, and Rust op Twist (North) had 222 W/m. In conclusion, the locations studied did not create a substantial about of potential power, but further studies may find more potential power in locations farther from shore and locations outside the reefs. St. Croix is surrounded by waves; why not use this energy source that is just waiting to be harnessed?

MAXIMUM DELIVERED SPECIFIC IMPULSE
Richard William Bertrand
Wellington High School, Wellington, FL

The purpose of this project was to find the most efficient formulation of rocket propellant. It was hypothesized that by increasing the percentage of 325 mesh atomized aluminum in the formulation, the resulting propellant would burn hotter and ultimately more efficient. This results in an increase in thrust. this increase in thrust would continue to occur to a certain percentage where the thrust curve would plateau and the most efficient formulation would be achieved. This formulation is only the most efficient for a given casing dimension, therefore, formulations must be tailored for a specific rocket motor.<br><br>Procedures were to mix formulations with varying amounts of the 325 mesh atomized aluminum, and simply test fire each formulation on a digital load cell and calculate the delivered specific impulse. The formulation with the highest delivered specific impulse is most efficient. <br><br>There are several real world applications for this project. First, the most efficient propellant can loft heavier rockets higher. This propellant complies with BATFE regulations in the amounts that the researcher is making and can be used in the researcher's high power rocketry projects without goverment storage restrictions.

"JUST A DROP IN THE OCEAN?" AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAPACITY OF THE MARINE ALGAE DUNALIELLA TERTIOLECTA TO SEQUESTER ATMOSPHERIC CARBON DIOXIDE AND PRODUCE PLANT BIOMASS FOR BIO-DIESEL PRODUCTION
Storm Holwill
Marist Regional College, Burnie, Tasmania, AUSTRALIA

This investigation estimated the capacity of micro-algae to sequester atmospheric CO2, while producing plant bio-mass (for bio-diesel) without the use of land-space or freshwater. The algal species Dunaliella tertiolecta was selected because it was robust and likely to withstand experimentation.<br><br>Flasks containing 95 mL of seawater were seeded with 5 mL of culture, enriched with nutrients and grown for 5, 10, 15 and 20 days. Flasks were then removed and algal growth calculated. Flasks, carbonated with excess CO2, were incubated simultaneously. <br><br>Algal growth was estimated by two methods. Dry mass yield was found by filtering algae and drying in an oven. Growth was also determined by cell count, using a disposable haemacytometer.<br><br>Algal dry-mass increased with days of incubation for both uncarbonated and carbonated samples. Carbonated samples, however, achieved greater dry-mass gain over 20 days (0.334 g versus 0.314 g). Algae incubated without nutrients experienced dry-mass decrease, indicating the necessity for nutrient enrichment.<br><br>The creation of plant bio-mass in a marine environment means that land-space and freshwater are rendered unnecessary. Scaled-up calculations demonstrate that an algal bio-reactor of capacity 20,000,000 L could produce 285 tonnes of bio-mass over 20 days when carbonated; some 3.4 tonnes more than when uncarbonated. Sequestering capacity is 30.6 tonnes of CO2, or 1.6 tonnes more than if uncarbonated.<br><br>The CO2 could be trapped from industrial sources and algae could be collected and used for production of bio-diesel. Algal bio-reactors could therefore be employed as a means of reducing greenhouse gases, which would help curb global warming.

This project was to help find an alternative energy source. We explored multiple options and found Solar Updraft Citadels. We wanted to test the efficiency of a tower and the different variables that affected the efficiency of the citadel. We tested the citadel in different conditions including temperature and humidity we also test many variables and types and models of citadels.<br><br>We took air velocity samples from the top of the ducts from different lengths that we can control and alter. WE tested velocities from our two models<br><br>We found that a taller tube was more effective. Also the air velocity was greater with the range of temperature from inside our heated chamber compared to the outside temperature.<br><br>We hoped this project would prove that we have alternate energy source that we haven't tapped into yet. The air flow we found with our citadel is more than the reported results (15 meters per second) based on the scale model. With a bigger collecting area we can increase the air velocity and make our tower become more efficient.

THE USE OF NATURAL SYNTHETIC CANDLE WAX TO IMPROVE THE TEMPERATURE AND PROPULSION RATE OF A SPACECRAFT PROTOTYPE
Stefania Colon-Cabrera, Natalia Rodriguez Burgos, 
Colegio De La Salle, Bayamon, Toa Alta, PUERTO RICO

The idea was obtained from an investigation in NASA with wax as a source of combustion for propulsion for rockets. The purpose for this investigation is to prove that wax (paraffin or soy) can function as a source of combustion to recreate propulsion and observe distance ran by aluminum can. The relation that exists between types of wax and time to reach its flash point was studied. It was proposed that if there exists any effect between the type of wax as a source of combustion and propulsion that generates in an aluminum can, then when using paraffin, higher the propulsion it generates. It was proposed that if their exists any relation between the types of wax over the temperature it generates and time to reach its flash point, then paraffin will generate higher temperature and higher speed to reach its flash point. In the prototype an aluminum can was used for each wax and was placed with two cables so there wouldn’t be friction with the stainless steel tube. Under the can a heater of methanol gel is placed to keep the can hot to melt the wax. The nosel in the can is used to let oxygen through. The paraffin wax ran a distance of 2cm in 240s and a temperature of 104 C. The soy wax in 145s and a temperature of 77 C didn’t produce propulsion. The data obtained tends to suggest that paraffin is better than soy as a source of combustion. Thus the hypothesis is sustained.

SALINE TOLERANCE & PRODUCTIVITY OF LIPID PRODUCING DIATOMS: NEW FORMS OF ENERGY & ECONOMICS FOR THE NEO-PERMIAN BASIN? RESEARCH ON BIO-FUEL PRODUCTION ALTERNATIVES ON CONSERVATION OF FRESHWATER/ CROPLAND RESOURCES
Ford Blake Carty, Vaughn Hurst Carty, 
Rio Rancho High School, Rio Rancho, NM

In the era of environmental awareness, water conservation, cropland preservation, and alternative energy sources are critical for our nation. One potential solution is bio-fuel from lipid-producing algae. Since algae grow well with sunshine, moderate temperatures, CO2, and have lower requirements for water resources and nutrients, the problem to be addressed was: Is an algae bio-fuel production facility economically feasible for the Permian Basin region of New Mexico? <br><br> Due to availability of a non-potable, saline water source in the Permian Basin this project focused on determining salinity tolerance of lipid-producing diatoms. Economic factors such as land, water, and labor availability and costs were researched. The hypothesis was: If saline tolerant diatom algae can grow in Permian Basin water salinity levels and the economic factors of land, labor, and water resources are considered, then an algae bio-fuel facility may be economically feasible for the Permian Basin region of New Mexico. <br><br> Two diatoms were grown in four saline environments approximating Permian Basin water sources. Economic factors from Hobbs, NM were compared with locations where algae bio-diesel facilities are proposed. Cyclotella diatoms demonstrated growth in all saline levels while Scenedesmus only displayed growth at lower levels. Economic data favored Hobbs over other Southwestern locations. Water costs in Hobbs were higher than Farmington, NM but using the non-potable source in the Permian Basin could decrease those costs. The results supported the hypothesis, but more detailed research on other economic factors (equipment costs, waste disposal, and access to water source) would provide additional conclusions.

CULTURING CHLOROPHYCEAE

Northwestern Area High School, Mellette, SD

Our project focuses on the culturing and examining of Chlorophyceae (green algae). We chose algae because they are a good source of natural oil and therefore, would be a great alternative bio-fuel.<br><br> Our goal was to successfully grow green algae and examine it to learn about its growing behavior. Our project began by collecting our supplies to grow our algae. We needed the following: disinfected fish tank, 4535.9 grams of carbon dioxide (CO2), ultra-violet light, a greenhouse, 2-50 ml cultures of prepared Chlorophyceae, Tetra fish food (ground), a heat lamp, Celsius thermometer, and 11.1 liters of distilled water. We then set up our greenhouse, fish tank, heat lamp, CO2, and water for the algae. As soon as our water temperature was between 15 degrees Celsius and 30 degrees Celsius, we added one culture of the green algae to the water and took the temperature of the water. The temperature of the water was taken periodically, and the algae progress was recorded. Throughout the experimentation, we added 1.5 grams of solid Tetra fish food to the tank and another 2.5 ml of powdered Tetra fish food, the second culture of our algae. We installed our ultra-violet light in our fish tank on the seventeenth day of experimentation in hopes of achieving better growth. <br><br> The total 26-day experimentation concluded that Chlorophyceae could be cultured inexpensively and efficiently because the Chlorophyceae is easily maintained and grows rapidly under the correct circumstances.

EFFICIENCIES OF HYDROGEN POWER
Scott Douglas Betz, Matthew Rasch, 
Bellbrook High School, Bellbrook, OH

Abstract<br><br>Concern about global warming and increased carbon dioxide in the air has driven scientists to search for alternative fuel sources. Since the largest producer of carbon dioxide is combustion of gasoline in automobiles, manufacturers are studying alternative fuels such as hydrogen. Hydrogen powered cars run solely on combustion of hydrogen. It was hypothesized that a better means of harnessing energy in hydrogen would be through use of Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cells <br><br>To determine the more effective method of using hydrogen fuel, a sealed cylinder with a static igniter and a piston was constructed to measure energy of combustion. The piston’s movement yielded distance which was manipulated in the equation Energy = Force * Distance to determine energy. To quantify hydrogen’s efficiency across a PEM fuel cell, a strand of fuel cells was linked in a circuit to keep amps constant while increasing voltage. This experiment yielded amps, volts, and time used in the equation Energy = Current * Volts * Time with comparable units to the previous experiment. Results proved fuel cells were more efficient because much of the energy from combustion was lost as heat. In the fuel cells, a lower amount of energy was released as heat. This indicates that while fuel cells may be expensive, they are a more practical application in the hydrogen fuel industry. Though the price of a fuel cell is higher, energy savings from its superior efficiency will exceed initial cost difference, thus making fuel cells more cost effective.

ENGINEERING WATER ELECTROLYSIS CELL FOR DISTRIBUTED GENERATION WHILE BEING POWERED FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY

Springville High School, Springville, UT

Hydrogen has the potential to replace conventional fossil fuels and natural gas, as well as providing fuel for transportation. However, hydrogen production only remains in the category as a non-polluting energy carrier when the electricity needed to power the electrolysis, is created from a non-polluting renewable source of energy. Thus, it is the purpose of our science project, to produce scientific evidence that will allow for the production of hydrogen in a decentralized manner that could become competitive against other existing energy sources by providing enough hydrogen per day to meet possible needs, while being powered by a renewable energy source. <br><br>We believe that through a careful alignment of the molarities of potassium hydroxide, the voltage, the current, pulse-width modulation, and different configurations of electrodes that the molecular structure of water can be broken down, which will achieve an efficiency rate sufficient enough to make a distributed platform of hydrogen production from a photovoltaic solar cell, a reality. <br><br>Two different electrolyser designs were evaluated. Based on the data provided from tests, the superior electrolyser was chosen. We tested different percentages of potassium hydroxide, voltage, current, and pulse-width modulation. Each variable was tested for the most efficient state. As a result of our experimentation, we have concluded that the concentration of lye only has a minor effect on the efficiency of electrolysis. A frequency of 600 Hertz provides a minor increase in efficiency of electrolysis and a flat plate electrode configuration is superior to a "cup" shaped electrode.

Shepton Freshman High School, Plano, TX

The purpose of this project was to make nanofibers that will be able to store light energy (to quench) and they can be used in a solar cell as the active layer. The hypothesis was that the concentrically electrospun BEH-PPV/20% carbon nanotube fibers would have the most quenching of all the electrospun fibers.<br><br>Fibers were made by electrospinning a semiconductive polymer, BEH-PPV, by itself, with 20% and 40% carbon nanotubes, and with 40% PCBM. The resulting fibers were analyzed under an SEM, TEM, and ultraviolet light to determine how much photoluminescence was quenched.<br><br>The hypothesis was disproved. It was concluded that the concentrically electrospun BEH-PPV/40% PCBM fibers have the most quenching capability. The BEH-PPV by itself had no quenching and the 20% and 40% carbon nanotubes only had some quenching. These new fibers show great potential as a substitute for the silicon in the solar cells. While the current active layer in a solar cell is made of silicon, which is inorganic, heavy, unwieldy, and fragile, the fibers created from this study are organic, light-weight, durable, and flexible. BEH-PPV also has the property of being an organic light emitting diode (OLED). This means that these nanofibers can eventually be used to build electronic maps, cell phone screens, computer screens and television screens that are as thin as a sheet and that can be rolled up like paper.

FROM THE KITCHEN TO THE FUEL TANK

Martinsburg High School, Martinsburg, WV

The purpose of our project was to find an efficient alternate source of fuel due to raging gasoline prices. Our hypothesis was that we could make a bio-diesel from safe kitchen products that were more efficient than gasoline. To conduct our experiment, we first performed a titration. We then used 2-propanol, phenolphthalein, methanol, sodium hydroxide, aqueous sodium hydroxide, acetic acid, and sodium sulfate to get our final product of bio-diesel. Next we used medicine capsules, oxygen, 2 liters of water, and 23 centimeters of wire to conduct the bomb calorimeter tests. Finally, we performed a math equation to find the heat given off in joules. In conclusion, we found that gasoline is the most efficient fuel source. However, soy bio-diesel is the best alternative. The tests concluded it was about 5 kilo-Joules per gram less than gasoline. Our hypothesis was proven wrong. To further our project, we tested the bio-diesel; we mixed 55 milliliters of bio-diesel and 55 milliliters of regular diesel in a diesel engine. Our test was successful, but we needed to make more so that the engine would maintain a run. We mixed a ½ quart of bio-diesel and a ½ quart of diesel. The engine maintained a run for a longer period of time. In both tests, we used a B50 mixture. We couldn’t test B100 because it will freeze at certain temperatures. If bio-diesel were to become an everyday product, gasoline companies must mix it with regular diesel to keep it from freezing.

Electric power generation was calculated from the output current and potential difference.<br><br> <br><br>Carbon and magnesium were used as the electrode as this combination gives the highest output. Carbon and magnesium combination produces approximately 1.5V and 75mA per cell.<br><br> <br><br>The output current was affected by the electrode's surface area immersed in sea water. Electrodes with total surface area 47.50 cm2 produce approximately 23.0 ± 0.04 mA. Connecting arrangements of one electrochemical cell to another in series also increases the output potential difference. 15 cells connected in series produces approximately 21.8±0.17V. Thus, combining the electrochemical cell with big surface area in series will increase both current and potential difference.<br><br> <br><br>To sum up, this project can be a kick start in the alternative energy field. In future, generating electricity by using sea water can be made possible. After all, sea water is freely and abundantly available. Furthermore, it does not cause harmful effect and pollution.

The purpose of this study is to develop a vertical axis windmill which generates strong starting torque from a light wind by using our constructed variable wing system. <br><br>A conventional vertical axis windmill is unable to generate a strong starting torque to start a rotation.　 Our system generates torque by getting drag and lifts alternately by changing the angle of a wing based on the principles of a yacht sailing.<br><br>We investigated the relation of the attack angle of a wing and torque from the wind direction. 　From our results, when the locus of wing’s trailing edge was viewed as a circle, we discovered that the center of the circle was slightly shifted from the axis of rotation.<br><br>With this discovery, we developed a simple off-centered structure to create the practical variable wing system. Comparison of the starting torque between the new vertical axis windmill and the conventional one revealed that new one system generated 5.7 times larger starting torque on average. The data also showed the dynamic torque the new windmill generated was by factor of approximately 2.5 compared to the conventional windmill.<br><br>In addition, an actual vertical axis windmill with 1200 mm wings was constructed, and it was able to generate electricity with a wind speed less than 1.0m/s.<br><br>As a result of our invention, strong torque can be obtained from a light wind to eliminate the low torque starting problem of a conventional windmill and improve its efficiency as an alternative energy resource for a better environment.

BIOLOGICAL FUEL CELLS II
Forrest Ryan Guilfoile, Daniel Roy Will, 
Bemidji High School, Bemidji, MN

We started this project as a continuation of our previous project; Biological Fuel Cells. The purpose of this continuation is to verify the reproducibility of biological fuel cells in lake sediment, along with possibly comparing a group of bacteria producing electricity to a single organism such as Geobacter; an organism documented producing electricity in biological fuel cells. Finally we hope to compare eutrophic and oligotrophic lake sediments in electrical production capacity and document bacteria found in the fuel cells comprised of those sediments. <br><br> Similar to our last project, we gathered lake sediment, with the addition of having ten samples from two lakes (five from each). As a control, two of the samples (one from each lake) were autoclaved and sterilized. Another variation from our last project, we used disk shaped electrodes, and no dialysis tubing, making our fuel cell even less dependant on human intervention, and creating a more self –sustaining module. One electrode was submerged in sediment, the other in water. The electrodes were connected with a wire connected to a resistor, and we took measurements until we had an amount of voltage that corresponds with having an abundant number of bacteria. The bacteria were isolated, eventually sequenced, and identified. <br><br> Upon identification we found several bacteria that exist in fuel cells and thus far improved our knowledge of bacterial species present in fuel cells. As well as gaining knowledge on sediment more adapt to produce a higher yield of electricity.

EFFECTS OF PITCH ON A HELICOPTER'S ABILITY TO ACHIEVE MAXIMUM ALTITUDE
Shane William Ward
University School of Nova Southeastern University, Ft. Lauderdale, FL

This researcher, through his experiment, strived to discern the effects of collective pitch on a model helicopter's ability to achieve maximum altitude.<br><br><br> This researcher flew the model helicopter at three different pre-determined collective pitch levels named low, medium, and high so that he could measure the effects of pitch in an organized fashion. The researcher created a fifteen foot PVC pipe structure that stood vertically in order to make observations. The time needed for the helicopter, when set at each pitch level, to reach maximum altitude was recorded. As well, the distance the helicopter strayed from the PVC pipe structure was recorded in order to determine how much torque affected the helicopter. The researcher hypothesized that the helicopter would experience less torque but ascend slower to maximum altitude when at low pitch. When at medium pitch, the researcher predicted the helicopter would experience slightly more torque and ascend faster. Lastly, the researcher predicted the helicopter would experience the most torque and ascend fastest at high pitch.<br><br> This researcher's active involvement with the Civil Air Patrol United States Air Force Auxiliary actuated him into performing the research; he hoped to offer information that could benefit his fellow United States military service members, civilian or armed, when flying helicopters and perhaps even all pilots around the world.

UTILIZATION OF HOT SPRINGS BACTERIA POPULATIONS TO ENHANCE CELLULOSE FERMENTATION
Leah Ann Hoblit
Greybull High School, Greybull, WY

Ethanol serves multiple purposes in our daily lives such as in flavorings, scents, and medicines for human contact or consumption. Ethanol is also used as an important solvent and a feedstock for the breakdown of products. It has shown major applications as a source of fuel, heat, and light. Currently, ethanol is produced conventionally, utilizing fungal systems to ferment simple sugars from sources such as corn. Cellulosic ethanol shows a more promising future because it exhibits higher energy content and it emits a lower level of greenhouse gas. Unfortunately a transition into cellulosic ethanol is difficult because the processes are both time consuming and costly.<br><br> Experimentation was designed to test the effectiveness of mesophilic bacteria to break down cellulose material. It was hypothesized that because these bacteria are adapted to the warmer temperatures and different chemical characteristics associated with thermal features, they will be able to effectively ferment the cellulose. Mesophilic bacteria from the Thermopolis Hot Springs were gathered and used for the research. Carbon dioxide production was measured in various situations to examine the effectiveness of the bacteria.<br><br> Carbon dioxide production displayed a 16% increase from the bacteria to the bacteria with cellulose. The bacteria were credited for .12 grams, or 2.23%, of the cellulose matter. This calculates into a 4.54% total reduction in cellulose mass. Because this percentage is yielding a 16% increase in carbon dioxide production, the bacteria can be shown to be effectively fermenting the cellulose material in the broth mixture. These results show that these specific mesophilic bacteria could potentially replace the current fungal systems now used to break down cellulose into simple sugars and be more efficient and cost effective.

BIOFUELS: A COMPARISON OF COST AND EFFICIENCY USING A PRATICAL MODEL
Austin Bie Miller
Suwannee High School, Live Oak, FL

The purpose of this project is to compare the cost efficiency among several types of fuel, including two biofuels which contain ethanol. The hypothesis is that 100% gasoline will be the most cost-efficient fuel compared to E85 ethanol and E10 "gasohol." A 2005 model Baja motorsports mini dirt bike was selected with a 6.5 horsepower Briggs & Stratton style gasoline powered engine. To simulate driving conditions with a stationary vehicle, a resistance simulator was constructed against the rear wheel. The mini bike throttle was set at a constant rate for each test repetition. Five hundred milliliters of fuel were used for each repetition to determine time of travel per unit of fuel used. Twelve repetitions were conducted on all three fuel types. Calculations were made to determine speed of the vehicle, distance traveled per repetition, miles per gallon for each fuel type, and overall efficiency for each fuel in miles traveled per dollar spent. Using a one-way analysis of variance and Fishers pairwise comparison, tests were conducted on the data which proved that the results were statistically significant (p=0.000). Ethanol E85 has the lowest purchase price but it did not run as long as the other fuels, which made it the least cost-effective fuel overall, even when compared to 100% gasoline. The conclusion is that E10 gasohol has the best cost efficiency at the current time among all fuels tested.

COAL GASIFICATION USING SOLAR ENERGY
Teib Ali Assaf
Modern Montessori School, Amman, JORDAN

The use of oil as a source of fuel is conventional as it is easily transported in pipelines or by tankers. However, the greatest disadvantage of oil is that it has a limited lifespan, up to 30-50 years while on the other hand, coal has a greater lifespan than that of oil and natural gas combined reaching up to 350 years. The World Energy Council listed the recoverable reserves of coal in 1999 at around one million million tones. This is enough to sustain present production of coal for more than 200 years. Unlike oil, coal is not as convenient due to it being present in a solid state; therefore it cannot be easily transported through pipelines. On the other hand, coal gasification offers many benefits, one of which is a more efficient electricity generating method than the conventional coal-burning power plant. But gasification requires heating coal in presence of steam and catalyst and this is done by burning fossil fuel. That is a big problem that I solved by designing number of units where steam and hot coal are obtained by solar energy.<br><br>I carried number of physical and chemical experiments for me to be able to come with a unique design.<br><br>I designed a solar panel where vegetable oil is used to store energy from the sun. I designed a heat exchange system to transfer this heat to water and to produce pressurized steam. The steam will then be allowed to come in contact with pre-heated coal in a special reactor that is provided with lenses to maintain high temperature inside the reactor. Coal is preheated using lenses.<br><br>The design was tested and was able to produce significant amount of gaseous fuel.

COMPARING OIL YIELDS OF TWO DIFFERENT CHLORELLA SPECIES (C. VULGARIS AND C. PROTOTHECOIDES)
Alyssa M Bagadion
CAT/Lakewood High School, St. Petersburg, FL

Biodiesel is becoming more reliant as sources of fossil fuels such as petroleum and coal are depleting. Biodiesel still has the problem of high costs compared to petroleum and coal. Research done on various types of algae showed that Chlorella was a possible type of algae for the biodiesel industry. <br><br> The present study analyzed the percent yield of oil production on Chlorella vulgaris and Chlorella protothecoides. The intent of this experiment was to find out which Chlorella species produces a higher percent yield. The two separate species were cultured under the same conditions. Oil extraction was conducted using the modified Bligh & Dyer method. A modified version of the Bligh & Dyer procedure was used through a different method of calculating the sample weight. The original and modified procedures were compared to see which one is more accurate. <br><br> The modified procedures were used to compare the yields of C. vulgaris and C. protothecoides. The average yield for C. vulgaris was 16.26% while the average yield for C. protothecoides was 21.43%. The original procedure was applied on additional samples of C. vulgaris. The average yield was only 10.58%; a lower average yield than the modified procedure used on the same species. Thus, C. protothecoides produces a higher average yield while the modified Bligh & Dyer method proved to produce a more accurate calculation.

WHICH FIN DESIGN ALLOWS ROCKETS TO REACH THE HIGHEST APEX?
Walter Paden Reed
Cornerstone Christian School, San Angelo, TX

The purpose of this project was to see if the number of fins on a rocket affected its apex. If so, what would determine the difference between a rocket with three fins, four fins, or five fins?<br><br> I performed this experiment by building three model rockets that were exactly the same, except for the number of fins. I then launched the rockets three times each, using the same size engine in all the launches. Afterwards I used graph paper and measured the height of my rockets using the angles that I measured with my measuring tool. Next, I took an average of the rocket launches.<br><br> My data ended up being that the five fin rocket went the highest in all my launches, with the four fin rocket coming in second, and the three fin rocket last.<br><br> My conclusion is: the more fins a rocket has, t<br><br>o an extent, the higher altitude it will be able to reach. I can conclude that the reason the rocket with five fins went higher is because it had more fins which gave it more stability than the other rockets. This resulted in a straighter and more stable flight than the others, which gave it a higher altitude.

RUN YOUR CAR ON WATER! PHASE II: MODIFICATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF AN INNOVATIVE DEVICE FOR GREATER FUEL EFFICIENCY
Lauren Michelle Cardenas
Del Rio High School, Del Rio, TX

The purpose of this project is to modify the “Hydrogenerator”, an innovative device for extracting hydrogen from water for greater fuel efficiency, and improve the vehicle’s mileage and emissions output. I believe that, if I change the conductors and catalyst of the device, the vehicle’s mileage will increase and emissions will decrease.<br><br> First, I created the Hydrogenerator 2.0 out of PVC pipe. This new design uses stainless steel fender washers as conductive plates instead of scrap tin can lids in order to prevent corrosion. Once I completed the Hydrogenerator 2.0, I installed it into the engine and filled up the Hydrogenerator 2.0 with water. I used rock salt as a catalyst because, unlike sea salt, it does not contain extra ingredients that could react or corrode the plates. Then, I hooked up the conductors to the car battery, and connected it to a switch and amp meter in the car to monitor it. Once everything was hooked up and ready, I ran three trials with and without the Hydrogenerator 2.0 on the highway and in town. After I finished testing the mileage, I tested the emissions. I hooked up the car’s tailpipe to diagnostic gas analyzer, and recorded the results.<br><br> My hypothesis was partly supported by the results. The mileage for the vehicle increased by almost 30%, and the conductive plates in the Hydrogenerator 2.0 had a noticeably less amount of corrosion than the original Hydrogenerator. However, the emission results were inconclusive. CO2 emissions increased while CO and HC decreased.

IMPROVED PHOTOELECTROCHEMICAL HYDROGEN PRODUCTION THROUGH INDIUM SPUTTER DEPOSITION AND HELIUM-NITROGEN PLASMA TREATMENT OF NANOTUBULAR TITANIUM DIOXIDE PHOTOANODES
Brett Scott Clark
Arkansas School for Mathematics, Sciences, and the Arts, Hot Springs, AR

Today’s world demands cleaner and more efficient methods of energy production. The emerging energy crisis has an immeasurable impact on both the economic and environmental health of the world. Among the many potential solutions to the energy crisis, an answer lies within the realm of nanotechnology. The disassociation of water for hydrogen gas production has been the focus of many nanotechnology projects for the past 38 years due to its non-polluting effects and high exploitability as a form of energy. A novel implementation of indium into existing Titania nanotube technology provided evidence that indium has the potential to improve upon the low efficiencies characteristically seen in this field. In conjunction with the indium experiments, a series of helium-nitrogen plasma treatments on arrays of Titania nanotubes produced results comparable to current efficiencies and were therefore used as a control for comparison to the results of the indium experimentation. A transient 35 fold increase in hydrogen gas generation resulted from the indium sputtered Titania arrays, illustrating that indium has the potential to become a key component in the future of photochemical water electrolysis.

GENOMIC PROSPECTING TO INCREASE LIPID PRODUCTION IN ALGAE
Forrest Ryan Guilfoile
Bemidji High School, Bemidji, MN

I analyzed what genes in various algal species code for increased triacylglycerol production, which can be converted to carbon neutral biodiesel. From published sources, I obtained the lipid content for five of the sequenced algal species. By using the BLAST function on the Joint Genome Institute and other databases, I determined the number of copies of various significant genes in the lipid production pathway. <br><br> I compared the number of genes between five species that are completely sequenced and have a known lipid content. It appears that the number of copies of these specific genes does not greatly affect lipid content in an algae. For example, though the production of acetyl-CoA carboxylase is the first committed step in the production of cellular lipids, C. reinhardtii has five copies of the gene with a 21% lipid content, while P. tricornutum has only 2 copies, but has a 31% lipid content. The gene that appeared to have positive correlation with lipid content was 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphatase.<br><br> The number of copies of a gene doesn't necessarily influence lipid production. However, researching more genes in the pathway (not just "forks" in the pathway that lead to or away from the triacylglycerol production) is necessary. Determining the efficiencies of the encoded enzymes and the many potential inhibitors in the process is also important. As more genomes are sequenced more complete conclusions can be drawn regarding the number and type of genes affecting the production of cellular lipids, ultimately allowing genetic engineering of species to enhance triacylglycerol production.

The researcher’s project is studying characteristics of alternative fuels and comparing them to non-renewable fuels (gasoline/diesel). This is important because alternative fuels will play a key part in our nation’s future and affect our world’s environmental health.<br><br>It was hypothesized that the three bio-diesel types and E85 would perform better respectively that the diesel and gasoline.<br><br>Three types of bio-diesel were produced: Canola, Beef Tallow (animal fats) and soybean. The researcher purchased E85, diesel, and gasoline (octane 87, 89 and 93).<br><br>The following tests were conducted at the Tampa laboratory by the technicians: glycerin content (bio-diesel), vapor pressure, density, %FAME, distillation, oxygenates, flashpoint, vapor-liquid ratio, sulfur content, ethanol content (E85), hydrocarbon content, pHE, water (mass %). The tests performed by the researcher were: energy content, cloud/pour point, pH of soil, nitric oxide emissions, algae effects, viscosity, pH, and copper corrosion.<br><br>The alternative fuels did not prove to have a higher energy content than the diesel or gasoline. One test that the alternative fuels did perform well in significantly compared to the diesel and gasoline was the nitric oxide emissions test, meaning they are more environmentally friendly.<br><br>In conclusion, the alternative fuels (biodiesel and E85) did not perform as well in the majority of the tests as the diesel and gasoline did. The hypothesis was not supported.<br><br>

GONE WITH THE WINDMILLS:AN ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF AN OSCILLATING WIND ENERGY GENERATOR
Ryan Cherian Alexander
R. C. Clark High School, Plano, TX

Can a windmill for developing countries be created using local materials, such as bamboo, and can a windmill be created using aeroelastic flutter that can gather energy more efficiently in the developed world?<br><br>In the project, models were created of the actual windmills: the turbine, an lattice tubular design, the oscillators- a natural version constructed from bamboo and a normal wooden one, a four-oscillator model, a high altitude oscillator, and a Darius oscillator. The models were tested in different environments and with varying wind speeds. <br><br>It was hypothesized that the field of normal oscillators, which use aeroelastic flutter and do not have to contend with much friction, would produce the most electricity and the results confirmed that hypothesis. Both the natural and the normal oscillator produced around 240% more power that current turbine designs. The Darius design produced around 400% more power and the High Altitude Oscillator, 582% more power. The field of oscillators produced an outstanding 819% more power whereas the lattice windmill produced about 180% more power that the conventional windmill.<br><br>This experiment is evidence that these technologies can advance the efficiency and capabilities of wind-driven energy generation. This data is very accurate with a statistical confidence level of 99.9% and its findings can be directly applied to the real world. With the use of an electric “kit’ containing the copper wire and magnets and local materials such as bamboo and leaves, developing countries will have access to clean, dependable, and cheap electricity.

THE EFFECT OF WINGLET DESIGN ON AERODYNAMIC LIFT
Morgan J Watson-Morris
John Jay Science and Engineering Academy, San Antonio, TX

Aerodynamic lift is created by unequal air pressure as an aerofoil travels through air. A winglet is a small, usually vertical, wingtip extension used to combat drag-inducing vortices. Building on previous work, this year’s experiment used non-vertical (75-degree), downward facing winglets. The effect of winglet rake angle on aerodynamic lift was investigated to determine the most efficient use of material in terms of a wingtip device. Wings were tested in a variable speed wind tunnel. To control for differences in weight among the wings, lift was calculated as the ratio of wing weight to wind speed needed for flight. Variation in lifting area caused by changing winglet rake was controlled for by: 1) plotting lift ratio against winglet area, and 2) measuring lift per unit of winglet lifting area. The control trials consisted of six wings tested without alteration. The experimental trials consisted of three wings fitted with winglets of varying rake angles, in addition two wings were tested with simple wing extensions. One was tested throughout without alteration. Each trial provided fifty observations of wind speed, taken at 10 second intervals during flight. A total of 96 trials gave 4800 data points. Results indicate that winglets with large rake angles and low aspect ratios are more efficient at improving lift than winglets with small rake angles and high aspect ratios. The conclusion of this study is winglets with a rake angle of 82 degrees are the most efficient use of material in terms of a wingtip device.

ENHANCING PHOTOVOLTAICS THROUGH THE INCORPORATION OF ALGAE
Cesar Eduardo Soria Jimenez
Grants High School, Grants, NM

The purpose of this project is to determine if last year’s solar cells containing algae can be improved upon to find a method to increase individual algal electric potential regardless of other cell components.<br><br> It was hypothesized that the cells containing algae will produce a higher voltage (when going through photosynthesis) than cells lacking algae; also, a nutrient media will be found that increases individual algal electric potential without giving a charge on its own. <br><br> To prove this, eight solar cells – five with algae (Experimentals) and three lacking algae (Controls) – were exposed to light. Results show both the Controls and Experimentals cells increased in voltage, however, while in the short term tests the Control seemed superior, long term tests showed that the Experimental cell increased electric potential by much more and the third and fourth cell generations proved to be much more efficient than the Controls. <br><br>Magnesium Chloride has been found to drastically aid algal voltage (without providing a voltage on its own). It is believed that a higher concentration of Magnesium will decrease the rate of deterioration of chlorophyll, as it is a major element in the molecular structure of chlorophyll. If constantly replenished, or provided in higher concentrations, Magnesium will allow chlorophyll to absorb light’s energy at more efficient levels; this in turn provides higher voltages.<br><br> Proving the hypothesis correct, individual algal electric potential was isolated and increased, and after four cell generations, cell voltage peaked at 970mV for an algal cell in a 0.5M solution of MgCl2.

MIMICKING NATURE: HOW DO ORGANIC DYES ALLO PLANTS TO PRODUCE "FREE" ELECTRONS?
Malvina Alicia Kowalik
North Atlanta High School, Atlanta, GA

Every hour, the sun deposits the same amount of energy that the world uses annually. One object, which can be used to harness this energy is the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). The purpose of this project was to find a more effective organic dye to use in a DSSC. <br><br>My hypothesis was that it is possible to use organic dyes to “free” electrons capable of powering electrical devices. <br><br>The experiments conducted under non-standardized conditions yielded qualitative results. The following materials were used: conductive glass (indium-tin oxide, ITO), titanium dioxide (TiO2), blackberries, chokeberries, raspberries, pomegranate, carrot, liquid electrolyte (I2/I3- redox couple), carbon (soot), acetic acid, water, and ethanol. Other materials used were: light projector, Petri dishes, scotch tape, mortar and pestle, binder clips, hot plate, multimeter with clips and electrical leads, and Q-tips. <br><br>A layer of TiO2 was deposited on ITO electrode followed by deposition of a dye by soaking the electrode in a corresponding fruit extract. The electrode was dried and then covered with another ITO on which soot was deposited. The assembly was held together with paper clips. To complete the cell, a solution of the electrolyte was placed between the electrodes and the so assembled device was attached to the multimeter. The current and voltage were measured under dark and illumination conditions. <br><br>The results showed marked increase of both current and voltage upon exposure of the solar device to light. In my experiments, the raspberries produced the highest readings of current (3.4 mA) and voltage (490 mV).

WOOD FUEL EFFICIENCY
Reynaldo Berreles
Burkburnett High School, Burkburnett, TX

. Every year millions of homes light up the chimney to provide a warm and nostalgic comfort to there home during the winter months. I decided to dive into the study of wood fuel efficiency to see if I could find the best type of wood to use in a residential fire place. <br><br> The three woods tested were oak, processed pine, and self-start logs. After the construction of a Fire Control Station, I ran a battery of test on the three previously mention variety of woods. I tested for particle emissions, a measure of burn time, temperatures from multiple distances, cost of fuel, and maintenance of the fire. Particle emissions were measured by A.C. filters comments on the particle emissions are mentioned in the data and burn time was measured by when the log was lit to when the log would split in half. <br><br> Unfortunately, I was unable to decide on the “best” variety due to the fact that every type had its disadvantages and benefits. Oak provide high heat, long burn time, minimal stock, and an extremely low cost. The disadvantage was the large amount of maintenance needed to keep it on fire. Pine had a very nice, even and consistent heat, but was very smoky. The Self Start log required no maintenance, but every testing of temperatures was varied. After research I found that it is common to get inconsistent performance from the self-start logs.<br><br> In the end, I satisfied to be able to provide this information to consumers so the can make a decision based off the needs or wants. The self-start logs are easy and produce mid ranged temperatures, but if you don’t mind the extra labor then oak is the most efficient of the three.

ELIMINATING THE WALL EFFECTS OF WIND TUNNEL TESTING UTILIZING A MOBILE OPEN-AIR TESTING APPARATUS
Jacob Bryce Harvey
Southwest Virginia Governor's School, Pulaski, VA

The objective of this project was to design, build, calibrate, and test a mobile open-air testing apparatus that would eliminate the wall effects found in conventional wind tunnels and to compare the results of airfoil tests with those obtained from commercially available computerized fluid dynamic software and from a subsonic wind tunnel. Computerized airflow simulations using JavaFoil were used to determine an optimal arrangement of components to ensure that turbulence resulting from airflow around the vehicle on which the apparatus was to be mounted would not result in non- uniform airflow over the airfoil. A three-dimensional virtual model for flow-visualization studies of the as-built full-scale test apparatus using Pro/Engineer Wildfire 3.0 was generated. This three dimensional model was then imported into EFD Pro 9, a computational fluid dynamics software package, where visual simulations of pressure distributions and airflow over the testing apparatus demonstrated that the combination of top and side panels above the mounting truck sufficiently isolated the airflow disturbances induced by the truck’s geometry to produce uniform airflow above the paneling at the testing velocities employed. The mobile open-air testing apparatus was comprised of several individually fabricated components including a pickup truck, modified steel mounting rack, melamine-coated medium density particle board top and side panels, mounting cradle, mounting sting, airfoil, and airfoil endplates. Initial test data confirmed that the idea of a mobile testing apparatus could be used in aerodynamic testing applications. The system was conceptually sound and could be an economically feasible alternative to subsonic wind tunnel testing.

Currently the Cleveland area lacks the ability to harness energy from renewable energy resources. A study of wind turbines was done in order to see if Lake Erie is a potential site for future energy production. The purpose of this project was to determine the best location for a small wind farm on the lake. The goal was to find what height over Lake Erie carries the highest average wind speed. A greater average wind speed will result in more energy produced. In order to determine the wind speeds at various heights a LIDAR (or Light Detection And Ranging) unit was used. It is a laser anemometer that records the wind speeds at any programmed height in three minute intervals. The fastest wind speed was established at 80 meters off the surface of the lake. This data was collected at a place on the lake called the Water Crib which is fresh water intake for the city of Cleveland. Once data was collected the secondary goal was to calculate exactly how much energy the turbine will produce based on the highest average wind speed. The cost of building the turbines will then be compared with the amount of energy produced (in dollars) to determine how long it will take until a profit is seen.

THE DIFFERENCE IN CO2 PRODUCTION BETWEEN SWITCHGRASS AND CORN STOVER AS A BYPRODUCT OF ETHANOL PRODUCTION
Matthew John Campbell
West Lafayette Junior-Senior High School, West Lafayette, IN

The purpose of this research was to determine the effectiveness of the production of sugar by pretreated corn stover or pretreated switchgrass. CO2 as a byproduct of ethanol was measured. Corn stover and switchgrass were pretreated in 1 molar H2SO4. The pH was then brought back to 4.8 by NaOH so that cellulase could be added. The solution was mixed with yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). CO2 production from the reaction was measured by a CO2 probe. The CO2 produced by the switchgrass demonstrated an average change of 1,905.63 ppm, as compared to the average change of 966.30 ppm of the corn stover tested. Further, the control samples for switchgrass and corn stover demonstrated an average change of 1,557.62 ppm and 600.11 ppm respectively. However, the study was inconclusive as to whether switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) produced more CO2 as a result of the breakdown of the lingo-cellulosic structure as compared to the corn stover (Zea mays L.)

HARNESSING SOLAR ENERGY, YEAR FIVE: INCREASING THE EFFICIENCY OF A HYBRID POLYMER PHOTOVOLTAIC CELL WITH NANOFIBER POLYMER COMPLEXES OF VARIED THICKNESS
Nathan McKay Monroe
Episcopal High School, Jacksonville, FL

A polymer photovoltaic cell is a novel thin film solar cell. It is cheaper, but less efficient than the silicon standard. Two important variables are polymer thickness and nanofiber length. Increased polymer thickness decreases efficiency. Increased nanofiber length increases efficiency. The two variables are linked by having a similar thickness. The goal was to maximize efficiency by optimizing the thickness of these two layers. It was hypothesized that the nanofiber/polymer combination of 100/130nm would maximize efficiency.<br><br> Through profilometry, scanning electron microscopy, and statistical analysis, functions were produced to reproducibly control polymer thickness and nanofiber length as functions of spin rate and reaction time, respectively. The nanofibers were grown on cleaned ITO slides via the sol-gel process from zinc acetate and zinc nitrate precursors at thicknesses of 100,150,200 and 250nm. The polymer P3HT was spin-coated onto the slides at a constant 30nm thicker than the nanofiber layer. Aluminum and bathocuproine layers were applied via thermal evaporation. The slides were tested using solar simulation and semiconductor parameter analysis.<br><br> The data partially supported the hypothesis. The addition of nanofibers initially decreased efficiency. After 72 hours of air exposure, the nanofiber slides increased in efficiency while the control decreased. The slide of thickness 100/130nm had the maximum efficiency, 29% greater than the control, with a theoretical efficiency of 5.1%. The results were statistically significant. The polymer is a liquid, allowing a solar panel to be painted onto any surface. Finally, its manufacture is easier than current solar panels, requiring no extreme temperatures or pressures.

FROM RUST TO HYDROGEN: A GREEN APPROACH
Kartik Malhotra
duPont Manual Magnet High School, Louisville, KY

Imagine a future in which the world’s most abundant energy source, sunlight, is used to electrolyze water to generate hydrogen. Utilizing the hydrogen as a fuel yields energy and regenerates water.<br><br> PhotoElectroChemical (PEC) cells use light energy to create electricity, which is used for electrolysis. The objective of this project was to develop an improved method using solar light to produce hydrogen in a cost effective and environmentally friendly manner. Specifically, this project focused on using PEC cells based on an abundant and inexpensive substance, namely, rust (iron oxide). <br><br> Novel & innovative procedures were developed to create and test PEC cells containing iron oxide (alpha-Fe2O3) particles. This approach was used to demonstrate that iron oxide particles can be used in PEC cells to successfully electrolyze methanol and produce hydrogen. Further modifications were developed which resulted in significant improvements in photocurrent and thus efficiency.<br><br> The progress made in these studies should help advance efforts to achieve the ultimate goal of electrolyzing water to generate hydrogen. The resulting hydrogen can be stored and used as fuel with zero emissions of greenhouse gases. This provides alternatives to current methods of producing hydrogen which have a negative effect on the environment and/or are expensive. In contrast, the approaches developed in this project produce clean renewable energy in a cost effective manner and can contributing to sustainable development.

The purpose of this project was to find how much of the energy used for production of hydrogen became useful mechanical energy when the hydrogen ran the car, and how much energy was transferred in each of the steps between hydrogen production and running of the motor. <br><br>My research questions were: <br><br>• What is the efficiency of a toy hydrogen car? <br><br>• Where does the greatest energy loss occur? <br><br>I did three experiments: <br><br>In experiment A I found the efficiency of the electrolyzer, by finding the electrical energy input and the amount of hydrogen produced. <br><br>In experiment B I found the efficiency of the electrolysis and combustion combined, and from this the efficiency of combustion alone, using input to the electrolyzer and output from the fuel cell. <br><br>In experiment C I found the efficiency of the motor, by measuring the electrical input to the motor while measuring the work it did by lifting different masses.<br><br>I repeated each experiment with varying results, so I plotted results and graphed lines of best fit to find the most correct values, except for in A where I just found the maximum efficiency. <br><br>The total efficiency of the car was maximum 3.3%, and minimum 0.088%.<br><br>The greatest energy loss was in the motor, which had an efficiency of between <br><br>0.55% and 7.63%, a lot less than those of the of the electrolyzer and fuel cell, <br><br>86% and 59% respectively.

HARVESTING MICROALGAE (CHLAMYDOMONAS REINHARDTII) FOR BIOFUEL PRODUCTION USING WASTEWATER TREATMENT TECHNIQUES
Michael Jay Fuad
Breck School, Golden Valley, MN

Microalgae are an important future source of biofuels because they produce high yields of oil and require far less acreage for cultivation than soybeans or corn. The microalgae species chosen for this study, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, shows one of the greatest potentials as a source of biofuels because it yields approximately 50% oil by dry weight. However, the current method of harvesting microalgae by centrifugation is inefficient and costly. The objective of my research was to engineer an effective, efficient, and inexpensive way to harvest microalgae in preparation for biofuel production. <br><br>Microalgae are particularly difficult to harvest because they are extremely small in size and they form into suspensions because they have negatively charged surfaces. A wastewater treatment technique that uses chemicals to coagulate negatively charged microparticles was employed to flocculate microalgae. A variety of high-cationicity compounds used in wastewaters treatment—aluminum sulfate, ferric chloride, calcium carbonate, ammonium sulfate and thirteen Clarifloc polyacrylamides—were tested at a range of dosages and pH values to achieve 90% flocculation efficiency. The best flocculation efficiency of 99% was achieved by using Clarifloc polyacrylamide C-6288 at a dosage of 0.025 grams flocculant/grams dry microalgae and a pH of 3.00. Unlike centrifugation, there is no limitation on per batch volume when harvesting microalgae using flocculation; therefore, results suggest that harvesting by flocculation is more efficient than harvesting by centrifugation.

FREE ENERGY? PART 2
Brennan Kyong Un Chung
Terre Haute South Vigo High School, Terre Haute, IN

This project incorporates engineering design with concern for the environment to harness free energy from the wind. Multiple propeller designs were created, built, and tested to determine the one that would generate the most power output per unit mass. The four-blade angled propeller by far generated more power output per gram than any of the other blade designs tested. This blade generated enough energy alone to power a small electrical device.<br><br> Inventor, a 3D CAD program, and a Rapid Prototyper were used to design and make sample propellers to test. Each propeller was mounted on a motor and placed in a small wind tunnel. The motor was connected to a computer, and the output for voltage and amperage were recorded. The four-blade propeller operated at 5225 RPM and generated 0.63 watts.<br><br> Two different configurations were tested to determine how turbulence affects the power output at different distances. One configuration contained two to nine propellers equally spaced on an aluminum rod and connected to a single motor. The additional weight and turbulence from the blades being close together worked negatively on the power output. The second configuration consisted of two propellers each attached to a motor that were spaced at various intervals. Connecting propellers on individual motors spaced a distance over twice the propeller diameter generated a normal power output and no turbulence.<br><br> Energy from the wind could be harnessed by designing a propeller that would generate the most power per unit weight. If properly spaced in application to avoid turbulence from other blades, the power output would easily power electrical devices.

PROCESS OPTIMIZATION OF OIL EXTRACTION FROM TETRASELMIS ALGAE FOR EFFICIENT USE AS BIODIESEL FUEL
Jonathan Dean Flood
Sarasota High School, Sarasota, FL

Process Optimization of Oil Extraction from Tetraselmis algae for efficient use as biodiesel fuel<br><br>Petroleum based diesel fuel is the most widely used fuel in the world. Rudolph Diesel designed his first efficient diesel engine to run on peanut oil. After the advent of crude oil, vegetable oil was replaced as the primary fuel for diesel engines. As petroleum based diesel fuel is a non-renewable resource, a suitable alternative must be found. This alternative could possibly be biodiesel. Biodiesel can be refined from oil and can be run in a standard diesel engine without modifications. In this experiment the process of extracting suitable oil from algae was analyzed. From previous research, it has been determined that a press and cyclohexane solvent extraction are the most efficient methods. The purpose of this research is to determine which of the two will yield the most oil, and subsequently the most biodiesel, with the best quality, for the lowest price. Cultured Tetraselmis algae, which has a relatively high oil content, will be dried and oil will be extracted using a press, cyclohexane, and a combination of the two processes. The collected oil will be converted to biodiesel and run in an engine to determine the oil efficiency. The use of the combined methods of press and cyclohexane extraction will produce the greatest oil yield with minimal cost.

THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD... POWER ITSELF USING ALTERNATIVE FUELS
John Linden Shinners
Saginaw Arts and Sciences Academy, Saginaw, MI

This experiment tested which alternative fuel would most effectively power a steam engine. The purpose of this experiment is to find an alternative energy source that is effective. This experiment was conducted by using 6.0g of Esbit solid fuel, wood fire starters, wood, corn, peanuts, pistachios and soy beans to power a steam engine. Each fuel had a total of three trials in which the amount of time for the water to boil, the amount of revolutions made by the engine, the time the engine was revolving, and the mass remaining after the trial was measured. Each fuel burned for 1 minute 15 seconds after the water had began to boil and then the steam engine was activated by ¼ turn of the flywheel. The hypothesis was if 6.0g of each fuel is burned to power a steam engine, then the Esbit solid fuel will be the most effective fuel based on all of the measurements made.<br><br> After this experiment was completed, the results show that the wood fire starters were the most effective fuel because the wood fire starters were the quickest fuel to bring the water to a boil, had the most revolutions produced, the longest time revolving, and the most mass remaining after each trial of any fuel tested. The corn kernels were the only fuel that did not boil the water. Based on these results, it is safe to conclude that the hypothesis was not supported.

THE FUTURE OF FUEL
Aaron Blake Shepperd
Hart County High School, Munfordville, KY

In this day and time alternate fuel sources, such as solar and hydrogen power, are very highly sought after. The purpose of this experiment was to test the application of both mentioned resources; the question tested stating that the energy amounts in hydrogen being compared to the energy amounts in hexane. The hypothesis in question was that hydrogen created in electrolysis would be more efficient than hexane of a given amount. To test the feasibility of this hypothesis, hydrogen was generated using the electrolysis of water powered by a solar cell. The energy produced by the burning of said hydrogen was calculated using mathematical techniques, as well as a sample amount of hexane. The energy sources were also lab tested, and the results will be included in an experimentation booklet. The two energy amounts were then compared to decide which substance was more energy efficient. When the results were compared, the numbers were quite different; hexane giving off nearly one thousand times more energy in measured amounts. The conclusion originally was that the hypothesis in question was incorrect. However, when viewed economically, the hypothesis is confirmed. This project could have great ramifications if applied to vehicles, not only for the user’s wallet, but also for the environment, as the fuel is completely clean.

ALGAE: FUEL OF THE FUTURE, PHASE II
Ethan Daniel Erickson
West Central Valley High School, Stuart, IA

With the rising cost of diesel, the demand to find a cheaper way to produce biodiesel has increased. Using algae is a relatively new innovation in the bio-diesel industry and is very promising because algae has high oil yields, is very easy to grow, and is normally just killed off. Making biodiesel with it is a better alternative than killing it off. Even the by-product, when making bio-diesel, glycerin, has many uses. The purpose of this experiment is to determine if bio-diesel can be made from algae and to find, flash point and gel temperatures. It was hypothesized that biodiesel can be made and will have a higher flash and gelling temperature than petroleum diesel. The procedure included first, growing the algae. Then, harvesting the algae and extracting the oil. Next, finding out how much lye is needed, by titration, to transesterfy the oil. Prepare the sodium methoxide. Then, heat the oil and mix in the methoxide. Now, allow the oil and glycerin to separate for eight hours. Finally, wash the biodiesel and heat it to remove water. The biodiesel had an average flash point of 152 degrees Celsius, a crystallization point of -7 degrees Celsius, and an average gel point of -13 degrees Celsius. The algae oil biodiesel would perform well in warm temperatures that do not go below freezing. If the temperature goes below that, then, the biodiesel will gel up. This project would apply to anyone that has equipment that runs on diesel.

OPTIMIZING THE GROWTH OF NANNOCHLOROPSIS OCULATA FOR PRODUCTION OF BIOFUELS
Akshai Baskaran
Kennewick High School, Kennewick, WA

There is a critical need for alternative liquid fuels since the United States consumes 20 million barrels of petroleum per day, two thirds of which is imported. Renewable, domestic, carbon-neutral liquid fuels are necessary to meet our energy needs without environmental concerns. Microalgal biofuels, also known as oilgae, could be an attractive option for meeting a part of our fuel needs because they do not need arable land or fresh water.<br><br>Research in algae growth, lipid productivity and economical lipid extraction and conversion methods are all necessary to make algal fuels competitive with existing fuels. The purpose of my study was to optimize the growth conditions of an algal bioreactor system, and study the effects of nitrogen limitation on the productivity of Nannochloropsis Oculata batch culture. <br><br>My project showed that higher concentrations of nitrogen resulted in higher algae growth rates, up to a limit. A statistical analysis of variance of the optical density and the organic dry weight of the algae with different nitrogen concentrations showed that the variance of data was significant and that higher nitrogen concentrations did increase the growth rate of algae for a given concentration of other nutrients. My project also indicated that a minimum threshold concentration of inoculum in the solution was necessary for growth of algae, and that the growth rate of algae strongly depends on the strength and source of the algae strain. Lastly, and importantly, absolute sterilization was not required for algae production in these experiments. This could affect the economics of algae production. <br><br>By optimizing the growth conditions of Nannochloropsis Oculata microalgae, higher overall yields of lipids and byproducts can be obtained. This could decrease the cost of algal biofuels, and the fact that algae do not require arable land or fresh water can make algal fuels more attractive than alternative biofuels and eventually competitive with conventional liquid fuels.

After conducting research the past two years on the effects of crude glycerin when combined with biomasses for a renewable energy source, the natural by-product of biodiesel improved the heating value of the dry biomasses and increased the length of the burns to produce sufficient energy. <br><br> As a third-year continuation project, further experimentation was conducted to turn this idea into reality. Various absorption tests were conducted to discover necessary proportions of glycerin to biomass and maximum absorption. Multiple time intervals were recorded. The goal was to run small-scale tests using crude glycerin and various biomasses in bodums for results to be utilized on a large-scale. Experiments were conducted using soybean-based crude glycerin with scrap wood, corn cobs, and oat hulls. Maximum absorption was reached within three hours for each biomass tested. Proportions of biomass to glycerin varied for each biomass tested.<br><br> Results from this research were sent to the McBain Power Station in Michigan to be used as a basis for test runs in their boilers. By discovering the necessary amounts of crude glycerin to biomass for efficient combustion results, a test run will be conducted to reveal the effectiveness of burning in a power plant operation. Creating a renewable energy source from raw, waste materials was found possible by combining crude glycerin with biomasses to produce a viable solution to the energy crisis of today.

A hovercraft is a vehicle designed to carry its load in an environmentally friendly fashion, over land or water, on a supportive cushion of air. Originally, the goal was to enhance the design through the use of renewable solar power, but this plan came to a halt in the design phase due to the absence of information about the relationship between the blower’s airflow rate (and associated electrical power demand) and total supported weight of a hovercraft. Hence, airflows of various rates were investigated for maximum available lift. The result was a quadratic relationship between a blower’s airflow rate and the total weight supported by the hovercraft. This information will enable future construction of a practical solar hovercraft.

ENHANCING TECHNIQUES FOR GENERATING A SUPERIOR BIODIESEL
Brittany McKell LaRoque
Skyview High School, Billings, MT

My project focuses on the washing techniques for biodiesel. This process begins by making biodiesel. This process is called transesterification. This happens when an alcohol, base and triglyceride are mixed. But the bulk of my project lies in the replacement of the water washing technique. Biodiesel needs washing because often after it is made the pH is to high for optimal levels. The pH has to be between 8 and 9 to be able to be used in a car. A lot of the time it ends up being a 10 or 11, and sometimes upwards of 12. The water washing technique is then used to decrease the pH but is problematic for many reasons that can be expensive, hassling and lowers yield. It causes emulsification, and during the removal of the emulsification almost 20% of the biodiesel is lost. It also costs a lot of money to send used water off to water treatment facilities. This increases the cost of biodiesel. So in order to remedy this problem, there had to be a chemical or mineral that could replace this troublesome step. In the restaurant industry the mineral Magnesol is commonly used to wash oil so it can be used multiple times. This mineral somewhat effective for washing biodiesel but there are a few drawbacks; it takes multiple washes to bring the pH down to optimal levels and is often much to expensive, again raising the prices of the biodiesel. In order to make biodiesel the least expensive, and the least troubling a new mineral must be used. This is where the experimental mineral comes in. This mineral has many of the same properties of Magnesol but is nearly one-tenth of the price. It is similar to Magensol because of its structure which is comprised of mostly carboxylic acid chains. The difference can be found in the number of washes. For both Magensol and the water wash it took 2-4 tries to get the pH down to an 8, but with the experimental mineral it took only 1.

INVESTIGATION OF THE TECHNOLOGIES ENABLING A SOLAR STIRLING RENEWABLE ENERGY POWER SYSTEM
Nathan Michael Tinker
Covenant Christian Academy, Huntsville, AL

Renewable energy power systems are needed to reduce our nation’s dependency on foreign fossil fuels. The purpose of this project was to investigate the primary technologies enabling a solar Stirling power system to generate electricity. These key technologies include a Stirling engine with linear alternator and cooling system, and a solar concentrator to heat the engine and allow the system to run off a renewable energy source. <br><br> To investigate the factors that affect efficiency of the solar Stirling power system, tests were conducted using (1) magnets of different inner diameters and materials, and (2) a water cooling system. Large-scale system tests in sunlight were performed, using the Stirling engine and a large 5.5 m diameter parabolic concentrator with sun-tracking heliostat. A major system application was also developed utilizing the Stirling engine to charge batteries. To further understand Stirling engine operation, a computer model was developed.<br><br> For magnets of a given material, outer diameter, and thickness, smaller inner diameters resulted in higher system efficiency. Water cooling improved the system output voltage by 8 percent compared to the uncooled engine. The large-scale test demonstrated operation of a practical system configuration, with the engine operating in a vertical orientation while being heated continuously. The computer model agreed well with the experimental data for piston displacement.<br><br> It was concluded that solar Stirling power systems are practical for earth and space applications. Major factors affecting system performance are Stirling engine efficiency and operating temperatures, magnet material, coil/magnet gap size, concentrator efficiency, and absorber design.

CAN THE WHEEL BE REINVENTED
Pablo A Valdivia
Grants Highschool, Grants, NM

A great all terrain vehicle is not plagued by the restriction of wheels. The limitation in wheels allows for a device to improve on the concept of wheels and make a better off road vehicle, the main purpose of my project. A new concept wheel engineered to enable a model car to move with mobility and speed, mixing legs and wheels, will perform on a variety of terrains. <br><br>Versions 1, 2, 2.1, and 3 were a failure; however, each version proved better than the last. The main problem holding back the prototype was the motor was not strong enough to move the model efficiently. In version 1.0 equipped with three weaker and smaller motors it never moved; the weight of all the components on board was too heavy. In versions 2.0 and 2.1, the motor would work for only a short amount of time. Version 3.1 could walk but still was plagued by not having enough power. 3.2 was successful. The theory behind the enhanced properties of the legged wheel seems to be intact. This shows that while the design may have better off road capabilities, the ineffectiveness of a legged wheel may make it less helpful than a traditional wheeled vehicle.

CHLORELLA AS AN ALTERNATIVE FUEL
Lauren Trusten Cameron
Colquitt County High, Moultrie, GA

The unstable price level of petroleum fuels has led to increased research into alternative fuels. The solution to the unstable, and often expensive, cost of petroleum products may lie in a ditch, lake, swimming pool or fish tank. The problem is to create alternative fuels from algae, one being biodiesel and to compare the physical properties of the biodiesel to those of biodiesel made from soy and petroleum diesel. The experimenter used Chlorella, a species of algae that exhibits exponential growth rates and has high oil yields. The experimenter hypothesizes that biodiesel, from the process of transesterfacation, and substance similar to crude oil, through the process of pyrolysis can be produced. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that the physical properties of biodiesel made from algae will be similar to the physical properties of soy biodiesel. First algae was cultivated in two twenty gallon tanks and removed the algae by flocculation and then dried and pressed to remove the oil content of Chlorella to manufacture biodiesel. Then the remainder of the algae was mixed with sawdust and heated the mixture in an oxygenless environment, also known as pyrolysis, until a layer of condensed black liquid settled at the bottom. The byproducts of pyrolysis are a type of charcoal and wood gas, which can both be further refined and used as fuel. The experimenter was able to produce both biodiesel and a crude oil like substance that can be used as alternative fuels. After biodiesel was made the physical properties were tested using viscosity, lubricity, and cloud/gel point tests. The experimenter was able to create all of the fuels hypothesized. But not all of the physical properties of the algae biodiesel were similar to those of soy biodiesel; this part of the hypothesis is rejected.

AEROBIRD II: COMBINING SWEEP ANGLES TO MAXIMIZE THE LIFT TO DRAG RATIO WITHOUT PROBLEMATIC AEROELASTIC DIVERGENCE IN AIRPLANE WINGS
Jonathon Bryant Nance
Noblesville High School, Noblesville, IN

Sweep Theory has been under controversy in the aerospace industry in that forward swept wings possess significantly higher lift-to-drag ratios and the ideal stalling point that allows for a higher angle of attack than traditional wings. However due to the severe aeroelastic divergence experienced at the wing tips, forward swept wings have been deemed impractical at most angles. Rear swept wings do not undergo such extreme divergence problems due to the wingtips placement behind the center of pressure and a better efficiency of the precession of air circulation. To solve this problem both sweep angles could be combined in a manner similar to a soaring bird planform. This new aeroelastic divergence conscious design should benefit from the same or better lift to drag ratio.<br><br>Testing of this design must be done in a wind tunnel at subsonic speeds for the divergence issue only arises at subsonic speeds. The new design has two variations while the forward swept wing has two angles. All designs plus a control must be tested in a wind tunnel.<br><br>Data analysis revealed a conclusive lift-to-drag ratio per inch squared advantage in the new wing design over the forward swept wing. Thus, these results have proved that the new design that combines both angles has not only matched the lift to drag ratio, but has exceeded the ratio. These results have the potential to offer a solution to the problems of sweep angles without sacrificing all the benefits of both angles of sweep.

OKLAHOMA WIND - FINALLY GOOD FOR SOMETHING!
Jackson Troy Cunningham
Vici High School, Vici, OK

The purpose of this experiment was to find how different blade factors affect the efficiency of a wind turbine. Seeing all the wind turbines being built in our area, I wondered exactly how much power they were putting out. I believed that the turbine with the most, and longest blades at a pitch of 45 degrees would have the greatest efficiency regardless of wind speed. <br><br>I conducted tests with different pitches and measured the output, and used the results to determine optimal pitch. Using optimal pitch I tested different blade lengths to determine the optimal blade length. Using the optimal pitch and blade length I tested different numbers of blades to determine the optimal number.<br><br>Through doing this experiment I determined the optimal pitch (20 degrees ), length (11"), and number of blades (12) for my wind turbine. I found it interesting that less pitch (10 degrees) produced more volts, but when put under a load it was not as capable of doing work as a slightly higher pitch (20 degrees). I chose 20 degrees as my optimal pitch because I felt that it was a better test of work being done. <br><br>Another observation I made from the tests was that by finding these optimal variations to the blades I was able to raise the power output of the wind generator from 33 milliwatts to 800 milliwatts. This shows how critical proper blade design is to a wind turbine's output.

OPTIMIZING BIODIESEL FUELS: WHAT SHOULD WE BE GROWING?
Jonathan Howard Guinther
Mills E. Godwin High School, Richmond, VA

The purpose of this study was to determine the most suitable vegetable oil to be used as a biodiesel fuel. Neat fatty acids were tested because combining them can create a representation of any vegetable oil. Fatty acids are commonly categorized with two properties—the number of carbon atoms and double bonds in the chain. The notation used is (carbon atoms : double bonds.) The fatty acids that were tested were myristic acid (14:0), palmitic acid (16:0), stearic acid (18:0), palmitoleic acid (16:1), oleic acid (18:1), linoleic acid (18:2), and linolenic acid (18:3). <br><br>Heat of combustion, induction temperature, friction, and wear were all measured to determine biodiesel fuel performance. A differential scanning calorimeter was used to determine induction temperature and the heat of combustion. A high frequency reciprocating rig was used to measure friction and a surface analyzer was used to measure the wear that occurred during this test. All of the fatty acids had surprisingly low frictional characteristics which could improve engine performance. However, the wear test was not severe enough to discriminate the acids, so it could not be used in the comparison. Stearic acid was shown to be the best overall fatty acid; however, it does not form a large percentage of common vegetable oils. Thus the most practical option was found to be palmitic acid which forms a large percentage of refined palm oil, an existing biodiesel fuel. Future studies should include a more severe friction and wear test and synthetic fatty acids.

The purpose of this project was to determine the best arrangement of fixed solar cells to collect the most power with the goal of improving the collection and hence viability of solar power. Different arrangements of fixed solar panels based on some of the currently used commercial arrangements were tested such as a grid, a 180-degree arc, a triangle, and a trapezoid. It was hypothesized that a 180-degree arc design would be best because it allows at least one solar cell to be facing the sun at all times. <br><br> Today’s solar energy systems usually incorporate motorized tracking systems to produce more energy as they pivot and follow the sun’s path, thus consuming power in order to maximize the production of power. Fixed panel systems have less energy potential than these tracking systems because less of the light hits directly. However they are cheaper and easier to maintain because there are less moving parts.<br><br> The cells were tested under controlled conditions using a simulated sun that accurately replicates its path over the course of the day at a specific point on the Earth’s surface. Voltage and amperage were measured at five separate points along the simulated sun’s path and used to calculate the wattage. The results indicate that the most common fixed panel arrangement, a simple grid, is the best for collecting solar energy because that arrangement produced the highest average wattage over the course of the simulated day.

My project is a comparison study of biodiesel fuel production from locally available fry oil sources utilizing qualitative analysis methods to analyze which is the best biodiesel overall to use.<br><br> I produced four samples for each of the four feedstocks then washed half and left the other unwashed, the washed had the best quality overall. Ph was tested for all samples with a pH meter and recorded. Combustibility was utilized by using the flame test using cotton swabs rapped on a glass spatula and soaked in each sample then lit and timed each combustion length. The crystallization was measured by recording at which temperature the samples started crystallizing and the temperatures were generally lower than expected. Also using the Gel point test I recorded at which temperature the samples gelled.<br><br>Density was measured and recorded for each sample.<br><br>Using a viscometer each samples viscosity was recorded and compared. The 27/3 test or Methanol test was used show any left over glycerin in the samples. The clarity test was used to test the clarity in each sample. The Copper test was used to test corrosiveness in each sample.<br><br>Overall the soybean feedstock(cooking oil) was the best to use to produce high quality biodiesel. Soybean biodiesel cost about 40-70 cents a gallon to make your self and this product very environmentally friendly and is 100% biodegradable.

REDUCING WING INDUCED DRAG THROUGH THE ADDITION OF ADAPTIVE TIP SAILS
Joseph Anthony Gerner
George C. Marshall High School, Falls Church, VA

Tip sails, analogous to the primary tip feathers of terrestrial soaring birds, are purported to extract energy from the upwash flow field of the wingtip vortices, to produce independent lift and forward thrust components. The tip sails' forward thrust component would act to reduce the wing's induced drag, which is a result of the wingtip vortices that accompany the production of lift. This experiment was conducted to investigate the extent to which the addition of an adaptive tip sail could reduce the induced drag of a low aspect ratio finite wing. To conduct this experiment, I engineered an adaptation of the Cayley Whirling Arm coupled to a microcontroller-based data acquisition system. I used the framework of hypothesis testing to determine if there was a statistical difference in the net drag and drag coefficients between the baseline wing and the tip sail configured wing. At a 99% confidence level, test results at elevated angles of attack supported the alternate hypothesis, that the wing tip sail had the effect of reducing the overall drag and drag coefficient of the wing.

NOVEL FORM OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY: MEDIATOR-ASSISTED SELF-REPAIRING PHOTOELECTROCHEMICAL SOLAR CELL
Sumit Malik
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Alexandria, VA

Harnessing the sustained power generation of photosynthetic organisms has potential to yield large-scale, durable solar technologies. Most proposed biological solar cells integrate photosynthetic proteins extracted from organisms, thereby forgoing vital self-repair capabilities of organisms and resulting in short-lived electrochemical systems. We report a novel design and proof-of-concept of a mediator-assisted self-repairing photoelectrochemical solar cell constructed of marine sediment and seawater, two non-descript graphite electrodes, and anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonic acid disodium salt (AQDS) mediator. AQDS was inserted into the electrochemical system following characterization of the cell in the absence of a mediator. Time records of cell discharge exhibited diurnal fluctuations consistent with its photosynthetic nature, with significant increase in current production during daylight hours over nighttime hours both with (p < 0.0001) and without (p < 0.0001) AQDS. Insertion of AQDS facilitated oxidation-reduction reactions and significantly augmented daytime power generation (p < 0.0001), but the ensuing faster depletion of resources resulted in nearly complete stagnation of electrochemical processes in the absence of sunlight. Nighttime power generation was therefore significantly lesser with AQDS than prior to the insertion of AQDS (p < 0.0001). These data validate the proposed cell concept and support the interpretation that self-maintaining biofilms spontaneously form on the electrode surfaces and catalyze AQDS-enhanced oxidation-reduction reactions, and that an aerobic, photosynthetic consortium utilizes sunlight to regenerate electrode reactants from electrode products. Our research suggests a novel, self-assembling, durable approach toward solar power generation.

ELECTROCHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF ELECTROCATALYTIC PERFORMANCE OF NON-PRECIOUS METAL ELECTRODES AND CATALYSTS ON DIRECT ETHANOL FUEL CELL
Abhinav Ram Mohan
Chantilly High School, Chantilly, VA

This project evaluates the optimal electrocatalytic performance of non-precious metal electrodes and catalysts on the Direct Ethanol Fuel Cell (DEFC). Experimentation was conducted to initially determine which non-precious metal electrode-catalyst combination used had an effect on the amount of voltage output that could be derived from a DEFC. Success of these experiments conducted with different electrodes and catalysts eventually led to further research to find the right electrode–catalyst combination to produce the voltage required to support and sustain a commercial-grade fuel cell.<br><br> In all, thirty six trials were conducted using wet DEFC. The electrodes used in these trials included Carbon, Copper, Cobalt, Magnesium, Zinc, and Nickel. The catalysts used included Manganese dioxide, Calcium carbonate, Silicon dioxide, and Iron oxide. The electrode–catalyst combination of Cobalt–Nickel–Manganese dioxide enabled the DEFC to produce over 2.050 Volts. The type and amount of catalyst used was directly proportional to the amount of electricity produced, which was achieved in Trial Eight.<br><br> The contributions of this project are twofold. First, the amount of voltage produced by the DEFC using Cobalt and Nickel electrodes was found to be 2.086 volts. Second, the amount of catalyst used was less than the amount used in the case of Platinum electrodes. Since Platinum and Rhodium electrodes are far more expensive than Cobalt and Nickel electrodes, fuel cell manufacturers can benefit by using non-precious metal electrodes and catalysts for developing direct ethanol fuel cells and produce lower cost fuel cells particularly for automobiles.

OPTIMIZING TURBINE BLADE EFFICIENCY BY MANIPULATING BOUNDARY LAYER SEPARATION
Andrew Kipling Miller
Western Alamance High School, Elon, NC

The purpose of this experiment was to improve wind turbine performance by applying protuberances to the turbine blade.<br><br> The best configuration of the protuberances was determined through testing in a homemade wind tunnel. The 22 inch diameter scimitar propellers were tested in the 36” diameter wind tunnel at air stream velocities of 3.5 m/s and 1.7 m/s. The propellers were attached to an electric motor and the power output from the spinning propellers was measured. <br><br> Field testing applied the best configuration to a downwind, horizontal 1.9 kW wind turbine turbine, Skystream 3.7. A data logger correlated wind speed to power output and one minute averages or bins were recorded per integer wind speed.<br><br> Wind tunnel data showed that of the seven configurations tested, placing protuberances on the leeward side of the blade just back from the leading edge provided the greatest improvement in power production over control. Field testing of this configuration demonstrated an average of 40% improvement in power output by the experimental blades at the 9-11 mph wind speeds. From 12 to 19 mph wind speeds the experimental blades showed an increase in production from 7% to 19%, The experimental advantage declined from the 20 to 24 mph wind speeds, where the control blades took a slight advantage at the 24 mph wind speed.<br><br> The results indicate that placing protuberances on the leeward side of a 1.9kW wind turbine blade can significantly improve power output at low to moderate wind speeds.

WARNING ABOUT WARMING: INNOVATIVE FUEL CELLS FOR THE 21ST CENTURY - A PERFORMANCE STUDY OF THE PROTON EXCHANGE MEMBRANE, REVERSIBLE, AND DIRECT METHANOL FUEL CELLS UNDER MULTIPLE OPERATING CONDITIONS
Pavane Lakshmi Gorrepati
Rivermont Collegiate, Bettendorf, IA

This project is a continuation of a three-year study examining the viability of fuel cells as an energy source for the cars of tomorrow. The objective was to comprehensively analyze the performance of three fuel cell systems by evaluating multiple criteria broadly categorized as changes in input, changes in the environment, and changes in design.<br><br> The systems that were chosen include the Reversible Fuel Cell (RFC), Direct Methanol Fuel Cell (DMFC), and Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC). Performance was compared among the fuel cell systems and against a baseline measurement. Most experiments were conducted in a controlled laboratory environment, whereas others were carried out in an outdoor environment intended to simulate real-world conditions.<br><br> The results from my 12 experiments indicate that the DMFC has certain limitations, but also that it has potentially useful applications. The experiments I conducted with the PEMFC have given me insight about its potential to be utilized globally. Nevertheless, my research indicates that it remains plagued by many issues that preclude this reality. Although the RFC outperformed the PEMFC in voltage output (1.53V v. 0.76V), it consistently underperformed in production efficiency and under multiple operating conditions.<br><br> The circumstances in which these fuel cell systems can be employed are limited, but under the proper conditions these fuel cells can be implemented effectively. My research has been able to identify these qualities and draws conclusions on the long-term potentiality of the RFC, PEMFC, and DMFC. Any future outcomes will be interdependent on human needs and feasible applications.

THE POSITION OF THE LUMINANCE AND ITS EFFECT ON THE PERCEPTION OF LIGHT THROUGH COLOR SOLAR FILTERS IN THE SEMAPHORE AREA
Joemalia Y. Millan-Molina
Ramon Quinones Medina, Yabucoa, PUERTO RICO

Sunglass lenses, as protecting filters, don’t only absorb blue and ultraviolet light but, also limit the absorption of visible radiations. It’s important to consider if the color of sunglass lenses affects the visual perception of light in front of a semaphore.<br><br>The problem under investigation was to establish if the position of luminance affects the perception of light through solar filters in a semaphore zone. A wrong perception of colors due to the use of filters and the position of the light source can have an effect particularly, when driving. The hypothesis was: the position of luminance affects the perception of light in the zone of the semaphore through solar filters. <br><br>A donated semaphore was used in this investigation. With the use of a light sensor, CBL2 and graphic calculator, the levels of light intensity were measured changing the position of the light source and filter color. The intensity of light in the filter lenses was measured using a photometer.<br><br>It was found that over the four simulation periods, varying the position of the light source, the same patron was observed. If the traffic light is red, the least intensity of light is obtained with green and blue filters. If the traffic light is yellow, the blue colored filter had the least intensity. When the traffic light was green, the brown and red filters had the lowest intensity. The lights of the semaphore are least perceivable when the light source is behind it. This indicates that the hypothesis is sustained.

A NOVEL MICROBIAL FUEL CELL BASED ON INEXPENSIVE GRAPHITE ELECTRODES
Vishnu Jayaprakash
Chettinad Vidyashram, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, INDIA

The increasing global demand for energy requires a continuous search for alternative renewable energy sources. For practical applications of renewable energy sources in rural areas a cheap design based on locally-available raw materials is essential. My project studies Microbial fuel cells (MFC) which use cow dung as substrate. A Microbial fuel cell converts chemical energy available in a bio-convertible substrate directly into electricity. Bacteria present in the cow-dung catalyse the decomposition of glucose present in the substrate releasing electrons, which contribute to the current. A cow-dung based fuel cell was fabricated using acrylic chambers where the anode contains cow dung and the cathode contains potassium ferricyanide which acts as the terminal electron acceptor. The chambers are separated by a proton exchange membrane (Nafion). My critical contribution in the design comes by the way of identifying an inexpensive graphite electrode for the cell. <br><br>The details of the design, performance and cost of different cow dung fuel cells are presented in this work. Experiments were conducted to study the performance of the cell in the following aspects :<br><br>(i) Different designs of the cow dung fuel cell were fabricated and their performances were compared<br><br>(ii)The performance of the cells with different electrodes and different areas of the proton exchange membrane (Nafion) were compared<br><br>(iii)The longitivity of the cell was determined<br><br>(iv)The current drop with time and the charge liberated by the cell was calculated.<br><br> The newly developed cow dung fuel cell showed 13% more current density, 44% more power density with a cost reduction of about 90% when compared to a reference model. Such fuel cells can provide enough power to enable LED based illumination in rural areas at a reasonable cost.

SUGAR PRODUCTION, WASTE REDUCTION: TURNING WASTEPAPER INTO FERMENTABLE SUGARS FOR BIOETHANOL.
Xingyu Zhou
Walter Murray Collegiate Institute, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, CANADA

Cellulosic materials are one of the main renewable resources available in large quantities which could meet our future energy needs. Today, the extent of solid waste production is becoming a global concern. The development of methods to convert solid waste into usable bioproducts is beneficial to our environment and our energy needs. In this project, four types of wastepaper (office paper, newsprint, cardboard, paper towel), a major component of domestic solid waste, were treated with commercial cellulases from T. viride, T. reesei, and A. niger with or without the addition of cellobiase from A. niger (Novozyme®188). The conversion of the cellulose component from wastepaper into sugars was measured by the Dinitrosalicylic Acid Assay, a Glucose Kit and thin-layer chromatography. All of the examined wastepaper can be degraded by the cellulases to a certain degree, with the paper towel showing the highest degree of hydrolysis. Among the tested enzymes, cellulase from T. reesei (Celluclast®1.5L) showed the highest activity in paper degradation, especially in combination with Novozyme®188. The longer the incubation time was, the closer the reaction approached 100% degradation. A temperature increase from 25ºC to 37ºC accelerated the degradation reaction more than two times while a further temperature increase to 50ºC did not significantly improve the process. Glucose was the only identified sugar when Celluclast®1.5L was combined with Novozyme®188 in the reaction. The results here show that wastepaper may be used to produce glucose, the substrate for the production of ethanol, one of the most important renewable fuels in the world.

THE ELECTROMAGNETIC VIBRATION DAMPENING SYSTEM FOR ADVANCED SOLID ROCKET FUEL MOTOR SYSTEMS
Joseph Richard Bussenger
Pennridge High School, Perkasie, PA

This research in its current state is a second year continuation from a simple propulsion design in year one studies. This current research will advance an original idea and test a more advanced, more precise, and more powerful system. The system will test an original program (Vibrametric’s Program) to regulate power to two electromagnets (with the purpose of reducing shock vibration) equidistant from a rocket motor. <br><br>The effectiveness of the system was analyzed in two parts. Part one included testing the effectiveness of the electromagnetic system on the rocket motor system. Controls tests where the motor was uninfluenced by magnetism were compared to variable tests where the motor was under an electromagnetic field. The effectiveness of 75% power to the magnets leads to a 90% reduction in vibration. The maximum reduction in vibration is 95% when the magnets are powered to their 93% maximum limit thus significantly reducing the vibration. <br><br>Part two included the testing of the Vibrametric’s program where the standard deviation of the average reduction in vibration over one motor burn was analyzed. The standard deviation was calculated to be 0.003, which is far more successful than first hypothesized. <br><br>Both the life-saving and engineering elements are being considered for aerospace vehicles. This research is the first to reduce post-ignition anomalies at the source of the problem by reducing this shock vibration.

MATCHING WINGLET TO WING: PHASE 2
Ariel Lyn Evans
Sussex Central High School, Georgetown, DE

This research covers the first half of year two of a planned three year engineering project; with the goal of designing and test flying a full scale prototype winglet engineered to reduce vortex induced drag on my Falcon 2 hang glider. During this phase of research I made improvements to my water tunnel testing system, testing procedures, and data analyses by which ten new concepts were tested.<br><br> Many improvements were made to my water tunnel system including increasing flow, reduction of turbulence, a fine filtration system, improved viewing of the test chamber, and a pneumatic dye delivery system. The model wing and mount system was also redesigned to improve model similarity, deliver dye to the model, and transfer the drag force to a scale making it measurable.<br><br> I conducted three drag force tests per concept which were averaged; each test included six force readings per 0, 5, 10, and 15 degrees positive pitch. Winglet #10 had a significant effect on the reduction of drag, and it was further tested to determine its ideal mount angle and flight stability using tell tales & dye trails along with drag force data. The results of testing were tabled and graphed for comparison.<br><br> The base wing equipped with winglet # 10 demonstrated slightly improved stability over the wing alone, and indicated an improved lift to drag ratio, even though the onset of stall occurred slightly sooner. This design was chosen for further testing and full scale construction in year three.

FOURIER TRANSFORM INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY ANALYSIS OF OXIDATIVE DEGRADATION OF ETHYL LEVULINATE, A NOVEL AND PROMISING NON-FOOD SOURCE BIOFUEL
Andrew Knoller Cohen
Columbia Grammar and Preparatory School, New York, NY

Corn ethanol, the United States' main answer to petroleum dependency, may end up as a failed experiment. Cellulosic biofuels like ethyl levulinate (EL), which do not economically compete with food sources, may offer a better solution, but may present problems of their own. EL is derived from wood waste and offers excellent lubricity, a high flash point, and significant NOx and CO emission reductions. However, oxidative degradation, a prevalent phenomenon in biofuels, is a significant impediment to EL's commercial use. In its advanced stages, oxidative degradation of any fuel can lead to the formation of sediments and gums that can plug fuel filters and prevent end use applications. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to detect primary and secondary products directly produced in EL as a result of oxidative degradation. Results were compared to FTIR spectra obtained for biodiesel and a blend of 5% EL, 15% biodiesel, and 80% petrodiesel (B15EL5). Results were consistent with traditional peroxide value measurement, demonstrating the efficacy of FTIR as an oxidative degradation measurement tool. Peroxide formation in EL was extensive, rendering the fuel in its pure form unstable compared to biodiesel and petrodiesel. However, oxidative stability of B15EL5 was far more promising. This study appears to be the first to measure peroxides in a biofuel through FTIR spectroscopy, a simpler, more efficient alternative to more commonly used techniques.

GENERATING SUSTAINABLE ELECTRICITY VIA VORTEX TURBINES
Alexis Chenyere Wilkinson
Nicolet High School, Glendale, WI

Inspired by the work of engineer Louis Michaud on the Atmospheric Vortex Engine, this project was designed to try and determine the feasibility of turning a naturally-occurring phenomenon into sustainable electricity. The project had four goals: create a vortex generator, design a turbine that would operate efficiently in a vortex, test the efficiency of that turbine, and discern an application for this concept in the world of energy. The first part of the procedure was the formation of a vortex generator. Using plans outlined by physicist Harald E. Edens, a vortex generator was created that incorporated a vacuum motor and a variable output transformer. This generator was able to produce a controllable vortex of air made visible by a mist generator. Blowing a small volume of air, the generator could create winds up to 122 km/h. The second part of the procedure entailed the creation of a vortex turbine. The turbine used Savonius-type blades attached to a base with magnets. As the turbine spun, these magnets passed over coils of wire, generating 100 volts of alternating current. Applying Betz Law and data from both devices, it was found that the turbine could transfer roughly 18.43% of the wind’s speed into turbine blade speed, thus confirming the hypothesis that vortex winds can generate electricity. It was determined that at speeds greater than 2.748 m/s, the turbine would generate more electricity than was input to run the motor. The results suggest that vortex turbine power could become a viable alternative energy option.

BREAKING WIND
Joseph Randall Latham
Holy Spirit Catholic Regional School, Tuscaloosa, AL

This project examined taper's effects upon the performance and efficiency of rotor blades within a Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine system. It was hypothesized that those blade designs possessing an inward taper would prove to be of greater efficiency than those possessing an outward taper, while those designs being of outward/inward taper and those having no taper would come to experience only moderate success.<br><br>A scale wind turbine and columnator were constructed. 9 differing sets of turbine blades were used. Each blade was crafted with consistent length and surface area from 3/8”- thick foam board. Following the construction of said items, each of the nine blade groups was placed at angles of 5, 15, 30, and 45 degrees within the scale turbine. Blades were exposed at each angle to wind speeds of 1.47 m/s, 2.23 m/s, and 3.13 m/s for 1 minute. Observations of generated DC Amperage and Voltage were recorded throughout the testing process at 5 second intervals.<br><br>Results were thoroughly analyzed and the figures for total output power were calculated, proving those blades of an inward taper and those of both an outward and inward taper to be of far greater productivity than those of an outward taper or having no taper whatsoever.<br><br>In conclusion, the given hypothesis was proven correct in predicting the success of inwardly tapered blades when compared to that of outwardly tapered blades. However, those blades of outward/inward taper proved to be of far greater success than was anticipated.

BIODIESEL
Taylor Joshua Hysik Woods
Fairfield HIgh School, Fairfield, MT

Fairfield, Montana is a farming community located in the Golden Triangle, an area of land between Great Falls, Shelby, and Havre and produces the best quality grains. Primary commodities grown in the area include malt barley, spring wheat, winter wheat, and alfalfa. Hydrocarbon diesel fuel is the primary energy fuel, and in 2008 prices climbed to a high of $5.00 per gallon creating an economic operating hardship. The purpose of this project is to build a biodiesel reactor and wash plant to process vegetable oils and evaluate them as an alternative fuel source. To date used canola oil, 50/50 new canola/camelina oil, and new camelina oil have been processed and tested for flash point, sulfur content, viscosity, cloud point, carbon residue, water, sediment, and phosphorus. All values are in acceptable (ASTM) American Society for Testing and Materials ranges for biodiesel except cloud point of 50/50 canola/camelina. The costs to produce one liter of used canola biodiesel was $ 00.62/liter. Costs to produce one liter of new canola/camelina and new camelina biodiesel was $1.92/liter and $1.95/liter respectively. The reduction in the carbon footprint for 2,500 gallons of biodiesel is 0.6 tons of CO2.

CAN ALGAE BE CONVERTED INTO BIODIESEL?
Elaina Elizabeth Hamann
St. Anthony Village High School, St.Anthony, MN

Finding alternative fuel sources for oil is a major priority for all of us. The purpose of this experiment is to determine if common algae can be converted into biodiesel fuel. I hypothesized, that if the right strain of algae is used,then yes, algae can be be processed into biodiesel fuel. First, research was done to determine the algae strains with the highest lipid or oil content.<br><br> Dunaliella Tertiolecta, a green algae was best suited for this experiment,so it was found and harvested. The algae was then dried and placed into an expeller press where oil was pressed out. The extracted oil was then mixed with lye or caustic soda and then methanol for separating the soaps and by-products. Within hours, the mixture is separated, leaving the glycerin at the bottom and the biodiesel fuel on top.Finally,after 5 vigorous washings of the biofuel, it was ready to use.The biofuel was tested in a diesel truck and it ran smoothly.<br><br> Producing algae biodiesel fuel was relatively inexpensive and easy to manage. Petroleum engineers can produce 18 gallons of biodiesel from one acre of corn compared to amounts up to 15,000 gallons from algae! There is no comparison, algae is a superior alternative energy resource that we should implemented now.My hypothesis for this experiment was proven correct and making algae biodiesel fuel became a reality.

THE EFFECT OF RUMBLE STRIP DESIGN ON VEHICLE TRAJECTORY: A TWO YEAR STUDY
Renee Louise Schaaf
Central High School, Saint Joseph, MO

In a previous year’s research, rumble strips were determined to be safer if placed strategically on the roadway with stripes ground either 70 degrees or 110 degrees to the flow of travel, depending on the direction of travel. This angle was shown to negate the effect of drag which pulls vehicles off the road. The purpose of this year’s research was to determine 1) the best stripe angle for vehicle correction, 2) differences in sound and vibration levels between rumble strip designs, and 3) the effects of changes in vehicle weight and tire tread designs on the trajectory of vehicles between rumble strip designs. Results indicated that a 60/120 degree design was more effective in keeping the vehicle on a straight path, and that there were no significant differences in sound, vibration, weight, or tread design results between the 60 degree and standard 90 degree designs. Rumble strips create a drag effect that pulls the vehicle towards the strip and potentially off the road. The angled stripes of the 60 degree design create a path of least resistance that cancels the drag effect. These results indicate the rumble strips should be formed on the roadway with stripes cut 60/120 degrees to the direction of traffic. On the left side of the roadway, stripes would appear like \ while the right side would be /. This design would be effective in any roadway in which traffic is flowing in the same direction. Strips on 2-lane roads would be placed //.

High oil prices highlighted the world’s dependence on fossil fuel. Developing countries suffer from energy crisis. Considering the high cost of crude oil, there is a need to find for alternative source of energy. Primarily this study aims to establish the chaff of Oryza sativa and Zea mays kernels as alternative source of fuel. Secondarily the study also looks at the fermentation wastes as possible fertilizer and animal feeds.<br><br> Mixture of corn and rice chaff with Saccharomyces cerevisiae were fermented for five days at a room temperature. The filtrate after separation from the solid residue was distilled 3 times to yield clear distillate collected at 78 0C and a viscous liquid. Three products were obtained namely the solid residue, clear distillate and viscous liquid. Five mixtures of clear distillate and unleaded gasoline were prepared and its combustibility as fuel was tried on a 4-stroke engine. The solid residue with dead yeast was tested for the available protein using Protein Test. The viscous liquid was analyzed for its nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium using NPK Test Kit.<br><br> Iodoform Test and Flammability Test confirm that the clear distillate is ethanol showed potentials as fuel for internal combustion engine. The viscous liquid has a low phosphorus content but has a medium rating of nitrogen and potassium potential as fertilizer. The solid residue with dead yeast has high protein content possible for animal feeds production.<br><br> With such findings, fermentation of chaff from Oryza sativa and Zea mays yield alcohol, feedstuff and fertilizer.

INDUCING ANAEROBIC CONDITIONS FOR HYDROGEN PRODUCTION IN CHLAMYDOMONAS REINHARDTII
Raman Venkat Nelakanti
Lynbrook High School, San Jose, CA

With the world facing an enormous energy crisis, it is necessary to develop renewable energy sources. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a potential source of renewable hydrogen energy, but its use is practical only if vital steps in the hydrogen evolution process are improved. The requirement for anaerobic conditions is a major obstacle for hydrogen production by these algae in real world applications. The objective of this experiment was to explore anaerobic hydrogen production using sulfur deprivation to initiate anaerobic conditions. The algae were cultured in TAP medium with four different concentrations of sulfur. Oxygen concentration and cell density was measured over time. Sulfur concentrations of 6.727mM and 13.454mM enabled the algae to have the greatest net consumption of oxygen. The 6.727mM and 13.454mM concentrations also allowed for algae growth, while the conventional method of culturing algae in sulfur-free media inhibited algae reproduction and growth. Additionally, to test the methods developed in this research and measure energy output, hydrogen gas produced by the algae was run through a fuel cell. This research proposes an alternative method for anaerobic hydrogen production by C. reinhardtii that may help the algae become a renewable energy source.

Mayfield High School, Las Cruces, NM

The field of wind power is dominated by a single gigantic image, the modern wind turbine. However, these giants are able to produce energy in only the 1% of the United States where commercially viable wind speeds exist. A new style of wind turbine, (similar to windmills previously used for water pumping), which is efficient in producing power in low wind speeds (<12mph), is needed to collect power in the other 99% of the nation. A turbine that will function in these low wind speeds will be a viable solution for harnessing most of our nation’s wind power.<br><br>The scope of this project involves testing blade types and configurations for efficiency, airflow, and collection area. Blade types will be tested within a wind tunnel at various angles of attack, and the lift and drag characteristics will be documented. Computer flow modeling will allow visualization of airflow through blade assemblies. Blade types that emerge as the most effective will be used to create a full size model. This model will be tested for power output by measuring torque and speed generated from the central shaft of the turbine to mathematically determine the power output. This project will also test a flat multi-blade design, a thin airfoil blade design, and a thick airfoil blade design. The determined power generated will be plotted for annual output.<br><br>Work on this project was completed in a local machine shop and with college instructors for supervision and instruction.

PELLET VS. PELLET
Stephen Robert Szudera
Beach High School, Beach, ND

The purpose of my expirament was to see which biomass pellet or pellet/corn mix would produce the most heat, making it the most efficient to use.<br><br>I picked five biomass pellets readily available in western North Dakota. I measure out a 50 fluid ounce container of each of the pellets and weighed them. I then put the pellets in the empty stove hopper of a wood pellet stove and pushed the ignitor. Once the pellets were lit, I took the temperature reading every five minutes and noted any observations.<br><br>Out of the five pellets tested,there was a significant variance in the brands. The top pellet had an avarage heat of 250.67 degrees F. The lowest average heat was 189.67 degrees F. The other three pellets varied in degrees by only 11 degrees F. When corn was added to the lowest producing pellet, it uncreased the avarage temperature by 26 degrees F.<br><br>I also learned that pellets can be made from just about any biomass material. Wood pellets are the most popular. Other biomass materials include sunflowers, corn, and grass. There are also some byproducts to these materials that are a good renewable use of our natural resources.

LIGHT INTENSITY AND AMBIENT TEMPERATURE VS. SOLAR CELL OUTPUT
Caleb George Gestes
John Curtis Christian High School, River Ridge, LA

How does light intensity and ambient temperature affect the energy output of a solar cell? This question was the subject of my study; my hypothesis was, "Changes in light intensity or ambient temperature will not affect the energy output of a solar cell." The manipulated variables included different incandescent bulb wattages (15-w, 25-w, 40-w, 60-w, and 100-w) and temperature (From 50 °C down to -5 °C). The dependent variable was millivolts (measured using a digital voltmeter). For temperature, I warmed the solar cell (utilizing a hairdryer and foil) and recorded voltage for every 5-degree change. For the temperature drop, I placed the solar cell in the freezer and read the volts again, for every 5-degree drop. Both temperature tests had a light source. Ten trials were conducted for each variable.<br><br>After analyzing the data, I rejected my hypothesis because both light intensity and temperature affected the energy output. With the different bulb wattages, the solar cell produced the lowest mv output with the 15-w bulb (687.3 mv), and the highest, 1307.1 mv, with the 100-w bulb. The temperature results really surprised me because as the temperature rose, the millivolts dropped and as the temperature decreased, the millivolts increased. From the inverse relationship between temperature and mv output, I can conclude that solar plants may also be built in cold climate areas with the same amount of sunlight as warm climate areas, and should obtain the same amount of, if not more, energy output from the solar cells.

CHARCOAL AND METHANOL SYNTHESIS BY THE DESTRUCTIVE DISTILLATION OF CELLULOSIC WASTE – CHEMICAL ANALYSIS AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS
David Junzi Wu
Cherry Creek High School, Greenwood Village, CO

The feasibility of using the products from the destructive distillation of biomass as a source of liquid biofuel (methanol) and fertilizer (char and other products) was examined. The analysis consisted of examining the energy balance and scalability of the distillation as well as the effect of the remaining products on the growth of plants.<br><br> <br><br>The distillation of different masses of wood splints indicated that as the mass of the splints increased, the total energy transferred into the system per gram reactant to drive the reaction varied inversely with the mass of the reactant, going from 95.3 kJ/g for a 0.51 g sample to 14.5 kJ/g for a 10.01 g sample. Similar inversely decaying energy curves were observed for the distillation of pine needles and maple tree branches. Also, the distillation time and products scaled linearly and predictably with increasing reactant mass.<br><br> <br><br>The effects of the char and residual solution from the distillation on the growth of plants were examined by planting mungbeans and gourds in four different environments: sterile topsoil+tap water, char-topsoil+tap water, topsoil+distillation solution, and char-topsoil+solution. Results indicated that mungbeans and gourds grown in the treatment environments generally developed longer stems and leaves at a faster rate.<br><br> <br><br>These results indicate that the destructive distillation process can be scaled to a larger, but still localized scale, as an energy-efficient means of diverting products from the waste stream into a source of liquid biofuel as well as a fertilizer that would reintroduce essential nutrients of life back into the soil.

THE EFFICIENCY OF VARIOUS SOLAR HEATING METHODS
Robert Royce Davis
Westview High School, Martin, TN

The purpose was to determine which solar heating method was most efficient at heating water. It was hypothesized that an active solar heating method would most efficiently heat water as it would utilize a wider spectrum of solar radiation. An experimental procedure was created to test the heating methods. The results from the test were used to compare the heating methods.<br><br> Six identical plastic flasks were used as the test containers. Four flasks were painted with white or black paint in one of two different patterns. The final flask was used in conjunction with a solar panel and NiChrome resistance heater. An electronic measuring device was used to record temperatures every 15 minutes over a 4-hour period (17 data points, includes initial) for each test container. Ambient conditions were recorded as these could influence the experimental results.<br><br> Tests conducted over a range of conditions confirmed the hypothesis. The solar panel consistently outperformed the other experimental subjects by several degrees; however, it did not perform well in testing conducted during rain, possibly due to refraction of solar radiation by droplets of water on the solar panel’s surface. The flask painted black on bottom performed almost as well as the solar panel flask.<br><br> This project’s results could be used to spur more research and development in regard to alternative energy sources. The results of the experimentation strongly suggest that the solar panel is the most efficient solar heating method; however, the flask painted black on the bottom also performed well.

IMPROVING SAFETY OF HYDROGEN GENERATION
Alexander Sergeevich Gandzyura
Ridgeview High School, Orange Park, FL

As oil crisis hits American drivers budgets, scientists search for cheap alternative energy sources. Hydrogen gas is one of cheap energy sources. Unfortunately, homemade hydrogen generators are built without understanding the electrolysis process. Hydrogen gas is a very flammable, and some accidents using it to power cars had been recorded. This project aims to improve safety of Hydrogen generator. The following objectives were investigated for this purpose: create suitable container design, stop leakage of gas, prevent backfire, and design portable system that works both for small engines and for bigger engines. The following results were obtained: PVC 4 in pipe was found to be best container for the generator. Special window grid solved problem getting water to car engine. A special separate unit had been designed that prevented backfire from small engines. The redesign of the hydrogen generator resulted in an overall system production of 1.72 L/ min.

EFFECTS OF VARIOUS PROPELLER DESIGNS ON THE EFFICIENCY OF AN UNDERWATER TURBINE
Scott Thomas Martin
Cherry Creek High School, Greenwood Village, CO

Ocean Current Energy or more specifically, In-Stream tidal energy is very closely associated with wind power and is an extremely efficient form of alternative energy that utilizes an underwater turbine turned by a propeller in order to harvest the energy of moving water. The greater density of water allows for more efficient energy harvest in a turbine turned by water in comparison to its wind counterparts at the same rate of fluid movement. In order to investigate the effects of propeller design on the efficiency and energy output of an Ocean Current turbine, a test chamber, built from 6” diameter PVC pipe 5’ in length, was constructed to simulate the constant flow of turbulence-free water found in many of the world’s large ocean currents and rivers. A simple electric DC motor, when fitted in the test chamber with a propeller, produced a constant flow of energy, which was measurable with a multi-meter. By fabricating 2” aluminum propellers, various variables, such as the number of blades and the blade angle, were compared and tested. Based on test results, the optimum propeller design consists of four blades at an angle between 20 and 30 degrees. This style of testing has also proved effective in micro-hydroelectric systems – in a second stage of experimentation, a 2” pipe was used with 2” propellers, and variables such as propeller design and head-height were tested for efficiency in a more condensed environment.

MICROBIAL CONVERSION OF GLUCOSE INTO LIPIDS USING MUNICIPAL WASTEWATER ACTIVATED SLUDGE MICROFLORA
Courtney Alexandria Ramsey
Mississippi School for Mathematics and Science, Columbus, MS

As an effect of the increasing demand for biodiesel, the demand for lipid feedstocks have also increased. This has led to concerns about providing enough feedstock to cater to the increasing demands for biodiesel in the next few years at the expense of the food manufacturing industry. A major challenge for the commercialization of biodiesel production using these feedstocks is the high cost of pure vegetable or seed oils. Thus, in order to reduce the cost per gallon of biodiesel, alternative feedstocks that are readily available in large quantities and at low cost must be used. Can we enhance the potential of municipal wastewater activated sludge as a source of lipid feedstock for the production of biodiesel? The current lipid yields need to be enhanced in order to make the lipid extraction from activated sludge more cost-competitive with respect to the conventional bio-fuel lipid feedstock (i.e., soybean oil). The lipid content of activated sludge microorganisms may be improved by cultivating them in an excess carbon medium using glucose as the carbon source. The goal is to reach at least a 20% lipid yield to meet the nation’s goal of replacing 20% of the fuel supply with renewable energy. Through cultivation experiments, it was proven that the lipid content of activated sludge microorganisms can be improved by cultivating them in an excess carbon medium using glucose as the carbon source. The high C:N ratio and glucose levels result in a high lipid percent yield.

SOLAR ACQUISITION
Shyamal Ashwin Patel
Saint Augustine High School, Saint Augustine, FL

With the Earth in danger of global warming and the threat of diminishing natural resources the world must find a solution. To begin to combat theses problems I believe our only answer is solar energy, a zero emission energy source. By converting our airplanes to an electric solar power system we will be able to reduce our daily pollution. The idea this year is to build an aircraft that will stay aloft for twenty four hours nonstop. This will be accomplished by the use of solar cells and lithium polymer batteries. The aircraft is made of carbon fiber composite in which is handmade. The overall aircraft design is made to be aerodynamic and consume the least amount of energy. Since the aircraft has been calculated to be so light a camera system will also be added to show the benefits of the aircraft. The airfoil was designed using wind tunnel data. The aircraft body was made on a lathe then made into a mold for the carbon fiber application. The fabrication of the wing was an original idea that uses less material than previous methods. The solar cells will have to produce twenty two volts at five amps to completely power the aircraft. The wing’s upper surface area is more than needed to house the solar cells that are required to meet the power needed. With the calculations so far it is plausible for the aircraft to achieve a twenty four hour flight.

THE APPLICATION OF MULTI-DIMENSIONAL FLOW VECTOR PROBES ON THE MODELING OF WINGTIP VORTICES
Mark Thomas Parrish
Chamberlain High School, Tampa, FL

The purpose of this experiment was to develop sensitive and accurate multi-dimensional flow measurement probes to use in wind tunnel studies. In addition, the secondary goal was to compare measured air flow to mathematically modeled vortices. The experimental phase of this project included the testing of a Boeing 737 scale wing in an open-ended wind tunnel using the multi-dimensional flow probes to detect flow distortions and changes. The probes were positioned in 1 cm increments in a 35 cm x 30 cm x 18 cm 3-Dimensional grid to generate flow mapping at different angles of attack (AOA) from 0° to 25°. Flow through the wind tunnel was kept laminar by use of a baffle and flow distribution devices.<br><br>Displacement of the fluid in the probes was recorded to infer wind flow direction across the horizontal and vertical planes of the probe head. This data mapped the actual flow and disturbances behind the wing. The measured data points were then compared to flow and wingtip vortices generated through mathematical means. A comparison of real versus idealized wind flow was conducted using linear regression, trend line analysis, and other statistical means. Results of this study indicate that it is possible to design an accurate three-dimensional wind measurement probe with inexpensive materials for wind-tunnel testing. Future study will include the use of transducers to create an electronic output from flow measurement probes that will allow for more accurate vector measurements as well as pressure readings.

This project is the study of an alternate way to produce renewable energy as efficiently as possible. The initial idea was to help citizens located in hot regions improve the effectiveness of their air condition units by relieving the power they use during hot months such as May through August. Success from a fresnel lens helped capture the sun's energy as efficiently as possible. From that energy that was captured, it was able to produce more energy than a photovoltaic cell. <br><br>The construction of a system in which to capture the sun's energy developed through the use of a fresnel lens and a boiler system along with a steam turbine to measure the efficiency of the this system. In order to certify the efficiency of the system it was compared to the output of a normal photovoltaic cell. Because of the size of the fresnel lens, the ratio of the size of the lens to the size of the cell was taken in order to compare the efficiency effectively. <br><br>The focal point produced from the fresnel lens was focused on a boiler, with a safety pressure release valve, filled with water to heat it. A valve secured on the boiler was opened to release steam produced. In order to measure the power produced by both the system and the photovoltaic cell, a 100Ω was connected and used to measure the power. <br><br>The effeciency was successfully produced from the system. The system was successfully created to capture the sun’s energy and create an alternate way to create renewable energy.

OPTIMIZING PERFORMANCE OF PLANETARY ROVER WHEELS IN VARIOUS SOILS
Ryan Baker
Midvale Middle School, Midvale, UT

When the rover Opportunity got stuck in sand on Mars, scientists had to work for over a month to free it. Consequently, researchers developed the idea of designing a reconfigurable wheel - a wheel that could change its shape to adapt to the terrain. The design objective of a reconfigurable wheel is to maximize DP (drawbar pull - the net force acting on the wheel) while minimizing T (torque). Researchers have prototyped a reconfigurable wheel as proof of concept, but it’s unknown how much size variation is needed for optimum wheel performance. The purpose of this project is to investigate how varying wheel width and wheel diameter changes DP and T in different soils. Six different wheel sizes representing possible rover wheels were tested in sand, gravel, and rock. Radial basis functions were used to interpolate the data and produce DP and T as functions of wheel width and diameter. The effect of changing width or diameter on DP and T was determined for each soil. The results led to the discovery that there exists a “flip point” at which increasing wheel width or wheel diameter changes from having a positive impact on wheel performance to having a negative impact. Information gained from the data analysis can be used to improve the reconfigurable wheel design by ensuring that the wheel changes shape in ways that will positively impact wheel performance, allowing rovers used for planetary exploration, search and rescue, or military purposes to traverse more types of terrain and soil.

BIODIESEL: WHAT PROCESS IS BEST FOR CREATING BIODIESEL FROM WASTE VEGETABLE OIL?
Brian Patrick Ribbans
Mount Saint Joseph Academy, Rutland, VT

Biodiesel made from waste vegetable oil can be a viable alternative to petroleum based fuel. It is possible that biodiesel will be one of the many solutions for sustainable alternative fuels. This experiment examines the results of varying the conditions during the transesterification process used make biodiesel from waste vegetable oil. Transesterification is the process of breaking down esters, fat molecules, using alcohol and a catalyst. The process produces a refined ester, biodiesel, and glycerin as a by product. The experimentation of the processing stage will include varying amounts of methanol, sodium hydroxide, and temperature. <br><br>To produce high quality biodiesel, the results of the transesterification process require additional processing to remove impurities, mainly glycerin, suspended in the oil. This is done by mixing water with the oil. The glycerin and impurities will dissolve in the water and separate from the oil. A dry washing method is also possible. Magnesol is added in with the processed oil to absorb the impurities. The Magnesol with the impurities are then filtered out. The completed oil must pass three tests. They are tested for a complete reaction, the absence of impurities and pH levels. <br><br>Altering the process has dramatic affects on the result of the reaction and ultimately the quality of the biodiesel. The affects of varying the amount of lye, methanol and heat in the reaction will be apparent by the outcome of the biodiesel with a pH that is too high, an incomplete reaction and/or biodiesel with too many impurities. After testing, it is concluded that not using enough methanol, using too much or too little catalyst, and using a temperature that is too high or too low will produce poor quality and unusable biodiesel that is unable to pass one or more of the qualifying tests.

ANALYSIS TO CONTROL A SOLAR PANEL EFFECTIVELY
Erika Lynn Steinbauer
Ronald W Reagan/Doral Senior High School, Miami, FL

A solar panel absorbs light through photocells and converts it into electricity, whereas a light dependent resistor (LDR) is a cell that resists a higher voltage from the circuit the lower the light intensity. The purpose was to see if there was a relationship between a LDR and a solar panel that could control a light dependent circuit effectively. In order to find this result, the effect by the change in light intensity was tested with both a LDR and a solar panel. At first, separately, and then these separate results were compared to see if they could be used to show how they can work together. It has been established that a LDR resists more the less light it receives, just as the solar panel can absorb less energy as the light intensity becomes darker. Three trials of data on the changes in light intensity were graphically and mathematically compared. This found how both the LDR and the solar panel were affected by the light intensity and, therefore, how they related to each other and if they could be put together to make a continuous circuit. When the light intensity is too low for the solar panel, the LDR would then trigger the battery to begin working. This could make machines in hospitals, or even something as simple as a light, consistently remain running using solar energy even when there is not enough light intensity for the circuit to work.

THE EFFECT OF PRE-HEATING A FUEL-AIR MIXTURE ON ITS COMBUSTION HEAT YIELD
John Mark Helfer
Bishop Donahue High School, McMechen, WV

This experiment was conducted to determine if pre-heating a fuel-vapor would improve its heat yield when combusted, thereby improving fuel economy.<br><br>In the pre-heated experimental trials, steam was forced through a homemade heat exchanger to heat fuel-vapor (0.1ml 87-Octane gasoline) inside a calorimeter until the temperature reached 500C or greater. The steam source was then removed and the temperature in the calorimeter allowed to stabilize. A model rocket igniter inside the calorimeter was triggered igniting the fuel-vapor. The beginning and ending temperatures were recorded.<br><br>In the same way, trials were then conducted without pre-heating the fuel-vapor in the calorimeter. Again, the beginning and ending temperatures were recorded.<br><br>The results of the pre-heated fuel vapor trials demonstrated an effect on the resulting heat yield, indicated by the temperature increase inside the calorimeter following ignition. The average temperature rise for the pre-heated trials was 5.70C. The average temperature rise for the unheated trials was 4.90C. The resultant difference between unheated and pre-heated was 0.80C.<br><br>In conclusion, the results suggest that pre-heating fuel-vapor prior to combustion may result in a higher energy yield. In the case of a gasoline engine, this might translate into increased fuel economy.

THE EFFECTS OF FUEL SUPPLEMENTS ON A RIDING LAWNMOWER
Lance Alexander Snead, Jacob Mann, 
Dutchtown High School, Hampton, GA

Lawnmowers and other motorized yard equipment are among the most pollutant motorized engines in the world. Hydrogen fuel is an alternative fuel which can be used as a supplement or a replacement of gasoline. This is especially important now that we have seen the volatile nature of the prices of petroleum products. Using the process of electrolysis of water to separate water into its components, we produced hydrogen to supplement gasoline. We ran these gases into the air intake manifold of a lawnmower engine. The purpose of our project was to determine what effects using electrolysis had on the lawnmower's performance and to determine if it would reduce overall emissions of the combustion engine. Our control was running the lawnmower using regular unleaded gasoline without any fuel supplements. The independent variable test was running the lawnmower using the fuel supplements from electrolysis. The dependent variable was the running time of the lawnmower with just 29.57ml of gasoline in the engine. The results indicated that the average control running time was 1:09 whereas the average running time with the electrolysis fuel supplements was 1:23. We experimented further by compressing the gases. According to the results, the pressurized fuel supplements had an average running time of 1:29 and the compressed oxygen had a running time of 1:24. We also added a larger compressed fuel cell and compared its results to the original cell. Also, we tested the emissions of the control and the electrolysis testing. The supplemented fuel test had about 0.4% less of Carbon dioxide output and about 0.8% less Carbon monoxide output than the emissions of a gasoline only run. However, it also had about a 17ppm higher output of Nitrogen oxides than the gasoline only run. The electrolysis fuel supplements also increased the hydrocarbon output by about 126ppm from the gasoline only run. Throughout all of our experimentation, the compressed gases from the electrolysis of the larger fuel cell proved to be the most efficient fuel supplement.

IT'S GETTING H.A.W.T. IN HERE: AN ANALYSIS OF THE EFFICIENCY OF VARIOUS AIRFOIL DESIGNS ON A HORIZONTAL WIND TURBINE
Joseph Edward Lane, Nicolas NaSal, 
Burnsville Senior High School, Burnsville, MN

With the escalated consumption of fossil fuels and the damaging effects the combustion and use of these products have on the environment, people are looking to renewable energy resources for power. To meet the demand of current consumption, these means of harnessing the sources of renewable energy performance must be at the maximum efficiency. Wind turbines are considered to be one of the most cost-effective, pollution free, and stable source of renewable energy, to further maximize efficiency would only assist further in its acceptance and use by the public. The hypothesis that of the four blades being tested (A1, a blade with no evident airfoil; A2, a blade with a large airfoil; A3, the thinner airfoil blade, and A4, a biomimicry blade based on studies on dolphin hydrodynamics) A3 would prove to be the most efficient because it possesses the lift of an airfoil; it also has less drag and a front edge that is free of added resistance. We found that the most efficient at the 6 mph wind speed the blades were tested at was A1, the blade lacking an airfoil. This was most likely due to the lack of resistance since it was without any airfoil and was able to overcome the initial static friction of the D/C motor to which the blades were attached. Future research includes testing at higher wind speeds, manipulating the angle of attack, expanding designs to vertical axis turbines and other horizontal models.

The aim of this project is to increase the efficiency in solar panels by increasing the number of photons coming to the unit area. The method used to this is done by copying the multy-lenses system in the insect eyes. This system consist of focusing different lenses, as its' in insect eye, to the same area with different angles.<br><br>The advantage of this system is to avoid the panel from being damaged by spreading the light-heat homogenously. The inevitable extra heat is put in use via the hybrid system added.<br><br>In this hybrid system the existing water is heated as well as the extra heat in the panel is absorbed.<br><br>This system differs from other solar collectors in the way that electricity and heat are produced with mutual interaction.<br><br>Futuremore, because the system is 3-dimensional, there is no need to use photosensors to collect light from different angles.

Driving optimal price to efficiency ratios in solar cells is critical to mass deployment of the technology to drive a more environmentally friendly future. The potential of using cheaper alternatives to expensive chemical dyes to create more affordable solar cells formed the basis for this experiment. <br><br>Dyes extracted from fruits such as blueberries and strawberries as well as flowers such as hibiscuses are abundant and could possibly be an alternate for the dye used in today's dye-sensitized solar cells. Considering dark colors absorb more light, it was hypothesized that the blueberry-dye would perform the best.<br><br>After constructing four different solar cells, each was exposed to four different light conditions. The cell with no applied dye produced the least amount of voltage, while the hibiscus-dye cell produced the greatest. These results varied from those that were hypothesized, as the hibiscus-dye outperformed the blueberry-dye. More importantly though, the output of the homemade and professionally made cells was relatively similar. This is significant in it validates the idea that organic dyes can potentially be used to create more affordable yet still efficient solar cells. <br><br>Next steps in this research could include studying other organic dyes, such as oranges, as well as inorganic dyes, such as paint. Examination of the key elements, as well as examining the lifespan of the organic-dye solar cells as compared to chemical-dye solar cells are other steps that can be taken.

PUTTING HUMANS TO "WORK": GENERATING USABLE ELECTRICITY FROM WASTED ENERGY
Matthew Storm Bull, Forrest Pieper, 
Nederland High School, Nederland, CO

In response to the growing energy crisis, this project was designed to examine the small scale generation of electricity from daily activities. A prototype step that translates the gravitational potential energy of a person walking down a stair into usable electricity was designed and built in order to investigate the plausibility of this method of generation.<br><br>The stair was built with four main systems: a general structure, a return system that utilizes springs, a generation system that uses a rack and pinion gear apparatus to translate the linear motion into rotational motion for generating electricity, and an energy usage system that converts the electricity generated to either direct or alternating current. Once these systems were designed and installed, testing of the stair was done to measure the voltage, current, and time of each step, which in turn was used to calculate the energy generated.<br><br>The data collected showed significant amounts of electricity were generated by the stair. Through testing of revision four, an average of 2.95 joules were produced per step. A maximum of 15.05 joules per step were generated, showing that a more consistent stair could possibly generate significant amounts of electricity through large amounts of use.<br><br>These results support the plausibility of the generation of appreciable amounts of electricity in large human foot traffic areas such as transit stations or stadiums. Results from revision four suggest that there is further room for improvement; the overall efficiency of the system can be greatly increased in future revisions.

The coffee bean mucilage is a byproduct resulting from processing of coffee beans. It is used as food for some animals and for land enrichment and the waste is discarded to near water flow which produces a serious problem for environment. The two main goals of our research were to obtain ethanol from coffee beans mucilage by using anaerobic fermentation with Sacharomyces cereviceae and to isolate a native yeast strain to replace S. cereviceae in this process.<br><br>In this way the coffee beans mucilage can be used in a productive manner with not contamination to produce biocombustible. An industrial application of our results could generate new jobs in regions with coffee plantation improving the economic situation of poor areas and at the same time decrease the environmental effect of a waste product. <br><br>This research was made by obtaining the mucilage from a coffee farm in the municipality of Caldas, Antioquia, Colombia. During the first step we evaluted the production of ethanol by fermentation of mucilage by mixing a fixed volume of sterilized mucilage with increasing amounts of S. cereviceae during five days. The samples that show the higher CO2 emission were chose to be distillated.<br><br> <br><br>For the second step four different samples of coffee beans (waste product, mucilage, old-aged shell and recent shell) were analyzed to determine the native strains of the yeast. The yeasts were isolated by culturing the samples in PDA (potato, dextrose, agar) and their yield to produce ethanol were compared to production by S. cereviceae.

THE COMPARISON OF INCANDESCENT AND COMPACT FLUORESCENT LIGHT BULBS
Rachel Lynne Parry, Cory Daniel Lovec, 
Carter County High School, Ekalaka, MT

The purpose of this experiment was to test the overall effectiveness of incandescent and compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFL) when they were both used in different environments. The overall hypothesis was that the CFL bulbs would have an overall higher performance than incandescent light bulbs, but would not be as effective as advertised. To test the hypothesis, the average wattage use of each type of bulb was tested first, using two separate power meters. It was found that the CFL used the amount of wattage advertised and used a significantly lower average wattage than the incandescent bulb. Although the incandescent bulb used a much greater average wattage than the CFL, fewer watts per hour were used than advertised.<br><br><br><br>The light intensity of each bulb was then tested; the data showed that the incandescent bulb had a significantly higher output. Of the environments in which the bulbs were tested, the optical output was most affected by cold temperature. Both the light intensity of the CFL and of the incandescent bulb decreased from the light intensity they produced at room temperature in the colder environment. In the hot environment, the light intensity of the CFL was unaffected, whereas the light intensity of the incandescent bulb increased. Further investigations of this project would include a test comparing light intensities when each type of bulb is used in high humidity low humidity areas. LEDs would also be compared, and intensities would be compared using an infrared light blocker to eliminate any infrared light bias.

A NEW SPIN ON GRAVITY
Andrew Philip Ter Haar, Sam Baas, 
Unity Christian High School, Orange City, IA

The purpose of our experiment was to explore conditions necessary to create a centrifugal force that could be perceived as artificial gravity in a rotating wheel. Our research suggested that a rotating space station would provide the centripetal force to create one g by varying the radius or the angular velocity. This inward centripetal force would create a perceived outward centrifugal force which could simulate gravity.<br><br> A wheel was mounted horizontally and driven by a 12v motor. We downloaded a g-meter application for the iPod touch. (The g-meter works with iPod's built in accelerometers). We attached a meter stick to the wheel to be able to test changes in radius. The iPod was then attached to the wheel and meter stick at different radii of 9 inches, 18 inches, and 27 inches. The RPM was then varied to create the desired g-force of .5g, 1g, or 2g's.<br><br> Our experimental data to determine g-force for a specific RPM and radius agreed very closely with our theoretical predictions. Using a radius range of 9-27 inches and an RPM range of 36-63 RPM’s, the g value was within 10% of each g-value. <br><br> We conclude the g force is directly proportional to the radius of the wheel and to the square of the angular velocity based on measurements for .5g, 1g, and 2g's. We conclude that we can create varying amounts of artificial gravity (using centrifugal forces) by spinning a wheel with different radii at different RPM's.

WHEN PIGS FLY: A STUDY OF LIFT WITHOUT DRAG
Noelle Vinas, Alex Kaplan, 
Lake Braddock Secondary School, Burke, VA

Aircraft designers have an overwhelming array of choices when selecting an airfoil design that fits the flow regime of their aircraft (e.g. low Reynolds Number, transonic, supersonic). It is in low Reynolds numbers that birds, insects, and fish maneuver. This has, however, proven difficult for controlled human flight. We designed our experiment to isolate characteristics of airfoils that contribute to lift in low Reynolds number flows.<br><br>We designed and constructed a wind tunnel to experimentally determine lift. Lift is calculated by measuring mass changes that the wind tunnel generates and with a lift coefficient formula. We chose five published airfoils, each with distinct characteristics reported to affect lift. Our research predicted an airfoil exhibiting lower camber concavity and a downward trailing edge can achieve higher lift coefficients. Using the highest performing airfoils, we varied isolated dimensional aspects. Coordinates of the best airfoils were then interpolated to determine the possibility of designing an improved airfoil that exploited optimal features.<br><br>Results showed that concavity (in the Eppler) and thickness (typified by the Goettingen) gave the highest peaks with lift coefficients of 2.14 and 2.26 respectively. Our “optimized” profile exhibited an average of the two lift curves, and was therefore not what we expected. These results suggest that our hypothesis is incomplete, and needs modification stating the interdependence of trailing edge profiles and thickness. However, the second part of our hypothesis was soundly proven, considering how well the Eppler tested, but we also discovered that thickness generates a surprisingly high coefficient of lift.

THE OPTIMIZATION OF MICROBIAL FUEL CELL POTENTIAL
Ian Chan, Alex Wang, 
Plano East Senior High School, Plano, TX

The microbial fuel cell is a relatively new approach in the search for alternative fuel. This technology uses an electron acceptor to draw electrons released during the metabolism of certain bacteria into an external circuit. Because it is environmentally friendly and uses an inexhaustible fuel source, these cells have the potential to evolve into a leading energy producer. In the experiment, the attempt was not to generate massive amounts of voltage, but instead to determine the factors that could be manipulated to increase voltage output. Using the bacteria Rhodoferax ferrireducens, a semi-permeable sheet of Nafion membrane, and graphite plates as the electron acceptor, cells were constructed and several aspects were altered to acquire the optimal configuration. It was determined that larger graphite surface area, larger membrane surface area, and lower cathode medium pH would allow for the greatest voltage production. Even with relatively small model cells that held around only 425 cubic centimeters of medium, over 600 mV of electricity was produced. By scaling up the size of these cells, much more electricity could be produced. The applications of these budget friendly cells are limitless, ranging anywhere from powering minuscule arbitrary devices to treatment of waste water in sewage plants.

EXTRACTION OF ALGAE LIPIDS THROUGH USE OF AN ORGANIC, NATURAL SOLVENT AND THROUGH SOLIDIFICATION OF THE CELL

Northwestern Area High School, Mellette, SD

The basis of our project was to collect algae, harvest the lipids from the algae using two methods, exposing the cells to hexane and freezing the cells, burn the lipids, and measure the energy given off.<br><br>We collected, cleaned, and to extract the lipids from the algae, we used two methods, exposing the algae to hexane and freezing the cell. After using our two methods, we burned the algae-lipid mixture to show that algae lipids are able to be burned as a potential fuel source. As part of our combustion process, we burned a pure sample of dried algae for comparison.<br><br>The most promising samples of algae that were exposed to hexane were algae 7, algae 10, and algae 11. The numerical value represents how many milliliters of hexane were added to .25 grams of algae. They showed the highest amount of joules per gram as compared to the pure algae sample. The energy they produced was similar to that of three calories.<br><br>Exposing algae cells to hexane and freezing the cells succeeded in releasing the algae lipids. Hexane exposure as a method for extraction works, but other more efficient methods exist. The algae lipids burned more readily than the algae fibers that were unexposed to either method.<br><br>Hexane is a very toxic solvent, leaving no usable byproducts. In future years, we plan to use a less harmful, natural solvent to make our process more efficient. Doing this enables us to use every part of the algae thallus.

MOTION OF THE OCEAN PART 2: A STUDY OF WAVE ENERGY ON ST. CROIX
Ashlee Erica Douglas, Kristian Fennessy, 
The Good Hope School, Frederiksted, St. Croix, VIRGIN ISLANDS

There are not any “quick fixes or shortcuts to ensuring a safe and stable energy future” (Inter-American Development Bank, 2006). For the needs of the Caribbean no one solution is sufficient, but rather a combination of many is more promising (CARICOM, 2007). Potentially, one of the solutions could be wave energy. The purpose of this investigation was to find out if there are any locations surrounding St. Croix that produce a substantial amount of potential wave energy as calculated by the equation:<br><br><br>(kW/m)= p x g^2 x a^2 x T/8 x pi<br><br><br><br>p=density of sea water (1025 kg/m)<br><br>g=acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s2)<br><br>a=wave amplitude (m)<br><br>T=wave period (sec/wave)<br><br><br><br>The hypothesis was that the south shore locations would produce the most potential power based on last year’s data. An Aquadopp device was used to measure the wave height and the wave period needed for the potential power equation. Results showed that the north shore location, Cramer’s Park, produced the most potential power (8068 kW/m). The west side location, Frederiksted, produced the least amount of potential power (263 kW/m). The St. Thomas data indicates that most productive season for waves is from November to April. In conclusion, the best region for future wave research and harnessing wave power is the north side. Future studies would be conducting a year-long experiment to expand our knowledge of St. Croix’s wave energy potential and placing wave energy converters. St. Croix is surrounded by waves and it’s time to take a look into power that is held there.

NEW SUSTAINED GREEN HYDROGEN ERA: AN OXY HYDROGEN GENERATOR
Alexander Collado-Mendez, Gaddiel Francisco Ruiz Rivera, 
Juan Quirindongo High School, Vega Baja, PUERTO RICO

According to the Internal Emergency Agency seventeen percent (17%) of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions come from the burning of fossil fuels used for road transportation. It’s necessary to find ways to reduce those emissions using alternate fuels. Can an oxy hydrogen generator be designed to produce fuel and to reduce gasoline consumption as well as gases emissions or fumes? The hypothesis was that if a more efficient and safer oxy hydrogen generator that uses the electrolysis process can be built and assembled into a car system, then hydrogen can be used as fuel, reducing gasoline consumption and fumes emissions. An oxy hydrogen generator was built using reused materials. This generator was installed in a car using the battery as its source of energy. The oxy hydrogen produced reaches the engine combustion chamber where the oxygen is oxidized while the hydrogen is used as fuel. It was found that the mileage of the car increased from 15 miles per liter to 53 miles per liter when the generator of hydrogen was used. The performance of the car was improved and the emissions were reduced only to water as the final product. It can be concluded that, as stated in the hypothesis, hydrogen can be used as a fuel, reducing gasoline consumption and fumes emissions.

MAGNETISM: OUR FUTURE SOURCE OF ENERGY
Erika Marie Cortes, Glorimar Zeno Rosario, 
Juan Serralles High School, Coto Laurel, PUERTO RICO

Could magnetic energy be our future energy source? If the facts found in different types of references are analyzed then it could be determined that magnetic energy is going to be the solution for replacing petroleum and at the same time is going to become our new energy source. The aim of this project was to create awareness about the problem of possible lack of oil in the future. Data from different sources was collected and analyzed. Studies addressing the issue were reviewed. Graphics on the consumption of oil at the international level and its current reduction as a source of energy were done. A table comparing the advantages and disadvantages of magnetic energy was prepared. Many things were learned. For example John Christie and Edge Hil, are two Australians who invented a machine using magnets. They want to establish and market it in Australia and later import it to other countries. Walter Torbey is the person who created a trans-generator in 2003 using magnets. Both machines are 100% ecological and economical. Moreover, these would last approximately 5,000 years with zero fuel cost. Literature research leads to conclude that it is possible to create a magnetic energy generator, which could be used in the future as a main source of energy. These generators could evolve so that cars, aircraft, electrical equipment, computers, etc; would work using magnetic energy.

For environmental and economical reasons it is extremely attractive to substitute conventional gasoline with suitable and sustainable alternatives. Ethanol is the most established of such additives.<br><br>Besides ethanol, ethyl acetate – a by-product (up to 30%) from the pyrolysis production of short chained alcohols – was analysed. Ethyl acetate contains the same amount of energy/volume as ethanol. Ethyl acetate, therefore, has same environmental advantages plus a huge economical impact..<br><br>The aim is to 1) find the optimal additive(s) and combinations of these - not requiring modifications to existing motor-technology, 2) analyse the effect(s), 3) perform tests on a power generator (PG) and 4) show proof-of-concept (POC) on a regular car.<br><br>Using the PG, a heat gun, multimeters and a gas analyser many different parameters were collected. The power delivered by the PG was calculated and compared to the exhaust-temperature and the exhaust-composition. <br><br>For POC, the power delivered by the test-car for different compositions of gasoline was determined and the exhaust-composition followed.<br><br>For the PG, there is no significant change in mileage upon substituting due to cleaner combustion. But an increased motor-temperature limited the percentage of substitution to 30%. For POC, the car-test showed that more than 80% of conventional gasoline can be substituted with only a linear decrease in mileage due to the 50% lower energy content of the substitutes.<br><br>An 80%-substitution is surprisingly high compared to current standards (5%).<br><br>Such highly substituted hybrid fuels have a very high potential for future exploitation – both from an environmental and financial point of view.

THE EFFECT OF VARIABLE MICROORGANISMS AND PH ON THE EFFICIENCY OF A MICROBIAL FUEL CELL
Cheng Cheng, Aakriti Jain, 
Lynbrook High School, San Jose, CA

In light of depleting fossil fuels and their harm to the environment, there has been development in renewable sources of energy. The microbial fuel cell (MFC) is one such development; it is unique in that its only byproduct is water, and it uses microbes to generate energy. Our goal was to optimize this system's electrical output and stability, and to do so we tested MFC’s with varying microorganisms and pH levels in the anode. We hypothesized that E. coli would produce the most stable voltage due to its popular use in the scientific community, and that S. cerevisiae would produce the highest voltage since they are very active metabolically. We also believed that a pH of 6.0 would produce the highest voltage since these microorganisms’ thrive in mildly acidic environments. To determine the effect of these variables on the efficiency of microbial fuel cells, we built and tested 6 MFCs in six independent trials: using E. coli, S. cerevisiae, or I. galbana as the microorganisms, under pH conditions of 6, 6.5, or 7. Half of the cells had a cathode solution of H2O with dissolved oxygen, while the other half used H2O2, in order to account for the limited amount of dissolved oxygen in the cathode half-cell of our trials. The cells were assembled accordingly and the electrical potential (voltage) was measured daily using a multimeter. Our results show that S. cerevisiae produced the most stable voltage with the least day to day fluctuation as compared to the other trials. Although all three microbes produced a similar range of voltages, there was a global trend based on pH level: as pH increases, voltage decreases, indicating that a more acidic anode solution results in a higher voltage. This experiment shows that in terms of stability the yeast fuel cells are the most stable, whereas achieving a high voltage output depends more on the environment the microorganisms are in rather than the type of microorganism themselves. Therefore, in future studies of microbial fuel cells, it may be helpful to focus on altering the solutions, rather than the microbe, in the anode half-cell in order to optimize the efficiency of microbial fuel cells.

NOVEL WATER LENS FOR COST-EFFECTIVE ELECTRICITY GENERATION
Ashutosh Patra, Siheng You, 
Sunset High School, Portland, OR

Conventional hydrocarbon based energy sources have negative repercussions on the environment, which will continue to increase with the demand for energy. Harnessing solar energy could alleviate these problems. Currently, commercial solar energy is produced by combining parabolic mirrors with photo-voltaic or solar-thermal systems. The parabolic mirrors focus solar rays onto collecting systems to generate electricity. Today, solar energy costs around 22 cents/kWh compared to 7.8 cents/kWh for conventional energy. This high cost inhibits development and deployment of solar energy systems; therefore this project explored alternative economical solar concentrators.<br><br> A water lens, due to its low cost, availability, and durability was found to be the most feasible alternative. The project was divided into three sections: Theoretical Analysis, Construction and Experimentation, and Electricity Cost Modeling. First, the effectiveness of different lens designs was compared using computer models and equations. Then, the optimal design was constructed and tested experimentally to determine the concentrating efficiency of the lens. Finally, projections of the amortized cost of electricity from a water-lens and a parabolic mirror were compared against conventional energy prices. <br><br> Results showed that the water-lens would produce electricity at the same cost as conventional energy in just 13 years as opposed to 22 years for parabolic mirrors. After 40 years of operation, water-lens electricity will be approximately 1/7 the cost of conventional energy. Water-lenses have relatively longer life times, lower maintenance costs, and are more easily manufactured than parabolic mirrors. They offer a promising, environmentally friendly solution to mitigate the global energy crisis.

PUBLICLY OPTIMIZED WHEEL-GENERATED ENERGY RECYCLING (POWER) SYSTEM: CONVERSION OF VEHICULAR MOMENTUM VIA IMPULSE TURBINES TO GENERATE USABLE ENERGY
Michael Daniel Simon, Sanjay Menon, 
Chamblee Charter High School, Chamblee, GA

A tremendous amount of energy is lost in the movement of vehicles along roads. There exists significant potential for recapturing this energy for additional use. The Publicly Optimized Wheel-Generated Energy Recycling (POWER) System serves as a mechanism for harnessing this energy. <br><br>The POWER System works on the principle of an impulse turbine, with a rod acting as the rotor. When a vehicle drives over the rod, the previously wasted energy is harnessed as a result of the rod’s rotational movement. The system is engineered to create a minimal change in the road surface, allow widespread application, and provide an efficient means of energy production. Without the redesign of vehicles or modification of people’s behavior, the POWER System can be implemented in such places as tollbooths and exit-ramps, where people are already prepared for changes in the road surface. <br><br>The feasibility and efficiency of the POWER System were calculated through the production of a scaled model as well as a computer-generated dynamic simulation. The scaled model simulated a vehicle rolling over the system at variable speeds, while the dynamic simulation demonstrated a full-scale implementation. Data from the simulations showed an overall mean output of 60% of the initial energy input with a minimum and maximum of 40% and 80%, respectively. <br><br>The POWER System can generate renewable energy from a previously unharnessed source of energy. Through further development, the system could be widely implemented and potentially serve as a simple and cost-effective means of energy production.

GROWTH AND ENERGY POTENTIAL OF ALGAE
Samuel Robert Taylor, Brian Oldham, 
University School of Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI

In light of the recent climate and non-renewable fuel crisis, our project was focused on algae's unique ability to sequester carbon dioxide and produce energy.<br><br>Using an airtight container and CO2, O2 and dissolved 02 sensors, we tested phytoplankton to learn how they respire and grow under normal, and CO2 enriched conditions. Our results indicated that, when exposed to an excess of CO2 (produced through a reaction of CaCO3 and HCl), photosynthetic organisms consumed the CO2 and produced more oxygen. After this, we focused on growth in excess CO2 environment using pond-water samples. One sample was the control and the other was saturated with CO2 several times over the course of 17 days. After filtering and drying both samples, the sample exposed to CO2 had visibly more growth and twice the biomass of the control sample. Then, using calorimetry, we discovered that an algae sample exposed to CO2 and then dried produced more energy per gram than the control dried sample (6.3 kj/g vs. 4.3 kj/g). Later experimentation with algae saturated mediums (e.g. sponge) indicated that sequestration was aided by larger surface areas.<br><br>To solve error issues inherent in our small scale trials, and to focus our experiments on a specific algae species, we produced a large culture of lipid-rich Neochloris Oleoabundans and experimented with variables such as light and CO2 concentration. Through spectrophotometric, pH, and dissolved O2 analysis, we learned that LED light sources promoted the most growth per watt of energy and that CO2 enhanced environments are most effective at very low concentrations for this species.<br><br>Our experiments demonstrate that algae systems could pottentialy offset emissions by creating accessible energy from non-combustible carbon in the atmosphere.

SHIELDING IONIZING RADIATION THROUGH THE USE OF A MAGNETIC FIELD TO FURTHER DEEP SPACE TRAVEL
Jonathan Tyler Calton, Alex Curry, 
Sunlake High School, Land O' Lakes, FL

Currently deep space travel is inhibited because ionizing radiation found in deep space endangers the lives of astronauts, hindering the opportunity for research and new discoveries. Space travel is essential in the expansion of human knowledge and to protect astronauts from ionizing radiation we hypothesize that a magnetic field can be created on a space shuttle to shield the radiation. The magnetic field would simulate a magnetosphere and block ionizing radiation.<br><br>To test our hypothesis, we first tested the concept. We took the cathode ray tube from an old TV. and tested to see if the electrons emitted by the cathode ray tube would be blocked by a magnetic field. Once we proved this concept, which relates to ionizing radiation because ionizing radiation mostly consists of electrons, we created and solved an equation that applied to shielding ionizing radiation. This equation allowed us to see what size magnet would be needed to create a magnetic field strong enough to block incoming ionizing radiation. We followed this procedure:<br><br>F=q(v×B)<br><br>Substitute Force (F) for kinetic energy. (1/2mv²)/d=q(v×B)<br><br>Undo cross product.(1/2mv²)/d=qvb<br><br>Isolate B. B=[(1/2mv²)/d]/(qv)<br><br>Insert numbers for variables<br><br>After we solved our equation we took our answer, which was in Teslas, and did research on what size magnet would be needed to create a magnetic field strong enough to block the ionizing radiation. Just as our hypothesis has stated, we found out that it was practical to create a magnetic field on a space shuttle to shield ionizing radiation because the magnet would not exceed the weight allowances on the shuttle. Our data showed that a .2 Tesla magnetic field would be all that was needed to block the incoming ionizing radiation. After all of our data was collected and analyzed, we concluded that it was practical and also cost effective to use electromagnetic fields to shield ionizing radiation. Space travel would no longer be inhibited by ionizing radiation if a magnetic field strong enough to shield the ionizing radiation is used.

Katie Ann Chiasson
St. James High School, St. James, LA

Is solar power practical for Lousisana? Solar power has become very popular in the world today, especially in the United States. Solar power is using the energy from the sun, and I knew due to the warmer climates of Lousiaian during the summer, fall, and spring that this area would be the perfect place for using solar power. So, what about the winter, what about when it is less sunny and much colder outside? This is what my solar water heater was created to find out I placed it into my yard for numerous trials, and came up with my results based on the temperature of the water verses the the temperature outside for the day for each of the trials. I came to find out that yes, my hypothesis was not proven incorrect and that based on my findings solar power is practical for Louisiana all year round. Therefore by using the power of the sun as an alternitave source of energy, Louisiana could become a much more energy efficiant place to live.

GENERATING ELECTRICITY FROM CACTUS
Razan Hamzeh Abdul-Nabi
Pineer Center for Talented Students, Al korah, JORDAN

This study aimed to determine the ability of generating electricity from cutting pieces of Cactus plate and time period of continuously feeding up LED lamp with constant voltage and current , beside studying the effect of electrodes kind and their size on the produced voltage, and determine the enough minimum number of cactus pieces to make 3&5mm LED lamp start lighting up. By using very cheap electrodes the experiment was carried out because one of the most goals of the project was to develop a cheap battery, an Cu/Mg electrodes and wires were used to connect the cactus pieces in series. The results showed that the cactus electrochemical cells with Cu/Mg electrode generating voltage by 39% more than the cells which use Cu/Fe electrodes, for that the generated voltage form 8 cells with Cu/Fe electrodes was semi close to the generated voltage from 4 cells with Cu/Mg electrodes, beside that the results showed that no effect for both of electrode and cactus pieces sizes on the generated voltage.In addition the minimum number to light up 3mm LED lamp was on piece whereas 2 pieces were enough to light up 5mm LED lamp. The voltage stability data for 40 hours showed a decrement by 11% after 40 hours of starting the experiment. Regarding to the current of 12 cells connected in series it was 225µA in the beginning then decreased in the first five hours after that it started rise up again until reach high value (238 µA).thus by using 6 pieces semi stable and continuously potential difference was generated for more than 4 days.In addition the directly generated potential difference values from the plates of cactus tree were semi equal to values of the isolated pieces which mean the capability of generating electricity from cactus tree directly. The collected data showed the cactus pieces capable to generate electricity for more than 100 hours. So, the experiments proved the high efficiency of using cactus pieces and tree to generate electricity. Otherwise the electrolytic solution inside the cactus plates is responsible for the generated electricity due its content of citric and mallic acid which is produced through photosynthesis process.

THE APPLICATION OF AN ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION COIL INPUT FREQUENCY GRADIENT TO CONJOIN THE LIFT AND PROPULSION SYSTEMS OF AN ELECTROMAGNETIC SUSPENSION VEHICLE
Christopher Joseph Davlantes
Bishop Kenny High School, Jacksonville, FL

A new mode of transportation is emerging: magnetic levitation. Electromagnetic suspension (EMS) systems boast a high efficiency, accompanied by many applications.<br><br>There are many ways to induce magnetic levitation, ranging from implementing superconductors to accelerating solid state magnets. One method appears to be more versatile than the others, levitation with alternating eddy currents. Because this system does not require supercooling or immense speeds to operate, it is potentially more efficient than its related phenomena. This project was performed to design and fabricate a new species of EMS train that uses coil input frequency variations to combine the vehicle’s lift and propulsion systems.<br><br>Twelve coils were created out of copper magnet wire. They had 165 turns with a diameter of 14.5 cm. The coils were arranged such that they created a type of track, over which a piece of aluminum could levitate. A circuit was designed to power every other coil in the track with either 500 or 60 hz at a given moment in time. Because frequency is directly proportional to inductive reactance which correlates directly to magnetic flux, creating a frequency gradient also generated a magnetic pressure gradient across the track of coils. Since a levitating piece of aluminum will tend to accelerate towards the area of less pressure, creating a frequency gradient will result in both levitating and propelling an aluminum disk across the coil track.<br><br>Although this system does not yet match the efficiencies of current maglev trains, it provides a new pathway which leads to endless possibilities. By designing a new system, an alternate playing field has been introduced into the study of EMS trains. Further developing this new concept may be able to yield more efficient designs.

PIEZOELECTRIC NANOGENERATORS: OPTIMIZING ZINC OXIDE NANOWIRE QUALITY THROUGH THE USE OF GOLD/COPPER ALLOY CATALYSTS
Morgan McKay Monroe
Episcopal High School of Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL

It is estimated that the world’s fossil fuel supply will be depleted in fifty years. Due to this, there is an urgent need to develop more efficient energy conserving and energy scavenging devices. Piezoelectric nanogenerators are an excellent way to scavenge ambient vibrational energy. These nanogenerators may be integrated into any small-scale electronic device; uses include biomedical device, environmental and structural sensors, and MEMS. Developing higher quality nanogenerators is essential for commercial use in the future. <br><br> The purpose of this investigation was to determine what ratio of gold/copper alloy used as a catalyst would produce the highest quality zinc oxide nanowires for use in piezoelectric nanogenerators. <br><br> It was hypothesized that using a 50%/50% gold/copper alloy catalyst would produce the best quality nanowires as opposed to using a 100% copper or 100% gold catalyst. Thermal evaporation was used to lay down a 10nm thick layer of catalyst on each .5cm^2 silicon substrate. A vapor-liquid-solid method of ZnO nanowire growth was preformed using a horizontal tube furnace. A gas mixture of 97.5% Ar and 2.5% O2 flowed through the tube in an enclosed environment. The temperature was raised to 750°C and maintained for 90min, then allowed to cool at a natural rate. The slide was removed after the furnace reached room temperature.<br><br> In conclusion, it was found that the 100% gold catalyst produced the best quality nanowires based on nanowire height, size, consistency of shape, and density. More analysis is still being done using an atomic force microscope in order to determine piezoelectric potentials for the differing nanowires.

This project compared the energy efficiencies of 89 octane gasoline, which has a mandated 10% ethanol blend (E10), to E20, E30, E50 and E85 ethanol blends found at blender pumps in Minnesota. The research was done using a single cylinder, four stroke, small gas engine.<br><br> Blender pumps offer consumers various choices of ethanol blends and studies have been done to show that E20 and E30 blends can increase an automobile’s mileage over regular gasoline. However, no research was found to compare these efficiencies in small engines. <br><br> My hypothesis was that I expected to find an E20 or E30 blend would be the most efficient fuel when transferring water using a small gas engine. This was based on the findings of the automobile tests.<br><br> To provide a steady load on the engine, water was pumped to a height of 10 feet and transferred back and forth between two large 1000 gallon water tanks. With each transfer, the amount of fuel consumed was recorded in milliliters using a burette tube. 18 tests were completed to reduce variables before testing began. A small gas engine class was also taken in high school during the fall trimester that proved beneficial when a problem occurred.<br><br> 22 tests were completed and recorded for the results and analysis. In total, more than 24,000 gallons of water were transferred. My conclusion was that an E30 blend was the most efficient from an energy standpoint when using a single cylinder, four stroke engine.

GOING CLEAN, FLYING GREEN: DECREASING OF NITROGEN OXIDE EMISSIONS FROM A JET ENGINE
Keegan Clive Moore
Rand Park High School, Randburg, Gauteng, SOUTH AFRICA

The purpose of this research is to determine the result of kerosene combustion and its emissions in order to decrease the amounts of nitrogen oxides released during combustion within a jet engine whilst maintaining adequate thrust levels.<br><br>The idea of changing the chemical compounds and densities within the emissions given off in order to positively affect the amounts of nitrogen oxides being released during this process was formulated. All testing of kerosene combustion was conducted with use of a test combustion chamber and analyzed with the use of a refractometer pertaining to the kerosene's effect on the degrees Brix in fruit.Experimentation with the mixing of different elements & chemicals - Hydrogen(H2), Ammonia(NH3), Nitrogen(N2) and Water(H2O) - in pure kerosene, was conducted. These elements were tested in different conditions such as surroundings. It was concluded that hydrogen was too explosive and nitrogen had no effect on the NOx. The water and Ammonia, which had great effect, were placed together in many different ratios, and tested. The kerosene and added elements where then tested on different fruit to analyze the environmental effects, which came out better than that of pure kerosene.<br><br>Ammonia and Water, placed into kerosene at an approximate ratio of 5.5% to the kerosene, had a positive (Decrease in NOX) effect on the amount of Nitrogen oxide emissions(approx. 7%-13% decrease from 87.10%)as well as kept the thrust levels adequate for flight under all conditions.

PHASE I OF II: DESIGNING AND FABRICATING A WIND TUNNEL FOR WIND TURBINE EFFICIENCY TESTING
Christina Marie Serena
John F. Kennedy High School, Babbitt, MN

The overall objective of this two phase project was to design a low speed wind tunnel specifically for the purpose of testing scale models of wind turbine designs for energy conversion efficiency in different wind conditions and terrain environments. The hypothesis is that if a low speed wind tunnel is designed specifically to test small wind turbine models for energy generation efficiency in different geographical areas, then more accurate, unbiased results will be obtained than currently available. This goal is being accomplished by using Computer-Aided Design (CAD) to design the low speed `wind tunnel, an effective strategy because it allows for the entire brainstorming and editing process to take place on the computer, eliminating additional prototype costs. This wind tunnel consists of different modules that make it portable and more versatile. The modularity of this tunnel will allow for easy modification and insertion of additional modules in phase two of this project. An additional aspect of this wind tunnel is that extra turbulence is avoided as this design prevents unwanted expansion and contraction of air in the settling module. The testing module is made up of a three-sided, removable one piece acrylic window for easy viewing and model access. So far, this project is a success because it is on its way to completion and will benefit future wind turbine product consumers by producing honest, credible information that they can trust when picking out a wind turbine for their specific location, budget, and home needs.

Problem: Can sugarcane bagasse be used to make coal?<br><br>Hypothesis: If my procedures are followed, sugarcane bagasse can be successfully transformed into coal.<br><br>Procedure: First, place bagasse in a grill with the lid open. Burn the bagasse until all of the moisture in it evaporates. Next, close the lid on the grill, and let the bagasse smolder for approximately half an hour. After about half an hour, remove the bagasse and place it in a tin pan. Now mix the bagasse with a cup of parrafin wax and about three to four teaspoons of molasses. Then, place the formula into a six inch pvc pipe. Compress the bagasse using a glue gun compresser. Once the bagasse is pressed to its full extent, extract it out of the pipe. The coal briquette is now formed and ready to be burned.<br><br>Results: According to my results, it was possible to create coal using sugarcane bagasse. The briquette, in fact, burned cleanly for a fairly long time.<br><br>Conclusion: I proved my hypothesis to be correct. I was able coal using sugarcane that burned cleanly and can be possibly used as an alternative resource.

LEVITATION BY MAGNETIZATION: A MORE EFFICIENT SOURCE OF WIND ENERGY?
Alexander Scott Madlom
Park Christian School, Moorhead, MN

My science project “Levitation by Magnetization - A More Efficient Source of Wind Energy?” tests whether we can use magnetic resistance and levitation to reduce the weight factor and friction in wind energy turbines to create a more effective and efficient form of wind energy. I chose this project as I wanted to see if we can improve an already efficient form of wind energy by reducing the weight and friction on ball bearings in wind turbines. My hypothesis is that the revolutions per minute of a wind energy turbine using magnetic levitation will be significantly greater than a wind turbine rotating on ball bearings.<br><br> I made two identical wind turbines, one using ball bearings and the other using magnetic levitation. I counted the revolutions per minute on each turbine at various wind speeds, and repeated each test five times. The revolutions were counted using a video camera in slow motion. The turbine using magnetic levitation started rotating at only 12.5 kilometers per hour (kph) and had at least seven times the rotations over the ball bearing model, which began its rotations at a wind speed of 36 kph. The magnetic levitation model had at least seven times the number of rotations per minute than the ball bearing model, which translates into a significant difference in energy output.<br><br> My hypothesis was correct. The turbine using magnetic levitation did provide an increase in the revolutions per minute over the wind turbine rotating on ball bearings.

BACK TO THE "GREENER" FUTURE
Nathanael Louis Mickelson
Alma High School, Alma, AR

Petrol fuels, the primary fuels utilized today, release environmentally harmful levels of greenhouse gases in their exhaust. Alternative fuels such as biodiesel, ethanol, methanol, and vegetable oil have been suggested for replacing petrol fuels. The project's goal is to test the validity of claims that bio-fuels are environmentally friendlier than petrol based fuels through testing their exhaust emissions.<br><br> Bio-fuels have been advocated as fuel sources for over 100 years. However, gasoline's cheaper prices led to its utilization as the main automotive fuel. Spiked gas prices caused by the fuel shortage of the 1980's and concern over environmental damage has led to the return of bio-fuels as viable fuel sources. Research showed biodiesel and methanol as the most promising alternative bio-fuels, despite campaigning for ethanol.<br><br> Using four two-stroke motors, a test was designed running the motors with a 100% petrol mix (gasoline/oil)and a 100% bio-fuel mix (methanol(alcohol)/biodiesel), with oil and biodiesel serving as lubricants. A test stack adapted to accept an exhaust gas analyzer was attached to the motors. Exhaust gas analysis was conducted under different operating conditions and fuel combinations. The results were recorded documenting the components of exhaust gases.<br><br> Test results showed that compared to the petrol mix, the bio-fuel mix reduced carbon emissions up to 30%. With carbon dioxide accounting for 95% of greenhouse gases produced by automobiles, this is a significant decrease. Despite the energy drawbacks, the bio-fuel mix retained cleaner exhausts and its validity as a substitute for petrol products is supported.

IMPROVING THE POWER OUTPUT OF PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS WITH COOLING SYSTEMS
Karl Maxwell Wallace
Jensen Beach High School, Jensen Beach, FL

The purpose of this experiment was to observe the effect of various cooling water systems on the power output of an overheated photovoltaic cell. It was believed the photovoltaic cell would have the greatest percent increase in power output per mL of water consumed when cooled by the mist cooling system, because the water in the mist cooling system will dissipate thermal energy as it evaporates.<br><br> The photovoltaic cell was connected into a circuit carrying a load. Mist, drip, and coil cooling systems were constructed. The cell was set at a 47 degree angle approximately 25 cm from the surface of a flood lamp set at 62 degrees below the horizontal. The power output and surface temperature of the cell were measured every 5 minutes for 2 hours for the baseline/control test. The point at which the power output leveled out was determined from these results. This became the starting point for the cooling water system tests. For the mist, drip, and coil systems, the cell’s power output and surface temperature were measured every minute for 30 minutes. The experiment was repeated for a total of three tests for each cooling water system. The ratio of percent increase in power to the amount of water consumed was calculated to evaluate the performance of each cooling system. <br><br> In this experiment, the percent increase in the power output of the photovoltaic cell was the greatest per mL of water consumed with the mist cooling water system; the data supported the hypothesis.

THE EFFECT OF A WIND TURBINE'S ROTOR DESIGN ON ITS VOLTAGE OUTPUT
Jacob Charles Pulawski
F.W. Springstead High School, Spring Hill, FL

The purpose of this experiment was to determine if a vertical-axis wind turbine's rotor design would affect its voltage output.<br><br> For this experiment, three different vertical-axis wind turbines were constructed: Savonius, Darrieus, and Giromill. Two wires were connected from a volt meter to the turbines. A hairdryer was placed, in a fixed position, thirty centimeters away from the turbines. When ready to start actual experimentation, the hairdryer was turned on. After 30 seconds, the AC voltage output was recorded. This was repeated for ten trials. Once done with the ten trials, the turbine rotor was switched with the two other turbines and the steps were repeated.<br><br> The average voltage output measured after the ten trials with the Savonius Turbine was 1.168 volts. The average voltage output with the Darrieus Turbine was 0.503 volts. The average voltage output with the Giromill Turbine was 0.402. The Savonius Turbine produced the highest voltage output. An observation made during experimentation was that at constant wind speed, there is little fluctuation in the voltage output.<br><br> The conclusion of this experiment was that the hypothesis was proven correct: The Savonius Turbine generated the greatest voltage output due to the blades surface area capturing the wind, causing drag, which propels the turbine.

Purpose<br><br>The purpose of my experiment will be to heat a small building with strictly compostable materials under the correct C/N ratio.<br><br>Procedure<br><br>The goal of my project was to create a compost pile that could effectively blow hot air into a room and thus heat that room. I planned on doing this by running pipes through the compost pile and then into a transmission cooler. Water would be pushed through those pipes by means of a circulation pump. The flow of the water would be then calculated by a flow gauge; which is necessary in calculating the BTU's produced by the compost pile (equation below).<br><br>qconv=m°Cp(T2-T1)<br><br>The compost would ten heat up the water circulating within the pipes. Air from the room is then blown threw the transmission cooler; that air is then heated by the hot water in the pipes (thus creating a radiator like effect).<br><br>Results<br><br>The first compost pile produced a total of 221,310.2 BTU's and heated the room up 9.2 degrees Celcius. While the second pile produced a total 503,280 BTU's and heated the room up 21.2 degrees Celsius. the composts cost per million BTU's is $9.90. Also it produced 3.31 KWH per pound and .559 pounds of CO2 per KWH (which is lower than several natural resources).<br><br>Conclusion<br><br>The results show us the true favorability of Decomposing Energy. Proving that decomposition is both a green solution as well as an economical one to our growing energy crisis.

IMPROVING CATHODE KINETICS AND THE RATE OF REACTION IN A DIRECT METHANOL FUEL CELL
Jeffrey Donald Martin
John Adams High School, South Bend, IN

Over the next century, humans will exhaust the Earth’s supply of fossil fuels, making necessary an alternative source of energy for a host of applications. The Direct Methanol Fuel Cell (DMFC), a member of the Polymer Electrolyte Membrane family of fuel cells, is a candidate to be this alternative.<br><br> This investigation was intended to mitigate the effects of anodic carbon monoxide poisoning, anodic carbon dioxide development, the problem of “mass transport,” and the shortage of oxygen at the cathodic catalyst.<br><br> Studies were conducted to investigate the effect of varied methanol fuel concentration, a fuel flow past the anodic catalyst layer, varied temperature, a gold catalyst added to the anode catalyst layer, and varied concentrations of hydrogen peroxide in the anode fuel supply.<br><br> A second study was conducted to examine methods by which total cathodic oxygen could be increased. Various methods were examined.<br><br> The studies showed conclusively that, in keeping with theory, the optimal concentration of methanol is 3M, although the cell is most efficient at .25M. Higher temperature produces higher current and potential values, and a fuel flow at the anode improves total output, and that output increases as the flow rate increases. The gold catalyst and hydrogen peroxide improve cell output individually, but are detrimental when used in conjunction with one another.<br><br> The second set of studies concluded that an increase in cathodic oxygen increases total power output.

IMPROVING WIND TURBINES WITH WINGLETS
Daniel J. Dorminy
Sola Fide Home School, McDonough, GA

For over 40 years, airplanes have used winglets to lower drag and increase efficiency, yet wind turbine blades of similar airfoil shape have not. This study determines the best form for wind turbine winglets to increase efficiency of wind turbines. Seven forms of winglets in 20 configurations and blades without winglets were tested to determine the best form to improve efficiency. Each configuration was repeatedly tested with turbine blades at seven angles of attack and three speeds. A 46 cm diameter wind turbine produced electrical current to determine relative efficiency of each winglet configuration. A novel curvilinear winglet form provided the standard for surface area for all winglets. Wind speed of 3.4 m/s represents areas with below minimum speeds, 5.9 m/s represents areas at the lowest range of utility sized turbines, and 7.1 m/s represents typical utility installations. At lowest speed, up to 82% more direct current was produced with the best winglet form. This winglet produced the best output at all three speeds at some orientation except one. The proportionally highest increases in production came at the lowest speed, indicating the potential for wind turbine use in low wind speed areas where wind turbine use is currently impractical.

ENHANCING ALGAE BIOFUELS: THE EFFECTS OF NITROGEN LIMITATION AND CARBON DIOXIDE INFUSION ON THE OIL YIELDS OF NANNOCHLOROPSIS OCULATA
Sara Ellen Volz
Cheyenne Mountain High School, Colorado Springs, CO

Despite gaining attention as a prospective oil source for biodiesel, due to its potential to meet modern energy needs without dependence on fossil fuels or arable land, algae’s oil yields still must be optimized for algae biofuels to become widely feasible.<br><br>Therefore, this study evaluates nitrogen limitation and carbon dioxide infusion as possible factors to increase biomass and cellular lipid content, and thus oil yields, of the microalgae Nannochloropsis oculata. <br><br>It was hypothesized that carbon dioxide infusion would increase both biomass and cellular lipid content, yielding the most oil, while nitrogen limitation would decrease biomass but increase cellular lipid content, resulting in next highest oil yields, with control cultures yielding least overall lipids. Gravimetric and fluorometric analyses were employed for lipid and biomass quantification.<br><br>N. oculata was cultivated in a homemade photo bioreactor under carbon-dioxide-infused, nitrogen-limited, and control conditions. For gravimetric biomass evaluation, cells were collected with centrifugation and filtering, and dried in an oven. For gravimetric lipid evaluation, lipids were solvent-extracted from dry weight with methanol/chloroform and hexane/isopropanol, and dried on a hot plate. For fluorometric lipid evaluation, samples were stained with Nile Red dye and analyzed through spectrofluorometry.<br><br>As hypothesized, nitrogen-limited cultures showed less biomass and more lipid content than control; however, carbon-dioxide-infused cultures died due to acidity in growth media. Thus, results indicate that carbon dioxide infusion cannot augment algae oil yields without precise pH regulation, but that nitrogen limitation does in fact hold this potential to increase the viability of algae biofuels.

OPTIMIZING ENERGY EXTRACTION AND WATER CONSERVATION OF GEOTHERMAL HEATING SYSTEMS: PART II
John Raleigh Burt
Sargent High School, Monte Vista, CO

The single-pass geothermal heating system of the Villa Mall in Alamosa, CO consumes an average 68,090 gallons of water per day throughout the winter months. Data from Optimizing Energy Extraction and Water Conservation of Geothermal Heating Systems strongly suggested that changing to a semi-recirculation system would decrease water consumption by at least half while still maintaining the average 120,168 Btu/h heat historically supplied to the building.<br><br>This project’s goal was to build a semi-recirculation heating system and then compare the energy extraction and water conservation to that of the original system. <br><br>Licensed plumbers constructed the semi-recirculation system in early March 2010 adding a pressure tank, pressure switch, circulation pump, 3-way mixing valve, mixing controller, flow meters, and temperature gauges to the existing geothermal heating system.<br><br>Based on the building’s varying heat demand, the mixing valve adjusts automatically to modulate the warm geothermal well water entering the main system loop mixing with the cooler water returning from the fan-coil heating units to maintain a target water temperature. Excess cool water is discharged out the building. <br><br>Multiple assessments of the new system prove that the consumption rate can be reduced by at least 50% while still adequately heating the building. The data reveals an average consumption rate of 23.8 gallons per minute (50% of maximum) will transfer 120,515 Btu/h into the building (347 Btu/h greater than the heat input from the old system). The highest water savings rate observed to date is 68.2%.<br><br>Additional water and electricity savings appear possible and deserve further investigation.

DO THE ENZYMES SPEZYME CP AND NOVOZYME 188 AFFECT THE PRODUCTION OF FREE SUGARS AND ETHANOL IN THE AMMONIUM-TREATED LEAF OF SACCHAURUM OFFICINARUM COMPARED TO THE AMMONIUM-TREATED LEAF OF SORGHUM BICOLOR USING LIGNOCELLULOSIC BIOMASS HYDROLYSIS?
Kai Addrianne Williams-Spraggins
Lighthouse Christian High School, Abbeville, LA

Ethanol as an alternative fuel is one route to reducing dependence on oil. In this experiment, non-food sources of leaves from Saccharum officinarum (sugar cane) and Sorghum bicolor (sorghum) will be recycled into ethanol. The purpose of this experiment is to compare the yield of ethanol and free sugars produced from the crops. The enzymes Spezyme CP and Novozyme 188 were used to expedite the release of sugars. If enzymes affect the production of free sugars and ethanol with a high yield and a low cost, then this will be advantageous to the bio-industry. A pre-treatment of ammonium was applied to the two crops, composition analysis was performed, and the enzymes were added in different concentrations. Chemical processes of saccharification, fermentation, and lignocellulosic biomass hydrolysis were performed. Samples of the biomass were taken at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours and analyzed for sugar and ethanol content. Composition analysis validated similar compositions with sugar cane leaves at 31% cellulose, 20% hemicellulose, and 18% lignin; and sorghum leaves at 33% cellulose, 23% hemicellulose, and 19% lignin. Glucose after enzyme hydrolysis for the ammonium treated leaves was 4.3% for sugar cane compared to 5.27% for sorghum. Untreated leaves yielded glucose of 0.23% for sugar cane, and 0.6% for sorghum. Ethanol after fermentation for ammonium treated leaves was 1.97% for sugar cane compared to 2.33% for sorghum. Untreated leaves yielded ethanol of 0.16% for sugar cane, and 0.31% for sorghum. Sorghum yields exceeded those of sugar cane and pre-treatment improved production.

CATCH MORE SUN: AFFORDABLE ENERGY
Pranjal Bodh Gupta
Auburn High School, Auburn, AL

Currently, solar panels have low efficiency, resulting in a high cost of<br><br>the produced electricity. One of reasons is that during non-peak hours<br><br>of the day (e.g., early-morning and late afternoon) solar panels do not<br><br>receive enough direct sunlight. The goal of this project is to increase<br><br>electricity produced from the solar panels in the non-peak hours. My<br><br>hypothesis is that if refractive lenses are attached perpendicular to<br><br>the solar panel and facing East/West, the overall energy produced will<br><br>increase. However, the lenses should be stationary to keep cost low, and<br><br>not overheat the panel during the peak sunlight hours. An apparatus was<br><br>constructed with four incandescent light bulbs, each representing the<br><br>Sun at different times of the day. Furthermore, a solar panel was placed<br><br>with removable Fresnel lenses that were cut from an original Fresnel<br><br>lens. The solar panel was 10.5 cm x 6 cm and the Fresnel lenses were<br><br>12.9 cm x 7.3 cm in size. With the entire apparatus covered to prevent<br><br>any outside light or reflection, data was collected. Simulating one<br><br>solar day of 12 hours on the equator during the vernal equinox, total<br><br>electricity produced was 12.6 micro-Watt-hour from the solar panel<br><br>without the lenses, and 17.6 micro-Watt-hour from the solar panel with<br><br>the lenses. Thus, the Fresnel lenses increased energy production by<br><br>about 40%, proving the hypothesis. Hence, the proposed design for solar<br><br>panels with sunlight bending lenses can significantly lower costs for<br><br>the produced electricity.

GEET FUEL PROCESSOR EMISSIONS AND EFFICIENCY
Rocky L. Schaeper
Sale Creek High School, Sale Creek, TN

The GEET (Global Environmental Energy Technology) fuel processor is a dynamic fuel-exhaust recycling device that processes fuel so that it can be used by the engine. This apparatus is fitted to an engine between the intake and the exhaust to replace the carburetor. The reason for investigating this processor is to identify a device which can utilize less than ideal fuels for an engine that was originally designed to use gasoline, resulting in a device that consumes more types of hydrocarbon fuels. The main goal of the GEET Fuel Processor is to decrease emissions and fuel consumption while using multiple types of hydrocarbon fuels. <br><br> A 3.75 hp, 4 cycle engine was used to test the results of a carbureted engine and the results of an attached GEET fuel processor unit. The carbureted engine results served as a baseline of data for comparison to the GEET fuel processor. Therefore the same engine was used for both systems.<br><br> Tests for emissions were taken at the emission testing center, recording results every five minutes of run time to show engine dynamics. Second, fuel consumption was tested measuring run times per volumes of fuel. <br><br> With time, the GEET out performed the carbureted engine in fuel economy and less CO2 emissions. Unfortunately the GEET produced more CO emissions, and exponentially more unburned hydrocarbon emissions. In order for larger hydrocarbons to be used by the engine, more heat must be absorbed by the fuel, a larger reactor must be implemented to ionize larger hydrocarbons, and a more efficient apparatus is needed. The exhaust plumbing from the reactor to the bubbler needs redesigning due to heat loss. With alterations, the GEET fuel processor concept could be used on generators, trains, and motor vehicles.

ADVANCES IN OSCILLATING WATER COLUMN DEVELOPMENT
Michael Reed Glawe
Cathedral High School, New Ulm, MN

An Oscillating Water Column (OWC) ocean energy device is considered one of the best techniques for harnessing energy and converting it for commercial electrical energy production. Its conventional technology utilizes the compression of air to drive a turbine.<br><br>Performance can be enhanced with the correct orientation of the OWC with respect to the shoreline. If wind velocity, voltage, and pressure are significantly higher in one orientation, then there is more potential kinetic energy in that positioning. Based on the idea that open ocean waves contain more kinetic energy than shoaling waves, it was hypothesized that an Off Shore device would produce higher readings than an On Shore or Near Shore device. <br><br>Using a custom built OWC, Near Shore, Off Shore, and On Shore positionings were tested in a wave tank. Wind velocities were recorded with an anemometer. Energy voltage readings were taken with a multi-meter. Pressure readings where recorded using a specially designed pipe.<br><br>The results showed that the Near Shore Oscillating Water Column had higher wind velocity, voltage, and pressure averages, which indicate that as the waves rise, more air is vertically displaced, pushing the turbine faster. The faster the turbine was turned, the more energy was being converted.<br><br>By applying this research, the structures can be mathematically fine tuned to high energy locations near the shore. Developers can place the OWC where wind velocity would be at its peak and the length of transfer cables to the shoreline can be reduced, thereby lowering installation costs.

NOVEL METHOD: DETECTING HIGH ENERGIES IN SONOLUMINESCENCE
Lyric Elizabeth Gillett
Cornerstone High Homeschool, Houston, TX

Sonoluminescence(SL):Process by which light is produced through acoustically-driven cavitation of a gas/vapor bubble, held in an ultrasonic standing wave pattern, in liquid.SL is currently being examined as a possible mechanism for an alternative clean energy source.PURPOSE:Develop innovative method for further investigation and detection of high energy regions in SL emission,not inhibited by absorption of these energies by liquid utilized in SL process, to aid extended study of SL temperatures and energy,as current methods for measuring SL temperatures are problematic and insufficient.HYPOTHESIS:Implementation of high energy detection mechanism(phosphor)in liquid in which SL process occurs would assist in facilitating detection and calculation of previously unmeasured high energies.EXPERIMENTAL SETUP implemented spectrometer, PMT, and lock-in amplifier.Initial experimental phase comprised measurement of optical emission of bubble.Manganese-doped zinc magnesium fluoride(ZnMgF2(Mn))was isolated based upon requisite parameters and introduced into system.Data calibrated and analyzed.Additional experimental design implemented to facilitate measurements.SL emission excited phosphor;observed emission peak indicated presence of high energies.Though actual energies were not measured, phosphor is indicative of highly energetic signals in SL emission. CONCLUSION:Data supported hypothesis.ZnMgF2(Mn)made it possible to detect otherwise absorbed,undetected energies.This research has significant positive potential for our world in terms of an economical,clean energy source,and military,medical,and transportation applications.FUTURE EXTENSIONS:Potentially include using CRT or other known energy sources to excite phosphor,to isolate what energy regions result in observed emission peak.

THE EFFECTS OF SPIN ON ROCKET FLIGHT
Aaron Blake Shepperd
Hart County High School, Munfordville, KY

For this project, the questions asked were: “If spin is induced on a rocket during flight, will it have positive, stabilizing effects?” and “If spin has positive effects in rocket flight, then which method will have the best results?”<br><br>I hypothesized that, one, “If spin is induced on a rocket during flight, that it will have positive, stabilizing effects,” and two, “If spin has positive effects in rocket flight, then physically angled fins will have the best stabilizing results.”<br><br>Three separate models were built, with three separate sets of fins. The first is a control, with fins at 0 degrees from the vertical (X) axis of the rocket. This second has fins angled at roughly 5 degrees from the vertical axis of the rocket, as one way to induce spin. The third has an airfoil introduced to one side of all the fins, as a second way to induce spin. All rockets were flown on the same sized motor, which was determined using a rocket simulation program, called RockSim. All rockets were flown three times, and visual data along with altitude were compared to determine whether spin effects rocket flight and, if so, what method was most effective. It was determined that, although angling the fins creates a more stable flight, it sacrifices a lot of altitude. The airfoiled fins both increased stability and maintained a reasonable altitude.

REDUCING WING INDUCED DRAG THROUGH THE ADDITION OF ADAPTIVE TIP SAILS - PART II
Joseph Anthony Gerner
George Marshall High School, Falls Church, VA

Tip sails, analogous to the primary tip feathers of terrestrial soaring birds, are purported to extract energy from the upwash flow field induced by the wingtip vortices, to produce independent lift and forward thrust components. Whereas the tip sails' lift components supplement the wing's lift, the tip sails' forward thrust components act to reduce the wing's induced drag caused by the production of lift. This experiment investigated the extent to which the addition of adaptive tip sails could reduce the induced drag and increase the lift-to-drag ratio of a low aspect ratio wing. The majority of prior testing in this field examined fixed geometry tip sails, optimized for a specific wing angle-of-attack. In contrast, the adaptive tip sails of this experiment were independently controlled by servos to optimize their performance across a range of flight conditions. To conduct this experiment, I engineered an open-circuit wind tunnel with a 2-Degree-of-Freedom test platform to independently measure lift and drag, coupled to a microcontroller-based data acquisition system. I used the framework of hypothesis testing to determine if there was a statistical difference in the lift and drag coefficients between the baseline wing and the tip sail configured wing. At 95% confidence, test results supported the alternate hypothesis across the range of angle-of-attack from maximum to near-zero lift, that the tip sails had the effect of increasing the wing’s lift-to-drag ratio. Inasmuch as the lift-to-drag ratio directly equates to improvements in aircraft range and endurance, adaptive tip sails offer the potential to reduce fuel consumption and maximize efficiency across a broad range of flight conditions.

WARNING ABOUT WARMING: A GLOBAL PROBLEM WITH A FUEL CELL SOLUTION - AN EVALUATIVE ANALYSIS ASSESSING A COMPETITIVE OPTION AMONGST THE PROTON EXCHANGE MEMBRANE, REVERSIBLE, DIRECT METHANOL, AND MICROBIAL FUEL CELLS AS A MECHANISM OF ELIMINATING IDLING EMISSIONS
Pavane Gorrepati
Rivermont Collegiate, Bettendorf, IA

Fuel cells are among the most sustainable energy sources in the world. Their properties offer tremendous potential for reducing greenhouse emissions and curtail dependence on depleting oil resources. In previous years, research was conducted with chemical fuel cells, such as the proton exchange membrane (PEMFC), reversible (RFC), direct methanol (DMFC). In order to explore the possibilities of biological fuel cells, a microbial fuel cell (MFC) was added to this year’s experimentation. Inevitable as it may seem, an emission-free world that harnesses the energy of fuel cells is still decades away.<br><br><br>This year’s research presents the first evidence behind the novel premise that fuel cells can be implemented to reduce idling emissions. It also qualitatively and quantitatively models vehicle idling situations to investigate the potential environmental barriers and technical limitations amongst chemical and biological fuel cells. This year’s baseline test was done on the MFC. Tests were also conducted with the four fuel cells to identify significant interactions among fuel cell performance in varying atmospheric pressure, temperature, catalyst poisoning, and cathode flooding to simulate idling situations. The data suggests that the DMFC would be the most practical fuel cell to implement, but from an environmental perspective the RFC or a modified PEMFC would be preferred. In total, each fuel cell appears capable for implementation to power idling situations, but each also retains certain qualities that complicate this effort. These findings may be the key to finally realizing the immediate potential of fuel cells as a means of reducing our carbon footprint.<br><br>

GENERATION OF ELECTRICITY FROM OCEAN WAVE OSCILLATION BY EMPLOYING QUINTUPLE INDEPENDENT MAGNET SHAFT ASSEMBLIES
Jessica Kelsey James
Weber High School, Pleasantview, UT

The world needs a source of energy that can be utilized continuously. The oceans are an ideal source of endless energy because the oceans are in constant motion. Currently, solar panels and wind turbines are the most efficient way to harness the energy of the elements; however, wind turbines and solar panels are intermittent energy producers, when it is calm and sunless these sources are useless. The purpose of this project was to create an apparatus that could harness the energy of the ocean with minimal impact on marine life. The apparatus is similar to a three tiered buoy, the lower tier contains 4 electromagnetic coils which are activated by ocean wave movement. The second tier contains three solar panels arranged in a triangle facing outward. The third tier houses a horizontal wind turbine which activates a fifth electromagnetic coil. The apparatus is capable of producing energy from three different sources the waves, the wind, and sun. This apparatus is unique because it is one of the first to combine these three energy sources together in one machine. The apparatus was tested in simulated wave action and the apparatus is able to survive violent wave action and can produce upward of 80.4 millivolts on a single wave from a single coil. The apparatus utilizes five magnet shafts (magnet shaft consists of copper coils in which magnets are moved through creating electricity). An enlarged version of this apparatus could potentially supply electricity to the power distribution grid.

AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY TO HARVEST HYDROCARBONS WITH COMBUSTION FLUE GASES FROM FOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTS
Bryan Matthew Lu
Southside High School, Greenville, SC

Fossil fuel energy is extremely important. Fossil fuel-burning power plants are the largest source of carbon dioxide pollution, in United States. They are estimated to produce 28.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide every year. Majority of the carbon dioxide is dumped into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas – it prevents heat radiation from escaping the Earth’s atmosphere, resulting in global warming. On the other hand, Carbon is a useful organic material. The purpose of this study is to harvest hydrocarbons from flue gases out of fossil fuel power plants by harvesting algae. An experiment was conducted by testing a closed system that uses the CO2 in power plant flue gases to feed algae. Four double open bottle-shaped bioreactors, one foot long and 6 inches in diameter, were constructed. The bioreactors use the energy from the sun. A combustion chamber was built to simulate the fossil fuel power plant flue gas. Flue gases are introduced at the bottom of the bioreactor and flow up while the media containing the algae flow in the same direction. In this case, the mixing of the algae media with concentrated CO2 in the reactors determines how fast the algae grow. A computer simulation was conducted to simulate the algae growth and to estimate the potential efficiency of harvesting algae.

SO EASY A STUDENT CAN DO IT: ENGINEERING AN AFFORDABLE ELECTRIC VEHICLE
Joel Jack Tinker
Covenant Christian Academy, Huntsville, AL

Due to environmental concerns caused by carbon emissions and to America’s high dependence on foreign oil, widespread use of zero-emissions vehicles is needed. All-electric vehicles are a leading zero-emissions technology, but such vehicles are currently not readily available. Electric vehicles are produced in small quantities and are therefore very expensive ($30,000-$60,000). The purpose of this project was to engineer an affordable electric vehicle by successfully converting a gasoline-powered vehicle to electric, and to perform experiments on the vehicle in order to determine the top speed and maximum range.<br><br> To accomplish the objectives, engineering analysis, design, fabrication, and testing was accomplished for the electric vehicle. First, an engineering trade study was performed in order to select a gasoline-powered vehicle to be converted to electric. The requirements for the selected vehicle were ease of conversion, low weight, large space for batteries, good condition of body, and low cost. The vehicle selected was a 1994 pickup truck. Next, the internal combustion engine and related systems were removed.<br><br> The conversion design was then performed, to select an electric motor that would meet the performance goals (range of 40 miles and top speed of 70 mph). The motor selected was the Advanced DC FB1-4001A, due to its sufficient range and top speed, ability to handle a 25 percent incline, and reasonable price. Finally, the electric motor and components were installed in the vehicle, and initial testing was accomplished. Three test runs were completed successfully, with a top speed of 55 mph.

A SIMULATION USING C++ TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY NON-NEUTRAL TORUS STELLARATOR BASED ON A PEDERSEN MODEL FOR OPTIMIZATION
Soo Kyoung Kim
Bronx High School of Science, Bronx, NY

The Columbia University Non-neutral Torus (CNT) stellarator studies plasmas with extreme electric fields relevant for fusion research which has the goal of clean energy. It was hypothesized that the confinement of plasma would be either enhanced or debilitated by redesigning the CNT to include two extra concentric Poloidal Field coils in addition to the two already existing in the Pedersen model of 2002. This would change the shape and volume of the magnetic surface. Two relevant physics parameters were varied, the current running through the coils and their radii. The two additional coils were tested for three different radii: 0.203 meters, 0.305 meters, and 0.406 meters. Combinations of three values of the radii and twenty values of the ampereturns were run through a C++ computer simulation, producing 5,000 data points of the cross-sections of magnetic surfaces per configuration. A Java program was written to precisely plot the coordinates, producing visual representations of two cross-section of the magnetic surface before and after the optimization. The graphs were analyzed for resulting magnetic islands, which is the determinant factor to understand whether addition of the two coils helped or harmed the ability to confine more plasma. The additional coils increased the volume of island free magnetic surfaces. Refurbishment created a larger confined volume possibly increasing confinement time and higher density plasmas. Possible applications include positron trapping and confinement of positron-electron plasmas. Results of this paper could be considered for design of a superconducting CNT to study positron electron plasmas.

AN INVESTIGATION OF PHOTOVOLTAIC ENHANCEMENT METHODS
Lindsey Johnson
Orion Junior High School, Harrisville, UT

Light is an abundant source of energy and can be limited and controlled in many ways. This experiment attempts to determine the impact of various photovoltaic enhancement methods on the power produced by a solar panel. By controlling the solar and electrical energy, mechanical energy, or output power can also be controlled. By applying lenses, reflectors, and colored filters to the panel, this experiment controls the amount of light and wavelength of light entering the solar panel that can be converted to electrical energy. Also, by controlling the temperature of the panel, the power output is also controlled due to the electrical properties of the semiconductor material that makes up the solar panel. This data was then applied to Ohm’s Law to calculate the power. Results showed that the mirror reflector, foil barrier, and cold temperature enhanced the output power of the photovoltaic panel by 14-91 micro-watts and 40-250 mV. They allowed more solar energy to reach the panel to be converted to electrical energy. All of the filters that were placed on top of the panel or beneath the light source reflected some of the light that would have been available to the panel or limited the wavelength of the solar energy, thus allowing less energy to be converted. In conclusion, output power can be controlled by maximizing the light exposure and minimizing the temperature of the panel. With enhanced photovoltaic cells, they become a more viable source of alternative energy.

INCREASED ENERGY TRANSFER FROM SMALL WIND TURBINES
James Lee Clark
Mayfield High School, Las Cruces, NM

The primary goal of this project is to build a load transfer controller for a wind turbine. This will be used to maximize the power transfer from a wind turbine generator to the load. With this type of controller, it is probable that 80-90% of the power generated by a turbine will be transferred to the load, in this theoretical case, a battery. Achieving a constant voltage output from the fluxuating input voltage from the generator is the main objective of the project. The controller will monitor the incoming wind speed, RPM of the turbine, generator voltage, generator current, and voltage and current of the battery bank while controlling the power transfer from the turbine to the load. In order to build this controller, the maximum power curve for the turbine must be calculated by measuring the values found through experimentation from the previous year's project.<br><br>A DC-DC converter will be the main focus of the project. It will primarily be used to step down the generator voltage and increase the output current in order to more efficiently charge a bank of batteries. A micro-controller will be used to command the converter's output current, thereby maximizing the power transfer. The converter's intelligence will also be used to monitor the transferred power and battery voltage. With this controller and its monitoring capability, a significant increase in successful power transfer from source to load will be achieved. The micro-controller will also be capable of load dump functions and emergency shutdown.

NUCLEAR POWER: THE NEXT GENERATION LOCOMOTIVE
William A. Wright
Belgrade High School, Belgrade, MT

This project is the first step in testing whether or not nuclear power is suitable to drive a railroad train. In this project using a computer design program (SolidWorks) I took the components of a Pressurized Water Reactor that is used in nuclear submarines and implemented them in models of actual train cars while finding the necessary size and weight of this proposed design. I then juxtaposed them with the size and weight of a standard diesel electric locomotive. I also compared this with the power-outputs of a standard naval Pressurized water reactor and a diesel electric locomotive. I found that, as expected the nuclear locomotive was enormously larger and heavier. It was 6.8 times as long and 4.9 times as heavy. This was countered, however, by the nuclear locomotives massive power output. One nuclear locomotive could do the job of 26 Diesel-electric locomotives. These findings prompt deeper experimentation and design of nuclear powered trains.

TWIN TURBINES
Nicholas Edward Mueller
Garretson School District 49-4, Garretson, SD

An important issue the world faces is the depletion of our natural resources. Using plans for a single vertical axis wind turbine as a guideline I engineered a double vertical axis turbine. I quadrupled the amount of coils used to collect the potential energy. My hypothesis was “The double Savonius turbine with sixteen coils will produce more energy than a single Savonius turbine with four coils.”<br><br> Modifying previous plans I built a larger double Savonius wind turbine with more coils. I made the turbine from lighter, more malleable materials. I used aluminum, brass, and high speed bearings to make the turbine more efficient. <br><br> The coils were made of magnet wire, 150 wraps per coil. I built the turbine out of vinegar jugs for added stability. I used rare earth magnets and aluminum to construct the rotor discs. Rubber corks were used to adjust turbine height.<br><br>Following construction, I performed tests and recorded results. I ran three trials with each of three fan speeds. Each time I time I changed the fan speed, I allowed the turbine to reach a consistent speed before taking measurements. Using a stopwatch, I watched the meter for 30 seconds recording the highest energy output level reached. In conclusion, my hypothesis was supported. On average, the double turbine with more coils increased the amount of energy 3.5 to 4 times more than the energy produced by the single turbine. I believe this is due to the increase of coils to gather the generated energy.

THE POWER OF THE WIND
Calan Kay Olsen
Manti High School, Manti, UT

It has been hypothesized that if you vary the angle, number, shape, and size of the blades of a windmill or the wind speed of the wind source, the power output generated by the windmill will increase or decrease compared to the control.<br><br> The purpose of my experiment was to show how different variations would affect power output. From the fan, I marked 2 foot increments up to 12 feet. An anemometer was used to measure the average wind speed at each distance and fan setting. I had 3 sizes of triangular and rectangular blades, and one size of S-shaped blades. With each set of blades, measurements were taken at each distance with 3 fan settings. I repeated this by varying the number of blades (3, 6, 9, 12) and the angles of the blades (every 10 degrees from 10-70).<br><br> My hypothesis was correct and I made some general and specific observations. Some of the general observations were:<br><br>• Shapes: “S” blades were the best .<br><br>• Sizes: The larger the blade the better the power output <br><br> when comparing the same shaped blade.<br><br>• Angles: “S” blades did the best at 10°. Rectangle blades <br><br> did the best at 20°. Triangular blades did the <br><br> best between 10°-30°. <br><br>• Number of blades: The power output increased when going <br><br> from 12 blades to 9 and 6 blades <br><br> and usually decreased when going to 3 <br><br> blades except at high speeds. <br><br>• Wind Speeds: The higher the wind speed the higher the power <br><br> output.

“GREEN” SYNTHESIS OF NANOWIRES ON FTO SUBSTRATES FOR ORGANIC DYE-BASED SOLAR CELLS: ANALYSIS WITH NEW RAPID D-SCOPE 2.0
Shyamal Buch
Vista del Lago High School, Folsom, CA

Dye-sensitized Solar Cells (DSCs) show much promise for inexpensive solar energy conversion. ZnO nanowires are actively being researched for use in DSCs. However, conventional methods of growing nanowires use high temperatures, toxic growth mediators, or costly equipment. Here, ZnO nanowires were synthesized on conductive FTO substrates by a sonochemical route at room ambient using environmentally benign materials. Typical DSCs employ expensive ruthenium-based dyes. In this work, the nanowire photoanodes were sensitized with a low-cost non-hazardous organic dye and successfully integrated into DSCs. A new tool (D-SCOPE 2.0) was designed and programmed to generate DSC characteristic curves at a speed close to that of expensive laboratory instruments. ZnO nanowire DSCs achieved a higher fill factor than previously published results. Photocurrent density showed a linearly increasing trend with growth cycles. A mathematical model for the nanowire DSCs was also derived and correlated with measured data. Solar cells based on such inexpensive, environmentally benign DSCs could become a viable renewable energy source in a wide range of applications.

The purpose of this experiment was to determine how hydrodynamic drag force effects various boat hull designs, and find the most effective boat hull for a specific purpose. Four designs of hulls were tested; two displacement (round and “V” bottom) and 2 planing, (flat and tunnel). Each hull was tested by simulating propulsion by using pumps or weights at three drag force speeds; idle, cruising and planing.<br><br>Propulsion and drag force for idle, slow speed (160 gph) and cruising speed (432 gph) was achieved by pumping water at each hull in a testing trough, while timing the distance traveled. For planing speed, a weighted pulley supplied propulsion at high speed or planing, while timing the distance traveled.<br><br>Displacement/length ratio (displacement/2240)/(0.01 x LWL) higher than an empty boat was needed to allow hulls to sit deeper in the water. By adding ballast the water line rose, hulls sat deeper, allowing designs to react to the drag force thrust upon them. <br><br>At idle, all hulls have equal drag. At cruising speed, displacement hulls having less drag and are more efficient. At planing speed, planing hulls have less drag, but take much more propulsion or energy (fuel) to achieve this.<br><br>Understanding hull reactions to hydrodynamic drag force will help consumers and world ecology in two ways, first, by reducing transportation and operating costs by reducing fuel consumption and second, by reducing the use of fossil fuels and minimizing the damaging effects of green house gases.

LEVOGLUCOHOL: ENGINEERING ETHANOLOGENIC E.COLI FOR LEVOGLUCOSAN UTILIZATION
Avanthi Sai Ajjarapu
Ames High School, Ames, IA

The utilization of waste biomass as a substrate for ethanol production proves to be promising. A method known as fast pyrolysis has been developed to convert biomass into bio-oil, a substrate rich in the anhydrosugar levoglucosan. Utilization of bio-oil, however, has been limited by the few known levoglucosan assimilating organisms. The levoglucosan kinase(lgk) gene, responsible for levoglucosan utilization in Lipomyces starkeyi YZ 215, has previously been isolated. Using the isolated lgk sequence, this study aims to enable E. coli KO11 to utilize levoglucosan as a carbon source for ethanol production. In order to engineer E. coli KO11, the lgk gene sequence was subjected to codon optimization, inserted into an expression vector, and transformed into competent cells. Resulting colonies underwent plasmid purification and the purified plasmid was transformed into E.coli KO11 using standard electroporation techniques. Using gel electrophoresis, the presence of the lgk gene insert was verified. Growth curve experiments were then conducted to verify levoglucosan utilization by the engineered strain. Preliminary growth curve results prove that prior to modification, E.coli KO11 cannot utilize levoglucosan as a sole carbon source. Moreover, the study has successfully enabled E.coli KO11 to utilize levoglucosan as a substrate for ethanol production via the expression of the lgk gene. Future studies aim to monitor ethanol production and levoglucosan utilization in order to verify the success of engineering the bacteria.

The purpose of my experiment is to create a more eco-friendly source of energy. By building the anode and cathode chambers and salt bridges and attaching them together I made six microbial fuel cell pairs. Collecting mud and topsoil, I filled three of the anodes with mud and three with topsoil. I made and placed an electrode in the center of the anode chambers; there was also an electrode in the cathode chambers aerating the solution in the cathode and creating more oxygen. Oncwe everything was built and attached together I was ready to being testing the voltage with a digital multimeter set on "voltage" mode.<br><br>The average of the three topsoil recording was .203 millivolts and for the three mud recording it was .35 millivolts. I recognized that when the saltwater in the cathodes began to turn blue and the murky water was getting clearer at the same rate. By the time the saltwater was competely blue and bright the murky water was no longer murky but clear like drinking water but then starting to get a shade of a dull blue. The water increasingly over the weeks began to get bnluer and bluer daily till it was a bold blue, not a bright blue as the saltwater was but a bold, duller blue.

THE EFFECT OF WINGLET SHAPE ON THE INDUCED DRAG OF AN AIRPLANE
Taylor Mason Hose
Hedgesville High School, Hedgesville, WV

Many people rely on air transportation. There are many ways to design airplanes to make them safe and affordable. These designs are based on the four forces of flight, which are lift, weight, thrust, and drag. Decreasing the drag of an airplane is one way to improve flight performance. Devices called winglets can help decrease the drag on an airplane. There are many different winglet shapes. This study proposes that if an elliptical winglet shape is added to a wing design, then the airplane will have less induced drag.<br><br> A wind tunnel was built to test all winglet shapes. Tests were completed with no winglet, an elliptical winglet, a sharp corner winglet, a winglet translated toward the trailing edge, and a custom design. A total of thirty drag measurements were recorded for each of the five shapes. The results were analyzed by averaging the thirty measurements and comparing results.<br><br> All winglet shapes, except the custom design, had lower drag measurements than the wing with no winglet. The elliptical shape had the lowest drag.<br><br> The hypothesis was shown to be correct. If drag is reduced then pilots can go faster using the same amount of fuel, or travel at normal speeds to produce fuel savings. Future research involves testing the elliptical design on different airfoils.

SOLVING THE MODERN ENERGY CRISIS: A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BIOFUELS AS A CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCE
Brady Mark Holst
Southeastern High School, Augusta, IL

The purpose of this project is to test through the scientific method the effectiveness of vegetable oils as an energy source by the emissions output, cost, fuel efficiency, and power of each fuel.<br><br> Sunflowers were planted and harvested. Seeds were pressed to produce oil, which was then filtered. Sunflower, soybean, and canola were each mixed one part gasoline with six parts oil. Sunflower, soybean, and canola oils, B10, B20, B100, and diesel fuels were collected. A calorimeter was used to find the BTU value of each fuel. Fuel efficiency was found by testing the amount of fuel needed to run a diesel engine at 1500 RPMs for one minute. Fifty trials were run for each fuel efficiency test. A Testo 350 XL was used to find emissions output of each fuel. Cost for each oil was calculated using production costs. The price of diesel and biodiesel was found from a local seller. Horsepower were found using a dynamometer.<br><br> After considering the results of all tests, B20 was found to be the best overall fuel. Sunflower oil was the least effective fuel. The vegetable oils did prove to have potential as good green fuels of the future, especially if used to generate heat or electricity. If used as fuels in engines, the oils should be made into biodiesel to increase efficiency and decrease environmental impact. It is clear after experimentation that vegetable oils are the fuel of the future and can be used to solve today’s energy crisis.

MAXIMIZING HYBRID ROCKET MOTOR EFFICIENCY FOR EVALUATING RECYCLED FUELS
Megan Lynn Perkins
duPont Manual High School, Louisville, KY

In 2006 a hybrid rocket motor was used to power the world’s first privately funded Space Plane (Space Ship One) to low earth orbit. The typical hybrid rocket motor combines liquid nitrous oxide as the oxidizer with a solid hydrocarbon-based fuel. Current configurations utilize a floating bulkhead to separate the high pressure liquid from the solid fuel. The solid fuel grain is the primary support for the bulkhead.<br><br>The purpose of this project is to evaluate current hybrid rocket configurations to provide recommendations for design changes that will enhance safety, reduce waste and provide for a more sustainable launch platform. <br><br>Rocket efficiency was evaluated by varying the ratio of oxidizer to fuel in two different model rockets. It was hypothesized that there is an optimum oxidizer to fuel ratio and that the floating bulkhead was a possible safety hazard. A load cell was used to accurately measure peak thrust, total thrust and burn time. Test results showed that the oxidizer/fuel ratio can be optimized to more efficiently use the solid fuel. <br><br>A major problem with the current configuration is that most of the fuel must be maintained in a solid state to provide support for the floating bulkhead. Therefore, under the current configurations it is not possible to fully maximize efficiency. The only viable solution is to eliminate the floating bulkhead in favor of a fixed one. By using a fixed bulkhead the ratio can be maximized to more fully burn the fuel grain, reduce waste and vastly increase safety.

Kouts Junior-Senior High School, Kouts, IN

The purpose of this experiment is to determine at which degree a winglet most effectively eliminates a wingtip vortex.<br><br>In my tests, I constructed a wind tunnel and tested different winglets placed on the end of a model wing. The winglets were placed at different angles in relation to the top surface of the wing: obtuse, square, and acute. Also, a wingtip with no winglet was tested as a control.<br><br>I visually interpreted the data and observed how a string placed on the tip of the wing spun in the vortex. This was recorded photographically as well. Another characteristic I searched for was to see if the string, overall, gained or lost lift.<br><br>After reviewing my data, I determined that I was able to create a wingtip vortex in the control test. I then tested the same wing with a winglet placed on the tip of the wing. My results showed that the obtuse angled winglet eliminated the vortex the most effectively and created the most lift. The square angled winglet eliminated the vortex immediately after the wing; however, in the later parts of the tunnel a small vortex did form. A small amount of lift was created. The acute angled winglet did not effectively prevent the vortex. It also eliminated a large amount of lift resulting in the string lying on the bottom of the tunnel. After all the testing was finished, I concluded that the obtuse angled winglet was the most effective of all the winglets I tested.

Kudzu: Can it produce a renewable resource that is useful?<br><br>The kudzu vine is an overwhelming plant in the southeastern United States. Originally introduced to help prevent soil erosion, kudzu has taken over the southeast and infests seven million acres of land. The purpose of this research is to determine if the kudzu vine when burned will produce a renewable resource. To determine if any renewable resource would be produce the kudzu was packed into a 2in x 2ft steel pipe and then sealed at both ends. Then the pipe was placed in a steel bowl and charcoal was placed around the pipe. In the side of the pipe was a hole with a brass fitting in it.Connected to the brass fitting was a copper tube which led to a flask. The flask was sealed with a rubber stopper with two holes. In the other hole another copper tube was placed and bent downward so that it led to a pneumatic trough. Then once the set up was completed the charcoal was ignited. While the charcoal was burning a vacuum blew air onto the charcoal to create more heat. Then the methane gas began to flow through the copper pipe and into the flask and then into the pnuematic trough. The flask between the pipe and the pnuematic trough collected the tar which was produced.

Recent high fuel prices have highlighted the need for alternate sources of energy. There are many types of alternative sources of energy but new concepts that are more efficient then current implications must be looked at. A new concept that is starting to be looked at is airborne turbines. There aren’t that many and most is in its prototype stages. The advantage to airborne turbines is that there is always wind at some altitude so energy is always produced.<br><br> This project is the study for the conceptual design of an airborne turbine. The conceptual design shows a new way of doing something that hasn’t been done before. In this phase no testing is done.<br><br> This project was a study on the different components, overall design, cost, and materials that would be needed for a particular design. The design is a tether LTA dirigible shaped similar to a zeppelin with a rotor at the back. This design’s main components are the envelope, structure, gas bladder, tether, stability and control, and the turbine. This study looked into the materials for the component and the cost for them. Also during the study an estimated sizing of 60m long 15m diameter and a rotor of 20m was made. With this early preliminary sizing it can be estimated that at 65% efficiency that the electrical output will be 500kW or .5 MW.<br><br> After finishing the research it was determined that this design would be feasible. The only con of this design is navigation hazard.

The purpose of this experimentation is to investigate the pragmatic use of Wave Energy Systems. The researcher has constructed a WES and tested it to evaluate its effectiveness and practical use to produce energy. The project is intended to advance the engineering of WES’s and common utilization of ocean waves as a renewable energy source. There is prospect that there will be great ecological and economic benefits in that dependence on fossil fuels can be reduced if success is reached in the goals of investigating Wave Energy Systems.<br><br>The researcher designed a WES to specific dimensions and constructed it. The design uses induction to produce electricity from the change in magnetic flux created when waves oscillate a magnet around coiled loops of wire. Once constructed, this WES was put into a freshwater pool, and a wave generator produced a specific wave for the WES to produce electricity.<br><br>With a wave power of 26.7 W and an electrical output of .60 W its efficiency was 2.2%.<br><br>This shows that there was a great lack of efficiency in this model by itself; however, it does lend itself to wave farms where many WES’s are arranged together to yield more energy when little absorption of energy is taken in by a single unit. In comparison to other WES’s, it has low efficiency, but this can be increased by increasing the number of coiled loops or the strength of the magnet, and therefore, relatively, this system has decent efficiency but needs more optimization.

A HOMEMADE MICROBIAL FUEL CELL
Brendan Eugene Betts
Easton Area High School, Easton, PA

Microbial fuel cells are devices that convert chemical energy to electrical energy, using bacteria known as “exoelectrogens” to create electricity by donating electrons. A homemade microbial fuel cell was constructed and tested to determine what factors provide maximum voltage output. The factors tested include pH levels, ionic saturation levels, substrate and air addition. The two chamber microbial fuel cell was assembled using PVC pipe and an agar salt bridge. Carbon brushes were used as electrodes. The source of anaerobic bacteria was the tank water of a pet red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans) . All materials were obtained in local hardware and grocery stores. The results showed that highly saturated buffers, neutral pH levels, high air content levels, and high energy catalysts helped produce maximum voltage output. These results supported the hypothesis. A marked increase in the voltage output over time was noted, but an experiment failed to demonstrate any evidence of natural selection of exoelectrogenic bacteria over a three week period. Microbial fuel cells are a clean, efficient form of energy which have great potential in the treatment of human, animal, and industrial wastewater. They are already being used in ocean monitoring devices and treatment of brewery wastewater. Research is being done on wastewater treatment via microbial fuel cells in a space station. This is a young, promising and renewable technology. The development of simple, inexpensive microbial fuel cell models will facilitate education, research, and discovery in this exciting new field.

PRODUCTION OF BIODIESEL FROM TERMINALIA CATAPPA L., NATURAL ALMOND OF PUERTO RICO: NEW MODEL SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
Angelinet Rodriguez-Sotomayor
Abelardo Diaz Alfaro, Toa Alta, PUERTO RICO

A new model for sustainable energy must be less dependent on fossil fuels. Terminalia catappa L., almond tree naturalized in Puerto Rico, produces crops year round. The hypothesis was that it is possible to obtain biodiesel from Terminalia catappa L. which is of a higher performance and quality compared to biodiesel obtained from Helianthus annus, Brassila hupu, Zea mays and reused oil. Almond oil was extracted while the other oils were bought. Biodiesel was obtained after treating one liter of almond oil, 250 mL of water, 250 mL of ethanol and 3.5g of sodium hydroxide. Biodiesel from all other oils was also prepared. <br><br>The comparison analysis of the chromatographs of the different biodiesels was as follows: at peak two almonds and corn biodiesel had octadecenoic acid ester (C19H36O2) and at peak three had octadecadenoic methyl ester (C19H34O2). At peak two, sunflower and canola biodiesel had Hexacenoic methyl ester (C19H34O2) and at peak three had octadecenoic acid methyl ester (C19H36O2). At peak two reused oil biodiesel had dicyclopentony 2 methane (C11H16O2) and at peak three had octadecanoic methyl ester (C19H34O2). Performance test of 850 mL of each of the different biodiesels was done using a diesel electric generator. Results evidenced that all of them worked for 28-30 minutes, but the emissions of almond biodiesel were really clean as compared to the other ones. It is concluded that almond biodiesel has a higher performance and quality than all of the other ones.

The Goal of our project is to produce energy from the air caused by the ocean waves.<br><br>Producing energy can be done by putting a modified fan on a top of a cylinder placed in a fixed position at the ocean and sea shores. As the waves rises and falls down, the water will be pushing air outside the cylinder and then suck it back inside the cylinder. During this process, The fan will be rotating into only one direction because we modified it's blades to do this. This will create energy and allows us to store it.<br><br>By doing so we will be producing double amount of energy since the fan is always rotating. <br><br>The aim of our project it to find a new sustainable source of energy that will reduce our dependency on the fuel and helps in reducing pollution.

BIO-INSPIRED PHOTONIC FUEL CELL
Dheevesh Arulmani
Gordon Graydon Memorial Secondary School, Mississauga, Ontario, CANADA

As the fossil fuel era comes to a screeching halt, a new energy regime is emerging that uses hydrogen as the ubiquitous fuel for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). Although hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics within PEMFCs are several thousand times faster than oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics, fuel cell performance is limited by the intrinsic activity of the ORR. This research investigates the use of photosensitized electrocatalysts to enhance ORR kinetics and oxygen chemisorption rates in PEMFCs. The idea of employing photosensitizers in PEMFCs originated from photodynamic therapy, where photoactivated singlet oxygen induces oxidative biomolecular reactions within surrounding cancerous cells. The high energy antibonding orbitals of the singlet oxygen produced by photoactivated chromophores are hypothesized to reduce the activation barrier in the ORR by weakening oxygen-oxygen bonds at the cathode. Photocatalytic entities were spray deposited onto the surface of Toray TGPH-090 carbon fiber paper to form gas diffusion electrodes. In situ characterization was performed to characterize PEMFC performance using polarization curves, potentiostatic measurements, impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Electrochemical results signify that photosensitizers enhanced electrochemical reaction kinetics of platinum and reduced ORR activation barrier by a maximum of 62.3%. The photocatalytic membrane electrode assembly fabricated using a 50at% platinum to 50at% ruthenium alloy yielded maximum catalytic activity of 2.09 amps (at potential of 0.5V) and maintained a 20.2% photocatalytic ORR enhancement. This photocatalytic alloy exhibits substantial PEMFC enhancements and may possess eventual economic feasibility with sunlight as the photoactivator.

COMPARISON OF ALTERNATIVE PROCESSES FOR PRODUCING BIOFUELS FROM SWEET POTATOES
Ryan Christopher Davis
Morristown Hamblen High School East, Morristown, TN

Discarded sweet potatoes (Ipomoea batatas) from groceries and wholesale suppliers represent an untapped source of carbohydrates for gasohol production. For this investigation, a series of tests was carried out to determine the most effective methods of: a) converting raw sweet potatoes to gelatinized starches, b) saccharification of gelatinized starches to fermentable saccharides (sugars), c) selecting commercial yeast strains to produce ethanol, d) distillation, and e) performance testing the bioethanol component in a gasohol mixture. Pressure cooking was determined to be the most effective treatment for gelatinizing raw sweet potatoes. The bacterial enzyme, amylase was effective in hydrolyzing all detectable starches into sugars in less than six hours (by Lugol’s Test). Three separate commercial yeast strains were tested in the sweet potato broth using Durham Tubes. Distiller’s yeast out performed Turbo and Fleishman’s bakery yeasts for rate and quantity of CO2 production. It appeared that the Distiller’s yeast was more suited to the pH and organic constituents present in the sweet potato broth. A 500 ml borosilicate glass distillation apparatus was used to separate the ethanol. The bioethanol distillate was mixed with 100% gasoline to produce an E10 gasohol. Acceleration and mileage trials using a go kart indicated that 100% gasoline and Commercial E10 fuel were slightly more efficient that the E10 sweet potato gasohol.

CONCENTRATED SOLAR POWER SYSTEM: UTILIZING FRESNEL LENS AND TEMPERATURE CONTROL
Caleb George Gestes
John Curtis Christian School, River Ridge, LA

The use of solar radiation through an active solar technique (photovoltaic panel) to harness energy continues to be explored in my science fair project. Last year, my science fair results explored the direct relationship between increasing light on a photovoltaic cell and the increase of voltage output. During this study, I discovered that the warmer the solar cell gets, the less the energy output. For this year’s project, I used a much larger solar panel and focused on manipulating conditions that would maintain a cooler environment for the actual solar panel. My reasoning was that a “cooler” solar panel would provide a higher energy output. I designed a cooling system which contacted the solar panel and used different liquids to cool the cell. For the manipulated variables, I used air as the control, and iced water and iced methanol. Each variable was tested 7 times and the voltage outputs (dependent variable) were averaged. The iced water produced a slightly higher voltage output than the ice methanol and the air. <br><br>After watching a Discovery Channel series on solar concentrators, I came up with an idea for Phase II of my experiment using a Fresnel lens; a Fresnel lens takes all the light striking it and focuses it to one single point. When I combined this with the solar cell, it produced more than the control cell (no additional lens). <br><br>The results from my experiments support one of my hypotheses: the active solar energy system using iced methanol didn’t have a higher voltage output than the active solar energy system using iced water; but a solar cell using a Fresnel lens fixed above the cell, produces a higher V output. So please read more about my project to learn not only about solar energy but also about how we can make it more efficient. In one hour more useable sunlight energy falls on the earth than the total energy that is used by the entire population in one year, but how can we take advantage of this and use it? Let’s find out…….

A NEW LOOK OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY
Christy Marie Farnsworth
Paonia High School, Paonia, CO

The purpose of this experiment was to show that with a variety of alternative energies working together electricity could be generated. <br><br> To conduct this experiment I built a geoexchanger out of aluminum tubing and TEGs (thermal electric generators). I placed six pipes in a five foot trench to run a geothermal system. Thermometers were placed in the geoexchanger to measure the temperature of incoming fluid. The fluid from the geothermal system, a 150 foot loop above the ground and another source of hot water were run through the geoexchanger. The temperature differentials in the different levels of the geoexchanger generated electricity. The values of amps and volts were recorded. I was able to achieve consistent readings over extended periods of time.<br><br> The readings recorded allowed the calculation of the electricity which my system could generate. I was able to run three 12 volt fans and generate 12.71 watts continuously. The beauty of this plan is that the heat from the different systems being used to generate electricity is actually a waste heat. The pumps to move the fluid through the geoexchanger are already in place for the geothermal and other systems to function. No additional energy output will be needed to operate my geoexchanger. Just place it in line on a current system of alternative energies.<br><br> The results indicate that a geothermal heat system installed in a building and working with other energy sources can generate electricity.

OPTIMIZATION OF A NOVEL HIGH EFFICIENCY PHOTO-THERMOVOLTAIC CONCENTRATOR SOLAR CELL: A SECOND YEAR STUDY
Rounok Joardar
Plano West Senior High, Plano, TX

Although tremendous scientific effort has been directed to improving conversion efficiencies of solar cells, for solar technology to be ultimately successful it is more important to drive down the cost per Watt of electricity generated. The efficiency of photovoltaic solar cells is limited by their inability to utilize the entire solar spectrum. The best PV solar cells waste about 60% of the total available solar energy as heat. A hybrid solar cell constructed by combining solid state thermoelectric generators (TEG) with conventional photovoltaic cells was previously demonstrated as a path to improving cell efficiency. The TEGs capture the heat wasted by the photovoltaic cell and convert it to additional electricity. However, the cost of such a cell was found to be prohibitive. This project optimizes the design of such hybrid photo-thermovoltaic solar cells so that the cost per Watt of electricity is at least 10% lower than using the PV cell alone under identical conditions.<br><br> A solar concentrator system with a Fresnel lens was used to study the behavior of different hybrid photo-thermovoltaic solar cell designs. Optimum cost effectiveness was achieved by separating out the heat inducing longer wavelengths of sunlight before the more useful shorter wavelengths reach the PV cell. This is the first practical investigation of beam splitting to improve solar cell cost performance. <br><br>Load tests were done on different hybrid arrangements to determine the maximum power generated by the PV cell and TEGs. With innovatively designed beam splitters over 10% reductions in cost per Watt were obtained.

This study utilized scientific techniques and engineering principles to systematically creating a prototype energy system. This project is intended to explore and develop an alternative energy system which effectively utilizes hydrogen, oxygen, and coal gas as a fuel source. Several techniques were developed in order to design and create a pilot system which operated autonomously and used coal gas to create a synthetic hydrocarbon. The reason for this experiment is to create a synthetic hydrocarbon due to the over usage of fossil fuels. <br><br> The engineering goals were implemented to establish this system. Connecting the Hydrogen Oxygen Fuel Cell System into the Hydrocarbon system to increase the amount hydrogen in order to create cleaner coal. Creating a synthetic hydrocarbon by using Anthracite coal as fuel source. Create “Clean Coal” by using Hydrogen in a hydrodesulphurization process. Confirm untreated trace amounts of coal by- products (Methane, Ethene, Hydrogen and Carbon Monoxide). Review and test treated coal gas with saturated hydrogen and oxygen gas in cobalt molybdenum environment for new Hydrocarbon derivative (Ethene). Testing of untreated and treated aqueous liquor in gas with saturated hydrogen and oxygen gas in cobalt molybdenum environment to identify if Hydrocarbon derivatives were synthesised. <br><br> All of the engineering goals were achieved successfully. Creating a synthetic hydrocarbon was completed and the theory behind making a clean coal was also proven correct. The one exception was engineering goals was that the aqueous liquor was not treated and/or tested due to the time restraint, which could have generated more hydrocarbon derivatives.

ALARMED AND HEATED FUEL TANKS SUITABLE FOR RETRO-FITTING AND AVAILABLE FOR ALL COMMERCIAL VEHICLES

In the UK, the price of diesel is soaring well above £1($1.50)a litre. This affects all lorry drivers and companies as they can lose in excess of £900($1,350)each night due to fuel theft. <br><br>The average lorry fuel tank holds between 300-400 litres of fuel and, as large lorries often use two tanks this could total 600-800 litres. If this were to be stolen the company would lose around £900($1,350) based on current diesel prices. There is also the additional cost of replacing the damaged fuel tank.<br><br>Following extensive research with both hauliers and independent truckers, an effective solution has been developed that will deter thieves from drilling into the tank and removing the diesel. By using an alarmed ‘twin-skin’ design, the risk of theft is significantly reduced. <br><br>Replacement tanks can also be specified with a heating device. Standard diesel will not run efficiently under -10C, but pre-warmed diesel alongside an inline fuel pre-heater will cope with most severe weather conditions.

USE OF AN ELECTRIC SHOCK RECEIVED FROM A LIGHTNING BY A BUILDING’S LIGHTNING ROD
Alejandra Aristizabal_Buitrago
Gimnasio Los Pinares, Medellin, Antioquia, COLOMBIA

This project seeks ways to take advantage of the electric shock from a lightning for water heating in an industrial process. By using the energy of the lightning, we would be decreasing or omitting the use of conventional energy for a defined period of time, whether it is gas or coal. It is known that lightning occurs randomly, therefore the manufacturing process would not depend 100% of the energy provided by the electric shock, but it would be very helpful, as we won’t need that much conventional energy, which probably would not be renewable and pollute the environment in a much higher percentage. Furthermore, using the energy of the lightning is cheaper as lightning are free, although the setting of this project may be a little expensive. <br><br> To be able to attract the largest possible amount of lightning and use their energy in the most efficient possible way, ionized lightning rods will be used; they attract lightning and provide fair protection. <br><br> The installation of this project would be implemented in a factory where hot water is required for industrial processes, which will be located in a strategic place where there is more possibility of electric shock because of its high keraunic level, for example municipalities like Caldas and La Estrella in Antioquia. In conclusion, this is a project that, if successfully implemented in an industry, can maximize profits by reducing energy costs in the process in which it would be used, obtaining large economic and environmental benefits. <br><br>However, precautionary measures should be taken because it may be very dangerous and people responsible for carrying out the process must be trained to do so.

ETHANOL PRODUCTION: DETERMINING THE OPTIMAL CONDITIONS FOR THE SACCHARIFICATION OF SUGAR BEET PULP
Anna Maria Joykutty
American Heritage School, Plantation, FL

Currently 97% of the ethanol produced in the United States is from corn. Because the use of corn as a fuel raises food prices, spent sugar beet pulp is a viable and cost-effective alternate. Specific commercial enzymes (pectinase, hemicellulase, cellulase) are necessary to efficiently degrade the pulp into its basic sugar components (xylose, galactose, glucose, etc.). These basic components can be converted into ethanol using E. coli K101. This strain of E. coli is able to convert close to 100 percent of 5-C and 6-C sugars into usable energy, or ethanol. To determine the optimum conditions for maximum sugar yield, a number of experiments were conducted, first, varying the pretreatment of pulp (boiling vs. hydrothermolysis), then, the method of enzyme addition, and the order of enzyme addition, and finally, the combination of enzymes exposed to the pulp. Samples were incubated and were tested using the reducing sugars method. Once data was collected and analyzed, samples that yielded the highest total sugar production were then subjected to HPLC to determine the identity of the sugars released. It was determined that hydrothermolysis was more effective than boiling as pretreatment and that the addition of pectinase followed by hemicellulase six hours later is both cost-effective and releases the maximum sugar yield.

A CURRENT EVENT: AN ONGOING STUDY OF THE PRODUCTION OF CLEAN TIDAL ENERGY
Katherine Marie Stone, Kyle Saleeby, 
Fort Walton Beach High School, Fort Walton Beach, FL

The purpose of the project is to write a computer program that calculates a waterwheel’s electrical output using tidal current and to build a waterwheel to test the calculations. We created a computer program that could predict the power output of a waterwheel of a particular size and calculate the dimensions required for a waterwheel to produce a given amount of power. Through characterization of an alternator, we showed how load affected the power output of said alternator. We built a waterwheel, modified a car alternator and built a 37:1 ratio gearbox, which we then took on a pontoon boat to test the calculations produced by the computer program. We proved through this setup that high enough RPM’s could be reached at actual tidal speeds to produce significant amounts of electricity. Through all of this testing we found that the calculations produced by the computer program were comparably accurate. With our waterwheel, we can produce 6,000 watts. Compared by size and practicality, tidal power can outperform other forms of clean sustainable energy like wind turbines and solar panels. For the amount of power produced compared to the size of the device, this by far is the most compact. Our water wheel can also operate in any marine setting that has tidal flow and will not harm marine animals. Many other inlets have higher speeds of tidal flow, which will greatly increase the power output of the waterwheel.

THE FUTURE OF ENERGY: ORGANIC SOLAR CELLS
Aamna Dhillon, Jyoti Lodha, Ruchi Jahagirdar
Seminole High School, Sanford, FL

Driving optimal price to efficiency ratios in solar cells is critical to mass deployment of the technology to drive a more environmentally friendly future. The potential of using cheaper alternatives to expensive silicon-based solar cells to create more affordable solar cells formed the basis of this experiment. The cells are comprised of several layers, one consisting of P3HT:PCBM solution, a donor-acceptor material. Using different ratios of P3HT to PCBM can affect the efficiency of the cell. Equipment and labs at the UCF NanoScience Technology Center and CREOL were utilized. As even a speck of dust can short circuit a device while still in development, the majority of the solar cell was constructed in a clean room. It was hypothesized that the ratio with more P3HT would perform with more efficiency as with more donor material than acceptor we can have maximum capacity of excited electrons to produce greater voltage.<br><br> The fabrication of organic solar cells utilizes a technique termed spin-coating, which entails spinning flexible substrates at four-thousand rotations per minute, on which liquids are deposited to create an active layer that reacts to photons to power electrically powered devices. Metals are deposited using vapor deposition that act as the anode. IV curves are generated to measure efficiency of the created device, which is measured using a solar simulator. After fabricating the devices, they were tested using the solar simulator. The results supported our hypothesis, as the cell with the higher ratio of P3HT to PCBM performed better than the others.

ALTERNATE SOURCE OF ENERGY FOR A LOWER CONSUMPTION OF PETROLEUM FUEL IN VEHICLES
Omar Raouf Farwagi, Ramzi Shweihat, 
Modern Montessori School, Amman, Khalda, JORDAN

Our project is about finding a new way for decreasing petroleum consumption in vehicles. Our aim is to minimize fuel consumption by changing the kinetic energy gained from the shock absorbers(which are placed between the tires and the body of the car) into electric energy by surrounding the shock absorbers with copper wires and placing magnets around them. Every time the shock absorbers move in a vertical direction to prevent damages to the car, electrical energy is gained. This energy is turned from alternate current into direct current and then is sent to the battery to be stored (thus eliminating the need of the dynamo which consumes fuel). Moreover, the electrical energy will be used to do electrolysis for water, releasing hydrogen gas that will be fed into a hydrogen engine to be burned, therefore decreasing overall fuel consumption in the main petroleum engine. To sum up ,the irregular shape of the ground where vehicles move, caused the motion in the shock absorber and this kinetic energy was converted into electrical energy. The result was the decrease of consumption of petroleum fuel.

H2O DERIVED HYDROGEN FUEL OPERATING AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE

Fayette County High School, Fayetteville, GA

Rising gas prices and a growing concern of pollution have driven the advancement of economic and environmentally friendly cars. This engineering project focuses on utilizing water as a fuel for conventional internal combustion engines. The goal of this project was to alter an internal combustion engine to run efficiently on a water based hydrogen fuel by designing and constructing an electrolysis device to replace the existing fuel tank. In order to build an electrolysis device, a set of electrodes was created using stainless steel and satin nickel plates and by connecting copper wire to the plates. Afterward, the electrodes were placed in a water filtration container with a solution of water and sodium bicarbonate. Alligator clips were attached onto the ends of the copper wires and placed on a car battery to begin the reaction. Then the device was attached to the carburetor of a lawn mower engine (with the gas tank removed). The electrolysis device was tested for operating time as a fuel source. The goal was met as the engine successfully ran for 83.43 seconds; however, sustaining the engine was not possible through our design. Running the engine off of hydrogen proved to be efficient; it operated for a relatively long amount of time for the low quantity of hydrogen produced. Moreover, the device operates as a conventional hydrogen fuel cell by maintaining substantial electrical power. This shows the potential that hydrogen has as a fuel source when harnessed correctly.

CYLINDRICAL ORGANIC SOLAR CELLS WITH CARBON NANOTUBE CHARGE COLLECTORS
Dante Zakhidov, Navaneeth Ravindranath, Raymond Lou
Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science, Denton, TX

The underlying purpose is to optimize solar cell efficiency. Traditional organic photovoltaic solar cells (OPV) are produced on flat substrates. When applied on a large scale the maximum area covered by a flat OPV is limited to a two dimensional plane. Moreover, the light absorption is never strong enough due to very small OPV thickness (~200 nm). Cylindrical OPVs have a vertical structure that allows more sunlight to be absorbed in a smaller area due to photons being trapped and reflected multiple times by the cylindrical walls. The schematics of the organic cylindrical solar cell device are similar to that of traditional organic cells, but the cylindrical OPV uses transparent multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) instead of ITO as the hole collecting layer. The highly conductive nature of MWCNTs and 3-dimensional charge collection allows for increased efficiency over flat ITO while the device still remains transparent.<br><br> The best cylindrical OPV yielded an efficiency of 1.30%. Further research showed that cell efficiency could be improved by about 30% with the addition of a concentrator, increasing the efficiency to 1.71%. Still more research needs to be conducted in order to optimize parameters such as thickness of the active and buffer layers and optimal annealing temperatures, which would yield much higher efficiencies. Furthermore, water can be run through the cylindrical cell to prevent overheating from concentrated sunlight exposure. The heated water can be used to heat other appliances. Nanotechnology is a promising venue to push solar cell technology to new limits previously thought unattainable.

HAVING OUR CAKE AND EATING IT TOO: NOVEL COMPOSITE MEMBRANES WITH LOW METHANOL PERMEABILITY AND GOOD PROTON CONDUCTIVITY FOR DIRECT METHANOL FUEL CELLS
Liang-Bo Shen, Kan-Ran Tan, 
Beijing No.4 High School, China, Beijing, CHINA

In the field of direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC), proton exchange membrane (PEM) is one of the critical components. The PEMs used widely to date are the membranes made of perfluorinated sulfonic acid polymers, such as the Nafion® series from DuPont. However, Nafion® and its composite membranes are limited by their unsatisfied methanol permeability or proton conductivity.<br><br>To suppress methanol permeability and obtain good proton conductivity, novel Nafion®/Na_2_Ti_3_O_7_ nanotubes composite membranes were prepared, taking advantage of the hydrophilic nature of Na_2_Ti_3_O_7_ nanotubes and the apparent structural changes of these nanotubes upon acid treatment. The characteristic properties of the composite membranes were investigated using Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The swelling degree, methanol permeability and proton conductivity of the composite membranes were measured to evaluate the applicability of these membranes in fuel cells. It was found that the typical proton conductivity of the Nafion®/Na_2_Ti_3_O_7_ nanotubes (5wt.%) composite membrane was 0.098 S/cm at 80ºC, about the same as that of recast Nafion® membrane. The methanol permeability was 1.74×10^-7^ cm^2^/s, almost ten times lower than that of recast Nafion® membrane at room temperature. The performance of a membrane-electrode assembly using the optimized composite membrane was evaluated by single cell test. The highest current density using the composite membrane was 195 mA/cm^2^ at 0.4 V (80ºC), which was about one time higher than that of Nafion® 112. These results indicated that the composite membranes have promising practical value in DMFCs.

CONVERTING AMMONIUM HYDROXIDE INTO HYDROGEN FOR ENERGY USAGE BY ELECTROLYSIS AND PHOTOELECTROCHEMICAL REDUCTION
Manpreet Kaur Chopra, Asif Rahman, 
duPont Manual High School, Louisville, KY

There is an increasing demand for energy in this decade. There are different energy generation and storage techniques available. Among these techniques, the use of liquid ammonia (NH4OH: a waste generated from industries and residual fertilizers) as an energy source has gained attraction. Storage of NH4OH is safer and cheaper compared to that of other fuels like hydrogen. The stored NH4OH can be disassociated using a catalyst to generate hydrogen; a direct fuel source for several applications including automobiles. The present idea is to be able to replace the catalyst platinum (rare and expensive) by the use of an appropriate semiconductor in the presence of sunlight. The first objective is to find a suitable semiconductor for the electrolysis of NH4OH to hydrogen. The second objective is to study the photo electrochemical disassociation of NH4OH. <br><br>A three-electrode glass cell is used to perform the electrochemical tests. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) is the basic medium used to drive the reaction. The semiconductor materials used are tin oxide (SnO2) and titanium oxide (TiO2). Different concentrations of NH4OH and KOH are used to study their effects on the reaction along with sunlight. <br><br>Finally, the set of trials that involved photoelectrochemical reduction, showed that the 3 M KOH and 0.01 M NH4OH solutions with the SnO2 electrode and a light source are most efficient and would be the ideal measurements for producing hydrogen in this manner. The addition of a light source raised the absolute value of the peak and increased the dissociation of NH4OH.

FROM WASTEWATER TO ELECTRICITY: A STUDY OF MEDIATOR STYLE MICROBIAL FUEL CELLS
Matthew Joseph Detmer, Daniel Jensen, 
Piedra Vista High School, Farmington, NM

This experiment is designed to determine the relationship between both the amount and type of organic matter used as fuel in mediator microbial fuel cells and the energy produced by those fuel cells. The experiment is also designed to determine if varying the quantities of bacterial agent used in a fuel cell increases or decreases the electrical output in relation to changes in the agent. <br><br> The hypothesis is that a direct relationship exists between these controllable factors of the fuel cells and the electrical output they generate.<br><br> For the experiment twelve fuel cells were constructed and 28 different mixtures of organic fuel matter and bacterial agents were combined and tested for their output. Although the majority of the evidence supported the hypothesis, enough anomalies arose to deny confirmation of that hypothesis. One organic fuel was definitely more productive than another, but increasing the quantity of fuel in a cell was effective only to a point.<br><br> Likewise, increasing the amount of bacterial agent in a fuel cell increased the electricity produced, but again only to a certain level at which the fuel cell ceased to function much sooner than others tested.<br><br> A relationship exists between the electrical output of a cell and the type and amount of organic fuel and/or the amount of bacterial agent used in a fuel cell. But it appears there is a limit to the efficiency of adding more and more of these variables to a cell. Therefore the hypothesis was not proved.

Although much attention has been paid to dwindling energy resources, scant consideration has been given to the indirect cost of sound pollution. Our project attempts to alleviate both problems by developing devices that can collect and store the energy of noises. A sub-woofer was used as a noise absorber and mechanical vibration of its membrane was converted into electricity.<br><br> <br><br>In initial tests, gravitational potential energy was used to simulate hard-to-measure sound energy. Results indicated that increases in vibration amplitude or duration generated more electrical energy output and higher collection efficiency.<br><br> <br><br>In later experiments, although the collecting circuit filtered out some noise frequencies, 15% of the sound energy was collected when environmental frequency matched the resonant frequency of the model (160Hz) and the sound intensity level reached 116dB at 6.28cm away from the device. While source frequency was constant, energy collection grew exponentially as the sound intensity rose until the limit of the speaker membrane vibration was attained.<br><br> <br><br>From other observations, platform vibration and electromagnetic interference from AC adapters were found to be valid sources of energy as well.<br><br> <br><br>Our project demonstrates the validity and value of converting sound energy into electricity. Further research will be focused on improving energy collector efficiency and energy absorber tunability for more flexible applications in locations of sound pollution.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF SOLID ACID, BASE, AND ENZYME CATALYSTS ON TRANSESTERIFICATION AND THE PURITY OF THE FUEL FORMED
James Charles Krach, Jonathan Tam, 
Manhasset High School, Manhasset, NY

Biodiesel is an intensely studied alternative energy and can be yielded from photosynthetic organisms in the transesterification reaction. In transesterification, triglycerides and alcohol react to form glycerol and methyl esters, where methyl esters are the biodiesel. Commonly, the catalyst used in the reaction is a basic catalysts such as sodium hydroxide. An acidic or enzymatic catalyst has been suggested because both of these catalysts do not require the oil to be purified, whereas with the basic catalyst, the oil needs to be purified. The problem with the acidic catalyst is that it reaches completion 4000 times slower than its basic counterpart (Royon, 2006). The purpose of this research was to determine the efficiency of each reaction with a specific catalyst. For this experiment, sodium hydroxide was used as the basic catalyst, 12-tungstophosphoric acid on hydrous zirconia was used as the acid catalyst and Novozyme 435 was used as the enzymatic catalyst. This was quantified by measuring the efficiency and amount of the oil that was produced by each catalyst. It was found that when the acidic catalyst was used, 26.33,L of biodiesel was produced at a pH of 5.7 and a .0543 molar impurity. When the basic catalyst was used, 26.66mL of biodiesel was produced at a pH of 10.37 and a .0663 molar impurity. When the enzymatic catalyst was used, 30.66mL of biodiesel was produced at a pH of 6.5 and a .0257 molar impurity.

HYDROGEN HORSEPOWER
Jadyn Kirk Miller, Derek Dumdie, 
Selby Area High School, Selby, SD

The reason we did this project is because we wanted to find out if a hydrogen generator, which is originally used to increase gas mileage, can also be used to help increase horsepower. In addition, this could benefit other people because if it works, other people could also use this to increase horsepower for themselves.<br><br>To do our project, we had to follow a certain procedure. First, we had to find a way to test horsepower. We learned that we could do so by running a 1/4 mile drag race and enter the time, trap speed, and vehicle weight into a special calculator. We then went out and found a vehicle and a location for testing, contacted police authorities to assist us, measured off 1/4 mile, and then ran the drag race 10 times; recording the time and trap speed. After, we compared the results.<br><br>We found that with the hydrogen generator, we got an average time of 25.2 seconds, and average trap speed of 69.7 mph, and an average horsepower of 52.99. Without it we got an average time of 28.1 seconds, and average trap speed of 66.2 mph, and an average horsepower of 43.11. This made a decrease in time by 2.9 seconds, an increase in trap speed by 2.35 seconds, and an increase in horsepower by 9.88.<br><br>This concluded that it is possible to increase horsepower using a hydrogen generator.

"HAIRODYNAMICS": THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT WIND VELOCITIES AND DIFFERENT HAIR LENGTHS ON THE DRAG FORCE OF A MODEL TRACK SPRINTER’S HEAD
Frank Walter Woo, Tammy Hsia, 
Macomb Mathematics Science Technology Center, Warren, MI

In the recent Summer Olympics, it was noticed that the athletes had various hair styles: dreadlocks, long hair, short hair, and no hair. Can something as minute as hair length affect the milliseconds that determine records? The initial purpose of this research was to investigate the influence of wind velocity and hair length on a sprinter head’s drag force to determine which variable had the greater influence. A wind tunnel from a local university was used to create an isolated system—that controlled air pressure and recorded drag force—and reduce lurking variables. A Styrofoam head modeled the human head and was mounted on the sting balance within the wind tunnel to support the head and record the drag force applied on the head. In this research, a short-haired sprinter, long-haired sprinter, and bald sprinter were simulated, respectively, with sewing needles—inserted into the Styrofoam head—to simulate a hairline from ear to ear, a long-haired wig attached to the Styrofoam head, and the Styrofoam head without any additions. Depending on the trial, the pressure within the wind tunnel and the type of hair on the mannequin varied. The hypothesis that wind velocity would have the greater effect on aerodynamic drag and hair length would have the least effect was accepted, despite both proving to be statistically significant through the Design of Experiment (DOE) statistical test. Initially, it was thought that as the hair length on the head increased, the drag force applied on the head would also increase; this was not found true according to the researchers’ data and analysis. Ultimately, the ideal hair length to produce the least amount of drag upon the mannequin head were the short-haired trials, with approximately 20 percent less drag than the bald trials.

WATER AS AN ALTERNATIVE FUEL
Aaron Wayne Murphy, Joshua Rupley, 
Rio Grande Enrichment Studies, Albuquerque, NM

The purpose of this study was to construct an internal combustion engine (ICE) powered by H2 produced from high-temperature hydrolysis (HTH) as a viable alternative for a gasoline ICE. We rebuilt an ICE and constructed several electrolyzer designs from various metals, running tests with H2O(g) using ethanol as a catalyst. We discovered in our tests that the ethanol was being consumed instead of the H2O(g). We then ran tests to determine fuel consumption of the ICE, followed by tests with an added H2 supplement. The results showed that the H2 supplement increased the ICE fuel economy by up to 70% and horsepower by a large amount. We then tested NH4OH and determined that it is not a preferable catalyst for HTH because it reacts with the Cu electrodes being used. Having tested numerous other chemicals, it must be concluded that until further research is done, NH4OH is the only viable catalyst for HTH that has been tested in this study so far. By using a sacrificial metal such as calcium or iron, the life of the electrodes may be lengthened. In ideal conditions, once the system is running, a motor powered with H2 produced by HTH has a 15% efficiency, as opposed to the 0% efficiency of a motor powered by electrolysis of H2O(l) in the same conditions. This system is a self-sustaining source of electrical or mechanical energy with negligible toxic emissions.

HEAT EXCHANGE SYSTEM: USING LOCAL BAY WATER TO INCREASE HEATING AND COOLING EFFICIENCIES IN A RESIDENTIAL APPLICATION
Griffin Dell Shapiro, Zakaria Seghrouchni, 
Long Beach High School, Lido Beach, NY

There is a pressing need for residential heating and cooling methods that use renewable resources are cost effective and environmentally friendly. We took advantage of the fact that bay water changes much more slowly than the ambient air temperature due to the high specific heat of salt water. A heating-cooling system was created that pumps water from the seabed through a home to increase its temperature during the winter and decrease its temperature during the summer. This is similar to a geothermal system in which water from the ground is used. A model was constructed using a wooden box and foam core insulation to act as a residential house on a bay. To simulate a winter environment, the house was placed inside a refrigerator at a constant 0.5ºC. For the summer environment, five incandescent lights were focused on the house to heat it to a constant 35ºC. In each condition, a steady supply of water (10.5ºC, average local bay water temp.) was pumped into the house at a rate of 2 Liters/hr for one hour. We used a heat exchange system made of a copper coil similar to a modern home radiator to warm the “winter” house and cool the “summer” house. Temperature probes were placed inside and outside the house, and in the water being pumped. We found that the temperature of the winter house increased by 3.5ºC; equivalent to 31 British thermal units (BTU). The warm house decreased by 4.7ºC and 42 BTU. We calculated that normally, a 2,600 sq. foot house (U.S. average) requires 26,000 W to heat. Our method would only require 5,000 W to perform the same heating. We can conclude that a heating-cooling system using local bay water coupled with an electric or gas heater would be an effective residential air-conditioning system to significantly reduce costs by approximately 25%.

Abstract<br><br> Does changing the nutrient source change the voltage produced in a mediator-less microbial fuel cell (MFC)? Two independent variables and one control variable were used in the anode containers for this experiment. The control variable (I.1) was 100% Milwaukee River silt (MRS). One independent variable (I.2) was 75% MRS and 25% sugar. Another independent variable (I.3) was 75% MRS and 25% compost mixture. In order to create a conductive solution in the cathode 75% water was diluted with 25% salt. During testing the voltmeter was connected to the anode and cathode electrodes. All MFCs were tested twice daily over the course of 14 days, once at 6:00 a.m. and then again at 3:00 p.m. In addition to the voltage being measured twice daily, ambient and internal temperatures were also measured. Throughout the experiment, pH was measured twice. In conclusion, I.1 produced the highest average voltage. However, on day three the voltage reading suddenly dropped to .00 volts, the next day the voltage returned to a normal range. I.2 produced the second highest average voltage. The voltage readings for the I.2 MFCs also dropped down to .00 volts on the third day. In addition to this sudden drop, the voltage reading dropped to -.14 volts for one of the MFCs on day eight and continuously decreased for the duration of the experiment. I.3 stayed at .00 or above for the entire 14 days of testing but failed to produce the high voltage produced by the other independent variables.

The purpose of this experiment is to determine the amount of energy created from the combustion of a non-genetically modified algae-based bio fuel in relation to energy from commercially available gasoline and diesel fuels.<br><br>The bio fuel procured from algae consists of the lipids that are present in each individual algae cell. The process of gathering these lipids can be fairly inexpensive if the right equipment is used. First, the plants are placed in water and blended to rupture the cells; next the mixture is placed in a centrifuge to separate the lipids from other cell materials. The lipids will end up at the bottom of the centrifuge tubes, where they can be easily collected. Once the lipids are collected, they are distilled to remove water and other impurities. The remaining liquid is the bio fuel.<br><br>Bio fuel created from non-genetically modified algae produced about 3.3 to 3.5 kilo-joules of energy per milliliter of fuel combusted. This is about one-tenth the energy value of gasoline, however, the bio fuel has no additives that increase its energy and has undergone a rudimentary refining process compared to commercially produced gasoline. (As per the Law of Conservation of Energy, the energy used to refine commercial gasoline is transferred to the gasoline and released when it is burned; adding to its energy output)<br><br>Bio fuel prepared from non-genetically modified algae has the potential to produce a high amount of energy with the appropriate additives, and when refined to remove the water and impurities.

SUN IN YOUR EYES? ELECTROCHROMIC SUN-TRACKING WINDSHIELD
Rafael S Cosman, Aaron Schild, 
La Jolla High School, La Jolla, CA

The Electrochromic Sun-Tracking Windshield (ESTW) is an automatic machine vision system for cars which determines when the sun is in the driver’s field of view and rapidly darkens a small portion of the windshield to block the direct sunlight. It minimizes dangerous driver distraction due to bright, low-angle sunlight and eliminates the need for manual sun visors.<br><br> <br><br> This engineering project involved system design, parts acquisition and integration, and creation of image analysis and camera calibration software. The project has been taken from initial concept through testing and deployment on a vehicle driving on city streets.<br><br> <br><br> The ESTW prototype consists of five major components: ultrasonic range finder, camera, computer, microcontroller, and electrochromic panels. The camera sends images to the computer, which analyzes them to determine the sun's angle relative to the driver's eyes. The software instructs the microcontroller to darken specific panels necessary to block the sunlight. Electrochromic gel in the panels darkens with the application of voltage. When sunlight is no longer in the driver's eyes, the panels return to their transparent state. The ultrasonic range finder determines the driver's position in an initial calibration step, allowing the software to calculate the angle from the driver's eyes to each panel.<br><br> <br><br> The ESTW tracks and rapidly attenuates direct sunlight, eliminating the need for sun visors during real-world driving conditions. The ESTW technology can be extended to other vehicular scenarios including ships, aircraft, and spacecraft. The ESTW has the potential to reduce driver distraction, automobile injuries, and loss of life.

PEM PRODUCTIVITY: AN ANALYSIS OF EFFICIENCY-AFFECTING ASPECTS IN POLYMER ELECTROLYTE MEMBRANE FUEL CELLS THROUGH PRESSURE TRANSDUCERS IN A PRESSURE DECAY MODEL
Jackson Lee Frazier, Angela Smith, 
Louisville High School, Louisville, OH

Through variable manipulation in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells, efficiency can be altered which is the first step to increasing fuel cell competitiveness in the alternative energy market. Maximizing efficiency in fuel cells currently requires building a complete cell stack, dramatically increasing costs and complicating the research. Testing in current society requires long test periods and strenuous mathematical formulas that aren't entirely accurate. To simplify research on PEM fuel cells we designed and built a testing apparatus that tests for pressure decay on the anode side, as well as enabling the catalyst to be easily switched, allowing easier testing of chemical composition and platinum levels. Multiple tests indicate that the device is able to show pressure decay and also the potential voltage being lost, dramatically cutting costs in the lab and potentially lowering the price of fuel cells on the energy market.

WILL WAVES ONE DAY POWER THE WORLD?
Tyler Austin Green, Rachel Ann Campbell, 
Plymouth North High School, Plymouth, MA

Studies indicate that harnessing only a small percent of the ocean’s power could sustain the world. For decades, many organizations have been focusing on green energy. For this project two devices capable of harnessing the energy in ocean waves and converting it into electrical energy were built. The goal was to answer one question: Will waves one day power the world? <br><br> Two devices were conceptualized, designed, and constructed to illustrate the outstanding power in ocean waves. The shafts for the devices were made from wooden dowels. The first shaft contained five magnets and the second, a straight gear. The first generator was made using the copper coil and circuit board from a shake flashlight while the second was made with a gear system powering an electric motor.<br><br> Meters were used to measure the output of each device. To test the first device we passed the shaft through its generator ten times, whereas the second was passed once. Each pass simulated the rising and falling motion of ocean waves. The first device’s capacity was 60 passes. After measuring the amperage and voltage, we calculated the efficiencies. The first device’s was roughly 10% while the second’s was noticeably higher at about 16%. <br><br> These small devices generated measurable amounts of energy. The most practical way to harness the ocean’s energy would be with larger, similar devices creating a “wave farm”. This would create huge amounts of energy with each passing wave. With enough of these farms, waves could easily power our world.

A NOVEL AND EFFICIENT METHOD OF HYDROGEN PRODUCTION: OPTIMIZING THE MICROBIAL ELECTROLYSIS CELL AND MICROBIAL FUEL CELL COUPLED SYSTEM
Aakriti Jain, Cheng Cheng, 
Lynbrook High School, San Jose, CA

Hydrogen fuel cells are a clean and renewable energy source. However, common methods of hydrogen production require a 2 Volt input. Our project aims to eliminate the need for electricity in producing H2 by creating a new configuration of the microbial fuel cell and microbial electrolysis cell coupled system (MFC-MEC coupled system), which produces H2 without any external power source. An MFC is a bioreactor, converting organic waste into electrical energy via catalytic reactions of microbes. An MEC uses redox reactions to produce H2. Our first goal was to engineer an MFC-MEC system and observe H2 production. Our second goal was to test how the system’s H2 output is affected by two variables: anode cell pH (5, 6, 7) and the number of MFCs connected to a system (2, 3). Our procedure consisted of constructing MFC-MEC cells from PVC pipes and adding E. coli, neutral red, acetate, and buffer into the anode chamber. We connected our system in a series circuit. To collect data, we attached probes to our cells to measure the system voltage and current. We used eudiometers to measure H2 production. Our results show that as the number of MFCs coupled to the system increases, the voltage increases; thereby showing our system is a circuit. As the pH increases, the voltage of the MFC-MEC system increases. Increasing the number of MFCs increases H2 production by approx. 2 mL of H2 per day. H2 production is also directly proportional to pH. In conclusion we produced H2 from our MFC-MEC system and tested the variables of the pH and MFC number to show that increases in both variables leads to more efficient H2 production. Instead of using electricity as does current industrial methods, our coupled system uses microbes and low-cost organic material such as wastewater to produce hydrogen.

SOLVING THE CURRENT DILEMMA: AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO CREATE ALTERNATIVE ENERGY USING OCEANIC PHENOMENA
Diana Yuri Cabral, Noelle Owen, 
St. Andrew's Priory School, Honolulu, HI

The purpose of this project was to engineer an apparatus capable of converting the stored energy from oceanic currents into useable electrical energy. Though one source of technology for exploiting tidal currents for large-scale power generation exists, there are several inherent problems with the design; most notably its lack of flexibility in different oceanic situations, the difficulties in maintaining it, and the potential for oceanic debris to restrict the functionality, <br><br>A turbine system was constructed, to curb the problems identified with the system already in existence. The infrastructure was then created to utilize both shallow and deep-water currents. After the construction of the turbine was completed, bench tests were conducted and revealed that the potential power output of the motor being used, was more efficient than the potential power output determined by the manufacturer. The constructed turbine was then tested at Kaneohe Bay. This determined the success of the turbine because it proved to produce potential electrical power from both shallow and deeper oceanic currents.<br><br>Ultimately, through the analysis of gathered data, the speed of the oceanic current proved to be directly proportional to the rotations per minute of the propeller on the turbine. Thus, the output of electrical energy was dependant on the speed of oceanic currents. The constructed oceanic current turbine can be used to create renewable energy at this point in time. In the future, however, studies will be conducted to improve the system’s efficiency. In addition, energy will be stored as hydrogen gas in fuel cells instead of electrical energy in attached batteries.

HEIGHT VS. POWER
Alyssa Noriko Braun, Ashley Bonilla, Meghan Fujimoto
Kauai High School, Lihue, HI

Our experiment was designed to answer the question; “Will raising the height of a storage container of a hydroelectric plant increase the amount of energy (mWatts) produced?” We constructed a hydroelectric turbine from various sizes of Legos™. The construction of the turbine consisted of a wheel with multiple vanes (6 paddles) that were used to turn the generator (9 volt direct current) which in turn powered an electric motor. An approximate 19 (18.92) liter container was used as the storage bin for the water and a ladder was used to change the height of the storage bin. The water container height began at 2.74 meters and was raised in 0.3048 meter increments until a total of 8 measurements were collected. During each increment the approximately 19 liter container was emptied onto the turbine through a connected clear hose and the resulting energy was measured in direct current (D.C.) volts and milliamperes. <br><br>The results showed that with each increase in height of the storage bin, the amount of energy produced (mWatts) increased as was predicted in our hypothesis. By raising the height of the storage bin, you increase the potential energy of the water leading to the hydroelectric turbine, causing it to produce more energy. After the statistical analysis our results were shown to be statistically significant with a correlation coefficient of <br><br>R² = 0.95, and p = 3.5 x 10-5. This project was done on a very small scale but we believe that the results would be similar even if the scale were to be increased. <br><br>

THE ENGINEERING OF A NOVEL MAGNETIC LEVITATION TRAIN PROPULSION SYSTEM THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF A COIL CURRENT GRADIENT
Christopher Joseph Davlantes
Bishop Kenny High School, Jacksonville, FL

Electromagnetic levitation trains have numerous advantages over conventional railroads because they implement a nearly frictionless track which allows for higher speeds and lower maintenance and energy costs.<br><br>The purpose of this project was to develop a new form of magnetic levitation commuter transportation that conserves both energy and materials.<br><br>A working model was constructed. Coils were designed that are able to levitate a piece of aluminum (representative of a train car) when powered with alternating current. A track of these coils was built, allowing a levitating aluminum disk to move in free linear motion when pushed.<br><br>Because a suspended object will accelerate towards an area of lower pressure, a magnetic pressure gradient was created between adjacent coils in the series to propel the aluminum disk. This gradient was formed by varying the currents of the coils. The currents were controlled by altering the duty cycles of MOSFETs within several H-bridge systems that were used to generate the AC which powered the circuit. Three H-bridges with independently modulated duty cycles were used to power every third coil in the series in order to provide a directional pressure gradient, yielding directional motion control. Because a larger coil current was created strictly by increasing the duration that a set voltage was applied to the coil series and not by an additional amperage draw from the source, creating a pressure gradient based on duty cycle regulated currents within the inductors is a power-friendly way to propel a train car; no extra power is used to accelerate the car once it is levitating. Also, combining the levitation and propulsion systems of the train into a single track system cuts down on the need for extra hardware, thus conserving resources.

EFFECTS OF DOPANTS ON THE MORPHOLOGY AND EFFICIENCY OF CONJUGATED POLYMER OPV DEVICES
Arjun Mathur
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, FL

Although quite efficient, current single crystal solar cells are unaffordable for the average consumer. Recently, Organic Photovoltaics (OPVs) have gained popularity due to their simpler method of production and therefore affordable prices. However, due to their low efficiencies, OPVs still have a higher price-efficiency ratio than silicon solar cells, making them not commercially viable. Since much of the sun's energy is in the infrared region, Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) OPVs were created and doped with a broad absorbing dye that can not only absorb visible, but also infrared energy in order to improve current output and efficiency. <br><br><br>ITO slides were cleaned and spin coated with a PEDOT:PSS solution. After the samples were transferred to a glove box, an active layer solution were smear coated onto each sample. The various samples contained active layers with a PCBM:P3HT:Dye weight ratio of the following levels: 1:1:0 (control), 1:1:0.05, 1:1:0.1, and 1:1:0.2. Next, aluminum and calcium were evaporated onto the device as the cathode. Copper wire contacts were then applied using silver epoxy. IV Curves were then taken using a Keithley device and a solar simulator for the light source.<br><br>AFM microscopy was then done on the surfaces of devices to conduct analysis.<br><br><br>In conclusion, the dye causes an increased absorbance in the infrared region creating a dramatic (30-40%) increase in short circuit current. This means that the application of the dye to OPVs can greatly increase current output and efficiency, thereby removing the single problem that has limited the commercial spread of OPVs.

PLUGGING INTO THE SUN: DEVELOPING A COST-EFFECTIVE METHOD FOR DYE-SENSITIZED SOLAR CELLS USING ZINC OXIDE NANOSTRUCTURES
Devika Mehta
Arkansas School for Mathematics, Sciences and the Arts, Hot Springs, AR

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) have been an organic twist on the technical aspects of the solar energy industry. Its resilience and flexibility make it particularly appealing for energy production. Zinc oxide has shown potential in the past as a cheaper material than conventional materials used for solar cells. As a result, the goal of this project was to develop a cost-effective method for the preparation of for dye-sensitized solar cells using inexpensive materials such as zinc oxide and titanium dioxide and a cost-effective growth method of nanostructures. A thin zinc oxide film was first electrochemically deposited onto ITO-coated glass as a seeding layer at -2.43 V. Zinc oxide nanowires were subsequently grown above, using a potential of -2.43V. Using a suspension, titanium dioxide nanoparticles were sintered on top of the nanowires. The completed electrode was dyed using an organic anthocyanin dye. A platinized counter electrode and iodide electrolyte completed the cell. IV curves from the nanowire-based cell were compared to those from traditional titanium dioxide DSSCs. The IV curves showed a behavior uncharacteristic of dye-sensitized solar cells, exhibiting a linear behavior as opposed to a curved line, and the electrical output was much smaller. SEM photos showed significant cracking, with the layer of titanium dioxide nanoparticles not fully seeping between the nanowires. Photoluminescent spectra taken using a 325-nm He-Cd laser indicated some defect emissions. Ultimately, the interface between the titanium dioxide and zinc oxide caused unexpected complications, and further investigation is required to stabilize the cell.

POWER UP!: EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND MATHEMATICAL OPTIMIZATION OF A DUAL ROTOR WIND TURBINE
Andrew Samuel Ylitalo

The purpose of this project was to study the energy-saving effects of placing a second rotor upwind of the main rotor of a horizontal axis wind turbine. These effects were tested and optimized in a designed experiment.<br><br>A lab scale windmill accommodating multiple rotors was designed and built to test the dual rotor design. To generate a laminar air stream during experimentation, a wind tunnel was constructed. Finally, the effects of varying wind speed, number of blades, blade size, blade pitch, angle of offset of rotors, and the distance between them were studied. Effects were measured using electrical output in volts.<br><br>After the run order of experiments was generated for a factorial design, approximately 500 experiments were conducted to determine the variables significant enough to have an effect in optimization. This was found through data analysis using a statistical analysis computer program. Following analysis, a response surface design was used to generate optimization plots that identified optimum variable settings as well as the theoretical electrical output of the optimized design.<br><br>It was concluded that the optimum dual rotor design resulted in about 1.9 times more electrical output than the same design without the second rotor. This optimum design featured a 60 degree angle offset, 30 degree blade pitch, blades of equal size on both rotors. Blade number and distance between blades were negligible based on the parameters used. Finally, the dual rotor design had a lower cut-in speed than the single rotor design, implying usability in locations with less wind.

THE CREATION AND TESTING OF A FULLY SUBMERSIBLE GEARED WATER TURBINE FOR ALTERNATIVE ENERGY PRODUCTION
Gavin Grant Ovsak
Eden Prairie High School, Eden Prairie, MN

Alternative energy production is an important part of our future energy resources. Every effort to optimize efficiency is needed to meet the goal set by the U.S. President during the 2011 State of the Union Address of nationally consuming 80% clean energy by 2035.<br><br>.<br><br>Hydro-electricity is an important energy source for many countries including the United States. In preparation for my project, I analyzed the designs of current hydro-electric generators. These widely-used, traditional turbines require targeted streams of water at one side of a rotating turbine created by either using a dam or placement at the upper barrier between a stream and the open air. I hypothesized that an alternative design which rotated the individual blades proportionately to the overall rotation of the turbine could generate more power than traditional turbines without the aid of a dam. Furthermore, a fully submersed water turbine eliminates the need for large, expensive dams and allows for power to be generated throughout the depths of a river instead of being restricted to water flow from the top.<br><br>.<br><br>To confirm the performance of my alternative turbine, I tested my new model using a 20 inch fresh water flume. I also tested an equal sized model of the traditional water turbine design as a test control above my new fully submersible water turbine model. Based on the comparative data collected, I confirmed that the new alternative water turbine would provide a viable option for increased energy collection and could expand the opportunities for extracting hydroelectric power.

ENERGY RELEASED VIA A CALORIMETRIC TEST OF VARIOUS BIOMASS RESOURCES: A STUDY OF DEHYDRATED FRUIT AND VEGETABLE MATTER
Jared David Kern
Miller City - New Cleveland High School, Miller City, OH

It is hypothesized that tangelo skins have more chemical energy per gram than other biomass test materials, therefore releasing the most heat. The reasoning is that the tangelo skins have the highest density when compared to other sources. The calorimetric setup included an aquarium, erlenmeyer flask, ring stand, and a heat-capturing cone. A select variety of fruit and vegetable skins were obtained and dehydrated. The dehydration process was stopped when the mass of the skins remained constant. Combustion of the skins released energy to the calorimetric setup. Temperature data was collected using a graphing calculator, CBL, and temperature probe. The change in temperature was recorded. The data was used to calculate the heat from the sources of biomass.<br><br> The tested materials contained different amounts of energy. After experimentation, it was determined that tangelo skins produced between 20% and 30% more heat than other tested biomass resources. The current state of the non-renewable resources creates a concern that energy supply will not be able to meet the demand. It is critical that scientific research focuses on economically and environmentally friendly alternate energy sources. The data indicates that ‘food scraps’ could become a viable world energy source.

WINDBELT APPLICATION TO VEHICLES IN MOTION
Taylor James Hay
Southwest Virginia Governor's School, Pulaski, VA

This is a continuation from a previous year’s project. Year one hypothesized that fuel consumption could be reduced by redirecting drag-producing airflow from the frontal area of a vehicle through an internal air duct. Computer simulations verified the feasibility of this hypothesis. It was further hypothesized that if this redirected air were passed through a wind-powered generator it could produce electric power to provide supplemental energy for the vehicle. Realizing that this generator might itself produce drag, the second year’s project focused on researching possible wind-powered generators that should have low inherent drag. One such promising technology was recently patented and introduced on an experimental basis and goes by the name of the Windbelt©. Because this technology has only been tested at air velocities less than 20 mph, this year’s project focused on testing Windbelt© at speeds more appropriate for highway vehicles. Software for producing 3D virtual models and incorporating CFD (Computer Fluid Dynamics) was used in order to obtain an idealized model for physical testing. The physical model was then built based on these results, and physical tests on the concept were run under actual highway conditions on a single Windbelt© element at vehicle speeds up to 60 mph. These tests verified that the elements will withstand normal driving conditions and that the power generated is proportional to the air velocity passing across the element. It was concluded that incorporation of multiple elements into an internal drag-reducing duct is a worthwhile candidate for further testing.

ACOUSTIC CAVITATION AT THE SOLID OXIDE ELECTROLYSIS CELL CATHODE LAYER FOR SUSTAINABLE HYDROGEN PRODUCTION
Eric Lau
Savannah Arts Academy, Savannah, GA

The current dependence of hydrogen production on the very hydrocarbon fuels that hydrogen intends to replace severely limits the viability of a sustainable hydrogen economy. High-temperature electrolysis (HTE) is an efficient alternative hydrogen production method, but it is limited by the need for a ready high heat source. This research consisted of the modeling of acoustic cavitation at a sonochemical reactor adjacent to the cathode layer of a modified solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) for sustainable hydrogen production. Acoustic cavitation is the oscillation of bubbles in a liquid irradiated with ultrasound, resulting in high-temperature conditions during collapse. This two-part model quantifies, for the first time, the comparison in electrical energy requirements for HTE between the modified SOEC and an unmodified SOEC at a standard operating temperature. MATLAB code was developed using the second-order Rayleigh-Plesset differential equation to model a single acoustically-driven bubble in water throughout its oscillation cycle; it was solved using the ode45 Runge-Kutta algorithm. The temperature of the water vapor inside the bubble at collapse, assuming adiabatic compression, was calculated to be 2695.9 K. This temperature was used in a thermodynamic model to determine the electrical energy demand of HTE for the modified and unmodified SOECs, which were 171.84 kJ/mol and 383.93 kJ/mol, respectively. This quantitatively shows that acoustic cavitation can substantially reduce the electrical energy demand of HTE. An SOEC model is being developed using the computational fluid dynamics code FLUENT and will provide a comprehensive range of data regarding SOEC performance with and without acoustic cavitation.

WHICH ETHANOL, CONSUMER GRADE SWEET POTATO OR COMMERCIALLY MADE CORN, IN A GASOLINE MIXTURE WILL EMIT THE LEAST AMOUNT OF NOXIOUS GASES, NAMELY HYDROCARBON (HC), CARBON MONOXIDE (CO), CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2), AND NITROUS OXIDE (NOX), WHEN RUN THROUGH A COMPATIBLE FOUR-STROKE ENGINE?
Kristin Virginia Walker
Warner Robins High School, Warner Robins, GA

Does consumer grade (sweet potato) ethanol emit the same amount of Hydrocarbons (HC), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Carbon Dioxide (CO2), and Nitrous Oxide (NOx) emissions as commercial grade (corn) ethanol when run through a compatible four-stroke engine? In this experiment, the scientist wanted to determine whether consumer grade was comparable to commercial grade in terms of toxic emissions produced in a gasoline mixture. It was hypothesized that if consumer and commercial grade were run through four-stroke engine at E50, then the amount of gaseous emissions-Hydrocarbons, Carbon Monoxide, Carbon Dioxide, and Nitrous Oxide-measured in the engine's exhaust, then consumer would be comparable to commercial grade. The manipulated variable was the ingredients of each of ethanol used, and the site and process of origin. The responding variable was the amount of Hydrocarbons, Carbon Monoxide, Carbon Dioxide, and Nitrous Oxide emissions. First, the consumer grade sweet potato ethanol was produced by the scientist. Then, a gasoline mixture was created for both ethanols at E50. Next, the scientist went to McDonough Tire Alignment Emissions to test each ethanol's Hydrocarbons, Carbon Monoxide, Carbon Dioxide, and Nitrous Oxide emissions and record their findings. After the experiment was complete, the scientist found that Commercial Grade Ethanol did indeed produce a lower amount of toxic emissions for every toxin. However, the margin of difference between Commercial and Consumer was relatively small. To further this study, the scientist would use an EPA approved engine in compliance with the Clean Air Act or use different forms of ethanol.

THE EFFECT OF TEXTURE ON AERODYNAMIC DRAG, PHASE II
Trevor Brian Neff
Cloquet Senior High School, Cloquet, MN

Drag has an effect on vehicle fuel efficiency. Determining the best aerodynamic surface texture could help reduce drag and improve fuel efficiency. Ultimately, reducing the cost of moving goods as well as the amount of carbon dioxide produced. The hypothesis was if texture effects drag, then small dimples etched into a wood block in a diagonal grid pattern will reduce drag. Eleven textured blocks, (small, medium, and large dimple in diagonal and inline grid patterns, as well as large/small and open/closed inline groove patterns, including a smooth control block) were hung from eye hooks attached to a spring scale, which then was attached to the top of a constructed vertical wind tunnel. Each block was weighed in the wind tunnel 21 times, once with the wind tunnel off, ten times with the wind tunnel on low, and ten with the wind tunnel on high. The results were averaged for each block at each wind speed. The hypothesis was supported the block with the small dimple pattern in the diagonal grid formation had the least amount of drag compared to the rest of the textures including the smooth control texture. Shipping companies could benefit from knowing that dimple patterns etched into the side of a truck’s trailer could reduce fuel costs, ultimately reducing costs for many consumers, while also moving toward a more sustainable world.

OIL FROM PLASTIC: FUEL OF THE FUTURE
Tyler A. Moon
Fort Mill Area Homeschoolers, Fort Mill, SC

This project investigates the production of oil through heating recyclable plastics to their boiling points and then condensing the vapors. This was accomplished by designing and building a steel pipe heating chamber with a copper condensation tube coming off the top to condense and carry the oil into a jar of water where the oil was collected. The initial experiments on five types of recyclable plastics showed that polypropylene and polystyrene yielded the largest percentage of oily fuel when the vapors of the boiling plastics were condensed. Polystyrene produced 75% fuel by weight and polypropylene produced 50% by weight. Combustion tests were conducted on each of the oily fuels showing that they were all combustible. Subsequent experiments showed that the oily fuel from polystyrene could run in an engine when mixed in a 20% solution with gasoline. Easily turning plastic into a usable fuel solves two problems: reducing dependency on crude oil and reducing waste plastic in landfills. Currently, most vehicles run on fuels from crude oil, which is a non-renewable energy source, while plastics are ending up in landfills. In 2009 only 7% of the 30 million tons of plastic waste generated was recycled. This project has shown that producing oil from plastics is possible. The oil can be used as a fuel, and it would help to keep plastic out of our landfills.

WIND BLOWN: WIND TURBINE DESIGN
Krista Renee Nussey
Cornerstone Christian School, San Angelo, TX

The purpose of this project was to determine if more surface area on the blades of a wind generator increases the amount of voltage generated. The hypothesis was that model #3 would produce the most voltage because it had the most surface area. In order to test this, I designed and built three different wind generator blades that all had varying surface area. I tested each one three times each by fixing a blade to the generator and stand and placing the whole apparatus one foot from the wind source or fan. The fan was set to the highest speed which created approximately ten MPH of wind, and a volt meter was used to measure the voltage produced. The measurements for each of the three tests were recorded. From these measurements, I calculated the volt readings per gram and the voltage readings per inch of surface area. From these measurements, I was able to conclude that my hypothesis was incorrect. the blades with the least surface area produced the most voltage per inch of surface area. <br><br> The control of this project was model #1 because it’s design was similar to that of a popular three bladed wind turbine. the variable of this procedure was the changing of the blade models. The constant factors of this experiment were the wind speed, the distance the model wind turbine was placed from the wind source, the generator, the blade support, and the volt meter. <br><br> Wind energy is becoming an increasingly important topic as energy suppliers are searching for cleaner forms of renewable energy, and as other more traditional sources of energy are becoming sparse and more expensive. The findings and observations from this project could be utilized and directed toward improvement in design of wind turbines.

ENGINEERING AN AFFORDABLE ELECTRIC VEHICLE, YEAR 2: RANGE TESTING AND OPTIMIZATION
Joel Jack Tinker
Covenant Christian Academy, Huntsville, AL

Due to the poor economic and environmental record of the U.S., interest in electric vehicles (EVs) is beginning to increase. Since EVs do not require gasoline or oil, significant cost savings can be realized over time. Electric vehicles produce zero emissions; therefore, they are more environmentally friendly than gas-powered vehicles. A major concern for EVs is their limited range (distance traveled between battery charges), which is affected by battery performance, vehicle weight, aerodynamic drag, and rolling resistance.<br><br> The purpose of this project was to optimize the range performance of an electric vehicle through the use of aerodynamic and rolling resistance enhancements. First, the effects of average speed, maximum speed, and temperature on range were determined. Next, several aerodynamic and rolling resistance enhancements, including aerodynamic and flat bed covers, spoilers, wheel well covers, low rolling resistance tires, and low-viscosity drive train fluids were investigated in coast-down testing. Finally, selected aerodynamic and rolling resistance enhancements were used in additional range testing. <br><br> Range testing for the baseline vehicle showed that range decreased with increased average speed and with lower temperatures. Coast-down testing showed that the aerodynamic bed cover was the most effective enhancement at reducing drag, providing a 3 percent average increase in speed. The low rolling resistance tires were highly effective at reducing rolling resistance, achieving a 3.1 percent average increase in speed. Range testing for the vehicle with the combined selected aerodynamic and rolling resistance enhancements showed a dramatic 21.4 percent average increase in range compared to the baseline vehicle.

PREVENTING FOREIGN OBJECT DAMAGE OF JET ENGINES WITH A NEW ENGINE INTAKE
Elizabeth Louise Godfrey
Northside Health Careers High School, San Antonio, TX

Foreign object damage is hazardous to aircraft, as engine intakes allow both air and foreign debris to enter engines freely. This project was undertaken with the purpose of creating a simple engine intake that forces out 70% of solid particulate without materially retarding airflow. Several intakes were designed using fluid mechanics principles and constructed using household materials. A vacuum attached to each intake exit simulated a jet engine. Thirty grams each of three particulate types (small-sized flour, medium-sized pickling salt, and relatively large metallic spheres called dragees) were directed through the intake to test particulate removal. The amount of particulate not ingested by the vacuum was weighed to determine percent removal. Results for ten trials for each intake and particulate type were averaged to determine mean particulate removal percentages. The two intakes that removed the highest percentage of particulate had slanted baffles on opposite sides to redirect airflow. The one with flat baffles removed 48% of small and almost all medium and large particulate, while one with scooped baffles removed 67% of small particulate and 93% of all other particulate. Both seemed to somewhat impede airflow. Practical applications are prevention of foreign object damage and improvement of air safety. The most successful intakes need to be redesigned to minimize airflow obstruction and tested thoroughly. Cyclonic separation and why certain intake designs failed are worth later investigation. In conclusion, the purpose of the study was almost achieved with simplicity and the particulate removal goal substantially achieved.

HARVESTING THE WIND, A FOUR YEAR STUDY
Ryan William-Dennis Blanford
Carroll High School, Dayton, OH

Regulations have been adopted by over half of US states to produce 10-20% of their electrical power from renewable energy sources by 2025. Individual home systems can be a part of this initiative. This project was to determine what needed to be changed on a Vertical Axis Wind Turbine’s alternator to generate a sufficient output to charge a 12 Volt car battery. It was hypothesized that if the number of coils, poles and opposing magnets are each doubled consecutively, then the VAWT alternator’s output voltage should double with each improvement and the final configuration should develop an eightfold increase in output voltage, and thereby be sufficient to charge a 12 Volt car battery. A “Control Phase” and three subsequent phase alternators were tested. Each subsequent phase alternator was improved over the “Control Phase” alternator, by increasing the number of coils, magnetic poles, and opposing magnets. The average DC voltage was measured at multiple RPM speeds so as to give a range of comparisons with the “Control Phase”. The lab tests showed the voltage of the Phase III alternator, spinning at a constant speed of 46 RPM, was increased 8.6 times over the “Control Phase”. In conclusion, the hypothesis was supported; however, the problem was not solved. In lab testing, the Phase III VAWT could charge a 12 Volt car battery; but, when placed outdoors, the armature’s increased electrical load became too great for the blades. Further testing using improved blades could help the turbine perform more efficiently in low winds.

MAXIMIZING HYBRID ROCKET MOTOR EFFICIENCY FOR EVALUATING RECYCLABLE AND RENEWABLE FUELS
Megan Lynn Perkins
DuPont Manual Magnet High School, Louisville, KY

Hybrid rocket motors combine a liquid oxidizer (nitrous oxide) and a solid fuel for combustion. Hybrid rocket motors are less complex, safer, and cleaner burning than traditional rocket motors. In 2006, SpaceShipOne used a hybrid rocket motor to win the prestigious Ansari X-Prize and become the first privately-funded space plane.<br><br>The purpose of this research was to test the hybrid rocket motor to evaluate combustion properties of different solid fuels and their associated air emissions. The research focused on both the transportation benefits of hybrid rocket motors and evaluated the energy benefits of various recyclable and renewable fuels. <br><br>A newly designed fixed bulkhead that separated the oxidizer from the solid fuel was used to replace the floating bulkhead and allow for the use of softer fuels. The test stand was enclosed by a reinforced wood and steel casing for safety and to capture and measure combustion by-products. Thrust was measured with a load cell and air emissions by a hand-held VOC monitor. <br><br>The results indicate that hybrid motors can be effectively fueled by a wide variety of recyclable and renewable materials such as plastics, rubbers and wood. Polypropylene was concluded to be the best-performing recyclable fuel and wood the best renewable. Hybrid rocket motors can now burn on renewable resources using fuels as simple as wood. The new fixed bulkhead design made it possible to easily test different fuels on a small scale for hybrid fuel research and experimentation. The potentials for hybrid rocket motor development are endless.

CLEAN PRODUCTION OF BIODIESEL USING THE MICROALGAE NANNOCHLOROPSIS OCULATA
Vitoria Rech Astolfi
Fundacao Escola Tecnica Liberato Salzano Vieira da Cunha, Novo Hamburgo, Rio Grande do Sul, BRASIL

This research aims to produce biodiesel from the oil obtained by the microalgae Nannochloropsis oculata. The microalgae can supply up to 25 times more oil than oleaginous plants, the species N. oculata, in particular, contains a lipid fraction of about 16%. Furthermore, it is adapted to the shade, thus, it can be grown in all seasons of the year and in various regions, including places that have infertile land, via cultivation in tanks. Having in mind the social and environmental problems caused by the increase in carbon dioxide emissions primarily due to fossil fuels burning, this project envisages the use of the oil extracted from microalgae Nannochloropsis oculata biomass, a renewable raw material, for the production of biodiesel. With glycerin, the byproduct of the reaction to obtain biodiesel, a new fuel additive will be made in a form that will not generate any production waste. The experiment was initiated growing the microalgae Nannochloropsis oculata with the culture medium F/2 (Guillard, 1975). Then the microalgae oil was extracted. It was made the counting of the microalgae cells in Neubauer Chamber. The experiments showed that 1 m3 of cultivation with about 2 x 107 cells/mL can generate approximately 625 grams of oil. After purifying the oil, it was reacted with methanol producing biodiesel. Using glycerin and propanone, a fuel additive was produced. The obtaining of the products were confirmed using thin layer chromatography and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Therefore, it is possible to produce biodiesel from microalgae without generating waste.

NEW CONCEPT TO IMPROVE THE PHOTOVOLTAIC CONVERSION EFFICIENCY
Bowen Zhu
High School Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, CHINA

As the traditional energy sources are limited,the solar energy becomes one of the most important alternate energy sources. Low photovoltaic conversion efficiency is the main bottleneck in the application of solar energy. The current technology is to increase this efficiency by improving the surface structure and the concentrator of solar panels. In my research,a more simple and effective method to improve the photovoltaic conversion efficiency is realized by using spherical convex lenses and anti-reflection films. The glass beads,as a kind of spherical convex lens with focusing ability,are arrayed on the solar cell substrate surface to increase the sunlight acceptance angle while sol-gel anti-reflection films are coated to increase the light transmissivity. <br><br>In the experiment,different samples are prepared with various combinations of sol-gel coatings with different sizes of glass beads. And the sizes of glass beads are chosen according to the theoretical-calculated parameters. Then the samples are respectively tested under the illumination of sunlight,halogen lamp,LED,and laser radiation with three different wavelengths. In the case that the samples are illuminated by a halogen lamp with a large incidence angle(70°),results show that the conversion efficiency is relatively improved by 15.73% compared with the non-processed solar cells. The results indicate that it is feasible to improve the photovoltaic conversion efficiency with glass beads and sol-gel anti-reflection films. Finally,the size of the glass beads is optimized and the aging problem is also analysed.<br><br>This method is simple,and the cost is much lower than most of the solar concentrators at present. The experiment proves that this design is significant in improving the photovoltaic conversion efficiency.

DRAG'N'BALL: HOW THE HUMPBACK WHALES BUMPED FLIPPERS CAN HELP US TO RENEWABLE ENERGY
Hanne Binder
Vejle Technical High School, Vejle, DENMARK

This project in its present form is a study on the efficiency of a new design of wing profiles. The design is inspired by the bumped flippers of the humpback whale. It is said that the bumps helps lowering the amount of drag produced when the whale moves through water. It requires less energy to move a profile creating a small amount of drag through a fluid than one creating large amounts of drag. If the wings on a wind turbine made less drag, the turbine would be able to collect energy at lower wind speeds than today. The aim with the experiments was to figure out how the bumps are to be designed to get the optimal characteristics. <br><br>Wing sections with differently designed bumps were produced and tested in series together with a traditional wing section. The experiments were conducted at a professional test facility and data were collected with laser equipment and pressure measurements along with supplementary equipment. <br><br>The results indicate that some bumps lower the amount of created drag with up to 32% compared to a traditional wing profile. The technology could with further research increase the output of already existing wind turbines, and enables wind turbine establishment in places where the normal wind conditions at present time inhibit it.

A WIND-WIND SOLUTION
Juan Enrique Montoya
Jonesboro High School, Jonesboro, AR

This project is to show how we can better conserve and produce energy without harming the environment by using wind power. The initial idea was to build a wind turbine and to see if it produces clean energy and to see if the number of propellers and its angle had an effect on lighting a scale model home. It is important to recognize that energy plays a critical role in how we work or play and even survive. Since we use energy all the time, we need better energy conservation programs to help protect our environment. To test on how well wind energy really is, I used a scale model wind turbine to light up a scale model house. I built a generator, the wind mill, and used thin wood to make the propellers. I tested 2 to 4 propellers at angles from 0 to 90 degrees to see what effect it had on lighting a home. I measured how strong it lite the home, but also saw the difference in voltages. When I had 2 props as the angle increased the lights got stronger. From 30 to 90 degree, the lights became brighter as it ranged from 20.7 to 8.42 volts, however when I started with 0 to 20 degrees no light produced rangeing from 0.06 to 1.72. With three props, it took a while to light up as I increased the angle. From 60 to 90 degrees, it started to light up from 3.10 to 5.60 volts and from 0 to 50 degrees had a range of 0.58 to 2.50 volts. Four props turned 50 to 80 degrees, it started to light but not at its strongest from 3.25 to 2.91 volts. From 0 to 40 degrees and 90 degrees, gave no light at all rangeing from 0.02 to 2.32 and 0.02 volts. Through this experiment I learned that wind energy can light our homes just fine, while it takes care of our enviornment. We cannot ignore the fact that we use energy daily. Wind can be an important renewable energy souce.

ROLE OF PLCA AND MYBA IN OIL ACCUMULATION AND PLCA IN RESPONSE TO NACL STRESS IN CAMELINA SATIVA
Elise Genevieve Viox
Cor Jesu Academy, St. Louis, MO

DNA from Myba-OE and PLCa-OE transgenic Camelina sativa plants was extracted. Through polymerase chain reaction, the presence of the overexpressed genes were verified. After allowing ample time for the transgenic and wild type camelina plants to complete their life cycles, the seed pods of the dried plants were crushed, sifted, and the seeds collected and allotted time to completely desiccate. Two or three five seed samples were taken from each plant. After determining the biomass of each group of seeds, a fatty acid extraction was performed. An aliquot of the top layer extracted from each test tube was then run through a gas chromatograph. Using the data obtained from the gas chromatograph and the biomasses of each group of seeds, the percent oil content of the seeds of each plant were determined. In addition, a comparison of primary root growth of PLCa-OE transgenic camelina plants to wild type camelina plants under NaCl stress was recorded by sterilizing the seeds, plating them in 1/2MS agar, transferring the seedlings to plates with varying concentrations of NaCl, and measuring the growth of the primary root of each plant every 24 hours. Through the overexpression of Myba in camelina, it was concluded that a variation in seed oil content was produced. This may have been due to accidental suppression through attempts at overexpression. In addition, the overexpression of PLCa in camelina was determined to lead to a 36% relative gain in oil content, an increased seed size, and a decreased sensitivity to NaCl stress.

GENERATING CLEAN ELECTRICAL TIDAL POWER, YEAR THREE OF AN ONGOING STUDY
Kyle Scott Saleeby
Niceville High School, Niceville, FL

The purpose of my experiment is to produce clean electrical power,in usable quantities, from tidal water flow. I redesigned the waterwheel used in last year's project to improve results. I rewrote the computer program, enabling it to compute the math for more complex waterwheel designs, and to calculate the waterwheel power output, and force. The main problems with my previous device <br><br>were the stability of the waterwheel under heavy load, and the consistency of the output of power. Also, something I considered was how to further improve the power output of the waterwheel. After writing the computer program in Visual Basic, I constructed a one meter diameter by one meter long simple waterwheel out of recycled aluminum road signs, with 12 segmented blades. It now has 3 offset sections that enable it to harvest more force and torque in smoother rotations, and in turn achieve more power production. It rotates on a greased pipe as an axle. I also constructed a 37:1 ratio gear box out of rear bicycle sprockets and bicycle chains. My waterwheel powered a car alternator with the gear box to produce 800 watts of power at a 4 knot tidal current at an efficiency of approximately 5%. I surpassed my expected results and produced over 80 amps of current. Tidal flow at the Destin, FL Pass averages 4 to 6 knots, 22 hours every day. My waterwheel begins generating usable power at 1 to 1 ½ knots water speed depending on the electrical load attached. This waterwheel can be applied to almost any environment to produce clean, usable amounts of energy. In my hometown, I could now power LED streetlights over the 1000 meter Destin Bridge. My computer program was also successful and can accurately simulate and project the expected results of my waterwheel tests.

A NEW SEMICONDUCTOR SCREENING METHOD FOR SOLAR FUELS PRODUCTION
Megan Katherine Mercer
Ballard High School, Louisville, KY

At present, there are no perfectly suitable semiconductors for solar hydrogen production. There are also no suitable research methods that can screen a number of materials for their performance quickly and without a moving part. Here, it is shown that one can construct a semiconductor application device to quickly create working electrodes with hundreds of tertiary and binary compositions, and scan them instantly using a system of switches that when turned on allow current readings and when turned off stop current. If the current output seems promising when the electrode is scanned, then the next step is to analyze elemental composition of the area tested to characterize a potential commercially viable material. This was done using nickel (II), iron (III), and copper (II) nitrate solutions respectively and in mixtures on fluorine-doped tin oxide slides. The deposited semiconductors were then scanned in potassium hydroxide solution using the above-mentioned method, and analyzed for composition using a dispersive x-ray spectroscopy machine attached to a scanning electron microscope. The ultimate purpose was develop a way to scan many permutations of materials quickly to provide the needed aid in perfecting the photochemical electrolysis and photocatalysis technology towards creating a clean, green, efficient alternative energy source.

ELECTRICITY ON THE FLY
Robert Andrew Newcomer
Ballard High School, Louisville, KY

This project was designed to help further the abilities of free energy magnet wheels to generate electricity. The use of torque converters, multiple generators and alternators, torque up magnets, magnetic shielding materials, transformers, and electromagnetic induction circuits were included to help squeeze every bit of electricity possible out of the wheel. The wheel is spun by precisely placed magnets repelling against each other and turning the wheel which spins as alternator through a torque converter and moves magnets across a generator. Two circuits are created from generator and one from the alternator. The circuits pass through transformers and parallel, electromagnetic induction-promoting stages. They are then joined as a parallel circuit to maximize electric output. The wheel successfully spun a 180% speed gear and shifted up successfully spinning a 360% speed gear. After reaching the highest speed gear (360% speed) the voltage output of electricity was about .1V but spiked often. The Free Energy Wheel in this project, just as in other projects has proved to be a failure. Almost no electricity was produced and both the large and small scale wheels proved unable to function for more than a few seconds. This is a very unreliable source of energy and this project was able to make these machines any more feasible.

SOLAR ENERGY FOR ALL: LOW-COST RESIDENTIAL CONCENTRATOR PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEM DESIGN
Yinshuo Zhang
Mankato West High School, Mankato, MN

The transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy requires support and investment by common house owners, yet since the modern solar cell was invented in 1946, there still isn’t a practical solar energy solution that can provide affordable and sufficient electricity to power most if not all household appliances. Instead of focusing on increasing the conversion efficiency of the PV module, I designed the innovative Sunlight Optical Low-cost Trough-Approximation Concentrator (SOLTAC) that would increase the amount of light energy received by the PV module. This concentrator photovoltaic system (CPV) I have designed is unique in its use of cheap components, such as the reliable, environmentally benign crystalline silicon PV module and an array of flat mirrors. To accurately focus light onto the PV module, I wrote a program called Mircom. Mircom automatically calculates the dimensions and positions of each flat mirror according to several perimeters that we would provide. Mircom has a built-in error correction system to ensure accuracy as well as an optimization algorithm to achieve maximum cost-effectiveness. After vigorous consultation, experimentation, and modification, I have created the first residential CPV system that is economical, versatile, and most of all, environmentally friendly (most existing CPV systems contain toxic materials or rare metals). Furthermore, a large-scale version of my design would provide affordable electricity for farms, urban buildings, or regions without utility grids.

MATHEMATIC MODELING OF THE WAKE EFFECT
Wylie Joel Keller
Monte Vista High School, Monte Vista, CO

Windmills have been used for thousands of years to capture wind energy. Now, as wind farms increase in size and the cost of construction is increased, efficiency is a key factor for future development. A single turbine in an airstream casts a wake of slower, more turbulent air that affects all turbines behind it. The purpose of this experiment was to model the shape and size of the wake. Current models exist for this, but are based on either results from a wind tunnel or pure abstract math. Such models are accurate to a certain degree, but do not reflect real world conditions. This experiment was done using two windmills mounted in various configurations on a board that was mounted on a vehicle that moved 15 mph. It was found that factors other than the wake cast by the front turbine were affecting the back turbine, so those variables had to be factored out using a model designed by this experiment. Once these results had been adjusted they were mapped visually and compared to visual models of the pre-existing models. The results showed a wake that was more like a flame than the theoretical cone proposed by existing models. In addition, a “sweet spot” with an actual acceleration in wind was found near the back of the wake. Thus, the wake found in a real world setting was modeled and shown to be different than the theoretical models. Because of this, turbine arrangement in a wind farm should consider this model.

VIN-RADAS (Vehicle-Information-Network-based Road Accident Dynamic Alert System) is designed for timely accident prevention and first aid, especially for minimizing highway pileups, which accounted for 36.3% of the 33, 808 road fatalities around the US in 2009. The system updates automotive communication system from V2V (Vehicle to Vehicle) to V2Vs and innovatively sets the vehicle as bidirectional source of data receiving and sending, thus creates the dynamic alert system for the involved vector domain. <br><br>Developed on the basis of current in-car system and public communication networks, a VIN-RADAS terminal processes data connected with safety from the vehicle, including in-car and surrounding environment, public networks and driver for early abnormity detecting and risk assessment, sending an alert message within 1s to the system center, which takes no more than 1s to precisely locate the accident and broadcast the alert message to VIN-RADAS terminals on vehicles running on the same direction within 1 kilometer vector area, to traffic administration offices and medical rescues, making it possible for actions, such as braking, cornering, speed controlling, detouring, search and rescue, to be taken immediately. <br><br>Highway pileups being avoided, VIN-RADAS helps enormously in preventing road traffic injuries, fatalities and property damages; improving traffic flows by easing the congestion caused by car collisions; detecting accidents happened in remote areas to facilitate the first aid. It can also intelligently handle data concerning harsh weather, unfavorable road conditions, vehicle abnormities and all sorts of valuable information useful to obtain the ultimate goal of road safety: zero fatality .

SYNTHESIS OF COMPLEX NANOSTRUCTURES FOR SOLAR CELLS: ANALYSIS USING NOVEL D-SCOPEN
Shyamal Buch
Vista del Lago High School, Folsom, CA

Lowering the cost of solar energy collection devices hinges on the development of alternative solar cell architectures and sustainable synthesis methods. Solar cells based on wide-bandgap semiconductors are actively being researched. The morphology of the semiconductor nanostructure plays a key role in solar cell performance. Nanoparticles favor high internal surface area, while single-crystal nanowires have fast electron transport. Complex nanostructures have the potential to optimize both photon absorption and charge transport. In this project, complex nanostructures were synthesized using a facile, low-temperature, direct on-substrate, and template-free process with environmentally-friendly materials and no specialized equipment. The nanostructures were characterized by scanning electron microscopy. The synthesis method was shown to produce nanostructures of different morphologies by substituting a single reactant. The nanostructured electrodes were subsequently integrated into solar cells using low-cost, non-toxic materials. These solar cells were characterized using an instrument (D-SCOPEn) redesigned for improved accuracy and portability. A new user interface was programmed for real-time display and mathematical analysis of cell parameters. Solar cell performance was shown to scale with growth cycles. A promising method of base layer nucleation was developed and compared with the conventional high-temperature method. Several solar cell parameters compared favorably with published results. This synthesis process is well-suited to broad deployment due to its affordability, yield, and low environmental impact. Further research into controlled and scalable growth of complex nanostructures may define the future of solar cell technology.

OPTIMIZATION OF A MICROBIAL FUEL CELL TO DRIVE A BIOELECTROCHEMICALLY ASSISTED WASTEWATER TREATMENT REACTOR
Ryota Ishizuka
Greenwich High School, Greenwich, CT

Bioelectrochemically Assisted Microbial Reactor (BEAMRs) promise to employ organic materials in wastewater to produce hydrogen at high conversion efficiencies. In past literature, the non-spontaneous BEAMR reaction has been supplemented by external artificial power sources. Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) may, instead, drive such BEAMRs by manipulating bacteria in the same wastewater to convert biodegradable pollutants into electricity, thereby eliminating outside inputs. This investigation first determined optimal conditions for an MFC to enable practical applications. Samples of wastewater were taken from three stages at a local wastewater treatment plant: influent, biological reactor, and thickener underflow. The effectiveness of wastewater treatment was established through the colorimetric determination of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD). Pyrex cells served as the base for single-chamber air cathode MFCs, while the electricity generated was measured with a data acquisition system. The MFC output and cost efficiency was thus maximized by varying electrode materials, catalyst loadings, PTFE diffusion layers, inoculant pre-treatment, carbon support materials, and bacterial source (wastewater, C. saccharolyticus). SEM and EDS determined the composition and bacteria present on such electrodes. A maximum voltage of 0.65V was ultimately generated, amounting to a 67% increase in production over cells constructed according to previous literature. COD removal efficiency increased as a function of voltage and indicated that 94.9 ±3% of organic material in the wastewater was removed. The successfully optimized MFC effectively powered a BEAMR in a fully autonomous system requiring only wastewater as fuel, producing 25% hydrogen gas, as measured through thermal conductivity-based GC.

ALGAE AS A BIOFUEL, PART II
Daisuke Dennis Takeda
Newman Smith High School, Carrollton, TX

Algae began to gain world recognition for its potential usage as an alternative energy source after the US Department of Energy launched the aquatic species program. After last year’s experimentation, I conducted further research to improve my methods to create biodiesel from algae. The question that came to mind was “How can I improve and enhance the biodiesel quantity extracted from the algae while minimizing the energy budget?” The purpose of the experiment was to improve the way biodiesel is extracted from algae. My hypothesis is that sonication and/or microwaving combined with manual grinding the algae will increase the production of biodiesel.<br><br>A photobioreactor setup was used. The Chlorella protothecoids sample was used. Water was evaporated through heating. After grounding, the algae was mixed with hexane and allowed to sit for 24 hours. Then, the algae was placed in the microwave for 3 minutes with 3 minute intervals of cooling period to cause more cell disruption. The microwaving process was repeated 4 times. Another mixture of algae went through a sonication process to cause further cell disruption. The algae was then mixed with a sodium hydroxide-methanol solution to cause transesterification. The biodiesel was then separated from the solution by using a separatory funnel. <br><br>The results support the hypothesis. By using a gas chromatagraph, the results of the biodiesel provided a conclusive similarity to octane. Lipid extraction methods, microwave and sonication, were compared. The results give promise for the farming of algae as an alternative energy source.

THE ANSWER MY FRIEND IS BLOWIN’ IN THE WIND: DETERMINING ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF WINDMILL BLADES
Ashlie R. Tull
Muskogee High School, Muskogee, OK

I chose this project because I have always been interested in wind energy. When doing this experiment I predicted in my hypothesis that the round edge blade would produce the most energy. I built a mini module of a wind turbine and used a box fan as a wind tunnel. I set up my work area and then tested each fan for twenty seconds. I made four different shapes out of a plastic material and then recorded my results on a graph. In the end the round edge blade worked the best out of the other three. If I were to do my experiment again, then I would test different types of material with the round edge blade shape.

EFFECT OF VARIOUS METAL COFACTORS ON THE CATALYZATION RATE OF PYRUVATE TO ETHANOL BY PYRUVATE DECARBOXYLASE (EC 4.1.1.1) IN SACCHARAROMYCES CERVISIAE WHEN THIAMINE PYROPHOSPHATE (TPP) IS ABSENT
Arrush Choudhary
Chantilly High School, Chantilly, VA

This experiment aims to improve the cost effectiveness of the ethanol synthesis process. In order to do so, the researcher studied pyruvate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.1), an enzyme essential to ethanol fermentation in S.cerevisiae. The researcher experimented to see what cofactors would work best to enhance the function of the enzyme when thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), an expensive cofactor that scientists claim is necessary for the enzyme’s function, is absent.<br><br> In order to measure the amount of product created by the enzymatic reaction, the researcher monitored the rate at which CO2 was produced. In order to do this, the researcher directly measured the pH change that resulted from the formation of carbonic acid. A pH decrease was anticipated as the result of the enzymatic reaction.<br><br> Ultimately, the results supported the hypothesis. When the magnesium or manganese cofactors were used, the pH did indeed decrease. This pH decrease was also seen in the calcium cofactor. This means that these three cofactors allowed the enzyme to work properly.<br><br>In contrast, when copper and iron were used, the pH of the distilled water increased, meaning that the enzyme did not function properly. Because pyruvate decarboxylase was not able to process pyruvate, one would expect a stable pH, but instead a pH increase was seen. The researcher attributed this pH increase to gelatin being processed by the enzyme rather than pyruvate and producing a basic gas. Ultimately, the researcher discovered that despite the absence of TPP, the pyruvate decarboxylase enzyme still functions properly.

TESTING THE SHAPE OF ROCKET FINS ON A SPINNING ROCKET
Aaron Blake Shepperd
Hart County High School, Munfordville, KY

In my previous year's project, I determined that using a simple airfoil was the best method for increasing performance of a rocket. My next goal was to maximize the benefits from this spin by testing the different shapes of fins with spin induced by the method of airfoiling.<br><br> <br><br>Using a three-axis accelerometer, I tested the efficiency of three different shapes of rocket fins (straight, clipped delta, and trapezoidal) on an identical fin can and upper airframe. I launched each rocket twice and analyzed all data received from the accelerometers against one another to determine which rocket had the smallest change in acceleration in the x- and z-axes. This allowed me to determine which set of fins created the most stable flight for a rocket during spin.

COUPLING A SOLAR PANEL WITH TWO PEM FUEL CELLS TO POWER A SMALL MODEL CAR DURING PERIODS OF SUNSHINE AND NON-SUNSHINE AS AN ALTERNATIVE FOR THE GASOLINE POWERED COMBUSTION ENGINE
Ryan Linden Hatch
Spring Creek High School, Spring Creek, NV

The shortage of oil in the world has caused a new spike in the public interest for a new energy source. Solar energy is efficient but lacks stability and hydrogen is common but is volatile. In order to combine their efficiency and stability two PEM fuel cells were coupled with a solar panel to perform the three processes necessary to use solar and hydrogen energy simultaneously to run a model car. These processes are collecting energy from the sun, hydrolysis, and using the gases separated in hydrolysis to power the car. The result of this project were that a 3 volt solar panel could produce enough electricity to create a surplus of hydrogen gas, this suggests that the car could run in the shade for as long as the gas tanks would allow and then refill the tanks while driving in the sun.

This detonation would happen in fragments of a second, increasing the pressure inside the chamber at an output as that of gasoline, due to the occurrence of an explosion rather than a reaction. A special injector was created to remedy the complication of the solid state of NI3, made of pistons that push NI3 into the chamber and seal the opening with synergy with the strokes. Then the Iodine exhaust is sublimed and stored inside the vehicle to be re-used in producing NI3, as it is a product of Ammonia and iodine.<br><br>The tests have shown that NI3 is renewable, efficient and environmentally friendly as it costs half the price of gasoline.

The purpose of this experiment is to compare the difference between petroleum diesel fuel and Biodiesel to determine which type of fuel burns the most efficiently, releases the least amount of particulate matter, and which fuel is the most dollar efficient. The fuels that were tested are number one, number two, one hundred percent biodiesel, twenty percent biodiesel, and five percent biodiesel. Each fuel was ran through a one cylinder diesel engine once before the test fuels were injected into the fuel line; 60 mL of each fuel was ran through a 70 mL syringe to determine the efficiency. The particulate matter released was ran down through water in a 2.4 meter long flex pipe to cool the exhaust and capture the particulate matter, the filter will be weighed before and after to determine the total amount of particulate matter released. The procedure is as follows; I injected 60mL of fuel through a 70mL syringe which was hooked to the fuel line. (Running the engine out of fuel will allow air to get into the fuel line and therefore the engine will not start again without loosening the fuel line by the injector and turning the engine over forcing the air out of the fuel lines.) When switching fuel’s the test fuel was ran through the engine twice before the test results were recorded. Each time a test fuel was ran exhaust flew through a 2.4 meter long flex pipe and down through water to cool the exhaust so it could be captured in a filter and weighed to determine the total amount of particulate matter released. Each fuel followed this exact procedure to determine the efficiency and amount of particulate matter released. From my experiments I concluded that my hypothesis was both correct and incorrect. The B20 biodiesel which is a 80 percent solution of diesel fuel but still had many soy diesel properties, and at 115cents a liter this was the third most fuel efficient fuel at a average time of 553.09 seconds on 60 mL of fuel, and the second cleanest burning fuel releasing a average of 0.3 grams of particulate matter. The B100 soy diesel was the cleanest burning fuel releasing an average of 0.1 gram (this was apparent that this was a clean burning fuel by just looking at the appearance of the filter). The soy diesel was not the most efficient fuel (because of the lack of energy at 35,135 British thermal units per Liter). It burned at an average of 468.01 seconds on the 60 mL of fuel, and at 0.68 cents a liter. The efficiency per dollar was calculated by usin

ANALYSIS OF CONDUCTING POLYMER PEDOT (POLY (3,4-ETHYLENEDIOXYTHIOPHENE)) AND NANOSTRUCTURED TITANIA FOR SOLID-STATE DYE-SENSITIZED SOLAR CELLS
Akshai Baskaran
Kennewick High School, WA, WA

Dye-sensitized solar cells are a potentially inexpensive alternative to conventional inorganic solar cell technology. This project examined PEDOT, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), as a potential solid state electrolyte or electron-hole transport material (HTM) to improve the durability and efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells. Critical electrical and physical properties – transverse and bulk conductivity, potential energy level, as well as deposition thickness, morphology and uniformity – were evaluated. The results indicated that a chemical vapor deposition method was much more effective than the conventional electrochemical technique for PEDOT deposition, resulting in a more uniform and conductive HTM compared to existing HTM’s. Nanostructured titania, which can assist the charge transfer in the cell, was also examined in two forms, nanotubes and nanoparticles. The results demonstrated that these titania structures have similar characteristics, both being capable of producing adequately high voltage in a cell using PEDOT as the HTM, but the cell produced abnormally low currents likely due to ther resistive components. Overall, PEDOT’s structure, morphology and conductivity confirmed its potential as a viable solid state HTM for dye-sensitized solar cells.

The purpose of this research is to determine the feasibility of solar-powered pyrolysis. In order to produce an entirely carbon-neutral or even carbon-negative fuel source, the energy to power a pyrolysis system must come from a renewable energy source. Using the sun as a source of power to break biomass into components which can be further refined into biofuels would eliminate the need for electricity. I believe that solar-powered pyrolysis is feasible using concentrated solar energy.<br><br>For the pyrolysis process the paper was weighed then placed inside a test tube, which was then inverted at 45 degrees. The propane torch was weighed then used to power the process. Thermal degradation commenced and the liquid product collected in a test tube. The torch was weighed after. This process was performed using proper safety. For the distillation process the product was heated and allowed to distill out. The calorimetry process was performed using traditional procedure and safety.<br><br>A total of 388.35 BTU was needed to convert 12.0g of paper into 1.9g of pyrolysis oils. From the distillation of 2.0g of pyrolysis oils, 0.2mL of distillate was collected. The calorimetry determined that the pyrolysis oil released 13.08BTU. The total energy required to collect 0.2mL of distillate from the pyrolysis process to the distillation process was 3001.91BTU.1.9g of the crude pyrolysis oil produced 13.11BTU. The entire process used 3001.91BTU.<br><br>The results show that solar-powered pyrolysis and carbon-negative alternative fuel are feasible.

SAFETY OR SAVINGS? WASHOUT DESIGNS IN AN AIRPLANE WING CONSIDERING INDUCED DRAG
Stacey A Huang
Evergreen Valley High School, San Jose, CA

Stalling occurs in aircraft when the plane is flying at too high of an angle of attack and the wing can no longer continue to produce lift due to flow separation. A stall can lead to adverse effects such as spinning and deep stall; it is important to consider that accidents due to stalls are the one of the most fatal types of accident in aviation, especially in general aviation aircraft. The purpose of this experiment was to discover the effect of washout (geometric twist) on the safety characteristics of an airplane while considering the efficieny of the plane. Five physical wings with geometric twists of 3, 0, -3, -6, and -9 degrees were fashioned. For part one of the experiment, flow was modeled by injecting dye on the trailing edge of the wings in a water tunnel. For part two of the experiment, a theoretical study was performed using the computer program LinAir to derive stability characteristics (quantified in pitching moment) in addition to obtaining drag data for a theoretical study of wings with washout 16 to -16 degrees. Overall, there it was observed that with greater implementation of washout wings would be safer and more stable. However, the geomteric twist producing the least induced drag was -1 degrees, which may not be enough to derive the full effect of safety benefits. It was therefore concluded that it may be beneficial to increase washout in order to gain safety benefits and reduce the fatality of stall accidents because the efficieny penalty is relatively small. Application and relevance of this experiment applies to the aviation industry, in the interest of making commercial, private, and even small-scale model flight more stable and safe. In addition, the supermaneuverable demands of military aircraft which fly at high angles of attack require a solid aerodynamic basis in the form of wings which do not exhibit unfavorable stall characteristics.

ALTERNATIVE ENERGY
Joseph Michael Wilder
Academy of Environmental Science, Crystal River, FL

Have you ever wondered if there is an alternative source of energy then the gasoline we are addicted to? This study was conducted in order to evaluate if the vapors from splitting water molecules can be used as energy to fuel a combustion engine. This system was created by using stainless steel rods inside a jar and running electricity to each. The testing of two different combustion engines showed that the vapors from splitting water molecules can be used as energy to fuel a combustion engine. In all ten tests, the water vapors by themselves were consistently more efficient. These results show that we are no longer dependent on petroleum products and now have an efficient way to run our vehicles. I went from an average of 28 mpg to 41 mpg. From this point I am going to convert my vehicles to water and I would like to try and improve human awareness and reduce the dependency on fossil fuels. Oil is a resource in crisis! There has been a steep spike in oil prices over the last few years. They have been on the upwards of $4.50 a gallon for gas. With the recent British Petroleum oil spill, humans can not afford to confide in fossil fuels. It is time to take the next step and look into an Alternative Energy.

Weber High School, Pleasant View, UT

This experiment attempts to determine the impact of water as a medium for cooling a solar panel to positively impact the production of the panel’s output power. By controlling the temperature of the panel, the output power can be controlled due to the electrical properties of the semiconductor material that makes up the solar cell. The lower the temperature of the semiconductor crystal structure, the higher the electric current is generated at a given voltage.<br><br>In order to control the panel temperature, various temperatures of water were sprayed onto each side of the panel. The water temperatures used included 12C, 23C, and 34C. As the panel temperature decreased, the panel temperature and the voltage across the resistor were recorded. The voltage was then applied to Ohm’s Law to calculate the power.<br><br>The data received showed that applying water to the back of the panel provided 240mW more power than spraying water to the panel’s front at a water temperature of 12C. Given this result, the remaining tests were executed by applying water to the back of the panel. With water at 12C, the power increased by 530mW. At a water temperature of 23C, the power increased by 600mW. With water at 34C, the panel output produced an additional 390mW.<br><br>The results of this experiment demonstrate that water at both hot and cold temperatures could reduce the panel temperature. In conclusion, water can be an effective medium for decreasing the temperature of a solar panel, thereby increasing the output power produced.

GENERATION OF ELECTRICITY FROM OCEAN WAVE OSCILLATION
Jessica Kelsey James
Weber High School, Pleasantview, UT

The world needs a source of energy that can be generated continuously without harming the environment. Currently, solar panels and wind turbines are the most common way to harness renewable energy; however wind turbines and solar panels are intermittent energy producers. The purpose of this project was to create a device that could harness the continuous energy of the ocean with minimal impact on marine life. The device does not produce toxic by-products, create high pitched noises or have any underwater turbine blades that would be harmful to marine life. The device is able to produce electricity not only from the ocean, but from the wind and the sun as well. The project was tested in simulated wave action by utilizing a dunk tank and creating waves. The device utilizes seven magnet shafts (each magnet shaft is comprised of copper coils in which magnets are moved through creating electricity.) A volt meter and a resistor were placed on each coil, using Ohm’s law the watts were calculated. On average per wave per coil the device can produce 54.9 millivolts and .33 watts. There are seven coils per device and are capable of working continuously with the wave action. Although the energy production is small it works as a trickle charger like other renewable energy sources. An enlarged version of this device could potentially supply electricity to the power distribution grid.

PARABOLIC, HAZARD-LIMITED, COLLAPSING SOLAR STIRLING INSOLATION COLLECTOR
Cory Nicholson Owan
Catalina Foothills High School, Tucson, AZ

A compound parabolic mirror system is introduced as a means to provide an eye safe solar insolation magnification beam directed to a region that is not visible. The approach consists of two open symmetric parabolic mirrors that face each other. The primary mirror (collector) has a central hole through which the beam is allowed to pass. The secondary mirror (focuser) captures the focused beam from the collector and directs it through the central hole. Once the radiant energy (insolation) is focused behind the collector, it can be covered such that where the beam contacts the surface of interest, it is not visible. The parabolic reflectors must be of a matched design. Measurement of a small test system identifies that the method is practical. Although the collection system efficiency was approximately 50%, improvements to the surface quality should allow substantially higher performance.

THE EFFECT OF WINGLET ANGLE ON THE INDUCED DRAG OF AN AIRPLANE
Taylor Mason Hose
Hedgesville High School, Hedgesville, WV

As the cost of fuel continues to rise, ways to reduce the cost of flight are crucial. Research is ongoing for designs to build airplanes that are more safe and affordable. The addition of winglets to the tip of an airplane's wing, to reduce wingtip vortices, has shown to reduce induced drag. Decreasing the drag of an airplane leads to less fuel utilization during a flight. This experiment investigated which winglet angle could reduce induced drag the greatest, with the study proposing a 15-degree, from vertical, angle producing the least. The majority of prior testing examined winglet shape.<br><br> To conduct the experiment, an open circuit wind tunnel was constructed and linked to a computer based data gathering system. Eight different elliptical winglets were independently tested in the wind tunnel, along with a wing containing no winglet. The cant angles tested were 0, 15, 20 ,25, 45, 135, 180, and 315-degree from vertical.<br><br> Analysis of the data proved the hypothesis incorrect. Tests proved the 180-degree angle produced the least amount of drag. The results of an analysis of variance proved a statistical difference in the trials. Though the hypothesis was proven incorrect, a wing with a winglet was shown to statistically reduce the induced drag.

SYNTHESIZING HYDROCARBON DERIVATIVES AS AN ALTERNATIVE FUEL SOURCE UTILIZING EFFLUENT GAS FROM A CATALYTIC CONVERTER IN A TWO STAGE INDUCTION SYSTEM WITH COBALT MOLYBDENUM COPPER IN A HYDRODESULPHURIZATION PROCESS TO REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS
Justin Kenrick Ramsaran
Palm Bay High School, Melbourne, FL

This study utilized scientific techniques and engineering principles to systematically create a prototype energy system. This project is intended to explore and develop an alternative energy system which effectively utilizes effluent gas (coal gas), in combination with the coal by-product, and denatured ethanal. Several techniques were developed in order to design and create a pilot system which operated autonomously. The reason for this experiment is to create a synthetic liquid hydrocarbon to circumvent the over usage of fossil fuels. The following engineering goals were implemented to establish this system: connect the hydrogen system using effluent gas from catalytic converter; create “clean coal” by using coal byproduct in a hydrodesulphurization process; test untreated and treated aqueous liquor with saturated effluent gas in cobalt molybdenum copper environment to see if hydrocarbon derivatives were synthesized; extract pure liquid BTX out of aqueous liquor; combine liquid BTX with denatured ethanol; test for liquid hydrocarbons; test treated and integrate all three products: effluent gas, BTX, and denatured ethanol; and test BTU content and calorific value of liquid hydrocarbon. All but one of the engineering goals were achieved successfully. The synthetic liquid hydrocarbon has been synthesized and the theory behind utilizing effluent gas was supported by the data and experimentation. The catalytic converter design was put through rigorous testing in order to test the efficiency versus a standard catalytic converter. The unachievable engineering goal was that the catalytic converter design was not put through rigorous enough testing. Neither the emissions nor knocking test were completed due to time constraints.

THE FUTURE FUEL
Brady Mark Holst
Southeastern High School, Augusta, IL

Purpose: The purpose of this project is to find a less expensive alternative to biodiesel by adding gasoline to vegetable oil made from sunflowers. Tests include two fuel efficiency tests, cost analysis, viscosity analysis, emissions, and injector tests. <br><br>Procedures: Sunflowers were grown, pressed, and filtered. Six parts oil was added to one part gasoline. Fuel efficiency was found using a calorimeter. The BTUs of 1/2 gram of fuel was found. Fuel efficiency was found by measuring the amount of fuel burned after one minute in an engine. Viscosity was measured by finding the time a ball takes to move through each fuel. Fifty trials were conducted for these tests Injectors were tested with a test stand. Emissions were measured using an emissions tester. The price for each fuel was found.<br><br>Conclusion: Results showed that B100 had the highest BTU value, and vegetable oil had the lowest. Gasoline improved the vegetable oil, making it third, and diesel was second. B100 was the least viscous fuel, and vegetable oil was found to be the most. Gasoline added to the vegetable oil decreased the viscosity. B100 was found to be the most efficient fuel when burned in an engine, but diesel was comparable. Gasoline did improve the efficiency of oil. B100 was found to have the best emissions. Diesel had the worst. The oil with gas was concluded to be the second best fuel, and the vegetable oil was third. The injectors test had the same psi. The best fuel was B100. Diesel and oil with gas were both comparable, second. My hypothesis was proven correct.

CHARACTERIZING THE OPTIMAL FLIGHT TIME OF A UAV HELICOPTER: AN ODYSSEY THROUGH NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS
Kevin Taihao Tang
Stevenson School, Pebble Beach, CA

This project deals with optimizing the flight operation of a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) helicopter. I intended to characterize the optimized minimum flight time to hover between two end points. My goal was to develop a relationship for estimating the minimum flight time without using the complicated optimization method. I used an optimization program, a UAV helicopter model, and MATLAB for simulation and data analyses in this project. The optimization program applied to the nonlinear helicopter model resulted in a solution optimized for minimum flight time for two given end points. In this process, initial guesses of controls and state variables were locally optimized. I obtained solutions for various distances between endpoints. I analyzed these results and established an empirical relationship between the minimum flight time and the distance using least square linear regression method. I validated this relationship using independent samples from the full optimization process. I further examined the effects of the number of nodes in the optimization process on my results. I found that the optimal flight time is best described as a linear function of the distance even though the optimized flight trajectory is rather complicated. My regression results show very small bias and standard error when compared to the full optimization solutions. The function is also applicable over an extended range of distances. The number of nodes may change the flight trajectories, but it does not significantly affect the total flight time. Thus, the empirical solution can be considered accurate and robust.

TURBULENT AIR FLOW AND ITS EFFECTS ON HELMET DRAG
Lexie Kae Buchs
DeKalb High School, Waterloo, IN

This experiment will determine if, and to what extent, drag force is reduced when dimples are placed on protective helmets. I believe dimples on helmets will decrease the Laminar flow and increase the turbulent flow around the helmet. This will in effect, cause there to be at least 10 percent less drag pressure on the helmet from air flow. One motor cross helmet covered with 1/4th inch of Plasticize Clay was mounted inside a wind tunnel. Wind speeds ranging from 25 to 75 mph in 10 mph increments were adjusted and 100 readings per second were taken for 20 seconds per trial. Constants were volume, form, and weight of the helmet, placement of the helmet, type, and amount of clay coating the helmet. The 6mm dimpled helmet surface created 12.3% less drag at 25 mph wind velocity than the smooth surfaces helmet. The drag force was not lower with dimples at wind speeds of 45 to 55 mph. At 75mph wind speed the smooth surface had 14.8% less drag than dimpled surfaces. My results show that the 6, 12, and 15mm dimples reduced drag at velocities that are below the critical Reynolds Number range. This decrease in drag is not significant enough for motor cross helmet companies to produce dimpled helmets because at speeds higher than 45 mph, the dimples show a negative effect by causing excessive turbulence and excessive drag. My hypothesis was correct at Reynolds Numbers lower than 4E5 but proven incorrect at Reynolds Numbers higher than that critical range.

RECORD NUMBER OF LIGHT ABSORPTION ENHANCEMENT IMPROVING PERFORMANCE OF SOLAR CELLS BY STRAINING SI
Kinga J. Malkinska
Benjamin Franklin High School, New Orleans, LA

Limited natural resources and pollution sparked increasing interest in solar energy. In order to make solar energy a part of our life, the efficiency of solar cells must be improved. Silicon is a good candidate to dominate future market of solar cells because it is inexpensive, ecologically safe and its technology is already well established. A new method is proposed and tested in this project to improve the performance of Si cells. This new approach takes advantage of the relation between strain and optical properties of Si. It is hypothesized that the change of interatomic distances in strained Si may increase absorption of light by Si, which is beneficiary for solar cell applications. The effect of tensile and compressive strains due to bending of Si wafers was investigated in the spectral range from 300 to 1100 nm using reflective spectroscopy. The experimental results showed that optical properties of Si were significantly changed by the strains. Theses changes were varying with the wavelength. Maximum reduction of absorption of 57% due to 0.45% compression of the absorbing layer of Si occurred in the wavelength range between 300 and 500 nm. In contrast, tensile strains of 0.75% enhanced absorption up to 113% of the value for the unstrained Si, which is a record. The total absorption in the whole spectral range was found to decrease by 2.9 % due to compression and increase by 6% due to tensile strains. These results confirmed my hypothesis that strains can be used to improve efficiency of silicon-based solar cells. Fabrication of solar cells from strained Si in combination with antireflection coatings may lead to almost 100 % absorption of sunlight light by solar cells.

HARVESTING WAVE ENERGY USING A FULL SCALE PIEZO BUOY
Garrett Lee Moler
Sarasota High School, Sarasota, FL

This project looked at the ability of a piezo actuator to efficiently harvest ocean wave energy in a buoy. Wave energy is a promising energy resource and waves provide advantages for the harvesting of energy. Previous research conducted by the researcher concluded that piezo actuators can harvest more energy in a buoy than an electromagnetic generator. The purpose of this research was to determine if a full scale wave energy harvesting buoy using a piezo actuator would harvest a higher watt to volume ratio than a comparable electromagnetic generator buoy. It was hypothesized that the full scale piezo buoy will harvest a higher power to volume ratio than an electromagnetic generator due to the piezo’s fewer moving parts and the molecular change in crystal structure generating electrical charge. The researcher constructed a 25.4 cm diameter by 30.5 cm PVC buoy utilizing 4 Viva 2 actuators mounted on a plate in the center of the buoy that were actuated by a rod inserted through the buoy using two ceramic bushings. Results showed a full scale piezo buoy to be capable of harvesting 3.53X10-4 watts per cubic centimeter while the electromagnetic generator buoy, constructed by a team of researchers at Oregon State University, was capable of harvesting 1.66X10-4 watts per cubic centimeter. The piezo buoy was tested in natural conditions, displaying an average peak power of 4.88 watts. The hypothesis was validated; a full scale piezo buoy will harvest a 112% higher power to volume ratio than a comparable electromagnetic generator buoy.

HYDROLIZE: KINETICS OF THE HYDROGEN PRODUCTION OF THE MAGNESIUM-WATER REACTION IN AQUEOUS SOLUTION
Tyler Trettel Howard
Olathe Northwest High School, Olathe, KS

As an alternative energy, the magnesium water (Mg-H2O) reaction generates H2 gas and shows promise as an energy carrier. An understanding of this reaction was developed through a three phase experiment: Mg passivation layer dissolution, Mg-H2O reaction kinetics, and Mg-H2O reaction type of gas analysis. The first phase investigated percent dissolved of MgO and Mg(OH)2 after 30. minutes in environmentally benign 1.00 M NaH2PO4, NH4H2PO4, NH4Cl, citric acid, and L-ascorbic acid solutions. The second phase measured the H2 volume, temperature, and pH of the Mg-H2O reaction using the same solutions at 1.00, 2.00, and 3.00 M. The third phase analyzed Mg-H2O reaction gas samples with FTIR to ascertain the types of gasses being produced. For the first phase, citric acid and L-ascorbic acid solutions were capable of nearly completely dissolving MgO and Mg(OH)2, while NaH2PO4 and NH4H2PO4 increased the solids' masses. Appropriately, the second phase reaction rate data shows, to a 99% statistical confidence, that citric acid produced the most moles of H2, followed closely by L-ascorbic acid and NH4Cl due to their acidity. These two salts were fit with exponential mathematical models to allow for interpolations and extrapolations of the data. The third phase FTIR results suggested that NH4Cl produced approximately 2.7% volume of NH3 gas alongside H2 gas. Because the first and third phase data support the mathematical models of the second phase, it is possible to fully optimize the H2 production of the Mg-H2O reaction to create a sustainable energy carrier.

UTILIZING THE ENERGY IN WIND TO POWER VEHICLES
Nicole Elizabeth Hunter
Macomb High School, Macomb, IL

The purpose of this study is to determine if the wind passing over a vehicle can turn a wind turbine to produce an electrical output to aid in powering the vehicle. It is hypothesized that if a horizontal-axis wind turbine were to be placed onto a vehicle then the wind around the vehicle, either stationary or mobile, would be enough to spin the blades with adequate torque that a sufficient amount of power would be produced to aid in the running of the vehicle. <br><br>To test the hypothesis four tests were run. During all of the tests, a wind tunnel’s motor was set to various frequencies in order to vary and control the wind speeds over the wind turbine. The wind turbines electrical output was measured in test two and compared to the wind speeds that were recorded during test one. During test three, the wind turbine was directly wired to a battery and the change in voltage in the battery over ten minutes was recorded. During the fourth test, the wind turbine was set at various angles to the wind tunnel and the electrical output was recorded.<br><br>From the data collected, the hypothesis, if a wind turbine were to be placed onto a vehicle then the wind around the vehicle, would be enough to spin the turbine blades producing a sufficient amount of power to aid in the running of the vehicle, was supported. Although more testing is needed to determine whether the drag created would be an issue.

NATURAL SELECTION

The purpose of my experiment was to determine if improvements could be made to the three most common airfoils in use today. I tested the impacts of modifying the leading edge to resemble the flipper of a humpback whale, as well as the dimples of a golf ball applied over the entire wing. To do this, I cut nine wings out of insulation board and modified them into wing profiles, which included supersonic, thin chord, and thick chord. Three were used as controls, another three had dimples, and the final three had the flipper-like leading edge. They were tested in a wind tunnel by two parameters; lift and drag. Lift was measured by a scale and drag was measured by a force gauge. The wings were tested at three different wind speeds and four different angles. The speeds were ten, fourteen, and eighteen miles per hour. The angles were zero, ten, twenty, and thirty degrees. The designs were rated by how they performed against the control of their type. The supersonic wing suffered, but the other two had mixed results. The thin chord with dimples, built for speed, decreased drag but decreased lift, while the thick chord with the flipper-like leading edge, built for lift, did the opposite. In conclusion, the modifications had a few more cons then pros, but were able to improve the main areas of two of my designs.

REDUCING THE CUT-IN WIND SPEED OF WIND TURBINE BLADES BY REDIRECTING THE BOUNDARY LAYER AIRFLOWS
Lauren Heather Reid
O'Neill Collegiate and Vocational Institute, Oshawa, Ontario, CANADA

Wind turbines require a cut-in wind speed that is higher than the natural median wind speed found in most areas and, as a result, are idle 65% of the time. This research involved the design and testing of three blade modifications – stagnation point parafoil, coanda tubes and vortex generators – to determine which would be most effective in lowering the cut-in wind speed without compromising performance at higher wind speeds. Testing was completed in three stages: prototype, wind tunnel and generator. Using six wind tunnel models, 96 separate airflow observations were made and the airflow speed and direction were measured precisely at 960 measurement volumes. The cut-in wind speeds, and the amount of electricity generated using wind speeds ranging from 18.6 to 3.1 km/h, were recorded for each blade. Data comparisons, videos, vector plots, and t-tests demonstrated that the parafoils and coanda tubes improved the performance of the turbine blade as compared to the standard control. One blade in particular, the ‘open’ parafoil with 2 rows of coanda tubes, performed better than any other. With this model, the cut-in wind speed was reduced by 75% to 3.5 km/h, and generated 226% more electricity than the standard control. Open parafoil turbine blades with 2 rows of coanda tubes have the potential to generate electricity in all median wind speeds. With these modifications, wind turbines could operate effectively in almost any region of the world, and less energy would be required from other sources, resulting in significant carbon emission reductions.

Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) demonstrate eventual economic and environmental feasibility within the hydrogen energy infrastructure. Hydrodynamic modulation in rotating ring disk electrodes (RRDEs) is a route to evaluate reduction reaction mechanisms and intermediate peroxides that currently constrain the viability of PEMFCs. This research involved the hydrodynamic voltammetry and spectroscopy of a novel photocatalytic enhancement of PEMFCs, a photonic concept inspired from photodynamic cancer therapy. High-energy antibonding orbitals and the electrophilic nature of photoactivated singlet oxygen upon irradiation minimized RRDE activation losses by weakening diatomic oxygen bonds.<br><br> <br><br>Photocatalysts were sensitized onto glassy carbon nanoparticles of RRDEs by a sonochemical route and evaluated via thermogravimetric analysis. Capacitance and Nyquist plots derived from impedance spectroscopy indicated enhancements in catalytic surface energies, limiting capacitance and ohmic overpotential. Cyclic and linear-sweep voltammograms and Koutecky-Levich plots displayed enhancements in kinetic current that were mathematically modelled using an exponential function. Novel photosensitive nanostructured titanium dioxide support materials, spectroscopic filters, transparent indium tin oxide electrodes and ternary alloys were characterized with hydrodynamic RRDEs and proven feasible for integration with photocatalysts.<br><br> <br><br>A newplatinum copper manganese ternary photocatalyst alloy was identified that displays 93.41% photocatalytic enhancement and performances 62.88% superior to previously studied catalysts. These inexpensive environmentally sustainable photocatalytic PEMFCs can alleviate humanity’s dependence on unsustainable energy and accommodate growing energy demands.

CONSTRUCTION OF CRYSTALLINE METAL ORGANIC FRAMEWORKS (MOFS) USING COORDINATION BONDS BETWEEN ORGANIC LIGANDS AND METAL IONS AS A POTENTIAL HYDROGEN FUELS STORAGE MATRIX
Brian Tung
The Bronx High School of Science, Bronx, NY

The danger and inefficiency of current technology for hydrogen fuel storage poses a major problem for advancement in commercial use of these fuels. Hydrogen, an extremely volatile and combustible gas, is currently stored in cryogenic tanks which have a tendency to explode and requires 40-50% energy input to effectively create hydrogen from liquid water. The purpose of this project was to model and construct porous materials using Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) as a means of encapsulating ‘guest’ molecules such as hydrogen gas. A promising approach to create these materials was investigated using advanced software to predict and model porous structures. Aspects of MOF-5 were also incorporated in the study. The chemicals required to construct the porous materials were fully dissolved and placed in a Parr Bomb container undergoing immense pressure and heat. Heavy utilization of metal atoms, organic ligands, and bipyridine system connected to carboxylic acids resulted in porous crystals. Crystallization of materials resulted in a crystalline structure that underwent characterization through x-ray diffraction, pore visualization, and thermal stability. The single x-ray diffraction depicted a diffraction that suggested a crystal with pores, as validated by the solving of the crystal. Using stress by increasing the temperature from 22 to 600°C, allowed guest molecules to escape, revealing the pore diameter of approximately 1nm. The pores of the crystal exhibited channels that are akin to fitting hydrogen gas into a tube. Ultimately, the crystal structure has potential in gas adsorption as well as encapsulating guests, providing an innovative path for future research.

A NOVEL BIOFUEL CELL BASED ON DIRECT ELECTRON TRANSFER-TYPE BIOELECTROCATALYSIS INCORPORATING PHOTOPHOSPHORYLATION TO EFFICIENTLY CREATE SUSTAINABLE ELECTRICAL ENERGY
Nathan Sai Kondamuri
Munster High School, Munster, IN

As early as the 1980s, ambitious designs for enzyme-based biofuel cells were aimed at developing “green” sources of electrical energy. However, because the power densities of biofuel cells were at least 1000-fold lower than those of conventional generators, the cells did not succeed in their intended applications. In phase 1 of my research, I report on the fabrication of a direct electron transfer-based fructose/O2 biofuel cell. Fructose Dehydrogenase and Bilirubin Oxidase were used as anodic and cathodic bioelements. In phase 2, I constructed a micro-scale biofuel cell to determine factors that affected the cell’s efficiency. By controlling variables such as distance between and surface area of the electrodes, temperature, pH and flow ratio of substrates within the cell and by calculating current and power densities, optimal conditions were achieved. Chloroplasts were introduced in Phase 3 as the anodic bioelement to test whether the biological interaction, photophosphorylation, can be mimicked to produce power. I have created a novel fuel cell that harvests light energy and utilizes photophosphorylation to efficiently transform light energy into electrical energy. This fuel cell offers an environmentally friendly, sustainable energy solution to the global energy demand problem. Also, my data plotting wavelength of light shined on the fuel cell vs. voltage output measured suggests that I may have discovered a previously unreported pigment that could be contributing to absorption of light and the overall process of photophosphorylation. Due to this fuel cell’s increased efficiency, several realistic applications for the delivery of sustainable electrical energy become possible.

LIGHTNING IN A BOTTLE, PHASE 1
Caleb George Gestes
John Curtis Christian School, River Ridge, LA

Lightning is the most powerful force on earth. It can reach over 300,000 volts and is hotter than the surface of the sun. It strikes anywhere at anytime in any place and is one of the last natural resources on this earth that we have not utilized for our energy needs. It’s dangerous, unpredictable, and powerful beyond belief; but it is a jackpot of energy we can not pass by. This project is my first steps to working to solve this dilemma and to take use of the power. An average bolt of negative lightning carries a current of 30 kiloamperes, transfers a charge of 5 coulombs, has a potential difference of about 100 megavolts and dissipates 500 megajoules (enough to light a 100 watt light bulb for 2 months). There 16 million lightning storms in the world every year, and the energy released in just one of these storms is enough to give the entire U.S. power for 20 minutes. As you can see, this is just too much power for us to pass by, especially when we are in such a need of clean efficient energies. I believe a Leyden jar type design is the best way to go about capturing lightning. So in this project I explore the different designs of Leyden jars and which one is most efficient. I used a Van de Graff generator to charge the jars, due to the great similarities between static electricity and lightning. My results showed, in fact, that the first design ever built was the most efficient, which actually rejected my hypothesis. However there are many more details that go into this, so walk through this project with me as we takes steps to the future source of our energy, and explore Lightning in a Bottle.

WAVE POWER PLANT

Despite the fact that nearly 75% of the Earth’s surface is covered with water, waves are a largely unexplored source of energy, compared with the progress that has been made in harnessing the sun and wind. Therefore, development of low cost, efficient and reliable wave power plant is very topical and important for countries with plenty of water surface. Problems, such as low efficiency, complexity of construction, fragility, expensiveness and large consumption of materials of the devices associated with many design patterns of wave power plants were identified and a novel design was suggested. Working principle of the new apparatus is based on the turbine that has flexible blades and is connected through a system of gears to an electric motor. The turbine is placed in a vertical tube which allows only vertical oscillations affect the turbine’s rotation and protects it from harmful mechanical impact. The flexibility of the blades allows the turbine to rotate in the same direction when the water goes both up and down. Additionally, on the inner surface of the vertical tube there are troughs that spin the water around the turbine to same direction as the turbine itself and accelerate it. The whole device is connected to a buoy or other floating object via a bar – it enlarges vertical oscillations of the system. Generated electricity is accumulated in battery cells and can be used to power buoys or as autonomous charger, etc.

ENERGY CONSERVATION WITH THERMAL MATERIALS
Steffi Jamise Lopez-Vasquez
Escuela Superior Bethsaida Velazquez Andujar, Ponce, PUERTO RICO

Houses and buildings in Puerto Rico are constructed in cement. Being a tropical island, the houses become extremely hot and it is necessary to use air conditioning. The main energy source in the island is oil and therefore there is great energy consumption. A possible solution to this situation features the combination of alternative materials such as Artocarpus altilis resin, red clay, yellow clay with cement for house and building construction. The hypothesis under study was: If alternative materials such as Artocarpus altilis resin, red clay, yellow clay are used together with cement for the construction of houses in Puerto Rico, then it is expected that there is a reduction in energy consumption which leads to energy conservation. Four small house models were built. One house was covered with yellow clay, the second house was covered with red clay, the third one with Artocarpus altilis resin mixed with cement and the fourth house was covered with cement which was used as the control. Sensors and graphic calculators were used measure temperature inside each house model. The best alternative material was yellow clay because it kept a temperature inside the house of 10 to 12°C less than the cement covered house. The hyphotesis was accepted and it was also found that the materials are cost effective as evidenced by the cost estimates for a real house construction.

How can Solar Energy technology be environment, friendly and time-saving in business?<br><br>Automatic awning operating with solar energy as an example.<br><br>I have noticed that grocers face many problems such as the growing expenses, wasting time and this is due to their use of the traditional manual awning that doesn’t meet any of the environmental safety conditions. For this reason, I thought of inventing an automatic awning which has multiple environmental and dynamic advantages: recyclable, environment-friendly, easy to use, time-saving and inexpensive.<br><br>In spite of all these constraints, I invented and developed this awning that operates with the electricity provided by solar panels and stored in chargeable batteries. It is called automatic because it’s auto-operating. That is to say, when it is sunny, the awning opens by itself (as programed by its user) and vice-versa as the awning closes by itself again, bearing in mind that the user may control the awning manually while using the “manual position”.

The experiment is to determine the factor that affecting the production of optimum voltage in Chromoleana Odorata and brown sugar solution to create an organic battery, a new form of renewable energy source (biomass). Three type of leave had been tested to become the best candidate in developing organic battery, which are Chromoleana Odorata, Mocus Rubra, and Euodi Ridleyi. From the experiment, the best leave to be chosen is Chromoleana Odorata. From the chosen leave, a mass ratio experiment between Chromoleana Odorata and brown sugar been conducted. From the experiment the optimum ratio is 1:1 where its produce 1.2 V. To understand the process that been happening in the organic battery solution, an analyzed with inductively coupled plasma atomic emissions spectrometer (ICPAES) shows that the solution is abundant with ion-ion form elements that helped the production of voltage. For the application, the organic battery can used to recharge and old dry cell battery. As a conclusion, a battery from organic material or biomass energy can be realized and with a continuous experiment and studies, the organic battery will be perfected and greener source energy for the future.

MAXIMIZING ALGAL GROWTH AND LIPID YIELDS THROUGH VARYING IRON3+ CONCENTRATION AND BIOAVAILABILITY: A CONTINUED INVESTIGATION ON FINDING OPTIMAL GROWING CONDITIONS FOR SCENEDESMUS SP. FOR BIOFUEL PRODUCTION
Yanqi Chen
Central York High School, York, PA

While algal biofuels have been gaining global attention as a promising energy alternative to fossil fuels, many insights still need to be developed on how to grow algae effectively so that biofuels can become economically feasible. This project attempts to pinpoint the optimal iron3+ concentrations as well as bioavailabilities to maximize the growth and lipid development efficiency of a strain of microalgae with previously identified high lipid yields known as Scenedesmus sp. <br><br> Quantitative data for biomass and lipid evaluation were collected through fluorometric and gravimetric means. For gravimetric biomass evaluation, algae was harvested through GFF filtration. For gravimetric lipid evaluation, lipids were extracted with a cyclohexane-isopropyl alcohol solvent. <br><br> My project determined that there exists a strong parabolic correlation between the logarithm of iron concentration and overall algal growth. Through this correlation it is estimated that 0.0007ppm iron3+ concentration could yield maximum algal growth. This project also determined that at the lower two concentrations, an increase in bioavailability hindered algal growth, while at the higher two concentrations, bioavailability played no role in growth. This means that if controlled properly, bioavailability of a growth medium has great potential to improve algal biofuels. Lastly and most excitingly, the results of my project indicate the existence of a subspecies of Scenedesmus sp. which possesses a tremendously high natural lipid yield (~55% as compared to the 25% lipid yields of the aggregate). This could affect the economics of algae production because if this subspecies were isolated, we could produce a culture with both an amazing growth rate and a phenomenal lipid yield.

INVESTIGATING CONCENTRATION AND COMPOSITION OF PPDS IN BIODIESEL
Danish Singh

As pollution increases and nonrenewable energy sources deplete, there is a need to make biodiesel available to consumers, but many problems have been found with the biodiesel in that its cold flow properties make the biodiesel not suitable for consumers. Much research has gone into developing additives that will improve these cold flow properties. Research which shows that outside fuels such as kerosene can reduce the cloud point (temperature point when wax crystals form in biodiesel) and pour point (temperature point where biodiesel loses fluidity). Research also has shown that some chemicals can reduce the size of wax crystals that form in biodiesel and change their shape. Some research shows that unsaturated components are the best for reducing the pour point of biodiesel while other research states kerosene and outside fuels are more efficient. This project used a 100% soybean biodiesel and made samples with different concentrations of vegetable oil and kerosene diluted in the biodiesel along with a control sample only containing biodiesel. Then the samples were tested for their cloud point and pour point. The data from the samples was analyzed using ANOVA test and percent change formula. The data showed that while kerosene and vegetable oil both reduced the pour and cloud point of the biodiesel, kerosene was the more efficient additive. Results from this project showed more chemicals need to be made that mimic characteristics of biodiesel but this research will only be supported by increasing the scope of the experiment.

MESSIN' WITH TURBULENCE

Just how different would the world be if an effective way to reduce drag had been found fifty years ago? Would we have faster missiles or more fuel-efficient cars? <br><br>Throughout history, the golf ball has improved with its dimpling system and cars have even been experimented with having dimples applied to their surface. The dimples cause an air flow pattern called turbulent flow. This system disturbs the air around the object and closes up the pulling force of air behind the object at a faster rate.<br><br>While dimples may be the key to future drag reduction, it may also cost more to apply this theory, counteracting the theory’s original purpose of saving both money and time. In this experiment, I tested the effect of different sized dimpled surface areas in located in different areas on a model rocket. Using five different rockets, I applied different dimpled surface areas to various locations on each rocket. The locations and sizes were: fully dimpled, upper half dimpled, lower half and fins dimpled, fins dimpled, and smooth surface. The results were not as expected, but had promising hope for later studies. The rocket that utilized dimpling on the lower half and fins performed exponentially better and had a 21% improved flight over the smooth surfaced rocket. A way to reduce and or eliminate drag will continue to be sought after until an effective and economical way to do so is accomplished.

AN INVESTIGATION OF ROTOR BLADE DESIGNS FOR WIND TURBINES
Erica Marie Brunson, Jai Kumar, 
Mankato West High School, Mankato, MN

Rotor blade designs play a significant role in determining total energy output and, therefore, the efficiency of wind turbines. This project experimented with blade designs by varying the shape and number of blades for the turbine to investigate the efficiencies of turbine designs. In the testing of these designs, a number of factors were kept constant, including the generator used and the wind conditions. A small model wind turbine was used to test the various designs of blades. In order to determine energy output and efficiency of each design, computer software was used to measure and record the current and voltage of the wind turbine’s output. From this data, power output was calculated and graphed against time. By integrating the graph of power output versus time, the total energy output for the testing period was determined. Efficiency of each design was determined by comparing the energy output of the wind turbine design to the kinetic energy of the incoming wind. From this testing, it is clear that wind turbine blade design affects wind turbine efficiency. In the future, further exploration and research of rotor blade design will continue to improve wind turbine efficiency.

O.V.W.S (OVER-HEIGHT VEHICLES WARNING SYSTEM)
Murad Muhammad Al-Ostaz, Tariq Khader, 
King Hussein Foundation - Jubilee School, Amman, JORDAN

It's reported that the frequency of over-height vehicles' accidents increased by 75% between 1995 and 2009. This research offers an innovative method to minimize the occurrence of accidents caused by over-height vehicles under bridges and tunnels. The procedure involves placing an IR detector on a specific height on both sides of the road before the traffic diversion, if the vehicle crossed the IR beam a signal would be sent to a device inside the vehicle that would alert the driver with an alarm and a voice message to go by the diversion. Danger, accidents and economic loss will be avoided if the driver is fully attentive to the alarm inside the vehicle which is our project’s idea. In the final analysis; over-height vehicles' drivers should be fully aware to the height of bridges and tunnels, or to the traffic diversions in roads using the new warning system in order to decrease the accidents and danger that leads to death.

A COMPARISON OF ALGAE GROWTH IN WASTE WATER VERSUS STANDARD BRISTOL MEDIA
Markie Collins Kindred, Miranda Tornatore, 
Sentinel High School, Missoula, MT

Biofuels were first developed in the early 1900s by Rudolf Diesel who created an engine that ran on peanut oil. Green algae has many significant advantages over food based biofuel products as a possible biofuel source. Algae does not impact the food supply, it decreases air pollution and the production of green house gases, and it produces much more fuel per unit of mass than the traditional biofuels. The purpose of this investigation is to compare Chlorella vulgaris algae growth in a synthetic waste water media nutrient with that of standard Bristol media using a hemacytometer to perform algae cell counts. This study provides evidence that synthetic waste water media yields significantly more algae growth than standard Bristol media. The results indicate that this algae may solve two environmental problems: the need for inexpensive biofuels and the remediation of environmental wastes.

MANUFACTURING AN IMPROVED POLYMER PHOTOVOLTAIC CELL USING GRAPHENE AND GRAPHENE OXIDE
Nathan Akhavan, Benjamin Goldman, 
Rambam Mesivta, Lawrence, NY

A photovoltaic solar cell captures the sun's limitless energy and converts it into electricity. Organic polymer solar cells are of interest because they are cost-effective, produce a smaller environmental impact, are lighter, and can be flexible; but their efficiency is significantly lower than inorganic cells. We proposed a method of increasing efficiency by incorporating graphene and graphene oxide (GO) into these cells. We synthesized GO using a modified Hummer's method and reduced it to graphene via a novel, room temperature, tabletop method devised in our lab. These materials were integrated with variations of a conventional P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS organic polymer solar cell. Testing under a halogen lamp showed that the cell utilizing GO as a hole conductor increased the voltage production by 26%, while the cell incorporating graphene as the hole conductor decreased the production by 32%, suggesting that graphene cannot function as a hole conductor. Solar Simulator tests indicate that the incorporation of GO improved the conductivity of the holes, increasing the efficiency by 10% even with a non-optimized pattern, but can be improved with improved graphics for the manufacture of the cell. Future work will include combining graphene with additional polymers to enable better integration within P3HT; creating graphene channels within the P3HT for more efficient electron transport to the aluminum electrode; using a commercial lithographic mask instead of our hand-drawn design to improve the accuracy of the measurements; modifying the GO synthesis to yield larger graphene sheets; and improving the surface of the cell to prevent pinning and short-outs.

DYE-SENSITIZED SOLAR CELL USING NATURAL DYES EXTRACTED FROM PURSLANE WEED (PORTULACA OLERACEA)
Sean Luke Rocero Cabiles, John David Fadullo Caburnay, Jeffrey Villanueva Abulencia
Victorino Mapa High School, Manila, PHILIPPINES

Synthetic dyes are widely used as photosensitizer in dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). Recently, researchers use natural dye extracts as a cheaper source of phothosensitizers. Purslane (Portulaca oleracea), a common weed reportedly containing betacyanin (Imperato, 1975), was studied to determine if it could be a source of effective photosensitizers.<br><br> Fresh purslane reddish stems and yellow flowers were collected and triturated separately in ethanol, filtered and centrifuged. This was similarly done for another set of samples using 0.1 M HCl. Using UV-Visible spectrophotometer, these two natural dyes were scanned for the presence of betalains. The spectra yielded absorbance peaks at 484 nm and at 537 nm for the ethanol-extracted dyes from the flowers and stems, respectively. For the HCl-extracted dyes, the peaks were at 468 nm (flowers) and at 536 nm (stems). These results agree with the reported absorption peaks of betacyanin (535-540 nm) and betaxanthin (463-484 nm).<br><br> Sets of DSSCs using titanium dioxide sensitized with ethanol and HCl-extracted dyes were constructed and their photoactivities measured in terms of photovoltages and photocurrents under halogen lamp illumination.The average photovoltages and photocurrents of the DSSCs with ethanol-extracted photosensitizers were 130.2 mV and 0.35 mA (flowers), and 34.65 mV and 0.09 mA (stems). The HCl-extracted photosensitizers had 6.05 mV and 0.017 mA (flowers), and 58.35 mV and 0.15 mA (stems). <br><br> The ethanol-extracted natural dyes from flowers generated the best photoactivity. Since purslane is abundant in the Philippines, it can provide a good source of natural dye photosensitizers cheaper than synthetic dyes.

IMPACT OF COMMERCIAL ADDITIVES ON FUEL PROPERTIES OF CAMELINA BIODIESEL
Justin Allan Christofferson, Ryan Paul, 
Malta High School, Malta, MT

Biofuels are an integral part of today's growing economy. The purpose of our project was to test different additives on biodiesel fuel made from camelina seed. We used three different additives: Seafoam, Gunk, and BD3 that were specifically designed for diesel fuel. We produced 20 batches of biofuel, and then traveled to Havre Montana to complete the following tests at the Bio-Energy Center at MSU-Northern. <br><br>We ran the FTIR tests and found that there were double carbon bonds within the original biodiesel. While running the petrooxy tests, each solution performed the same and had similar results. During the Oxidation Stability tests we found that all our samples failed-the time limit as 3 hours was the minimum and our samples lasted less than 30 minutes. In the vacuum distillation tests all of the samples failed-this was due to all samples exceeding the 360°C limit. In the carbon residue tests all samples were within the range of the .05% by weight maximum limit. When testing the viscosity of samples, all proved to be within the ASTM standards of 1.9-6.0 mm2/sec. The fuel proved to be converted during the Gas Chromtography test-the total glycerin level in our biofuel was 0.102% by mass--this fell below the ASTM limit of 0.24%. <br><br>In conclusion, all additives do not work effectively in all biofuels--it is possible that due to differences in the cemical makeup in the biodiesel fuel, namely oxygenation, that the additives are designed for diesel fuel only. Further research must be done to identify and produce additives specific for each unique biofuel.

A TEMPERATURE-CONTROLLED INVESTIGATION OF AU/PD NANOPARTICLE CATALYSIS FOR APPLICATIONS IN A PEM FUEL CELL
Gurpreet Singh, Karan Sikka, 
Half Hollow Hills High School West, Dix Hills, NY

The mechanism by which gold and palladium nanoparticles (Au-NPs, Pd-NPs) enhance PEM fuel cells (PEMFCs) was studied in order to understand the reactions catalyzed to increase power output. Au-NPs and AuPd-NPs are extremely active catalysts for the reverse water gas shift reaction and the 2e- reduction of oxygen respectively. Thiol-coated Au-NPs and Pd-NPs were synthesized using a two phase method. Au-NP, Pd-NP, and AuPd-NP monolayers were deposited onto Nafion®-117 membranes using Langmuir deposition. In addition, a gas heater/humidifier module was engineered to control the temperature of the fuel cell. Power output curves were obtained for each NP by testing them at ambient and high temperature (20°C vs. 80°C) in a single-cell PEMFC. At ambient temperature, AuPd-NPs were superior, increasing the power output of the fuel cell by 46%. At 80°C, the Au-NPs were superior, increasing the power output of the fuel cell by 48%, outperforming all other catalysts. This suggests that at 20°C, the efficient catalysis of the 2e- reduction by AuPd-NPs was responsible for the enhancement, while at 80°C, a distinct endothermic reaction by Au-NPs enhanced the power output. To learn more about the role of the Au-NPs in the fuel cell, CO2 and O2 were introduced to the cathode gas stream. It was found that Au-NPs do not interact with CO2 at 80°C, suggesting the reaction to be oxygen based. With respect to cost, AuPd was most practical at low temperatures with a cost of $116/kW, and at high temperatures, Pd was most practical with a cost of $123/kW. The 2e- reduction of oxygen and the Au-NP catalysis can be further analyzed and optimized to maximize the increase in power output.

POSITIVE ENERGY PROJECT: THE UTILIZATION OF SMALL AERO-GENERATORS IN PRODUCTION AND SUSTAINABLE CONSUMPTION OF THE WIND POTENTIAL IN ACARAU
Arbiston de Sousa Borges, Rivan Rocha Para, 
EEEP Tomaz Pompeu de Sousa Brasil, Acarau, CE, BRASIL

Currently, the search for alternative energy sources is necessary to attend present needs and to preserve future generations, besides economical factors. Among all clean energy generation technologies, the wind-generated energy looks the most promising of all in Brazil. Brazil’s northeast region, and particularly, Acaraú city, in Ceará state, has great wind characteristics, having one of the world’s highest wind mean. After studies and analysis, we developed a prototype of an aero generator capable of satisfactorily taking the wind kinetic energy and converting it into electrical energy, using an automotive alternator. But this first prototype was not very effective with weak wind. <br><br>Motivated by periods of light winds, between the months of Januray to July, we seeked alternatives to keep the same performance out of the ideal conditions, ie below 5m/s. We developed a mechanical planetary rotation, using a mechanism similar to a few helicopters. With this mechanism we gained speed increase even with light winds and durability since around 95% of the equipment functions mechanically. The tangentail air flow created between the counter rotating propellers, promotes stability and prevents wear of mechanical equipment and directs the wind without the help of a tail. Therefore the wind turbine with counter rotation becomes a more interesting alternative to solve the problem of periods of low wind density. This mechanical system offers simplicity, high performance and durability. The total cost of the materials used to build this prototype sumed aproximately $1.000,00.<br><br>With this prototype we showed it is possible to attend remote communities, granting illumination, food conservation, information access and comfort in an environmentally correct way and without monthly cost.

We constructed and tested a generator that could be inserted into water<br><br>lines supplying households and businesses. The generator uses the kinetic<br><br>energy from the water moving into residential and commercial structures in<br><br>order to generate power, while avoiding significant decreases in water<br><br>pressure. Magnets were attached to our impeller which was placed inside a<br><br>testing pipe. Solenoids were positioned perpendicularly to the axis of<br><br>rotation of the impeller and were wired to a diode. By manipulating the<br><br>shape of the blades (flat, curved-isometric) and the number of magnets on<br><br>each rod (one, four) during our experiments, we were able to observe<br><br>differences in voltage, pressure, and flow rate. We measured the voltage<br><br>across the diode to calculate power output, the differential pressure across<br><br>the turbine, and the flow rate based on five-second intervals. The turbine<br><br>with curved blades and four magnets produced significantly more power than<br><br>the other design permutations (single factor ANOVA, p<0.05). The flow rate<br><br>displayed a different pattern of difference as the power, in that only the<br><br>four-magnet turbine with curved blades gave a statistically higher result<br><br>(single factor ANOVA, p=0.0202). Although the two turbines with one magnet<br><br>had larger average pressure drops than the two with four magnets, the<br><br>pressure drop was not significantly different when comparing all four<br><br>turbines (single factor ANOVA, p=0.3133).

THE FUTURE OF WATER PURIFICATION: THE MEDIATOR-LESS MICROBIAL FUEL CELL
Matthew Joseph Detmer, Trevr Fernald, 
Piedra Vista High School, Farmington, NM

The effectiveness of a mediator-less microbial fuel cell (MFC) in water cleaning applications was compared with the effectiveness of simple systems using ultra violet (UV) and sediment filtration. The experiment was designed to test both the ability of the MFC to create potable water through the removal of unwanted substances in a wastewater remediation application.<br><br> The hypothesis is that if various mixtures of wastewater are processed using a single-cell mediator-less MFC, then both water cleansing and electrical production will occur in an efficient manner, with the processed water being comparable in cleanliness to other simple water purification methods.<br><br> For the experiment an MFC was constructed as were a UV filter and a sediment filter systems. Three types of wastewaters were also created: a garbage mixture made of blended restaurant waste (including grease trap material), a beer mixture made of unfermented end-of-run mash from a local brewery, and oil well injection water. Tests of these showed mixed results: the constructed MFC failed when it came to removing bacteria from the samples, but it did manage to remove a number of unwanted ions in some tests.

This project is the direct outgrowth of research and practical work to combat the strong dependency on fossil fuel in the daily lives of man. This project is based on the complete application of conversions, setting it apart from the other electrical cars as we know them around the world. We used a 1995 Chevy Cavalier, re-designed and re-engineered it to become fuel independent and at the same time road worthy. We designed and customized the Control Board, which regulates the flow of electrical DC current from the battery pack to the different components of the car; primary contactor, secondary contactor, DC to DC converter, Curtis PMC Controller “brain”, cooling fan, and the pot box (potentiometer), also known as the accelerator pedal. The conversion for a conventional car into a fuel independent model was completed through the final application of the Control Board. <br><br>Our automotive design, combined with our re-engineering plan resulted in a first of its kind electric car design for fuel non-dependency through a complete conversion system that operates on a calculated cost of cents per mile. This type of design is recommended for the Virgin Islands and regions similar to it for immediate relief of the high dependency on fossil fuel.

HARNESSING THE SUN: USING NATURAL DYES FOR ENERGY
Serene Yu, Kaiser Tin-U, Kimberly Vu
Michael E. Debakey High School for Health Professions, Houston, TX

A voracious need for energy obtained from natural gases and oil has resulted in environmental damage. As a result, the popularity of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC’s), which can be more cheaply produced than the common silicon solar cell, has grown due to interests in solar energy and preserving renewable resources. DSSC’s use natural ingredients (fruits, vegetables, etc) as dyes, which are crucial to the process of converting light into electricity.<br><br> The purpose of this project was to determine which dye, when used as a photosensitizer in a DSSC, would produce the most voltages. Four dyes were selected: raspberry, chlorophyll (from spinach leaves), hibiscus tea leaf, clothing dye, and a combination of raspberry and hibiscus tea leaf. It was hypothesized that the raspberry hibiscus dye would produce the most voltages. Two cells were designated for each dye, for a total of ten cells. They were made using kits from the Institute for Chemical Education, and the students constructed the dyes. Voltage output of each cell was measured at ten-minute intervals for one hour each day, for three days. The results showed that the chlorophyll dye produced the highest voltage (average of 0.295 volts), followed by clothing dye (0.277 volts), combined raspberry-hibiscus tea leaf dye (0.236 volts), raspberry dye (0.201 volts), and the hibiscus tea leaf dye produced the least overall voltages (0.178volts).<br><br> In this experiment, it was proven that the chlorophyll dye produced the most voltages consistently. This shows great potential for future large-scale studies of its productivity and utilization.

RUNNING ON MOONSHINE: EXPLORING ALTERNATIVE GRAINS IN EFFICIENT ETHANOL PRODUCTION
Kori Anna Hall, Meredith Light, 
Rolla High School, Rolla, KS

A changing world calls for changing products. In light of this fact our purpose was to create a bio-fuel that would produce as high a proof (alcohol content) as corn ethanol. Thus, we created ethanol using corn, oats, pinto beans, and soybeans. Due to the large usage of corn in our region and the starch levels in corn, we assumed it would manufacture the highest proof. The first process is to make the mash. Through a series of boiling, cooling, adding ½ teaspoon of enzymes and 2 teaspoons of brewer’s yeast, we produced a mash that would next have to ferment for around 7 days. The next procedure was to distill the fermented mash. This process consisted of boiling out the alcohol while leaving most of the water behind. In our results we were looking for a high proof, more acidic substance with a low water content. To our surprise corn produced the lowest alcohol content of all grains, while soybeans were the highest. Pinto beans stayed constantly in the middle throughout all of our trials, with oats below soybeans. During the pH tests the soybeans were the most acidic, oats were less acidic, and the corn was more of a base. Once again, the pinto beans stayed constantly in the middle. We learned from this project that there are many different grains that could be used in ethanol production; however, soybeans were the most efficient ethanol producing grain.

BIOGAS PRODUCTION
Stephanie Anne Clark
Starr's Mill High School, Fayetteville, GA

The future will require that we find alternative sources of energy and we will need to discover sources that produce the most energy per unit input. This experiment was to determine which type of manure, collected from geese, cows, or horses, would produce the most methane to be used as an alternative energy source. The manure samples were collected, mixed into slurries of 1/3 manure and 2/3 water, and put in homemade generators made of milk jugs. The gas production caused the pressure to change, indicated by raising the water in the manometers attached to the jugs. Changes were recorded over 5 days. The best producer of methane was the goose manure, producing an average change of 14.97 cm of water recorded on the final day. It produced almost 3 times that of the cow (5.5 cm) manure and almost 5 times as much as the horse (2.57 cm) manure. The differences are probably based on the diets of the sources. The geese eat a more carnivorous diet which is typically harder to digest so it passes more energy through the digestive system than the vegetation eaten by the horses and cows. Manure definitely does have the potential to be able to produce methane usable as an energy source. The source of the methane should be considered to get the most out of it.

THE SYNTHESIS AND ANALYSIS OF VARIOUS SUGAR-BASED POTASSIUM NITRATE ROCKET PROPELLANTS
Parth Chetan Thakker
South Mecklenburg High School, Charlotte, NC

The primary purposes of this experiment were to identify, synthesize, and evaluate various sugar-based rocket propellants as viable alternatives to commercially made rocket propellants. Cost-effectiveness and ease-of-synthesis were examined in addition to the raw performance of each type of propellant. Other secondary purposes included the development and implementation of a reusable model rocket motor casing for these propellants, and a compact testing apparatus for the accurate quantitative analysis of such a motor. The three different fuels tested for performance were sucrose, dextrose, and sorbitol. These were synthesized into propellants using potassium nitrate (an oxidizer) and corn syrup (a binder), which were dissolved in water at an elevated temperature and then subsequently recrystallized to their pliable, anhydrous states. An aluminum-alloy external motor casing was used to test these propellants in a realistically pressurized environment.<br><br>Calculated performance measures included density, linear burn-rate, average thrust and specific-impulse. The sets of specific-impulse data were analyzed using an ANOVA test, which concluded that there was a statistically significant difference between the performances of each propellant. The correlation analysis, which was conducted to determine the relationship between burn-rate and density, was inconclusive. Both the quantitative (specific-impulse) and qualitative results suggested that the sorbitol propellant had the highest performance and most potential for future development. Sucrose performed almost as well as the sorbitol propellant, while dextrose was found to be vastly inferior. Both the aluminum casing and the static test stand worked flawlessly, and will be continued to be developed for more uses in the future.

THE IMPLICATIONS OF PHOTO-VOLTAIC ARRAYS AND THE EFFECT ON GLOBAL TEMPERATURE AND HEALTH
Jackson D Egert
Maple Grove Senior High School, Maple Grove, MN

The purpose of my project was to discover the implications in the production and use of photo-voltaic arrays. I began my project by spreading a layer of soil then a layer of peat moss in a 2’x1’ creature tank. I attached a clamp lamp to the rim of the Tank. I placed an air temperature probe in the center of the Tank. I record both air and soil temperatures before testing and after testing. Before testing I turned on the lamp at the same time that I started my stop watch. I recorded the new data after a 30 wait time, after completing those tests 10 times; I placed a scaled photo-voltaic array in the center of the tank. The array was placed at a 46 degree angle, the best possible angle for collecting sun energy at my location. I then ran all of the same testing another 10 times with the array in the tank. Data was compiled and calculated to determine outcome.<br><br> <br><br>My conclusion was that after the solar array was introduced the air and soil temperatures rose. The air temp increased approximately 2.5 degrees when compared to the control test.<br><br>My hypothesis was proven correct in the form that the temp increased with the array in environment enough to be statistically significant<br><br>The scale is limited, however, the significant increase in temperature certainly points to an increase in global temperature.

EXPLORING PRETREATMENT OPTIONS FOR LIGNOCELLULOSIC BIOMASS TO FACILITATE EFFICIENT HYDROLYSIS AND BIOFUEL PRODUCTION
Jonah Zachariah Butler
Sibley East, Arlington, MN

This study’s focus was identifying the best pretreatment for use in large-scale cellulosic ethanol production. Five types of biomass materials were investigated by comparing their ethanol and glucose contents. The samples (corn stalks, corn husks, switchgrass, alfalfa, and soft pine sawdust) were dried, and then ground to particles of 50 microns. Six precisely-measured samples were taken from each material and twelve more were taken from switchgrass. Three were treated with sulfuric acid (H2SO4), three with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and twelve switchgrass samples were treated with chlorine dioxide (ClO2) in solutions of 0%, 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, and 30%. Each sample was treated with citric acid (to neutralize) and antibiotics (to prevent the growth of undesirable organisms). One sample from each material was left at this stage as a control to establish the efficacy of the enzymes. The remaining samples were treated with enzymes and all the samples were placed in a heated oscillator for seven days in a process called enzymatic hydrolysis, in which the enzymes release the glucose. A small amount of each material was filtered and tested for glucose using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The remaining samples were fermented with yeast to distill the alcohol, and the alcohol content was established by testing in the HPLC. After completing a graphical analysis of the results, it was concluded that pretreatment significantly increased the glucose and ethanol yields. It further showed that the most efficient pretreatment was the H2SO4, followed closely by the ClO2. The NaOH was not competitive.

PROTON EXCHANGE MEMBRANE FUEL CELL STACK CONFIGURATION OPTIMIZATION USING A NEW ALGORITHM
Uttara Chakraborty
Chakraborty Homeschool, Chesterfield, MO

This project developed a new stochastic heuristic method for proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) stack design optimization. The task -- an open problem in PEMFC research -- is to find optimal values of PEMFC stack parameters such that (i) the stack delivers the rated voltage at the maximum power point, (ii) the maximum power matches or exceeds the stipulated requirement, (iii) the cost of building it is minimized. This is a practical problem that is analytically intractable and computationally hard.<br><br>The new heuristic is designed as a point-based search that starts out with a single trial vector in the state space and samples other vectors in a stochastically guided manner, to arrive, eventually, at an optimal or near-optimal solution vector. For transition from one vector to the next, a new transition probability function is introduced, involving the ratio of the observed difference and the expected difference in objective function values. Simulation results show that the new method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on two performance metrics: (i) solution quality, (ii) computational cost. Statistical tests of significance on multiple, independent executions (runs) show that the results produced by the new method are significantly better than the best-known solutions for this problem published in the fuel cell literature.<br><br>The two original contributions of this project are: (i) a new solution to an engineering problem (a new approach to PEMFC stack design with demonstrated empirical success); (ii) a new, parameter-less algorithm that has the potential to be a general-purpose global optimizer in computer science.

THE EFFECT OF A BACTERIA'S SOURCE ON A MICROBIAL FUEL CELL'S ELECTRICAL OUTPUT
Jaden Allen Williams
New Milford High School, New Milford, CT

Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) have the potential to be an answer to the world’s growing necessity for a renewable, “green” energy source. They are versatile and can be cheaply made giving them the ability to be used across the globe and have a variety of potential applications. This experiment will help determine how sources of bacteria influence the electricity produced by a MFC. Three two-chambered MFCs, one for each bacteria source, were constructed. Both mud and water samples were collected from the Housatonic and Aspetuck Rivers. These samples were placed in two MFCs. The third MFC, the control, used rocks and tap water in place of the mud and water samples. During the experiment, the MFCs ran for 14 days and the voltage reading was recorded twice every day at the same time for each MFC. It was hypothesized the more electrochemically active bacteria from the Housatonic River, due to Housatonic’s lower dissolved oxygen content than the Aspetuck, would produce the most electricity. The results showed that the Aspetuck River mud, on average, produced about 250 millivolts, the Housatonic River mud 100 millivolts and the control only 1.6 millivolts of output voltage over three trials. This shows that the effectiveness of bacteria in a MFC is more complex than simply a bacteria’s electrochemical activity. Certain types of bacteria could contain special traits that make them superior or inferior to others in MFCs such as, creating biofilms around an electrode. This could the basis of a future experiment.

A BETTER WAY TO FLY: EXPLORING THE BENEFITS OF LIFTING FUSELAGES AND BLENDED WING BODIES
Connor Sullivan McCree Lynch
Rocky Bayou Christian School, Niceville, FL

This project’s purpose was to determine if a lifting fuselage design or blended wing body design would have better aerodynamic performance for a transport aircraft than a tube and wing design. <br><br>My hypothesis was that a transport aircraft with a lifting fuselage design or a blended wing design will have better lift-to-drag performance when compared to a traditional tube-and-wing design at similar angles of attack (AOA).<br><br>The experimental procedure included the following. First, I assembled my wind tunnel, balances, and three aircraft. Each aircraft had an identical aircraft usable volume (controlled) but a different airfoil/planform (independent). I ran each test for 1 minute, varying the AOA from 0 to 20. Using a force sensor and computer, I collected 60 electronic readings for drag and lift forces for each condition at each AOA. I repeated the test for each condition. Averaging the readings, I calculated the lift-to-drag ratio at each AOA for each condition. <br><br>The lift performance for the lifting fuselage design and the blended fuselage design were, over all, better than the tube-and wing design. The tube-and-wing design stalled at 10 degrees AOA. The lifting fuselage design stalled as 15 degrees AOA. The blended wing body design did not stall through 20 degrees AOA. <br><br>The lifting fuselage design and blended wing body design had better lift-to-drag ratios at most AOAs, from 1.12 times better for the lifting fuselage design and 1.22 times better for the blended wing-body design. The blended fuselage was 1.05 times better than the lifting fuselage.

ALTERNATE ENERGY: A SHOCKING NEW FIND!
Nicholas Aaron Hopkins
Fort Walton Beach High School, Fort Walton Beach, FL

The purpose of this project is to develop and evaluate methods to convert the absorbed energy by a shock absorber into an electrical output. The electrical output could be used to charge a battery system or directly feed an electrical system.<br><br> I developed two conversions. The mechanical conversion is focused on harnessing the oscillation of the shock in a lever connected to a rotating pin and an energy producing motor. The electromagnetic conversion is focused on harnessing the oscillation of the shock by inserting the piston into a cylinder wrapped in a coil. These systems could be attached to a load, which would harness the energy. <br><br> I performed eight tests in three categories. The tests demonstrate a reverse motor produces electricity, the conversion of mechanical energy and the conversion of electromagnetic energy.<br><br>Procedure summary: <br><br> I developed a small scale vehicle with a fifth wheel designed to model a shock absorber. I developed a cylinder wrapped with a wire coil and a shock piston with magnets to model a shock absorber. I measured voltage produced over frequency and velocity.<br><br> I performed Linear Regression Analysis on the data and concluded the designed mechanical conversion system when operated at full scale would not harvest as much energy as I had hoped. The same analysis concluded the electromagnetic conversion is suitable to harvest energy as designed.<br><br> I concluded that the project could be extended to a larger scale with a more sophisticated energy storage system to further optimize the harvest of otherwise lost energy.

ON THIN ICE: CONTROLLING, SLOWING, AND STOPPING THE MOTION OF A CAR SLIDING ON AN ICY ROAD AND OTHER SLICK SURFACES
Kyle Scott Saleeby
Niceville High School, Niceville, FL

The purpose of my project is to design a device that can be attached to any car, that while sliding on ice, snow, or other slick surfaces (standing water), slows the car’s motion or stops the car, and controls the direction of the motion to reduce or prevent injuries to the occupants and damage to the vehicle and potentially impacted objects. I designed and built a rudder/brake device that attaches to the underside of a car, with interchangeable foot plates, that when manually or automatically activated falls to the ground and creates friction. I built a small scale model car and tested the device on icy and other simulated slick surfaces. The rudder brake device was a complete success, controlling the orientation of the car in the direction of motion, so that the impact would be on the front of the car, which is safer to the occupants. It also quickly slowed the velocity of the car, and at times even stopped it completely. Since kinetic energy is directly proportional to velocity squared, any decrease in velocity dramatically decreases the force of impact, and is safer for the occupants.

OPTIMIZATION OF A DYE-SENSITIZED SOLAR CELL
Savannah Elizabeth Est
Wentzville High School, Wentzville, MO

As the urgency for alternative renewable energy sources increases due to depletion of natural resources and fossil fuels, solar energy offers a renewable and sustainable substitute. Although silicon-based solar cells can be used to produce significant amounts of energy, they are expensive for mass production and their composite materials are not always readily accessible.. Alternatively, the “next generation” dye-sensitized solar cells, or Gratzel cells, use more efficient construction and utilization processes. In this study, the standard dye-sensitized solar cell fabrication design has been examined and tested using natural anthocyanin dyes extracted from various plants and fruits as a substitute for the expensive, synthetic ruthenium complex dyes that are currently used in the commercial production of Gratzel cells. Many factors contribute to the usable energy production of the Gratzel cells, as measured in voltage and current. This project analyzes the chromatographic and spectral absorption properties of a select set of plant anthocyanins and their impact on the electrical current produced by a Gratzel cell. With this information in mind, an exploration was made using different modes of cell connection and cell dimensions to optimize the power efficiency of the Gratzel cell to better understand the capacity of anthocyanin-based dye-sensitized solar cells.

EXAMINATION OF POWER GRID CASCADING FAILURE THROUGH SIMULATION
Wyatt Jonah Goodin
Fairview High School, Boulder, CO

In electrical grids worldwide, the decay of aging hardware in power lines and buses is becoming a cause of large scale failures. Using computer simulation, this study examined the effectiveness of varying network topologies, as well as repair strategies, on minimizing the commonality of massive power blackouts. As previous studies were performed by examining the preexisting electrical grids, they were unable to determine the general effects of many variables. This study was capable of varying the ways in which a network is structured and repaired, thereby determining the effects of these variances. It was found that a more distributed electrical grid (more mesh-like, rather than a branching structure) is preferable to a grid in which the loads are concentrated around the generation sites. With this information in mind, it would be beneficial to slowly modify the established power networks in North America, Europe, and other developed countries such that loads are more evenly distributed, as opposed to the now common branching structure. New power networks could also benefit from implementing this grid structure.

WIND POWER! PHASE IV
Annamica Therese Reding
Alpena High School, Alpena, AR

This experiment sought to determine whether increased elevation and the presence of a lake effect wind speed and electricity production. Further data was gathered concerning temperature’s effect on wind speed as well, which was initially tested in Phase III. <br><br>Temperature and wind speed at ground level and at 3.048 meters above were recorded at a waterside test site and in a field for eight consecutive days. Daily and overall average wind speeds were calculated. Overall average wind speeds were converted into electrical units (volts) using a wind generating apparatus, which simulated wind’s effect on a wind turbine. The average volts of electricity produced were calculated and statistical analyses were performed on all of the data.<br><br>Overall average wind speeds were as follows: waterside-ground level 5.79 km/h; waterside-elevated 8.85 km/h; field-ground level 7.56 km/h; field-elevated 12.23 km/h. Average amounts of electricity produced were as follows: waterside-ground level 0.38 volts; waterside-elevated 1.20 volts; field-ground level 0.82 volts; field-elevated 2.74 volts. The average temperature for the waterside location was 10.8 degrees Celsius and the average temperature for the field was 6.4 degrees Celsius.<br><br>The alternative hypothesis, that higher elevation increases wind speed, and therefore increases the amount of electricity produced, was accepted due to confidence intervals of 99.99%. The data concerning the presence of water was inconclusive due to the elevation of the test sites.

HOT WATER FROM COMPOST: MAKING YOUR WATER USE GREENER
Victoria Elizabeth Willcut
Puxico R-8 High School, Puxico, MO

My project focuses on reducing the energy used to heat water for household use. My hypothesis was-If the heat from the decomposition of biomass can be continually and efficiently harnessed, it can be used to heat water for use in a home. I designed and built a water heating system. My system harnesses the heat produced by decomposition of biomass via a series of coils which use convection to transfer the heat from the compost drum to the heater drum. The heat flows between the drums in a convection cycle. The heat transfers from the decomposition process into the conduit fluid in the coils, where it then transfers by convection up to the top of the compost drum coil and into the top of the heater drum coil. Inside the heater drum, the conduit fluid transfers its heat to the cooler water inside the heater drum effectively heating the water for use. The now cool conduit fluid continues onto the bottom of the coil inside the heater drum and then it passes back into the compost drum coil where the cycle repeats. I saw no correlation between the output temperature of the heating system and the ambient temperature. Even with significant temperature reduction in the core temperature of the compost drum the output temperature saw no decline. My hypothesis was supported and my null was not supported. I was able to use the heating system to provide hot water for my home-several showers, loads of laundry, and dishes per day. The maximum output water temperature was 74.44 degrees Celsius. The heating system that I designed can be used by any household worldwide. This project provides an alternative energy source for the heating of water for household use, and it provides a more efficient design for the water heating system than previously built.

WIND ENERGY AND ITS FUTURE POTENTIAL
Bradley Derek Sloop
Susquenita High School, Duncannon, PA

Green energy sources-especially wind, have been relied upon more than ever within the past decade. In the United States, the growth of the wind industry has led to a decrease in energy market volatility. As a result, the purpose of this study was to use modern wind technology in order to design a highly efficient rotor (prototype) that would be capable of maximizing power output, while not compromising on efficiency. To accomplish this objective, it was necessary to determine if the blade angle of a rotor has an effect on its tip-speed ratio, a highly important performance characteristic. The blade angle was changed by 5 degree increments to account for the independent variable. To analyze rotor performance, it was essential for the rotor to be properly mounted inside the test chamber of a wind tunnel, where it was subject to a controlled air pattern. Through the integration of both a tachometer and anemometer, accurate measurements on rotor performance were able to be conducted, including RPM and downstream wind velocity. With this experimental data, tip-speed ratio, efficiency, and power output were calculated. In general, as the blades increased above 5 degrees, the performance of the rotor gradually decreased-showing that a slight pitch angle allows the lift/drag ratio to be optimized. The rotor extracted nearly 59% of the available power in the wind-extremely close to the Betz Limit. If the diameter of the rotor was notably increased in scale, the annual power output would rise exponentially. This would allow it to be loaded onto a generator and used as an inexpensive, affordable, and clean method for individual homeowners to generate their own electricity off-grid; coupling the continual rise in electric rates imposed by utility providers around the world.

AN ANALYSIS OF THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF IMPROVED RESIDENTIAL HEAT PRODUCTION FROM SUSTAINABLE BIOMASS RESOURCES
Ceirra Danielle Carlson
Greybull High School, Greybull, WY

Pellets are small pieces of compacted material made through compression and heating. They are used for such diverse applications as feed and heat energy. Wood is the most common source of pellet fuels. Though wood provides a high combustion efficacy, overuse can have a negative impact on the environment by decreasing tree populations. Wood fuels are also increasingly expensive because of the associated costs of harvesting, transportation and production. A move towards more sustainable biomass resources to generate heat would be a preferable alternative to wood use. This research tested materials such as corn silage, wheat, sugar beet pulp and switchgrass. These resources are far more abundant, renewable and produce significant cost savings, particularly if they can be grown or produced locally.<br><br> To prepare test pellets, all materials were ground into a fine powder, dried to 3% - 5% moisture content and compressed in a hydraulic press. The mass of each pellet was recorded and the pellet was placed in a ceramic enclosure below a specific volume of water at a known temperature. The pellet was ignited and the resulting temperature increase of the water was measured. The specific heat of the water was used to calculate the thermal energy produced by each type of pellet.<br><br> Test outcomes showed that wood produced the greatest amount of heat energy and generated the highest cost to produce this energy. Corn silage produced heat energy at levels very close to wood, but would save consumers approximately $929 per ton based on current costs. The use of biomass such as corn silage could reduce deforestation and our reliance on wood products; while also lowering the carbon footprint associated with wood. It could also provide consumers with significant savings.

THE IMPACT OF COMMERCIAL ANTI-GEL ADDITIVES ON BIODIESEL COLD FLOW PROPERTIES
Jonni Rose Bacon
Box Elder High School, Box Elder, MT

This experiment was performed to show the impact of selected diesel fuel additives on the cold flow properties of biodiesel and B20 petroleum diesel. The fuel property tests (flash point, sulfur, petro-oxy, and IROX (cetane)) were also performed to compare the quality of the biodiesel and B20 to normal petroleum diesel fuel. The experimental hypothesis suggested that the temperature of the biodiesel and B20 blend would be lowered to a colder temperature. The results indicate that the experimental hypothesis can be accepted due to the fact that the biodiesel temperature was indeed lowered from the addition of the selected additives. However, there was a significant enough difference that the biodiesel could not with confidence be lowered to the same level as petroleum diesel. Therefore although the biodiesel and B20 blends were lowered to a colder temperature, it would still not be recommended to be used during the winter months in Montana.

ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS ON PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS
Collin Andrew Stipe
Millcreek West Unity, West Unity, OH

This experiment tested how monocrystalline, polycrystalline, and amorphous solar cells perform in different environments. The goal was to find which environment would be optimal for photovoltaic output. Cold, dry, and reflective conditions were predicted to be the best conditions for the cells to maximize efficiency.<br><br>An environmental test chamber was built and wired. After the chamber was complete the variables were tested. The testing investigated humidity, temperature, and reflectivity. Each test performed was a multivariable test containing either a high or a low of each of the variables. When test chamber conditions were stabilized, photovoltaic output was recorded with a digital multimeter. <br><br>The testing and analysis concluded that temperature had a significant effect on all of the solar cells’ power outputs in representation of a p-value of .05 or less in the regression analysis of the data. Humidity also had a significant effect on the polycrystalline solar cell in the reflective chamber and all three cells in the non-reflective chamber with a .05 p-value or less. In a reflective chamber a lower temperature and humidity resulted in a higher photovoltaic output. In a non-reflective chamber outputs were drastically lower than the reflective chamber. Temperature and humidity had the same effect on photovoltaic output in the non-reflective chamber as in the reflective chamber.

LIGHTNING IN A BOTTLE, PHASE II: EXPLORING FUSION
Caleb George Gestes
John Curtis Christian School, River Ridge, LA

Lightning is the most powerful force on earth. It can reach over 300,000 volts and is hotter than the surface of the sun. It is one of the last natural resources on this earth that we have not utilized for our energy needs. The IEC reactor is one of the world's most recent attempts at conquering the world's newest energy source. Fusion. When two molecules fuse they release mass amounts of energy. Energy we could use. However, the biggest problem is where do we get all the energy required to create fusion? What if lightning was the source of power? It has all the properties needed and it is a way to use the power of lightning. This is my attempt at solving the world's need for clean alternative energies. Deuterium, which I used in the fusion process, is found in ocean water and is easy to isolate; plus, it emits extremely low amounts of radiation that isn’t harmful to the environment or us. In this phase of my project I have built a working demonstration model of this fusion reactor. I was unable to use neutron detector, however, I was able to measure the field voltages of my home-built reactor as well as observe the beauty of what seems to be a miniature star. Is this the end of my research? Of course not, it is only the beginning, I will continue to work with my fusion, especially because I am in the process of designing my very own fusion reactor that I hope to develop and patent. However, there is much more to learn about my project, so explore this field with me as we takes steps to our future clean sources of energy, and dive into Lightning in a Bottle.

FLAX SEED BIODIESEL
Taylor John Schroeder
Fairfield Public School District Number 21, Fairfield, MT

Flax is a plant grown mainly in North Dakota and Minnesota. Flax oil is popular in the health food industry to lower cholesterol, treat arthritis, and as a laxative. Flax has potential to be a value-added product. The flax oil can be converted into biodiesel, the pulp from crushing can be pelletized and used in wood burning stoves, and the glycerol can be processed into soap. This research explored flax seed oil as a potential biodiesel fuel. Flax seed oil (linseed oil) was converted through the transesterification process. After the conversion to biodiesel, the fuel was washed and sent to Montana State University, Havre, Montana for analysis. The flax seed biodiesel was analyzed for flash point, cloud point, cold filter plugging point, copper strip corrosion, sulfur, carbon residue, and water and sediment. The flax biodiesel passed the flashpoint standard, EPA sulfur standard, and carbon strip corrosion standard. The fuel had a cloud point of -2 °C and cold filter plugging point of -12 °C. It did not pass the carbon residue or water and sediment standards. However, these problems can be corrected. Based on this research, flax seed oil is suitable for biodiesel fuel.

BIODIESEL SYNTHESIS USING WASTE ANIMAL ADIPOSE TISSUE WITH UNCONVENTIONAL CATALYSTS AND SMALL-DOSE UREA COLD FLOW IMPROVER
Ying Xiong
Century High School, Rochester, MN

Current consumption of nonrenewable fuels threatens world sustainability. Biodiesel from waste animal adipose (fatty tissue), commonly placed in landfills, can mitigate damage from these fuels and provide a viable alternative to traditional plant materials. Adipose biodiesel has been synthesized industrially but does not presently use promising domestic (kitchen) wastes. Three aims and phases were conducted: I. biodiesel synthesis using waste adipose and sodium hydroxide catalyst; II. development of eggshell-derived calcium oxide and unconventional CaO-NaOH catalysts; and III. production of small-dose urea cold flow (cold temperature usability) improvers. Kitchen waste pork, beef, chicken, and turkey adipose tissues were used. In Phase I, 20.0% (v/v, methanol/adipose) methanol and 0.35% (w/v) NaOH reacted with 40 mL adipose. Average biodiesel yield was 108.82%. Adipose heat energy, measured by heating water, was 26.47 kJ/g while plants generated 24.12 kJ/g (p < 0.001). In Phase II, transesterification was conducted with methanol and 10% (w/v, CaO/adipose) CaO, obtained via thermal decomposition of chicken eggshells, as catalyst. Average biodiesel yield was 71.88%. A novel combination of 5.0% CaO and 0.15% NaOH had 92.81% yield. In Phase III, the cold flow improver was created by adding 2.0% (w/v) urea midway in a NaOH-catalyzed reaction. The gelation point decrease averaged 4.33 °C (37.14%) from the original values. Ultimately, large-scale production models using adipose and regression models between properties of biodiesel were constructed. Overall, chicken biodiesel had particular potential. This study demonstrated feasibility of domestically-utilized waste adipose for biodiesel synthesis, developed a novel catalyst, and expanded usability through cold flow improvers.

LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES FOR ELECTRIC CARS: A STUDY OF SOLID ELECTROLYTE INTERFACE USING ELECTROCHEMICAL IMPEDANCE SPECTROSCOPY
Rohan Bodh Gupta
Auburn High School, Auburn, AL

Lithium-ion batteries for electric cars degrade over time with cycles of charge and discharge. Engineers need to be able to measure this degradation in order to improve the batteries. Currently, there is no easy and non-invasive method to monitor the battery’s health including its capacity. Prior to experimentation, it was believed that the impedance of the Solid Electrolyte Interface (SEI) was related to the battery’s capacity. In this project, the impedance of the SEI is examined using the Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) technique. EIS can monitor ion transport within the battery in response to an alternating electric field. EIS testing was done, using four different batteries each at different stages of usage (0, 100, 200, 300 cycles of charge/discharge), to measure the impedances at varying frequencies. The temperature of each battery was kept at 25˚C. The data was converted into Nyquist curves (i.e., imaginary impedance versus real impedance) in order to examine the three components (i.e., ohmic resistance, impedance of SEI layer, and Warburg impedance) that affect the overall impedance of the battery. When impedances of the SEI layers were plotted versus the capacities of the batteries, a linear correlation was obtained. In conclusion, out of the three components that affect battery impedance, SEI layer impedance is the most correlated to capacity, which can be attributed to a decrease in lithium-ion diffusion. This experimentation proved the hypothesis correct and the resulting correlation can be used to improve the life of batteries and to obtain real-time information about the battery’s health.

CREATING AN ENERGY GENERATION PROCESS USING A STIRLING ENGINE
Dylan Alexander Globerman
Colquitt County High School, Moultrie, GA

The Stirling Engine, invented by Robert Stirling in 1816, was the first closed-cycle air engine to be invented. Closed-cycle air engine describes the Stirling Engine’s ability to utilize the same fuel repetitively without releasing any emissions. The operation relies on the working fluid; the working fluid begins in the heated cylinder, where it expands and travels to the cooled cylinder, where it contracts and thus finishes the thermodynamic cycle. This process rotates the engines piston, which creates mechanical energy. During this the student built three prototypes of Stirling Engines: one Alpha-Type, and two Beta-Types. The goal was to construct an operational engine that utilizes renewable energy and is cost efficient enough to implement in Third World countries. The student accomplished both goals by constructing an operational Beta-Type Stirling Engine on the budget of approximately four dollars. After the trials on the operational engine were completed, the average power output achieved was .17 Watts. Since the student could successfully construct a Stirling Engine with only a few dollars, it is a definite possibility to construct Stirling Engines that are powerful enough to match today’s internal combustion engine, while maintaining an equal or smaller cost to the engines implemented in modern society.

IMPROVING BACKYARD WIND TURBINES WITH BLADE ADDITIONS
Daniel James Dorminy
Sola Fide Home School, McDonough, GA

In order to create blade additions to make existing backyard wind turbines more efficient, Southwest Windpower’s AIR 40 wind turbine was tested over 4600 times in homemade wind tunnels in turbulent and straighter wind. In stages 1-4, low profile aircraft wing innovations were compared to determine the best addition for backyard wind turbines. Stage 5 compared winglet style designs and stall strips to previously tested additions. Stage 6 compared these additions to the researchers winglet designed in 2009-10. Stages 1-6 found dual wing fences had the highest efficiency of any devices tested.<br><br> Stage 7 tested 0.5 cm tall wing fences and found their optimal positions. A single wing fence stretching the width of the blade was tested in 51 positions starting 1/52 of the length of the blade away from the tip and proceeding every 1 cm. Once the optimal position of the first fence was found, a second wing fence was added using the same width and position criteria as the first. Two optimally placed wing fences produced 110% of the original output. The blade innovations improve efficiency in straight and turbulent wind conditions similarly, important for near ground and residential area backyard turbines. This project has proven the best blade addition for wind tunnel tests and in turbulent winds, potentially narrowing the gap between field performance and manufacturer claims. Wing fences offer the best opportunity for backyard wind turbine efficiency improvements.

GEOMETRICAL SYMMETRY ANALYSIS OF SKELETONEMA COSTATUM'S AMORPHOUS CELL STRUCTURE
Genesis Garcia
Bridgeport Regional Aquaculture Science and Technology Education Center, Bridgeport, CT

S. costatum, a common species of diatom native to coastal waters around the world, typically grows in chains or colonies. Each cell is conjoined by long processes or marginal spines to form filaments. Like other diatom species, S. costatum contains a frustule (cell wall), the main component of the silica structure. After cell division, within the frustule, the Silicon Deposition Vesicle (SDV) forms and expands constructing complex radial symmetrical shapes of areolae (pores), spiral processes (ribs) and girdle bands called cincture. These microscopic photosynthetic organisms contain a periodic nanostructure composed of silica that suggests an ideal areolae formation for the potency of solar panel efficiency. Understanding the S. costatum amorphous silica pattern within its porous structure can lead to a pattern model that, if replicated in photocatalyst and solar cell construction, will greatly improve the solar cell’s energy output. To develop a pattern model, in-depth analysis of SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) imagery including, length-width ratios of individual areola, the average count and the relative distribution angles of the areola interprets S. costatum’s frustule geometry. Examining the S. costatum in girdle view around the cylindrical can shape of the diatom at 20,000x magnification, exposed a hexagonal outline pattern comprised of seven individual areolae with significant asymmetrical alterations. The individual areolae “positioning” at 62° +/- 2°, relative from center dimensions, with an areola mean dimensional range of .04um length and .03um width respectively. The distribution angles coupled with the dimensional ranges within this hexagonal outline pattern define the final frustule formation. Interpreting this intricate mold of the areola can help understand how this growth pattern forms during the pre-stages of cell division that can potentially be applied to solar panel construction for improved efficiency.

POLYVINYLIDENE FLUORIDE (PVDF) PIEZOELECTRIC GENERATOR: A NOVEL APPROACH TO HARVESTING VIBRATIONS FROM HUMAN RESPIRATION TO POWER BIOLOGICAL IMPLANT DEVICES
Bridget Mary Oei
East Catholic High School, Manchester, CT

Traditional batteries used in biological implants require the patient to undergo invasive surgery during the replacement process. One promising solution is to directly harvest energy from the biological system itself to realize self-powered biomedical devices. This research explores the development of a practical micro-scale device for harvesting energy from a regular human activity—respiration. The energy harvesting relies on the resonant oscillation of a piezoelectric generator whose prime component is a PVDF thin film shaped in a flapper, reed or wind sock configuration. Piezoelectric Generators with PVDF thin film thickness of 28, 52 and 110 microns were tested to investigate their capability of converting low-speed air flow energy into electricity. Experiments indicated that the peak power generated increased as a function of the cubic power of the peak airflow velocity and with decreasing PVDF thickness. The wind sock configuration produced the greatest power for a given PVDF thickness throughout the range of peak airflow velocity. This was followed by the flapper configuration and then the reed configuration. The best configuration tested was the 28 micron thick PVDF film in the wind sock configuration. PVDF oscillations and power was produced with airflow velocity as low as 3.4 ft/sec. In the range of human breathing velocity (10 ft/sec to 25 ft./sec), this configuration produced between 10 to 110 microwatts. At a peak of 10 microwatts, a pacemaker is the largest consumer of electricity of any biomedical device. The PVDF Piezoelectric Generator tested produced more than sufficient power to operate this device.

A NOVEL METHOD TO INCREASE THE LIPID YIELD OF CHLORELLA VULGARIS: AN EXPLORATION OF THE ROLE OF COFACTORS ON THE INHIBITION OF STARCH SYNTHASE (E.C. 2.4.1.21)
Arrush Choudhary
Chantilly High School, Chantilly, VA

The energy crisis is an issue of growing importance as natural gas and oil based energy are projected to be completely depleted within the next 35 years. This project seeks to aid scientists in their quest to determine the next generation of alternative fuels by studying algae-based oils. During the early research stages, the researcher found that a small segment of current algae research focused on nutrient-induced stress as a means of improving lipid yields. The researcher found that this occurs due to the fact that when algae are deprived of essential nutrients, they are forced to stop undergoing certain biological pathways and as a result concentrate on the pathway that produces lipids more heavily. Upon research in other algae like systems, the researcher found that two main enzymes are involved in the algal growth cycle: ACCase and Starch Synthase, both of which compete with each other for a common source of CO2. The researcher thought that nutrient-induced stress on algae was a very indirect means of inhibiting Starch Synthase and as a result decided to inhibit Starch Synthase more directly by using metal cofactors. He hoped that in the presence of these cofactors, the Starch Synthase enzyme would be completely inhibited resulting in a greater fixation of CO2 on the ACCase pathway and subsequently greater lipid production. In order to test his hypothesis, the researcher grew algae for a 2 week period and then quantified lipid production by staining the algal samples with Nile Red and measuring fluorescence via a plate reader. He ultimately found that in the presence of Zn and Co, algal lipid yields, in comparison to the control, increased by 19%. As a result, with the use of cofactors like Zn and Co, algal biofuels can become more economically viable.

BIOLOGICAL HYDROGEN AND ETHANOL PRODUCTION FROM COMMON YARD GRASS
Emily Catherine Wallmann
Greece Athena High School, Rochester, NY

In this study common yard grass was used as a substrate for the production of hydrogen and ethanol through dark fermentation to examine the grass’s usefulness in meeting the energy demands of a private home. The grass was pretreated mechanically and chemically. Following pretreatment, the grass was neutralized, dried, and then used in the preparation of media for dark fermentation by C. thermocellum. Fermentation trials were run using 0.05g of cellobiose (a control feedstock), unpretreated (raw) grass, and pretreated grass. Sodium hydroxide pretreatment at a concentration of 3% for 24 hours was determined to be the optimal set of conditions of those tested here (131.242 ± 10.75 V/s [concentration of ligninols]). Hydrogen and ethanol production was analyzed using a gas chromatograph. Raw Grass (3 days) produced the greatest yield of hydrogen, 1.766E-06 mol H2 of a 0.5mL sample, but pretreated grass grown for three days produced the greatest yield of ethanol, 0.109 microliter of a 0.5 microliter sample. The average American home produces 681 kg of grass and requires 10,000 kwh of energy each year. Using the available quantities of grass, calculations were completed which determined the annual energy yield from this process to be 44.659 kwh, or 0.447% of the annual energy required by the average private home.

ALGAL BIOFUELS, PHASE THREE: A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF ALGAL LIPID EXTRACTION TECHNIQUES AND AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE EFFECT OF NITROGEN STARVATION ON LIPID YIELDS AND ACETYL COENZYME A CARBOXYLASE LEVELS IN SCENEDESMUS SP.
Yanqi Chen
Central York High School, York, PA

Optimal growing conditions were found for Scenedesmus sp. in previous year's research. This year's research analyzed the effectiveness of lipid extraction methods in terms of both cost and lipid efficiency for Scenedesmus sp. (phase 1) and investigated the effect of nitrogen starvation on lipid yields and levels of the protein Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) in Scenedesmus sp. (phase 2). ACCase catalyzes a critical step in the lipid synthesis pathway. Lipid extraction methods consist of a membrane disruption technique combined with a nonpolar solvent. <br><br> Quantitative data for lipid evaluation in phase 1 was collected through gravimetric means. Quantitative data for phase 2 was collected through fluorometric and gravimetric means. For gravimetric lipid evaluation, lipids were extracted with a cyclohexane-isopropyl alcohol solvent facilitated by ultrasonication. In addition, poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to analyze ACCase levels in algal samples. <br><br> This project determined that the optimal lipid extraction method for Scenedesmus sp. is DMSO-methanol solvent lipid extraction facilitated by ultrasonication. On average, this method produced a lipid yield of 54.8% (almost double the yield of the other methods). It was also determined that to meet the 25% relative lipid yield mark only 12.5% cyclohexane was necessary in a cyclohexane-isopropyl alcohol solvent. This has tremendous potential for cutting down costs because isopropyl alcohol is significantly less expensive than cyclohexane. Regarding nitrogen starvation, no conclusions were made regarding its impact on ACCase levels, however, it was discovered that nitrogen starvation plays a significant role in influencing chlorophyll "A" to chlorophyll "B" ratios, which in turn might have an effect on lipid yields.

THE EFFECT OF ELECTRIC FIELDS ON SOLAR POWER: EXPLORING A NEW MECHANISM FOR SOLAR CELLS
Kinga Janina Malkinska
Benjamin Franklin High School, New Orleans, LA

Solar power is an alternative source of “green” energy competing with hydropower, wind power and conventional energy resources (nuclear power and coal or crude oil combustion-based power). Success of future applications of solar cells strongly depends on their efficiency and affordability. Therefore, researchers and engineers are looking for new solutions which increase the efficiency and/or lower the cost of solar cells. All existing solid state solar cells use p-n junction between two semiconductors to generate solar power. The electric field present in the depletion zone prevents recombination of electrons and holes generated in the p-n junction by photons of the sunlight. This project proposes entirely new principle for generation of the photocurrent. The idea of replacing the field from the depletion zone by alternative sources of electric field in wide-gap semiconductor has been put into a test. These fields can be produced by pyroelectric films or by ferroelectric nanoparticles. Pyroelectric cadmium sulfide film with the thickness of 400 nm was deposited using magnetron sputtering method and it was coated by a conductive and transparent thin film electrode on both sides. The effects of the external electric field and intrinsic field in the pyroelectric CdS were investigated. The results confirmed hypothesis that external electric field can replace the field in the depletion zone. The lack of p-n junction in novel type solar cells with a single semiconductor will significantly simplify their technology and lower their cost. It is also expected that they will be capable of operating at higher voltage.

AN INVESTIGATION OF PHOTOVOLTAIC ENHANCEMENT METHODS, PHASE III
Lindsey Johnson
Weber High School, Pleasant View, UT

This experiment attempts to determine whether a watering system can be designed to increase the efficiency of a solar panel using water as a medium for cooling. By controlling the temperature of the panel, the output power can be controlled due to the electrical properties of the semiconductor material that makes up the solar cell. <br><br>In order to control the panel temperature, two watering systems were designed and mounted onto the back of the solar panel. Design #1 consisted of eight 360-degree misters spraying the back of the solar panel while Design #2 applied water via six 180-degree sprayers. As the panel temperature decreased, the panel temperature, time between each degree, and voltage across the resistor were recorded. The output power was then calculated at each temperature. <br><br>The data show that Design #1 was more efficient than Design #2. Both watering systems decreased the temperature of the solar panel from 50C to 15C, thus increasing the output power by about 700mW for a 1.5% gain in efficiency. Design #2 cooled the panel in 4 minutes and 20 seconds, a lesser amount of time compared to Design #1’s 5 minutes and 18 seconds. However, Design #1 performed the task using 4.94 gallons of water, whereas 6.06 gallons of water was used to cool the panel via Design #2.<br><br>In conclusion, the results of this experiment demonstrate that watering systems can be designed to decrease the temperature of the solar panel, thereby increasing the amount of energy produced.

OPTIMIZING THE UTILIZATION OF WIND ENERGY WITH AN ALTERNATIVE ENGINEERING DESIGN: A HORIZONTAL DUAL GENERATOR TURBINE
Caid Lunt
Orion Junior High School, Harrisville, UT

Wind turbines are an important energy source for the future. It’s estimated that if 20% of the world’s power came from wind by 2030, it would cut CO2 emissions by 825 million metric tons yearly. This project examined if an alternative, compact, more efficient turbine could be engineered to harness wind energy for production of power.<br><br>A turbine prototype with a single blade and dual generators was designed and engineered from fiberglass and carbon fiber materials. Tests were conducted using a wind tunnel at two different distances to determine the effectiveness of the new turbine design. The four measures used in the experimental design were: voltage generation, amperage generation, ability to sustain a resistive load, and a comparative study to a traditional turbine. <br><br>Using the new design the data indicated that at both distances amperage and voltage were generated at a higher rate with the new design. Two different wind velocities were compared with the control accounting for cross sectional area. The new design produced over twice the power of the traditional turbine. The turbine readily powered an LED load. A Confidence Interval was applied to the data and showed a statistical significance between the averages of the test groups.<br><br>The results are important because there is a need for a more efficient turbine design that can be used in residential and urban communities to generate clean energy.

HYGIENE ENERGY ROCKET OPTIMIZED III (HERO-III)
Erika Nicole Mueller
Syracuse Junior High, Syracuse, UT

The two-fold purpose of this rocket project was: optimize dynamic stability and improve launch performance in a redesign that leveraged rigid, lightweight materials, ballistics and balance. The 2009 HERO project investigated optimal launch angles for a 10-gram plastic rocket propelled by ignited common hygiene products; however, inherent instability produced inconsistent results. The 2010 project (HERO-II) focused on reliability and stability throughout the trajectory; however, the flexible rocket body and launch platform characteristics were inadequate. <br><br>Analysis of HERO-II failures pointed to erratic pressure release patterns at launch and unacceptable rocket body flex resulting in fin and guide tube separation. The HERO-III design used aluminum and weighed 16 grams. The launch platform was redesigned to improve guidance accuracy and minimize interference of the pressure release system. New hygiene fuels were tested and the launch switch was moved 1.5 meters away from the launch platform for safety. New rocket designs and launch concepts based on ballistics and rifling were also investigated; however none achieved the distance or accuracy of the simplistic, balanced rocket design in HERO-III.<br><br>Launch begins by spraying hygiene propellant into the rocket's open end, sliding the rocket onto the launch platform, and then pressing the 14kV piezoelectric switch to ignite the propellant, launching the rocket. A hygiene product based on water and dimethyl ether launched HERO-III over 1,000 centimeters from a 60 degree launch. This project could be implemented in schools using model rocketry as a learning tool, as it teaches elements of physics, engineering, and chemistry.

A BIOFUEL FOR THE POOR: LOCAL MANUFACTURE OF A COST-EFFECTIVE BIOFUEL TO IMPROVE RURAL ENERGY ACCESS
Yomna Yasser Mohamed
El Quadah Leaders American School, Giza, EGYPT

The focus of my project this year was to manufacture a cost effective quality biofuel in a rural local setting. First I investgated the production and manufacture of the two other required ingredients (Potassium Hydroxide [KOH], and methanol) for the biodiesel fuel solely from the "Jatropha plant”. The seed peel was crushed and burned to ashes, and two samples of the ashes were analyzed for their chemical content. The lab analysis showed that the raw Jatropha seed peel ash contained around 40% by weight of Potassium Oxide [K2O], while the prepared crystallized sample contained around 82% by weight of K2O, and hence the production of the second ingredient, KOH was secured. To produce methanol, methane production was investigated by fermenting the jatropha seed cake and agriculture waste, together with all the available animal and human manure. In the second part of this project, I researched the design of a simple and cost-effective plant to produce enough biodiesel fuel to satisfy the basic energy needs of a village with about 200 homes. A number of design features were added to reduce the parasitic energy losses of the plant. In addition to the production of biodiesel fuel, the plant has been designed to also produce glycerol and fertilizers for local use and cash generation.

DESIGN OF A HOME-SCALE BIOGAS DIGESTER/MICROBIAL FUEL CELL SYSTEM: COMBINING ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE
Katherine Rose Picchione
Academy of the Holy Names, Albany, NY

Energy is an incresingly necessary commodity in today's world. Two developing alternative energy sources are biogas and microbial fuel cells (MFCs). Biogas is methane gas (CH4) produced when organic matter decomposes in the absence of oxygen. MFC technology utilizes organic wastes to create electricity by harnessing electrons freed during microbial metabolic processes. Since biogas system infrastructure exists worldwide, and both technologies utilize organic waste, it is possible that MFCs can be implemented in the same settings. The purpose of this project was to assess the viability of a combined biogas/microbial fuel cell system created from consumer materials that can be used to generate small-scale energy. The system was built with a 55-gallon plastic drum, a steel stirring mechanism, and PVC fittings. A DataStudio data collection system was used to measure voltage and temperature throughout system use. The gas was analyzed with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), and bacteria in the slurry were inoculated and identified. Findings confirmed the hypothesis that it is possible to create both biogas and MFC current in the same system. The DataStudio system verified that small amounts of electric current were generated. GC/MS results documented the presence of methane in the biogas produced. Bacterial analyses identified Bacillus spp. saprophytes, which produce organic acids in initial decay that are essential to methanogenesis. The biogas and small amounts of current generated by this prototype system propose an option for alternative energy. Further research will lead to improvements to increase the energy output. This exploration into biogas and MFC compatibility opens doors to promote further energy independence and availability worldwide.

OPTIMIZATION OF NANOSCALE MORPHOLOGY OF ELECTRON DONOR-ACCEPTOR CHANNELS IN ORGANIC PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS
Eric Mario Metodiev
West Islip High School, West Islip, NY

Organic photovoltaic cells are a thin film technology that offers a more flexible and cost effective alternative to conventional silicon-based solar cells. The photoactive thin film layer of typical organic solar cells relies solely on randomly dispersed regions of the electron-donor polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and electron-acceptor nanoparticles of phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). This randomness leads to many inefficiencies associated with random dispersal, such as lack of pathway to the electrode and dead zones in the active layer. Polystyrene (PS) was explored as a means to order and structure the active layer components of organic photovoltaic cells through polymer self-assembly. With the addition of PS, nanoscale column formations of P3HT formed throughout the thin film layer. It was found that the PCBM nanoparticles migrated to the PS:P3HT polymer interface, forming shells around the P3HT columns. The two components formed electron donor-acceptor channels in the thin film. The formation of ordered electron donor-acceptor channels allows for the controlled nanoscale structuring of the active layer of organic solar cells. This nanoscale ordering of the active layer significantly reduces the inefficiency due to dead zones that plagued standard organic solar cells, reduces the materials cost by 33.3%, and increases the overall efficiency of the solar cell by 35%.

THE REVOLUTION OF SUPERSONIC TECHNOLOGY: IMPLEMENTING DIHEDRAL WINGLETS FOR PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION IN SUPERSONIC FLOW
Sumukh S. Bharadwaj
Capital High School, Olympia, WA

Living in a fast-paced society, the need for fast travel is becoming ubiquitous and this has been made possible through the implementation of supersonic airfoils in modern-day fighter jets. By improving the lift-to-drag ratio, it is possible to reduce the amount of energy needed to propel the aircraft, thus improving the efficiency and minimizing the fuel consumption. Until now the benefits of winglets, vertical protrusions at the tip of wings, have been observed to nullify the effects of vortices in subsonic flow, subsequently improving the efficiency. This project focuses on the implementation of winglets in supersonic airfoils. Using a 3D modeling software, 15 airfoils with varying toe and cant angles were designed. A Computational Fluid Dynamics program was used to simulate supersonic flow conditions upon these various airfoils while simultaneously varying the angles of attack, with each trial being about an hour long depending on the configuration. The average lift and drag outputs of the iterational results for each airfoil configuration provided quantitative results about the efficiency of the airfoils implemented with winglets. The results showed that the implementation of winglets in supersonic flow did in fact improve the efficiency, thus showing that they can be used to reduce fuel consumption.

The purpose of this project was to find out if the size of a Rochelle salt crystal influences the amount of electricity it produces.<br><br>The crystals were grown from seed crystals in a supersaturated solution of dissolved Rochelle salt. The holding mechanism was a clamp with aluminum foil taped onto its contact points. This clamp was also used to apply the mechanical stress to the crystal. The peak electrical outputs of the crystals were measured using a voltmeter.<br><br>Data were collected by placing a crystal between the two contact points. For the control, the 3.88 gram crystal was used because it was the closest to the average crystal mass of 4.00 grams. Each crystal was tested six times vertically and six times horizontally. Peak electrical output was measured after the voltmeter displayed a constant value and was recorded in millivolts. Data analysis consisted of averaging the six trials for each crystal and performing a linear regression to observe the correlation between size and voltage. A table and scatter plot were constructed for comparison purposes.<br><br>Visual examination of the results showed that large crystals sometimes produce more electricity than smaller ones. However, the results of the liner regression indicated a weak relationship between the amount of electricity produced and the mass of the crystal. Based on the results of this study, it appears that more electricity can be harvested from a bigger crystal under certain conditions.

REDUCING RISKS FROM THE LEFT-TURNING TENDENCY BY COMPUTING AND MEASURING P-FACTOR TORQUE, AND BY FLIGHT CONTROL TESTING TO INVENT THE AUTO-COMPENSATOR
Sehyun Hwang
Posung High School, Seoul, SOUTH KOREA

P-factor deviates an average propeller-driven airplane to the left without a pilot’s command. The P-Factor Torque Calculator(PTC) software was for mathematical interpretation of P-factor and the “wind tunnel test” was to measure it experimentally.]<br><br> I measured the rudder deflection requirement in the “flight control tests”, and based on that, the P-factor Auto-Compensator(PAC) was designed. Regarding P-factor as a quantitative torque, I programed the PTC to compute P-factor through a model. To validate this model, the wind tunnel was installed with the propeller-and-motor unit, where the P-factor was generated, acted on, and measured. The similar trends found through 1-to-1-comparing the data from both proved themselves valid. The 11×4 propeller spun at 10000 RPM at the sea level with the 50 degrees of an angle of attack produced 164 ounce-force inch of P-factor torque.<br><br> The flight control tests were to examine the manipulations of an airplane required to compensate the P-factor in the Flight Simulator. They could complement limits caused from the fact that rudder-produced aerodynamical torque compensates P-factor torque. The relationship between the P-factor torque and the rudder control was confirmed as a result. The Cessna 172 at 50 knots with the full power required 78% of rudder deflection.<br><br> P-factor can result in a dangerous spin, and had the airplane tail-numbered N960JB crashed, for example. Therefore, the errorless compensation must be made without delay not manually as today but by an automated system. I suggested the mechanical design of the PAC be utilized to prevent accidents induced from the left-turn-inducing P-factor.

DIRECTING AND ACCELERATING NATURAL AIRFLOWS TO INCREASE AIRFOIL CIRCULATION AND GENERATE MORE LIFT
Lauren Heather Reid
O'Neill Collegiate & Vocational Institute, Oshawa, Ontario, CANADA

An airfoil causes circulation, or a circular flow of air, as it generates lift. As circulation increases, more lift is generated which can reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gases, and noise levels with steeper departures. This research designed airfoil modifications to increase circulation in low-speed air without compromising performance in high-speed air. The modifications were intended to direct and accelerate the ‘natural’ airflows to improve the pressure differential, and create a stronger down-wash, generating more lift. Tests were conducted on GOE 478 airfoils mounted at a 12-degree angle of attack. A boundary layer wind tunnel was adapted to laminar flow for the tests and observations. The airflow velocity and direction were precisely measured at 112 measurement volumes (‘locations’) in low-speed (4 m/s) and high-speed (9 m/s) airflows. The leading edge venturi (“LEV”) test airfoil improved the dynamic pressure at 91% of the measurement volumes in low-speed (77% high-speed) compared to the unmodified Standard (“STD”) airfoil. All other airfoils ranged between 30% and 68%. The LEV increased the pressure differential change by 7.87% compared to the unmodified STD while the “Blunt” leading edge test airfoil improved it by 3.69%. The differential worsened with all other airfoils. Surprisingly, the LEV airfoil did not compromise the pressure differential in hi-speed airflow. Instead, it increased it significantly. Therefore, the LEV airfoil would improve lift in both low and high-speed airflows. Commercial passenger planes burn 35 billion gallons of fuel each year and generate 345 billion kilograms of carbon. A reduction of 7.87% is important.

IRRADIATION BASED SINGLE STAGE ELECTRO-OXIDATION FOR NOVEL ENHANCEMENT OF DIRECT METHANOL FUEL CELLS
Dheevesh Arulmani
Gordon Graydon Memorial Secondary School, Mississauga, Ontario, CANADA

The direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) exhibits future environmental and economic feasibility as an alternative energy source; however, low power densities presently limit its practicality. This poor performance can be attributed to the high activation energy caused by the complexity of the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in the DMFC anode. The innovative concept developed in this research utilizes irradiation to create a novel single stage oxidation that circumvents these complex MOR mechanisms. To facilitate this reaction, an irradiation sensitive titanium dioxide anatase was alloyed with the catalyst to produce transient hydroxyl radicals upon illumination. The electronegativity differences then split the methanol’s intramolecular bonds and directly yielded the final products of the MOR in a single stage reaction. This substantially decreased the activation energy and exponentially enhanced DMFC power density outputs. Performance was electrochemically characterized utilizing a three electrode half-cell and a bipotentiostat. Analysis of oxidation kinetics indicated remarkable enhancements in current densities of up to 2,457% with the platinum ruthenium catalyst while the onset potential was favourably reduced by up to 347.8 mV with a platinum titanium dioxide catalyst. Experimentation with various methanol concentrations and flux rates demonstrated further enhancements in system efficiency, higher catalyst durability, higher fuel utilization efficiencies, and lower operating costs. A 25-fold enhancement in power output exemplifies the large-scale feasibility of these novel irradiation sensitive DMFCs with sunlight as the irradiation source. These innovative DMFCs can lead to the universal acceptance of the environmentally sustainable fuel cell energy infrastructure.

A ZERO FUEL CAR
Robert Eugene Vaerewyck
Saint Joseph High School, Natrona Heights, PA

Economic development requires the ability to participate in the world economy and this requires the transportation of both people and goods. But transportation has an enormous impact environmentally in fuel usage and fueling infrastructure, as well as the associated pollution. There are major issues with using fossil fuels for transportation; environmental damage during extraction, expensive infrastructure, pollution, and diminishing supplies. <br><br> The two main options for renewable energy for transportation are biofuels or electricity from wind, solar or hydo. Biofuels require expensive infrastructure, frequently compete for food stuffs, but use engine technology currently available. Electricity requires an extensive power distribution grid and heavy batteries. An ideal solution would be to generate the energy needed on the vehicle. Anyone who has walked on asphalt in the summertime knows how hot it can become. This is a tremendous source of stored solar energy. <br><br> I developed a car which can be used in desert and equatorial regions to move people at bicycle speeds, without fuel, by harnessing the solar energy captured by pavement. Since the energy is stored in the pavement, there are no batteries or fuel tanks required allowing the vehicle to be very lightweight. This is a truly zero pollution, renewable energy vehicle that has virtually no environmental footprint.

THE POWER OF MUD: AN ANALYSIS OF POSSIBLE BACTERIAL ALTERNATIVE ENERGY DERIVED FROM HUMBOLDT RIVER MUD
Claudia Nicole Dennler
Pershing County High School, Lovelock, NV

The purpose of this research was to determine if a viable output of methane could be produced in conjunction with a functioning 12 V Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) from mud extracted from the Humboldt River. From background research and observation, it was hypothesized that this mud would produce methane and electricity. From one site, 24 samples of 8 possible solutions were set up, and gas release was recorded every other day for three weeks. The solution containing diatomaceous earth and newspaper and the solution containing newspaper were deemed to be the most efficient methane producers. They also displayed the greatest longevity of methane production. Data were analyzed with one way ANOVA, and the ingredients used constituted for a significant difference in methane and oxygen production. These results were verified through a second trial with sources from the original site and two others. In addition, voltage produced from the anaerobic microorganisms in the mud was recorded and used to construct an 8 Volt MFC, which powered both an LED and a calculator. Later on, electrodes were coated in carbon with a reaction between sugar and sulfuric acid in order to provide a larger surface area for electron transfer. These electrodes were used in a six cell series of mud with newspaper to optimize electrical output, and the resulting 12 V MFC had constant production for 5 days and was still producing 8 V after 26 days. A more efficient system is currently in production, and testing will continue.

Criteria are: i) properties; ii) performance; iii) calculated economics and logistics; and iv) calculated carbon emissions.<br><br>Based upon physical and chemical properties (viscosity; freeze/melt point; density; pH), castor, coconut, and palm oils were eliminated. However, all bio-diesels, including those of eliminated oils, proved viable, though coconut and palm diesels are constrained to serving as warm weather fuels.<br><br>Remaining fuels were evaluated for energy efficiency relative to petro-diesel using a diesel generator. Measured baseline of 130 grams petro-diesel consumed during a timed test was converted to a base of 17.9 km/L. Fuel efficiency of petro-diesel was followed by camelina and its bio-diesel at 16.5 and 16.6 km/L, then avocado and its bio-diesel at 16.2 and 16.3 km/L. These were followed by remaining bio-diesels, with the worst performance by castor bio-diesel at a still respectable 14.6 km/L.<br><br>Ultimately, for four oils, conversion to bio-diesel was an improvement in physical characteristics and performance. Camelina was the exception. Also, though trans-esterification of camelina and avocado proved economically unjustified, these oils, along with all five bio-diesels, were found to be superior to petro-diesel in terms of environmental impact, and competitive with petro-diesel when measured on $/km basis. Furthermore, it was found that these can be produced to scale to be a measurable component of the total U.S. and global energy supply.<br><br>

BEYOND THE NANOSTRUCTURE IN SOLAR CELLS
Shyamal Buch
Vista del Lago High School, Folsom, CA

Optimizing nanostructure morphology is key to improving solar cell efficiency. However, nanostructure film thickness remains limited by electron diffusion. Recently, there has been significant interest in plasmonic solar cells. In this work, metal nanoparticles were integrated with a semiconductor and resulting solar cell performance characteristics were analyzed. Charge recombination is a leading cause of efficiency loss. A study was performed on the impact of metal nanoparticles on recombination. The facile synthesis process was shown to work with direct substitution of additional reactants. An alternate growth method was developed and shown to be a viable approach with the advantage of considerably shorter synthesis time. Charge-carrier lifetime measurements were performed by D-SCOPEn+ with novel recombination analysis software. Improved performance with integration of metal nanoparticles could potentially be explained by effects such as surface plasmon resonance. The synthesis process is low-cost, uses environmentally benign materials, and no specialized equipment, and is therefore well-suited for sustainable solar cell production.

AIRFOIL SURFACE TEXTURES
Winthrop Irving Townsend
Windsor High School, Windsor, VT

The purpose of this experiment was to test the effects of surface textures of airplane wings on their efficiencies. In the past it was a common understanding that smooth textures are the most efficient in all aspects of aerodynamics. Throughout the evolution of the airplane wings, many engineers have played around with the shape and size of an airplane wing and not their textures. Looking at a golf ball I hypothesized that texturing a wing in the form of dimpling might have a positive impact on the efficiency of the wing. To test my hypothesis I created three different airfoils. One was covered in sawdust to simulate ice, another was smooth, and the third was dimpled to simulate the golf ball effect. I then created a contraption that I could mount on my car and measure the lift and drag of the airfoil. I proceeded to drive down the road at different speeds and angles of attack, measuring lift and drag. Over a variety of angles and speeds, the lift over drag ratio of the dimpled wing was consistently better and outperformed the rough and smooth wings in all aspects of the test. Due to this my hypothesis was supported; dimpling a wing will cause it to be more efficient.

IT'S ALL IN THE FUEL
Tyler Gordon Toepke-Floyd
Wishek Public School, Wishek, ND

My project purpose was to test the amount of harmful emissions from the combustion of fuel as an engine warms from a cold start. I tested whether regular unleaded gasoline, an ethanol blend, or high octane fuel changed the concentration of these emissions. I also tested which fuel produces the highest amount of carbon monoxide. I used a 400cc engine, a GCMS, and a CO detector to examine the samples.<br><br> Procedure: 1.) I ran a preliminary run to find the proper times to takes samples according to temperature. 2.) At selected temperatures, I took samples from the tail pipe in 2 mL glass vials. 3.) I repeated this process with 3 different fuels. 4.) I analyzed the samples in a GCMS. <br><br> The results weren’t clear in that the GCMS couldn’t identify any traces of toxic substances in the samples. I repeated the test using a different sampling technique. I didn’t test ethanol again due to complications in first test. Again the GCMS showed no results. I repeated the test 2 more times using a CO detector instead. <br><br> I found my hypothesis was partly correct. I was correct in thinking high octane fuel would burn hotter than the other fuels. I wasn’t able to find which fuel gave off the greatest amount of toxic emissions. I thought regular gasoline would have the greatest amount of CO but actually the high octane fuel had more. I thought the amount of CO would drop as temperature increased but it actually increased with temperature.

A NOVEL SOLAR CELL COMBINING COORDINATED METAL ION SUBSTITUTION AND SELF-ASSEMBLY TO BROADEN THE ABSORPTION SPECTRUM AND EFFICIENTLY TRANSFORM LIGHT ENERGY INTO ELECTRICITY
Nathan Sai Kondamuri
Munster High School, Munster, IN

In a time when depletion of fossil fuels is a major threat to our planet, I am researching a solution to Earth’s energy crisis that entails bio-mimicry and the possibility of copying plants to harvest solar energy through photosynthesis. Observing how plants transform light energy into electrons with 99% efficiency, I asked the question, why can’t photosynthesis be mimicked in a biofuel cell to efficiently create electricity? Instead of using synthetic chemicals, which merely mimic a pigment’s absorption properties (used in past artificial photosynthesis research), my novel approach uses the porphyrin rings from natural pigments themselves for a plant's light absorption, charge separation, and electron transfer properties. In Phase 1 of my research, I have extracted the porphyrin rings present in pigment molecules. I have broadened the range of absorbance for this system by varied metalation (inserting different metals into the center) of these porphyrinic compounds under heterogeneous insertion procedures. In phase 2, I achieved the self-assembly of these porphyrin molecules. I then combined the various metalloporphyrins and coated all of them onto one silicon wafer cell to take advantage of the broadened absorption spectrum. In phase 3, of my research I improved the electron transfer properties of the cell by attaching phenol groups to the porphyrin ring, which repelled electrons. This was done in order to inhibit electrons from jumping in between porphyrin rings. This cell’s increased efficiency of 56% and its more affordable price compared to existing solar cells make it a viable option to the world.

EFFECT OF CHEMICAL INDUCTION ON THE DIRECT CONVERSION OF CELLULOSE TO AVIATION BIOFUELS BY FUNGI GLIOCLADIUM SPECIES
Sathvik Ramanan
Hanford High School, Richland, WA

Considerable focus is being directed towards the development of sustainable and carbon neutral energy sources to meet the increasing demand in world energy consumption. Endophytic fungi belonging to the genus Gliocladium are able to degrade plant cellulose and synthesize directly complex hydrocarbons (C7-C12) under microaerophilic conditions. These fungi could thus be used to produce aviation biofuels from cellulosic feedstocks without the need for hydrolytic pretreatments. In this study Gliocladium roseum (1165) is co-cultivated with Escherichia coli on oatmeal substrate using different amino acids as hydrocarbon inducers under microaerophilic conditions. The fungus efficiently produced different hydrocarbons which were analyzed using Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-solid-phase micro-extraction (GC-MS-SPME). Identification of the fungal products was based on observed mass spectral data of NIST database library. Hydrocarbon production varied from each culture conditions but was found to be higher in amino acids fortified condition. Concentration of hydrocarbons was calculated using authentic standards. Increase in concentration of hydrocarbons ranged from 85 to 4145 percent in amino acids fortified condition. <br><br>Cellulose represents an attractive feedstock for biofuels production because of its abundance, cost and ability to be converted directly by fungus gliocladium to hydrocarbons. This research is uniquely poised to deliver nation’s aviation biofuel demand in a cost effective timeline. Identifying metabolic pathways and improving fermentation technology will open doors to advanced biofuels that can power everything from fighter jets to commercial airliners.

IMPROVEMENT IN CROSSWIND LANDING BY THE USE OF HOLONOMIC LANDING GEAR
Walter Emerson Czerwinski Burkard
Manlius Pebble Hill School, Dewitt, NY

Optimization of touchdown in a crosswind, by applying the principle of holonomics to the landing gear, offers vast improvement to airplane safety and maneuverability. In a traditional slip landing, the pilot must align the plane to the runway before the wheels touch the ground. This creates drifting of the plane across the runway due to the crosswind, increasing the risk of accidents. According to the Air Safety Institute’s 2010 Nall Report, more than half of landing accidents were the result of directional control and a third were blamed on gusts and crosswinds. Holonomic landing gear ideally would allow the pilot to maintain the slip beyond touchdown, eliminating possible drift and instability of the plane in a crosswind.<br><br><br>Over the last year I have been training to become a pilot. The purpose of this experiment was to improve safety in crosswind situations by redesigning the landing gear. Comparisons were made using standard and holonomic landing gear with a model airplane simulating a crosswind landing configuration. Data was collected using the xSensor app to document accelerometer data as the ‘black box’ for the plane. <br><br><br> The results showed a pilot could maintain the slip through touchdown and avoid the plane pitching uncontrollably with the holonomic landing gear. Standard landing gear caused the plane to side-load and crash if the slip was maintained.<br><br><br>This project proved that holonomic landing gear would allow the pilot to maintain the slip at touchdown and potentially increase landing safety in commercial and military applications.

A STUDY OF THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF NON-EQUILIBRIUM PLASMA IN GAS TURBINE ENGINES TO ENHANCE COMBUSTION
Felipe Gomez del Campo
Cypress Bay High School, Weston, FL

Annually Jet powered aircraft burn over 80 million gallons of aviation fuel at a cost of $5 per gallon in order to generate thrust. The efficiency of this process is dependent on the speed of the combustion reaction. By increasing the rate of combustion, leaner mixtures can be combusted at higher flow rates, which results in liberating more energy per unit of fuel, therefore increasing the efficiency of combustion as well as flame stability. A jet engine combustor was constructed with a 17 KHz plasma at an amplitude of 15Kv generated in the fuel flow. Industry standard parameters used to measure the performance of jet engines, such as Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT), dynamic exhaust gas pressure and the heat released in combustion were monitored, while the power delivered to the plasma exciter circuit, the flow rate, and the amount of fuel in the mixture were varied. Recording EGT as a function of time, it was experimentally determined that in a cold air flow of 5 m/s, a lean flame without the injection of plasma extinguished immediately (manifested as a rapid drop in EGT), but when plasma was injected into the combustion chamber, no flow rate achievable with the experimental set-up was able to extinguish the flame. Moreover, at the maximum plasma discharge power, a flame was stabilized at an equivalence ratio of 0.5 as compared to 0.6 for the control without the addition of plasma; this represents a 10% fuel savings at the lean flammability limit. It was additionally shown that with a plasma energy less than 3% of the heat released in the combustion chamber, a 62.5% increase in heat evolved at the highest flow rates, and a 5% increase in heat evolved at the flow rate where the maximum value of heat evolved occurred was observed.

ALGAE TO OIL IN A THREE STEP WET PROCESS
Evie Sobczak
Shorecrest Preparatory School, St. Petersburg, FL

Manufacturing algae biofuel is plagued with obstacles preventing it from being a viable fuel source. The objective was to produce an environmentally-friendly, cost-competitive biofuel by engineering equipment and designing methods that refine all three phases of algae oil production. To enhance Spirogyra’s growth, a red light spectrum photo-bioreactor(RLS-PBR)was designed using dispersive prisms. A closed loop CO2 injection chamber was built for monitoring consumption. Fe+2 was added as a growth elixir, aggregate facilitator and CO2 absorber. Chemically-free ionic flocculation was developed for dewatering, and an ultrasonic vacuum chamber was engineered to extract lipids in a single wet-step process.<br><br>For comparison, Spirogyra was cultivated in two fabricated vessels; one encased in RLS-PBR, engineered to separate and focus the red light spectrum, another in a visible light spectrum photo-bioreactor(VLS-PBR). Both were air agitated and infused with 650 ppms of CO2 and 3 grams of Fe+2 for increased proliferation. After cultivation, the solution was ionicly flocculated by exploiting Fe+2, a cation, to attract algae, in an electrostatic polymeric bond. This ionic interaction produced Fe3O2 which bridged the algae's cell walls producing a floc with an efficiency rating of 72% without solvents or carbon energy. <br><br>Hemacytometer results showed algae cultivated in RLS-PBR grew 32% more than algae in VLS-PBR. CO2 airborne monitoring confirmed algae in RLS-PBR consumed 16% more CO2 than VLS-PBR. Ionic flocculation revealed RLS-PBR floc had a volume of 33.9cm³ versus VLS-PBR floc of 23.9cm³, a 29% growth rate difference confirming the hemacytometer results. The ultrasonic vacuum chamber produced cavitation that shredded the cell membrane,while the vacuum eased the release of lipids.

Next, while the bagasse is still hot, stir a mixture of beeswax and palmwax into it. Then, pour the bagasse mixture into a 14 inch pvc pipe. Compress the bagasse using a homeade glue gun compressor. Once the bagasse is pressed to its full extent, let it sit for 30 minutes. After this time period, extract the newly formed bagasse log from the pipe. The bagasse log is now ready to be burned in a fireplace or used in a barbeque pit for cooking.<br><br>Results: According to my results, it was possible to create heating/cooking logs from bagasse that burned comparitively to commercial brands, burned efficiently, and was environmentally friendly. <br><br>Conclusion: I proved my hypothesis to be correct. I was able to create a bagasse heating/cooking log that burned cleanly and can be used as an alternative resource.

WIND: A NEW SPIN ON THINGS
Caleb Kyle Meyer
Hope-Page Public School, Hope, ND

The purpose of my experiment was to determine if a tri-blade design is the best design for small wind turbines, or if there is a more powerful design that is available. I went about this task by constructing different combinations of blade type, count, and hub size to cover many possibilities. I built three different sizes of hubs, two, eight, and eleven inch radius hubs. The two inch size had three, five, and twelve blade variations. The eight and eleven inch hubs each had a five, twelve, twenty-four, and forty-eight side variation. All blade designs were equipped with the same wing cross section, but it was scaled to fit each hub. Also, all blades were tested with a leading edge similar to the flipper of a humpback whale to try to increase performance. All designs were tested inside a two-foot diameter foam cowling, which was mounted inside a four-foot square wind tunnel. This tunnel was mounted with two different fans to achieve two different wind speeds for testing and all blades were tested at three different angles. The designs and hubs were mounted on a threaded rod, which was then attached to a generator. Output was read in volts and amps, which were multiplied by one another to find power in watts. Hubs were rated by the amount of power they produced. The results showed that the five blade two inch hub design with a whale edge was the best for my setup, as it generated the most power.

WIND LENS INNOVATION: MAXIMIZING WIND TURBINE EFFICIENCY
Justin Ngo
Copper Hills High School, West Jordan, UT

As natural resources deplete, renewable green energy is in high demand. Wind energy is an extraordinary source of energy that is both highly sustainable and clean. The only drawback to wind energy is its low benefit (efficiency) to cost ratio, but significantly increasing wind energy’s efficiency would make this sustainable energy source more economically viable. Thanks to the new wind lens system, wind turbine power output can increase 2-5 times, increasing its efficiency. Due to the technological infancy, the wind lens system has not been utilized to its fullest potential. The existing wind lens utilizes one brim diffuser which creates Karman vortices to increase the incoming velocity of the wind that goes through the diffuser. In order to determine which wind lens design increased efficiency the most, the conventional wind turbine, the wind lens wind turbine, and eight other originally innovative designs of the wind lens, were tested with a 17.5 centimeter blade radius wind turbine fifteen times each and recorded with Logger Pro 3.8.4 for average power output over thirty seconds. The original design, reversed wind lens thirteen centimeter diffuser, produced 40% more power than the model wind lens with 51% efficiency. Reversing the wind lens technology to generate the Karman vortices earlier allows the vortices to gain strength, forcing the wind through the diffuser increasing power output. Wind turbines with this innovation will have a higher benefit to cost ratio making wind energy economically attractive and can also provide United States 26.6 billion megawatts energy needs alone.

KENAF PLANT : A GREEN SOURCE OF ENERGY
Wan Muhammad Syafiq Bin Wan Mohd Zairuddin
Mara Junior Science College Taiping, Taiping, Perak, MALAYSIA

Kenaf or Hibiscus cannabinus L , is a tropical fibercrop closely related to cotton and jute. Kenaf core fibre has the potential to absorb domestic cooking oil waste. This project was carried out to find the best type of sample to absorb highest percentage of oil waste and to produce an environmental energy that is Kenaf pallet. In the processes, Kenaf sample in powder form was separated into two sizes, 355 µm and 125 µm. Each size was tested for absorption of waste cooking oil, burn test and thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) test. Results show that Kenaf sample in 125 µm with water absorbs 86.24% of oil compared to 355 µm which is 84.96%. This is due to the ability of 125µm sample that is more porous and has a higher surface area. The experiment without water from 125 µm sample also shown the highest percentage of oil absorption by 99.83% . Kenaf pallet produced from 125 µm can burn longer compared to 355 µm . Results show that Kenaf pallet produced using 125 µ metre by 0.5 g can burn on average of 6 min compared to 355 µm that is 5 min. Other than that, the thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) test indicates less volatile matter produced by Kenaf pallet than charcoal by 11.30 %. In conclusion, Kenaf can be used as a model to solve oil spill problems and a source of green energy towards a better environment in the future.

PRODUCTION OF HYDROGEN GAS FROM C. REINHARDTII
Priya Renee Kirtley
Terre Haute South Vigo High School, Terre Haute, IN

To combine my love for biology and my concern for environmental issues, I chose a project based on Chlamydomonas reinhardtii,a photosynthetic algae with alternative photosynthesis pathways which can produce hydrogen gas. I strove to find alternative means of producing an environmentally-friendly method of producing hydrogen in order to ultimately power a fuel cell. My hypothesis was that when deprived of sulfur, C. Reinhardtii will produce hydrogen gas. To test this, I set up two systems: a control system that grew algae in a normal growth medium, and an experimental system that had a sulfur-deprived growth medium. I measured the amount of gas produced by each utilizing an improved apparatus and took data twice every day for a set interval of time. My data demonstrated that my hypothesis was correct, and the algae did produce hydrogen when deprived of sulfur. Future steps for this project include investigating other methods of producing hydrogen from this algae (such as introducing copper into the system), selecting the most efficient method, and then building a sustainable bio-reactor that supplies hydrogen for a working fuel cell.

THE EFFECT OF VARIOUS OILS ON THE ENERGY CONTENT OF BIODIESEL
Louise Giesey White
Wilson High School, Florence, SC

Biodiesel is the environmentally friendly substitute for diesel and can be made from different varieties of vegetable oils. This project tests various oils to calculate which variety (sunflower, soybean, corn or used vegetable oil) would produce the highest energy in British Thermal units per gram (BTU/g) as compared to diesel fuel. Sunflower oil was expected to produce the greatest BTU/g due to its low relative density while still having unsaturated bonds. Each oil was made into biodiesel using potassium hydroxide and methanol, and the biodiesel was burned in a home made bomb calorimeter to determine the BTU/g. The temperature increase of the water in the bomb calorimeter as well as the mass change of the oil were recorded to determine the BTU/g. After testing the biodiesel, the data supported the hypothesis that sunflower oil would produce the highest BTU/g. Sunflower oil was followed by the soybean and corn oil with used vegetable oil having the lowest energy content. Diesel was also tested in the bomb calorimeter, and it was found that the sunflower biodiesel had a higher BTU/g than the diesel while soybean oil had an equal energy content. This data can be extremely helpful in determining which oil is the best substitute for diesel as fuel. Further research should be done to find which is the best economical and environmental substitute, but the data does support biodiesel as a suitable replacement for diesel fuel as it can have equal or greater energy emission.

THE EFFECT OF HEAT COMBUSTION AND DENSITY ON THE BEST FUEL FOR BIODIESEL PRODUCTION IN HAWAII
April-Joy Baldado McCann
Mililani High School, Mililani, HI

My ambition was to see which biodiesel fuel (Algae, Corn, Canola, Peanut and Vegetable) would be a cheap, efficient fuel to create and use by testing the density and heat of combustion. First, I grew Algae at home and extracted the oil by drying it and using a homemade press. This was followed by transesterification. During this process, the oil was purified using an alcohol like methanol and a catalyst such as lye, which then separates the glycerin and methyl esters (biodiesel) from each other. The remaining liquid is biodiesel. This process was used for the other oils. I hypothesized that Algae would have the highest density/heat of combustion because Algae although very light can produce a lot of oil. After performing this experiment, these were the following results. Algae average density was 0.77 compared to the other oils such as peanut that was 0.97 followed by Corn at 0.87, Canola at 0.65 and Vegetable at 0.62. There average heat of combustion was Veg. 56.32 g/mL˚, Corn 32.61 g/mL˚, Canola 24.7 g/mL˚, Peanut 43.06 g/mL˚ and Algae with 12.14 g/mL˚. These results show that Algae is not the densest/highest heat of combustion, not supporting my hypothesis. I also did a cost analysis where Algae was the cheapest. Throughout the experiment, there were also several errors. I tested at different times, effecting the results. In conclusion, peanut was the most proficient fuel however because Algae is the cheapest, it would be the best fuel to use for biodiesel in Hawaii.

OBTAINING FATTY ACID METHYL ESTER (BIODIESEL) FROM TEREBINTH (PISTACIA TEREBINTHUS L.), A WILD PLANT, THROUGH TRANSESTERIFICATION OF ITS FRUIT OIL
Ahmet Faruk Erdem
Private Fatih High School, Istanbul, Maramara, TURKEY

The world meets its energy needs from fossil origin resources. However, these resources are limited and they affect the environment negatively; moreover, they will run out in the near future. Therefore, there has been a quest for various alternative fuels. The variety of new and renewable energy resources has increased; some of them have become valuable as economical alternatives; some of them have been analyzed in terms of economy and new energy resources appear day by day. The most common aspect of almost all of these resources is that they do not harm the environment in the short run and in the long run. <br><br> Terebinth is a species of wild-growing shrub in the Mediterranean (Cyprus, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria Greece and Canary Islands), Western Asia and Turkey. In this study, biodiesel was produced from terebinth oil, which is not a classical oil, through transesterification. The moisture content (ppm), density, kinematic viscosity and the caloric value (41,31) of the biodiesel that was obtained were measured. The higher caloric value compared to other biodiesels proved that terebinth could be used in order to obtain biodiesel. In conclusion, growing or using Pistacia terebinthus L. will contribute to our economy based on agriculture. We received support from Yildiz Technical University Faculty of Chemistry-Metallurgy for the measurements in this research. <br><br> <br><br>

Ohood Ali Almutairi
Rawd Alsalheen School, Kuwait, KUWAIT

While the electric demand in Gulf Cooperation Council countries is increasing due to technological developments and population growth, conventional fossil-fuel reserves continue to diminish and environmental concerns such as harmful emissions and global climate change continue to increase due to burning conventional fuels. Therefore, renewable power generation such as solar energy has gained a great research interest to substitute the conventional energy resources. In this project the feasibility of utilizing solar energy in GCC countries has been thoroughly researched and it is found that for the average area of 10,000 m2 of a typical school, it will cost $9,450,000 to generate 2810 MWh/year of solar power.

MANUFACTURING OF SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELLS
Joseph Gabriel Gapuz, Alexander Mestre, 
Lake Highland Preparatory School, Orlando, FL

With a limited supply of oil, the United States is currently attempting to diversify its energy sources. Many alternate fuel source systems have been theorized. One technology that shows promise is fuel cells. Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) are a particular type of fuel cell. Their ceramic based components set them apart from other fuel cells because they allow the cell to work at a theoretical efficiency of around 80%. This high efficiency is matched with much adversity due to their brittleness, non-standardized manufacturing techniques, and their lack of compatibility with other experimental materials. The goal of this project was to produce a practical SOFC that could entice more SOFC research. After last year's research, an electrolyte material and a cathode material were examined in greater detail. Electrolyte materials were molded and sintered for mechanical testing, where residual stress and warp were then measured. The simplified manufacturing techniques of tape casting and ball-milling were used to create the electrolyte test samples and the cathode test samples respectively. The effect of sintering the electrolyte and cathode materials at 1000C to 1200C effectively created structurally homogoneous test samples. These processes optimized production, which will make mechanical testing simpler for experimental materials. Mechanically, durability and theoretical efficiency was increased according to compatibility with other fuel cell constituents, in terms of porosity, tensile strength, and thermal expansion as well as stress fracture and warp.

PURPOSE-BUILT ELECTRIC VEHICLE
Sage A. Trudeau, Dominic H Mills, Travis D Taylor
Seabury Hall, Makawao, HI

The purpose of this project was to design and create an electric vehicle from the ground up in order to maximize the potential that electric vehicles have to offer. The vehicle design immerged from the idea of combining a gem car with a motorcycle in order to minimize weight and thus increase potential range. The vehicle was then built from an aluminum frame and fitted with a fiberglass body to increase maneuverability and aerodynamics. The vehicle is powered by 10 Lithium Iron Phosphate modules that in their 40 cells carry a combined nominal voltage of 134V when fully charged. These provide 100 amp hours of energy combined with the low weight of only 875lbs, to achieve a projected range of 120 miles. This exceptionally low weight also causes this vehicle to have a weight to power ration of 17.5lbs/HP, nearly 10lbs/HP better than the Toyota Prius, and equivalent or better than many of the leading electric vehicles on the market today.

THE MEDIATOR-LESS MICROBIAL FUEL CELL: USED IN REMEDIATION OF OIL AND GAS WELL WASTE-WATER
Matthew Joseph Detmer, Kachina Ganz, 
Piedra Vista High School, Farmington, NM

A mediator-less microbial fuel cell (MFC) was tested to determine it could effectively remove ionic salts from oil and gas well wastewater while producing electricity in order to assess the practicality of using MFC technology in the remediation of wastewater produced in the oil and gas extraction industry.<br><br> The hypothesis was that if oil and gas well wastewater samples are treated using a mediator-less microbial fuel cell designed specifically for anion and cation filtering, then ionic salts within the samples will be significantly removed. In addition, electricity will be produced during the cleansing in significant quantity to eventually power the entire process.<br><br> The previous year’s model was altered to include a second single cell MFC. One cell was constructed to filter cations, the other anions. Two samples of oil and gas wastewater were diluted with distilled water and processed by the system while electrical output was measured. Each sample was tested at three stages throughout the process to measure changes in ionic content. A third sample containing much higher salt levels was similarly processed only without measurement of electrical output. Ionic measurements of all three test samples showed similar significant reduction in the ionic content of the wastewater. <br><br>As the tested samples all resulted in ionic salt reductions, and the cells produced appropriate amounts of electricity, the hypothesis was shown to be correct.

The purpose of this study was to develop paint capable of harvesting solar energy. Three paints were fabricated in correspondence with the structure of a thin-film solar cell. The layers of the solar cell are: the back lead, p-type, n-type, and front lead. To create a circuit, a wire connected the back lead to the front lead. Aluminum formed the back lead, the semiconductor CIGS formed the p-type, and ZnO:Al formed both the n-type and front lead.<br><br>The procedure was subdivided into the following categories: preliminary trials, glass trials and concrete trials. The preliminary trials were conducted on a glass substrate and determined the optimal concentration of ZnO:Al. The glass trials, also conducted on a glass substrate, determined the optimal concentration of CIGS. When the optimal concentrations of both ZnO:Al and CIGS were resolved, the “superior” paint was applied to a concrete substrate.<br><br>A sensor was used to measure the voltage, current, and power output of each concentration. For the preliminary trials, the least concentration of ZnO:Al yielded the greatest power due to the formation of undesirable ligands. The greatest concentration of CIGS yielded the greatest power, but the second highest concentration was deemed optimal due to financial concerns. When applied to a concrete substrate, the power output of the “superior” paint decreased by 18%. To enhance these results, the paint’s durability was evaluated. Exposure to hostile environments significantly reduced its power output.<br><br>If financially viable, a successful solar energy-harvesting paint could coat roadways across the nation.

PIPE DREAM? EXPLORING THE PRACTICALITY OF ENERGY RECOVERY FROM THE INERTIA OF WASTEWATER
Joel Douglas Crozier, Austin Bischoff, 
Whiteford High School, Ottawa Lake, MI

The world needs to find more ways to produce clean energy. The inertia of wastewater that flows through pipes daily provides an opportunity to create electricity directly within a home or business; however, no serious attempts have been made (to our knowledge) to take advantage of such an opportunity. This project hypothesizes that a single waterwheel placed in a drainage pipe, such as that exiting a toilet, could produce enough electricity to offset its production and installation costs.<br><br> A model was developed to explore this idea. The 12”, 5-paddle Plexiglas waterwheel was housed in a steel and Plexiglas box. The water release system consisted of a bucket, two sections of 2” pvc pipe, and a 2” ball valve. Water exited the bucket through the valve and turned the waterwheel and axle. This turned a sprocket, which turned a chain, which turned a second sprocket and axle. This axle turned a third gear, which lifted a chain and weight. Potential power output was calculated using equations involving downward force, distance lifted, and time. Independent variables were flow rate, duration of flow, and drop distance.<br><br> The relationships between each variable and potential wattage output were modeled with separate functions and an inclusive equation. While these functions proved fairly accurate, the calculated potential savings of such a system were negligible; therefore, the main premise of the hypothesis was not supported. However, such a system could theoretically be practical if flow rate, drop height, and/or flow volume were increased significantly.

USING DEAD SEA SALT AND FRESNAL LENS IN CONCENTRATING SOLAR POWER TO PRODUCE CONTINUOUS ELECTRICITY
Ayman Moh'd Amin AlRazem, Mothanna Moh'd Najeh Almegdad, 
Jubilee School, Amman, JORDAN

Problem: Many countries use fossil fuels as a source to generate electricity. However, these sources are non-renewable and will not last forever. Moreover; in the last period the prices of these fuels started to rise in an extreme way, which raised the prices of electricity and encumbered the budget of citizens with low income, that involved searching for efficient renewable sources to generate electricity, and one of the most important renewable sources is solar power. Objective: Therefore, this project uses Fresnel lens and mirrors in heating dead Sea salt to generate electricity. Research question: Could this project produce continuous electrical current using dead sea salt and Fresnel lens? Method: The Fresnel lens concentrates sun rays on a reservoir that contains dead Sea salt and the mirrors reflect the rays on the reservoir , which causes the salt temperature to rise, water is then pumped inside the reservoir till it reaches the boiling point and produce steam, then this steam is taken to spin a turbine and generate electricity. Results: The temperature of the salt reached 126 Celsius and steam was produced, which will be taken later to generate electricity. Conclusion: In the final analysis, this project is a low cost technology that uses natural sources (Dead Sea salt) and could generate electricity in summer and winter, day and night.

AU- AND PD-NANOPARTICLE CATALYSTS IN NOVEL NAFION COMPOSITES FOR PEM FUEL CELL POWER ENHANCEMENT
Yon Kyu Jang, Hansen Qian, Matthew Rudin
Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Alexandria, VA

The polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM)—known also by its commercial name Nafion—holds unexplored catalytic potential for power output enhancement. In this study, Nafion layers were modified with non-platinum nanoparticle catalysts to make affordable composites with improved electron generation capacity. Topographically, Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) monolayers of gold, palladium, and gold-palladium nanoparticles were deposited on the surface of the Nafion. The surface pressure was optimized through a proxy oxygen reduction reaction in a cyclic voltammetry analysis, and was visually characterized through transmission electron microscopy. Internally, the nanoparticles were embedded inside the Nafion via a customized solution recasting technique; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy affirmed the chemical unalteration of the Nafion at each stage of recasting. Power output results at room temperature showed that embedded membranes outperformed both the control (p < 0.05) and the LB membranes (p < 0.05). A hydrogen gas heater-humidifier was then created to emulate high temperature environments for the fuel cell. Power output results at 80°C showed that embedded membranes were again superior (p < 0.05), but with LB membranes also showing gains over control (p < 0.05). More specifically, the embedded membranes of gold and palladium nanoparticles displayed power output increases of 58% and 47%, respectively, suggesting a novel means to significantly augment power generation in PEM fuel cells.

EVALUATION OF THE CUZNO CATALYST IN WATER GAS SHIFT REACTION FOR ENHANCED HYDROGEN PRODUCTION
Kevin Li, Nicholas DiPreta, 
Manhasset High School, Manhasset, NY

Hydrogen fuel contains almost three times as much energy as natural gas and releases no negative output to the environment. At 4¢/kWh, biomass fuel is not much more expensive than natural gas (2.6¢/kWh), and coal (3.6¢/kWh). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine, in a self-designed configuration, the most efficient operation conditions, in terms of hydrogen produced, of the CuZnO catalyst in the water gas shift reaction. The water gas shift reaction (WGSR, CO + H2O <-> CO2 + H2) is essential in the purification of gas mixtures outputted by biomass gasification by converting CO into H2. CuZnO, the current alternative industrial catalyst, was studied aiding the WGSR under various parameters: three different temperatures and three different flow rates. A gas chromatograph was used to determine the amount of H2 and CO remaining in the output gas. After each run-through, the temperature of the air around the catalyst was monitored to test if the catalyst had a pyrophoric nature. Using an ANOVA with a Scheffe post hoc test (p<.01), the differences in percentage of CO converted between each temperature and flow rate were found to be significant. It was also found that the catalyst did not release any heat after tests. The data collected in this study suggests that the percentage of CO converted, and thus the H2 created, is positively affected by the temperature increase and the flow rate decrease; also, CuZnO is a suitable option for industrial use because of its non-pyrophoric nature.

THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAXIMIZATION OF A NOVEL PHOTOSYNTHETIC MICROBIAL FUEL CELL USING RHODOSPIRILLUM RUBRUM
Gavin Mai, Marcus Gomez, 
Century High School, Rochester, MN

This study attempts to pursue a novel alternative source of energy--the microbial fuel cell, a device that harnesses the metabolic processes of bacteria during cellular respiration to produce electricity. In particular, the goal of this study was to analyze the performance of the bacteria Rhodospirilum rubrum (a purple non-sulfur photosynthetic bacteria) in producing electricity, as it is both a fairly common bacteria in the real world (actively used in wastewater treatment) and also as it has never before been shown to perform well in a microbial fuel cell. A prototype for a photoMFC was developed using clear PVC and a commercially available cation exchange membrane. Tests were then conducted measuring potential over a 10kOhm resistor as wavelength of light exposed (R. rubrum) was modified. In addition, bacterial growth was monitored under the fuel cell conditions. Results showed that R. rubrum had a significant capacity to perform in a microbial fuel cell, with peak voltage occurring under a fluorescent light at approximately 920mV, and with no limitations in growth being observed. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that the differences in power outputs under varied wavelengths were statistically significant (p<0.01); the peak in measured power output occurred under the wavelength λ=525. Best fit regression analysis of the wavelength data revealed an r^2=.99 for a cubic model (p<0.05), indicating that 99% of the variation in power output during the tests could be explained by the relationship between wavelength and power output; using this model, the optimal wavelength for maximum power output was estimated to occur at approximately λ=470. Power curves were calculated to determine optimal resistance by means of a quadratic regression analysis (r^2=0.88, p<0.05).

THE PASSIVE ACQUISITION OF A VIABLE SOURCE OF BIO-ELECTRICITY FROM THE ELECTRICAL RESERVOIR CONTAINED IN WASTEWATER
Jed Donald Grow, Andrew Quinn Ross, 
Clearfield High School, Clearfield, UT

In today’s post-industrial era, the race to develop a clean, economically-efficient, eco-friendly form of energy has become an area of extensive study throughout the international scientific community. A series of studies were conducted to examine the potential of wastewater to serve as an efficient energy alternative to current environmentally-problematic commodities such as batteries. To perform the experiment, several metal electrodes (copper and zinc) were installed into a pre-designed water-containing device and then filled with various types of wastewater from a number of different locations. A data-recording multimeter was used to quantify the energy obtained from each location and under varying conditions by measuring both voltage (V) and current (mA) produced by simple oxidative reduction reactions. Testing revealed that raw sewage (the initial material flowing into the wastewater treatment facility) generated approximately 50-60% more viable electrical energy in terms of voltage (V) and current (mA) than that of a control sample of regular tap water. In addition, collected data supports the claim that the wastewater battery performed approximately 40% more efficiently than that of a standard 9-volt battery; a consumer commodity heavily responsible for environmental damage on a global scale. More than five-thousand (5,000) tests validate the claim that wastewater is an invaluable resource with an immense natural electrical reservoir. Wastewater-generated electricity – a virtually infinite resource – could be useful in reducing the expenditure of finite resources such as coal, oil, petroleum, natural gas, etc., while simultaneously improving the global environment at an extremely low economic investment.

DO FORWARD PLACED FINS AFFECT THE STABILITY OF UNGUIDED ROCKETS?
Mitchell Jon Pence, Justen Gelling, 
Aberdeen Central High School, Aberdeen, SD

This experiment was designed to test the stability of an unguided rocket with forward placed fins. Guided missiles have been shown to be very accurate when equipped with such fins, and we wondered if the same affect would be present on unguided devices. We hypothesized that a rocket equipped with forward placed fins 20cm from the front of the rocket body tube with a sweep of 45° would have the greatest increase in stability. The null hypothesis is that there would be no difference in stability when comparing rockets with or without frontal fins. An alternative hypothesis would be that a rocket with only rear fins would be most stable.<br><br> After testing, we found that the rocket with only rear fins had the greatest stability of all rockets tested. This lead us to reject both the hypothesis and null hypothesis as the data supported the alternative hypothesis that a rocket with only rear fins would be the most stable.

As it became well recognized, there is a great loss (>88.6%) in the solar power transmitted into the earth which is estimated by 1000watt/m2. This loss is due to the low efficiency of solar cell devices. One of the most effective devices is "Dye-sensitized Solar Cells"; the highest efficiency reached is 11.4%, by this type of cells. The efficiency of this type depends on the light absorption of the dye used .due to many reasons; one of the most important reasons is the narrow range the dye absorbs in. The aim of this research is to improve the light absorption efficiency of Dye-sensitized solar cells by using a composite of multi dyes. The purpose of using this composite of dyes is to mix more than one dye with different peaks of absorptance, in order to absorb in wide range of the visible light (lambda= 400nm:700nm). To prove this hypothesis, controlled experiment has been run. The main goal of the experiment was to measure the photo spectroscopy of various dyes, mixtures of dyes, and mixtures of dyes and silver Nano particles (10nm) depending on the phenomena of photo plasmonic effect. As a result of the analytical scanning for the dyes, researchers found that the composition of Drimaren Black CL-S Dye, Drimaren yellow CL-2R Dye, and Silver Nano Particles (10nm) has efficiently absorbed spectrum from lambda = 190nm to lambda = 704nm, which a has a peak from lambda = 197nm to lambda =230nm and from lambda = 378nm to lambda = 426nm.

PAPER-LIKE PHOTOSYNTHETIC MICROBIAL PAPER FUEL CELL

There is currently a strong interest in the development of thin, flexible, lightweight, and environmental-friendly batteries to meet the needs for applications such as interactive packaging and consumer products. In this research, two novel designs of thin-layered photosynthetic microbial fuel cell (PMFC) were studied. Firstly, polypyrrole-ITO glass with either algae or yeast coating was used as bioelectrode in the rigid thin-layered PMFC model, which shows superior higher power density (619 mW m^2) with the corresponding current density of 1733 mA m^2. Superior performance of rigid-thin-layered PMFC can be achieved through the use of three-dimensional structure of polymeric electrodes. In this research, we propose a 3D electrode configuration design that combines an open macroporous structure for internal microbial colonization and an affinitive electrode surface for improved electrons transfer. Not only the non-flexible thin-layered PMFC was designed, but a new structure of thin, flexible PMFC using free-standing polypyrrole-agar composite thin films as both electrodes was also successfully constructed. Over 90% of the materials used in this design are biodegradable and green, which can be extracted from plants. Both agar-based conductive polymeric electrodes and biocatalysts are integrated through a lamination process. The flexible-agar-based thin-layered PMFC exhibits moderate power density (135 mW m^2) with the corresponding current density of 437 mA m^2, opening up new possibilities for the production of environmental-friendly, cost-effective, up-scalable and lightweight energy storage system. It is believed that this is the first report on the design and development of the green, biodegradable flexible thin-layered PMFC.

MICROFLUIDIC BIODIESEL EFFECTUATOR
Andy Law, David Larkin, 
West High School, Salt Lake City, UT

Traditional biodiesel processors are stationary, require the heating of reactants (usually to 55.0 – 60.0 °C), and necessitate grid electricity. The purpose of the continuation project, “Biodiesel Microfluidic Effectuator,” is to create a low-cost, portable, off-grid processor that incorporates novel microfluidic reaction technology and a new method for separating biodiesel from glycerol with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE). The processor’s objective is to execute the biodiesel reaction at ambient temperatures (such as 22.0 °C) to limit energy input, hence maximizing energy output. Additionally, it is designed to be a continuous flow process with minimal manual involvement in generating biodiesel from vegetable oil, methanol, and potassium hydroxide.<br><br> In conclusion, Biodiesel Microfluidic Effectuator (Bio-ME) is a plausible, tangible biodiesel processor. It produces biodiesel from either new or used vegetable oil and filters the generated hydrophobic biodiesel from the hydrophilic glycerol by-product using porous ePTFE tubing. The biodiesel reaction can occur at ambient temperatures due to the hydrophobic microfluidic tubing causing the biodiesel to be attracted to the wall of the tube while the hydrophilic glycerol is repelled to the center. Since biodiesel is produced in a equilibrium reaction, heat is traditionally used to catalyze the forward reaction and thus, preventing its reversal. Hydrophobic silicone tubing can replace the heat catalyst, as it attracts the reacted biodiesel away from the glycerol. This separation prevents the reverse reaction from occurring. Furthermore, Bio-ME is a continuous flow process in biodiesel generation and is powered by a 15-watt solar panel attached to the top of the processor, allowing it to be used off-grid.

Traditionally fossil fuels have given energy to mankind since the industrial revolution. Now, they present two problems, one of them: it is a finite resource; on the other hand this fuel combustion releases into the atmosphere carbon dioxide (CO2) enormous amounts, causing the so-called "greenhouse effect". For this reason has studied various options to replace the burning of the fuel, and therefore reduce global warming by and sources of energy inexhaustible natural as it is the wind energy.<br><br>In response to a need of first instance as it is electricity set as an objective of Engineering: produce electrical energy within our homes, through the use of the energy obtained from wind by effect of favorable air currents in our community, through the use of recycled objects.<br><br>To make the prototype anemometer was necessary reach and verify the feasibility of the project, then identify suitable materials for the construction of the prototype that basically consists of gears, metal bearings and PVC. <br><br>The type of wind generator is that we develop of horizontal axis, with A rotor of three spades, coupled to a gear system that increases the rpm connected to a generator that charges a 12V battery to be connected to an investor get 110V, supplying about 5 bulbs that consume Gadgets ecological or low voltage.

ALTERNATE SOURCES OF CELLULOSIC ETHANOL
Alfred Jennett
Genesis Preparatory School, New Port Richey, FL

Today, there are over a million cars on the road worldwide. Most of these cars are burning fossil fuels as their source of energy. Because there is a limit to the amount of fossil fuels on the planet, it is only a matter of time before we run out. To prevent an energy crisis in the near future, other sources of fuel are needed to slowly replace fossil fuels. The best method currently available is the burning of ethanol. <br><br>For my experiment, I tested rice, algae, and grass to see how they would compare to the widely used corn in terms of ethanol production. I would set up each solution in a closed system and allow fermentation to occur, measuring the amount of carbon dioxide produced, because this is proportionate to the amount of ethanol produced. <br><br>The corn produced the most carbon dioxide with an average of 170.34mL. The rice produced the second most with an average of 162.33, and algae was last with an average of 132.84. Grass did not function properly or any produce carbon dioxide.<br><br>These results show why corn is the currently used method for ethanol production, but show that other methods are almost as effective in producing ethanol. In addition, because fresh algae, straight from the pond, produced an average of 176.76mL of carbon dioxide, it may actually produce more ethanol if tested fully. <br><br>As a result, my hypothesis was proved partially wrong as rice was not the highest, being beat by corn. However I was partially right because algae did come in a close third and grass was last.

WIND TURBINE OPTIMIZATION, YEAR II: CAN A NOVEL PERMANENT MAGNET AXIAL FLUX THREE PHASE AC GENERATOR DESIGN BE USED TO INCREASE FUTURE WIND TURBINE EFFICIENCY?

The Villages Charter School, The Villages, FL

The purpose of this experiment was to determine if the utilization of a novel generator design could be used to increase future wind turbine efficiency. By combining airfoil designs from year one’s research and the novel concept of attaching permanent magnets to the ends of turbine blades to act as the stator in an axial flux generator, one hoped to create a frictionless form of energy conversion that would aid in increasing the overall efficiency of the turbine. <br><br>This researcher hypothesized that some efficiency would be lost due to increased wind resistance and weight created by the magnets and mounting brackets but that the electrical energy produced by the generator would make up for more than what was lost.<br><br>The unmodified rotor was tested at six different wind speeds ranging from six to sixty kilometers per hour for revolutions per minute and wind speed both in front of and behind the rotor. These tests were performed a minimum of fifty times and were then repeated with the modified rotor. The potential energy in the wind in front of and behind the rotor was calculated and used to find the amount of energy being converted by the rotor to mechanical energy by both the standard and modified rotors. The watts produced by the generator were then compared to the watts of energy lost and efficiencies were calculated. <br><br>The results of this experiment supported the hypothesis in that despite the loss in energy converted by the turbine, the energy produced by the generator still contributed to an overall increase in efficiency. This research proves that a novel axial flux generator design can be used to increase future wind turbine efficiency.

INVESTIGATING THE USE OF ANAEROBIC FERMENTATION ON PRETREATED BIOMASS TO STREAMLINE BIO-FUEL PRODUCTION
Jonah Z. Butler
Sibley East High School, Arlington, MN

Using anaerobic fermentation, two strains of bacteria (Clostridium Thermocellum and Clostridium thermolactium) and a co-culture containing equal parts of each strain was tested on pretreated and untreated corn stover. Half the biomass was subjected to a sulfuric acid (H2SO4) pretreatment, and then four 300-milligram samples were taken; two treated and two untreated, and subjected to 72% H2SO4 under 1.2 atmospheric pressure and 120 degrees Celsius for 60 minutes. The Klason (insoluble) lignin was filtered out. The filtrate, containing the monosaccharides and the acid-soluble lignin tested for glucose and xylose. Three groups of five sterile serum bottles were prepared by adding .002 grams of biomass to each bottle- three treated and two untreated. Five milliliters of basal media was introduced into each bottle, they were boiled to remove the oxygen, cooled using nitrogen, sealed with crimp tops, and autoclaved to kill undesirable organisms. The bacteria stains were inserted using a hypodermic syringe. The bottles were incubated at 60 degrees Celsius for five days. They were processed, using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), to determine ethanol content. It was concluded that anaerobic fermentation is a feasible method of producing biofuel based on high ethanol yield; the most efficient bacteria strain was the co-culture.

A CURRENT EVENT: USING RENEWABLE ELECTRICAL TIDAL ENERGY IN THE PRODUCTION OF HYDROGEN GAS FOR FUEL CELLS AND OTHER APPLICATIONS, YEAR FOUR OF AN ONGOING STUDY
Kyle Scott Saleeby
Niceville High School, Niceville, FL

The purpose of my experiment is to produce clean, renewable, transportable, green energy from tidal flow in the form of electricity and hydrogen gas to power fuel cells and other applications. I continued into my 4th year of researching tidal power by using electricity produced from my twelve bladed waterwheel to produce hydrogen gas through hydrolysis of water. My main goal was to determine various relationships in hydrolysis between the size of electrodes, distance separating electrodes, current flowing in the circuit, and molarity of the electrolyte used to facilitate electrical conduction. I designed and built a small scale hydrolysis chamber that effectively collected hydrogen gas while releasing oxygen gas into the air. The tests were successful and demonstrated clean electrical tidal power can be used to produce hydrogen gas for use in fuel cells and other applications. In 10 minutes, 83mL of hydrogen gas was produced using only 1.01 Amps at 17.68 Volts. The waterwheel has produced 40 amps at 4 knots of tidal current, with only 7% efficiency. The low efficiency of the waterwheel is due to the use of a greased pipe for an axle (no bearings), a rudimentary gearbox made of bicycle sprockets, and an automobile alternator designed to operate at much higher RPM’s. With these limitations, 40 amps projects out to 433.9 Liters per hour of Hydrogen gas. At 45% efficiency, the projection is 2789 Liters of hydrogen gas in the average of 22 Hours per Day of strong tidal flow under the Destin Bridge.

THE EFFECT OF ORGANIC MATTER ON GENERATING ELECTRICITY USING A MEDIATOR-LESS MICROBIAL FUEL CELL
Catherine C. Pollack
Sherando High School, Stephens City, VA

As the world struggles to meet the demands of a rapidly increasing population, coupled with the constant depletion of nonrenewable resources, it has become critical to find alternative sources of electricity which can be used universally. There are over 1 billion people currently living without electricity, spread throughout the world on numerous continents. All have access to different resources; thus, it is crucial that a technology be found that meets the needs of all climates and environments. Microbial fuel cells are sustainable, renewable, and are able to be individualized; they use biomass containing anaerobic bacteria that, through their metabolic processes, release electrons that directly travel through the anode and into the cathode, which in turn creates an electrical current. By analyzing the amounts of electricity each type of organic substrate produces, it can be determined whether a certain type of organic substrate is optimal for use in a microbial fuel cell. <br><br>The purpose of this study was to determine whether differing organic substrates have an effect on the amount of electricity produced in a mediator-less microbial fuel cell (MLMFC). While it was hypothesized that cow manure would produce the most electricity due to the presence of Escherichia coli, it was actually pond mud that produced the most electricity. All data was shown to be statistically significant through the Analysis of Variance statistical test.<br><br>MLMFCs can be implemented around the world as an inexpensive, alternate source of electricity. By adding a third chamber, they can also be used to desalinate water.

ROTOR TIP COMPONENTS FOR RESIDENTIAL WIND TURBINES
Daniel James Dorminy
Sola Fide Home School, McDonough, GA

In order to create rotor tip components to increase electrical output on existing residential wind turbines, a Southwest Windpower AIR 40 residential wind turbine was tested over 1775 times in researcher created wind tunnels. A Cube 3D printer using Cubify Invent, a computer assisted design program, created each device, ensuring precision and accurate duplication of experimental devices.<br><br>The first two stages of research focused on blade tip fences, modifying both length and height while keeping volumes equal, with all positive results. Starting with Stage 3, more accurate testing procedures were implemented using a larger wind tunnel with a residential wind turbine. Stage 3 incorporated tip cap connectors into the experimental devices for ease of attachment. Tip extensions, raked tip extensions, and tip fences all showed moderate gains, but the extensions were rejected for further testing because of difficulty printing the proper designs. Stage 4 of this research tested different stationary flap sizes using the tip cap connector, but no flap improved the output. In Stage 5, study focused on blade tip caps, blade tip fences incorporating caps, and blade tip fences directly attached.<br><br>The blade tip fence proves to be the best tip addition for the Southwest Windpower AIR 40 based on the extensive testing of this study. The 11.75% increase in output comes from a small rotor tip device 37.9 mm long which is inexpensive to produce. Residential wind turbine owners will be able to add this proven aircraft technology to their rotor tips with ease.

LOOKING PAST PETROLEUM: GROWING BIOFUEL USING BRINE FROM ABANDONED OIL WELLS
Trisha Dalapati
Centennial High School, Roswell, GA

Algal biofuels are a promising alternative to petroleum. Growing freshwater algae for fuel would compete with food crops for freshwater. Many oil-producing algae can be grown in seawater, an alternative to the use of freshwater resources. However, reasonable access to ocean water is limited to coastal land. Abandoned oil wells throughout the Southwest United States represent access to brine reservoirs, in an area of abundant land and high solar irradiance, but a scarcity of freshwater or ocean access.<br><br>In this study, a terrestrial brine-based medium was developed for the cultivation of Nannochloropsis gaditana CCMP526. In Experiment 1, cultures were grown in a seawater-based medium (positive control) and a terrestrial brine-based medium over five days. Growth (absorbance) was measured on a spectrophotometer at 730 nm, a wavelength beyond the absorption spectra of chlorophyll. Growth was seen in both media as hypothesized, however, poor growth was observed in brine samples. Using mass spectrophotometry, the brine-based medium was shown to lack nutrients in comparison to the seawater-based medium. Therefore, the brine-based medium was supplemented with essential ions (Ca, Mg, K, and S).<br><br>When repeated with the nutrient supplemented brine-based medium in experiment 2, algal growth similar to the seawater-based medium was seen in the supplemented brine-based medium, validating the hypothesis of experiment 2.<br><br>If results of experiment 2 are reproducible, then it can be concluded that terrestrial brines with compositions like the one tested can be used for algal biofuel production.

HYDROGEN PRODUCTION IN CHLAMYDOMONAS REINHARDTII: ASEXUAL VS. SEXUAL REPRODUCTION
Sierra Dawn Woods
Puxico R-8 High School, Puxico, MO

Hydrogen production in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii during reproduction may be the answer to creating hydrogen fuel in the future, in this experiment the amount of produced hydrogen was tested by the type of reproduction, sexual and asexual, that occurred. My H1 stated if Chlamydomonas reinhardtii are allowed to reproduce sexually then the amount of hydrogen that will be produced will be greater than that of the amount of hydrogen produced by asexual reproduction and was supported during my experiment. My H2 stated if Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mt+ and mt- are allowed to reproduce asexually, then the amount of hydrogen will not vary between the cultures. My H0 stated if Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is allowed to reproduce sexually then the amount of hydrogen that will be produced will not vary from the amount produced during asexual reproduction. In most cases, hydrogen production in was doubled during sexual reproduction. From the data collected, to create the most hydrogen from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, sexual reproduction should be used.

TEMPERATURE AND POWER OUTPUT: A STUDY OF CRYSTALLINE SOLAR CELLS
Travis B. Lysaght
Hicksville High School, Hicksville, OH

The purpose of this experiment was to find how temperature affects the power output of a solar panel. Being able to know how temperature affects solar cells allows someone to be able to have the highest output efficiency possible from the solar cells. The hypothesis of the experiment was that when the temperature increased, the solar panel output would decrease. When the temperature decreased, the solar panel output would increase. To test this experiment, a solar panel was heated to the temperatures of zero, five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five, forty, forty-five, and fifty degrees Celsius. Then, a light was turned on the solar panel, and the output was instantaneously measured. The data concluded that the hypothesis was correct. While the temperature increased, the solar panel’s output decreased, and when the temperature decreased, the solar panel’s output increased. The effect of temperature on solar panels was nearly linear. It was concluded that solar panels work better in cool, sunny climates.

FUEL FOR THOUGHT: THE LUBRICITY OF ULTRA LOW SULPHUR DIESEL FUEL
Karan Jerath
Friendswood High School, Friendswood, TX

The undisputed need for sustaining the environment has been a prevalent issue for a multitude of parties. Due to this reason, The International Maritime Organization has mandated ship owners to follow new regulations for reducing sulphur emissions to 0.1% by 2015. Two problems must be confronted. One involves lubricity, which causes wear in the fuel combustion equipment; the other problem involves cost, which has exponentially increased due to the low sulphur requirement. This experiment was aimed at testing Biodiesel as a lubricity addictive to improve conditions and cost. <br><br>For experimentation, eleven samples of Biodiesel blends in rates of 300ppm to 3,000ppm, including the control, were produced. A fuel injection nozzle lubricity simulation was conducted by documenting the time taken for the fuel-coated needle to “close”. Lubricity was determined by the High Frequency Reciprocating Rig scar test, by adding force from a steel ball. The results supported the hypothesis by showing an increase in lubricity with faster “closings” and less scars. Average bunker prices for four types of fuels in bunkering ports for Singapore, Gothenburg and Houston were analyzed and calculations were made for a ship’s lifetime of 30 years. Biodiesel comparisons showed savings from approximately $33,000,000-$42,800,000 dollars in a lifetime. <br><br>Biodiesel fuel performs as an effective lubricant for the fuel injection system while lowering costs dramatically and benefiting the environment with cleaner burning levels and the aforementioned benefits. Countries importing goods will benefit significantly with cheaper prices and those on the verge of recession will be salvaged.

EFFICIENCIES OF SUN RAY CAPTURE
Christine M. Castagna
Academy of Science and Technology, The Woodlands, TX

The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether a vertically placed solar cell would be as efficient as a horizontally placed solar cell of the same type when it receives only reflected rays. It was predicted that a polycrystalline solar cell placed vertically in a box with a mirrored interior adjacent to a large mirror placed at a 45 degree angle would be as efficient as a horizontally placed cell.<br><br> <br><br>With data from a horizontal solar cell as control, voltages were measured when the solar cell was placed inside a non-mirrored box with a large reflecting mirror tilted immediately next to it at variable angles (0, 30, 45, and 60 degrees). The procedure was repeated with placement of the solar cell within a mirrored box.<br><br>Data suggested that all of the solar cells in the non-mirrored box were significantly less efficient than the control. The mirrored box was significantly less efficient by itself, but all angles with the extra mirror (0, 30, 45, and 60 degrees) were not significantly less efficient. Data suggested that the 60 degree angle with the mirrored box was the most closely efficient to the control. <br><br>The experiment could be improved with more constant weather, as well as extra trials on days of constant weather. With more trials, the statistical analysis would be improved. The data from this project supports the applicability of solar cells being placed vertically on the side of infrastructure, and that they could efficiently collect voltage.

THE ADAPTION OF A GORLOV HELICAL TURBINE INTO A WATER MAIN
Michael Anthony Sementilli
Niceville High School, Niceville, FL

The purpose of my experiment is to adapt a Gorlov Helcial Turbine into a water main. The reason for this is that we waste millions of dollars on pumping. If this adaption were to be placed into a water main it would give back part of the energy that was used to pump the water. This experiment is done by simulating a water main. This is built by using sewage pipes, PVC pipe, and a pool pump. The pump is modified to pump at a certain pressure which is calculated using the diameter of the pipe. First you must put water into the apparatus. You let the water fill it then you turn the pool pump on. The Gorlov Helical Turbine is self starting which means no energy is need to start. The kinetic energy of the water moves it. You then attach the multimeter to the control panel and also the computer to the infrared sensor. The sensor reads RPM using infrared light and measuring how many times the apparatus passes it. The computer program reads this. You then start your trial with the first motor. You time one minute and every ten second interval you read the voltage given off and the RPM. Repeat five times for each of the turbines, the spherical, horizontal and normal (vertical turbine). This showed that the vertical turbine was shaped for the water flow to hit it just right. It was not too large of an area, but perfect for water flow. The normal turbine did not restrict the water flow, this is why it had a higher RPM, while this happened the spherical did restrict the water flow resulting in the lower RPM and less electricity produced. The spherical did have a higher torque based on the level of the tanks, so it woulld be more adaptable in a water flow where restriction is not an issue, but the normal turbine was the most adaptable for a water main.

THE EFFECT OF MATERIALS TYPE ON BIOGAS GENERATION
Christain Gentry Barnes
North Point High School, Waldorf, MD

Biogas is a renewable form of energy that can be harnessed by humans in order to create electricity. For a common household, a renewable energy source is critical to both saving economically on an electricity bill, and saving environmentally on a global scale. The goal of this experiment was to test a series of common household wastes in their biogas production, and determine which waste material produced the greatest capacity of biogas in the least amount of time. This would determine the most efficient, and inefficient materials for local biogas digestion and production. To determine this, a series of 18 small scale digesters were assembled and filled with slurries of different kinds. These digesters were let to sit for a total of 18 days, after which they had produced varying amounts of biogas. The material which produced the highest rate of biogas production was the strawberry slurry, with a rate of 4.0 ml/day. The lowest rate was produced by the corn slurry, at 0.009 ml/day. All other results of the tested materials fell between these two extreme data points. The average rate of biogas production for all materials was 1.127 ml/day. In testing, a correlation was observed between the material density and the rate of biogas production. It was concluded that the most efficient method of producing biogas in a local digester came about by using softer, less dense materials, such as strawberries and grapes.

SELECTED ALGAE STRAINS BIODIESEL PROPERTIES
Thomas Parisian
Box Elder High School, Box Elder, MT

Chlorella and Chlamydomonus algae were cultured and studied for a four week period to determine their feasibility as a bio fuel energy source. The algae were cultured in Bristol Medium under ideal growing conditions (constant supply of food and sunlight) for four weeks. The algae were transported to the research facility, where the water was filtered and the algae were dried for a 24 hour period. Oils were extracted from the algae samples and underwent the trans-esterification process. The resultant biofuel product was analyzed for biofuel properties using gas chromatography-mass Spectrophotometry. Results indicate that a low percentage of the algae was successfully transformed into biofuel, indicating that while algae may be used as a source of biofuel, it would not be considered an ideal biofuel source.

THE EFFECTS OF FUEL ADDITIVES ON POWER IN DIESEL ENGINES
Troy Milton Manoukian
Malta High School, Malta, MT

This project was designed to determine if a diesel fuel additive increased power in a diesel engine when compared to a diesel fuel with no additives. To test this, an engine dynamometer, a fuel cell, and a Caterpillar 3176 diesel engine were used. The CAT engine was run for a period of 3 minutes, with 8 total trials, four without additive and four with additive, with these tests running consecutively. <br><br> Results of these tests showed a maximum horsepower of 455.24 was achieved with straight fuel. The additive showed a maximum of 466.93 horsepower. After analyzing the cumulative data and completing two tailed t tests, I found that the results were highly significant at the .01 level, with specific results being a .000000135 when comparing the straight and blended fuel. When comparing the control to the 1st blended fuel trial (4 runs) and the 2nd blended trial (4 runs), both were calculated and found to be significant at the .04 level.<br><br> My experiment showed that my hypothesis was incorrect. My expectant of a 2% increase in power while using an additive was underestimated. My results showed that a 5% increase was achieved while using an additive. After numerous calculations, additives rather than straight diesel are a cost effective way to boost power in farm vehicles.

GREEN OXIDE SOLAR CELLS ASSEMBLED WITH LOW-POWER ELECTROCHEMICAL DEPOSITION METHOD AND THEIR PHOTOVOLTAIC STUDY
Chang Liu
Shandong Experimental Senior High School, Jinan, CHINA

How to use clean and renewable energy effectively is an important issue that the whole human society faces for its sustainable development. Especially for developing countries like China, it is also an effective way to reduce pollution and provide more energy. Solar energy is considered one of the most promising clean and renewable energy sources. Si wafer-based solar cells currently dominate the photovoltaic (PV) market with over 80% of the market share. However, during the production, some chemical pollution produces and much electricity is consumed. So, developing a new kind of green solar cells with less energy is interesting. In our project, we assemble thin film solar cells by low-power electrochemical deposition with oxide semiconductor material (ZnO, Cu2O) that are both environmental friendly. Oxide semiconductor nanowires are of high specific surface area and show better conductivity than film, which are both preferred characteristics for solar cell fabrication. Several kinds of ZnO/Cu2O cells with different PN heterojunctions and Cu2O homojunction solar cells with textured surface microstructures were obtained by optimizing the solar cell growth conditions. The relation between the PV properties and their structures was discussed and higher efficiency was obtained, which shows important significance for the development of new solar cells. Although we have shown a feasible method to realize the large-area production on large substrate, the solar cell efficiency is still low now. The big resistivity of both films is a main problem. We plan to reduce the film resistivity of ZnO and Cu2O by optimizing the electrochemical conditions and doping technique. Our goal is to get high-efficiency solar cells with green materials and low-energy production method.

WIND ENERGY: AN ECONOMICAL ALTERNATIVE
Bradley Derek Sloop
Susquenita High School, Duncannon, PA

Skyrocketing energy prices, high market volatility, and increased environmental concerns have caused rural home and business owners across the globe to consider investing in alternative wind energy. Unfortunately, residential wind turbines cost roughly $30,000 to install, instituting a long pay-back period. As a result, the purpose of this study was to employ modern wind technology to design an affordable, yet highly efficient small wind turbine-capable of maximizing power. To balance cost and performance, the blades were constructed with white pine lumber, a material resistant to cracking and fatigue while light enough to promote low wind start-up. After manipulating the blade angle of several prototype configurations, wind tunnel testing concluded that a twisted blade profile of 10 degrees root-tip would allow the airfoil to maintain an optimal angle of attack and lift/drag ratio. Hence, this successful design was enlarged to a 3.6 meter diameter rotor, installed above obstructions on a 12 meter tower at a rural monitoring location in the Northeastern United States. The “Wind S1 Turbine” possessed a yaw control to orient into the prevailing wind and a furling system to prevent high wind damage. Loaded onto a permanent magnet alternator, the turbine functioned with a rated power of 1500 W. Turning in a 5.0 m/s wind, estimates show that it would produce nearly 4000 kWh annually, operate at a capacity factor of 30%, and reduce an average American’s electric bill by 40%. Accordingly, this turbine could be utilized by developing nations where majorities of rural populations lack electrical access. Requiring no transmission, it would provide a direct power source to entire villages-ultimately improving standard of living while ensuring energy sustainability for the future.

ALGAL BIOFUELS, PHASE FOUR: ENGINEERING A MICROBIAL FUEL CELL FOR SIMULTANEOUS PRODUCTION OF ELECTRICITY, ALGAL OIL, AND ETHANOL AS WELL AS ANALYZING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A SOLVENT RECOVERY PROCESS FOR OPTIMUM LIPID EXTRACTION
Yanqi Chen
Central York High School, York, PA

While algal biofuels already have tremendous potential alone to serve as alternative energy candidates, their prospects are greatly enhanced when they can be integrated into a microbial fuel cell with yeast. This project attempted to develop an efficient microbial fuel cell constituted of algae and yeast and also an efficient lipid extraction solvent recovery system. <br><br> Through growing micro-algae in the cathodic compartment in batch mode and growing yeast in the anodic compartment in continuous mode, electricity, algae oil, and ethanol could all be harvested simultaneously from the microbial fuel cell. Algal concentrations were quantified using spectrophotometry. Cell power and current was quantified through analyzing capacitor charge and discharge curves. Ethanol was quantified through HPLC and lipids were quantified through gravimetric means by way of a hexane solvent extraction process. Yeast mass was quantified through moisture content analysis.<br><br> In the lipid solvent recovery experiment, hexane was chosen as the non-polar solvent. Recovery was accomplished through simple distillation.<br><br> This project determined that an 87% effective recovery process could be created successfully which does not diminish the potential of the solvent for further use. Additionally, a successful microbial fuel cell was created which could produce 20mW of electricity/m2 of anode, 0.09 liters of algal oil/1000 liters media, and 41.571 liters of ethanol/ 1000 liters media. This project also determined that microalgae grown in microbial fuel cell conditions grew at a slower rate compared to those grown in standard conditions. Most significantly, this project determined that by utilizing methylene blue as a mediator in both sides, power density could be increased by 7-fold.

ENHANCING THE EFFICIENCY OF A PEM HYDROGEN FUEL CELL WITH SYNTHESIZED METAL-NANOPARTICLE/GRAPHENE COMPOSITES SYNERGY
Benjamin Akhavan
Rambam Mesivta High School, Lawrence, NY

Obstructing commercialization of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC) is the soaring cost of platinum and other catalysts used to increase membrane efficiency. The purpose of this project is to find a relatively inexpensive catalyst for coating the membrane and enhancing the efficiency of the PEMFC. Graphene oxide was reduced using NaBH4 in the presence of metal salts, primarily KAuCl4 and K2PtCl4, to synthesize metal-nanoparticle/graphene. FTIR and Thermogravimetric Analysis indicated the successful synthesis of graphene, while Transmission Electron Microscopy displayed the presence of nanoparticles on graphene sheets. Nafion® membranes were coated with metal-nanoparticle/graphenes and tested in an experimental PEMFC alongside bare Nafion®, Gold (Au) nanoparticles, and graphene. The metal-nanoparticle/graphene composites enhanced the PEMFC compared to bare Nafion®. Au-Graphene, the best catalyst composite, increased the efficiency up to 150% better than nanoparticles or graphene alone while using only 1% of the concentration of Au nanoparticles. Theoretical power output of the Au-Graphene synergy could increase fuel cell efficiency up to 18 times more than the Au-nanoparticles themselves by altering concentrations of Au nanoparticles in Au-Graphene. The Au nanoparticles changed the structure and catalytic ability of graphene in the Au-Graphene, offering a promising future for PEM fuel cell technology.

IMPROVING CAR AERODYNAMICS: TESTING CAD MODELS IN A SELF-ENGINEERED WIND TUNNEL
Scott Alexander Bollt
Potsdam High School, Potsdam, NY

The purpose of this project is to reduce the gas emissions of cars and to increase the range of electric cars by reducing aerodynamic drag on vehicles without compromising comfort or safety. A wind tunnel was engineered, along with a force balance, to obtain the drag measurements from a model car that was designed in CAD and built in rapid prototyping. The drag was then scaled by the square of the reciprocal of the model's scale size to accommodate for the differences in the Reynolds numbers to get the drag that a full scaled version would experience. The designed car had a smaller area and a better drag coefficient, along with a smaller drag area as compared to all production cars. This means that the car design has superior energy efficiency, and would help improve gas mileage and make electric cars more practical.

EFFECTS OF AN OUTER GRID ON INERTIAL ELECTROSTATIC CONFINEMENT FUSION
Jonathan Troy Morrell
Fremont High School, Plain City, UT

This project is a study of the effects of an outer grid on inertial electrostatic confinement fusion using a Hirsch-Farnsworth fusion reactor. The outer grid is a high voltage anode which serves as an electron trap, and also electrostatically confines positively charged ions; both critical functions in this type of reactor. The experiment involved measuring the relative efficiencies of three different types of outer grids in terms of ion-electron recombination. A simple measure of this is the light produced by the reactor, because photons are the product of ion-electron recombination. The three types of grids were: a horizontal grid, a dense horizontal grid, and a vertical grid. The simplest way to measure light output was to attach a photoresistor to a multi-meter. Light emitted by the device would cause the photoresistor to vary in resistance, with a higher amount of resistance corresponding to a lower amount of light released. After several trials the average resistance of the horizontal grid was 1398 kilo-ohms, the dense horizontal grid was 1979 kilo-ohms, and the vertical grid was 343 kilo-ohms. This indicates that the dense horizontal grid was the most efficient in terms of ion-electron recombination. This grid also had the greatest surface area, which proves that it was the most efficient due to its electron trapping characteristics. This has applications in nuclear fusion research and future commercial fusion reactors, proving that a good electron trap is critical in improving the efficiency of the reaction, and could improve efficiency enough for breakeven fusion..

Hollywood has glamorized the use of magnetohydrodynamic propulsion, but is it really possible? This project highlights the Lorentz Formula to determine if magnetohydrodynamic propulsion can be achieved and used to propel a boat at a similar speed as a traditionally propelled boat. Additionally, this project attempts to model a self-sustaining magnetohydrodynamic vessel by adding solar power.<br><br>By calculating buoyancy, a magnetohydrodynamic boat was built after demonstrating water movement by crossing a magnetic field with an electrical field. The magnetohydrodynamic boat speed, duration of movement, and voltage were measured and compared to a boat built similarly using a traditional propeller. Corrosion was corrected by adding a zinc lozenge and rubber coating wires. Solar cells were added to determine if a near self-sustaining system could be developed.<br><br>Data obtained by measuring boat speeds showed that, after correcting for corrosion, the magnetohydrodynamic boat improved, traveling near 16% the speed of the traditionally propelled boat. Corrosion correction lead to 200% improvement in duration of movement yet voltage measurements dropped from 9 V to 5.6 V. By adding solar power, magnetohydrodynamic boat speed had an improved average of 237 % and ran continuously for 8 hours, showing a 1600% improvement of duration.<br><br>In conclusion, magnetohydrodynamic propulsion is possible although not as efficient in speed as the traditionally propelled boat. Adding solar power improves duration of action and average speed such that magnetohydrodynamic propulsion may be an important force for liquid propulsion in the future.

OPTIMIZATION OF A DYE CO-SENSITIZED SOLAR CELL TO ASSIST PHOTO-ELECTROCHEMICAL WATER-SPLITTING WITH A NANOSTRUCTURED C-PC ENHANCED FE2O3 PHOTO-ANODE
Maxmillian Cooper Minichetti
Greenwich High School, Greenwich, CT

Scientists have expressed significant interest in Dye Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs) as an easily manufactured, inexpensive means of generating clean energy. An equally substantial interest for clean energy storage has also emerged, which can be achieved with photo-electrochemical water-splitting via Photo-Electrochemical Cells (PECs). This study seeks to optimize and investigate the performance of a TiO2-based DSSC, enhanced by the dye co-sensitization of Nile Red (NR), Nile Blue A (NB), Rhodamine 110 (R110) and Anthocyanin (A) dyes, for the purpose of assisting an Optimized PEC that uses a C-Phycocyanin (C-PC algae extract) enhanced Fe2O3 photo-anode. This project culminates in the construction of a Novel Dual Solar Apparatus which can be practically applied for electricity generation and/or the storage of this energy by photo-induced water-splitting. Dye co-sensitization significantly augmented the DSSC’s spectral response to UV-Vis wavelengths of incident light. The Optimized DSSC achieved a 3% solar conversion efficiency allowing for a 59% increase in output voltage and a 129% increase in output current in comparison to a conventional Anthocyanin DSSC. The efficiency of an Fe2O3 photo-anode was substantially enhanced by employing the C-PC light-trapping nanostructures by covalent cross-coupling (CCC) which allowed for a 13.4% increase in PEC performance, a photo-anodic voltage increase of 127%, and a photo-current improvement of 66%. Finally, the Novel Optimized Dual Solar Apparatus was able to generate hydrogen gas at a rate 57% greater than that of a Dual Solar Apparatus without a photovoltaic metal oxide anode. With additional research and innovation, the Dual Solar Apparatus can be augmented for modern-day application alongside current hydrogen fuel cells.

As it is widely known that silicon wafers needs great effort to dig out and then purify it to the stage to be fitted in the solar panels; thus making the solar panels expensive and unaffordable. Chlorophyll is used in this project as an alternative to silicon wafers for two purposes to increase the efficiency and to generate electricity for a long period.<br><br>Although chlorophyll is found in all green plants; spinach, due to its long, wide and dark green color, has relatively more chlorophyll than other plants. It is an annual plant, which grows to a height of up to 30 cm. Spinach may survive over winter in temperate regions. In this experiment, chlorophyll has been extracted from spinach and used as the main part of solar panel with silicon wafers.<br><br>It is envisaged that the project would have financial, cultural and environmental implications, but not limited only to; alternate sources of cheap electricity, particularly, for the people faced with energy crisis; help people save their hard-earned precious resources that could be used on other activities; create job opportunities for the jobless; increase cultivation of green plants, which would have positive impact on the environment.<br><br> <br><br>The experiments confirmed that spinach can be effectively and efficiently used with Silicon Wafers in a Solar Panel. The cost of solar panel is not affordable for poor, if the spinach chlorophyll is used in solar panels there will be a huge fall in solar panels market as these are cost effective.

THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT VARIATIONS OF AN IMPELLER TYPE VERTICAL AXIS WIND TURBINE ON ITS EFFICIENCY
Richard Scott Middaugh
Central Virginia Governor's School/Brookville High School, Lynchburg, VA

The purpose of this study was to determine if wind turbine efficiency is altered by changing the size and position of vanes of an impeller type vertical axis wind turbine. Six variations of this design were built, along with a wind tunnel to test them under high and low wind speeds. While being tested, the turbines were filmed with a Sony 600 frames per second to determine their rotation speed. The strength of the electric current produced was measured using a current probe and LABQuest 2 from Vernier.com. The data were analyzed through a one-way ANOVA test with an alpha value of 0.05. The resulting p-values for the current strength and rotation speed for 8.9 meters per second wind speed are 4.98E-32 and 3.23E-32 respectively. For 10.5 meters per second wind speed, the p-values for the current strength and rotation speed are 1.99E-15 and 4.32E-18 respectively. The research hypothesis stated that if the turbine with 3 centimeter vanes at 135 degrees was tested, it would be the most efficient. This was supported by the rotation speed data with both wind speeds. However, the hypothesis was not supported for the wind speed of 10.5 meters per second by the current strength data. These data suggested that the current strength produced by this turbine and the turbine with 3 centimeter vanes at 120 degrees were statistically similar. The results suggest that changing the vane size and position of an impeller type vertical axis wind turbine affects efficiency.

THE EFFECTS OF CRYSTAL MOLDING ON PIEZOELECTRIC POWER GENERATION
Seth Stephen Petra
Elk Point-Jefferson High School, Elk Point, SD

The purpose of this project was to find out if Rochelle salt crystals could be formed in a mold and if it would influence the amount of electricity it produces.<br><br>The crystals were grown from seed crystals in a supersaturated solution of dissolved Rochelle salt. The holding mechanism was two pieces of wood on a rail with flattened silver wire as a contact point. A 2.3 kilogram weight was used to apply mechanical stress to the crystal. The peak electrical outputs of the crystals were measured using a voltmeter.<br><br>Data were collected by placing a crystal between the two contact points and placing a 2.3 kilogram weight on top of the upper piece of wood. For the control, the crystals that grew outside of the mold were used. Each crystal was tested once. Peak electrical output was measured and was recorded in millivolts. Data analysis consisted of a bar graph of the crystals and their electrical outputs, a table, and several t-tests to determine significance. A table and bar graph were constructed for comparison purposes.<br><br>It would appear that it is possible to grow crystals in a specific shape using a mold. Visual examination of the results showed that crystals grown in the mold produced more electricity than the others. Based on the results of this study, it appears Rochelle salt can be successfully grown in a mold and that the resulting crystals can produce significantly more electricity as their unmolded counterparts.

NOVEL FE2O3 AND SULFUR CATALYZED ROCKET PROPELLANTS: A SYNERGISTIC APPROACH TO THE SORBITOL “FLUSHING” PHENOMENON
Parth Chetan Thakker
North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, Durham, NC

The purpose of this study was to characterize and alleviate the negative consequences of "flushing" within rocket propellants of low melting-points. Flushing, which is the rapid ejection of molten propellant from a cylindrical motor core, reduces impulse as a function of mass (specific-impulse) and yields sharply progressive thrust curves by expelling unburned propellant from the nozzle during combustion.<br><br> <br><br>Many low melting-point formulations are based upon sorbitol fuel, a sugar alcohol that melts at 98 °C. While sorbitol is known to have favorable material, chemical, and economic properties, its practical applications and research potential have been limited by the consequences of flushing. As a solution, this study analyzed the effects of a traditional propellant catalyst (red iron oxide - Fe2O3), to those of a hypothesized combustion-temperature reducer (sulfur) on sorbitol propellant performance.<br><br> <br><br>A previously optimized 65:35 sorbitol:KNO3 propellant base was used for subscale testing within an aluminum-alloy motor casing and a horizontal force and temperature sensing apparatus. Although independent tests of red iron oxide and sulfur additives yielded mixed results, the composite sulfur-Fe2O3 formulation demonstrated positive effects in nearly every measure of performance. These benefits included a large drop in combustion temperature, increased thrust stability, and reduced propellant loss from the motor (based upon specific-impulse calculations).<br><br> <br><br>Put together, these results corroborate the hypothesized synergy between Fe2O3 and sulfur as sorbitol propellant additives and represent a novel solution to propellant flushing that can be further optimized to improve motor efficiency for eventual commercial use.

LARGE SCALE RENEWABLE ENERGY UNINTERRUPTABLE POWER SYSTEM (UPS)
Cristian Omar Rivera
Colegio Radians, Inc., Cayey, PUERTO RICO

This research project was to develop a renewable source of energy other than wind and sunlight. Water was chosen for this project because it can be a source of energy. Elevation points of mountains, close to the ocean in Puerto Rico, can be used to position a storage system that will hold water that was pumped from the ocean with a turbine powered by a photovoltaic system during the day. At night, stored water in the tank will fall into a pulley system that was attached with a DC generator. Water falls into a Pelton wheel that will move the DC generator. As the generator moves, it will provide energy to a community during the night. In this project a step ladder was used to simulate the mountains with a 5 gallon paint bucket at the top. At the bottom of the ladder was another 5 gallon paint bucket with the Pelton wheel on top, simulating the ocean. This idea occurred during the summer because in the house there is a grid tied system which led to the question: Why can’t batteries be used in the house to store the energy that the photovoltaic system generates? The problem is batteries are too expensive. The idea was to develop a renewable source of energy that wouldn’t be too expensive. As the results demonstrate, water could be used as a renewable source of energy.

THE INFLUENCE OF WING DESIGN AND ASPECT RATIO ON THE LIFT AND DRAG OF AN AIRCRAFT
Charles William Freeman
Gleason High School, Gleason, TN

Introduction: In light of the recent energy crisis, it is important that flight is as efficient and practical as possible. Having a firm grasp on the principles of aircraft wing design enables one to construct more fuel efficient and perhaps faster or more maneuverable aircraft. This project researches how wing design, particularly aspect ratio, affects lift and drag.<br><br>Problem Statement: The hypothesis stated that both lift and drag were directly proportional to the wing's aspect ratio. The project in question puts this conjecture to the test.<br><br>Procedure: In an effort to study the lift and drag of a number of wing designs, each set of wings was clamped to a set of vertical rods in a small wind tunnel. The wings were attached to a spring scale. The lift of each wing design was then recorded. The wings were then placed on a set of horizontal rods and the drag of each design was recorded.<br><br>Results: The hypothesis was found to be valid. As aspect ratio increased, so too did lift and drag. The correlation coefficients reflecting lift and drag's correlation with aspect ratio were calculated to be 0.481 and 0.850, respectively, indicating that the results were statistically significant.<br><br> <br><br>Conclusion: The data recorded in this science fair provides valuable insight as to how wing design affects an aircraft's lift and drag. Using the relationship demonstrated between aspect ratio and lift and drag, one may tailor each aircraft's wings in a manner that fits the needs of that aircraft.

PREVENTION OF AIRCRAFT FALL BY USING HELIUM GAS
Mohamed Alaaeldin Mohamed
Information Technoogy High School, Ismailia, EGYPT

New method have been developed for decreasing the possibility of aircraft crushing that may occur due to the fast/free fall by action of mechanical or fuel injection problems. This method is based on using of helium-bags inside the aircraft body, where these bags have to be distributed homogenously through the available spaces inside the aircraft. Helium has very low density (1.78×10-7 gm/m3) in comparison with air (0.31 gm/m3), so when helium replace air inside the aircraft, the total mass of the aircraft will decrease and its falling speed will be strongly reduced. The total volume of helium gas required to fill, the helium-bags, the fuel tank and the passenger’s cabinet were calculated for the aircraft Model A320. Twenty one compressed helium cylinders (at 200 PSI) are required with a total mass of 1155 Kg. These cylinders are connected in the lower part of the interior body of the aircraft and each cylinder was connected to a gas aspirator which speeds up the gas release from the cylinder. The maximum escaping time for helium gas from the cylinders should be 10 seconds. The present study was tested on a aircraft simulator model A320 in the Egyptian air lines station. The results indicated that, the mass of the simulator is much decreased in presence of helium and its falling speed was reduced from 444 km/s2 to 100 km/s2. The reduction in the falling speed will decrease the damaging effect that occurs from the strong bombardment of the aircraft with earth surface.

ALGAE TO OIL VIA PHOTOAUTOTROPHIC CULTIVATION AND OSMOTIC SONICATION
Evie Sobczak
Shorecrest Preparatory School, St. Petersburg, FL

This project offers a solution to obstacles plaguing the algae-to-oil pathway by designing equipment/processes to cultivate, harvest, extract and transesterify algae lipids into an energy positive biofuel. To enhance Spirogyra’s growth, a photoautotrophic bioreactor was engineered with 3 double walled rotating vessels containing mechanical/air agitation. Inner vessels were filled with algae solution. Outer vessels were filled with Helium, Neon, or atmospheric air to determine which gas filtered wavelengths resulting in the highest photosynthetic efficiency. A controlled chamber feed CO₂& O₂to the solution. A two-fold harvesting system was developed using ionic bonding and pH manipulation. Algae slurry was introduced to a pressurized osmotic sonication system engineered to frack cell walls and transesterify lipids. Photosynthetic efficiency rates showed Spirogyra cultivated under red-orange light filtered by Ne grew 14% more than algae cultivated under blue-green light filtered by He and 20% more than unfiltered natural light after 12 weeks of testing. Weekly CO₂airborne tests confirmed photosynthesis rates increased in direct proportion to CO₂consumption. pH monitoring confirmed, algae cultivated under Neon absorbed more CO₂. To facilitate flocculation, algae's CO₂diet was terminated and Na₂CO₃was added to increase pH. Through ionic bonding and IFAs, the algae cells formed a matrix using Fe₂O₃. Resulting Ne floc had a volume of 30cm³ versus 26cm³ for the He, and 24cm³ for the natural. Resulting slurry was placed in the “cellulose blaster” that engaged osmotic shock, homogenization and sonication for lipid extraction. Volumetric results revealed lipid volumes: Ne 1.8cm³,He 1.4cm³,Natural 1.1cm³. Lipids were transesterified into biofuel using Ba(OH)₂& CH₄O,ultrasonically.

A STUDY OF ZERO-CROSSINGS IN FRACTAL-GENERATED TURBULENCE
Nathan Vincent Greene
Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, Ingenuity Project, Baltimore, MD

This study’s main purpose is to consider the frequency of zero-crossings in turbulent flow and to examine whether these series of points resemble Cantor sets at a given deviation from the mean streamwise velocity. Flow is stirred by an active grid of acrylic winglets resembling three fractal designs: Sierpinski Triangles, Space-Filling Squares, and an Apollonian Packing design, with fractal dimensions of 1.58, 2.00, and 1.26 respectively; in addition to a control set of single-scale, solid winglets. Flow velocity measurements for each case of winglets are taken 20 mesh lengths (300cm) downstream from the active grid using hot-wire anemometry. Results from all cases indicate that zero-crossing sets best resemble fractal sets around ±1.5 standard deviations from the mean. Unexpected results were found: throughout a signal, fractal-based winglets produce non-fractal sets, while single-scale winglets seem to generate fractal-like zero-crossing series.

REPURPOSED MATERIALS SOLAR AIR HEATER WITH MIRROR ADDITION
Jamielee Rose Buenemann
Washington High School, Washington, MO

With the threat of global warming and rising fuel costs, modern society requires a simple, solar air heater created from repurposed materials. The present study sought to design a solar furnace with the following requirements: 1) consists of at least 60% previously used materials, 2) have air exhaust that is at least 20 degrees Celsius higher than ambient temperature, 3) costs less than $45 to manufacture. To achieve this, recycled material was gathered from industrial shipping waste, abandoned home scraps, and used aluminum cans. The present design takes advantage of air convection to move air through the heater and the conversion of electromagnetic energy to thermal energy. The ambient and the heater exhaust air temperatures were measured. The increase in temperature above ambient was 42 degrees Celsius. Mirrors were added to increase the amount of electromagnetic energy exposure to the black absorptive cans, increasing the internal temperature of the heater. The increase in temperature rose to 70 degrees Celsius when the mirror design was added. With a total budget of $40, the present design is an economically efficient resource for heating dwellings, greenhouses, and outbuildings. It can be used at any location because it is off the electrical grid and portable, resulting in worldwide applications.

CONFIGURING A BIPLANE AIRFOIL FOR PRACTICAL APPLICATION AND SONIC BOOM REDUCTION IN SUBSONIC TO SUPERSONIC FLOW THROUGH PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
Sumukh S Bharadwaj
Capital High School, Olympia, WA

The next step in aviation innovation is the mainstream implementation of supersonic technology to fulfill the needs of today’s fast-paced society. But supersonic technology poses two main problems; it results in a cacophonous noise which could be a hazard to people on the ground, and it is extremely inefficient. <br><br>To solve these problems, a biplane airfoil can be used as proposed by Adolf Busemann in the 1950s. But until now, this theory had been dismissed as highly impractical due to the design having major issues especially in subsonic flow. This project focuses on taking this impractical theory and optimizing it to a three-dimensional design that actually has practical application since the benefits of this can be tremendous.<br><br>For testing, 192 airfoil configurations with varying airfoil symmetries, sweep angles, angles of attack, and flow speeds were designed. Testing was performed in an industrial wind tunnel and through the use of a Computational Fluid Dynamics program to simulate subsonic and supersonic flow conditions with each trial. The lift and drag outputs of the iteration results for each airfoil configuration provided quantitative results about the efficiency of the airfoils while flow simulations provided qualitative data. <br><br>The results showed that the biplane airfoil configuration with 27° sweep and 0 chord midpoint extension provided 32% greater performance in subsonic flow compared to the unaltered biplane airfoil and even exceeded the status quo airfoil by 1%. Finally, the supersonic performance was 8% greater than the unaltered biplane airfoil therefore enforcing the practicality of supersonic biplane airfoils.

UTILIZING NOVEL GRAPHENE OXIDE LANGMUIR-BLODGETT FILM CATALYSTS TO ENHANCE THE COST EFFICIENCY OF A PEM FUEL CELL
Andrew M. Chen
Dougherty Valley High School, San Ramon, CA

In this paper, a study on the catalytic properties of graphene oxide (GO) in a PEM fuel cell system is reported. The GO was incorporated into a fuel cell by coating a monolayer of GO onto a Nafion® membrane using Langmuir-Blodgett deposition technique. The chemical and physical properties of GO were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. Before being coated, the membranes were subjected to ultraviolet-ozone treatment for 10 min in order to increase their adhesion to GO. An appropriate π-A isotherm (pressure – surface area) coupled with atomic force microscopy imaging of the coated membranes demonstrated that GO monolayer formation was optimized at a target surface pressure of 20 mN/m. As shown by performance tests, the inclusion of the GO coated membrane resulted in more than doubled the power output of the fuel cell, strongly suggesting that graphene oxide does indeed catalyze important reactions such as the oxidization of oxygen and carbon monoxide. Based upon these preliminary results, graphene oxide catalysts seem like a promising area of research which should be further pursued by researchers.

HHO ENERGY: A STUDY OF OXYHYDROGEN PRODUCTION AS AN APPLICATION FOR A FUEL SUPPLEMENT IN AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE
Julia Mariko Hirano
Waimea High School, Waimea, HI

Hydrogen is being used today in a fuel cell for cars to create electricity. Currently, there are challenges in storing hydrogen as fuel and it is highly costly. Creating oxyhydrogen (HHO), through electrolysis of water, would create “hydrogen-on-demand”. This hydrogen mixture is a cheap supplement to our existing gasoline for an internal combustion engine. We are receiving our fuel shipped in from millions of miles away, which is very costly, resulting in high gas prices for the American consumer. We need to find a way to become a self-sufficient country now that gas prices are at an all-time high. Considering our current economic times, there is a great need for a cheap alternative power source. <br><br> For my experiment, I wanted to investigate a fuel source that would be economical as well as limit the amount of waste in our atmosphere. Using an electrolyzer, I tested various surface areas in a HHO generator to see which could produce the greatest amount of oxyhydrogen gas. I tested generators with a surface area of 376.74 square centimeters (11 Plates), 573.94 square centimeters (19 Plates), 721.84 square centimeters (25 Plates) 869.74 square centimeters (31 Plates), and 1017.64 square centimeters (37 Plates). My control cell contained no washers with a surface area of 105.59 square centimeters. I predicted that in a oxyhydrogen generator, if the surface areas of the electrodes increase, it will produce a larger amount of hydrogen gas. Thus, this increase in hydrogen gas production when applied as a supplement to gasoline will increase the efficiency of an internal combustible engine. By identifying this problem, I hope to find a solution.

THE EFFICIENCY OF BIODIESEL FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES OF OIL
Irraj Iftikhar
Dutch Fork High School, Irmo, SC

There is a widespread interest in biodiesel but not a consensus on which source produces the most efficient biodiesel. The purpose of this experiment is to determine the efficiency of different sources in the production of biodiesel. The sources being utilized are jatropha oil, waste vegetable oil, corn oil, canola oil, and soybean oil. The oil contents of different plants can be compared and used to predict which source of biodiesel produces the greatest output. In this experiment, the same amount of each type of oil is to be started with initially. Then, the resulting sample is analyzed to determine efficiency. This project does not only look at total yield but also the quality of the biodiesel produced in order to accurately determine the efficiency. All of the sources being tested trump most others in producing biodiesel due to factors such as oil content. Jatropha has garnered a great deal of interest because of its oil content and ability to grow where other crops cannot. The results of this experiment rely heavily on the prices of the oils and the quality of the final product. The results will show that if the efficiency of biodiesel produced from different sources is compared, then jatropha oil will produce the most efficient biodiesel.

ENHANCEMENT OF BIOFUEL PRODUCTION THROUGH NOVEL BIOELECTROSYNTHESIS CHARACTERIZATION OF E. COLI
Sruti Arulmani
Glenforest Secondary School, Mississauga, CANADA

The rapid depletion of conventional fossil fuels has resulted in a growing need for bioethanol as an environmentally sustainable fuel with lower greenhouse gas emissions and fewer environmental impacts. Bioethanol is synthesized through the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose into glucose, which is then fermented into ethanol. This system is inherently limited by redox and metabolic constraints which restrict the ethanol production rate. Through a novel route to genetically manipulate the industrially robust microorganism Escherichia coli (sp. K-12 MG1655), this innovative research aimed to fundamentally alter the reaction mechanism to enhance ethanol production rates. This involved genetically manipulating E.coli with electron transfer proteins to induce microbial electrosynthesis in the cathode of a bioelectrochemical system. This innovative approach was expected to manipulate the NAD+/NADH redox imbalance through electrosynthesis and result in higher bioethanol outputs. The genetic characterizations occurred through plasmid transformations (pVP101, pEC86, and pLS279) to express specific electron transport proteins and metal reducing operons. The genetic properties were confirmed through gel electrophoresis and then mediated with neutral red for a chemically enhanced bioelectrosynthetic characterization. The metabolically engineered cells were compared to neutral red characterized E. coli and uncharacterized wild-type E. coli. The genetically engineered and mediated organisms resulted in a 27% increase in ethanol production and demonstrate the large scale feasibility of bioethanol produced from agricultural waste. This innovative model can be integrated into the current energy infrastructure as an environmentally sustainable fuel for transportation applications.

FUELS OF THE FUTURE: AN OPTIMIZED FUEL BLEND FOR LOWER EMISSIONS
Rajiv Jude Thamburaj
Brampton Christian School, Caledon, CANADA

Alternate fuels from agricultural products have had limited acceptance due to their high cost and land requirements. Converting agricultural waste to produce flammable oils through pyrolysis is a unique waste-to-energy solution but presents other challenges. Since it will be some time before such alternatives can completely replace gasoline, this research was aimed at developing an optimal fuel mix in which gasoline is blended with pyrolysis oils from wood waste, thereby combining the advantages of both conventional and alternate fuels. The performance of 900/1200 W generator sets operating on gasoline was compared with performance results on blends of gasoline, ethanol, and BioOil (a commercial pyrolysis oil). Measurements were made of fuel efficiency, energy efficiency, emissions, and exhaust gas temperatures over a full range of loading conditions. With the alternative blends, the engines operated significantly more efficiently (14.75% vs. 9.8% for gasoline), NOx emissions were reduced by 60% to 54 ppm, and exhaust gas temperatures were 30 °C lower. The blend formulated was an optimal “sweet spot” producing a large reduction in NOx without a significant increase in fuel cost. Also, a novel system for reducing CO and unburnt hydrocarbon emissions of alternate fuels by simultaneously using nanoceria (as a catalyst) and water injection was built and tested successfully. This was achieved by a simple modification to the engine air intake. Optimized fuel blends assisted by nanomaterial catalysts to enhance their combustion can replace gasoline significantly, reduce emissions, and ease the transition from fossil fuels to alternative energy sources.

THE CREATION OF A FEASIBLE WAVE-POWERED PIEZOELECTRIC GENERATOR
Dylan Alexander Globerman
Colquitt County High School, Moultrie, GA

1.4 Billion people still live without electricity today. Some are too poor to afford it, but many do not even have access to it. Not only that, but 93% of the world’s electricity is produced by dwindling fossil fuels; fuels that will have disappeared by 2050. If a resolution is not discovered, then many more than 1.4 Billion people will be without power soon. The Piezoelectric Effect(the display of electrical potential across the surface of a material when mechanical stress is applied) was discovered in 1880 by the Curie Brothers. There have been many applications of piezoelectric materials, but none in the form of mass generation of electricity. The purpose of this experiment is to successfully engineer a cost-efficient energy-generation process in the ocean-atmospheric interface that can, using piezoelectric materials, convert an ocean wave’s mechanical energy to Direct Current electricity. This device could be utilized to power Third World Countries and, eventually, a large portion of mankind. Using only materials located at the student’s high school, the student designed two prototypes of the piezoelectric buoy; one was successful, averaging 3.82 volts. Because of this proven data, this experiment and its outcome is rendered successful, in both purpose and goal.

THE EFFECT OF CDSE QUANTUM DOTS ON ORGANIC PHOTOVOLTAIC DEVICES
Dhruba Dasgupta
Little Rock Central High School, Little Rock, AR

Photovoltaic Devices are efficient renewable sources of energy. However, a major drawback of inorganic photovoltaic devices is that they are too expensive. Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) introduce a great economical alternative. However, OPVs exhibit poor efficiencies. Scientists are incorporating different materials into OPVs to make up for their poor efficiencies. Quantum dots (QDs), nano-semiconductors, exhibit the photoelectric effect and therefore could be used in OPVs. CdSe QDs were used to see if their photoelectric effect could improve the efficiency of OPVs. It was hypothesized QDs near the wavelength of 600nm within the Active Layer (AL) would increase the efficiency of the photovoltaic device since the OPV’s active layer absorbs best in that region. Two experiments were conducted, the first testing which wavelength of QDs produced the best efficiency, and the second comparing the placement of the QDs above or within the AL. The OPVs with QDs in the 600nm region and higher that were mixed within the AL resulted in a higher efficiency, 2.22% PCE, than the control device without QDs. The second test resulted in OPV devices with QDs within the AL to have a higher efficiency than QDs above the AL. Therefore, devices with QDs near 600nm that were within the AL were the most efficient OPVs.

NOVEL MATERIALS FOR ORGANIC SOLAR CELLS
Valerie Youngmi Sarge
Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, Lexington, KY

Organic solar cells have become increasingly viable due to the high costs of traditional fuel sources and the unwieldiness of silicon solar cells. The objective of this project is to develop renewable materials based on furans, rather than thiophenes (from petroleum) or carbazoles (synthesis-intensive), with the potential to yield higher efficiencies and to test different structures and parameters for solar cells. A new three-member-ring furan quinone base for electron donors was successfully fabricated and the synthesis partially optimized, beginning from a furaldehyde and utilizing oxidation, substitution, and dimerization steps. The properties of the molecule have been predicted to allow it to be functionalized into a number of sulfur-rich donors that demonstrate pi-stacking; as delocalized electrons should tend to concentrate in the pi orbitals, this should increase the overall electron mobility of the functionalized polymer. Thus, the derivatization of this base is hoped to create successful donors for use in solar cells. Additionally, several parameters of glass-substrate solar cells using traditional organic donors and acceptors were tested in comparison to plastic solar cells using the same molecules, showing the applicability of these models for testing as well as the possibility of further optimizing plastic solar cells for increased efficiency.

AN INVESTIGATION OF GAS DIFFUSION LAYERS AND THEIR EFFECTS ON THE PERFORMANCE OF PEM FUEL CELLS
Vijay S. Edupuganti
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland, OR

The proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell is a potential alternative for fossil fuel based energy systems. To improve fuel cell performance, individual components such as the gas diffusion layer need to be optimized. The effect on the performance of a fuel cell with each of eight commercially available GDLs was studied using three powerful electrochemical techniques: modular galvano, current interrupt and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Polarization curves were constructed to determine efficiencies of the eight configurations of the fuel cell. The results showed a variation of 14.3% indicating the influence of GDL on fuel cell performance. Randles equivalent circuit was chosen to fit the EIS experimental data in order to determine the parameter values of Ohmic resistance, double layer capacitance, charge transport resistance and diffusion (Warburg) impedance which gave insight into sources of impedance and their impact on fuel cell performance. The analysis of impedance results indicated that the optimal GDL design is one that exceeds the best parameter value within an impedance group. A better design over the eight commercial GDLs can focus on optimizing the characteristics of Ohmic resistance and Warburg impedance as they have the greatest impact based on the variance of values within each group.

DEVELOPMENT OF NATURAL DYE-SENSITIZED SOLAR CELLS USING LOW COST CONDUCTOR
Manuel Felipe Vasquez
Instituto San Carlos de la Salle, Medellin, COLOMBIA

The world’s annual energy consumption is 15 TW, which is mostly covered by non-renewable resources. As an ecological solution, the photovoltaic devices stand as a promising alternative, but the use of these devices for electricity generation is prohibitively expensive at the present, attributable to their high cost materials and production. Therefore, the dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) provide a solution of low cost materials, easy production and low environmental impacts. In this sense, the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) is a high cost material compared to the other components in the cell, and this represent between 24% and 64% of the total DSSC cost. To solve this issue about DSSCs, a novel TCO-less design is proposed in which the usage of aluminum foils as photo electrode and counter electrode is the main feature. In exchange of the expensive ruthenium dyes, DSSCs were assembled by using natural dyes extracted from the rose petals, because of their low cost, sustainably, and non environmental threat. With this novel design, it is obtained a short circuit current of 34.24 µA/cm2, an open circuit voltage of 0.145 V and a maximum power of 1.30 µW. Additionally, an economic estimation of the production cost showed a reduction of approximately 68%, which diminishes the costs from 90.64 - 49.60 USD/m2 to 35.36-17.69 USD/m2.

AERODYNAMIC PRINCIPLES OF GOLF BALLS: AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE EXTERIOR DESIGN OF HEAVY VEHICLES
Daniela Alejandra Plascencia Jimenez
Preparatoria del Tecnologico de Monterrey, Campus Guadalajara, Zapopan, MEXICO

The fuel inefficiency of heavy vehicles, contributes significantly to the financial and environmental cost of transporting goods. Vehicles rated over 4.5 tons. GVM (Gross Vehicle Mass) are considered heavy vehicles, but this project has focused only on articulated vehicles. The purpose of this research was to reduce the drag of heavy vehicles by applying the dimpled surface design of golf balls, which improves aerodynamics by delaying separation of the air boundary layer. The hypothesis was that the dimpled surface would decrease drag on heavy vehicles and improve their fuel performance. To achieve this, the heavy vehicle bodywork was redesigned implementing the dimpled surface of golf balls to improve the performance of fuel used in a route. The project was developed in two phases, the first of which was divided into three stages: 1) Design of the prototype, which was performed using the SolidWorks design platform 2) Test of the prototype’s aerodynamics through computer simulations, and 3) Analysis of data to verify the efficiency of the prototype. We found that the redesigned body decreases aerodynamic drag by 28.2 percent and improved fuel efficiency by 26.5 percent, thus supporting the hypothesis. The second phase will involve the redesign of the proved vehicle, looking for a more aesthetic design that will be built as a prototype and tested on a wind tunnel trial, in order to create an aesthetic vehicle with the functionality of a dimpled one.

EFFECT OF CONVERSION OF THE SUNLIGHT INTO ELECTRICITY OF THE KYLLINGA BREVIFOLIA
Andrea Marie Albaladejo Quiles
Brigida Alvarez Rodriguez, Vega Baja, PUERTO RICO

The search of economic, abundant and low pollutant compounds for the manufacture of solar cells led to this investigation. The problem was to determine if the photosynthetic compounds of Kyllinga brevifolia can be used to generate energy through a solar cell. The hypothesis established that if the photosynthetic compounds of green vegetative abundant scrub such as Kyllinga brevifolia are obtained, then these could be used as an organic semiconductor on solar cells for the clean production of electric energy. Two experiments were done, one using a wet solar cell and another one using a dry solar cell. The green pigments from the macerated leaves of Kyllinga brevifolia were mixed with water to construct a wet solar cell. The solution was exposed to the sun and the voltage was measured. This was also repeated with water without the green pigment to validate the experiment. Then other macerated leaves of the plant were mixed with only some drops of water to have a concentrated compound for the dry solar cell. The cell was constructed, was exposed to the sun and the voltage was measured. The DC power generated with the dry solar cell reached up to 852 mV. An energy accumulator was used to store the DC power produced which subsequently served to light a led. This leads to conclude that the photosynthetic green pigments of Kyllinga brevifolia can be effectively used for the production of “green” energy.

SOLAR DRYER
Laura Patricia Justiniano
Guamani Private School, Guayama, PUERTO RICO

Everyday energy cost is getting higher every time. How is it possible to construct a dryer that uses less energy and that is efficient and healthy for the environment. The hypothesis is that a solar machine dryer should be more efficient and cost effective than an electric or gas dryer. The Solar dryer is a “tumbler dryer” based on the concept of a solar water heater. This prototype machine is basically a plastic box covered with aluminum, and a plastic lid to maintain the heat inside. It contains a solar panel that provides 1.5V for ventilation and a battery circuit that provides 9V that makes the black painted cylinder rotate. It’s also accompanied by a movable device holding the Fresnel lens, which increases temperature to a range of 48-162 Celsius degrees, inside the chamber. This prototype was tested and its efficiency was evidenced. For each trial a piece of clothing was watered and squeezed to a certain point (as a washer would do). Then it was weighed and placed inside the cylinder for different periods of time. This same, watered and squeezed, piece of clothing was hanged outside for the same periods of time. After each treatment, both were weighed and the results were recorded. The results evidenced that for the same periods of time, the piece of clothing lost three times more water inside the chamber than when hanged. This type of solar dryer would be a significant contribution to society, since it would save energy and thus money.

THE EVOLUTION OF ALTERNATIVE FUEL PRODUCTION DERIVED FROM INVASIVE EURASIAN MILFOIL
Jasmine LouAnn Kreft
Trinity Christian School, Williston, ND

PURPOSE:To determine if Eurasian Milfoil can be a viable alternative fuel source for oil and ethanol replacing the commonly used food sources, soybeans and corn.PROCEDURE: Xylol was added to each of 10-50g and 2-150g samples of dried ground Eurasian Milfoil, 10-50g samples of ground soybeans, and 10-50g samples of ground corn.Samples were shaken and allowed to rest for the Xylol to permeate the mashes.The Xylol/oil mixture was separated, the Xylol was removed, and the oil collected and measured.The residual Eurasian Milfoil was collected and a mixture of distilled water and cellulase was added.Each sample was placed in an incubator.A hot water bath was used to heat mashes to deactivate the cellulase.The samples were allowed to cool.Distilled water was combined with Champagne yeast then added to the samples to begin the fermentation process.Airlocks were placed on the flasks and left undisturbed to ferment.Samples were run through a simple distillation apparatus.The ethanol that was produced was collected and data was calculated using a gas chromatograph.The residual mash was collected and dried to imitate building material.Samples of this building material were cut and were allowed to burn in a gas burner flame.Smaller square samples of building material were taken and placed on culture plates, with 5 plates swabbed with Streptomyces Griseus and 5 plates swabbed Aspergillus Niger, to test if there were any antibacterial or antifungal properties in the mash.DATA: average per 50g sample of Eurasian Milfoil:0.38g oil production, 0.072g or 0.072mL ethanol production. CONCLUSION: I was able to extract oil and ferment ethanol using Eurasian Milfoil, however enough product was not produced to be a feasible replacement for corn and soybeans with the processes that were used.

CAPTURING THE SPECTRUM: A NOVEL METHOD FOR THE ENGINEERING OF THE LIGHT HARVESTING WITHIN THE NANOSTRUCTURED ELECTRODES OF A DYE SENSITIZED SOLAR CELL
Devin Paul Cody
Germantown Academy, Fort Washington, PA

The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) has become increasingly promising as a supplier of cost-effective, clean, renewable energy. The efficiency of the dye sensitized solar cell, however, has been greatly limited by the disparity between the wavelengths of light the sun emits, and the wavelengths of light that the photosensitizer can absorb. <br><br>Here, a novel method for the low temperature selective positioning of dye molecules in a DSSC is presented. The method specifically works to grant tuning capabilities of the light harvesting within a DSSC. This method was used and optimized for use with two dyes: ruthenium-based N719 and idoline-based D149. These two dyes were chosen to demonstrate the ability of this method to produce solar cells with broader light harvesting abilities. This optimized DSSC was 12.1% more efficient than traditional N719 DSSCs and demonstrated larger incident photon to electron conversion efficiencies that were shifted towards the red and near IR region. <br><br>These results create a new avenue for solar cell research in which the internal light harvesting of the DSSC will be tuned to exactly match the solar emission spectrum. With this development, the DSSC may finally be able to utilize the entire spectrum.

MAXIMIZING THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF BIODIESEL PROCESSING: THE EFFECT OF THE ANGULAR VELOCITY OF AGITATION OF METHOXIDE AND BIODIESEL ON THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF A BIODIESEL PROCESSOR, AND AN ORIGINAL METHOD OF ZERO-ENERGY DRY WASHING ON THE PURITY OF THE PRODUCT
Meredith Rose Barr
Cheltenham High School, Wyncote, PA

The purpose of this project was to maximize the energy efficiency of biodiesel processing in order to increase the fossil energy ratio (FER) of biodiesel production. In doing so, I designed and built a processor such that energy usage was eliminated where possible, and minimized where impossible, and engineered an original system of dry-washing that uses no energy. I could not, however, hypothesize the value of an energy efficiency maximizing speed of agitation of methoxide or biodiesel without the regressions for time and power with respect to the speed of agitation, which could only be determined experimentally. I hypothesized that dry-washed biodiesel would surpass the standard for purity of 96%, and that the FER of my processor would be greater than the current standard.<br><br>I found the optimal speeds of agitation for methoxide mixing and biodiesel processing by running the processor at various speeds and taking samples to test for completeness of dissolution and transesterification, respectively, to determine the reaction time at each speed. I multiplied these values by their respective power requirements to determine the quadratic model of energy consumption, the minimum of which was the optimal speed of agitation for each process.<br><br>I determined the energy efficiency maximizing speeds for methoxide and biodiesel to be 3412 and 876.57 RPM, respectively. Average purity of dry-washed biodiesel system was 97.5%, and the FER of my processor was 10.6 as compared to the standard of 4.56. Therefore, the utility of my product was more than twice that of the current standard.

THE EFFECT OF MICROFULLERENES ON ORGANIC PHOTOVOLTAICS
Trisha Bhattacharyya
Little Rock Central High School, Little Rock, AR

Nanotechnology and alternatives energy sources are two of the trendiest topics in the science world, specifically molecular self assembly and solar power. Molecular self assembly generally refers to intermolecular self assembly, or the forming of shapes by a group of molecules. Photovoltaics, or solar cells, harness the sunlight emitted from the sun and convert it into electricity, thereby providing a much more environmentally friendly and reliable source of energy. However, the two concepts have not been combined in the manner that my project attempts to do. I attempted to observe the performance of solar cells that were modified by nanostructures. I created a solution that caused the molecules to self assemble and create nanostructures. I then used that to make the solar cells, and observed the effects and compared the cell performance to the standard solar cells. The purpose of this project was to determine the effects of microfullerenes on organic photovoltaic performance. Two different variables were tested: location of the microfullerenes and the type of alcohol (the type of alcohol changed the shape of the microfullerenes). Three different alcohols were used: propanol, butanol, and ethanol. There were two different locations that the microfullerenes were placed: above the active layer, and below the active layer. The results were then tested, and it was found that the cell with the butanol layer performed with the most efficiency.

YEAR TWO OF DEVELOPING ROBOTIC TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE A HANDICAP INDEPENDENT
Precious Naomi Martinez
Union City High School- AEA, Union City, NJ

It is estimated that 764,000 children and adults in the United States are diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy. Children with Cerebral Palsy are usually confined to motorized wheelchairs. Last year research was conducted at the First Cerebral Palsy School in Belleville, New Jersey where students, teachers, and therapists were surveyed to gain their perspectives on difficulties using current wheelchair technology. From the survey four problems were defined: height, width, weight and battery. Using a Mind Storms Robotics Lego Set I designed an innovative wheelchair prototype to help eliminate these barriers. My wheelchair can be in a seated position, and in a standing position, effectively making it a wheelchair and a stander. The scissor jack being inserted on the bottom allows elevation for the student. The height and weight barriers were eliminated. In the second year of my project, another survey was conducted to ensure there were no leading questions or bias. Based on the data I collected I then made innovative changes to the modern stander of my prototype by adding a chassis, meconium wheels, 3 robotic motors with different degrees of motion and a detachable joystick, which increased the effectiveness, and the usability of my wheelchair. The things that are easy for normal moving humans can be mission impossible for students confined to a wheelchair, now with my hybrid prototype they can be in control of their own movements.

A NOVEL SINGLE-COMPARTMENT CONCENTRATION CELL DRIVEN BY NATURAL EVAPORATION FOR GREEN ENERGY HARVESTING
Andrew Yang
Northside Health Careers High School, San Antonio, TX

Environmentally friendly energy sources such as wind and solar energy are becoming more important in our society. However, wind energy is unreliable, and solar energy relies on constant sunlight. <br><br><br>A novel electrochemical concentration cell (ECC) was developed for this study as an alternative device for harvesting green energy without having to rely on light or wind. A prototype was made with a porous cup filled with dilute (0.1 to 0.5 m) brine, which permeated through the cup wall. This permeated brine evaporated naturally and formed a concentrated (>2 m) brine film on the outside wall. One electrode was placed inside the cup and another electrode was attached to the outside wall in contact with the concentrated brine film. Voltage was generated between the two electrodes by the concentration difference maintained by natural evaporation. Because the prototype had only a single compartment for liquid, it reduced the components and the size of a conventional ECC. The single-compartment ECC solved the problem of maintaining the concentration difference in conventional ECCs. Both open-circuit voltage and power density data showed that the novel single-compartment ECC outperformed conventional ECCs. <br><br><br>In conclusion, the single-compartment ECC worked both indoors and outdoors. Toxic chemicals were not involved and the electrodes were not consumed in the overall cell reaction. The single-compartment ECCs could be a complimentary technology to solar cells and wind turbines, or used as environmentally friendly batteries for powering sensors, wireless communication devices and light bulbs, and charging cell phones, especially in remote areas where power is unavailable.<br><br>

HYDROGENOUS COMBINED HEAT AND POWER PLANT
Vladimir Osipov
MAO Lyceum #97, Chelyabinsk, RUSSIA

Hydrogen energetics nowadays is one of the leading and promising trends in the sphere of alternative energy sources. Considering the alarming trend, a lot of scientists and experts clearly declare in favour of advanced searching for alternative nonconventional power sources. Particularly, they turn to hydrogen, the reserves of which are inexhaustible in the waters of the world ocean. There is a number of known methods to decompose water: chemical, thermochemical, electrolysis and other, but all of them have a big disadvantage – in technological process of getting hydrogen the costly high energy is used that requires the consumption of deficient fossil fuels or electrical energy generated at power stations. Such a generation of hydrogen, naturally, will always remain uneconomical and ecologically dangerous and therefore as a result prospectless. That is why, nowadays, the issue of low energy concentration up to the necessary thermodynamic parameters becomes of current concern at the hydrogen synthesis. Last year, on the experimental basis in the conditions of the school laboratory we managed to prove the possibility to obtain hydrogen composite fuel using low energy. The method was based on the so-called "fuel cell" developed by an American, Stanley Meyer - a device that consumes small amount of electrical energy and produces a big amount of hydrogen-oxygen mixture from ordinary water. We developed the generator and made the calculations of resonator for low energy electrolysis. According to estimations we prepared the experimental device in order to prove the efficiency of electrolysis process. This year it was decided to incorporate the developed model into the energy complex with the purpose to obtain cheap heating energy.

THE IMPROVED EFFICIENCY AND ENHANCED LIFETIME OF A SOLAR CELL BASED ON MODIFIED PHOTOSYNTHETIC PIGMENTS
Nathan Sai Kondamuri
Munster High School, Munster, IN

New methods of harvesting solar energy are vitally important, as the depletion of fossil fuels is a major threat to our planet. The efficiency and lifetime of a photosynthetic solar cell was improved upon by incorporating chemically modified pigments to broaden its range of absorption. A custom LabVIEW computer program was designed to accurately determine factors contributing to the solar cell’s degradation. The characteristics of light illuminated onto the solar cell were varied, and the voltage of the solar cell was measured as a function of time. Based on factors contributing to natural plant degradation, high light intensity is likely the solar cell’s primary factor leading to photodamage in pigments. An experiment was performed, in which solar cells were illuminated with pulses of light at different intensities. The two solar cells followed different decay patterns, suggesting that degradation was likely due to photo-oxidative stress in pigments. The low photon to electron conversion efficiencies suggests that electrons were trying to jump to nearby pigment molecules, which occurs in natural photosynthesis. To inhibit this jump of electrons, phenol groups were attached to the light-absorbing porphyrin molecules. This created an electromotive force, which repelled electrons towards the reducing agent. Improving the electron transfer properties resulted in an increased efficiency of 56% and an enhanced lifetime of more than 200 minutes. This efficient, sustainable solar cell could be used in a wide array of applications ranging from global energy generation to powering small-scale devices in low light intensity situations.<br><br>

DESIGNING A NEW TYPE OF SAIL
William Lowell Monts
Hilton Head Preparatory School, Hilton Head Island, SC

Regatta competitors seek methods for increased boat speed to improve results. Could sail choice provide an advantage? Does wind speed affect choice? Sails are important because they harness energy to move the boat; this project tested two original sail designs to determine which sail generated the most force in different wind speeds. <br><br>Spinnakers are sails used downwind to improve speed. The novel designs evaluated were: a symmetric spinnaker with battens and a spinnaker with a straight luff and an open leech. A traditional symmetric spinnaker was used as a control. It was predicted that both innovative sail designs would pull with more force due their design features, maintaining equal area. <br><br>This project utilized a self-engineered sail car/track system constructed to accommodate individual rigging. The sail car was placed in a homemade wind tunnel designed to minimize turbulent flow. A spring scale’s force reading was used as a predictor of boat speed. <br><br>Scaled down spinnaker diagrams were self-designed. Nylon material was used to construct the spinnakers in an effort to imitate sailcloth. The same mainsail was used for all of the tests to realistically replicate a boat’s sail plan.<br><br>Each spinnaker was tested at three different wind speeds. A two-sample T test was conducted. Results failed to reject the null hypothesis. There is not significant evidence to support a difference in force generated for the spinnaker designs used. As long as sail area is equal, the shape of the sail does not have a major influence on downwind boat speed.

FRICTIONLESS FLOATING TRAIN, PART THREE
Matthew Thomas Sturm
Henry Perine Baldwin High School, Wailuku, HI

This project is an experiment using permanent magnets, electromagnets, and a super conductor to create a model of a magnetic levitating train, and demonstrate the properties of magnetic levitation. The two components of the project include the train car and the track. The track is made of five rows of permanent half inch cube Neodymium magnets, oriented North-South-North-South-North across. The “train car” is made of balsa wood with two YBa2Cu3O7 super conductors inside it. When the super conductors are cooled to their transition temperatures using liquid nitrogen, they become diamagnetic and the magnetic field of the track is forced around the car, rather than through it. The car is then trapped inside of the flux, a tunnel of magnetism that it will remain in even when the track is turned upside down or sideways. This causes the car to levitate above, and travel over the track without friction. In addition, the train car is just wider than the track, and has arms that hang down below the track, with a permanent magnet on each arm. The track is elevated 10 inches high by 8 steel legs. To four of these legs are mounted two electromagnets a leg, and one Hall sensor. The Hall sensor will detect when the train car is approaching, and signal the electromagnets to be powered at the proper moment, propelling the car forward. Between the two systems, magnetic levitation and magnetic propulsion, my project will demonstrate a form of near frictionless transportation.

BOOSTING CURRENT OF QUANTUM DOT SENSITIZED SOLAR CELLS WITH CDS/PBS HETEROSTRUCTURES
Alexander Darien Mobashery
Penn HIgh School, Mishawaka, IN

PbS has the ability to expand absorption and increase photocurrent in quantum dot solar cells (QDSCs). While PbS has several advantages, it also presents challenges when used as a sensitizer in solar cells with polysulfide electrolyte, including low open-circuit voltage (VOC), and photochemical corrosion. Inclusion of CdS with PbS improves QDSCs by increasing VOC and greatly increasing solar cell stability. By mixing cadmium and lead precursors, CdS/PbS heterostructures are formed; a technique unique to this study. QDSCs made from this combination of CdS and CdS/PbS show an overall power conversion efficiency of 2.86% (AM1.5G, 100 mW/cm2) compared to 1.79% for CdS QDSCs and 2.18% for PbS. The QDSCs prepared in this study exhibit the highest power conversion efficiency recorded to date using CdS/PbS heterostructures deposited via successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) process.

This research was carried out in order to determine a more efficient and profitable feedstock for the industrial production of ethanol. Doing so would result in great economic change in our country by eliminating the subsidies now in place and creating a new industry of ethanol production; while at the same time reducing our use of fossil fuels and preserving the world for generations to come. <br><br>The project began with the breakdown of feedstock. The method of breakdown varied between each feedstock, certain pH’s were required, and enzymes such as alpha amylase and glucoamylase were used. After the feedstock was prepared, then it was fermented with yeast and invertase for a period of 48 hours. After fermentation, the ethanol content in the air of the flask was taken with a Vernier ethanol sensor.<br><br>The control, corn, produced more ethanol than any other feedstock tested, averaging 191.35%. The only other substantial source of ethanol came from the feedstock jicama with an average ethanol content of 59.98%. Jicama’s preparation was shorter and less costly than the grain preparation of corn. A statistical analysis showed that there was significant difference between the ethanol production of jicama and corn. However, the Standard Deviation and Standard Error of the Mean were lower in jicama.<br><br>None of the alternative feedstocks produced ethanol amounts close to the ethanol content produced by corn. With more research and perfected methods, more ethanol could be obtained from jicama. More materials should be tested to find another substantial feedstock <br><br>for ethanol production.<br><br>

Considering that ocean energy has not been potentially used and is a renewable source of energy, we started researching on this subject.<br><br>Problem: The lack of a clean, cheap and renewable source of electric energy, due to the fact that most sources of electric energy now a days are based on contaminating systems that contribute to the pollution of the environment.<br><br>Procedure: We started researching about wave energy and the different factors that have to be taken into consideration to be able to build a working prototype. Afterwards we started designing our prototype and then taking our ideas to the reality.<br><br>Results: The prototype we built was able to work as intended in simulated conditions, where we simulated the wave movement, and let the prototype work by itself, showing that even in small scale we were able to generate energy. <br><br>Conclusions: The prototype worked as expected, and we think that waver power can be a viable source of energy in the future. The design of the project was achieved but can be improved.

How is it possible to use biological waste that accrues from daily housekeeping? <br><br>In reference to this question, we were curious to learn about the principles of a biogas plant and use these principles. <br><br>We used two variations of substratum; the first variant was composed of potato peels and the second variant was a mixed substrate of used coffee filters, tea, cabbage, etc.. As a comparison we also ran a test with corn silage, which is the most used substrate in conventional biogas plants. <br><br>Based on our results, we can say that the potential biological energy produced from the biological waste of each inhabitant of Bremerhaven (110,000 people), our city in Germany, in one year is enough to supply about 5,000 houses with biological power for one year.<br><br>It is very important to find an alternative to the monoculture of using corn or rape for producing energy in biogas plants in order to be able to use the land which is currently used to produce corn and rape to produce food crops. This would be useful for lowering the huge amount of food imported to Germany. <br><br>Also it is important to find an alternative to the fossil fuels. With our project we have found a very efficient alternative. <br><br>We found a new form to produce energy without fossil fuels.

Our life is based on electricity. Without electricity we won't live such a life as we do now. Our sources for electricity are now fossil fuels, and they are nearly used up. Our idea can be a part of the solution of this problem. The idea is not difficult, but it is really effective. We are going to generate electricity from waves. We do this by putting a big air balloon on the waves. If you have ever tried to put a beach ball in the water, you will have noticed that it comes up immediate. This is basically the principle our model uses, and we have done improvements to make the waves higher. For example, we have placed a plate to simulate a tsunami effect. So we can generate more electricity. Our calculations are showing that can generate more electricity than a solar panel at the same size. And besides, it is cheaper too.

It would interest you to know that your urine is not just a collection of metabolic waste but could be harnessed as a rich energy source. The project seeks to provide sustainable, cheap, clean energy source as a solution to the epileptic power supply in developing countries without the attendant consequences caused by carbon monoxide poisoning. The project works on the principle of electrolysis and energy conversion. The cover of a discarded dry cell compartment measuring 0.3m X 0.185m X 0.16m, was removed and the contents emptied. In their place, six stainless steel wire meshes, each measuring 0.25 m X 0.25 m acting as electrodes were inserted. Each of the cells was filled with urine mixed with 2M Na2CO3 in the ration 99:1. During electrolysis, hydrogen and oxygen gases are liberated at the cathode and the anode respectively. The gases were passed through water and borax to purify and dry them. The gas mixture was then fed through the valve connected into the carburetor of a modified engine of a 1.9KVA generator whose spark timing had been retarded by 110 since its engine was originally designed to be petrol-powered. This is because combustion needs to happen a few degrees after the Top Dead Centre when the piston is about to start its downward movement in the power stroke. The generator is jump-started using the manual pull-start. It works like the conventional generator.The direct current output of the generator is connected to the urine electrolytic cell to ensure continuous production of the gases which ensures the continuous running of the engine.The exhaust gas produced is water vapour, which is non-toxic, without carbon monoxide of conventional carbon based fuels. The project,if utilized, will go a long way towards producing cheap, clean and sustainable enegy.

COMPARATIVE STUDY OF A TRADITIONAL SOLAR DISTILLER AND A SOLAR DISTILLER WITH A COLLECTOR
Alfonso Ivan Ramos Ibanez, Brajan Nieto Espinoza
President of Perú, Lima, PERU

Solar distillation is an attractive alternative for many countries suffering from water scarcity. Due to this problem, many scientists and global organizations are interested in promoting the development of new green technologies. For example: the "United Nations Environment Program," published in 2008, the EIA guidance manual for desalination projects. Also, the scientific journal "Nature" published a recent study, focused on distillation, describes it as operationally intensive and very efficient method for using renewable energies.<br><br>This research aims to compare the efficiency of two type of distillers in order to verify the advantages of our own solar still. First, the traditional solar still or DST, which purifies salt water for domestic use with a simple method (through a transparent glass container). Second, the solar collector or DCS, with the aid of a flat solar collector, and a transparent container. Thus, the two distillers will be evaluated to determine the best solar water purification method using the experimental determination of the efficiencies.<br><br>On the other hand, two types of variables will be evaluated. Thus, the independent variables are solar radiation, the enthalpy (change of water to steam) and the volume of distilled water. The dependent variables are the efficiency of solar stills and the total distilled water. Consequently, the findings in this study show significant differences in the efficiencies between the DST and the DSC. Finally, we have found that our model, DSC is a good choice for purification of seawater.

COMPARING EFFICIENCY OF DIFFERENT BIOFUEL SOURCES

Our objective is to test olive oil, corn oil, and vegetable oil to find out which one produces the most efficient biodiesel with the most energy yield. The oils are turned into biodiesel through the process of transesterification. Then the energy yield is calculated by burning the biodiesel to produce heat energy and change the temperature of the water. This change of temperature is calculated using a homemade calorimeter and is then used to calculate the amount of calories produced and then energy yield. <br><br>After carrying out every test, plugging in the data to calculate the amount of Heat Calories and then Energy yield, and then finally subtracting the Energy Yield of the cotton balls burned for more accurate data, we calculated the average Net Energy Yield of each of the biodiesel types. Olive oil proved to be the best source of biodiesel out of the oils commonly used at home. In fact, a gram of Olive oil (118.85 Kcal/g) biodiesel produces about as much energy as the energy of a gram of Corn (63.1 Kcal/g) and of Vegetable (49.lkcal/g) combined. The slightly more expensive cost pays off in Energy Yield. This experiment also proves a potential relationship between the types of fatty acids, bonds, and the C number in an oil, and how much energy it will yield.

EFFICIENTLY INCREASING RATE OF HYDROGEN PRODUCTION IN WATER ELECTROLYSIS DRIVEN BY SOLAR ENERGY
Ibrahim Zuhair Al Saidi, Omar Al-Majeed Yared
Modern Montessori School, Amman, JORDAN

Since mankind ever existed, the journey for finding a source of energy to satisfy our needs and wants began. It grew more challenging as the need for environmental, clean, and energy dense sources of energy came along to replace the most dependable energy source and most polluting, fossil fuels. Hydrogen fuel is a potential solution to this problem. Hydrogen fuel can be obtained from water electrolysis. However, it is an inefficient process. Using basic lab tools and adding many factors to a basic water electrolysis system driven by a single photovoltaic unit, we were able to increase efficiency of the process.<br><br>It was discovered that magnetic field and number of catalysts such as aluminum sulfate and zinc chloride and others increased the rate twenty two times (from 0.27cm3/min to 6.00cm3/min). Moreover, after carefully studying the factors that had increased the rate, we designed and built a special container to test these factors. The container holds 20 liters of water, 24 magnets and 6 graphite cathode plates which are attached alternatively to the inner surface of the container. The container is attached to a stirrer to mix continuously the powdered catalysts such as aluminum sulfate and zinc chloride. One big graphite anode plate is inserted in the container through a chimney. The tank is designed in a way that prevents the possible mixing of hydrogen and oxygen gas produced. The system is operated by a 4 volt photovoltaic cell only. This unit produced hydrogen gas successfully at a rate of 6cm3/min despite the low voltage and current used in electrolysis.

NOVEL METHODS OF INCORPORATING GRAPHENE INTO ORGANIC POLYMER SOLAR CELLS
Sneha Chittabathini, Andrew Chen, Alexandra Tse
Lawrence High School, Cedarhurst, NY

Increasing organic polymer solar cell efficiencies is a major goal of photovoltaics. Problems with bulk-heterojunction cells include a disorganized active layer, thereby reducing efficiency due to non-maximized contact between the components; and an aluminum cathode that oxidizes. Bridging Au-graphene between the active layer P3HT and PCBM materials may increase the number of component interfaces. Additionally, graphene could be a substitute for aluminum because it is nonreactive, highly conductive, and has a similar work function. <br><br>Graphene oxide was synthesized and reduced with metal salts and NaBH4, forming chlorobenzene-insoluble nanoparticle-functionalized graphene sheets, which went into solution when P3HT was added. The gold nanoparticles were hypothesized to bond with the sulfur on the P3HT, while the graphene sheet bonded to the carbon buckyball through pi-pi stacking, thereby allowing homogeneous incorporation and increasing solar cell efficiency by ~50% over the control.<br><br>For graphene to replace aluminum, the difference in surface tensions between the hydrophilic graphene (suspended in EtOH/H2O) and the hydrophobic active layer polymers in chlorobenzene was overcome by exposing the active layer to UV/Ozone. AFM, contact angle, and ellipsometry analyses indicated increased hydrophilicity and a spuncast graphene film adhering to the active layer. Future work will include running solar simulations on solar cells utilizing graphene as the cathode. Also, different concentrations of gold nanoparticles will be mixed with graphene to determine whether increasing the number of gold-thiolate bonds will increase efficiency, moving closer towards our goal of providing emission-free, low-cost, renewable energy.

ETHANOL FROM ELEPHANT-GRASS (PENNISETUM PURPUREUM) – PHASE III
Ana Clara Rosa Stiehl, Tiago Herpich, Luis Bernardi
Escola Estadual Tecnica Sao Joao Batista, Montenegro, BRASIL

Lignocellulosic ethanol is produced through glucose fermentation derived from cellulose molecules’ breakdown. Nowadays, main research on ethanol from lignocellulosic materials is conducted with sugar-cane bagasse. First of all, saccharose is extracted from the sugar-cane and is used to produce first generation ethanol. What remains of the sugar-cane is used to produce second generation ethanol, from cellulose. Nevertheless, sugar-cane is demanding to the ground, can only be cropped twice a year and does not resist to rigorous winters, as occur in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Elephant-grass grows easily in almost every Brazilian region, without the need of fertilizers; in fact, it turns into weed according to the farmers. In addition, elephant-grass is highly productive and can be cropped four times a year for energetic ends. In this project, we compared sugar-cane and elephant-grass to produce fuel. The method is a compound of a pre-treatment with acid and base dissolute, followed by an acid hydrolysis in an open system with 1 atmosphere pressure in the cellulosic pulp, and biological fermentation of the formed glucose, generating ethanol. Elephant-grass showed 36.99% ± 1.45 cellulose in composition, while sugar-cane bagasse yield was 45.68% ± 2.2. However, elephant-grass can yield yearly potentially 3 times more cellulose per hectare than sugar-cane. Moreover, it showed higher production of glucose during the hydrolysis and, consequently, increased ethanol production.

DESIGNING, PROTOTYPING, AND TESTING AGRICULTURAL DRONES
Jordan Taylor Kuhn, Eric Chang
Christiansburg High School, Christiansburg, VA

This interim report details the first year of a two-year project to design and test cost efficient and safe aircraft to be used in seeding or fertilizing crops. This feasibility study was designed to examine the potential of utilizing a new approach to aerial “crop dusting,” since many modern craft used to do so are fuel-inefficient and dangerous to the user. Because aerial application is performed at very low altitudes to limit chemical spray, the use of a phenomenon known as wing in ground effect (WIG) in combination with hovercraft principles could result in a safer and more efficient aerial vehicle that also reduces spray even further by allowing the craft to get closer to the ground. During the first phase of research, background research was obtained and computer programs like JavaFoil were used to model the airflow around airfoil (wing) shapes and designs to find an efficient, stable wing (or wing pair). This phase began in 2012 and was successfully completed in January 2013 with the exploration and design of potentially very efficient and stable models. The second phase will involve fabricating and testing these models in free air and/or a wind tunnel to confirm the virtual model data obtained during the first phase and will be carried out by April, 2014.

THE PASSIVE ACQUISITION OF A VIABLE SOURCE OF BIO-ELECTRICITY FROM WASTEWATER WITH APPLICATIONS FOR HYDROGEN GENERATION: PHASE II
Jed Donald Grow, Andrew Ross
Clearfield Highschool, Clearfield, UT

Among the more prevalent issues facing the international scientific community is the demand to develop clean, economically-efficient, eco-friendly energy while simultaneously minimizing global dependency on fossil fuels. A series of studies were conducted to determine the potential use of wastewater as an efficient and renewable alternative to the expenditure of finite resources. Results gathered from previous year’s research were used to identify optimal testing conditions; from which five (5) fully-submergible water battery designs were constructed to further enhance electrical acquisition. A data-recording multimeter was used to quantify the energy obtained through each of the five battery designs by measuring both voltage (V) and current (mA) produced by simple oxidative reduction reactions. Testing revealed that PL-CB-003 (the most ideal location within the wastewater treatment facility for electrical acquisition) coupled with the Mach V battery design produced on average 67mA; an increase of more than 133 times (13,300%) from the .5mA obtained from PL-INF-05 during last year’s research. Further experimentation revealed that hydrogen gas (H2) could be created through electrolysis – passively – at a rate of 10ml/hr. Hydrogen production is proportional to the amount of wastewater exposed to the battery. More than ten-thousand (10,000) tests further validate the claim that wastewater is an invaluable resource with the potential to create large amounts of electrical energy and highly marketable hydrogen gas. Wastewater electricity could be useful in reducing the expenditure of finite resources such as coal, oil, petroleum, natural gas, etc., while simultaneously improving the global environment at an extremely low economic investment.

BIOETHANOL PRODUCTION BY FERMENTATION OF REJECTION BANANA
Mario Alberto Martinez Garcia, Dulce Franco Castillo
Centro de Bachillerato Tecnologico Industrial y de Servicios NO 172, Cortazar, MEXICO

The present research has as an objective to optimize bioethanol production by fermentation of rejection banana applying Design of Experiments (DOE) in each stage in the process. The first stage is a pre treatment-hydrolysis. This stage will break the polysaccharide chains to obtain a high concentration of reducing sugars. For this stage three factors that affect its effectiveness were determined: the grinding time to reduce the size of the raw material to increase its contact with the acid, the pH which the raw material was treated to break the polymers and time of thermal treatment to facilitate the hydrolysis of the macromolecules. Once the 3 factors were established, a factorial design 2^k was performed to study its effects over reducing sugars concentration. Each factor was designed with two levels: for grinding time were 2 and 3 minutes, for pH the values were 1 and 2, and for time of thermal treatment 25 and 35 minutes were used. Therefore, the factorial design resulted as 2^3 with 8 experiments and each one with three replicates. The results were analyzed with Minitab 15. The statistics that were used to analyze were a linear regression, a correlation index, ANOVA and Tukey table. These analyses showed with a confidence interval of 95% that experiment number 2 with an output of 28.02 g/L of reducing sugars was the most feasible according to its conditions (3 minutes of grinding time, pH of 1, and 25 minutes of thermal treatment). It was obtained an ethanol concentration of 20.47 g/L in the fermentation and is proposed a factorial design 2^3 to optimize this stage, considering as variables: sugar concentration, pH and temperature.

Energy crisis has reached its peak all across the globe, so it is time to look for alternative ways. Therefore, the Heat Retention Box (HRB) is especially designed for saving maximum amount of energy. HRB is not only cheap but also is beneficial in several other ways i.e. no fuel is needed, time is saved, less laborious work is required and also it doesn’t create a filthy environment. Its shape and size can vary from place to place and situation to situation. <br><br>The main objective of this project is to save energy while cooking the food. The HRB of 18”x18”x18” is based on thermal insulation with a wall thickness of only 3cm. It is made with Medium Density Fiber or 1/8” thick plywood and wooden sticks. It is lined with 3 layers of aluminum reflective foil backed with 4mm Polyethylene Foam (PE) and spaced at about 10mm with PE foam strips. The thermal insulation value is approximately Rᶜ=2.2m².K/W<br><br> <br><br>Let’s take an example of rice. Put some rice in water and let it boil. When it starts to boil, put it into the HRB, after that, the rest of the cooking will be done by the HRB. It can also be used as a food preserver as it can keep food warm for about 5-6 hours.<br><br> <br><br>Large energy savings can be obtained by changing cooking methods, equipment and behavior. It can be demonstrated that, for a large number of dishes, 75% energy saving can be obtained by using a HRB.

At our airfoil we had three different wires integrated in the wing: one at 25% of the chord, one at 35% and one at 45%. The best wire to use depends on the velocity and on the angle of attack. To show the difference between applied voltage and no voltage we used the polar diagram of the foil.<br><br>A reduction of drag means reduced fuel consumption and decreased CO2 emissions., so airplanes using our system would see 2 positive aspects:<br><br>- it´s environmentally friendly because of a decreased emissions<br><br>- lower direct operating costs for the airline because of the reduced fuel consumption

SOLAR ECO-KITCHEN: A SOLAR COOKER IN CONTEXT. THE CASE OF GUARNE, COLOMBIA
Yeison Ferney Castano, Juan Londono, Luis Escobar
IE Rural Hojas Anchas, Guarne, COLOMBIA

There are several solar kitchens available in the market that offer a great alternative to electric, gas, and wood cookers. Solar power is a clean energy that has great potential especially in the tropics were sunlight remains constant all year long and can be used as an alternative for low income rural areas, such as the one we live in. In this research project we evaluated the efficiency to heat things up, the easy to assemble and transport, as well as costs, of several solar cookers given our local solar intensity. Afterwards we compared the efficiency of three reflective materials (tin foil, gift wrap, and metallic cardboard) on the selected prototype. We found out that a parabolic type cooker, using an ordinary umbrella covered in metallic cardboard yielded the best balance of the three analyzed variables. Despite the fact that some models are more efficient in heating things up, the parabolic type solar cooker using an ordinary umbrella is a very good low cost alternative that adapts to local light conditions and it can be easily assembled and transported to take better advantage of solar radiation. In terms of materials, metallic cardboard had better cooking times (10oC higher) than other materials. The main issue with this type of kitchen is that it doesn’t allow more than one recipient at the same time; nonetheless it provides an excellent solution to basic local conditions. The results of this research will be socialized to the local community to spread its use.

CONSTRUCTION, CHARACTERISTICS AND MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF AN E. COLI-BASED FUEL CELL
Haris Nair, Samantha Prashad
Hastings High School, Hastings-on-Hudson, NY

Microbial fuel cells have the potential to provide an efficient and versatile energy source run solely on organic waste products. They function using microbes to catalyze an oxidation reaction that breaks down organic materials producing hydrogen ions, which, diffusing through a membrane preferentially permeable to them, create a charge differential and, therefore, an electrical current. In our experiment, we constructed a fuel cell using Escherichia coli and measured the electrical outputs over several runs. Variations to the setup, such as adding zinc oxide nanoparticles to the cathode solution or coating the membrane with graphene/graphene oxide or gold nanoparticles, were also explored; they showed qualitatively similar features, with some voltage enhancement for graphene/graphene oxide. A mathematical model based on differential equations for the reaction rates of nutrient/substrate consumption and the logistic growth function for the bacteria was constructed. For a suitable range of parameters, this model correctly reproduced the observed current outputs of the cell as a function of time. Our model has the potential to predict the electrical characteristics of microbial fuel cells in terms of the nutrients added, the concentration of bacteria and the reaction rates.

It is believed that this is the first report of the design and development of green, biodegradable flexible CNT/agar-cellulose-based rechargeable battery.1. Superior performance of the battery can be achieved through the use of three-dimensional structure of polymeric electrodes. Graphite and carbon nanotubes were added to further strength the electric conductivity of the battery. In this study, we propose a 3D electrode configuration design that combines the hierarchical structure of cellulose and cross-linkage that formed between cellulose polymer fibers and gelatin to facilitate the extraordinary ability in charges holding. Not only all polymer-based batteries, without using any metal component, but a new structure of thin, flexible carbon nanotube CNT-doped batteries were also successfully demonstrated. Over 90% of materials used in this design are biopolymer, which are biodegradable and green, and can easily found in agricultural waste and extracted from plants. The flexible CNT/agar-cellulose-based battery exhibits moderate charge capacity of 19.04 mAh g1 to 19.04 mAh gIn our research, two novel designs of doped agar-cellulose-based batteries were invented. Cellulose, extracted from plant, was cross-linked with gelatin to form the cellulose-based composite, followed by the gelation of agar and cationic polymerization of pyrrole to give a polypyrrole-agar-cellulose-based composite. Graphite or carbon nanotubes (CNT) serve as the dopant to modify the electrochemical properties of electrode. Generally, various biopolymer-based batteries show a moderate charge capacity ranging from 12.32 mAh g

In the present research cellulolytic bacteria were isolated from the intestine of the termites and Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeasts to obtain bioethanol from rice husk, which was pulverized and sterilized to prepare two mixtures of 750 ml with saline solution and a control. Mixture 1 was inoculated with the isolated bacteria and 1 g beer yeast, whereas mixture 2 was inoculated only with 1 g of yeast. These mixtures were incubated to 30ºC for 15 days. After this time, the DNS test was applied and turned out to be positive for the presence of sugar reducers in both mixtures, but negative for control.<br><br>Mixtures were filtered and distilled obtaining approximately 1.6 % of alcohol from mixture 1, but none from mixture 2, though a slight smell of alcohol was obvious. These results allow us to affirm that it is possible to obtain alcohol from the rice husk by means of its degradation with cellulolytic bacteria isolated from termite intestines of and Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast, nevertheless, it is necessary to optimize the process for major efficiency and performance.
