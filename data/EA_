EVOLUTION OF INITIAL ORBIT DETERMINATION ERROR CORRECTION FUNCTIONS BY GENETIC PROGRAMMING
Matthew Douglas Apau Jachowski
Maui High School, Kahului, HI, USA

Initial orbit determination is the preliminary calculation of an asteroid or satellite orbit from three observations. This project characterizes the error inherent to orbit determination by Laplace’s method and explores methods of correcting it. Nearly 1,500 observations of 16 different asteroids were extracted from a Jet Propulsion Laboratory database and used to calculate over 200,000 orbits. It was found that a poor choice of reference time is a significant source of error in Laplace’s method of orbit determination. Experiments revealed the preferable reference time – the average observation time – and exposed the significant error unnecessarily introduced into orbit determinations by the reference time suggested in most modern texts. Genetic programming was then successfully applied to evolve asteroid-specific semimajor axis error correction functions that decreased error in orbits by up to three orders of magnitude. The function evolved for asteroid 17 Thetis was also applied to other asteroids and was found to be effective in eliminating the semimajor axis error dependence on observation timing, effectively reducing the error correction problem to the determination of a single, observation-timing-independent parameter for each asteroid. Results suggest that completion of the semimajor axis error correction function, and asteroid-independent error correction functions for the other orbital elements, can be achieved through additional research. With applications to asteroids, satellites, and space debris, the results contribute to faster, more accurate orbit determinations requiring less data than current correction methods.

SEEKING THE STELLAR SPECTRUM: A TWO YEAR STUDY IN THE OBSERVATION AND ANALYSIS OF STELLAR SPECTRA THROUGH THE USE OF PHOTOGRAPHIC AND OPTICAL TECHNIQUES
Peter Justin Rossi
Land O' Lakes High School, Pasco County, Florida, USA

In Year I of the Study, a method of observation of stellar spectra, utilizing amateur equipment, was developed. The purpose of this year’s study is to develop a method of analysis that can be applied to the images obtained in Year I of the study.<br><br> I hypothesized that I would be able to obtain reliable images of stellar spectra utilizing the method developed in Year I of the study, including spectral images of stars not previously recorded. I further hypothesized that, through the development of an analysis protocol, I would be able to perform an in-depth spectral analysis, identifying such characteristics as chemical composition, age, stage, temperature, etc.<br><br> This year, I used a blazed diffraction grating in a setup developed in Year I of the study to obtain analyzable spectral images. I conducted analysis of the resulting spectra via an analysis protocol concerned mainly with measuring specific observable absorption lines in accordance with a reference spectra, assigning appropriate wavelength designations to specific intervals on the spectral image, then measuring distances, intervals, shapes, and widths of absorption and emission lines.<br><br> From my experiments, I conclude that the best method of spectral analysis is the “Reference Line/Angstrom Correlation” method. I conclude that when using this method, one can perform basic spectral analysis; however, the method does not allow for the identification of complex characteristics. I conclude that this finding was due to the resolution limitations of the observed spectra.<br><br>

CAN AN ALASKAN EARTHQUAKE AFFECT THE ARSENIC LEVELS IN MINNESOTA WELL WATER?
Jennifer Marjorie Moldan
New Ulm Cathedral High School, New Ulm, Minnesota, United States

The purpose of this project is to find out if an Alaskan earthquake on November 3rd, 2002 affected 12 wells located in south central Minnesota.<br><br>The approach was to retest the 12 wells located in a 600 square mile area of south central Minnesota after the Alaskan earthquake. Samples taken in February of 2002, before the earthquake, were also tested. A thirteenth well was introduced to test the theory that an earthquake will increase the level of arsenic in the well water. All 26 well water samples were tested in a certified laboratory.<br><br>The results show that five wells were unchanged, five wells had increased arsenic levels, and two wells had decreased arsenic levels. Wells 1, 7, 9, 10, and 12 had no change in the level of arsenic present. Wells 2, 3, 4, 6, and 11 showed an increase in the arsenic levels. The range of this increase was from .15 ug/L to 17.9 ug/L. Well 5 and well 8 had a decrease in arsenic levels. Well 5 decreased 13.21 ug/L, and well 8 drastically decreased 25.5 ug/L. My simulated well 13 also showed a decrease in the levels of arsenic. The water sample taken from the well was at the level of 12.3 ug/L. The sample that was agitated resulted in an arsenic level of less then 1 ug/L. The results show that there is a good possibility that levels of arsenic will either increase or be unaffected. <br><br>

IDAHO TORNADO CLIMATOLOGY
Paul Martin Hoffman
Upper Arlington High School, Upper Arlington Ohio, USA

Tornado dynamics is a pressing and popular issue of scientific research, but focus on the Midwestern states excludes other important areas of tornado occurrence. The purpose of this study was to examine the large and small scale dynamics of tornado formation in Idaho, thus exploring tornado dynamics in a more uncommon topography. Using sounding data, a binary logistic regression and discriminant analysis were performed to reveal any correlations between small scale dynamics and tornado formation; the results showed poor models and thus no strong correlation. In order to analyze the large scale dynamics relating to Idaho tornadoes, composite analyses were performed to determine pressure gradients and frontal patterns. This analysis resulted in five large scale patterns in tornado formation defined by: a mid-latitude cyclone with Idaho in the warm sector, cold fronts passing over Idaho from west to east, large baroclinic zones, mid-latitude cyclones in which Idaho is in the cold sector, and instances of no distinctive weather features. The original small scale data set was retested to find correlations within each pattern. Small scale models for each of these patterns show strong correlations between temperature and pressure gradients and Idaho tornado formation. This conclusion is due to the significance of the variables SWEAT, K index, and Showalter index. Therefore frontal lifting is less significant in Idaho tornadoes, which is in strong contrast to Midwestern tornado occurrences.

A RAPID, ACCURATE METHOD OF DETERMINING THE DISTANCE TO NEAR-EARTH ASTEROIDS
Lisa Doreen Glukhovsky
New Milford High School, New Milford, Connecticut, USA

Most people have only recently become aware of the threat posed by possible cosmic object impacts with Earth. Although extremely energetic impacts are rare, they have occurred in the past and will happen again in the future. The first step in preventing such events is discovering potentially hazardous Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) and verifying their orbits. In this project, the distances to several Potentially Hazardous/ Near-Earth Asteroids (PHAs/ NEAs) were determined. This was done by simultaneous telescopic imagery, using amateur astronomy equipment, from observatory sites separated by a long baseline distance. Observatories were located in Europe and the U. S. and operated by high school students or amateur astronomers. After successful imaging sessions, the target asteroid’s positional coordinates were determined with image processing / astrometry software. A computer spreadsheet was created to calculate the distance to the asteroid, using the observed parallax shift between simultaneous images. Meaningful contributions to science were made; fourteen highly accurate observations were submitted to the Minor Planet Center, enabling NASA to refine the orbits of the target asteroids. The overall accuracy of this method far exceeded original expectations; there was little difference between determined distances and NASA’s JPL’s predicted distances. The determined distance error was consistently less than 1%. This project has shown that simultaneous imagery with modern amateur astronomy equipment and techniques is a viable and repeatable way to determine the distance to NEAs. This method of ranging may become a useful new tool in NEO research, especially for refining newly-discovered NEO orbits. <br><br> <br><br>

COMPOSITIONAL CONTROLS ON SOIL STRENGTH UNDER STATIC AND NON-STATIC CONDITIONS
Sarah Evelyn Brophy
Bloomington High School North, Bloomington, IN, USA

Landslides are caused by gravity. Two important factors that govern the occurrence of landslides are soil strength and earthquakes. The composition of the soil determines how strong it is, but when shaken, any soil loses some of its strength. This experiment was conducted to find the force at which certain types of soils break apart under both static (stationary) and non-static (shaking) conditions. Different mixtures of sand, silt and clay were mixed, dried into large bricks, and then cut into 3" x ½" x ½" blocks, which were securely held in a clamping device. Static experiments were conducted by extending 1½" of the soil block over the edge of a table, then hanging different weights from each block until they broke. Non-static experiments were conducted by securing the clamping device to the bed of a shake table and then following the same procedure. Non-static experiments were conducted at shaking frequencies of 10.00 and 20.00 Hertz. The experimental results indicate that the strength of a soil increases with the amount of clay. The effect of shaking on all soil compositions was to reduce their strength. All samples had lower strengths at a shaking frequency of 10.00 Hertz than at 20.00 Hertz, implying that lower frequency shaking reduces the strength of a soil more than high frequency shaking. This would suggest that low frequency (surface) seismic waves should be more likely to cause a landslide than high frequency (body) seismic waves, which is the common observation.<br><br>

CHALLENGING THE THEORIES OF DARK ENERGY AND THE EXPANDING UNIVERSE WITH PHOTON DRAG MECHANISMS
Peter Alexander Lee
York School, Monterey, California, USA

Challenging the notion that intergalactic redshift is caused solely by Doppler-style galactic recession, this project identifies and characterizes two non-Doppler causes of redshift to determine whether these tired-light photon energy loss mechanisms, gravitational drag and electric field drag, contribute to intergalactic redshift, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for the stop-gap theory of dark energy. To evaluate these mechanisms, two physics-based computer models were written to analyze gravitational drag and electric field drag. The models successfully characterized gravitational drag and electric field drag and determined that they contribute at least part or perhaps all of observed intergalactic redshift. In light of these results, the Doppler effect must play a smaller role in causing redshift, which means that the universe is expanding more slowly, if at all, than is currently believed. Consequently, dark energy may not exist.

ABSORBENCY AND THERMAL CONDUCTION OF PRIMITIVE CERAMIC REPLICAS: ASSESSING VARIATION IN CLAY SOURCES AND TEMPERING MATERIALS PHASE 3
Amy Elizabeth Marquardt, Mediapolis High School
Mediapolis, Iowa, United States of America

This experiment was designed to test the effects of temper on water absorbency and thermal conduction in clay ceramics. It was hypothesized that the bowls with no temper and bowls tempered with clamshell would conduct heat more efficiently. The bowls tempered with clamshell would hold water longer. Tallow lined bowls would greatly affect water absorption and thermal conduction.<br><br>Six tempers, clamshell, grass, grit, grog, limestone and sand, and four clays were wsed to make twenty-eight bowls. The control consisted of bowls made from each clay type without the addition of a temper. To test water absorbency, fifty milliliters of water was placed in the bowls and the absorbency rates were recorded. To test thermal conduction, one hundred milliliters of water was placed in the bowls and heated to one hundred degrees Celsius or for fifteen minutes; the temperature of the water was recorded every five minutes. The water absorbency and thermal conduction tests were repeated using tallow lined bowls.<br><br>The highest percentage of bowls reaching the boiling point was the sand tempered clay bowls. All lined bowls absorbed less water and reached boiling point more quickly than unlined bowls. The non-tempered bowls had the lowest porosity. The grog tempered bowls had the highest porosity.<br><br>In conclusion, the clamshell tempered bowls were not the most efficient at heat conduction. The clamshell tempered bowls did not hold water longer than the others. The tallow lining signigicantly changed the water absorption and thermal conductivity rate.

THE EFFECT OF OXYGEN SUPPLY ON THE POWER CURVE OF A HYDROGEN FUEL CELL
Terri Beth Watson
Owensboro High School, Owensboro, KY, USA

The purpose of my project was to investigate the effect of oxygen supply on the power curve of a hydrogen fuel cell. Testing utilized a solar cell, electrolyser, fuel cell, and a load measurement box. I filled the electrolyser, which was connected to the solar cell, with 10ml of distilled water. The electrolyser decomposed the water into hydrogen and oxygen gases. The gases were sent through tubes to the fuel cell to purge the system. The system was then closed with stoppers and hydrogen was stored in the gas storage cylinders. When the level of hydrogen reached 10ml, power was disconnected. The fuel cell was connected to the load measurement box. After varying the resistance and waiting 30 seconds at each resistance, I recorded the values of voltage and current. I repeated the experiment and removed the tube that supplied oxygen gas. The fuel cell would now get its oxygen through air diffusion. I recorded the measurements as before but waited 2 minutes at each resistance since equilibrium takes longer through diffusion only. The entire process was repeated 10 times with results recorded on the data table. Using the the data I plotted both the characteristic and power curves of the fuel cell. From my research I found that there is a strong relationship between the method of oxygen supply and the power curve.

NAVIGATING THROUGH SPACE: CONTINUOUS THRUST TRAJECTORIES IN 3-D
Ulyana Nadia Horodyskyj
Padua Franciscan High School, Parma Ohio, USA

This research examined 3-D motion of a solar sail, a method of space propulsion that needs no fuel. Instead, it uses sunlight and gravity to generate continuous thrust. The relationship between thrust, mass-to-area (M/A) ratio, and the solar sail’s 3-D orientation as determined by its “cone” and “clock” angles was investigated. The hypothesis was that a solar sail’s maximum displacement in the z-direction (out-of-plane) occurs at the same combination of cone and clock angles independent of the M/A ratio.<br><br>A MATLAB computer simulation was developed to model interplanetary solar sail trajectories in 3-D taking into account the differing orbital inclinations of the planets as they travel around the sun. An unusual figure was discovered that related thrust magnitude and orientation to cone and clock angles. A parametric equation for the curve was developed. Maximum z-displacement was found to vary with M/A ratio, as well as with sail orientation.<br><br>This result was used to develop 3-D solar sail missions to Mars, building upon previous work that found numerous 2-D trajectories using a genetic algorithm. Solutions to selected missions in 2-D were re-evaluated using an improved genetic algorithm incorporating concepts from geometric algebra and differential equations. With minor adjustments to the sail’s cone angle, it was possible to reach Mars in 3-D space by matching the revised cone angle with the appropriate clock angle. Thus, the set of 2-D mission parameters previously developed can be expanded to include motion in the z direction to perform a successful rendezvous with Mars.<br><br>

COSMOLOGICAL PARAMETERS FROM STANDARD CANDLES WITH INCOMPLETE REDSHIFT INFORMATION
Tamara Ann Broderick
Laurel School, Shaker Heights, OH, USA

In the past, error in the measurement of redshift has largely been ignored in the estimates of the probability distributions of the energy density of matter (omega matter) and the equation of state of the predominant form of energy in the universe (w) since the error in data collected using spectroscopy is negligible. However, the shortage of redshift data and the proposal of new studies encourage the use of a more efficient but less precise method: photometry. <br><br> The purpose of this project is to ascertain the effect of redshift error on the probability distributions of omega matter and w. The initial approach involved solving directly for the spread in the distributions using the Fisher Matrix, derived from the multivariate Gaussian distribution. The addition of each redshift variable as an independent parameter, though, generated the computational dilemma of calculating the inverse of an exceedingly large matrix. Therefore, as a second attempt, a Monte Carlo simulation was designed in Visual C++ and Maple 7. This model entails selecting an arbitrary omega matter and w; these values determine a curve for magnitude as a function of redshift. From the Gaussian distributions at certain points along this curve, simulated points are then generated, and one may calculate the likelihood from the chi-squared distribution that omega matter and w pairs within certain ranges fit these data. These likelihoods define probability contours, which may be averaged over many iterations to display a good approximation of the spread in the parameters.<br><br>

THE IRIS HYPOTHESIS: IS CLOUD CONVECTION IN THE WARM POOL AN INDICATOR OF GLOBAL WARMING?
Aneesh Keshav Venkat, York High School
Yorktown, Virginia, United States of America

The objective of this investigation was to investigate the validity of the Iris Hypothesis, which states that clouds have a cooling effect on global temperatures. Towards this objective, an initially developed CO2 based prediction model was further refined to include the effect of clouds and aerosols on global temperatures. The results based on the revised model indicated a substantial increase in the temperatures over the next 100 years.<br><br>First, theoretical blackbody temperatures were calculated by solving Kepler’s Orbital Equation using the Newton-Rhapson method and by computing Earth’s orientation geometry as it revolved around the sun. Next, the temperature and cloud optical depth data from the Warm Pool, located off the coasts of Indonesia and the Philippines, was modeled and a correlation between them was obtained. Future cloud optical depths were extrapolated for the next 100 years using cloud-modeling techniques. The relationship between optical depth and albedo was then determined. The albedo predictions were then used to solve for future temperatures. The results showed a 5.4 degree Fahrenheit increase in temperatures in the Warm Pool over the next 100 years. <br><br>The model takes into effect the capability of clouds and aerosols to reflect or absorb incoming shortwave radiation from the sun, as well as longwave radiation coming from the Earth’s surface. The results negate the Iris Hypothesis, with the prediction of increasing temperatures in the future. Future studies will focus on the effects of atmospheric circulation on global warming.<br><br>

AVALANCHE PREDICTION USING HIGH FREQUENCY RADAR
Adam Maerz
Monarch High School, Louisville CO, U.S.A.

Avalanches are costly and deadly natural phenomena that occur in any region that receives significant snowfall and has hilly or mountainous terrain. An avalanche occurs when the downhill force of the snow is greater than the opposing force the snow itself can supply. At this point the snow will fall down hill, in many cases with devastating and deadly results. <br><br> Using high frequency Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) it should be possible to measure the layers within the snowpack. This method would be more efficient and reliable than current prediction methods. <br><br> Initial testing was done with a commercially available 1 GHz GPR unit. A snowpit was dug to collect actual snow data, then the radar was passed through the snow at several undisturbed locations. The radar data was compared to the snowpit, and conclusions were drawn. In subsequent testing, a Denoth Meter and a Snow Fork were also used to compare the dielectric constant of the snow to its density. This was done to establish the credibility of the relationship between the electrical conductivity of the snow and its physical properties. <br><br> Experimentation found that the 1 GHz frequency range is too low of a frequency for the detail needed to measure the snow pack. Other experiments have shown that the dielectric properties of snow can be useful, but currently GPR is unable to produce the results necessary.<br><br>

GRANULAR FLOW USING THE HELE-SHAW CELL
Joseph Bradley Campbell
Jonesboro High School, Jonesboro Arkansas, United States

The purpose of my experiment was to see how increasing the width of the spacers in a Hele-Shaw Cell affected the layering of a mixture of sand and salt. My prediction was that as I increased the size of the spacers, the size of the layers would also increase.<br><br> To conduct my experiment, I first constructed a Hele-Shaw Cell using 1/8in spacers. I then made an equal mixture of sand and salt, mixted it thoroughly, and poured it into the cell from a bottle with a small nozzle. When the bottle was empty, I took a picture of the cell, repeated and took another picture. Thus, I had two different examples of of the cell with the same thickness. I then increased the thickness of the spacers by 1/16in. I repeated so I had two examples of that cell. I then repeated the whole process two more times, thus have two results for 1/8in, 3/16in, 1/4in, and 5/16in spacers.<br><br> I then collected the average thickenss of the layers in each cell:<br><br>1/8in#1: Sand .1212in Salt .1516in<br><br>1/8in#2: Sand .1246in Salt .1154in<br><br>3/16in#1: Sand .0926in Salt .1098in<br><br>3/16in#2: Sand .1036in Salt .1194in<br><br>1/4in#1: Sand .0860in Salt .1054in<br><br>1/4in#2: Sand .0840in Salt .0888in<br><br>5/16in#1: Sand .0760in Salt .0996in<br><br>5/16in#2: Sand .0710in Salt .0830in<br><br> As you can see from the data I collected, as the spacer thickness was increased, the layer size decreased. This is opposite of what my hypothesis predicted.

THE EFFECTS OF PYTHIUM ON THE GROWTH ON SOYBEANS IN THE PRESENCE OF A COMPLEX BACTERIAL COMMUNITY IN A HYDROPONIC SYSTEM.
Zyanya Lucia Zatarain
Palm Bay High School, Melbourne, Florida, USA.

The purpose of this experiment is to test the effect pythium has on a soybean plant, in the presence of a complex bacterial community. <br><br> In order to collect data the researcher built eighty hydroponic systems. Once these were set up, the researcher proceeded to germinate 300 soybean seeds. Once the seeds germinated they were placed in each system and were left there for 9 days to adjust to their environment. <br><br> The researcher created a complex bacterial community by collecting a sample of water from a pond and filtering it. The water was plated using V8 juice, if pythium was present it would grow and be observed in two days. No pythium was observed, however, and the only growth was that of bacteria. The bottles were divided into four groups. The first group is the control, no pythium or bacteria is added to the rhizosphere. The second group only bacteria is added. In the third group, only pythium is added. In the fourth group both pythium and bacteria are added to the rhizosphere. Afterward bacterial and pythium inputs took place, and the researcher proceeded to take measurements of each plant's height, and recorded each plant's health using a scale devised by the researcher. <br><br> In conclusion, Group A, the control group, had average plant health and height. Group B with the bacterial input had a little below average plant health and height. Group C, in which a pythium input took place was the one in with the lowest average plant health and height. The height and health of the plants in group D was the highest over all the groups.

The need for an answer to the question, "What chemical variations produce improved barite crystals?" influenced experiment design.<br><br> The develpoment of u- tubes were set to contain a collagen gel, barium acetate, and magnesium sulfate. The two chemical substances diffused through the gel matrix to unite in the center of the u- tubes. Thus, inflicting a chemical reaction that produced microscopic barite crystals. A double displacement reaction equation demonstrates this occurence.<br><br> Ba(C2H3O2)2 + MgSO4 --- BaSO4 + Mg(C2H3O2)2<br><br> Varied amounts of each chemical were added to u-tubes labeled x,y,z. Barium acetate to magnesium sulfate ratios were, 3:2, 2:3, 1:1. Observed diffusion rates of solutions were recorded. Final prepared samples were tested under the Scanning Electron Microprobe (SEM) which displayed the rosette crystals forming in the identical habit as naturally occuring barite encountered in Oklahoma. In analyzing chemical compositon, weight percent was established and was found to be barium 59.82%, sulfur 13.30%, and oxygen 26.88%, which is closely identical to the chemical weights of pure barite. <br><br> Previous attempts by others in growing barite crystals indicate inconsistent rosettes, instead, showed "butterfly" twinning. Also, beliefs of sand and iron needed for development of rosettes were negative. I percieve that adequate amounts of sulfur is needed for the rosette growth habit.<br><br> The objective of exploring better barite crystals could determine advancements in medical, industrial, and space field research.

FIREWORKS FROM THE SUN
Cornelius Nicolaas Beyer
High School Garsfontien / Pretoria / Gauteng / South-Africa

The most important part of our solar system is the sun. It influences nearly each aspect of our lives and technology. Solar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CME’s) on the sun, cause Geomagnetic Induced Currents (GICs). These GICs can be harmful to transformers and reactors of electricity providers. The cost of power system damage, involve not only the replacement of damaged equipment and long repair times, but also the loss of revenue from sales of power. Therefore the study of this phenomenon is crucial for electricity providers in any country <br><br> In co-operation with ESKOM (South Africa’s Electricity Utility) and the Hermanus Magnetic Observatory (Western Cape South Africa), the possibility of the existence of GICs in South Africa at geomagnetic latitudes of about 30 degrees in the Southern Hemisphere, was researched. Reliable data from the NOAA Space Environment Centre was processed to find the correlation between the amount of sunspots and the total number of solar flares. Using the magnetograms from Hermanus, magnetic disturbances above South Africa (Which caused GICs), was proven. With the assistance of ESKOM I was able to get information to prove and monitor GICs at latitudes as low as 30 degrees south and research their influence on power lines in South Africa. A strong correlation between transformer breakdowns (In South Africa) and the solar activity on the sun, of a specific day, could be drawn.<br><br> We need to study this phenomenon, not only in countries where it is common but also in countries, we think it might happen, like South Africa.<br><br>

WATER ON MARS: WHERE WAS IT, WHERE IS IT NOW?
Erin Lynn Frey
South River High School, Edgewater, Maryland, United States of America

Both the discovery of gullies and the detection of large amounts of hydrogen on near surface Mars have led to the question of the nature and depth of the water table. The hydrogen data is believed to indicate the presence of near surface (upper meter) water or ice. Gullies may indicate seepage of groundwater from deeper layers. This project studies the possibility of a relationship between these two, in order to better determine the likely extent of the water table on Mars. Topographic data was used to determine the depths at which the gullies begin in four study areas with varying amounts of near surface water (as inferred from the hydrogen data). This study showed that gullies in dryer areas begin on average at greater depths than gullies in water rich areas, and that in progressively dryer areas, the average depth of the gullies linearly increases. Also, in increasingly desiccated areas, the range of depths at which gullies form becomes greater. Therefore, the water table in hydrogen poor (desiccated) areas on average begins further from the surface but extends for greater depths than the water table in hydrogen rich (water rich) areas.

X-RAY FLUORESCENCE ANALYSIS OF CHEMICAL COMPOSITE OF SEVIER LAKE
Emily Kate Toone
Bountiful High School, Bountiful, UT, USA

This project is part of a larger research project on Sevier Lake started in 1978. 25 years ago a saline-resource assessment program of Sevier (dry) Lake, Millard County, Utah, was started by Crystal Peak Minerals Corporation. Research was gathered mostly pertaining to the quantity of brine-salt and sentiment.<br><br> The research done in my project pertains to the general flow and quantity of chemical settlement in the top 5 foot interval of sampled mud. Being that Sevier Lake is the terminus of a 280 mile long river, Sevier River, chemicals would be washed into the lake bed from along the path of the river. Once the water from the river reaches the lake bed it generally flows into a small deep area of the lake bed. Assuming that the resting water would allow chemicals to settle out and the process of evaporation would leave behind a concentration of chemicals; my hypothesis states the most dense concentration of the majority of the different chemicals would be in the deepest part of the lake bed. <br><br> Using the samples that had been previously collected I made individual analyzable discs spanning across the area of the lake. The discs were then analyzed by an XRF (X-Ray Fluorescence) spectrometer. The results from the spectrometer were put into the Microsoft Word program. In the Surfer 7.0 program the files were imported and made into different kinds of charts to represent the movement of the different chemicals throughout the lake bed. It was generally found that majority of chemical concentrations were hightest in the area where the lake bed is deepest.<br><br> This project is useful to the mining corporations, because it presents a general pattern of the concentration of the chemicals in a lake bed and in the area around the lake bed. Chemicals could be mined for profit as is done in the Great Salt Lake and other lakes without outlet.

ANALYSIS OF WAVE CHARACTERISTICS OF SEISMIC WAVES PRODUCED BY MINE BLASTS
Christopher Michael Short
Northview High School, Brazil, IN, USA

Lists of mine blasts conducted between September and December 2002 were gathered for six mines in Clay County and surrounding Indiana counties. The list included data (referred to in this paper as "blast parameters") from the mine blast reports about each blast. The researcher matched 147 mine blasts to events recorded by a seismometer at Northview High School. Among these blasts, the researcher selected blasts that were identical in all except one blast parameter (either the number of holes blasted, maximum pounds of explosives per hole, distance between the locations of the blast and the high school, density of the material blasted, and area blasted). The researcher measured the duration, average frequency, minimum frequency, and range (referred to in this paper as "seismogram characteristics") on the seismograms of thirty selected blasts. The researcher studied the changes in each seismogram characteristic per change in each blast parameter.

USING THE LAPLACE METHOD FOR ACCURATE ORBIT DETERMINATION
Laura Elizabeth DeMare, West Bloomfield High School
West Bloomfield, Michigan USA

The Laplace Method is a way of initially determining the orbit of a celestial body. It, however, only takes into account the gravitational effect of the sun on the object, while ignoring the influences of other bodies’ gravitational forces, such as nearby planets. The purpose of this project is to determine the accuracy of the Laplace Method for initial orbital determination and to determine when using this simplified method is appropriate. <br><br> Three observations of asteroid 15 Eunomia are taken and measured against background stars. The positions and dates are inputted into a self-written orbit determination program based on the Laplace Method. The result is the calculation of the orbital elements, which are then compared to those in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s database. The calculated orbital elements are converted into ephemeris data and are compared to the actual observed positions. The resulting residuals give the accuracy of the Laplace Method. <br><br> The residuals for right ascension are all within three arcseconds and the residuals for declination are all within three arcminutes. This project suggests that the Laplace method is ideal for scientists trying to predict the location of an object in the sky for further observation. The method, however, should not be used in computations requiring accuracy beyond three arcseconds in right ascension and three arcminutes in declination.<br><br>

PHOTOMETRIC DETECTION OF AN EXTRA-SOLAR PLANETARY TRANSIT ACROSS THE SUN-LIKE STAR HD 209458
Ved Chirayath, The California Academy of Math and Science
1000 E. Victoria St. #8002, Dominguez Hills, CA, USA, 90747

I report photometric measurements of HD 209458, an extra-solar planetary system known to have an orbiting planetoid of Jupiter mass by radial velocity measurements. The star has been observed with a 10’’ Meade Schmidt-Newtonian LXD 55 telescope and a thermo-electrically cooled Nikon Coolpix 995 CCD. I detect two full transits at projected transit times defined by radial velocity measurements (Mazeh et al.). An accuracy of +/- 0.01 stellar magnitudes has been achieved using the equipment described. The photometric dimming observed, attributed to the transit of a planet across the stellar disk, is consistent with past photometric measurements made by considerably large observatories (Hubble, Keck I) and provides one of the first small aperture extra-solar planetary detections to date. The primary data analysis procedure used in the determination of stellar magnitude is differential aperture photometry. Also presented are derived values for the diameter of the extra-solar planetary disk.

HEAT OF CONDENSATION: A NATURAL SOURCE OF PROTECTIVE HEAT. A THIRD YEAR STUDY.
Shamsher Singh Samra
Clovis West High School, Fresno CA., U.S.A.

This investigation centered on the effects of utilizing heat of condensation of water from an ambient source, induced by a structural net-matrix, on growth and crop development of Raphanus sativus during frost susceptible maturation. Research objectives hoped to develop a more cost effective frost deterrent than current fossil fuel based sources of protective heat.<br><br>In conducting the investigation Raphanus sativus seeds were enclosed within overlying net matrixes with hole diameters of .1”, .5”, porous holes, and within a control group with no overlying protection. The rate of germination, percent germination, daily growth, and final masses of the individual crop were recorded. In order to correlate radish development to condensation rates, temperature readings were recorded hourly from all four media throughout the investigation, along with the relative dew point and humidity. The investigation spanned early winter to early spring.<br><br>Results showed the Raphanus sativus grown beneath the porous net matrix had the highest germination rates, growth rates, final masses, and the largest temperature gradient with respect to the ambient air temperature. There was a direct correlation between increased relative humidity and temperature gradients beneath the net matrixes. The .1”, .5”, and control group followed in all categories respectively, in correspondence to decreased surface area for water vapor nucleation.<br><br>Results suggest that net matrixes promoting ambient heat of condensation actually deter frost development and promote plant growth during cold weather stress, thus presenting an inexpensive alternative to fossil fuel dependence for frost protection. <br><br>

RELATION OF PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF SANDS TO THE WATER PRESSURE NEEDED TO PRODUCE
Jessica Lynn Otten
Notre Dame Academy, Park Hills, KY

This experiment investigated the relationship between the properties of various sands and the water pressure needed to produce quickening in them. Particles were segregated according to size using sieves with mesh sizes 44, 24, and 6. Images of sand particles were taken and the average cross-sectional area, aspect ratio, density, voids ratio, and porosity were determined. Data were recorded for the necessary pressure for samples to behave as quicksand (a previously supported 200 g weight sank) during five runs for each of three samples of sand and a sample of aquarium chips. A fixed volume of dry sand in an inverted 2-L bottle with bottom cut off was attached to a faucet and the water pressure gradually increased. A pressure sensor interfaced to a computer was used to measure the pressure when the sand went quick. Average pressures needed for the different particle sizes to quicken were all found to be statistically different (P < 0.05), and were higher for samples with larger particle sizes and larger aspect ratios. These liquefaction pressures ranged from 0.292 kPa for mesh 44 sand to 1.390 kPa for aquarium chips. The liquefaction pressure increased with increasing particle size in a nonlinear manner. The relationship between the liquefaction pressure and sand porosity was linear and expressed by: Pressure = (-24.9 kPa)Porosity + 10.6 kPa. Likewise, there was a linear relationship between liquefaction pressure and voids ratio: Pressure = (-9.43 kPa)Voids Ratio + 6.9 kPa.

CYCLIC STELLAR SPIN RATES IN CEPHEID SUPER GIANTS: CEPHEID VARIABLES PHASE IV
Bradley Bunnell
Carbon High School, Price, UT. USA

Between G and F class stars there is a sudden increase in spin rate. Because Cepheid variable stars are changing from G to F in star class, do they show a sudden increase in spin rate?<br><br> Delta Cephei, Eta Aquilae, and Zeta Geminorum were selected for this study. Images of these stars' spectra were obtained using an 8” Schmidt cassegrain telescope with a diffraction grating and a 640x480 CCD chip in a SAC-IV CCD imaging camera attached. Spectral images were processed into spreadsheets using AIP4WIN software. Spreadsheet data was converted to graphs, hydrogen lines were located, and star class was determined. An absorption line located at approximately 4670A was persistent through all of the graphs. Star class was compared to absorption line width for one complete period in each star's cycle. <br><br> All three stars show widest absorption lines when they are F class stars. This indicates that all three stars are at a maximum rotational velocity during that phase. Delta Cephei and Zeta Geminorum show thinnest absorption lines during their G class phase. This indicates a minimum rotational velocity. A spectral image for Eta Aquilae at a G class was not obtained due to atmospheric conditions. Decreasing line widths during the F-G phase and increasing line widths during G-F phase indicate that it would show similar results. Between the F and G class phases the stars show a variation in rotational velocity of approximately 1000 km/s. Cepheid variables do show an increase in rotational velocity from G to F class.<br><br>

VENUS FROM THE OUTSIDE IN: LINKING SURFACE FEATURES TO CHANGING MANTLE CONVECTION PATTERNS
Carolyn Morgan Tewksbury
Clinton Senior High School, Clinton, NY, USA

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the multitude of arcuate tessera inliers on Venus define the rims of collapsed crustal plateaus and to evaluate the use of surface features to document changes in Venusian convection patterns over time. Examination of arcuate tessera inliers on Magellan synthetic aperture radar and synthetic stereo images reveals the presence of seven previously-unrecognized collapsed and partially buried crustal plateaus on Venus in addition to the one that I identified in 2002 in the Pasom-mana region. Early ribbon tessera formation, burial of tessera by prolonged magmatism, and progressive warping of early flows and structures are consistent with collapse and nearly complete burial of irregular and, in places, overlapping crustal plateaus 1000-2000 km in diameter.<br><br> Correlation of results from my study of collapsed plateaus with mantle modeling by others suggests that surface features can provide insights into the evolution of Venusian mantle plumes. Irregular shapes and overlapping of collapsed plateaus, coupled with the more regular shapes of modern plateaus, suggest a change from non-axisymmetric to axisymmetric plumes over time during crustal plateau formation.<br><br> Recognition of eight collapsed and partially buried crustal plateaus provides a significant global clue to Venusian surface and mantle features prior to resurfacing. Venus not only looked very different than it does today but also was dominated by different processes. Crustal plateau formation was more important than previously believed, and plateau collapse was not a unique and rare event in the Venusian past. Crustal plateau formation and collapse define a phase of Venusian history that was more protracted than previously recognized. The existence of collapsed crustal plateaus requires a re-evaluation of mantle evolution models. I propose a cyclic evolution of mantle convection that takes early plateau formation and collapse into account.<br><br>

Saule Sakenova
lycee #105, Almaty, Republik of Kazakhstan

Monthly precipitations over Semipalatinsk for 1961-2002 years are investigated. A variation with a period 3.7 years are found. This period is in a close agreement with natural climate cycle known as EL Nino/Southern Oscillation(ENSO), which also vary with mean period about of 3-4 years. It is shown that for the warm ENSO-phase (El Nino) a level of precipitations over Semipalatinsk shows maximum or minimum that changes in accordance with changing of consequent quasi 22-year magnetic solar cycles.

Stephanie Rae Johnston
American Fork High School, American Fork, Utah, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to perform various studies on copper (II) sulfate crystals. The studies were divided into four categories: methods of dehydration, oven studies, vacuum studies, ESEM, and making pure crystals.<br><br>Crystals were dehydrated in a Bunsen burner, drying oven, a school vacuum, and high and low vacuum systems. The results of these dehydrations prompted further studies. <br><br>The oven studies focused on changes in the physical properties of the crystals, such as strength and dehydration rates.<br><br>The vacuum studies focused on determining the chemical composition of the green crystals.<br><br>The ESEM studies were conducted in an attempt to see the surface crystal structures of the different colors of copper (II) sulfate. <br><br>The results of x-ray analysis determined that the crystal used contained contaminates. Therefore, a procedure was developed to produce pure copper (II) sulfate crystals, which will be used to repeat previous studies.<br><br>In conclusion, my studies proved that all of the properties of copper (II) sulfate are affected by its hydration, including: crystal structure, strength, and color.<br><br>

THE SALINITY OF BOGGY BAYOU VII: A COMPARATIVE STUDY
Heather Jessie Beshore
Niceville Senior High School, Niceville, Florida, USA

The purpose of this project was to compare Boggy Bayou and Choctawhatchee Bay and determine if Boggy Bayou was an independent body of water, even though it is connected to Choctawhatchee Bay. The comparisons of the physical features and water quality parameters helped to depict the water system in the bodies of water and how they were similar and different. <br><br>Water flow at Caryville coming into Choctawhatchee Bay from Choctawhatchee River was compared to the rainfall at Niceville coming into Boggy Bayou from Turkey Creek. Also, water quality samples were taken monthly for five months with a hydrolab, a device that measures numerous parameters such as: salinity, dissolved oxygen, dissolved oxygen percent, turbidity, acidity, temperature and specific conductance. The physical features of Boggy Bayou were analyzed along with Choctawhatchee Bay and it was concluded that both bodies of water have similar physical characteristics. They are both estuaries, where salt water and fresh water mix, there is a fresh water stream at the head end and an influx of salt water at the mouth that is also a narrow channel. Since the physical characteristics are very similar so are the water quality parameters.<br><br>The water quality parameters are also helpful in predicting the adaptability of certain marine life species within Boggy Bayou and Choctawhatchee Bay. The two esturaries are similar in function but different in their domination of stream flow due to location and size of the watershed. The results of the rainfall and water flow data are helpful in showing the time frame of the impact of the water coming in from the head end and how they affect the water quality, mostly salinity.<br><br>

AN ASSESSMENT OF LINEAR AND ACCELERATED MOTION IN DOUBLE STARS
Sabrina Curie Snell
School Without Walls SHS, Washington, DC, USA

The purpose of this project was to assess the reliability and accuracy of proper motions recorded in the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogs using an independent source of data, and the degree to which unmodeled accelerations affect the data in such catalogs. This analysis demonstrated that the relative proper motions (B–A) for three groups of double stars computed from data contained in the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 Catalogues were often inconsistent with those computed for the same group of stars in the Washington Double Star Catalog (WDS), the accepted standard. It further demonstrated that, in this respect, Tycho-2 was more reliable than Hipparcos, as the relative proper motions computed varied less from WDS. It measured the external errors of the three catalogs (using a sample of 506 double systems with essentially linear motion) and compared them with the internal errors given by Hipparcos and Tycho-2 and computed for WDS. It also computed acceleration solutions for 43 systems exhibiting significant curvature in their proper motions (suggesting the presence of binary systems), evaluated differences between their linear and acceleration solutions, and computed order-of-magnitude estimates of their total masses. This project produced a technique new to the astronomical community: the use of double stars as calibration objects for star catalogs. A second astrometric technique, utilized in the acceleration survey, theoretically could be employed to evaluate stellar systems for the possible presence of celestial companions, including brown dwarfs and extrasolar planets.

GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE AND ANTARCTICA
Nicole Marie Hanney
St. Joseph's Academy Baton Rouge, Louisiana USA

The unique environment in Antarctica has a dynamic relationship with global climate change and provides opportunities for scientific research and data collection. Through analysis of historical and current Antarctic data concentrating on the long term buildup of atmospheric constituents and its influence on climate changes, this project investigated the implications for future global climate change by analyzing data collected from the Antarctic region, specifically the Vostok Ice Core. <br><br> In this analysis, data from the Vostok Ice Core were tabled and graphed to find a correlation between the depleting ozone gases, like methane and carbon dioxide, and temperature variations with isotopic gases. Linear regression analysis was then used to determine past trends, future predicted outcomes of temperatures affecting global climate change, and significance of correlations. <br><br> Graphing these temperature levels and amounts of ozone depleting gases, over time depicts that the highest temperatures and gas concentrations reached their peak in five distinct time periods or glacial cycles with slight variations ending in the same conclusion. This shows that because of increasing levels of greenhouse gases of methane and carbon dioxide more sunlight is absorbed increasing temperature levels. A correlation was also determined between temperature and greenhouse gases showing an increase over time. Because of research about global climate change, society can now be more aware of the impact of allowing harmful gases to be released into the atmosphere. The researcher thanks her mentor Dr. Philip Bart, LSU Antarctic researcher.<br><br>

FORMATION OF AN INTERSTELLAR DUST ANALOG
John B. Retan
Jefferson County International Baccalaureate High School, Birmingham, Alabama

This experiment is intended to explore the process through which interstellar dust is formed. It is possible to gather information about the universe from the Earth and compare it to information gathered in a laboratory setting. In this manner, conclusions can be drawn concerning the processes that are taking place throughout the universe.<br><br> The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) naphthalene, when subjected to the energetic environment of a hydrogen plasma, is transformed into a material that exhibits an infrared (IR) absorption profile in the 3 nanometer region that is very similar to the IR absorption spectrum from the protoplanetary nebula IRAS 05341 + 0852 in the same wavelength region.<br><br> The reaction between the PAH and the hydrogen plasma models the events that are taking place around the nebula and suggests that atoms condensing into PAH species from the stellar wind issuing from such objects could also be going through a similar process for the formation of interstellar dust.<br><br>Although the spectrums of the nebula and the sample are similar, it would be nearly impossible to replicate an environment having all the same variables as the actual nebula. Therefore it would also be nearly impossible to create an exact copy of the IR spectrum in a laboratory setting; however, by using naphthalene which is one of the simplest PAHs and therefore one of the most abundant and using hydrogen which is the most abundant element in the universe, a close IR spectrum match is expected.<br><br>

ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS ON BINARY STARS IN A LIGHT POLLUTED AREA
Christian Andres Soto
McArthur High School, Hollywood, Florida, USA

Is it possible that the observatory where I did this project is affected by light pollution? This study will compare 15 binary stars (14 visual and 1 eclipsing) to historical data to see if light pollution has an effect. For the visual binary stars, position angle and separation were recorded. Right ascension and declination, spectral type and magnitude were taken into consideration. When possible, the combined mass was calculated using Kepler's third law. Also new data concerning the star's orbit was contributed. All hypotheses for these double stars were rejected because there was no significant difference in relation to historical data. Thereby, showing that light pollution has no effect. With this as a reference point, the eclipsing binary system's magnitude was determined with over a thousand images of the star using three different filters. The observatory's telescope operator used a camera and a special computer program to accomplish this. Then I analyzed the resulting light curves. The infrared filter gives more information on the star such as magnitude, and the computer program reinforced the information obtained. The control was an analysis on the same star, QX And., from 1995. There was a 0.01% change in the period of the star in seven years. Since the effect of light pollution can be discounted due to the first experiment, and due to the nature of this compact star, the change in period is significant. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to monitor the period over the next seven years.

DIDACTIC UBV PHOTOMETRY
Armando Mudrik
Science club "Dr Francisco De Pedro", San Cristobal , Santa Fe , Argentina

The development of photography meant a step forward for astronomy. Nowadays, there are myriads of highly sophisticated devices for detecting and recording the brightness of stars. <br><br> The challenge that I faced in this task was to design a device to detect and record the brightness of stars and then to obtain some information about them. Therefore, I needed to get a number of filters to suit the UBV system, which had to be affordable and be low in price.<br><br> For the design, I made use of a camera, a number of filters, developed equipment, positivado equipment and a free software. A series of experiments were carried out for checking the high quality of the materials used for the device. Those included to determine the limit of magnitude of the photographs and also to determine the filter transmission curves.<br><br> The results in the photometry allowed me to have an average of the star temperatures, based on the standard magnitudes. A painstaking analysis of the errors that can alter the values taken from the photometry showed those are 0.4 magnitudes. With the instrumental magnitudes, I draw a colour-colour diagram, this showed the characteristics of the group of stars that were being studied.<br><br> The aim of this paper is to show that there are possibilities to carry out photometric experiments using non-complex equipment, which allows teachers to perform those in the classroom to foster the learning process and to make students get involved in subjects suck as Astronomy, Physics, Chemistry and Maths.<br><br>

OPTIMIZATION OF SATELLITE ORBITS FOR MAXIMUM TIME IN THE MAGNETOSPHERE
Sarah Woodring Bates
Eleanor Roosevelt High School, Greenbelt MD, USA

This project proposed to maximize time in the magnetosphere’s plasma sheet for a constellation mission of approximately fifty satellite orbits by manipulating each orbit’s inclination and argument of perigee. An algorithm, which incorporated both a stepping and radial search technique, was developed to navigate the unknown function of time in the magnetosphere versus inclination and argument of perigee. This algorithm was then coded into a programming platform already containing a magnetospheric model. Two types of data were collected for each satellite orbit. The first was an approximation of the location of the maximum and the second was a graphical representation of all coordinates tested, where a point (x,y,z) was used to represent an inclination, argument of perigee, and the resultant total time in the magnetosphere, for a 180 day propagation. This graph was used to both verify the program and hold other critical aspects of the function’s geometry such as sub-optimum peaks. The average argument of perigee producing the maximum time in the magnetosphere was 86.7 degrees whereas the optimum inclination appeared to be sensitive to apogee height of the individual satellite orbits. The individual locations of maxima were then compiled in order to make a second optimization or recommendation for the entire constellation mission. A recommendation of shifting the actual implementation of the individual optimizations toward those satellites which possessed higher maximum times was made. As the method for which the satellites would be put into orbit favors launching satellites into similar orbits, it was recommended that for the other orbits sub-optimum coordinates be used in an attempt to improve other aspects of the mission such as cost.

A TERRESTRIAL DETERMINATION
Joshua Marcus Vukelich
Stevens High School, Rapid City, South Dakota, USA

The purpose of this project was to determine the slope of the magnitude for the supernova sn2003. It was hypothesized that the magnitude of the supernova sn2003B could be predicted over a given period of time. To complete this project the telescope at Badlands Observatory, located in Quinn, South Dakota, was used to take four different pictures from which the slope was found. The magnitudes of sn2003B were found. In order to find the magnitude of the super nova, pictures were taken of the star, which were then compared with other stars in the area, to determine sn2003B’s magnitude. Using this calculation it was possible to predict the magnitude of the supernova over a given period of time. In one case the magnitude of sn2003B actually increased which was found to be a paradox. To solve this problem research was done and a percent error of slope declination was found, thus enabling an explanation for the rise in magnitude. The conclusions that were drawn in this experiment were found to be similar to the hypothesis. It was concluded that it is possible to find the percent efficiency, which was 97.6%, in predicting the magnitude slope of sn2003B. The final magnitude slope of sn2003B was found to be .05183/1. Thus it was found that it is possible to find the linear slope of a super nova.

INVESTIGATIONS INTO STAR FORMATION IN HIGH-VELOCITY CLOUDS
Mubdi Rahman
Martingrove Collegiate Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada

The objective of this research is to determine whether star formation occurs within high-velocity clouds (HVC). HVCs are subject to ram pressure due to the ambient halo gas, and this has been determined to slow HVCs with low column densities to a terminal velocity while high column density clouds are not significantly affected. I have simulated hypothetical HVCs travelling from rest using the Benjamin and Danly model of HVC infall and have found that the separation between clouds of different column densities may be as great as 3 kiloparsecs. I propose that the dense cores of HVCs are ejected from the envelope in which they have been seen to exist. The ejected core is then subject to gravitational instabilities and given a sufficient density, will collapse to form a star.<br><br>I have examined the proposed mechanism using current observations of HVCs to ensure its possibility. I investigate gas processes within HVCs, especially the Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, to ensure that the ejection mechanism is feasible and the core structure will exist as it is ejected from the envelope. I have also compared gas pressures within these clouds to determine a column density at which gravitation instabilities will be the decisive factor in the equilibrium of the core. Through this analysis, I have shown that the proposed mechanism of star formation is possible and is consistent with all current observations. I am currently analysing my mechanism with a larger set of HVCs and intend to simulate the hydrodynamic processes of the mechanism. <br><br>

DEVELOPMENT OF AN ADAPTIVELY CONTROLLED TELESCOPE WITH STAR-PATTERN RECOGNITION POINTING
Jonathan Nicholas Sick
Queen Elizabeth High School, Calgary, Alberta, Canada

This project describes the development of a 32-cm f/5 Newtonian telescope designed for use by amateur astronomers in producing scientifically useful observations through high-accuracy computer control. The telescope is designed to achieve a 10-arcsecond pointing accuracy through the use of a star-pattern recognition algorithm that is modified with an empirical image appearance prediction system, which adds photometric measurements to the star-pattern recognition. This allows the effects of unresolvable clusters of stars, and the presence of non-stellar objects to be included in the star-pattern recognition process through the prediction of an object's pixel brightness and point spread function. To calibrate this system, a software package was written that automates the process of identifying and measuring star parameters in an image through astrometrically driven star identification. Testing with pointing camera images has shown that star appearance on a CCD can be predicted with high accuracy. The telescope hardware features a unique fiberglass and metal composite construction technique for precision component placement. An innovative placement of the autoguiding camera at the Newtonian prime focus through an on-axis tracking platform is also featured. The telescope is controlled with real-time software, on a laptop computer, using modified Firewire video cameras to provide pointing and tracking data. To test the accuracy of the control algorithms and simulate the effects of errors from environmental and mechanical sources, a software application was written. Results from this and other tests have shown that this telescope can operate within the preset pointing and tracking objectives necessary for scientific utilization.<br><br>

DETERMINING THE QUANTITATIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ECLIPSING BINARY STAR SYSTEM V508 OPHIUCHUS THROUGH OBSERVATIONAL ASTROMETRY.
Alan Nathan Calfee
Folsom High School, Folsom CA, USA

This project in its present form is the complete quantitative analysis of the eclipsing binary star system V508 Ophiuchus. The characteristics of the system were determined by means of observational astrometry, including the processes of spectroscopy, differential photometry, celestial mechanics, and comparative analysis. <br><br>Using spectroscopy, the tangential velocities were determined by the Doppler shift in the Hydrogen emission lines of the individual stars. The tangential velocity of the primary star is 119 km/s and of the secondary star is 229 km/s. <br><br>Differential photometry is the precise measurement of the brightness of celestial objects relative to comparison and check objects. This technique was used to create a light curve, a plot of the stars intrinsic luminosity versus time, of which the orbital period of the system is the period of the light curve, 1.0082 x 10-3 years. <br><br>The laws of celestial mechanics and the comparison of these individual stars to similar stars in the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram were used to determine the quantitative characteristics of both the individual stars and of the total system. <br><br>Binary stars are useful to astronomers in that their mass can be directly determined, the intrinsic luminosity calculated, and the distance from the earth estimated. Knowledge of the distance to the system allows astronomers to estimate the distance to other stars in its vicinity. The study of binary stars has been essential to the development of stellar evolution theory.

ANNUAL MODULATION OF EARTHQUAKES IN YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK AND THEIR RELATION TO ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE AND SNOW LOAD
Adam Orion Flaxman
Massapequa High School, Massapequa, New York, 11758, United States

The Yellowstone caldera is a dynamic feature that experiences very high heat flow, frequent seismicity, and dramatic crustal deformation. The high degree of seismic activity and unique geology of the Yellowstone National Park shows annual modulations. This research takes a novel approach by studying this unique region to investigate a possible relationship between atmospheric pressure variations and seismic events, following Gao et al., (2000), who suggested barometric pressure variations as the cause of annual modulations of the Coulomb stress for small seismic events. A spectral analysis is performed to process and analyze earthquake data for the Yellowstone National Park region. A time series consisting of the total number of earthquakes per day between Jan 1, 1973 and December 31, 1999 was obtained from the University of Utah Seismograph Stations database. Results of the power spectral estimate of the earthquake frequency and moment time series, tested against white and red noise reveals statistically significant signals at 12 months with 99% confidence. These annual and seasonal modulations in seismicity and their relations to barometric pressure variations, and snow load we discuss.

ANALYSIS OF A BLOWOUT IN GALAXY NGC 3628 USING INFRARED POLARIZATION
Megan Elizabeth Teckman
Breck School, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA

The question addressed in this project was whether a blowout exists in NGC 3628, a spiral galaxy in the Leo Triplet. Radio and x-ray emissions indicate starbursts are occurring in the nucleus of this galaxy, which is being disturbed and warped by its two neighboring galaxies. As a result, there are significant amounts of radio waves and x-rays being emitted, which prompted this study to look for a blowout caused by massive star formation.<br><br>The goal of this project was to ratify the existence of a blowout by mapping the magnetic field in NGC 3628 using polarized infrared images. It was possible to map the magnetic field geometry of this galaxy using polarization, because the net polarization of infrared radiation aligns with the magnetic field of the galaxy. The images were adjusted and prepared using astronomy software IRAF before being analyzed using Axum software.<br><br>The telescope used in this project imaged in near-infrared (1.65 microns = 1,650 nanometers)because dust in front of the galaxy blocks light at visible wavelengths. Far-infrared is not absorbed by dust in the galaxy.<br><br>While nothing in the adjusted images alone indicated a blowout, results from the magnetic field overlay suggest that a blowout does exist in NGC 3628. The magnetic field at the site of the blowout is clearly skewed perpendicularly to the magnetic field of the galaxy.<br><br>The practical applications of this project not only expanded knowledge of blowouts in galaxies but illustrated the effectiveness of using polarized infrared astronomy for such analyses.

THE WAVE MACHINE: AN ASSAY DETERMINING HOW BOTTOM COMPOSITION AND CONTOUR AFFECT WAVE HEIGHT AND WAVE PERIOD AND ITS CORRELATION TO BEACH EROSION
Joshua William Schadow, Brady Robert Bigalke
Edgewater High School, Orlando, Florida, United States of America

There are no two waves that are exactly comparable. Waves consist of many elements and have been examined by Marine Scientists and Geophysists. Our investigations tested which ocean bottom compositions and ocean bottom contours would create the least benign wave for coastal shorelines. This information will be used to make correlations to effects of the waves that are created to beach erosion.<br><br> <br><br> An 8-foot x 2-foot x 1-foot tank was constructed out of plexi glass, steel, and wood. The reservoir was constructed from the same materials and also included a plastic sink and cement. The reservoir was 2-feet x 2-feet x 1 1/2 –feet. After it was built, we sealed and filled it with water. The reservoir was used to create waves by releasing the water and then letting the water accelerate through opening in the reservoir. When first tested a wave was created with success and experimentations began.<br><br> The diverse bottom compositions tested; included sand, debris and rocks. After 30 trials of experimentation with different compositions, the results concluded debris created the largest wave with an average of 5.7”. It is believed that the debris created the largest wave because debris had the densest materials when compared with rocks and sand.<br><br> The bottom contours tested included different sandbar locations and a beach. After 40 trials in the tank using different contours, the largest wave was created with the sandbar placed towards the front of the tank at a height of 4.65”.<br><br> <br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF INCREASED ATMOSPHERIC TEMPERATURES ON GLACIERS
Charles Nicholas Giberti, William Buckner
Mosley High school , Panama City , Fl. , United States.

What thermal pattern will occur in the air and in the water as a glacier is melting under different temperatures?<br><br> A classroom was chosen where a controlled environment could be maintained. A replica of a real glacier was made with an ice shaving machine by shaving blocks of ice into bread pans. Only a fraction of the pan was filled at one time and the fresh snow was compacted with a large block of ice. After this the pans were set in a freezer to further fuse together. Then, at varying amounts of time, more ice was shaved and the process was repeated. This went on until all glaciers met a set mass. <br><br> Then, the researchers set up two aquariums in which the glaciers were to be melted. They wired six temperature probes into the upper, lower, and middle water or air region of each tank. Each tank was then filled with six gallons of sea-water solution. The second tank, however, had an infrared light suspended above it. This raised the atmospheric temperature by about 3-5 degrees, which is about how hot scientists fear global warming will raise the average global temperature in a few years. <br><br> Some results have been collected thus far, but more experimentation is necessary and will be continued. <br><br>

ANALYSIS OF SEDIMENTS' CEMENTATION AND LITHIFICATION PATTERNS AS POSSIBLE CAUSES OF THE INCREASE OF RHIZOPHORA MANGLE LENGTH GROWTH IN ZONA BLANCA, PUERTO RICO.
Michelle Martinez - Rivera, Jeanette Sánchez - Jiménez
Colegio San Vicente de Paúl, San Juan, Puerto Rico

In most places on the surface, igneous rocks are covered by a thin veneer of loose sediment, and the rock which is made as layers of this debris gets compacted together to form soil and sedimentary rocks under procedures called cementation and lithification. Sedimentary rocks are called secondary, because they are often the result of the accumulation of small pieces broken off pre-existing rocks. A Rhizophora mangle in Zona Blanca, Luquillo presents evident soil formation patterns that are causing an increase on its side length growth. This is why this research intends to analyze the cementation and lithification patterns of the soil as possible cause of the increase on the Rhizophora mangle length growth.<br><br> Several mangroves were selected to see if length changes were observed in any of them. The selected mangrove was Zona Blanca, located in the North area of Puerto Rico, since it was the one that showed the largest increase on length growth. The mangrove was divided into ten sites and visited on nine consecutive weekends. On each visit, the mangrove was measured three times and on each site, soil's temperature, salinity, turbidity, pH, profundity, and light exposure measures were taken. Observations were made on soil's color, texture and minerals.<br><br> After completing this research, results showed that cementation and lithification processes of the Rhizophora mangle soil were deposited as lateral alluvial fan patterns causing the mangrove to have an increase on side length growth and not bottom precipitation like it normally occurs in water bodies.

ESR (ELECTRON SPIN RESONANCE) DATING AT TREUGOL'NAYA CAVE: AGES FOR PALEOLITHIC INDUSTRIES IN OXYGEN ISOTOPE STAGE 11
Sisi Liang, Yingqiuqi Lei
Robert F. Kennedy High School, Flushing, New York, United States

At 1510 m elevation, Treugol'naya Cave, Russia, is the highest cave showing evidence for human occupation in Eastern Europe. Along with abundant faunal remains, including the extinct Middle Pleistocene species, Equus altidens, Ursus deningeri, and Canis mosbachensis, Layers 4-7 in the 4.5-m-thick sequence yielded numerous choppers, sidescrapers, endscrapers, and protobifaces, representing Lower Paleolithic pebble and flake tool industries.<br><br> Electron spin resonance (ESR) can date tooth enamel from 10 ka to 5 Ma in age. To determine absolute ages for Treugol’naya, seven ungulate teeth collected from the Lower Paleolithic layers were dated by standard and isochron ESR analyses. Individual volumetrically averaged external dose rates were determined for each tooth using radioactive element concentrations measured for 78 sediment samples. Isochron analyses indicate that the teeth experienced no significant U leaching or secondary uptake, and that linear uptake provides accurate ages. Assumptions about Rn loss and sedimentary water concentration do not significantly affect the LU ages. Layer 4Á dated to 386 ± 17 ka, while Layer 4B averaged 375 ± 8 ka. One tooth from Layer 5Á dated to 315 ± 10 ka, but was probably reworked from a higher layer. Therefore, ESR, paleomagnetic, palynological and paleontological analyses all indicate that the Lower Paleolithic Layers 4-5 correlate with Oxygen Isotope Stages (OIS) 9 to 11. The deposit's thickness and the dates' precision make this site suitable as the OIS 11 type site for terrestrial deposits, but more dates and sedimentary analyses are necessary to date and check for reworked teeth in Layer 7. <br><br>

TWINS IN SPACE: ORBITAL CHARACTERISTICS OF CLOSE BINARY STARS
Kimberly Eilene Bunnell, Christopher Henrie
Mont Harmon Jr. High, Price, UT. USA

Binary stars are two stars that orbit one another. Many binary stars are so far away and so close together that we see them as a single star. Our project is to determine the relationship or orbital characteristics of two sets of binary stars by analyzing spectral images over a period of 56 days.<br><br>The binary star systems chosen for study are Mizar A and Algol. Mizar A consists of two class A stars and Algol consists of a small bright class B star and a larger but dimmer class G star. Doppler shift in spectral absorption lines caused by one Mizar A partner moving away from us and the other moving toward us, creates absorption line width variation as the partners orbit one another. When the stars are side by side, absorption lines widen and when they are parallel our line of sight, the lines are narrower. Line width analysis through the study period indicate Mizar A has a orbital period of about 20 days. Because Algol consists of two different stars and the dimmer class G partner eclipses the brighter class B star approximately every three days, spectral analysis shows a greater number of absorption lines whenever the class G star blocks the light from the class B star. Because the brighter class B partner has fewer absorption lines we see class B characteristics the rest of the time.<br><br>Spectral analysis of close binary stars provides important information about orbital characteristics of binary or twin stars.<br><br>

EFFECT OF SIMULATED MICROGRAVITY ON SEED GERMINATION AND AMYLASE CONTENT OF GLYCINE MAX
Emily Christine Stover, Kathleen Elizabeth Albers
Notre Dame Academy Park Hills,KY USA

Microgravity is a condition in which objects do not experience the full force of gravity, and therefore are under different influences than they normally experience on Earth. By growing plants such as Glycine max (soybeans) in microgravity, the feasibility of a long-term food and oxygen source in space is investigated.<br><br>The purpose of this experiment was to build a bioreactor to simulate a microgravity environment for soybeans. Their germination pattern and amylase content were compared to those of soybeans placed in normal Earth conditions. The bioreactor was run for 15 to 25 days. Mass and radicle length were measured daily. Later, gel electrophoresis was performed to compare amylase content and function in beans subject to different conditions, and amylase function was also tested in a starch-agarose gel. A germination control group in a culture dish showed 95% germination, grew normally and displayed active alpha amylase. Forty percent of seeds in the bioreactor germinated and grew to 1 cm radicle length. No seeds in the bioreactor control germinated. Electrophoresis and starch-agarose experiments showed the presence of functional amylase in both the bioreactor and bioreactor control seeds.

THE EFFECTS OF VARYING MINE TAILING AND SAND RATIOS ON THE STRUCTURAL STRENGTH OF CONCRETE
Laura C Wysner, Denver L Smith
Hamilton High School, Chandler, AZ, USA

The pollution of the environment due to mine tailings—the hazardous waste product that results from the extraction of an ore from the earth—has become an increasingly important issue over the years, especially as knowledge regarding the high acidity of mine tailings became available. Therefore, sizeable funds are spent treating mine tailings each year and a feasible solution has yet to be discovered for the storage of mine tailings. This project explores the practicality of mine tailing usage in conjunction with sand as the fine aggregate in a general-purpose concrete mixture with the use of mine tailings to sand ratios. Five batches, each containing sixteen samples, will be made to test the varying ratios. This experiment will contain one control batch, having a 0:100 mine tailings to sand ratio and four experimental batches, containing 25:75, 50:50, 75:25, and 100:0 mine tailings to sand ratios respectively. Experimentation supported our hypothesis that varying mine tailings and sand ratios in concrete are an effective solution for the storage of mine tailings, and concrete containing a 75% mine tailings and 25% sand mixture provides greater strength than a control group—containing 0% mine tailings and 100% sand—when compression tested for strength. This is evident by an increase of greater than 15% between the control group and the aforementioned experimental ratio. Therefore mine tailings are not only efficiently stored in concrete but also increase the strength of concrete.

TRANSIT ECLIPSE METHOD: DETECTING AN EXTRA SOLAR PLANET AROUND HD209458
Jenna Bianca Dionisio
Kalaheo High, Kailua and Hawaii, United States

Abstract <br><br> This project was intended to prove that can amateur can find evidence for a planet orbiting a star outside of our solar system using the Transit Eclipse method. This method includes calculating the light curve of a star. This project used star HD209458 for observation through a remote observatory. A request was sent to Lowell Observatory in Arizona after determining when the transit would occur and where the star was best observable using Starry Night Pro. The images of the star were received as FITS files and analyzed by a computer program called Mira. A light curve was calculated from this data and a scatter plot was used to show the light curve using Microsoft Excel.<br><br> The outcome of the experiment appeared to disprove the hypothesis with the first attempt at calculating the light curve of HD209458. An expert was consulted and a new method of calculation was derived. A new light curve was evident on the new graph which showed similarities when compared to a scientist’s light curve of the same star using the Transit Eclipse method. Ultimately what this experiment explored was the discovery of the dimming of the brightness of HD209458 therefore showing that an object was passing in front, or transiting. With this success, other stars could be analyzed this way to determine if a planet is orbiting them as well. This will be the next step in this project; comparing the light curve of HD209458 during a transit to the new star’s light curve.<br><br>

PETROLOGY, MORPHOLOGY, AND GEOCHEMISTRY OF THE SOUTHERN JUAN DE FUCA RIDGE: EVIDENCE FOR OFF-AXIS VOLCANISM
Sarah Rose Langberg
Canterbury School, Fort Myers, Florida, USA

Recent expeditions have displayed extreme diversity among lava flows covering the seafloor inconsistent with predicted uniform eruptions at the Mid-Ocean Ridge axis. A temporal and spatial correlation among seafloor samples explanatory of physical and chemical variability was sought. It is hypothesized that off-axis magmatic and volcanic processes contribute to the heterogeneity in petrology, morphology, and geochemistry of the Earth's crust at the seafloor. <br><br>Samples were collected by Dr. M. Perfit (University of Florida) during dives traversing the Cleft segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge via remotely operated vehicles. Dive videos provided views of varied seafloor morphology. This researcher performed X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, which yielded trace elemental abundance data on a ppm scale. All samples were chemically proven to have originated from the same magma chamber. Cogenetic lavas sampled from the cross-axis traverses displayed no discernable pattern of variation with respect to axial distance. The chemical variability of the rocks is explained by magmatic evolution and fractional crystallization (up to 80% as calculated in the Rayleigh Fractionation equation). When collected chemical data and calculations pertaining to fractionation and elemental abundances were compared with projected data from the Petrolog simulation program, results varied by no more than 0.8 ppm. The data strongly supports extreme fractionation, allowed to progress to measured levels via off-axis pathways. The distribution of lava compositions and fractionation suggests that more chemically evolved samples erupted in off-axis locations. Chemical data coupled with physical morphologic heterogeneity among the samples support a radiating dike hypothesis and the proposed geologic association. <br><br>

YEAR III: NATURALLY-OCCURRING IRON PIPES - CAN THEY AFFECT OUR ENVIRONMENT
Margaret Leigh Sinrod
Pensacola High School, Pensacola, Florida

In continuing the study of naturally-occurring iron pipes, commonly known as iron concretions, and their role as conduits for toxins into the aquifer, the logical next step was to study their formation. In order to understand this natural phenomenon, it was necessary to examine ground water samples, which were drawn from the aquifer of Escambia County, Florida. <br><br> This year, in studying the geochemical processes involved in the formation of these pipes and water testing of local monitoring wells it was found that the chemical processes and a geochemical disequilibrium could lead to unsafe levels of iron concentration. This is due to the relationship between pH, Eh, redox, Fe content, and turbidity levels in the soil and water. The data compiled from groundwater testing shows that the iron concentrations found at many sites exceeded the secondary drinking water standard and therefore are violations of water quality standards. <br><br> In regard to general health, these findings have clear applications for the public wellbeing. In addition, if it can be proven that the geochemical disequilibrium is a naturally occurring phenomenon, then perhaps measures can be taken to correct it and protect the environment and the public health of our citizens. <br><br>

THE CONNECTION BETWEEN SOLAR VARIABILITY AND ANNULAR MODES
Thomas Franklin Christian III
Houston County High School, Warner Robins Georgia, United States

Annular modes are huge manifestations of climate variability. One component of the Northern Hemisphere Annular Mode (NAM) is the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). This oscillation is the primary mode of winter weather variability in the North Atlantic region. It is measured by calculating the differences in sea-level pressure (SLP) between the Azores (Portugal) and Iceland. The NAO affects Northern Europe, Iceland, Greenland, Canada, Northern Asia, and the eastern coast of the United States. This project will try to find a connection between solar variability and the stratosphere, using the 10.7cm solar flux and various stratospheric conditions. Finding this connection would allow better winter weather predictions in the Northern Hemisphere, specifically the North Atlantic region. The NAO exists within the troposphere. A coupling is known to exist between the stratosphere and the troposphere. If a connection can be formed between solar activity and the stratosphere, then an indirect connection to the troposphere has been formed. Data from various websites have been used. Twelve linear correlations in atmospheric seasonal/monthly averages were created. The maps of sea level pressure and air temperature indicate that there is a change in the North/South temperature gradient between tropical and extratropical regions. This change is linked to an increase in the stratospheric jet at subtropical latitudes within the regions of strengthened temperature gradient. The result is consistent with enhanced heating due to the absorption of ultraviolet radiation by ozone.

TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY INVESTIGATIONS OF TRIGGERED-LIGHTNING OXIDE FULGURITES
Britta Elyse Jones
Eastside High School, Gainesville, FL USA

Oxide reduction during lightning-induced fulgurite formation has been previously observed and a number of mechanisms have been suggested. Last year, lightning-induced fulgurites were formed in 99.9% pure binary oxides of manganese (MnO) and nickel (NiO) in order to study oxide reduction mechanisms. This year, electrical measurements and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) investigations were used to further analyze the microstructure and composition of the fulgurites. According to these electrical measurements, the MnO fulgurite was insulating; however, the NiO fulgurite was highly conductive. A focused ion beam system was used to prepare cross-sectional TEM samples of each fulgurite. TEM images showed that the MnO fulgurite consists of a single highly-defective phase. Selected area diffraction patterns were taken on the TEM and the interplanar spacings analyzed to determine the phases present. Selected area diffraction patterns indicate the MnO fulgurite is 100% MnO; conversely, the NiO fulgurite was found to have been reduced according to TEM images. The images showed the formation of a two-phase mixture and selected area diffraction pattern results from the TEM illustrate the presence of nearly equal amounts of Ni and NiO. These results explain the origin of the high conductivity and further substantiate the observation that oxide reduction during fulgurite formation can occur, and that this oxide reduction is much greater than previously supposed.

EFFECTS OF MODIFICATION OF THE GRAVITATIONAL INVERSE SQUARE LAW ON THE STABILITY OF A SOLAR SYSTEM.
David Isidor Widerhorn
Dunbar High School for Science & Engineering Professions, Fort Worth, TX, USA

Our universe is based on several fundamental forces: the electromagnetic force, the gravitational force, the weak nuclear force and the strong nuclear force. It is possible that multiple universes could exist as indicated by previous research. By analyzing the stability of a planet orbiting in a solar system under different gravitational force laws, conclusions can be drawn regarding the stability of such a system and the universe of which it would be part.<br><br> A computer simulation was written in order to describe a planet orbiting around a massive primary star (such as the sun). Newton’s Law of Gravitational Force was modified to equal F=(G*M1*M2)/(R^C). In order to calculate the acceleration and the velocity of the planet at any time, Euler’s Method was used. The Lyapunov Exponent was calculated in order to quantify the chaos in each solar system. C-values of -5.0,0.0,0.5,1.0,1.5,2.0,2.5,3.0 and 4.0 were tested in the simulation.<br><br> The orbital paths and Lyapunov Exponents were examined graphically. Systems with a C-value of 3 or greater were unbound (planets orbit spirally and then drift away) and systems with a C value 2.5 or smaller were bound. All bound systems were found to be increasingly stable as the C-value decreased with the exception of the isolated case of C=1.0 which was fully unstable. However, all unbound systems were found to be unstable with instability increasing as the C-value was increased.<br><br> Because certain C-values proved to be stable, it is possible that multiple universes with gravitational force laws following these C-values could exist.

SPACE WEATHER MONITORING WITH THE GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS): CAN INTERFERENCE WITH GPS BE USED TO IDENTIFY GLOBAL AND LOCAL VARIATIONS IN THE STATE OF THE IONOSPHERE?
Bogna Natalia Brzezinska
Upper Arlington High School, Upper Arlington, Ohio, USA

The objective of this project is to study the ability of the Global Positioning System (GPS) to monitor space weather, especially to detect and map local disturbances in the ionosphere. The Earth’s magnetic field is subject to space weather conditions that can manifest themselves as ionospheric storms, causing power or satellite outages. Knowledge of the level of ionospheric activity contributes to radionavigation and communication systems, as they are strongly affected by ionospheric storms and disturbances both locally and globally. Thus, the ionosphere must be constantly monitored to provide reliable forecasting of space weather, which would allow communication operators, power plants, airlines, etc., to take precautionary measures. <br><br> While traditional ionospheric tracking may not provide sufficient spatial and temporal resolutions to study local disturbances, local permanent ground-based GPS networks of tracking stations can measure the Total Electron Content (TEC) at thousands of ionospheric pierce points daily, by measuring the amount of ionospheric delay of the GPS signal. The TEC directly reflects the state of ionospheric activity. <br><br> The test area for this project was the State of Ohio Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS), with an average station spacing of 100km. The Alternative Hypothesis was accepted; ionospheric interference with GPS can be used to help monitor space weather, especially the state of the ionosphere on a regional scale. The CORS can provide accurate information about the level of TEC in the ionosphere, enabling better forecasting and precautionary measures to be taken against severe ionospheric activity. <br><br>

ELECTRODYAMIC SHIELD TO HINDER MARS DUST DEPOSITION ON SOLAR PANELS
Rachel Marie Harpool
Little Rock Central High School, Little Rock AR, United States

During future Mars explorations, a major challenge will be faced regarding the deposition of dust on the surface of solar panels and life support equipment. To hinder the dust accumulation on the photovoltaic panels, an electrodynamic screen was designed, built and tested. The screen consists of parallel electrodes energized by an AC signal and placed on top of the solar panel. The effect of the signal characteristics (amplitude, frequency and shape) on the cleaning efficiency of the shield was investigated. It was discovered that the greatest quantity of dust was removed when the shield was operated at high voltages (6 to 8 kV), a frequency between 10 and 50 Hz, for a sinusoidal signal. This same technology can be applied also to various other applications like to remove the dust from the shields of the helicopters, or keep the walls of different installations free from particulate deposition.<br><br>

SUGGESTED TRANSPORT MECHANISMS OF LARGE ERRATICS ALONG THE WESTERN FLANK OF THE BIGHORN MOUNTAINS, WY
Casey Albert Lipp
Greybull High School, Greybull Wyoming, United States 

A geomorphic phenomenon occurs along the western flank of the Bighorn Mountains. Throughout this arid plateau large granite and carbonate erratics are found at great distances from their origin with no conventional mechanisms of transport evident. An erratic is defined as a large boulder that has been transported. In this study special attention was given to granite erratics. Granites, as opposed to carbonates, have fewer source exposures in the Bighorn Mountains; thus giving them value as markers to distinguish and track separate geomorphological events. This project focuses on the relationships between the erratics, terraces, terrace compositions, and the location of granite exposures in the Bighorn Mountains in order to make conclusions on possible transport mechanisms. The hypothesis is that the transport of these erratics was due to a catastrophic event that involved tremendous amounts of water and soft soils. The terraces containing erratics were located and followed to identify the origin. The terraces in the region were mapped and clast counts performed to identify the exsisting terraces in the study area. In order to determine density; in terms of numbers of boulders in a certain area, transit counts were conducted in randomly selected areas. Research was conducted on the geology of the Bighorn Mountains and the different types of transport mechanisms of large erratics. Through the fieldwork and the research it was concluded that the erratics were moved by a number of contributors including bedding plane collapse, mass wasting of pediment surfaces, re-working of features by high discharge runoff cycles. However, analysis would indicate that mudflows had the greatest influence in the transport of these large erratics along the Bighorn Mountains western flank.

A NEW NUMERICAL METHOD FOR SOLAR CORONA IMAGE PROCESSING
Hana Druckmullerova
Gymnazium, Brno - Reckovice, Brno, Czech Republic

The corona is a solar layer, which radiates for the most part in the X-ray spectrum. It also radiates the visible light. However this radiation is much weaker. Under the corona there is a thin layer called photosphere, which forms the visible solar surface and its color is absolutely white. The brightness of the photosphere makes observation of the corona difficult.<br><br>During a total solar eclipse the Moon obscures the photosphere. The weak light of the corona becomes visible. Unfortunately, there is a large brightness gradient in the corona. Photographing the eclipse, some parts of the corona are overexposed, some underexposed, and a small part is exposed correctly. Registrating (matching) and summing images taken with different shutter speeds permit obtaining images with much more information about the corona than in a single one. However, this information is not visible.<br><br>Ordinary methods visualize only some coronal structures created by the solar magnetic field. I have created a computer program called Corona, which can make all of them visible. It simulates the image analysis used by the human eye. The rays and especially the loops observed in the resulting image are similar to those found in the X-ray images taken by large satellite telescopes.<br><br>The Corona program permits investigation of the structures of the solar corona more easily. Using a camera, a scanner and a computer it is possible to study the structures of the solar magnetic fields, using earth based equipment.<br><br>

DETECTING EXTRASOLAR PLANETS BY PHOTOMETRY
Nina Maria Huffman
Langley High School, McLean, VA, USA

The purpose of the project was to develop an inexpensive method for detecting extrasolar planets, which are planets that orbit stars other than our sun. My hypothesis was that it would be possible to detect the transit of an extrasolar planet using the CCD camera from an inexpensive web cam and a 5-inch telescope.<br><br> First, I developed a mathematical model of the effects on the brightness of a star that a transiting extrasolar planet would produce. This model consisted of a simulation of the planet’s orbit based on Kepler’s equation and two light curve models, one which accounted for limb darkening of the star, and one which did not. I compared the two models with professional experimental data, including data from the Hubble Space Telescope, and other amateur data. I found that my theoretical light curve could fit the experimental data almost perfectly with the correct choice of parameters.<br><br> My next step was to try to take my own data using my telescope. First I constructed a photometer by taking the CCD camera from an inexpensive web cam and placing it inside a black box, which I constructed to attach to the telescope. To determine the accuracy of my photometer, I took data from several non-varying stars. From a statistical analysis of this data, I determined that its standard deviation was 5% or greater, which is insufficient accuracy to detect transiting planets. However, by averaging approximately 200 frames, the standard deviation is decreased to significantly less than 1%, which would allow me to easily detect a 1.5% drop in a light curve. A 1.5% drop is expected to be typical of Jupiter-sized transiting planets, such as the one orbiting HD209458.<br><br> Through careful analysis, I determined that it theoretically should be possible to detect a transiting extrasolar planet through these inexpensive methods.

TURNING THE RED PLANET INTO A GREEN PLANET: MODELING THE MARTIAN GREENHOUSE EFFECT
Brian Anthony Geistwhite
Farmington High School, Farmington New Mexico, United States of America

The objective of this experiment was to create and test a mathematical model of the effects of solar radiation and re-emitted greenhouse radiation on the temperature of Mars. This model would have the ability to calculate the strength of the greenhouse effect that would exist if Mars had an atmosphere more massive than its current atmosphere.<br><br>The hypothesis was that the model would predict Mars' current average surface temperature to within 2 Kelvin, and the model will predict a 30-40 Kelvin increase in temperature for a Mars with a 100 millibar atmosphere.<br><br>After much research had been done concerning the nature of planetary heat gain and loss, a radiative transfer model was created using several physical and mathematical laws and educated scientific reasoning.<br><br>The model predicted an equilibrium temerature of 210.4 K for a 0 mbar atmosphere, 220.4 K for 7 mbars, 224.2 K for 25 mbars, 225.8 K for 50 mbars, 226.5 K for 75 mbars, 226.8 K fo 100 mbars.<br><br>The model predicted the average surface temperature of Mars fairly accurately. Its prediction of heating due to the greenhouse effect topped out at 17 kelvin total, much less than was expected and not suitable for sufficiently heating Mars.

THE EFFECT OF TROPICAL CYCLONES ON GLOBAL TROPICAL RAINFALL
Monica Simo
MAST Academy, Miami, FL, USA

The tropical cyclone rainfall climatological studies performed for the North Pacific and North Atlantic basins by Rodgers et al. (2000, 2001) were expanded to the global level to assess the impact of tropical cyclones on the global rainfall.<br><br> Passive microwave satellite observations that are used to estimate monthly tropical rainfall amounts were used to attain global rainfall totals for each year. These amounts were compared to estimates of tropical cyclone rain rates from a satellite-based computer model to evaluate the impact of tropical cyclone rainfall on the global tropical rainfall per year.<br><br> The results of these comparisons show that tropical cyclones contribute 6.0% of the global tropical rainfall in 1998, 4.6% in 1999, 5.6% in 2000, 5.8% in 2001, and 5.6% in 2002. It is also shown that the areas receiving the most tropical cyclone rainfall generally do not receive high totals of tropical rainfall, being arid regions. The results of this study are ideally suited to supplement local, regional, and/or global climate studies.<br><br>

THE LOCATION AND CHARACTERISTICS OF ATMOSPHERIC INVERSIONS OVER LAKEVIEW, OREGON
Timothy Paul Kendrick
Lakeview Senior High School, Lakeview, Oregon, United States of America

Lakeview, Oregon is a dying timber and ranching town of 2800 inhabitants. A local nonprofit organization is planning to locate a biomass generating plant in Lakeview to enhance the economic base of Lakeview while reducing forest stocking levels which are responsible for extensive forest fires in our area. The air quality of Lakeview due to burning wood emmisions becomes an area of concern. Lakeview is located at the western base of the Warner mountain range which runs north and south. On sunny mornings following cold nights an atmoshperic inversion forms over Lakeview trapping pollution and reducing air quality. The goal of this project is to determine the location and characteristics of the inversions. This information could be used to determine the best placement and/or mitigation plan of the proposed power plant. The location of the inversions was determined by taking compass bearings from three locations out of town, plotting the bearings on a map. These measurements were verified by photographing one inversion from the air and plotting one inversion from a peak directly above Lakeview. The depth of the inversion was determined by taking clinometer readings of the inversion altitude from the three locations out of town as well as checked by flying a weather balloon that could be observed from out of town. Temperature was plotted against altitude by attaching a HOBO temperature recorder to the weather balloon as it was flown to locate the specific altitude of the warmer air trapping the cold air.

AGE DETERMINATION AND SIZE RECONSTRUCTION OF 15TH CENTURY NORTH ATLANTIC CODFISH (GADUS MORHUA L.) FROM AKURVIK, NW ICELAND
Shaye Storm
Midwood High School, Brooklyn New York, United States

Today, as North-Atlantic commercial fish stocks collapse, it appears that large-scale commercial fisheries now represent a major threat to entire marine environments. The present crisis cannot be effectively addressed from the narrow perspective that available data gives us. Little is known of the nature of the fish stocks exploited prior to the mid-19th century. In order for solutions to be formulated, a long-term perspective of fishery data is essential. This study investigates the effects of commercial exploitation of cod, extending from the 15th century to the modern era. The average age of cod being caught for commercialization has been reduced from 9.14 years to 5.60 years over the past five centuries. This study is a first step towards a better integration of long-term archaeological and fishery data. This is with the goal that more effective fishery management strategies can be formulated, and that the trend of collapse can be reversed.

WATER ON MARS: HOW MUCH THEN, HOW MUCH NOW?
Erin Lynn Frey
South River High School, Edgewater MD, USA

The search for water on Mars is critical to the search for, or support of, past, present and future life on the planet. We attempt to understand the nature and extent of the water table on Mars, and to determine the amount of water required to make the recent fluvial features (“gullies”) there. We studied gullies in three different areas on the planet, ranging from hydrogen (water) rich to hydrogen (water) poor. We searched for these features in high-resolution MOC (Mars Orbiter Camera) photographs. We then derived a depth-lighting geometry relationship to determine the depth, width, length and volume of each gully. From these parameters, we were able to determine the minimum amount of water required to form all the gullies in each area. We found that in dry (hydrogen-poor) areas, gullies form further from the surface, are deeper, wider and require much more water in their formation, while in wet (hydrogen rich) areas, gullies form closer to the surface, are narrow, shallow and require much less water to form. We propose a model of gully formation that satisfies these parameters, and find support for this model in thermal infrared images from the planet. In addition, we find that the lateral extent of the water required to form gullies in all areas is so small that it must represent only a tiny fraction of the likely water table. That is, it is highly likely that significant amounts of water still remain on Mars today.

SUNSPOTS MOVE ACROSS THE VISIBLE SIDE OF THE SUN AT A RATE OF 14.6 DEGREES PER DAY
Richard Alexander Barbieri
Sherando High School, Stephens City VA, USA

This project determined the rotation rate of the sun using sunspots as reference points. The hypothesis stated that the sun would rotate with a period of 25 days at the equator, based on research from “Solar Views” and other online solar analysis data sources. In addition, it was hypothesized that solar rotation rate would decrease with distance from the solar equator.<br><br> The experiment was performed using a Meade 10" Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope with a full aperture solar filter. Hand drawings of the sun and associated sunspots were made on a daily basis (limited by weather). As an additional and alternate data source, satellite imagery from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) satellite was collected via the Internet on a daily basis.<br><br> The observed sunspot positions were converted to solar latitude and longitude coordinates. Solar rotation rates were then computed accounting for the Earth's movement around the sun and the exact time of the observations.<br><br> It was found that the sun rotated at approximately 14.6 degrees per day, or a complete rotation in 24.6 days. These findings closely matched the original hypothesis. The experiment did not find any significant differences in rotation speed at different solar latitudes. This was due to the fact that no sunspots were observed with solar latitudes greater than +/- 20 degrees.

TARGETED DISRUPTION OF TORNADIC VORTICES: SAVING LIVES, SAVING PROPERTY
Thomas Adam Stegall
HBS Academy, Charlotte, North Carolina, USA

Tornadoes are deadly forces of nature that currently have not succumbed to attempts to reduce their power. This project is to determine if tornadic vortices can be disrupted and that disruption is most effective at the top of the tornado. To create a tornado simulator, pieces of black cardboard and plastic sheeting were used to construct a model. In the simulator, Sterno heated water and air, causing warm air to rise, which drew in cold air form the environment through side slits in the box. This simulated the orthogonal rotation and low pressure center of an actual tornado. Three straws were inserted at different levels into one side of the box to facilitate delivery of air puffs. These puffs simulated the targeted, non-nuclear ordinance that disrupts naturally occurring tornados. One hundred puffs per straw were delivered, and each tornado was, indeed, disrupted. The base of the tornado required, on average, 7.0817 seconds to reform, whereas the top and middle required 4.1525 and 5.5619 seconds, respectively. Data inversion was necessary to correctly compare the simulator's vortex to natural tornados. This is because the simulator's energy comes from storm clouds. As determined in the research, a targeted physical assault on the tornadic vortex will effectively disrupt the tornado's airflow and equilibrium, thereby minimizing loss of life and property.

WATT'S A CLEAN RENEWABLE ALTERNATIVE ENERGY?
Kasey Blythe Painter
Enid Public School, Enid, Oklahoma, USA

The working hypothesis is that Goodwell, Oklahoma is the most productive location for a wind farm (wind generated power plant) in the state of Oklahoma. This would be true if it has the most days with winds of 6.7 mph or greater, the speed at which wind can generate electricity. <br><br>The procedure for making this determination included downloading and counting the Oklahoma Mesonet 10-meter daily average wind speeds of 6.7 mph or greater for the 102 Mesonet stations (network of environmental monitoring stations, at least one in each of Oklahoma’s 77 counties) from 1994-2003. The number of days with missing data was subtracted from the total number of days. Next, I calculated the percentage of days that had potential of producing wind energy. Finally, using these percentages, I located the best site in Oklahoma for a wind generated power plant. Boise City had wind speeds of 6.7 mph or greater 97% of the time. Goodwell and Weatherford were close seconds with 96% of the time. For the sample data, a one-way analysis of variance was conducted. This comparison reveals a trend for the average speed at Weatherford (13.9) to be higher than both Boise City (12.02) and Goodwell (12.32). <br><br>Boise City, Oklahoma has the most days with winds 6.7 mph or greater; however, Weatherford, Oklahoma has the highest average wind speed. More research is needed to determine the best location. Therefore, the working hypothesis is not accepted, Goodwell, is not the best location but is an excellent possibility.<br><br>

THE UTILIZATION OF ACID SET FREE BY ACROMYRMEX LUNDI AS AN ALTERNATE SOURCE FOR THE PRODUCTION OF NATURAL ENERGY CAPABLE OF INCREASING GROUND CONDUCTIVITY
Doel Obed Santana
Colegio Maria Auxiliadora, Carolina, PR

The need for data related to ground conductivity in planning radio- communication services, and band waves has increased over the years. Butwhat if there exists a natural means to increase ground conductivity, that will allow energy to flow capable of assisting the plannig of radio- communication services? This investigation attempts to utilize the acid naturally feed by the ant Acromyrmex lundi when it feeds, as an alternate source for the production of natural energy capable of increasing ground conductivity. Two 24" x 24" ant farms were used in which 500g of sand treated with foam were added. The pH and ground conductivity, and the mass of two pieces of vanilla cake that were placed inside the farms were measured. After a week, the pH, the ground conductivity and the mass of the remaining piece of cake were measured again. After thorough cleaning of the farms, the process was repeated using pieces of chocolate, banana and sausage on different weeks. After this investigation it was determined that the acid feed by the Acromyrmex lundi is capable of increasing ground conductivity where ants feed and this gives way to the production of natural energy which in high concentrations, would be useful for subterranean radio- communication.

THE EFFECT OF TIME OF DAY ON GPS ACCURACY
Kevin Andrew Sihlanick
Central Virginia Governor's School/Jefferson Forest High School, Forest VA USA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine how GPS error varies during a 24-hour period. The data used in the project were collected between January 31st and February 1st in a field next to Thomas Jefferson’s Poplar Forest in Central Virginia. A GPS receiver was placed in a modified aluminum box with a laptop computer and a battery. This box was placed on a geological survey marker for the purpose of having a reference point with which to compare the GPS data. Position data were exported from the GPS to a .txt file on the laptop once every second for 24 hours. Once data were obtained, it was analyzed using Microsoft Excel using spherical trigonometry to find the distance between the given GPS location and the actual location of the GPS receiver. An ANOVA test was used to determine if a significant difference existed between different groups of data. With a p-value of 0.0089, it was concluded that time of day does have a significant effect on the error of GPS measurements. The measurements between 7:00 and 9:59 and the measurements between 22:00 and 00:59 were both significantly different from the group containing data from 10:00 to 12:59.

A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF FACIES SEQUENCES IN THE PENNSYLVANIAN OQUIRRH BASIN: THE THORPE HILLS AND CASCADE MOUNTAIN
Caroline Victoria Larson
Provo High School, Provo 84604, Utah, United States of America

The purpose of this project was to determine grain composition of coeval cycle caps at two localities to determine if depositional conditions were uniform across the Pennsylvanian Oquirrh Basin of north-central Utah. The data obtained from the localities showed that the Thorpe Hills along the southern end of the Oquirrh Basin contained several shallow-water facies capping cycles. <br><br> A section of rock within the Thorpe Hills was described and mapped by collecting rocks at all outcrops, preparing thin sections, and analyzing the thin sections using the light microscope. Using Dunham’s Classification Scheme (1962), carbonates were identified as mudstones, wackestones, packstones, and grainstones based on percentage of mud to grains. This section of study contained numerous units of facies that were identified as packstones-grainstones. Facies were determined as Photozoan (shallow-water) or Heterozoan (deeper water) assemblages due to the constituents contained within the rock samples.<br><br> Correlating the Thorpe Hills Section with Cascade Mountain of the Wasatch Range (35 miles to the east), was accomplished by matching several low-stand sandstone and dolostone units found within both sections. Constituents from Cascade Mountain that correlated to the Thorpe Hills section were identified in the same manner as those of the Thorpe Hills. The Photozoan-Heterozoan assemblages of the carbonate constituents in thin sections of Cascade Mountain showed that this section contained few capping cycles that could be considered "shallow-water facies."<br><br> Based on these findings, it has been determined that during the time of deposition of sediment within both sections, sea level deepened eastward and shallowed westward.<br><br>

OZONE EVENT DAYS-THE EFFECT OF METEOROLOGY AND TOPOGRAPHY ON FORMATION AND TRANSFORMATION OF OZONE IN THE LOWER ATMOSPHERE
Chen-Jui Liang
National Taichung Second Senior High School, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.

The effect of meteorology and topography on formation and transformation of ozone in coastal and basin areas is seldom studied. In this study, 22 air-monitoring stations' data were analyzed. Vertical sampling and analysis were conducted using a big balloon apparatus; Tenax-TA column and GC-MS. Advanced reaction experiments were developed. The correlation between relative humidity and ozone is the highest, with solar radiation second. The ozone concentration in the coastal area is always low due to high humidity, but is high in the basin due to the basin effect. The formation rate (R) and disappearance rate constant (L) of ozone event days were obtained. The values of R and L change from positive to negative around 14:00. These values are lower from 14:00~15:00 due to photochemical smog formation. Another lower values before 16:00 is possibly due to ozone reaction with moisture. The concentration of ozone, nitric oxide, and nitrogen dioxide in the basin is always higher than the coastal area, and variability with altitude is obvious. Hydrocarbons were identified, and their altitude distributions investigated. THC, paraffin, and olefins in the coastal area are higher than in the basin, and the concentrations increase with increasing altitude, but in the basin they decrease. Two types of ozone event days were defined: (1) the wind blew out of the basin, ozone concentration decreased with wind direction; (2) the wind blew into the basin, ozone concentration increased with wind direction. These of R and L values were calculated and were discussed in detail. Ozone concentration is not dependent on wind direction; topography and surrounding conditions are more relevant. A purely statistical model was developed. The reaction rate and rate constant of ozone reaction with moisture were also obtained.

A METEOR SHOWER FROM THE POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS ASTEROID 2001 YB5
Huan Meng
Beijing No. 80 High School, WangJing, Chaoyang District, Beijing 100102, China

The calculation of the orbit of the potentially hazardous asteroid 2001 YB5 suggested its possible meteor shower, whose radiant is in constellation Cancer, and might be active on Jan. 7, 2002. It is interesting that the radiant and velocity parameters of this potential shower are similar with the delta-Cancrid meteor shower (DCA for short), but reach maximum flux about 10 days ahead (Jan. 7 vs. Jan. 17).<br><br> Observations with both visual and video technique were performed for monitoring on appropriate days (Jan. 7/8, 11/12, 15/16, 16/17, and 17/18). As the result of the video observations on Jan. 7, a sharp radiant with different structure in contrast to traditional DCA’s diffuse background was detected around the predicted maximum time. Its coordinate was at RA = 117.46°, Dec = +12.45° (for solar longitude = 286.00°). This point is 5° away from the calculated radiant position of 2001 YB5, but 10° away from traditional DCA center. On the same night, visual observers reported unusual high rate from constellation Cancer. Both results indicated that 2001 YB5 did produce a weak meteor shower. Furthermore, we noticed that 2001 YB5 belongs to the rare B-type asteroid from our spectral observation, which has the same type with the parent body asteroid (3200) Phaeton of the only known asteroid-related meteor shower Geminids.<br><br> The contributions of this project are twofold. Firstly, the meteor shower associated with asteroid 2001 YB5 were first detected and distinguished from the background of DCA. This is among the few samples of “meteor shower – asteroid” connection. Secondly, the possible connection between B-type asteroid and meteor shower are noticed and need to be further investigated.

ORIGINAL CALCULATIONS FOR THE HABITABLE ZONE IN TRINARY STAR SYSTEMS
Alistair Thompson Hayden
Huron High School, Ann Arbor Michigan, United States of America

Many stars in our galaxy are members of multiple star systems. In the search for extra-terrestrial life, it is important for us to know which star systems are habitable. The purpose of this project was to establish whether or not planets in trinary star systems can be habitable. To determine this, I used the laws of physics to write a computer program to simulate the orbits of the three stars in hierarchical trinary systems (binary systems in which one component is itself binary) and one planet orbiting the solitary component. Then I found whether or not the planet was capable of supporting life for long periods of time based on the total amount of energy received from all three stars. In this project, I show that habitable planets can indeed exist in trinary star systems, though not in all instances. In addition, I found that as the third component was moved further away from the binary component, the time period of the “envelope” containing the energy fluctuations as well as the stability of the entire system increased.

A COMPARISON OF THE MISSION CANYON, LODGEPOLE, SWIFT, AND RIERDON LIMESTONE FORMATIONS BY THE COLLECTION OF INVERTEBRATE FOSSILS
Kellie Ann Kolczak
Malta High School, Malta MT, USA

This project’s purpose determines if changes in the marine environment of the Panthalassic Ocean between the Jurassic Period and the Mississippian Period, occurred in the region of the future Little Rocky Mountains in Montana. The hypothesis states changes did occur in the Panthalassic Ocean from 320-170 million years ago based on the fossil evidence of invertebrate organisms from the Mission Canyon formation, Lodgepole Limestone formation, and the Swift and the Rierdon Limestone formations in the Little Rocky Mountains. <br><br> The procedure required collection of equal volume (3.78 liters) of material from each of the three sites; the material included specific fossils and matrix material. Each location's latitude, longitude, and elevation were determined by GPS. Back in the lab, I separated the fossils from the matrix rock by first soaking them in acetic acid for 1-3 days. Next, each fossil was numbered according to site, scientifically classified, and listed on a spreadsheet. The Swift and Rierdon limestone formation resulted in 64% of the fossils collected being belemnites. <br><br> In the Mission Canyon limestone formation 87% of the fossils collected were crinoids. In the Lodgepole limestone formation 50% of the fossils collected were brachiopods. In conclusion, the Panthalassic Ocean, which covered the region of the future Little Rocky Mountains, was shallower during the Mississippian period than it was during the Jurassic period. As the sea levels dropped the dominant animal species changed.

THE DETERMINATION OF UV PROTECTION THRESHOLDS WHEN EXPOSED TO SUNLIGHT
Leisha Spaulding
Roy High School, Roy, UT. USA

The purpose of this project was to determine the time of day at which UV protection is not required to protect against sunburn based on the remaining hours of sunlight. <br><br> Experiments used to determine UV protection thresholds were performed during July. UV index readings were taken every hour of each day as reasonably possible. A Safesun Sensor manufactured by Optix Tech Inc, Washington D.C. was used to measure the UV index. Experiments were performed in July because that is the month in which the northern hemisphere receives the most amount of UV radiation. <br><br> All of the UV index readings were converted to units of UV radiation (mW/sq meter). An average UV radiation was calculated for each hour. These averages were used to generate an equation that could predict the UV radiation for every hour of a typical July day. A statistical analysis was used to verify the integrity of the equation. This equation was then integrated with respect to time from certain hours of the afternoon to sunset in order to calculate the remaining UV exposure of the day.<br><br> These exposure values were compared to published minimal erythemal dose limits of each skin type. It was determined that maximum UV protection should be used until approximately 4:00 pm (type IV), 5:00 pm (type III), 5:30 pm (type II), and 6:30 pm (type I). The thresholds determined by this project are applicable to the location of the experiments due to the many environmental factors associated with UV radiation. <br><br>

A MULTI-SPECTRAL ANALYSIS OF ATMOSPHERIC TRANSMISSION
Aneesh Keshav Venkat
York High School, Yorktown, VA, United States of America

This investigation demonstrates a simple remote sensing and analysis technique for the measurement of the water vapor content in the atmosphere and its feedback on the Earth Radiation Budget (ERB). Water vapor has both a cooling effect (by impeding solar radiation) and a warming effect (by trapping infrared radiation emitted by the Earth) on the Earth’s temperatures. Earlier predictions indicate that atmospheric water vapor contributes significantly to global warming. To verify the predictions, the atmospheric water vapor content was obtained by measuring the infrared spectral content of the solar radiation using a home-built instrumentation system that consisted of multi-spectral filters, silicon detectors, data acquisition, and tracking system. An innovative calibration technique which measures the infrared radiation intensities for different water levels was devised to obtain the atmospheric water vapor content. The results indicated higher temperatures with lower atmospheric opacities (higher optical depths). The hypotheses that the water vapor content in the atmosphere will have a direct correlation and a positive feedback on the ERB were supported by this investigation. Future research will include measurements of atmospheric gases using additional instrumentation. <br><br> <br><br>

SOUND WAVE PROPAGATION IN BRINE POOLS
Alison Karee Slowey
Saint Michael's Academy, Bryan Texas, U.S.A.

Brine pools are seafloor depressions containing high concentrations of dissolved salt and low oxygen levels. Scientists imaging brine pools with acoustic systems observe unusual relationships between sound source frequency and the amount of sound reflected from the interface between the brine and overlying seawater. To understand these observations, I modeled sound propagation at the interface to characterize the relationships between the frequency of the emitted pulse and the amounts of reflected and transmitted sound. I wrote a program using MATLAB that represents the seawater–brine interface as small layers. Based upon seawater temperature and salinity reported for Orca Basin, the temperature and salinity for each layer were estimated and used to calculate water density and sound velocity, and then determine the gradient of acoustic impedance. Given a down-going sound pulse of specified frequency and amplitude, the net amplitude in each water layer was calculated at regular time intervals, allowing wave propagation to be traced over distance and time. An inverse asymptotic relation was found to exist between frequency and reflected amplitude (direct relation between wavelength and reflected amplitude). In contrast, the transmitted amplitude is similar for all frequencies. The shape and amplitude of the reflected pulse depend on the way reflections from within the seawater–brine interface interfere. This interference is a function of the interface thickness and the frequency of the initial wave.

PHOTOMETRIC DETECTION OF AN EXTRA-SOLAR PLANETARY TRANSIT ACROSS HD209458 PHASE II - VOLUMETRIC ANALYSIS AND EXTRAPOLATION FOR SYSTEM
Ved Chirayath
California Academy of Mathematics and Science, Carson, California, U.S.A.

Phase I - I report photometric measurements of HD 209458, an extra-solar planetary system known to have an orbiting planetoid of Jupiter mass by radial velocity measurements. The star has been observed with a 10’’ Meade Schmidt-Newtonian LXD 55 telescope and a thermo-electrically cooled Nikon Coolpix 995 CCD. I detect two full transits at projected transit times defined by radial velocity measurements (Mazeh et al.). An accuracy of +/- 0.01 stellar magnitudes has been achieved using the equipment described. The photometric dimming observed, attributed to the transit of a planet across the stellar disk, is consistent with past photometric measurements made by considerably large observatories (Hubble, Keck I) and provides one of the first small aperture extra-solar planetary detections to date. <br><br> Phase II - Photometric data is used to simulate the extra-solar planetary system. Atmospheric expansion of HD 209458b is extrapolated and interactions within the system predicted. Simulation techniques are applied to the indirect determination of protoplanetary disks and their density structure.

Considering a huge amount of precipitation occurring during the month of November 2003, in the tropical climatic zone of the Island of Puerto Rico, an area in the southwestern part, was greatly affected with landslides and slumps. Being a highly populated area, many homes were destroyed or damaged.<br><br>This research intended to investigate which other factors, besides the amount of precipitation and gravity, were responsible for the landslides and slumps in the Bélgica sector of Guánica, Puerto Rico. It was hypothesized that the soil composition of the area was one of the responsible factors.<br><br>Three samples of soil were collected from the affected area. Other three samples were collected from a nearby sector that was not affected. After conducting percolation tests, it was found that the affected soil retained 89% of water in a fixed time of 24 hours. The other samples of soil, retained around 50% of water for the same period of time. The affected soil had a 9.9 alkaline pH, while the samples from the non affected area were slightly acidic. <br><br>The affected area samples were tested in a diffractometer. The x ray diffraction test showed the presence of montmorillonite. The molecules of this kind of clay have the ability to expand when in contact with water; thereby increasing the volume and mass of the soil. This made it easier for the gravitational pull to act upon it. <br><br>The study shows that it is risky for humans to construct on hillsides with this kind of soil composition. <br><br>

The hypothesis stated that as the sunspot number increased, the number and intensity of solar flares would also increase during the same time period. In the experiment, a 3.05 meter radio telescope capable of detecting the radio wave signals produced by solar flares at 3.7 - 4.2 GHz was constructed. The telescope tracked the Sun during weather appropriate days over a seventy-five day period. Solar flare occurrences were interpreted from the data received. Twenty-two solar flare events were successfully recorded by the telescope and verified by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites. The results of the experiment did not support the hypothesis. No significant relationship appeared between the sunspot number and either the recorded flares by the telescope or the recorded flares by NOAA. Future research could test the hypothesis that the number and intensity of flare events may be directly related to the size of individual sunspot groups. With the ability to predict the occurrence of solar flares from sunspot activity, it may be possible to prevent the damage to power grids and satellites caused by solar flares.

MARS OR BUST: DETERMINING SUITABLE LOCATIONS FOR COLONIZATION BASED ON TERRAIN CHARACTERISTICS
Tiffany A Legg
Duncan Senior High School, Duncan, OK, USA

The intention of this study is to examine the surface of Mars and locate regions suitable for human exploration that are evident of desirable characteristics. An inquiry arises: Has the surface water of Mars evaporated or has it seeped into an aquifer? I hypothesize that equatorial regions of Mars are suitable for exploration, and the Martian paleo-water has seeped through permeable regolith into an aquifer.<br><br> Through research, a guide was created that features 1,000 locations on Mars and characteristics of each. Maps were plotted showing surface and atmospheric conditions, and used in contrast with each other, determined locations for exploration. It was observed that equatorial regions may be the best candidates for human exploration. Characteristics of terrain were examined, and several locations show gullies with no apparent sources, therefore suggesting presence of groundwater. Furthermore, subliming ice on the Martian surface exhibits evidence of evaporation.<br><br> Salt deposition in analog Mars soil was demonstrated by dissolved solution of MgSO4 and NaCl in H2O showed results: the microscopic imaging displayed salt crystal formation in dark surface crust and differing textures presented by the salts. In comparison to Mars, the simulant soil showed similarities physically, and chemically, indicating phenomena of evaporative pumping via water, and formation of evaporites on Mars. <br><br> Applications of this study were determined: in future manned missions to Mars, location of safe and resourceful sites for exploration are necessary. The guide devised during research may be utilized in the creation of software useful in mapping Mars.<br><br> In conclusion, ten locations suitable for human exploration were selected, and were located within 20o of the equator. Also, it is suspected that water has seeped beneath the surface into an aquifer, leaving behind surface sulfate and chloride salts.

LUNAR CRATER MORPHOLOGY
Bethany Joy Wentzell
Memorial High School, Victoria, Texas, USA

Is there a relationship between the morphology of a lunar crater and the diameter? Using an eight inch telescope, charged couple device, computer and CCDOPS software, lunar photographs were taken and used by the researcher to calculate the depths of 109 craters of various sizes. Measuring crater diameter, solar elevation and shadow length were accomplished with Scion software. The researcher calculated crater rim height from shadow length of crater, created a plot of crater diameter versus crater depth and determined a mathematical relationship between them. A depth/diameter curve of best fit was evident on the scatter plot and the relationship for basin depths was Y=log(X^2). A second plot of crater rim height/diameter versus crater diameter showed a mathematical relationship of Y=log(X^2)/X.<br><br> The data revealed a dip in the logarithmic plot of depth versus diameter that corresponded to the transition from simple to complex crater morphology. This transition is at 15km. Also, the data revealed a huge drop-off in depth with craters over 100km. The relationship between impact crater diameter and shadow length ceased to exist after 100km diameters due to slumping crater walls that result in rim terraces and formation of a central peak in larger craters. These produced a decrease in the depth of a crater relative to its diameter when compared to simple, small-diameter craters. The second plot of crater depth/diameter versus crater diameter revealed the deepest craters relative to their diameter are craters of less than 15km.<br><br>

DETERMINING THE AGE OF STARS USING A MULTIFACETED MATRIX
Rebecca Callan Stanislaw
Park City High School, Park City, Utah, USA

Purpose: To assess the validity of determining the age of stars with a variable independent of a red or blue shift.<br><br> Procedure: I received a database of main sequence stars from SIMBAD, which contained multiple variables. Once I removed all of the binary stars from the database I used (B-V) values to determine the temperature of each star. After obtaining the temperature of each star I was able to group the stars in spectral classes: A, F, G and K. Having the spectral class I was then able to determine the average age of the stars. With the predetermined age I was then able to start searching for isochronal graphs that I would be able to use with the values I had. When searching I found that many isochronal graphs used absolute magnitude instead of visual magnitude, the value I had. Therefor I used visual magnitude and distance in parsecs to determine the absolute magnitude. Also when searching I found that (V-I) was used regularly, so by using the temperature of each star I was able to determine this value. I used these values to create graphs that would work on different isochronal graphs.<br><br> Conclusion: The isochronal graphs I used seemed to be for star clusters instead of individual stars, leaving me with inconclusive data. Though, research is continuing to find an isochronal graph that will work with individual stars. <br><br>

EVALUATING FACTORS AFFECTING GRANULAR SEGREGATION AND STRATIFICATION IN BINARY MIXTURES
Mary Katherine Soltys
Notre Dame Academy, Park Hills KY, USA

Granular flow is important in the geosciences as well as having many industrial applications. Three classifications of binary granular mixtures were poured into vertical Hele-Shaw cells with air or liquid. Results were compared with those predicted by Hernán A. Makse, a leading researcher in granular mechanics. Mixtures of different-sized round beads ranging from 1.5 to 5.0 mm resulted in fairly even mixing, where Makse predicted size-segregation. When mixtures of “rough” 3.0 mm x 4.0 mm cylindrical beads and 4.0 mm round beads were poured through air, there was even mixing where Makse predicted shape segregation. Pouring through liquid did result in shape-segregation. Makse predicted stratification for cylindrical beads with smaller 1.5 mm spheres, but size-segregation was observed. Finally mixtures of small cubic salt grains and various sizes of larger round beads were poured into the cell. Makse stated that this mixture would lead to size and shape-segregation. Segregation was noticed in all cases except for the smallest size difference, where stratification took place. This basically agrees with Makse. These experiments indicate that the outcome of pouring binary mixtures is difficult to predict. The process is complex and there is room for much more experimental study.

CHAOTIC TERRAIN ON EUROPA: EVIDENCE FOR HYDROLOGICAL RESURFACING
Megan Middendorf Van Ness
West Salem High School, Salem Oregon, Polk

Thanks to the Galileo probe, scientists have begun to develop a clearer understanding of Europa, one of the larger Jovian satellites. Through some twelve passes of Europa, Galileo was able to take high-resolution photographs of the Europan surface that revealed its icy terrain. This terrain is thought to be extremely young due to the fact that there are few visible impact craters on its surface. There are, however, mysterious places on Europa's surface that have been called "chaotic" terrain. The surface ice in these particular areas looks like it has been broken up and then put back together. Scientists have been working over these puzzling spots and believe that warm water pockets from underneath the surface rise up and, in particularly thin areas of the icy surface, these pockets are able to break the ice apart. The warm water then seeps through the cracks and freezes. Scientists have mapped very few of these chaotic spots and the nature and structure of similar terrain features on Europa have not yet been analyzed. I have used the Galileo photographic data set to analyze the chaotic terrain features in order to critically evaluate two recently proposed previous hypotheses of chaos formation. Based on my analysis, I propose an alternative explanation for chaos formation, and suggest a possible evolutionary sequence for chaos terrain formation and destruction.

FILTRATION PROPERTIES OF THE SOIL COMPONENTS
Savina Aneja
Detroit Country Day School, Beverly Hills, Michigan, USA

Soil often acts as a filter for ground water, as it is able to filter organic and inorganic pollutants, as well as heavy metal toxins. Soil is composed of four different components including organic matter, sand, silt, and clay. Sand is the largest particle found in most mineral soils; the individual particles are between 2mm to 0.2mm in size. Silt particles are those between 0.2mm to 0.002 mm in size. Particles that are .002mm and smaller are considered to be clay. In addition to varying in size these components are noted for having different properties. The purpose of this study was to determine the soil components that could most efficiently filter different sized particles as well most effectively retain different substances including samples of oil and solutions containing dissolved ions. To complete this study a filtration apparatus was set up using a ring stand, and plastic tubing sealed on one side with cloth netting. Different solutions were poured through the columns containing individual samples of the soil components to observe the soil components’ filtration properties. Applying the data collected in this experiment it is possible to determine the soil component that most effectively retains ions, the soil component that most effectively retains particles ranging in size from 2mm to .002mm, and the soil component that would be ideal for surrounding sites where oil canisters are buried.

A STUDY IN THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE MOVEMENT RATES OF SUNSPOTS AND ACTIVE SOLAR MAGNETIC REGIONS USING A NOVEL MEASUREMENT METHOD
Elyse Autumn Hope
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland, OR, USA

Sunspots, one of the many complex physical features of our active sun, have long been a source of interest to solar astronomers. Not only do the sunspot areas appear cooler and darker, but recent satellite images taken to map internal magnetic currents show sunspots to be areas of extreme magnetic activity. This experiment was generated to test the plausibility of the theory that active solar magnetic regions and sunspots are directly connected. NASA’s Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), in orbit since 1995, has the capability to take both visible light images of sunspots (intensitygrams) and, using sound waves, images of magnetic field patterns (magnetograms). Using sets of archived SOHO intensitygrams and magnetograms from 1998, the distance from the calculated coordinate center of the sun to the visual center of selected sunspot and magnetic features was measured daily during complete sunspot rotations. Each distance measurement was taken six times to allow for an average distance and rate of movement to be calculated for each day. A mean of the average daily movement rates was taken to calculate the average movement rate for each feature. These rates were then compared between intensitygrams and magnetograms using a set of t-tests to test the probability that the means were equal. The tests showed no significant difference between the movement rates, providing conclusive evidence that sunspots and active magnetic regions are the same.<br><br>

WHAT IS HAPPENING TO OUR RIVERS AND WHY?
Branyun Ray Bullard
Saint Pauls High School, Saint Pauls, NC, Robeson County

As rain fall covers an area of land it washes various amounts of contaminants off the banks of rivers and into the river. The amount of contaminants can vary from year to year based on the amount of precipitation. It can also vary based on the size of the river.The rivers contained in the study are listed from largest to smallest as follows: Cape Fear River, Lower Little River and Lumber River.<br><br>Research was based on the observation of corn plants watered from three different rivers the Cape Fear, the Lower Little and the Lumber Rivers. Within four days the germination process began, in Sample A (Cape Fear), followed by Sample B (lower Little) and then Sample C (Lumber). The river with the most contaminants (Cape Fear) produced germination earliest, followed by (Lower Little), (Lumber) and the (Control). After the germination process the largest river's corn plants (Cape Fear) began to die, followed by (Lower Little), (Lumber) and then the (Control). The corn plants watered by the two smaller rivers (Lower Little),(Lumber) and the control grew taller before dying.

ASTEROID OCCULTATIONS: THE OCCULTATION AND DESCRIPTION OF THE ASTEROID 208-LACRIMOSA
Elizabeth English Turner
The Academy of Science and Technology, Conroe Texas, USA

An asteroid occultation occurs when an asteroid, on its orbital path, passes in front of a star creating an eclipse, or a visible drop in magnitude of the star. The purpose of this experiment was to assess the feasibility of determining the size and shape of an asteroid using amateur astronomical equipment. The hypothesis was that it is possible to determine this information. <br><br> Data was obtained by placing amateur astronomers along the predicted path of the occultation and utilizing the star’s disappearance and reappearance times to obtain chords. These chords, representing the time period of the drop in magnitude of the occulted star, were plotted to determine the size and dimensions of the asteroid. The observed time of the occultation is related to the asteroid’s size at a certain point on its predicted path of visibility.<br><br> The predicted occultation was of the 9-magnitude star TYC 1397-1794-1 by the asteroid 208-Lacrimosa. Fourteen astronomers were placed at different locations along the predicted occultation path. Observations from these locations resulted in five successful observations of an occultation. The recorded occultation times for the five sites were then evaluated using a mathematical analysis to determine the asteroid 208-Lacrimosa’s dimensions. The results of this analysis indicated that the subject asteroid has an apparent elliptical shape with dimensions of 40.8 km X 48.8 km.<br><br> The results of this experiment supported the hypothesis that the usage of amateur astronomical equipment could be used to directly observe the size and shape of asteroids.<br><br>

IN PURSUIT OF POPULATION III
Julie Ann Krugler
Grosse Pointe North, Grosse Pointe Woods, MI, USA

Population III stars are the first, metal-poor stars which formed after the Big Bang. This study is aimed to find a low mass Population III star, as well as to better define their characteristics and the parameters used to search for them. Spectra of 20 stars were taken, as well as the Sun, were taken at Kitt Peak National Observatory using the Coude Feed Spectroscope. The data were reduced by removing the effects of stellar radial velocity, atomospheric extinction, and Earth motions. The spectra were then analyzed by comparing them with standard stars and models constructed using the Vienna Atomic Line Database. Their chemistry, abundances, and metallicities were determined. Stars with low metallicities and spectral oddities were found and have been compared with well-known low-metal stars to determine how their characteristics differ from the standard model. The spectral classes and luminosity class of G and K dwarves appear to be the direction in which astronomers should aim their search for Population III stars.

SCORCHED EARTH PHASE III
Jessa Lea Lale
Alpena High School, Alpena Arkansas, USA

The purpose of Scorched Earth Phase III was to determine if native Osage Clay could be used in a commercial clay recipe. <br><br> I first had to prepare the clay. I mixed 3 different versions of the same recipe. One was my control (the standard recipe) the second had the native clay replacing the fire clay, and the third had the native clay replacing the ball clay. Once the clay was mixed I made the test tiles. For the linear shrinkage test I made a 3 cm line on each tile and measured it before and after firing. For the solid volume shrinkage I measured all three dimensions of the tiles, to find the volume, before and after firing. The porosity tiles were fired and weighed individually. They were boiled in water for 1 hour and allowed to soak for 23 more hours. They were weighed again. The strength tiles were fired and placed under a breakage lever. Weights were added until the tile broke. Finally small vases were made using each clay body. <br><br> The linear shrinkage results: clay one shrank 8.41%, clay two shrank 5.27%, clay three shrank 6.55%. The solid volume shrinkage results: clay one shrank 12.07%, clay two shrank 8.92%, clay three shrank 11.01%. The strength results: clay one held 14.58kg, clay two held 12.12kg, and clay three held 11.88kg. The porosity results: clay one 2.34%, clay two 4.23%, clay three 2.05%.<br><br> I concluded that the commercial clay could work in a commercial clay recipe.

NEAR INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY OF PLANETARY ICE ANALOGS
Alandra Roxanne Davis
Jefferson County International Baccalaureate, Birmingham, Alabama, United States

Throughout the galaxy, there is a range of substances from the minute interstellar dust particles to gargantuan celestial bodies (such as stars and planets). Some of these substances are crucial to the maintenance of life on Earth, and some of these substances could be indicative of life elsewhere in space. At present, scientists are focusing on one of the moons of Jupiter, Europa. Europa is the only other large body in the atmosphere containing water, and scientists believe within the ices of Europa exists organic matter, such as water, carbon dioxide, and carbon suboxide (possibly indicative of life).<br><br>Respectively, this experiment is to establish spectral standards for the macromolecule carbon suboxide. Scientists believe carbon suboxide exists in significant amounts on Europa, as well as other destinations of exploration. To simulate conditions in space, the Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy system was cooled to about eleven Kelvin. Then, carbon suboxide gas was released into the system at specified intervals, and as it traveled though the system, the carbon suboxide cooled and transformed into a frozen state. Each time more gas was released into the system, the ice thickened, and scans were run each time to determine the ice sample’s new absorbance. The results showed that carbon suboxide ice had the greatest absorbance at 530 cm-1, 2200 cm-1, 3050 cm-1, and 3700 cm-1 (cm-1= wavenumbers). These results successfully indicated the information needed to determine carbon suboxide ice’s spectral make-up and will significantly aid in further explorations into space.<br><br><br>

NOISY JUPITER PHASE II: PEAK BURST TEMPERATURE AND FLUX DENSITY
Kyle Nathan Jaffa
Sandia High School, Albuquerque, NM, USA

Abstract<br><br> Radio astronomy, an important tool for gathering information, might provide valuable insights into our universe. Jupiter possesses the unique capability of generating radio signals that can be picked up using relatively inexpensive equipment. The purpose of my project was to capture Io-related Jovian radio signals and identify which of its three magnetic source regions produces the strongest radio bursts. My hypothesis is that if I record a known calibrated noise source along with Io-related radio bursts, I can identify the strongest burst producing region because quantitative analysis can be made against a known signal. I also hypothesize that the Io-B region produces the strongest bursts because some strip charts appear to indicate trending that direction. <br><br> I set up a dipole antenna near my home and identified the dates of possible Io-related radio storms. On those dates, I hooked up a 20.1MHz receiver, my laptop and strip chart program, tape recorder and calibrated noise generator, and recorded the storm window. I confirmed legitimate Jupiter signals with the audiotape and with other Jupiter observers. Next, I identified the peak bursts and determined their temperature. Finally, I calculated their flux density and made comparisons.<br><br> My results indicated that the Io-B region is currently producing the strongest peak l-bursts. However, my hypothesis is inconclusive because I recorded only s-bursts from the Io-A region, and I need to compare similar bursts to draw a valid conclusion.<br><br> I hope to continue this project to see if source strength changes might predict pole reversal on Jupiter.<br><br>

APOLIMAC: LOST IN THE TIME
Antonio Mejia Munoz 
Albert Einstein High School, Jr. Callao 358, Lima, 1 PERU

The project "Apolimac: Lost in the Time", centers its interest in the Holed Rock. It owes its name to the valley where it was seated the city of Lima. <br><br> There is little information about the Holed Rock. Until today, it hasn’t been made any astronomical study about possible agricultural purposes. This singular stone also well-known as "Foundational Stone of Lima" was used as a ceremonial center by the Lima Culture in the middle of the century XII. Our research consists on finding its astronomical value. This way, carrying out multiple measures has been proven that it was used as a solar marker with agricultural purposes. <br><br> Such an end was determined obtaining the cardinal points. If the verification of 90° corresponds to the equinoxes of autumn and spring the stone won't project a brilliant image. This changes as the sun comes closer to its extreme point (solstice of winter) at 7:30 am; time in which a brilliant disk will be observed. These measures would have been important to even mark the types of foods that could be cultivated according to the season.<br><br> These data were contrasted with the "Starry-Night" software, that gives enough information that allows specify next dates to the equinox of autumn and the solstice of winter. <br><br> It’s not only demostrated the astronomical use of the rock by the Lima Culture; many researchers sustain that the rock that has been in a center of adoration and ceremonial and it could be transform into a new center of tourist attraction. <br><br>

ELECTROMAGNETIC EARTHQUAKE PRECURSORS
Rigel Ryan Smiroldo
Leigh High School, San Jose Ca, United States

This project was undertaken to investigate whether a relationship <br><br>exists between activity in extremely low frequency (elf) radio waves <br><br>and seismic activity. In other words, is there a positive <br><br>relationship between activity in the elf radio wave band frequencies <br><br>(.1-10Hz) and time and magnitude of earthquakes. I expected a relationship to exist, similiar to the results of previous expiriments done by previous scientists. To test for these relationships, a circuit was built which behaved much like a radio, picking up the elf signal through a 4.2 Henry coil antenna. The signal was filtered, amplified and analyzed using fast Fourier transforms and correlation coefficients. After gathering and analyzing elf data for several months, the results were correlated with data for seismic activity obtained from Usgs (United States Geological Survey).Positive correlations were found between earthquake energy frequency and signal frequency, magnitude and signal strength, earthquake energy and signal strength, slope of signal strength versus time and magnitude, and earthquake phase and signal phase. This signifies an underlying nature of earthquakes that would be enlightening to research in the future.

ORIGINAL AND COMPELLING EVIDENCE OF OVER 100 YEARS OF CLIMATIC WARMING IN ANTARCTICA
Matthew E. Peneston
Phoenix High School, Phoenix, New York, USA

The effects of global warming are becoming increasingly evident in our world. Perhaps the most dramatic examples of this have been the catastrophic breakups of Antarctic ice shelves in the last few years. When climatologists study these events, one of the many questions that arise is “Are these unprecedented catastrophes, or are they part of a continuing cycle of paleoclimatic fluctuation?” One of the best ways to find the answers to these important questions is to study ancient climates, and one of the best ways to study paleoclimate is through the analysis of fossils diatoms in the sedimentary record. My research involved diatoms from a sediment core collected in the Svenner Channel in Prydz Bay, East Antarctica. I used these microfossils to determine how climate patterns in the Svenner Channel had fluctuated over the past 2000 years, and how the recent global warming may have affected the climate cycle of the area. I identified and tabulated over 10,000 individual diatom fossils from a 160 cm long kasten core representing approximately the last 2000 years of the history of the Svenner Channel. I was able to detect a pattern of repeated small-scale fluctuations from ~2000 ybp to ~200 ybp. However, over the last ~200 years, there has been a noticeable decrease in sea ice species, notably Fragilariopsis curta, and a similar increase in open water species. This indicates that in general, the past 2000 years has seen a cycle of continuous fluctuation in relative climate, but no large changes. However, over the last 200 years the overall climate of the region has warmed noticeably.

A NOVEL ALGORITHM FOR COMPUTING THE MINIMUM DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO ELLIPTICAL CONFOCAL ORBITS
Andrei Munteanu
Benjamin Banneker Academic High School, Washington, DC 20009 USA

The problem of finding the minimum distance between two bodies moving on elliptical orbits with common focus has numerous astronomical applications. It is fundamental to the study of the probability of collision between the Earth and minor bodies (asteroids, comets, or meteorites), and between space debris and orbiting space vehicles. This can also improve asteroid mass calculations, shed light on satellite capture theories, and provide insight into the theory of orbits. <br><br> We present a new algorithm for calculating the critical points of the distance function between two orbits. Analytically, we simplify this function by using the eccentric anomalies as the independent variables, and then rotating the reference axis system. We then present a numerical algorithm based on a 2D Newton-Rhapson method that solves the two differential equations of the distance function gradient. We also present a method for picking starting values that force the algorithm to converge on minimum values, and analyze this method’s effectiveness by studying convergence basins, whose boundaries appear to be fractal. We analyze the speed of this method by using it to calculate MOIDs between (1) the Earth and all 70,000 numbered asteroids, and (2) more than 100,000,000 randomly generated orbit pairs.<br><br> Our algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than the traditional method of numerically integrating the equations of motion and searching for close approaches. Additionally, the 2D Newton-Rhapson method is surprisingly efficient at converging on solutions. Moreover, once a particular solution is found, one can immediately use the eccentric anomalies and Kepler’s Equation to skip ahead in orbital periods and find the times of close approach, thus neatly avoiding numerical integrations.<br><br>

THE EFFECTS OF SUNSPOTS ON EARTH II
Humberto Gerardo Mendoza
Hanna High School, Brownsville, Texas, United States of America

The purpose of the proposed study is to describe a relationship between the number of sunspots and aurora activity and the mean temperature of the day in the Alaska region. There is no statistically significant relationship between the number of sunspots and auroral activity and the daily mean temperature. The first thing I did was to study related literature. Then I collected relevant data from the internet database from Alaska. Afterwards, I acquired a map of Alaska to very carefully estimate the territory the aurora borealis covered. I also statistically analyzed the data and interpret it to draw conclusions. The analysis of the data showed no positive relationship between the number of sunspots and auroral activity and the daily mean temperature in the region of Alaska. Therefore, my hypothesis can be accepted.

DRIVING ON THE BEACH: A COMPARISON OF TOTAL PETROLEUM HYDROCARBON LEVELS
Cristina Theresa White
Spruce Creek High School, Port Orange, FL, USA

The purpose of this experiment was to determine if the sand from beaches with vehicular traffic have more total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) than sand from beaches without traffic. Fifty-one samples of beach sand were analyzed from the high tide zone on contiguous beaches that either allow driving or do not allow driving. Samples were obtained from the surface, 5cm below the surface, and 12cm below the surface. TPH was extracted from 10 grams of beach sand per sample with 10 mL of methanol. The resulting solution was filtered and evaluated using a field UF Fluorometer calibrated to EPA standards. The total average TPH on the areas with cars was 2.58 parts per million (ppm) while the total average on the areas without cars was 0.636 ppm. There are 303% more TPH on the areas with cars. The average TPH at the surface with cars was 5.31 ppm where the surface without cars was 0.692 ppm. There are 667% more TPH on the surface where cars are allowed. The differences were statistically different using the t-statistic evaluated at p< 0.05. Organic compounds and phosphates were also tested, and there were higher concentrations of both where cars were allowed. The amount of hydrocarbons found on both beaches is very small. What is significant is that there is a detectable difference between the two beaches. Driving on the beach appears to have a significant effect on the total TPH, organic compounds, and phosphates found in the sand and washing out into the ocean.

CEPHEID STARS AS DISTANCE INDICATORS
Vanessa Marie Mahoney
Stevens High School, Rapid City, SD, USA

This research project was conducted to determine the distance to a Cepheid variable star. A Cepheid star’s brightness, or magnitude, increases and decreases regularly and can be plotted as a periodic function. By finding the length of the Cepheid variable’s period and calculating the absolute magnitude, or actual energy radiated from the star, and comparing it to the apparent magnitude, or apparent brightness as viewed from Earth, the distance to the Cepheid variable star SAO 12472 was calculated. The star SA0 12472 was observed ten different nights over a span of 26 days. The star was photographed every fifteen minutes from 7:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m., dependent of weather conditions. The values were plotted in a light curve, and the length of the period was found to be 1.9601 days. The length of the period was used in the period-luminosity function, and the absolute magnitude of the star was found to be -1.93456 magnitudes. The apparent magnitude of the star was found to be 6.135 magnitudes by averaging the maximum brightness and minimum brightness of the star. The apparent magnitude and absolute magnitude were substituted into the distance relation, and the distance to the star was calculated. With this procedure, it was determined that the distance to SAO 12472 was 491.360 parsecs, or 1,602.64 light years away from earth. These results were compared with published data and found to have a 13.5% error.<br><br>

STELLAR CLASSIFICATION OF FIRST MAGNITUDE STARS THROUGH SPECTRAL IMAGING
Matthew Thomas Walker, Jonathan Alan Chen
Central Florida Christian Academy, Ocoee, Florida, United States of America

This study investigates the feasibility of constructing a low cost diffraction grating spectral analysis system for amateur astronomy.<br><br> In order to test this feasibility, a diffraction grating of 500 lines per millimeter was employed as the major component of the system. In conjunction with a CCD camera, 90mm Takahashi refractor, collimating and focusing lenses, a low-resolution spectrometer was fabricated.<br><br> Twelve stars were imaged and processed utilizing an image-processing program (Astroart) and spectral intensity values were extracted with another application called Vspec. Plots were then generated in Excel for spectral comparison.<br><br> From the results, several conclusions could be drawn. First of all, the final version of the spectrometer generated spectral images that highlighted differentiation between stellar bodies. The most significant factor was that this method of spectral analysis allowed the observed stars to be placed in their true stellar classification category. Finally, a quantitative value was observed that differentiated the observed stars.<br><br>

A STUDY OF THE USE OF STRONG GRAVITATIONAL LENSING IN DETERMINING THE MASSES OF GALAXIES
Amy Hollinger, Lauren Berger, Katherine Trostel 
Hathaway Brown School, Shaker Heights, OH, USA

Gravitational lensing occurs when massive objects, such as galaxies, “warp” space-time, causing the path of light from a source to appear bent. This results in the formation of multiple images of the source. The Lensing Equation can be used to describe this phenomenon. <br><br>Because one of the properties that the bending of light depends upon is the mass of the lens, the mass can be set as the unknown variable and solved for. Other information can be obtained from sources such as the Cosmic Lens All Sky Survey. However, it is not simply a matter of substituting this information into the equation, as the general equation is adapted depending on the model selected. Also, some information cannot be directly observed, and must be indirectly calculated. <br><br>Although there are many different models used to describe the gravitational lens, focus was placed on the point-source, point-lens model and the Singular Isothermal Sphere model. Fifteen events of gravitational lensing were studied.<br><br>Although the calculations yielded reasonable masses for the point-source, point-lens model, simple trigonometry disproved the assumption that the lens was a point, because the angular size of the lens was larger than the angular separation of the images. Therefore, not all of the mass of the galaxy was contained within the visible region of the lens. For the SIS model, however, the mass distribution that we found was consistent with other observational results including cold dark matter structure formation and galactic rotation curves.

Satellite observed that in high latitude of Northern Hemisphere, the length of vegetation growing season increased about 2 weeks during the last 20 years. <br><br>How about in China? We selected an area with significant climate gradient from semi-arid to moist and ecological gradient from grassland to forest in northern China, (115oE-130 oE, 40 oN-45oN).The analysis of the local trend of the length of vegetation growing season from 1982 to 2000 is implemented with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in the NOAA/NASA Pathfinder AVHRR Land Data Sets and mainly with Fourier analysis method. Four vegetation types are focused on: typical steppe, meadow grassland, corn and forest. <br><br>The result shows that the length of vegetation growing season for the four types all obviously increased 15-20 days from 1982 to 2000. Moreover, for typical steppe, the logarithm relationship between rainfall and NDVI, and the quadratic relationship between temperature and NDVI are found as the multi-year averaged characteristics, and based on an inter-annual analysis, the different influences of temperature and rainfall on vegetation growing at different phases are determined. At last the uncertainties of this study are discussed. <br><br>This analysis is to establish the basic knowledge of responses of northeastern China to global warming. <br><br>

INVESTIGATING STARS AND NEBULAE THROUGH THE CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION OF AN ASTRONOMICAL SPECTROGRAPH
Mary Masterman, Sarah Howell, Mimi Nugyen
Classen SAS, Oklahoma City, OK 73106

The purpose of this experiment was to find the elemental composition of stars, nebulae, and galaxies and the spectral classes of stars.<br><br> First a simple cardboard visual spectroscope was built with a transmission grating. Next a flip mirror was modified to hold a reflection grating and 40 mm collimation lens. A Canon EOS 300D digital camera was used to record spectra. The spectrograph was mounted on 30 cm diameter telescope and low-resolution spectra of stars and nebulae were collected.<br><br> A new spectrograph was built with the same grating, using a new total angle of 38° (instead of 90º) and a 135 mm collimation lens. Spectra were obtained using the Canon camera. A slit assembly was built and calibration was done with a mercury lamp. The Canon was replaced with a SBIG ST-7e CCD camera. We added a micrometer to adjust the grating angle. A 0th order photo was taken; then the grating was rotated for spectra exposures. <br><br> The first flip-mirror spectroscope had a spectral resolving power of 50 Ångstroms and had a range of 4000 Ångstroms. The second 38° spectrograph had a spectral resolving power of 6 Ångstroms and had a resolution of 2.6 Å/pixel, with a range of 2000Å. The EOS-300D had problems with dim focusing. The SBIG was more sensitive. <br><br> We used SBIG’s Spectra and Desnoux’s VSPEC program to analyze spectra. With flux calibration Planck temperatures were extracted from star’s spectra. Lines in stars and nebulae indicated elements present. We could usually determine the spectral class of stars.<br><br>

ESR DATING AT MEZMAISKAYA ANBD MATUZKA CAVES, RUSSIA: COMPARING AGES OF PALEOLITHIC SITES IN THE CAUCASUS
Amy Jessica Ortega, Shaunte Baboumian
Townsend Harris High School @ Queens College 149-11 Melbourne ave. Flushing, NY 

To correlate the human occupations at the Mezmaiskaya and Matuzka archaeological sites in Russia, 17 herbivore teeth were analyzed by electron spin resonance (ESR) dating. ESR can date mammalian tooth enamel ranging from 10,000 to 10,000,000 years in age. The Mezmaiskaya teeth dated from 77,000 + 6,200 to 45,000 + 1,000 years old. The Matuzka teeth ranged from 448,000 + 55,000 to 83,000 + 6,000 years old. Therefore, the occupations at Mezmaiskaya and Matuzka did not coincide. Instead, early hominids used Matuzka for almost 400,000 years, but then moved to Mezmaiskaya, which they used for the next 32,000 years.

A STUDY OF NATURAL SOIL AMENDMENTS ON ABELMOSHCUS ESCULENTUS: NUTRIENTS, PH, AND SHOOT HEIGHT
Darvin Jerrell Griffin, Tate, Brittaney A. ; Robinson Roderickis D. 
Noxubee County High School, Macon, MS, USA

The goal of this project was to develop an economical use for the large number of lying down decomposed trees and standing decomposed trees that were present in the community. Decomposed lying down and decomposed standing wood shavings from Quercus falcata, Carya illinoinensis, and Pinus tadea were studied because of the tree’s common occurrences. So, wood shavings were collected from the decomposed lying down and decomposed standing trees to determine if natural nutrients could be used as soil amendments to influence nutrient availability, pH, and shoot height on Abelmoschus esculentus with lime [Ca(OH)2] as the control.<br><br> Abelmoschus esculentus grown in decomposed lying down Quercus falcata wood shavings had the largest average shoot height and largest pH increase from the control over decomposed lying down wood shavings of Carya illinoinensis, and Pinus tadea (pH decresed from the control). Abelmoschus esculentus grown in decomposed standing Carya illinoinensis wood shavings had the largest average shoot height and largest pH increase from the control over decomposed standing wood shavings of Quercus falcata, and Pinus tadea. The macronutrients displayed variances in the phosphorus level for garden rows that contained decomposed standing Carya illinoinensis wood shavings. The potassium level for garden rows that contained decomposed lying down and standing Quercus falcata wood shavings had the only variances from the control. <br><br> The benefits of this project come's by way of survey conducted on the taste of okra. Immediate family members were used to see which had the most preferred taste; artificial or natural soil amendments. <br><br><br><br><br>

VIOLENT PHENOMENA IN QUASARS
Nicolas Aragon, Leandro Jose Augusto Salgueira

We performed time series (V band) photometry of the quasars, 3C-273, AO-0235+164 and 3C-279, during two, four and two nights respectively, using a 215cm reflector telescope and a cryogenically cooled CCD camera, in order to search for fast variability (intra and internight).<br><br>Light curves were constructed using differential magnitudes obtained with Astra Image and IRAF software. Combining their redshifts in a Robertson-Walker decelerating dominated universe, we calculated distances, magnitudes, energy generations, and through the development of an objective statistical analysis performed through a software, we searched for variations in the luminosity flux of the three quasars.<br><br>3C-273 and 3C-279 were quiet but their optical bolometric luminosity suggests the presence of relativistic jets.<br><br>In AO 0235+164 inter and intranight variability was definitely observed, being one of the most violent and fast events for microvariability ever reported, with amplitudes of ~0.1mag, corresponding to ~10E40erg/sec in scales of hours. Adopting the AGN paradigm, the timescale of variations and physical assumptions were used to estimate certain associated parameters, including size of the emitting region, mass of the central black hole, accretion disk size, rate, efficiency among others.<br><br>Since the components of AO-0235+164 are relativistic, Doppler beaming factor was considered throughout the analysis. <br><br>The tremendous displayed energy was carefully studied, and different options to explain such behavior were explored. Microlensing and accretion disk instabilities cannot explain the observed phenomenology; however, relativistic shocks could produce a change of 0.14 in the Doppler beaming factor and explain the variations.<br><br>

MORNITORING INLAND WATER ENVIRONMENT USING REMOTE SENSING SPECTRAL INFORMATION
Chaohao Wang, Junchao Xia
Shanghai High School, Shanghai, China, 200231

A new method was created for analyzing and monitoring inland water environment in large scale, with high frequency and at a low cost, utilizing multi-spectral and high-spectral remote sensing Water samples from Dianshan Lake and the Huangpu River region were taken to establish the method. Water condition parameters and<br><br>spectral reflectance data were obtained from these samples. By using the multi-channel and multi-parameter method, the relativities between chlorophyll and spectral reflectance had been improved from 0.90 to 0.99. The water conditions of Huangpu River and Dianshan Lake were obtained with the retrieval of the multi-spectral and high-spectral images. Combining theoretical analysis with field measurement, we proposed a new method for non-real time TM data spectral reflection calibration. Based on this method, the changes of the inland water conditions were retrieved. The new method was applied successfully in monitoring other water regions. The results were compared against data publicized by local environmental agencies. The mean error of retrieval was around 20 percent. The demonstration software, developed using Visual-Basic, was designed and completed to show research results. These results illustrate that the main water quality parameters, such as chlorophyll content, suspended substances and total phosphorus content, can be determined by utilizing the multi-spectral and high-spectral remote sensing method used in this research.

THE INFLUENCE OF NON-SYNCHRONOUS ROTATION ON PATTERNS IN THE ORIENTATION OF ICE FRACTURES ON THE SURFACE OF EUROPA.
Kyle Robert Strom, Emily Louise Ricq
Red Mountain High School, Mesa Arizona, United States of America

The intent of this experiment is to support or negate a model of the sixth innermost moon of Jupiter, Europa. This model features a surface covered with fractures due to stress caused by an ice shell that rotates non-synchronously with its mantle and core because of an underlying ocean. This rotation is produced by the gravitational pull of Jupiter, Europa’s elliptical shape and orbit, and the ocean. The stress field that results from non-synchronous rotation dictates that the fractures should rotate clockwise in the northern hemisphere with time. Through this investigation, significant global trends were discovered, and substantial evidence was found indicating the presence of an ocean. <br><br> Raw data of fractures was collected from seven high resolutions images of varying sizes and latitudes in the northern hemisphere. Stratigraphic charts showing the fractures’ chronology were created for each area using the principle of superposition, the orientation of the fractures was measured, and the well-constrained groups of sequential lineaments, called strings, were analyzed for regular clockwise rotation. Over one million kilometers squared of the surface were analyzed, and on average 76% percent of the fractures regularly rotated clockwise.<br><br> It was statistically concluded that areas with many lineaments and areas in high latitudes showed more consistent regular clockwise rotation. All areas showed clockwise rotation; those with the least amount of expected regular rotation had few lineaments and were near the equator. Furthermore, there were no instances of regular counter-clockwise rotation. These results support the hypothesis and thus the presence of an underlying ocean.<br><br>

SAND: VARIABLES THAT AFFECT THE ANGLE OF REPOSE
Dustin David Chilcoat, T.J. Ross
Westmoore High School, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States

Photographs taken by the Mar’s Viking, orbiter and global surveyor, show debris streaks on the slopes of the craters and canyons of Mar’s surface. The angle of repose presented by these streaks exceeds that of dry material as observed in laboratory examination. It was hypothesized that liquid must be present to maintain such a slope.<br><br> To test this hypothesis an acrylic box capable of being rotated was attached to an acrylic base via a knurled nut. Twelve kilograms of 40 micrometer sifted sand was divided into six samples of two kilograms each. Water was added to five of the samples in the amount of 5%, 7.5%, 10%, 12.5%, 15%, and 17.5%, with the control sample remaining dry. The control angle of repose was exceeded at 37º and the highest angle occurred with 15% water at 89º. The tests were repeated using glycerin to compare the actions of a dissimilar liquid. <br><br> Present surface temperatures on Mar’s were not addressed because it was assumed that the slope movement occurred at an earlier geologic time of unknown temperature, although Viking photographs suggest some slopes of recent origin. <br><br> The findings suggest that water in liquid form could have been present on the crater surface of Mars to account for the angle of the Martian slope streaks. In addition, calculations regarding crater and canyon angle measurements on Mars can be compared to the findings of Sand: Variables That Affect the Angle of Repose.<br><br>

EYE OF THE STORM: A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE AND HURRICANE INTENSITY
John Christopher Turner
Lincoln High School, Tallahassee, Florida, United States of America

The hypothesis of this project was that there would be a direct relationship between the sea surface temperature and the intensity of a tropical system. This was based upon the structure of tropical cyclones and their process of development. This study was designed to determine whether or not sea surface temperature could be accurately used by forecasters and civilians to predict the intensification of tropical cyclones.<br><br> A list was created of all tropical storms and hurricanes between the years 1982 and 2004, their daily coordinates, central air pressure, and wind speed. Using satellite maps of the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico sea surface temperatures from corresponding dates, data was gathered on the surface temperature in the approximate location of each storm, for each 24 hour period. All of the data was then arranged into tables and graphs relating the variables to each other.<br><br> In conclusion, there was a relationship between the sea surface temperature and the intensity of the storms. Generally, patterns emerged that depicted this correlation, however, there were also anomalies that were likely caused by outside meteorological factors such as upper air systems and fronts. The overall relationship between these factors is caused by the direct effect water temperature has on the amount of evaporation into the storm and the effects of this on central air pressure. Therefore, forecasters and civilians in tropical cyclone prone regions along the eastern seaboard should have a heightened awareness of the present state of the ocean and its effect on tropical systems.<br><br>

GEOCHEMISTRY OF THE SOUTHERN JUAN DE FUCA RIDGE: ISOTOPIC MANTLE SOURCE INVESTIGATIONS
Sarah Rose Langberg
Canterbury School, Fort Myers, FL, USA

<br><br><br> The existence of off-axis volcanic activity raises the prime question: what is the magma source that facilitates these distant eruptions? This research is grounded in the analysis of isotopic ratios (differing and distinct as a result of isotopic decay from source abundances) and serves as a mantle investigation to reveal the source of magma that characterizes off-axis volcanism at the Southern Juan de Fuca Ridge (JdFR). This researcher hypothesized that highly fractionated samples that had erupted off-axis were derived from dikes radiating off of the main JdFR magma chamber beneath the active eruptive axis, rather than a different, unknown mantle melt source. <br><br> <br><br> Seafloor exploration across transects of the JdFR with remotely operated vehicle technology provided samples that ranged from axial eruptives to rocks up to 4 km away from the Mid-Ocean Ridge axis (including those indicative of off-axis volcanism). Isotopic analysis was performed to determine if all samples in the suite had originated from the same mantle source. Ion exchange column chemistry allowed for geochemical investigations through thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). 87Sr/86Sr and 143Nd/144Nd isotopic ratios were calculated from TIMS and ICP-MS analysis (respectively) and were proven to be extremely homogenous among all samples. The isotopic ratios of off-axis eruptive samples (on both sides of the ridge) were virtually chemically identical to those of rocks that had erupted along the axis of the JdFR, thus originating from the same mantle melt source and supporting the proposed geologic association. <br><br>

TESTING DULUTH GABBRO ZIRCONS FOR A HAFNIUM ISOTOPIC STANDARD FOR LASER ABLATION MULTIPLE-COLLECTOR INDUCTIVELY COUPLED PLASMA MASS SPECTROMETRY
Vijay Vedvyas Rao
Nova High School, Davie, FL, USA

The fabrication of the Multiple Collector Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (MC-ICPMS) is one of the most recent achievements in the field of spectrometry. MC-ICPMS can be coupled with Laser Ablation (LA), enabling in-situ isotope measurements, which can result in inaccurate analysis if standards, equations that correct the miscalculations, are not used. The full potential of this method has not been reached yet, due to the lack of standards. In this experiment, an equation or standard for hafnium isotopic ratios found in zircons from Duluth gabbros is tested. <br><br> Zircon crystals, known do have high, homogenous amounts of hafnium, were obtained from Duluth gabbros using various separation techniques. The rocks were physically broken down using a jaw crusher, disc mill, and a water table. The rock sample was then separated by density, using heavy liquids, and magnetism, using a magnet and a magnetic separator. <br><br> The equation was tested for its accuracy in determining correct information by comparing hafnium isotopic ratios received from the LA-MC-ICPMS from a Duluth zircon sample after being corrected by the equation, to true values of the ratio. The equation was found to produce almost identical results as the true values, and therefore a standard for laser ablation of zircons found in Duluth gabbros is on its way to being forged.<br><br>

Complex influence of solar activity and weather on human's health - very popular theme for researches in the world. And there is still discussion on the exact causality between human behavior and climate change. <br><br>The main purpose of our research is studying the affects of space and earth weather on variations of some individual physiological parameters and psycho-emotional state of person. As the examinees were chosen the students, taking place on practice of the resort Kislovodsk (Caucasus) in 2003-2004.<br><br>The model of experiment was developed, the modern techniques were applied. During research a sufficient set of the essential environmental factors (including biorhythmological, ecological, meteorological and heliophysical information) and individual characteristics of the examinees were used for the first time. <br><br>The experimental estimation of degree of individual heliometeosensitivity has shown that young organism with expressed chronic diseases becomes more sensitive to variability of space and earth weather, thus course of “biological clocks” is disturbed. That’s why it is necessary, at an opportunity, to take into consideration individual features of organism in practical life for creation an optimum regimen for organism working and efficiency of the day to keep the health. <br><br>Knowing the information about possible adverse environmental conditions weak and sick people can beforehand accept medicines, not plan heavy loading and carry out the appropriate preventive and medical procedures. Obviously, that the duly information about solar activity and adverse types of weather, will help the people correctly to plan the life-cycle and activity without damage to health. <br><br>

HOW CARBON SOURCE AFFECTS THE PROCESS OF MICROBIAL SULFATE REDUCTION IN MINE TAILINGS
Sara Elizabeth Bogert
Juneau Douglas High School, Juneau, AK, USA

This project was designed to test the ability of three carbon sources to produce conditions suitable for Sulfur Reducing Bacteria (SRB) to inhabit. These bacteria are important because they can transform sulfate into hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide in the water will form strong bonds with dissolved metal molecules, and they will precipitate out of solution.<br><br>I hypothesized that molasses would have the highest degree of sulfate reduction, then spent brewery grain, and cardboard last.<br><br>Using a Winogradsky column set-up, twelve columns were made, three for each carbon source and a control. The columns were filled with mine tailings, the carbon source, pond scum (for bacteria), phosphate, and water. Water samples of 150mL were taken every other week through a valve assembly at the bottom of each column. This 150mL was sent through five tests: pH, ORP, alkalinity, hydrogen sulfide, and sulfate. Dissolved iron, lead, copper, and zinc were tested via an assay lab.<br><br>I do not believe any of these columns reached conditions suitable for the sulfate reduction process. Despite this, the brewery grain and molasses columns may be the closest to producing the right conditions to support SRBs.<br><br>The results of this project could be applied out at the Greens Creek Mine, where there is an issue with pyrite oxidation and the dissolved metal levels it causes in mine water. SRBs are one way to deal with this problem, so it is important to find a carbon source that is a good food supply for these bacteria.<br><br>

CHARACTERIZING MARTIAN SOIL ANALOGUES WITH OPTICAL MICROSCOPY
Paul Macdonald Magyar
Classical High School, Providence, RI, USA

Characterization of soil is an important part of any exploration of the Martian surface. By studying the shapes of small soil particles, it is possible to learn about the large-scale geologic processes to which they have been exposed. In this study, six samples of sand that represent various geologic processes of interest to the study of Mars were analyzed in two dimensions with an optical microscope and digital analysis software. The data collected from this study were used to differentiate riverine, desert, beach, and volcanic sand samples. The reliability of this method was demonstrated by the successful identification of an unknown sample as Algodones Dune sand and the characterization of a mixture. These two-dimensional analyses are intended to lay the foundations for three-dimensional characterization of soil with pseudoconfocal microscopy for a potential in-situ microscope for the exploration of Mars.

INVESIGATIONS OF OXIDE-REDUCTION DURING LIGHTNING-INDUCED FULGURITE FORMATION
Britta Elyse Jones
Eastside High School, Gainesville, FL, USA

In the journal Science, Essene and Fisher reported the reduction of SiO2 during the formation of a large natural fulgurite formed near a tree root. Since oxide reduction is almost never observed to occur in nature, this study sought to further investigate the mechanisms behind oxide reduction. A series of experiments were conducted on both natural and induced fulgurites. In order to rapidly assess whether oxide reduction occurred, a new method of characterizing fulgurite reduction was developed. The fulgurites were placed in beakers containing 49% HF overnight. Control studies showed that while the HF dissolves most oxides it does not dissolve the reduced metals. Upon soaking in HF, a study of eight pure SiO2 fulgurites showed that no silicon was formed. This is consistent with Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis and conductivity measurements showing only SiO2 and a very low conductivity. These results show that during fulgurite formation, reduction of SiO2 without carbon present (e.g. a tree root) is very rare. Studies were also conducted on two induced fulgurites composed of mixtures of SiO2 and ZrO2. A portion of the two mixed fulgurites remained after HF treatment. Analysis by a number of methods including TEM and X-ray diffraction, indicated the material is ZrO2 which implies that ZrO2 does not undergo reduction during fulgurite formation. Additional oxide fulgurites were fabricated and investigated. The results from all of these experiments suggest that oxide reduction during fulgurite formation can be predicted by the thermodynamic stability of the oxide as described by the Ellingham diagram.

WIND - RENEWABLE ALTERNATIVE ENERGY- IT' S ABOUT TIME!
Kasey Blythe Painter
Enid High School, Enid, Oklahoma, USA

<br><br> The working hypothesis is the optimal time of year for renewable wind energy to be generated in each of the nine climate divisions of Oklahoma will occur during the spring at midnight.<br><br> The data used are 10-meter wind speeds, every 15 minutes, in 2004 from Mesonet sites in the nine climate divisions.<br><br> The procedures are as follows: (1) obtained monthly average wind speed for every 15-minute during the day for each month during 2004 for Bessie, Breckenridge, Eufaula, Goodwell, Idabel, Mangum, Pryor,Shawnee, and Tishomingo; (2) plotted the mean wind speeds for every 15 minutes for all 12 months; (3) located the peak wind speed value and its time; and (4) found the mean peak wind speeds for each season.<br><br> My results show the mean maximum wind speeds for Oklahoma's nine <br><br>climate regions occurred in the daytime hour only. After the sun comes up, the wind speed increases steadily until it reaches its maximum; after the peak, the wind speed slowly decreases. The highest mean wind speeds were during spring for all climate divisions. The Bessie site had the highest mean wind speeds, while the lowest mean wind speeds were at Idabel, making it the site with the least available wind energy.<br><br> My working hypothesis is partially accepted. The spring was the optimal time of year for renewable wind energy to be generated in all climate divisions of Oklahoma. However, the optimal time did not occur at midnight.

THE CONNECTION BETWEEN SOLAR VARIABILITY AND ANNULAR MODES
Thomas Franklin Christian III
Houston County High School, Warner Robins Georgia, United States

The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is the primary mode of winter weather variability in the Northern Hemisphere troposphere. The NAO is the near surface manifestation of the Northern Hemisphere Annular Mode (NAM), which extends from the Earth’s surface upward into the middle stratosphere. This project examines the linkages between solar variability and the NAM. Previous year’s research used observational data to establish a statistical linkage between the solar cycle and the NAM. Specifically, solar maximum is associated with strengthened westerly winds and an enhanced North/South temperature gradient (corresponding to the positive phase of the NAM). The current research makes use of a global climate model to study the underlying physical nature of the response to solar variability. Perpetual January integrations of Version 3.0 of the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Atmospheric Model (CAM) were performed. A control experiment forced by 1997 background (solar minimum) conditions is contrasted with three parallel experiments in which specified increases in ultraviolet radiation and/or stratospheric ozone concentration are imposed. Differences among the experiments are used to identify solar cycle induced atmospheric anomaly structures in the stratosphere and troposphere. The model results verify the ability of the solar cycle to induce NAM structures that extend from stratospheric altitudes to the lower troposphere. In particular, the results confirm the previously developed theoretical ideas regarding the physical linkage between solar variability and the NAM. Although ultraviolet and ozone changes are each separately able to induce NAM patterns, their combined effect provides a greater atmospheric response.

MINING THE PAST: GEOCHEMICAL ANALYSES OF FOSSIL TEETH & SEDIMENT ILLUMINATE ANCIENT ENVIRONMENTS
Yingqiuqi Chelsea Lei
Robert F. Kennedy HS, Flushing, NY, USA

Geochemical analyses on 1560 fossil teeth and sediment samples from 57 archaeological sites using neutron activation analyses (NAA) revealed paleoenvironmental conditions during tooth fossilization. Mn-U correlations and Fe concentrations can be used to assess paleo- environmental pH and redox conditions.<br><br> Mn plotted against U concentrations showed strong positive correlations in enamel and dentine at four sites, namely Tsaga'agn Agui (a cave), Mongolia, Engineer's Creek (a peat bog), Alaska, Erd (an open air site on a carbonate terrace), Hungary, and Umm Qatafa (an open air site in an alluvial setting), Israel, indicating reducing conditions for all these teeth. A non-radioactive element, Mn may prove to be a suitable proxy for U uptake studies. <br><br> In teeth, Fe concentrations are controlled mainly by pH. At Engineer Creek, Alaska, Fe concentrations in teeth are high, indicating that acidic conditions predominated throughout the teeth burial history. At Umm Qatafa, Israel, Fe concentrations in the teeth are low, indicating alkaline conditions, while high U in some enamels samples indicate hypersaline conditions.<br><br> At Tsaga’an Agui, Mongolia, ironstone abounds in the sediment. No detectable Fe occurred in the enamel, however, indicating alkaline sedimentary water conditions, which prevented Fe diffusion into the teeth. The ironstone formed under oxidizing conditions when the Gobi was lush. As the climate became arid, the cave’s sediment water grew saline and reducing, while Mn and U coprecipitated in teeth. Gypsum, which occurs abundantly in the cave's upper layers, indicates that the cave continued to dry out.<br><br> At 13 sites, Fe and La strongly correlate with Sc in the sediment but not in teeth, suggesting different mechanisms for their absorption into hydroxyapatite.

BREAKING STRENGTH AND POROSITY OF PREHISTORIC CERAMIC REPRODUCTIONS: ASSESSING VARIATION IN CLAY SOURCES AND TEMPERING MATERIALS PHASE 5
Amy Elizabeth Marquardt
Mediapolis High School, Mediapolis, IA, USA

This experiment was designed to test the effects of temper on breaking strength, porosity, microscopic analysis of Native American ceramics. Temper is the material that is added to the clay that makes the ceramic. It was hypothesized that the clamshell, grass and non-tempered samples and natural clays would be the strongest. The clamshell, limestone and grass tempered samples would be most porous. The non-tempered samples would be the least porous.<br><br><br>Six tempers, clamshell, grass, grit (broken rock), grog (broken pottery), limestone and sand, and four clays were used to make 1,008 samples. The control consisted of samples made from each clay type without the addition of temper. To test for breaking strength, a 4-point breaking strength test machine was used. To test for porosity, samples were dehydrated then submerged in boiling water. Analysis of microscopic compounds was done using Raman Spectroscopy.<br><br><br>The results showed the tempers did affect the strength and porosity of the clay but there were no visible trends. The organic and porous tempers increased the porosity and the less porous tempers decreased porosity. Sand tempered samples were found to be the strongest and least porous.<br><br><br>It was concluded that temper is not chosen strictly for its strength or porosity. Other factors could have influenced temper selection. The breaking strength and porosity are complex functions of clay and temper<br><br>

GLOBAL WARMING: THE EFFECTS OF INCREASED TEMPERATURE AND CARBON DIOXIDE
Ryan Reynolds Neely
North Carolina School of Science and Math, Durham, NC, USA

Global temperatures have been increasing since the 1880’s. It is also recorded that the concentration of carbon dioxide has been increasing since 1850. What effect do these changes have on our planet? Will the environment be able to absorb the increased amount of carbon dioxide? Is the increase in temperature part of a natural cycle or is it due to unnatural forcing? This study hypothesizes that trees are not be able to absorb the increased levels of carbon dioxide. We also hypothesize that the increase of carbon dioxide is responsible for global glacial recession rather than increases in temperature. To look at the effects of increased carbon dioxide on trees, we studied pine trees grown for ten years at a Free Air Carbon Enrichment (FACE) facility. We found that long-term exposure to increased carbon dioxide caused the trees to reduce their uptake of carbon in a phenomenon called “down regulation”. We next conducted a global survey of glaciers using satellite and historical imagery. Using image processing software we calibrated each image and measured the trends of specific glaciers. These trends were then compared to global temperature and carbon dioxide records. It was found that glacial trends show signs of decrease before a change in the temperature record. Thus, the data support the hypothesizes. It was found that trees exposed to increased carbon dioxide for long durations will not be able to absorb the increased amount of carbon and the increase in carbon is responsible for the recession of glaciers.

GLOBAL WARMING: ANALYSIS AND MODELING OF BIRD MIGRATORY PATTERNS AS A PREDICTIVE TOOL
Nina Ellen Lintermans
Staples High School, Westport, CT, USA

Global warming is a major contributor to environmental changes. Scientists suggest that if the level of carbon dioxide continues to increase, ecosystems throughout the world will change dramatically due to temperature increases. Because bird migration is very sensitive to ambient temperatures, its use as a tool to monitor global warming is assessed. This project tries to determine how bird migratory patterns are changing and attempts to relate those changes to fluctuations in ambient temperatures. The study used available bird call spectral analysis software that detects bird calls at nighttime during migration season. Compared to bird banding, which is a method of determining migratory patterns by catching birds, the method using the nocturnal bird call microphone is more time-efficient. Most importantly, a statistical model has been created using both historical bird banding data and recently obtained nocturnal bird call data. This model indicates a relationship between the onset of bird migration and surface temperature from 1984-2004. Using the mathematical model, it can be concluded that bird migratory patterns can be used to determine if trends in global warming are present.

THE AMOUNT OF PARTICULATE MATTER OF IRON CREEK IN THE SWEET GRASS HILLS TO DETERMINE EROSION
Meghan Combs
Joplin-Inverness Public Schools, Joplin, Montana, United States

An experiment to study the amount of particulate matter was conducted in which water samples were taken from Iron Creek in the Sweet Grass Hills to determine erosion of the stream and surrounding areas. The water temperature, speed, pH, and degree of bank slope were measured at each site. This experiment was conducted by using a Vernier Colorimeter, set on a blue wavelength, to measure the percent of absorbance of different samples and then correlate the larger amount of absorbance to higher amount of particulate. A CBL 2 probe provided a digital read out of the figures every second for approximately one minute. The data points were then averaged and plotted against a control group in graphs. (Graph 1, 2, 3, and 4) The average amount of particulate matter found for each site was compared against the water temperature, speed, pH, and degree of bank slope. A t-test was performed to show statistical significant for each site. All site information was found to be statistically significant on a 95 % or better level of significance. Site one’s particulate matter steadily increased. It was found that site two contained the highest amount of particulate matter. Site three’s particulate matter dropped and then climbed while site four had the least amount particulate. Thus, it can be concluded that site two has the largest amount of erosion taking place in its bank, bed, and surrounding area.

COMPARISON OF GROWTH RATE BETWEEN MODERN CORALS AND FOSSIL CORALS OF THE SPECIES MONTASTREA FAVEOLATA AND SIDERASTREA SIDEREA
Andreica Maldonado
Inés María Mendoza High School, Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico

<br><br> In this project the investigator measured the growth rates of coral fossils in Dominican Republic and compared them with the growth rates of young corals in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico. This information is of great importance to provide data to other investigations concerning corals. The species selected were Montastrea faveolata and Siderastrea siderea. Coral fossils from the Dominican Republic and the modern corals from Mayagüez, Puerto Rico were provided by the advisor.<br><br> A Covington Redland Cal equipment from the Geology Sedimentation Laboratory was used to cut the coral fossils. Then X-rays were taken by a radiologist. The X-rays were photocopied by a scanner and recorded in a computer. The growth rates were measured by using the Coral XDS program. Results obtained for the different growth rates in the coral fossils was an average of 1.6703 cm. annually for the Montastrea faveolata and 1.5831 cm. for the Siderastrea siderea species.<br><br> These results were compared to the growth rates of the modern corals of Mayagüez, Puerto Rico previously studied. The averages for the modern corals was 0.16 cm for the Montastrea faveolata and 0.26 cm for the Siderastrea siderea species. This evidence shows that the coral fossils of Enriquillo Valley in the Dominican Republic have a higher growth rate than those located in the area of Mayagüez, Puerto Rico.<br><br>

THE DERIVATION AND INTERPRETATION OF GEOCHEMICAL RATIOS GENERATED BY METEORITIC IMPACT
Terik Daly
Oak Grove High School, San Jose California, United States of America

Much has been done to determine the effects of shock metamorphism on the mineralogical structure of target material, but little has been done to document the effects of shock metamorphism on the chemical composition of the target material.<br><br> In this study, granite from the Silver Plume batholith was subjected to hypervelocity impact, which was induced by a two-stage light gas gun, using an aluminum projectile. X-Ray Fluorescence and Inductive Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry analyses were used to document the chemical composition of the target material before and after the exposure of target material to impact.<br><br> Depletion and enrichment were noted as occurring on an elemental basis, as well as determining enrichment and depletion trends throughout entire affinities and groupings of elements as defined by V.M. Goldschmidt. Statistical analysis of the data shows relative homogeneity of the sample material and is useful in determining trends in enrichment and depletion.<br><br> Data shows that enrichment is characteristic of the chalcophile elements (according to terrestrial affinity) and siderophile elements (as defined by meteoritic affinity). Ni, Cu, Ga, Pb, and Zn were each enriched in a consistent, significantly significant manner. Other elements were affected significantly, but in an inconsistent manner. Thin section analysis shows that a high silica polymorph formed, meaning that pressures of at least 170 GPa were reached, with temperatures near 1000 degrees C.<br><br> Impact-induced shock metamorphism has a distinct and significant effect on the trace chemical composition of granite specimens. Trends of enrichment were seen in the chalcophile/siderophile affinity.<br><br>

FRICTION LIMITED LANDSLIDE MODEL: AN ANALYSIS OF HISTORIC LANDSLIDES IN THE CENTRAL IDAHO BATHOLITH
Paul Jaewook Park
Massapequa High School, Massapequa N.Y., U.S.A.

In 1993, a major fire destroyed approximately 300,000 acres of the Payette National Forest. This region supports sensitive animal and fish habitats. The loss of trees due to the fire decreases tree root strength, leaving the mountain slopes more susceptible to landslides. This study analyzes overall slope stability of the region in order to understand the possible effects of fire on slope stability which threatens nearby stream habitats. Landslide survey data of several historic landslides is interpolated over the extent of the slide scarp. A finite element analysis is performed where the landslide is treated as columns of soil. A best-fit plane is created using the scarp data to determine the slope and the slope direction of each column. The effective internal angle of friction, soil unit weight, and other constants pertaining to the soil were found from soil samples taken from the region. Factor of safety is considered for each individual column along with the forces of friction between adjacent columns. Factor of safety is affected by the interaction of the columns and the friction between them, water content, tree root strength, debris, and soil composition. The force components for each column are translated down the slope. Critical factor of safety thresholds are identified based on water content and element analysis.

PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITY RESPONSE TO NUTRIENT ENRICHMENT
Nicholas Robert Apau Jachowski
West Potomac High School, Alexandria, Virginia, USA

More than half of Earth’s atmospheric oxygen is thought to come from photosynthesis by phytoplankton. Additionally, photosynthesis by phytoplankton represents the primary sink for carbon dioxide. Yet the ways in which phytoplankton function in the ocean are poorly understood. Recent research suggests that major oceanic oxygen-producing, carbon-consuming events are aperiodic and occur at random and localized places. One possible explanation for these events is phytoplankton blooms. This research determines whether upwelling of deep seawater can cause a phytoplankton bloom, providing a clue to the mechanisms responsible for oxygen-producing, carbon-consuming events. By mixing together different ratios of deep seawater and mixed-layer seawater, and measuring chlorophyll, pH, and alkalinity, this research showed that the threshold of deep seawater for causing a bloom in mixed-layer seawater is less than 5%, and small-scale simulated upwelling events are reproducible and not affected by scaling. It was also shown that primary production, the production of biomass by phytoplankton, can be estimated from measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon, a faster and less expensive measurement than the carbon-14 and dissolved oxygen methods conventionally used to measure primary productivity. Finally, it was discovered that commonly used Corning polyethylene tubes leach acid into samples and should not be used in phytoplankton incubation experiments. These mixing experiments were the first step toward possible large-scale human-initiated upwelling events in the ocean to create phytoplankton blooms, which could help to compensate for increasing deforestation and carbon dioxide emissions and thereby help to moderate mankind’s effect on the atmosphere and contribution to climate change.

MEASURING RESISTIVITY USING SUBSURFACE FEATURES TO FIND A THRUST FAULT
Hannah Louise Wolf
Parkland High School, Allentown, PA 18104

Resistance is the measure of the difficulty with which an electrical current passes through a material. Resistivity, an inherent property of earth materials, can be calculated from resistance measurements and used to identify subsurface materials. Using the "Geologic Map of the Topton Quadrangle" as a guide, the location of a thrust fault in Berks County, PA, was predicted. The purpose of this project was to pinpoint the location of the thrust fault and create a cross-section of the study area by analyzing resistance values acquired from a Resistivity Meter. Along an established line perpendicular to the assumed fault location, four copper electrodes were inserted into the ground at nine linear stations, forming a Wenner electrode configuration. Electrons were transferred through the ground between the probes. The current was recorded for each probe spacing and Ohm's Law was used to calculate resistance. Resistivity was derived from the formula, 2*pi*ProbeSpacing*Resistance, by compensating for the arced pattern of electricity flow between the electrodes. Resistivity values were graphed as elevation versus distance from station 1. At each station, similar resistivity values were grouped together and assigned a color. Each colored group of values represents a subsurface material. The resulting graph is a cross-section of the surveyed area. From this, the dip of the contact between the Martinsburg Shale and the Jacksonburg Limestone does not indicate a classic thrust fault as indicated on the geologic map, but may reflect a more complicated deformation history.

ALLUVIAL FAN EVOLUTION OF THE SANDIA MOUNTAINS USING STARLOGO SIMULATION: PHASE III
Nicole Ann Lopez
Rio Rancho High School, Rio Rancho, New Mexico, USA 

<br><br><br><br> The erosion patterns of the Sandia Mountains were the main focus of this multiphase experimental project. In the first two phases, erosion patterns on the actual photographs of the Sandia Mountains and on the StarLogo simulation outputs were analyzed by using the Fibonacci sequence. It was realized that using the Fibonacci sequence was not an effective method. Therefore, the method of evaluating triangular shaped patterns in the runoff was initiated in phase three. The intent of phase three was to validate the hypothesis: if vegetation is created in the StarLogo simulation then runoff patterns on a sixty-degree and forty-five degree slope would differ from the runoff patterns on the same slopes without vegetation. The procedure was to modify the StarLogo code by adding random vegetation and runoff patterns were traced for nine outputs. On the traced runoff, triangles were traced out. Then the average height, base and area were calculated for these triangles. This process was repeated for the phase two outputs. It was determined that vegetation was an important factor in the runoff patterns due to the fact that the runoff was more evenly distributed than the runoff patterns without vegetation. The average base and height of the triangles with vegetation had a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.883, and without vegetation the correlation was 0.669, which showed a strong relationship between the height and base in the triangles. This project could be used as a stepping-stone to simulate complex erosion models dealing with impact angles and soil types.

THE CHANGES IN GEOGRAPHY FROM THE VIEW OF ANTIQUE MAPS
Michaela Konradova, Marketa Hornakova
Grammar School, Nymburk, Czech Republic

New methods of antique maps research are becoming a popular part of modern geography. The goal of this project is to present a new research that will contribute to general understanding of our history. The reason for doing this project were missing information about the central Elbe valley region.<br><br> We were the first, who examined the area of the central Elbe valley region according to the antique maps and we followed the changes of this area. We examined the technical skills that were used to create the maps, also the political contexts and purposes that put them to use. We found many mistakes in position and altitude of places and in terminology. Our scientific work has created a basis, which could be used for further researches.<br><br> Owing to critical analysis of antique maps, we proved that the main factors are a map scale and the purpose of a map. These two factors determine whether the objects of a landscape appear on the maps or not. In maps we discovered extinct towns, ponds and we also found the changes in territorial borders.<br><br> Thanks to the new methods and old maps digitalization we help to advertise and give publicity to our local region. This project serves also as a guide for the exhibition of antique maps. We expect this work will provide a benchmark for future scholarship on antique maps.

THE LIKELIHOOD OF EXOTIC EARTHWORM INVASIONS ON FOREST ECOSYSTEMS DUE TO LEAF PACT TYPE PHASE-III
Jillian Rita Beaufeaux, Kirsti Anna Hakala
Cloquet Senior High, Cloquet Minnesota, USA

It has been found that exotic earthworms affect nutrient cycling in northern Minnesota hardwood forests (Hale, 2004). Earthworms increase soil bulk density and alter the nutrient content of native soils (Beaufeaux, 2004). These negative impacts lead to the questions, what effect does leaf pact type have on the likelihood of exotic earthworm invasions in different forest ecosystems, and how does leaf type affect the rate of litter removal by Lumbricus terrestris and what affect will this ecological disturbance have on soil pH and worm biomass? The hypothesis is that leaf type will affect the likelihood of earthworm invasions, soil pH, and the rate of litter removal. Thirty-six, two liter bottles were used to simulate the soil horizon and understory layer of four different northern Minnesota forests (maple, oak, pine, and mixed litter). One Lumbricus terrestris was added to each container; nine containers were used to simulate each forest type. Every three weeks one set of three containers were torn down. The original hypothesis was supported after week three; there was an overall effect on leaf pact removal. Overall change in pH because of earthworm and microbial digestion was significantly different between all leaf types using an (ANOVA). It appears that maple hardwood forests will be affected by exotic earthworm invasions at a greater rate than oak or pine forests. As exotic earthworm species increase nutrient cycling succession of forests from maple to oak to pine may be increased along with the loss of forest understory.

THE EFFECT ON GREENHOUSE GAS LEVELS BY THE MODIFICATION OF PHOTOSYNTHETIC ORGANISMS
Rachel Leigh Preston, Thomas Meyer, Elizabeth Roberts
Keystone School, San Antonio TX, U.S.A.

Greenhouse gases (GHG) such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) are released daily into the atmosphere. According to the United Nations, 33 billion tonnes of CO2 was released throughout the world in 2000. This level should increase 2% annually until 2010. These GHG have been proven to cause global warming. Although terrestrial autotrophic organisms also help remove these gases, marine photosynthetic organisms have a greater biomass and thus utilize more GHG. The purpose of this project was to determine whether increased levels of iron and phosphate in seawater augment the algal uptake of CO2 and CH4 under amplified greenhouse gas conditions. Five types of algae were grown in three different atmospheres where ambient air was supplemented to the following levels: (1) CH4 at 4.5 parts per million (ppm), (2) CH4 at 7.98 ppm, and (3) CO2 at 1031 ppm. The final measurements indicated the algae growing in phosphate solutions, regardless of gas type, grew most. The next highest data points, which coincide, contained media infused with iron solutions; the ambient air environment without medium additives fell among these points. The lowest three points corresponded to conditions containing no additives, suggesting that phosphates will cause algal blooms under amplified greenhouse conditions; iron will act as a dynamic fertilizer, boosting algal growth to a non-blooming point, unless in the presence of high levels of CO2, and that algae may use both CO2 and CH4 as carbon sources.

VORTEX SHEDDING-A POSSIBLE DRIVING FORCE FOR EL NINO?!
Yu Chun Yeh, Yen Chun Lin
Kaohsiung Municipal Girls' Senior High School, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, R.O.C.

When steady water flows through a tunnel, some periodic vortex will occur. According to our experiment, the vortex shedding drags water from the area as it just went by, and thus immediately changes the physical conditions of water. The phenomenon is also found when Antarctic Circumpolar Current flows through the narrow Drake Passage. In this study, we analyzed the satellite data of sea water along western and eastern coast of South America. The results indicated that during each period before El Nino, the physical conditions of sea water change in a regular cycle. The cycle lasts approximately for 2 years, which is the same as the vortex shedding period derived from Strauhal number formula. At the end of each cycle, Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) of Pacific Ocean changes from a positive value into a negative one. When there is less warm water near Equator flowing south along eastern coast of South America, the SOI would become minus one or below, and thus El nino may occur.

STORM WARNING: IS THERE A PREDICTABLE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE NORTH ATLANTIC OSCILLATION AND TROPICAL CYCLONE ACTIVITY?
John Christopher Turner
Lincoln High School, Tallahassee, Florida, United States of America

The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) has been credited for affecting several meteorological patterns, including winter storms in North America and Europe. However, research into its influence on tropical weather phenomena, namely tropical cyclones, has been preliminary. This study was designed to determine whether or not the NAO could accurately be used by forecasters in predicting long term tropical cyclone activity through analyzing the existence of multi-decadal sequences.<br><br> To discern a correlation between the NAO and tropical cyclone activity, monthly tabulated NAO indices, from 1950-2005, were combined into annual hurricane season and spring season averages. In addition, data on tropical cyclone intensity, frequency, origin, and landfall was compiled for the identical time period. After examining this information, further data on tropical cyclone landfalls from 1900-1949 was collected to explore potential long term NAO cycles in relation to storm activity.<br><br> In conclusion, a definite correlation between the NAO and tropical cyclone activity was identified. During periods of relatively high NAO indices, there were fewer and weaker storms. This was likely caused by the effects of a positive NAO, which can produce cooler tropical sea temperatures, strong upper level wind sheer, southerly high pressure systems, and dry air masses. All of these effects can be detrimental to the development of hurricanes. Conversely, a negative NAO causes warmer sea temperatures and weak upper level wind sheer, which leads to seasons with more storms and stronger hurricanes. Therefore, it is possible that more precise climate prediction models could be produced by forecasters using this information.<br><br>

IS SOIL POROSITY USEFUL IN MEASURING FLOODING POTENTIAL?
Kayla E. Potter
Union-Scioto High School, Chillicothe, OH, Ross

Urban planning in Ohio involves consideration of building sites within river floodplains. Flooding is a common occurrence in the Ross County Scioto River Valley. Prediction of flood prone areas would aid in identifying places to restrict building. Ten main types of soils occur in Ross County. Water retention can be tested through measurement of soil porosity. This project investigates soil porosity as a factor in flooding patterns. Areas of lower soil porosities are more prone to flood because of reduced water retention capacity. Do soils in floodplains have lower porosities than those not in floodplains?<br><br> Soil Porosity is calculated as Porosity = 1 – bulk density/particle density. Bulk density is mass of soil /volume of soil particles plus voids. Particle density is mass of soil/volume of soil particles. Therefore, Porosity = volume of voids /volume of soil particles and voids. The paraffin-coated clod method determines volume of soil particles and voids and derives the volume of voids. <br><br> Samples of the main soil types, as identified by a soil map of Ross County, were collected in a manner where the clods, or peds, were preserved intact from the A-horizon. General thicknesses of each A-horizon were taken from descriptions of each soil type. From the soil map, the extent of areas covered by each soil type was calculated and then water capacity of the A-horizon for each soil type was used to derive water retention capacity for the floodplain vs. non-floodplain areas of Ross County. This method is a simple way to ascertain flood potentials of areas of different soil types. <br><br> <br><br>

BREAKTHROUGH SUBSTITUTIONS OF SYNTHETIC POLYMERS WITH NATURAL CHITOSAN FOR THE PREVENTION OF SOIL EROSION
Dhanur Damodar
Dupont Manual Magnet High School, Louisville, Ky, United States

Polyacrylamide(PAM) is an effective synthetic soil binder. PAM, currently regulated by the EPA, degrades to monomers with potentially harmful environmental effects. The purpose of this project was to find a safe and cost effective natural binder to substitute PAM. <br><br>The hypotheses of the project were that chitosan extracted from chitin, (which makes up the shells of Crustaceans) was 1) more effective in performance and 2) more cost effective than PAM. If the above hypotheses were supported, an environmental waste would become a benefit, because millions of pounds of shells are thrown away each year. <br><br>Chitosan is available commercially for medicinal applications, but at high costs. A breakthrough low cost extraction process for chitosan was developed by many experimental trials. Overall, a 27% yield of chitosan was obtained versus 22% in other processes researched. In the settling tank tests, which measure binding ability at different time intervals in mL/L of settled volume, chitosan was statistically identical to PAM based on a two-sample T-test. Chitosan outperformed PAM in tensile strength tests, in which chitosan mats withstood approximately 15% more force in Newtons/gram than PAM mats. It also surpassed PAM in the water dispersion tests, which tested the ability of mats to withstand rain. Chitosan extracted through the process developed is $0.86/lb versus $3-5/lb for PAM.<br><br>Based on the statistics and cost effectiveness, the hypotheses were fully supported. Further studies indicated that ground shells without further processing have applicability as binders. At $0.16/lb, this could be a low cost breakthrough for soil erosion control.

The El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has been identified as a major influence on tropical cyclone activity in the North Atlantic. Wind shear and thermal convective stability have been individually cited as the primary mechanism by which ENSO influences tropical cyclone activity. This study examines both pathways by tracing the physical processes that link an anomalous El Nino event to dampened tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic. The analyses show that wind shear and thermal convective stability are both reasonably and significantly correlated to ENSO and tropical cyclone activity. Based on this result, it is theorized that the processes are associated by an ENSO-induced tropospheric thermal wind. The thermal wind is the vertical shear resulting from a horizontal temperature gradient in the troposphere. Theoretically, ENSO produces a horizontal gradient of tropospheric temperature over the tropical North Atlantic, which bolsters vertical wind shear that carries anomalously warm tropospheric temperatures farther East. It is shown through statistical analysis that both mechanisms reinforce each other and collectively dampen tropical cyclone activity.

PLEISTOCENE DEBRIS FLOW DEPOSITION INTO AN ACTIVE GRABEN NEAR EMERY, UTAH
Nicole Marie Hovat
Carbon High School, Price, Utah, United States of America

Pleistocene debris flow deposits were laid down on pediment surfaces in the Emery, Utah area to form gravel and boulder caps on area mesas and plateaus. Fault movement also occurred along several fault zones in the area. One major fault zone in the area is the Joe's Valley Graben. Near Emery, a zone of +100 feet debris flow deposits occurs within the Joe's Valley Graben. It is not a normal occurrence in the area for debris flow thicknesses to vary a lot. Mapping of faults and debris flow thickness indicates debris flow outside the graben ranges from 10-25 feet. Debris flow deposits in the graben exceed 100 feet. Based on the extreme variation in debris flow thickness relative to fault location, it appears that debris flows happened during graben and fault movement. After debris flow deposition took place, Link Canyon was formed in the debris flow material.

WHY DID THE LEVEES BREAK? NEW ORLEANS AND ITS SOIL.
Austin Alexander James Toner
T.C. Williams High School, Alexandria, Virginia, United States of America

This experiment was conducted to test the idea that the breaching of the New Orleans levees during Hurricane Katrina, specifically at the 17th Street Canal, was due to poor conditions of the underlying soil, primarily peat layers. The hypothesis was that as the organic content and grain size of an underlying variable soil layer increased, its porosity would increase and its relative structural integrity would decrease due to a greater pressure exerted on the individual grains of the soil by percolating water within the increased pore space. Six scale (1/60) models of the 17th Street soil horizons were created in fish tanks using a layer of peat as a control and variable layers of coarse sand, medium sand, fine sand, silt, and clay that had been dried, sifted, and classified by grain size. High water conditions were then replicated on one side of the model. Saturation, penetration, minor flooding, and major flooding times were recorded within each model during two trials. During the first conducted trial, for example, the levees with the peat and coarse sand flooded simultaneously but collapsed within 3 and 9 hours, respectively. Medium sand fully flooded at 11 hours, fine sand at 24 hours but did not collapse. Silt and clay only partially flooded at 18 and 48 hours, respectively. Both trials demonstrated that of all the soils tested, the underlying peat layer was the most detrimental to structural integrity in the least amount of time while clay exhibited the greatest structural integrity. <br><br> <br><br>

CAN WE PREDICT THE NEXT KATRINA? A STUDY OF THE CORRELATION BETWEEN HURRICANE INTENSITY AND ANTARCTIC OZONE LEVEL
Michael Lee Tucker
University of Missouri High School; Columbia, MO; USA

Studies by NASA show that as hurricanes strengthen, the ozone surrounding the hurricane becomes less dense. This led to the question; is there a connection between hurricane intensity and levels of the ozone? Since matter cannot be created or destroyed that further lead to the question; where was the ozone going?<br><br> The hypothesis was that as hurricanes intensify ozone levels in the Antarctic would increase.<br><br> The hypothesis was tested by six months of research, during the entire 2005 hurricane season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Aeronautical and Space Administration were used as sources to obtain information. Information collected included weekly readings of Antarctic ozone levels and daily recordings of hurricane activity in the Atlantic.<br><br> Analysis of the data showed that as hurricanes intensify, the ozone levels in the Antarctic do not rise, but in fact, drop. Data also indicated that more intense hurricanes create larger and quicker drops in Antarctic ozone levels. The data also indicated that as the rate of storm development increased, the rate of ozone level decay also increased.<br><br> Through the analysis of the data, the hypothesis was rejected. However, the data does indicate that there is a strong connection between hurricane intensity and Antarctic ozone levels. More importantly the fact that the rate of hurricane development and the rate of Antarctic ozone decay are strongly related requires further investigation.

THE EFFECTS OF OLI AND GAS DEVELOPMENT ON FLOODPLAINS, NORTHWEST NEW MEXICO
Shandiin Chanel Copeland
Kirtland Central High School, Kirtland, New Mexico, USA

In northwest New Mexico tens of thousands of oil and gas wells have been drilled to tap this vital energy source. Recent proposals to further develop these resources have raised concerns about the potential effect to watersheds. A watershed's hydrologic characteristics are altered as development occurs within its boundaries. The watersheds analyzed by this project are located in the northeast corner of the San Juan Basin, an area rich in oil and natural gas resources and heavily developed.<br><br> The hypothesis is that large-scale earth disturbance from gas field development and the exposure of thousands of acres of bare ground has resulted in accelerated storm water surface run-off causing an expansion of floodplains. Significant differences will be observed between pre-development and post development floodplain channels. Approximately 70 years of existing historical aerial photographs of five watersheds were analyzed and compared to test the hypothesis. <br><br> The hypothesis that floodplains would be shown to be larger as a result of increased storm water run-off from oil and gas development was not supported by the data. In fact there appears to be an inverse relationship between the amount of oil and gas related watershed disturbance and active floodplain size. Those floodplains where size has decreased have the greatest amount of gas field disturbance. Where floodplain size has stayed relatively constant the disturbance from gas field development is less. No examples of increasing floodplain size were discovered<br><br>

IMPACT OF EMERGING ARCTIC GROUND COVER UPON ALBEDO AND THE ACCELERATION OF GLOBAL WARMING
Krista BreAnn Pfeifer
Latta High School, Ada, OK, USA

Scientists have cited 2005 as the warmest year on record over the past 100 years. Global warming is a critical issue confronting Earth’s inhabitants. The purpose of this experiment was to examine how the density of emerging arctic ground cover affects albedo and subsurface ice temperatures. It was hypothesized that as ground cover becomes denser an increasing reduction in albedo will occur due to ground cover absorption of light, thus less light will be reflected. It was further hypothesized that internal ice temperatures will raise rapidly with increasing ground cover densities since light absorption by plant materials result in greater heat absorption.<br><br> To simulate arctic conditions, ice was shaved, packed into Styrofoam containers, and placed into freezers until temperatures of -13º C were reached. Wooden sticks inserted into the ice simulated emerging plant material at 2.5%, 5%, and 10% of the ice’s surface area. The ice container was placed under a strong light. Albedo was measured using light intensity probes by dividing the amount of reflected light by the incoming light. Subsurface ice temperatures were measured with temperature probes at 5 minute intervals until the ice reached 0º C.<br><br> As hypothesized, increased ground cover density caused more rapid ice warming as well as significant albedo reduction. The 10% ground cover produced 39.5% faster warming rate and 14.5% albedo compared to the control’s albedo of 23.2%. These results affirm that global warming produces larger amounts of emerging ground covers which in turn causes greater heat absorption on Earth.<br><br>

MEASURING LONG TERM TRENDS IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY DELTA USING SATELLITE IMAGERY
Mina Renee Bionta
Livermore High School, Livermore CA, USA

Some Scientists hypothesize that the decline in species in the San Francisco Bay Delta is due to diminishing water levels from siphoning of water down to the South. <br><br> In this research, I used Landsat Satellite data to measure the open water area in the Delta region from 1999 through 2004 to see if the water levels are diminishing as suggested. Using the difference in albedo between land and water, I separated the areas covered by water from the areas of dry land and plotted a time history of open water area in the Delta. This method gives a more accurate measurement of the total area than can be derived from estimates based on measurements at just a few locations.<br><br> Yearly periodic fluctuations of the open water area in the Delta are apparent in my data. I compared my measurements with river stage data and precipitation. The water area in the Delta increases temporarily during the rainy season then quickly falls. Unlike rainfall rates, which decrease in the summer, the Delta water area actually peaks in the summer and is more similar in shape to the data on the stage of the Sacramento River at Antioch. <br><br> As far as long term changes over the course of the five years this research studied, open water area in the Delta region remained the same. In addition, the observed yearly high and low levels have also remained nearly unchanged. There must be another explanation for a decrease in species other than decreasing water levels.<br><br>

AN ESTIMATION OF HEAVY METAL CONTAMINATION IN SOIL USING REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY AND PARTIAL LEAST SQUARES REGRESSION
Caaminee Mayank Pandit
Noblesville High School, Noblesville, IN, USA

Lead (Pb) poisoning from anthropogenic sources continues to threaten the health of urban children. Mapping Pb distribution on a large scale is imperative to identify hotspots and reduce Pb poisoning. To assess the feasibility of using reflectance spectroscopy to map soil Pb and other heavy metal abundance, the relationship between surface soil metal concentrations and hyperspectral reflectance measurements was examined via partial least squares regression (PLSR) modeling. Soil samples were taken from four study sites. Metal concentrations were determined by ICP-AES analysis, and reflectance was measured with an ASD field spectrometer covering the spectral region of 350-2500nm. <br><br> Lead displayed exponential decrease as a function of distance from the roadway, demonstrating the depositional patterns from leaded gas combustion which remain on the landscape 20 years after the phase-out of leaded gasoline. <br><br> Calibration samples were used to derive the PLSR algorithm, and validation samples assessed the model’s predictive ability. The correlation coefficients between the lab-determined abundance and the abundance predicted from PLSR calibration for all metals except Cu were at or above 0.970, with the correlation coefficient for Pb the highest of all metals (0.992). Manganese, Zn, and Pb had significant coefficients of determination (0.808, 0.760, and 0.746, respectively) for the validation samples. These results suggest that lead and other heavy metal concentrations can be retrieved from spectral reflectance at high accuracy. Reflectance spectroscopy thus has potential to map the spatial distribution of Pb abundance with the aim of improving children’s health in an urban environment.<br><br>

IDENTIFICATION OF CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT THE RESOLUTION OF THE GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS)
Natasha Hasbah Gail
Rough Rock Community School, Rough Rock, Arizona, United States

The goals of this project were to determine why repeated readings on a handheld GPS receiver are different each time a reading is taken at a particular location and to explain the cause of shifting of waypoints that occurs when downloaded into different computer software applications. In addition, mapping of the earth’s three-dimensional surface onto a two-dimensional surface was addressed. <br><br> Three areas selected outside Rough Rock Community School included Trading Post Wash, a relatively flat area near the high school football field and a hilly location. A path of 200 meters was walked on five different days, with readings taken at the starting point and every 20 meters along the route as measured by a surveyors tape. Current weather conditions, satellite identification numbers at each waypoint, as well as the UTM locations and elevations were recorded. <br><br> Data from each route was successfully collected and downloaded into the computer applications. No significant shift of waypoints was seen when using the MapSource software, but a significant shift was seen when using the AutoCAD software. The AutoCAD software was able to represent the three-dimensional route with significant detail unlike the MapSource software. <br><br> Time of day and weather have an effect on the number of satellites and which satellites that a GPS receiver is able to access. Accuracy of information recorded in the GPS units has an effect on the software being used to analyze the geographic data. Different software can be used to represent either true location or three-dimensional representation of the information. <br><br> <br><br>

THE PERFORMANCES OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF TREES IN REDUCING THE DESTRUCTIVENESS OF AN EARTHQUAKE AND FUNCTIONING OF CITIES' NATURE
Hayri Genc
Private Fatih High School, Istanbul,TURKEY

Earthquakes have always been a great threat on humankind both in our country and all over the world as it is impossible to prevent; but especially in Istanbul and other similiar settlements of the world, it still seems to pose a great danger because the estimated damage is very big. Still there are some chances to reduce the effect. Various earthquake-prone countries have been trying to minimize the effects of earthquake. For instance Japan reduces the destructive effects of earthquakes by its technology. Unfortunately not all the countries have that technology, and at this point organized tree planting can help.<br><br>Underground waters infiltrate into the walls of buildings, thus damaging in-wall iron. Wherever liquefaction is matter of fact, buildings are uprooted from the ground. Our study showed that the destruction of a major earthquake may be reduced by trees as they sponge the water underground with stomatal activities, transpiration, and in this way the cement and the iron used in the construction of buildings remain less affected. This led us to the fact that more trees should be planted in settlements, especially in metropolitan cities like Istanbul where there are some districts which urgently need it. Trees can make the soil tighter so that corrosion will be less. By organized tree planting, cities can look cleaner and greener. Considering the aesthetic features of trees, an organized plantation will ensure a better urban landscape architecture as well as reducing the destructive effects of a major earthquake.<br><br>

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING FOR EARTH'S EARLIEST EUKARYOTES
Aarisha Shrestha
Eleanor Roosevelt High School, Greenbelt, Maryland, USA

This project focused on constructing time-series analyses of carbon and sulfur, which are elements sensitive to the amount of oxygen in the ocean and atmosphere, deposited as minerals in oceanic environments from Brazil and Western Australia approximately 2.5 billion years ago. Previous studies of biomarkers in the McRae Shale of Western Australia showed evidence of eukaryotes, which require oxygen to grow, at this time. This study aimed to understand whether the atmosphere contained free oxygen, or whether the eukaryotes evolved in oxygen “oases” due to intense photosynthesis. Samples from drill cores were crushed to a powder and acidified to remove carbonate minerals. Residues, such as organic carbon and pyrite, were then weighed and placed into tin cups for elemental and isotopic analyses. Combustion of the residues in an elemental analyzer formed gaseous carbon dioxide (CO2) and sulfur monoxide (SO) molecules, which were ionized and whose isotopic abundances were measured with a gas source mass spectrometer. Results of these measurements suggest high rates of photosynthetic productivity leading to the formation and accumulation of organic carbon, as well as the release of oxygen. However, samples in both units record anomalous sulfur isotope compositions, which are believed to result from the destruction of sulfur-bearing gases in the atmosphere by intense ultra-violet radiation in the absence of oxygen and ozone. In conclusion, the oxygen produced by photosynthesis in the oceans must have been quickly consumed, in part by eukaryotes to run their metabolisms, but did not accumulate in significant quantities in the atmosphere. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

MAPPING THE WORLD

<br><br> What is “true” about my map? On a Mercator map two things are true: distance and shape. A Mercator map is a cylindrical projection, so size and direction are distorted. The equator is the only undistorted line. On The Projection of Latitude and Longitude in Three Views, I measured the chord distance between the intersections of the latitude circles and longitude lines of the polar view. This indicates the effect of longitudinal convergence toward the poles.<br><br> Why is a Mercator map distorted ? The distortion is created when the longitude lines are drawn as parallel lines on the flat map rather than the converging lines on the globe. In effect, what has been done is to increase or expand the distance, thus the distortion, between the longitude lines at an increasing rate toward the poles. Shape and direction can be retained by compensating for this longitude expansion by increasing the distance of latitude at the same rate.<br><br> This map has a scale. This scale varies upon latitude and becomes larger as you go to higher latitudes. There are two letters in capitals, RF. This stands for Representative Fraction. It represents every inch on my map, with the figure of 1:6,500,000. On a globe, a scale is constant and accurate, but the globe is impractical for navigation and other applied uses.<br><br>

SLEUTHING EPICENTER DIRECTION FROM SEISMITES IN THE GRAND STAIRCASE-ESCALANTE NATIONAL MONUMENT, UTAH
Hannah Louise Wolf
Parkland High School, Allentown, PA, USA

The upper and capping sandstone members of the Upper Cretaceous Wahweap Formation, within Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, Utah, contain discrete zones of soft-sediment deformation. Because this area was tectonically active during the deposition of the Wahweap, it was hypothesized that the deformation structures were of seismic origin, and that their distribution pattern could indicate the source of earthquake activity. <br><br> Criteria have been established, in literature, for identifying soft-sediment deformation structures, such as seismites. A study was undertaken to determine if the deformation structures fit the criteria for seismic origin, and if their distribution and orientation could be used to locate earthquake epicenters. Deformation features were mapped, photographed, and measured within the study area. The data indicates these features are seismites. Detailed examination of seismite fold axes shows a systematic change in orientation. From north to south, the mean orientation of fold axes rotates progressively from east-trending to south-trending, and a progressive change in the magnitude of the features from highly deformed to mildly deformed was observed along the contact between the upper and the capping sandstone members.<br><br> When the trends of the fold axes, coupled with changes in intensity, are plotted on a map of the field area, they indicate a radial pattern with a point of origin north and west of the study area. Assuming the fold axes are parallel to the direction of seismic wave propagation, this pattern is consistent with the geometrical spreading of earthquake waves originating from epicenters north and west of the study area.<br><br>

Is it possible to build a tipping bucket rain gauge that accurately records the rain, and add it to an already constructed weather system? Yes, I believe it is possible to build a tipping bucket rain gauge that accurately records the rain, and add it to an already constructed weather system. Using a piece of galvanized flashing cut it into four pieces; one for the main part of the bucket, one for the divider piece, one for a long leg, and one for a shorter leg. These were soldered together and holes were drilled in the legs of the bucket and a wire was placed through the holes. This sits on top of two wooden dowels which are screwed onto an eight inch diameter piece of wood. Galvanized flashing was placed around the base, and a funnel was placed on top to guide the rain on top of the tipping bucket. When the bucket tips it hits a screw that is placed before the drainage holes in the wooden base. A magnet is placed on top of the divider of the bucket and taped for security. Directly in front of the magnet is a magnet reed switch which is connected to the dowel with popsicle sticks. When the magnet passes over the reed switch it counts how many times the bucket tips and sends it to the BASIC stamp this is then recorded on the laptop computer.

THE CORRELATION BETWEEN SUNSPOT ACTIVITY AND THE TEMPERATURE OF THE EARTH
Dominique Marianna Cox
Morenci High School, Morenci, Michigan, USA

Researching a possible link between earth’s average temperature and sunspot activity would be important to establish the fact that earth’s environment is not contained to its atmosphere. Warming and cooling trends that occur on the earth over several years may be explained if there is a correlation. If average global temperatures are connected to sunspot activity, the finding can be applied in the research of atmospheric weather on other planets. It was hypothesized that if the earth’s average temperature and sunspots are connected, then the more sunspots there were, then the higher earth’s average temperature would be.<br><br><br>A telescope with a solar lens and online temperature sources was used to collect data for sunspots. Temperature data was collected from online resources. Sunspot numbers and average temperature were compared to each other and graphed. The graph did not show a correlation between sunspot activity and average daily global maximum temperature.<br><br><br>The hypothesis that an increase in sunspot activity would slightly raise the earth’s average temperature was not supported because the results of the experiment were inconclusive. While there was no positive correlation, as hypothesized, between sunspot activity and the daily average global temperature of the earth, there was also no negative correlation. The hypothesis was not disproved, but at the same time, not supported. More extensive and comprehensive research could yield different results for this topic. <br><br><br>Though this experiment did not produce any conclusive results, it can still be applied to future testing on this topic.<br><br>

ANALYSIS OF SIMULATED SLIP-STICK EARTHQUAKE MOTION
Katherine Marie Hushebeck
Notre Dame Academy, Park Hills KY, USA

It has been postulated that by simulating the conditions of seismic activity in an experimental environment, the underlying factors that trigger earthquakes may be studied. The purpose of this experiment was to analyze the interplay among factors that influence seismic activity using a simulated environment. My apparatus consisted of a shallow wooden box of dimensions 92 x 21 x 2.6 cm and a matchbox containing various masses that was pulled across the bed of glass beads by a motorized car. The respective velocities, time intervals between force peaks, and overall energy released for each test condition were analyzed. An increased bead diameter resulted in an overall greater speed and energy release. The smaller diameter beads resulted in seismic waves that were less frequent than those produced by the larger beads. Using a smaller mass resulted in a greater number of quakes and a lower level of energy release while the greater mass produced a lower number of quakes and a higher level of energy released.

TRACING EARLY HOMINID MIGRATIONS IN INDIA: ESR DATING AT HATHNORA AND DEVNI-KHADRI.
Maysun Mazhar Hasan, Hermain Suhail Khan
Francis Lewis High School, Fresh Meadows, NY, USA

The only hominid fossils between Georgia and southeast Asia come from Hathnora, in the Narmada Valley, and Devni-Khadri, from the Siwalk Group, Punjab. Both sites have yielded many other vertebrate fossils. Since electron spin resonance (ESR) can date fossil mammalian tooth enamel ranging from 5 ka to 5 Ma in age, by comparing the accumulated radiation dose with the total radiation dose rate from the tooth and its environment, three mammalian teeth from the same layer as the Narmada hominid site were dated using ESR. The Hathnora teeth produced inconsistent ages indicating that some fossils in the Narmada deposits were reworked. Also probably reworked, the hominid may predate 60 ka. To test the applicability of ESR dating for reptiles, three crocodilian teeth and one elephant tooth from Devni-Khadri were compared. Athough the crocodilian teeth averaged 800 ± 30 ka assuming recent U uptake (RU), younger than anticipated, the elephant tooth gave an age of 2.59 ± 0.09 Ma (RU), which agrees with the faunal estimates for the Pinjore Fm. Although the crocodilian teeth did not provide reliable ages, thanks to strong Fe3+ signal interference, crocodiles without such problems may be datable, because a strong hydroxyapatite dating signal was present.

HURRICANES FORCES OF NATURE
Daniel O. Caballero, Laura Torres
James Pace High School, Brownsville Tx., United States.

The purpose of this experiment is to prove how salinity of water might have a direct effect on formation of hurricanes by experimentation, recreating weather conditions during this phenomenon on a hurricane generator box with a control variable known as normal sea water first used on its original form and then diluted with tap water recreating the polar cap melting occurring on the poles, proving that because of the changes in weather, the water composition around the globe has changed therefore, during this year a much higher rate of hurricane formation than previous years generating them at a faster rate, and every time stronger than the previous. The salt water without changes created a mini hurricane at a slower rate than the controlled experiment of sea water diluted with tap water, and besides of taking less time the hurricane cloud was ticker because the evaporation rate was faster during the controlled experiment proving that with a less salty composition of water not only hurricanes can form faster but they also grow stronger causing a season of hurricanes this year incredibly active and dangerous.

IMPROVING WEATHER TECHNOLOGY FOR THE FURTURE: WDSS-II PHASE II
Michael William Kirlin
Carroll High School, Dayton Ohio, United States of America

The goal of this project is to increase the data handling and processing capabilities in the Warning Decision Support System – Integrated Information (WDSS-II) with a new Program Specific: Data Processing Algorithm (DAPA) for indexing, compressing, and processing data sets, for the main purpose of providing improved efficiency for weather prediction times. Much success with this goal has led to the development of DAPA currently in closed beta release. The computer system’s native data handling processes were observed and logged for references of typical data handling procedures. The end result of this procedure was a definitive way to control input strings for processing that would allow for more structured processing capabilities. Long term looping coupled with normal system operation was recorded to better grasp the operating platform’s interaction with the programs unaided processing abilities. This enabled a path to be derived in which a user could actively control system inputs without risking the stability of the software program or the operating system platform. The pending outcomes of this project have great implementations both in computer science and earth science, specifically meteorology. With the improved “smart system” processing computations for specifically designed programs, DAPA can be integrated alongside systems such as the WDSS-II enabling faster outputs with reliable data and a stable system. Such an improvement leads to quicker warning decisions and timely information that can be used to help in severe weather events.<br><br>

THE EFFECT OF DROUGHT ON THE SALINITY ZONE IN THE EDWARDS AQUIFER
Jenna Sue Kromann
James Bowie High School, Austin, Texas, United States 

This investigation was conducted to determine if drought affects the salinity zone by degrading the water quality in the Edwards Aquifer. Tests were conducted on the water from various wells located within the freshwater/saline interface of the Barton Springs segment of the Edwards Aquifer. The water samples were tested for alkalinity, chlorides, hardness, nitrates, sulfates, and sulfides. Once the data was collected and analyzed, maps were developed to plot isopleth lines for total dissolved solids (TDS), chlorides, and sulfates.<br><br> Wells were tested along the salinity zone for pH, temperature, conductivity, and water depth. Once equilibrated these parameters help to show when the well is purged. After the samples were collected from each well, they were analyzed for: alkalinity, chlorides, hardness, nitrates, sulfates, and sulfides: using the spectrophotometer and the digital titrator. Then using the Texas Water Development Board Database, historical data was gathered for wells along the freshwater/saline interface. Finally using the historical water quality data and discharge rates of Barton Springs, high and low flow periods were defined and plotted on a map using isopleth lines drawn for: TDS, chlorides, and sulfates.<br><br> From the results of the experiment, it can be seen that during low flow drought conditions there was a shift in the boundary between the saline and freshwater interface. Overall, during drought conditions (low-flow periods) the concentrations of sulfates, chlorides, and total dissolved solids increased for selected wells. <br><br> Then during high-flow periods the concentrations of sulfates, chlorides, and TDS decreases, due to dilution. The data supports the hypothesis that during drought conditions, the salinity zone will shift into the freshwater causing the water quality to significantly decrease. <br><br>

THE MARVELOUS MAGNETOMETER PART II
Gavin Gregory Reen
La Plata High School, La Plata Maryland, United States of America

The experiment strove to find a pattern of fluctuation in the Earth's magnetosphere, with respect to the time of day and day of the month. Last year's project involved building a magnetometer. This was used again this year, along with the addition of new apparatuses, including a pair of Helmholtz coils, a position detector, and a feedback circuit, magnetic readings were taken every day for 23 hours, for the month of December. These readings were remotely collected using a LabPro analog-to-digital device, and transferred onto a computer. Using the built-in capabilities of the LabPro software, eight different lines of best fit were superimposed upon the daily graphs of data, which were used for analysis. In arranging the data into these one-page graphs, though, 12,170 points of data were compressed into a very small space, resulting in a decline in the readability and the aesthetics of the graphs. Even so, it would appear that there were indeed consistent crests and troughs within the waves of the daily readings. These oscillations frequently occurred within a narrow window of midnight and midday. When the Earth is directly aligned with the Sun, at times that are identical or approximate to midday and midnight, the magnetic activity observed is stronger, which can be perceived as an effect of the direct solar radiation and the flow of the solar winds. This supports the hypothesis and clearly demonstrates a scientifically valid phenomenon; in essence, there is in fact a correlation between the Earth's position in relation to the Sun and the magnetic activity observed and recorded.

STREAM CHANNEL DYNAMICS IN LARGO CANYON 1882-2005, NORTHWEST NEW MEXICO
Shandiin Chanel Copeland
Kirtland Central High School, Kirtland, New Mexico, USA

In the 1880s, arroyo channels began to intensely erode, widen, and deepen in much of the American Southwest. Different theories about what may have caused this erosion cycle include changes in precipitation, overgrazing, or a combination of both. The Byran-Antevs model argues that arroyo cutting is associated with drought and poor vegetation and arroyo filling with higher rainfall and improved vegetation cover. The Martin-Schoenwatter model states that arroyo cutting is associated with increased summer rainfall when there may actually be greater annual rainfall and increased vegetation cover.<br><br>Nearly 125 years of Largo Canyon channel size data, precipitation, homesteading, and livestock data are available to examine this question. Using 1882 survey data, aerial photography, and GIS, can it be determined what effect precipitation, homesteading, and livestock had on the channel of Largo Canyon?<br><br>The hypothesis is that there will be an association between channel size and acreage, and the variables of precipitation, homesteading, and livestock numbers in Largo Canyon. <br><br> <br><br>As a result of the analysis, the hypothesis is not rejected. There appears to be strong association between livestock numbers, homesteading, and erratic precipitation, including very dry years, with a measurable increase in the channel of Largo Canyon between 1882 and 1935, and as livestock, principally sheep declined in numbers, a filling in of the Largo channel after 1935.<br><br>

DOES AN EARTHQUAKE'S ANGLE OF FAULT ANHD DIRECTION OF SLIP AFFECT THE DISPLACEMENT OF WATER?
Michael Reed Glawe
New Ulm Cathedral High School, New Ulm, Minesota, United States

The purpose of this project is to test if the different types of plate boundaries affect the height of the wave. The tests will be performed using a model sized edition of a real life sized earthquake, including the three different types of boundaries and a tank of water (representing the ocean). Although the tests are miniature sizes of what a real tsunami and earthquake can produce, the measured heights of the waves will be multiplied by a regular, common sized tsunami wave in order to get a real life picture of what it would look like. The model will demonstrate a tsunami, generating from an 8.0-9.0 earthquake.<br><br> The Hypothesis is: The Convergent Boundary would generate the tallest wave.<br><br> The procedure will involve measuring the depth of water, making sure that it remains the constant depth. To measure the height of the wave, paper rulers will be used, clipped to the edge of the tank (these may also be used to measure the depth). Making sure the depth is set at six centimeters, place one of the three different boundary models in the tank. Start the model up and run it until it makes the major shift in position. When the shift happens, stop the model. Take the paper ruler and record the highest point of the wave on the ruler. Repeat steps until all measurements are tested and recorded including the different boundary models.<br><br> In conclusion, measurements showed that the sudden rebound in the Convergent Boundary model caused the most displacement.

Aluminum Phyllosilicate (Bentonite) is an extremely absorbent clay material found in the Northern United States. Uses for this clay include drilling mud, thickening agent in facial masks, cosmetics, and cat litter.<br><br><br>The purpose of this project was to determine if the aluminum phyllosilicate found in and surrounding Phillips County, MT, USA, could be commercially exploited based on a series of physical tests. I also wanted to determine what each sample could be used for. <br><br><br>Bentonite samples were taken from various depths at several test pits. I tested the samples for sand percentage by mixing each with distilled water and wet sieving the mixtures through a mesh sieve. The remaining material was dried and weighed. Splits of each sample were sent to the BLM lab in Worland, WY, where the following tests were performed: Percentage of moisture, water loss, swell, water absorption, water percentage, grit percentage, foundry, and X-ray diffraction.<br><br><br>A1 light, A2, A3, A5 and B2 could be used for drilling mud. All samples except A2 could be used as a hole plug. All samples could be used as a taconite binder, and all except A1 dark could be used as a binder for foundry sand. Other tests such as grit and water percentage did not eliminate any sample from potential uses listed above. However, B1 and B2 did not have noticeably less uses than A1 through A5, as I had previously hypothesized, and my null hypothesis was rejected.<br><br>

DEVELOPING ESR DATING FOR CROCODYLIAN TEETH: GEOCHEMICAL ANALYSES OF IRON UPTAKE IN CROCODYLIAN HYDROXYAPATITE
Hermain Suhail Khan
Staten Island Technical High School, Staten Island, New York, USA

Crocodylian tooth enamel from Devni-Khadri, India, could not be dated by ESR (electron spin resonance) in an earlier study, because an Fe3+ signal interference reduced accumulated dose measurement accuracy. To assess if Fe3+ signals are ubiquitous in crocodylian teeth, modern Alligator mississippiensis (American Alligator) teeth were tested. The modern teeth contained no Fe3+ interference signals, suggesting that crocodylian teeth absorb Fe during fossil diagenesis within the sediment. To measure an Fe3+ signal that could be used to subtract the Fe3+ interference signal from the dating signal and to geochemically simulate natural diagenetic Fe uptake, ten modern crocodylian and three Ursus arctos (black bear) teeth were suspended in an Fe(NO3)3 solution. All the teeth uptook Fe3+ within two weeks, but the Fe3+ uptake rate and magnitude depended on the tooth's surface:volume ratio. SEM EDX analyses revealed that the Fe substitutes for Ca in the hydroxyapatite crystal. <br><br> A pure Fe3+ signal, obtained from the Fe3+ uptake experiment, was subtracted electronically from the ESR signals in the Devni-Khadri crocodylian enamel. The resulting hydroxyapatite signals gave internally consistent accumulated doses and ages, ranging from ~ 500 ka to 1.1 Ma, assuming recent U uptake (RU; p = 10), but enamel from an elephant tooth from the same unit gave an age of 2.59 ± 0.09 Ma (RU; p = 10), which agrees well with the Pinjore Fm. faunal estimates. Therefore, some Devni-Khadri teeth were likely reworked, but reliability for crocodylian ESR ages still remains to be rigorously tested against teeth of known age. <br><br>

TOPOGRAPHIC FEATURES AND FORMATION PROCESS OF MAMIGASAKI ALLUVIAL FAN, NORTHERN JAPAN, BASED ON THE FIELD OBSERVATIONS AND FLUME EXPERIMENTS
Midori Kanno
Yamagata Prefectual Yamagata Higashi High School, JAPAN

I wondered why Mamigasaki alluvial fan, on which I live, is so hilly. To understand how it was formed I examined topographical maps and boring data, and simulated the formation of the fan by conducting a flume experiment.<br><br>Mamigasaki alluvial fan is subdivided into three parts: northern, central and southern, by the topography. Comparing the distribution of gravel beds in cores, five gravel beds made by avalanches were noticed in the central part. Gravel beds in the northern part are less frequent than the central area. The order of deposition and the depths of the gravel beds in the central are different from those observed in the southern area. Therefore, geologically these three parts are differentiated. The flume experiment showed that if there was topographic high by the former deposit, the next flow changed its course so as to avoid it, and eventually a fan grows in a shape of Japanese Aralias' leaf.<br><br>History of this fan is summarized as follows. Firstly the origin of the fan was formed. Next, the old Mamigasaki River changed the route from the south toward the center by Mt. Ryuzan's landslide. Then, the central part was formed by deposits supply and erosion of the old river. Finally, the old river was forced to move to the present place by the local government in the 17th century. So, the present topography was established. <br><br>Thus the formation of the fan was controlled by the multiple disastrous avalanches, which I believe will occur also in the future. <br><br>

SEQUESTRATION VS. ALBEDO EFFECT
Zarif Hasan
Westover High School, Albany, Georgia, USA

The purpose of experiment is to see if polar icecaps reflecting the Sun's radiation back into the atmosphere (Albedo Effect) plays a larger role in decreasing the effects of anthropogenic CO2 than plants absorbing and storing CO2 (CO2 Sequestration). To test this I obtained three large glass jars and labeled them alpha, beta, and gamma. I put a 2 cm layer of pine straw from the ground I placed jars on for the experiment, an alcohol thermometer, and a candle in jar gamma. Jar beta also had pine straw, an alcohol thermometer, and a candle but it also had an African violet inside it. In jar alpha I put a sheet of paper that has been cut into the shape of the base of the jar, an alcohol thermometer, and a candle. After I had the jars set up I lighted the candles and waited for the flames to die out. I then waited an additional five minutes so the plant in canister beta has a chance to absorb some of the CO2. After the five minutes has elapsed I put another thermometer outside and then I put all three canisters outside in direct sunlight and waited for 15 minutes, I recorded the temperature every five minutes in a logbook. I repeated the experiment and received similar results, these are the averages.<br><br> The average temperature for jar alpha is 33.3 degrees Celsius. The average temperature for jar beta is 37 degrees Celsius. The average temperature for jar gamma is 39.8 degrees Celsius. The average outside temperature is 23.666 degrees Celsius.<br><br> The information from my experiment supports my hypothesis that the polar icecaps play a larger role in decreasing the effects of anthropogenic CO2 than CO2 Sequestration.<br><br>

PHASEOLUS LUNATUS GROWTH PATTERNS IN A SIMULATED MARS ENVIRONMENT: YEAR IV
Sasha Annalicia Rohret
Keystone School, San Antonio Texas, United States

The purpose of this project is to determine what conditions a greenhouse on Mars would have to supply earth plants in order for optimum growth and development. The purpose of a fourth year study is to determine during which week of development, Martian radiation has the greatest effect. <br><br> It was hypothesized that the environment that provided for the greatest number of plants to germinate and develop would be the control carbon dioxide environment, with 0.15% CO2, followed by the control earth environment; a 0.15% CO2 environment irradiated with 25 millirads of ultraviolet light per day during the second week of development of the Phaseolus lunatus seeds would show the next greatest number of plants to develop, leaving the 0.15% CO2 environment, radiated during the first week of development, to produce the least number of healthy developing plants. <br><br> Four air-tight tanks were constructed, and seventeen seeds were placed in containers inside each tank. One tank contained a completely Earth environment. The second had 0.15% CO2, the third 0.15% CO2 and was radiated during the 1st week of development, and the fourth 0.15% CO2 and was radiated during the second week of development. Growth rates were recorded for three weeks, while the temperature/humidity were also monitored and recorded. The tanks were opened and the containers were photographed. At the end of the experiment, a statistical analysis was done using the data collected.<br><br> The statistical analysis confirmed the hypothesis, verifying that growth rates, biomass, and number of leaves were greater in the control CO2 environment, although closely followed by the control earth environment.<br><br>

DETERMINING A VALUE FOR GRAVITY WITH AN ACCURACY OF 10 PARTS PER BILLION FOR THE ELECTRONIC KILOGRAM EXPERIMENT
Beatrice Smith Parker
Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School, Bethesda, Maryland, USA

The kilogram is the only base unit in the International System (SI) whose definition is still based on a physical artifact instead of on quantum references. The Electronic Kilogram Experiment seeks to redefine the kilogram in terms of quantum references for mechanical and electrical power with a watt balance. Gravity is presently one of the largest uncertainty components of the experiment. The goal of this project is to reduce the uncertainty in the gravity measurement to less than 10 parts per billion for the experiment. <br><br> A gravity transfer meter (Scintrex CG-5) was used to measure relative values of gravity. The meter was used to determine a gravity gradient near an absolute gravimeter, a gradient near the reference mass in the watt balance, and a transfer between the two locations. The gravity data collected was corrected for drift. The internal correction factors of the meter were checked. A reasonable estimate for the combined relative uncertainty of the three measurements was made and determined to be just greater than 6 parts per billion, achieving the desired accuracy of the attempt. The linearity of the meter’s overall drift and the sensitivity to tilt was characterized. Three dimensional gravity maps of the areas around the absolute gravimeter and watt balance were constructed as contour plots. Finally, the influence of the magnetic field on the gravity gradients and transfer was examined. <br><br>

DETERMINING THE ORIGIN OF A VOLCANIC ASH LAYER IN A CREEK BANK
Karissa Audrey Floerchinger
Cascade High School, Cascade, Montana, United States

This project is a result of investigations on the origin of an unknown layer in a creek bank. The initial problem was to identify the layer as ash and determine what volcano it originated from. This then led to further investigation on the ash layer and the layers above and below to determine how they were deposited.<br><br>Looking underneath the microscope and viewing glass shards, determining that it contatined magnetite,and that the layer had a unique texture different than clay or sand, identified the layer. The use of a Petrographic microscope was used to determine the refractive index of the ash to be between 1.51 and 1.52, which was compared to published results. A color test with the Munsell Book of Color was used to compare ash from different volcanoes. Observations were made on pictures and geological maps to help determine how layers were deposited. Bottle settling rate results indicated the layers composition and particle makeup.<br><br>Overall this project indicated that the unknown layer was ash that originated from Mount Mazama. Evidence was drawn for deposition occurring in a lake, meandering stream or by wind.<br><br>

WIND WAVE MEASUREMENTS AND MODELLING IN KUDEMA BAY, ESTONIAN ARCHIPELAGO SEA
Victor Alari
Gustav Adolfs Grammar School, Suur-Kloostri 16, Tallinn, Estonia

The accurate picture of the typical and extreme wave properties of Küdema Bay, lying North-West to Saaremaa Island, is important for many research topics and engineering applications. In 2005, new deep sea harbor was built on the west coast of Küdema Bay despite of the fact that during the last 100 years, the harbor was twice demolished by northerly storms. For the improvement of safe navigation of vessels, the wind wave climate of Küdema Bay was analyzed on the basis of wave measurements which were carried out in summer and in autumn 2005 with the use of the third generation spectral wave model SWAN.<br><br>The analysis of the wave data sets has shown that significant wave heights and also peak periods were somewhat higher in the autumn measurement campaign. The average wave parameters remained low, and such low wave climate mainly results from the fact that the winds are frequently blowing from the mainland. The strongest measured wave event was associated with the north-westerly winds with force up to 14 m/s and the significant wave height maximum was 1.23 m. Wave model derived significant wave heights were well correlated with the measured ones. Modelling of saturated wave fields reveals that during strong NNW storms (25 m/s) significant wave heights may reach 5 meters near the port and fairway. Such rough waves are dangerous even for larger vessels. <br><br>It may be concluded that the wave climate of the bay is rather moderate and the highest waves are expected with north-westerly storms.<br><br>

THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS AND PREDICTIVE CAPABILITIES OF THE EL NINO SOUTHERN OSCILLATION AND THE NORTH ATLANTIC OSCILLATION ON WESTERN HEMISPHERE WARM POOL VARIABILITY
John Christopher Turner
Lincoln High School, Tallahassee, Florida, United States of America

The Western Hemisphere Warm Pool (WHWP) is an area of sea surface temperature (SST) warmer than 28.5º C that influences precipitation across the Americas and impacts Atlantic and Pacific tropical cyclone development. Understanding the WHWP is critical to predicting the behavior of various weather patterns. This project was designed to study effects of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and/or El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on the WHWP as a possible forecasting tool.<br><br> Using Matlab, over one million SST data plots were interpolated to study correlations spanning the past 56 years. The WHWP was then identified, and quantified into an index assessing WHWP fluctuation on a monthly, annual, and interannual basis. After validating several possible relationships, the most promising were used to generate a model predicting WHWP size over a given time period.<br><br> In conclusion, this research found a strong correlation between the effects of the ENSO and NAO on the WHWP. During positive (negative) phases of the NAO, the easterly wind flow is stronger (weaker) across the North Atlantic due to the stronger Bermuda High, which increases (decreases) upwelling (downwelling). This process of bringing cooler water from the ocean depths to the sea surface decreases (increases) SSTs and limits (expands) the size of the WHWP. By quantifying this relationship and developing predictive models based upon the results, this project indicates that fluctuations in the ENSO and NAO can be used as a tool for improving estimation of the WHWP, potentially benefiting prediction of tropical cyclones and weather patterns across the Americas.

Greensburg Community High School; Greensburg, Indiana USA

<br><br> My project will test different foundations to see which ones will stabilize a building best during an earthquake. Each foundation will be tested on the same building. My independent variable will be the different types of foundations. My dependent variable will be the location of the building. I will measure how far the building was out of plumb in inches. My hypothesis is that the floating foundation will do the worst. I think the piers will do the best.<br><br> I made three different foundations and three different types of soils. The three foundations were floating, friction piles, and piers. The three soils were sand/gravel, dirt, and dirt/water. Each soil was placed in a tub. I placed each foundation in the soils. Next I placed the tub on the washing machine. I set the washing machine to spin cycle for 5 minutes. Afterwards I recorded the movement of the building. <br><br> I will be creating a bar graph. This graph will show how much the foundation let the building move out of plumb in inches. I will first take pictures of each building from the front view and the side view.<br><br> I learned that my hypothesis was partly true. The piers did the best in each soil. The floating foundation did the worst in each soil except for the friction piles doing the worst in sand/gravel.<br><br>

RHIZOLITH/HYMENOPTERA RELATIONSHIPS, CLARON FORMATION (EOCENE) NAVAJO LAKE, KANE COUNTY, UTAH
Carl Frederick Lohrengel IV
Matheson Junior High School, Magna, Ut, U.S.A.

The Claron Formation (Eocene Epoch) is widely exposed in Iron, Kane, and Garfield Counties, Utah. Generally the outcrops are rubbly and of a poor quality to study the composition and structure of the rocks. An unusually good exposure occurs along the south side of Navajo Lake, Kane County, Utah. An unusually outstanding assemblage of rhizolith material was located in this exposure. the assemblage of ichnofossils includes rhizohalos, rhizomolds, and rhizotubes. In addition several of the rhizomolds had significant infilling of a different material than the host sediment. Comparison with modern ground nesting hymenoptera from the Bahamas showed that the Claron Fm. rhizomolds had also been occupied by ground nesting hymenoptera after the original plants decayed and were gone. A specific hymenopotrid cannot be determined from the material at hand.

STRENGTHENING THE CONNECTION BETWEEN EASTERN SIBERIA AND WESTERN LAURENTIA BY PROVENANCE POINT- COUNT ANALYSIS STUDY OF RIFT-RELATED SEDIMENTS
Christopher Errol Casas
Big Sky High School, Missoula MT, US

New data will be presented that will help connect the late proterozoic continents of Siberia and Laurentia using a traditional point-count analysis study. This study will specifically deal with the Sears and Price reconstruction of Rodinia, which Siberia and Laurentia were both a part. A modified Dickensons model for ternary diagrams will be used to help assist in determining the source for the sedimentary rock samples. These samples were taken from correlative stratification found in the White-Inyo Mountains and the Death Valley region. <br><br> <br><br>An intracatonic basin formed during the succession of Rodinia. As this rifting between Siberia and Laurentia occurred the basin began to receive sediment form Laurentia and Siberia. During different periods of this rifting the basin would receive sediment that differed in maturity. Maturity levels of sediments are clear indications of the provenance of the sediment. <br><br> <br><br>By collecting samples from Laurentian sedimentary rock layers that formed during the rifting of Rodinia and subsequently performing a point-count analysis on these samples the provenance sources for these samples were discovered. The Point-Count analysis revealed the overall composition of the samples. The standard QFL ternary diagrams were employed to show provenance relations. The ternary diagrams were compared to those of A.K. Kholdey, who did a similar study on correlative Siberian units found in the Sette Daban. In conclusion, Siberian samples showed provenance terrains that only could have come from Laurentia. The provenance found to be similar in both ternary diagrams was recycled orogenic. <br><br>

TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE DEPENDENCY OF CARBON MONOXIDE'S ABSORPTION CROSS-SECTION
Parv Aggarwal
NC School of Science and Mathematics, Durham, North Carolina, U.S.A.

The purpose of this research was to test theoretical predictions of how the absorption cross-section for the gas CO changes with the gas’s temperature and pressure in the infrared wave-number range 2170-2175 1/cm (targeted for the Vibrational-Rotational transition with highest absorbance). Based on a theoretical formula obtained from Quantum Mechanics, Boltzmann statistics and parameters specific to CO, an oscillating trend in peak cross-section with temperature and pressure was predicted. This prediction was tested by using a Fourier-Transform Spectrometer to measure the absorbance of CO heated or cooled to temperatures of 239-330K in approximately 10K increments, allowing pressure to vary accordingly. The results indicate a small error between the measured and predicted cross-sections. The results will have implications in developing theories to predict how the atmospheric absorption of Greenhouse Gases in the infrared region depends on gas temperature, thus predicting a potential feedback cycle that could affect their Global Warming potential once concentrations have been increased beyond a given amount.

A NOVEL DESIGN FOR MAGNETIC LEVITATING SEISMOGRAPH
Rishin Behl
Kendriya Vidyalaya B- Camp Mankhurd,Mumbai-88,Maharashtra,India

A configuration of magnets is used to levitate a shaft in air by the repulsion force between the magnets. By appropriate design, the Lorenz-forces can be stabilized, creating a potential-well which restricts wobble amplitude of the shaft without hampering the disturbances caused due to external forces and sensitivity of the device. One end of the levitating shaft touches a glass plate, coupled to a heavy framework connected to the earth. Any force detected by the device causes a relative motion of the shaft in XY plane. A mirror is attached to the head of the shaft which reflects a laser beam, mounted on a vibration-isolated independent platform. The reflected beam produces an amplified motion corresponding to small changes in the movement of the shaft This can be recorded on a photo-detector. The entire apparatus is shielded to protect it from air-currents and other external disturbances. To simulate response to an earthquake, the base of the device is made to vibrate in the desired low-frequency range by connecting it to the diaphragm of a loudspeaker and the corresponding reading on the photo-detector recorded. This design avoids the use of springs and eliminates some of the problems of mechanical seismographs. In future, the deflected beam pattern can be recorded using a photosensitive array and the data grabbed at regular time-intervals. Such frames over a time ‘t ’ can be integrated to form a 3-d graph. This can be vectorised and resolved to give a direction and magnitude of the force.<br><br> <br><br>

DUST SUPPRESSION APPLICATIONS FOR COLLAGEN GELATIN HYDROLYSATE
Andrew Scott Miers
O'Donnell High School, O'Donnell Texas, United States

Can collagen gelatin hydrolysate, a recycled protein, be used to diminish air pollution? The collagen gelatin hydrolysate, a recycled protein can be successfully added to soil to decrease not only the amount of soil erosion but also suppress the amount of airborne dust and fungal spores. It will decrease the gin trash dust, retard its burning, and decrease the ignition of dust in grain elevators. Research is completed with a wind tunnel, testing different types of blowing/airborne dust; a smoke testing chamber, testing burning gin trash; a bioaerosol chamber, testing airborne fungal spores; and, an explosion chamber, testing grain elevator dust. Collagen gelatin hydrolysate is tested as a possible control in each test. Results show the collagen gelatin hydrolysate significantly decreases the amount of airborne dust particles and fungal spores. It also retards the burning of gin trash and stops explosions caused by airborne grain elevator dust. In conclusion, collagen gelatin hydrolysate, a leather by-product, effectively suppresses dust. This leather by-product could be mixed with soil to decrease the amount of wind erosion; decrease the amount of dust and fungal spores suspended in the air; and retard the burning of gin trash and prevent grain elevator dust explosions, making it a versatile solution for serious agriculture problems. This solution will help to protect our most valuable natural resource, the soil; keep our air clean; and help solve the environmental problem of waste disposal.<br><br><br>

SEISMIC AND PETROGRAPHIC ANALYSES OF THE VICTORIA ISLAND STRUCTURE (PHASE II)
Samuel Charles Spevack
Grossmont Middle College High School, El Cajon, California, United States

In 2005, the analyst completed a study of 3D seismic and well data in the Sacramento basin that revealed a Middle Eocene circular, ~5500 meter diameter feature buried 1,490-1,600 m below sea level. The dimensions of this structure compared favorably to those of known complex impact craters. The main purpose of the current phase of the study was to acquire the direct evidence of shock metamorphism needed to confirm an impact origin. Samples were taken from the two wells directly within the structure. Thin sections were made of samples having significant quartz grain populations. Using a petrographic microscope, quartz grains were searched for lineation patterns similar to planar deformation features (PDFs). Quartz grains with potential PDFs were further examined under a universal stage microscope to measure the angle of the possible PDF with respect to the mineral’s c-axis to confirm whether its Miller index was similar to known PDFs. Thousands of likely quartz grains were examined and a total of nineteen grains with potential PDFs were found, all within 40 meters of the seismically identified impact surface. Thirty-one of thirty-three planar microstructures that were found had indices similar to known PDFs. Additional seismic mapping was also done for the current study, including a depth structure map of a horizon below the potential impact that helped to demonstrate the rootless nature of the structure. These maps and the presence of likely PDFs in quartz grains significantly increase the probability that this structure does have an impact origin.

CHEMICAL ASPECTS OF THE IMPACT PROCESS
Terik Daly
Oak Grove High School, San Jose California, USA

Impact cratering is the most important process affecting the surfaces of solid bodies in the Solar System. Though the physics of the impact process are characterized, its chemical aspects remain poorly understood.<br><br> Previously (Daly 2005, 2006) I experimentally-induced impact events using a two-stage light gas gun and studied the resulting chemical and physical changes. This work led to the development of a conceptual model describing principles governing the chemistry of the impact process. My model predicted that the chemical changes occurring during the impact process happen primarily in shock-induced melt veins.<br><br> This year, my model’s hypotheses were tested by studying the spatial distribution of trace elements in impacted samples using a spectral high-resolution ion microprobe with reverse geometry (SHIMP-RG). To eliminate sample-preparation-induced artifacts, I developed a novel technique to prepare impactite samples for SHRIMP-RG analysis. Glow discharge mass spectrometry (GDMS) analyses of the projectiles used to induce the impact events were also conducted to test my model. The effort included a statistical analysis of over 5,000 inter-elemental ratios.<br><br> Analysis of the data provides substantial evidence supporting my model, confirming the composition of the melt veins is different from the composition of the surrounding matrix. The concentrations of Cu, Zn, and, particularly Ni, are distributed heterogeneously, with significantly higher concentrations found in the melt veins than in the bulk target material. This work represents the first application of the SHRIMP-RG technique to chemical studies of the impact process and demonstrates the applicability and usefulness of this approach to studying impact chemistry.

FLOOD AID: A NEW ADVANCED SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES EMERGENCY FLOOD PROTECTION
Kimberly Ann Potter
Oak Ridge High School, Conroe, TX, US

Flooding is a major problem and can occur when a levee breaks. Because weight is needed to stop the floodwaters, sandbags are used to plug holes if access is available. By using the properties of water and its proximity to the threatened flood areas, an optimal barrier can be created to protect the levee system. After studying several flooded areas, it was observed that water might be useful in finding a new solution. <br><br> Thickening agents, which provide body and increase stability are added to mixtures to increase viscosity. A search was conducted to learn about the properties of commercially sold thickening agents, looking for agents with high viscosities and cohesiveness at low concentrations.<br><br> Sixteen compounds with various thickening agents were created and tested for cohesiveness and viscosity. Carbopol Ultrez20 was determined to be the best compound with good thickness, strong cohesiveness - bonding to itself, leaves and dirt. The experiments showed that by changing the properties of water, it can be used as a barrier against water (itself) and could provide additional protection to a levee system. <br><br> Application research was conducted by studying pumping devices that could mix water with the compound while in the transport vehicle. Carbopol Ultrez20 could be dispersed by using a pumping system within the transport vehicle with tubes to “draw up” floodwaters, combining the water with the compound and dispersing on top of levee. When compared to using sandbags, flying in the compound and adding water on-site would be less weight, effort and costs.<br><br>

ON SHAKY GROUND: PROBING PROXIMAL SEISMITES WITHIN THE EPICENTER OF A CRETACEOUS EARTHQUAKE IN GRAND STAIRCASE-ESCALANTE NATIONAL MONUMENT, UTAH
Hannah Louise Wolf
Parkland High School, Allentown, PA, United States of America

A comprehensive study was undertaken to detail seismites, differentiate seismic zones, and understand the responses of sediments to seismic activity within the Upper Cretaceous capping sandstone member of the Wahweap Formation in Grand Staircase – Escalante National Monument, Utah. <br><br> Stratigraphic sections were logged at various locations in the field. Seismites were identified and measured throughout the study area, and were then correlated between geologic sections. Orientations of the seismites were recorded and compared spatially. At the region of highest seismic intensity, sections were measured, photomosaics were taken, and line-drawings were completed with meter grid to interpret seismic features.<br><br> Conclusions: 1) Seismite intensity distribution maps of the new data highlight a regional trend of higher intensity to the northwest of the study area. Additional fold axis measurements reveal northeast to south-trending features. 2) The capping sandstone member can be subdivided into three zones based on the presence or absence of seismites; indicating two separate seismic events. The intensity maps indicate a local source as the origin for the first seismic event. The second seismic event points to a distant northwestern source. 3) Closer examination of a fault tipline at the upper and capping sandstone member contact indicates the generation of a sag pond during fault movement. 4) Epicenter materials responded to cyclic seismic waves differently according to their rheology; producing megaloads, arrows, and icicle structures. These features have not been reported in literature examining modern seismic settings. Future work will include field and laboratory examination of the mechanisms that generated laminations during the seismic shocks.<br><br>

SOGGY SOIL OR DAMP DIRT?
Alesha E. Dempsey
Boone Grove High School, Valparaiso, IN

The purpose of this project was to determine which soil type retained the most water. The water content of soils is determined by pore space rather than texture. Small pores hold water well. However, large, interconnected pores help water and air to move freely into and out of the soil. It was hypothesized that soil containing clay would have the best water retaining properties due to the closely packed nature of the particles.<br><br> Peat, sandy soil, clay, potting soil, and topsoil were tested. A 120 milliliter sample of each type was placed in a strainer lined with cheesecloth. The strainer was suspended over a bowl. 480 milliliters of water was added to the soil sample. The amount of water collecting in the bowl was measured and the volume was subtracted from the original volume to determine the amount retained in the soil. The procedure was repeated for each soil type.<br><br>The average amount of water retained was calculated for each type of soil. Results revealed that the clay did retain the most water at 143 milliliters and sand retained the least with 70 milliliters.<br><br> The results of this experiment could provide useful information in determining the appropriate type of soil to provide specific plants with an optimal amount of water.<br><br>

HOW DO LANTHANIDES AFFECT CALCITE CRYSTAL GROWTH DURING A SIMULATED MICRO-GRAVITY ENVIRONMENT?
Jordan Michael Badeaux
John Curtis Christian School; River Ridge, LA; USA

This experiment was aimed at creating Lanthanide-Calcite crystals in a microgravity environment (gel suspension) to test how the Lanthanides affected the growth of Calcium Chloride. Crystals were grown by diffusing sodium carbonate into a Calcium Chloride gel solution mixed with different combinations of Lanthanum Nitrate, Cerium Nitrate, Neodymium Nitrate, Europium Nitrate, and Dysprosium Nitrate to create 1 control sample and 10 unique sample combinations. After the crystals were grown and recovered, they were carbon coated and scanned with the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Crystals from each batch were contained in a sample mount prior to carbon coating to be cross-sectioned and polished for interior analysis. Data collected from the SEM was recorded and saved as bitmaps.<br><br> The greatest change in the calcite crystals was found in all of the samples containing Neodymium. This Lanthanide seemed to greatly affect the morphology of calcite. Lanthanum was the only other element to have a significantly different reaction from the others. Lanthanum refused to substitute or diffuse into the main crystal body and instead formed isolated spheres inside pits and holes within the crystal.<br><br> My data partially supported my hypothesis because the crystal morphology was altered but little or no diffusion or zoning (substitution in bands) took place. Besides with Neodymium and Lanthanum, little or minor changes were made to the calcite morphology. Based on my research, I learned that minerals of similar qualities don’t necessarily share the same crystal habits. Based on my experience, I learned how to operate a Scanning Electron Microscope.<br><br>

CONVECTION: EARTH'S DRIVING MECHANISM
Giovanni Emmanuel Hinojosa
J.B. Alexander High School, Laredo TX, United States

The theory of plate tectonics explains many natural processes, such as the formation of volcanoes, the occurrence of earthquakes, mountain building, and continental drift. The driving mechanism of plate tectonics is mantle convection, which shows up on the surface in the form of moving continental plates, or continental drift. Mantle convection broke up the super continent Pangaea about 200 million years ago.<br><br> In this experiment, a model was used to show the effect that convection has on the movement of Earth’s continental plates. The model consisted of a viscous fluid (corn syrup) in a tank heated from below by a hot plate to simulate conditions in the Earth’s mantle. To simulate the tectonic plates, plastic cut outs of the continents making up Pangaea were placed on the surface of the corn syrup. As the corn syrup was heated, buoyancy increased and currents formed. When the heated corn syrup reached the surface, it exerted a force on the “plates”, making them move. The distance that the “plates” moved (displacement) was measured through photographs taken in one-minute intervals. With these measurements, the velocities of the “plates” in the tank were calculated.<br><br> The highest velocity in the experiment was 0.42 cm/min, whereas on Earth typical plate velocities are about 5 to 10 cm/year, a factor of 20,000 times slower on Earth than the model tested. Convection, the mechanism that drives plate tectonics on Earth, was also the driving force in this model. Application of these results will aid in the prediction of plate movements. <br><br>

WAVES OF DESTRUCTION; CALCULATING AND VALIDATING MULTIPLE WAVE INUNDATION OF SUBMERGENT PLAINS
NATHAN TYLER HASBROOK, SCOTT EDWARD HASBROOK
Moore High School, Moore, Oklahoma, USA

This experiment was devised to test how multiple wave inundation would differ from single wave inundation and how this experiment would impact the mathematical formulas developed from the single wave experiments. In addition, the structured laboratory experimental data and formulas were compared to the results of actual world wave events and the mathematical formulas revised. <br><br> In order to achieve practical application and real world validation our experimental model demanded the testing of multiple waves. This experiment is designed to test this effect by simulating wave trains, consisting of ten consecutive waves, on varying coastal topographies. Inundation tests were conducted using five different topographical regions and four different simulated tsunami wave heights. Multiple wave tests were completed and the data was analyzed and compared to the single wave inundation formulas. The formulas were modified to show accurate trend results for the multiple wave inundations. One formula was developed which has three rules for practical application: D = [( [ (EL) + (WH) ] ÷ 4) ÷ 3.5] SA<br><br>(D=Inundation Distance (feet); EL=Elevation Factor (feet); WH=Wave Height (feet); SA=Scale Adjustment)<br><br> Formula Application Rules: Flat: EL=0; WH=height; SA= x10 Valley: EL=negative elevation; WH=height; SA= x3 Rise: EL=1/positive elevation; WH=height, add to elevation after division of 4.0 and 3.5 functions; SA= ÷ 6 To validate our experimental results we obtained submergent plain inundation data from actual world events and made formula modifications. This new formula, based upon our experimental data, but modified to accurately reflect actual wave inundation, now accurately identifies coastal safety zones. <br><br>

WEATHER STATION: PROGNOSIS
Tomas Korfant, Peter Gonda
Gymnázium Krompachy, Krompachy, Slovakia

Our project is about our own Weather Station and Weather prognosis. We made this station in a small village Olcnava near Krompachy. The station is two meters above the ground and it is while. The initial idea was to discover how the weather influences pressure, temperature, humidity, wind, speed of wind, wind direction, rainfall, cloudiness … In the middle Europe the conditions for weather forecast are very bad, because Polar front crosses through middle Europe. That is why cyclone and anticyclone change here. Wind blows from places with higher pressure to places with lower pressure. The forecast are made from synoptic map, which are made from meteorological pictures, aerological measurements and from weather station.<br><br>We made own machines (instruments) from accessible things for example barometer, anemometer, rainguage. We measured values of these instruments three times a day. In the morning at 6:30 a.m., in the afternoon at 3:30 p.m. and at night at 7:00 p.m. We inscribed it into the table and we specified minimal and maximal temperature for twelve days. From this table we made graphs, for example histogram, pressure graph and so on. We acquired a lot of information about weather from year 2005 and we discovered that year 2006 was hotter then year 2005.<br><br>From this information we made own program which determines what the weather is like according the pressure. This program was made in C++ Builder.<br><br>A lot of people do not know how determine weather hence we were working on this project.<br><br>

TSUNAMI: A COMPARISON OF BORE RUN-UP AND UNBROKEN INUNDATIONS UPON IMPACT WITH CONSISTANCY IN FOCAL DISTANCE AND TRANSOCEANIC VELOCITY
Michael Reed Glawe
Cathedral High School, New Ulm, MN

With a possible earthquake threat from the North American plate that would create tsunami activity with the African and South American Convergent boundaries, east coastal cities prepare for possible signs of a tsunami. Norfolk, Virginia along with many other Chesapeake Bay cities, have been approved as a "TsunamiReady" city by the National Weather Service. However, safety regulations only include tsunami hazard signs, tips on how to notice signs of a tsunami, and evacuation plans.<br><br> With a custom wave generator and a model of the Chesapeake Bay area, the comparison of unbroken tsunamis and broken tsunami heights was recorded, along with velocity, focal distance, and bore run-up distance. The results proved the hypothesis, "An unbroken inundation will have greater wave generation", to be true. In normal waves, there is a trochoidal effect which is Von Arx's Theory, I discovered something similar to a double trochoidal, a layered circulation of water. With the initial impact wave on top, and a secondary wave below, the tsunami built in energy (and, eventually, in size) essentially from two waves propagating on top of each other. Along with Newton's Theory of elongation in waves, I have produced a plausible aspect to tsunami physics, the double trochoidal curve.<br><br> In conclusion, the Chesapeake Bay area is not prepared to prevent the destruction a tsunami wave will produce. Regions that would be most affected were the Norfolk area and up towards the D.C. suburbs. Down coast would also greatly affected.

THE MARVELOUS MAGNETOSPHERE III
Gavin Gregory Reen
La Plata High School, La Plata, MD

The objective of this experiment was to effectively identify, isolate, quantify, and validate a pattern in the diurnal magnetic fluctuations of the Earth’s magnetic field. In order to accomplish this, two identical magnetometers were built. The basic operational principle of the magnetometer was as follows: An airtight glass case housed a nylon filament, which was vertically positioned from the top of the case to the bottom of the case. Attached to this filament was a pair of rare earth magnets, which were adhered back to back, suspended upon the nylon filament. This construction allowed the magnets to rotate freely upon a single axis in response to changes in the surrounding magnetic field. Two tiny mirror chips were attached to either side of the filament, and a laser was directed upon the mirrors, which provided an accurate visual representation of the magnetic fluctuations. A circuit was dually connected to both a position detector (monitoring the location of the laser spot) and a Helmholtz pair (through which an electrical current was sent relative to the declination of the laser spot, nulling the movement of the rare earth magnets). By enclosing both assemblies in grounded metal trashcans, the apparatuses were protected from the elements and external magnetic interferences. After twenty eight days, it was found that there were consistent increases in magnetic readings especially at midday. This conformed to a well-established and scientifically identifiable pattern, which has been tested extensively by geophysicists and other researchers, and validated the hypothesis and demonstrated a correlation between time of day and magnetic activity.

QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THETA-E DATA AND SEVERE WEATHER SYSTEMS
Michael William Kirlin
Carroll High School, Dayton, OH

The goal of this project is to quantitatively analyze the usage of atmospheric Theta-E values (Equivalent Potential Temperatures), and design a CAPSIM (Atmospheric CAP SImulation Modifier) in order to more accurately represent the instability in the atmosphere at any given pressure level. For this project the WDSS-II was obtained from the National Severe Storms Lab. The analysis of the Theta-E (Equivalent Potential Temperature) data began with three levels of quantitative analysis including regression analysis, correlation analysis, and analysis of variance. Correlation analysis related Theta-E levels to corresponding elements in the atmosphere including the entropy of moist air showing a direct proportion, regression analysis performed geometrically gave way to the basis for the CAPSIM as a pressure adjusting mechanism, while the ANOVA results reaffirmed the plausibility of CAPSIM being used over a wide area forecast. During the retrospective study using CAPSIM dating back to June 1, 2002, CAPSIM re-ran twice a day observation data and recalculated Theta-E levels comparing them to official records. At this time, CAPSIM influenced Theta-E data shows a strong improvement in making a single variable forecast for a severe weather event. A progressive study which is now being conducted is in place to confirm the meteorological accuracy and to further analyze atmospheric conditions on a day to day basis.

THE GREEN HOUSE EFFECT
Aly Bee Xiong
John A. Johnson High School, St. Paul, MN

The purpose of this experiment was to prove a mass amount of CO2 in the atmosphere causes an increase in temperature and decrease in time. The temperature of the experiment actually stayed constant through out an entire trial, but each trial (A, B, and C) did have a shorter time span than its previous trial.<br><br>How long the trial was and their temperature was observed by the melting rate of an ice cubed within a closed container. The first trial (A) is to observe the normal melting rate of an ice cube with out adding any amounts of CO2. In trials B and C, dry ice, which is the substantial CO2 used in this experiment, was added in amounts of 5% and 10% from the original amounts.<br><br>Trial A had a time average of about 11 minutes, trial B (5%) had an average of about 10 minutes, and trial C (10%) had an average of 9 minutes and 30 seconds. This is a contribution to the fact that the more carbon dioxide within the atmosphere does cause a change in time, but not actually temperature itself.

X-RAY FLUORESCENCE OF ARCHEOLOGICAL SAMPLES: HOW STANDARD LABELING TECHNIQUES AFFECT DATA INTERPRETATION
Anna Rose Johnson
Louisiana School for Math, Science and the Arts, Natchitoches, LA

X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) is a frequently used method for analyzing the elemental composition of materials. It is popular with archaeologists because the results are obtained quickly without damage to the artifact. Also common in archaeology is the use of regular nail polish or other liquids for labeling artifacts. This is an accepted and widely used practice as described on the website for the Louisiana Division of Archaeology. This labeling method is employed by the National Center for Preservation Technology and Training (NCPTT) for Native American and African American pottery shards and other artifacts. The goal of this project was to determine if Native American pottery could be chemically distinguished from African American pottery. During this research many of the labeled pottery shards were so small that data could not be collected from a part of a shard without also collecting data from the label-covered area. Because of this some shards contained higher amounts of various elements that their unlabeled counterparts did not exhibit. Immediately the labeling chemicals were suspected as the source of the increased concentrations. Unfortunately archaeologists collecting artifacts have never considered this a problem since no reference in the literature can be found. Therefore the objective of this project changed. I then began to investigate how much nail polish and other labeling compounds affect the XRF data, and whether removing the labels excises all labeling chemicals from the artifacts. I found that the three labeling compounds tested included much higher percentages of two elements: titanium, which is usually not found in pottery and sulfur. Labeled artifacts before washing showed a minimum of a 1000% increase in these elements over unlabeled samples and at least a 300% increase after washing. Therefore accepted labeling techniques cannot be employed if quantitative elemental results are desired. Lastly, I discuss alternative labeling techniques and how these prevent artifact contamination.

ANALYZING ARCTIC SOLAR FLUX AND ICE EXTENT LOSS PROJECTIONS
Gwyneth R. Glissmann
Peak to Peak Charter School, Lafayette, CO

This project in its existent form is the result of analyzing Arctic ice extent projections to determine whether highly reflective white platforms would reduce absorbed solar incidence to mitigate the intensified greenhouse effect. Previous research showed benefit in using platforms in the equatorial region, but platform size requirements diminished their practicality. Utilizing satellite data, this project demonstrated that September ice extent was significantly below the standard deviation of 16 IPCC computer models used to predict Arctic conditions. Applying a trend analysis, 2035 is projected as the year when the Arctic will be seasonally ice-free. <br><br>A worst-case calculation was used to investigate the correlation between the diminishing ice extent and solar incidence absorbed by the ocean. Results showed a decline between 1979 and 2006 in ice extent, while absorbed solar incidence was constant. This indicates melting was not occurring due to absorbed heat. The lack of correlation between absorbed solar incidence and ice melting does not support highly reflective white platforms. <br><br>In September 2006, a significant spike in absorbed heat occurred. Melting appears to have happened earlier, possibly due to ice thinning. This may be the cause for the considerable loss of ice extent in 2007; the greatest recorded in 30 years. Ostensibly, ocean temperature is now contributing to significant melting and with ice loss occurring earlier in the summer, a feedback loop between melting ice and ocean temperature may now lead to an ice-free Arctic. Years of research are required to establish this relationship; however, the Arctic has already passed the point at which it could have recovered.<br><br>

ATMOSPHERIC TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY TO THE EDGE OF SPACE
Molly Elaine Kennon
Cross County High School, Cherry Valley, AR

The Arkansas BalloonSAT program has successfully launched and recovered six high altitude balloons and their payloads vehicles. My research project utilized archival data collected from the previous year’s project (late fall), March 24, 2007 (spring), July 28, 2007 (summer), and September 29, 2007 (fall). I have been an active member of this program for all of these flights and have worked with my school’s balloon and rocket club in the construction of payload boxes. I included a HOBO data logger and a digital camera in all four flights included in this study. Using data from each launch I compared the temperature and absolute humidity at the following altitudes: at the surface, 3.05 km (10,000 ft.), 6.1 km (20,000 ft.), 9.1 km (30,000 ft.), 12.2 km (40,000 ft.), 15.8 (52,000 ft.) (approximate altitude of the boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere the tropopause), and at maximum altitude (for most flights approximately 26.5 km—87,000 ft.). BOXCAR software was utilized to analyze this data. The goal of this research project was to look for correlations between the seasons of the year and temperature/humidity changes at the specific levels of the atmosphere listed above. Temperature decreased with altitude and then increased as the vehicles traveled into the lower stratosphere, however at the specific selected altitudes up to the tropopause the recorded temperature was progressively higher from the late fall flight to the highest temperatures recorded in the early fall flight. The absolute humidity as a whole increased late fall through spring, summer, and early fall launches at the 3.05 km and 6.1 km.

NORTH AMERICAN PLATE MIGRATION ANALYSIS USING AZIMUTHAL SHIFTS AT THE BIGHORN MEDICINE WHEEL
Curtis Jeffrey Johnson
Greybull High School, Greybull, WY

Medicine wheels can be found all over the world. The wheels are used for sacred places for many different Indian tribes. They are used primarily for the determination of the beginning of important seasons. The Plains Indians used the Bighorn Medicine wheel to determine when to come down from high elevations to avoid snow. Some wheels were also used as burial grounds or to mark a special day in history. At times, they also point to other medicine wheels. The Plains Indians were said to have built the Bighorn Medicine Wheel 300-800 years ago. It has been used and maintained by many other groups since then. The center cairn is the oldest cairn with excavations showing extensions below the wheel that have been covered by wind blown dust and other particles.<br><br> Aerial maps of the Medicine Wheel and the surrounding area were acquired. Using the program ArcMap, different layers were added to the map to obtain the best resolution. Using Starry Night Pro, azimuth degree readings of where the summer solstice rises and sets were found. This same program was used to find an individual star’s azimuth readings. This process will generate the exact point where the stars and sun are rising now.<br><br> The rate of movement can be determined by knowing that radiometric dating of the medicine wheel indicates an age of 808 years. The equation (Km medicine wheel moved (44.4)/age of medicine wheel in yrs (808))(1 cm/1.0x10-5km) can be applied to this situation. Calculations of 44 km/808 yrs= about .05, which indicates a movement rate of about 50 m/yr. Plate motion before the 1900s may have been faster. Since there is a lack of paleoplate motion data, assumptions that plate motion is not uniform can be made. The Medicine wheel may be older than 808 years old. The oldest known human fossil in North America is about 50,000 years old. If the Medicine Wheel was created around this time and the low end of our error is used, the Medicine Wheel would have averaged about 85cm/yr. By knowing that the Medicine Wheel moved about 42.5 km after error analysis, taking 42.5 km/50,000 yrs= about .00084 km/yr. After a conversion to centimeters= about 85 cm/yr.

EFFECTS OF FIRE ON SOIL CHEMISTRY OVER TIME
Ahna Murphy McKee
Pinedale High School, Pinedale, WY

Historically and very recently, many fires have feasted on the sagebrush-grass habitats and soils surrounding Pinedale, Wyoming. Multiple studies have focused on the re-growth of vegetation after fires; however, very little research was found on the changes over time of the soil affected by theses fires. Because soil is important to vegetation, a chemical study of these burn soils was conducted. Studying the soil changes over time after a burn is important to establish the effects that fire has to determine plant re-growth.<br><br> Testing soil chemistry levels of fire burn areas brought forth question such as: How do soil areas which have been burned historically compare to recent fire burn areas? Does Succession over time effect soil chemistry levels of different burn areas? <br><br> Field collections of soil samples made along standardized transects in areas burned in 2007, 1996, 1988, and non-burned Control, all within 3 miles of each other in similar glacial moraine soils. The soils were then tested for phosphorus, potassium, nitrogen, and pH levels, according to a commercial kit.<br><br> Result showed that when comparing the most recently burned soil to the more historically burned, and the control, there were differences in soil chemistry components, especially phosphorus levels.<br><br> The soil is changed by fire, and then continues to change over time after a burn. Fire’s effects on the soil chemistry will definitely affect the plant re-growth and re-establishment of the sagebrush-grass habitat.

MONTANA EVIDENCE OF AN EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL IMPACT EVENT THAT LED TO THE EXTINCTION OF THE MAMMOTHS IN NORTH AMERICA
Katelyn Elizabeth Gibbs
Great Falls High School, Great Falls, MT

My project was to find evidence in Montana for an extra-terrestrial impact event that was reported in North America. I located the mammoth fossil site for the last mammoths in Montana, which were dated at 11,500 radio carbon or about 12,900 calendar years. I found evidence at this site for an extra-terrestrial impact that could have caused the extinction of mammoths. The mammoth remains were found in an organic rich layer called the Black Mat. The Black Mat contains charcoal (evidence for forest fire), black carbon glass (evidence for high temperature), dead plant material (evidence for a dried up pond) and tiny fragments of elemental iron, (which were un-rusted). The iron particles provide direct evidence for extra-terrestrial origin when examined with the scanning electron microscope: fusion crust (formed by melting the surface when particles came through the atmosphere at high speed), flow lines (formed by melt moving along the fragment) and micro-craters (formed by impact of other particles on the iron fragments). Mammoth tusks contain rust spots consistent with iron particles that were embedded and then rusted out. I also found the spherules of black carbon glass with an internal glass foam structure that have been found at other No. American sites for this impact event. I concluded that there is evidence in Montana for an impact event that caused the extinction of mammoths and other large Ice-Age mammals.

Recent discoveries point to a tsunami event in the New York metropolitan area stretching hundreds of meters inland from the Great South Bay approximately 2300 years ago. The presence of impact ejecta in the tsunami deposit layer suggests that an oceanic impact is the source of the tsunami. The impact ejecta were located by sampling the tsunami layer and using optical microscopy. Prospective ejecta were further examined with a combination of scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Multiple nearly pure carbon impact spherules, shock-metamorphosed ilmenite breccia, feldspar with Brazil twins, and possible shocked quartz are present in the tsunami layer. The ejecta layers, sampled from beneath the Hudson River near Piermont, NY, over twenty kilometers north of the George Washington Bridge, vary in thickness from 10 to 200 centimeters, suggesting a proximal impact source for the tsunami. Furthermore, the New York metropolitan area lacks the extreme seismic and volcanic activity that might produce similar results, ruling out those possibilities and leaving a hypervelocity bolide impact as the only possible source for the ejecta and the tsunami.

REPLICATION OF AMAZONIAN DARK EARTHS IN RELATION TO NUTRIENT RETENTION IN LEACHING
Erin Elizabeth Perry
Elko High School, Elko, NV

Amazonian dark earths were created between 500 to 3000 years ago by slash and char agriculture. Crop yields today are 800% higher than the surrounding soils due to resistance to nutrient leaching. The purpose of this study is to create a replication method of Amazonian dark earths that includes pyrolysis as well as mimics the formation of midden created by North American Indians. Charcoal was created using various types of methods and biomass types. The charcoal was mixed with soil, fish hydrolysate, bone meal, blood meal, corn oil and manure, similar to leftovers from an Indian campsite. The mixture was placed in leaching columns, receiving an equivalent amount of water to one year of Amazonian precipitation. Atomic emission spectrometry was used to measure nutrient levels in the resulting soils. pH tests showed the charcoal amended soils had a pH of six, compared to the original soil that had a pH of nine. Nutrient levels were higher in the original soils, due to the nutrients becoming chemically immobile due to the low hydrogen concentration and formed insoluble compounds with calcium iron and aluminum, making nutrients unavailable to plants. The addition of charcoal provided humic acid produced during pyrolysis. Acidification resulted in the release of cations from the cation exchange surfaces providing areas for potassium, calcium and magnesium to bond. In charcoal added soils, where nutrients were released, additives resulted in increased potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, and nitrate levels, especially in the sample with charcoal made from shrub material undergoing pyrolysis.

A NEW EARTH MAGNETIC FIELD CAUSE PATTERN OF THE SAME DIRECTION MULTI-VORTICES IN THE OUTER CORE AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES
Yuyang Wang
Jilin Provincial Experimental School, Changchun, Jilin, CHINA

The key to the subject is to do a further research on the reason and law of the formation and changes of the earth magnetic field.Inspired by the Deep Impact conducted by America and the vortex clouds of the same direction which circle over the Antarctica.I put forward the same direction arrangement pattern of the earth outer core indicating how the multi-vortices electromagnetic folding led to the formation of the earth magnetic field.At the same time,I used six groups of virtual experiments to do a detailed research on the increase,decrease,reverse,polar wandering of the earth magnetic field and the polar drifting, resulting from the turning and sudden change of the earth crust-mantle,the reason for the formation of the non- dipole field.<br><br> The experiments indicate that the collision of the earth and other planets is the direct reason for the turning and sudden change of the earth crust-mantle. Under the influence of the viscous effect,it can cause the changes of the state of the outer core vortices resulting in the formation of the earth magnetic field.<br><br> This research enriches the theory of the earth magnetic field further,and it gives a better explanation of the magnetic states of the eight planets in the solar system and also it gives a new explanation of the ancient creatures explosion.Meanwhile,it renews the thinking of the abnormal phenomena in the partial of the earth.It provides mankind with reference to protect the earth.

IS EARTH AN EXTRASOLAR PLANET?
Samantha Emily Keith
Weber High School, Pleasant View, UT

Radial velocity is used to discover extrasolar planets from Earth, implying that other civilizations on extrasolar planets could use the same technology to detect Earth. This project used equations describing Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation, Centripetal Force, and Moment of Inertia, to write a software program that calculated the center of gravity of an n-body system and then created radial velocity graphs of extrasolar systems.<br><br>Several properties of radial velocity graphs - including orbital period, orbital radius, and maximum radial velocity - were compared to determine what makes a system detectable. Either the radial velocities were very high or the periods of the planets were clearly detectable in the radial velocity graphs. The total radial velocity of our solar system was comparatively low, and the periods of the planets were almost impossible to distinguish. After comparing the radial velocity graphs of extrasolar systems and our solar system, it was determined the Earth is not detectable from outer space using radial velocity. This project is applicable in the real world, because when the theory and practice of discovering extrasolar planets is sensitive enough to be able to detect Earth, that technology can be applied to detect life-sustaining planets.

WATER SHAPES THE DESERT, YEAR TWO: DOES A 1941 FLOOD DIVERSION CONSTRUCTED ON FURNACE CREEK WASH THAT RE-DIRECTS SURFACE WATER (PRECIPITATION) DOWN GOWER GULCH AFFECT LOCAL VEGETATION?
Christopher John Heslop
Northern Nevada Home School, Incline Village, NV

The continuation of my research project, Water Shapes the Desert, focuses on the effects to vegetation on the Furnace Creek and Gower Gulch Alluvial Fans caused by a 1941 flood diversion built to re-direct surface water down Gower Gulch in Death Valley National Park. I discovered re-directing surface water had little effect to the mesquite tree population on the Furnace Creek fan, but had a dramatic effect to vegetation on the Gower Gulch fan due to increase volume and velocity of water channeled down the gulch carrying increased amounts of alluvium scouring vegetation on the active portion of this fan.<br><br> Through historical USGS aerial photographs and Google Earth, mesquite trees were counted on the Furnace Creek fan, followed by field observations. Since 1948, the population of the mesquite is stable leading to conclude the mesquite depend on another source of groundwater other than the Furnace Creek Wash.<br><br> Vegetation was charted on the Gower Gulch fan using Google Earth, followed by field observations. Increased amounts of water carrying greater volumes of alluvium have either scoured or covered vegetation with a thick mud to inhibit vegetation growth along the active portion of the fan dissipating its effects towards the toe of the fan.<br><br> The contributions of this project are two-fold. First, predicting environmental responses to flood prone areas and to flood control methods. Secondly, looks at responses to the environment to potential climate changes.

DIGGING FOR ANSWERS, III: AN ANALYSIS SOIL AMENDMENTS AND PERCOLATION
Robert Dee Sanderlin
Drew Central High School, Monticello, AR 71655, AR

Ash is a good source of potassium, phosphorus, magnesium and aluminum, which improves plant production. Research of high temperatures on soil after fires has proven to decrease water infiltration into soils and does not pose environmental problems. However, limited research has been done on ashes added to soil without the increase in temperature<br><br> Manure amendments to soil revealed little effect on the Tippah Silt Loam's water holding capacity. This year's research objective is to determine the effect of wood ash and leaf ash on the water holding capacity of the Tippah Silt Loam soil with a slow percolation rate. Also, to determine the effect of leaf ash on the growth of plants (Snapdragon-Antirrhinum majus). The study included monitoring of pH, Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium in the control soil and variable soils with added ash amendments. The Tippah Silt Loam was collected from the same site as the previous years, which has proven to have a slow percolation rate. Five tests were conducted on the water holding capacity, pH levels, Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium. The tests for pH, N, P, and K using a LaMotte Soil Testing kit were conducted at the school lab under the supervision of the chemistry teacher.<br><br> The results did not agree with the hypothesis the leaf ash did not increase the absorbability of the soil. The variable soil did not result in increasing the soils pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels. The research did prove to have a greater effect on the Snapdragon seedlings, the growth was higher for the ash soil than the plain control soil by an average of .78cm. Erosion reduces the productivity of soils by decreasing the available water holding capacity, if ash can enhance plant growth, the plants will increase the water holding capacity.

CHANGES IN LAKE SUPERIOR ICE COVER AT BAYFIELD, WISCONSIN
Forrest Larsen Howk
Bayfield High School, Bayfield, WI

The purpose of this research was to determine if there has been a change in the duration of ice cover of Bayfield harbor over the past 150 years. Data was gathered recording the opening and closing of navigation in Bayfield Wisconsin from 1856-2007. Data for the period 1964-2007 came from the Madeline Island Ferry Line and the Island Gazette. The data from 1857-1964 was then collected from issues of the Bayfield County Press preserved on microfilm. After the data set was completed, it was put into spreadsheet form using Microsoft Excel and then converted to graphs. The graphs indicate that the duration of ice cover on Lake Superior at Bayfield, Wisconsin has decreased over the past 150 years at the rate of approximately three days per decade or thirty-one days over the course of the past century. During the past 150 years, the date that the last boat is able to navigate in the Bayfield harbor indicates the onset of ice cover. This date has occurred an average of 1.6 days later every decade. Conversely, the date that the first boat is able to navigate in Bayfield harbor marking the break up of ice cover has come an average of 1.7 days earlier every decade. Although there is an overall trend of change in the past century and a half, the most dramatic changes have occurred more recently. Since 1975 the ice season has begun an average of 12.3 days later and ended 4.8 days earlier every decade.

THE MAN AND THE MOON
Ashley Michelle Weeks
Wagoner High School, Wagoner, OK

The purpose of this project was to see if moon phases really affected the rate of growth in leaf and root crops as is said by some old farmers. <br><br>The project's procedure was as follows: Till soil of garden, divide the area into 8 equal sections, divide each section into rows with 4 sections with the rows running north to south and 4 sections east to west. Use a 5ft long 1inch x 2inch board to line out a row 1/4 inches to 1/2 inches deep.<br><br>Label the rows with the proper plant type(Seven top turnips, Radish cherry bell, Spinach bloomsdale, Oak leaf lettuce). Spread seeds evenly throughtout the first row of the section evenly, cover with dirt and lightly compact with a garden hoe. Plant another round weekly for three weeks. Record weekly measurements of growth, and then calculate the rate of growth and how it varied during different lunar phases.<br><br> It was predicted that the full moon would have the greatest effect on leaf crops, and the new moon would have the greatest effect on root crops.<br><br>In conclusion neither the full moon nor the new moon had the greatest effect in growth rate in plants. The phase that had showed the greatest effect on growth rate in both leaf and root crops happened to the last quarter(or third quarter).

BOXING DAY TSUNAMI: THE LAST OF THE KNOCKOUTS? TESTING THE EFFECTS OF COASTAL CONFIGURATION AND SEAWALL DESIGNS ON TSUNAMI STRENGTH
Richa Thakur
Clark High School, Plano, TX

What if 300,000 lives could have been saved on December 26, 2004? The trends from this experiment can be used to create a world-wide warning system. Additionally, the novel seawall design can be used in tsunami-prone areas for protection.<br><br>The first purpose of the project is to determine the effects of coastal configuration on tsunami strength. It was believed that convex coasts, flat-sloped coasts, or gentle-ocean gradients would have the strongest tsunamis. The second purpose is to determine the ideal design and position of a seawall. It was hypothesized that the convex seawall (when far away from the coast and meeting the water’s surface) would be the most effective.<br><br>Molds were created from plaster for small-scaled testing. Three different sources – a solenoid, manual force, and a balloon – were used for the tsunami genesis.<br><br>The data showed that the strongest tsunamis form when a coast is relatively flat, convex, or gentle ocean-slopes. For example, there was almost a 400% increase in the inundation zone as the coast became flatter. Slightly adjusting the coastal factors makes an enormous difference in a tsunami’s strength. The convex seawall performed poorly compared to the other seawalls. Instead, a perforated seawall (researcher’s design) performed the best with an average inundation zone 60 percent less than its nearest performer. The ideal position for a seawall is away from the coast, meeting the surface of water. Additionally, a t-test showed that the means of each coast and seawall was statistically different with an overall confidence level of 99%.

MAPPING VENUS: THE USE OF MAGELLAN RADAR DATA TO DETERMINE THE OVERALL GEOLOGIC HISTORY OF A CIRCULAR LOW ON VENUS, HOW THE AREA VARIES IN SPACE AND TIME AS WELL AS IF THE LANDFORM FORMED IN AN ENDOGENITIC OR EXOGENETIC FASHION
Courtney Catherine Jackson
Cloquet Senior High School, Cloquet, MN

Magellan, a NASA space probe, collected high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data of Venus. Geologists use this digital data to create geologic maps of Venus’ surface. Can mapping a geologic feature on Venus be used to determine the overall geologic history, and the process(es) that led to its formation? High-resolution SAR images, and synthetic stereo images, using SAR and altimetry data, for data layers in a graphics program were used. Individual features such as wrinkle ridges, fractures, volcanoes, and small impact craters were mapped. Single layers were created for each feature. The hypothesis was that mapping a circular low can allow the determination of how the area varied in space and time as well as if the landform formed by endogenic or exogenic processes. A circular low is a descriptive term that describes the landform’s shape. They display a circular “amphitheater-shaped depression” (McDaniel and Hansen, 2005). A detailed geologic map of a circular low was constructed in order to unravel the geologic history, providing clues for its formation. The central low was associated with landslides, negative relief, a rough inner texture, and fractures that were not continuous. Four detailed landform construction hypotheses were tested: impact crater on weak crust, impact crater on normal crust, positive diapir, and negative diapir. The negative diapir hypothesis provides the best match of the features expected for a negative diaper, and therefore this hypothesis is the most plausible. By understanding what shaped Venus’s surface, scientists will also learn more about the forces that shaped Earth.

DOES WATER AROUND MELTING ARCTIC SEA ICE STRATIFY INTO HORIZONTAL THERMAL GRADIENTS THAT HELP TO INSULATE THE ICE FROM THE WARM OCEAN WATER?
Hank Jay Zwally
Centennial High School, Ellicott City, MD

Scientists are currnetly trying to determine why the arctic ice sheets are refreezing less and less every year. I hypothesized that due to the low thermal conductivity of water and the fresh water from the melting ice (in the arctic there is a basin of cold fresh water that floats above the main body), a horizontal thermal boundary is created between the warm ocean water and the cold, fresh water. If so, the loss of this boundary due to the extreeme melting every year, could help to explain the lack of winter refreeze. To test this hypothesis, an experiment was designed with a sheet of ice covering a portion of the surface of a body of salt water. The tray was placed in a controlled enviorment and exposed to a radiation source. The temperature of the water was colected at three seperate depths using nine thermocouples spaced one inch apart horizontally. The experiment had to be run twice at eache level verically and six times overall (ther were only enough thermocouples to do one level at a time). It was found that the temperatures of the water increased as they moved away from the ice and a large gradient was discovered, but once the ice reached a certain critical volume, the gradient disappeared rapidly. It was concluded that a horizontal and vertical thermal boundary was created between the warming water and the melt water from the ice.

GULF HYPOXIC ZONES: FORECASTING WITH MATHEMATICAL AND LABORATORY SIMULATIONS
Bonnie Joyce McLindon
St. Joseph's Academy, Baton Rouge, LA

The annual process of the formation of hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico was simulated in a laboratory microcosm to develop a laboratory protocol for predicting the magnitude of a hypoxic zone based on projected amounts of nutrients in the Mississippi River runoff. For the first stage, the addition of nitrogen and phosphorus to pond water caused high algal growth and oxygen production. In the second step, high dissolved oxygen levels showed continued proliferation of algae. In the third step, sunlight for photosynthesis was removed from the microcosm. A source of atmospheric oxygen was removed as well through the placement of sealing wax. After five days in the ‘no sunlight + no atmosphere’ conditions, the water had become representative of the hypoxic hypolimnion. Whether used together or individually, nitrogen or phosphorus caused hypoxic conditions of the natural waters b a factor of two to five times. The laboratory microcosm or mathematical model: <br><br>A x KR [C**-CE]= A x KT [CE-CH] + KRX x VH x CH<br><br>can be used to forecast the magnitude and extent of the toxicity of a hypoxic zone based on the projected addition of nutrients, temperature of the water, or lowest life sustaining level of dissolved oxygen in the hypolimnion. This mathematical model is a Lavoisier oxygen mass balances describing the rate and amount of oxygen diffusion through the water column and decomposing in the hypolimnion. The model does not account for the production of oxygen by algae in the epilimnion, therefore the C** value is an immeasurable value which accounts for this production. <br><br>These two procedures are now effective ways of predicting magnitude and toxicity of a hypoxic zone.

NUTRIENTS AND FERTILITY PROFILE OF ALBIZIA LEBBEK INFLUENCED SOILS
Katherine Ruiz
Colegio Radians, Cayey, PUERTO RICO

Worldwide deforestation had been a progressive process influenced by the demographic explosion, poor planning in the development and construction of cities and the economical activities such as agriculture and industrialization. For this increasing problem that endangers natural ecosystems, bioremediation seems to be a logical solution.<br><br>Albizia lebbek, a deciduous, leguminous tree and considered a weed and invader of abandoned lands, has shown in a number of limited studies to improve the quality of soils for grasslands and to accelerate the process of biodiversity on degraded lands. These seem to be secondary to its properties as a fodder tree and the nitrogen fixing ability of its root system as well as the stabilization of the soils. There are no studies examining other parameters of soil fertility such as nutrients, percent of organic matter, pH and cation exchange capacity. To explore the potential of Albizia lebbek to improve the quality and fertility of soils, a study was conducted in which several parameters that determine soil fertility were measured in soil samples taken in areas where A. lebbek is growing and were compared with measurements taken in areas not influenced by the tree. Paired samples in 4 different types of soils were collected in the field and sent to an agroforestry lab for analysis in addition to the ones conducted at the field. The lab specifically conducted tests on percent of organic matter, cation exchange capacity (CEC), estimated nitrogen release(ENR), soluble salts, pH, and nutrients such as calcium, potassium, magnesium, sodium and phosphorus.<br><br>The results showed a tendency of the tree to increase the percent of organic matter, ENR, calcium and potassium and to decrease the levels of magnesium and sodium. Only the decrease in magnesium and sodium levels have statistical significance (p<.05).This apparently is secondary to the small number of samples. In conclusion Albizia lebbek promised to have a potential to improve the fertility of degraded soils and can be a tool to help in the restoration of disturbed ecosystems.

THE EFFECTS OF GEOMAGNETIC STORMS ON GPS RECEIVERS
Ian Chan
Williams High School, Plano, TX

The GPS technology has been vastly improved over the last decade, but a completely accurate GPS receiver has yet to be developed. The most significant variable is geomagnetic storms in the ionosphere. These storms cause fluctuations in the total electron density of the ionosphere, causing delays in signal propagation between orbiting satellites and GPS receivers. The independent variables of geomagnetic storms activity and total electron density will be compared to the amount of standard deviation of a GPS receiver. <br><br> A Garmin 60 CSx receiver was obtained and placed in a fixed location for ten days. Over this period of time, periodical readings separated by and interval of at least three hours were taken. The longitude, latitude, and altitude were recorded during each reading with WAAS correction enabled and disabled. The standard coordinates were obtained from Google Earth, and it was compared to the experimental data to obtain the standard deviation. The data was then compared to the Kp and TEC values were obtained from the Space Weather Prediction Center website to generate a model to depict the correlation. <br><br> It was observed that as the Kp values increased, the amount of standard deviation observed was also increased, and quadratic equations were generated to model this relationship. There was no direct pattern observed between TEC and standard deviation. In future experiments, obtaining more data would allow for more accurate equations, and the slant TEC would be calculated instead of the vertical TEC as it would serve as a more accurate comparison.

OPERATION E.A.G.L.E.: ENHANCED ALABAMA GRAVITATIONAL LUNAR EFFECT
Rebecca Elaine England
Demopolis High School, Demopolis, AL

The purpose of OPERATION E.A.G.L.E. was to determine how far, if at all, the moon’s gravitational pull could be measured on Earth’s surfaces – in particular, Demopolis, Alabama. Success with this experiment led to the discovery of new methods of determining the surface height fluctuations that come as a result from earth tides. <br><br>This change in surface height was determined by recording satellite data on four significant dates: full moon, new moon, apogee, and perigee. Data was gathered using a dual-frequency Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver that collected satellite information at a collection rate of 10 seconds per reading. Data was then plugged into a positioning system to determine geoidal and ellipsoidal heights. It was here that surface height fluctuation was found to be less than an inch, raising suspicion of an anomaly in calculations. The earth tide factor had been removed during the process of analyzing the results, so a technique had to be applied to reenter it. A method was improvised to ensure that this crucial piece of information was considered in the final calculations.<br><br>The results at the finish of the project proved that there was a maximum surface height fluctuation of 9.12 inches. This fluctuation took place over a 10 day period. As an extension of the investigation, one might gather geoidal and surface heights simultaneously at separate locations considering the size of the land mass and the relative location to the ocean.

DARN IT! IT RAINED!
Sadie Jane Woodall
Aline-Cleo Public Schools, Aline, OK

Using an arena is an asset when exercising horses, riding and roping, if the ground is in good shape. However, when it rains, the ground becomes very muddy and impossible to use the arena. If the ground is categorized as "Carwile", then there is little runoff and water must be absorbed. This experiment investigates the economic feasibility of adding sand to the arena to allow permeability of the water into the ground so the arena can be used after a rain. Different sand and arena dirt mixtures are tested on a small scale model of the arena with 1.5 inches of rain. Since most sand is sold by the ton, rain is measured in inches, and science labs are equipped with metrics, all conversions must be made to accommodate the scenario. The testing apparatus models the arena to adjust for the depth of working the dirt so it does not pack. When the water is added, the amount that drops throught the test model is measured to determine the amount of water that permeated the dirt. The comparisons calculated how much it would cost for each milliliter of water that runs through the dirt. The experiment comes to a conclusion by showing that 25% sand and 75% dirt allows the most economic advantage.

THE SKY IS FALLING! A SEVEN YEAR STUDY OF METEOR ACTIVITY OVER NE MISSISSIPPI
Channing Jordan Arnold
Booneville High School, Booneville, MS

This project continued to study meteor activity over N.E. Mississippi using a forward scatter meteor radar detection system. There were three objectives of this project:<br><br>1) Try to improve meteor counts by changing the antenna to a “turnstyle” configuration.<br><br>2) Perform a statistical analysis on the effects of the total “noise” power across all frequencies in the audio passband and compare it to the analysis done in the 2006 project on the effects of tropospheric ducting. <br><br>3) Continue to study major meteor showers and compare to previous years’ results.<br><br>The new antenna consisted of 2 half-wave dipoles mounted 5’ above the ground and 90º from each other. One dipole was connected directly to the coax cable. The second dipole was connected to the coax through a one quarter wave matching section. This allowed the signals from both dipoles to be in phase with other.<br><br>A statistical analysis was done to see if there was a correlation between the meteor counts and the total “noise” power across the frequencies monitored by the meteor counting software provided by NASA (200-1000 Hz). <br><br>The data showed that a correlation existed between 00:00 and 02:00 GMT and between 14:00 and 23:00 GMT. The hours of 03:00 to 13:00 GMT did not show any correlation. When correlations were detected, they were stronger correlations than were found when the data was analyzed for barometric pressure vs. counts. The turnstyle antenna improved the average overall meteor counts by 74%.

AN EXAMINATION OF CHLORIDE DEPOSITION IN CONNATE WATER ISOLATED FROM SUBTERRANEAN ROCK DEPOSITS IN OREGON'S WILLAMETTE BASIN COMPARATIVELY RELATED TO THE CHLORIDE CONTENT OF PRESENT DAY OCEAN WATER
Kerry Reid Streiff, Dennis Shi, 
Oregon Episcopal School, Portland, OR

How has the amount of chloride isolated from connate water found in subterranean rock deposits of the Willamette Basin changed over time related to the chloride content of present day ocean water? Samples of saline well water and Pacific Ocean water were collected from several sites in Oregon’s Willamette Basin and at the seacoast. The chloride concentration (ppm) and additional observed elements present in these samples were determined using Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA). To further examine and confirm the chloride concentration (mg/L) of each sample, a chloride/salinity probe with associated software was employed. Data from a local nuclear reactor, where the NAA was performed, indicated that the average chloride concentration of the well water examined was 2,742.61ppm. Ocean water samples measured an average chloride concentration of 12,053.90 ppm while tap water demonstrated an insignificant average chloride level of 45.85 ppm. The average mass of chloride (mg/L) of each sample was calculated using the chloride probe. These results provided data similar to those from the reactor and supported the hypothesis; the collected well water is connate water trapped in underground aquifers for millennia. Additional observed and measured elements found in the ocean water were similar to those in the well water samples. The average chloride concentration of well water samples was considerably higher than that in the tap water (by 2,696.76 ppm). The average mass of chloride in the saline well water was remarkably similar to that of ocean water with a difference of only 0.00757 grams of chloride per sample.

BEYOND BLUE: THE USE OF META-MATERIAL TO CHANNEL RENEWABLE ENERGY WHILE PROTECTING SHORELINE ENVIRONMENT.
Michael Reed Glawe
New Ulm Cathedral High School, New Ulm, MN

The purpose of this project was to create a meta-material prototype which would produce energy while providing protection from wave impacts. Meta-material is a structural design based not from it's composition but from its arrangement. It embraces the concept of cloaking. The method sought to prove that that the meta-disc, with its concentric corridors, can be used to significantly reduce wave height while producing energy. The disc was tested in a 8'3" X 6'3" wave tank with a wave generator. The wave generator was released, with and without the presence of a meta-disc. The data was collected using water rulers and a voltage meter. The wave height and energy output were recorded. In analysis, the meta-disc reduced wave height significantly by directing the waves through each corridor. It would appear, at first glance, that the waves would pass through the disc easily. Upon entry, however, the waves followed the outer rings first. As the waves spiraled towards the center, inertia played an effect on the waves, pulling the waves out from the ring. In conclusion, the dual purpose of the structure could prove effective for harnessing ocean wave energy and preventing coastline erosion while minimizing the impact on the ocean environment. Potentially, the meta-disc could render islands and oil platforms invisible to a tsunami or a tidal surge, allowing waves to pass undisturbed.

MITIGATION OF SOIL LIQUEFACTION WITH MAGNETIC FIELDS
Tanya Nicole Petach
Fairview High School, Boulder, CO

This study focused on mitigating liquefaction in soil by applying magnetic fields to soils containing iron particles. Liquefaction profiles were determined for three soil types containing different relative amounts of silt and sand which were used in the mitigation study. <br><br> Liquefaction was studied in a shaking chamber which emulated the shaking frequency and magnitude of an earthquake. Magnetic fields were applied to the soil samples by adding iron particles to the soil and placing a sheet of magnets under the shaking chamber. The magnetic force reduced the magnitude of liquefaction in sandy soil by 50% during the 80 second test and delayed the onset of liquefaction (but did not alter the final magnitude) in a blended silt/sand soil. A model of the forces in the shaking system showed that the magnetic force exerted on an iron particle was 300 times greater than the force exerted by gravity.<br><br> A remote sensing study was carried out to determine whether liquefaction in situ followed a similar trend to liquefaction observed in the shaking chamber. Satellite images, taken before and after an earthquake in Gisborne, New Zealand, were studied using a false color composite to identify soil slides that occurred during the earthquake. Slide areas were located on a geo-referenced soils map and were determined to occur in sandy soils, similar to the sandy soil studied in the shaking chamber.<br><br> The magnetic force mitigation strategy that reduced liquefaction in sandy soils would be applicable to regions that exhibited liquefaction during the NZ earthquake.

ATMOSPHERIC TEMPERATURE, HUMIDITY, AND LIGHT INTENSITY TO THE EDGE OF SPACE, YEAR III
Molly Elaine Kennon
Cross County High School, Cherry Valley, AR

The Arkansas BalloonSAT program has successfully launched and recovered nine high altitude ballons and payload vehicles. My research project untilized data collected from May 24, 2008 (ABS-07 Spring flight), July 12 (ABS-08 Summer flight), and October 4, 2008 (ABS-09 Fall flight). I have been an active member of this program for all of these flights and have worked with my school's balloon and rocket club in the construction of payload boxes. I included a HOBO data logger, solar panels, and digital camera on all flights included in this study. Using data from each flight I compared the temperature, absolute humidity, and light intensity at the following altitudes: the surface, 3.05 km (10,000 ft.), 6.1 km (20,000 ft.), 9.1km (30,000 ft.), 12.2 km (40,000 ft.), 15.8 km (52,000 ft., the approximate altitude of the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere), and at maximum height (most flights-26.5 km, 87,000 ft.). BOXCAR software and Excel were utilized to analyze this data. The goal of this research project was to look for correlations between the seasons of the year and temperature/humidity changes at specific levels of the atmosphere listed. Temperature and absolute humidity were plotted versus light intensity to determine if light intensity values alone can be used to predict with confidence the temperature and humidity. Water vapor is the number one greenhouse gas in Earth's atmosphere and the untilization of light intensity data to forecast the water vapor through the troposphere can be a useful tool in climate change studies.

CENTRIFUGE MODELING OF RAINFALL-INDUCED LANDSLIDES
Henry Ling
Bergen County Academies, Hackensack, NJ

Hundreds of lives and pieces of property are lost every year due to landslides. This study provided answers as to why landslides occur more often during heavy rainfall. A natural slope has soil properties that are not readily known, while tests on landslides are not feasible in the laboratory due to the magnitude of the problem involved. Soil behaves stronger within the slope due to stress confinement, as opposed to a loose state, such as sand on a beach. In this study, a large 200-g centrifuge was used in order to simulate full-scale stress conditions. According to the scaling rule, a model of reduced size (n times smaller than full scale) may be used to simulate the full-scale slope by increasing the acceleration field to n times gravity. <br><br>Two types of testings were conducted: two non-rainfall to establish the baseline and five rainfall tests. 60° slopes were formed by compacting a sand-clay mixture, in a ratio of 85% to 15% by weight, to a dry density of 1.65 g/cm3. The moisture content was controlled to be 7.7%. For non-rainfall testings, the acceleration was increased gradually in the centrifuge until the slope collapsed. The tests were repeatable with the slope failure occurring at about 31g. The rainfall testings were conducted at an acceleration of 23g, which was slightly below the failure state. In each test, the intensity of rainfall was varied by using different number of spraying nozzles (31~97 mm/hr), and the duration of time taken for the landslide to occur was recorded. In addition to visual monitoring by the closed circuit cameras, several sensors were installed in the soil that used a wireless system in order to observe the change in suction and pore water pressure due to infiltration. <br><br>The test results showed that rainfall intensity in excess of 58 mm/hr caused erosion and thus debris flow. The measured results were able to verify the hypothesis of landslides due to a loss of suction followed by building up of pore water pressure. The rainfall intensity versus duration threshold curve obtained from this study was comparable to reported curves obtained from actual landslides. Such thresholds are useful for landslide hazard warnings.

ROLE OF SEA SURFACE PRESSURE IN DETERMINING POSSIBLE RECURVATURE OF A HURRICANE'S PATH
Sarah Dunn Ditchek
North Shore Hebrew Academy High School, Great Neck, NY

Hurricane forecasters face the difficult challenge of determining the path of a hurricane. This challenge arises due to a phenomenon called recurvature. Recurvature is a directional change in a hurricane's path of movement from its original westward and poleward direction. Recurvature causes path prediction to be unreliable. Recurving and nonrecurving hurricanes from the years 1950-2007 were counted and entered into an Excel sheet. These data showed that nonrecurving hurricanes are an anomaly. Therefore, this project was undertaken to explore this anomaly. Daily sea surface pressure maps were then retrieved for the days surrounding select hurricanes for the inclusive period of 2000-2007. Eight pairs of hurricanes, each pair consisting of one recurving and one nonrecurving hurricane, were analyzed in order to determine what cuased this nonrecurving anomaly. The result became clear: certain pressure system patterns affect the track of a hurricane, and the pattern of movement of the pressure system which causes nonrecurvature explains why nonrecurving hurricanes are an anomaly. These findings were then tested on six hurricanes of the 2008 hurricane season. Those pressure patterns identified with recurvature or nonrecurvature proved to be accurate indicators of the 2008 hurricanes' paths. Such pressure patterns acting as hurricane path indicators may greatly aid forecasters in determining the path of a hurricane, allowing for more accurate predictions.

HYDROGEOLOGIC CONTROL OF IGNEOUS DIKES ON GYPSUM KARST DEVELOPMENT IN SOUTHEASTERN EDDY COUNTY, NEW MEXICO.
Lucas C. Middleton
Carlsbad High School, Carlsbad, NM

Igneous dike complex in southeastern Eddy County are located in the Castile Formation in the Gypsum Plain. This study was conducted to determine if there is a relationship between gypsum karst development and igneous dikes in the region. The goal was to prove that igneous dikes have an effect on the local hydrology and associated karst development around them. To conduct this research a surface survey of the area around the dike was conducted to find and document karst features and the geology of the area. Randomly generated areas were surveyed and used as a control. A T-Test was performed to determine if there was a difference in karst development around the dike complex compared to normal conditions. Using ArcGIS 9.3 (Geological Information System) to analyze the data collected. The data that was collected show 15 karst features within the igneous dike area. No karst features were found in the randomly generated areas. This shows that igneous dike complex have an affect on gypsum karst development.

THERMAL ANALYSIS AND THERMOGRAVIMETRY TECHNIQUES TO QUANTIFY AND PREVENT FOREST FIRES
Divya Nag
Mira Loma High School, Sacramento, CA

Losing hundreds of acres of land as a result of an uncontrollable fire is not uncommon. These raging wildfires have proven to be a problem of high economic loss and great environmental impact on an international scale. The heating of soil during wildfires and prescribed burns is disastrous to soil fertility due to the significant loss of soil organic matter (SOM). Since it is difficult to measure SOM content, most analytical methods determine soil organic carbon content and estimate SOM through a highly approximated conversion factor. This non-quantitative and highly subjective method for assessing fire severity misses the essential value in post-fire recovery processes: nutrient and organic matter content. For this reason, fire scientists and forest management have been searching for robust quantitative measurements of fire effects on soils.<br><br> In this work, a method was developed for the quantitative estimation of soil organic matter loss through the use of differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetry techniques (TGA). Results from the utilization of these techniques showed that the decrease in total combustible enthalpy per gram of sample can serve as an integral characteristic of organic matter loss. Derived from the ubiquitous presence of quartz in soil, a ratio comparing the alpha-beta quartz phase transition enthalpy to the combustion enthalpy of organic matter was created and can be used to compare heated and unheated soil. Use of this novel ratio will eliminate the need to weigh samples and account for water content differences in soils, deeming it ideal in the determination of organic matter loss in on-site situations. <br><br> This innovative method of measuring loss of organic matter due to fire is highly significant as it can be applied to all soil types in different locations; and can be used to accurately predict organic matter loss from potential fires of various temperatures. Benefits of these techniques and the novel ratio range from evaluating the efficacy of prescribed burning to greater agricultural production and forest management.

CORRELATION BETWEEN OXYGEN ISOTOPE RATIOS AND TEMPERATURE: IMPLICATIONS FOR UNDERSTANDING GLOBAL WARMING
Manjari Randeria
Upper Arlington High School, Upper Arlington, OH

Accurate estimates of temperatures going back hundreds of thousands of years are essential to quantify the extent of global warming. The aim of this project was to use a physical property of water to develop a proxy for the historical temperature record. Specifically, the goal was to test the hypothesis that there exists a correlation between the ratio of O-18 to O-16 isotopes in water and the temperature of the precipitation. Rain and snow samples were collected over a four-month period in Columbus, OH and the temperature at the time of precipitation was recorded. The samples were analyzed in a mass spectrometer to measure the ratio of O-18 to O-16. A direct correlation (r = 0.72) was found between the oxygen isotope ratio y and the temperature T (with y = 0.583T-16.038). This supports the hypothesis of using isotope ratios as a proxy for the temperature. Thus, measurements of oxygen isotope ratios in ice cores going back 800,000 years provide important estimates of the historical temperature record, and play a crucial role in studies of global warming.

MAPPING VENUS—THE USE OF MAGELLAN RADAR DATA TO DETERMINE THE GEOLOGIC HISTORY OF A CIRCULAR LOW ON VENUS, HOW THE AREA VARIES IN SPACE AND TIME AND IF IT FORMED BY ENDOGENIC OR EXOGENIC PROCESSES: PHASE TWO
Courtney Catherine Jackson
Cloquet Senior High School, Cloquet, MN

Magellan, a NASA space probe, mapped the entire surface of Venus in high resolution. Currently, with advances in technology, geologists are able to use this data. The question was can mapping a geologic feature on Venus be used to determine the overall geologic history of an area and how a landform was formed? NASA Magellan mission V34-Venus mapping data was obtained from a planetary geologist. Radar, high definition, and inverted data were downloaded onto a graphic illustrator program. Over a four month period mapping of this data was done using a writable external monitor. The hypothesis was that mapping a circular low will allow the determination of how the area varies in space and time as well as if the landform formed in an endogenitic or exogenetic fashion. Four detailed hypotheses were tested: soft impact crater, normal impact crater, positive diapir, and negative diapir. If the circular low is a positive diapir, then the feature will show: rim/circular ring and shape, no negative relief, concentric folds, positive relief, no ejecta blanket, concentric fractures, no wrinkle ridges (fast formation), lava flows, and volcanoes. Observations supporting the hypothesis are: a rim/circular ring and shape, positive relief, no ejecta blanket, concentric fractures, no wrinkle ridges, lava flows, and volcanoes. Observations against the hypothesis are negative relief and no concentric folds. It appears that there is negative relief to the circular low, but there were not concentric folds related to the circular low, therefore this hypothesis is plausible. All other hypotheses were rejected.

EVALUATING TSUNAMI RISK IN DISCOVERY BAY, WASHINGTON
Marley Elizabeth Iredale
Sequim High School, Sequim, WA

The topic of this research was evaluating tsunami risk in Discovery Bay, Washington. The bay has no sand bar and the marsh at its head is a ‘trap’ for tsunami sediments. A study (2000) with similar goals was restricted by wood debris from a mill. In the fall of 2008 the site was excavated, which allowed access to more of the marsh. The purpose of this research was to determine a recurrence interval and evaluate the probability of tsunamis in the vicinity of Discovery Bay. Fourteen bores were done along four transects using a gouge auger. Samples were collected at each sand layer and sieve and diatom analyses performed. Results included: depth, elevation and thickness of sand layers; diatom identification; sieve gradation; development of boring logs and transect diagrams; stratigraphy analysis; analysis of age versus elevation; and the normal annual cumulative probability of tsunamis in Discovery Bay. Ten sand beds were verified as evidence of tsunamis. An average uniform rate of deposition model was developed with an average recurrence interval of 240 years (standard deviation 120 years). From a normal annual cumulative probability there is a range of 60-80% chance of a tsunami between 2010 and 2040. The average recurrence interval for Cascadia Subduction Zone-generated tsunamis is 500 years. Other potential tsunami causes may include local landslides or regional earthquakes. As tsunami inundation maps have been generated for Cascadia Subduction Zone-generated tsunamis (10m in height) and not local or regional sources (100m in height), these maps need to be reevaluated.

WATER SHAPES THE DESERT: YEAR III
Christopher John Heslop
Nevada Home School, Incline Village, NV

Water Shapes the Desert: Year III explores the effects potential increase in rainfall in the desert southwest due to climate change could have on small drainage basins. Analysis of field data, high resolution topography, and aerial imagery shows evidence of greater erosion in the Gower Gulch channel due to increased runoff. The increased erosion increases debris in flood waters, meaning damage caused by flash flooding in the desert southwest could potentially be more devastating.<br><br>A flood diversion redirects flood waters from Furnace Creek Wash into the smaller Gower Gulch. This represents an increase in water discharge. In the main channel of Gower Gulch, I made measurements of scarps and sediment size to determine any increase in erosion caused by the flood diversion. I found the increase in water discharge down-cut the channel and increased the sediment evident load on the channel floor.<br><br> <br><br>The main channel of Gower Gulch was compared to a southern tributary to the gulch unaffected by an increase in diversionary discharge. In this control channel, I repeated my measurement procedure of scarps and sediment. In the southern tributary, there was little down-cutting and sediment on the channel floor was uniform in size and more evenly distributed.<br><br>Evident erosion in the main channel of Gower Gulch is far greater than the southern tributary. This can serve as a model to illustrate the results potential climate change could have on erosion in small drainage basins, and help develop mitigation methods.

IS THE MOON REALLY THE EARTH’S SATELLITE?
Albert Dong Woo Kim
Winona Senior High School, Winona, MN

This project studies the orbits of both the moon and the earth. The basic question is whether the moon is really the earth’s satellite or just appears to be one. As a comparison, Mars and Phobos are picked. According to the calculation, the major force that influences the moon’s orbit is the gravity between the moon and the sun, not the gravity between the moon and the earth. On the contrary, the gravity between Mars and Phobos is much larger than that between the sun and Phobos. Based on these calculations, it can be easily expected that the orbiting path of the moon is quite different from that of Phobos.<br><br> Several physics formulas are utilized including Newton’s second law of motion, Newton’s law of universal gravitation, and formulas on speed and centripetal force. From these calculations the orbiting path of the earth and the moon is plotted. The numerical values for the velocities, accelerations, masses, and radial distances were scaled appropriately and used to compute the coordinates of the moon and the earth as well as Mars and Phobos in the computer simulation.<br><br> The computer simulation results indicate that the orbiting path of the moon is almost a circle centered on the sun whereas the orbiting path of Phobos is around the Mars. Contrary to the general belief that the moon is a satellite of the earth, the moon is actually a satellite of the sun.

COOK INLET: CORRELATION BETWEEN AIR TEMPERATURE TRENDS AND INTRA-SEASONAL SEA ICE EXTENT VARIABILITY
Kelsey Ann Meacham
West Anchorage High School, Anchorage, AK

Passive microwave imagery shows a significant decrease in Cook Inlet, Alaska, sea ice extent since 1979. This project explored the correlation between air temperature trends and intra-seasonal sea ice extent variability in Cook Inlet.<br><br>Sea ice extent for the last 30 years was calculated using a technique developed at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) in Colorado. Average monthly temperatures were obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The data were analyzed to determine if there was a consistent relationship between temperature increases and sea ice decreases throughout the sea ice season, including freeze-up, mid-season, and breakup.<br><br>The analysis showed that during breakup, temperatures are increasing and sea ice is melting at faster rates than during midseason and freeze-up.<br><br>Understanding trends allows for better sea ice predictions and safer maritime travel and industry. This project is relevant in helping to plan and proactively react to climate change not only in Cook Inlet, but around the world.

THE DANGER OF TSUNAMIS FROM ASTEROID IMPACTS
John Christopher Ashburn
Covenant Christian Academy, Huntsville, AL

The purpose of this work was to provide experimental support for some of the conclusions drawn from theory and mathematical models of asteroid-induced tsunamis. Doing so increases confidence in the simulations that would be used to predict affected areas and formulate evacuation plans in the event of such a disaster.<br><br>The experiment involved scale model water impacts of asteroids using six concrete spheres of varying mass dropped three times each from two different heights into a wading pool. A digital video camera recorded the impact and generated waves.<br><br>The video was studied frame-by-frame on a computer to obtain baseline water levels, impact times and positions, and wave heights and transit times for the first two waves at two different marks. From these, wave amplitude, wavelength, and energy were estimated. Finally, mathematical expressions describing the wave amplitude, wavelength, and energy as a function of the kinetic energy of the impacting spheres were generated. <br><br>Results support the position that the amplitude and wavelength of the waves increase with the energy of the impacting asteroid according to simple power laws. It was further found that a relatively constant fraction of the asteroid energy is transferred to the largest wave. All results were found to be consistent with theoretical and simulation predictions. Extrapolating to the energies of real asteroids, the estimated tsunami amplitudes were consistent with other works in the field and suggest that the waves caused by an asteroid impact could be much larger than those generated by the 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake.

FIELD AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF LANDSLIDE PROPENSITY: USING STUDY SITES FROM OREGON CITY, OREGON
Evan George Marshall, Sandeep Mallidi, 
Westview High School, Portland, OR

Landslides cause $3.2 billion in damage every year in the US. Although this devastation is increasing with continued real estate development, quantified analysis of the soils that enable landslides remains unaccomplished. The current way to evaluate landslide risk is through Landslide Hazard Maps created by Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Although these maps are significant developments, they have two major problems: they cannot evaluate specific areas and are extremely dependent on past landslide occurrences which makes evaluating landslide risk in unmonitored areas impossible. Our research specifically analyzes and quantifies factors which have been intuitively proven to cause landslides by analyzing the percentage difference between the characteristics of samples from landslide and non landslide samples taken from the same area and uses these data to create an index which solves the problems associated with Landslide Hazard Maps. Our initial hypotheses were that increases in the average clay, plasticity index, and liquid limit percentage differences increase the propensity of a landslide. To test these hypotheses, we tested particle size and Atterberg limits from samples we gathered from Newell Creek Canyon in Oregon City. After we analyzed these data, we found our hypotheses generally true. Although our hypotheses were generally correct, sand percentage (a previously though important factor) was the only factor that was categorically consistent. This led to the conclusion that sand percentage plays a vital role in draining and dispersing water in soil. This novel conclusion makes our index more accurate than previous models and fundamentally changes our understanding of landslides.

ARCHEOLOGICAL PALYNOLOGY OF THE WILLAMETTE VALLEY
Ian James Love, Ashley Rachelle Wiens, 
West Salem High School, Salem, OR

In the palynological fossil record, the past history of an environment can be found. Additionally, this data can be obtained from a given area to expose agricultural and social trends. The social trend we are attempting to expose is the beginning of the burning of the Willamette Valley by the Kalapuyan people, who utilized conflagration to enhance their hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Through the collection of a core sample from a natural buried peat site near Hubbard, Oregon, and the examination of its contents, we were able to gather data related to the frequency of species of plants in this area. The portions taken from the soil sample were dated using the Mt. Mazama ash layer, which is dated at 5,677 (± 150) B.C. This ash layer was confirmed by comparing the structure and other characteristics of ash in the test sample of the supposed ash layer to known Mount Mazama ash. Volcanic ashes can be positively identified since every volcanic eruption produces ash with unique characteristics. The pollen was found in the core sample by SEM microscopy after lab processing. Positive identification of species was achieved through the use of various pollen identification guides. Data will be correlated in a species-date-depth graph. Through the analysis of this data we will be able to determine the ecological history of the area in which the soil sample was obtained.

THE IMPACT OF 2008 TROPICAL CYCLONES IN THE PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITY OF AN ESTUARINE SYSTEM: SECOND YEAR STUDY
Andrea Carolina Monzon, Adriana Cristina Sarro, 
Academia del Perpetuo Socorro, San Juan, PUERTO RICO

The impact of disturbances that became tropical cyclones (Pre-Fay, Pre-Gustav and Pre-Kyle), and tropical cyclones (Hanna, Ike and Omar) of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season was analyzed in the estuarine waters of La Parguera Bay, Lajas, Puerto Rico. Each tropical phenomenon varied in trajectory, wind, swell/waves and rainfall characteristics, and consequently, the impact on phytoplankton biomass, nutrients and chlorophyll concentrations varied. By comparing these changes, the impact of the tropical cyclones can be assessed in the estuary. The first year of study (2007), Hurricane Dean's sustained tropical storm force winds and high swell/wave action over the estuary of La Parguera Bay altered and enhanced phytoplankton diversity and concentration, while Hurricane Félix prolonged and maintained a large and diverse phytoplankton community in the estuary. None of the 2008 tropical cyclones produced sustained hurricane or tropical force winds in the estuary. However, the largest impact of the season came from a tropical disturbance that later became Hurricane Kyle, also known as Pre-Kyle. Record rainfall from Pre-Kyle produced extensive flooding in southwest Puerto Rico and resulted in unprecedented proliferation of Cochlodinium polykrikoides, a recognized cause of harmful algal blooms (HABs), which extended approximately six km2 across the bay and lasted almost a month after its formation. Using remote sensing imagery such as TMI/QuikSCAT, SeaWiFS and MODIS can help understand the changes in sea-surface temperatures, winds and chlorophyll-a patterns in the coastal and oceanic waters around Puerto Rico during the hurricane season.

DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL METHOD TO FORECAST ATMOSPHERIC MIXING HEIGHT, YEAR 3
Lynne Olivier Chapman, Candice Fay Schwartzenburg, 
St. Joseph's Academy, Baton Rouge, LA

Many regions cannot economically prosper without emitting pollution to a certain extent. Therefore, this research does not intend to eliminate pollution; rather, it intends to more fully understand natural conditions that intensity emissions. <br><br>This experiment aims to forecast the altitude of atmospheric mixing height at least 24 hours in advance in order to predict unhealthy pollution. It is hypothesized that mixing height can be forecasted a day in advance using the predicted temperature and the current day’s mixing height and temperature. <br><br>The analysis utilizes a series of correlations to understand the relationship among temperature, mixing height, and wind speed as they change over 24 hours. These correlations are incorporated in to a hierarchical linear regression that predicts mixing height 2 with r2=0.747. The accuracy of this equation allows for the acceptation of the hypothesis. The following equation describes mixing height 2 based on wind speed, temperature 2, temperature change, and mixing height 1:<br><br>M2 =0.279M1 +112.729T2 +102.871C -7.475W -2500.446<br><br>In order to improve real-world applications of the results, a mathematical model allows for the calculation of mixing height multiple days in advance. The equation is derived from a series of iterations, creating a loop based on repetitive patterns of variables found in the regression.<br><br>Furthermore, MHAS (Mixing Height Analysis Software) can quickly and accurately create a unique mixing height equation for a given city. The equation is formed based on the region’s characteristic weather conditions. This advancement in forecasting mixing height improves the accuracy of atmospheric pollution modeling.

A STUDY ON OZONE IN A SMALL MIDWESTERN TOWN
Pandora Catharine Wadsworth, Yogita Singh, 
Maharishi School of the Age of Enlightenment, Fairfield, IA

Our hypothesis is that ground-level ozone would be highest in areas of our town with the most traffic. To test our hypothesis we conducted an experiment on the ground-level ozone in six locations comparing areas with high (400 > 800 car per hour) traffic and low (< 400 cars per hour) traffic. After doing testing for a month discovered that areas with a high amount of traffic led to the highest levels of ground-level ozone. <br><br>To determine the levels of ground-level ozone we created strips containing distilled water, potassium iodide and soluble starch. To get an accurate reading we had to leave the strips out for eight hours at a time, a shorter time period results in less ozone absorption and a lighter color, and vice versa for a longer period of time. To calculate the intensity of ground-level ozone we used the Schonbien number as well as a relative humidity chart. Using the humidity chart we could factor out the humidity so that the levels weren’t as high as the strips looked. We tested the air quality in eight hour periods, three strips per location, every day over the winter months from late January to early March. <br><br> Our results showed no significant difference between high (400 > 800 car per hour) traffic and low (< 400 cars per hour)traffic, to calculate this, we used a t-test two-sample assuming equal variance and got a p-value of 0.33 and a t-stat of 0.96. We believe this could be because our ozone levels fluctuated greatly in our month of testing and with further testing we could find a larger difference. Using the EPA air quality standards, our results show moderately harmful levels of ground-level ozone, although more tests will need to be done to reach a reliable conclusion. This data poses an opportunity for further research done on the ground-level ozone levels of small communities.

DATING THE ATERIAN CULTURE IN NORTH AFRICA: ESR ANALYSES AT GROTTE DE CONTREBANDIERS, MOROCCO
Tiffany L. Yau, Tenzing Tsomo, 
Stuyvesant High School, New York, NY

At Grotte de Contrebandiers (also known as Smugglers’ Cave and Témara), Morocco, a stratified sequence has yielded Middle and Upper Paleolithic materials associated with hominid remains, and vertebrate teeth for electron spin resonance (ESR) dating. This site has never been dated. ESR can date tooth enamel ranging from 10 ka to 2 Ma in age by comparing the accumulated radiation dose with the radiation dose rates emanating from within the tooth and from the adjacent environment. Six teeth from five layers at Grotte de Contrebandiers were dated by standard ESR, while more than 20 sediment samples were analyzed to obtain volumetrically averaged sediment dose rates for the teeth. High U concentrations in the teeth from lower layers suggest recent U mobilization, possibly due to the presence of saline groundwater. The Contrebandiers teeth yielded preliminary ages ranging from 48.2 ± 3.4 ka to 89.7 ± 1.9 ka. Four of the LU ages correlate with Oxygen Isotope Stage (OIS) 5b, and two with early OIS 3. With more accurate dates for the Aterian and other Middle Paleolithic deposits at Grotte de Contrebandiers, its cultures can now be compared with those from other Aterian and Middle Paleolithic sites to develop better regional correlations and better models for the movement of modern humans around and out of Africa. Dating Smugglers successfully will eventually help to explain the human adaptations that caused anatomically modern humans and cultural modernity to disperse across the world and the climatic changes that may driven these migrations.

THE CORONAE PARADOX: THE USE OF MAGELLAN RADAR DATA TO DETERMINE THE OVERALL GEOLOGIC HISTORY OF CIRCULAR LOWS ON VENUS, IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE PROCESS(ES) OF CORONAE FORMATION, PHASE III
Courtney Catherine Jackson
Cloquet Senior High School, Cloquet, MN

Geologists use Magellan radar data to create geologic maps of Venus’ surface, specifically to determine circular low formation processes. A circular low is a subset feature of a crater like depression called a coronae; a term that describes shape and possible formation processes (McDaniel and Hansen, 2005). The question is: can the Magellan radar data be used to determine the overall geologic history of circular lows on Venus, in order to determine the process(es) of coronae formation? Different variations of radar data were mapped in layers on a graphics program. Individual features such as volcanoes, fractures, etc., were mapped on these layers. The hypothesis was that mapping landforms using the V34, V57, and V60 Venus datasets, over a three year period and obtained from the Magellan mission, could be used to determine the geologic history of these circular low(s), in order to determine the process(es) of coronae formation. Four detailed landform construction hypotheses were tested for each map over the three years of study. A global study of the circular lows comparing the three mapped areas from this study to fifty-six mapped areas by Shankar and Hansen (2007) was also done in order to identify any commonalities in their formation process. Ellipticity, depth of circular low, and diameter of crater were main points of observation. To show change over time, the researcher remapped V34 and V57. The appearance of concentric fractures, not previously mapped, may indicate possible positive diapir formation for V-34 and further supported V-57’s previously mapped results.

EFFECTS OF UV RADIATION, YEAR TWO: SUNSCREEN TOLERANCE
Caraline Nicole Vaughn
Nettleton High School, Jonesboro, AR

Every day teens and adults step into the tanning beds or lay in the sun without sunscreen. When these things are truly thought about, what good can that be doing? This experiment tested the accuracy of sunscreen by finding how much it reduced the harmful UVA and UVB rays.<br><br> To find UVA and UVB rays a LabQuest monitor was connected with two sets of UVA and UVB probes. Both sets of probes were set directly next to each other. One set of probes has clear wrap with SPF 30 sunscreen application, and the other with no sunscreen. After setting a set of probes out on the tennis court and football field, they would collect data for three hours (from 8-11) in various weather conditions (mostly sunny, overcast, and partly cloudy). At promptly 11:00 am the sets would be photo documented, collected, and analyzed. <br><br> After analyzing the graphs of each day or court, it has been concluded that UVB rays were dramatically reduced, almost completely blocked out on both surfaces every day, and UVA were reduced. On the tennis court on two of three days the UVA show to be even more reduced than those of the football. It seems that the tennis court is more sensitive to the increase and decrease in amounts of UVA and UVB rays. The conclusion is that general store sunscreen blocks UVB (sunburn, skin cancer) and reduces UVA (aging, skin cancer).

MOOR AND MORE: PROCESSES IN BOGS
Justin Ulf Muller
Europaschule Gymnasium Westerstede, Westerstede, Niedersachsen, GERMANY

In the bogs of Germany, Latvia and Lithuania I investigated the<br><br>content of water, carbon, nitrate and phosphate because the bogs are very full of these elements and if amount of nutrients leaking into rivers and brooks is very high, the oceans will be full of them - eutrophication threatens.<br><br>When bogs are drained, the carbon dioxide escapes into the atmosphere. But if a bog is renatured the content of the phosphate leaking into the rivers and brooks is very high. I analyzed the renatured bogs in Northwest Germany.<br><br>To determine more precisely the high phosphate content I worked in the Environmental Science Centre UFZ in Leipzig only in this year. To get more information about the<br><br>metabolic-physiological processes of implementation I identified the bacteria and fungi.<br><br>I wanted to learn about the processes in the ground so that I could determine what kind of bogs emits climate-damaging gases.<br><br>I discovered that the content of water (80-90%) and carbon (80-99%) in the bogs of the three countries was very high but normal. The content of nutrients was very low (nitrate 0.04-1,54mg/l; about 3,82mg/l phosphate; about 0.1mg/l ammonium in Germany). In the bogs of Latvia and Lithuania the content was lower.<br><br>I was able to identify typical bacteria in the bogs but I did not have enough information to<br><br>draw conclusions about the metabolic-physiological implementation processes.<br><br>The differences this year are the groundanalyzis in Latvia and Lithuania, more results for the water analyzis and more measuring points.

ORBIT DETERMINATION OF NEAR-EARTH ASTEROIDS
Tongji Li
Hershey High School, Hershey, PA

The goal of this project was to determine whether Asteroid 200506 (2001 AD52), on the Critical List, and near-Earth Asteroid 68216 (2001 CV26), a Potentially Hazardous Asteroid (PHA), pose an imminent impact risk to the Earth. These asteroids were observed and tracked with online robotic telescopes. After remotely slewing the telescope to the star field surrounding the asteroid, I took a series of six (6) images with two (2)-minute delay between each image via a CCD camera mounted on the telescope. These images were exposed 300 seconds and 60 seconds for Asteroids 200506 and 68216 respectively. Then, I loaded these images onto an online software program to perform data reduction, identify asteroids by "blinking" these images, and measure asteroid positions. I created an Orbit Determination (OD) computation package in Visual–Python language. This package consists of three major programs: <br><br> 1) The OD program that computes the asteroid’s orbital elements using Gaussian's OD Method; <br><br> 2) The Ephemeris Generator which generates an animated 3-Dimensional model of the orbiting celestial bodies and predicts the next closest approach of asteroids to the Earth; and<br><br> 3) The Least Squares Plate Reduction program which calculates the standard deviations of the residuals of Right Ascension and Declination. <br><br>Based on my work, it is concluded that these two asteroids do not pose an imminent impact threat to the Earth. This project is uploading onto my personal website to provide free access for other amateur observers to track asteroids. In the future, I will study the n-body problem to improve the accuracy of my orbit determination program and petition NASA to install telescopes on the near-Earth Asteroids to explore deep space.

CAN GIS HELP CONSERVE FOSSILS ON THE JURASSIC COAST?
Thomas William Hearing
The Thomas Hardye School, Dorchester

The aim of the project was to establish and refine a technique to allow quantitative monitoring of erosion of wave cut platforms at Monmouth Beach, Lyme Regis. Monmouth Beach is composed of wave cut platforms of the Blue Lias formation, including the Ammonite Pavement, and is an important part of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site. The Ammonite Pavement is a layer of Blue Lias limestone abundant in the Jurassic marine fossils ammonites, and it was from this that a plesiosaur was excavated in 2008. This stratum of Blue Lias appears, from 4 years site monitoring photographs, to be eroding very rapidly. However, prior to this project there was no quantitative measurement of the erosion. This project used a differential global positioning system (GPS) to create a baseline dataset of Monmouth Beach in the form of a geographical information system (GIS). From the GIS I created 5 maps of the beach, two of which showed the current positions of the edges of 9 wave cut platforms and of major cracks in the Ammonite Pavement. From field observations and the GIS data I proposed two models of wave cut platform erosion, one based on undercutting of the limestone and one on the exploitation of vertical jointing in the limestone and subsequent cracks. I used these models to predict where and how the Ammonite Pavement will erode next.<br><br>The technique pioneered in this project will be continued to monitor erosion of the Ammonite Pavement, using this project’s data as a baseline.

THE SHORT-CYCLE DIGITAL SEISMOMETER
Jianting Qiu
Shenzhen Second Senior High School, Shenzhen, Guangdong, CHINA

An analog seismometer is turned into a digital seismometer by employing modern light grating system to replace the electromagnetic transducer on the analog seismometer. <br><br> The seismic signal picked up by the light grating scale on the pickup unit of the digital seismometer is read and output by the read head of the light grating detection system. <br><br> The light grating detection system has a resolution up to 50 nm, capable of detecting very tiny vibratory displacement on the pickup unit of the seismometer. Meanwhile, the light grating detection system is a photoelectric device, capable of quickly detecting the fairly high vibratory speed of the pickup unit of the seismometer. Also, the optical filter assembly in the light grating system guarantees pure output signal. In addition, with the read head of the light grating detection system being an active component, it produces 5-volt digital signal output, which can be directly applied to digital network transmission. <br><br> As attested by laboratory testing, the digital seismometer is capable of quickly detecting very tiny vibration of the earth crust. The short-cycle digital seismometer is of practical use in actual seismic monitoring application and plays an important role in safeguarding our lives and homeland.

THE RESEARCH ON APPLICATION OF COMMON DIGITAL CAMERA IN METEROLOGICAL VISIBILITY MEASUREMENT
Zi Mu Su
No. 2 Secondary School Attached to East China Normal Univ., Shanghai, Shanghai, CHINA

The project researched on using common digital camera to measure meteorological visibility.Compared with current professional instrument,common digital camera makes visibility measurement more flexible and low-cost,so can be applied to mobile visibility measurement and special situations such as emergency’s temporary visibility measurement.<br><br>The project established expressions of visibility’s exact value and relative change at different moments based on Koschmieder formula and Bouguer's law.The expressions eliminate two parameters which cannot be measured accurately in Koschmieder formula and Bouguer's law called sky background light in object’s direction and object reflex.Thus,surveyor can obtain the result when four groups of object luminance are measured by camera in specific ways.<br><br>The project reduced measurement error of object’s luminance and deviation of actual environment from theoretical conditions by studying digital camera and external environment.For digital camera,the project put forward effective method of image analysis excluding dark current,saturated effect,phenomenon of appearing excessively vague image and deviation of camera parameters.For external environment,the project put forward the best conditions of object’s surface and the environment around objects and shooting places.<br><br>On the basis of calculation,the project reduced the impact of object luminance’s measurement error on visibility’s deviation by analyzing visibility’s expression.<br><br>According to the comparison between the data obtained by common digital camera and foreword scatter measurement meter,deviation originating from changing scattering angle is about 20% and visibility’s variation trend is similar.This preliminary verified the feasibility of the method this project established.

COLORADO RIVER SALINITY: CORRELATION TO GEOSTRATA AND MITIGATION WITH CARBON FIBER CAPACITORS
Tanya Nicole Petach
Fairview High School, Boulder, CO

This study focused on the geologic contributions to salinity in the Colorado River and mitigation strategies to reduce that salinity. Salinity was determined for the mainstream of the Colorado River and the side streams of the river within Grand Canyon National Park. Data were collected from every flowing side stream in July, and thus every stream in the Grand Canyon was sampled which was derived from an aquifer, rather than surface-water. <br><br>The side stream salinities were correlated to different aquifers, geostrata, and emergence layers to determine the salt source for the side streams. Shale layers in the aquifer were found to be the largest contributor to salt content, while carbonate layers contribute less salt to the streams. Since the South-rim aquifers are lower in the geostrata, encompass shale layers, and form artesian pathways, streams derived from South-rim aquifers are higher in salinity than streams derived from North-rim aquifers (which are karstic aquifers in carbonate geostrata layers). Geostrata make a significant contribution to salt levels in Colorado River aquifers.<br><br>A method for de-salination was developed using carbon-fiber capacitor electrodes to remove ions from test solutions. The carbon-fiber capacitor technique removed at least one monolayer of ions from ionic solutions. Surface area, time, and ion-type were tested with the carbon-fiber capacitor to determine optimal conditions for de-salination. The results suggest that de-salination of Colorado River sidestreams using carbon fiber capacitor electrodes could be feasible with high surface area electrode materials.

MONITORING LAKE SUPERIOR SEICHES AT BAYFIELD, WISCONSIN
Genevieve K. Gephart
Bayfield High School, Bayfield, WI

Much like water sloshing back and forth in a bathtub, seiches are tide-like rises and drops in water levels of lakes, bays, or gulfs. A seiche occurs when a body of water is disturbed by wind or atmospheric pressure variations. The purpose of this experiment was to determine the period and magnitude of the Lake Superior seiche at Bayfield, Wisconsin and to investigate the effects of air pressure and wind on Lake Superior seiches. This project was conducted by collecting water levels in a boathouse in a Bayfield harbor. The data indicated the Bayfield seiche has a period of approximately 8 hours and a magnitude of 9.1 cm. The magnitude and period estimated for Duluth at the west end of Lake Superior closely matched that of Bayfield, and the seiche at Duluth and Bayfield were essentially in phase. The period of the seiche at Point Iroquois at the east end of Lake Superior matched that of Bayfield, however, the magnitude was slightly greater, 9 to 11 cm, and the Point Iroquois seiche was 180° out of phase with the Bayfield seiche.

THE STUDY OF INCLUSIONS IN YOGO SAPPHIRES EXTRACTED FROM THE VORTEX MINE NEAR UTICA MONTANA
Katelyn Elizabeth Gibbs
Great Falls High School, Great Falls, MT

Yogo Sapphires are considered to be one of the world’s most precious gemstones. Their flawless appearance and unique “corn flower blue” coloration are characteristics that make Yogo Sapphires so rare. My project was to discover and determine the composition of inclusions within Yogo Sapphires extracted from the Vortex Mine near Utica, Montana. I located the Yogo Sapphire Mine in Montana and made trips to the mine to collect samples and document the stratigraphy of the mine. I collected samples at this site of the Yogo Sapphire Dike material and rough Yogo Sapphires. The Yogo Sapphire Dike was created when molten magma rose to the surface and hardened within fractures in Madison Limestone. The dike contained atoms of oxygen and atoms of aluminum which came together to form corundum crystals. Using a binocular microscope I found Yogo Sapphires extracted from the Vortex Mine contained unique inclusions. Using a scanning electron microscope I was able to observe the inclusion in the Yogo Sapphires and determine the chemical composition of the inclusions using a mass spectrometer. The composition of the inclusions is Rutile (titanium dioxide). The discovery of Rutile inclusions in Yogo Sapphires has never been documented before. I conclude that there are inclusions found in Yogo Sapphires extracted from the Vortex Mine near Utica, Montana and their composition is Rutile.

ISOLATION OF TROGLOBITIC BACTERIA IN THE SUNKEN GARDENS, LEHMAN CAVES
Alexandra Elane Wheatley
Northwest Career and Technical Academy, Las Vegas, NV

Lehman Caves is a cave in the Great Basin National Park in northern Nevada. The microorganisms that live there have never been examined. We surveyed the cave to identify any bacteria growing in a specific location called, Sunken Gardens. We grew our bacteria on Luria Broth using most probable number counts and direct inoculation at 25°C. We chose specific bacteria to isolate and used streaking techniques to perform the isolation. Since the cave was not formerly studied, we expected to discover some unknown genus, however the results yielded previously identified bacterial colonies. The BLAST search of the 16S rRNA provided us with the part of the genome needed to identify these organisms. All of the geneses found were soil bacteria. The most unique finding was that of Bacillis licenformes. Bacillis licenformes is a thermophile that usually lives at 50°C, but in this case was living in 11°C. Due to the thermophile and other natural phenomena this project has opened the door for research to continue in this cave.

PHINDING LIFE: UNDERSTANDING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PHI AND THE POSSIBILITY OF LIFE ON EXTRASOLAR PLANETS
Samantha Emily Keith
Weber High School, Pleasant View, UT

In plants, the arrangement of leaves around the stem follows Fibonacci Sequence-based ratios. This natural phenomenon is called the Law of Phyllotaxis. The planets of our solar system exhibit Phyllotaxis ratios between orbital periods.<br><br> This project was designed to find any correlation between planets in extrasolar systems and possible habitability of life within extrasolar systems. I expected that extrasolar planetary systems demonstrating Phyllotaxis ratios between orbital periods would be more suitable to sustain life based on the knowledge that our solar system displays these ratios between orbital periods and Earth is habitable. Similarly, I thought that extrasolar systems lacking this ratio would not be able to support life.<br><br> Multi-planet extrasolar systems were analyzed to determine how many exhibited Phyllotaxis ratios between orbital periods, the boundaries of each systems’ habitable zone, and which planets (if any) were located in their system’s habitable zone. Any planets orbiting inside of their system’s habitable zone were researched, and data of their physical properties was recorded. These planets were categorized into five groups, from most habitable to least habitable. Finally, the numbers of the groups were added for planets from a system with a Phyllotaxis ratio and for planets from a system without a Phyllotaxis ratio, and statistics were calculated to establish the probability of habitability. <br><br> It was found that planets from a system with a Phyllotaxis ratio between orbital periods have a 19% probability to sustain life while planets from a system without this relationship have a 2% probability to sustain life.

GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF FERRIS FLATS: IMPLICATIONS FOR A RE-ADVANCE OF THE SAGINAW ICE LOBE
Brady Alexander Hasse
Mecosta Osceola Math, Science & Technology Center, Big Rapids, MI

Research was conducted to discover what caused the geological oddities in Ferris Flats, an area in Big Rapids, MI near the Muskegon River on Ferris State University campus. It was found that there were two separate events that caused these oddities. The first being glacier activity and the second being river activity. The clays being tilted nearly vertical, sands found in between layers of clay, and the hill being very steep could be explained by glacial activity. This glacial activity was found to be an initial covering of the area then an uncovering of the area. A pro-glacial lake was in the Ferris Flats area and clay was deposited, dune sands were deposited in the lake and then more clay covered the sands up. The glacier then went back over the area and the ground was tilted upward. Then the glacier melted back again and left till. The melt water from this glacier formed the river. The river then eroded the tills and formed the hillside and exposed the tilted clays. The observational proof for this included till on top of tilted clay in the hill. The stereographic net data (strike and dip) was collected using a Brunton Compass on the folded clay layers. This was used to help prove that the glacier that folded the clay. The other oddities could be explained by the river migrating across the plain. Core samples were taken from the plain using a soil auger and it was discovered that they held fluvial deposits.

COMPUTATIONAL SIMULATIONS OF RING SYSTEMS AROUND RHEA USING N-BODY INTEGRATED PROGRAMS
Ian Alexander Sohl
DaVinci Academy of Science and the Arts, Ogden, UT

Is it possible for a moon of Saturn to have rings? In its 2005 flyby, the spacecraft Cassini might have detected evidence of rings around Rhea, returning data that depicted electron dropouts occurring at roughly symmetrical points on either side of the moon. My hypothesis states that a stable ring system is possible and I will use computational simulations to test this hypothesis.<br><br>The programs Gravity Simulator and Mercury6 were used to insert particles around Rhea at not only the correct distances, but also at a variety of other starting positions. The majority of simulations were conducted to determine whether particles will stay in orbit around Rhea, or whether they would de-orbit or be attracted towards Saturn. <br><br>Most simulations resulted in similar outcomes with the particles forming a cylindrical shaped orbit perpendicular to the equatorial plane. The radius of the ring was typically several thousand kilometers, roughly the same as the projected distances observed by Cassini.<br><br>In conclusion, it appears to be possible for rings to form around Rhea and remain stable. The cylinder shape can be attributed partly to a limitation of the simulation programs which restricted the number of particles. With so few particles in orbit, collisions between particles are almost nonexistent; a factor that often helps the formation of flat rings. Also due to the limitation in the simulation run time, it is possible that the cylinder could evolve into a complete sphere around Rhea, which would be more like a dust cloud than Rhea rings.

DROWNING OUT DROUGHT: THE EFFECT OF COLLISION AND COALESCENCE ON SECONDARY ICE MULTIPLICATION IN MIXED-PHASE CLOUDS
Nicole Sophie Torosin
Niles North High School, Skokie

The purpose of the project was to determine in which mixed-phase clouds ice multiplication took place. The hypothesis predicted that if there was significant collision and coalescence in a mixed-phase cloud, then ice multiplication would occur. Clouds supporting secondary ice multiplication precipitate naturally. By identifying the conditions surrounding clouds with secondary ice multiplication, cloud seeding can be made more efficient and economical bringing drought relief to regions around the world. <br><br> In order to identify clouds with secondary ice multiplication, data was compared over four aircraft penetrations of the cloud: base (above 0o C), sub-freezing (-3 to 0o C), secondary ice multiplication range (-8 to -3o C), and top (-8 to -15o C). Four separate cloud cases were tested against five criteria to determine whether collision and coalescence led to secondary ice multiplication. Over the four penetrations:<br><br>1. The droplet size distribution recorded by the SPP_100 must broaden and the mode bin size must increase. <br><br>2. The particle size distribution recorded by the CIP must broaden.<br><br>3. The CIP number max must peak during the sub-freezing or the secondary ice multiplication penetration.<br><br>4. The liquid water content must decrease.<br><br>5. Ice must be visible in the CIP images.<br><br>Results yielded that the cases matching the criteria supported ice multiplication. Two of the four cloud cases matched the criteria. The hypothesis was supported, collision and coalescence led to secondary ice multiplication. Next, the environmental conditions for the four cases were analyzed to organize trends to pinpoint clouds ideal for secondary ice multiplication.

GOT DIELECTRICS? SIMULATING THE ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES OF SEA ICE
Ryan Thomas Baker
Hillcrest High School, Midvale, UT

The health of polar sea ice packs is a leading indicator and predictor of global climate change, which is one of the most pressing problems currently facing the scientific community. In an effort to address this problem, researchers are working to better understand the physical and electrical properties of sea ice. Current understanding of these properties is limited due to the scarcity of collected data and difficulties associated with obtaining additional data. Developing a laboratory sea ice proxy that has many of the same properties as actual sea ice will increase scientists’ ability to study sea ice, interpret data about the current health of sea ice packs, improve models used to predict the future health of sea ice packs, and understand what action needs to be taken to mitigate the growing problem of global climate change. <br><br>The melting rate of sea ice is partly dependent on the electrical properties of permittivity and conductivity. I successfully developed a proxy for the electrical permittivity and conductivity of sea ice with values that are within the range of published data for actual sea ice. First, I made a proxy for sea water that matched published results and then I froze this solution to create a proxy for sea ice that matched published results. My proxy is a solution of distilled water with 41.5 ppt Instant Ocean salt and 18 ppt sugar. The Instant Ocean salt was used to obtain the correct conductivity and the sugar was used to obtain the correct permittivity.

THE SHAPE OF CHANGE: USING GRAPHICAL AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS TO ASSESS CURRENT AND FUTURE CLIMATE IN CENTRAL KANSAS
Nicholas Kalon Van Swol
Hiawatha High School/ Kansas Academy of Math and Science, Hiawatha/ Hays, KS

Much attention has been paid to climate change on a global scale, but little given to studies on changes in mirco-climates, specifically those in central Kansas. With 5% of Ellis county jobs linked to agriculture, it’s important to be aware of changes that may affect agricultural, mainly temperature and precipitation. With this in mind, a study was completed to see whether temperature of central Kansas has shown a measurable increase over the past 30 years, and if because of changing climate, rainfall and temperature levels show increasing levels of fluctuation. Data on the average monthly temperature and monthly precipitation of central was collected from the National Agricultural Statistics Service and Kansas Statistical Abstract over the past 30 years (1978-2007). Using this data, line-graphs of the entire temperature and precipitation data sets were generated, and line and bar graphs of each month showing year-to-year trends and fluctuations around the 30-year average. Graphs of the coefficient of variation on a yearly, monthly, and month-to-month were generated to study levels of variation within data sets. A trend-line was applied to each graph, to identify and give quantitative value to any trends. The confidence level for each trend was calculated using the R2. After analysis the data showed that the average monthly temperature of central Kansas has shown no measureable increase over the past 30 years. The data did seem to show a “flattening” trend in the temperature data over the average year. The data also showed marked increase in the levels of fluctuation.

DEVELOPING A PROCESS FOR SEISMO-ACOUSTIC IMAGING APPLIED TO HUMANITARIAN DEMINING
Marian Joan Bechtel
Lancaster Catholic High School, Lancaster

No current method exists, besides probing the ground with a spike, for detecting nonmetal landmines buried in wet soil. Even when deminers in this situation wear protective gear, they are injured or killed at a rate of about two casualties per 1000 mines removed. Many new methods are being investigated to help reduce this high casualty rate, as well as save time and money contributed to humanitarian demining. This study evaluates a novel seismo-acoustic detection idea, based on previous proof-of-concept research in this field. The experiment was designed to develop a method of seismo-acoustic imaging that could potentially detect both metal and plastic landmines, even in a wet medium.<br><br>Sound waves were projected at a sand test bed, in which objects (plastic and metal landmine simulants, and warzone clutter simulants) were buried, and a geophone recorded the vibrations of the bed on a grid, forming image pixels. The plastic and metal landmine simulants were tested in both dry and damp sand.<br><br>Differences in the spectrum of vibrations across the test bed were compared using Pearson Correlation Coefficients. A contour map was created using these correlation differences, distinctly showing the landmine locations in the test bed, even with wet sand. Furthermore, the clutter objects did not appear in images, indicating that this method may significantly reduce false positives. Statistical significance tests of the data validated the visual analysis.<br><br>These results demonstrated that seismo-acoustics could be useful and accurate in detection and discrimination of landmines, even when wet soil is encountered.

IDENTIFYING DIAGNOSTIC CHARACTERS IN THE TOOTH ENAMEL MICROSTRUCTURE OF DROMAEOSAURID DINOSAURS
Emma Justine Hoffman
Rondout Valley High School, Accord, NY

Isolated mammalian and non-mammalian amniote teeth are commonly found at a dig site, unaccompanied by diagnostic skeletal remains. Because of similarities in morphological features, many teeth cannot be identified past the family level, and some are even identified incorrectly. Enamel microstructural analysis has proven useful in the identification of isolated teeth, as well as in phylogenetic analyses. This study focuses on the Dromaeosauridae family, and examines five known genera (Bambiraptor feinbergi, Deinonychus antirrhopus, Dromaeosaurus sp, Saurornitholestes sp, and Velociraptor mongoliensis) and two unknown genera (an indeterminate Dromaeosaurid and “Paronychodon lacustris”). Each genus was found to have its own unique three-dimensional arrangement of enamel features, or schmelzmuster, making it distinguishable from the other specimens. The unknown specimens were each tentatively assigned to a known genus based on similarities in the schmelzmusters. Evidence was also found to support the hypothesis that enamel features are genus specific rather than individual specific. Since this study focuses on Dromaeosauridae alone, further studies should be conducted to show that this technique is applicable for other clades.

SEDIMENTARY VARVE RECORD OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE LAST DEGLACIATION OF CENTRAL NEW YORK
Hannah Rachel Valentino
Valentino Home School, Mexico, NY

About 10,000-12,000 years ago, the last continental glacier retreated north out of central New York leaving behind the till that forms the modern landscape. During the melting process, some sediment was deposited in glacial lakes that are now the locations of wet-lands (some are now muck farms). The sediments that underlie these wet-lands may include varve deposits. Individual varves are made up of alternating clay and silt/sand layers that are deposited during the fall-winter and spring-summer respectively. One varve represents one year. Because varves are deposited in water bodies adjacent to the glacier during the final retreat, they are a record of climate change. Sediment cores containing varves were collected from a wet-land located in New Haven, New York. The varve deposits occur in the uppermost 2-3 meters of the cores and are overlain by sand and peat deposits, indicating the infill of the lake with plant debris. There are 117 varves that range in thickness from 0.5 to 5.5 cm, with an average of about 2 cm. From bottom to top, the first 47 varves show a trend of mostly clay (>80%) to mostly sand (>90%). Varves 48 through 93 have a similar trend, followed by the last 24 varves with no apparent sediment composition trend. The thickness of the varve may be dependent on the distance to the sediment source (the glacier) and availability of sediment, while the trend in sediment type may reflect variations in seasons over the last century that glaciers occurred in central New York.

THE DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF A NOVEL, ECO-FRIENDLY CALCIUM IN SITU PRECIPITATION SYSTEM (ECIPS) FOR THE MITIGATION OF LIQUEFACTION-PRONE SOIL
Evelyn Chang
University High School, Irvine, CA

This research is to develop an eco-friendly approach of mitigating soil liquefaction by taking advantage of cost-effective organic products and recycling abundant food waste. This process has been proven to be effective in solidifying the loose and porous soil mass into a denser and less permeable state capable of resisting liquefaction during earthquakes. Three processes, namely Microbially-Induced Calcium Precipitation (MICP), Calcium In-Situ Precipitation System (CIPS), and the proposed Eco-Friendly Calcium In-Situ Precipitation System (ECIPS), have been experimented and compared. While MICP and CIPS are procedures relying on controlled environment, specially selected bacteria and/or particular commercial ingredients, the proposed ECIPS method causes calcium precipitation to occur within soil mass through permeation with a solution made of egg shells, vinegar, urea and baking soda. Samples were tested, incorporating variables such as: the components and proportioning of different solutions and the gradation of tested soils. Soil samples were subjected to repeated tests consisting of gradation, direct shear, and unconfined compression. The results indicate: 1) the delicate bacteria selection and the highly controlled environment of MICP process is too difficult to be duplicated, with the effect of bacteria undistinguishable; 2) the CIPS process could increase soil strength and reduce soil permeability substantially, but the materials used may not be eco-friendly; and 3) the proposed ECIPS process was able to improve the cohesion and the compressive strength of the tested soils substantially, thus rendering the treated soils liquefaction-proof. The ECIPS process also proves to be eco-friendly, minimally intrusive, cost effective and easily executable.

THE EFFECT OF INCREASED CO2 EMISSIONS ON COASTAL EROSION CONTRIBUTORS IN ALASKA
Kelsey Ann Meacham
West Anchorage High School, Anchorage, AK

This project explored the effects of increased CO2 emissions on the coastal erosion contributors of surface air temperature, sea ice coverage, and precipitation in Alaska. <br><br>Projected CO2 emission levels were based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s scenario A1 Fossil Intensive (FI). The temperature, sea ice, and precipitation data were obtained using the NASA GISS Global Climate Model II. <br><br>The data was compared to a control run to determine the amount of change between modern conditions and those projected at the end of the century under the A1FI scenario. Data for surface air temperature shows an increase of two to seven degrees Celsius by the year 2100. Sea ice coverage will decrease by 25 to 50 percent, and precipitation will increase by .25 mm to 1 mm per day. These factors would contribute to accelerated coastal erosion. <br><br>Understanding future outcomes based on specific scenarios allows for planned mitigation of effects. This project is relevant in helping to plan and proactively react to coastal erosion caused by climate change in Alaska.

THE EFFECT OF CATASTROPHIC FOREST FIRES ON THE HYDROLOGIC PROPERTIES OF MAZAMA ASH SOILS IN SOUTHERN OREGON
Rachel Jane Porter
Tillamook High School, Tillamook, OR

Due to the beetle kill of Contorta Pine in southern Oregon, trees are falling jackstraw on the forest floor. If a catastrophic fire were to come through, it would devastate the entire ecosystem. When Mazama ash soils are burned the top layer becomes cracked and powered. The heat of the fire decreases porosity on the top layer and essentially turns the soil hydrophobic which over a short amount of time causes erosion. When burned, Hydrocarbons from the wood, litter and duff are pushed beneath the top layer. The soil that is forced beneath the top layer increases in size because when carbohydrates in the soil are burned, incomplete combustion happens and the soil plasticizes increasing porosity and decreasing water holding capacity, causing the soil to have negative water properties. The plasticized soil then cools and solidifies one centimeter bellow the surface. To test this, I collected Mazama ash soil and naturally burned it. After the burn I performed water holding capacity and percolation tests to see how the soil would react. To prevent forest fires in southern Oregon one suggestion for change could be salvage logging to remove some on the trees that lay on the forest floor.

QUANTIFYING HYDROPERIOD FLUCTUATIONS ACROSS AN EVERGLADES WETLAND THROUGH MICROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF SILICEOUS MICROFOSSILS
Christopher Allen Sanchez
Felix Varela Senior High School, Miami, FL

Everglades research is in dire need of new paleological approaches to analyzing historical climate-driven hydrological trends across the wetlands. These trends include both hydroperiod, which is the length of inundation, and hydropattern, which is the depth of inundation. Traditionally biological proxies such as seeds, pollen, and charcoal have been used to interpret these climactic conditions in order to better understand the dynamic hydrology of the Everglades. However, research conducted in the past year indicated that phytoliths are also viable biomarkers which can be used to reconstruct the overall vegetative make-up of the wetlands. This data is then placed in the context of the hydrological affinities of key Everglades plant species so that hydrology can be inferred.<br><br> In a follow up to previous research, this investigation not only expands number of cores used, but analyzes all microfossils found instead of just phytoliths. These microfossils include phytoliths, diatoms, sclerids, and sponge components. The objective is to quantify microfossil abundance and, using known diatom optimal hydroperiods, determine the historic changes in general Everglades hydroperiods. Everglades research has typically been hesitant to expand investigations of siliceous microfossils into the inner-Everglades because of the dissolution which takes places in wetlands cores. This dissolution makes it very tedious to find any traces of phytoliths or diatomaceous microfossils. <br><br> Two soil cores were sliced, oxidized, and mounted onto slides. Initial examinations revealed that phytoliths were either not present or too ambiguous to analyze, but a significant presence of diatoms will allow comprehensive quantitative analysis of historical inundation trends in the Everglades.

CLIMATOLOGICAL PREDICTIONS FOR THE NORTHWEST PASSAGE: UNMASKING THE SIGNAL
Zachariah Quinn Moustafa
Alexander W. Dreyfoos High School of the Arts, West Palm Beach, FL

The northern high latitudes are experiencing greater warming than other region of the Earth. In the last three decades, climate change has caused an estimated 25% decline in Arctic sea-ice coverage, shrinking at a rate of approximately 8.5% per decade. With this recent warming and reductions in ice cover, there is a newfound interest in using the Northwest Passage (NWP) that connects Europe and Asia, as a shipping route during the summer, saving 8705 km versus transiting the Panama Canal. This year’s research tested a new, and powerful graphical and statistical method called Cumulative Rate of Variation (CRV) to highlight the internal structure of Arctic climatological time series data, to determine trends, cycles and seasonal variations, and to better predict the future opening of the NWP. Here, raw time series data is transformed into percent cumulative data, where each converted point measures the cumulative deviation of the measurements normalized to an average trend so the transformed data becomes a proxy for relative rate of variation. CRV analysis results, based on approximately 60 years of monthly air and water temperature, and ice thickness measurements from across the NWP, exhibit an overall decreasing secular trend that began in the late 1980s and falls below the data’s average in the late 1990’s, when a dramatic increase in the rate of change (slope) occurs. Ice thickness trends have dropped below the data average within the past ten years, while both air and water temperatures continue to rise at an alarming rate.

The aim of this work was to identify gastropod fossils together with stratigraphy of limestone in order to find out the paleaonenvironment of Khao Noi, Amphoe Takhli, Changwat Nakhonsawan, central Thailand. The study area was divided into two locations: Location 1 has the UTM gird reference of collecting location is 654786 E 1693614 N 81 meters above mean sea level and Location 2 has the UTM gird reference of collecting location is 654311 E 1693697 N 138 meters above mean sea leve,l Dip 41 Strike102.Three genera of gastropods i.e. Lophosplia sp., Trepospina sp. and Murchisonia sp. and two species i.e. Naticopsis minoensis and Naticopsis sp.cf.N. paraealta were found. The age of limestone was estimated according to Fusulinids study, i.e. Verbeekina verbeeki , to be Middle to Late Permain (Strat Artinskian-Kungurian). Most of the limestones in the area were muddy limestone, limestone, argillaceous limestone with some chert nodule Dolomitic limestone occured in the upper part of the area. Colony coral, sponge and fragments of unidentified fossils were commonly observed apart from mollusca and fusulinids. Limestone strata lie in NE-SW direction and dipping about 40 degree to the southwest. Judging from the above studies, the study area was once under the shallow sea with back reef and rich resource for marine invertebrate.

DOES WELL DEPTH AFFECT TETRACYCLINE CONCENTRATIONS IN GROUND WATER?
Frederick Thomas Duemling
Saint Clair High School, Saint Clair, MI

Antibiotics are an important part of the agricultural industry. Once excreted, from livestock, the antibiotics can directly enter surface, and/or ground waters via run off from barn areas. Additionally, in areas where manure is applied to the land and where there are holding ponds, there can be additional transfer of these antibiotics. However, there is little research on how deep into the ground tetracycline is found. The purpose of this experiment is to discover if there is a presence of the pharmaceutical Tetracycline, in Michigan area wells. This research will look specifically at well depth and track any evidence of tetracycline. The effect of well depth on the concentration of tetracycline will be addressed. If Tetracycline is found, it is hypothesized that, if the well depth increases then the concentration of Tetracycline will decrease. Samples were taken from six wells of varying depth. ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) testing was used and no evidence of Tetracycline was found. The hypothesis was neither accepted nor rejected. No evidence of Tetracycline was found. Therefore it is still not know if the concentration of tetracycline lessens as the well depth increases.

DON'T LET IT SLIDE IV: FIRE FACTOR!
Majdolene Ziad Khweis
Taos High School, Taos, NM

In 2009, wildfires destroyed approximately 5,914,821 acres. This damage has a detrimental impact on the environment, and re-growth is difficult due to water erosion. The purpose of this project is to determine if Polyethylene Oxide (PolyOx) and Ammonium Nitrate (AN) can be used to regenerate damage caused by a forest fire by preventing water erosion and stimulating plant growth. It is hypothesized that the fire will kill all of the soil's bacteria and nutrients. PolyOx will adhere to the soil and seeds to prevent water erosion. PolyOx infused with AN will retain the nutrients in place throughout water erosion, allowing for nutrient and bacteria regeneration, as well as alfalfa growth. <br><br> Simulate a forest fire. Re-grow the damaged area by applying PolyOx and AN to the soil. Observe if PolyOx and AN decrease the amount of water erosion that occurs, and help improve plant growth, plant height, soil moisture, and soil bacteria. <br><br> After 8 days, it was observed that trials with both PolyOx and AN improved the re-growth process. The trials with PolyOx experienced up to 94% less alfalfa erosion. The trials with both PolyOx and AN had the least alfalfa growth and soil bacteria because of the bactericidal affects of PolyOx and AN. Although the trials with both PolyOx and AN had less alfalfa growth and bacteria, they had less alfalfa erosion, better moisture levels, and greater plant heights. This indicates that for the trials without PolyOx, the nutrients were expended solely on plant growth and not on plant health. <br><br> In conclusion, the data indicates that PolyOx and AN can be used to re-grow damaged forests. The PolyOx/AN solution significantly helped to prevent water erosion and stimulate plant growth.

CHANGE WE CAN BELIEVE IN: EVOLUTION OF TIDAL CONSTITUENTS IN THE PACIFIC BASIN
Andrei Secasiu, Hari Caushik, Himanshu Pandey
Westview High School, Portland, OR

In order to understand changes in ocean trends, it is necessary to have a comprehensive understanding of how tidal properties are changing. Changes in tidal properties can have dramatic effects on weather, the environment, and the economy. This study looks at changes in tidal properties, specifically increase in amplitude and phase shifts across the entire Pacific Basin. Tidal data for lengths of 40 and 50 years are available at multiple stations across the Pacific, which can be plotted as a set of thousands of points. A function which best fit the points was calculated using a method known as Robust Least Square Analysis, and tidal properties were calculated from this equation. From the analysis, it was seen that tidal amplitudes are rising by as much as 6.3 cm, which leads to a much greater increase in observed sea level due to natural oscillation of tides. The application of Robust Least Squares in tidal analysis has never been previously attempted on a basin wide scale, and its successful application will pave the road to further accuracy in tidal analysis. Perhaps more importantly, recognition of tidal trends allows for prediction of the often harmful results of large scale tidal changes.

THE DOMINO EFFECT OF GLOBAL WARMING: AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF THE POSITIVE FEEDBACK MECHANISM (PFM) DUE TO GLOBAL WARMING ON METHANE EMISSIONS AND A MODEL TO QUANTIFY ITS WORLDWIDE EFFECT IN THE 21ST CENTURY FROM ANTHROPOGENIC AND NATURAL WETLANDS
Priyam C Shah, Naomi C. Shah, 
Sunset High School, Portland, OR

No climate model currently incorporates the amplifying feedback from methane released. This novel research studied the Positive Feedback Mechanism (PFM) due to increasing global temperatures that catalyze the production of methane (CH4). The premise of the project relied upon the fact that the activity of CH4 producing enzymes, belonging to the methanopterin and formylmethanofuran groups, increases with rising temperatures. Given methane’s high radiative forcing, increased emissions will cause more warming, thus creating a continuous PFM cycle. It was hypothesized that the PFM exists, and therefore current CH4 emission projections from anthropogenic and natural wetlands are understated. Starting in June 2009, a scientific approach in a greenhouse was utilized to measure the effect of temperature on methane effluxes. Wetlands were simulated in tubs by controlling delineation parameters, maintaining two sets of tubs at different temperatures. The hypothesis was supported: methane effluxes almost doubled with 3.4oC warming (n=28; p=0.02). The Q10 value —a factor indicative of flux changes over a 10oC warming – was subsequently calculated. A model was developed to apply the experimental Q10, IPCC temperature, and NEAA methane projections to 4207 worldwide grids. The model predicted that the PFM will contribute roughly 24,000 Teragrams of CH4, or 0.5 Million Teragrams CO2e—from wetlands alone. The failure to incorporate the PFM could result in a misunderstanding of future warming and untargeted remediation efforts. Future research must focus on determining regional Q10 values and assessing the PFM across all methane sources. Field studies at Oregon wetlands are planned for 2010.

ESR DATING EARLY MEN AND THEIR TOOLS AT PRADAYROL, FRANCE AND AINIKAB I, RUSSIA: "SO EASY A CAVEMAN CAN DO IT!"
Xiao Y. Zhou, Israt J. Ahmed, Stephanie S. Chen
Francis Lewis High School, Fresh Meadows, NY

The Out of Africa hypothesis proposes that the first wave of early hominids left sub-Saharan Africa before 1.8 Ma (i.e., before the Olduvai subchron). The Oldowan tools discovered at Ainikab I, Dagestan, show that early hominids had moved north across the Russian plains earlier in their migration than previously thought. An adult Neanderthal incisor deposited with extinct Middle Pleistocene fauna were found in Pradayrol, France. Burrows and a debris flow deposit, however, make it uncertain that the teeth from the Pradayrol beds are in situ. To date the hominid migration, six bovid teeth from Pradayrol, France, and one Equus tooth from Ainikab I, Dagestan, Russia, were dated by standard electron spin resonance (ESR). ESR can date fossilized teeth from 10 ka to 5 Ma, by comparing the accumulated radiation dose with the total radiation dose rate from the tooth and its environment. High in U, the Ainikab Equus tooth probably dates at greater than or equal to 852 ± 27 ka, assuming that some recent U uptake has occurred. At Pradayrol, dates of 384 ± 7 ka for a layer below that containing the Neanderthal tooth indicate that the beds are in stratigraphic succession. Thus, the Neanderthal tooth and its associated deposit are probably in situ and date to 330 ± 3 ka, making it the oldest Neanderthal yet found. More dates for teeth from Ainikab are needed to ensure that the tools are in situ. For both sites, coupled ESR-230Th/234U and isochron analyses will be needed to ascertain the teeth's U uptake models.

EFFECT OF SOLAR EXPOSURE ON THE ATOMIC OXYGEN EROSION OF HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE BI-STEM THERMAL SHIELD ALUMINIZED-TEFLON FEP
Aobo Guo, Claire Ashmead, 
Hathaway Brown School, Shaker Heights, OH

External spacecraft materials, when in low Earth orbit (LEO), degrade due to radiation, thermal cycling, micrometeoroids/debris impacts, and atomic oxygen (AO) interaction. AO erosion of polymeric components is a serious threat to spacecraft performance and durability. It is, therefore, essential to understand the AO erosion yield, Ey, the volume loss per incident oxygen atom (cm3/atom), of polymers for spacecraft applications. Effects of solar exposure on AO Ey are currently under debate in the space community. This research addresses the AO erosion of a commonly used spacecraft thermal control material, aluminized-Teflon fluorinated ethylene propylene (Al-FEP). Aimed to determine whether solar radiation exposure increases the degradation rate of Al-FEP, this study utilized Al-FEP thermal shields that were exposed to the space environment for 8.25 years aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The thermal shields were wrapped around solar array poles such that half of the circular shield received direct solar exposure, while the other half received very little solar exposure. The AO Ey of 16 HST BSTS samples were determined in an air-operated radio-frequency plasma asher. The average solar facing Ey was found to be 1.2 x 10-24 cm3/atom, while the average anti-solar Ey was found to be1.0 x 10-24 cm3/atom, resulting in an erosion rate that is 20% higher for solar-facing samples. This data provides evidence that solar exposure impacts the Ey of FEP; hence, solar exposure cannot be overlooked when designing spacecraft components based on expected Ey. The results of this research could considerably impact future space vehicle design considerations.

Gudul is a traditional heating system which was created by our ancestors. This study is focused to the developments of new flooring material through the physical and chemical analyses of the Gudul rocks. The study proceeded with selecting the theme and study areas, sampling, geological survey, several analyses of the rocks, development of new floor material(a kind of porcelain). <br><br> Gudul rocks sampled from a totoal of twenty one cities and counties are assinged to nine tuffs, five quartz porphyries, four gneisses and three schists in rock type. From the geological study, these rocks are very similar to ones in surrounding areas. Comparing Gudul rocks to others not used in Ondol, Gudul rocks show low densities, higher porosities and brittle features. Analyzed in thermal properties the rocks are lower in conductivity but higher in conservation and resistance in the aspects of the properties.<br><br>Considering mutual relations between thermal properties and chemistries of the rocks, conservative chatacteristics are proportional to MgO contents but not to SiO2. In particular, minute quartz grains in the rocks were gradually cracked and rejected under torch flames. Those features may indicate that quartz grains are closely related with the thermal resistances of the rocks. On the basis of above rock characteristics, new flooring material was made. The material includes the mixed states of amphibolite sludges with high MgO contents and white china soils (bearing kaolinte). Then, the material was tested in the above thermal properties under the varialble mixed ratios. At the results, 4:6 (sluge : soil) ratio was the most excellent among above tested maerials. So, the textiles used in architecture and the electric heating cushion and the mugs were produced as test goods.

KILLER WATER: AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE LETHAL LAKE NYOS
Burke Lelynn Larsen
Brush High School, Brush, CO

In 1986, Lake Nyos in Cameroon spewed forth multiple tons of carbon dioxide gas, killing almost 1,800 people and all animal life in the surrounding area. This phenomenon is known as a limnic eruption. Many theories exist as to the cause of this limnic eruption; the most probably one states that temperature stratification and a sudden interruption in the strata caused cold, carbon dioxide saturated water to rise to the surface where it warmed up. As it warmed up, it released the carbon dioxide dissolved in it.<br><br> The purpose of this project is to test the conditions of Lake Nyos to determine whether this theory is supported by evidence on a small scale. Multiple experiments were used to determine if carbon dioxide dissolves better in colder water, if carbon dioxide saturated water releases carbon dioxide when warmed up, if temperature stratification in a body of water is possible, if an interruption in the stratification will cause upward currents in the water, and if the phenomenon occurring in Lake Nyos can be successfully recreated on a small scale.<br><br> After experimentation, it was determined that all the conditions that were present in Lake Nyos at the time of the release of carbon dioxide could have contributed to the eruption. It was concluded that an interruption in temperature stratification by surface cooling was the possible cause of the release of carbon dioxide from Lake Nyos. Knowing the reason for the eruption is the first step in stopping it from happening again.

"HIGH NOON" IS NOT TWELVE SHARP!: (WHICH COMPLICATES) THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PRECISE SUNDIAL
Martin Herbert Dehn
Hanns-Seidel-Gymnasium Hosbach, Hosbach, Bavaria, GERMANY

If the sun were in the south at twelve o'clock every day, it would be easy to build a precise sundial. In fact, the sun is faster or slower, depending on the season. Therefore average sundials are as far as a quarter of an hour early or late.<br><br>If a deviation from clocktime is to avoid, it is necessary to account for the elliptical orbit and the inclination of the Earth’s axis.<br><br>The dialplates of most sundials, that work precisely by considering these astronomical facts, have a complex design. Only few viewers are able to determine the time from the position of the shade without having prior knowledge.<br><br>To allow for an easy dialplate, it is required to take into account the astronomical facts in the geometry of the gnomon. One such kind of gnomon is the “Bernhardt Roller”, which displays the time precisely at a specific location.<br><br>Based on the knowledge of the functioning of this gnomon, the functionality of such a clock has been developed and presented. The specific shapes of the gnomon have been calculated independently and a program was written, displaying the geometry of the gnomon with the help of a CAD program. This process was followed by constructing the sundial. It was build from ordinary and cheap material and independently to as far an extent as possible. Because of the fact that the scale and the inclination are adjustable, it is possible to install the sundial not only at one location, but almost everywhere.

MAPPING THE GEOLOGY OF MARS: THE USE OF THE THEMIS THERMAL INERTIA IMAGING INDEX TO INFORM FUTURE EXPLORATION AND SAMPLING SITES
Chelsea Destiny Derrick
Cloquet Senior High School, Cloquet, MN

In order to initiate a base and research site on Mars, safe landing and research locations need to be established. The question is how can thermal inertia data be used to create a Mars surface map index? The hypothesis states if Mars thermal inertia data is used, then a map index can be created to infer surface rock size, informing possible landing and sampling sight locations. Thermal inertia is a measure of the rate an object heats up and/or cools down. The faster an object heats and subsequently cools, the smaller the thermal inertia unit (tiu). Thermal inertia units range from 1 to 1,000 tiu’s. Rocks with high surface area to volume ratios (relatively smaller rocks) have low thermal inertia readings compared to larger rocks with lower surface area to volume ratios. Therefore, average thermal inertia data was used to infer the average rock size of a specific mapped area on Mars. Two-hundred sample maps/photos were collected along 20±20 degrees north latitude, within the high resolution areas. Thermal inertia data was organized into 20 subunits of 50 tiu’s. For each of the 20 subunits, five high resolution map images were collected, and average thermal inertia was calculated. NASA should be able to use this map index that correlates the images with the thermal inertia data to make informed decisions on landing and rock sampling sites. Based on the map index created, the smooth surface of the thermal inertia interval 0-50 would be the best landing site for the Mars rover.

THE CORONAE PARADOX: THE USE OF VISUAL BASIC TO DETERMINE CIRCULAR LOW FORMATION BASED UPON MAPS CREATED USING MAGELLAN RADAR DATA IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE PROCESS(ES) OF CORONAE FORMATION AND THE OVERALL GEOLOGIC HISTORY OF CIRCULAR LOWS ON VENUS, PHASE IV
Courtney Catherine Jackson
Cloquet Senior High School, Cloquet, MN

Visual Basic is an integrated development environment (IDE), which provides the tools for creating computer programs. Geologists use Magellan radar data to create geologic maps of Venus’ surface, specifically to determine circular low formation processes. A circular low is a subset feature of a crater like depression called a coronae; a term that describes shape and possible formation processes (McDaniel and Hansen, 2005). The question is can the use of Visual Basic determine circular low formation based upon maps created using Magellan radar data in order to determine the process(es) of coronae formation and the overall geologic history of circular lows on Venus. The researcher mapped V20, V60a, V60b and V60c, and remapped V33 datasets. A program was created in Visual Basic designed to delineate multiple formation processes for circular lows on Venus. The user of the program selects characteristics seen on a mapping area. Depending on the characteristics selected, the program indicates what is expected for the hypotheses compared to what was observed, calculates the Chi-square, and the probability of significance. Comparisons were made between the researcher’s maps and to observe any feature commonalities between map sites and the formation processes. A global study of the circular lows comparing the mapped areas from this study to fifty-six mapped areas by Shankar and Hansen (2007) was also done. Ellipticity, depth of circular low, and diameter of crater were main points of observation. Features that were common in both studies supported endogenetic formation.

ASTRONOMICAL IMAGE PROCESSING: ELIMINATING RANDOM ATMOSPHERIC NOISE AND ENHANCING LOW RESOLUTION IMAGES, YEAR III
Amy Charlotte Robinson
Keystone School, San Antonio, TX

Visual noise, the interference of image signals, can both enhance and hinder astronomical imaging. The purpose of this year’s study was to quantitatively test subjective conclusions from previous years (2007 and 2008). Previous work indicated that: a) the addition of visual noise improved poorly resolved images, and b) the averaging of pictures decreased simulated atmospheric noise. In the current year, image improvement was judged to occur if the distribution of the pixel difference between paired images (before and after addition of visual noise) was minimized. The same approach was used to determine if atmospheric noise could be eliminated by image averaging.<br><br> UTILIZING VISUAL NOISE: A picture of the M81 galaxy was modified with varying levels of pixelation. Visual noise was added in the form of a 50% blur. Images with and without noise were compared to the original image in the process described above. Comparisons of the variances of the resulting difference pictures indicated statistically significant improvement (p< 0.01).<br><br> ELIMINATING VISUAL NOISE: Simulated atmospheric noise was added to a picture of the M81 galaxy by placing it under a glass dish of perturbed water and taking pictures through the water using a fast shutter speed. Images with atmospheric noise were averaged and analyzed with regard to image clarity. Improvement of the image was found to be statistically significant (p<0.01).<br><br> Both techniques quantitatively improved images and similar approaches may be applicable to the field of astronomy and other imaging-based field to resolve details in poor quality images.

CONFIRMATION OF ERATOSTHENES' EXPERIMENT: THE DIAMETER OF THE EARTH DETERMINED USING A SUNDIAL
Holly Elizabeth Peterson
Sherando High School, Stephens City, VA

This study proposed to answer the question, “Can the diameter of the Earth be determined using a sundial?” Eratosthenes is notes for computing the size of the Earth. Remarkably, he determined the circumference just 100 miles over the actual circumference. Details of this method were published but unfortunately were lost, but are known indirectly from other authors. The hypothesis is that the time measurements taken by using a sundial can be used to calculate the diameter of the Earth within reasonable limits. This hypothesis is plausible based on the reference outlines involving methods of calculating the diameter of the Earth. This study used a different technique than the one Eratosthenes performed. This study used two cities of the same latitude, the distance between then, and finally the time difference of the shadow that cast between them. The diameter of the Earth was experimentally determined to be 11,784km which is 7.62% off from the accepted value.

Last year in the United States, wildfires destroyed approximately 3.5 million acres of land. This damage has a detrimental impact on the environment & re-growth is difficult due to water erosion. The purpose of this project is to determine whether the polymer, Polyethylene Oxide (PolyOx) is biodegradable & environmentally safe when used to prevent water erosion after a wildfire. It is hypothesized that the polymer will prevent water erosion & improve plant & soil health. By evaporating the alcohol from the polymer, soil bacteria survival will increase & the polymer will biodegrade. <br><br> To test this, simulate a forest fire. Re-grow the damaged area by applying PolyOx to the soil. Observe if PolyOx decreases the amount of water erosion that occurs, improves plant growth, plant height, & soil moisture, bacteria, carbon dioxide, dissolved oxygen, & pH levels. <br><br> After five days, it was observed that PolyOx prevented water erosion up to 96%. The polymer allowed for greater moisture retention & therefore greater plant heights. However, the trials containing the polymer experienced less alfalfa growth. This is because the sprouts had to break through the PolyOx surface barrier. The polymer helped stabilize the damaged soil & return conditions back to their original pH, dissolved oxygen, & plant height levels before the fire. Additionally, evaporating alcohol from the polymer noticeably increased soil bacteria survival. With increased bacteria, the carbon dioxide levels in the soil rose significantly as the soil microorganisms decomposed the polymer. Biodegradation was also evident microscopically & in the drop of soil moisture for trials containing PolyOx. <br><br> <br><br> In conclusion, PolyOx is bio-friendly & can be used to reclaim land damaged by wildfires.

ULTRAVIOLET ABSORPTION VS. SUN PROTECTION FACTOR
Caraline Nicole Vaughn
Nettleton High School, Jonesboro, AR

This experiment tested the absorption of UV radiation when captured under various sunscreen SPF’s and tanning accelerators. From past years research and experimenting, seeing that surface reflection made no significant difference when using Vernier LabQuest, testing was only conducted on a grass surface this year. Due to past experimenting and research, it was suggested that UV radiation should be absorbed by higher sunscreen SPF, but UVB in particular should be absorbed more so than UVA and sunscreen with SPF above 30 will not have a significant difference in absorption. This experiment explored how different sunscreen SPF’s and tanning accelerators effect the absorption of UV radiation compared to no sun lotion application. <br><br>Each day experimenting was performed; four sets of UVA/UVB sensors were set out in an unshaded, open area to collect for 10 hours. There was a spread of clear plastic wrap over each set of UVA/UVB sensors. On three of the sets sunscreen or tanning accelerator was applied, and one set was left untouched as a control. After collecting from 7:00 A.M.-5:00 P.M., graphs were retrieved from the LabQuest and results from that day were analyzed and saved for further reviewing.<br><br>UVB, what causes tanning and sunburn, is completely blocked out with every sunscreen. So, broad spectrum is protecting from UVB radiation. With each advancing SPF UVA (causes skin cancer, aging, etc.) protection increases as well, allowing less percent of absorption from UV radiation. True protection in sunscreen comes in higher SPF’s.

Mohamed Maamoon Sehimat
Zaud Bin Al- Hareth, Karak, JORDAN

This project aims at finding a device for finding out the strength of mechanical vibration including earthquakes by transferring the mechanical waves into sound waves that are translated into electric energy by a sensitive microphone using the Blue tooth technique those vibrations will be recorded by using a computer program that can form the earth vibrations on the screen of the computer besides saving the data for so long. In addition to that, some simple techniques were used for designing that device including the sensitive microphone. A laptop computer, plastic slides and springs. the device was examined with many variables such as the depth of the device in the ground, the mass of the fallen body and the vertical distance of falling, then it was found through the result of the experiment the success of the device in providing exact and fixed readings which makes it certain to use that device in finding out mechanical vibrations and measuring them.

INVESTIGATING CLIMATE CHANGE: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF COLONIAL AND MODERN WEATHER DATA
Marni Jordyn Wasserman
Commack High School, Commack, NY

The goal of this investigation was to determine the effectiveness of using colonial era weather data to study climate trends in the northeastern United States and to create a model for comparing historical weather data to modern data. One of the hottest topics facing our generation is developing a more complete understanding of global weather patterns. Recovering and utilizing all relevant and historical information is crucial for the development of models needed to predict future climate trends. Most information about weather prior to 150 years ago has been derived from secondary sources such as tree rings, ice cores, and coral reefs that only provide relative temperatures. Since the advent of standardized thermometers, in the early 1700s, much detailed historical information exists, but at this point has not been fully utilized. Reliable colonial weather data based on direct human observations offer a unique window into past climate conditions. The goals of this investigation were reached by comparing colonial weather data recorded near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by Phineas Pemberton, to data from 1878-1882 and 2005-2009 from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Results show that since the 1700s, not only have the average temperatures increased significantly, but the distribution of higher temperatures has changed dramatically. In 1759, 1767-1770, there was not one day over 90ºF, but in the 2000s in Philadelphia there were 45 days over 90ºF. Utilizing relevant historical data is crucial for the development of models to predict future climate trends. Colonial era data represents a potential source of untapped useful climate data.

COMPARING KEPLER'S 3RD LAW TO THE CURVATURE OF A TRAMPOLINE
Melissa Anne Guarisco
St. Jospeh's Academy, Baton Rouge, LA

The purpose of this experiment was to confirm that a planet’s orbital period, or time it takes to complete one orbit, is predictably connected to the size of the planetary orbit. This was tested by using a trampoline to illustrate space-time to find a varied version of Kepler’s 3rd Law, P^2 = r^3. A total of 115 lbs was laced at the center of the trampoline. A ball was then rolled through a PVC pipe onto the trampoline to give it a constant initial speed. The time it took to complete a quarter of the orbit as well as one full orbit was measured in seconds. The measures of the initial and final radius of the orbit were also taken for a quarter of the orbit as well as for the full orbit. The average of the initial and final distance from the center of the trampoline was then found. The logarithms of the time and the average distance were then plotted on a scatter graph. Two separate equations for the varied version of Kepler’s 3rd Law were derived from the slope of the line of best fit. The equation for the quarter of the orbit was P^2 = r^3.7258. The equation for the full orbit was P^2 = r^1.9132. These two equations show that the trampoline does not curve at the same rate as space-time. They also illustrate the relationship between the orbital period and the radius of an orbit.

EARTH'S MAGNETOSPHERE AS A COMPLEX NETWORK
Julia Rose Kahn Cline
Walt Whitman High School, Bethesda, MD

This research discovered complex network behavior in the Earth’s magnetosphere by analyzing geomagnetic data from ground-based magnetometers, providing a better understanding of how the Earth’s magnetosphere behaves and potentially offering an opportunity to mitigate the harmful effects of solar weather. Solar weather can cause satellite failure, trigger power grid collapse, and disrupt flight patterns and high frequency communication. As recently as October and November 2003, solar activity resulted in widespread high frequency communication disruptions in the southern hemisphere around Australia and New Zealand, high frequency aircraft communications degradation on a global scale, power grid overload and failure in Malmoe, Sweden, and temporary shutdown of the Japanese Kodama satellite. I theorized that there could be a direct relationship between geomagnetic disturbance and the interactions between magnetometers. To test this theory, magnetic field values from 154 ground-based magnetometers were collected and analyzed using complex network theory. MATLAB scripts were written to display quantitative analyses and visual representations of the complex network, in order to evaluate whether the magnetosphere could be analyzed as a complex network and, if so, what trends it followed. Periods of low geomagnetic disturbance served as the control group. Representations of the magnetometers on the globe illustrated that the magnetosphere behaves as a complex network. During geomagnetic storms, there were more magnetometers with a higher number of connections, strongly supporting the hypothesis. The findings offer an opportunity to better understand the behavior of the magnetosphere and to potentially alleviate the damage due to solar weather.

A STUDY OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CURRENT AND THE SEICHE IN LAKE SUPERIOR AT BAYFIELD, WI
Alexandra Jean Gephart
Bayfield High School, Bayfield, WI

Large bodies of water such as Lake Superior exhibit seiche and current activity. The seiche, which is caused by wind disturbances and pressure differences, results in a vertical movement of the surface of a body of water. Winds are also a definite factor causing surface currents, which is the horizontal flow of water. Currents also might be affected by water influx and outflow from streams and rivers. The purpose of this project was to explore the possibility of a relationship between the seiche and near-shore surface currents in Lake Superior at Bayfield, WI. The hypothesis is that there will be a corresponding horizontal flow associated with these seiche events. When a seiche causes the water level to rise in Bayfield there will be a corresponding current flowing into the area, and when a seiche causes the water level to fall there will be a corresponding current flowing out of the area. A mathematical model of the seiche at Bayfield was developed using data from a previous seiche study. Data was collected within five meters of the shoreline from June 2010 to November 2010. The data collection devices were placed in locations that were protected from wave action. The data collected does not show a strong relationship between the seiche and current. At times, there is a measurable current that corresponds to an incoming or outgoing seiche. However, that relationship is not consistently observed. Wind data collected in Duluth, MN appears to correlate more closely with the current data.

CHARACTERIZING ENGINEERED TIO2 NANOPARTICLE ADHESION: IMPLICATIONS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL TRANSPORT AND REMEDIATION
Eric E. Fein
John Adams High School, South Bend, IN

Engineered TiO2 nanoparticle use is skyrocketing, they may be toxic, and their mobility in geologic systems has not been characterized. This two-part study 1) isolated and determined the role of mineral surface adhesion on TiO2 nanoparticle transport in groundwater and 2) applied that information to develop and test a strategy to remove nanoparticles from water. The first experiments characterized the nature and extent of TiO2 adhesion onto mica as a function of pH using atomic force and scanning electron microscopy. Results indicate nanoparticle adhesion depends strongly on pH, with extensive adhesion at pH 3.5 and 8.0, and very little at pH 6.0. These results demonstrate that nanoparticle adhesion can occur, and that pH affects nanoparticle mobility in groundwater systems. For water with pH near 6, mica would not be a suitable sorbent for TiO2 nanoparticle removal. Therefore, the second set of experiments quantified the ability of Fe-oxide coated sand particles to remove TiO2 nanoparticles from water as a function of pH and sand quantity. Fe-oxide is an inexpensive material with dramatically different surface charge from mica and may show different adhesion behavior. In contrast to mica, Fe-oxide showed maximum nanoparticle adhesion at pH 6. Up to 98% of the TiO2 nanoparticles were removed from suspension by exposure to Fe-oxide. This study shows that in typical groundwater systems, nanoparticle transport will depend strongly on the type of minerals present. My experiments also demonstrate that Fe-oxide coated sand particles are potentially an effective tool for remediation of water contaminated by TiO2 nanoparticles.

GREEN ENERGY FROM THE DEEP BLUE: USING KITES TO GENERATE ELECTRICAL ENERGY FROM OCEAN CURRENTS
Rohan Thakur
Clark High School, Plano, TX

The world depends on oil, but by 2015 the world’s supply will fail to meet demands. Recently, the importance of alternative energy has increased. Although wind power is emphasized, ocean currents have more potential due to their greater density and predictability. The experiment compared the effectiveness of energy harvesting designs for ocean currents, specifically testing a kite based turbine and innovative Venturi Apparatus (researcher’s design). It was hypothesized that the kite based turbine would be more effective in energy generation than the Venturi Apparatus. <br><br> PVC pipes and a water pump were used to simulate ocean currents. Both turbines were placed in tank and connected to an oscilloscope measuring the output voltage (used to calculate power). It was believed that increasing water speed would increase the efficiency of the turbine, because the momentum of the turbine increases with faster currents. However at higher speeds, the increased resistance negates improvement. <br><br> With the increase in water speed, the Venturi’s improvement declined from 229% to 8%, while the Kite decreased from 470% to -2%. A student T-test found that, the null hypothesis was rejected with confidence level of 99.75%. However, the experiment proved that in higher velocities, the Venturi Apparatus was more effective, while the kite was effective in lower velocities. In conclusion, although kite based turbines are currently experimental, the results from this experiment can help properly assign the turbines to areas based on the water current’s velocity. Similarly, the Venturi Apparatus, a novel technology designed by the researcher, can be implemented efficiently.

A NOVEL META-ANALYSIS OF DATA USING SEXUAL CANNIBALISM AS A MECHANISM FOR TYRANNOSAURUS REX REPRODUCTION
Nicholas Maximiliano Vergara
Cedarcrest High School, Duvall, WA

There has been much debate over the role and lifestyle of Tyrannosaurus rex over the past decades. Problems ranging from running speed to scavenging have tormented the paleontological world for years. Now, a new behavior has seemingly emerged from a novel meta-analysis of the data compiled concerning tyrannosaurs, avians, and reptile; that Tyrannosaurus rex, as frightening and aberrant as it seems, may have participated in several forms of intraspecific sexual cannibalism. Through a thorough and comprehensive review of tyrannosaur populations, sexual dimorphism, theropod dentition, hormonal secretions in avians and reptiles, tyrannosaur pathologies, and phylogenetic deduction and bracketing, one can fully see a new startling aspect of the tyrant lizard king.

GAP IN THE DEEP SEA?: RECONSTRUCTION OF SEDIMENTARY ENVIRONMENT OF THE KUROTAKI UNCONFORMITY, CENTRAL JAPAN BASED ON FORAMINIFERS
Riou Tanaka
Chiba High School, Chiba, Chiba, JAPAN

Kurotaki Unconformity is a major sedimentary gap between a deep-water sequence distributed in central Japan, and is correlated approximately to the boundary between the Tertiary and the Quaternary. It has not been clarified under what environment the unconformity was formed. Especially it is a major problem how the unconformity that is usually formed on land exists in deep-sea sequence. The purpose of this study is to reconstruct the paleoenvironment of the Kurotaki Unconformity based on the benthic foraminifers that are tiny fossils abundantly contained in the Anno Formation which underlies the unconformity.<br><br> I collected 14 sediment samples from different horizons, each consisting approximately of 0.5 kg.Under the binocular, 2275 foraminifer specimens were picked up, and these were identified and the sedimentary environments of these species were reconstructed based on the comparative study on the modern species. <br><br> From the most part of the Anno Formation, deep sea benthic foraminifers from thelower to middle bathyal Zone (=800~2500m depth) were abundant. Just below the Kurotaki Unconformity, shallow sea species that characterizeinner sublittoral Zone (=above 50m depth) occurred but deep sea indicators of the upper middle bathyal Zone (=400~1000m depth) were more abundant.<br><br> The upper part of the Anno Formation became shallower than the main part. However,the upper part of the Anno Formation was always deposited under sea. Around the study area, sedimentary environment was not shallow as land at the time just before the Kurotaki Unconformity was formed, suggesting that the unconformity might be formed under sea.

TRACKING QUATERNARY SEALEVEL WITH CORALS AND MOLLUSCS: COSMIC DOSE RATE MODELING AND ESR DATING ON SAN SALVADOR, BAHAMAS
Aislinn Deely
Francis Lewis High School, Fresh Meadows, NY

Sealevel curves are best developed with samples from stable tectonic plates, but such curves require accurate dates and elevations to constrain the sealevel heights. On San Salvador, a tectonically stable platform, dunes with terrestrial molluscs (Cerion) preserve transgressive and regressive phases associated with late Quaternary high seastands. Reefs with corals and marine bivalves grew during the highstands, while the lowstands saw no deposition. From 11 locations, 13 corals and 17 molluscs were dated by electron spin resonance (ESR). Volumetrically−averaged dose rates were calculated from sedimentary radioisotopic geochemistry. Time−averaged cosmic dose rates were calculated from each sample's current and past geologic contexts. For samples where past depths or sediment cover thicknesses were uncertain, modeling showed that the uncertainty in cosmic dose rate calculations did not introduce significant errors to the ages. San Salvador seems to preserve deposits from three, and maybe, up to six, high seastands: By 6−8 ka in Oxygen Isotope Stage (OIS) 1, sealevel had reached modern levels. In OIS 5a (76−85 ka), OIS 5c (104 ka), and OIS 5e (110−140 ka), the San Salvador curve shows highstands at or above modern levels. During both OIS 7.1 (190 ka) and OIS 7.5(223 ka), the San Salvador curve shows that sealevels had reached the platform. More ages from several units, including the rubble zone, would ensure a better understanding about the duration of the highstands.

SEDIMENTOLOGICAL ANALYSIS AND DETERMINATION OF HEAVY METALS: HOWARD BEACH, NYC
Savera Dhanraj
High School for Health Professions and Human Services, New York, NY

Howard Beach is a semi-estuary beach on the northern shore of Jamaica Bay. This beach serves as a community place where families and locals perform multiple activities which includes fishing, surfing, and swimming. However, this area has undergone dramatic changes in the past 80 years. In the early 1900s, the Jamaica Bay area was utilized as a dump site for urbanization and development. Possible contamination of heavy metals leachate from landfills and input from released secondary sewage treatments are current research risks in this Bay. Therefore, addressing the sedimentation and heavy metals of Howard Beach is a contribution that educates the locals and expands our knowledge on this highly active part of our city. <br><br> This research focuses on establishing viable data regarding heavy metals loading and surface geological properties of Howard Beach. Measuring the levels of soil elemental composition by a hand held X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) device is a critical objective of this research. The results of this procedure was correlated to the analytical data such as sedimentological characteristics to establish a bigger frame of understanding the functionality of heavy metals and their interactions with the physical surface of the Bay. Current data reveals the low presence of heavy metals such as Lead (Pb), Nickel (Ni), Chromium (Cr), and Cobalt (Co). However, a relatively high concentration of Titanium (Ti) was observed in quantities ranging 263-2143 PPM (mg/kg). The surface geology of this area comprises of mostly medium to fine sediments. Such properties allow the possibilities of heavy metals input where the soil has the capability of attracting heavy metals leachate from landfills and/or released sewage water.

PRELIMINARY GEOLOGIC STUDY OF THE YOGO DIKE TREND TO DETERMINE POTENTIAL FOR NEW DISCOVERIES OF SAPPHIRE BEARING DIKE
Katelyn Elizabeth Gibbs
Great Falls High School, Great Falls, MT

Yogo sapphhires are considered to be one of the world's most precious gemstones. Their flawless appearance and unique "corn flower blue" coloration are characteristics that make these particular sapphires so rare. Only found in Montana, Yogo sapphires are exclusive to the five mile long Yogo dike located in the Little Belt Mountains of Montana. My project goal was to find the existence of unexplored extensions of the Yogo dike. I selected a study area situated in Yogo Gulch near the American Mine and the Vortex Mine. Using a porton precession magnetometer I found evidence for three distinct but related magnetic anomalies that I believe represent unexposed sapphire-bearing dike deposits. Using lineation diagrams, in conjunction with aerial imagery I was able to identify the trend the Yogo dike follows through the eastern margin of the Little Belt Mountains as well as possible Yogo dike extensions. The use of aerial photography revealed large geologic features, one being a large circular topographic anomaly positioned exactly on the trace of the dike trend. Although it is possible that this collapse feature impacted the emplacement of the dike it has not been previously discussed in literature dealing with Yogo dike geology. Reasonable assumptions indicated that the results from this project provide sufficient information to guide an exploration dirll program designed to test the economic potential of the magnetic anomalies outlined by this study; doing so could lead to the discovery of new reserves of yogo sapphire bearing dike.

ASSESSMENT OF THE SAFETY OF ROAD CUTS ALONG DIAMOND DRIVE, LOS ALAMOS, NEW MEXICO
Julia Grace Murphy
Los Alamos High School, Los Alamos, NM

This experiment was designed to determine the safety of a road cut on the 2200 block of Diamond Drive, Los Alamos County, New Mexico. Pictures and samples were taken at the location to aid in estimating the mass, density, angle and coefficient of friction of a specific boulder and by estimating the force required to cause the boulder to fall. The mass of the boulder was estimated by calculating the volume and width of the boulder from pictures; the results were then put to scale. Density was determined by weighing a dry sample and weighing the same sample when submerged in water. The difference between these weights equals the volume of water displaced and, therefore, the density of the sample. Experiments were set up to determine the coefficient of friction of the material that makes up the boulder. Samples were set on top of another sample used as a base and attached to a string that ran over a fulcrum. Weight was added until the samples overcame static friction. The angle of the boulder was measured at the site and calculated to be 32.7°± 4.0° with the uncertainties. The force needed was calculated using DFt=mg(mcosq-sinq) and was found to be 2000 kg ± 1600 kg. The data does not provide definite conclusions about the state of the boulder due to uncertainties. Precautions to safety include securing the boulder in place or removing the boulder from the road cut.

USING AMINO ACID ANALYSIS TO DISTINGUISH CHONDRITIC METEORITES FROM ROCKS LAUNCHED INTO SPACE FROM EARTH
Jane M. Cox
Timpview High School, Provo, UT

Amino acids, the building blocks of life, can be produced by both biotic and abiotic processes. I used amino acid profiles to see if I could distinguish carbonaceous chondrites from terrestrial rocks containing cyanobacteria and fossilized stromatolites. I calculated that impacts of large asteroids with earth can generate sufficient momentum to launch such earth rocks into space, with some perhaps settling on Mars. The discovery of a terrestrial rock containing cyanobacteria from earth could lead to false claims of extraterrestrial life on Mars. Taking efforts to protect against contamination, and using sandstone and HCl blanks as controls, I used a Hitachi amino acid analyzer to determine amino acid profiles for the Murchison and Kilabo meteorites and compared them to a rock with endolithic cyanobacteria collected from the Utah desert and a Wyoming stromatolite.<br><br> While both the Kilabo and Murchison Meteorite contained trace amounts of amino acids, the amino acids present weren’t very complex, and have been known to occur through abiotic processes. The rock containing cyanobacteria, as would be expected, contained 19 different amino acids. The stromatolite contained 7 different amino acids The control HCL blank contained no amino acids, showing that the machine wasn’t contaminated, and the sandstone control contained only trace amounts of glycine, strongly suggesting there was no contamination. The fact that the meteorites had such different amino acid profiles from the cyanobacteria containing rock shows that yes, amino acid profiles can be used to distinguish between extraterrestrial and terrestrial rocks.

USING PALEOTEMPERATURE TO SEARCH FOR THE EFFECTS OF EL NIÑO SOUTHERN OSCILLATION IN THE RED SEA BASED ON A TEMPERATURE MODEL DERIVED FROM THE SR/CA RATIO IN CORAL
Ryan Shockey Davis
Falmouth Academy, Falmouth, MA

The purpose of this experiment was to search for signs of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the Red Sea based on a sea surface temperature (SST) record derived from the Sr/Ca ratio of coral skeleton. ENSO is a weather anomaly originating in the Pacific that occurs every three to seven years with weather effects on a global scale. <br><br> To develop this record, slabs of coral were previously drilled at 0.5 millimeter intervals, and the dust of each drilling was placed in a vial. Each sample was acidified with 2ml of 5% nitric acid. This was run through an ICP-OES (inductively coupled plasma, optical emission spectroscopy) machine. The resulting Sr/Ca ratio was converted to SST through comparisons to satellite SST records of the past 30 years. A previously developed equation was applied to the Sr/Ca record to convert it to SST. This record was then corrected using both matrix and drift standards. Then the annual seasonal cycle was removed from the record, creating an anomaly chart which was then compared to a preexisting SST anomaly chart of an area that detailed ENSO events occurring in the Pacific. <br><br> When sampled at monthly, 1 year, 5 year, and 10 year intervals, there was no significant correlation between ENSO and Red Sea SST, as in each case the R² value was less that 2%. <br><br> This means that less than 2% of the data could be explained by a correlation between ENSO and SST, making it insignificant. Knowing when and how ENSO affects an area is essential to predicting its climate.

WASHINGTON, DC SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WIND EVENTS: AN ANALYSIS OF CORRELATED THERMODYNAMIC CONVECTIVE PARAMETERS AND DOPPLER RADAR SIGNATURES
Christopher Aaron Manning Gerlach
T. C. Williams High School, Alexandria, VA

While severe downbursts in the US Central Plains (Pryor, 2006) and Deep South (Wakimoto, et al., 1991) have been documented in the literature, there have been no comprehensive studies of downbursts in the Mid-Atlantic nor of the mean time-correlation of a broad sample of radar signatures with downbursts nationwide. Yet, convective winds have caused 53 casualties in Washington, DC alone over the past fifteen years (Storm Data). Thus, the object of this study is to determine what thermodynamic parameters-including a novel formulation of the Theta-E parameter-and radar signatures are most correlated with convective winds.<br><br>An EF1 downburst on August 5, 2010 was chosen for in-depth analysis using GR2Analyst radar software. Radar data from the National Climatic Data Center was ordered. The data was then examined objectively and subjectively via GR2Analyst and GRLevel3 to identify the structure, forcing mechanisms and radar signatures associated with the downburst. The case study revealed a gust front, BWER, quickly rising and collapsing core, 1.5kft radial velocities in excess of 80kts, front-to-rear/rear-to-front flow; and a spearhead echo observed both on radar and visually. <br><br>Thus, the case was a pulse microburst forced by precipitation loading, buoyancy, and vertical transfer of momentum, but exhibiting organized storm-scale bow echo velocity features. The case is the first in a broader of Washington severe wind events considering both thermodynamic parameters and radar signatures associated with downbursts. This research will serve as empirical guidance for rapid, objective storm interrogation, and ultimately protect the lives of those threatened by severe convective winds.

NONLINEAR PARAMETRIC MODELING OF HURRICANE LANDFALL DECAY
Taide Ding
Oxford High School, Oxford, MS

Previous hurricane simulations using a model constructed from a linear differential equation of the form dy/dx = -a(Vmax - Vb) (author, 2010) showed that a linear decay curve that simply took into account a storm's thermodynamic energy loss after landfall was consistently unable to accurately model the sharp drop in maximum surface wind velocity (Vmax) observed in numerous storms. This suggested that more physical factors consistently influence hurricane decay. Furthermore, the model could not optimally simulate both Vmax and Pc (central barometric pressure) with one set of parameter values. <br><br> The present year’s study introduces a non-linear term to the differential equation, giving a form of dy/dx = -a(Vmax - Vb) – c(Vmax - Vb)2 where c is a function of friction between the planetary boundary layer and the rough terrestrial surface. The study also revises the empirical parameter B from a constant to a function of pressure to improve Vmax/Pc correlation. A statistical database of optimum parameter values calibrated against observed data is created for various historical hurricanes that made landfall in the Gulf of Mexico. Correlations between landfall conditions and optimal parameter values are found; using the best-fit curves to determine initial parameter values enables accurate forecasts even when given only two observed data points: landfall Vmax and Pc. <br><br> This novel non-linear approach to simulating and forecasting landfall decay proves much more effective than the original linear model by taking into account additional physical factors involved in hurricane decay. In addition, varying parameter B as a linear function improves Vmax/Pc correlation and increases flexibility. This model can be applied as a simple warning system for coastal and inland populations.

This method not only creates storage for excess CO2, but additionally generates energy as carbon dioxide is cycled through a geothermal system.<br><br> A flaw in this new technology is evident: if carbonate precipitates build up, the system could become clogged, no longer functioning. The purpose of this experiment is to attempt to halt the geosequestric process through the addition of sodium bisulfite. It was predicted that when sodium bisulfite is present, then the compound will create a layer of precipitate pyrite on the surface of the basalt grains that would prevent geosequestration. The pyrite’s presence would be determined through changes in mass, pH value, and elemental content, in addition to observations using a stereoscope and scanning electron microscope. <br><br> Nine containers were filled with basalt and carbonated water. Sodium bisulfite was then mixed into six samples. These were placed in an oven for two, four, or six weeks.<br><br> At this time, the effects of sodium bisulfite on the sequestration process of carbon dioxide in basalt cannot be fully concluded. However, the available data does show sodium bisulfite affecting pH -- the surrounding solution becomes more acidic. This shows evidence of precipitate formation. The basalt mass remains generally unchanged. Spikes in iron and sulfur content of a sample indicate the formation of pyrite. However, until all data has arrived, this study is not yet complete.

THE EFFECTS OF OCEAN TEMPERATURE ON AEROSOL PARTICLE ABSORPTION
Kyra Hollister Grantz
York School, Monterey, CA

Aerosols are defined as liquid or solid colloidal systems suspended in the atmosphere. They are crucial in establishing a radiative balance in the atmosphere, largely through their role as cloud condensation nuclei. This project seeks to study the effect that rising ocean temperatures may have on aerosol particle absorption and contends that higher temperatures will lead to an increased rate of particle absorption.<br><br>To study this effect, a chamber was built in which aerosol particle concentration was measured as a function of time. The pressure in the chamber was slowly increased and then rapidly decreased to form a “cloud” in the chamber, off of which light from a projector would scatter onto a solar cell. Since the optical density of a cloud is directly proportional to the concentration of aerosol particles and more dense clouds will scatter more light, voltage readings are directly proportional to particle concentration. Water in the chamber was kept at a constant temperature (either 13, 15, 17 or 19 degrees Celsius) throughout each 5 hour run.<br><br>It was found that, as water temperature increases, particles were absorbed at a quicker rate, which could result in a decreased aerosol concentration in the lower levels of the troposphere, leading to higher surface temperatures, poorer water quality, more light at the surface of the earth and increased flooding and drought. This project was a generalization of the atmosphere and ocean and therefore some error was inherent, particularly in cloud formation. Further research could involve studying the effects on the size of particle absorbed.

CHLOROPHYLL-A VARIABILITY IN AN ESTUARY IN RESPONSE TO TROPICAL CYCLONES
Andrea Carolina Monzon, Adriana Cristina Sarró, 
Academia del Perpetuo Socorro, San Juan, PUERTO RICO

This is the first attempt to study the long-term Chlorophyll-a variability in La Parguera Bay, Puerto Rico, in response to tropical cyclone events that have directly or indirectly affected this estuary with strong winds, heavy rains or high seas. An analysis of four Atlantic hurricane seasons (2007-2010) indicate that tropical cyclones and, even disturbances that became or were tropical cyclones, that move within 450 miles of the estuarine system, may alter chlorophyll-a concentrations of an estuary. From 2007-2010, there were 17 tropical cyclones and disturbances near the estuary, but no tropical cyclones made direct landfall across this area. The strongest impacts on the estuary were from Hurricane Dean (2007), tropical disturbance Pre-Kyle (2008) and tropical storm Otto (2010). Hurricane Dean, a Category 4 passing around 190 miles from the estuary, resulted in a strong wave/swell event that enhanced phytoplankton biomass, and produced an aggressive development of Thrichosolen duchassaingii and widespread areas of seagrasses and algae. Tropical disturbance Pre-Kyle produced extensive flooding and an unprecedented proliferation of Cochlodinium polykrikoides, a recognized cause of harmful algal blooms (HABs). Otto's persistent rainbands during its cyclonic development, combined to an above-normal 2010 precipitation pattern, resulted in elevated chlorophyll-a measurements. Each tropical phenomenon varied in characteristics, and consequently, the variations with chlorophyll-a concentrations in the estuary were assessed and correlated. Remote sensing imagery such as MODIS helped in the assessment of chlorophyll-a spatial patterns in the coastal and oceanic waters during episodic events of the hurricane season that could have an impact on phytoplankton communities.

IS GLOBAL WARMING REAL?: AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS ON REGIONAL DETAILS
Chih-yu Lee, Chen,Sze-Ying, 
National Hsin Tien Senior High School, New Taipei City, CHINESE TAIPEI

Through the discussion in the earth science course, we are getting more interested in the environmental change issues that brought up by our teacher. Although the textbook and news report often described the recent decade are warmest for the globe since the industrial revolution, we would like to explore further on how the earth surface air temperature increased in the past and whether regional differences existed. By collecting the weather station data from various countries through their websites, we analyzed the details of trends found in the past station records. Interestingly, we found that the warming trends were not uniform everywhere. The temperature increases tend to be larger for the stations located in higher latitudes. There are also stations that shown cooling trends for the past decades. We also found that in recent years the warming trends in winter were in general more intense than those in summer. There were also interesting variation in the rate of temperature increases when we shorten the data analysis period from full length (about 70 years) to more recent decades. We are surprised to learn all the deviations from the global mean warming trends when specific spatial distribution and temporal scale are considered. The feedback processes from earth climate system, natural climate variability, and more local anthropogenic forcing from aerosol could be the clues to answer the patterns we found when we go through the climate change research literature.

This is an innovative methodology that allows an in-depth study of the aspects inherent karst hydrology, even under conditions which are not suitable for the use of advanced instruments. <br><br>The purpose of this study is to define peculiarities of a specific karst system (the two-cave Vigant – Pre Oreak system) from different sides, using the guidelines provided by the method.<br><br>Two control units were placed inside the Pre Oreak Cave, near the perpetually submerged siphon that connects it with the Vigant Abyss, and then set up to hourly scanning. One unit records the piezometric water level in the cave, while the other recorded the air temperature. At the same time the hourly values of precipitations and outside temperature of the area were received from the regional organization OSMER FVG.<br><br>Thanks to the comparison of the data obtained, research was developed on four fields:<br><br>(1) definition of the relation between the variables that intervene in the water dynamics of the system: precipitations and floods inside the cave (graphical and mathematical relation), role of temperature;<br><br>(2) determination of specific characteristics (basin area, flow rate);<br><br>(3) paleo-hydrological mapping and forecasting of possible future developments;<br><br>(4) applications found in both hypogean and epigean situations, particularly in civil and agricultural ranges.<br><br>Therefore a series of tested guidelines has been defined: these will allow people, also who are not experts in the sector, to work in various conditions and research environments and will offer several applications, not only in the geological sector.

CHARACTERIZATION OF VOLCANIC LIGHTNING AND MODELING HOW VOLCANIC LIGHTNING OCCURS AT SAKURAJIMA VOLCANO IN KAGOSHIMA, JAPAN

Kagoshima Prefectural Kinkowan Senior High School, Kagoshima, Kagoshima, JAPAN

** Introduction and Purpose<br><br> Sakurajima volcano is located in south Kyushu, Japan. A series of explosive eruptions have been occurring at its summit crater from 1955. In June 2006, the Showa crater, on east flank of the summit crater resumed eruptive activity after its 58-year dormancy, and the number of explosive eruptions recorded in 2010 was 896. Volcanic lightning accompanied most of the eruptions. The purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of volcanic lightning, and to model how it occurs.<br><br>** Method and Results<br><br> By using video footage observation of our data and other data, we recorded the number, height, length, time and form of the lightning occurrences. Video footage allowed us to observe the ejection patterns of volcanic products, and to classify these into two types: fountain-type and column-type. Volcanic lightning occurred early in the fountain-type ejections. This was not the case for the column-type which was slower to occur. Fountain-type ejections scattering high-temperature volcanic products around the crater made short volcanic lightning at around the crater, while column-type ejections that spouted out high-temperature volcanic products high into the air made relatively long volcanic lightning.<br><br>** Conclusions<br><br> It is considered that its static electricity is generated within the ejections of high-temperature volcanic products. The electric charge is stored in the spreading volcanic smoke in the sky, causing large volcanic lightning to occur. Volcanic lightning is a standard phenomenon involved in eruptions, caused by the ionization phenomena in the volcanic cloud.

OPAK RIVER MOUTH: A UNIQUE DEFLECTION
Yan Restu Freski, Darmadi, 
1st State Yogyakarta High School, Yogyakarta, Yogyakarta, INDONESIA

This research idea arises when facing the fact showed by the map. Many rivers in Bantul until Cilacap Regency, Java, Indonesia, have the trend to deflect to the west before come in to the ocean. One of them is Opak River in Bantul, Special Region of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. This research aimed to know the factor affecting the deflection of Opak River before it ends in Hindian Ocean and to know the process of deflection of Opak River on its condition.<br><br>Methods used in this research were observation, library research, and documentation. The samples were put in the research field tested in granulometric analysis. It was supporterd with stereo-microscopic analysis. Observation was focused on sedimentation process. To analyze the data, analytic descriptive was used, that is interpreting the data qualitatively.<br><br>The result of the research explained that there were many factors that affect the deflection such as wind, wave, long-shore drift, sedimentation from the river, lithology (rock formation), neo-tectonic setting, and geomorphology. Wind creates the wave that will break and crash the beach. It causes swash and back-swash shaping long-shore drift to the west. The sediment in this natural process moves to the western beach blocking the stream. The rock formation supports the process by its resistance. The formation of rock both in the East Java and West Java do not support the deflection of rivers in its surrounding. There was a fact about the subduction zone lies along the Java Island and its southern beach. The latter always be uplifted as it belongs to the Eurasia plate. It constructs the geomorphology of the beach in the mouth of Opak River.

GLOBAL WARMING: A BOOSTER OF HURRICANE?

Gyeonggi Science High School, Gyeonggi-do, Gyeonggi-do, SOUTH KOREA

Hurricanes influence human in various ways. Nowadays, as Global Warming is getting worse, people are paying more attention to hurricane, whether its frequency and intensity increase or not. It is proved among scientists that Global Warming increases its intensity while decreasing its frequency.<br><br> We developed a hurricane in a laboratory, considering meteorological factors of actual hurricanes. Using air current, which forms equilibrium from Pressure Gradient Force(PGF) and Coriolis Force, birth, growth, and extinction of hurricanes were illustrated. PGF was realized through Fan - used in cooling CPU- and Coriolis Force through spinning disk. Temperature gradient significantly affects birth of hurricane and latent heat dominantly affects growth of hurricane.<br><br> Utilizing the hurricane model we developed, the impact of hurricanes on human life was predicted, as the Global Warming becomes serious. Unlike recent studies of hurricanes becoming stronger, hurricanes would break down and become extinct at low-latitudes of the Earth according to our research. Consequently, the life span of hurricanes would become shorter, since they would extinct before coming to the mid-latitudes with the same birthrate. Like shown on the movie 'The day after Tomorrow', it would bring the break the energy balance around the Earth due to Global Warming, bringing enormous meteorological change throughout the world.

EVAPORATION VS. EVAPOTRANSPORATION
Breanne Williams
South Sumter High School, Bushnell, FL

The purpose of this project is to determine if the evaporation rate of mine drilled lakes is greater than the evapotransporation rate of the native plant life of the region. It is hypothesized that mine drilled lakes would lose more water through evaporation than the plant life would lose through evapotransporation. <br><br>Procedure is to set up a Class A evaporation pan, an evapotransporation device, a wind gauge, rain gauge, and a floating thermometer. Record readings three times a week for three months. Plug the data into the alpha equation. Next, plug your alpha and data into three corresponding formulas to calculate Lake Evaporation. Determine the ratio of Lake Evaporation to Pan evaporation. Calculate the difference between Lake Evaporation and the Evapotransporation rate. <br><br>The results of this project were that the difference between lake evaporation and pan evaporation were positve decimals between .01 and 1.0. This means that the hypothesis was supported because the lakes lost more water than the plant life that was there before.

MOLECULAR HYDROGEN AND FAR-ULTRAVIOLET EXTINCTION DUE TO DUST
Marianne Virginia Konikoff
Saint Joseph's Academy, Baton Rouge, LA

The purpose for studying the correlations between molecular hydrogen levels, dust and extinction characteristics, and reddening levels is to investigate any possible relationships in the data and determine if molecular hydrogen forms on dust grains. The hypothesis states that hydrogen levels will be positively correlated with levels of interstellar reddening, ultraviolet extinction, and cosmic dust, supporting the idea that molecular hydrogen forms on dust particles. The Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) and International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) satellites collected data regarding these levels, and I correlated the data in error plots using Interactive Data Language (IDL) software. This involved writing commands for the IDL program to use to make plots and run statistics. The plots all indicated a positive relationship between the data. Levels of hydrogen were positively related to levels of reddening, extinction, and dust. Linear regressions indicate the significance of these relationships. The results led me to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that molecular hydrogen forms on cosmic dust particles. The clouds containing these particles provide the optimum environment in which these diatomic molecules can form, including temperature, protection from interfering particles, and bonding energy, providing an explanation for this phenomenon. I also created a virtual model of the area of the Milky Way galaxy from which the data was collected using IDL. This involved writing a computer script that formulated a three-dimensional plot showing star coordinates along with the positions of earth and other important objects.

USING RESONANCE FREQUENCY TO PREDICT AND PREVENT STRUCTURAL FAILURE
Rohan Thakur
Plano East Senior High School, Plano, TX

Engineering is geared towards the benefit of people, and there is no greater benefit than saving lives. Earthquakes ruin cities everyday, but human lives and history can never be replaced.<br><br>Earthquakes are most dangerous at the resonance frequency of a structure. When an earthquake strikes a building at the resonance frequency, the waves constructively interfere, creating standing waves. The amplitude of the wave increases exponentially; meaning even a small earthquake can be devastating.<br><br>This experiment uses resonance frequency to create an effective and feasible dampening system. The position of a tuned mass damper was manipulated and an entirely novel dampening system, the twin structure, was invented.<br><br>The structure was built using PVC pipes. An accelerometer was attached to the top of the structure. The base of the structure was struck and using the accelerometer the resonance frequency of each structure was found. A motor at this frequency then simulated the earthquake.<br><br>The results from this experiment showed that the tuned mass damper improved when positioned higher in the structure. The twin structure, with identical resonance frequencies, failed while a structure with two different resonance frequencies made resonance failure virtually impossible. This method of eliminating the danger of a standing wave is entirely novel and proves to be extremely effective.<br><br>Adapting the concept of the tuned mass damper, a novel dampening system, using fluid, was invented. This brings cost effective structural stability to developing nations and historical structures, areas where it is needed most.

CHARACTERIZATION, DETECTION, AND TOXICITY OF THE OIL DISPERSANT COREXIT 9500
Mariah Sturdivant Coughlin
Fort Myers High School, Fort Myers, FL

This study is investigated the detection of the chemical dispersant, Corexit 9500, and characterized Corexit, the water-accommodated fractions of oil (WAF) and the chemically-enhanced, water-accommodated fractions (CEWAF, Corexit+oil). In addition, toxicity experiments of Corexit, WAF, and CEWAF on the bacteria Nitrosomanos cryotolerans and the archaea Nitrosopumilis maritimis were also conducted.<br><br> The surfactants composing Corexit are designed to have a chemical affinity for both water and oil that allows for the formulation of smaller droplets that disperse in small concentrations. The inherent problem with this chemical is that research into the toxicity and detection of it is limited. Corexit, WAF and CEWAF solutions were prepared in artificial seawater and characterized using UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. Different concentrations of Corexit were also measured using UV/Vis to determine the detection limit using this method.<br><br> From UV/Vis and fluorescence spectra, it can be determined that Corexit is not easily identifiable from oil using these methods. The fluorescence scans show that the weathered and slick oil are highly interactive with Corexit, with the Corexit changing the character of the oil. However, the crude oil does not react or is changed when Corexit 9500 is introduced. WAF and CEWAF solutions below 10µg/mL have very little effect on the growth and nitrite production of N. cryotolerans, while WAF and CEWAF solutions greater than 100ng/mL inhibits N. maritimis. Corexit solutions at 10µg/mL is completely inhibits N. cryotolerans, while solutions higher than 100ng/mL inhibits N. maritimis activity. Results from this study suggest that Corexit is more toxic than oil.

ANALYSIS OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE SWIRL RATIO AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE STRUCTURE OF A TORNADIC VORTEX
Casey Richard Densmore
Musselman High School, Inwood, WV

This investigation used an original tornado simulator developed to examine the components that affect the swirl ratio and vortex structure. The purpose of this experiment was to determine the changes that occur with the funnel structure as the swirl ratio is altered by changing the inflow angle, updraft radius, or confluence region height. The hypothesis tested was that if a change in the components of the swirl ratio occurs, then the structure of the funnel would change. The tornado simulator used in this experiment was a unique design that consisted of an enclosed, wooden box with rotatable PVC pipes in each corner to adjust inflow angle from a positive pressure source, a 12.7 cm diameter updraft fan that could be lifted to place disks adjusting the updraft diameter below the fan, and two plexiglass windows. To alter the height of the confluence region, the funnel was initiated below the box, and the confluence region was represented by the area between the base of the vortex and the base of the box, which was used as the confluence shelf. The variables tested included diameter of the updraft (12.7 cm, 7.6 cm, and 2.5 cm), angle of the inflow using positive pressure (0°, 45°, 90°, and 180°), and height of the confluence region (0 cm, 2 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm, and 8 cm). Based on the experiment, the hypothesis is correct. The components of the swirl ratio (confluence height, inflow angle, and updraft diameter) affected the structure of the tornadic vortices produced in this experiment. Adjusting the updraft diameter proved that as the diameter of the updraft increases, the funnel strengthens. The inflow angle did not impact the swirl ratio predictably. Vortex structure fluctuated up and down as the inflow angle was increased, which does not correspond with the swirl ratio formula, and is most likely due to a flaw in the design of the tornado simulator. The confluence tests in the experiment prove that as the confluence height is increased from 0 cm to 6 cm, the structure of the funnel strengthens (with a 61 cm convection region). At a confluence height of 8 cm the vortex/vorticies began to destabilize. Overall, the tornado simulator used in this experiment successfully demonstrated the importance of the swirl ratio to the structure of a tornadic vortex.

HOW WELL IS YOUR WELL? THE EFFECTS OF HYDRAFRACKING FLUIDS ON A EUKARYOTIC SPECIES
Sydney Clarke Matteson
William J. Palmer High School, Colorado Springs, CO

My project started after reading an article describing contaminated domestic well water near the Pavilion, WY gas field. The E.P.A. suspected the contamination was related to Hydraulic Fracturing, an effective way of improving recovery of gas from impermeable rocks. Methane and chemicals used as additives in the water-based "fracking" fluids were present.<br><br>I was concerned that these chemicals might be a significant hazard to the aquatic envirnoment, people and livestock. I decided to expose Daphnia pulex, a small "water flea: at the lower end of the food chain, to 5 serial dilutions of 7 commonly used "fracking" additives (naphtha, hydrochloric acid, terpene, methanol, ethanol, propanol and formaldehyde).Concentrations of 1/10K (close to what is pumped down a gas well), 1/100K, 1/1M, 1/10m and 1/100M for each of the 7 additives (the independent variables) were put in petri dishes with 5 daphnia apiece. Daphnia in distilled water were used as the Control. Lifespan and heart rate ( the dependent variables) were noted daily in each of the 36 petri dishes (3 trials). <br><br>My results confirmed that the 7 additives are lethal at the concentrations (1/10K) pumped into the ground and less so in the weaker dilutions. Terpene showed the most direct correlation between concentration and toxicity; ethanol seemed to be the least harmful.<br><br>I conclude that one cause of fracking chemical contamination could be from a spill at the surface or leakage from waste fluid storage. The other means of harmful contamination would be a direct path from the "fracked" zone up the outside of the casing toward the surface, past bad casing cement, which explains the deep-sourced methane found by the E.P.A. in domestic wells. <br><br>Baby Daphnia appeared right after the adults died and may be tolerant.

OZONE MONITORING
Mark David Hammond
The Royal Grammar School, Guildford, Surrey, UNITED KINGDOM

The project involved the design and construction of a four-channel UV radiometer based on the OMAD instrument flown on FASat-Bravo with the aim of testing its ability to accurately measure overhead column ozone. The newer instrument used a more suited silicon carbide photodiode to measure light intensity, which has a large spectral response in the UV region and a much lower response to all other wavelengths of light.<br><br>The instrument was used to measure the intensities of four 10nm bands of UV, from which total overhead ozone was calculated with the equation used in Dobson spectrophotometers. A fifth band related to reflectivity and cloud cover was also measured as this would be an important factor in measurement from a satellite. . <br><br>The Dobson method gave reasonably similar results to existing satellites and it was concluded that the newer instrument could perform at least as well as the older OMAD device with much simpler filtering. The instrument also functioned on low power and was relatively low cost, making it more suitable for low-term projects such as ozone monitoring. <br><br>The mapping of global ozone using data from NASA was also investigated, and these maps were imported into Google Earth to give a 3D picture of how ozone levels change over time.

HURRICANE SIGNATURES WITHIN TREE RING RECORDS, FIRE ISLAND, NEW YORK
Nickolas Boroda
Massapequa High School, Massapequa, NY

Dendroclimatology can be used to understand the meteorological history of a dynamic barrier island ecosystem, such as Sunken Forest, a rare maritime holly forest. Since 1850, Sunken Forest has historically been hit by hurricanes, which damage the barrier island and disturb the equilibrium of the forest ecosystem. Previous research, by Jodi A. Forrester, concerning the relative abundance of vegetation in Sunken Forest demonstrated the ecosystem’s response to any weather-related disturbance. Ilex opaca ring width series were measured and observed to correlate signals from hurricanes with tree growth. It was hypothesized that the historical weather data from Sunken Forest would have a strong correlation with the thickness of rings in the holly trees. The data was detrended to isolate signals of high-frequency variation caused by hurricanes. An a priori negative exponential trend caused by geometrical constraint was removed to control for age-dependent variation using a minimum of fifteen samples. Broad climactic signals were stochastically calculated with a cubic smoothing spline, then removed. Years in which hurricanes occurred had a smaller average ring, and the low-frequency growth trends had a lower average derivative at points associated with hurricanes. Therefore, hurricanes are correlated with negative signals in the tree ring data.

MORPHOLOGICAL DISPARITY DURING THE AMMONOID RECOVERY AFTER THE PERMIAN MASS EXTINCTION
Rose Landis Leopold
Pacific Collegiate School, Santa Cruz, CA

The Permian mass extinction caused the elimination of 80% of marine genera. Ammonoids, however, survived the extinction and returned to the levels of diversity that had been seen in the Late Permian within a million years while other groups recovered at a much slower rate. Previous analyses have looked at taxonomy and environmental factors as being reasons for the rapid recovery of ammonoids, but morphological disparity may be decoupled from taxonomic diversity. I measured whorl expansion, umbilical diameter, aperture height, aperture shape and ventral acuity from illustrated specimens of 135 genera and used principal components analysis to quantify morphological diversity. Ammonoid disparity decreased after the extinction, but did not reach its lowest until the Dienerian substage, unlike taxonomic diversity which was lowest immediately after the extinction. By the Smithian, ammonoids had recovered in both morphological disparity and taxonomic diversity. This was most likely due to their ecology which allowed them to avoid the deepest waters where oxygen levels were low and due to their high metabolic rate which enabled them to better adapt to ocean acidification. The response of these ammonoids can help us to understand traits like motility that allowed ammonoids to come back successfully from the brink of extinction unlike so many benthic groups.

THERMAL CONVECTION IN A FRACTURED ROCK: EXPERIMENT, THEORY, AND REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS
Ivan Vikram Rajen
Eldorado High School, Albuquerque, NM

This project studies thermal convection in a saturated porous rock with simulated fractures. Applications include hydrothermal vents in the ocean, geothermal energy, oil and gas development, and pollution movement from buried waste. Thermal convection in the rock was studied experimentally. An electric heater was placed on the side of a porous rock into which several cracks had been cut. The rock was heated and temperatures were measured as the rock started heating up. The temperature data was plotted versus time. When the temperatures on the top and bottom of the rock begin to fluctuate from hot to cold in a steady recurring manner we can tell that convection (hot fluid rising and cold fluid descending) is taking place. In conclusion, a relationship between the rate of heating and the amount of convection was developed for this specific case. The conclusions help to estimate whether such thermal convection could have occurred in rocks near hydrothermal vents under the ocean and in other real-world situations.

A GEOCHEMICAL AND GEOMICROBIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF THE RED SEA - DEAD SEA CANAL
Adam-l Mofeed Sawan
Oakridge Secondary School, London, Ontario, CANADA

Limited rainfall and water diversion from the Dead Sea has caused it to shrink at a rate of one meter per year for the past thirty years. A number of solutions to sustain water levels have been proposed. The most favoured is the Red-Dead Sea Canal, linking the two bodies of water by either an underwater pipeline or a canal. A current World Bank study is examining the feasibility of this project, and early results indicate that the canal will greatly impact the limnology and biology of the Dead Sea. This interdisciplinary study builds on previous research and examines the impact of halophilc Archaea on Dead Sea aqueous geochemistry and mineralogy, complimenting current research. Geochemical PHREEQC computer simulations indicate that gypsum will precipitate in the post-mixed Dead Sea; this was further proven in the abiotic laboratory systems. When compared to the abiotic systems, this study also indicates that halophilic Archaea will play a decisive biogeochemical and mineralogical role in the post-mixed Dead Sea. It was discovered that different species impacted the precipitation of minerals, specifically gypsum, differently, with some inhibiting salt formation and others promoting it. Furthermore, all the Archaea formed gypsum crystals that were not macroscopically visible. As the crystals settled to the bottom of the solution, they also captured organic material. This raises the possibility of life in this new sediment, as seen in the gypsum sediment layers found in current Red Sea evaporation ponds where sediments impact the aqueous system and vice versa.

LET THERE BE NO LIGHT! ESR DATING OF THE QUARTZ FROM THE BYTHAM RIVER PALAEOCHANNEL
Edward Cho
Stuyvesant High School, New York, NY

Initial estimates placed the earliest hominin colonization in northern Europe at 300-400 ka, but the rapidly eroding Cromer Forest Beds along the East Anglian coast have yielded Lower Paleolithic flint artefacts. Hominins occupied southern England when Mediterranean climates prevailed, by exploiting a deciduous boreal forest drained by the Bytham River Palaeochannel. Two new Early Paleolithic sites in the Cromer Forest Beds were dated by paleomagnetism at > 760 ka. To test if electron spin resonance (ESR) dating could date the fluvial sediment from the Bytham, fine-grained quartz was collected from four cores drilled in a small tributary to the Bytham. For this method to work, preexisting quartz ESR signals must have been bleached during transport to the fluvial deposit. Quartz was separated from other minerals and cleaned in hydrofluorosilicic acid, which removed 12-15 μm from the grain surfaces. In bleaching tests, four signals bleached about 50% in 350 hours. While some quartz signals in the quartz grains appear not to have been sufficiently bleached during fluvial transport to eliminate the geologically derived signals, the Ti-H(2) and Ti-Li(2) peak appears to have been bleached sufficiently enough to agree, and yield Middle Pleistocene ages. The other peaks may provide data about sediment cycling during the Quaternary.

DEVELOPING A PARAMETRIC MODEL FOR HURRICANE WIND AND STORM SURGE PREDICTION IN THE GULF OF MEXICO
Taide Ding
Oxford High School, Oxford, MS

As a hurricane makes landfall,forecasters must determine when, where, and how intensely storm winds and storm surges will affect various coastal areas. To facilitate this, a novel method was developed to simulate and forecast spatio-temporal variations of winds and water levels in the event of a hurricane.<br><br>A simulation of Hurricane Gustav (2008) was performed on a 2.3 million-node computational mesh covering the Louisiana-Mississippi Gulf Coast. 2-D wind fields of Gustav were created based on Holland’s cyclonic wind model and incorporated into CCHE2D-Coast, a coast-ocean model, to compute storm surges driven by tides, river inflows, and hurricane winds over the entire storm period. To test for methods to increase simulation accuracy, the wind field model was modified to account for physical phenomena including fluctuating radius and post-landfall decay. Correlations between NOAA gauge station observations and computed winds and water levels were evaluated using various statistic criteria. <br><br>Cases incorporating the hurricane’s decay effect using the previous year’s pressure-wind decay model (author, 2011) consistently improved forecast accuracy over original non-decay cases. In addition, combining the decay model with a modified wind field that takes into account the constantly fluctuating radius and variable strength of the hurricane gave significantly higher correlations with observed data compared to results of Holland’s original model. <br><br>A comprehensive wind-calculation method for predicting hurricane conditions including storm surges quickly and accurately was created and tested. Operable on a personal computer, this model can greatly aid in forecasting, hazardous wind and flood management, coastal storm protection, and emergency planning.

A NOVEL METHOD OF RAINFALL FORECASTING THROUGH STAR LOCATIONS ON AZIMUTH GRID
Maleen Jayanath Wijeratna
Maliyadeva College, Kurunegala, North western Province, SRI LANKA

An accurate rainfall forecasting is very vital in our modern life. Researchers are continuing work on improving existing methods or to invent new methodologies to enhance the accuracy of the prediction. On the other hand in ancient times, as per the literature available people have used astro-meteorological observations for rainfall prediction and to warn about incoming floods of the Nile. Aim of this study was to find a productive method to predict rainfall through locations of several alpha and beta stars on the azimuth grid on a particular time of a day.<br><br>Locations of planetarium objects, Sun, Moon & Venus on the azimuth grid together with Betelgeuse, Bellatrix (on the Orion’s shoulder) & the brightest star Sirius (situated near Orion) have been considered (tracked by ancient Egyptians) to correlate the rainfall prediction. Stellarium software has been used for this study with FOV: 60˚ & FPS: 28.5.<br><br>Predictions of this project are represented according to rainfall categories of no rain (NR), light (LR), moderate (MR) & heavy (HR) rains. The author’s home town in Sri Lanka, Kurunegala (N 7° 30' 0.00", E 80° 21' 36.00") was initially chosen as the location for this project and latter extended for the city of Pittsburgh.<br><br>Prediction data taken by the locations of these six planetarium objects on the azimuth grid were tested using rainfall precipitation data (from the Department of Meteorology, Sri Lanka & National Oceanic and Atmospheric administration, USA) for the years from 2008 to 2011.<br><br>Using this method, prediction accuracy with a boundary level of ± one rainfall category is 88.9%. In conclusion, a rainfall forecasting at any geographical place with a significant accuracy is possible through locations of these six planetarium objects on the azimuth grid.

SINKHOLES
Chase Logan Kicker
Carlsbad High School, Carlsbad, NM

A sinkhole is a large depression in the ground surface that results from the collapse of an underground cavity. I became interested in sinkholes because of the possible sinkhole that could occur at the I&W Brine Well Site in Carlsbad. I wanted to study the factors that could affect sinkhole development. This research is important because a sinkhole at the I&W Site could be catastrophic. A church, feed store, residences, a highway, and an irrigation canal are potentially in the sinkhole area. The problem that I tested was how the lateral extent of an underground cavity affects the formation of a sinkhole on the surface. I believed that if the lateral extent of the underground cavity gets large enough, then the cavity will collapse and a sinkhole will form. To test this hypothesis, I built a large rotating box in which floors with different sized holes were placed. A stopper was dropped out of the floor immediately creating a cavity that could collapse and create a sinkhole. The box was a 1:500 scale model of the actual I&W Site. I developed a scale model material using a mixture of sand, cement, pea gravel, and motor oil to represent the rock at the I&W Site. Based on the model results, I concluded that a cavity with a lateral extent of 150 x 150 m at the I&W Site will cause a significant sinkhole at the surface.

In present work experimental material received at the Tien-Shan high-altitude scientific station of the Physical institute of Academy of sciences of Russia on installation "Horizon-T" at period since January on May 2011 is used. As a result of primary processing of this experimental material were discovered events, in which muons, been produced in extensive air showers, come on installation earlier than radiation of Vavilov-Cherenkov generated this shower. For explanation this phenomenon in the project calculations of the velocities of the motion is charged particles extra-high energies and velocities of the moving the light in air are organized . In calculation formulas of special theory of relativity are used. On base these calculation it is shown that muons, which overtake the front of the radiation of Vavilov-Cherenkov, were produced in initial part of shower.<br><br>This work is small but essential at a walk in elaboration of the new method, which will allow to define the nucleus composition of primary cosmic rays. This method counts for fundamental physics, since knowledge of the nucleus composition of primary cosmic rays will allow to understand the mechanism of the origin of extra-high energy cosmic rays. The knowledge of the heavy nucleus share in composition of the cosmic radiation also need for provision of safety of spaceship flights and flights of the warplanes on greater height.

OBSERVING SUDDEN STRATOSPHERE WARMING BY USING DATA FROM FORMOSAT-3
Hao-Chen Wang, Yun-Chu Chen, 
National Taichung Girls' Senior High School, Taichung City, Taiwan, CHINESE TAIPEI

Sudden Stratosphere Warming (SSW) was first discovered in the mid-twentieth century. Since then, scientists have used many methods to observe it. To distinguish our research from former studies, temperature retrievals from the FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC(Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate) radio occultation have been used to study SSWs’ characteristics . The FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC is a collaborative satellite project conducted by the National Space Organization in Taiwan and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research in the United States. It consists of six microsatellites launched in April 2006 that utilize the global positioning system radio-occultation limb sounding technique to provide high-precision temperature observations globally. There are between 1000-2500 global occultation profiles taken daily. The global sampling coverage and precision of this data set provide unique opportunities for study of SSW globally.<br><br>This study uses six years of temperature retrievals in the period, 4, 2006-1, 2012. Based on those data, we not only discuss the appearance and evolution of SSW occurred in the northern hemisphere, but we also investigate the characteristics of SSW such as magnitude of temperature change, period of occurrence, latitudinal/longitudinal dependence and seasonality. It is discovered that SSW usually happens in the late autumn and winter of each year, and is especially obvious in late winter. In terms of latitude, the magnitude of temperature change in high latitude area above 40 degrees north was much stronger than below. Additionally, the evolution of selected SSW events will be investigated by using the global temperature distribution retrieved from the FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC.

CHARACTERIZING THE ELEMENTS OF EARTH’S RADIATIVE BUDGET: APPLYING UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION TO CLIMATE MODELS
Madison Ann Chakoumakos, Tony Zhuang, 
Oak Ridge High School, Oak Ridge, TN

Stochastic climate modeling has become increasingly important. Uncertainty must<br><br>be quantified in stochastic models to characterize variations in climate parameterizations. One goal in climate modeling is to understand the individual and synergistic impacts of elements in Earth's radiative budget. Unfortunately, running climate models is computationally expensive. In this study, relationships between the relative minimum humidity for medium to high stable clouds (rhminh) and elements of Earth's radiative budget were studied. By implementing generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) and polynomial edge detection to characterize the probability space of a rhminh distribution, low computational cost is maintained. Running the climate model at a large number of values in the rhminh distribution is not necessary with these methods. The Community Earth System Model (CESM) was run to obtain realizations at five rhminh values. A gPC method was implemented to get a polynomial approximation of climate statistics between the five realizations in the rhminh distribution. The gPC approximation's reliability was assessed by running the CESM at two values of rhminh between the known realizations and by implementing polynomial annihilation edge detection to evaluate smoothness.

EVIDENCE FOR OXYGENIC PHOTOSYNTHESIS 2.75 BILLION YEARS AGO
Ashwarya Sharma, Virgiline Ongkingco, 
Martin Luther King High School, Riverside, CA

Oxygen went from being a trace component to a major component of the Earth’s atmosphere due to oxygenic photosynthesis. It is not clear if oxygenic photosynthesis evolved alongside the rise of oxygen in the atmosphere at 2.4 billion years ago or was evolved well before the rise of oxygen. We will determine the total organic carbon contents of sedimentary rocks dated to be 2.75- 2.7 billion years old. If oxygenic photosynthesis had evolved in the Archean (>2.5 billion years ago) then Archean sedimentary rocks should be rich in organic carbon regardless of their proximity to hydrothermal systems. We determine this from the shale collected from drill cores in the Abitibi Greenstone belt. We determine the organic carbon contents of the rock with an Eltra CS-2000 carbon- sulfur determinator. The machine is calibrated and the accuracy and precision are checked using geostandards, which were continuously monitored. The results gave us very high and variable total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations. The organic carbon varied with a concentration from 1% to 32%. There was no correlation distance between the hydrothermal center and total organic carbon concentrations. Since, there are only three microbial metabolisms, which can produce sedimentary rocks rich in organic carbon. Two of these (sulfide oxidation and methanogenesis), however, rely on substrates sourced from hydrothermal systems. The lack of correlation but the distributions of the sedimentary rocks are inconsistent with the hydrothermal systems. Therefore, our results are most consistent with the organic carbon being produced by oxygenic photosynthesis. This supports that oxygenic photosynthesis was present well before the rise of atmospheric oxygen at 2.4 billion years ago. This provides a foundation for models about the switch to a oxygenated Earth capable of supporting complex life.

A STUDY ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WAVE ENERGY AND ROUNDED BEACH COBBLES
Min Chae Jwa, Young Kyoung Bae, Young Jin Heo
Gyeongnam Science High School, Jinju, Gyeong Nam, SOUTH KOREA

Our study aims to understand the relationship between wave energy and the roundness of beach cobbles. We considered three waves which have influence on abrasion of beach cobbles; those are normal sea wave, storm surge, and tsunami. This kind of study is important to manage coastal protection.<br><br> We collected cobble samples from 11 sites of Sinsudo Island, located at the southern coast of the Korean Peninsula, and measured roundness of the samples. Highly rounded cobbles represent the stronger degree of abrasion by waves, and indicate higher wave energy influx to the beach. The cobbles are from two different sedimentary formations, but the roundness of cobbles does not have any relation to the rock composition.<br><br> To evaluate wave energy intensity we derived wave equations for normal sea wave, storm surge, and tsunami. Since Sinsudo Island is a part of an archipelago and smaller islands can act as slits for wave propagation, we applied wave diffraction model to the equations. Using our equations the total energy influx of each wave to the beach was calculated for two different sites. The result shows that the wave energy by storm surge is most high but that by normal sea wave is the lowest, indicating that occasional storm surge is more responsible for the abrasion of cobbles than normal sea wave. Though tsunami wave is also possible to abrade the beach cobbles, we should investigate more about the phenomenon because tsunami is very rare in the area.

SUBTROPICAL STUDY OF MINE DRILLED LAKES AND THEIR EFFECTS ON EVAPORATION AND EVAPOTRANSPIRATION
Breanne Mattea Williams
South Sumter High School, Bushnell, FL

The purpose of this project is to determine if the evaporation rate of mine drilled lakes in Florida is greater than the evapotranspiration rate of the native plant life. It is hypothesized that the mine drilled lakes in Florida will lose more water through evaporation than the plant life would lose through evapotranspiration. <br><br>Procedure is to set up a Class A evaporation pan, an evapotranspiration device, a wind gauge, rain gauge, and a floating thermometer in at least two different areas in the state. Record readings 2 times a week for 2 months. Plug the data into the alpha equation. Next, plug your alpha and data into three corresponding formulas to calculate Lake Evaporation. Determine the ratio of Lake Evaporation to Pan Evaporation. Calculate the difference between Lake Evaporation and the Evapotranspiration rate. <br><br>The results of this project were that the north and south regions of Florida had a difference between the plant life of positive decimals 0.01 through 0.37. Thus the hypothesis was supported because the lakes lost more water than the plant life.

A sinkhole is a large depression in the ground surface that results from the collapse of an underground cavity. I became interested in sinkholes because of the possible sinkhole that could occur at the I&W Brine Well Site in Carlsbad. I wanted to study the factors that could affect sinkhole development and propose a solution to stabilize the underground cavity and prevent sinkhole occurrence. This research is important because a sinkhole at the I&W Site could be catastrophic. A church, feed store, residences, a highway, and an irrigation canal are potentially in the sinkhole area. The problem that I tested was what type of flowable fill material could be developed to efficiently prevent the formation of a sinkhole on the surface. I believed that with the extensive use of relatively inexpensive fillers in a cement-based grout, a workable material could be developed. To test this hypothesis, I mixed a range of fill materials using fly ash, fill dirt, cement, and brine. I cured the samples and tested them using a compressive strength testing machine. Based on the testing results, I concluded that a fill material consisting of 65% fly ash, 25% fill dirt, and 10% cement would provide a cost effective grout with suitable compressive strength to prevent sinkhole occurrence at the I&W Site.

INCREASING CASKET DECOMPOSITION RATES, YEAR TWO
Lauren Rymer Mandaville
Seguin High School, Seguin, TX

In many countries such as Israel, burial space is limited. A growing Western trend adopts the Jewish practice of "natural burial" in which a body without embalming is interred in a wooden casket. The purpose of the study was to determine if inexpensive soil additives can significantly increase the number of decomposers present and speed the rate of decomposition of buried wood. Eight five-gallon microcosms were filled with 0.1 L2 each of either sandy or clay soil from freshly dug graves. Twenty pieces of Populus deltoides, ten with clear wood finish and ten not finished, were weighed and interspersed in each microcosm. One microcosm of each soil type served as a control and an additive of 250 cc of nitrogen, 250 cc of lime, or 2250 cc of organic peat was placed into the remaining microcosms. Five hundred mL of water was added every fourteen days; the runoff was collected and measured. After 140 days, the samples were oven dried and weighed again. The weight of the original moisture content was discounted. The relative mass loss of the wood samples exposed to nitrogen, lime and organic peat was then compared to the controls . Results indicated that there was an optimum level of decomposers present (measured through CO2 emissions) and a statistically significant increase in mass loss for the samples exposed to organic peat regardless of either the soil type or the finished state of the wood. In conclusion, inexpensive soil additives will speed the rate of wood decomposition.

A TWO-DIMENSIONAL INVESTIGATION OF HYDRAULIC FRACTURING PRINCIPLES
Jacob Floyd Nichols
Brush High School, Brush, CO

This research project was conducted to study principles behind hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing, commonly known as ‘fracking,’ is used all around the country. It has greatly increased yields and profits in the oil and natural gas industries. I wanted to study fracking more in depth to see how exactly it works. More specifically, I wanted to investigate how increased pressures had an affect on fracturing.<br><br> To study this, I built an apparatus for the fracturing to be formed in. This included a Petri Dish filled with a slurry of glass beads and water. The lid of the dish was inverted to contain the slurry without letting air out. A syringe was connected to the bottom of the dish to introduce air into the slurry. This airflow created the fracturing. In the apparatus, the slurry of glass beads represented a rock layer and the introduction point of air represented one perforation hole in a horizontal drill system. <br><br> Once the apparatus was constructed, experimentation could begin. This was done by introducing air into the slurry of glass beads and simultaneously taking pictures of the fractures forming. Pressures on the slurry were varied by changing masses placed on the top of the Petri Dish. Multiple trials were ran at differing pressures. Because a high speed camera was used, the picture depicting optimal formation could be obtained for each trial. These pictures were then analyzed. <br><br> The pictures were analyzed using different systems of grids. Both circular grids and rectangular grids were placed on the pictures to count the amount of grid sections occupied. The amount of occupied grid sections shows how much fracturing occurs. For each trial at each pressure the pictures were analyzed and the amount of grid sections occupied determined. Averages were then found. <br><br> The numbers were graphed and showed a general increase in amount of grid sections occupied for both small and large masses. This proved the hypothesis correct. If the model is applied to real life fracking, more fracturing would occur at greater depths underground. Drilling companies could increase yields and profits by selecting deeper plays of oil and natural gas.

THE EFFECTS OF INCREASED ALUMINUM PHOSPHATE ON THE SEQUESTERING OF CO2 DONE BY PHYTOPLANKTON
Daniella Deanna Bernadel
Palm Bay High School, Melbourne, FL

The purpose of this project it's to determine if the presence of Aluminum Phosphate would alter the Cyclotella's cell count and lower the atmospheric CO2 ppm level. It is hypothesized that Cyclotella cultures enriched with a higher level of Aluminum Phosphate will have a higher mean cell count. It is also hypothesized that Cyclotella cultures enriched with a higher level of Aluminum Phosphate will have a lower "atmospheric" CO2 level. This experiment is significant because it deals with the problem of global warming an the greenhouse effect. <br><br>In order to collect data, cyclotella cultures were divided into 4 groups. These groups were treated with varying levels of Phosphate.In the CO2 portion of the project each of the four groups had three test tubes. Each test tube was filled with 1000 ppm of CO2 and was left in the enviornmental chamber for a 24 hour period. After the CO2 treatment, the test tubes were removed and CO2 was measured again. <br><br>In conclusion, the hypotheses were accepted because the Cyclotella enriched in a higher level of Aluminum Phosphate had a higher cell mean count and a lower atmospheric CO2 level than the Cylotella cultures not enriched in a higher level of Aluminum Phosphate.

THE MINNIE LYNCH: A COMPARATIVE STUDY IN THE AFFECTS OF PARENT MATERIAL ON WATER QUALITY IN EPHEMERAL STREAMS
Brisha Nicole Wakasugi
Alamosa High School, Alamosa, CO

Is the parent material of the Rawley Andesite/ Bonanza Tuff Contact, which contains permanent and ephemeral stream flows, a contributing factor in compromise water quality in the Minnie Lynch Drainage? The hypothesis looked at was ephemeral streams flowing from the Rawley Andesite/ Bonanza Tuff Contact contain minerals and metlas, however they are not in high enough concentrations to compromise the water quality of the Minnie Lynch Drainage. The source of the contaminatino at te drainage is strictly due to the mining practices and untreated tailing piles of the area. <br><br>The data collected for this project matched the same pattern of the data collected in 2010. The waters closest to the adit of the Minnie Lynch Drainage had extremely acidic pH's, inadequate TDS and conductivity levels, and decreasing metal concentrations. Then as the stream continued the metal concentrations began to increase, and the pH, conductivity, and TDS levels began to nuetralize. Then as the wates reached the alluvial fan the metal concentrations decreased once again, the pH levels became more acidic, and the TDS and conductivity levels worsened.<br><br>The samples taken from the spring were the ones with the most interesting results. Data from the water collected from the springs showed that there were high concentrations of elements such as Zinc, Manganese, and Aluminum. This spring is located relatively close to the part of the stream where metal concentrations began to spike. The hypothesis was not supported; load data water quality sampling and geologic back grounding showed the ephemeral and permanent springs as a source of contamination.

EATING MARS
Lianna Joy Spurrier
Ballard High School, Louisville, KY

In this experiment, radishes were planted in Earth soil, plain JSC-Mars-1A (a Martian regolith simulant), and this simulant treated with BioChar to test the possibility of growing food for future Martian colonies using the present regolith. They were watered, measured, and recorded every day for 35 days. Overall, the average height was the tallest in the radishes grown in Earth soil, but plants in the plain JSC-Mars-1A showed the most development based on the number of leaves. The height of radishes in BioChar treated simulant was lower but more developed than Earth soil plants. A t-test on means, performed on all radish groups besides the ones grown without soil, showed that none of the height differences were statistically significant, leaving the leaf development as the best indicator of development. Because the most plants developed a second set of leaves in Martian simulant, regolith shows promise for future use in food production and may actually grow more productive plants than Earth soil.

ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACTS OF STRAIGHT-LINE WINDS ON THE STRUCTURE AND STABILITY OF A TORNADIC VORTEX
Casey Richard Densmore
Musselman High School, Inwood, WV

Tornadoes are some of nature’s most destructive forces and straight-line winds are common in severe thunderstorms capable of producing tornadoes. The purpose of this experiment was to determine the changes that occurred with the funnel structure as straight-line winds are directed into a vortex. The hypothesis tested in this experiment was that straight-line winds added to a simulated tornado’s environment will alter the structure and stability of the tornadic vortex. A replicate set of experiments was conducted at each of three baseline funnel structures. Variables tested were straight-line wind altitude, speed, and angle entering the funnel. A scale of 0-5 was used to describe tornado structure, which was measured for each trial. Ten replicates were conducted for each set of experimental parameters, for a total of 400 replicates. Statistical analysis was conducted using a One-Way ANOVA with p < 0.05. Based on the experiment, the hypothesis was proven correct. Straight-line winds and their components did have an impact on the structure of the tornadic vorticies. Impacts of the straight-line winds varied with the baseline funnel structure (vortex strength), and the most significant impact of any of the variables tested was noted with a change in the straight-line wind angle. For the two strongest baseline funnel structures, winds aimed in the direction of the funnel maintained or strengthened the overall funnel, while winds aimed against the direction of rotation tended to weaken the funnel structure. In some cases, with the weakest baseline funnel structure, the winds reversed the direction of rotation. The tornado simulator used in this experiment successfully demonstrated the importance of the straight-line winds to the structure of a tornadic vortex.

A NOVEL APPROACH TO LOCATING GEOTHERMAL SYSTEMS IN RELATION TO GEODETIC CRUSTAL DEFORMATION AND STRAIN RATE TENSORS
Benjamin Isaac Pleat
Herricks High School, New Hyde Park, NY

Geothermal energy has shown enormous potential in the western United States as a viable source of alternative energy, although unsuccessful exploration of new geothermal fields impedes progress. Scientists and industry leaders alike seek a concrete exploratory tool that can be used to locate potential blind geothermal resources without expensive drilling methods. My study analyzed the relationship between known geothermal resources in the western United States and GPS-derived strain rate measurements and controlling structural features to create a model of favorable conditions for extensional geothermal systems, predict potential blind geothermal systems, and establish a concrete geothermal exploratory tool. My study revealed that geothermal favorability in the Great Basin is correlated with regions of transtension (ratio of shear to dilatation of 0.5 - 1.5). My findings enhance the existing conceptual model, where shear stress serves to fracture crust while tensional stress pulls faults apart to facilitate heat and fluid flow. Investigation of the relationship between geothermal favorability and the orientation of the no-length-change directions provided additional insights for constraining the locations of individual fields. These findings significantly advance the knowledge of extensional geothermal favorability as compared to plate tectonics, and thereby provide greater predictability of geothermal fields without costly well drilling trials.

EFFECTS OF INCREASED CO2 AND POLLUTION BASED PARTICLES ON GLACIER ICE MELT
Kayla Jane Thompson
Bonneville High School, Washington Terrace, UT

It is commonly accepted among the international scientific community that carbon dioxide (CO2) has a noticeable impact on global temperature change. The impacts of this greenhouse gas may have greater ramifications upon the global environment, specifically the rate of glacier ice melt. This project was oriented towards demonstrating that CO2 may adversely impact and weaken the glacial structural integrity, causing the melting rate of glacier ice to increase. CO2 was dissolved into four (4) .5 L water samples using dry ice. Each sample was introduced to a different amount of dry ice (CO2), 0 g, 7.1 g, 56.7 g, and 113.4 g respectively. The samples were then completely frozen and allowed to melt at room temperature. The amount of liquid water formed was measured every hour. The sample with the most dry ice introduced melted the fastest, indicating that more CO2 increased the melting rate. Five (5) 8 L samples were used to investigate the impacts of varying freezing and melting conditions. All samples were introduced to equal amounts of CO2. Varying conditions included compression, containment during freezing and melting, agitation while CO2 was dissolving, and contamination with soil and plant particles. Data was collected similarly to the four sample test. The control had the highest melting rate, indicating that the variations may not impact the melting rate. In conclusion, the presence of CO2 in the environment may cause structural damage in glacier ice causing it to fracture and break apart at a faster rate.

SURVIVING SEISMICALLY-INDUCED LIQUEFACTION: DYNAMIC CENTRIFUGAL MODELING OF A NOVEL HYBRID FLOATING FOUNDATION SYSTEM
Alex L. Chang
University High School, Irvine, CA

A vast majority of buildings and infrastructures are supported by shallow, liquefaction-intolerant foundations. This project developed a novel hybrid floating foundation that capitalizes on the high compressive strength and buoyancy of EPS geofoam such that, upon liquefaction, a reduced foundation base loading intensity on the liquefied soils would minimize foundation settlement and limit damage to the building. <br><br> The project focuses on testing the hybrid floating foundation at the prototype scale. To reach prototype-scale stress state with a reduced-scale model, a dynamic geotechnical centrifuge, capable of producing elevated centrifugal acceleration and lateral cyclic acceleration was constructed.<br><br> Fifteen centrifuge experiments each consisting of five trials – on footing foundation, mat foundation, and hybrid floating foundation – were conducted on the self-constructed geotechnical centrifuge. Upon reaching the pre-determined gravitational acceleration level at 14 ~ 15G, a shaker was activated to create a lateral cyclic acceleration around 0.72G for a period around 5 seconds to simulate earthquake motion and trigger liquefaction. Extensive pre- and post-experiment measurements, videotapes, and photographs were subsequently analyzed.<br><br> The experimental results clearly validated the performance of the hybrid floating foundation in improving the liquefaction survivability of a building when comparing with conventional shallow foundations. The hybrid floating foundation was shown to settle 25%-80% less than the mat foundation, and 35 to 95% less than the footing foundation. In addition, buildings supported by the hybrid floating foundation remained more intact due to reduced differential settlement and tilting.

REHABILITATING HYDROPHOBIC SOIL TO ALLOW INDIGENOUS BUNCH GRASS GROWTH
Hannah Jeanine Washburn
Sanger High School, Sanger, CA

The objectives of my project are to determine if treating hydrophobic soil with an alkaline solution or an Aqua Gro L solution will speed the rehabilitation process and help allow native bunch grass growth. It is my goal to help the soil get back to its non-hydrophobic state. To make hydrophobic soil I collected coarse, upland soil and covered it with dried leaves and wood. With supervision, I burned the organic material for 8 hours and let it cool. I then did a WDPT test to determine hydrophobicity. I had 4 test soils: untreated soil, hydrophobic soil, hydrophobic soil treated with an alkaline solution, and hydrophobic soil treated with an Aqua Gro L solution. I saturated 12 cups of hydrophobic soil with the alkaline solution and another 12 cups with the Aqua Gro L solution and allowed them to dry. In the bottom of an 8x11 aluminum pan I spread 1 inch of untreated soil, covered this with a 1 inch layer of test soil followed by another 1 inch layer of untreated soil. Next, I spread ¼ cup grass seed and covered this with ¼ inch untreated soil. I then watered the trays, watched, and documented the grass growth. After 2 weeks I pulled 10 plugs from each test tray, rinsed soil away from the root system then weighed and measured the grass/root plugs. I had a total of 4 growing trays and 40 grass/root plugs. The results of testing were that the untreated soil grass/root plugs had an average weight of 8.1 grams after soil rinse and an average root ball length of 7.8cm. The hydrophobic soil grass/root plugs had an average weight of 6 grams after soil rinse and average root ball of 4.8cm. The hydrophobic soil with alkaline solution grass/root plugs had an average weight of 1.05 grams after soil rinse and an average root ball length of 1.5 cm. The hydrophobic soil with the Aqua Gro L solution grass/root plugs had an average weight of 10.2 grams after soil rinse and an average root ball length of 8.8cm. As a hydrophobic soil rehabilitator, Aqua Gro L has the most potential to allow water percolation and promote plant growth with a strong, penetrating root system. This could be a possible solution to the problem of erosion and mud slides of denuded hillsides due to fire. While the occasional fire is considered to be healthy for an ecosystem, hydrophobic soil is not. It can paralyze an ecosystem and be financially devastating due to loss of top soil from excessive erosion and mudslides.

IGNORED MICRO SEASHELLS TELL ANCIENT MARINE ENVIRONMENT
Gyou Tanaka
Chiba High School, Chiba, JAPAN

Macro-sized fossil shells have often been used for environmental reconstruction of marine formations. However, they tend to be transported without significant damage, thus they are not always a good indicator of paleoenvironment. Small-sized shells can be a good indicator of paleoenvironment because they are easily abraded or broken in a short period. The purpose of this study is to reconstruct the paleoenvironment of the Yabu Formation (approx. 300 thousand years ago) in Semata, Japan based on the small-sized shells.<br><br> The surveyed outcrop is located at about 40 km ESE of Tokyo. Sediment samples were collected from 9 horizons, and then washed in water to remove mud contents. Sand grains and small fossils of the size range 0.5 mm to 4.0 mm were sieved, and small mollusk shells were picked up under binocular microscope. Identification of the shells was made with reference monographs and suggestions from museum specialists. Degrees of shell preservations were recorded by the four grades (A to D).<br><br> Out of 1135 individuals picked up from the sediments, 982 small-sized molluscs, consisting of 38 species were identified. Well-preserved shells mostly consist of shallow-marine species living in subtidal to 20-30 m deep. Shells from intertidal zone tend to be poorly preserved (ranks D and C are dominant).<br><br> Paleodepth of the outcrop in Semata is estimated as 10-30 m deep based on the modern ecology of molluscan species. Small-sized shells can be an excellent indicator of paleoenvironment in the future studies.

THE EFFECTS OF VORTICITY ON VORTEX FORMATION AND MORPHOLOGY
David Patrick Murphy
Los Alamos High School, Los Alamos, NM

This experiment determined the effects of vorticity on the formation and morphology of minor whirlwinds, such as dust devils and fire whirls. Vortexes were made with constant updraft and variable air circulation within a confined apparatus, and vortex formation rates were measured for each level of circulation. Visible light was reflected off of glycerin vapor to make airflows within the apparatus visible. Photographs were taken of vortexes in each trial for analysis of formation, morphology, and dissipation.<br><br>The vortexes observed were further analyzed through particle image velocimetry. Low-density particles were dropped into the apparatus and, using a strobe light and a camera, photographs were taken that showed the particles up to eight times at regular time steps. A computer program was used to analyze the images and determine the changes in particles’ velocities over time. This data was used to determine the maximum tangential velocity of the vortex.<br><br>Analysis of collected data shows that at least two ranges of vorticity allow for stable and consistent vortex formation. In stable regions where vortexes dissipated quickly, they also reformed quickly, and where vortexes persisted, they did not form as quickly after dissipation. The data also demonstrates that the properties of a vortex, specifically the manner in which it forms and dissipates, vary with the vorticity at which it formed. Tangential velocities within vortexes were found to increase with vorticity, with the exception of the vorticities where vortexes did not form; these values of vorticity saw slightly decreased tangential velocities. The original hypothesis that only one range of vorticity would allow for stable vortex formation was not supported.

IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF SEA LEVEL RISE ON HURRICANE-INDUCED FLOODING AND INUNDATION IN THE NORTHERN GULF COAST
Taide Ding
Oxford High School, Oxford, MS

NOAA estimates mean sea level rise in the hurricane-prone northern Gulf of Mexico at nearly 1-cm per year, the fastest rate along any U.S. coastline. This makes it inevitable that extreme events such as hurricanes would cause even greater flooding and inundation of coastal regions in the future, posing dire threats to coastal infrastructure. Due to the dominance of multiscale hydrodynamic processes driven by storms, tides, and waves in coastal and estuarine zones, numerical simulation remains the optimum method to obtain geographically detailed assessments of local inundation. Thus, using an integrated cyclonic wind and storm-surge model developed in the previous year and verified through hindcasts of Hurricane Gustav (2008) and real-time predictions of Hurricane Isaac (2012), design storm simulations based on Gustav were conducted for progressive scenarios of future sea level rise (from +0.5-m to +2-m) and climate change-induced hurricane intensification (central pressure decrease) in the northern Gulf Coast. Numerically simulated local water levels were compared with NOAA’s tidal gauge data as well as simplified analytical estimates. Simulations showed that, at locations with open and relatively smooth shorelines, sea level rise and hurricane intensification both correlate linearly with storm-surge and inundation increase. However, locations with more complex coastal geometries (e.g. enclosed by a bay) showed strong nonlinear correlations, with flood level changes often amplified compared to those on an open coast, making numerical simulations crucial in accurately estimating local flood hazards. Assessments of sea level rise like these can provide valuable information for planning long-term coastal infrastructure such as levees, bridges, and industrial complexes.

A REVISED ESTIMATE OF THE EFFECT OF HUMAN CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) EMISSIONS ON GLOBAL TEMPERATURE
Katherine Marie Webb
Tabb High School, Yorktown, VA

The purpose of this research was to assess the impact of a revised estimate of “equilibrium climate sensitivity” (ECS), the equilibrium warming associated with a doubling of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in the atmosphere, on projections of global equilibrium temperature. The revision in ECS changed the mean estimated value from 3.3 to 2.2 degrees Celsius. <br><br> <br><br>To accomplish this, the work developed a systems dynamics model of the earth’s carbon cycle. Human CO2 emissions served as the independent variable (with four levels selected from emission scenarios commonly used by the scientific community) and the change in global equilibrium temperature served as the dependent variable. The model aggregated CO2 concentrations over a simulated period of 110 years and computed the resulting changes in global equilibrium temperature for the old and new estimate distributions of ECS.<br><br>With 2500 trials for each emission level, the model generated CO2 concentration levels for the year 2100 within the range of previously published estimates and calculated the resulting global mean equilibrium temperature to within 4% of the expected temperatures. The results using the new value of ECS were all 1-2 degrees Celsius lower than estimates using the old value. <br><br> <br><br>The study concluded that past projections of equilibrium global temperature for any level of CO2 emissions are likely overestimated by 50% (1-2 degrees Celsius). Additionally, past extreme estimates of 6-10 degree Celsius increases are extremely unlikely (with probability less than .000001). These new estimates should be considered by policy makers as they shape societal responses to global warming.

ANALYSIS OF STANDARD GEOMAGNETIC INDEXES AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE GEOMAGNETIC VARIATIONAL INTENSITY SCALE
Kevin James Beach
Mecosta Osceala Intermediate School District Math/Science/Technology Center, Big Rapids, MI

There are currently two indexes, Kp Index and Dst Index, used to determine the effects of particle events on the geomagnetic field. This study investigated a possible replacement system named the Geomagnetic Variational Intensity Scale (GVIS). Data were downloaded for the Bz component of the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) position, speed (km/sec), and particle density (particles per cubic centimeter) for geomagnetic storms which occurred between 2001 and 2003 according to both the Dst and Kp Indexes. Geomagnetic field data were also downloaded for the same period of time. The Kp and Dst Index values were recorded for each storm while GVIS values were calculated. R and T values were calculated between each of the Kp Index, Dst Index, and GVIS and the appropriate solar wind parameters used; solar wind velocity, solar wind density, solar wind dynamic pressure, Bz strength, and |VBsMax|. The R values indicated that the GVIS was mildly correlated with each parameter while both the Kp and Dst correlated strongly with two parameters but weakly with the remaining three. The T values indicated that all the GVIS R values were statistically significant whereas the only statistically significant Dst and Kp plots were those with high correlation.

THE SECRET'S OF SAN LORENZO VALLEY'S ATMOSPHERE
Connor Burke Lydon, Natalie Gallagher
San Lorenzo Valley High School, Felton, CA

Our purpose is to determine the affect of atmospheric inversions on ground particulate matter 2.5 (PM 2.5) levels, and to compare San Lorenzo Valley's particulate matter 2.5 levels to neighboring areas. We used radiosondes, 200g balloons, helium, parachutes, dereelers, an i-Met 3050 Sounding System, and data from EBAMs. We collected atmospheric data over a period of three months, launching weather balloons three times a week, twice a day to obtain atmospheric inversion data. Particulate matter 2.5 clearly was affected by atmospheric inversions, and increased greatly on inversion days. In some cases, PM 2.5 levels were "unhealthy" on inversion days and "healthy" on non-inversion days. Also, differing topography between San Lorenzo Valley and non-valley areas also influenced particulate matter 2.5 levels; most comparisons had "unhealthy" PM 2.5 levels in San Lorenzo Valley, while PM 2.5 levels in a neighboring area were "healthy". (Ratings derived from a modified Air Quality Index Table we had created). Inversions do affect levels of particulate matter 2.5, and due to this San Lorenzo Valley experienced many unhealthy days for particulate matter 2.5. San Lorenzo Valley experienced much higher particulate matter 2.5 levels then neighboring areas – to such extent that while another area may be experiencing “healthy” PM 2.5 levels, San Lorenzo Valley can be experiencing “unhealthy” PM2.5 levels.

USING MODIFIED NATURAL ZEOLITE TO IMPROVE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF SOIL
Amr Faisal Jarajreh, Dana Shalabi
Jubilee School, Amman, JORDAN

The basicity and high saline content of soil is a conflict in the agricultural field; since basic soil that is saturated with (K+, Na+, Mg, Ca+) has different chemical and physical characteristics than standard soil, which causes ammonium volatilization, increasing salinization and reducing the fertility of the soil. This study endeavors to improve the calcareous soil characteristics by reducing its saturation and the saline content to improve its fertility using modified Zeolite. The Zeolite raw material used in this study was modified by increasing its H+ content (more acidic) to reduce the basicity of soil upon mixing . At the same time, modified Zeolite was capable through ion exchange to reduce the salinity of the soil. This was conducted by monitoring the pH of the acid where the Zeolite was soaked in for different times. The filtrate pH of the modified Zeolite was 8.28 which suggested 2 diverged options: Either the Zeolite was completely destroyed from the highly acidic medium, or the modification process was successfully completed. Thus; the (XRD) was used to observe the crystal structure for the Zeolite substance. XRD results confirmed that Zeolite maintained its crystalline structure. Moreover; the modified Zeolite sample was applied on a selective soil using various concentrations to examine whether treated soil with modified Zeolite improved the characteristics of the soil. The results showed the base saturation of the sample decreased from 2.07 to 1.89. In conclusion; this modified natural Zeolite succeeded to reduce base saturation and salinization to treat the fertility of soil.

CAUSES OF OFFSHORE RAIN BANDS ALONG THE NORTHEASTERN COAST OF TAIWAN
I-Tzu Chen, Yu-Sy Lin
Taipei Municipal Chien-Kuo Senior High School, Taipei, CHINESE TAIPEI

Better understanding of weather systems occurring off the northeastern coast of Taiwan is crucial to the safety of domestic flights from Hualien County to Taipei City because this region comes across the flight path. It is not uncommon to observe the occurrence of offshore rain bands in this region, and however, their formation and characteristics have been poorly understood. The objective of this study is to identify the possible meteorological factors conducive to the formation of rain bands and to understand the characteristics of the rain bands. Based on the preliminary analysis of the radar images and other data sources provided from Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan, rain bands tended to be formed more frequently at night and in winter, approximately 20 to 50 kilometers offshore. The result shows that the formation of rain bands was related to topographically induced wind convergence at low levels and temperature differences between sea water and relatively cool atmospheric air. In addition, a detailed case study was also conducted to illustrate how rain bands are formed offshore. These analyses further support the importance of temperature difference and the interactions between the environmental flow and coastal topography on the formation and subsequent development of the rain bands.
